Oh.  I assumed if you made a new char the slots
---
We’re still
---
Locked until level 50/100/etc.
---
---
---
Ah memories. I had a quad dragon that I used for a while. Was one-shotting everything but I could take a bathroom break while waiting for the reload animation to finish. Use it with stealth perk cards. Have a lot of patience (or just save it for special occasions). Pistols for me were awful.
---
In the wasteland taunt is call Plague walker, the mutation, its how i draw aggro for my team
---
Coming from the Dota community, I don’t know why y’all are downvoting Valseek’s comment. Active dev communication outside of official forums is such a rare and special thing. It might be bad news but don’t shoot the messenger. Not to mention you’re just hiding relevant information from people coming to this thread trynna find what’s up.
---
That sucks man. Guess I got lucky. 
---
Don’t know what to suggest other than keep at it, the mole miner event is a good one failing that go poke around at fissures.
---
I'm so glad I play on PC so all the inept troglodytes like that guy can't send me messages about completely made up bullshit. Sorry your mom had to deal with such a moron, hope she got good rewards to make up for it!
---
'Sir, they have us outnumbered.'
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
"Bullshit, that just means there's *more to shoot!"*
---
That's how I usually handle it.
---
I lock it if I want to try specific things or just build, but tend to leave it open if I just feel like hanging out with whoever's in my party. \^\^
---
/s
---
Agreed. If I headshot a human they should die. I run into cultists today and had to hit them with multiple headshots to kill them. Even walking up and headshotting with a shotgun doesn’t kill them.
---
Doing special ops solo and just raking in all that xp I've gained 12 lvls in 2 days usually it would take me a week
---
[removed]
---
well ill be using vats abit so semi or full auto rifle? thanks
---
It's almost like you didn't read or comprehend any of the criticisms whatsoever. But you do you.
---
&gt;Our main point of disagreement is this: I dont think the issues you point to have as big of an impact on sales or the strategy of Bethesda as you clearly do.
---
Yup, whereas I do think it has a wide reaching impact. 
---
Anecdotally from myself, all the people I know personally that's interested in gaming (literally all), some people I've come across on discord and reddit, opinions of previous hardcore fanboy youtubers and streamers (especially Cohhcarnage, Mr Matty, ManyATrueNerd, etc.) among other all seem to indicate that Fallout 76 has directly affected their outlook in Bethesda as a whole and very much for their future titles of Starfield and ES6. 
---
But we both know how valuable anecdotal evidence is. 
---
We'll see sometime in the future who is more right here. Not that it really matter but still.
---
What’s the point? Daily ops covers that endgame grind now without the loss of mass amounts of ammo on those half robot half tanks
---
I only keep it because it looks pretty on my wall.
---
For the same shit rewards?
---
I always lock it for my junk runs. Ain't nobody touching my aluminum!
---
I understand your pain, TSE heavies break too damn fast.
---
https://imgur.com/a/7AEwqiK
---
Confirmed you can get 3!
---
Yeah but if youre not perked for damaged you'll deal even less..... Yet still fight a L100 enemy. So more ammo, more shots to kill.
---
They posted the same advert on their official Facebook account as well!
---
It's for the torches. 
---
Rather than looking at pics thinking we get everything in them, we ought to be looking at the description then finding those items within the pics.
---
Yes I got 2 "rare" rewards today at one go, this makes sense
---
Ok ill hop on rn
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah.  Not super worried.  And honestly would rather just grind the daily ops (on a good day —- like yesterday.). It’s a lot of fun.  Today’s cold was NASTY.  But when you have a ‘kill legendaries’ challenge.  And they aren’t random spawning.  ;-)
---
As an absolutely NOT stealth player, I'm glad to see something like that.
---
You can't scrap Legendary Perks.    
---
Choices have consequences.
---
Why do y’all have to complain
---
I found it might be more profitable to intentionally fail the paladin and elder tiers for your 5% chance, then doing it again and failing elder for the 10% chance and then doing it once more in under 8 minutes for the 80% chance. Afaik they don’t add up if you first try it in under 8m.
---
Got 2 rare plans on one character today (okay one rare and one uncommon).
---
Seems to be a way to maximize your rolls per day.
---
I mean.  I can always force-spawn the 3* bot in vault 79 with the power armor glitch.   But that takes a fair bit of time to get there.
---
Day 1 joined a group and we brought down the assaultron at 7:58 and it was one of, if not the most, thrilling moment of FO76 thus far for me.
---
Eh, I wish I could say it was a fun experience, but I just didn't find mowing down endless re-spawning enemies very fun - especially when the level 100 Infiltrator you have to kill gets stuck in the wall. :(
---
Seriously auntie Beth, enemies getting completely stuck shouldn't be happening this frequently after two years.
---
I just wish I could find people doing the ops.
---
Learn how to fucking just enjoy shooting fucking things and stop worrying about the rewards for every fucking thing because literally they are just novelties regardless of how literally fucking hard you want other people to be like you.
---
I assumed that photo was highlighting the torches.
---
Marsupial for the win.
---
There's nothing wrong with it.    
---
My main char is 120. Should I start a new char it was three unlocked. If I could swap them out all characters would be somewhat overpowered.
---
Just like 90% of bugs!
---
No shit. Your parents made a mistake and now I’m dealing with it
---
Also, please don't step in front of me while I am holding down the button to complete the uplink. Then I need to start the whole process over again.
---
I just dont use the radio anymore. I choode to use other means to get my wasteland music fix. I think there is also a music stream on youtube that goes 24/7..
---
 Hope this helps
---
Here's my wishlist;
---
Bethesda going bankrupt.
---
Great idea. Maybe write a weekly post about how it goes? The ups and downs of starting a new toon in 1W. I for one would be very interested in reading that.
---
edit: spelling
---
Yeah, but ammo is far easier to get. 
---
My highest is a 350 hvy, my lowest is 80 2h melee. Killing higher level mobs is as expected. Rewards are also far better.
---
Older players with stocks of armor and weapon choices will have a blast, newer players...
---
not so much.
---
I've seen a lot in the mire as someone else said; east of the map generally. I tend to do other dailies or weeklys until rad rum is on. I go through dry spells but I've seen a lot since the update. You might just be unlucky
---
Sneak attacks are just 100% broken this patch, I can't proc sneak attacks with any weapon, hidden or caution....
---
They've quadrupled the camp budget since release, and if anything it seems to have been increased a little more since patch 22. We do still need more budget though.
---
"Sometimes, i think about burning this camp down"  
---
That sentence made me laugh so hard, when i first heard it.
---
Thank you and I can't wait to see yours. https://youtu.be/aa3KI3ygJhE this one is my Haunted house from last year. You can see this year's on my twitch channel http://www.twitch.tv/savethezombiestv/v/729811146?sr=a&amp;t=20s
---
Though it's not completed there. I'll do a complete run through when I've done the finishing touches.
---
Story of my life ...
---
Not working without vats either!
---
I feel ya. I do the same when lead farming. ^.^
---
No cosmetics (including camp items) are available gold besides chicken coop.
---
Yeah the daily op today was good. Not as entertaining as yesterday’s explosions but I’m really enjoying them so far.
---
I feel like 'downvote the messenger' is TOTALLY appropriate here.  And fun to do!  You are just repeating rumors with no proof whatsoever, giving the lie more power than it should ever have, giving it a platform to grow.  You aren't part of the solution, but part of the problem. It's like continuing the idea of Pizzagate.  Or flat earthing.  Or anti-vaxxing.  Are you a russian troll on break from ruining the election and still feeling the need to disrupt?  Or is the FO76 subreddit your full-time job to fuck up?
---
How's that for ballistic reactionary?  ;)
---
I would love a recording of 'Tis but a flesh wound" in assaultron voice.
---
But assaultrons don't have flesh so probably won't happen.
---
I have 3 gauss minigun god rolls on my rifleman build, all were rewards from events or purveyor. My best handmade drop, a level 35 vampire FFR.
---
You can buy that with gold now
---
Yup, the boomerang on the health bar for shotgun damage is even worse now, at least for my shotguns.
---
I have noticed the same thing with my camp budget. I think I had somewhere around 4 flamingo units but I am down to one.
---
Morgantown scorched, level 15, unmodified 10mm pistol, 3-4 shots per kill, 3-4 killed in about as many seconds, still alive.
---
Huntersville, level 150 with food/heavy hybrid build, AA 50 cal, around 5-6 shots per kill, around 3-4 killed in less than 10 seconds, also still alive.
---
That's not to say I don't sympathise with your situation. It's just the "bullet sponginess" isn't inherent to the enemy (aside from the bosses). It's more a weapon/build issue.
---
Yea I normally leave 2 flamingos of budget for doing the building dailies and after the patch I had to delete 2 items to build anything , I did not have any type of building exploits going just a regular camp.
---
i think i added you
---
I started a new toon only level 15 so far but honestly...i see no real big difference and i didn't change anything how i normally start a new character. Certain areas are definitely harder. Grafton city seems harder than before. 
---
I will say I've been playing awhile and know a lot more than someone who just picks up the game, but they wouldn't know any different anyways. 
---
I don't think the game is too hard now, but i understand that is subjective.
---
Took me 22 minutes the first time. Open a public Daily Ops team and let random people join. Do it a couple times to learn the fastest route. Dont even bother fighting the enimies at the start if you can help it. Even if you dont get a rank the first time you can go in and try again! The second time i got it righhttttt under 8 minutes and that reward boost was even better than the \~200 ammo you get anyway.
---
That’s not true. Season ended last week and then they were gone. New season started this week. 
---
That how if *should* have worked IMO, but unfortunately they did not allow you to claim during the week in between.
---
More shotguns.    
---
Make laser weapons a lot better as well as the plans and mods for them.
---
Normal enemy legendary spawns across the map need to be buffed, because they're a laughably poor alternative to playing daily ops now.
---
yawn 😒
---
Foundations break now? I thought they were only breakable in Nuclear Winter!
---
I’ve only had them in my first try each time and I was grinding them out a fair bit for stimpacks
---
TL;DR: No clue. I've heard it both ways - that it prevents diseases from curing naturally or that it doubles their duration. I haven't been able to test because no one seems to have the serum.
---
Long winded: You know... I've been playing since the beta and never bothered with Plague Walker. Then, recently, I thought I'd give it a go on my melee character. I haven't found a single person with the serum in stock. I also haven't seen any content creators showing the mutation in action.
---
I'm of much the same mind as you, I think. I want to give it a go... but I also want them to stack until I decide to cure them. Who cares if it's just one disease WHEN (if) you have one... I want my junky melee bruiser to be a bringer of pestilence and the plague. I want enemies to die choking in the putrid air around him as he creates shockwaves with his giant hammer. I want them to melt in the contagion he spreads as they strike him and the air fills with crackling electricity and his armor reverberates their own attacks against them.
---
But... alas... I guess I'll have to settle with a tickle in the back of their throat because I've got the whoopsies.
---
Try running through The Burrows. I've had good luck seeing 2-4 legendries.
---
I didn’t feel like running today’s more than twice tho.  The ice effect is nasty and I don’t feel there is any defense against it (is there?). Other than kill them first.   And worst is when you are rushing to the next flag and they slow you down .... ugh.  
---
Exploding enemies were not only fun.  But you can put on the fireproof perk to protect yourself.  And various armor mods.  
---
Is there an anti-cold perk/mod that I just am oblivious to?
---
Lol. Happy cake day
---
My favourite Easter egg is in the golf course clubhouse ( I forget the name) there’s a locked fridge with a clown holding a red balloon.
---
To me, enemies scaling with your level is just terrible and lazy game design. What is the point of getting stronger if you will never be strong enough? What is the purpose of enemies having a level at all at this point? It's just a irrelevant number now. You will never see varying enemy levels anymore... Not only you will never see a lower level enemy again, you will never see a higher level as well... To me this kills the immersion and variety of the game. Everything will feel the same, always...
---
Ah so only a few items? That sucks for the people that joined late.
---
So meaning to say, high level cannot get low level arms n gift to the newbies anymore? I will get level 45~50 legendaries instead of level 1~10?

(You know, it is actually HARD not to naturally include punctuation.   Perhaps we should be praising his skill at it instead of poking fun.)
---
Sneak attacks are broken and just don't work this patch! Hidden, caution, any weapon type, vats or manual!
---
Same, I play a lot of red dead and lately far cry so I’m only level 30 in fallout 76. There is no reason a .44 round to the head won’t kill a scorched in the forest....I like set levels. Make a new big area that scales for the crazy high levels .
---
Listening and changing are two different things. Bethesda doesn't know how to balance, they nerf everything good until everything is a bullet sponge. TSE was the META, it was too powerful, everyone could agree to that, but they nerfed it so much it was almost useless unless you had a normal TS or E variant of the gun or one without perks. People found a new META, Bloodied and Junkies, wasn't insanely OP and did well against bullet sponge enemies, so what did they do? Nerf it just as drastically as they did the TSE. Damage for all my guns is halved now. I'm punished for being below 20% with my Bloodied Fixer that does a handful of damage more than a Hardened Receiver Lever Action Rifle. Bloodied was decently balanced in the sense of High Risk High Reward. You can argue Serendipity can save you a lot, 45% chance to evade damage, so why not nerf that to 30% at max rank?
---
....I mean that's helpful advice for daily ops....but totally irrelevant to this post?
---
Anti armor recently got fixed for energy weapons
---
I run the same thing and I haven’t noticed that much of a difference
---
Flamers are expensive to run and hard to keep stocked with ammo. Not to mention, many people are tanky enough that they don't need an outside source of healing. It'd be cool to see someone doing it though. Too often I see level 400 people running around just mowing down everything like a black hole of selfishness, it'd be refreshing to see one running around enabling low level and weaker players. Public grouping has really enabled this style of play, though. Once upon a time, this would have been entirely impossible unless you had friends to play with who were always on when you were.
---
I'd say yes. It depends on what you're looking for I guess - like most games. I love it, but The PvP isn't voluntary. If you're a PvE player (which I mostly am) you're going to have some frustrating times, but it's still a ton of fun to me. I'm currently trying to improve at PvP so that I can enjoy the game more fully. It is A LOT DIFFERENT than it was on day one. There is a lot more to do with longer adventures, more voyages, new bosses, and new areas of the map.
---
Just did a reset and tried swapping some things around.
---
DR numbers are 346,287E,85R no PA and 544,488E,405R with PA
---
My furious Handmade and Hunting Rifle are 135 and 245 respectively - both with exploding rounds and maxed demo perk.
---
Are these all just extremely low for my level?
---
Can someone explain what a flamingo unit is?
---
That’s weird. I could claim the rewards between seasons. I assumed it was like that for everyone.
---
Build? Used to melee and kill in 15 seconds. Haven’t tried much with the new patch
---
Can’t use that in PA ;)
---
Well yea... they are limited time rewards. 
---
I don’t personally like seasons at all, but it is what it is.
---
Join and travel to me idk how to check friend requests lol
---
I think Assaultrons and Super Mutants are now far too tanky for how much damage they do. There’s no reason for me to waste over 300 .45 ammo and literally every last Stimpaks I had just to get this toy for this stupid raider kid.
---
Oh and then the quest glitches and the kid got stuck so now I have to waste it all again........
---
Wah!!!  
---
There's always one. Typical you think I care what you think after that 'insult'.
---
I seem to recall a certain developer claiming that this game could be enjoyed either in groups or as a single-player title...
---
I wont be happy till I can build a 10 room mansion with a garage and pool house .......also a pool.
---
Once you complete a daily op level successfully you have to wait a whole day for another chance for that level.
---
So if you do one, and on your first try unlock Elder because you completed in under 8 minutes, you get a chance for the rare plans for each level. 
---
So you’d get three chances for a rare plan.
---
5% for initate
---
10% for paladin
---
80% for elder.
---
If you get paladin on your first daily op, then you get the two chances and can try again for the Elder level. 
---
Once you unlock all three levels, you can still run it but you won’t get rare rewards until the next day.
---
Could you rephrase that? 😆
---
Man even the things that shouldn’t kill you now kill you. You ever get jumped by 2 hordes of mole rats as a bloodied build lol it’s ANNOYING
---
The plans exist but are rare
---
It sucks.  
---
I don't use PA b/c I spend enough time making sure I have mats to keep my gear maintained. I don't want another set to worry about.
---
Intriguing idea.... I like that you based your theory on the road map. Little hints like that would be fun.
---
Personally there are many options I would prefer over a vault, but not against it! Would be cool if we could get back into 76 as we left it. I'd keep my room exactly the same but redo the whole rest of the vault.
---
Oh we got a funny guy do we
---
Yeah. Prices on them just got crazy
---
Good point. I haven't used PA in ages since I'm always overencumbered and ironically get more carryweight outta legendary stats than I do calibrated shocks in my excavator.
---
I dislike playing in groups but I have a mule that's high enough level to partake in the ops, but not good enough to solo it. although I did manage the blood eagles with it yesterday.
---
anyway, joined a group and was surprised at how effective they were: 5:30. don't think it was coordinated, either.
---
Oh you mean the criticisms that I've commented on in many another thread?
---
Feel free to rehash why you're upset that you can't one shot everything. 
---
Or why you can't stand in a mob of enemies and survive easily while you blast them away. 
---
Or how unfair it is to low level players. Because I definitely didn't start an new toon the night the patch dropped, not have I mentioned it in several other posts, where I found it more difficult but not punishing. Dying 3 times now across the first 20 ish levels.  And having to use cover....nor running from the occasional fight. ...
---
Or how bullets and ammo are now somewhat more valuable in a nuclear wasteland, and you can't feed your Heavy Gunner Ammo eater with zero effort. 
---
Or about the nerfs/bullet sponginess. How my not nearly optimized rifleman build now needs to take 6 or 7 shots to kill some things, instead of 1-2.
---
On a fully built character i haven't had any problem with them, but a new character i could see them being more difficult. Part of the reason why Grafton was harder to get through.
---
The amount of space a flamingo takes up
---
Yep. Every patch somebody posts that food and drink bars are going down quicker and it gets upvoted by hundreds. With 0 proof. In fact, a few patches ago, somebody did a comparison using juiceheads beta footage to compare it to that update and there was no real difference. It'll still be posted though.
---
Shit, numerous times I've seen many people here defend exploiters just because it means being against Bethesda. Its ridiculous sometimes.
---
This shit has been out for 3 days my guy!! Some people have jobs and shit!! Getting triggered over a daily ops is pretty funny too!!! Good day to ya

---
Made a new alt just for the patch, seems alright so far.. granted its only 20. What type of build you running? Im guessing since the max scaling for the Forest is lvl50, your refering to that?... oohh that just means builds are going to be pretty much complete before or around lvl50 if your a new player...
---
It is a method of measuring how much budget is used up. Basically, you look at the cost of one of those flamingo decorations. They use up the lowest amount of budget out of all the other CAMP items. You then compare other items to see how much budget they take up in comparison. For example, an CAMP item might take up the same amount of budget as building 5 flamingos.
---
I was surprised that removing a legendary perk card ALSO costs 2 perk coins. That was shady to me.
---
Ok i figured it out
---
What time do they reset?
---
Dang. You got me there
---
Agreed. Sudden absurd death in a bloody build is annoying. 
---
But it's the trade off. High risk build that requires attentiveness.
---
This is amazing
---
I haven’t even started the sword kills. Probably just use a ski sword since I sold my blade of bastet like a moron.
---
Finnegans Wake 76
---
Can you share you build? I would like to compare and see
---
I love when the warden says that line "it seems madd dog malone has escaped... aGaIn!"
---
Awesome! I found a team like this last night and we completed 3 as well. 
---
What shotgun are you using? My 3* bloodied explosive combat shotgun was still getting 1 hit kills on the blood eagles yesterday.  I'm level 165.  I believe all of the blood eagles capped at level 75.
---
i know the plans are rare
---
stealth is and has always been pretty wonky.  Bethesda takes 10% of vendor sales to pay for Todds hair plugs. That's really all I got.
---
Yes. I have that. Why does it do that?
---
First, use the black powder weapon that works with your build. Rifles and Dragon for riflemen and so on.
---
Second, Watoga for robots. Become mayor and they won't even fight back until it's nearly too late. And their friends won't help so it'll always be one on one. If you're not doing much damage, weaken them first with whatever you normally use and finish them with the black powder weapon.
---
I know One Wasteland is a thing, but you might also have luck with the Liberators that hang around Vault 76.
---
I’m a bloodied build. Bruh
---
Cool
---
Thank you. The mid-range for sure, but I think it's safe to say that the curve is rough on a lot of people all the way to the highest range. Totally survivable, but there are lots of times you just want to chill. A ton of high level people play a lot, but may not have the best builds or want to fight for their life that often to enjoy a game they've been loving. I know a bunch of 150+ lvls who rarely go to the Bog or Mire because they don't enjoy that gameplay. I enjoy it, but it's def a sometimes snack on nights I just want to build or grab a couple quick challenges.  
---
I love that One Wasteland brought the ability for people to play together while keeping it challenging &amp; possible across levels.  It'd be nice if the curve was compressed a little more in lower level zones or damage scaling was slightly more comparable so that everyone still had a space.
---
sneak multipliers don't trigger if you target is in combat with anything else, player or mob. just in case you didn't know.
---
the quote unquote, 'multiplier' is working, but Bethesda made it additive as well. so now my flamer is getting a whopping extra 37 damage with covert operative level 3.
---
there is a limit only because they take up budget and they require power which means more budget needed for power plant. I usually see people do that with workshops since the budget for those is much higher and they can place a ton underground as a result. Plus if you build it in your camp and someone can prove you did it (easy enough to do with video recordings and/or screenshots) you can get into trouble for breaking the terms by taking advantage of an exploit (possible ban). I was also told they are adding something that checks camps as you login for anything that can not be built and if found it prevents your camp from being placed or reports you but not 100% sure how true that is (never felt the need to cheat when ammo is so easy to come by as it is). I actually found this because I was looking up that glitch hoping they patched it or something.
---
[It is](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_Engine). 
---
&gt;	A primary issue facing the developers was that components of the core engine (**dating back to Gamebryo used in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind**) such as quests or world loading were designed centering on a single player, a paradigm that would need to fundamentally change to allow multiple players spanning multiple worlds.
---
Dude I hate them so much, I'm a tank build and can tank everything in game(even SQB and 3head). But theses monsters sonic attack drains my health so much
---
Then my quick heal bugs out and I die -_-
---
&gt; And Deathclaws that can kill you...... 
---
It's not just the Deathclaws that can kill you. It's also the liberators that can also kill you.
---
It's like the difficulty is dialled permanently to 100% so the pressure is constant. 
---
Some people love this. I'd much prefer something more in the middle where there are lulls in pressure and difficulty so you can take a breather for a moment but when challenges present themselves, they're actual challenges.
---
Thank you. I do try.
---
It's not overly common,but it does happen. Like you did, just take advantage of having a good team and get as many runs in as they're willing to do. I haven't had a mic recently but I'm grabbing a new one today specifically for daily ops, they're such a good addition to the game.
---
Hey I had this bug, just unequip future Tec skin CAMP and that should fix it
---
I don’t think so. I did ok in my power armour and using a Gatling plasma it fires fast enough to drop mobs even when I’m frozen.
---
I like when ppl can't be bothered to car about formal writing, seen enough of it in my college years that a comma splice run on sentence preposition at the end is refreshing to me, sort of. Who cars
---
Well my only choice is to get fucked and never complete this quest because I do chip damage while she deletes me in less than a second. This balancing was made for the high levels and not a single thought was given for any of us newer players.

What about the baby carriage with letter blocks arranged as “Gary” in the same building?

IMO, Threedog was the best radio host. Mr-new vegas is a close secound.

I have a QE Western that destroys stuff pretty well. Even the humble 10mm has its moments. Having Tank Killer work for pistols now also makes a big difference.

The game is no longer fun for me and it's now a grind.  Nerf damage output while increasing enemy levels, WTF?  I have never been butt hurt by any of the bugs and actually found those amusing, but this imbalance isn't one of those, it's intentional.  
---
One Wasteland is a great idea, and I was totally looking forward to it until actually playing w/the nerf.  Instead, we are back to farming resources like a new character for ammo and armor repair which undermines the axiom of an RPG.  We level up to make the tedious become casual, so that it's more enjoyable are now free to explore.
---
I've only played twice since the update, which is unusual.  Normally it's at least twice daily to meet the daily challenge quota since I have 2x accounts.  I haven't even bothered to check out the season offerings to see if I'd miss out on things because at this point, I don't care.
---
I've already cancelled my Fo1st account renewal and currently looking for something else of interest.  I'll definitely return to the game if things change since I love the universe.
---
FUs are how many flamingos a camp object takes up. example: crafting benches take up 5fu and halloween mr. fuzzy takes up 1fu.
---
Yeah... Technical Data USED to work that way. Then the changed it to where you only needed to pick one up to start it again so then I would mule about 100 of them for a friend and would hand him one at a time for him to turn in. THEN they nerfed it again to one FRESH copy of Technical Data per day...
---
Working fine for my bloodied unarmed guy. I'm not sure on my chameleon mutation guy, I have all Weightless armour on and he isn't cloaking
---
I only use pa for my cores but for some reason  my stack of 40 cores keeps splitting with half used cores lol filling up my inv
---
Okay but picture this; marsupial ghouls.
---
The Uranium Fever I ran yesterday had more people in it than I’d ever seen before (and everyone was super polite about killing the legendaries too!). The Queen was crowded as well. Maybe people are just getting used to the changes in your time zone? Or are hesitant because they haven’t tried it out yet?
---
(No way I’m going near campfire tales though, those enemies were obnoxious enough as it was)
---
With the update the game has moved into more of an MMO mode, where optimized builds and quality gear full sets are a requirement. People who made jack of all trades builds with multiple weapon focuses or who have quality of life perks instead of damage buff perks are going to struggle. My suggestion is to take a look at your build and do some research on how to optimize it with one weapon focus. The days of getting by trying to be a jack of all trades terminator with multiple weapon focuses and mix matches of gear and perks like a single player RPG are over it seems.
---
Might have been inside my red rocket, it was a while ago, the point is dont set it on something that's breakable.
---
how do i join you lol
---
Ah gotcha. Thanks! Actually really smart wish they’d implement an actual base unit of measurement to see how much you budget you have left though. Maybe that’s the engineer in me though
---
I play a tank/medic/support combo main character and would absolutely love a ability that keeps enemies locked onto you over other players. Been rocking this role since the start and it's my favorite way to play the game; with One Wasteland our builds are finally useful.
---
One of those countless times reported bugs that bethesda doesn't bother to fix. It's has been around since launch of the game.
---
I’ve run the nukes with no issues at all, people still love that sweet xp
---
And OF COURSE people will prioritize new content.
---
The red rocket breaks yes, but things come back when repaired, it's actually a great way to protect delicate or expensive things like vending machines or rad showers! As they vanish without breaking.
---
I don’t know about you but Iv recently came back from a break and when I did a queen and a the colossus Iv had tons of people can’t say for public events haven’t been doing them at all as of now but I need to since I can solo them with relative ez
---
How? Qhat level are you and whats your build ive been mowing right through them
---
Well i mean couldn't you go do another quest or events and level up and get better gear and try again? Recruit some help for the quest? You have options.
---
If you get elder on first try, you get 3 rolls. Lots of pictures around from people showing getting 3 rare rewards in one elder result.
---
Thats the thing, i can have a yellow hidden bar and get same damage, i shoot something and everything see's me, two days ago i was hitting 1500 dmg with a single shot now i am lucky to get 150, but enemies are 4-5 time stronger, this equates to 10% damage to 4 times stronger enemies, which means i burn resources that i just do not have time to collect, yes we needed a damage nerf but this is just bonkers!
---
that really sounds good!
---
ign is caserman
---
Ohhhh, I see, I should be ok with bugs in games especially micro transactions because they are hard to fix 
---
It is Not like I paid anything for the game /s
---
See i feel the same as you. Since this nerf i have played maybe once since the patch 22. Usually i would spend at least 4 hours of an evening on it, now i played a total of 2 hours. Other games have gotten my interest until such a time they release new content or at least fix the 60% damage nerf  roll it back so its a 30%, then ill consider renewing my fo1st and engaging in the game again
---
I got the Spec Ops outfit and mask after my Elder round today.
---
Don’t blame you in the slightest. I often did it for the weapons when it was reasonable. Despite being a crap weapon, the whistle had one of the best challenges:
---
Kill an enemy while using a stealth boy
---
Destroy a turret while sneaking
---
Hack a terminal at night
---
Pick a lock at night
---
Take a camera picture of a humanoid at night
---
If we cant pick legendary affects on untradable weapons then we should be able to trade them to people who need those affects that we dont need.
---
Dupers and hackers have tools to trade untradables already so it just hurts legit players.
---
Join the op
---
What a lot of inaccurate noise this was...
---
Do you know if the Bird bones with Marsupial on top of that Team bonus still causes the flying effect? Haven't seen it in ages. 
---
I remember back in the day seeing all the melee builds running in the air swinging at the SBQ as she'd fly by xD
---
 just subscribed ,tanks
---
Yep. Built it on the basic torso, then added atomic onslaught paint to the torso.
---
That blade of bastett might be handy. All that armor penetration could free up some perk points.
---
Yep, day one and again today, yesterday I got signs plan...
---
I would speculate that you would swap between the two builds depending on circumstances? Berserker except on some events where that simply won’t work (looking at you daily ops)
---
I love how you get that I’m telling you that you should accept bugs in the game.
---
Not even close. What I did was give you a factual and reasonable answer.
---
I’m sorry if my experience and insight into how games are made upset you.
---
Hi,
---
I know im really late to the party. However, can you help with this please. I'm currently on the mission where you need to enter 'the cave'. The broadcast part is bugged for me.
---
I've tried to force the quest forward by entering the cave. However I'm still missing the card. I'm supposed to have received it from an earlier set of missions already completed to get to this point. 
---
Not sure where or how to pick the card up for the cave.
---
From what I understand, the effects do stack, but not from the original weight. So if you equip 1 armor with 20% reduction it’s just that. However when you equip more than one piece, or combine it with a perk, it reduces 20% from the new weight, instead of the original. If that makes sense. I’m not totally 100% on this, so if someone else knows more please correct me. Also I agree the chemist mod is more worth it than grocers, I always carry more chems than food/drink.
---
Based off what they did with Skyrim I wouldn't be surprised in the least if they had another release for it. Hopefully not though and it just reads the PS4 disc as that would be what backwards compatibility truly is.
---
A stealth mode would be a nice inversion of the current "stealth is not optional" mode.
---
That's the thing, we do put effort into our builds. Now our builds are invalid because they don't fit into the "one wasteland" meta. 
---
This also isn't a survival game, it's a fallout game. People will continue to expect to play it as a fallout game.
---
Either it has no power or you have more than 1 placed. If you place more then 1 down they all use the same console and it will be the most recent one that was placed that controls everything.
---
Same probs just disguised in the excuse of it being harder now... Altho a good point has been brought up about the scaling of lvl 50 ghouls being harder to kill than, like, a lvl 62 ghoul (for lower lvl ppl?). I dunno the lvl 50 and 62 ghouls are still one shot for me
---
Upvoted solid advice
---
First day of spec ops I got the light plan and that is the last time I got a rare reward.
---
All three days I've got elder tier and only 1 rare
---
Yeah that's actually a good idea lol I had not thought of it👍🏻
---
are you *sure* you're getting the same damage, though? because I tested it multiple times and I'm clearly getting the sneak 'multiplier' to trigger, as paltry as it is.
---
get up close to the mole miners in blackwater and note your damage standing up, then crouching, then with covert op. I can guarantee is working, but it's not multiplicative any longer. so you won't be getting a 2.5\* bonus, far from it.
---
special and sneak perks are also additive now, apparently. so if you relied too much on agility and nothing else, then your ability to stay hidden will also suffer.
---
I know it's a recycled prehistoric game engine, but even then, netcode shouldn't affect how item modifiers are calculated.
---
If you get Elder, it rolls the 80/20 chance and then lower two ranks chances also, some got 3 rewards in one go...us...nowt
---
Please consider making it optional somehow. I just want to go back to the game I paid for and actually enjoyed playing.
---
Oh lots of buggy broken games from them. Then there is Origin which is the hottest piece of garbage there is for a launcher.
---
It almost feels like when you complete all ranks instead of having a rare plan chance separately for all the different ranks everything is just counted as one chance 
---
Basically instead of doing 5/100,10/100 and 80/100 separately It goes 95/300 just one time 
---
Only speculation but 80% nothing 4 times in a row seems odd
---
Really? Dang that sucks
---
yes.
---
There was only one week between.. last wed through this Tuesday. Are you sure?
---
Just doing the scorched challenges for now but I’ll definitely keep that in mind when I start the robot ones.
---
Nice
---
This so much for this topic, this sub, and life!
---
Elder every day for me and the only plan I have is those bulb lights. I don't think those are a rare plan, right? Those things are bright af and wash out everything nearby, I can't see a reason to ever use them.
---
Bollocks. My commandos are fine and my gunslinger am at as well be using a pea shooter.
---
It works as well as it always has for me
---
White springs landed me 4 legendaries in one run, keep an eye out for uranium fever and AWOL armaments. If you do AWOL armaments, I usually clear out the generals steakhouse right after since there’s quite a few super mutants there.
---
Ya, if you use the rug/mat trick you can pack most of the plants right on top of each other (makes it easy to make adhesive farms)
---
I’m guessing they will be under wall decor. They might be mixed in with other metal signs. 
---
Congrats. I’m after those myself
---
I saw that and it didn’t even click till now haha. Fuckin Gary.... poor Gary.
---
Yeah but they deal the same damage so isn’t junkies always superior? It seems like a whole lot of extra effort for nothing.
---
I'm 1 for 3 on my main right now. I've had two "None".
---
I just started running it on an alt, and got a reward.
---
This would be awesome ... and make the ammo box and scrap box shared across characters, and make gunpowder a junk item please :)
---
For scorched, I'd recommend Line in the Sand and the Glassed Caverns. Especially the later. For reasons... 😉🤫
---
Apparently people think it's triggered if a new player joins the op as the meter is rising. If there were legendaries in there I wouldn't be sleeping tonight.
---
I claimed the rewards a day after it ended
---
Are they worth anything? And can you get them other than level 50? I’m not enjoying the 11 pound weight in my stash if I can’t even display it.
---
I was using my 2sh Gatling Gun.  Oh man it’s slow when frozen.   I guess Next time I’ll try to break out my  .50 instead.   Or switch to shotguns.
---
If I get stronger then so does it. There is no progress anymore.
---
Ok that was always allowed.
---
I think the mutant slayer helped but it has the bash. Used to do West Tek one shotting everything now it's two shots since the patch. Plus I use chinese stealth and sneak when grinding. Daily ops just same suit run around use Vats two shells and get about quadruple back
---
I'm not familiar with strange in numbers, ill have to look at it. Is that a legendary or what special does it belong to? I've never used mutations, the amount of perk points required for starched genes etc has not been appealing to me. This all feels besides the point though. I'm not entirely sure all that will bring back the effectiveness of my rifle build. Hopefully I'm wrong.
---
Got liquid courage + burrows signs plans yesterday. Makeshift solar panel + vault 94 jumpsuit plans today.
---
I'm enjoying it!
---
Wish I could get another one. Definitely should be able to fabricate a new one even at some cost to the player.
---
I feel like I’m the only stealth commando that hasn’t had any issues, it’s just easier to level. Even in daily ops I get half my ammo back from staying back and looting after the event
---
It's no longer fun being forced back to grinding for resources for ammo, armor and weapons repair like a low lever character.  That premise fundamentally undermines an the RPG axiom of sacrifice/reward.  The bugs were unintentional, but the nerf and enemy level increases are not.  I'm jumping ship.  Again, not fun.
---
I made a dude for NW, he just uses AAE stuff and the occasional 2-hander and it's not difficult or anything. I did waste a lot more ammo running a silo on my junkies character than I normally do
---
Sorry you feel that way. I like the update. It feels to me more what the game should have been at launch.
---
Antifa follower confirmed!!
---
Something something Genuineeeeeeee H I C K O R Y
---
You can get up to 3 rare rewards per day.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iupqbw/psa_this_is_how_daily_ops_rewards_work/
---
4min, so enough time if you have decent people, or at the very least close to the entire fight. Too bad I've been junking all sacks for the acid and nuke mat. Them shits are too heavy ngl.
---
Unfortunately you can’t trade or sell or move to another character. So yeah, enjoy the weight gain. I’m in the same boat.
---
You... blah blah blah...
---
Me ... yawn.
---
It's probably gunpowder in misc. I dropped like 900 of it on the floor last night and freed up like a hundred lbs.
---
Stop sure, everybody needs a break and sounds like your majorly burned out... just dont quit, seems like a lot work to just push aside. Cyberpunks gunna drop in a few weeks. Log into 76 for dailys, gold, and script like most of us do at this point and then go play something else. That way when December rolls around and they drop new weaps/armor youve kept up with the grind.
---
Actually, when you blueprint it the game gives you a message saying it is something you can not build and asks you to confirm the blueprint. That is how you tell it is a glitch since the game tells you plainly you should not be able to place the item but you can. Also, since it technically violates the terms of service you might get banned for doing it.
---
What public team gives you damage boosts? I've only ever used the events team.
---
How are u ranking up so fast enemies that I farmed amate worth less now. So what are u doing playing ops?
---
also trying to sneak through Charleston capital building(they say they fixed the lighting, yes to the point you can now see nothing except in vats, when you exit vats i can not find the bodies for shit) no tools have weapons so no random shooting and no sneak bonuses, i can't do it it was traumatic enough getting through the first few levels of this game with a new build, i stuck with it for 6 months and grinded my arse off to get a half decent character with a full set of secret service armour and now i need 10-20 bullets to beat a tool that i should kill with one, it is so disapoint ting hitting earl in the head and getting 12 dmg, 12dmg, tow days ago that was 120
---
Yeah my first run landed me Valeria signs and a stash box which I forget the name of.
---
Right, even before the patch they could stun and hit like a truck 😬
---
Stacks up to 90%. Only exception backpack mods don’t stack with perks. IMO, since I lose 10% on the 5th piece, I do 4 pieces of WWR (80%) and 1 piece of FDC Reduction (20%) The chemist mod is fantastic but just remember, because I made this mistake, I got the chemist mod, dropped Traveling Pharmacy and moved those points to my luck. Not realizing when I put on my PA, the backpack is unequipped and I was over-encumbered by like 600lbs lol
---
Edit: Stupid Auto-Correct
---
Yes please - this is one of the few suggestions here I think is really good - it makes sense as a FO1st benefit, and seems like it would be pretty easy to do ... I would add the suggestion that they make the scrap and ammo boxes SHARED across all of your characters, but that may be more complicated...
---
Wow...I've been thinking exactly the same thing, also around since beta. I dropped FO first last month. Only weapon I have left that does any damage worth mentioning is my gauss shotgun, and even that's bugged.
---
This.
---
&gt; If they want stealth snipers to do extremely well, the first step is to remove the timer.
---
What you would suggest to be put in exchange? They clearly want Daily OPS to have tiers based on something.
---
No, even my stealth sniper who Is wearing a hodgepodge of gear she earned as she leveled up and an instigating sniper rifle, touting all of chameleon of a mutation, is doing fine in everything minus daily ops (She does rely too heavily on stealth to be of much use at this point.
---
You not liking the game does not make it a bad game.
---
It also helps if the team are working together which is quite rare lol
---
Does anyone if these are connected per account or characters chance for Rare rewards
---
I dunno if I'd say that. I lost my deathclaw to level 80 gutsies attacking my forest camp today.
---
There there edgelord. Sempai noticed you.
---
But it’s scary in there.
---
3 chances per day per character plus trading subs. Easy to get new stuff if you want it.
---
luck, trading. traded a suit for the medic machine yesterday.
---
Exactly!  One of my friends got the helmet and the signs plans on the same run.   I’m beginning to think that there’s a glitch keeping me from getting any rare rewards.  If we consider only the elder rank at an 80% chance of receiving a rare reward it means we have a 20% chance of not receiving one.  That means that for three days straight it would be .20 ^ 3 = 0.008 probability of not receding anything.  Anyway, I see that I’m not the only one, so maybe it’s not a glitch but just horrible luck.
---
I changed all the locks in my house to level 0 for that subtle troll.
---
So people are purposely tanking the event 2 get all 3 teirs separately instead of getting elder first?
---
Cuz I've gotten elder all 3 days and only got 2 vally signs
---
Understandable, but you got people like me that can still use the armor. SS armor is no small amount of gold required.
---
When  you get top tier it also rolls the chances beneath it, so 3 rewards are possible, as are none..
---
All my camp locks are level 0 now.
---
I haven’t gotten a single plan yet. Feels bad.
---
" Yeah, that's the POINT of a FALLOUT GAME. Legitimate threats are  supposed to be a possibility around every corner. It's a  post-apocalyptic wasteland, not a walk in the park. "
---
Fallout game maps have always been a pleasure, with danger around every corner. 
---
Fallout 76 has become a chore, with "danger" every five feet. I put danger in quotation marks because bullet sponge enemies aren't dangerous, they are tedious and boring.
---
Thanks a ton!
---
Wall decor ...
---
I'm level 98 and I'm struggling! 
---
I used to go to the Forest or Divide and collect materials for ammo and so on to then battle my way through the east side. I could spend a bit of time working on my build but I have one that does what I want. I get that a lot of people are in end game mode and they want to keep players playing but it is making it tough for someone who wants to explore to not feel the need to grind out materials.
---
Thanks!
---
I never said enemies were a bullet sponge with a Bloodied build, I'm saying they are without it
---
Same character, options on what I want to use on a given day. Junkies on day, Berserkers the next.
---
I used to run instigating full health sniper. I found it too weak long before the patch. Honestly I’ve stuck with anti armor for more than a year and it fits into most builds decently. I use it on heavy pa, commando, and unarmed, with the exception of starting with instigating on my unarmed build.
---
...but killing random people... isssss fine? Aaaaaaand you’re boycotting the animal slaughter of fake... animals? Sounds about white. I mean right. Sounds about right.
---
I always make sure I have a zealots weapon on me it does 30% more damage to scorched. Also sit back and do some sneak damage with that rifle.
---

---
Burrows signs and Super reactor yesterday
---
Edit-separate runs. Not the same op
---
If you have the zoom lens for your camera you can actually take the picture from the spawn point
---
I don't agree with those who only enjoy the "chill nature" of the game. Go play Animal Crossing then. This is a fucking wasteland survival game, and it hasn't been survival for a long ass time since they removed open world PVP. Now it's survival, now it's threatening, now it's an actual post apocalyptic game. This is how the game is meant to be. 
---
And I don't understand, what "chill nature"? You can set your camp up there is no mobs and farm till your heart is content, you can join groups and port into events and Daily OPs. You can play this game without touching the rest of the world now. There is still chill nature, people just whine because they can't walk anywhere in the world now freely with no threat or danger. That's not how Fallout is played, sorry buckaroo.
---
RIGHT ON SISTAH!
---
Charisma.  It increases the positive benefits of all your mutations by 25%, only one perk point
---
I know, love them, but changing cards for the Melee one on day one I am saving up for SS armor now. I switched to my x01 and a ldeathclaw gauntlet but still sucked I felt so bad bc I'm built for stealth
---
They'll be common as muck in 2 weeks, like Earle rewards, dont sweat it :-)
---
I just wanna know what all the conference rooms and ballrooms got going on tbh.
---
Me too,  sometimes when I die and try to take the goo it won't let me until a few mins later. Instead,  if you just shoot a bullet and then take it , it will give the rads
---
Me personally I'm loving it. I'll see first hand this weekend when my father in law rolls out with his sub optimal build...... O_o
---
BGS has a track record of over nerfing. I had hoped they would rebalance weapons before dropping the damage calculation change. I'm guessing there are a large percentage of optimized players in the PTS so they had little feedback on how this would effect non optimized builds. Bad thing is they are likely busy trying to get upcoming content to work properly so it might be awhile before we see any rebalancing.
---
I've been doing them in 6-7 min with just 2 people, and they seem fine, barre the no rewards from elder people get. A guaranteed legendary, stuff like Ult Cores, and possible scrips/caps is one of the best things in the game in terms of reward structure.
---
Yeah and I want raider radio from Fo4 nuka world back, rose just sucks
---
No.
---
Every day you get three chances to get a rare reward per character. If you get elder on your first go then all three reward tiers are unlocked at the same time. It's 3 separate chances regardless of how many attempts it takes, meaning it's possible to get three rewards from one completion. Initiate has a 5% chance, Paladin is 10% and Elder is 80%.
---
Think of it like opening three different loot boxes.
---
Never said it was a bad game, I'm saying it's going in a direction I don't like and people shouldn't turn a blind eye to things that are happening because of fanboying. If people are enjoying it, genuinely, that's one thing and I respect their opinion, but people fanboy Bethesda all the time
---
I have a simaler build to you and am using bloodied explosive weapons what's my problem then
---
Yeah my wife got mad because she was on a quest alone and dumped nearly all of her ammo (about 600 shotgun shells in an instigater shotgun) and the reward was measly.
---
I launched a nuke today on a full server while playing with friends. I thought people would show up to the queen, but it was just me and my friends. One other person showed up late and we gave up when we mutated her with only 10ish minutes left. Launching nukes is pointless and a waste of time/ammo now.
---
you get any armor you've unlocked, so you can get SS drops too
---
If things improve I'll probably come back, I'm just tired of grinding for things only for them to be nerfed
---
Its already been confirmed that mischief night won't be returning this year.
---
its possible to get 3 rare rewards in a day
---
rng is gonna rng
---
Dude you get the tato salad recipe and us carnivores get nothing new. THAT is offensive. If you wont be participating I'll dedicate every single virtual animal I slaughter to you, Meat Week or not.
---
I'm glad you're enjoying it, truly. (No sarcasm)
---
My favorite is The Shinning easter egg at the Torrance House (of course lol) down by the Riverside Manor. You can find a red tricycle there with blocks that spell out “REDRUM”
---
read the post in the link
---
It doesn't protect against explosives sadly.
---
I mean Mischief Night isn't on it, which was confirmed earlier not to be reappearing, but theres a new event called "Bombs Drop" that is taking place when Mischief Night probably would have.
---
A enclave radio channel would also be nice like in fallout 3 Vote for Eden mk2 ☝️
---
Ha, if i am stood up i get 98 damage torso shot, damage card says 138, sneak nets me about 150-170 because of adrenaline, in vats sneak bonus will not proc but still the same numbers downsights with sneak proc'ing
---
I wish she'd stop talking over the music.
---
I view the normalisation of viewing animals as commodities to be exploited for resources the same as I would an in-game event about hunting black NPCs.
---
Tested it and it had had no effect on explosives. Fire proof is better
---
Woah. I guess they spared bows? You're the first person I've seen saying bows are viable after patch
---
If you have a house and you need to change it’s frame to make more precise future improvements then it’s impossible to keep the previous improvements you’ve applied to the old frame.
---
They did not directly nerf weapons. They changed the damage calculations so it’s more manageable.
---
In the end the reduced damage does nothing much. I still kill stuff In 1 to 3 hits and that’s including lvl 100 super mutants.
---
The extra intelligence one because my character was a dumbass but now he went to college.
---
😂😂 wack
---
Same. Radiation Rumble spawned me in some stupid tube thing and I couldn't get out. Couldn't fast travel either. Waited till everyone finished the event, got my rewards, had to log out and change servers.
---
For full health, what rads is awesome, no rad away, no shower, ditch some perks... :-)
---
Perhaps how long you can survive or how much damage you take. A scoreboard for killing enemies, maybe. I’m not sure what exactly would be best, but encouraging speed for build with slow rates of fire and stealth isn’t going to help those builds.
---
Damage formula for energy weapons has been fixed. The bonus damage from perks works correctly now and AA effects are calculated properly as well.
---
No - if you hit 8 mins first try you get all of your “rolls” done in a single event - you don’t lose out on anything ...
---
I was wondering about this. It seemed like it was doing nothing for my sniper character, I thought it was just totally broken.
---
Ebestos lining on leather chest makes u immune to all fire damage too.
---
The globe that shows where the bombs went off? I got that a while  ago and it also dissapeared and now is in a separate bundle you have to pay for.
---
I’ve had this problem in other games. It’s always my audio driver. I use DriverEasy to manage all my drivers so whenever I’ve got this issue, i go and check and there’s ALWAYS a new audio driver update.
---
Aquaboy/aquagirl are the problem. It’s bugged. I have tried to drink it at different time and it doesn’t work
---
There is absolutely progress. Now your perk loadout and gear is more important than before. Your character level isnt the only thing to be concerned with anymore. If you are level 20 with base gear and getting wrecked but then go out and get some legendaries those enemies are still going to be the same level 20s as before.
---
If this was how the game was released, no one would be complaining about it being too hard. It's just the whiplash of going from easy to more difficult. It's just going to take getting used to. 
---
Or quit it doesn't really matter.
---
😈
---
Very much doubt it'll be a caps purchase unfortunately
---
Not that I can think of no
---
I did campfire tales and swear to god there were over 100 stingwings. Those fuckers need to STOP. My flamer ammo can't handle that abuse.
---
Played from BETA too, and I'm enjoying it even more than before. Yes, enemies are harder, but at level 400 it's a welcome change than strolling in to Blackwater mine, shooting everything once, gathering all the junk and weapons, waddling out to cook the meat, scrap the junk, and sell the weapons at Whitesprings station. I'm not a bloodied build, started as a purely melee character, and have moved more towards a shotgun build lately. I am a casual gamer in that I'm here to have fun, not dominate the map with god roll items. The patch 22 update has made my experience a lot more fun, I'm sorry you feel the game has been broken to the point you're calling it quits.
---
I assume it is once per day, PER Character, correct?  I am going to test rn ...
---
True that.  I need to figure out my protection as well.  In daily ops I’ve been getting slammed.  I do bloodied (20%) ...  but I’m running full SS unyielding, have Evasive, Dodgy, Blocker, Barbarian, Bullet Shield all maxed ... plus Action Boy 3 and 1 level of Grim Reaper’s Sprint to keep the AP flowing for dodgy
---
And I’m still taking pretty big hits and going down super often.   (Doesn’t help that Healing Factor appears broken currently). 
---
Considering putting on 1 level of born survivor and keeping a large supply of stim packs on me so that anytime I get hit it goes off.  But I’d rather just not take so big of hits :)
---
Big true
---
Seems fair.
---
I would like also see mutation where you need to criple all limbs before you can finish enemy. VATS players could shine there.
---
I have the opposite problem. I can't find people to run the ops.
---
If you need rads just use a gamma gun
---
Yeah, very disappointing w/the new direction.  What games are you considering?  Anything Zenimax is off the table given principle and all, even ES6.  Odd considering that I cashed-in 3 days vacation for the Skyrim release.
---
I'm currently downloading Conan to give it a whirl this weekend.
---
Electrical Absorption. Assaultron's are my favourite kind of stimpak now.
---
+1 feature = +5 bugs
---
Yes exactly! I know for 100% fact I had it, even have screenshots of it in my camp. Now it is totally gone. I can’t remember if they gave it for free or I paid for it, either way it’s a serious bummer!!!
---
They sure patched out that weight bench within hours though.
---
I actually started a new guy who's been using exclusively pipe pistol weapons(level15 so far), might be cheeky and use hand to hand boxing glove as a backup build.
---
I got elder on my first attempt today and unlocked the outfit and mask
---
I like the changes in some aspects, but not over the whole map.  I have.a stealth suit rifle build, and enjoyed frolicking thru the forrest foraging and hunting.  Now everything is amplified, I'm not so happy with the survival only game it's become.  Some days I want unload a crap ton of bullets.  Some days I want sneak and hunt. I'm playing it less now, we'll see, maybe it's time to try some other games.
---
Probably because stealth at the goal point would be less than challenging.
---
Is it reasonable to use mutations without starched genes? I guess i have more to look into.
---
Shame this nerf hit early game players the hardest... Then every rifle, pistol and melee build!
---
Yea it was one of the first free camp items they put on the atom shop, then yanked it away and put it in a bundle.
---
I love my little bloody sniper character, but got damn... My ammos is expensive as shit to make and I have to shoot enemies at least twice with a gun that takes 4 years to reload and only holds like 5 bullets at a time.
---
Lol her gear and weapon have to suck for a rad roach to kill her.
---
I put rank 1 survival shortcut on, that pretty handy also
---
Junkie’s is superior but people play berserker for the challenge? I dunno just speculating.
---
First time I did the uplink with the robots, we missed the Elder time buy 39 seconds. The leader of the team kicked me and then sent a message blaming me for missing it because I was too far away from the zone for about twenty seconds.
---
I’ll be honest the robots in daily ops are somewhat problematic for me but the blood eagles are so squishy
---
Me: "what assaultron, oh, that one"
---
Also me on day 1: So anyway I started blasting *busts out my Vampire Prime Gatling Laser to it's face in PA*
---
That honestly seems like the best possible solution.
---
They should add another radio station that only plays music like the Mojave Music Radio.
---
I’m a heavy gunner and I picked up a I5025 railway rifle and used it for a second just for fun, it was actually killing level 75 mole miners in 5 shots which surmised me. Probably 2-3 with perks and/or better legendary rolls
---
Yeah, it kinda sucks. No more low level 3* items from forest hordes either.
---
Hah that's fucking criminal smh
---
Ok, my medic build
---
10 Str, 15 Cha. Just hit 120 with him.   He has 2 Shotgunner perk cards at 3\* and one at 2\*.  He also has every mutation minus herbivore (I always find it easier to just get all of them free).  His weapon is a two shot combat shotgun, also with the +10% damage when aiming.  Only a 2\* Weapon.  His armor includes a cloaking chest piece.  Other pieces like ghoul slayers.  I even double checked, no magic weapons or magic armor.
---
Enemies in the forest, ash heap, and toxic valley all go down with a single point blank shotgun blast to the head.  Ghouls at Fort defiance take 2, sometimes 3 shots to down.  Is that a bullet sponge?  3 shots with a crap build?
---
How about my unarmed build, people complained unarmed was nerfed to hell right?
---
He‘s a full heal build using an unstoppable monster, so he only sees any extra damage when he’s desperate.  He hits the level 60 scorched outside fort defiance for 188 damage, twice that if I do a head shot.  Two hits to kill.  Level 100 super mutants at west tek take 143 if I’m not aiming for the head, worst case \*maybe\* 4 hits to kill them.
---
Should these characters be considering it bullet sponges?  How does it explain that my bloodied build minus an actual bloodied weapon is able to do fine with 2 shots?  Mutants is only give 10% damage from the weapons base damage.   Is adrenal reaction THAT amazing.  How is my medic doing fine.  I’m one shooting things. Is TS/+10% also a magic weapon?  How does that explain my non-vats damage then?
---
This happens to me super often. I have to relaunch the game a few times. The game also attempts to minimize constantly. I usually have to let it load in the background until I hear the menu screen music, then alt-tab back in.
---
simp-o-matic 😂
---
Yeah. I dislike high levels just eating legendaries like snacks and not sharing with everyone
---
How hard is it to hit elder?
---
I heard it's bugged to where nobody's getting rare rewards after hitting elder.
---
Wow, you got really fucking butthurt over this.
---
Geez I struggle to get one even with the elder rank
---
A lot of casual players were hit hard by the nerf so they are trying to sort out how to cope with the changes. The players who weren't hit hard by the changes have likely killed the queen quite a bit and already have all of the earl rewards. Dont get too excited things will get back to normal at some point.
---
They're not debating you.  Period.  The "testing" you're talking about is just fucking examples they put in the post as a tl;dr for people.  Click the link, set  the values to whatever you would get for Junkies yourself.  Done.
---
Drop the conversation.
---
three days is more than enough time to be able to pay attention to the fucking game, especially when it literally tells you what to do.
---
Survival shortcut perk, health food water and disease cure you carry around, no need for that thing
---
Unintended consequence- if you haven’t already done it the “kill enemies with musical instruments” or “kill enemies with railways rifles” are gonna be a lot harder if you aren’t built for those styles.
---
You are as well , you get perks/chems/mods/etc.
---
You are constantly getting more synergy as you level up and can stack things, you are talking about hypotheticals the fact is if you get good mods on your armor and weapons you will be much stronger  than your enemies.
---
Also events guarantee you a legendary for your level so it will be good to go there and get some decent weapons.
---
Do the turrets still shoot at each other and/or you? :D
---
Be me: lv 135 or so. Still not having any quality weapons.
---
Luckily Heavy Gunner wasn't hit as hard so my gatlings do decent damage overall still, but this patch really went after the op builds, yet destroyed basically everybody else instead.
---
I disagree. I like that we travel to player houses to see what they are selling. I like designing my own and having players drop by. An auction house would kill anybody ever visiting anyone.
---
I've gotten the Elder tier all three days so far but still haven't gotten a single rare item. Bummer.
---
u/ladydevann is this true?
---
where do i obtain this
---
If you do it right, you don't have to go further than the first hallway.
---
Feral ghoul personality please.
---
I’m willing to team up! I’m mainly in 7am-10am EST :) I need my back to back Daily Ops fix. I’m on Xbox and would be happy to send you my gamertag if you’re on Xbox as well.
---
But human flesh is meat - and it does not require the slaughter of 'cute' and 'fluffy' animals....
---
See that’s weird. My wife was complaining about everything being a bullet sponge, but she’s been getting some decent 3 star legendaries. While not good for her build, they’re still worth 40 scrip (or she could player vendor them, but she refuses to play public) so she’s happy about that. 
---
And with me taking the ammo factory legendary perk and ranking it up once, neither of us want for ammo anymore. 
---
‘Eh, I guess just like every other update, there’s good and bad. Personally, I feel this one is more good than bad. I like having to plan and strategize my attack vs running in and one-shotting everything.
---
Three days is more than enough time to do a few OPs and understand what the fuck it is you need to do. Were you always the one who just fucked off to go do their own thing when they played an objective based multiplayer match on like halo or some shit? Did you never learn to play the fucking objective?
---
The super mutants were so far the hardest for my medic.  I rely on using him to heal my team, but if I get slowed down to much the animation is so slow, and if I’m stuck reloading my shotgun I can actually go down.
---
But even then, completed it with my buddy in 10 minutes.
---
I can understand putting it in a bundle for those who did not get it, but you can’t take it away from people who originally got it... that’s just crazy
---
Sub to my OnlyGhouls for 10 caps per month!
---
that's kinda what I meant. don't mean to be rude but prior to the nerf a lot of people spouted that X, Y or Z was 'op' and needed a nerf because reasons. but a lot of those people didn't really have all the facts and were met with a rude awakening once patch 22 hit.
---
to sneak properly you need 15 agility, a shielded raider underamor, bird bones and chameleon (the mutation). on top of sneak 3 and escape artist, of course. your armor needs to be either all unyielding or all chameleon. and secret service is absolutely awful for sneaking because it doesn't have a shadowed option. use muffled mods, too.
---
in regards to damage, I'm assuming based on your other post that you can see sneak multipliers are in fact triggering. they're just measly to the point covert op may not even be worth it anymore. are you bloodied? rifleman or commando?
---
semi rifles took a huge hit and are performing about the same as full autos, at a fraction of the dps. so no reason to be a rifleman anymore. are your damage perks in order? all 9 rifleman/commando? bloody mess, etc.? criticals are a lot more valuable now so you may want to invest in crit savvy, better crits and don't forget eagle eyes.
---
How about you just wait until we see what the event they are running this year is?  Jesus Christ why does everyone and their grandma need to chime in with how Bethesda fucked up Halloween before we even know what the fuck is actually happening,
---
Doesn't it store it, levelled up?
---
Agreed. I'd like to eventually be able to fast travel with 1 click.
---
Medic Machine? Like a vending machine for your CAMP?
---
I'm worried it's too good. People won't do world bosses or events hardly at all anymore, they'll just spam Daily OPs in a group, or solo if they're rocking a gatling or bloodied or explosive ewapon to just blow everything up. Why do anything other than Daily Ops if your goal is to get legendaries?
---
I do very much enjoy how fast you level compared to before, and not getting sub 45 legendaries, but it takes too much ammo as heavy now, even with AF at rank 3.
---
Yeah, that would be great... until you experience the lag caused by 75+ players on the same server.
---
I'm not sure about that. I thought it just gets rid of it and you have to level it again.
---
First time me and my friend did the daily ops it took us 9 min and I didn’t die once but my friend died to many times to count
---
I can't believe how many people are getting upset because they think you're serious.
---
And yet people still think it's wrong to eat another person, even if they're already dead. Absolute lunacy.
---
Dont think so, just costs 1 coin to uneqip
---
I have still a couple of combinations to try on throwaway PTS characters before I do anything on my main, but the one perk I'm pretty sure I'll take is the Survival Syringe one.
---
This way I'll be able to keep up the food and drink buffs without carrying food and water I don't need, and not waste the precious foods that I will carry for buff purposes just to clear the AP bar.
---
I also want to wait to see what the changes to the debuffs actually are, because depending on the outcomes it might lose half of its selling point.
---
If that happens AND I don't decide to go back to PA, I'll go SPE-IAL.
---
But i have an optimised build, bloodied stealth commando, and i am getting mobbed by everything, just been to Huntersville, not a particularly hard place with about six super mutants, first guy8 bullets and the dog nearly does me, walk up to the central part and by the time i have put four bullets in to one of them everyone is aware of me and shooting far faster than i can(auto non ffr handmade), bang dead again.
---
It really seems like i have about 10-1 damage ratio now whereas i spent months of really hard grind to push that to my favour.
---
No, you have to use starched Gene's, but the benefits definitely outweigh the drawbacks
---
Your best option would be to try to find one for trade. Second best option is to run the quest line on a alt. Second option may be a slog in light of recent changes.
---
I got nudged off it a few times by team mates in PA running nearby.
---
What about one of those pointy ones you could put through the roof to feed it in? I don't have the bunker so this might be an obviously bad suggestion - sorry if it is
---
Legit the problem I've been telling everyone. Daily OPs are way too good,too easy, too quick, too braindead, with too much return on ammo and stims. Why do anything else?
---
Luck. My commandos can now get better crits and more AP through grim reapers sprint
---
You seem to be like pseudo-poor man's Reaper from Overwatch.
---
I saw someone rock that for a whole Op and got really jealous.... then suddenly really missed that two shot ffr auto launcher I scripped all those months ago...
---
It doesn't, they deal slap damage
---
sympto-matic. it's a camp item, looks like one of those tubes that get your biometric data in silos. cures diseases.
---
Tried through the fan port area, but no go unfortunately.
---
Wait, what?  Pacifist mode means they can't hurt you, and you can't hurt them.
---
If you turn it off, you have to shoot each other. But if you accidentally shoot someone, they can kill you.
---
Raider armor still has no skins or unique variants. Not even the ghillie stuff from last season. At least the thorn/solar armor have unique paint jobs already that set them off
---
Same I use mutant and zealot weapons and random perks nothing really planned out and haven't had a real noticable change.
---
you mean in Daily Ops specifically or in general? I was most certainly getting stealth kills/bonuses when I was playing earlier
---
Well that kinda helps! Just too bad we can't move the coins around to other cards. I decked out my special stats but kinda wishing I would've tried a power armor build since my bloody rifles got nerfed big time.
---
Yeah I think I'll make a whole new post about the thing that's annoying me, good plan!  Then I can look toxic too.  You do realise all the swearing was just a parody of you, right?
---
Ah man, that sucks
---
Hahah this so much
---
You know, you get some ammo depending on what gun you have equipped from each enemy you or your teammates kill. You also get like around 300-400 for actually completing the Op. I go in with a gauss minigun and come out with more ammo than I had spent. Just dont forget to loot the bodies.
---
Edit: the same guy reported having spent 9 hours in there, so I guess you can stay in there forever
---
Yep. She’s not the best player, but who cares, right? She has fun with it. We have fun together! She refuses to play public server, so fear not; she won’t fuck up your game. And I guarantee you will never be invited to her private server. So you don’t have to worry about encountering someone whom you perceive to be inferior.
---
A friend and I ran some tests earlier.  The perks retain their levels if unequipped as far as we are aware.  But the perk coin costs would discourage constant swapping.
---
Slap damage hasn't been a thing for awhile, dude.
---
It was never free.  There was a bug that allowed some atom shop items to be built without owning them, in fact I believe they were able to be built before they were available in the atom shop. The deathclaw topiarys was another one. 
---
The globe was only available as a future-etc bundle exclusive.
---
No i havent yet should i?
---
You also can endlessly farm it for Exp,bullets,stim packs.
---
In fact it's kinda OP.
---
Whimsical.
---
Shows how much I PVP :-)
---
I got so close to soloing it today, just 7 secs late. It’s possible to do on your own but u just gotta know where to go and not DIE.
---
Nerf dropped. Rifleman weapons are a joke now
---
Are you sure you have it on? Pacifist mode should prevent your accidental shots from asking other players to pvp you.
---
 It does nothing not prevent pvp in workshops or in monster mash though... did you have a workshop owned?
---
Can you imagine the insane lag and how people would bitch cause they'd never be able to keep their camp in the same spot?
---
Dont need to waste a legendary perk on it if you've got the healy doo.  For me at least, these perks are fantastic.
---
Dodgy drains your AP, can't sprint or use vats. Sprinting is pretty important is daily ops. 
---
Empath is OP, if you're using class freak and you're on a team, the team damage reduction applies to you as well. Angry turtle has a video about it. He breaks down his test results in the description
---
Thanks for this.
---
Pacifist doesn't allow other players to kill you if you accidentally shoot them. 
---
There's more to this story, if i have to guess op was in a workshop.
---
Chill bud. Why everyone getting so worked up.
---
You been getting Ult cores from Ops? I know I was getting 2-4 every run, usually not even using 1 core per run and that got me up to 14 at one point.
---
Haha got the burrows / liquid courage double today!
---
Yes you right... but in general should be very plausible considering the ability to have 75+ players on a server is becoming the new standard with many games nowadays.. not only that but this is not even close to being a MMO when there is only 15-30 people per server.. my main point is that FO76 environment and game structure would do much more wonders for everyone if there were more people on a single server
---
Lol getting offended by a comment that isn't directed at you or your wife, ok bud.
---
Higher levels already have a significant advantage over low level players with available perks. That, would just make that divide even worse.
---
Regarding flamer they should rather change it based on what it degrades. Amount of fuel used sounds more logical for that kind of weapon.
---
&gt; I get that they're meant to be 'rare', but surely there's a better way of doing this?
---
Like what? You're already far more likely to get a "rare" reward than not get one if you finish a daily op with elder timing. It's been out for 3 days and people are already complaining about wanting it all now, jfc
---
I've noticed on pc that ppl do this erryday I've actually been playing way more on public servers lately and since one wasteland dropped it's been even better.
---
Essentially correct
---
So I'm not going insane.
---
I’m sure a lot of people would love that!
---
...
---
u/Valseek
---
In general, I've not gotten a sneak attack since the update, with any weapon type, against any enemy, vats or manual, hidden or caution. Even headshots aren't doing any extra damage, that sneak damage legendary perk has been a 100% waste of a slot....
---
Yeah, it's definitely worth it for all the benefits
---
Once you start the “claim” process, get next to the green barrier. As soon as it’s claimed, step over that green line
---
also i think it depends on the location of the daily op. i got the vault 94 jumpsuit yesterday and today i got the galeria signs today
---
Nerf guns and stealth at the same time. Nice.
---
Best way I’ve found is starting or joining a Daily Ops Public Team.
---
Take one for the team, hands down. If enemies are going to be targeting you regardless of stealth in daily ops, might as well turn up the heat on them.
---
Because reading them trying to explain this to you over and over and over is even managing to give me a headache.  You fail to grasp the basic concept of this thread and instead of listening just keep digging yourself deeper and deeper.  
---
They're not testing shit for you, they made a tool specifically so you can get off your lazy ass and go test it yourself.
---
If someone is going to literally camp for hours to kill me when I go to take a camp, they're welcome to my corpse. I don't bring junk to workshops. A whole lot of time for a whole lot of nothing. I won't even give them the satisfaction of a fight.
---
I was able to run power through the top by using one of the ceiling connectors that point down connected to a conduit that pointed up. It was fiddly but I got it to work.
---
I have rank 2 for testing, dont need to eat or drink anymore and no more diseases, try it.
---
Go vegan.
---
Im about 140 or so and i was using a vampire DCG
---
See I was trying that, but couldn’t get a wire through.
---
I don't see any of the new combat legendary perks cards useful.. to me at least. I already have a solid shotgun/heavy gun build, so I put 3 slots into boosting my special points and it feels amazing. 15 extra perks to assign. The other 3 legendary slots are mostly quality of life. Except for fire resist one. Even rank 1 pretty much saves you from fire zones inside Colossal Problem event.
---
You can buy 4 mods from the SS vendor
---
To be fair, that doesn't change what I said. Daily OPs are too easy to do, and therefore are way too efficient getting legendaries. Why run anything else, when you can load up a Daily OPs with a group that only needs ONE person with a great gun, and finish it, get loads of ammo and stims and experience, and resources, and nades, and aid items, and LEGENDARIES....in under 10 minutes? 
---
Why wait for a nuke silo, wait more time for Earle to open, spend the fifteen minute slog that fight is, or the same with Queen, when you can load up an OPs, get MORE REWARDS, in like..8-9 minutes?.
---
I'm not trying to play Dark Souls and think the entire time I'm playing. The game was too easy because people in multiplayer games try WAY too hard to optimize and its just sucks the fun out of nearly everything.
---
The same could be said for people who thought the game was too easy: "just make some adjustments for your build! just de-optimize your character and the game will be harder!"
---
Complaining that the game is too easy while playing a highly optimized build is so weird, like, you're making the game easier for yourself by optimizing everything to the nth degree. Why is it surprising that leveling up everything according to the meta makes things easy? No shit, it's the meta.
---
The vast majority of players just want to play the game and not have to stress about whether their character will be able to do literally *anything* without dieing. I can't do anything in Watoga anymore without wearing Chinese stealth armor and sneaking past everything or else I get laser'd to death by 7 robots. I literally can't engage without getting my shit pushed in.
---
I'm kind of just lost with what to do now as I haven't finished the main quest (the original one) yet and it feels like every quest since the update is just a slog.
---
I understand some people want the game harder but it's just straight up a different game now from when I started
---
Yeah, it makes the grind for a certain build/gear/weapons feel useless. What's the point for having any sort of build in this game if casuals are going to bitch about it being too OP and get it nerfed?
---
Ah, cool. Will look out for that one. Thanks!
---
I'm enjoying the difficulty boost along with the loot drop from enemies, I like that regardless of the region the challenge is up to my level, and it helps me improve my loadaout.
---
But so far no deathclaw made it close to me :/  
---
Also the daily ops are fun intense and short, a very cool coop idea!
---
Because everyone is laready in a group spamming them probably.
---
I ain't annoyed. I just say "Fuck" a lot. It's how I grew up. I don't even want much of the shit out of the ops other than the BOS suit.
---
I just switched to ultracite cores before I came into work. I was using regular cores and they were dropping random ammo. Your saying the mobs drop ultracite cores?
---
There are children in the Capital Wasteland that would swim through an ocean of irradiated Corvega spare parts to eat anything and they want all that perfectly good meat, to WASTE!
---
Smh won't anyone think of Three Dog's ancestors?
---
Doesn’t help when they kill you as it’s claiming sadly
---
Definitely I just need to unlock that next legendary perk slot and use it for charisma because I'm such a mooch lol. Side note I used two levels of the pa less ap while running card and I personally feel it was a waste. I thought hell less ap in pa might be nice but with the non-legendary perk power user I think it's the double fusion core perk is more than adequate.
---
You seem to underestimate how dumb people are when it comes to following objectives
---
Well I was bummed they ditched the. Yielding group - so maybe he/she was going for that vibe? Or waiting on a crew?  I don’t know.
---
Im playing battelfield 5, forza horizon 4 currently. I do have generation zero i play every now and then
---
Is that why half of my shots with a fly syringer at 90% vats chance didn't hit when I was farming HRF?
---
I still got like 22 hrf in the end from like 64 shots, but it could've been so much higher. ADS accuracy is just absolute butts with that mod.
---
Yeah, deathclaws can kill me before. Ain’t broke, don’t fix.
---
Yep. It's worth doing now. But I like Ops for the ammo and scrip it might give you.
---
Oh God, the last part where 3 waves of bugs spawn.  It was terrible.
---
Fair. I miss slap damage. It was taken away before I got hardcore into PvP things.
---
So I ran through WesTek using the Fixer and Combat Armor instead of my usual Chinese Stealth and Blade of Bastet.  Even with sub optimal commando, I went through the SMs like a hot knife through butter.  Every point I made was born out.
---
If you have the balls for it, maybe you should run it using only melee and see how it goes.  Let me know, I'd be curious to hear.
---
If you're on PS4 look out for me then, there's one for free in my vendor and no one seems to want it?! maybe they don't know what it is yet!!?
---
Oh wow, I never knew that they could kill you while it was claiming. I guess I’ve just gotten lucky in that aspect. I always get next to that green barrier and crouch with Chamaeleon.
---
I'm not really clear on the "defend this area" part of the event. It gives me a radius, and there's a progress bar. I pretty much just stand there and kill anything that moves, and the bar goes up. I'm not sure what the victory condition is though. Number of enemies killed? 
---
When activating the uplinks, what's working for me is to sprint to the quest marker, ignoring all enemies. I'll usually have enough time once I arrive to activate the thing before somebody shows up to hit and interrupt me. The jetpack helps, in some cases, since it lets me take a direct route while the enemies take the stairs.
---
I'm running what rads, electric absorption (pa), infiltration expert, and legendary luck/endurance to round out my build.  I plan to use funky duds for my last perk when I hit 300 to complete my ascension to immunity.
---
My mule uses the survival one though for reasons that should be apparent to anyone with a char that cant fight.  But my main is drowning in food, stims, and the like, and most diseases that I get dont matter to me, and benefit plague bearer.
---
Shouldn’t everyone be against fascism?
---
Workshops are PvP zones.
---
I was using my bloodied sledgehammer pretty efficiently against robots, however i can understand it must be harder for one handed builds and others who have much lower damage.
---
 So melee weapons and slower fire rate weapons need a little bit of a boost.
---
Wagyu Challie at Meat Week 2021 or riot
---
No
---
Nope. I’ve noticed 5mm I get a LOT of from them. Boss and reggies alike. Everything else I just get a hand full back.
---
Edit: Playful “Nope” FYI
---
That’s what a lot of people do but I don’t have perks/gear to do that :/
---
It just needs some adjust, esp. for mid game where enemies health increase by 3x the amount from the previous levels.
---
Agreed #Upvote
---
You know, maybe if you did not keep going after all those morally-loose ghouls, you would not keep getting all those diseases.....
---
Signs on Tuesday, nothing on Wednesday, the Super Reactor today.  
---
Random chance can be a bitch.
---
thanks :)
---
I see how Earl will become less popular, as people would generally run it for wendigo spawns scraps. The SBQ gives repair kits and a good amount of ultracite, so it will always be popular.
---
Craft some throwing knives to huck at enemies while you are reloading / cocking your hunting rifle, works like a charm.
---
Get and rank up the perks dodgy / ricochet / blocker / serendipity whenever you are able, they really help with tanking hits.
---
Don't bother with more than 1 point in each level of a damage perk. ie. 1\* rifleman, 1\* expert rifleman, 1\* master rifleman, more than that is overkill with the new damage formula released on Tuesday.
---
All I do is play the objective, all I am saying is to calm the fuck down dude.  In any FPS I play, I am the guy who purely plays the objective but then you know... I play games for fun and just want to play the game with other people who're also having fun.
---
This sort of toxicity just ruins the fun
---
I wonder if Field Surgeon maxed out applies to this or just normal stims...
---
I feel like they should make a perk card for ppl that's like the chicken hat in mgs phantom pains called OPAF.
---
Yes i have fully spec stealth com build, bloody mess, full unyeilding, secret service under armour(sheilded) even put more legend perks to up a few, full set of mutations, i get what your saying but i now do one tenth of what i did after investing six months and i am pissed, really pissed and will probs sell all my stuff(put it in vendor at an advertised price and get what ever some one decides to pay because that is what has happened. come on man 1 tenth of what i used to do against 4 times stronger enemies means xxxx amount of time i do not have for gaming, sneak bounes is advertised as 2.5 right, that is what i expect, when i put 138(base dmg) x 2.5 i get 345(no good at maths and use calc) i expect 345 not 180-188
---
Honestly wish servival mode was still a thing so people who enjoy pvp would leave me alone
---
Yeah I know that, the point I’m making is that it’s a weekly challenge but players are camping them so you can never claim them
---
I love this patch
---
I only use turrets if I am building close to known mob locations.  For example currently I am an Kanawha Cemetery.  But every now and then a random group of scorched or mutants spawn in just to attack your camp.
---
People have been yelling this since it first came out on the PTS. Don't get your hopes up.
---
Reduced exp. 
---
Its still broken tho for farming ammo and stimmys with a slight side of exp.
---
Me too!
---
Yeah, that card is bad.  If you use power armor consistently I recommend Electric absorption.  It has an unlisted effect of healing you when you get damaged by energy attacks, which essentially negates the damage.
---
This feature has been confirmed by Bethesda as intentional.
---
Hmm maybe you can then cheese the event to get infinite 5mms using a bloodied gatling gun build, just a thought
---
Finally someone said it. The game used to be so easy it was a joke, killing the final boss of the game in sub 30 seconds is not fun. I had so much ammo and stimpaks I was practically dropping them and skipping them because I couldn't carry anymore. The game is fun again, old events that were pointless becusse no one has fun killing level 5 ghouls are actually fun now.
---
Its guns for me. I had like a total of 50 to 60 repair kits. I'm down to like 20 something. Everything is breaking..
---
Went to start playing again today, put it down In January. Realized I had cancelled my FO1 as well and just looking at that $12.99/mo just changed my mind again.  I’m unsure what’ll happen to all my items I was able to hoard if I load my last save, so screw it.
---
I've been having this issue with my quad Tesla and all of my handmades.
---
No, every run completed gave the cores with the grenades/aid at the end. The only ammo I ever saw on mobs was just random stuff, not even .50 cal when I used a .50 cal.
---
I honestly don't know how people are getting the crazy ammo, cause I sure wasn't.
---
That's what I mean, the general idea is there, someone just needs to play around with the numbers a bit.
---
Okay good!  I am actually glad to be wrong about that lol
---
No, they give terrible xp. Even the colossus event is better, radiation rumble and guided meditation are the top tier group events. Otherwise clearing the enemies at seneca rocks/bog town blast events, monster mash or distant thunder are good quick solo xp if you don't want to grind whitespring golf club, west-tek and the burrows on repeat.
---
It’s part of the game.   Nothing I am a fan of but it’s still here.   I save the workshop claiming for the end of my play session.   As soon as my claim is complete I log off.
---
This is what i was trying to tell others when they said bethesda made everything harder to make it more "Grindy". 
---
We are gaining things faster than before. Things need to be adjusted like durability and damage on slower weapons, other than that the update is great.
---
Set yourself on fire with a molotov.
---
Unfortunately i'm not on PS4. I'm on xbox. Otherwise i'd dump my entire stack of caps and the stuff i got from Meat week
---
The problem with that is sometimes they have no clue about these things. I have taken over workshops on pug servers before and seen them somewhere in the workshop afterwards (I just ignored it and stole the power from it to power my power core generator because I couldnt delete it). A friend of mine claimed billings homestead workshop once planning to make a glue farm and had no idea there was an underground area with a ton of those built. He noticed the workshop budget was low after he claimed it and he called me over to see if I could figure out what was taking all the budget since I know a lot of the bugs in the game. It was not too difficult to spot the under map access bass and after explaining how that worked and using it I quickly say the problem. Sadly, I had to explain to him that there was no way to remove the machines and even destroying them would not free up the budget for his camp. He was saddened by that but I brought him onto my private server, gave him like 75 caps to claim the workshop on that server, and gave him a ton of my excess fertilizer so he could rebuild his glue farm (I even crafted some turrets and a generator for him so the camp had some protection because as a low-level char I did not think he had the plans/perks to do that). That is why it is impossible to say for sure if the person who actually owns the workshop placed those, especially on public servers.
---
The stimpack overload has definitely got worse haha. I checked inventory today + 70 stimpacks from 3 daily ops runs and + 40 to my super stim pool.
---
I was at about 10 diluted, so I must have used 30 to 40 of them throughout the day. Nuts!
---
I hope they become a banned topic, tbh.
---
I'm running a bloodied build with a FFR vampire weapon. It's doing okay.
---
'tis but an assaultron circuit board malfunction doesn't sound quite as catchy
---
I never had an optimized build, my perks were all over the place, I had no magic weapons and I could still one shot everything. The game was broken easy.
---
Reading doesn’t seem popular for a lot of players of this game.
---
I have a 3700x and a 2060, so i hope the fps loss isnt too big. This game still has a bunch of wacky bugs it seems.
---
None of them do unfortunately
---
Jetpack is the best. You'd be surprised how fun it can be.
---
Good for ammo. Bad for xp.
---
Thats a neat idea! Might try equipping that during the next op to see if it speeds up the diluted's healing
---
I've noticed this and health really seems to be rubber banding.   It used to bad on certain creatures, ie SB, but now it's worse.   There is nothing like unloading my Quad DB into something and watching it get healthier after a hit.
---
The Dream
---
I'm definitely for the update, and yes I'm a real person and not a bot. Maybe they should put that Captcha shit in lol *Select all images with crosswalks*
---
I have a vague sense that the balancing isn't finished. I feel there will be a slight up scaling, or rather there should be some.
---
I did Earle last night which I won't be doing again. Busted my gun badly and spent thousands of rounds on a mega sponge for basically 80 bullion and some screws.
---
However- God I love carving up strong critters across Appalachia and levelling *constantly*. One Wasteland--PERFECT. The change in DPS, I give a 3/5. We were all too strong. WAY too strong. Now I feel we are just a smidge underpowered. Just my take.
---
Overall happy with the direction though!
---
Yeah, everything feels way more legitimate to fight everywhere you go. Which, seems like the devs' obvious intention.
---
you're preaching to the choir, I'm pissed too. specially because other inherently multiplicative effects like instigating remain, well, multiplicative.
---
no reason for sneak multipliers, which are literally called multipliers, to become additive.
---
whats this about traveling to whitesprings
---
I don't have Unyielding armour and with 18 INT and no other buff than Inspirational, lv 100 Muties can give more than 300XP each.
---
Seeing how the Super mutants heavy places of the Toxic Valley are capped at lv 50 (with few exceptions) West-Tek is still king.
---
Yeeeeep. Shoot a dog 6 times, get 60 rounds. Seems to me (90% of the time) x10 for the 5mm return rate from enemies.
---
"a lot of you can act like nothing bad is happening"
---
OK, whatever this means, it sounds like sour grapes to me.
---
I've had 1 piece of armor break each day or so up from basically every piece when I didn't have WK. That perk is absolutely necessary, at least for the repair prices.
---
Hell, that luck perk that repairs armor is there if people really need it too.
---
It probably got taken out of the schedule because the pandemic has slowed everything down.
---
Still if someone kills you mid claim it gets annoying
---
Imagine turning up to work tomorrow and your boss saying for all of your hard work over the past six months we are going to reward you by paying you 90 percent less and oh by the way those boxes that you lift all day are now four to 6 times heavier, good on you son, hope you don't break your back!
---
Damn i pay for this too
---
Oh that explains it, Xbox owners are usually poorly raised :P :P sorry I'm contractually obliged
---
Yes he hasn't worked for me since the update, changed him to another ally and they work. Guess they broke Gramps again...
---
Sneak has been hit or miss for me. If your not running Tank killer give it and any armor penetration mods a go. Muffled and Shadowed mods on armor seem to have helped sneak for me some. A lot of times though it seems like I'm shooting a unsuppressed weapon even though it has a suppressor. You might also try removing your suppressor and putting it back on. This game has some crazy quirks sometimes. Watch some Angry Turtle  videos about sneak. Most things are trial and error. Experiment a little on some lesser mobs and see what works for you.
---
Agreed.
---
Which can be done with a casual build. There is no ‘intended’ way to play this game. Just because you believe that in order to play you have to be 100% combat orientated doesn’t make it so. I’ve played over 20 months with a casual build that I haven’t changed since lvl 70 I run with my QoL perks always active because I don’t want to be bothered to have to change them everytime I want to do something like pick a lock or make ammo, I don’t have any mutations and I never had a problem completing any task put in front of me until Tuesday.
---
nope lol
---
You mean like my unarmed build (which everyone says how much it’s been nerfed or whatever) that I’ve already been doing fine with and have been soloing daily ops? Or sure, maybe this weekend I’ll use some of my stored levels up on my unarmed character to take some gladiator perks and try it out.  I’m not going to use the god awful blade of Bastet, I’ll use an actual weapon that can be modded.  
---
I try a challenge, but not intentionally nerf myself
---
You in a team?
---
on an alt i got given a quest by the wanderer and i deleted her chair to see if i could get the weapon quest and now neither her nor gramps will give me a quest
---
I think the guns that use cores just get random ammo. It was the same with my Gatling Plasma. But when I used my Guass Shotty I was getting 3-12ish 2mm per kill and was one shotting them. So I was making hella 2mm back and that was ultracite 2mm as well.
---
In any game, restricted play (role play) makes gameplay difficult.
---
I would give you feedback, but you don't recognize me. ;)
---
Having a great time with it, having a hard time understanding the negativity since people running the same basic builds are fine. All I can think is that some people want a really easy game or min/max players are displeased at losing god mode.
---
I do fine at lvl 92 walking around with a pickaxe and a Gatling plasma i just change my perks when I switch out weapons.
---
I Don’t know anything about “builds” if I’m doing badly I just fiddle a bit with my perks and smash away. The only thing I really fear are mirelurk kings and fog crawlers lol.
---
My Minigun was getting 20-60 5mm per kill as well.
---
Hurry take this post down don't let Bethesda patch this!!
---
&gt;!(thats a joke btw)!&lt;
---
Casual doesn't have to mean easy. Casual just means you play less.
---
Ok brb
---
If you get "None" as your Elder reward 2 days in a row, that 80% chance becomes 100% on your next Elder result the following day.
---
It will stop these stupid losing streaks that I and many others have stumbled into.
---
or they could just buff single shot weapons so they're actually worth using.
---
The new terms prohibit posting "I will quit this game".
---
Thank you
---
I was just hoping someone had already done it to save us the resources!!
---
Yeah I was. Do they allow every member of the team to pick up the loot now as long as at least one person got a few shots in?
---
Yeah. I’ve learned to keep crouched. That way you aren’t on the map and they can’t see if your at the workshop.
---
Had that happen on the PTS, got two plans for the burrows sign set.
---
Here's the kicker: that is an extraordinarily "lucky" roll. AT BEST, you hit a 6% chance for one of the uncommon plans from your paladin drop and then a 9.6% chance for the same plan from your elder drop. Total of 0.576% for that to happen. AT WORST, you rolled a 4% chance for a rare drop from your paladin reward and .22% chance for that same item from your initiate reward, which has a staggering total chance of 0.0088%. 
---
By getting two plans for those light bulbs with a metal cage around them or the colossus ballsack juice, you could have unknowingly hit the rng jackpot required to get a red asylum outfit or god-roll fixer
---
What Rads followed by Master Infiltrator.
---
Those videos prove absolutely nothing. Poorly done.
---
Can you add some paragraphs to this? It's hard to follow a block of text.
---
Nah, I gotcha slick.🤙 But I did specify, too, so,😂
---
How do you do that gray box?
---
No. Seriously just stop. I now have to shoot a wolve 5 times with a level 50 *** railway rifle with all rifleman cards and tank killer. It's not well designed difficulty, it's a generic botched job.
---
I don't understand why they did not go the World Tier route from The Division where you can climb in difficulty progressively instead of mixing fresh 50 with 850 guys. 
---
Also, there's a brand new spawn of super mutants 50+ right inside my house (not camp, house) after this patch (never had one in months before).
---
There is a pirate costume in game from last year’s Mischief Night. You could probably find one by trading
---
Had one bad incident that resulted in a server crash yesterday.
---
I never one shotted anything, that's not the point. You're building up a stupid strawman. This patch is fucking up things for tons of people, but it's the lifers who are enjoying it. Feel free trying to keep this game around when they aren't able to keep new players.
---
It's the same old shit. Garys killing Garys.
---
This has been an issue for me for several weeks now. No AP at any point no matter which power armor I'm in. Permanently walking super slow since I'm over encumbered in PA anyways and the game thinks I also don't have AP. And I can't bash or jetpack :(
---
Edit: thank god I just found a fix. I had to get a completely fresh power armor chassis for both my PA's.  I realized neither of them had a core visually loaded into the back when I was using it!
---
Someone did the math on the front page and how there is a massive spike in enemy difficulty from level 20-30, including enemy healthy tripling at that point.
---
Tweaks to the scaling values for low levels and the dreaded level 20-40 zone a lot of players found difficult *before* One Wasteland without 100% optimised builds (mostly impossible to reach at those levels anyway) and are now really struggling with would be a start.
---
No clue. Could be your mutations, could be that you set some stuff up wrong, could be any number of things.
---
Morrat 100 does not appear in the forest. You can see that you haven't played the game.
---
(I think) He means that single shot weapons should be buffed to have a reasonable damage per second, not that we need to alter the fire rate of anything.
---
mine works fine, my dude.
---
&gt; Healing factor. 300% health regen when out of combat YESSS you will stop wasting resources to heal after every fight.
---
I never got the obsession with this mutation. I need healing when I'm \*in\* a fight, not after it's over.
---
I don’t think you understand how Pacifist works. Can you elaborate on your concerns?
---
If you have Pacifist on, then unless you pick a player owned lock or are in a workshop zone, other players can’t attack you and damage you. 
---
There is (unless it was fixed) one or two ‘glitches’ that can allow another player to damage you outside these parameters, but they take time.
---
My suggestions are (I love it too, but feel it needs some work):
---
1. Level cap trash mobs. I don't care if you're level 1 or level 1000, no one wants to fight a level 100 rad roach or mole rat.
---
2. Balance weapon base damage. Changing the multipliers is all well and good but it needs a balance pass and that should have been done before it went live. There's no reason a single shot rifle shouldn't be a viable build. Likewise it shouldn't take 5-6 hits to kill a wolf with a level 50 ski sword on an optimized build. 
---
3. Change the level scaling on characters less than level 50 to be more varied. A level 100 might see a level 50 or a level 100 enemy, but a level 30 only sees level 30. This sucks. They should see level 10 and level 40 enemies so there is some variety and it isn't grueling fighting all the time. By level 30 the forest should be easy so they are encouraged to move on to harder areas. Also, see number 1.
---
4. If you're going to buff enemies damage to camps, make defenses actually work. It's no fun repairing your camp every time you get home.
---
I just scanned the last 12 hours of posts, and only see about 10 that were deleted.  At least three of them look trading related, some may have been autobot removed for other reasons.   Given that and the plethora of discussions on dissatisfaction about the updates, seems lightly moderated.
---
There are too many stories of new-ish players hitting levels 20, 30 or so and they're getting slaughtered. There's no way to progress.
---
But go ahead and prance away in your dying game, you goof.
---
Are you serious?  They are all there.  Have you tried sorting by controversial for just today, every other post is a complaint or people talking about how they are quitting.  The third top post this morning was a bitch fest.
---
Hope you like playing on servers where you can’t place your camp. 😂
---
What builds do u recommend? (especially right now, when only certain builds are viable)
---
I finally got a rare reward today.
---
Try again. I got nothing yesterday and three rare plans today.
---
Gunslingers should break out the Gamma or a Plasma Pistol config’d for flamer for boss fights. 
---
Or a Tweaked Automated 10mm.
---
This has been happening with my raider punk since the update. If I delete his chair to get a different quest, he acts like he doesn't know me anymore. I had to replace him with Beckett and do that quest then put the punk back. He gave me a quest today.
---
That’s two more things than me though!  I haven’t gotten any incoming OR rare rewards for any of the three days.  Zero. That’s why I think there’s a glitch.
---
I agree but with the update (this post was before the update) these factories are almost entirely gone for the most part. I mainly change them to gamma rounds just to fuck with them lol
---
Have you tried bacon?

I mean it’s an mmo rpg game. Do you expect those types of games not to have micro transactions? Final Fantasy 14 didn’t release in a perfect state either, and now it’s considered the “wow killer” mmo. I commend Bethesda in taking up the challenge of making an MMO — though I did want to see the interplay Fallout mmo.
---
Tried a flamer and only got fuel half the time, 20-30 at that. Even after switching to my gatling, I still ended up getting like .44, .38., cells, etc.
---
Hell, I specifically went in with a vampire .50 cal MG and ended up switching cause not enough drops.
---
The only weapon I used that ended up getting net positive ammo from ops farming was a Ult Core Gatling. Maybe that was just trash luck, idk.
---
You mind if I stuff your corpse in one of those barrels at the bottom? I bet it’d make for a great reaction for those scavvers down at Emmett Disposal.
---
I kept each rifleman card at 1 and 3 ranks (same w/ commando) so I can swap later if I feel like it.
---
when my team was at 4 30~ timer at the end one of the mobs spawned inside the wall. It was impossible to kill so we left. 
---
It’s rare but I hate seeing something like this still happening.
---
You can't say "FIX THIS!" without stating what "this" is, and expect not to be laughed at or ignored. Plus they don't fucking read this shit man.
---
Hide in a corner with a stealth boy
---
Yet sadly, I win the jackpot when it matters least lolololol
---
And they break sooooo much faster because the durability goes down by hits, and not shots.
---
I searched "bloodied melee" hoping to find some good news or workarounds, but this just confirms my experience.
---
My formerly 1200+ damage bloodied super sledge now does 490 max. By comparison, a regular non-bloodied super sledge shows 408 damage.
---
82 bonus damage is all I'm getting from the bloodied legendary effect. Nerd rage, radicool and adrenal reaction are adding some damage to all melee weapons too. Is this worth doing anymore? Is instigating a better melee effect now?
---
My build is split between bloodied melee and commando. If it weren't for the carry weight hit I might be taking points out of strength right now.
---
What does it do?
---
With Class Freak 3, the reduction in Chem effects is negligible. With First Aid 3, it overcomes the negatives. 
---
So you get good healing in addition to faster non-combat healing.
---
If someone damages an enemy and even if someone else kills it as long as they where in your team you still get loog if your close enough.
---
Thats what I thought. So now I'm confused as to how joining a group solves the solo play problem.
---
My char is lvl 105 heavy gun, power armor, not bloodied. Still np with anything but king more locks. Maybe the mobs take a few more shots but I haven't noticed much. I do notice that some monsters give much more xp than before I was on for two hours and leveled twice yesterday. Over all I like the update.
---
Saves you stimpaks for when you need em
---
I wasn't around back then. Did they get rid of it because griefers were killing people through the slap damage?
---
Usually although sometimes its janky
---
Just highlight the text you want to hide, click the 3 dots next to the B icon on the bottom left of the textbox, choose the hazard icon , and&gt;!viola!!&lt;
---
Not all applicable fir every build
---
I'll have to test this in a few hours. I'll lyk my results. Couldnt run any more ops before I came into work.
---
There is a fountain next to the tennis courts, which heals you when you drink from it.
---
Yeah the post about low levels not enjoying the grind is mind boggling.
---
Kinda makes you question how video game companies get away with pay to win. No one wants to level up anymore, they just want to be war God from the get-go. I mean,  there's always Doom.
---
Yeah yeah I understand, you wasted all your resources already because of a super hard area. Well, if you don't think you can finish the fight proper, get out of there and start grinding the smaller enemies.
---
It gets old, when all I read is that the game is now too hard, or I don't want to grind for resources, I want everything in my stash already.
---
An aggro mechanic in this game that was better understood and usable would be great.
---
I think that the bar advances faster the more people are closer to the uplink to stop folks from activating it and trying to hide in a corner.
---
Yes it does
---
It's a terrible patch for anybody but the lifers who spend every moment with spreadsheets and calculating RNGs. That's not how most players want to play. The charm, the variation, the immersion, are all pretty much cratered with this patch. I wouldn't recommend it to a new player at this point, knowing they'll hit a goddamn wall pretty quickly where they cannot advance.
---
I liked the harder one better
---
I haven’t died, but that’s because I’m now permanently in power armour with a plasma caster. With One Wasteland, I feel like I’m needlessly crippling myself if I ever switch to a different style for a bit. Now, I love my plasma caster, but I never intended to use it all the time. That’s just boring. I miss being able to run around in the Forest with a trash rifle just to chill. That’s no longer a viable option.
---
Hoping your right though. I am getting 9 per craft tho so I'm not stressing it. Ran 4 pulls and had 36 Ultracite Cores.
---
I believe so. They were killing people without the other person engaging in PvP.
---
Shit like this happens when you grab the nerf hammer AND up the level of the mobs.
---
I sometimes can't believe this come from an AAA company, but then again what can you expect from the same company that ignores the feedback it gets.
---
But just to be clear, since I no longer have any toons below 200, I actually like the fact that I can now move across the map and get XP everywhere. The one thing that kills my fun is daily ops, and the idiots that preach "adapt".
---
Guess I cant do that on the ios app.
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯  
---
Thanks anyway!
---
May I ask how?Also play \~1-2 hours a day. Have been running 1-2 ops and completing the SCORE but I've only seen about 1-1.5 levels at around level 300. Is it unyielding/consume stacking and farming something?
---
Or, no need for survival shortcut
---
Let me know how it works out.
---
We're in the wasteland. Some of us don't play nice.
---
It's the super big reactor in the generators tab in your camp. Functionally the same as the regular fusion generator which is kind of sad since this thing is massive it should produce 300 energy
---
Sure, but your camp is easier
---
That makes perfect sense, this is the first time I have used the skin, I will try it, thank you
---
Two things all players are gonna need eventually Flux and Repair Kits. That coupled with the fact that the shiney newness of daily ops will wear off once everyone gets the rares they want. If anything kills the game it will be all the casuals that jump ship because it's too hard for them to keep up on resources. But if you think Daily Ops will be the final nail in the coffin keep posting BGS might hear your voice over all the other complaints this patch has recieved.
---
Well said, but the last time I tried to get anyone to even join the ops event no one seemed to give two shits to the wind.
---
 So it must just be just random encounters. Because I would at least like to give it a go once with a team. 
---
On another note I tried it on my own and I wasn't overly thrilled with the delayed response after knocking your enemies down and meleeing them, it was a bit of a joke, or I would end up stuck in vats and couldn't do shit to any enemies at all.
---
 In my opinion great effort, but I think I am going to pass on this, I have better things to do with my time, then grind this one out for now. The only thing I dislike is the fact that it is included as a daily, instead of it being separate. Way to controlling for my liking, I would like to go back to the way the game was in the beginning much better for game play. 
---
But nonetheless to each there own, this wasn't exactly what I expected, but if everyone else is enjoying it then I wish you all the best. We aren't always going to have the same tastes when it comes to Fallout 76. 
---
Off topic, I am also not overly thrilled with the rest of this update at all, it could  just be me getting used to the new system, but 3850hrs in and I am just  not  feeling it, I just like things to be consistent, and not a jump from the way it has been over the last two years, to a completely different playing mechanism.  On a positive note I found the Legendary perks to be interesting, but I am still playing around with it. That was something I think has been long overdue. 
---
Thanks for the strong feedback, I appreciate your help, I will see if I can't get a team involved, and intrested in doing this event, and I will mention this and see if we can't at least get it done in a timely manner. 
---
I wish you, and everyone all the best. 🙂
---
If those builds you mean are from the people who complain about the update being too hard, then those builds are not good.
---
Windingo has always been a easy kill like ghouls even before the update... 
---
Story telling is not ruined. In fact lower levels can now run missions without running into max level mobs then give up because their lvl 10 pea shooter can’t kill max lvl super mutants or other mobs.
---
If Beth wants to make a mission that’s hard they can do it even if these levels are changed. There is a big difference between a lvl 100 super mutant and earl even though they are the same level range.
---
I've also noticed crafting got better. I hardly lag as hard or often. Im also using a far inferior internet and srill notice smoother crafting ammo or cooking food
---
Oh yeah, I know what you’re talking about! It actually looks kinda cool lol
---
The best place for Flux isn't even nuking a boss zone iirc. Repair kits are a point i wasn't aware of, i forgot she even dropped those.
---
If only
---
Dodgy is awesome. I never struggle with it.
---
if you're not going to change the fire rate then logically you need to buff their damage.
---
the whole idea of single shot weapons is that they're supposed to be slow, but pack a punch. except they were never particularly 'punchy' and their dps suffered as a result.
---
now they're just useless because making sneak 'multipliers' additive was a massive D move.
---
personally I think bringing back the anti materiel rifle with a reasonable base damage, or a perk exclusive to riflemen that pierces damage reduction, would help a ton.
---
Hey man I’ll be on for a hour or two leveling up my low level third character if you want to join and I can try to answer your questions.
---
GT Rising Minotaur
---
Nope. Once you unlock the slot, it's unlocked account wide. Having a level 9 with rank 3 picklock is a nice QoL upgrade for the second time around.
---
I have fireproof and adamantium skeleton to stop blowing myself up.
---
I'm genuinely asking this question. What are you referring to that needs to be fixed? You failed to explain that. If you're going to bitch about it, at least explain why. 🤷
---
Good to know this is where the Fortnite kids went when 76 came on Game Pass
---
You have to say ur platform
---
Guessing the patch will make the Prime Cuts events a serious drag for most players. The Savage Divide event was already losing interest because it was kind of broken; now, the two lower level ones will be a headache.
---
I play stealth shotty/rifle and haven't had much problem. I'm not going around one-shotting everything anymore, but it's still viable. I had a fun time taking down the hermit crab, kiting him around the median barrier. It was nice not being able to kill him in 3 shots.
---
Survival Shortcut has been a game changer for me. I never have to carry food or drink ever again, I just inject myself with a syringe every 20 minutes (can't be very healthy, but I ain't complaining, lol).
---
Because
---
Grats! I got it last night! I'm yet to place it.
---
Really? Glad I didn’t wasted a slot on it then! Thanks!
---
Well even with the perks and the gear... if he’s sitting somewhere crouched watching me kill whatever mobs, and then claim it and then go crouch by the barrier... even with Chamaeleon he can still see me. I just think I’ve gotten lucky that nobody’s been camping a workshop when I’ve claimed them
---
Who gonna eat the meat? Graham! Who gonna eat the meat? Humans! Who not gonna eat the meat? Chally... and OP.
---
robots, resilient and the burrows is literally the hardest difficulty. and no, I don't think it's entirely random. I think robots/resilient is the default.
---
yesterday we got this combination again, and today just before the reset I jumped into an op to see what happened. guess what I got? robots/resilient in the burning mine.
---
personally I think they should just remove this awful trait altogether.
---
Wait...im really , REALLY confused..please 'splain again!
---
Not going to lie, a few hours into playing this update has made me want to not play the game anymore. And this was my most played game on PS4 (sad to admit that)
---
Yeah, levels are not comparable across creature types at all. A level 30 mirelurk king or queen is way more deadly than a level 100+ scorched. It definitely causes some pacing and narrative issues. Wonder why we need levels on enemies now at all after one wasteland.
---
Since you’ve tested it, what exactly does it do?  The card description doesn’t help much.
---
Sorry, I'm slow.  You built the jetpack on t65 torso? How, without the plan? Also, I though the only paint for t65 was camoflauge.
---
Yeah that’s about the answer I’d expect from Bethesda.
---
Shotgun is wildly fun. And with the perk that reduces carry weight 90% you can carry a gun made for any occasion.
---
Really?!
---
3 Elders over 3 days here, zero rares each day.
---
Just pretend they don’t exist. That’s what The devs do.
---
I tested a one star bloodied handmade with all rifle perks equipped and can kill daily ops enemies in three hits.
---
What’s the issue there? It’s not even a ‘good’ bloodied.
---
Hell, I came out of a daily op with more ammo than I went in with. My entire team did.
---
What are you doing different?
---
Meanwhile this is my 3rd day of Elder and not a single rare reward...
---
I can't believe it's Day 3 of the new update and people aren't absolutely perfect at a new game mode's new quest mechanics that they've never played before.
---
Yeah, 9/10 cores per craft is pretty insane with Power User. It's a real shame ammo caps at 999 per core, even if it has more than 100% power.
---
Good to know. Thanks 👍🏼🤘🏼
---
&gt; I know for a fact that with Fallout 3 onward, combat was always part of it no matter what. There was no way that you could completely combat it in all situations.
---
(Provides video evidence to the contrary)
---
Yeah, you're right, those videos I linked don't exist.
---
I think they were just stating that not everyone has to play "happy Funtime wasteland" some people want to play how they want. Raiders are set in stone lore in the Fallout universe.
---
Packet loss, ping tests to any server but the Amazon server you connect to for fo76 is kind of pointless.  Could be Amazon's fault but more likely a node in between you and their servers, do the same tests to the Amazon server you connect to and you'll likely find the problem.  Ping plotter is a pretty decent tool to use, just be aware some nodes block (or put on low priority) the type of pings, ping tests use so you might see problems that aren't actually a problem for game traffic.  Having said all that I haven't seen any server not responding problems but I am experiencing an unacceptable amount of latency at times.  I don't think its the connection, pings are good, its the just the server code being slow to respond.  The game just doesn't react like it should, this has always been a problem but seems more pronounced since U22.
---
hey, they left H'd and magic weapons in.
---
besides, legacy weapons suffered from the nerf, too. my flamer is dealing half the damage, if even that. gatling plasmas and laser rifles are just an extra layer of broken because splitters work the same as shotguns pre-'fix'/nerf.
---
fixing legacy weapons is not as easy as it sounds because of the engine and how explosions are coded. I'm the first to criticize Bethesda but even modders couldn't do it properly back in Fo4.
---
I have tested several rifles (four mules, 2800 pounds of armor and weapons) and the silenced instigating lever action rifle was the best "rifleman" weapon I could find. And I have an Instigating / bloodied / antiarmor version of every rifle in the game, and almost every weapon, to be honest, except the bear arm and the new gold bullion weapons. 
---
Gauss rifle is still bugged as shit. Numbers are great, but it doesn't perform well. 
---
Not using a silencer after this update is not option.
---
Look on the Teams menu, there's a Daily Ops team there. I've been joining that team, doing the op and leaving the team. Past two times, I've hit elder on the first try with it. I don't know if it's a dedicated thing, or a team someone has to create.
---
edit: It's a new team that you can create. I did learn that you need to actually wait for other people to show up in the op before you start it, but other people can join it when your op is already in progress. If you get kicked off, you get kicked out of the op.
---
Hey. I got that 2 today. And I traded my Bos Spec Ops outfit for a BSSS DCG. I see this all as an absolute win.
---
I discovered yesterday there is a button to toggle it to show everything or just stuff you can build, because I wanted to build the pumpkin stand and couldn't find it - it was on "only show stuff That can be built" mode
---
I’d like to, but how can I pretend when I’m sitting there trying to kill something that would have died in one or two hits before the patch and I watch someone melt it in less than a second with a broken weapon? I spent probably 1000 hours making these two characters.
---
Well not everbody wanted this i thought myself it was gna make everthing harder oddly enough im way less squishy than preupdate not that im complaining
---
This is a completely different fallout game its like comparing skyrim to eso single player to mmo its not for everybody that loved fallout
---
I just wish that instead of taking it out on players minding their own business the PvP players would join the Hunter/Hunted station
---
One piece of poisoners gives you 25 poison resistance.  All levels of funky duds gives 200.
---
I've run into wendigos before that took long range and point blank hardened hunting rifle shots and that wasn't the case, died twice by one of them. More to the point, what does the level number mean or tell me anymore if a different creature is exponentially harder to put down? There's always been differences, but a general idea could be had by their level, and the range was species specific.
---
I still run in head first smacking everything in my path. And thanks to the legendary perks I can kill 1 while killing the others around me. It became even more fun!
---
I thought the tesla guns were classified as heavy weapons?
---
I know they got their damage lowered but it really doesn’t matter because they still deal insane damage from broken demo expert scaling.
---
Would be easy with fireproof and blocker.
---
But this is an interesting direction.
---
Survive for a set amount of time and the longer you do the better rewards like elder, but like I said it would be too easy. Custom mobs would be better.
---
I got 3 rare plans. I got the new generator, the assault rifle and the vault 94 stash box plans from doing one daily op yesterday.
---
Throw Brain Soup in there as well.  The Brain Bombs are supposed to be better but I think they're a nuisance to make in comparison.
---
I was wondering how you raised the multiplier!
---
Those things are there because society got kicked hard in the nuts in late October, not because the game is meant to be Halloween-inspired. It’s just flavour.
---
Yeahp. I don't use it because I always keep 3 or 4 disease cures with me, and only use them for dysentery. The other ones... I just sleep them away.
---
These mechanics, sitting on top of a point for a certain amount of time, aren't that new if you've played literally any other game. Halo's invasion mode was literally just that, sit on a point and protect it with other people so that you can progress and win the match.
---
My ultracite core looked like it was 1250 with power user. It stayed at 999 for a moment. I assumed it was 1250 but now that I think about it it was prolly just a visual error. My Gatling Plasma didnt always display properly.
---
Hunter hunted sucks and I'm just stating that your response to someone literally just saying "it's a wasteland" which it is btw... really didn't need the response you gave. Stuff like that in the community is also the worst.
---
Fallout shelter was the shit man. So many different quests and stories, it was awesome for a mobile game
---
Lmfao, are you calling losing in NW griefing right now?
---
If someone joins the OP in the middle of the part with the progress bar it stops it from moving
---
i would buy the suit it from u if ur on pc
---
Solar panels are nice. Small footprint for 5 power. They'll definitely help out when I don't want to string power lines all over a workshop. Drop 2 on top of each extractor.
---
Dropping some feedback.
---
With bloody mess for example you have 0, 10, 20, 30 which correlates to no perks, rank 1, 2, 3 etc. Quick buttons for all these; example adrenaline not having a "0" to "unequip" would be handy. Obviously you can just set the value to 1 but the quick swap buttons are cool.
---
ok thanks heaps, so it was my fault the first time then lol
---
Thank you but I've got legacy exp vamp plasma and laser gatling lol
---
Me who has a shotgun build, and can still one shot enemies ._.
---
I’ll agree it was a little mean but I just didn’t like the “deal with it” vibe
---
Foodbuild lives matter.
---
The effects that cause magic damage are the same between shotguns and heavies. The only difference is that magic shotguns require VATS to work properly, and the heavies don't (they have a ROF requirement instead).
---
not all of them do. I think the gatling plasma doesn't. it's mainly broken because of the splitter. they're also nowhere near as powerful as magic or H weapons.
---
Then how about you make your own thread, instead of trying to hijack/put down other people's ideas to further your own agenda?
---
Just wait till you see some one with an explosive flamer. They make the Gatling plasmas look like a child’s toys. Nothing has fire resistance so it does ridiculous amounts of damage. With no spin up, no recoil and ridiculous accuracy for easy headshots.
---
Damn i need those.....
---
The shishkabob is a 1h melee wpn thatbyou can craft, and obtain legendary variants from drops.
---
The friendly fire perk is located in charisma
---
I ‘member some rumors about it.
---
The first video is a guy looking through a pip boy and the  third one is a guy playing the first 30 minutes of Fallout four.  That does not come close to disproving anything that I said.   The new vegas video  shows  a few minutes of a 30 plus  hour game. It's pretty ridiculous to suggest any of that disprove anything I said.
---
My camp is right near the whitesprings water fountain.
---
...still too much effort
---
who tf is julia
---
Never played Fortnite, buddy. I just miss when there was actually danger in the wasteland instead of being apart of the Sims apocalypse-lite.
---
I feel like being part of a team actually matters now. I’ve always thought it would be cool if you had different roles and supported each other, this isn’t quite the same but I still like that you can’t dominate solo
---
It’s not griefing if your playing NW
---
If you want someone from Bethesda to help, why not post on their forums or a ticket? If you tried those, your not going to get better response on reddit where your post will be forgotten in an hour
---
Enemies have different caps in different areas. All enemies cap at 50 in the forest
---
I'm not trying to argue with you I just call it how i see it. Your obiviously passionate about how you feel. Personally I have done a few queens since Tuesday with enough participants to get it done. Ive been killing the queen for two years now and will continue to, I'm sure others will too. Try to find some regulars to play with, randos are always hit or miss. At this point I'll just agree to disagree with you.
---
no, u get once chance at up to 3 a day (one for each completion tier)
---
Edit: did you men to type ment and fram
---
I think that was mostly rumors and of I remember correctly may have been mentioned as a possibility. There was never concrete confirmation that it was going to happen from bethesda
---
This. But you'll get more legendaries farming a place like West Tek than you will from daily ops. Still, it's a good source of free ammo if you're efficient with killing
---
Thought that was coming with Steel Dawn
---
It’s like telling the difference between a regular mob and a mini boss.
---
Windogos are like an elite version of ghouls. Their a bit stronger but still go down pretty fast.
---
If you see a lvl 100 ghoul and a lvl 100 mirelurk Queen. You should be able to tell which is stronger.
---
Each monster has a set of stats and different stat gains when they level.
---
These added levels adds more rewards such as more exp.
---
Same, says Atomic shop is currently down so might be related.
---
Between 10 water purifiers 2 garages a double set of resoucre extractors the jukebox and the small computer terminal and 4 vending machines i use 121 and there's some other odds and ends so i need at least 2 fusion generators
---
the best thing is to take the perk pts and move them to another slot.. then use that legend perk to replace the missing pts.
---
Yeah I’ve seen it a lot. Legacy weapons are everywhere because every time a new dupe comes out that’s what people dupe the most. I think it was a shitty thing to do nerfing everyone and not doing anything about magic or legacy first.
---
Jumped on for the first time in a couple of weeks yesterday.
---
Someone dropped a nuke on SBQ straight away.
---
Was as easy as before but all the enemies were higher level.
---
After regenerating she got melted next time she landed in seconds...those magic heavy weapons work better than my magic shotguns.
---
This is exactly what's going to happen.
---
I'll lyk my results in a few hours.
---
But you do have to deal with it though. Workshops are pvp. Not all players want to be only pve. Some have grown up with the story of Fallout and fallen in love with the idea of being a raider. Now they can. Who is anyone to tell them otherwise? 
---
If only people just dipped there toes in pvp purely just to defend themselves when they get attacked they would be surprised. Hint: Not every player who goes for workshops are quantum chugging Tesla fighters. Some are just players like you looking to do the same challenges. With a little research you can so easily defend against these players.
---
Even though I can kill deathclaws with ease, they still scare me cause they’re big, look like a dinosaur, and are fast
---
Yeah they needed to fix legacies first then magic weapons then do a balance rework.
---
They're hte start of series that show you can beat fallout 3- onward (except 76) WITHOUT COMBAT. COMPLETELY dispproving your point. You can't just go "hur dur I'm ignoring the evidence so I'm right" and act all smug about it. You're being an idiot. Stop being an idiot.  
---
Edit: just watched the F3 video...which shows the game at the end of the game with ZERO COMBAT STATS, Meaning it's not even the start of a series you can claim ignorance of and go "he might have failed later on dur", which makes your dismissal of it EVEN WORSE. YOU INTELLECTUALLY INEPT DICK
---
I have to say, you don't need all 9 damage perks. For example, my commando carries a lever action and NO rifleman perks, and it's still able to oneshoot many enemies. 
---
It is better to invest those points into perks like adrenaline and gun-fu.
---
From what I've seen all the tesla versions are considered rifles.
---
I drink your milkshake.... I drink it up!
---
No, but knowing how big the circle is and where the circle is requires you to have at least played it once or twice to get used to it. With the constantly spawning enemies from all sides, you can't always stare at the top right corner to see if you've exited the circle or not. And since the entire mode is brand new, people may not have a chance to play them as often as you think they should have and may not know the maps that well yet. Tonight could be hour 3 of the new update for some people.
---
Tesla rifle bug, spawn bugs, health rubber banding. There are tons more I just can’t think of right now
---
So say that
---
I still dare not to move points because update 23 may change again.
---
Get out my damn house kid
---
Aren't you the guy that encourages fire running on PC? You made posts on reddit telling people hwo to do it right?
---
You don't have to worry about loading a save. Character progress is persistent, and saves automatically. Anything stored in your scrap box will still be there. However, you will not be able to add to your scrap box until you resubscribe to Fallout 1st. I strongly advise against doing so. Obtaining materials is easy in this game. There's no need to pay a monthly subscription to stockpile materials.
---
&gt;  can beat fallout 3- onward (except 76) WITHOUT COMBAT. COMPLETELY dispproving your point.
---
Not a single one of those videos you posted shows anyone beating the game.
---
I can see that. If you can sneak, a silenced weapon is a must. Can't sneak in the uplink daily ops though, so I think Railway Rifle might be better in that setting.
---
Because the loudest part of fanbases are the folks who have “qualms” and that’s who the crowd follows
---
West tek and nuked white springs are still top for XP now that line in the sand is fixed
---
I had a player go AFK at one of my vending machines today for about an hour before I deleted the power cable. Then I went to put it back and my camp budget was full so I had to delete stuff out of my camp to put the wire back. Good times.
---
Yesterday I got The Gutter and Whistle in the Dark plans on the same run.
---
You have no melee weapons, your site is useless to me.
---
You should not be asking for something like this to cost money. This is a major change, if they intend of making money off of this than fuck bethesda
---
Well if players were to simply dip their toes in it wouldn’t help them much, you have to either commit or don’t. Almost all players run one build per character, so you have to be a PvP player or not
---
True, and like you said - the number becomes irrelevant, or worse, misleading. So capping everything at my level would adversely affect the originally intended pacing, especially for creatures that are not as tough at equivalent levels and would need to be 2x to be a challenge.
---
I like, but maybe make it so it ranges from .5 to 1.0 for forest, not just 1.0 for Crowns.
---
It's a compromise, for sure, and may help prevent the post lv 50 spike for these guys, where it will be farm lv 25~ guys in forest or suddenly face lv 50 everywhere else?
---
Just drop your gamer tag or send me an invite whenever
---
One wasteland has changed the way buffs are applied, instead of multiplicative, it’s now additive, so everyone is doing less damage in total. This hurts melee the most with how many buffs there are for melee damage, but everyone is affected.
---
Wow. That really sucked all the wind out of my sails. I was so excited...
---
We'll probably get to chase down mole miners for stupid mount plans and floater grenades instead.
---
Why did you delete the wire? Vending machines don't need power to be used.
---
Agreed. My TSE handmade is pretty useless now except for AoE damage in Daily OPs or other related activities I can add support to, while before I was slaughtering with it. That said my shotgunner build is still relevant and I swear to the bethesda overlords you better not fuck with that.
---
&gt;Full damage perk for your weapon, eg. Rifleman, commando, etc. All 9 levels, yes every bit counts.
---
This is not correct. You get better results by investing into Adrenaline, GunFu, etc. 
---
Check your numbers: I am sure you mean well, but 9 points of rifleman are a waste. Tank Killer? Sure. Tormentor? Maybe.
---
Yes, please! I'm sure that the nuke alert would eventually feel repetitive, too. But it would still be great if Julia reacted, even if only a little, to some of the things going on in the server.
---
100%. Rifleman is so weak now it’s depressing.
---
Not everyone that works on the game is qualified to fix bugs. That means if the only thing the game team is working on is bugs, anyone on the team that can’t fix bugs, would be basically sitting around doing nothing. 
---
Fixing bugs isn’t as easy or quick as people think. Go find a computer engineer and ask them about what it takes to fix bugs. 
---
It can take years to fix a bug. And not all things that happen are on Bethesda end. There’s factors that are out of their control. 
---
So if they just work on bugs and not new content, it’s going to kill the game.
---
But no one is really going to accept this. /shrug
---
Yes, but you'd need more characters level 50 or higher. It's once per day per character.
---
Don't know what moron downvoted this, it's literally once per character, per day. It's not account wide.
---
I personally ran it on 3 different characters on my main account and 2 different characters on my 2nd account.
---
I highly suspect that is planned for the Steel Dawn coming in the winter. In one form or another.
---
I soloed that with a bloodied melee build and got Paladin.   
---
And all ops opponents have see-through-stealth as default, iirc.
---
Dang. I was hoping that the diseases would be more worth it. Is the max damage the max diseases? Or does it max at like 5 diseases.
---
Of course this one is the poop knife.
---
i live on top of a hill just below the top of the world for the nuclear node, a deathclaw always spawn a few feet away but it was always low level sometimes has a chance to being legendary... now that one wasteland is up it just tanks 2 rocket launcher turrets just to get to my garden destroying it n eating my brahmin b4 dying lel...
---
Absolutely, why not get everything
---
Use the perk that reduces shotgun weight 90% and use them all. Health running low? Whip out the bloody. Mirelurk queen? Where's my bug gun. And so on.
---
I did vault 94 op last night with 3 ppl. A lvl 80+, me a lvl 131 with no sense of how to work a build and a lvl 14 just starting. We got Elder Rank first attempt. The burrows  ops was amazing. The harder the better. I think ppl just need to learn to adapt.
---
I find it pretty easy for such a large jump in the reward chance, and it's only going to get easier as people become more familiar with them.
---
The biggest shift to improve your score  is realizing the enemies other than the boss and his pack don't really mean anything.  You're just trying to stay on the point while the meter fills, then rush the boss down.  If you can tank or LOS the enemies you can just sit there and basically ignore them.
---
Tesla? Or gauss?
---
I am glad they made it unbuildable and I hope the economy recovers because having that much ammo up for sale made the prices drop a bit.
---
It’s animals fault for being filled with tasty delicious meats. 
---
All the meats.
---
Nice! And yes I traded my mask as well it's cool but the reclaimed deep mining gas mask is better since it uses an actual headlamp. Hate the pipboy light.
---
Yup.
---
They nerfed damage all across the board cause people one shotting Earl is hard to balance for.
---
Tesla rifle with the shotgun barrel.
---
I mean I didn't use a min-maxed character before this, I mainly use a VE Gatling Gun and a TSE .50 cal and things seem as hard to me as they were before One Wasteland.
---
Incorrect. I run what is considered a pve build. 
---
No quantums, No Assassin Sentinals. 
---
Maybe 1 in 20 encounters at a workshop are geared players. You don't need to fully commit. Just understand how it works and a few tweaks later and you'll be 1 step ahead of the majority of pve players regarding workshops and pvp. 
---
So next time someone shows you'll be more prepared. Because chances are they are just a pve player looking for score just like you.
---
I think they're actually stronger now tbh. Demo expert seems to be buffed and it's applying to legacies. 
---
Being an owner of legacies I don't mind but it is definitely unfair for others.
---
I noticed this as, without demo expert 4 I am hitting around 60 to 70% of a radiation rumbles ghoul hp per hit. It is 1 hit ko with demo expert on. These are all chest shots.
---
The damage difference between my junkies fixer and je laser is now even more laughable than ever. SB will die in .5 second while in the air from legacy still, while Fixer takes 5x longer than the 3 or so seconds it took before.
---
The best part of all this was my TSE shotgun was absolutely awesome again for the last month, until the last update, and I don't mind a challenge, but opp's it shits and giggles again. I would rather have things go back to the way they were before this update. Just saying, 10 to 15 × 2 = 20 to 30 shots to kill an enemy? Not very interesting to me, especially at level 500 including  all the  legendary perks and 3850 hrs in. Just saying. Not saying I want the capability to one shot everything, but come on now a waste of my time and ammo. 
---
I  wish you all the best!
---
I joined a rando today. Jumped in the first op right at the end, didn’t shoot a single round but got rewards. Felt bad so I jumped in again and he followed. A damn mutant hound was stuck in a wall until I blasted it out with a grenade, so the boss didn’t spawn right away. Ended in about 10 minutes. Gave a follow me sign and jumped back in again. Third one went smooth and we finished in under the 8 mins and got my first rare reward.

It's honestly armor for me, but weapons too.
---
It takes up less came budget than a fusion generator though regardless of its size I have enough to place a fusion generator and not a single wire more but with this large reactor I had enough room to place 3 pylons and all the wires for them so weird how Bethesda calculates camp budget utilization.
---
Sex. That’s how.
---
I would take a Deathclaw over a lvl 100 Assaultron any day! 😬
---
I figured it would bump him out of the menu
---
'the harder the better' is highly subjective. not to mention resilient isn't hard, there's nothing to adapt. it's just mashing the bash button if you're not a melee build. it exists solely to inconvenience the player and nothing else.
---
it's stupid and the opposite of good game design. like piercing gaze, regardless of how broken sneak might be in the daily ops.
---
For the fun of playing the game. I am happy with what I have received throughout my time playing. I’m sorry if you are not. Perhaps if you are unhappy with the game you should take a break or find another to play. I fail to see the logic in continuing to engage in something that you do not find enjoyable, fun and relaxing, but that is my personal opinion.
---
Might want to add what platform you're on bro.
---
i mean, people have actual lives outside of the video game...
---
Dodgy makes it hard to run, bad for people who like to sprint.
---
Full 9 damage perks aren't necessary for all weapons.
---
Bloody mess same thing.
---
Serendipity doesn't work in pa.
---
Concentrated fire is useless if you don't use vats
---
Tank killer is useless if you don't use a rifle or pistol.
---
Follow through is only useful if you use sneak
---
Eagle eyes is useless if you don't use criticals
---
It’s unfortunate. I think it’s a good change to the game that encourages team play, it’s just too bad that a lot of the player base wasn’t expecting that
---
Oh shit, I thought I did, sorry
---
Idk. They probably won't change it. If youre on a team you play for damage (team buffs, taking one for the team legendary perk). Whereas if you're solo you become tankier
---
Some of the events really aren't balanced with the new scaling system.  Swarm of Suitors can be kind of a pain in the ass too with level 100 mirelurks, they're not dangerous but they have a ton of health and they're all just charging the island.
---
Thank you for posting this and not just downvoting because you have a legacy that you don’t want nerfed.
---
&gt; Deathclaws always were scary to me, because **my build wasn't especially optimized**. Everyone that complained that the game was too easy had all the **tools they needed** to remedy that at any time they wished.
---
**You also had the "tools" at your disposal, you decided not to use them.** 
---
Same goes for everyone using unoptimized builds. We all started on equal ground. Some took the path of efficiency some didnt, but it was a choice. It's not something in the game that forced you to not optimize.
---
All these players who did not prioritize building for combat shouldnt be surprised now that they are severely lacking in the domain they decided to neglect. Especially now that the game is finally putting more emphasis on it.
---
I personally like the way it is now. I do have to heal more and my stuff seem to break faster yes, but im not facerolling everything one punching everything to death anymore for the most part and it also give me a reason to hang around what was previously lower levels areas and events.
---
Plague doc mask + Civil War Era Tophat + Hunters Long Coat
---
Deathblclaw mask + Science Scribe Outfit
---
Or when you cripple a sentrybot and it tries to WALK on its three little stubby legs, it looks so pathetic
---
If you're band new, I recommend searching for Fallout 76 builds to pick what you think you want at first.  The cards are random, so pick points that you want in the category that supports your build.  Try not to worry with the quality of the cards early because better ones come in time.  Some cards are higher level.   Pistols kinda stink, but good early on, so ok if you pick the pistol cards early on for the points in the right spot.  
---
Eventually, you'll want mutations too that help your build.  With mutations, you'll want Starched Genes card and Class Freak card.  If you see a serum at a player vender for about 400 caps, buy them and save the serums for when you have the cards.
---
Ditto shop was saying offline and my sub was renewing today and still hasn't updated yet.
---
You could always start the clear enemy combatants phase and have one spawn inside the wall and wait 3 minutes to teleport out so you miss Elder rating 🤷‍♂️
---
All I got on first run was the brotherhood mask or whatever it’s called.
---
I kind of expect we'll see an XP farm strategy form around radstag swarms now that they give decent XP due to level scaling.
---
It’s crazy how people are downvoting you..
---
I agree with you. It’s actually nicer now than before. I’m leveling up waaay faster now. Unintentionally.
---
I’m looking forward to taking some legendary stats to boost my damage output even more. I guess I’m technically a bloodied build but it’s more just a generic low health build.
---
Short answer is dmg got nerfed
---
Shady Sands or the Oil Rig pls Bethesda I beg you
---
I got the liquid courage recipe and I'm a tad disappointed by it.
---
Main reason is because they made it require a damn wendigo colossus vocal sac to brew just one. If they replaced it with a more easily obtainable ingredient such a wendigo teeth you'd see me brewing a bunch of them and distributing them to players in the waiting room for Earle.
---
I'm reworking my vats stealth rifleman points to make it viable.
---
I'm thinking of this legendary so I can get rid of the hiker perk card to reduce food weight and put the points into adrenaline or sandman for more damage.
---
Which rank should I aim for?  I'm level 350 and need to max out at least 2 cards for perks and ammo and stealth to.
---
Not sure if this is worth it if rank 1 or 2.  Would 1 potion every 30 minutes be enough?  Doesn't seem like ot
---
If you think I'm gonna go to my camp and check whether or not you're using my workbenches every single time I log out, you're an entitled prick. Access to other players' workbenches is a privilege, not your right. If you don't want to risk the game bugging out, don't use my workbenches.
---
There are official Bethesda employees that watch this forum.
---
For sale in the Atom Shop, of course. Working as intended!
---
This was great.
---
Can confirm, my IE laser rifle packs even more so a punch than before for some reason.
---
Sledgehammer plan is on the common droplist ::0

Finally Beth won't torture low level melee players by making one of the standard weapons' plans nearly unobtainable
---
\^
---
Hey, thanks for the support, glad someone understands. Sometimes it's hard to tell if the message you're trying to send is coming through clearly.
---
I made that post to give competition to the people who have a personal vendetta against me.
---
Look, I try not to, but I'm a Mele build and when the other people in my party aren't killing the fucking enemies I gotta move out of the zone to kill them or else I'll die
---
Then it's simple, don't put items than can be useful for others in the open, put them inside, locked, unaccessible so when your mom calls you out of the basement for dinner you will not screw up other players that just logged in and  perhaps are even helping you by buying your junk.
---
Well the least amount of moving of specials would involve going to heavy gunner. It is certainly holding out well at the moment. 
---
I’m enjoying a tanky bloodied commando in daily ops.... heavy and bolstering armor and a vampire explosive handmade and everig in front of me suddenly isn’t. I’ve heard the same is true of heavy builds.
---
Probably true on west tek
---
Lmao
---
All good man was just pointing it out for ya to help get replies, else people might have just kept scrolling.
---
I get what you mean, and species has always been a factor. Familiar with that from the past three titles. But exactly as you put it, wendigos SHOULD be the elite ghouls. At least the uncapped experience was before the patch, as compared to ghouls. I would go to Sons of Dane and snipe out the ghouls, then prepare for a good fight against the wendigo. This time it took nearly the same damage, or so subtly different (1 round) as to feel, from a narrative point of view, lacking.
---
Doesn't matter where I go. Everything is 50.
---
Wait, Earl, is that you? Are you tired of people nuking your cave in order to farm for screws?
---
Okay this one seems pretty promising
---
lol
---
I think it’s funny how people are so butthurt about the patch. It’s actually making the game more consistent and enjoyable.
---
Prime example of Ahole right here 👆
---
Meaning when a pack of molerats or rad roaches or dogs or whatever attacks, it eats up half my ammo.
---
Does the explosive effect kill you really easily?
---
Ninja is doing nothing at all.  My status says Hidden, but the damage multiplier never procs.  Not in daily ops either, just normal gameplay.  This is why melee builds feel so weak lately.  When you are missing 3x on your already nerfed damage, it stings.
---
Pretty sure the root cause of it is that stealth is broken.
---
Bethesda, Please fix this.  Its no wonder melee feels so shitty since the update.
---
I agree with this sentiment. I've even been doing daily ops with a decidedly non optimized character and it works, half-assedly, even solo.  
---
I am loving hearing the sound of liberators and knowing that they aren't a bunch of clowns I can kill with an unbonused hunting knife. Public events are actually not a snoozer where you afk for the reward!  I can't wait for fasnacht etc. now.
---
I was at a fellow's camp up in the mountains, enjoying the view from his patio and tinkering with stuff in my stash when all of a sudden POOF the camp vanishes, leaving me unsupported in midair at least twenty feet from the cliff edge.  It did not end well. :(
---
Argh what a pain in the ass, I'm yet to experience that one.
---
Ever heard of the scorchbeast queen my guy
---
Which would be completely understandable if they hadn't had five months to fix the issues before places (at least in NA) started shutting down and people started working from home. If the issues are severe enough for you to pull the content from the list of events you plan to use, you'd think that would be something addressed a bit earlier on.
---
Nah legendary perks boost damage plenty I mean atleast for me they do taking less damaging and faster AP regain is plenty for one perk card.
---
Switch out your melee perks with heavy gunner. Done. I can switch to melee and heavy gunner on the fly since my main was purely melee a long time ago.
---
My stats are 15 str 3 Per 12 end 6 cha 3 Agi 9 int and 8 luck. 
---
That changed now since I got a couple of legendary stat perks now.
---
Was not a fan, no sir.
---
It's been a year since I played, and I came back right before this update and they still haven't added any new face tats. Plus if you take out the rotating stuff it feels like they put a whole lot of nada in there. I agree the shop needs permanent additions as well as sales on more items like maybe repair kits... 
---
Side note: my build still works somehow
---
No it's my workbench and I have the right to do whatever I want with it
---
The laser ain't bad but the scattered plasma without pa is like insanely fast.
---
I play on Xbox and my camp has that skin and is waaay out of the way. I've had a friend join me at my camp and also sold a gun from my vendor to a random stranger so fast travel doesn't seem to be an issue. The one issue I've had is my ally is always hanging out at the corner of my build area, refusing to get close and half the time treats me as a visitor.
---
It's a skin. It should just be like wallpaper but for the C.A.M.P. device. Not something you have to set up at the Atom Shop and can't change after you set your camp down. Really dumb design, but looking at everything else Bethesda creates, not a big shock.
---
Its almost like people play casually and don't feel like spending all their free time trying to building up ammo and just want to play the game. Maybe some people played the game as a stress reliever and this update has ruined that by making it a lot more stressful for a lot of people.
---
I literally run a Commando build but use the guns mostly as single-shot snipers because it works better than an actual sniper build.
---
Exactly!
---
Lmao ik you're talking about my reply, but it's somehow more topical to apply it to your post. The only thing worse than an asshole like myself is a hypocritical asshole like yourself.
---
That and there like lvl 10
---
The only problem I have with the patch is how it made sneak rifleman useless.
---
try closing game
---
Ya sure user name is cagyleopard6462
---
I tried nothing
---
Yes, there’s like 3 community managers who browse here (in addition to other social media sites) mostly during standard business hours.  And their focus is going to be drawn more towards bigger issues that affect multiple people.  Your post will be long gone before they probably even see it, and they’ll still probably just ask you to open a ticket so you can email them evidence.  
---
Their support ticket process is still a better go-to
---
Sure but "Furniture Set" isn't exactly an extensive list of items included. If the pictures are going to be vague, the descriptions have to be on point.
---
Many of them. My B/25/250 handmade did a pretty consistent 1200 a shot in VATS to heads. Commando build meant with the ffr, i usually fired at least twice for 2400 dmg. 
---
I don't miss it. I died a few times today, it was fun.
---
That explains my once glorious 1500 dam bloodied deathclaw gauntlet build to being 400 dam now. That really sucks.
---
I have a BE gat plas and even with fireproof and pa I can kill myself easily.  Wish there was a way around it.
---
It gets better.  Nearly got eaten today by a pack of dogs, level 75 with their level 100 crown leader.  Had to jump off a cliff and swim for it :(
---
Heavy or shotgunner. No use swapping so many points if you don’t have to.

If I could upvote you twice I would!

Yes my gf and I play side by side on our xboxes and my gf gets terrible lag and I dont
---
Borderlands 2 had that common chest at Claptrap's Place. That's what every MMO needs. Accept that people play Multiple Characters. That's Good that is engagement. Encourage people to play your game.
---
Out of curiosity why is the case that single shot/rifle weapons have been hit harder than fast firing heavy weapons? I've heard others say it and I main two chars which funnily enough run those two exact builds and I can see the difference (barely notice much of a change with my heavy gunner tbh besides stronger enemies in the forest).
---
Yeah man, I've leveled up at least 9 times since the update.
---
It's only easy if you got optimized builds and the weapons that mesh will with such builds. For people who don't have good builds and weps it's really hard for them.
---
Atom shop is down for maintenance. I received the same message.
---
People with stupidly OP builds have simply had it too easy for too long and are now complaining that they actually have to work for a reward.
---
I think it’ll be good for when people stop by their camp but not worth it to travel all the way back just to cure a single disease. If you want to do that you could just go to whitespring
---
Dang do you know how long for
---
Ammo factory twice a year cause that's how often I'm crafting ammo now.
---
Only issue i have as a big guns build is certain ammo drops from enemies are way too small vs the ammo needed to keep the baddies away. I'm easily down a few thousand .308 rounds only halfway through a daily op. Each enemy only drops like 12 rounds and it's incredibly hard to keep up. I really don't want to make a bloodied build just to be like everyone else, but it feels more and more like the game is forcing me to over optimize and dump a bunch of hours either scavenging to make ammo that will be gone in one or two events or make a super precise build that is really good at one thing.
---
Throw in Mariposa while you're at it!
---
Go back to building your shitty vault
---
Yea even with pa its seconds
---
Changing it to additive would not explain why it isn't adding any damage at all.
---
The gatling has a remarkable ratio of effectiveness to ammo and is thus my favorite weapon. I can leave a daily op with far more ammo than I came in with.
---
How am I hypocritical, I keep my stuff locked up, I don't want anyone snooping around in my camp so I keep it locked, if you put your junk out in the open, expect people to come, if you feel "my camp my choice" but you put your shit out in the open then you're the hypocrite, and an ahole I might add.
---
I'm on xbox, but was wondering if there's a notification that the team has started.
---
Seriously though. You know that one dude. That one dude that runs around everywhere, taking all that damage from tapping the link or the boss? let's try to help them out eh? Heh, I remember joining a group with my buddies who went on the other teams in the area and kept spamming their team heal stimpack perk(forget what it is called) which they had purposely built up to be a healing class. using nothing but super stimpacks and the like. Got a lot of thumbs up and gifts from the other players, once they figured out that their health wasn't going down due to the constant "stimpack healing noise". On another battle, I decided to cut loose, my teammates each had 40-100 of those satellite grenades. They seemed to help a bit...though it was hard to see wtf was going on..I sincerely regret not having video of that.
---
TLDR: Don't be a douche and help out more with events.
---
EDIT: there are multiple reports of that vault being bugged, you are not the only ones.
---
Yes, that was the change. The only way it eats half your ammo is if your carrying 10 bullets or using the worst build possible
---
So that explains why I don't have the outfit....
---
It's not the Deathclaws, it's all the fluff that's now annoying. Radroaches are level 60 now. Random wandering robots are level 50. Everything requires more ammo. Everything hits harder. Everything requires more repair / crafting. Supplies didn't get buffed, so we're left with more maintenance and salvaging time, and less to actually play.
---
Yeah, but I see it as a balance for how strong they are.  Kills the sbq very quickly, but it'll kill you if you get too close.
---
All my atoms are now missing. 580 (paid for w/ fo1st) that I haven't used yet and they are gone. The 0 atoms is what made me check the shop and it's down.
---
It always regens if everyone dies.  If you are solo, welp... sucks but that's how it works.
---
Bottom left where the team members are. Next to the names it will say "(in daily ops)"
---
Honestly, even if they will add it, it will have not too much sense. Look - as they changed damage formula from multiplicative (dmg = base \* (mod1 \* mod2  \* ..modN)) to additive (dmg = base \* (mod1 + mod2 + ..modN)) -  most of damage in your damage output is getting from major prefixes like bloodied and you even can avoid using specified damage perks. That's because every damage perk is now adding only 20% of weapon's BASE damage (previously - it added x1.2 multiplier to other effects which was WAY WAY more). For example - you can avoid using unarmed dmg perk as bloodied prefix on 20% hp is adding +80% base damage plus 2 melee mutations are adding +50% base damage on top of it. On the only such passiveswe are getting +130% to base damage. Adding perk card will just add less than 1/6 of this bonuses and less than 1/11 of total damage output (For example - abstract bloodied weapon with 100 base damage will provide 230 dmg output with only mutations, 250 damage output with mutations + one 3-point perk and 290 dmg output with mutations + three 3-point perks. 60 damage for 9 perk points occupied. Not too much) but will occupy 3 perk points in your loadout which is totally inoptimal. They will not be able to add something like +100% dmg to lone wanderer (because it will be too OP and everyone will have to use it to stay competitive), but adding something like +20% dmg will just add a tiny tiny bit of damage to your damage output no matter which prefixes you using.
---
All I got was my ass kicked and couldn’t finish cause I ran out of ammo
---
Platform?
---
I’m down, add MtnBikingMike
---
Are you going to fix stealth first before this Op?
---
Xbox one.
---
I had this same thought recently and was playing unarmed bloody since start , I had all the gear I could've ever wanted so I didn't want to trash it , but I found from others that heavy gunner is almost speced the exact same as unarmed /melee bloodies so all you need to do it grab a suit of PA and switch a few perk cards and it becomes a 2 builds in 1 situations. 
---
Its really fun going from melee to spurting bullets like a madman. 
---
This situation is even more viable if you have (pc) perk loadout mod , a 2 second switch and jump into your power armour and bam different feel different style . Very fun 
---
In conclusion all the builds are super fun i still spend most time in my unarmed build but leaving it every once in awhile makes a massive difference to allow you to play however you want.  
---
I'd also say consider becoming junkie instead of bloodied for toon 2 because its a change and damage isn't everything.  Plus with a commando shoot1 or 2 more bullets it won't kill you and neither will anything else.
---
My secondary is stealth commando/ stealth sniper . Commando is x10 stronger easily . Its a lot of fun and these 3 seem to be the main meta builds for end game. 
---
I would almost recommend start a second character for commando because its so different it would take you so much time to move all the points from strength to perception and all the cards,  plus that would screw you with the legendary perk system.
---
Guess it was worth a shot. Haha
---
Imo poison and fire resistance are worth it and electric absorption if you use power armor
---
No my stuff is all good  my damage used to me about 700 now it's only 399
---
Wow a survival game actually feels like its a task to survive and not a game of wack a ghoul now? I feel so sorry for u. U just want to run around and not have to worry about being attacked by enemies? Go play another game
---
They nerfed everything.
---
I can’t remember if it maxes out at X diseases or if you max out how many diseases you can have. I couldn’t get more than three at a time anyways. I don’t know if being diseased actually makes it tougher to catch another or not. Overall a kindof disappointing mutation.
---
I disagree, only the early game is very hard in survival, if you min max your build like i do in there and know what gear/weapons you want to use from the get go and stick to them, survival stops being hard the moment your build is pieced together, which can happen relatively early enough if you know what to do, then its faceroll, at least for me.
---
With one wasteland its seems just a tiny but more difficult imo at least in term of damage received.
---
How lovely
---
Heavy gunner
---
Also if you're farming for the war glaive its not tradable to other characters so.. I hope you get it on the one you want because I didn't.
---
Yes but man it is going to take a while to get all 6 up to rank 4 along with having ammo factory at rank 4.  I have E at rank 4 A at rank 4 and Ammo at rank 4. If I got rid of every animated card I could maybe hit rank 3 on another. Quick head math with where I am will put me a bit over level 700 for all 7 cards to be maxed. So you know only 400 more levels...
---
Mine are gone too. 580 are missing which prompted me to check the atom shop, which is currently down for maintenance.
---
Yep, at 0 currently
---
No idea why, we'll see what happens
---
Edit: atomic shop offline, guessing that's why
---
What I don't get about this sub is that when I try and recommend or ask for some improvements on the PVP / Wanted system so it's more viable (fairly balanced mind you and pacifists still can't be touched, nor their camps) it gets downvoted into oblivion, because the argument is that other players don't want to be bothered by other players making their game harder or being attacked in general. They just want to explore and enjoy the game. (Yet don't want to put pacifist mode on)
---
But then those same players praise that weapons got nerfed and every enemy in the game is now level 50 or higher in all locations of the map, so you're constantly harassed everywhere you go and things are harder.
---
I figured one asshat from time to time you can kill, take their caps and perhaps their junk wouldn't be so bad, but having the entire map working against you is better?
---
I know because I typed "PVP" that means this will get downvoted, but that's ok. I'm used to it.
---
indeed, but melee got the short end of the stick.
---
Make the first 100, double each time you get one up to a max of 2000
---
While not the absolute best in terms of xp per minute when you factor in: greatly reduced weapon degradation, walking out with more ammo you used, aid drops, endless spawns until completion, the rewards you get at the end, and the fact that it is easily solo-able (although elder specifically can be out of reach for some solo) it’s prob the best bang for your buck end game activity.
---
TS weapons do more damage than bloody weapons now. 😂😂😂
---
Since it’s not coming this year, let’s hope the Bombs Drop event will make up for it.
---
It would need it’s own pool.  Stacking some of the existing power armor mods, with all the advantages they already have, would be waaaay to strong. It would probably have to be restricted to 1* stuff.
---
You'll still have all that stuff. You just can't add anymore to the stashbox now.
---
Allright Satan, that's enough.
---
632 is still right though.
---
Yep, didn’t get shit today.
---
An alternative would be to create more, useful, mods for them... EG: arm mods that reduced heavy weapon recoil or increase weapon reload speed.
---
Make them extremely customizable and more suited to using heavy weapons rather than just rad protection, carrying stuff, and mostly pointless unarmed combat arm mods.
---
Don’t freak out bro it said the same for me and mine just came back I was so scared just like you
---
can't you still stack meats on top of each other?
---
Its been brought up many times. They couldn't be the same effects as regular armor though or there would be outrage. I feel like effects that help the PA and user. Maybe a Tesla legendary effect thay boost the damage of energy weapons or a leg legendary called under foot. You cam just squish bugs like ants and rad roaches rats and the like.
---
I run a lean ship on my active characters. Buuuuut.... I'm on PC. ages ago I bought a second account and I dual-client. So the second account is STUFFED with crap.
---
so does this only apply to 1 target.
---
Like if I shoot a mutant the first shot is regular and second is enhanced with +10% damage. But if i switch targets it resets.
---
Or can I shoot a mutan and first shot is normal and then switching targets the shot is enhanced?
---
If it resets with each enemy seem pointless for a stealth rifleman with new update everything takes 2 shots anyways
---
I don't care about your life, shut up and play the music
---
I’m curious, did people on PTS forum say the nerf is too bad and enemy got too much buff? This update is based on the feedbacks from PTS so most testers must had felt it’s ok?
---
yes that would make sense, 1 star at the most seems fair
---
You sure? Why?
---
The Gutter is tradeable. Why not the war glaive? They're both just random plan drops.
---
I laughed. TWICE!
---
WHAT
---
If only they’d make an exception for queen and colossus but I doubt they’d consider
---
Yeah no kidding on that one. I found a level 100 3 star legendary assaultron fighting some raiders when I mapped to NAR Repair Yard yesterday and she slaughtered every single one of them then killed me 3 times before I finally managed to take her down. I wouldn't even bother with those things anymore unless it's legendary.
---
Exactly, I use heavy weapons so all of the arm mods are completely useless
---
Oh I know. Guess first day everyone was not getting it but it’s been a lot better now usually get elder on second run
---
I got 2 at once but I can't remember which ones. But I have 3 of one plan, and one other.
---
lol, nice!  Roger that chief, I'll just go ahead and put my life on hold cause /u/reggieus needs my workbench :P
---
On the off chance you are being serious, please work on your sense of entitlement.  It's an unattractive quality, and you will be better off without it ;)
---
Do we need legendary power armour perks , I feel its pretty balanced now if not already leaning towards power armour still being better especially with the legendary perks making them almost indestructible.  I feel armour is in a good place right now For Pa anyway. Kinda sick of the unyielding being the meta for 90% of no PA builds.
---
How do you know this? The Gutter plan is droppable and tradeable, and I know the old Gutter was too (I'm not going to craft one to find out if the new one is; 2 modules for a VE assaultron blade is laaaame)
---
I did 3 fully upgraded legendary stats perks, and 3 QOL/Team ones.   (Ammo Factory 3, Taking one for the Team 3 and Follow Through 3)
---
I think there is a point of diminishing returns with Legendary Special Cards, since there are only so many pertinent perk cards per role.  Plus, nobody needs max endurance or charisma.  If I had enough points, I'd probably max out intelligence just for the XP, plus luck, strength and perception.  So for me, 4 legendary special cards would be the most that I would take.
---
And we’d probably have to avoid things like bolstering, vanguards, and *shudder* unyielding since PA already has such high DR/ER and innate damage reduction would take a lot of the risk of unyielding away (what little risk there is to begin with)
---
Sick ideas! Stuff like vanguards and unyielding definitely wouldn't work and would be way too op, so stuff like that would be awesome
---
H weapon as in hack? Or did I miss some new lingo.
---
yup exactly what i said in another comment just now
---
yes. some of my posts with that word weren't showing so I'm typing H just to be sure.
---
I’m pretty much done with my sneak toon as any activity or event seems to remove your ability to sneak which for me means a huge damage loss. That’s also factoring being a sneak character who is very much squishy without her shroud of darkness.
---
I've got 3 lvl 100+ characters and it annoys me to no end as well. I really enjoyed creating multiple characters. Once they got sufficiently strong I moved onto another build and another idea.
---
I used a flamer on a freezing fire starter
---
what did you think patch 22 was
---
I personally believe that Heavy Power Armor builds are fallout 76 gameplay at its peak. If you understand how various enemies/environments work, you become essentially unkillable, even as bloodied, and if you have a decent enough weapon you can mow down practically everything with little to no trouble.  
---
Commando gameplay, imo, is unsatisfying and boring. I don't understand the appeal of sneaking constantly during fights, spamming vats, and autokilling everything. I can understand how being able to kill everything incredibly quickly can be appealing, but the gameplay is a snooze. I used to run a bloodied stealth commando with a B2525 fixer, and eventually got so bored that I put the game down for months.   
---
That being said, if you're used to killing everything quickly and shredding through bosses, you'll probably get easily frustrated by becoming a heavy toon. It's difficult to maintain a steady stream of damage in boss fights, you really don't get any significant amount of armor penetration, so earl and the queen take a looong time to kill, and considering that you typically rely on explosive damage to kill average mobs quickly, you won't be able to solo a boss without a magic weapon or a BE gatling plasma. I personally run a BE gp for general use, a B2512 ugl for boss fights, (Although i switch that to the gp if i need to crowd control during earl fights) a BE gatling gun for very low level enemies i dont want to bother using the gp on, and a BE cryolator for shits and giggles. (I've also been considering experimenting with my BE flamer now that it deals fire damage, but i haven't bothered yet cuz fuel's expensive) I switch between a set of x01 and strangler heart armor depending on what mood i'm in, but the power armor can be essentially anything. I think even max level raider pa gives you the 42% incoming damage reduction pa gives, but don't quote me on that.  
---
My build is below. I only run one special legendary perk card, but you can modify it however you want. A solid amount of these are qol perks, just fyi, so if you only run one heavy weapon or don't rely on stims for healing, don't use bear arms or traveling pharmacy, and if you don't run energy heavies, don't use batteries included. Good luck with your build!

---
Go fight the queen and see how many 5mm you can loot off her. Most events don’t reward you with ammo. If they do then people will have no reason to either farm for better guns or grind for levels which defeats the whole purpose of legendary perks.
---
Apparently the throwing knife thing only worked if you had a melee weapon equipped. The melee makes all of your damage 'melee' so the throwing knives counted as well. If you have a gun out it won't work, iirc.
---
I think pa needs one more thing to be on par
---
That's the thing though.
---
If you had three perks (rifleman, expert rifleman and master rifleman) each boosting the damage by 20%, the old formula would give you 1.2 \* 1.2 \* 1.2 = 1.728x the damage.  If the base damage was 395 then the total damage should be 683 or so.  That's multiplicative.
---
The way it is supposed to work now is additive.  That is, three 20% bonuses would add up to one 60% bonus for a 1.6 multiplier, giving a total of 632.
---
He is only seeing 496, which is only a 1.256x multiplier.  I can't think of a way to add a 20% bonus, a 20% bonus and a 20% bonus that ends up with only a 25.6% bonus.
---
Sounds like something (their formula, the card text, the reported damage, etc.) is definitely wrong.
---
The above figures assume a base damage of 395 and no other effects beyond the three perk cards.
---
Speaking of melee does anyone have a grognak axe they’d be willing to part with? I’ve spent the last 3 hours server hopping with no luck
---
i'm smart
---
Story wise that windingo in the cave is pretty scary and it would be if it was in the real world. But this is a game and when you have a huge world and you want to sprinkle a bit of content everywhere to make the world feel more alive and interesting it would be time consuming to create a single unique boss for quests everywhere.
---
This windingo cave and story has been here since the game released. It would be nice to see Beth go back and improve these kinds of quests but they have a lot on their plate right now that they need to sort.
---
Whenever it does that, I melee and it gives me those 10 or so cells lmao
---
The gutter came with a perk similar to vampires but with extra damage I think when you got it from the OG version of the burrows back in year one and whistle in the dark was a survival mode challenge AR that dropped with the nocturnal effect. Has anyone got these plans to drop? If so has the gutter retained its unique perks, and does whistle in the dark have anything unique about it? Do they drop from the purveyor? These weapon plans might be something to look out for
---
Yeah these two didn't make the cut but they'd get the essentials with +6 while allowing like +15 str, int, luck, agi I think? Just doing light thinking at work but it seems like you'd be able to max out the amazing ones and still get the few good ones from the others.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=a336aae&amp;d=s01sv3s32sr2sq2p00eu0ee2c62cd1ce0ib4ii0ip2ir2id2a04am2a90a72a32la0l22ls2lt2lu2l71&amp;w=pe2
---
This was a quick build did on mobile (couldn't put 4 stats into the cards for whatever reason) but would this work? I don't remember how all cards worked with explosive shot
---
Maybe allow for jetpack and a mod , I feel that would be a fair addition.
---
I stopped listening to the radio because her dialogue is so cringey. Even Travis was better before his quest.
---
You can already do that with t 65
---
Why? I have ammo maxed out. I get a bunch from ops and acp but I play a lot more then just those. I get 90 556 with out super duper. I get 53 45 with out super I get 9 ultrice plasma cores I get a bunch of 2mm. I have so much ammo stacked I could care less walking around looting bodies. Because it seemed like the first day no one would melee because they wanted their ammo. I am glad I maxed out ammo perk. Way better then most of them
---
If you're having this much of a problem using OTHER people's things dont get mad if they don't tell you they're gonna leave the game while you're using THEIR workbenches and I think it's a privilege to use other people's workbenches I'm not gonna on a whole rant calling people who leave the game assholes just because they left to probably go do something more productive then play 76
---
Yes. 
---
Again. I started a new toon the night of the patch. I mentioned this in multiple other threads as well. 
---
It is definitely far more challenging than before. I quickly found out that if I don't use cover, or approach an encounter by just walking in and bashing/shooting everything....
---
You will die. 
---
So I started using cover. And sneaking. And avoided getting swarmed by multiple hostiles. And sometimes I had to run away. 
---
I've now died 4 times across 23 levels. It's difficult, but not punishing. It's been a more tense, interesting experience. I'm playing combat. I'm not just mowing down cannon fodder to get loot.
---
I would preffer for sets to have bonuses like the Strangler Heart. I feel like giving them legendary prefixes, would make them way to good
---
I just like that the Wasteland feels dangerous again, even as a lvl 350 tryhard.
---
There will be a notification when a teammate starts it, in the top left as well. But ive missed it and had to use the in daily ops to know it had started.
---
I second this, just got an instigating tesla shotgun and i feel its super weak because of the patch.  Might as well benefit from shotgun perks and it makes sense considering rifles can swap between rifleman and commando by changing the receiver.
---
Great point. Excavator has +100 carry weight, strangler has poison damage, but all the other sets? Nothing.
---
Look who didn't read anything.... My whole post was not solely about one shotting things.
---
As a full unyielding I feel its amazing but if I jump into power armour I tend to take it off .
---
I wish you could kill her and then one of the Raiders could take over. "Hey folks this Crimes Johnson and you're listening to raider radio!"
---
They exist, just not legitimately. lol
---
Other events giving no ammo is irrelevant. You could spend a day doing every daily op that gets started and have more than enough rounds to last you for a very, very long time. And I would never use this gatling gun on the queen, the accuracy sucks for something flying around that much. 2 or so fusion cores in an ultracite gatling laser is all the queen requires and those are very easy to manage.
---
You mean more productive like following my posts and responding to them? Got it!
---
I feel ya. I got him below half health when I got swarmed by spawns and my stimpak hot key shat itself.
---
So you basically get unlimited health but they don’t? Seems fair...
---
I've been a bloody stealth using instigating sniper and instigating Fixer, and it was awesome. Now the sniper rifle isn't much because of the slow rate of fire. The Fixer is still good for quick double taps.
---
Is AA doing good damage for sniper rifles?
---
Just canceled my fo 1st, my investment of time and effort just netted me a negative result, seems like i was paying to be screwed over every time, i will miss the community but i can't keep paying to be constantly made to pay more and invest more time for the same thing, soon it will come to having to put 1000 rounds into a level one mole rat, thats 250 steel, 250 gunpowder and 250 lead, i fucking love this game but no just fucking no!
---
O I didn't know that , you can put emergency photocells and a jetpack?  That's rad .
---
Honestly this is amusing
---
As a full health pa user I think we need new legendary effects for this type of armor maybe like
---
No stagger when hit from melee
---
More carry weight the higher the health
---
Maybe a chance for infinite Ammo for a couple secs when procced by doing a simple task but has low chance if activation 
---
 etc. Just ideas Idk but I would like new effects only for pa and not already existing effects.
---
Exactly this. And dont forget, that Excavator also gives you 4x as much ore when u collect. Theres a reason why most end game players, stick to excavator. You just straight up win on all sides. Now, it would be rlly nice, if sets like the T-Series, X-01 and Ultracite gave you bonuses. An idea would be giving Ultracite set a 50% damage reduction against scorched and a 5% bonus damage with ultracite energy weapons.
---
Right?
---
Even on my main earlier, I almost auto jumped into one violent night to solo it ....
---
Then realized that's a risky move. I like that.
---
You're acting like an entitled asshole, expecting people to adjust to your needs because you're too selfish to adjust your behavior to suit theirs. Insulting people because they won't go out of their way to help you, and then calling someone an asshole because they called you out on your behavior is hypocritical. Sure, I'll be the first to admit that I'm not exactly being friendly with you, but you seem to be completely in denial about your actions. Self reflect a bit, it'll make you a better person.
---
Have this happen to you and get back to me
---
Deathclaws ain't shit. Yaoi Gui are what you should be scared of
---
Yes you can, and you are most likely two-shotting everything if you have a decent weapon even without stacking buffs. Hell a power-attack + instigating legendary will probably net you a oneshot on everything except queens of different sorts.
---
I legit don't know how people are building their characters to somehow struggle massively both in terms of damage and survivability. If you had a somewhat decent build before it will still annihilate basically everything.
---
Glad you like it, originally it was supposed to be a humorous post, till the real aholes started commenting
---
Mine are still with me?
---
You put the jetpack on the arms actually, and emergency protocols on the torso... unfortunately it's  a glitch.  I think legendary pa would be good, or something more useful for arms.
---
Yeah you can accomplish what you're trying to do. It's basically what I did, I just left Charisma and endurance low and almost maxed out all the others.
---
I know. But hey. Maybe you can make a medic build, go for everything healing and you good. If ya want I'll screenshot my perk setup
---
They've always been trouble for me. Now I will actively avoid them if I'm not fully prepared.
---
I have the legendary card for crafting my precious ultra plasma cartridges, except that now because of Ops I don't need to craft nearly as often. My stable flux's are just piling up now!
---
AA is fine.  Bloodied is still best
---
where did you see this?
---
Booking it is tough when they have freezing modifiers.
---
The Glaive is awesome. First drop.
---
I’m still learning a bit but what do you mean by murmrghs mystery pick
---
I have the glaive plan. I'll try to see if its tradable tomorrow
---
there is a rumor that has yet to be proven true
---
Yea for sure the arms need something.
---
100% buff would be OP. So I looked at the legendary perk cards again and I think everyone has been eluding to using the Take One For The Team card. Is that card working off your base damage too or is it calculating off your total damage?  As a solo player take one for the team would require you to be mobbed before it starts working. The way it reads only the enemy that hits you starts taking more damage. The 1st rank is only 10%. Multipliticive or not that sucks. It would take me a very long time to fully rank that card.
---
Then idk what to tell you my guy. If you're under the impression that you're doing everything I'm doing, and I'm able to deal more damage than you, you must not be doing everything that I'm doing.
---
You having fun here
---
How do you people track down Grahm?? I can’t seem to find him now that I actually have caps to blow
---
I have yet to be graced with a bloody hunting or Fixer, but the instigating effect was awesome with the sneak perks, until the nerf. Still good, just not as good.
---
Ok thank you
---
Good to know bud.  The end/charisma cards could also be tossed for future actually super useful legendary cards and I'd level them last.  Appreciate the heads up though
---
Not offended in the least, my dude! Enjoy the wasteland!
---
Definitely still good
---
Crap I just made the switch to melee bc magic shotgun got old and frankly still works well without any shotgun perks. I spent today researching foods and weighing pros and cons to carnivore/herbivore. Can anyone or OP talk more about the food buffs essentially being nerfed? I got perks to a decent place but was counting on food helping to bridge the gap and make it much more viable.
---
Have what happen? Anytime you die and no one is still engaging the enemy the regain their health. It’s always been that way. Do you think you should be able to just keep dying without consequence until you brute force your way to victory?
---
Yeah, it's kinda entertaining ngl
---
ONLY ONE OF US WILL WEAR THIS! AND IT WON’T BE YOU!
---
I dunno, the One Wasteland seemed pretty heavily aimed at addressing issues for long-term players.
---
I was expecting more outrage here ngl
---
Sucks man. It’s nearly impossible if the math is correct.
---
It's a mechanic added to help variety. You're right, though. 'The harder, the better' is hilgihy subjective. Just try and and enjoy the game. You can't stop change and there is no point being salty about it.
---
No if you reread that and concentrate harder you can see it is singled out/targeted nukes. You probably don't even know how to do that so I don't know why you are commenting.
---
Put out to get some
---
Having been herbivore and switched to carnivore I can tell you Im liking carnivore alot more.
---
I've heard some say stealth isn't as good as before but haven't had a chance to try it out myself, do you have any trouble staying hidden from enemies with stealth suit??
---
Calibrated shocks exists
---
Your whole post is about having your head stuck up your ass and not thinking about how new and more casual players might experience this game.
---
Yeah I definitely don't enjoy playing much anymore, and really the rewards in the current season aren't that great to make me try to get each day's objectives done. Because of it, I'm going to be playing less, not more, so if that was Bethesda's goal, then great, they did it.
---
Annihilate is not the word I’d use with 500 damage sneak attacks on SBQ.
---
This. I didn't keep him for long because holy migraines batman.
---
I understand but for boss fights like queen and colossus it’s a different story
---
It's 4 times
---
These are why I left some room by maxing out 3 specials and having three slots that I can swap things in and out of.  Ammo factory is situational, so I can swap it out for poison resistance.  I have an asbestos torso and fireproof 3, so I really don't need the fire one.
---
Is there a quest involved to unlock the Daily Ops?
---
Oml yes. Or at least get rid of the long ass entering/exiting power armor animation
---
I'm running vampire weapons on my bloodied build and they're doing better than my bloodied weapons. &gt;.&lt;
---
I don't give a crap if you started a new character. New players don't know how to play the game and are learning. By level 20 they're still learning the CAMPs and crafting and all manner of things. You are cheering a patch that is going to make it impossible for them, as they're out of bullets, their armor is broken, and have no means of advancing. 
---
Say goodbye to these players, who will keep the game alive. Congrats on only thinking about yourself with your short-term, self-obsessive thinking.
---
I think it should be a view thing like the pip-boy. You can have the slower, more immersive format, or the quick convenient one.
---
Imagine someone trying to pump some iron in PA. It would make no sense.
---
What your saying would be a QOL improvement but it would be immersion breaking because how would a person with PA hands be able to craft stuff like bullets and guns with precision.
---
I’m ok with peeps downvoting 
---
Because it’s kind of meaningless
---
So far AA has been a good effect. At least on a Fixer.
---
It was great, decently manageable, but still tough enough, and most of the time you fail you feel like it was on you rather than the game.
---
Running through the open in front of a freezing minigun wielding super mutant, that's a paddling.
---
Ik just thought we could have a little more carry weight
---
Was getting decent exp with multiple lunchboxes stacked. However you can't get that every time obviously.
---
whistle in the dark is that lame nocturnal assault rifle from survival. 
---
mediocre one year ago, mediocre now. 
---
got the plans today.
---
No, it should just be in the start menu. there is a quest related to it though.
---
Why? They aren’t intended to be solo’d. You shouldn’t be able to just keep dying until you take away all their health. That would be poor design.
---
Yeah I've been playing with the sound off for a looong time because of bugs like this. I'm not a stealth build, but I typically spam the vats targetting button to find enemies, and then finish them off out of vats
---
Isn't the point of an RPG to build your character the way you want? This isn't a looter-shooter or fps. Combat should not be prioritized over other game aspects.
---
Anything honestly.
---
Im ok with you quitting for a while.. may you find the peace you desire
---
I'm good thanks, nothing worse than an ahole with righteous indignation, if you think I'm such a horrible person for asking a public online community a little more consideration in a public online game where everyone is at the mercy of grieffers and aholes, then why do you keep responding to my post, but I have to thank you for reinforcing the reason why I mostly stick to my private server rather than slumming it in Genpop with scum like you.
---
Yup. A buddy and I played a game on it and the noise followed us even in death.
---
Sounds like a pinball bouncing between your ears.
---
not all change is for the better. the least I can do is make my dissatisfaction known. specially if it's poor game design.
---
I don't care about immersion when it comes to this stuff, and I don't think many others do either.
---
"On top of the duped gear I'm forced to purchase"
---
So what you're saying is that you're too unlikable for the trading forums? Cause I haven't spent a goddamn dime and i have a *lot* of shit because 1. I know how to trade. 2. I'm likable enough that people just *hand* me stuff. 😂
---
I’ve gotten a number of bloody hunting rifles. I have no use for them. Scrip.
---
Ohh critt damage forgot about that I was talking the damage the pipboy tells you
---
Well that sucks. That was one of the few things I wanted in the run. Thanks for the heads up though. 👍
---
Thanks for letting me know, I can only imagine the hilarity of running for my life after testing it out.
---
Well, if you were on PC I'd be making you offers!
---
Yeah but he’s right.
---
Take one for the team seems problematic as a solo player. The text of the card seems to suggest that you'd have to be hit by each enemy you'd like to do extra damage to. Also I'm not sure how that perk would let you take more hits.
---
So your saying fuck all? Some people would like some stuff to make sense.
---
What you just did was self centered.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4eM5a9X6VmGaV7zz7gYnDy/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-september-2020-updates
---
I normally play this game for a few months at a time and then drop it for awhile. It’s fun in short bursts, and there’s no shame in taking a break. Not like there’s much else until winter to really look forward to now
---
You willing to trade your second liquid courage plan?
---
Where in the world do I get ammo? I'm lv 29 and feel like I spend most of my time trying to farm for ammo to complete 1 mission
---
Only died 3 times and obviously I know their health regains don’t have to keep telling me. and for boss fights it’s not game breaking
---
Ha oh well
---
Using exploits, in this case, getting a briefcase that spawns the same location every game is griefing.
---
Excavator?  That's 200 right there, marsupial gives another 25 with SIN.  Radicool also gives 25.  That's 250 plus strength plus base carry weight.  I consistently have over 400
---
Well it wasn’t always “a completely different Fallout”.
---
This game felt more like “Fallout, but multiplayer” than “Fallout the MMO” and One Wasteland is going to weed out everyone who played Fallout 76 for the former, before the update.
---
Lol, no thanks. It's expensive ammo wise enough running actually good builds.
---
Grahm can’t count to seven because, and this is a little known fact, Super Mutants have different numbers of fingers depending on which strand of the FEV they were mutated under. He has 3 fingers on each hand, plus a thumb.
---
I got the special ops mask today.  It's tradeable...value?  Drop rate?  No idea.
---
I try not to carry tons of them but I do carry a lot of Stimpacks, Radaway, and Purified Water. I'll sell off a lot and my main's CAMP has 3 water purifiers so I can rack up somewhat easily. 
---
For STR I have Study Frame, Bondolier, and Pack Rat maxed. I don't use PA and I'm not fond of it.
---
Oh nah, don't get it mixed up, there's no conjecture involved here, it's pretty clear that you're a horrible person. lol. As to your second point, I'm only really continuing to reply because it's difficult for me to accept that people as openly entitled, self deceptive, and self centered as you exist in our community, but if what I'm saying is really making you this upset, I won't continue. I hope you get your head checked out! ^^
---
It wasn't very popular. I remember trying to hop lobbies but there was only the one.
---
You're obviously a non PA user or a masochist. If you want things to make sense then how about not giving non PA users jetpacks that don't require cores? How about not having someone outside of PA able to carry more than a giant tank robot.
---
It is like that when you’re low level. But being you’re 29 go look up the mission for the excavator power armor and look up video on where to get stuff for ammo. With power armor and going to lucky hole you will get a lot
---
You might try these:

---
Haven't used them myself but they seem to be in the right ball park.
---
Maybe you should be using the other end of it then.
---
And? DPS is still shit compared to heavy weapons and commando. Who wants a build that is trash against bosses and heavy enemies? Go fight a behemoth now with melee and tell me how that goes.
---
This is old news, but yeah, the bonus is 4.5 total.  (Base × 4.5) + (base × .3 × 2) with super duper
---
I am from Connecticut they were called grinders there.Lived in Arizona for a while and they called them hoagies or subs.Now I live in Maine and they call them all three lol.I think grinder is a older school term for them originating up north.Everyone will know what you mean if you say hoagie or sub.Not as many will recognize the term grinder.
---
My melee was better today, dmg numbers where closer to prenerf, feels like something was adjusted, cuz Tuesday was really bad
---
I’m a bloody heavy PA user and I would welcome this change, but I can see the other side of the coin. It’s not much of a problem.
---
To the point about carrying frames that is much needed because that would hamper gameplay in a major way. Like I said some stuff needs to make sense.
---
Plus I doubt they would do this because Beth would have to create more animations.
---
Edit: your downvotes really show your mentality.
---
Good it feels like the game is played near perfect now i do wish bloody explosive wasn't the only good thing though
---
5 months isn’t a lot of time in computer development. The bugs may have been sporadic and hard to recreate. We don’t know if they were working on it and then the pandemic hit do they had to refocus priorities. 
---
Maybe they wanted to add to the event. But had to change that once the pandemic hit so they decided a new event would be better. 
---
I’m thinking the Bombs Drop event is what Valseek was talking about, since the war happened at that time of the year.
---
You can buy scout armor from Modus in the Enclave Bunker’s Armory.
---
Yeah. It’s great. I can only use it in ops, because that’s expensive ammo. But who doesn’t love endless explosions.
---
That sucks. I think they could have stuck a decent balance between the people who want more challenge and the people who play casually.
---
Fixing a bug is usually very simple.  Fixing a bug without producing at least three new ones...that takes some doing.
---
Yes thats true. I run marsupial and sin. But I just use t65 so  that's why. Just a little idea of throw out there was all
---
You’re completely wrong. If you have pacifist on. You can shoot. Melee attack. Throw grenades.Do any type of damage to any other player. And Nothing will happen. The game will actually give you a notification saying “pacifist enabled”
---
So if you’re shooting at me while you have pacifist, the game won’t tell me I’m being attacked or anything. Even if I see you shooting at me, and I decide to shoot you back, nothing will happen because you’re on pacifist. 
---
The ONLY exceptions where pacifist doesn’t matter or protect you at all, is in workshops. Whether you own the workshop, you happen to simply walk by, if the workshop is being taken over, or if another player tries to take it over, ANY and ALL players can be attacked and killed by any player. 
---
I’m not too sure about bounty system. I don’t think pacifist will protect you if you have a bounty on your head. Maybe somebody else can go more into detail about that.
---
I started this season at 900 2mm, and now im at 5000 and I havent crafted a single one, I literally unequipped ammo factory bc theres not even a point haha
---
They should just buff the weaker prefixes and leave the scaling alone. Make players stronger, not make enemies weaker.
---
DOPS dont award cores. Ill take my 9 ultracite cores per pull with Ammo factory tyvm. XD
---
Ok but it’s overpriced and the full set isn’t there. I’ll try server hopping.
---
Damn I’m out here posting something about this and I get yelled at and you’re getting praised. Wish more people thought like you tho tbh
---
Hey man, if you enjoy it and it works for you, use it. You don’t need to build optimally to have fun.
---
A lot of people are saying you need to be more team-oriented now but I play Lone Wanderer and post-patch am doing perfectly fine. For anyone interested I run a high-defense build with rifles/shotguns and no VATs.
---
I am specced into lots of Strength [Barbarian] and Agility [Evasive] for the high defense perks which is somewhere over 300 defense right now at about level 46. I also have Blocker and Lone Wanderer plus armor pieces that give defense at high health. I almost never worry about dying. 
---
For damage perks I have Bloody Mess, Tank Killer and the Rifleman perks [right now just one of each Rifleman perk]. My best weapon might be my pump shotgun though, not for damage but for crippling enemies with Enforcer. Any strong enemy like Deathclaws, assaultrons, wendigos, ghouls, etc. I can cripple their legs in just a shot or two, making them no threat at all. You don’t even need a legendary shotty just the crippling perk [at level 30] and it’s a game-changer. I also have a melee weapon to save bullets at times.
---
So for example I just solo’d the latest Daily Ops with the Super Mutants that freeze. I cleared it first try and never went below half health. It could have been smoother but a high defense build can go far.
---
Or for free if you know the right people and are halfway likable.
---
Wow!  I haven't been as lucky to bring in a net positive, but it's pretty close.
---
If someone only plays daily OPs yes I can see he gets more than he spends. Other events giving no ammo is relevant, because if you do a mixture of different activities, you’d need to supply ammo in other events with the surplus you get from daily OPs in order to break even. Gatling is very ammo efficient, it’s exactly what I use on my HG. But on my commando toon it’s different story, I did one round of OP and got about 300 rounds of ammo, those were quickly gone in boss fights and farming. I can do another round of OP to supply myself, or I can just craft a few quickly with the new perk.
---
I think someone else mentioned set bonuses for all pa.  I use t 65 as well.  What would it's bonus be if you could make one?
---
That is the normal price since it can’t be crafted.
---
Omg lol you crack me man, I needed that after dealing with this hurricane
---
Not who you asked, but you get a (non-sellable) chem in your inventory every 30min that fills your water, fills your food, cures diseases, and regains health. 
---
I think I have the second to last rank, but leveling it is pretty much a waste. I have no need for getting that chem this often and holding so many since food and water don't regrade *that* fast.
---
But we don't. I have a b25 .50 cal unyielding build, this patch is no more difficult than it was before. The main complaints are coming from low level and casual players without optimized builds, who were treading water before the changes, and are now almost completely unable to play.  Everything is a bullet sponge with massive damage output because every single enemy in every part of the map scales with them.  Stop pretending this circle jerk about OP players complaining is what's actually happening right now, most of the people who have actually authored posts about not liking the changes are low levels and casuals, who make up the majority in any games playerbase I might add.
---
Yeah I’m not going for anything like crazy optimized. But I haven’t the slightest clue how to make even  a basic build. I just worry about being ground into pulp the second I start doing higher tier activities when the time comes (I’m level 39)
---
I just wish I would get something usable as a melee build instead of random ammo
---
&gt;If they want stealth snipers to do extremely well, the first step is to remove the timer.
---
A timer increase would be simpler and more reasonable.
---
I run a build with 20 perk points spent on weight management for 95% of the time and still kill everything and rarely ever die any piece of shit excavator power armour heavy gunner build is unkillable and still puts out high damage
---
I feel like if they added more players to the server, then reddit would be full of “now I can’t place my camp down because there’s too many people taking up my spot”
---
classic, you are the best man :)
---
If I play my main toon in power armor he’s not dying. The update really didn’t hurt him too terribly. My unarmed melee toon? I fought a Mirelurk Queen on her for the first time today...died a lot since I couldn’t kill it in 4-5 hits like usual.
---
Stealth toon? Not even worried since the new Ops aren’t for stealth builds. Come to think of it, activities in general aren’t for stealth builds so I’m about to retire her permanently.
---
If you don't like it, than just get out of pa
---
One of the adjusted rewards is the additional xp gained from fighting high level enemies. Levelling up higher level characters should be easier since you can literally go everywhere now. Now its time to determine which locations now provide us the most potential xp per visit. 
---
Morgantown is certainly a lot more interesting now since there's a pretty serious number of ghouls spread around town.
---
Lol 1st off Todd can suck my ass. Dude were probably roughly the same age. I was a kid when Fallout came out. I'm talking about the fallout game that Bethesda bought out and turned into this. And if your talking about patch 22 you have 0 idea of what it's like to be a game developer. Patch 22 was a giant fuck up because they tried overlaying the same shit from the PC servers onto the consoles servers. Which you can't do. And were basically bitching about the same thing. Yes FO76 launch was shit and I played from closed beta until 2 weeks after launch and just started playing again the last 4 months because they have made significant progress from when the game originally started out.
---
"If you think I'm gonna go to my camp and check whether or not you're using my workbenches every single time I log out, you're an entitled prick. Access to other players' workbenches is a privilege, not your right. If you don't want to risk the game bugging out, don't use my workbenches"
---
But I'm the self centered, and need my head checked out, you should get yourself a mirror, they're not that expensive, Dr.
---
Yep it’s ridiculous. They’ve literally gone from one extreme to another thing with some things in this update, weapon &amp; armor durability being one.
---
Poggers
---
Yeah but I didn’t want to get massacred by scorched (which used to be twigs) because I’m level 20 on a new character I was hoping to go a pistol build. One Wasteland is almost oppressive for new characters who were already low on ammo, good weapons, and meds prior to the update. Now I get swiped once by a melee scorch and my health is at half. Simply not the same game I was playing a week ago with my friends
---
How does me doing the same stuff in PA that someone does in normal armor hamper gameplay. All I am asking for is workbench and cooking stations be useable without exiting PA. I don't care about other things like weight benches, regular benches, etc. It just seem like an unnecessary time waste to have to exit your armor to do something tbat 99% of the time does not involve another person or their realism.
---
Edit: if people really cared, then they can just exit it like normal and do it, I don't care. It doesn't change anything besides me not wanting to wait through an animation to begin my shit.
---
I thought two shot on shotguns was pointless? Doesn’t it just add another pellet, or did they change it?
---
The issue I'm having with VATS is after the patch some weapons cannot land a shot AT ALL.
---
I went to Arktos for the Terminal Hacking challenge, targeted a Mr. Gutsy with my Gauss Rifle, and went through SIX FULL CLIPS at "95% chance to hit" missing EVERY shot even at point-blank range with it standing there not moving.
---
After the first several shots missed, I turned it into an experiment to see how long it would take but after 30 shots just gave up. This is with Concentrated Fire.  I'd started just aiming at Torso, but after missing so many shots I tried targeting various body parts but landed zero anywhere.  I popped in and out of VATS retargeting a couple of times as AP drained, so I've no clue what could possibly be happening. I started in sneak, but stood up after a while to see if it would change if it aggro'd me, but even while getting shot at, nothing hit.
---
Dropped that gun in my stash for now, because it's useless.
---
I've never heard of anyone playing like this and you know what, it sounds great. A great idea! But also a very difficult play style comparatively. 
---
I'd say get 3 or 4 pieces of broken life saviour armour and 1 piece of auto stim.  I've been playing with the "zombie" as I like to call it where you go down (if not straight killed) and get back up with a 50% bonus due to revenant.  I like to think of it as rage mode you can't kill me I'm too angry to die.  
---
And of course when you're a junky you eat chems all day everyday. 
---
Imagine the fun weapons you can get for cheap because "ew berserker " 
---
Such a great idea truly. I might even do it myself.
---
It's ridiculous that in a post-apocalyptic game, people are complaining that they can't just waltz through it and have everything be easy. We're in the wasteland, doing shooty bang bang things is a part of the gameplay. 
---
Dear foodbuilds: If you want to build camps and grow crops without ever being attacked by NPCs or players, then you've picked the wrong game.
---
I am. that doesn't make what they did with melee ok.
---
I think if you use legendary special perks you could.  But I'd rather use them for qol perks
---
Buff rifleman class weapons between 10-20%, depending on weapon.
---
Give the perk "tank killer" bonus weakspot damage, 25% per rank. This also gives gunslingers a little love.
---
To be clear, this bonus weakspot damage would be multiplicative with the current bonus damage for weakspots, so with rank 3 tank killer a 2x headshot damage bonus would jump to 3.5x
---
Both rifleman and gunslinger are thematically classes that invest in aiming and very high alpha strike. It's time they reflected that.
---
Thank you, you're too kind!
---
I got lucky and got them on my first op. Got cage lights yesterday and got the shaft today. Lots of good looking stuff to grab in the coming weeks.
---
Hmm that's a tough one cause I want something that's beneficial for all types of power armor users.
---
But like my first little effect I would say like no stagger. So if you get hit no stagger or fall from a high place no long animation. But I would have to think a little longer for a actual good bonus effect. But that's just a little quick idea.
---
Not freaking out or scared. Stating facts based off the post with my own experience relating to yours.
---
Yes, just put the most points into Strength, Perception and Agility.  Assuming that you don't have any legendary perks, something like 11, 10, 5,4,5,13, 8.  You should be able to switch cards around within that structure depending on the weapon you are using at the time and do pretty well.  
---
With Legendary Perks, it is quite possible to make an "All in One" build that is quite effective with nearly every weapon.
---
It happened to me earlier for what it’s worth. Tried to sell a vampire swing speed super sledge for 3k. I pressed A to list and it didn’t go into the vendor. Tried a few more times and it finally went up in my vendor or at least I thought. Went back a few minutes later to find that all my lead scrap in my stash was on sale for 3k. Has only happened once
---
IIRC, it's usually the limbs on sale there but I don't remember them being any more than 200 caps each. The mods on the other hand are a completely different story.
---
That’s odd. I do 150-180 total with my AAE Handmade  with sneak attacks, and around 380-400 with sneak VATS critical. Aiming at her head of course. Where were you shooting her at, and from what distance?
---
Are we not getting a Double XP this Season??
---
Huh.  
---
Considering I'm maxed on chem weight reduction I don't want to do the same for another if it doesn't.
---
*face palm* I was talking about not being able to carry frames would hamper gameplay in a major way when you were complaining about my view on this games realism. Some stuff needs to make sense while others can be some magical force the world somehow provides.
---
You expect people to be quiet about exploits. LOL. It's amazing that magic weapons stayed a secret for as long as they did.
---
she is the sole reason i no longer listen to any radio station in fallout 76
---
Excuse me, you dare shit on my food builds?! Them food builds are still awesome! Might have suffered a bit, but still awesome.
---
That is, if you, you know, bother farming food for them. And chems. You know, do things your build was made for. Instead of wasting time whining on the forums.
---
Me too but seeing as some of the randos I've played with so far can't even understand that simple concept, I'm not optimistic.
---
Get the bird bones mutation to reduce the animation from jumping off stuff.  You still get the animation, but only from higher places.
---
Haha unfortunately my full VATS gauss shotgun is (currently) at an advantage bc of certain damage bugs (vats occasionally fires the shot like a high powered slug instead of a scatter). I essentially use 1-4 shots per kill in Daily Ops and kills drop 4-12 + an occasional 200 for completing the op. My materials go to the constant upkeep on the weapon itself at this point.
---
I have two toons that can complete the Ops. Guess which one has some of the new string lights and solar panels while the other has nothing?
---
Why can’t I make armor in my pa but I can build a house and all it’s furniture in pa? 
---
Like, why force players who use pa to get out to fix a gun?
---
It’s not a immersion thing. Your picking choices off a list.
---
OooooooooooooooooO000
---
Just do enclave events. It feels like the always reward a piece.
---
That prison is a revolving door for Mad Dog Malone.
---
gta online does it and that has no subscription service unlike fallout 76 :)
---
It would be nice if they died when they actually hit 0 hp too. So many times during that event I would get a stingwing to 0, then they'd heal back up or take an extra few hundred damage to kill. That was the worst offender for damage like that I've seen since the update.
---
That, and the crazy spawn rate of like 5 every 30 sec is just stupid when trying to do it solo.
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
ngl those chonky ghouls have made me yelp a little louder than I'd care to admit.
---
I was so pumped when I got the war glaive only to find when I went to drop it on my melee that I couldn't trade it. It better be such a game changer when I finally get it on my melee for it to justify all the restrictions.
---
I think it would be cool if we got a system that picked up stuff we couldn't get from containers in events and/or quests. Sort of like the postmaster from Destiny 2.
---
Would a power armor backpack that increases magazine size for heavy weapons x2 to x4 be too strong?
---
Basically it would mean two different builds of the game to manage. That would be a nightmare.
---
lol this guy comparing bethesda to one of the greatest rpg developers out there (obsidian)
---
I don't claim to be the smartest person and I still don't understand what the hell you are talking about. It sure isn't about what I am suggesting. I never said to not carry frames?
---
I agree.  
---
There should be an Auction House of sorts.I haven't played WoW since 2009 but it had one I thought was pretty good.  
---
Limited amount of slots to auction things.  
---
The AH probably had it's own server since there were so many items and trading going on.  
---
It also had a mail system where you could mail any character almost anything including gold as long as you knew the name of the character. The same could be done here.
---
Is it possible to even finish fast enough for any of these solo?
---
Yeah you weren’t really nerfed your build doesn’t rely on multipliers for DPS stuff like sneak rifleman does though, you didn’t have anything to nerf while the sniper builds now have a mostly useless build and gun.
---
A week means available for 7 days. Not a solid 7 days of full 24 hours.
---
That’s how the world has worked forever.
---
Count the days out. It’s 7 days you’ll be able to do the event.
---
Well goddamn. Lucky you.
---
They kept monkeying around with the mechanics and no one was happy. Towards the end they finally removed all player markers from the map, it may have been unpopular but it's what I wanted but then the put on a damage cap. Then the meta became a VATS w high DPS and I prefer manual aim.
---
😭😭my bloodied melee build is pathetic now thanks Bethesda.
---
Went from two hitting a scorchedbeast lv 80
---
To two hitting a scorched lv 50.
---
Are they trying to force everyone to use stealth commando or heavy gun builds
---
You mean that isn’t normal?
---
The gutter does get legendary effects as well, so it's a decent one-handed choice.
---
Then again one-handed is kinda shit.
---
Raiders
---
Maybe a little over powered. Would it work with say a   gatling plasma lol. Considering I can get 500 rounds in my magazine
---
please explain why bethesda would make a change that makes people spend LESS time for the SAME rewards? do you know how quarterly reports with user engagement for the shareholders work?
---
This update has been great for me.
---
Did Ra-Ra open the side room for you?
---
I wasn't playing last year ether , was on a year long break. I've read on this and it seems to be the event everyone loved. it sounds like the best thing 76 every released ! I don't even know what happens in it and I was excited for it. Seeing this post I was kinda bummed as I imagine many will be.
---
Yes.  Hey, do you know why some are 500 and some are 350?  I crafted a bunch and I can't find out why.  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iu77ma/im_pretty_sure_ill_never_need_to_craft_any_ammo/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I’ll say this: they’re too easy if you have any kind of decent build. Those with non optimized builds are struggling. This is unfortunate, but it’s necessary for people to fix up their builds and meet the challenge of the content that they want to do.
---
Alternatively they could implement difficulty tiers so that more casual players could have an easier time while people who run optimized builds can tackle greater odds for increased rewards.
---
It lost popularty because of how the death penalty worked as in what resources you lost and caps lost. It was also incredibly infuriating to go into a mode where.you can hop between survival and adventure ay any time no penalty. So you would have people come from adventure all decked out in top gear just murdering everyone. Also legendary effects in general made it pretty shitty at the time, sentinel wasn't a chance it was an always so people in full assassin's sentinel where gods.
---
and thats how games die. I'm all for focusing your build, but alot of builds are shit...and GG if you're build was good enough before but now is worthless...having to rearrange perk points is a pain in the dick. I like stealth sniper build(rifleman) but its always been meh...went junkies because bloodied just seemed too "whoops i died" and I don't want to always be about dead. I'd be happy to just have non auto rifles be middle of the pack viable solo..iunno..I do know one thing though elitism kills games...casuals make up a larger majority and when you run off the casuals the game dies. Fo76 is not play how you want..its hey a couple builds are good..the rest suck balls hope you like the good ones.
---
Yeah, Fallout games aren't meant to be the SIMs games.
---
Are you getting nuked by the same person every match?
---
Yes, I really didn't like that exploit. Decided to get the blueprint though, and I've never actually used it before patch 22.
---
WTH r u talking about? This discussion is about weapon balance
---
He's in Berkeley Springs station now.
---
Moved to Berkley Station.
---
There's actually a little trick I do to get them to 500
---
 Gotta equip and re equip the gun when reloading
---
This. In all reality if there is a lot of people like this person, just exit your PA. I'm just asking for people like me who have had enough and don't care about the "realism" of a workbench to be able to have a memu that I can use while inside of it.
---
I got a rock.Okay seriously though I ran it three times but only because of it being a score requirement for the daily or weekly.Honestly I find them very hectic and dull to want to run them more than I need to.This set up is only going to appeal to the hardcore players and the completionists.After the event is over I am glad it is over.I don’t want to use 10 plus minutes of my time looting all the bodies.Especially the exploding ones that scattered everywhere.The xp is only worth it if it is super mutants otherwise you would be better off running west tek,huntersville etc.
---
Nah, that means more voice lines, more coding to put those voice lines with actual events going on, and more interruptions for songs. So, more work besides what Bethesda currently has planned for the roadmap, since they're already putting Steel Dawn and BoS off to next year then something like this won't be done any time soon.   
---
My best suggestion is to just turn off the in game radio, tune in to one of the Fallout radio livestreams on youtube that will have songs from FO3, NV, FO4, and FO76, (and a few others like the Bioshock/Mafia series) or make yourself a playlist of Fallout fitting music on youtube that you like and just hit the random button. If you need your connection to focus on the game then download the songs somehow, put them into a playlist on your pc and go to town. It's better than listening to her stories for the 200th plus time and the ever slowly shrinking in game radio song library that Bethesda won't be able to hold onto for a livestreaming mmo because the licensing will only last so long for each song.
---
People got too swole and could stack the buff to 100 strength.
---
Tldr is that people were exploiting a bug with it, Bethesda disabled it to investigate a fix.
---
VATs has been broken for a long while now.
---
This post got quiet thought I'd make a new comment
---
They need to nerf the enemy HP. Somebody on here posted math the other day comparing a hunting rifle at level 1 to level 50. Tricked out with mods and no perks/legendary stats I believe he said it was a 125% damage increase.
---
Comparatively, take an enemy like a Scorched and do the same thing and their scaling for HP was like 720% and that was not even factoring in armor mitigation.
---
Not a very fair comparison IMO.
---
I actually really do like this idea a lot
---
I bet that is the exact reason they didnt do that
---
Same here but switched all my Deep Pocketed to Ultra-Light and it's a great AP boost.
---
lmao
---
i think it should be multiplicative as per description it affecting player's total damage output. If you playing in team - so yes - that should be musthave perk for tank (if we able to distinguish roles in this game at all), but if (as personally i) always playing solo - no matter, just use legendary perks you like more. Personally i'm using 3 melee-affecting perks (Hack and Slash, Collateral Damage and Exploding palm) and have fun explosions almost with every strike which feels like adds significant bonus to damage even to single targets. Not every strike, but often enough to feel it. Alternatively - its totally ok to use legendary stats bonuses - people says that it providing very significant QOL improvement. Imo - ranged weapons still enough powerful to not buff them with legendary perks because they are, you know, ranged :)
---
Is there any proof about unarmed camps being left alone?
---
Un equip/re equip?
---
Oooooo.. thanks for the info. Had no idea.
---
The best part is when they are attacking your camp and you're helpless to stop it.
---
Ever since I removed mine I have never been attacked or any of my friends.
---
Appreciate your candor! 👍
---
What about nerd rage
---
A mutant hound spawned inside a wall lol, took me more than a minute to kill it.
---
To some it's worth more than others. I'm not even a bloodied build and I run it just because a jetpack is basically useless with marsupial. Imo.
---
I don't use a specific build. I use all sorts of different weapons to make use of the ammo types.
---
most effective is bloody for sure. i personally use junkie. 
---
and when i want easy mode i just go power armor + heavy weapon.  
---
your problem is not having ammo and legendary weapons, the game will get really tough for you (mid level) because of the patch, and bethesda said they are fixing it.
---
if you’re on PC i can help out fight stuff, give u some ammo and stimpak until ur higher
---
ahh got it thanks!
---
yeah dude, I am one of those people. I am nowhere near a hardcore player and I am not optimised. I honestly think the main problem here is that game was just too easy for too long. Bethesda should of resolved this issues with balancing a very long time ago but they didn't.
---
Balancing with lower players needs to be done, I hate games that are hard for the sake of being hard BUT the overall difficulty of this game was really low to begin with.
---
They also need to finally fix the buff system in general. In my perfect game we wouldn't have perk cards which boost damage on top of legendaries with affects which also boost damage. 
---
You'd just have perk cards and your gun isn't special at all. Reason I like this? Make constructing weapons a viable business again, helps nerf even magic weapons and this would help so much with balancing that we wouldn't have this huge gap between the power output of a serious or casual player.
---
Introduce features to give the game more to do than just the current grind for Legendaries.
---
EDIT: Also, make it so Perk cards can't just be changed all the time. Make it an actual investment in a character that you're building. Have one character good for combot, one for crafting make it so the game was replayability because you can have different goals based on your character. 
---
Hell, I would make it so C.A.M.P vendors are a perk card to construct so only characters built for being a merchant can run them.
---
So with power user and a gatling laser, it would be 2 to 4k ammo before a reload.  I love it.
---
Atomic shop was down, probably just displayed 0 since it can’t communicate.
---
There just has to be a way to make sure everyone is happy. I know there has to be a way for lower level players without meta builds to enjoy the game while giving more challenge for people who want it.
---
Make a real survival game though. No map, no fast travel, no pacifist mode, no vats, 52 players like NW, you die you lose everything.
---
Radiation rumble is also one of the best spots to grind now.
---
Hey there i am, gary!
---
Did your CAMP items get moved into "Stored"?
---
Or added as Blueprints?
---
Weather you plan to use it or not I think you're better off knowing the plan. Caps are easy to come by, anything even remotely rare from the queen isn't.
---
You know if you keep screaming at the top of your lungs. Bethesda is gonna hear eventually and nerf it.
---
Same
---
I just like the idea of a guy with t65 and a De plasma with 2k rounds 😂😂
---
Allowing us to choose is exactly what OP is suggesting.
---
Why wouldn't I know how to do that? You literally are crying griefing cuz you can't beat these people. Change your build. Nuke them first. Do anything, but what you chose to do here. 😂😂😂
---
AAE60 stealth commando here. The game is easier for me now then pre patch if I’m being honest. I was initially worried about daily ops not having stealth, but after spending time in the 3 variations we’ve had, stealth would be overkill. I 2-3 tap most enemies and they deal little damage. Optimized build, but it still feels too easy as commando.
---
I swapped at least two of mine today. I read there's a bug with 3* action girl where it goes down instead of up, so I'm going to test that, too.
---
Quick question.. if I don't pick up ammo from dead bodies, do I get that still or is that the only thing I don't get? In the rewards I get ammo for whatever gun I'm using but not sure if thats the reward or not
---
Nope, it’s still insanely powerful, as far as enemy avoidance goes. I can still sneak through an entire dungeon, passing right by enemies unnoticed. Obviously not for the piercing gaze daily ops, but works just fine in any other scenario.
---
One thing I have noticed though is it seems like enemies notice me less actually - killing an enemy will put me in caution if other enemies are nearby (maybe because I always power attack with the deathclaw gauntlet). Now it seems like the radius of awareness is smaller and I’m less likely to alert other enemies.
---
Get used to it.
---
That moment you step out of the Vault? In one wasteland, that's the strongest you will ever be.
---
Character progression is gone. It's been replaced by character regression. As you level up and invest perks you will get weaker and weaker.
---
He made so much he was able to get a better spot.
---
Yeah. 
---
I'm not exactly using the deep dark secret book of 76 tips and tactics here. 
---
Serrated Machete + a hunting rifle. Hide behind walls when shooting. 
---
This update doesn't make the game more difficult to comprehend for new players. It simply requires them to approach encounters with caution.
---
Try replacing stealth perks with dodgy and evasive. It’s given me more tankiness for Daily ops.
---
Can they be quad? 8k?  Or with a gatling laser and power user and quad it'd be 16k.
---
They don’t want people Zerg rushing. If you can run in and die repeatedly there’s no question on if you win, just how long.
---
It’s a good system, but if you want solo content meant for a group you have to actually play exceptionally. Not just smash a keyboard and ‘win’ by dying a thousand times to chip it down.
---
Good to know, thanks! Next time I'm able to play I'm definitely going to be trying this out more, always loved the Chinese stealth suit look but haven't gotten around to using it so much!
---
I just want the spec ops suit, man...that's all. It's like the only thing i think looks cool and that i'd have a use for. Hopefully tomorrow's thing isn't as much of a bitch as today's is.
---
The whole point of one wasteland was so that low level characters could go everywhere.
---
Instead, they can't go anywhere.
---
The update, regardless of any other changes, is a fundamental failure because of this.
---
You wasted no caps because caps are infinite. There will always be more caps
---
No sadly but damn that power would be insaneeeee
---
Just to let you know, it’s the drinking fountain in the covered gazebo thing. When I first heard of this I searched and searched for a fountain, I was looking for a water feature and i walked past that damn drinking fountain so many times before i just tried it.
---
Thank you kind vault dweller
---
How's that? 
---
My new toon ran a serrated machete and pipe rifle right after the patch dropped...
---
Died once early. Started using cover. Fared ok after that.
---
My AA1510 Ultracite Gatling Laser I got a hour before work was shredding. Looking forward to being off in two hours and test more.
---
Originally I was just going to say infinite ammo, but maybe that's slightly op
---
I‘m not sure, but I’ve 1-shot almost everything in VATS since getting it. Outside of VATS though it just takes away some health, and most, if not all of it gets replaced directly afterward.  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Tell that to stock portfolio
---
Put it into a 0 weight container helps with the lag a bit.
---
This Honestly cleared a bunch of stuff up for me thanks
---
I’d guess around 10k on the trade subs
---
One wasteland - because there's only ONE viable build you all have to use now
---
I'm not sure if the ammo in the rewards is just the ammo you didn't loot, or an entirely separate reward.
---
Glory to the charismatic Mr. New Vegas
---
&gt;  enemies scaling with your level is just terrible and lazy game design
---
I was under the impression they learned this lesson from Oblivion: Everyone hated it and the next couple of games made it seem like they'd learned their lesson.
---
But no, they've gone and Oblivion'ed Fallout 76.
---
I've actually been able to Beat him after the update
---
Yeah, I don't know either lol
---
Well maybe infinite magazine. Like the never ending effect 😍  then that would be amazing you jueycneed the ammo for it
---
Facts.
---
Yeah doing that too now, just need to finish up my secret service set. Most I've downed is 3 ghouls in 1 hit so far.
---
So, just to clarify cause my brain refuses to work today (I'm sorry to make you explain the same thing so many times) you can run through 3 times, getting each tier, and get the standard rare reward rates (5% on the Initiate run, 10% on the next, and 80% on the last), or you can get Elder your first run and get all three chances at once. Correct?
---
None if you sell your crafting services

My main is a Herbivore b/c she has IBS from eating meat. She did help out as she's not as horrible as those vegans who autistically screech at the rest of us b/c of our diet.    
---
My shotgunner eats whatever. BACON is life.
---
&gt;how about not having someone outside of PA able to carry more then a giant tank robot.
---
When I first read this I thought you were talking about PA frames. Now I know that your talking about Inventory.
---
In the end I have no clue where this conversation is going. All I said was is that it is nice to have some stuff in games make some sort of real world sense.
---
I’m not going against your idea of allowing PA able to use these things since it’s a nice QOL improvement. 
---
All I’m saying is to look around and see that there are people with different view points on the matter. However this is Reddit.
---
I'm also Bloodied Commando. For DO, I just hop into a suit of T65 with Emergency Protocols on the torso. I don't even bother to heal my rads because the 50% DR with T65 defense is more than enough, even with exploding enemies.
---
And no Double XP this season.
---
Ok well that’s no big deal. I was worried it was one of those ultra valuable trade only plans. Whoot
---
Someone with an extended case of the Mondays I see....
---
Just crouch, bro.
---
Rabbits sometimes eat their young.    
---
Other animals eat their own so not so 'cute and fluffy'.    
---
BACON is life.
---
Finally, I can open the 62 Nuclear Winter perk packs that appeared for me out of the blue for absolutely no reason. Double XP for all those duplicates will be really nice.
---
First day patch was out on Xbox we had 3 nukes launch, we fought Earle 2 times and queen once. Those three fights didn’t last but ten minutes and every night since I have fought Earle except tonight. So I haven’t experienced it being to bad since patch. But I do know we all gotta work together now. Did feel like tonight I was doing more damage to things tho then I did the last two nights
---
No, i just talk like that.
---
Nice of a herbivore to help kill animals needlessly.
---
Bacon is death.
---
Now I'm jealous I missed trying that!
---
And I understand those different viewpoints. However, as someone else had commented before, nothing changes with this change. If people care that much about realism, then exit the PA and use the bench like normal. It's a choice not a force to use.
---
Way way more than that
---
Maybe a weakish legacy
---
Not critical damage, just what the floating text tells me as heads explode. Crit was about 1400 with no crit damage perks.
---
Pvp is good for you! And easy to avoid if your not into that
---
Ok. Where do they live? Do you have an email?
---
Yup. Just like Twisted Muscles
---
😥 this disappointed me when i rebuild my camp today. was looking forward to  putting that big generator in one
---
They do at The end of the event though
---
Bacon is not death when done right. It's about control.  
---
Sadly, a vegan like that existing in the real world would be an endangered species.

Technically if you're in caution your still hidden and doing sneak attack damage
---
Lol thanks that's exactly what I was picturing in my head and I couldn't think of any at White Springs
---
Nice shit
---
Reminds me of the outrage from some people when Pokemon Go first introduced community days and they didn't last for 24 hours.
---
I agree with this.
---
I’ve noticed that, but being in caution makes enemies start walking around looking for me which can throw a wrench into things sometimes. If there’s a way I can stay hidden after killing an enemy, I’d prefer to do that.
---
Especially that one mirelurk king down in the cavern.
---
Stonks.com@aol.net
---
I always pay him a visit when I play while being drunk, I like him and his ways. When I am dead they should put my brain in such a thing so that I can continue drinking and having fun 😁
---
Thats all well and good but I doubt it will overflow in abundance.
---
Dying sucks, but I am enjoying the challenge. It got stale af one shotting everything.
---
I see no comparison here.  And creating a radio station that only has music isn't exactly a mind-blowing design choice made by rpg geniuses. 
---
Pretty shitty troll on your part.
---
How surv shortcut work out for you? Can you essentially ditch all foods/drink now? (bar buff food etc.)
---
I cruised by Poseidon thinking nothing of it and was immediately wrecked by a lvl 75 turret.
---
Yes. Always save the game. 😂
---
I see people of high level playing outside of public teams and it's very odd to me. Sure you might be introverted (I am too), but the advantages teaming up gives surpass my instincts of keeping to myself. 
---
You don't even have to interact with the teammates on public teams, think of it of playing alone in a social environment.
---
What is this mystery meat that doesn't necessitate death?
---
Do you mean, like, plant-based alternatives to bacon?
---
Thank you kindly I’ll give them a look!
---
While I enjoyed your sarcasm, some people out there are truly struggling with the changes.
---
Yeah. I mean look at all the posts on here where it’s clear the problem was they didn’t read. First day of Daiky Ops. Why did the thing do the thing! Because they told you the thing would do the thing.
---
You can always charge people to install them
---
lol, to be fair the pre-quest Travis was just funny because he was so awkward. Though I love how he goes from that to one of the smoothest fuckers on the planet overnight
---
I agree, I was hoping she would sound and be a little more serious honestly.
---
It’s a ton of fun - I’m not sure what exactly the stealth suit really does as far as stealth, whether it’s the stealth perks that keep me hiding or if it’s the invisibility of the stealth suit. Regardless, it’s very fun to use for following people, as well as the invisibility being fun, even if it doesn’t actually do anything.
---
Git gud.
---
I’m suspicious
---
LIES!
---
It also stacks with Super Duper
---
What weapon and build if I may ask?
---
I’m Jebus
---
I know a few people who have gotten bitten by this, including one person who lost a weapon that was in a wall display.
---
Second hand info, but people I'm fairly sure know what they're talking about.  Enough that I've removed all my displays and vendors.
---
Stronger Enemies = more damage = more durability lost in armor. If your build dosent allow you 2 equip White Knight, u should think about making adjustments for that. Also use Fix it Good which will overall make ur armor last a lot longer. And dont shy away from using the occasional improved repair kit (ontained in queen fights) in case ur not close to a bench to repair your stuff.
---
You can add beyond 15, u just don’t get perk card spots obviously. However this is the main issue with additive instead of multiplicative. As u gain more strength it has diminishing returns. So you’d expect it to do more but it’ll be less than you think. Worth a try tho if u wanna add to Strength. If you don’t like it, pull 5 points from strength to put elsewhere and keep the legendary card up. Can’t go back on that big expense.
---
Totally agree. Until about lvl 80 I didn't even hear about builds and such. Now I am lvl 160, I use both unarmed and heavy weapons, and I can get by pretty well (even after the update).
---
I mean, we don't KNOW it wasn't an intended mechanics for the debuffs to proc PvP. Maybe the devs really wanted people to be taking one for their teams. 😂
---
This has to be the best bug yet.
---
So would rather Bethesda spend time fixing a small seasonal event instead of everything else? Keep in mind the team on 76 isn't huge.
---
They are worth around a 30k value, I've traded a few in the trading sub. They are a rare drop from the queen, but they become more and more common since the queen fight is just spammed
---
You didn't lose too much, but you can probably charge a fair few caps or materials to install it on people's PA
---
Good, glad your here, I’ve got a long list of complaints you can give Dad!
---
It is pretty amazing, NGL.
---
Wdym?
---
Heavy weapons and 2h weapons!
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
GTA online radio doesn’t talk about events.
---
get those gains, brah.
---
Bruh. Was this me? 😂
---
Yes and no. It doesn’t work nearly as well as a silenced weapon. Super mutants and ghouls seem to often have a sixth sense where the group will detect you when you kill one of them. Even with like 40 agility and rank 3 sneak I still get detected a lot after killing something. SBQ is the one anomaly where you can just crouch under her and tee off while still remaining hidden. 
---
This patch really screwed with sneak melee though because the damage nerf and enemy buff means you will not be one shotting a lot of enemies even with a sneak attack. You don’t stay stealthed after hitting something like you can with a silenced weapon.
---
Yeah I knew it was old news just kinda wanted to voice it
---
It was kind of boring tbh. I could even solo ACP with that build, just stay in sneak out of fear range and kill Wendigo as they spawn. Took maybe 1k ammo.
---
I feel like the damage changes are a net positive, no one should be that powerful. We could have prevented the war by dropping 4 bloodied stealth commandos in Tiananmen Square.
---
The luck perks that repair armor and weapons are pretty amazing actually. I grabbed the luck legendary card and maxed it out. Took those cards and am almost always at max durability even after doing multiple ops.
---
Yeah I know that’s what makes it crazy
---
Just the usual poor QA.
---
There is no indication about it is ongoing or wait for start when you enter map screen.
---
I hate them so much, but I have found the best (at least for me) weapon to take them out. I have a 3* huge napalmer. Furious, 90% reduced weight, +40% bashing. I call it Fahrenheit 451. Anyway it will melt a mirelurk king in about 3 seconds. Wendigo too. Also Earle doesn’t really like it either. It just sucks to stand close enough to Earle to damage him with it.
---
Ok that was always allowed
---
You mean a build that is bad against a whopping 3 kinds of enemies in the game, none of which are at all common encounters, and one of which is basically always done with at least half a dozen others?
---
If it's fine for 99.99% of the game then it is fine. Behemoths ( which I've seen like 5 of total in hundreds of hours of gameplay ) and mirelurk queens aren't even hard to kill anyway.
---
I'm a min maxed PA build so I don't have an issue with taking some extra hits
---
Not quite, see my other comment
---
Not what happened to you, but I def killed a dude sleeping the other day. He had been at WSS and I already knew he procced, so before leaving server later that evening, I dropped by his camp and found him sleeping. Pretty sure I was level 16 then.
---
Not even gonna lie, my damage seems largely unchanged but holy shit the level 100 Ghoul that could tank 1 high from my DCG that 2 taps had me running for my life while I pull out my Handmade, that fucker took 2 full mags to die
---
And I loved it, I haven't felt like that since I was low level backtracking to kill enemies with a hunting rifle.. 
---
Even West Tek had me running for my money, had it hide more often and pick them off rather than streamrolling
---
I love the way they did it, turrets are level 50 now so they can defend better, defending your workshop is more challenging and fun now rather than 1 tapping, events are harder like Uranium Fever and that adds to the fun 
---
Hell, today I even successfully defended my workshop in PvP and that makes a change the nerf albeit heavy in some cases is a well worthwhile thing  
---
Easily the best update they've done, imho
---
The mob specific weapons and armor are now really useful. Daily ops made troubleshooter, mutant slayer, and assassins weapons viable choices. Hell, I still use a hunter's pump action like it's a god tier. It hasn't let me down. Instead of 1shot kills its 2 in vats. Like 4 out of it on most larger mobs. Mirelurk kings and queens can eat my ass though.
---
How did this build end up working for you? I'm actually looking to do something very similar to this (with a few tweaks) and was curious if you enjoyed it? Thanks!
---
Lol i knew about the bench i just thought it was you and a buddy using it as prescribed so didnt see the joke in that.
---
My bloodied .50 cal dropped about a third of its damage my furious .50cal dropped about a quarter of its damage
---
The weird thing about patch 22 is I'm harder to kill than ever before. I didn't drop below 50% health for the 10 minute long queen fight and didn't have any form of healing. And the sonic attacks it does in the air don't damage me enough to see my health gauge move
---
Hey guys, hate to bring up an old topic but anyone else having issues completing this quest after this last update? I think 22. I'm finding everything fine, and I followed a guy in youtube that is able to get passed where I am stuck. My issue is I can't get the first checkpoint for the quest "Go To Watoga Underground" to clear. I speak with Ronny, I get inside, I'm even able to find the terminal and open the garage door. But no matter what I do I can't get either the first one or the second one for the garage door to clear. I have tried everything including server hopping, I got fallout first for a month to get a private server, I hard reset my xbox and then my modem. I even tried an alternate entrance to Watoga Underground to see if maybe it was the door where Ronny is that has a bug. Nothing guys I'm super bummed out here on the last quest in the chain. It's my first playthrough so I'm on a cliffhanger here.
---
I would love to be able to pull a cowgirl with a medics lever action, but I definitely agree with this, it would be nice not to have to line up multiple headshots on a single scorched with my hunting rifle
---
Exactly how I feel, she’s sounds so weird to, like she is just hitting her teenage years.
---
For me it hasn’t been. I’m sure a lot of people have this issue on the regular but this was the first time it did it. I restarted my pc and now it’s fine.
---
Upvote for the brutal honesty. One Wasteland is a bit oxymoronic outside of the game itself, here on the subreddit. There is no in game text chat, so we gotta come here to sustitute. I think the game is brilliant in a way, as if this is all part of the plan to create some upheaval. To bring more attention to the game. Yeah some ppl are gonna say they uninstalled the game and quit to go play viva pinata or whatev, but watch. After a few hotfixes, certain things will be fine tuned and even after that there will be some other idiosyncasy that ppl will be upset with.... I know there is comfort in the way it was before. I know some ppl are justified in wanting trash mobs to be toilet paper. But I'm here for the spice. This def spices things up so fuck it make even more difficult idc lol
---
Military one?
---
Try inspirational and stacking a few buffs. I'm in the low 300 and can level up in two runs with a full team. I come out with more ammo than I went in with and plenty of chems to sell. It's an excellent event to farm imho.
---
The only time now I would deliberately face off with an Assaultron is when I'm launching a nuke or doing Encryptid. If my Bloodied hadn't been nerfed I could melee them with 2 hits, but now? Nope the f out! This nerf quite literally broke me.
---
You have to be so mad to put that much effort lol
---
Still not fixed. Purchased the game today. Worked fine for my gf but not for me.
---
No it's not possible. They don't "see" you do it so you're still in sneak doing the big numbers but their buddy just fell over next to them more than likely grunting and yelling lol they're gonna look around regardless. It's just up to you as a player to base your decisions on the changing combat environment in that specific situation.
---
You can get these 20% buffed to 25% with strange in numbers (since you got 20% from a relish, I assume you're playing on a team already) along with other effects like 8 int from brain bombs and 5 int from berry mentats. Not to mention +3 int (and all other special) from herd mentality mutation. All of this will net you 32% of additional xp from intelligence buffs only. I also added legendary int to my build asap, yet another 10%. And all these xp % numbers are buffed multiplicatively with double xp and lunchbox buffs (which could now be bought for 100 gold each as long as you have it).
---
So with almost no effort (except farming sugar bombs for brainbombs, which could be substituted by much easier to make brain fungus soup for a weaker +4int buff) you can get a literal shit ton of extra xp for everything you do.
---
I could not believe It i got killed at train station I thought they were safe heaven
---
this is a bug with the tesla rifle
---
Look at the pip-boy screen that shows your resistances. If you see a drop shape in the same line as your ballistic, energy, and radiation resistances, then it’s working.
---
The whistle in the dark is just the same survival gun with a new skin, at a waste of modules. What they were thinking with that one, who the fuck knows. 
---
 They actually made nocturnal more useless with this patch. As if that was possible. 
---
 They said they were bringing back the survival weapons, so looks like we're going to have to deal with the crappy survival weapons being rare rewards for events from now on.
---
And yeah it's pretty bad that the glaive can't be traded or the plan, probably because you buy the mods with gold bullion and the flagged the weapon as well.
---
I switched around perks, just had serendipity, dodgy, blocker on, and without power armour I was just standing there tanking blood eagles while searching on reddit for the signal repeater (which had bugged out and not appeared.) Never had any fucking AP, but I never died either.

---
Looks like the gun from the Wayward quest, the elusive crane. I can’t explain leveling with you though. Mine was sent to the scripper.
---
I dont pvp but I keep my pacifist mode off just coz, but I dont really whine much about pvp coz that is suppose to be part of the game.  Honestly I agree with ya there,  balance it for pacifist vs non pacifist, and if u have it off, u shouldn't be complaining u getting griefed just coz other players are playing the game.
---
I get it if the pvpers are finding exploits around getting thru pacifist mode, ivr encountered them and didnt really give a fuck, I mean I run around nood.  But thats understandable frustration.  Whats not is having pacifist mode off and whining coz some pvper found someone without the mode on.  Everyone gets alerted with a warning at ,lv5 thats pretty hard to miss.
---
however, for some, getting ganked by a bullet sponge ai vs player is different.  For one, one is bit easier to predict, expect and prepare for, while the other, as long as the other is also changing things up, is bit more dynamic.  However, enemy ai dont try and work with exploits, hacks, and spend all their life grinding and farming, so players (who r maybe similarly " skilled"/dedicated) can eventually beat the ai.
---
I can get the bugs and glitches or unintended features, but peeps gotta accept tthat 76 is not a singleplayer game (or single with optional online coop like me and most were hoping for) but we got what we got, and open pvp is part of it.   The rough parts in the fallout games have mostly been from ai and environment, 76 was meant to have other players fill that role.
---
Heck, some wont mind pvp but dont like how they can respawn close by for all eternity until one gives. Personally dont care, not like any of the ai waves are tough since their main goal is to give u a challenge and make u question whether its worth defending the camp.  Not really much if they squish like flies.  I dont even bother lol.
---
The armor only reduces damage from players.
---
seems like this board is run by sweaties now.
---
just try pistols and all mobs will be bullet sponges
---
Not everyone can be a Three Dog.
---
So many
---
First what’s the acp and second I realize that we didn’t need to be that powerful I mean at the height of my build I could kill the queen by myself but I think being that powerful is fun especially when you have exhausted the pve style I loved the pvp centers servers they were perfect for people with op builds to prove themselves being op was fun if not too necessary
---
You can get a recipe to build
---
I agree. I started playing and running a vats rifleman build. I am not high enough to have the commando perks yet. I had a hard time with large groups, but was able to two shot most enemies I casually ran into. Now absolutely everything takes four sometimes five or more shots. A large yao guai will take significantly more.
---
I have gone from being able to roughly break even with ammo (through crafting and converting) to just eating it. 
---
For the most part I like the release, but I think they didn't put enough effort into making sure some of the builds would be usable.
---
Great thank you!
---
Electric Absorption is 100% a must have for any PA user. You hardly need Fusion Cores or Healing depending on what you're fighting.
---
In like 7 hours of playtime I haven't went through a single Fusion Core. I ended up selling half of them that I had on my character because I don't see myself needing them.
---
Ohhhh but I thought it was cool as hell 😎
---
Where would I find it?
---
You need your helmet on to get the bonus from funky duds.
---
Yeah. Special daily ops plan called the Hemingway. 
---
The words won't kill them but definitely might hurt their feelings quite a bit.
---
I'll allow it.
---
Working for me.
---
Haven't seen any of the new stuff for sale in  a vendor yet. No idea what all's available.
---
(Just hope that it's tradable. The big pile of "No one else can have this" is super annoying.)
---
The Brahmin should have known better and spec’d into a PA tank build. How could they choose to be a killable build *and then proceed to die?*. 
---
-A portion of this subreddit
---
Very true. I use my gatling gun during them and yeah, I'll use 1 - 5 shots per enemy depending on my dumbass aiming and I get at least 10 - 60 back per enemy. It's awesome. 
---
I fought the queen earlier and lost about 600 rounds of 5mm.. did a Daily Op and have it back now.
---
So its fine that melee is shit but commando and heavy weapons can still solo them? They are the three endgame bosses. GTFO outta here with your 99.9%.
---
I thought I read something where they were planning on changing it, or maybe they already did. I have no idea.
---
Correct
---
It is super up in the air right now what the best primaries are for PvP. But hey! 
---
The thing PvE players don't realize about FO76 PvP is that it requires a LOT of testing to create new metas ESPECIALLY after a huge change to damage output. 
---
So, if you want to get better at PvP - get to testing. Don't rely on your own damage numbers tho. Have another player watch their HP in their pipboy to see what you actually are hitting for when comparing different effects. 
---
And make sure the person being shot doesn't have any damage mitigation perks like serendipity/dodgy or S/A armor equipped cuz it will make the testing inconsistent.
---
Yeah todays ops was easy and fun. Cleared it in 5 min with a random team today. Stay on the booster.
---
Well if you don’t want to use vats idk, if you think something is up with aiming maybe fiddle with your settings, or mods on weapons, there’s no perk that can help you with aiming though xD
---
If you want more dmg maybe the legendary perk follow through, will give your more dmg on a target that you hit while sneaking, and there’s a perk in perception that increases dmg while aiming, but other than that I think that’s about it lol
---
Yeah, they didn't mention it in the patch notes.
---
A Colossal Problem, the newer endgame event in Minongah Mines.
---
Indeed. Maybe they don't like switching pacifist on because the name of the mode makes them sound not as hard core as they think they are.
---
If you want some peace from other players, flick it on. Want to have a little scrum? Flick it off. Takes seconds to change any time you feel like it.
---
But they won't, and want normal mode to be Pacifist mode but with the ability to kill gimped wanted players for some easy caps, then brag about it like they're tough.
---
When did you purchase it? They have to verify it on their end. Usually takes a day or two
---
You're fundamentally wrong. In almost no situation will you make everyone happy but especially in an online multiplayer game. 
---
For some this will finally make the game great, for others it will be horrible and they'll leave. 
---
The circle remains.
---
I think you just got a bad group. Had one earlier today with a bunch of level 20s-40s. There’s should be at least a level 50 requirement.
---
Can you explain a bit about which features?
---
I hope they fix this fast. I am also a mid level gamer and with 2 days I am out ammo, stimpacks, and my gear is all broke. I love the story they added, but it’s not worth the frustration!!!
---
They might be in the future, but as OP has asked and I answered it currently only reduces damage from players. It says it right on the armor, while the weapon effect now appropriately labels damage to humans.
---
That perk is not reset, it'll still be whatever rank you ranked it up too, just inactive.
---
Queen fights have been faster because you can cripple her wings to make her land again.
---
I've noticed no difference with Earl really. Those go fast when someone has a magic weapon and they work the same as before.
---
Tell him to do it solo then. Last I checked, extra people don't add to the timer, or slow it down. They do give you better chances of success.
---
I could be wrong here, but it would surprise me if it takes a 3 man squad a longer time to do than the same 3 man squad with a 4th who is afk.
---
Yeah this. I find people’s issues with any games are all self centered. They play games that focus on things they don’t care about and then get angry a game doesn’t cater to them.
---
This advice isn't terrible, but I think you're basing it mostly on PS4. lol Idk one person that uses a QFFR tesla on xbox. lol Only scrubs think those are good.
---
Mine too. Had a mini heart attack when I saw 0 atoms
---
I think they should do Radio stations through the server
---
Yeah, pick something other than heavy weapons or shotguns and then find yourself a magic heavy weapon and/or shotgun. Bam.  More than 1 weapon type.   (Until they fix magic weapons at least)
---
It seems like it’s going through some maintenance. I see the same thing on XBox.
---
I’ll load up the game and the whole private sever is still locked as if I hadn’t had purchased it. On adventure mode I have no access to the survival tent and no atoms have been transferred to my account either.
---
Shop is down, it would seem
---
TSE weapons do more damage technically not just TS. It is most likely they revered the original change to TSE interactions and it’s bugged.
---
&gt;... with fewer but more powerful enemies. 
---
So, basically, normal gameplay for snipers right now? Where a half dozen head shots will work, if they don't see you and instagib you because they're more powerful?
---
Only thing I can think of is a special bonus where sneak attacks get a stupid high buff to damage during the op. Otherwise I can't imagine a scenario in an OP that is not favored by stomping through it in your power armor.
---
So jittery crackhead cannibal?
---
Gammas are annoyingly good right now tho, for sure cuz they fixed psychobuff. 😔
---
Maybe it's from where i was only sprinting between the objectives but I had zero issues with the freezing effect, i probably wouldn't of even noticed it if not for the frost visual.
---
This is a great write-up thank you for sharing. Reading through all the comments on here of people who have gotten no rewards, I'm now very thankful that I got the Brotherhood special ops helmet &amp; suit back-to-back and the plans for the War Glaive.
---
This is why I do them solo now, much more simple
---
I have a two shot version which was the first time using it in this game and it broke after the first reload from full condition...haha.

The Sunnytop Ski Lanes Base Lodge seems to pop a 2-star Super Mutant or Hound pretty often.
---
I lost a B/E/25 Fixer, B/25/25 LMG, AA/25 LMG, J/25 LMG, and more on Tuesday by using a private server to transfer between characters.  The server crashed and erased the items.  First time that's happened to me, and literally the worst time for it to.  Really makes you question continuing the play the game at all when something like that happens.
---
I *think* for the tent you have to activate it in the store first under the FO1st category and then place it by opening your favourite wheel 
---
The private server is weird though as is the atoms
---
Purchased it 25 minutes ago. Kinda crazy they can take my money as soon as I hit subscribe but it takes a day or two to get the service.
---
So you're asking me to provide a golden egg to prove my point that there's more than one way to skin a cat? I'm sure there's a name for that fallacy. As I already said, there's plenty of examples of balancing changes that bidders have already done. A guarantee you a lot of then could be adapted for FO76 if not directly lifted. Feel free to have a look at the dozens of examples others have already created. The Nexus would be a good place to start. There's plenty on there with creative non-sponge balancing changes.
---
I didn't say they weren't working, I said they weren't working well. Go to Charleston Capitol and take one. Then tell me it's working as intended.
---
Bethesda, please give our players a bad patch stimulus relief package!  I’m about to lose my beautiful home underneath the power lines. We don’t need it in weeks. We need it yesterday!
---
Have a great life!
---
As a melee I was able to solo it on elder my second try (first time was off by one minute). Then I ran it through and helped other folks the rest of the day, a couple runs out of power armor and on high rads. Over 8 ops I ran I died 2 times. Just take cover bro
---
I’m so sorry that happened
---
Yes, they retain the rank
---
Maybe everyone won't be happy but maybe they can make the game actually fun for most people. Instead of just making the game unbearable for a large portion of the playerbase. Some who have even had the game since launch
---
This happens to me on PS4. My friends can get on the shop while to me it says something about being closed to me randomly.
---
I have shitty internet so I just assumed it was that.
---
You mean the big giant blue box doesn't match your decor? It's kind of an eye sore.lol
---
Well the atom shop is down at the moment so no luck. Crazy they don’t have this subscription service figured out by now.
---
Well there's one, Well was once a BoS soldier now a deserter in Watoga.
---
Juicehead made a vid explaining how happy he is with the nerf not doing much to his weapons while the video shows him melting everything with his explosive flamer.
---
Neither behemoths or mirelurk queens are end-game bosses, they are just rare random enemies that drop nothing special, and only one of them has any chance of killing you ( and only because it has acid damage that basically ignores armor ).
---
Are you dying more than once every 5 months? Probably not. So don't whine about being underpowered when nothing is a threat to you, not oneshotting literally everything in the game doesn't make you weak.
---
That and commando / heavy weapons A) use ammo so have a bottleneck, and B) should be nerfed instead of everything else being buffed back to absurdity. The game needed some fucking difficulty, everyone running around immortal while one-shotting everything made content patches pointless as the balance was fucked for everyone.
---
It has a quest marker next to it, do you still have an active quest that could be related to it?
---
It'll be following your level as it gets readded to your inventory every time you login and is relative to your level.
---
goodbye one punch man build
---
This would make me really happy. Just a few options would be fantastic.
---
What tf I want a walkthrough of that sounds fun
---
Additional information: It will cost 1 Point to remove a perk card, no matter its level. Doesn't cost anything to put one back.
---
I suggest maxing out Ammo Factory and just putting it on when needed since the bonus is quite interesting.
---
Shop is a separate entity from the game.  It goes down from time to time while the game keeps on running.  Just wait.  It'll be back.
---
If the atom shop is down that could explain the issues you’re having then for sure. Very frustrating though and I sympathize
---
Lemme guess, it has either +50% limb damage, or +33% VATS chance, or one of your armour pieces has reduce dmg when blocking by 15%?
---
That’s what I mean! I’m a collector, and I think maybe a faction skin ( BoS, Enclave ) wouldn’t be half bad.
---
I'm one of those people who have been playing since BETA. I'm greatly enjoying the update. 
---
The posts have been pretty much the majority like the changes, here on reddit, on facebook, on discord, on the official forums.
---
.. so they have made it fun for most people. 
---
You're just not one of them.
---
The crazy part is that it’s multiplicative instead of additive. 
---
I gathered 600 Lead this morning and turned it into 9600 5.56 rounds.  Well worth the 300 perk coins.
---
Approved.
---
How about survival mode with a companion that can die? Oh yeah, and melee only. So many quickloads...
---
I agree,now every places in wasteland is my farming place lol,although my character got killed more tham before due to the high level enemies
---
For me its the little spider commie bots, no matter what their lasers usually two shot me while i can take a ton of hits from other enemies
---
My TS tesla does more damage than my bloody tesla. I wouldn't reccomend TS without the explosive for most other weapons tho cuz of accuracy. 
---
Why was I downvoted so hard for stating a fact? 😂
---
Daily ops: remove sneak perks, add adrenaline, GunFu, action boy, dodgy, even Evasive. Remove bloody mess, add ricochet. 
---
 I have successfully soloed all daily ops with vampire weapons, no specialised perks. It's about staying alive, not about causing damage. Enemies keep coming. Magic shotguns are the best second choice, since you oneshoot them.
---
I only had a problem with the minigun mutants. It's like they zero spread and every round hits you, + they same to be armor piercing and explosive. They tore me to shreds a couple times.
---
It would be great to have only action point refresh considering if you are in PA you have less AP and more AP consumption
---
Any recommendations / ideas?
---
The real problem is they missed the mark for lower level players at level 300 nothing really worries me except running out of ammo lol but if you're level 25-44 or a casual build that isn't built for combat game play is miserable
---
20 going on 10.
---
Atom shop is currently having issues/under maintenance.
---
I would assume this is related to that, try again in a few hours.
---
Depends pretty decent exp and im getting a lot of ultracite ammo from it, best is using my gatling gun i think I started with 500 and 2 days later looking at 4000 I love it not to mention guaranteed legendary at end
---
Hey this is great! I love how the lack of UI makes everything so much more intense.
---
The fuck? I thought I was going fucking nuts when my armor would break.
---
Glad to know I'm not the only one and it's not the radiation ruining my mind again.
---
Sweet thanks
---
Exactly the point. You people keep talking about your freaking built. That's all you worry about? The other feature of the game was massively affected by this in which is CAMP if they decided to buy like I did practically the whole shop and decor what's the problem. The game designed to be played as a survivor and other implement features that you . Meta forget to use yourself because it has no priority non other than Making your character god-like
---
And then BITCH easy or go nothing to do WHO exactly did the bitching first.? 
---
I've met some cool OP people. That I have respect for (you know who you are) and many that I haven't met that probably are as cool as the wind as well... Some are just straight up trash trying to bully anyone that is not up to  their par. Bring out the waaambulance for this oh my character is 5000 I can one shot the Moon!! I'm bored waaaa!!! It's to easy waaaa!!! Non hardcore players are ruining the game waaaa, why a low level is fighting EARLE WAAAAAAAAAAAA. I don't give a damn if level 10 is tagging along for the ride I helped them get their low level legendary,plans or whatever. instead of dismissing them.. and if you are a player that OP and help cuddos...another feature tended to be forgotten..
---
The first one to bitch and then have the gull to say to us stop bitching?? Hypocrisy at it's finest..
---
But you can shout "This is not a drill!" as it decapitates you.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGAiW5dOnKo
---
Should make a note that you can do the daily op on a different character for the reward as well, it's not account wide.
---
Same for me. I was mostly running from one objective to the next, and I only got hit twice.
---
That sucks. That happened to me once, but I didn’t mind much. I would just have to find something similar.
---
So after I move points to be tanky today, tomorrow I need to move points back to be stealthy in order to play new op? WTF are you thinking Bethesda?
---
Indeed, I completed 1 elder tier on a character and got 2 rare plans at once, so it is possible.
---
But that's pay to win 😢
---
Nope! It’s just a single star legendary. And I don’t believe I have one of those armor pieces on but I’ll double check. Do they have any bearing on the effectiveness of the Two-shot?
---
Any legendary that you can get from the purveyor will drop here. (must have the plans for specific ones)
---
Thanks. It looks really sweet when they explode ☺️
---
Headshots. Sneak. Crits. Ballistic bock. Small guns bobbles. Blight soup. Overdrive. Psychotats. Calmex. Mentats. Guns and bullets magazines. Mostly just the first three and I’m still single or double tapping everything. Nothing has really changed for how I play.
---
Well your TS Tesla May state more damage in the pipboy, but statistically the dps would be in favor of the bloodied weapons. TSE is just an outlier most likely cuz of being a bug. 
---
As for downvoted, Reddit gonna Reddit bud.
---
Maybe I got lucky today but we had a crew of 4..2 of our crew just stayed at the door and didnt help .I thought we had robots today so I rolled some ss troubleshooter armour for nothing.still was able to get through without dying. I ran my bloodied build and my team mate was full health and wrapped it up in 7:40 on our first try.the freezing part sucked more than anything though.we just didnt pay no mind to the mobs.straight to the repair thingy
---
I’m pretty sure I have this exact weapon in my Stash but I’m on Xbox. I wish this game was cross compatible sometimes... well all the time.
---
No, it just cost 1 perk coin to remove it.
---
I understand the dissatisfaction completely! But it is only day 3 and you still get a bunch of nice rewards from other ranks for completion even repeated runs, hang in there you got this and it will be all the more sweeter when you do land the pieces your after
---
Correct, once per character, per day. Ran 3 today across 3 different characters.
---
I played the beta. I bought the game at launch too. I'm not someone who picked it up on sale a month ago. Again I'm not saying they have to revert back just find a middle ground.
---
I'm really not looking forward to the Civic Center as a possible Ops location.  My frame rate drops to 5 in there.
---
Saaaammmmeeeee
---
TS limb is meta. You just have to know how to use it. 
---
Don't tell nobody. 🤫😂
---
So this absolutely worked for me.  Just ran through 3 daily ops and everything was working like you would expect.
---
I went as far as unequipping all perks and legendary perks, then putting all my guns and armor in my stash, ran around my camp in my undies then logged off, ended application, shut down the ps4, then started back up about a minute later.  Everything was as it should be.  I only swapped a couple perk cards.  
---
THANKS!
---
not elder? shame on you, paladin.
---
I would love to Cross platform PS4 to Xbox. PC though...is a different story.
---
Holy shit thanks for that i was struggling alot with lead. If its not too much to ask can i know where you farm gunpowder cause these two components are typically my bane when it comes to farming
---
then why comment?
---
My bad, elder is what I got.
---
Investigating an issue with the atomic shop.
---
https://bethesda.net/en/status
---
What low level places has surprised you guys now with the update? For me its grafton dam its so quick that event now for good exp, bricked myself as a bloody heavy gunner though when I was doing beanstalk and all those mole rats and stinging appeared at lv 50 though XD I think i might swerve campfire tales
---
Smh dick. Why would u bother commenting
---
It’s the same thing on Xbox. 6 daily ops teams and no one doin it.
---
A question was asked that's why tough guy
---
Yep. I'm not going to risk it though....
---
Know what else is suspiciously missing... CAMP interiors.  :(
---
Lol it’s not a secret. Limb damage bugged for shotguns as well. So is the blocking attribute on armor. So stating your TS bugged damage Tesla as being better than bloodied objecting is false. My b25 handmade still melts enemies. I’ve actually just been using NW weapons cuz their damage wasn’t nerfed.
---
And then they took a dump on you.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I am using ammo factory to make 308, which sells well, gives me caps and lets me buy those power armor plans I will never use, but I need to have.
---
By using a magic shotgun, I am entering daily ops with 300 shells and walking away with maybe 1000. Win-win, if you don't count the repair kits I used against those fucking gutsies.
---
Ohh fuck yea
---
Haven't pistols always been useless? Not gonna argue against them having a role but all weapons were nerfed. No matter your build you have to be able to throw on some PA and tank some damage in certain situations now. It adds to immersion IMO. It's the apocalypse. You can't realistically sneak around and surprise one shot every threat.
---
So... you’d rather spend hours and hours farming ammo just to get a little bit more back than you used, instead of using 300 points on a good card when there’s very few other legendary perks that are worth it
---
Same.only time I was froze was waiting for the big baddie in the end
---
you're talking about a JE laser *rifle*, correct? because it takes me several shots from a flamer to kill one of the radiation rumble ghouls.
---
that JE is also probably bugged as it behaves like shotguns, and it's magic. being J and all. I'd wager that's what's doing most of the heavy lifting rather than demo expert.
---
more importantly, how the hell does it not break on you? in radiation rumble of all things?
---
That really sucks actually. I did not realize that flamers were in such bad shape. I was thinking about having an alt play as a pyromaniac once I unlock the hellfire power armor. That really sucks.
---
Same ones they have for stash boxes. Crates, foot lockers, metal box. Maybe ones like 50s style lunchboxes with Unstopables or Grafton Football themes.
---
Is your brother having fun?
---
Oh that’s spectacular that you can equip it again at max. I did max ammo factory. It’s pretty awesome.
---
I was hoping they’d add more dialogue this season.
---
Me either. It's not worth a ban.
---
Ty appreciate the feedback.
---
Multi-shot weapons seem to be the way to go now too: splitter laser rifles are doing solid damage once you focus on headshots, and whilst critical hit damage seems to be a bit wonky at the moment their real value is in guaranteeing the hit.
---
Ammo always sells. Ammo is never a bad investment in this game.
---
Once I tried to stay on top of a car to shot down a bear, I just panicked and shot the car and kaboom, press space to respawn
---
I don't PVP, but it would probably make sense to ditch Nuclear Winter if it's not that popular anymore. I feel like I vaguely remember PVP servers shortly after release, but I don't know for sure.
---
Lucky. I’ve gotten elder 3 times and all I’ve gotten was a shitty burrows signs plan and a shitty V94 stash box plan
---
assuming I read it right, he's using a magic legacy. laser rifles behave the same as shotguns. and his is magic, being a **J**E.
---
so that's what dealing the brunt of the damage, not demolition expert or the legacy part. I get nowhere near the same results with a BE flamer.
---
don't mean to be a D but most people complaining about OP things are misinformed 99% of the time. these topics do more harm than good.
---
From the silo you were in? They were there with you?
---
Fallout first is not worth the money (I play solo but like people, so not solo server, plus public groups are my favourite addition to the game) and especially so because the scrap box isn't account wide and the game doesn't have a bank. Every mmo has a bank that shares between characters. Even some have shared inventory slots for those items too good to use on one character (like GW2, as a paid or rewarded bonus). 
---
I woulda bought first for a month if scrapbox was accountwide. I wouldn't get it for shared bank if that became a thing though, as that should definitely be a given thing even if it's a limited number of spaces shared.
---
I mean you can make a type to be hero, but you can't make all other types unplayable!
---
Alright. I'm listening. So what does that middle ground look like?
---
They have already said that they're looking at adjustments, especially towards middle game players who seem to be hit the hardest with the changes. (Lvl 25-49) and are looking to do other hot fixes etc.
---
As for higher lvl players, especially lvl 100+ I don't think middle ground makes sense to slant the damage curve towards what people who have no defined build, playstyle or poorly choosing weapons and gear. 
---
So if we can see what people can do who are your minmax types and consider that as the high threshold, then someone with no defined playstyle in the real world would be relatively weak as they are in the game. Doesn't make the game unplayable, just more accurate. 
---
For people who kinda are focused and have spent some time on it but don't want to minmax and like some QoL perks and gear then they're going to be your mid tier that most fall into and that's going to be the group they're likely to look at balancing.
---
Just out of interest what makes it better in your point of view? I never really used to bother with buffs but its so easy to make cranberry with gourds at my house. Is carnivore pretty easy too?
---
I'd love some changes too, but I've gotten to the point where I just stream a Spotify playlist of Fallout songs with some songs that should be in Fallout, but aren't.  No DJ to worry about.  Although there are some 24-hr Youtube streams that have dedicated DJs that are similar to Fallout also.
---
Another option: Maybe the radio ally that we got can actually be useful and be a new radio station DJ?
---
Tesla shotguns do not use shotgun perks.
---
What about backpacks as well? Not the carry weight but the mods affecting PA.
---
I hate jumping into PA with my 2nd character and being overweight because I got 1 str and use chemist backpack for chem weight reduction. Them stims are heavy af.
---
Didn’t notice that. Maybe you need different gear, or to fix up your build?
---
Rank 1 is more than enough. I’m sitting at 5 (rank 1 limit) and get one every 30 minutes. I usually get one before the food or drink bars turn red. I’m tempted to dump all food and drink now because the legendary perk made them unnecessary.
---
Yup. Someone already made a complete spread sheet about this and what you get with each level of the legendary card. 
---
Search the thread to find it.
---
I played around with vats and did pretty decent 2-3 shot kills but I had to be right up on the target (I was using a mutant shotgun with +33 vats hit)
---
The daily ops are great, unless you roll nothing for rare even tho you got Elder.
---
If I played with the t.v on mute I wouldnt mind my gun noises being displayed..lol
---
Na. Pistols were awesome!! Especially with weaker enemies.. used it all the time harvesting ammo for other weapons... and I understand making it a little bit challenging but if that’s ur argument y throw every enemy at level 50 when “realistically” there’s gonna be weak mid and high level enemies all around.. and if a level 200 something dies from an explosion would a level 50 get demolished?? See.. this nerf makes no sense.
---
Yeah, my low level uses a workshop laser. Puts out way more damage than anything else I got. 
---
I think the armor requires VATS and I'm always only talking bout PvP when I comment on here. 
---
But I disagree that just cuz it is bugged when used a specific way means it isn't better. I mean, it kills faster. That's all that matters. 
---
And it does read higher damage in the pip. I don't understand what you mean bout the DPS for bloody cuz it's a tesla. The shots hit. Accuracy doesn't matter that much.
---
I got them today too, plus a jumpsuit plan. I built the reactor, looked at it for a while, triumphant, and then stored it, because it's ugly as fuck and does not match my minimalistic, immersive bunker camp.
---
Nah I don’t need it but thanks
---
They were there not for long maybe a month before the people trying to farm on the pvp specific servers stated crying they advertised it as being a high risk high reward for people who wanted to farm but also good for people who wanted to show off and them doing what I’m suggesting would keep a lot of the farmers happy because they wouldn’t have to deal with the pvpers so much
---
Herd mentality with its special boost gives a tiny boost just for being on a team, it's seems that soloists should aim for high charisma, tenderizer is the best soloist bet to up that damage beyond the usual builds
---
Found today easier than the robots yesterday...
---
Would save from having to do testing and repeatedly posting about the same thing, tis all sir.
---
Beat me to posting this
---
They aren't?  Are you sure?  Is house building not a core element of both 4 and 76.  Clearly they are making an active attempt to attract people who want to have a sim like experience.    
---
I don't get why people can't see that there's no "right" way to play any game, but even that said 76 IS designed with those kind of people partially in mind.
---
I have like five of those masks, and they sell weirdly well. I put one for 10K and someone bought it within the hour.
---
That's weird. Both events that I have done multiple times have finished the same or quicker than pre nerf. My understanding is that lower levels can now contribute, so there is some additive damage.
---
Cool you don't have to agree, not everyone plays the game like you do.
---
Yeah, it's pretty easy to get elder solo.  I'd like a rank at 6 or 7 minutes
---
Not going to lie, would love to get something like that. Would add more character to my raider character.
---
Yea I was so pumped to get back into the game with the update.  Fallout games are some of my favorite, all of them.  And I genuinely enjoyed 76, even like a year ago before the current updates.  It just got to a point where it was so difficult I couldn't continue without raging.  I don't play video games to get mad.  I'm the person that plays casually.  I don't grind...I like story and reading terminals and lore and the occasional moderate challenge fighting a boss or something.  I play games on the easiest or second easiest difficulty because of that.  So I was hyped that this update would actually open up dozens of quests and map areas in Appalachia I haven't even tried to go to.. and today I quit after 30 minutes since I was getting absolutely destroyed by a enemy that was the same level as me.  It was a level 36 diseased mirelurk king.  It hit me once and took away like 80% of my health and then the disease sapped the last 20% and killed me all within like 5 seconds.  The like 2 shots I got off on it with my best gun took away like 10% of it's health.  It's literally unplayable now.
---
Maybe if you dont return it ...its invincible? I'll def try this on my low level
---
With daily ops I don’t even need flux, I get more ammo than I spend.
---
Well that’s ok, happens all the time and I rather do testing anyways
---
I've died in a nuke zone after the queen was killed, and when I respawned I had all my junk on me, including stable flux.
---
Why is that a slap in the face ?
---
You should have a nuke holotape that shows you which nukes were used or not. Unless ofc you threw that away.
---
I doubt 6 minutes is possible lol
---
TS on Tesla doesn’t act the same way as Ts on a normal weapon is what I’m saying. So dps wise bloodied most likely is doing more over time. Same reason why TSE Tesla is actually shit versus multiple enemies cuz it acts like a normal gun and damage doesn’t arc.
---
Creating my own group never seems to activate Strange in Numbers, even after people join.
---
With my Bloodied Power fist my first Daily ops was the first day with resilient bots and even tho I was solo I still cleared it in 9:35.
---
It was incredibly fun. Fast, furious and chaotic. It would have been awesome with leveled enemies.
---
I don’t mind scary death claws... I do mind a bloat fly that can take multiple shotgun blasts to the face...
---
Has anyone tested if Liquid Courage is affected by party person and happy go lucky? I know it is technically a post-war alcohol, but if the pre-war alcohols are brewed at the station, they are still affected by the perks.
---
If so, Courage is the strongest luck booster in the game, with a + 6.
---
I want to be able to actually go and find her
---
I don't have this experience. Maybe I need to go Bloodied to get my damage per bullet up, maybe it's because I don't always loot the bodies so that I can complete the Op at top speed. 
---
Ammo Factory has been a worthwhile investment for me, it's great to keep my Handmade fed. Though that being said I haven't invested any coins in it yet, just the slot that would have otherwise been empty.
---
Why not either use a generator inside the structure, or use the wire glitch where you place a power node on a floor mat and then move the mat?
---
Yep - posted this yesterday, but the more posts the better.
---
Those effects are known as "Magic Effects" that make weapons do obscene amounts of damage in VATS as long as they have around 200 ROF, or are shotguns.
---
3 days in and I haven't had any luck with the rare items. Finished all 3 in under 6 mins. My main is cursed. I swear.
---
I'm not sure where I got it but I bet if you check peoples stores regularly you would find it. I feel like I've seen people selling it. Or add me my gamer tag is the same as my reddit account.  I'll be in tomorrow and I'm pretty sure my mule account has a few off them.
---
Witch!
---
+40% power attack and Swing speed share the same legendary slot, so it had to be one or the other.
---
Possibly, but the real benefit is that I can switch to a gun ideal for almost any occasion. Bloody if my health drops, instigating and exterminators, a bug gun, a super mutant gun, exploding bullets, gauss, they're like Pokemon. Gotta get them all.
---
Stop crying bb
---
Yes
---
Im just glad others are noticing
---
Idk yet. Havent tried
---
No, the quests are still there, no idea why you didn't get one though. 
---
It wouldn't make sense for a successful group to totally cold shoulder you out like that, there's always conflicts, even among "allies". 
---
Meg is a pro at getting the most out of untrustworthy people, and the settlers live in the present and build forward, with Ward "keeping an eye on you", lol. He put his past behind him. Would be weird for either group to pass up free help.
---
I remember trying fo76 for the first time and thinking “oh man, I bet they update the radio host on the regular so you don’t always hear the same stuff!” 
---
:|   Feels like this has the least unique voiceovers of any previous title.
---
Fair points. I agree, that mobs are predictable, while players are dynamic.... That's what I like about the player PVP aspect.
---
But regardless of someone being level 50 or level 600, we're all using level 45-50 weapons with varying legendaries and perks to make things different.
---
But mobs scale beyond just level 50, so technically players should be easier to take on, especially since weapon damage has been recalculated and PVP has been restricted to just 1 on 1..... As opposed to a hoard of level 70 scorched.
---
Exploits most certainly need to be addressed, 100%. If I switch to pacifist, I certainly don't want to be attacked while in that mode.
---
But nerfing PVP and handicapping wanted players to the point they really can't defend themselves isn't the way to resolving these issues.
---
As you said, it's an online game and PVP was a part of the game from the start. One of the big selling points of using nukes was to attack other players, and not just farming mobs for legendary weapons.
---
You can still nuke other players, of course, but right now, that's about all you can do.
---
Initiating PVP puts the initiator at a disadvantage because by the time PVP activates, the other player is already trained on the initiator and unloading on them.
---
Workshops, on PC anyways, seems to be similar. Some say on PS4 there's a button you can hit to contest, but I don't know what it is on PC, so the one who wants to contest has to go and plop their money into the red workbench, which leaves them exposed and wide open to the other player.
---
Or the owner is halfway across the map and by the time they fast travel back, it's taken, so no PVP.
---
The solutions to some of these issues are tricky, I admit, but it's current form is flawed and not viable for those who actually want to PVP.
---
I think you don't start to run into massive hp mobs until around 25 or 30, the mob hp starts to spike, but you don't have the additional dmg perks or higher base damage weapons. Your ROF on high base dmg weapons you typically have access to at low level is crap and stuff like anti armour/ffr is HUGE if you can get your hands on any legendary weapons. Literally any AA or FFR weapon you get becomes your goto. 
---
My lv 27 was running a 1 star stalkers handmade before the patch, no dmg perks(making a mule char), and just running around the forest like a god. After the patch, it was doing like half as much dmg to forest mobs, grabbed a lv 25 somerset which would 1hko mobs that took me a clip or more with my handmade.
---
We need a *go buy a mic you cheap ass and turn it on and use it* emote
---
Okie dokie. At least others will know about it as
---
It is very detailed and rather well done. I will say though....if you are going to post about testing something, it would help to post your results lol.
---
"So you're asking me to provide a golden egg to prove my point that there's more than one way to skin a cat?"
---
I was asking you to consider the context I laid out for the point I was making previously.
---
Simply put, I don't think there's enough scope in a shooter system for sophisticated changes to produce a robust challenge that can please everyone in a multiplayer persistent world. The enemies will invariably end up either being really hard to kill, or killing us really fast, and while the latter is the result of most good balancing mods for 4 and puts more pressure on the player to approach the fight wisely, that in no way means that outcome would be enjoyed by 76 players.
---
The same people saying they're low level or casual will be just as pissed or more pissed if they were being dropped in seconds instead of having to burn ammo for kills.
---
Could you have two groups of two split up to take both objectives at once?
---
I don't know why I let myself get hyped up for anything anymore.
---
I was solo in it and managed to get elder. But I was pretty close due to that freeze almost cost me that run.
---
I found out freeze effect stacks and makes you extremely slow if you get pounded by 20 super mutants shooting their machine guns.
---
I’ve gotten the signs every time :(
---
I tried to do it with my unarmed bloodied ninja, the one who used to smack Earl for 1600 points of damage with no drugs.
---
I caused him 60, 56,56, 56... And I just logged off. I am going to kill that character. I can't see him like that.
---
Beth has listened to the squeaky wheel...what sucks is that the player base they listen to moves on way before they implement these changes so in the end the ones who enjoy this game are the ones that get the short straw,the shaft or what one might say. The sh!ty end of the stick.
---
Camp plans as in the stuff you get from taking workshops, defending workshops. I think it would be pretty obvious why that's a slap to the face when you can only run these once a day, per character. They should've never been a drop for anyone over 50.
---
I have too many mules to list, and I have been using an instigating harpoon gun. I did flechettes without any shotgun perks, and it destroys. Plus I get free ammo. You have to be strategic with multiple attackers, but it's a ball.
---
Yes it works in pa and you really only need rank 2
---
Four toons for me, so four elder runs in a row per day to maximize chances. Im on the side of things where I figure it can’t be that rare because I have it already and therefore not worth anything special in trade. But it looks dope so I’m keepin it.
---
There are benifits to playing an online game solo, just because you don't party up with people doesn't mean that you don't enjoy running into other players, shopping at vendors, doing an occasional event with a group of strangers.    
---
Plus it's not like 76 cant be enjoyed as a single person game.    
---
Also I wasn't describing myself to be clear, I just accept that not everyone plays the game like I play it or how I think it should be played, and thier experience isn't invalid because it doesn't match with mine.
---
Oh okay my bad mine is still down is yours
---
Will do, but this is  more me playing this update for the first time and just sharing ima go make some 308 ammo because it’s still not enough for my Lmg until I fully upgrade the perk
---
For me this game has never, ever been easy.
---
I have been lurching and stumbling my way through this game since December 2018. I don't have a particular build.. I always seem to have the wrong weapons and most of my time has been spent dying.
---
I am currently level 214. the funny thing is that since the update I have leveled up four times, and I've made amazing progress on the legendary run... Unlike last season which was a disaster for me. Yesterday I did special ops solo and I didn't die.. the same thing today. I'm only at the rank of I think, it's an initiate.. so definitely nothing special, but the point is, a month ago I couldn't have even accomplished this. I must admit though I find it disturbing to be killed by a level 50 mole rat, even more disturbing to encounter level 100 mutant hounds, that drop absolutely nothing special... And then there's the indignity of being killed by a random blood bug! 
---
Other than that I'm not finding this any more difficult than it was.. and I am enjoying it, go figure.
---
&gt; maybe it's because I don't always loot the bodies so that I can complete the Op at top speed
---
You can stay and loot them all before leaving. That's what I do.
---
The "Excavator power armor" + "The Lucky hole Mine " may solve your problem. Make some research about it. ✌👋
---
Probably cuz he lost it and was going off the top of his head
---
You and what's left of the playerbase, friend
---
Does the armour underneath have to match for it to work or just the pa? I might have to lose it if that's the case as my arm is a camo jetpack XD
---
Thanks
---
On of the community managers responded to a post about this earlier, said they didn’t have the event on the calandra because they hadn’t fixed the bugs from **last year**.
---
Edit: [link to CM comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iulnan/mischief_night_halloween_not_on_2020_roadmap_still/g5mnznr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)
---
Hi! We know that lots of you had a blast with Mischief Night last year (we did, too!) We love this event and how it brought the community together to raise a little mayhem at the Whitespring. However, there are still some outstanding bugs from last time, and so it's not currently on the schedule for this year. We are discussing having another event in its place so that you can still celebrate Halloween in Appalachia with your fellow Dwellers.
---
I got two ranks of the antivenom and two ranks of the fireproof one. 100 and 100 for each. I feel solid and take no damage from Mirelurk queens and other annoying enemies. Fire and explosions cause ZERO damage. That means bye dense, hello ultralight or jetpack.
---
When two dogs are not enough, and four is too many, it’s Three Dog!
---
He was the absolute best.  Kinda anti-climactic when you meet him in person, though (not the guy himself, he’s fine, but the fact that the quest line doesn’t really make all that big a deal out of it).
---
People don't know what they want. They want a challenge, but a challenge that they can win. They want quests and factions, not too many or quest that don't have a guide. They want build variety, but keep making "meta builds" that some youtuber says are op.
---
Alright, I spoke to soon.  Playtested some early today, it's a lot harder but not impossible.
---
You said even if it were blueprinted. I have the blueprint and my extremely merged camp is just fine.
---
Gauss shotgun user here. Ad Victoriam brother.
---
No it doesn't matter. As long as you have a full set of matching pa armor then it should work. And I also have  that jetpack arm
---
Yes because it has to be fuck them or nothing.  You can serve multiple sub sets of players at the same time.  It's not like this is a novel concept, there are many games that incorporate a hard core combat experience and a more relaxed monster hunting, crafting, socializing experience.
---
Good question...
---
Or they'll just add them to the loot table for a treasure Hunters event right around Halloween. Who knows at this point
---
I would be cheering you who cares about extra stims its about the time
---
You are very welcome
---
Yeah there needs to be a tiny percent chance at a rare reward even if if you beat elder otherwise the incentive to play outside of farming ammo is low. 
---
I’d play this mode all day if there were a chance at the rewards but the truth is log in, get elder on first try, get no loot, logout.
---
Guess that type of game loop is good for the servers. :/
---
I’m fine with the way the game is atm. But I do hate it when a 3 star mob drops a 1 star equipment. I would love to see that changed.
---
My Unstoppable Monster went from everyday 5K punches to 340. It's embarrassing. Bye unarmed melee.
---
Hi, do you have the línk of the publication?
---
Rngesus is a cruel bastard.
---
Same with my Bloodied/FFr one, 1 mag and breaks.
---
One ask for clarification - “Only get them once every 24 hours”. Is that 24 hours based on a specific daily reset time (eg when the daily op changes or when Atomic Shop and dailies change at noon) or is it 24 hours since you started (or finished) your last daily op. Sorry but with method and logic on “resets” being so friggin inconsistent in the game (eg 20 hour reset for script vendor stations too) it’s worth clarifying.
---
I don’t but my friend does. He doesn’t do reddit tho. Recently changed his bow over to a fixer though. Prior tho, his bow was only rivaled by a gauss rifle. No idea what it looks like after the patch but I’m sure it’s probably in the same place.
---
Damn looks like that perk is useless until i complete the set XD thankyou sniper haven't seen anything on the details of this perk cheers for clearing it up for me
---
Marsupial Mort at the wayward
---
I've thought about them making the level scaling gradual. To ease newer players into it and give people time to revamp and actually work towards builds. Like me at lvl 42 who has already been working towards a melee build and now has to pretty much chnage all my special and perks around to something else that would be better suited for the new update. Before the update ghouls in the forrest would be like lvl 5 mostly. Why can't they scale up to lvl 20 in the forrest and lvl 42 in the bog. Then for a lvl 80 the ghouls will be like around lvl 70 or so. By the time you hit 100 full level scaling is in effect and higher level players get the challenge they want.
---
listed in my shop...let me see if it is still there
---
It seems like the exact opposite to me.  People who are fighting to survive are seemingly not enjoying themselves..  the people who aren't unhappy with the change are largly the ones who were already top tier and haven't been so effected.
---
I’m using white knight maxed and Gunsmith maxed and I just fought the scorchbeast queen for 18 minutes and all my guns broke. ALLLLL MY GUNS. plus 2 pieces of armor. That’s never happened before this update.
---
I legitimately have had even less of an issue fighting enemies after the update. 3 bullets to a ghoul, 4-5 to a Blood Eagle, 2 for most animals, 6-9 for a super mutant, and a Deathclaw still dies in seconds. I don't even have absurd damage bonuses active. Idk if the fact that my damage buffs are so low has anything to do with it, but that's the only thing I really do differently from other endgame players, it seems.
---
Those radio stations have quite a bit more limited content than FO76, it’s just that that are 20 different ones to choose from, plus you can play your own music files if you want. (The announcements on that station are hilarious, all about how egotistical you are for only wanting to hear your stuff, and how their job is to DJ a station with only one listener).
---
Anytime mate🖒
---
I don’t farm gunpowder. I collect it when I come across it but I make my own as needed. 
---
For Cloth, the Professor’s House is awesome. Also Collision Course for the 100 Prewar Money.  I’m at about 3k Cloth right now since I’ve been slacking a bit. 
---
For Acid, there are a lot of places to farm that, but Bloodbugs are awesome for it too. I just ran Campfire Tales and got 25 Proboscises (50 Acid). Silva Homestead also has some chlorine bags as well. And my camp is at an Acid Node, so that’s 10 everytime I swing by. I’m at about 8k Acid. 
---
Lead is really the only resource I need to actively gather.
---
Most all recipes I use are [Random Meat]x1 and [Wood]x1. Four differnt scorchbeasts meats cook into 7.5 End/Int/Agil and damage resist. My base is near a large RadStag spawn and that food is 50 carry weight. Honestly all I noticed is the XP food is a little tuffer to craft then the relish.
---
I genuinely don't understand their angle here, though. So they've had a year to try to implement solutions for what wasn't working, or if they always intended just to scrap the whole thing, why not be transparent with your players and make a clear announcement long before everyone got excited? I sort of resent that I wouldn't have a clue what's going on in this game without actively using Reddit and seeing posts from other frustrated players. 
---
I am so tired of recycled content.
---
Not surprising in the slightest. Fastnacht came out broken, so has almost every "patch." Even so, it's sad to see this game remaining in such incompetent hands. And maybe the hardcore fans will blame Covid or something, but they've released the past two patched despite covid, which included a new event and daily ops. 
---
There's no excuse, besides idiocy.
---
If someone is in the silo with you and they get on the launch controls before you then yes they can launch the nuke instead of you. It’s pretty stupid that’s possible but it isn’t unheard of.
---
When the timeline was released early this year BGS couldn't have anticipated Covid would be what it is. Given the studio is in Texas nobody is at the office and productivity has massively decreased. It's explicable
---
You use your left hand to put on and take off the glove.
---
I love this idea
---
Thanks for the confirmation! That blows. Im gonna have a bad time in the daily ops when the blood eagles are up until that's fixed
---
Yeah I'm on Xbox and mines offline as well. Game just crashed trying to load into a public server too. Trying to play a little after a twelve hour work day...
---
The first time it happened yesterday, I thought it was just repeating the same thing over and over.  Today, I saw it count up from rank 1.  The thing blocking your aim needs to be moved to a corner especially with this bug.
---
I've tried just about every other type of legendary effect since the update, and I can tell you that I have changed my build to junkie, plus invested heavily into legendary perks, like "follow through" great for stealth junkie
---
Yes but I still have all my atoms
---
Gunsmith (IIRC) in INT at level 5 is... amazing. Basically, you almost never have to repair a gun. Any gun. That combined with White Knight in AGI ... means you can run for almost ever without dealing woth repairs. Throw in that LUCK perk where when your armor is struck, it repairs. Awwwwww yeaaahhhhhh
---
There’s new camp items in the game though. Like a bed of nails and an animatronic clown
---
Why they don’t have a frigging instrumental bluegrass station is totally beyond me.  They could so easily just pick a bunch of public-domain classics and pay some pro musicians to just jam on them.  It would be lore- and setting-correct to boot.
---
The PC modders have one or two pretty great radio station replacers.  A big smile crosses my face when I get to hear ‘Big Iron’ followed by ‘The Wanderer’, and ‘Little Runaway’ in quick succession.
---
Which, truth be told, makes it a very *realistic* radio station.
---
I have fireproof 3, an asbestos chest and two ranks of sizzling style. Because fuck fire damage. 
---
Also, there aren't too many great perks in Endurance, and my other sets of armor don't have asbestos. 
---
I am 90% sure this combo explains why I received ZERO damage during Daily Ops with Eagles exploding and using flamethrowers on my face.
---
Hunting rifle and lever are low end weapons. What we need is new weapons, like the battle rifle from NV.
---
PVP is initiated when both players land a hit. If you both accidentally shot at one another, the system still triggers PVP and full damage. When one of you dies, the winner collects the PVP Cap reward and of course any junk you dropped.
---
When you die, you have the option to seek revenge, so when you spawn again, PVP is still on. If you just spawn and don't seek revenge, they shouldn't be able to keep doing damage to you.... just don't shoot back at them, otherwise PVP triggers again.
---
Originally when you were out of PVP, anybody who shot at you only caused a reduced amount of damage to you, but they patched it now so if you shoot at another player, you do zero damage, no matter how many times you shoot them, but the PVP window will pop up warning you it will activate if you shoot back. Then it's a free for all.
---
They also set it now so it should only be a 1 on 1 PVP and their buddies can't jump in, unless you start shooting at them too of course.... which is possible in a closed in area and they're nearby while you're shooting the other guy &amp; a stray bullet lands.
---
If you don't want to get involved in PVP, go into your settings, then gameplay, and switch on Pacifist Mode, which makes it so nobody can attack you and you can't attack them. They can shoot at you all day but nothing will happen other than them wasting their ammo.
---
Note that if you enter a workshop area and another player contests the workshop (wants to take it over) it will trigger PVP, regardless if you're on Pacifist or not.
---
Don't seek revenge unless you think you can win. Turn on pacifist to avoid PvP altogether.
---
Only to those who won’t stop touching themselves 
---
And booger eaters. He hates booger eaters. More than masturbators.
---
It should be 100%/75%/50% because we all know RNG in Fallout 76 is pure butthole.
---
Magic weapon?
---
What's wrong with... wanting the best rewards?
---
Wait what?
---
See edit
---
Yeah, I also have zero atoms.....just kinda....holding my breath on this one....
---
Do that bullshit before you go in
---
To be honest the assassin prefix, even with the change to damage human npcs is essentially worthless. 10% damage buff is kinda crap, I mean nocturnal gives you a higher damage bonus. 
---
I would suggest maybe trying to find unyielding, bolstering, vanguard armor whichever suits your build. And try to get the sentinel or cavalier armor  to reduce damage. If you go in with the daily op groups you shouldn’t have too much trouble.
---
Magic shotguns still work fine. I tested  a quad double barrel earlier and it was taking down max supermutants no problem in 1 shot.
---
Love the update. Makes the game worth playing.  Wish every fallout scaled. God mode is laaaammmmeeeeeeee
---
So when is perk loadouts coming?
---
No pistols were awesome from level 10-40 from day one and after that you had to decide what good weapon class you wanted. Not much has changed. Pistols were never viable SBQ weapons.
---
Rose is fucking useless.  Literally 5 minutes of unfunny dialogue, repeated ad nauseum, without even any songs to break it up.  I’d rather listen to the Responders distress call.
---
Yes on PC
---
Mr. New Vegas &gt; Every Fallout Radio Host
---
Not a bad idea, for major stuff she reasonable would be aware of. 
---
Personally I play with all music off. No PipBoy radio, no in game "mood" music. 
---
The only time I hear her is if I pass a radio thats tuned in out in the wasteland, so she's not so repetitive to me.
---
I got extremely lucky and a 3 star instigating explosive +1 perception 50 cal dropped a couple hours after i posted. It absolutely shreds even before reallocation of points back into strength for heavy gunner perks. Daily ops im getting done in just over 6 minutes with a 3 man mediocre team. With meat stew and an events team im leveling pretty quick. Wish i could find some stable violet flux for sale to add a vicious receiver but wasting more caps looking than i want to. Hardly any nukes being dropped as the daily is an easy farm for legendaries.
---
I'll tell you what level 1 survival shortcut is enough mate trust me I use it and I constantly have 5 and never been under 3 of them it's a perfect perk imo
---
This is super sucky for me who JUST started to get into this game 😅 it’s like hitting enemies with a pillow now
---
If you wait around where you spawn the timer doesn't start.
---
The OP is complaining of those who spawn in and immediately charge ahead, starting the timer before everyone is prepared.
---
Voice acting is expensive.
---
What about the cards you’ve earned, but haven’t “added” to your hand... can those be scrapped?
---
Is that the *only* way to get perk coins?
---
I am on Xbox and can make you virtually anything. I've been living a lonely existence on this game and would love to spread some good will. What kinda gun types will your final build be using? I've been hoarding so much stuff because it's hard to accurately figure out value.
---
Oh well I mean it's not like the fallout universe is in a perpetual state of Halloween or anything, why would we want an entire event centered around it? We get Halloween everyday! 
---
/S
---
You mean the BOS collectron?
---
&gt; Have you tried protecting them?
---
Noice.
---
Like that but gold and with better zingers
---
They already released one.  It’s called the Brotherhood of Steel Collectron!  *buh dum tiss*
---
True, but in maze cells like the Burrows it can be tough to find the areas where the bodies are concentrated. I've run out my time without finding them all before.
---
I can also tell pretty easily that even if I do loot all the bodies I won't be getting all my ammo back. It takes me most of a clip (of 25 bullets) to kill an enemy, and the most they can possibly drop is 16. Most of them only drop 4.
---
It's definitely nicer than your average event, where the mobs drop no ammo or stuff that doesn't work for you, but it's never even going to fully refund me. Mathematically, it can't.
---
Supposedly for sale for bullion but I’m not sure where.
---
Also if you’re down in the ring don’t instantly respawn since you’ll still be counted for the charge and the enemies can’t do anything about it
---
Honestly, they're all pretty well designed, except for the roll we got on Day 1. Resilient Robots in the Burrows is literally the hardest and most annoying configuration possible. The Ops today and Yesterday, on the other hand, have been a blast!
---
Wouldn't that be to risky? While I do see where Bethesda is coming from you should be able to name it anything you want. According to there guidelines of course. But people would bitch and moan about not being able to insert subtle offensive phrases to there camp and try to boycott, stop playing or what the fuck ever they do. And those who get away with it will get banned and wash, rinse and repeat. Do you feel like filtering through a wave of pissed off 12-25yr olds complaining they got banned for calling there camp 'Insert Racist Word Here'? 
---
Apologies for the rant. But most people don't know what the word discretion means. I'm for it though.
---
I’m a casual. What is a magic shotgun?
---
Are you running Healing Factor? Already using calmex and blight soup.
---
But i only like soloing in this online multiplayer game! You’re really gonna force us into teams with people who we’ll probably never interact with outside of the event?!
---
Thanks!! I’ll check that out.
---
Raider bullion vendor
---
It might be the worst, in fact. You get reduced exp. When a ghoul gives you 170 with 15 int, an enemy from daily ops gives you 50-65. 
---
A Colossal Problem is THE farming method today. Events like Line in the Sand or Meditation are also good.
---
Meanwhile thanks to ammo factory I'm sitting on 90k ultracite 5.56 😁
---
I remember getting downvoted for says scaling all enemies was bad, now look where we are incapable of just ignoring a level 3 scorched while you gather scrap because it's now level 50 and actually a threat
---
I played the beta, but it's been a long two years so I don't really remember it much.
---
Thank you!
---
Kind of insane they have yet to release skins for this thing? Especially considering how few exclusive skins 1st players receive. Seems like an easy no brainer to win some points, but the developers of this game are anything but logical.
---
I'd assume they think it won't make them money so why put time into when they can make other skins to sell to the entire player base.
---
Oh yeah. I tend to forget that I have it.
---
Woah, everybody... we got us a Doom Slayer up in here! ;)
---
this is correct. besides some of the best chems only have a 3-4minute duration and lunch boxes require everyone group up.
---
its not selfish to expect just a few seconds for folks to setup.
---
White Knight
---
Edit: AGI
---
When we ran the first one a second time, we paused to pop a few lunchboxes before starting, and a group of robots spawned in the starting room and attacked. Noone had gone through the doorway or even gotten near it.  
---
I'm with the "prep before" opinion. Once in, get going.
---
some of the best chems only have a 3-4minute duration and lunch boxes require everyone group up.
---
Same, Xbox.  Did a hard reset and still zero atoms.  Don't really care as long as they fix it, but 7500 atoms gone is concerning.
---
edit- buddy I was playing with had shop down but didn't lose atoms
---
I am on ps4 . I would love to reimburse you for the sympto-matic if you would build it for me
---
Honestly the only thing I want is weapon/armor condition to degrade slower since enemies hit harder and take more shots to kill. I love the fact that everything can be a threat now but I don’t like having to repair my gear more often since I’m low on mats
---
Right I got nothing today either, but I think I saw the odds are 80-90% or something close to that, like how unlucky do I have to be to be in the 10%. Lol
---
I play most evenings with someone else I met on Reddit - we’d love for you to join us!  We do the daily OPS and wander around. Tonight we did it three times!  When do you usually play?  We play (roughly) from 5-10 pm Central Standard Time (he’s from Brazil so not sure his time).  We found a new player and it was even fun with him. It felt crazy that we were in power armor and getting our butts damaged and he’s in his vault suit with like three pieces of armor and he never died. That’s the leveling system for you. We all had a lot of fun.
---
I agree. I still think its relatively easy tbh. I'm level 240. Im hoping that when i hit 300 i see this "difficulty spike" people are talking about. The bigger creatures actually feel like a bit of challenge to an extent. I no longer 4 shot mirelurk queens with my junkie explosive auto railway. And i honestly dont see a problem there its a good thing.
---
Unless things have changed, food and water bars are losing their negative effects, so SS2 seems a bit short-lived.
---
If this has been updated, please let me know.

If you have a piece of armor which has the legendary "reduce damage while blocking by 15%" then any shotgun will do massive damage in vats. The more damage the gun does vanilla the more it will do bugged.
---
The community managers do try to be transparent, to be fair. Someone mentioned that one of them did respond to the Inside The Vault post earlier saying that Halloween wasn't returning because the devs hadn't fixed the bugs from last year. Which isn't an excuse, since they didn't fix Fastnacht either and they released it on time. Albeit this could be them learning from their mistake with that, but that's an asinine of "learning."
---
Uhhh... where do you get this?
---
Do you notice a real difference in the negative chem effect from healing factor.
---
They changed building team to casual and removed the bonus casual used to give and added the new group called daily op.
---
Some people have not picked up on this yet. First time I logged in I was like “why is no one using building teams?”
---
Why can manhunt and jailbreak be on at the same time? Are there 2 mad dog Malones?
---
I ran out of .50 cal ammo against him today, meaning I went through around 5,500 rounds. We made it though (barely). It was a small group, only 4 or 5 of us. For the last 10% or so of his health I was just plinking away with a radium rifle lol. I am liking the rest of this update but I am hesitant to do that again.
---
My JE and FE do about the same damage, so I dont believe it's the J causing it. 
---
And forceful stock :)
---
I know right! It's not like houses in-game still have their Halloween decorations up, and we **absolutely** don't have the Pumpkin House with a daily carving event. /s
---
I saw this too. I tried to claim them on my main. then switched over to my alt later, and looked at the board to get the caps on my alt then saw it wasnt claimed. I thought wait did i forget the atoms oh what the hey clicked it and a bit later noticed my previous number of 2970 atoms was at 0 so I would say don't do it.
---
I love my lever action and my non auto handmade and I'm too stubborn to give them up I hate the thought of using a bloodied build
---
Hmm that’s weird they must have found an exploit with atoms or something don’t know why some have 0 like me and others have their usual amount
---
Magic shotgunner here, Ab bracadadrium.
---
I constantly have to *unload* shells and stims.
---
Idk i like her **way** more than Travis. 
---
Fuck travis, hate that whiny/overly cool bitch
---
None will top Mr New Vegas tho
---
While I agree (and laughed), it's worth note that some weapon types are more affected than others. I was running a non-bloody stealth sniper, and I went from "a headshot from stealth kills a mutant" to "three headshots usually kills a mutant". This sounds like no biggie, but when you're using a non-auto rifle, especially a hunting or gauss rifle, it makes a huge difference when facing anything that comes in groups of 3 or more, or when Fallout suddenly decides not to apply stealth damage.
---
I personally think the balance is spot on for auto rifles and heavy weapons. Hard enough to require effort and taking cover, not so hard as to be crushingly difficult, but that difficulty ramps hard the slower your weapon fires. An instigating sniper rifle should be capable of killing a mutie from a stealth headshot. From what I have seen, a small damage boost to certain slow fire weapons would reach that point easy enough, while making said head shots vital. A lot more feasible now with One Wasteland and additive damage bonuses in place.
---
With any luck, non-auto rifles and pistols will get a reasonable buff to make them at least viable.
---

---
(Found the link) But yeah, those are sadly from the Treasure Hunter event.
---
If most players liked it, would you see alot of people complaining about bullet sponge radroaches
---
The most basic build and a hint of FPS skill can EASILY get you by in 76. It seems to me that those complaining couldn't be bothered with the perk system, tossed their cards anywhere and are now bitching that they can no longer love tap enemies to death. You can be casual and put cards in the proper spot to increase damage. It's not rocket science. As for the longevity of the game, that's complete bullshit that the casuals who are too lazy to play the game as intended carry it on their shoulders. ESO for example, good fuckin luck trying to venture out or even remain in a dungeon party without at least building your character somewhat decent. Same goes for WoW, SWTOR, FFXIV and the list goes on and on. It's not hard to pick a weapon you like and put the damn cards for that weapon in your perk load out. If you still can't manage then maybe this game isn't for you.
---
Pro tip for ammo converter.
---
You can make rail spikes with just steel and convert them directly to points for other ammo types.
---
It’s quite a bit of crafting but it’s a interesting way to get ammo.
---
I’m currently at 45k points right now.
---
2/4 elder runs have been empty for me.  I think it's higher than a 20% chance even when counting all 3 at once by eldering your first op.
---
Thanks for confirming it wasn't just me. I've submitted a ticket to Bethesda about it
---
Is your FO1st set to expire? Mine is tomorrow, wondering if it's related.
---
What are you talking about. If you rush to each section immediately you can do it solo. If you aren’t ready it’s not that big of deal. Join up with them when you can. It only helps you finish faster. My best was 6:10 solo.
---
One Wastelanders is surival mode.
---
Then get a private team together
---
If I join rando's in a DO, I'm high tailing it to Objs
---
The  C.A.M.P. module disappeared on together, I was forced to reset the module and rebuild my camp from the damn start. :(
---
Same I sell them for 7k now at first I did 15 but that didn't last long since the drop rate is low but you can do it all day if you choose to.
---
One time in Hawke's Refuge a dead raider spawned sitting on one of the couches all casual like wearing only her underwear. I was wearing the black bear costume and used cannibal and I'm sure you can imagine the surreal image as I knelt down to have my meal. I've always regretted not screenshotting that. Since Hawke's Refuge got a remodel with this last update it wont be happening again, either.
---
PvP literally only happens in workshop areas. Boohoo
---
Goodbye Score.
---
Shouldn’t be I’ve never subscribed to fo1st lol
---
Yes this would be the best! :)
---
One Wasteland makes me happy I waited to optimize my build (I only started in July, so it's not been that long).  So now while everyone who did feels weaker, I feel stronger.  I don't know why, but the update feels easier to me - not by a lot.  But I don't feel worse at all.  I already had strategies that kept me alive against a pack of high levels.  And I feel that helped me prepare for the re-balance.  YMMV
---
Your build kills things about as easily, most of my builds still kill stuff about as easily, my steath/vats/crit sniper went into the toilet. I went from doing 2200+ damage per shot to 300-500 on headshot crits. Sneak doesn't apply to vats anymore, idk if bug or intended, but it killed this character in particular. My pistol character who is ~ 50 levels lower and less well geared does more damage than my sniper now. My heavy weapons character didn't feel any change whatsoever.
---
I think it takes a lot of perk cards to make vats or low health work, so you're probably stuck specializing in one category for those builds. Dual specialization works pretty well with non-vats full health builds though.
---
Are you going to write a book to me if I reply too ?
---
The “timer” doesn’t start but mobs start spawning immediately. Just making it harder for yourself. Do all your prep before you enter the raid, it’s not that difficult. Plus you can solo these in under 8 mins so whether everyone is ready or not, you only help the time if you actually get there in time.
---
Not really. I tend to only take these buffs when going to fight Earle or the queen. But I’ll take them and then pop over to see how much my gun damage jumped by. Pre patch it would jump by about 150 points. And I only fought Earle and the queen once each so far post patch, but un-buffed. Didn’t really have any trouble with either of them without chems or anything else, so I can only imagine it’s gonna be downhill with buffs.
---
When it actually works
---
higher fire rate weapons (minigun) generally only break even, but for the most part daily ops are not a huge ammo drain if you bother to loot after the fact. Some weapons, like the Gatling you mentioned, produce far more than they use, it is true. Quite useful that way.
---
Exactly.
---
Please explain to me how, from a level 257 who spent two hours attempting to level.
---
Yes, or one of their friends on discord.
---
Yeah, my instigating charged tesla is flat out one shoting level 50 enemies in the forest, ash heap areas when I bounce bolts off the ground. Not quite as powerful against 60 and above but still seeing a marked improvement. It is great. This was my trash mob weapon and I was worried I would have to retire it, but it is still useful. Also I think missile launchers got a buff? I was playing around with one I got last night and it does great against level 50s. Maybe something wonky with the scaling?
---
I think it's connected to an issue where the new scoreboard is letting people claim the first 150 atom tile multiple times
---
Yep I have it on ps4 and 0 atoms as well
---
Yeah that magic is pretty fun. Was testing the one wasteland update with my shotguns yesterday. Was running my Unyielding SS Blocking armor piece with a variety of them VE Combat, Bloodied Pump, Instigating Double Barrell, Bloodied Gauss Shotgun. It's going to be a sad day when they fix that loophole.
---
Yepp, me too. On ps4 if that matters.
---
Raider daily didnt wanna spawn either
---
Edit: was the ultra-light limb mod for the SS suppposed to come with patch 22, I thought I read that in the patch notes.
---
I have totally not seen any increase in the quality of loot I get from (formerly) low-level events.  I know it’s a small sample size, but I’ve gotten more 1* crap from 2-3* legendaries yesterday and today than I can remember happening for awhile.  I’m happy I get some of my 5.56 back, yeah, but damn, lugging around an 18-pound 1* broadsider is *actually* more trouble than it’s worth.  
---
You know who consistently gives me decent loot? Sophia’s fetch-the-gun-case quests.  The quests are really not hard, and each reward has been a 2 or 3* weapon that *at least* had me debating whether to sell or scrip it.  One was even a fair-to-middling keeper (2* AA FR Handmade).
---
With a 3 star instigating explosive +1 perception having dropped a few hours after i posted.  im not as upset as it shreds without all the heavy gunner perks already. And at 270 rounds per craft its much more efficient than the 45 LE rifle. Did the sasquatch imposter in just a couple minutes and daily ops in just over 6 minutes regardless of teammates. It shouldnt be this powerful but im not gonna complain for now. Its way OP with all heavy gunner cards at 1 star. Rngesus shined on me but still miss the lever action.
---
Yes it’s known. Just something while they are fixing the atom shop. 
---
Could have just check recent and seen like 20 posts exactly like yours.
---
Insult Bot is a lovable scamp, the BOS collectron is just a dick.
---
Share the pic! :)
---
If you look at the numbers, though - see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iuc6yy/health_scaling_and_the_biggest_problem_with_one/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) - it is painfully obvious that the player's damage and the enemies' health are not in balance. The jumps in health at levels 23 and 100 are particularly harsh (though I'd be willing to accept that jump at 100 if 100s only spawned as crown enemies).
---
If you're not willing to read the post, the big deal is that between levels 14 and 23, the enemies' health abruptly doubles (increase of 100% to their health) whereas the player can only take one damage perk in that time (for an increase of 20%). Factor in the weapon's level and the player's damage is increasing 30-40% at best while the enemy health doubles. It's just not sustainable. And this is entirely ignoring that the enemies' armor is increasing as well, which makes your damage proportionally smaller.
---
One Wasteland feels really great at level 1, it's hell in the mid levels, it gets okay at 50, but between 50 and 100 you'd better get a top tier legendary weapon if you want a chance to keep up. Even then I'm pretty sure only Bloodied actually keeps up.
---
Those of us who already have our great legendary weapons forget that the newbies are trying to fight through (what are now) the game's toughest levels with primarily nonlegendary weapons that may as well be BB guns due to how to the math works out. It feels better for you and me, but for the newbies it's a nightmare. 
---
All that said, there's a fix in sight. As long as we can get the enemies' health scaling close to weapon damage scaling, we'll be fine. At the moment the game has this weird thing where at level 1 enemies take 1-2 shots to kill, but with a comparable gun and all the damage perks you can have at level 25 they're taking MORE shots to kill - say 15 or 20. It's Oblivion's problem all over again - new players are being punished for leveling up.
---
Team build heavy gunner I assume?
---
There was a bug not long ago where all the currency said zero, if it’s the same bug your atoms are still there
---
Power armor doesn't have legendary effects.  Trust me, you want power armor.
---
Not really much of a PSA...
---
Oh sweet relief. I hated the first modifier and every location because it was the antithesis to my build
---
It’s not about the effects is about the damage nerf.
---
Yeah. You should be able to do anything in game with no risk or threats....
---
Totally makes sense. Actually. There's a game mode for that.
---
It's called Creative mode in Minecraft.
---
holy shit i did too..............
---
Do items bought with bullion become available to all characters like the atom store or just that character. If just that character seems it would be the grind I guess.
---
Think it's the item you get from the treasure... Stash...thingy... That you can opt to give to.... Someone.... Man I can't remember that quest to save my life....
---
Yea but how do you solo it though
---
Not even in the slightest what I'm saying
---
Weak enemies like radroaches shouldnt be stong, and you know it
---
Even ark knows how to make high level dodos easier to kill than a low level raptor, if you want hardvore challenge RPG then I'm pretty sure fallout hasnt been that since 2
---
Ya I can see how hard single shot weapons such as hunting rifles, black powder and such would be useless now.
---
Right now Beth is still in the process of adjusting damage so if this is brought up more to them it could change.
---
I know that, i'm talking when I want to be outside of it. What are the best ones for regular armor if I am a Junkie's Heavy Weapon build.
---
Take a ripper and split yourself in half.
---
If you can get your hands on a vampire weapon.. I think it would help. When you're using this kind of weapon it restores your health as you're hitting the enemy. I had a lovely 50 caliber vampire.. unfortunately it disappeared.. but that thing saved me more times than I can count. I honestly don't know if there are vampire shotguns.. but if you find one hold on to it.
---
Damn, send those extras my way! I only get back a tenth of the 2mm I use with my gauss minigun. Fire 1500, return 150.
---
I dunno... haven’t gotten many fusion cores from my vamp Gatling.
---
Did daily ops in 5mins with a team of four and got no rare rewards, big oof.
---
Perhaps not 75, but 10-20 more players per server would be great. There are several events running simultaneously (public events, regular events, two endgame boss fights, and now the daily ops), we need more players to populate them.
---
I mean the base is more of a novelty. Can have some really great base designs. If they have shit trades then that’s on them, they aren’t getting any business.
---
All STASH skins need a Scrapbox counterpart.
---
I really enjoy my build now. I made some ajustments (see the edit). One Wasteland nerf is not a problem at all and I can choose my weapon for each situation and gameplay. I already maxed 5 legendary perks, I miss the poison one.
---
Yeah my 2 friends and I had a random join our team. Dude kept spamming the op, I think our longest cleat was 6:15. 
---
We did it like 30 times. Was a blast
---
I ran the event three times tonight, 2 of 3 times there was an actual loot timer at the top right of the screen! 5 mins is the official time before you're ejected from the instance, now I see what /u/_the_indifferent_  meant by 'it counts down'. It was not there for me yesterday,
---
I HAVE A AN EASY TO READ 6 STEP PLAN ON HOW TO DO OPS EASILY. JUST CLICKMY NAME AND LOOK AT MY PLAN POST. I was one of the first few people to make a post about it and it works so well for me. Please go visit it
---
I honestly don't think regular armor is necessary.  There's not much to help you.
---
YES!!!
---
yes, i can craft a basic assault rifle, though im confused as to why you would ask
---
Wait there's a backpack that does that now?! jeez. i've got a lot to catch up on.
---
The damage nerf is a lazy tool by developers to try to make the game challenging again
---
That would be awful. ESO is just another MMO in Elder Scrolls drag. It’s fun enough but it plays zip like Skyrim. For all its faults at least FO76 plays like FO3 FONV and FO4 for the most part.
---
No prob. I bought the Red Communist power armor bundle from the atom shop a few weeks and and there's a jetpack in that bundle. I was able to build it on the T-65 power armor without having bought the plans for the T-65 Jetpack from the vault. 
---
And as for the skin, there was one available in the previous Legendary Scoreboard, as a reward
---
New York City; and I can point out almost every other state in the inclusion of the criticism. Students here don't give a shit about education and Democratic politicians and presidents use it as a tool to get votes.
---
And they do it by thinking flooding more money into public education will somehow lead to higher grades. As a result what actually happens is the majority students come to schools not to learn but to goof off, the teachers teach in a manner akin to the times of the industrial revolution, which is highly flawed in 2020, and the grades have to be curved for students to be able to pass. 
---
Like right now we have actual idiotic teachers here indoctrinating students into believing socialism is a good thing. And it's spreading into colleges, because public education is dogshit. We have people here arguing that math is fake and not useful, that math is racist, and that 2+2=5; a spit in the face to the engineers who make grid that power the phones and computers they type that trash on. Literally 80% of the people who graduated from my college had an average of 65. A few were allowed to attend the graduation ceremony, and had to go to summer school before getting their diploma. And the parents cheering them on as if they achieved the impossible. You listen to my classmates and you'll realize they can't speak past a third grade level of dialect. And then you think this guy could be your next governor.
---
That really sucks. I loved the Halloween event. In fact it's actually my favorite... . And the whole thing with bugs, meet week was a bug festival! During prime cuts animals would get stuck behind trees.. the Gram event would be done in a matter of seconds...
---
Even fashnat had its problems..
---
It just figures that my favorite event is the one that gets dropped! 😬
---
I kinda wish it didn’t default to that power armor underarmor suit too. Whenever I start a new character and get into an empty power armor frame I kinda wish I looked nakie under there haha
---
Mine happened just now. This level 500+ player had a tamed deathclaw in his camp. To the side of where it happened to be standing was the “Friends Welcome” sign. I opened photomode to immortalize that beauty but literally as soon as I did the guy left the server
---
You are exactly right. But how does implementing new prefixes solve that issue? These new prefixes would still be nerfed to previous primaries effects.
---
Wait does that give you infinite candy?
---
Lol yup
---
Didn't know my opinion on this was mainstream. Happy to hear it
---
It's not to me either really but I just got the full spec ops outfit and want to see it sometimes, so on those occasions I don't want to be dieing every 5 seconds.
---
That's stupid.  My build isn't even ultra optimized.  Takes me no more than 3 bullets from a Lever Action to take down a Level 75 mutie.
---
Uh, thats not how it works at all. If anyone ever programmed a system like that, theyd be fired on the spot. No audio is “streamed” from the servers, and its all stored locally.
---
Instead of having a local seed to choose what track or Julie-line comes on next, youd simply host that on the server, and send a very, very tiny ping to the client as to what song to play next or to play a special announcement. This ping would be smaller than the packet that gets sent when you fire a shot.
---
Even simpler, have it just be client side. You know, like the civil-service warning that comes on whenever a nuke is fired? That exact same system, but it plays a Julie-line instead.
---
Ive started losing interest in player vending. You hit end game and you're chasing specific items not the general trash seen in vendors.
---
Even worse when you can't just shop because of gimmicky bullshit.
---
Fucking assaultrons. Still dont trust those bitches down in the whitesprings bunker. Dont try anything, ill cry!
---
I solo’d yesterday’s and got a better result that either of the two tries I had at Resilient Robots, and those were with teams of 2 or 3 others.  Burned through 1000 rounds in my Handmade, but I only died twice rather than half a dozen times.
---
Today, Bertha rested and rebuilt her C.A.M.P., so she missed Daily Ops..
---
Yeah, I understand.  Serendipity is going to help with that
---
Imagine a Zip car Scrapbox 😱
---
If you on pc I'll give you 10,000 caps to place on at my camp. I got the fusion reactor so if interested I could place that for you.
---
Tank killer now affects pistols..?
---
Oh too bad.
---
Were you able to get back underground at that spot? Using what trick?
---
Not at all what I meant by that. I meant your opinion isn’t really a public service.
---
You totally can. Being a bloodied or junkies build will go a long way towards that. My third choice would be furious or anti armor or instigating, for legendary effects. I honestly have a bunch of weapons with all those effects in my stash and regularly swap around. 
---
Focus on cards that improve your over all damage, rather than trying to improve two weapon types together. Stuff like adrenaline and conentrated fire and bloody mess. Boost your stealth multiplier. I also like the revenant / mysterious saviour combo. I've got one piece of live saving armor that also triggers revenant.
---
Perks wise, I'm set up for heavy guns. Maxed out. (That's what I use for boss fights.) But I've got enough over all damage boost that auto or single shot rifles work pretty damn good. Which is what I use when I'm not fighting bosses.
---
Build wise I'm a low health junkie, heavy rifleman commando melee. Carry a mix of bloodied and junkies weapons. Just avoid those weight reduction perks and other quality of life perks that don't directly increase your damage in some way.
---
If your question inspires me, perhaps.
---
They also disabled the weight press bench . Going well for the launch so far
---
Is that a bug?
---
Atom store is down so everyone's Atoms are 0 until it's fixed.
---
I have 3 very different and distinct builds right now.  All viable for different situations.  
---
This "only one viable build" crap is utter nonsense.
---
All of those builds allow me to mess around in the open world.  
---
Get better at build crafting and stop whining.
---
even with max durability I remember mine breaking after a couple rounds with the whitesprings bots. can't imagine it lasts the entirety of rad rumble.
---
Yeah
---
Thank you for the warning
---
Appreciate the input and I will invest in that.
---
Only if you’re low health build and you have that mutation that adds damage and the perk strange in numbers
---
Rank 2 is good, but eventually you should try to get up to 4.  But definitely prioritize other things first.
---
Its afu.
---
Preach brother! Finally some positivity on a great update.
---
Woow!!
---
I just met her last night, thinking how bad she could be, seeing some people go on about how they hated her voice. It’s so grating. I could probably forgive her edgy personality if she had more of a sultry voice.
---
on the same range means it's not the same. sorry to say but I'm pretty sure sneak multipliers are additive now.
---
So as a republican you prefer an ignorant and uneducated population?
---
Frankly, this is probably better than survival syringes, but for me, I still will find the emergency heal and extremely light food/water useful.
---
Good to know it works so well!
---
Also, please remember the Vendors bug.... Let's hope they fix all this ASAP.... 😔😔😔
---
😂
---
I don’t have the ammo one so probably that
---
I agree. Every time when I saw a mirelurk Queen I was like “meh” aim and shoot a couple of times. 
---
Now though I actually am running around it making sure I don’t get meleed or acid splashed on me while fighting it.
---
I think you're on drugs.
---
My stealth riflemans damage definitely went down, and max'd Follow Through barely changes it imo.
---
Ok :)
---
If it happen again try using a Tesla, the arcs go through walls
---
I did it mostly because I wanted to make a brotherhood bunker. I put the vending machines outside the front up top, so people could access those easily, but inside is a bunker with a barracks room, a rest are and a workshop. I thought it looks cool so I went with it.
---
I did some runs tonight as well. I saw it as five minutes myself as well. That seems just about right. 
---
It would be nice to be able to see the report after exiting as well, as a reminder of what you did get, especially if you clock through too fast or opened it with just seconds to spare.
---
I switched to full time power armor with a stealth boy mod and thanks to legendary agility I can rank up the sneak perk. It seems pretty effective so far, just got it to rank 2.
---
I'm using an instigating gauss rifle. Kills most things in one headshot. I tried a silenced anti-armor radium rifle first but apparently Follow Through takes a few seconds to take effect so it's worthless for that.
---
Against Earl and the queen I use final word, I'm a hybrid. Follow Through isn't a total waste there - I can drop back into stealth sometimes while reloading, so I get the 40% damage boost for the next hundred rounds or so.
---
Technically you can if you only use nuka grape roll cure rads, but the two perk points are much simpler.
---
Do you actually craft fusion cores?
---
Yup....Bethesda pushing the power armor heavy gunners.
---
*Most* STASH box skins need Scrap counterpart....
---
Atom shops down for maintenance
---
You could mutate accidentally though.
---
Yep happened to me
---
Actually those servers were private servers to level up on.
---
They were ghost towns as the PvP consisted of killing at respawn points
---
It’s a shotgun/sniper build
---
Sort by new and scroll just a few posts.
---
I’m going to craft an AA plasma caster.
---
I believe they are doing some maintenance that’s making many people see 0 Atoms. I tried a test by claiming the 150 Atom reward but it would stay ‘collected’ and the total didn’t increase.
---
Lol thanks. Might take you up on that when the time comes :)
---
Ah ok thanks
---
Yup, they added it in the patch.
---
Points and choosing perk cards, has to be both or doesn’t work.
---
I do wonder how many people are still using these *magic* weapons as a crutch.
---
Clarify, please. You mean regardless of what’s in it, or if someone was kind enough to put Bubblegum in it?
---
I’m totally ineffective in the game. And that makes me sad. I couldn’t do project paradise before. Certainly can’t do it now.
---
Almost like there is a divergent community and members in it want different things.
---
Boy. As a rule, I’d normally say no. But on Xbox you might wanna go over the toc quick, it might fly.
---
Here’s another one for fidget - gaming/pipboy. You pull up your pipboy and begin tapping way. For a first person view, you could be editing the code of the device.
---
Another could be note taking - you pull out a journal and write.
---
Only reason i wouldnt take it is incoming perk loadouts. Otherwise it's a fantastic perk because having to go into a bunch of menus to swap a bunch of perks around gets old real fast.
---
That said, its only one more perk point saved compared to the raw stat legendary perks, so i'd rather take one of them and swap a single lockpick/hack perk card
---
You wouldn't understand because you aren't as good as me and aren't a target.
---
Out of curiosity, why not?
---
But if you not wearing power armor, then you not buying our cookie cutter skins for 1000 atoms at a time. We have to force everyone to buy more stuff
---
Agreed! I don’t see why we have to be naked to be in PA. Wouldn’t that be uncomfortable? Like look at the chassis lol
---
Was yours inconsistent as well? As in, it didn't 'always' show you that count-down?
---
I made sure to esc (PC) at about 30 seconds remaining to ensure I had time to review the rewards screen.
---
I don't know how general your build is, but it only took 9-12 perk points to achieve decent damage, enemy supposed to be weak like lv50-100 radroaches still have very low health and resistance that can be kill in a second even without top tier weapons. 
---
"Playing your way", "Casual player", "Roleplaying non-combat character ", what does these actually mean? Is using a switch blade to kill a deathclaw in 5 seconds with full loads of QoL perks "your way to play"? Is tossing whatever card you prefer and still walking in a dangerous wasteland like it's a theme park the only way to satisfy a "casual player"? Oh and "roleplay", play as a trader with only charisma perks and reduce weight perks, while complaining about fighting a lv 50 wolf is too hard, even yourself don't care about fighting in the first place, what a wonderful roleplay idea you have there!
---
The world isn't going to play in your way, the ilfe isn't going to play in your way, the game isn't going to play in your way, and it's an online game, don't you dare think it should play in your way only.
---
At least it’s coming this year which 2-3 months away from 2021
---
I mean, I don't know about you but my PA toon literally wears nothing when he's outside of his PA...
---
True. I had a slight challenge before using an assortment of guns unoptimized now they are mostly useless.
---
How
---
Being able to be the end game boss in 2 hits is dumb. Its not lazy to reballance game-breakingly op things in an online game. This is a step in the right direction.
---
You don't understand because you are not at the level I'm at. It's not your problem so you shit on the thread.
---
What are you talking about? Bloodied is still king on dps. While junkies is still good on full hp builds. Anti armor actually got improved imo from the nerf.
---
My bloody Build is killing lvl 100 super mutants in 3 shots. Is that not good enough?
---
I can see your reasoning for more legendary types but they really need to adjust the current ones before thinking about new ones. Berserkers and others really needs some love.
---
I currently run this [My Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e954699&amp;d=s01s22eh2ib4s12lt2lu2x63x83x93x43x73xb0ir2eu0ee2ej1sr0s30sq0ss2sf2c12l71la2lb2pn1pd0pt0pg0pk0pu0ph0pl0pv0pi0pp2a12am2a03ar2ce0ao0&amp;w=cr0e60e12e82em1er2e00ep1p02p72p10p30p40ln0pe2pq1pj0s50sb2s92s40sd0so0sm0sv3sw2se2sj0sp0sn0i92i44ic4ii0ij2i71if2im1ik0ip2iq2ie2in1ih2id2a72a80ad0s72a42aj2ak0as2at1au2al0lj2lf0lq0ls2lm2c72c52c81c22&amp;m=01c249fe36i&amp;am=-182938---&amp;wp=wa&amp;wm=14273c)  
---
I have a bunch of bloodied heavy weapons, rifles, melee/unarmed, and bows as well as a full Unyielding set.  
---
I'm not min/maxed, just all round for fun.
---
That is true, though I’ll be honest, I’m running through five characters from 1-70, that’s only happened to me a few times total.
---
They killed my beloved game. The legendary bonuses on a lot of guns are so low now that it’s almost a wash.  I don’t enjoy doing the same things I have always done, struggling the whole way there. I’ve always been a bloodied build but I am in no way a tank. I’m happy to hear some other people enjoy it. But, I can’t even casually play anymore and gather resources. Every confrontation feels like a chore.
---
Best effects on armor would be Vanguards or Vanguards/Sentinel. I don't know what type of armor you currently use whether its combat, scout or leather. I use Thorn Armor 4 piece Vanguards and 1 piece Troubleshooters. I also use now the Strangler Heart pa with a medic pump. If you want DR get all 3 of junk shield, 5 of ironclad, max out evasive. On you're armor I would suggest weighted arm mods, biocomesh lining on the torso, pocketed or shadowed on the legs. It does away with unnecessary cards. But go for the full rank of What Rads? perk. That combined with the medic pump, ghoulish, and healing factor you are practically invincible. The weighted arm mods, thorn armors bleed and the acid from Strangler Heart pa, electrically charged and unstable isotope mutations you always do damage but re heal every time and you don't have to worry about the diminished returns of the high DR. 
---
Hope that was helpful.
---
Yay my 2 shot 10 mil will be fun
---
I'm just one perspective, but I just really wanted to give some feedback. Thank you for taking the time to listen. 
---
I'm so sad about the update after really looking forward to it. I bought the game day one but only recently got around to playing it. I fell in love! The environmental storytelling is amazing, it's the reason I play, along with story questing. But here was my experience yesterday.
---
I take my time exploring. I'm a lvl 50 and I finally wanted to uncover what happened in Berkley Springs. I was immediately caught by a horde of supermutants. Most of my guns did minuscule damage with hundreds of rounds, and I had to use a stimpak every minute or so while trying to seek cover. When I thought I'd finally cleared the area, I went to finally read some terminals. And suddenly I'm being shot at again, the horde had respawned before I had the chance to discover anything. By then I'd used up half my stimpaks, most my ammo, I had no choice but to retreat. So what happened at Berkley Springs? I'm not really sure and I'm discouraged from returning. I can read the wiki page, but that defeats the purpose. I wanted to explore it myself, like so many other spots I was waiting to discover.
---
At lvl 50, I was finally feeling some progress in the game, confidence in my character. Now I suddenly feel like all the hours I put in have meant little. I don't want to be the most powerful in this game. I want to be Intelligent, Perceptive, and Charismatic while being able to roam some areas that aren't as threatening as others and uncover a story in a world I find fascinating. There needs to be a way for multiple playstyles to coexist, because I just have no incentive currently to explore when it feels like a punishment to do so without being in one of three viable "builds." I was going to start up another character, but now I'm just so discouraged to even work on my first one.
---
I agree. This patch or whatever has made me totally ineffective. It’s just not fun anymore
---
We do, its called cursed. Plus its already very hard to get good roll weapons with the insane amounts of weapon/armor and legendary combinations. We don't need more.
---
Seems like the nerf has worked as intended /  and now some smaller changes can be made to balance things further ,  
---
Pretty sure the patch noted said that the damage reductions would be readdressed after this first reset was underway 
---
So keep on suggesting away guys , i think if we are heard then some tweaking could improve the game making the way weapons work more realistic
---
Mine was zero for the five times I played.
---
I almost got it from the freaking tiny ants in the mine. It's horrible.
---
I just walk around with broken armor limbs and lots of defensive perks now. ricochet, dodgy, serendipity, blocker, action boy. Can't be arsed to repair all the time and I don't think the DR on the limbs really does too much. a Secret Service Chest has so much durability it never breaks and between it and an armored backpack, seems fine.
---
I only have one high level character and 11 mutations.  I don't want to pick up one and have to deal with all that.
---
Bloodied stealth commando still offers some of the best DMG output. I one shot everything
---
Move it a bit, you cant get in.
---
Not on my end. It showed the countdown all three times I ran it. I was guiding some new players through the Ops and made sure to point out the counter so they paid attention to it.
---
Not that entire classes of weapons would be rendered useless though.
---
People will get it over time. Events teams were really popular until people realized building was were it was at. This also makes more sense to me so I'm sure people will catch on soon
---
EDIT: on a side note I appreciate how they moved casual to were building used to be so my muscle memory wasnt jacked up
---
What perks are good for rifles? I don’t see anything I like or would help me
---
For that instance, I’d definitely agree, starched is a much better option, and I’d also say it is for most players. However, I did want to point out that nuka grape was an option.
---
Yep! I'm on PS4 too and Retirement Plan daily isn't spawning either.... 😔😔😔😔
---
All I ever see is “None” 😂
---
Less enemies spawn when solo and killing them with a BE25 Fixer helps lol my Secret Service armor has 709 Damage Resistance too.
---
One thing you didnt cover. Are daily ops account wide completed or just on the character? What if i have multiple characters over 50?
---
Yes, true.
---
I don't have to be at a repair bench to use a repair kit???
---
I disagree with one thing. The tiers. It is best to farm all three as ive yet to see someone get 2-3 rare plans from one attempt. (Granted could just be a dumb luck chance type deal but i have gotten 2 rare rewards in one day by doing 2 separate ops.)The tier 2 attempt gave me a spec ops outfit and the tier 3 run gave me liquid courage. But again do you know if its possible to obtain 2-3 rare rewards from a single attempt?
---
GET OFF MY LAWN!!!
---
Yep! Also, Atomic Shop isn't working and there's a bug with the camp vendors as well.... 😔😔😔
---
Or if weapon durability hasn't changed(lose only upon landing hits), take a harpoon gun with flechette rounds and keep shooting a static corpse(or any technically works). You'll never lose durability and the harpoons will multiply on the corpse because the flechette rounds count as multiple hits. Takes time but you don't need to farm for materials.
---
I was in the midst of frustration whilst rebuilding my C.A.M.P. today, and a dude came along and took off his PA to go in my crafting dome to do some stuff. Cool, fine, waved hello but ignored him as I was trying to get some damned through-wall conduit to snap correctly.  About 30 minutes later I look back and he’d just left his PA frame where he’d taken it off, like a huge empty Coke can sitting there littering up my front yard.
---
Omg i had no idea. I was wondering why my shotgun was amazing. I just thought a found a good one that just happened to work well with my armor/perks etc by coincidence 😂  this explains a lot
---
You didn’t *need* VATS/Crit. I made a pretty basic build that went without mainly to spite a friend of mine. Mainly used sneak (no covert op) and the occasional panic chems (not a junkies build). Worked just fine. Still works well in this update.
---
I like the galleria's varied levels of engagement more than the burrows twisty turns and small spaces myself, but yes, the three setting are diverse and that's good.
---
I'm not sure how long the zest for control points versus horde mode will last, but the ops are short enough so that each one feels reasonably quick and fresh so far.
---
Oh, I didnt know you had to put stuff in it.
---
If you have the plan we can do some tests, but I had never seen it before, clicked on someones while I was in their camp and it completed. I kind of just assume it did that for everyone.
---
This was very helpful, thank you.
---
Reduce damage while blocking, V.A.T.S accuracy, and limb damage cause shotguns to be “magical”.
---
I’ll have to make sure I check it out again tomorrow (and the next few days if it happens again) and see if my main gets quests from both. Rereading my post I noticed I didn’t finish what I was saying about my level 85 character: she’s been able to do quests for both factions since the patch. Just my main wasn’t able to today for some reason. 🤷‍♂️
---
Literally two posts earlier is someone asking the same question and got an answer, 10 minutes ago. Scroll down or use the search bar and sort by new. Come on man. Atom shop is down for maintenance.
---
Character bound like caps/day or scrip
---
I agree, I encountered a mothman today and before I would shrug it off but now I screamed like a little sissy and that's how it should be
---
If we were able to craft inside, this would no longer be an issue aha.
---
Buddy hopped on that hasn't played in months shit melee weapons and said it pretty easy.
---
You can visit JES-2R at Freddy's House of Fears.
---
Same. Ps4. Zero atoms. Never been fo1st.
---
That would make it really really good and it's already a pretty good perk as it is.
---
On top of all the other damage-related perks.
---
It didnt put the candy in my inventory, it just completed the SCORE requirement. Another poster is saying someone has to put candy into it though, so I think some testing is required.
---
Last time I tried this my harpoon breaks in the process. I could try again now since it been awhile.
---
I did that from on top of the monument and counted 21 ragstag with 12 of them glowing.
---
You might be in too high of an area.
---
Ammo for a cap, rare plans from new events, unique weapons, still stuff to be found and sold
---
Why so much in strength? To max out all 3 ranks of shotgunner you just need 9. Perception should include all three maxed rifleman, long shot, and/or concentrated fire. Ill assume you got tenderizer in charisma, enforcer and sneak in agility, better critical and bloody mess in luck. All maxed?
---
Mediocre is probably too kind.  Anything that has Nocturnal as a primary Legendary trait is worse than a non-Legendary weapon more than half of the day.
---
I just got it.  Evidently it’s the same energy output. Does it take up more camp budget?
---
I think if you were steamrolling the wasteland you aren’t the (justified) complaining demographic. The real struggle is the disproportionately affected low-mid level players, which (I think) is validated by the data on how fast enemy scorched (example) HP increases- it increases at a rate that is hella fast pre-50 and they all become HP sponges quickly. 
---
I don’t struggle post-patch, and I didn’t pre-patch, big I also want to acknowledge that if this build put my more optimized bloodied plasma caster build in its place, then less optimized builds are disadvantaged. 
---
So why not just spec super optimized? Well, they’re new(er) or casual players, but the penalty for specing wrong is pretty high.
---
There are certain effects a shotgun can have to make it magic w/o the armor as well. But from a damage standpoint its better to get thr best shotgun possible and pair it with the armor.
---
I've tried a few as well and stick with a quad ff double barrel. Packs a punch and reloads in one quick animation unlike the other shotguns.
---
Similar situation here. I was already getting burned out. Every end game boss is just a bullet sponge. I feel like the new game is awesome if you want to play on a team, but I don’t play FO on a team. Solo it’s miserable and I feel like I put all this effort into a build for absolutely nothing. TSE and Junkies are so close now, I only gain extra carry weight for being low health. But it takes so long to kill anything I’m always getting spotted now and die.
---
If you heard a sharp cracking noise don't panic. That was just my heart breaking at the realization I won't be able to get the pumpkin tables....dammit I was hyped for making an entirely Halloween themed camp on my alt....this better not turn into a "buy your Halloween from the atom shop" thing
---
I am also a Heavy PA build, and what I use is weightless legendary armor. It’s not the most useful, but when I’m in situations where things are heated, I’m in power armor, and since you don’t get the bonuses from armor while in PA, might as well also not be weighed down from the extra weight.
---
Wait to use the lunchbox at the first boost spot? 🤷‍♂️
---
guess you will just need to head over to the atomic store, and pick up some repair kits!  
---
I’m sure some already tried that approach
---
I don’t wear armor I have an under armor and an outfit on
---
I got mine today. You can place stuff at other people's camps? Huh must be nice to have friends
---
Don’t bother with chems or lunchboxes. The event hinges on time, not killing efficiency. And the enemies reward poor xp.
---
Technically, in fallout 4, you wore under armor in the PA. So yeah, there isn’t an excuse on this one.
---
What do you mean? What deal?
---
Yes, please. I’d like my shiny new twelve agility at all times.
---
From what I'm hearing on the sub, it's the fact that they asked for "MDTA" and got "Ghouls of Mass Destruction"
---
I seen that, but thought Zi should say something.  Just in case. Thanks
---
I'm rocking the Fancy, which I'm loving for its ammo capacity and its speedy reloads 👍
---
Saw others mentioned it's Daily ops rare drop
---
Is the vault radius still a thing since the update? In the past the further away you get from the starting Vault the harder the enemies would get but I'm not sure if that has changed?
---
Either way, you're level 15, stay in the forest.
---
One character only. And they cannot be transferred to other characters
---
Isnt it beautiful. I run a gatling laser so I just reload my cores when they're at 5% and put them in my pa to recharge them. Basically making my own ammo for free.
---
I agree. I’d say add more enemies to higher level areas. The scaling thing works but not 1:1 all the time. The first 30-40 levels are so hard. I can’t imagine what people are going through now.
---
Doomguy?
---
Yes but 3/6 max for me
---
My vending machines are upstairs
---
This
---
I thought they just changed this so that the enemies would level with you
---
Bloodied builds can still oneshot most enemies, they just have to try harder now. Might even need to use instigating weapons depending on their setup.
---
Magic shotguns are still pretty buff, although if you’re a junkie’s build you may have to play around to find a setup that gets you back into actual oneshot range.
---
They have. The server status page reflects this.
---
The candy bowl has to have something in it. It works like the punch bowl, nuka cola machine, and the keg.
---
Well I'm on PC and would be happy to team up with you if you are also on pc. My ign (in game name) is Rlauntz53
---
I recommend watching popular YouTube channels for Fallout 76 videos (Captain Noob, TYR, Angry Turtle, LoneVaultWanderer, to name a few) to get some ideas and inspiration.
---
Right now one of the easiest methods to play, IMO, would be the following combination: Power Armor and the Fancy Pump Shotgun in VATS. And, of course, a reasonably well thought out build. I suggest that weapon because many other players have them in their vending machines and you could get one too if you are lucky with the rng. I venture to say you can take out most mid to low tier enemies (even post Patch 22) in two or three shots. I use a Vampire's 33% VATS Combat Shotgun but they seem to be a bit harder to come by.
---
Good luck out there!
---
Moved to Commando AA from Rifleman Furious/Instigating.  Legendary Perk’d PER up to 15, AGI will be the same once I get some more cards to scrap (currently 13).  Don’t have the gear to move to Junkies yet, but that would be my next move.  Commando is...going to take some time to get used to, but I should have gone back to AA awhile ago.
---
When earle was screaming at me, his tongue gave me an exhilarating rim job and i didnt think to photomode it
---
You know what I like about you?  You're crazy, you know it, and you don't give a shit. 
---
Good on you.  The world needs more grinders like you.
---
I feel that on my bones , they will add new currency to Perk loadout just like Legendary perk swap
---
Unless they patched it, the armor check is only for 5 matching armor pieces. Since PA has 6, you can have one mismatched and it still works.
---
I've seen them go for like 5k for 15 and I was wondering if they were limited or anything.
---
As a republican I prefer parents take on the task of forcing the kids to learn on their own. Get rid of the industrial education system because it doesn't work. Get rid of public schools, and endorse a better education experience.
---
I went to YouTube on my own for physics in my freshman year of high school. And I learned how perform a vector cross product on my own. While I had help from a good teacher in understanding how acceleration works as an increase of velocity over time,  she taught me privately off from school hours.
---
The government shouldn't be handling the student's education, the student should be in charge of his own education. Plain and simple it doesn't cost you more than what you pay for the internet in 2020. Einstein was forced to read books as a kid and at the age of 10 was already able to perform calculus 2 operations and he was able to learn and do all of this from just books and no teachers. We can be that kind of great America again.
---
What people don't understand about free education is that the majority of the students won't actually give a shit in the first place. And those who do, and take their work seriously, often waste their lives learning about things they'll never use later on, and it's because they care more about getting a higher grade than they do about what they're actually trying to get a high grade for. Of the dumbest things I've ever realized is that in America we have to take 15 years of English literature and nearly half the country can't even sound grammatically correct under public education after 18 years of age.
---
It is the parents' job to instill the habitual desire for education into their children...not the government. One thing people never bothered to memorize or learn about is the bill of rights. The Enclave in Fallout is pretty symbolic of the technological ingenuity we could have under such system.
---
My favorite example is like the one below:
---
https://youtu.be/QgvtmO7c-UU
---
As I said in my other reply, I have two. An FE and a JE. The damage they do is very comparable. FE is not magic.
---
And yes, because laser rifles allow beam splitting, it makes them do far more per shot damage than single shot. My point is that demo expert appears more effective post patch 22, compared to prepatch.
---
I'll have to check if my explosive gatling laser is stronger or weaker.
---
There’s an outage. Fear not, everything will be fixed whenever they fix it.

Investigating

Impact Description: Fallout 76 outage for the Atomic Shop on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
---
Current Status: Fallout 76 is experiencing issues with the Atomic Shop on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
---
So much edge, I accidentally cut myself opening this thread.
---
I'm eastern time and play early afternoons and sporadically late at night. I'll send you a friend request. GT is close to what my name on here is. Im down to do all of that with you guys.
---
Nah thats just bad marketing. I wouldn't pay more than 1k per card and 500 is preferred. Getting them is stupidly easy.
---
6 is possible with an efficient 4man. Which would make a rank at 6 be a pretty good incentive! Since you can solo Elder at 8 :P
---
no i messed up I'm tried to put a picture of the perks i use and the weapons but cant i thought about changing weapon so can i get the most damage
---
How about they actually fix the ones we have before they start introducing more? I mean we have plenty of stats that are just worthless.
---
One last thing RadShield stacks on your armor. Farm it. I stack ten of those and walk through a nuke zone just using radaways and I heal. You'll take rads but its like +7sec. And a chemist backpack ling takes care if my 80 RadShields, 75 Stimpaks and 150 RadAways. Oh also since they are classed as chems the biocomesh lining increases duration by 50% so it's 17-18mins per RadShield before it wears off.
---
They should pay for more voice actors to update audio for sure.
---
Without unyielding, melee is hurting bad. Other than Queen and Earl though, I still wreck. I prefer  this damage because now I have to swipe twice on most enemies instead of once... the game shouldn’t be that easy. I also shouldn’t have to rely on a magic weapon to do... any damage against Earl. I don’t know where the balance will be though. Buff me anymore and the rest of the enemies will go back to being too easy.
---
So it's just people don't like doing the quest?
---
I don’t think so. I’m 95% sure it only tracks advancement on one at a time, so whichever side gets activated first disables the other until it’s done.
---
And what exactly was the excuse for the previous year's final season being skipped?
---
If it was a covid thing, Bethesda sure as hell didn't reference it as a cause. They said in their ItV that it was due to discussions that the decided to delay it and make it a bigger event. Absolutely zero mention or even inference of it being due to covid delays.
---
Might have been the less damage while power attacking 3rd star.
---
Thanks for the info! I was so excited to get that one, now i know i better wait. what a shame tho, i love metegol
---
People who prey on People who don't like doing the quest. I can easy get 6 in 30 minutes with a friend. No one who regularly buys keycards buys them at that price. Thats straight robbery.
---
I’m working from home so I get on throughout the day if I’m not busy. I’m only level 41. My friend is like 160. My username is the same as here. Can’t remember if I said that it already.
---
Yep I’ll sell them for 500 caps too or ammo
---
GT: dydamas. I'll run them with you. I usually have a good group online.
---
Nukes and dragons .com. Fill it out, post the link hear. Someone could probably help you if they get a visual aid.
---
Only 50% xp if I remember correctly, which is actually better then xp from the vault 94 raids. Pretty good if you just wanted to farm unlimited spawning enemies, but yeah obv you have a point.
---
comparable or the same? because they're not the same thing. the difference in this case would also be smaller than a non-legacy magic weapon compared to its regular counterpart because of the bugged splitter.
---
I haven't done it since this last update but it worked for me on various things(protectron, squirrels, ghouls, liberators...I forget what else I tried it on)
---
Try forceful stock. It increases durability beyond what it looks like. It's the only stock that makes the legacy laser rifle usable. 
---
I'd imagine it is less durable if you have a TSE compared to my JE or FE. 
---
Forceful stock plus starting at 200% durability and single-shotting radiation rumble ghouls? Your gun will last the event.
---
Melee will have to for Queen and Earl.
---
I agree
---
If you say so. I feel bad for the people targeting you. They must feel heavily griefed by your terrible personality. I hope the nuking brings them relief.
---
That's what happens when you get an amateur as a radio host I guess. She did just kinda take it over long after it was abandoned.
---
I have the Secret Service underarmor with shielded lining so that extra strength would be nice but nope. Too broken... op... what is it again?
---
Know it sucks, but honestly better than the flux disappearing from the game entirely.
---
yea that is true about weapon levels.  all i use is a baseball bat i skinned with the pink waffle bat.lol.  i dun really know if dmg would be different on a lvl 600 vs lv 50 using same exact weapons and weapon levels, but dont some of the perks scale with level?  
---
I mean, they even added survival mode that has complete open pvp right?  i havent touched it, nor the batttle royale, also another open pvp.  I honestly dunno how big the active groups are on any modes, only that ive read in the past that some went back to adventure coz not enuff to pvp with, but idk myself.
---
I mean in fallout (or any post apoc/survival type theme games) i thought the idea was to be able to scavenge anywhere.  I dont really like the idea that i ahve to progress to a certain area based on story/levels rather than available resource and ect.  I can get the idea for players contending with spots, so having the whole open open to everyone should be a viable option and at the same time not screw over newcomers with higher lvl monsters that they cant lvl up and progress themselves.
---
Thats also one obvious issue with pvp since it doesnt scale, thats why we have pacifist mode for when highbies decide to prey on the lowbies, which would be much like in any potential post apoc scenario.  But in the end, things would be a bit better if they can implement systems that actually work and make it hard to use exploit to go around said systems.  Idk, all we can hope is that they'll still continue to try and find an ok balance, which obviously is easier said than done.
---
Honestly im happy about the mob scaling, in concept rather, since i havent really tried it out if that update is even out yet.  I really like exploring the entire map, and some of my fave bits are in earlier areas but i dont really want to mess it up for lowbies having to fight highbie mobs.  This is one of the things i was apprehensive about when i heard 76 was mmo, coz then it would mean its gonna have the same scaling and pacing as any other mmo, which for a open world game i like exploring around like fallout was kinda meh, one of the main reasons is stated above.
---
I mean, in previous fallout games, u do start at low level and go up, but ive always liked scaling and liked the idea of starting anywhere so when i played fallout 4, i got a mod that lets u begin your adventure anywhere at any levels, and did get a level scaling mod.  That way, the "challenge" felt relatively feel normalized throughout, so im not just running thru the earlier areas and just trivially mowing down the easier mobs.  Altho, to keep being challenging, new behaviors,attacks and ect should definitely still be added into the mix at higher levels.  I wasnt expecting 76 to be FO5 to begin with, (since it literally was announced relatively close to fallout 4's release and why they have re-used assets) was hoping it was dlc to add new area to explore and online coop option to fallout 4 because then we'd still be able to use mods to play the game our way.
---
That would be nice
---
I thought the same thing, I’m not sure why it’s still happening to me
---
I was all excited for ammo factory... then I remembered I haven’t crafted ammo in months and with Daily Ops I get free refills on my rarer ammo types (Ultracite mostly). So I left Ammo Factory on the pile. Maybe once I’m level 800 or something... but I’m only 360 on my main... problem with having alts. Got a 260, 200, and 150 as well :P
---
Indeed i miss that mode, but its bethesda, gl

I'm a vats sniper so I like the well fed and water ap regen bonuses

Some people are saying that the food and water thing is no more because of this perk but don't think anyone really knows for sure

I cannot be the only one who think that Appalachia radio was better without a host 😬
---
If ppl buy them I’ll sell them had 1 go for 1k of caps in my vender
---
You get it, but can't use it.
---
A nuke is touching down in Watoga while Julie is chill AF going on and on about why it means so much to her to be on Appalachia radio 😂
---
I'm lucky I guess I have a spawn for them where my camp is so I get 1 or 2 per session i play. And they sell out very quickly at 750 caps.
---
Not quite "missed" but "ruined" because of the depth of field. Got a cool shot during an SBQ fight but didn't mess with the sliders, so it's rly blury
---
Ok. Thanks.
---
Yeah about that price is right. Paying over 1k is absurd.
---
I think a separate issue is that you say “fix the broken op things” but they have still failed to do that. Legacy and glitched weapon on console and Pc are both OP and have not been affected by this nerf. If anything it makes those weapons even more OP making the issue  worse because the time you ran into people who one shot an enemy will happen more often because everyone is doing less damage across the board.
---
Even without magic weapons, it's still perfectly fine. Aside from bosses being noticeably tankier, it's really been a non-issue for the most part.
---
Can't think of much else that can easily be done by multiple people at once, which seems to be what Bethesda is designing around. I guess they could have us do a sort of fetch quest like the beginning of project paradise and radiation rumble.
---
They need to keep the objectives simple and easy since they are basically public dungeon runs. If they went for something like the old raids, the amount of people running the daily ops would plummet.
---
Is this true for the rep dailies? I assumed before I wasn’t getting any
---
This is my current build, take a look, awesome for me :

---
On the PTS it only required 5 matching pieces. Not sure if that was changed to Live
---
In your opinion, who is a better radio host in fallout 4: Travis or the water selling kid?
---
Idk
---
I think I vibed with Red-Eye the most.
---
Melee stealth is either nerfed into doing like double/triple of nothing or it’s bugged because I took mine off and can’t tell a difference.
---
Strength slugger build with a 2 handed melee is fun to be. Ammo is so expensive so i just bop the heads with my new glaive
---
Comparable to the point where when I got the JE rifle and excitedly tried it in place of the FE I've had and was very familiar with since launch, I didnt actually notice a difference in damage done. Yes, 5 addictions.
---
Sorry. Not a data miner, but I did not notice a visual/casual difference in damage between the two. Those are my observations. I'm sure you either have your own, or can somehow make your own.
---
Edit: yes, I very much agree with you on the difference being very small. Likely unnoticable. My understanding is that the issue with legacy laser is each beam will do full explosion damage. 5x of a number vs 5x of a slightly bigger number might be unnoticed by my eyes.
---
I know that, but the game is meant to be played a certain way, as free as Bethesda tries to make it, and people hwo complain about it being that way is like complaining that soccer players kick a ball around. They don't like the way the game is MEANT to be.
---
The range issue really only occurs with the different nozzles. Which, yeah, sucks, since they add damage, but if you leave it on the standard nozzle it stays the same.
---
The condition is insane though. 1 200rd fuel tank and it breaks.
---
I haven't launched cause of the whole launch codes being screwed up nonstop lately.  I'm not going threw the trouble just to lose my nuke card at the end
---
Eh, it's one of those PSAs that only caters to a niche audience. You know, like how all public service announcements are like :)
---
Damn... looks like there's not much point running Gunslinger or Rifleman anymore with that damage difference
---
I think we agree more than we disagree. And I hear you, there's getting lost, then there's just standing there trying to kill everything even though it's infinite spawn. So yeah, it's much better when people are motivated to at least try to look for the next objective rather than rack up kills and just kind of loiter around.
---
Not exactly because legendary affects themselves have been nerfed. Bloodied is still better but you can afford to use something else because bloodied isnt a 4x damage multiplier anymore. You can't nerf legacies specifically without making everything else of that weapon shit at the same time so unfortunately legacies will always be OP unless they delete all legacies which I think would be kinda a dick considering someone earned that originally. This is a complicated issue without one solution but as I said this is a step in the right direction.
---
Try grenades/Molotovs/explosives. Molotovs in particular are fantastic at doing damage through walls... the problem is the thing that always gets through walls is the fire DoT. Which is pretty low in damage.
---
Same- I just quit
---
Did you play with Shearluck ?
---
Well shit, I didnt even know there was a plan for a candy bowl, now I need it!!! Been hording halloween candy to give out next month and was just going to plop in a vendor for 0 caps
---
Guess insect repellent will actually be useful now, instead of me just selling it.
---
Yeah, survival shortcut, what rads, infiltrator, and ammo Smith are what I'm calling convenience perks since they make the game much more casual to play. Youvll no longer need to worry about rads, food, disease, lockpicking/hacking cards, and to a lesser extent ammo.
---
Me too, also apparently my atoms were wiped to 0.

---
Barrel, not nozzle. If you step onto a server without swapping out the barrel, you get a range of 1.
---
&gt; Some of the major legendary effects suddenly feel minor now that the update has arrive. 
---
Which one exactly? +33% VATS chance? 25% faster fire rate? Which major effect feels minor now?
---
Makes sense, thanks, Ill delete my post.
---
Guess I just came across a kind person.
---
are you using vats? because if you're not, then the magic damage wouldn't trigger. and that would settle this I suppose.
---
but even then, last time I tried a legacy laser rifle, which was about two weeks before patch 22 hit, a VE one, I was getting 'comparable' damage to my B handmade. I should probably give it another go with the new calculation, but if my flamer is anything to go by, it's hardly as op as you make it sound.
---
tinfoil hat theory: Bethesda is driving a wedge in the playerbase and making us split into sides and flame each other and spread toxicity on the forums and reddit about each other's opinions and when the flames are high, the heat is raging, and even the Colossus cowers at our keyboard typing.....
---
..They put world pvp or an arena system in the game. then we fucking kill each other while Bethesda devs sit and watch.
---
This is in terms of mischief night not being debugged after last year crashing every hour. 
---
More broadly there's some planning fallacy in there but between E3 2019 and launch Wastelanders became a much bigger expansion, interviews with Ferret Baudoin intimated this. Gamescom interview with Jeff &amp; Emil went into problems with working from home. You don't need to be told something in order to be able to know what's happened.
---
 I use all sorts of weapons, laser, unarmed, heavy, 2 handed for my bloodied bull, and all kinds of weapons for my full health junkies build. For me though I optimize by having no quality of life cards at all. So no weight reduction, item repair quality, items last longer or stronger. It’s all offense and defense.  Now if I need one of those cards I switch to them temporarily band then switch it back when I’m done. So I only carry 3 Charisma so I can share a card and 5 intelligence, so I can use max gunsmith and the melee weapon card. Other than that, it’s all picked to help me stay alive longer or kill things faster.
---
??? We did it in under 6 minutes it was stupid simple like the blood eagles yesterday.
---
When atom shop is up, you should be fine
---
Yeah I swapped from Two Shot to Furious because the Two Shot Flamer kept breaking after one tank.
---
I use vats constantly but i feel like that'd be pretty hard to pull off lol
---
Its Julie or Judy ?
---
10 atoms if you get the reference :D
---
Plant-based alternative - 😆🤮  
---
In most things it's about preparation and portion control.
---
Unfortunately, it is too easy to get lost with the Burrows.  A way path is far more useful than a way point for players new to Daily Ops not getting lost.
---
Atom shop just came back up and it’s all working now lol
---
[The TZMap mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/419)  also has several differently colored map marker packs for download.

I make my own, grind my own and have been lucky to get a pair of two rifles I swap between.
---
Each to their own but Discord is the best source for trades imo.
---
a lot of people don't focus on the numbers and just go by how it 'feels'.
---
well, it's not a 3\* multiplier any longer, so I suppose you would feel a difference. but that doesn't mean it's broken.
---
people should be chastising Bethesda for turning inherently multiplicative effects, additive. not this.
---
Yup. Already sent a request.
---
I can't build anything at my camp on Xbox now. Moving, scrapping, and building all take 30 seconds plus for it to register in the world. Everything else has been fine but camps are borderline unusable.
---
Wtf are you talking about?
---
You misunderstand me.
---
You only have the issue if you aren’t using the default nozzle.
---
If you use the default nozzle you don’t have to do anything.
---
day one allowed for infinite str which lets be honest was fun as hell but yeah it is broken for right now.
---
I believe forceful gives the most on everything that has that option.
---
I’d need perpetually tired
---
Just wanted to comment on my statement of NOW it's an actual post apocalyptic game. It's about half way there, the other half is putting world pvp back in, in some way to where there's times people can just avoid it and times where if you're caught out, you're getting run down by a swarm of mothman cultist players.
---
While this would be cool, I just want an occasional change up of songs. There has to be at minimum a few billion backwoods banjo tunes available that would keep the game tunes fresh while wandering the hills of Appalachia
---
I agree, but as I said it’s a separate issue. My main concern is that they made it harder for everyday casuals to compete with people who already have everything they want. 
---
My auto B handmade and B fixer were doing about 380 before patch 22, now they do about 180-190. Pretty big nerf but obviously still more than sufficient in most cases. However my BE laser rifle still does 390 and my BE plasma does 130. Not to mention my NW glitched laser rifle does like 380 a shot with a splitter. Btw it actually doing more damage after patch 22, idk how that’s even possible. I mean if I wanted to I’m still one shooting enemies. The whole point of the nerf was make things less OP and put people on an even playing field. I feel like what they did was just make the divide of higher end players and casuals wider, instead of bridging the gap which was the intended effect. 
---
I have no issues with the nerfs, but I rather they fix all the issue instead of blatantly ignore them for the last year.
---
The best part of this post is that I've been trying to figure out what direction I should take to make my character functional and this just might be it!!!
---
The plans glitch has been there for a while now. The atoms probably just had trouble claiming but keep in mind the atom shop is having problems
---
You can initiate a personal quest to get a nuclear keycard on the terminal in the command center in the Whitesprings bunker.

Personally, I've never had to do this as I randomly come across the cargobot with the three vertibots in the wild enough to keep me stocked.

Note: I’m on PS4 so I wasn’t able to take a picture yet. I’ll try to get one this weekend &amp; share. I figure a picture is way more helpful 😅
---
Why only 5.5k of ammo my .50 cal never drops below 10k at 15k I go and make more
---
My rifleman build using a quad lever action takes most enemies down in three shots. 
---
So many people in here complaining because they don’t one hit everything because the broken build got fixed. 
---
You’ll adapt and find something else to ruin it all tomorrow.
---
Haha honest, I'd try it right now if they weren't on different characters currently. I dont do private server item transfers with legacies due to the loss risk, so I can't easily test again in same conditions for the sake of this thread.
---
The only thing I can think of is to strip the characters of perks, go full hp, and shoot something with the same mods on both guns on a lv 50 in the forest haha. Maybe after another drink.
---
I'm use vats of course to get the 1 shot kill though. They also do "comparable" in and out of vats, though with vats the accuracy does make it seem (or really do) more damaging :/
---
Sorry for dragging this on. Good chat and gives me something to test though. Dunno if thats magic or just every beam landing. I'll leave it at that until I do a test with some new info.
---
Yeah and it could’ve been a laggy server but just something to watch for
---
I was hoping for dialogue like fo4s companions but nope literally everytime I talk to becket he says the exact same stuff over and over and over and over and over
---
I said this weeks ago. I feel this 100%
---
We shouldn't need to purposely gimp ourselves in order to get a challenge from a SURVIVAL game whose theme is POST APOCALYPSE. We should be able to build how we want, and feel a challenge with only the insane mix maxers drinking all the consumables and drugs before every encounter , complaining that the game feels easy. 
---
One Wasteland is a blessing. Shit tha'ts too strong is a bit weaker, everything else is scaled as a challenge. The only downside of it right now is that leveling players, and "casual" players are realizing they can't do combat with their survival/utility/luck builds anymore and actually have to commit more into the perks for their weapon of choice and chosen combat style (VATS? Agility? Close up? Ranged? Glass cannon? Tank? ) 
---
Level and perk up to survive, then you can go into your utility, farming, miscellaneous perks
---
I don't agree with that. I have many casual friends that have used casual legendary prefixes like troubleshooters or zealots since pre nerf and this patch has made them very pleased because they say they feel like they do damage now. You have to keep in mind bloodied got a MASSIVE hit and some other prefixes barely got any. Some guns also got hit harder than others. I can't really say anything conclusive but a lot about this update is confusing concerning the amount of damage certain things do.
---
You forgot to add cheap scrip, treasure plans, and bobbleheads...
---
Yeah I agree. It really sucks seing a cool plan list but not actually getting it
---
At least there isn't 30 minutes of ads every 3 songs
---
It is fun, now it has more challenge making it more fun. It being challenging doesn't make it a job or no fun, you people are just lazy and want to one shot everything and I don't have sympathy for you. Sorry.
---
I would love to see some PVP raider cage matches become a daily ops mode. Maybe they could bring back Cait in someway.
---
It's more like we never really HAD to worry about crafting ammo hardly at all. Shit died so easy we were surviving off the ammo scraps we were getting from drops. 
---
Here's the thing, we SHOULD HAVE BEEN NEEDING TO CRAFT AMMO THE WHOLE TIME. That's part of the survival. 
---
It's not all bad though, Bethesda DID put in a system that detects what gun you're using the kill, and the enemies start dropping that kind of ammo more for you. Kill with a 5mm, start getting 5mm. It's....sometimes off putting when ghouls drop rockets. Or a Mutant using a board drops energy cells, but it definitely helps the ammo issue ON TOP OF the new legendary perk going "HERE'S MORE AMMO ON TOP OF YORU PERK THAT ALSO GIVES YOU MORE AMMO"
---
There’s some limitations right now for a bigger/newer map but with expedition feature will make some more flexibility with these limitations for future content outside of Appalachia.... our weapon is patience
---
I'm curious, what is the point of using a syringer?
---
&gt;An extra bullet or two
---
An extra magazine or two more like.
---
I didn’t see much of a change and I’m a bloody build. I still kill most stuff under a second. 
---
You really need to look up some builds. I seen shotgun builds one or 2 shot mobs still after this update.
---
If you don’t like this kind of thing ( optimizing builds )leaving for awhile right now and coming back later would be best. Beth is still adjusting damage and looking at what weapons to buff or nerf to bring most weapons on equal footing.
---
Totally serious, and thanks for the tip.  Zero interest in a bitch fest; everything has an off switch and a closed fist pointed at the sun is unwarranted, nobody cares.
---
If you were playing the game long enough or if the game was always like this, you woul dhave been paying attention to what it takes to repair a sledge, and you would have been gathering those as you played. 
---
Because of this easy , turn your brain off style of playing where everything dies super quick, nobody worried about weapon conditions or ammo consumption.
---
Extreme casual here.
---
I enjoy challenge but hate bullet sponges.
---
I really, REALLY hate that in Fallout games (now all of them) you can walk up to someone and unload your shotgun point blank into their face and it just staggers them a bit and reduces their health by 14%.
---
The first thing I do in any Fallout game is in stall headshot mods.  That means I kill everyone with 1 headshot.  And They also kill me with 1 headshot unless I am wearing adequate head gear.
---
All damage everyone gets modded upwards, so things are more dangerous and intense.  
---
I hate this update.  I hate having to shoot something 37 times in the face for it to die.
---
Every character gets 50 coins for being level 50. Was supposed to be their "compensation" for anyone that lost coins due to the duplicate perk bug or from respeccing. Not really much of a compensation though, some of us are missing out on 200+ coins.
---
I did calculations too and it went to 3%. Think we tested it in datamining discord.
---
It's probably due to the new damage rework
---
Cheers 👍🏻👍🏻
---
If the ghouls smack your weapon, it lowers durability.
---
I find annoying.
---
Priority of the first responders. The church one over at Charleston.
---
&gt; do people just not like doing the quest to get one?
---
I don't have to do the quest to get one. They fly over my camp constantly.
---
One of the perks of camping in the central area of the Savage Divide.
---
Are you on ps4?
---
Not sure why you were downvoted except for the salty giga casuals being mad about the truth.
---
I've never had an issue with certain enemies being overly difficult. Deathclaws should be scary as hell ... in fact I wish they killed me outright more often in this game.
---
My issue with this update is that it turns what should be low level, easy enemies into bullet sponges and makes many of the weapons I've been using for the past 6 months worthless. A headshot with a sniper build is sort of its bread and butter. If I can't pull that off on a scorched, radroach or random person in the wasteland, then that weapon is getting sold. 
---
Sadly this update hasn't made the game harder where it should count, it just lazily made everything more annoying to kill. I look for challenge that matches the lore ... make it hard, good. But don't tell me that this is an enhancement when it was done in such a thoughtless way.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I like some of One Wasteland, but level 50 enemies in the Forest is just bullshit. Especially since I lost 80% of my damage.
---
&gt;Literally everything in the game is a damage sponge now. I'm done.
---
Also you...
---
&gt;Maybe I'm not "DONE done"
---
Does that mean literally everything in the game maybe is not a bullet sponge?
---
THIS i'll agree with. They did advertise as that, and that IS the essence of Fallout. I agree that low levels are probably struggling fairly hard right now, but i think that's because they should have been perking into straight weapons and enudrance perks and saving the utility shit for later.
---
Lol I assume you can it's not from the atomic shop and not a new weapon so it should be sharable that be dumb if not. You interested in some caps for placing the symptomatic?
---
I think the problem is that you can't role play in an Online RPG. It is fine to not have an optimal build and play and have problems but now with the update, the optimal build feels like the only way to play. If that is how you play from the start, more power to you but not everyone plays an RPG to minmax.
---
I thought Tinker Tom invented that one... It wouldn’t be the first time I misinterpreted something I read in the game.
---
Your build must be pretty shit if you're wasting one or two extra mags on each enemy. Or you just can't aim. Hitting vital areas on each enemy type is not hard and makes it take almost the same amount of bullets it did before. But I'm no gonna argue with you gutsy, I'm glad your bloody build got nerfed.
---
I did not know this. Thanks.
---
I’m glad your casual friends feel that way, but I’ve only heard complaints frankly. Everyone I’ve talked to have said they feel like they are doing even less damage then before. It takes more ammo, that they don’t have, to  kill enemies. That instead of every rare enemy being a challenge, it’s almost constant. Every enemy being your level is kinda rough on a causal/lower level player. They don’t have the same resources and it’s very limiting. I think the nerf while necessary has put more people off to the idea. It will take time for people to adjust, but I don’t think casual players really want to take that time. 
---
As you said for confusing yes. “We are changing the damage calculations so it makes more sense”, except in a few ways the calculations don’t make any sense or are outright reverting previous nerfs. Angry turtle made a few videos lately on it. Apparently TSE has been underfed and now does more dps (2x more) than B25 it BE weapons which is kinda crazy.
---
I'll be your friend 😊 if you need one wasteland can be a little mindless without someone to talk to.
---
Um...this has nothing to do with my post?  
---
I am talking coins being earned on Character A can be used on Character B.
---
The problem was I repaired the sledge to full before starting the 79 mission. Tbh It isn't that bug of a deal but its maybe a little to quick.
---
That sucks, I was hopeful. Thanks for confirming.
---
EXACTLY!
---
Why do you equate this as a failure of all free public education systems, and not just a failure of the New York or American system?

Do you have any substantial knowledge of systems outside of your experience in New York?

Isn't it already synced up?....
---
Got the new generator plan today!
---
How so? Was testing yesterday, with 25agi, escape artist and NO sneak card, supermutants was running 2metres around me, how is it broken, honestly asking without trolling
---
&gt; Remember Oblivion, back in 2008 when you had to enter a cave and kill 14 ogres for a quest? And how every single ogre fight lasted five minutes where you would just trade blows, hacking away relentlessly and the damn thing just wouldn't die.
---
I don't remember that actually, mainly because I cheesed a full set of chameleon armor and used the outrageous sneak attack multiplier you got from using daggers.
---
Good times, good times.
---
Get rid of the "if this structure is removed it cannot be accessed" shit too! If someone can build a monolith of a building in the sky held up by a single staircase i should be able to make a second floor in my house that doesn't require stairs to access it.
---
Alot of skills needed to boost damage are level locked for later on. You have to build your build early on since this game has no full respec so unless your willing to spend a long time later on respecing you get shafted for damage.
---
If this is true, im about to scrap some cards on a secondary character i dont care about to check this
---
This isn't catering to everybody though. This basically makes the game less enjoyable for a lot of people.
---
I used to think the same but Vanguards is too squishy once you take minimal damage.  Today I prefer Bolstering with AP refresh, Chameleon, Harder to detect while sneaking.  You can choose other effects based on preferences. 
---
T-65 is the best power armour.  You can't beat power armour paired with big guns.  Make sure you use the Stabilized perk, it makes all the difference in accuracy.
---
They were called survival i think
---
The ones in ops give less exp. it’s not a massive reduction like vault 94 raids were
---
This quest sucks because you basically have to complete it 100% or start it all over. Might be something to do with the instancing. :/
---
Its like Todd himself forcing you to do anything in this game, sneak perk car+ escape artist and you good
---
You can do it on public world's just as easy, it's not pay to win. Anyone can do it. Its annoying, sure. But that's how I move everything to and from my mule and I've never lost anything. It's easy to do. Just annoying.
---
Maybe a sidequest can be added for her :)
---
&gt; I have a more than great rifleman build that sucks now.
---
Post your build, I'm curious because I, too, run a rifleman build and I'm not running into any problems post-patch.
---
They do, enemies in Daily Ops give way less xp.
---
That's simply f ucking wrong considering i can go create a character RIGHT now and have the same exact experience. If you're putting your skills into shit that doesn't increase your damage early on, you have no right to get surprised when your gun ends up a water pistol and your sword is a pool noodle. 
---
That being said, I'm damn sure there is a scaling issue around the 30-40s. Talk about THAT, but no, everyone is saying the ENTIRE idea of One Wasteland is flawed adn wrong. It's the best thing this game has gotten since .....I honestly can't think of a huge update that drastically improved the game before this one, Bethesda just fucked up scaling and will fix it soon. Which I'm fine with tbh. Low levels can have an easier time, or even the SAME time as before with difficulty, whatever. 
---
When you hit max level tho, expect a challenge.
---
I just started and have mostly been picking up support perks. I have to grind and die a hell lot to level up and grab the perk cards that would make this game bearable again.
---
1: Get 1 enemy in nuke zone.
---
2: Shoot with Fly Syringe
---
3: Kill and Spawn Fly
---
4: Shoot Fly with Syringe
---
Repeat 3&amp;4 until no fly spawns then find another enemy. Beats having to struggle finding enemies for HRF.
---
Doesn’t make sense you can shove a full backpack into a chassis that sits inches away from your body but something like a t shirt or BOS suit would fit perfectly in there with room to breath
---
To be fair, my first character ON RELEASE month didn't even kill them. I ran trhough the pack , grabbed adn ran. You're gunned down in that area no matter what. That specific quest area is scaled to shit and alwyas has been.
---
Is it just me or is the XP for scaled up Muties stupidly low?
---
Also a bloodied build. I can still one shot most enemies minus the level 100 supers.
---
Kinda sounds like maybe your build/gear needs tweaks, but I enjoy the new challenge. Best of luck though.
---
Yeah, that's where things fall apart in Fallout games for me.   I don't care if it's fantasy or sci-fi or whatever, if I point blank shoot you in the face with my shotgun, you're dead.
---
IRL if someone shoots me in the neck with their AR-15, I don't care what kind of "build" or "mods" Rebecca has -  even if she's a level 1 secretary with 1 strength and 1 agility who's never fired a gun before in her life, I'm dead, game over.  That bullet penetrates my "level 43" skin and my human blood gushes onto the floor.
---
I like to just play Fallout games organically and pick up gear and levels as I go, and just immerse myself in the environment.  I try to make things as immersive as possible for role playing the story.
---
But it just kills any kind of fun or immersion for me when I have to shoot something point blank in the face seven times for him to die.
---
The very idea that I have to go to the internet to theorycraft my "build" in a Fallout game like this is WoW raiding or something just makes me want to cry salty tears of boredom and despair.
---
So yeah, I'll wait.
---
seemed fine for me?
---
My friend just private messaged me.  Apparently its a visual carryover bug.  Once you request an update on their end on the other character it updates to true value.
---
I’m confused, there’s a timer on the top right that shows how much time has passed and you know you have to get &gt;8 min to achieve it. What do you mean?
---
You and me both.  It does nothing.
---
The time is tracked on UI upper right corner.
---
Either or, and frankly, it wouldn’t be that broken.
---
Please report back if you do!
---
Is it reddit where you've heard the complaining? Reddit is where everyone comes to complain. The large majority of casuals arent on reddit because they're too busy doing something else or just casually playing. I really dont find that the large majority of casuals find the update bad, but I might be wrong.
---
I heard that TSE didnt get too much of a nerf because there are two bullets so they get half nerf, but that sounds...questionable.
---
Diamond city radio 👌 now that's a radio host
---
Atomic shop was down, but they've fixed it as of 12m ago. Try claiming again!
---
Incoming salty bloodies, stealth rifleman, and casuals. 
---
"But... But... Its not fun If I have to shoot It more than once, it's a chore now to do anything!" 
---
I crie everytiem, 1 like = 1 prayer
---
It does nothing.  As in Zero.  Changing to additive can't cause that.  It is broken, that's why people are bitching.
---
40 and most of the perks I picked were QOL
---
There is a countUP instead showing time elapsed. Just know that if you pass 8 mins your on to the next rank
---
Im not sure about legendary perk, but my regular sneak attacks working fine, 600 dmg headshots to supermutants with AA pipe rifle, tank killer, 20% health, rank 2 bloody mess, and 30% dmg from rifle perks (im so called food build and doing fine)
---
The timer count the time left to end of the ops, right? I mean a time from the start...
---
Yes it is. I’m not sure why anyone would get upset by what I’m saying.
---
Check your pip boy to make sure that you didn't turn off the quest.  If you did this, the quest will still trigger, you just won't see it on the main view on the upper right.
---
Yes especially now
---
Yeah? I played tonight with my berserker rifleman character and didn't die once. What kind of builds could people possibly be running that gets them rolled when they can't one-shot everything
---
Who knows, maybe they just needed a random reason
---
I got no shame.. everyone check out my dirty undies!
---
Thanks. I will tomorrow when I get on
---
No, I'm not one of those players.  I don't want to "one hit everything"... I want to one hit \*some\* things (i.e., level 1 ghouls and hapless raiders who don't see me coming, so my sniper rifle makes their brains explode).
---
But occasionally a Yao Guai with a particularly nasty skin mutation will \*sometimes\* soak up my bullets like rain droplets and then tear my guts out.  That's what used to happen anyways.  Now everything is identically leveled and identically bullet-spongey.
---
I don't want to "work on my build"....   I'm just a casual guy who plays video games for fun.
---
This is not fun.
---
Okay, but I actually wholeheartedly agree with Fuck Todd Howard. He's everything wrong with the company.
---
Heavy gunner PA build: that's fine.
---
I fully understand your view point.
---
I didn't mean the combat, just that it's a hell of a lot more stable and doesn't have the enemy scaling issues that 76 has had from the beginning. Before the instanced areas thing with wastelanders you were fucked if you just finished killing all the enemies but someone else 50 levels over you decided to show up and respawn them all near their level. 
---
I still have flashbacks of that fucking mine Rosie sends you to for a key. Juuust finished and was scrapping guns when all of the sudden a fucking glowing mole miner rave party starts and my level 30ish ass had to book it.
---
you kidding? Mr new vegas was the worst one. He's so bland and generic and forgettable. ive played through NV like at least 6 times. and i couldnt tell you anything significant about him.
---
This patch would’ve been my favourite even though my dmg was super nerfed because I use heavy guns it still kinda bums me out that my friends are having weapon be doing less dmg on top of having harder enemies for them to fight
---
Really, so like a single shot stealth build sort of thing?
---
And why do you say now
---
Sorry for the questions, I’m not to good at character creation in 76
---
I'm loving  the update. I actually  have to be careful  when I'm playing it's fun again.
---
Very poignant analysis, thank you for contributing!
---
It's not supposed to cater to anyone (in particular)^(edited here). It evens the play field out so you have to adopt to the rules set for everybody.
---
It is a weapon effect of the cryolator already.  Making it an effect on top of explosive and fire rate would be kind of ridiculous.
---
After this recent update two shot has become more powerful. I wouldn't know if you can one shot things but its a good weapon and stealth is a good way to go.
---
Its working, tested with auto grenade launcher during LITS party (i miss it already 😪) many times, grenade launchers not usable without it
---
Isn't it just 8,10,12 minutes for each rank?
---
The only run of Ops that I haven't gotten sub 8 was my first run on Tue. Especially today's. It is super easy.
---
Now because of one Appalachia update
---
The enemies level with you but each area still has a minimum level. If youre too far right on the map, the enemies are going to be high level because the AREA has a minimum creature level.
---
Because I'm the first hand example of someone who literally defied the public education system, and they made a law following my case, that students are no longer legally allowed to take state exams ahead of their scheduled times. It beats me why Democratic politicians did this in Albany, but that's politicians for you.
---
Yes, I do.
---
Ok, thanks for the help
---
I mean while I have seen a lot of people complain on Reddit, it’s typically about something that is a non issue with the nerf. I was mainly talking about my friends who play every a few days every once in awhile and when new patches/dlc comes out. Like I said they all more or less didn’t like it. They liked getting more exp for all their kills, but they drastically run out of stims, ammo, rad, that kind of stuff. I usually will just give them stuff when they run out but it seemed more often they were running low. At least objectively. 
---
As for the TSE thing, the initial nerf just did 100% damage with first bullet and 25% with second bullet and that explosive only applied its nerfed 20% to the first bullet. Now it seems they entirely reverted those nerfs and both bullets do 100% damage plus the explosive bonus on top effectively doubling its damage, which was the initial reason it was nerfed in the first place. I mean if it was intentional that’s fine, the meta will just become TSE weapons again lol.
---
Now it's a challenge which is why I love it
---
I‘m sure you’re probably talking about pvp reciprocation without claiming a workshop, but I had this happen:
---
I don’t PvP unless I have to run NW for a challenge, but my wife and I were playing tonight, I claimed a workshop, she joined my team, I kicked her from the team and left the green circle so she could claim the workshop from me, then out of curiosity, I shot her to see what would happen.
---
We both have pacifist on, but we were still able to hurt each other. I always thought you couldn’t fight back if you had pacifist on when claiming a workshop and trying to defend it. Am I wrong? Have you always been able to fight back even though you have pacifist on?
---
Oh yeah
---
I was naive and made a sword-and-shield Paladin build and just used gear upgrades I found, not worrying too much about my "build".
---
Nowadays people treat their video games like homework, requiring "research" and "theorycraft".  Not my cup of tea unfortunately :\*(
---
not at all. I suppose I should be testing this out myself. I mean, if you say they're performing that well.
---
gonna have to bug one of my friends for his laser gun.
---
Agreed. Been playing since stress test, I hopped on Tuesday to scope the new season. Went to Wes-Tek for my cake legendary kills and found myself saying aloud "Holy shit, did this game get challenging?" I usually run lower damage weapons so I don't one-shot stuff in group settings, but I had to bust out my Vampriric Gauss Minigun. I've been having a blast, I love this update.
---
I mean you could realistically make a custom backpack for PA frames. But I’m not worried about the weight on the backpack it self but it’s mods such as the chemist.
---
I use stealth a lot, I’m also a sniper build but if I wanna do things without a ruckus I use melee bloody weapons they usually one shot everything
---
1200 rad resist reduces the 60 rad/s in a nuke zone down to 10 rad/sec. Getting it down to the 6 rad/sec that What Rads can heal needs something like 4000 or 5000 rad resist. Which, given that RadShield stacks with itself last I checked, is technically possible but requires a lot of RadShield.
---
So without PA or a hazmat suit, you still need either lots of RadShield or you need to spam RadAway.
---
I made this exact post and got downvoted to oblivion yesterday. I also think it's incredibly dumb. They should make it a 100% for Elder not 80%. Even if you do get a rare reward you only have a 40% chance to get the good ones. Having to get decent RNG for two variables is just too much time gating.
---
Good point but this it is a weird way to make a RPG game. Mrta changes are fine and as someone who has been playing MMOs since forever, I have v. Had builds that became irrelevant but when a game makes it so only one type of play be the only viable way to play, then it will obviously get a lot of pushback from the player base.
---
&gt;More scrap than I’ll ever need
---
Fallout 1st subscriber I see. Only way you’ll have all that scrap.
---
&gt;A big part of this game is self sufficiency... This is made even easier with legendary perks.
---
Don’t forget that you don’t get your first one until you’re level 50, and even then you can only upgrade it once. I don’t think that’s very effective or helpful, do you?
---
&gt;This game has been badly balanced for a long time
---
While I agree with you to some extent, bloodied commando being the meta seems a little off so sure, nerf it. Bloodied melee is doing 35k damage a hit? Fine. Take that down a notch or two - possibly implement a hard damage cap on it like they put a hard cap on your SPECIALs. They can’t go above 100. But this new patch might have cut the meta down off its high horse, the meta is still... the best. They’ve severely punished everybody for the 0.001% of people who had the ability to cut down bosses in 5 hits. I’ve seen more people with a magic weapon cut down the SBQ in 3 seconds than legitimate bloodied builds kill her in 10. And in order to achieve the 15 second kill you have to drug, eat, and drink yourself so hard the return for investment is pretty much flexing. It’s not like getting that ten second kill gives you better rewards. The little folk who are level 100 but don’t have PvE optimised builds and god roll gear are going through hell now.
---
Such as?
---
True but only the cryolator and I think the bows which both leave you wanting. It wouldn’t be on top of those effects it would be instead of those. Faster fire rate and explosive are the top choices for second slot, it would be cool to mix it up with another option.
---
That's why I'm camped there. LOL
---
The reason i create this thread is to summarize what we love &amp; hate from the new one wasteland patch . Based on my experience, im still able to 1 shot everything with my gauss (with or without sneak) due to sufficient damage from Nerd Rage and Bloody Mess. On the other hand, now im able to swap one of my rifle damage card for long shot card to make it easier for me to pop someone head from long distance.
---
On the other hand, i think the reason why many ppl (mostly low level newcomer) strugle on early game is because almost every npc has the exact same amount of health (from molerat to super mutant). Aside from new dmg formula, the flat amount of health definetly affect the TTK or Time To Kill for each npc.
---
Any other feedback from you guys will be much appreciated (and i will add them to the list as well). Let's help dev improve the game we love &amp; hate at the same time, just like we used to during pre-wastelander patch :D
---
Do you use any food/water perks or have Speed Demon? Water goes down so dummy fast that it doesn't seem like T1 of that perk wouldn't be good enough.
---
I've had this happen every day so far(since the new season started), really annoying.
---
God this update is so confusing. I heard TS was supposed to be buffed but to my knowledge it wasn't in this update. Bethesda and this community need to make up their mind lol. I feel like its 2018 again.
---
bcuz it's an outdoor event triggered by a nuke, plz wear power armor if ur dying
---
Thanks.
---
I can understand if they forced players to pay attention to their builds, and I do enjoy a challenge.  
---
But when literally every enemy is perfectly leveled to perfectly match my exact level at all times... It just makes me cringe.  
---
I think Skyrim had a nice balance - They had both their "rubber banding" technique (enemies would spawn around your level, give or take five levels or so), and sometimes you'd still come across very low level enemies you could slice through to remind you just how powerful you've become...
---
TBH I preferred F76's old balance, even though it had flaws.
---
It’s just odd because backpacks need to be bigger to carry objects and making them smaller to fit object underneath a suit of power armour seems counterintuitive they should just make mods for the chest that give you more storage like a container you can get on your power armour
---
I just join a team for the perks and never interact with them.
---
It's about the proportion increase in difficulty. At lvl 150 I'm loving it, but my son at lvl 20 is getting curb stomped.
---
Yeah, like SBQ dont drop improved repair kits
---
In case anyone is interested, this is the voice actress in real life: https://youtu.be/8UoJ-34Ssa0
---
It only feels bad because you  think the drop chance is 80%.
---
If you got all the drops the first week that would also be shit.
---
Sounds like RNJesus doesn't like you much and the loves the guy above.
---
Me and 2 other guys got 5:45 yesterday
---
Prewar ads would be pretty cool now that I’m thinking about it
---
In first day i was shocked: "wow, finally some challenge content!" And what is now? Boring and seems like a cakewalk...
---
Which goes back to my initial comment. I’m kinda getting tired of these half fixes. I wish they would take a break from pushing content for a development cycle and just focus on fixing bug and glitches. They have a significantly smaller team then from development and launch. I can’t necessarily blame them for only being able to do so much, but I can blame them for wanting to put short term profit over the longevity of the game. Them just porting in skins and content from fallout 4 creation club for atoms is pretty disgusting in my opinion. Them focusing for like 3 months on only bugs would benefit this games lifespan. Rainbow 6 siege and No mans Sky did it, I think F76 can do it too.
---
Going from putting 4 rounds into a Yao Guai to 27 is taking the piss. Going from putting 16 rounds into a Mirelurk King to three magazines is taking the piss.
---
Uhhh they weren’t private we had competitions in them on PS4 with some of my friends and I and as I remember there wasn’t much spawn killing or maybe that’s because I was doing the killing idk I just want them back
---
I didn't go to the resort part of white springs for the longest time because I saw all those sentrys and assultrons from afar and assumed they'd be hostile.
---
Yeah, that's what it looks like
---
Yes, this is a huge oversight. It reminds me. I remember in World of Warcraft how they nerfed specific item modifiers called corruptions (much like mutations) 2 weeks after they became obtainable (randomly ofc). My op corruption that would give me top dps became mediocre at best and I even considered quitting.
---
Bethesda should do some sort of damage control, because I totally see how upsetting your build becoming obsolete can be.
---
This. Have to spend way too much ammo on that fight now! Imagine 4 man groups (when not enough people join) they'd be horrific.
---
This. I think a full set of cavalier armor comes in handy at a time like this :)
---
Are you checking the anti armour weapon while at 10% health though?
---
I got hit by a lvl 100 glowing one...it hit me for +200 rads( I must had rad worms at the time ) but I shit myself when I seen it..  guns are ready at Freddy's fear house now haha
---
I mean yea boohoo if you don’t like pvp that’s you I do and I know a lot of people who do too
---
You must be afk to be killed by a radroach 😡
---
Hay at least you kinda remember it if you went a pvp build you probably went it like 1 or twice
---
Riddle me how you can get into your PA quick enough before ya die?
---
But is the ammo factory in your camp? If it is, you have a legacy camp. If not then read what I said above again.
---
Is laughing at someones opinion an example of a good personality? If you don't agree with my opinion then why come here with nothing proving your point other than laughing? You contribute nothing.
---
I think its savage divide playlist witha  BoS themey thing in there now. its cool tho.
---
my camp is across from the top of the world train station at that junk pile. and i hear the new music sometimes.
---
Server wide reset at noon central time
---
Bad lagg?
---
So, should i get rid of it? Im a bloodied build trying to figure this out. Is bloody mess not worth its perkslots anymore?
---
Sorry only just seen this Rick!
---
Not everyone can or uses PA, that's why the nuke is drop how it is most of the time; at the edge of a nuke circle not on top.
---
Yes I am that’s why I’m posting this.
---
F! Todd.  I am disappointed and my Halloween is ruined.
---
/s not/s
---
*the NCR has declared you a terrorist*
---
Unlikely. He got upset it was used for Fallout 4.
---
My ballistic fiber stash is zilch. I've been running with broken armor for the past two days bc fuck it. I'm not about to grind for the umpteenth time. It's exhausting
---
Does Fireproof work with explosive damage? I do have issues with my Gauss Gatling and it's explosive ammo on targets in my face.
---
I’m at the point with my Junkies LAR where I feel like I’m just ... over it. I’m at the point where I really think I’m gonna switch to commando. I have enough perks points to max out the cards I just need the guns. I liked being rifleman but it was a smudge on the tougher side especially with swarms but now it’s even worse.
---
Lol, I forgot I sent this haha. That's ok
---
Then keep crying about it. I don't care. Game feels better now than ever before. I don't feel bad for ya
---
Happy cake day!
---
Ohh, that's a shame, I loved roaming the wasteland to this song.
---
Yeah I agree. It's all up to corporate Bethesda and not the devs. It's a complicated issue that I'm not sure anyone has an answer to except for deleting the explosive effect or legacies period(I can't even begin to think about the outrage that'd bring). I believe magic weapons are a fix that will happen eventually, as for the bugs I wish they would just fix their engine instead of just using it over and over for 10+ years. I think that would lend to less issues in general.
---
You like the Johnny Cash cover? *shudders*
---
Mr new Vegas here
---
Ive played through NV so many times and i dont remember jack shit about mr new vegas. im sorry but he's forgettable af.
---
This is what I'm doing. It is so nice having all these extra perk cards. I had 15 strength and agility before. By shifting points around now I also have 15 luck and am on the way to 15 perception and high endurance.
---
Apparently he wasn't aware the game would be violent, and tried to sue. Not sure if he was successful, but that's probably a reason a lot of songs are not available. Also why country roads and ring of fire had to be re recorded.
---
I actually did check my pip boy and both retirement plan and the importance of communication were grayed out like I’d already done them for the day. I just realized though that I didn’t check the quests at Ohio River Adventure. I’ll have to try to remember to check those tomorrow too.
---
You do it before the event or use the nifty invincibility window on respawn
---
I’d def be interested to see your build. Though my Junkies LAR is only a 1 star it’d be nice if I can find a reason not to go commando.
---
I mean, all of them if you're melee. It would be nice to see something for the odd solo player, though. Maybe 10/15/20% damage added as a seperate perk so LW isn't so heavily loaded.
---
Exactly what I thought she’s just a voice who speaks between each song not like three dog and Mr. New Vegas who actually had some personality and even the guy in diamond city where you do that mission then he stops being a pouty guy. She should comment on stuff like what you suggested it would make it more immersive!
---
Just gotta say not everyone who "grinds" is on discord.
---
All the USSS armor pieces are crafted as legendaries
---
Prime receiver should help, i misreaded first about Gatling gauss, not regular Gatling
---
It’s a challenge event with high damage enemies in a nuke zone if u don’t want to get rads (which SBQ drops too btw) or die then gear up accordingly
---
All secret service armor is legendary.
---
Damn guess I won't be playing this game during Halloween. Halloween events are the thing I look forward to in every game I play its my favorite holiday....Im honestly more disappointed about this than I am them delaying Expeditions and Perk Loadouts....
---
I assume the Chinese stealth suit is the way to go?
---
I've seen angry turtle and lone vault wanderer say this, but much like encryptid, this is likely a post we'll see many times in the future
---
I want the deathclaws to be deadly!
---
*monkey paw curls*
---
If using a bloodied build to test it you need to remember that Ll weapons get a damage increase from low health, the balance  changes where supposed to make it so all builds where a big more even. 
---
So an anti amour weapon at full health will probably do less damage to squishy enemies but more damage to armoured enemies when compared to a bloodied weapon at low health.
---
I can probably quote most of his voice lines from memory, that's hardly forgettable
---
It seems like my experience in armor breaking varies a lot then yours.  1300 hours in, lvl 500+, still havn't completed the "repair 76 chest armor" challenge. Probably because I am a sneak build.
---
Yes, this needs to happen!
---
Can you get Legendary Gutters?
---
Just making sure... did you actually listen to his radio?
---
You’re absolutely right, but after a few tries going alone or teaming up with experienced players willing to advise and teach, it should just be like clockwork.
---
Was this the invention of Belle Ghoulphine?
---
Gotta have every avenue open. Maximises time.
---
I did Irrational Fear yesterday and got absolutely bodied by Yao Guai and Honey Beast.
---
The prefix is already set so I'm guessing no cause it's a vampire with improved damage on it so I'm guessing no
---
Guys fallout 76 is going to add seasons the first one is called the legendary run
---
T-65 is best DR and ER for PA in the game when you have a full set.
---
Yeah a corporate decision which is why it will never happen unfortunately. Also yeah using an old engine doesn’t help.
---
They break too quickly for that now.
---
Just got it tonight. Our team ran the Op in 6 minutes
---
Seems to be noon central time
---
With a team it shouldn't take but 1, maybe 2 tries to get elder. Not getting a rare drop isn't a slap in the face, it's rng. The drops are rare, not guaranteed.
---
They are also adding a sheepsquash, i’ve seen the information around.
---
They rotate the same items forever meanwhile I'm still waiting for fish lamp to come back...
---
Whats the deal with Nuclear Keycards? Isn't one enough? Why is there multiple? What happens when you lose one? Are the other ones spares? Not very well thought out!
---
\* seinfield theme\*
---
No you freak
---
Yeah.   What's the deal with that anyway?
---
She can’t cause it’s the exact broadcast for everyone, and I like it that way, cause it means I get to sing the songs with my friends, if she commented on events it would be different for everyone which means it wouldn’t be the same for everyone, meaning it wouldn’t act like a real radio like it does atm
---
Not all 3star legendary are good, 99% are trash, can you be more specific? If you on pc i can give you some good shotgun
---
I am, indeed! I could have easily resolved that by restarting the game in the first place. And what did I do instead, dummy that I am? I come crying on reddit. Without doing ANY prior research. I am bovine-level dumb and should be ashamed of myself.
---
It’s interesting cause I went away from bloodied just today and oh lord mole rats and miners are insane right now. Sneak doesn’t seem to work anymore so I’m being detected and they spam punch me so I’m perma staggered 😭 why is this happening
---
Have you done a SBQ fight???
---
Dp you know about the types of meta's people use for characters that requires you NOT to use a suit of PA???
---
Late comment here, but would just junkies be enough for magic effect on an LMG? I think its around 159 fire rate, but I thought you needed 200?
---
As the others said. You craft the ss chest pieces, wait until you have a good roll then equip a jet pack mod to it (which is a plan you need to buy from regs also)
---
Just get a friend to help hand him the thing u want or don't want then switch character then trade back no fallout 1st required
---
The point of One Wasteland was to scale enemies to you. The game was far too easy before so this actually made good builds far more effective so maybe that's why I don't see much change. 
---
There's still enemies I one shot like they were 40 levels under me too. As I said, I think it all comes down to builds and gear. I can understand how it could be frustrating though, but my advice is not to invest into lots of QoL perks. That's the biggest mistake I see people make.
---
YES!! I get this a lot when I apply the exploding red mess perk that starts at 10% additional damage (I can’t remember the name of it... it’s a Luck card)
---
WHY..do things keep moving?!
---
That's true, but Bethesda could've just as easily picked any of the default, non-atom shop doors instead. Their choice of including this specific door, makes the argument for them doing it deliberately look stronger.
---
Eh. I would call being one shot op
---
wow
---
so
---
something's definitely up with laser rifles. haven't gotten my hands on that bloodied one yet, but even my vampire one is performing far better than before.
---
damage-wise it's about on par with my bloodied flamer now, so I'm assuming a BE one would be dealing about twice as much damage.
---
something I noticed is that my damage outside vats is really, really bad though. and demolition expert didn't add as much damage as I was expecting from your report.
---
but even with gunsmith 5 and luck of draw (which procs a lot), the thing still breaks way too fast for general use. I was going through whitesprings killing bots and ghouls and after like 5 minutes I had already gone through half the 200% durability. don't know how you're keeping it alive throughout the entirety of rad rumble.
---
You're right. It still needs a lot of balancing, but it goes to the right direction.
---
With 25 int and 100% lunch boxes (no food buff, i was lazy yesterday)  i was getting 902 exp from lvl100 mutant, ghouls and scorched seems to give more exp for sure, need more testing
---
All of the mirelurks are rubber banding for me with my shotgun. It’s even worse on the queens. I’ll do damage &amp; then her health doubles. Or even worse, if she kills me in the middle of our fight, I’ll respawn &amp; find her with full health again!
---
I didn’t even know that Appalachia radio had a host
---
Honestly the best armour for all builds is unyielding, you don't need to run at low health all the time but when farming you can let your health drop a bit to increase your XP along with all of stats.
---
Gotcha. Not good all around.
---
Point taken but I disagree with the philosophy on the last bit. An aa absolutely shouldn’t out damage a bloodied weapon at low health even against a highly armored enemy. Mathematically I’m not even sure it makes since. Even additionally if it’s going off base damage I just don’t get it.
---
Wait... they nerfed bolstering? I had just finished my first full armor set... of bolstering marine armor... rip
---
Hmh, alright. The first problem I see is that there are too many crafting perks in there. Things like super duper are not needed when not crafting. You're playing a shotgunner with rifles as secondary, right?
---
Do you sometimes play in a team?
---
Honestly, I am coming around to this. Some lower levels were complaining but I had a long thought about my experience leveling and it wasn't never challenging. In hindsight I was able to level up stupidly fast usually died by accident.
---
In the words of Justin beiber what do you mean? Lol they need to bring the radio host quality back into 76 as fallout 4 was outstanding
---
“Gear up accordingly” if ur not gonna wear power armor then find another way (stealth suit, hazmat suit, what rads, rad shield, there’s like 10 options) not to die soory it’s a complex game there’s a lot of mechanics u gotta be clever with it
---
It's was designed so that the game felt more balanced, bloodied builds have so many more advantages over every other build so I think it's only fair they have already one thing they are outclassed in.
---
Dropping bombs event is replacing mischief this year
---
Wow, if boi didn’t do it, this post did.
---
Yeah, just leave your poor company Alone. 
---
Whatever.
---
Awwww, really? :(
---
Oh, well that's kind of pointless.
---
I used to only have a 1* Junkie's LMG which would tear through level 100 legendary alpha bosses within seconds. It might still work, I'll have to test it.
---
Overall, I expect it would work sometimes but for more consistency, and better DPS overall, an explosive or faster firerate version should work well (although hard to come by).
---
Ive been seeing this a LOT. For me it starts at varying lower levels and not always at 1. Earlier, it started from 14 upon hitting level 17. Weird shit.
---
That's a funny way of spelling Supreme leader Tabitha
---
Have you tried power cycling your console? I used to get the same issue after every update. Just turn off the console and unplug for 10 seconds.
---
They (supposedly) were changing the treasure hunter event to have new shit, and to make you actually be able to get the rewards. None of the old shit of mounted plans.
---
This is a really good idea, i would love to be saved by big thicc man or woman
---
The timer is in the top right hand corner, it's counting up like stop watch. Not like a timer if that's what you mean.
---
Nice!
---
Loooool.  Fuckin’ lunatic.
---
Wow haha. I havent had a chance to turn on my PS yet xd. Do you have the splitter equipped and forceful stock? Thats how I run mine. The dura sucks on my pistol build for this reason, as forceful stock is rifle
---
Also I use prime for the damage boost - the ammos been easier since the patch with daily ops.
---
I shoot it like a semi auto but on commando. I've noticed that sometimes it takes a split second for the full damage to register. This has been a thing before and after patch 22.  The only time I full auto is to delete SBs who have that split second of flyby.
---
It only ever takes a few shots to kill anything, so dura had not been an issue for me. My ballistic rifles need repair as or more frequently - likely since it takes more shots to reach the same dps
---
The reason i gave my example was because I got annoyed in radiation rumble. Post patch I couldn't one shot the dang things. Like I said, only hitting 60 to 70% damage. Tried demo expert (im only ranked to 4) for kicks and I could! Was in vats almost the whole time since I was chaining gun fu and the reaper thing in luck 
---
I was crouched and there was one other person there. I was in and out of caution/danger.
---
Are you on Xbox? If so, what are their GTs? I’ll sort them out.
---
I could get the outfit not the helmet it won’t come ofd
---
Wow, I didn't know they went for that much. I was running out of space, stocking up on materials for the bos junk event and sold a few I had for something like 10-20 caps each haha. Oh well. I wasn't even aware there was an event to get nuclear key cards. I always got em off cargobots
---
How about commercials?

I wanna hear Grahm advertising the most, but you could throw in any well known vendor/business.

Or how about a Cryptid Watchers talk show?

There has to be some fun dialogue beth can throw together to spice up the airwaves without paying out for more music.

I like many others who are members of this community were unable to participate in the PTS.  The PTS participants do no reflect the community participation for so many reasons and should  be considered an exception versus standard and define the direction for moving forward.

---
Headshots 30-50m away. Did Line in the sand for the first time today. Was sitting in those barricades next to the ASAM turret, like usual. Was hitting those level 100 scorched for 50 damage...
---
Also did Project Paradise. My handmade broke 2 times. 2.
---
Where is the camp ?
---
yes and i dont really team up often i need to might be better
---
Whoops, better put on my newsman fedora here.
---
I was a casual player.  Level 144 and 300+ hours played , did not have an optimised build.  Liked going to low level areas to scavenge.  Now all the enemies i get are level 50-100.  Still had to do 80% of all the quests and wont be possible if i burn through ammo the entire or my weapons keep on breaking. Played 40 minutes yesterday did not die but had to take stimpacks like skittles.  No fun for me playing this was so they broke the game.  I am done with fallout 76
---
Reason to keep traveling 😉
---
Meltdown over nothing much?
---
Yurrr devs confirmed it today
---
Again your statement is short sighted and ignoring the fact people drop the nuke so you avoid fighting in the radiation.
---
Your missing the point, I'm talking about the mechanics of the game respawning you inside a nuke zone.
---
Please follow the topic.
---
If you want to post a thread about how to survive in a nuke zone please feel free too.
---
But avoid just stating obvious things because you have something to say..... this discussion is not about how you think people should play.
---
This is talking about the respawn mechanics
---
I was seeing a lot of this while playing today; seemed like it was mostly in the daily ops. High health with power armor at the time; don’t recall off the top of my head if it was happening with all my weapons or just when shooting short bursts from my auto handmade.
---
I was also using a vampires explosive LMG and a bloodied 50 limb minigun; can’t for the life of me remember right now which effects my handmade has (I’ve been running with 50+ guns for months now and have only recently started getting anything decent).
---
This!!!
---
I believe it's +50% each rank and it does stack with ammosmith
---
edit: just looked it up and I'm wrong, it's 50, 75, 100, 150
---
edit #2: so I'm pretty sure the stacks are additive so a +230% at max
---
What in the Sam fuck are you talking about? I've had several disagreements with other users here and I've rarely been downvoted, it might be something to do with him inexplicably dropping a "Beth bad u pleb obsidian good" comment to someone who simply said they liked a mod that brought some of the NV classic tunes into the game
---
I did recieve two Ultra Core upon completing the OP. If it could range too 3 I could see this being useful.
---
I would say you’ve been playing inefficiently and up till now it hasn’t punished you, the game was boringly simply by the time you get to 50. The still definitely need to make some balancing changes but this update is a step in the right direction.
---
Deathclaws still are nowhere near terrifying though.  I found one in the bog, of all places, and thought "shit, this is going to be tough now with new patch!"  Nope.  Killed it before it could scratch me - it just took more shots, is all. 
---
Threat free?  It is *still* just as threat-free as it was.  Let me repeat: things arent more dangerous, they just take more bullets.  That is literally the only thing that has changed for me.
---
Tedium.
---
Finally, someone with the guts to help
---
Xbox? I’d like to show you what a Bloodied build is capable of. 😉 😏
---
Daily Ops remind me of Strikes in Destiny a little bit. Ignore mobs, run as fast as you can to the objective, do the thing, run to the next objective, kill the boss, get loot.
---
I'm stoked that they're finally here. More please!
---
You get a guaranteed legendary every run and at 8 mins a run that's 7 or 8 an hour, well above any other method
---
May I see your build? Also 30-50m away will not work like it used to, even if you are bloodied. Gotta be closer now due to the damage changes. I was 5-10m away or so for my example above.
---
Too late. Already gone.
---
I get it. You should try Concentrated Fire perk. Cripple everything. No enemies can live when they get their limbs blown off.
---
If you cripple a leg, the crawl. If you cripple an arm, they can’t power attack. Keep crippling things until they die. Best strategy before patch and especially after it.
---
Handmade, a vampire's version level 45
---
Dosent work when you live in pa ;)
---
I don’t necessarily think Bethesda wants people to drop the nuke so they stand outside of rads to kill the queen as evidenced by the mob constantly flying far away from all the people aggroing it back into the nuke zone. Not to mention the “join event” diamond itself will always be on fissure prime in the nuke zones. I’m seeing a double noob offense against an endgame boss here: you shouldn’t be dying in the first place and rads shouldn’t be a problem if you do. There are multiple mobs during SBQ fight that deal radiation damage, maybe you’re dying so often cuz you can’t deal with them either. For gods sakes just reach into your stash and put on the right situational gear for a difficult fight. It’s obvious because it’s true and it’s how the game is meant to be played.
---
Wicked rare. A buddy of mine got it and he barley plays lol. I was heated but Good shit man.
---
At this point I have become so used to it that I just take it as an extra bit of a challenge.
---
Lmfao
---
Why does that hurt so much...
---
Commie psyops!
---
That was one of the things Travis, the DJ for Diamond City Radio, would scream between songs. It usually cracked me up to picture him having a breakdown in the studio. Before you give him a spine, of course.
---
Stand on the little table and look down on the mannequin head.
---
Move the crosshair around on the wall to the right of the head while looking down at it. The take equip text should pop up.
---
Isn't the idea to seize the waypoints/uplinks, stay with them until they 'flip', then clear the area off at the end? Hopping on a ledge in the middle doesnt speed through a run I don't think....
---
I found for daily ops the old adage 'Speed Kills' is what gets Elder run constantly.
---
Happened to me too... did you happen to kill everyone in that last room before pressing the garage button?
---
True. It’s just rough to see people hating on you.
---
You seem like you have reasonable expectations and you understand how to play the game well.
---
It has been since it came out. It's even better now though
---
Agree, but antifa are fighting against democracy and seem to want communism or at least free stuff from looting and of course their own way or else.
---
LARPers following a their psychopathic gurus.
---
I know the war glaive plan is not tradable, nor is the crafted weapon. I believe the same is true for the gutter
---
I usually do to but the super mutants in the ops today were killing me. I feel like I put a whole clip of my bloodied .50 cal in them more than a few times and it would just pop back up .
---
They've been hit the hardest because the damage adjustment was a flat treatment regardless of the dps of a weapon.  An automatic weapon is naturally going to have higher DPS due to higher rate of fire and albeit, using more ammo, won't have as hard of a time vs your lower rate of fire single shot weapon.
---
Another Underarmor PA thread another chance for me to make you think about Danse's naked ass getting chafed 24/7
---
You have an interesting definition of "meltdown." It's irritation, I'm restating my point for the... What, sixth time? Seventh? It's beyond tiring trying to explain my side to such a dolt, incapable of acknowledging my opinion and pissing off, had to fight me on my opinion; I'm not one to give up ground for some fool on the internet, I'm going to hold my point. And still do, it's an inverse of it's core method of function
---
My thought on Radio hosts should depend on which fraction you sided with. Settlers keep the current DJ and if you sided with the raiders then Raider Radio, kinda like Nuka World... Or at least have dueling stations.
---
In my case I usually kill the majority as I go so my weaker friend doesn't die along the way and my other friend speeds along to get there first and get it started
---
The ”Signs and Letters” plans that you buy at the whitesprings costs for 10k caps.   
---
And yes I’m sure you completely forgot about this post because I’m four months late to the party but I was trying to google the answer to this very same question and this post was the first thing to pop up lol
---
💋💖
---
Ahhh yes mate im with you now. I know diamond city radio was set further into the future to fallout 76 but you would of thought how amazing the other radio stations were they would of did it slightly better on this game the music is great i love it as it has my favourite one but the talking is so miss timed and out of sync
---
Awwww, is the plans tradable tho for gutter? Cause I really want that sweet red and yellow blade and I'd rather not have to grind for it cause my luck has been bad this far
---
My friend how's level 20 had the opposite experience. He doesn't want to play F76 with me anymore.
---
Here is a post from an experienced player on a alt with the same problem: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/itzjc7/one\_wasteland\_is\_unreasonably\_hard\_for\_low\_level/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/itzjc7/one_wasteland_is_unreasonably_hard_for_low_level/)
---
The thing is though, to catch up this time I would need to use exploits.  I don't want to have to do that.
---
Its a 2 year old problem that has always been ignored by Bethesda
---
Ok
---
Public teams are always benefitial \^\^
---
So. Your charisma should be at 9, which gives you the ability to share a 3\* perk(makes you a better teammate)
---
IIRC, I bought mine.
---
I do know it can also be modified with the assaultron blade electrical charge mod.
---
I've got 3 of the helmets from 6 times killing earl
---
You can drop the Gutter plan without the destroy item warning prompts.
---
I was able to drop it and pick it back up.
---
The event crashed the game very frequently for one thing, due to all the constant explosions
---
not positive, but I do not believe it is. :(
---
Only glanced at it myself but this seems to be highly rated: [Linky Link](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/itd19e/i_made_an_ammo_crafting_chart_that_shows_totals/)
---
I have a uny bloodied explosive rifleman with vats and all mutation  build, now i have to keep at least half life or I die instant. Only happens when hit by lasers. Have -2 END but keep gladiator perk and ironclad, serendipity and all that Dodge stuff. I can one shot any lvl 50-60 mob, even the explosive lvl 75 blood eagles from the daily ops. But, to be killed 8nstant  by a lvl 50 comunist lamp is stupid. Also died at a train station when two super came in and shot me while browsing the vendor. At the moment when I explore, i press the vats button every few steps for surprises as I cannot see mobs and get killed easy. I think of changing to power armor for this. Funny but I died only once on the daily explosive blood eagles, I killed myself when the boss appeared. Soloing, 12 minute 40 sec because I did not know how it wirks and was running around.
---
Vampire offers no damage increase, that would be why. They didn’t before the patch either. They’re best used as supplemental weapons (if more competitive damage is the overall goal) when you’re in a bind and need some combat regeneration. 
---
Do you have a Anti Armor, Two Shot, or Furious weapon? Even a Mutants may suffice a little bit. If you are on PC I can give you an Fully modded Anti Armor Handmade for free to help you out. :)
---
Try burst fire if you haven't already, it gives the servers time to catch up. When you see the grey bit appear in the health bar try waiting till it has gone before shooting again. I found this helps a lot
---
It frees up 6 perk points, which i guess is what you mean by 2 special points. Ignoring the mini-game, the other legendary perks that add +5 stat and 5 perk points for the stat are probably a better investment, since you could offset things and use those 5 for 5/6ths of the lockpick/hack requirement.
---
You the MVP. thanks
---
Thanks for the warning but no witch-hunting in the sub is one of the main rules, so this most likely will get removed before too many people see it.
---
Damnit, cause I just made a post on the market for a plans swap
---
Let me put it this way: 
---
You take an endgame boss you add accompanying spawns and a little environmental damage for flavor. 
---
Let’s play with this formula...
---
Earl, wendigos, fire roof
---
SBQ, Scorched minions, ... 
---
The nuclear radiation from the bomb you drop on the event zone
---
People don't tell people or expect others to play the game how you play it or imagine it to be. If thats the case don't leave feed back to start flame wars.
---
I would be perfectly find spawning in radiation if I was close to where I died.
---
The problem is if you die in the even and not even be in the circle of the radiation it throws you all the way to the other side of the circle of the nuke like at "Station delta" when you died at "Drop site V9"
---
So again you are taking this conversation to the wrong points about things that bother you and not pertaining to the topic with a constructive manner.
---
Please avoid doing this.
---
Any specific area of the case I should look at
---
Got proof, I dont wanna lose my plans just cause someone told me a lie cause I'm new
---
This so exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.
---
They *got* tons of feedback about this *exact* issue on the PTS.  They ignored it.  The only way they ever give a single shit about their customers is when they stop playing or make a massively overblown fuss.  So I encourage anyone to do one of those two things.
---
I have the same gauntlet and it's obvious that now I can't oneshot a lv100 deathclaw but it's seems right to me, if I can oneshot every single thing in the game what's the difference between a molerat and a deathclaw? The loot? I know that now it's harder and most of my weapons are now crap but hey, this is a starting point for something better than the mere bloodied/Unyelding build, my only concern goes to that poor foes without a decent equip cause now even a weak feral ghoul can be a bullet sponge...
---
Oh no 1k caps goes to whoever wants to kill this mother fucked (in game of course) and let me watch i just started working on my camp
---
Honestly thought she was really awesome until i heard the same thing 30 times. Add more lines and she could easily become a fan fav
---
I have a TSE handmade; Horrible accuracy  hip fire, but quite good with the scope.
---
Lol, good thing I have an extra blade mod then. I have it on display at my little shop in my camp for looks
---
3\* Commando, expert, master, ground pounder 3\*, Tank Killer 2\*, concentrated fire 1.
---
Nerd Rage 3\*, negative 20% health. No bloody mess. Psycho or similar, no foods.
---
I'm experimenting to see what I'm doing wrong or different from before game update, if not the game then something has changed and I'm not noticing it.
---
But does it destroy the paint? Or does it go over it
---
Any other stars?
---
If you drop the nuke that way, YOU are more then welcome too.
---
But please read the topic and follow the thread in a constructive manner.
---
Side tracking off the premises that the respawn takes you far far away from the fight and in a odd spot is the issue.
---
If you're still on, I'm about to hop on for a little. Tbh, I've had pretty good luck running random groups of 4.
---
Maybe stay in pacifist if you don't want to pvp
---
It's a 3 star, the other effects are +50% damage in VATS critical shots and +250 dmg resistance while reloading
---
honestly thought you meant the rare reward camp plans like reactor etc xP
---
Good to hear.
---
I looked it up after using ammo factory rank two (along with super duper 3 and ammosmith 2) and ending up with 40+ ultracite fusion cores from only 11 standard cores and thinking, is this for real? xD
---
It’s a video-game; don’t have a heart attack.  So what it the Delvs retconned the design after watching Iron Man 3?  It needed it!  Do you think that the T-51b from FO3/NV would have actually turned the tide of a war?  Do you think that the jinky design would stop even a 7.62 round?  Because I’ve witnessed what a 7.62 round does to vehicle armor in reality and the old design is garbage.  The lore made a point that a single soldier in power armor could pacify a small city but that old design wouldn’t handle 4 rounds from an AK.
---
It works but it takes too much time to trigger. You can test it by shooting an enemy one time, wait a second and shoot again.
---
exactly. subtle, mild and/or quirky effects are best suited to legendary perks as your right, nobody wants to grind out 300 levels just to finish a build.
---
ok where do i take the 1 point from
---
Deathclaws are *still* easy, they just take more bullets.  To make things an *actual* threat, instead of just tedious bullet sponges, you can give them good AI, special abilities, and maybe a little more damage.  Those first two take *effort* though, so the third one is the only one I think we might actually see.
---
Yep, I've never had armor break so fast before. Didn't Bethesda say during daily ops armor and weapon condition would degrade more slowly? Why do I need to repair at least 3 pieces of armor 1-2x per session? I have fairly high durability marine and heavy combat armor. I'm fo1st and basically always out of adhesive and ballistic fiber on my new character. Ridiculous.
---
I’m not a pa user myself but I had always thought that they should start making mods for the pa frames themselves that way they can introduce new mods and allow for different play styles without taking up existing mod space. Some ideas I had was a combat frame that increases ap refreash and dr bonus but drains cores slightly faster. Reenforced frame that gives significant bonus to carry weight, increase dr but a slight reduction to movement speed and jump height. Recon frame that gives increased movement speed, jump height, and to make your HUD in you pa act as a recon scope but with a decrease to dr.
---
This had me very frustrated. crap support from Bathesda as I discovered this after spending 150 pomts to level the card, and it did not have the expected effect. Found this post in a Google search afterwards. Now, I'm stuck with unequiping at a the cost of a perk coins and with zero I fo on what that means for the 150 already spent. Literally no meaningful response to my straight forward questions on what to wxp xr should I unequip. Seems as Though I eight have just loss the benefit of the last 75 levels if I cannot reassign the point toward another card. CHA 6 - legendary took it to 9. Of I keep it this way - what happens when I want to build up to share a 5 point card? Anyone experienced in unequip for these cards yet? Apparently Bathesda support is not.  Now,  a dissatisfied '1st' member. There is no excuse for not informing people of this problem.
---
There just isn't a topic, chief. It's a one sentence title with no post under it. That sentence is a question that reads as rhetorical to an implied audience (the devs) that is like 2 people on this forum who probably won't read it. 
---
My answer for your question is that radiation is the environmental hazard for the SBQ endgame boss and it is working as intended.
---
Things I would consider:
---
* Weapon (handmade I'm guessing)
---
* Stealth or not stealth
---
* Headshot or not
---
* Close enough engagement range (too far and you're just losing damage per bullet efficiency)
---
* Taking on too many enemies at once so they find you and you lose any stealth bonuses (assuming you were using any in the first place)
---
* Crit frequency and activation (are you even using crits efficiently)
---
* Any buffs being used/not used
---
He Mandy, I gave another try yesterday, less bloodied and it was ok. I I think forget nerve rage and just go half health. Daily ops not as bad as the first day :-) I wish we would get more do for each level 100 we kill, cheeky bethesda!

Maybe it was a radrat? Radstag? I wasn’t there, I was doing dailies on the other side of the map. Something that she would have easily handled before, kicked her ass and she got all bummed about the update. Ive never been killed by a radroach myself, so I totally agree. Hell, maybe she was afk. Our battle stations are in different rooms.

If you're on xbox I can give you an anti armour gatling gun level 50 as shotgunner and heavy gunner are nearly interchangeable with perks as they both use strength for damage cards

Today I finished in 7.5 min in the Galleria (Big thanks to the PA saint who did most of the work!), ended up with the Warglaive plans and the Vault 94 Jumpsuit plans.
---
Again what your responding is not constructive to the conversation.
---
server hop at the cranberry glade location make sure your perk is on while you hop servers
---
edit: animal friend rank 3 is all you need
---
I would love some better hairstyles at least! I'd pay good Atoms for that.
---
This nerf is compensated by more available ammo, just fire some more shots and voila, all builds are viable again.
---
Yeah, damage dropoff is insane now. That and the concetrated fire nerf makes medium-long targets pretty much impossible to kill now.

And sure, you can see my build [https://imgur.com/a/I019TFu](https://imgur.com/a/I019TFu)

lmao what I'm saying is the conversation, i'm the only one who replied to this thread. take the hint. I'm gonna stop now. I wish u well tho plz consider getting rad protection for that fight a lot of mobs do serious rad damage!
---
All good, you didn't design it. I'll still rock it.
---
I do have two shot and anti armor gauss shotguns from last roll, I'll try those out and see what happens. If nothing else this game update has mixed things up so experimentation is back on the table and is interesting I guess.
---
I can't lie though the bullet sponge feeling is new, must get used to change.
---
No way bro, you have to kill everything. Why else would they make stealth not work. -This sub.
---
As daily ops are an infinite source of tightly packed enemies it would make sense that they drop the xp down a bit for them
---
I still hate the freeze attacks. Not necessarily difficult but very annoying
---
This is big true. Fight enemys on the objectives. Move A to B. I dont rage on people, I just mind my own but sometimes it's just a PTFO. I came real close to soloing it in the Burrows a few days ago. (8:01) I would love to see a OP based on killing scattered mobs incentivising people to split up and go hog wild. Really I got no complaints on the OPs tho. Silly teammates or no.
---
Damn dude, chill.
---
I love ammo factory.. It's been a literal game changer for me. You can never have too much ammo!
---
On my level 68 and level 21 I'm having no Difficulties fighting low tier enemies. Only enemies having difficult fighting are the higher tier Enemies which it should be like that. I'm going to say it again I don't see a problem with it and some person Complaining about it isn’t going to change my mind let's just Agree to disagree.
---
The war glaive, if you have it, has a cold mod plan in vault 79.
---
Display damage doesn't really matter imo. Maybe I've always been bugged, but my damage displayed never changed all that drastically. I have to go by testing on a mob.
---
He's talking about the dipshits that run out of the staging area and start the timer before everyone is ready.
---
If you wait for everyone to load in you can hang out in the entry way and load up on lunchboxes, chems, share perks, etc before actually starting the timer.

This is where the flamethrower or auto-grenade launcher is your friend.

Well, yes, but also no.

Players wanted more of a challenge, and mostly wanted Bloodied to not be the hideously overpowered thing it was by the absurdly wide margin it had been.  If we're going to abandon all nuance when approaching those issues, then yeah, mission successful.  But the problem is that for many people (myself included) believe that Beth went *too far* in one direction, and now the game is *overtuned.*
---
I think the primary issue right now is that enemy mobs have WAY too much health and armor for their levels, which is making them feel like absolute damage sponges.  Hopefully it's an easy enough fix for Bethesda/Zenimax, and they can bring that down.  Because right now the average enemy difficulty out in the world feels like what Daily Ops enemy difficulty should be.
---
Hey Yiphix, the TSE GP that was up for trade is no longer available.
---
1st test result, full hp, no damage perks: furious explosive, hair trigger capacitor, standard grip, stabilized auto barrel, beam splitter, reflex sight. When all pellets land, 50% hp per shot in both vats and outside of vats on lv 50 super mutants at horizons nest. Chest shots - I walked really close for the non vats one. 
---
2nd test result, full hp, no damage perks, but junkies explosive and kept addictions. Same exact mod loadout as above. 4 out of 5 full pellet vats was KO, while one was 50% damage (Tested a few times since first was KO, then second was 50% - which was identical to FE and very odd) then all the rest were KO. Likely some magic there. Outside of vats, one hit was 30% may have missed some. Next was 50% of hp. Then ran out of mutants.
---
Without going into vats they are similar in damage dealt against the same enemy, at the same location, with the same level, using the same mods and lack of perks (my unremoved addictions is the factor that impacts the control of this test). 
---
Vats still only benefits "magic" variant like junkies shotgun even for laser, it seems, since FE did not see a boost in damage during vats.
---
Nonetheless, they are stupid powerful. 2 hits to kill a lv 50 mutant using lv 0 perks.
---
On demo expert, i need to report back after i run another radiation rumble or meditation event. Those guys got enough hp.
---
Why bother having the perks available if they're no longer useful? You're essentially telling this person play an archetype build or stop playing.
---
And what level are you? I'm guessing north of 100 at least.
---
Forcing people to use builds is not the answer.
---
And that's bad.
---
When did this radio host come in? I thought she was from a mod I had or something.
---
It’s alright.  Not worth 4K caps in my opinion.
---
Why?
---
Closest I’ve gotten was 8:43, need to keep working at it I guess
---
•_•
---
I'll keep searching then
---
I actually did bother with the freezing mutants. Reason? I just couldn’t take constantly having the slow effect applied to me.
---
Yeah that’s what I am saying. Who cares if they are ready. I’m gonna solo it regardless. If they want to fuck around in the entry way that’s fine I’m not wasting time. Besides as soon as the first person spawns in enemies begin to spawn. It’s just making it more difficult for everyone.
---
I... think you mean sentinel.
---
I've been playing since Beta. The game changes. To quote Gunny Hiway "Adapt, Improvise , and overcome. " 
---
Quit or don't. Bitching at other players solves nothing.
---
I don’t know, that OP today was a sweater.
---
I meant cavalier for running the gauntlet and sprinting from uplink to uplink.
---
You need to start using and linking to our friend...
---
[https://nukesdragons.com](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/)
---
People will be able to help you more easily otherwise we have to guess your build.
---
Not at all, it gives some viability to other builds for damage at least. Bloodied is still the king for everything other aspect of the game, only now there are some weapons that can outclass it in certain situations
---
Mid-level youngster here who's in the same boat as you! Hopefully they make some changes soon.
---
Why not just start an alt? You can run 5 on a Bethesda account. I've done the same thing without the lose.
---
yesterday I tried it with my flamer and got the following results:
---
standing, 226, sneaking, 301, sneaking + covert ops 3, 338.
---
just tested it with a combat knife too, and got:
---
standing, 57, sneaking, 87
---
so it's clearly working. it's just nowhere near a 2\* bonus.
---
I also had covert ops on, which I believe is bugged and working with melee weapons as well.
---
I dunno man, I need to keep my fat man feed somehow. 13 mininukes per craft sounds pretty good to me.
---
You're basing this on... Observations? Because that's useless, you said it yourself it's a video game, and vehicle armor isn't titanium. If we're talking observations, practically none of the armor other than combat armor in other games would protect you from something bigger than 10mm, the fact you can use leather alone is absurd. It's size doesn't change the fact the the armor was designed to fit the wearer to maximize mobility. I don't think the old design was the best, actually I rather like the idea of it being a large suit, but there's still lore that predates BGS here, there was a purpose in the old design being tight fitting. All of that still wasn't the unitsissue for me. My biggest gripe is with fusion cores, and the sheer absurdity of the chassis.
---
Thankfully we won’t have to worry about people turning around and heading to a lost sector to farm lol
---
Me level 170 heavy gunner
---
My friend level 270 heavy gunner
---
My friend a level 230 non meta commando
---
A random level 57 with a deathclaw gauntlet
---
I broke 2 .50cals that both started at half health and switched to a gatling gun to finish
---
The other heavy gunner was a bloodied explosive minigun
---
The other 2 played with the wendigos but definitely didn't keep them off me and the other heavy gunner and didn't do any damage to earl, we killed earl in under 20 mins (didn't help that I broke my guns)
---
It does help but sometimes enemies notice you
---
It’s the total scrapping and fresh beginning that makes it fun. Nothing to rely on. Everything is new. A completely fresh start in every aspect. There is something about that for me that makes it sweeter to play
---
Yeah, no. 
---
Bloodied is meant to be high risk, high reward. Top damage, but can die if a fly lands on you. If something out damages it, while not having to take any risks? That's broken.
---
What other things would you recommend?
---
Aquaboy/girl negated the rads from Toxic Good before this last patch.  Your armor, esp if it's Secret Service, has a certain amount of rad resist and this will mess with the goo rads it imparts. When I take it as a bloodied build and I'm wearing the armor I get a whopping 47 rads per use only.
---
I wouldn’t say idiocy. I’d say they are using their resources elsewhere - IE building all of the brotherhood of steel expansion.
---
Was going to ask this aswell. Will have to do this on all my 4 chars per day then :)
---
The annoying guy from fo4 is worst
---
Nope, multiplicative
---
*Stength:*
---
Add in blocker because, as a shotgunner, you have to get in close and personal. This perk has a good synergy with your main class.
---
*Perception:*
---
I've lowered perception to 7 in order to raise strength to 15(for blocker) and charisma to 9.
---
Using every type of rifleman at rank 1 gives you more bang for your buck.
---
Since tank killer wasn't affected by the update(it's based on your enemie's armor and not your weapon's damage) it's wise to throw it in there.
---
*Endurance:*
---
A shotgunner usually soaks up damage and needs to tank better, that's why I recommend you to use lifegiver at max rank to increase your hp by 45 points. This also synergizes well with stimpaks since they heal based on %, not numbers,
---
*Charisma:*
---
In a public team, lone wanderer isn't an option and hard bargain is kind of useless for the team. Since you're close and personal with your enemies, most of the time, the suppressor perk works well with your shotguns(and rifles).
---
I've also added tenderizer to increase your DPS a bit, it's always worth it.
---
Seen as you are running towards enemies, you will take hits and use stimpaks more often than rifleman players, team medic is worth it's points. Everyone gets a heal out of you, making you a very important piece of any public team, be it in boss fights or daily ops,
---
Field surgeon complements team medic because it makes your stimpaks heal faster.
---
**You can swap team medic and field surgeon out when you're playing alone.**
---
*Intelligence:*
---
Shotguns break fast, so as QOL, I would recommend you to use gunsmith at max level to counteract this.
---
It's also good to throw first aid in there to boost your stimpaks even further.
---
*Agility:*
---
Enforcer is the best choice you can make as a shotgunner, period.
---
Since you take longer to fight enemies(thanks, update) your armor breaks faster and besides,  your build isn't specced at all for stealth, so covert operative is kind of useless, That's why I suggest you to use white knight. It's a neat perk.
---
Adrenaline is always good for any build, so use it!
---
*Luck:*
---
Bloody mess is always a good choice for any build. 15% extra base damage is always nice.
---
Since you're playing shotguns with VATS, I suggest grim reaper's sprint to give you the chance to regain all AP on a kill.
---
Lastly, I also suggest you to use tormentor to at least have a small chance to cripple your enemies at range.
---

---
That's all, hope it helps.
---
I use the unstoppable monster, something similar might help, it’s a deathclaw gauntlet with a bloody effect
---
What?!?
---
Stacks, sort of kind ofish
---
Bloodied heavy weapon power armor build by angry turtle is the best ive seen
---
I adjusted my bloodied stealth unarmed non power armor build to be a half health tank with decent damage without changing much.
---
The proof would be trying to drop it yourself. 
---
Bethesda warns you if you're dropping something that will be destroyed. They give you a window that you have to acknowledge to drop/destroy the item.
---
You scrap excess perk cards you don’t want.
---
Not sort-of-ish. It does
---
&gt; I’m gonna solo it regardless.
---
Then go be fucking rambo by yourself instead of joining a team and potentially fucking up someone else's run. 
---
 &gt;If they want to fuck around in the entry way that’s fine I’m not wasting time. 
---
Again, the time doesn't start until someone leaves the entryway. 
---
&gt;Besides as soon as the first person spawns in enemies begin to spawn. 
---
That's not true, but go ahead and keep playing Rambo and giving people over.
---
Dude, thanks for the fact checking and keeping things straight.  I was curious as to why more peeps were not vocally disgruntled with the change.
---
Well, it only procs off of base ammo, not upgraded amount
---
Regularly updated radio announcements?
---
You're asking a lot of a small indie game studio like Bethesda.
---
Ah ok
---
Who cares, they obviously put the cores in as a balancing mechanic.  Besides, with the right alloys, many of those armors would do better than you think.  Sidenote, mobility wouldn’t really be the issue that you think it is when considering stride and chances are that the US military would be operating power armor units as fireteams at the minimum.  They’d swap each other’s cores like we’re forced to do buddy checks in MOPP gear now.
---
I get that. I've heard people doing similar stuff in other games like Animal Crossing. I've done similar things outside of 76.
---
Can you also give it a riding crop or a whip as well?  
---
For the horses, of course!  That.. aren't... in the game...   😳
---
Yeah the ss sell it for gold
---
Now if you want to rant, I could understand the exposed hoses on the helmet but still, there’s more important things in life.
---
Thanks for the helpful info, this game can be quite complicated.
---
Handmade yes, bloodied, vampire's at the moment and now experimenting with gauss shotguns, bloodied, vampire's and anti armor.
---
Concentrated fire 1\* so locked to head shots, not using stealth perks or play style now, was always in Danger/Caution anyway so change out cards to defence.
---
Definitely noticing range distance damage changes, have been waiting until mutants are closer but then get frozen and locked up.
---
At the Valley Galleria the mutant numbers engaged is not in my control. 
---
Not using crits, on PC I have always found the keyboard activation awkward, at least my fumble fingers can't manage it.
---
Only a hot key drug, psycho or psychotats, no foods.
---
Yeah people keep saying this, but its not for sale at either camp. Only the  **ArmCo ammunition construction appliance**  appears at the moment.
---
Why does he keep running to the Dam? He should escape further! /s
---
I’ve seen a few in player vendors, but pretty rare.
---
As a side tip to everyone, the ops are great sources of caps (sellable stimpacks) and ammo, I just take out my gatling gun and all enemies drop loads of 5mm ammo which can be converted for other stuff and stimpacks which sell for good money at vendors, unless Beth nerf it, I don't see the need to craft ammo ever again with these missions.
---
Full team give me more exp, so obviously I’m not gonna do it in a solo group. How does me finishing the  daily op under 8 mins fuck up someone else run? And yes I’ve done the event plenty of time that as soon as someone spawns enemies begin to spawn and converge on the first room.
---
Two Bob Wills songs! Two! I'm happy.
---
Bring it
---
You better not be one of those pansies that take two shots to kill... what’s your GT?
---
You clearly have no idea how to use bloodied then, I can stand Infront of the queen and take 10+ hits from her at 20% health. With the right perks and armour the bloodied build is the toughest out there.
---
Bloodied builds have so many more advantages over every other build
---
Highest damage resistance/avoidance
---
Highest perception
---
Highest sneak
---
Highest strength
---
Most XP earned
---
This list seems endless for all the perks of playing a low health build, so surely the fact that now some weapons will outclass it in certain situations is only fair. 
---
Bloodied will only ever lose its viability of the reduce the effects of unyeilding armour or place a cap on stat boosts.
---
Because I didn't get into fallout mid maxing or playing other characters builds. Its my character, my play style and actual balance doesn't punish it unless its pvp focused. Even then thats bs
---
Oh dear god this sounds crazy then lol
---
Thanks for saying what we're all thinking. I'm so fucking tired of hearing her story about trying to inspire me.. I swear I've just changed it back to classical because of that segment alone.
---
My thoughts exactly...
---
450%
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
You're not a stealth boy pansy are ya?
---
I get your point but in most other MMO's you also can't change around your perks on the fly like with 76. Sure unlocking the cards takes time and switch around stats can take time but unlike other (and in this instance better) MMO's you aren't stuck in a particular build.
---
Only to stop people VATSing me. I’ll even give you some Berry Mentats.
---
It's with the ss. In v79.
---
Lmao stop bitching, it'snot even hard to solo Elder.
---
As an ammo seller I definitely agree
---
I totally read that in Jerry's voice.
---
Imagine that I am playing as unarmed build while my friend is killing everything around the uplink - last two of the ops are literally me standing near the little thingy while being shot at and my friend gets all of xp. I wish there was a way for me to also get xp when he kills them, because he rn gotten 25 lvls ahead (before ops he was like 1-2 lvls)
---
Personally I think it isn't as bad as some folks are claiming to be, but it still needs tweaking, this is a sandbox survival game after all, not Call of Duty Battle Royale, maybe I just want to chill and take a walk through some areas without the constant hassle of having to deal with high level mobs. It doesn't need to be difficult all the time, that's what needs balance.
---
It would be much more interesting to make these high level encounters random, with a chance to get low level things in the mix. And some enemies should have a level cap according their class; I get supermutants being tough and a menace, fits with the lore, but a level 76 oversized mosquito, really? They just went the complete opposite side with these changes.
---
What system you on?
---
It also paves the way for some boss fights with more challenging mechanics than unending spawns of underlings.
---
Did Queen and Earl today. Silos even with skips are BARELY worth running. I have a Queen platform and will still run her because the XP is great. Earl, however, takes way too much time and isn’t even close to worth it. I realized from this post that daily ops are probably what I’ll be grinding from here on out with some Queens in between.
---
Ps4
---
What kind of LMG you looking for exactly?
---
I feel the pain, i literally only use an instigating 3 star western revolver and a silenced lever action. 
---
I used to do great, but after coming back from a hiatus my character is severely nerfed.
---
Also I'm stealth based and I swear everything can see me now!
---
We've come full circle, when the game came out there was just songs, people were complaining about a lack of radio DJ, so Beth added Julia. Now we want it back to how it was!
---
Imagine all the stable flux the great workbench in the sky is hoarding.
---
And mix with different objectives, the idea of fixing thing, then standing near to thing and killing bad guy in that exact order every time is very boring.
---
I wouldn't mind a defense scenario for example with you building turrets and walls of a small location, or a sneak without being seeing to steal some documents or experimental technology from west tek.
---
Things that could make things real interesting you know.
---
I'm a melee build too, and just bring a gun. A shotgun or heavy gun will do. I bring a gauss shotgun or gauss minigun.
---
Nice one! I got the plans for the scavanged solar panel yesterday, but I'm not sure how rare that is.
---
Difference is that the level 1 is FREE to free 2 to 4 special, you dont need to level that perk
---
Oh God, I'm getting flash backs to Arnold Swarzeneggar as Mr. Freeze in that Batman &amp; Robin movie
---
Okay...and? You’re still getting more ammo regardless.
---
I get you, but I think I'd cry if I scrapped my 76 main. I do what you mention though in previous fallout and elder scrolls games. Nothing like a fresh start. 👍
---
Nah…current op is not playable for stealth build. [Danger] right after you step in. My agility is 3x with every stealth related perk mounted.
---
Okay I saw Mortimer sells an "Ammo Converter" for 1250 gold. But doesn't he ALSO sell the  **ArmCo ammunition construction appliance?** So.... he sells both? I don't see the ArmCo one, but maybe its because my rank isn't high enough? Im not sure.
---
How did Bethesda not mention anywhere anything about this?
---
Not everyone uses power armor, you are a specific type of player.
---
Just checked. The secret service guy Regs definitely does not sell this item.
---
I actually didn't mind it. It's probably much cheaper than paying a fee for the real song. Same goes for Country Roads.
---
Wish they’d rework its ui, its shit.
---
Spam radaway and run like hell. I assume youve got a backpack mod preventing you from using PA.
---
Relative rankings all pretty much remained the same. Don't let anyone tell you that bloodied have been nerfed into the ground. Their damage is considerably less but they're still sitting on the top of the meta.
---
Only major differences is that melee as a collective slid down the ranks and explosives are sliding up, especially AAE and TSE.
---
Todd Howard is my name, false advertisement is my game.
---
Yes.  But it doesn't stack with the ammo perks
---
I wish I took it instead of Follow Poo.
---
I don't even notice this alleged +40% Dmg.
---
Thanks for the feedback.  I hate to burn more of you time, but what level is your max character and what is it's build?
---
Not sure about the numbers but with both rank 2 ammo factory and ammosmith I'm crafting about 600 ultracite 50 cal and around 300 ultracite 308's
---
😂👍
---
I love how his stories changed occasionally. His content was pretty good, I just wish we got more of it. When you play this game for hundreds of hours over it's lifetime every voice line gets stale.
---
Same thing happened to me. Was very shocking to hear that Frankie was being buried alive.
---
They were considered walking tanks, and 100% were, they did the support, not received it, and served a purpose similar to what a Panzer I might, heavy weapons platform more or less. Mobility would be an issue in a land invasion of one of the biggest and most populated countries in the world, now most certainly completely hostile, which the us at the time did. Fusion cores are hardly a balancing feature, they're literally everywhere in 4 and 76, not mentioning power plants. I wasn't criticizing the design of the plating, if I were, I wholly agree, exposed tubes, poorly covered rear joints, pauldrons that are needlessly over the top, combined with a very... Interesting, helm design, resulting in the neck being a practical shell trap, poor range of arm motion, and limited field of view especially in X01, the list goes on, but I'm taking mostly about how the armor was assembled and powered, it's combat effectiveness is a reasonable as a small hospital room diagnostics machine on your arm or a regrown limb in a syringe that isn't 30 pounds and doesn't make you shit yourself.
---
Or... or just hear me out.. She gives us missions to bring her a different flavor of Nuka Cola and we can get like plans and stuff from her.
---
Black Mountain Radio is truly ahead of it's time.
---
Damn, I wouldn't know. I've never had one before. Id rather have one with a shit UI than not one at all.
---
at rank 1 you will generate a new survival stim well before your food and drink run out so the only reason to keep food/drinks is for their buffs
---
I agree regarding about starting afresh as for me some of the most fun are in the first 50-60 odd levels.
---
However, don't you have spare character slots for an alt, rather than scrapping a main?
---
Lmfao , hopefully stealth works for these missions. Gonna be a lot of pissed off stealth builds thinking it will work correctly for once 🤣
---
Ever watch the opening animation to FO1?
---
That's an interesting thing that you found out.
---
But I think it is smarter to approach your opponents than to wait for them to come to you.
---
The final boss has never made it out of his first room so far.
---
Waiting until it comes into the great hall costs way too much time
---
Interested what your main unarmed weapon of choice is now post patch?
---
Also your legendary perks you have decided to adopt, I feel like trying the move from bloodied to a full health... something build. Still deciding.
---
The Great Workbench in the Sky, where Super Duper goes off with EVERY craft.
---
No, it's not MEANT to be played any specific way.  It's a sandbox rpg.  There are tools for people who want to just RP, tools for people who want to trade, build, fight, explore, socialize.  There is no right way to play, and theres zero reason not to make an attempt to satisfy as many people as possible, including you, which you could easily have done (and could still do by tweaking) that with a different approach than just nerf everyone.
---
It’s been a pretty big shift in some ways for me, my build was never optimized so even though I’ve played a long time I was never one shotting much, high lvl ghouls and SM would be 1-2 head shots, now they are 3-4 no biggie there, I can live with that. Max lvl deathclaws if I had stealth it would be 4-6 shots to take it down, if I don’t have stealth maybe 20 rounds. Well I went up against one today max lvl glowing, and I only tickled it before I lost stealth and was running for my life, I put about 200 rounds into from the safety of a door way. Before it would take me several hundred rounds and a few mins to take down a scorchbeast, I haven’t come up against one yet and I’m a little worried At lvl 205 I might have it run. I’m not complaining, the game was pretty easy before. I know I’ll have to take the game a lot more seriously and either revamp my current build or change play styles and adopt a meta build. I’m not going to be able to successfully play this game the same way that I’ve been playing for over 700hrs.
---
You can mix it up a little with all the modes we have seen in every game known to man.
---
Defend the &lt;insert something here like an antenna, fusion generator, etc&gt;, protect the carrier (flag style gameplay a player grabs an item, he/she walks slower and has to get to point B, the rest defend), hack / lockpick mazes, hell you could even do some really bizarre ones like feeding a caged friendly Deathclaw by looting meat from creature bodies and then it helps you...
---
Most of these ideas already are present as different events in the game, it's just a matter of they doing things differently.
---
What weapon though? Defense perks don't increase damage.
---
Enemies scale now, so it doesn't really matter too much what level you are.  Just make sure you're near the  points, and do what you can.
---
Who cares about deathclaws where's the good cat spawns
---
I'll take those mentats, or we can both agree to not use VATS, doesnt matter to me either way.
---
Please share your build, that would be interesting to see.
---
Everyone has access to those tools. Literally everyone. Your complaint is like saying that we all had access to the same ten steam engines and a push cart and that because you chose to take the push cart that us who took the steam engines should have a lesser experience
---
Depends. It gives all your weapon a 15% boost on your base weapon damage.
---
That's the same boost from going 6 Perk Points in Rifleman to 9 Perk Points. But for all weapon.
---
When you use more then one type of weapon it's a must have.
---
BUt when you don't want to max out everthing and want to get some quality of life perks then the few extra damage isn't worth it.
---
But then again it all depends on your weapon use. When you use The Fixer it gives you only 7 extra damage...
---
For the Black Powder Rifle you get a boost of 27 extra damage.
---
Same! Nothing pops up anymore. Plus I'm always "caution" or "danger". With The dang Chinese stealth armor, with full stealth perks and a silenced lever action. 
---
I'm literally invisible and they find me
---
Several times, What of it? That five second bit of *propaganda* showing soldiers executing someone?
---
As long as you stayed by the up link id have no issue with you being there. Anything else you do is extra
---
yesterday ive encountered the same problem, damage numbers where highly inconsistent
---
ive yet to see a statement from bethesda on the topic
---
the single best thing you can do to help in daily ops is staying by the uplinks or whatever they're called.
---
most people there probably have more than enough firepower to take on the enemies or the boss, but soloing it is so difficult because linking A and B take so goddamn long.
---
So I can still squeeze in that one second coffee break, awesome!
---
Casual can mean a lot of things, it's a very loose term.  You could play every day and be a "casual".  I play a lot and I think I'm a pretty casual player, honestly.
---
I'm only running one toon currently L190. I was, and sorta still am, stealth rifleman. Use Instigating Fixer. I swap to Commando on Quad HM for Daily Ops with as many damage mitigation perks as I can. I've not died once, hit Elder 3/3 times first attempt. 
---
I also have Field Surgeon and Squad Manuevers for daily ops to maximise speed and healing as I've found its less to do with damage and more to do with starting the uplink cycles and covering ground and just enduring a beating on the fly.
---
I know, I just went back to Ace.
---
My favourite time on 76 was when i just started and had crap to survive with and had to be resourceful (both with perk picks and utilising weapons I had to hand) One Wasteland has given me that feeling back to a degree, I can't just one shot entire groups anymore, i have to think a bit now about how I approach an issue
---
now to level up to fix every thing that might take a few how do i get a lower level of a card if i have rank 3 of each riflemen i know card packs is that the only way
---
Yeah, your experience is pretty typical for a lot of people.

As you alluded to, I think that there's just an adjustment period that we're going to need to go through. For both us an Bethesda. Us for how to better handle the new way of things and Bethesda to tweak things around so that they don't cater to just one corner of the community whilst neglecting the casual not-min-maxing, not-try-hard crowd.
---
&gt;Updated damage calculation  
---
&gt;should work for everything except 2\* Explosive legendary, Gauss and Melee
---
I mention it here already... And fo76calc is still in development
---
I asked a question. You answered. I was seeking clarification, that is a contribution to anyone else wondering the same thing. 
---
Sorry the laughter offended you. It is practically a meme at this point that people call whatever aspect of PvP they don't like "griefing" so I found the post humorous.
---
I have no idea why you're being downvoted for telling the truth
---
Follow Through. Max it.
---
like in fallout 3
---
Cats last about 2 seconds as Tamed Pets.
---
Hey everyone! Did you guys hear the tale of that Dweller /u/SadCrab5 ? I heard he died at the hands of a horde of Level 50 deer! Hahaha!
---
You enter as a man, you exit the chamber making Twitch donations to Enclave e-girls.
---
Please say you give stuff away before you scrap a main... It’s a real shame if you just waste any good weapons and armor you picked up.
---
I'm not much of a PA user.  Really only use it when. Absolutely necessary for radiation purposes.
---
When you level up you can pick cards, or switch specials.
---
Imagine getting Whistle in the Dark, and knowing you'll never use it.
---
I don't use any build or gear that gimps my character like Bloodied or Junkies.    
---
I'm still testing out Rifle b/c it's a mixed thing. Shotgun is still doing good given you have all the related perks maxed out.    
---
It takes a couple more shots but in VATS it's killer.
---

---
I'm fond of the one by Firebase Hancock down in the Bog. I've gotten 3 DeathClaws there. It did take a decent bit of server hopping.  
---
And don't get too attached, nowhere is safe for Tamed Pets anymore.
---
Yeah, or read through the dialogue in New Reno while wearing power armor?  The redesign needed to happen. As for fusion core balancing?  They weighed about 4 lbs is survival mode and though they were easy to come by, you didn’t run around with a hundred in your inventory.
---
Sidenote, they totally ripped the idea off of Heinlein and I think that it does justice to his vision also.
---
Wow, thank you ^^
---
[nukesdragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76)  or it didn't happen👍
---
Because people are butt hurt that the game isn't easy anymore.
---
My concern is that the scaling. I like to treat Fallout 76 like a retirement home for me as far as the game goes. I finished the MQ, I don't care about the Bullion grind gear or any grinds. I just like to casually frolic in the Forest region. The last thing I want to do is fuck some newbie over due to my presence.
---
you mean an Insultron? 😂
---
It was the first rare reward I got from Daily Ops and probably the most useful one out of the bunch. Great quality of life improvement.
---
I’m not saying it solves the damage problem, and I agree with you that Lone wanderer should be buffed. However I run 4 Charisma which is enough for rank 3 inspirational (+15%xp when on a team, this works when solo on a public team), and stranger in numbers. Have you ever tried jumping with marsupial, bird bones, and then added in stranger in numbers? It makes a huge difference. Throw in Herd mentality (+2 to all perks when on a team) and then, for me, it’s worth it to be on a team vs running lone wanderer. Even if they added a damage buff, which would be small knowing Bethesda, I wouldn’t run lone wanderer. Just my opinion though!
---
Thanks for your feedback!
---
I didn't understand the bloody mess example since is it 0, 5, 10, 15.
---
On the left side of the of the weapon name is a reload icon, it's reset the value to zero.
---
I look if i can add a quick swap button for 0.
---
yeah...
---
Oh man thank God.  I was worried about this event until I knew I had an extra second. This is totally repeatable now that I know this.
---
Got a link to one of those pictures? So far I ended up with 2 elder runs that yielded nothing, same with a friend of mine. So excuse me if I’m somewhat skeptical 🤨
---
It sounds like you should take it as a compliment tho, bro. They target you cuz they don't want to have to fight you.
---
No it's not rare I just want it since it be perfect for my camp lol. I mean it's rare this moment but in a week or two it will be everywhere. Someone just showed up and placed it for free so couldn't ask for anything more!
---
Bloodied explosive fixer and bloodied ffr handmade both with less vats cost.
---
You can get 4. i know I did. I think they can spawn at 50/75% instead of 100 though. Still solid so long you can beat it under 2 half full cores . In my runs I used maybe 700 shots, and mine is Vampire, +10% ADS, 250DR while reloading.
---
nvm, my bad, misstranslated the german perks
---
Underrated comment
---
Trying to understand a collective made up of many people with very different preferences on how the game should be balanced is impossible. I would rather suck on Chally's irradiated teat then attempt such a feat.
---
Not exactly rare. If you get elder the chance of getting a unique reward is 80%
---
Yeah, you don't even have to kill anything, just keep the point until you move to the next one.
---
What is SMS?
---
Adding all sorts of damage type legendary effects would be fun. I'm not sure what fire damage actually does other than maybe some dot but nonetheless I want it and freezing
---
I don't see how propaganda assists your argument, but I grasp your position. About fusion core frequency, if you had four on you you would guaranteeably find more before you ran out, no matter where you'd most likely find one if you used one up. I do like the way the did the propaganda bit tho, just like modern ads it's shows the stuff you wanna see and not the buracracy and how dictator-esque higher ups can be at times. I appreciate your willingness to explain, opposite to simply throwing petty counters of no relevance. I think I have a way to make both sides Happy, and that's *make finding power armor a major achievement again.* Like, in fallout one and two finding power armor was something really notable, it wasn't handed to you in the first five minutes of actual gameplay, you had to work for it, and unlike three you didn't have to face mostly little but power armor clad enemies you could take it off of for the entire second half of the game, excluding if you finished operation anchorage and could get power armor training and a full suit before even facing dad
---
it’s like the only thing I truly grind for now that’s good to here it still happens
---
So what did you fix? Sneak commando here. Struggling a bit.
---
Yea but you're supposed to go to the mothman furniture set and read that also to see what's all included in that. If you don't break down each thing included in the bundles that's on you. /s
---
&gt; Once you start unlocking slots, you can have an unlimited number of them. However, unlocking additional Legendary Perk slots takes exponentially larger amounts of time after the first one.
---
Questioning how accurate that article is.
---
You know what we did wrong? we need more libarays.  
---
I could write a story about you without you saying a single word.
---
Or however those quotes are translated to english.
---
Don’t worry about it
---
People don't seem to be running her anymore. I haven't seen a nuke dropped on fissure prime at all the last two days. Or was I just unlucky?
---
There should be a confetti perk card.
---
I suck at math, but I legit thought this was a 'me' problem, not something to do with the game.   
---
I have maxed strength and, as soon as I hit level 60, went from being awesome to doing almost zero damage and breaking at least 2 weapons per instance. My armour breaks super fast now too, and I had no idea why until I saw this post.
---
Are you sure? Everyone tells me it just adds one extra bullet after a nerf a while back.
---
You know the sad thing is, as much as this post drips with sarcasm this could easily be a legit complaint and rant thread from this sub after an uodate and the OP wouldn't have to change a word and I'd believe it.
---
I agree, but she is a nice personable and kind change from the annoying awkward (or overtly cocky if you wasted breath doing the quest) nature of fours or new vegas' monotonous mr new vegas
---
Haha same exact thing happened to me today clearing out some bog squatters. 4 raiders and a Mirelurk Queen for some reason. 
---
Did a kangaroo jump in the air to fire some shots....
---
I set my camp up near the lead-acid cliffs cave in the Savage Divide, and I built the outside as a welcoming, fancy, modern house - with a locked secret fireplace door leading into the acid extractor cave. Here I set it up as a little den of horror, surgery and chemical experiments, radiation barrels and flesh piles scattered about. The sympto-matic fit right in, and I also want the "Doc is in" Chem Den sign.
---
I’ve found if you wait to loot bodies until after especially ones out of the uplink zone you get done faster plus any bodies you miss and can be looted after you complete the op but don’t leave the dungeon
---
He's not bootlicking, he's literally explaining the actual state of the game whilst we have halfwits saying they're dying to a single radroach whilst they're in Power Armor
---
I'm on windows 10 so when I just miss something I use gamebar to just save a clip of whatever I missed out on
---
Forget about make-believe ‘stealth’, use structures, take cover, fight it like it’s real, real enemies aren’t blind, they’re not gonna ignore you just because you’re crouched. The daily Ops are AWESOME.
---
AND I WISH TO LIVE THOSE TWO SECONDS
---
But i totally remember being killed by a lvl 1 radroaches in the starting vault during fo4 survival gameplay, not like im complaining about it 😸
---
Even though I knew the location well and thought we did it well, couldn’t do it with 2 people, just took to long at the checkpoints. 3 was cake though
---
100% agree. I'm now level 397. I was level 390 when this patch dropped. I've leveled up 7 times in about 2, maybe 3, hours of game play. And I didn't grind xp. Normally I was leveling up 2 or 3 times a week. I am absolutely loving this update.
---
That is true, it doesn't make up for the loss of damage however, now I'm a total noob as in I've been playing tens of hours rather than hundreds and I've noticed what used to take two rounds now requires a magazine or more, even on level enemies pre-patch weren't *that* bullet spongey
---
I understand why you want one. Catmeat Steak is delicious.
---
I think the ammo situation is kinda lame. Some builds have an easier time with ammo, others not so much.
---
Damn I swear those Bethesda sycophants be stalking everything I post. If you think this is a good system just block me.
---
The most important:
---
If you see someone activating the radio signals, don't do anything that can interrupt the process.
---
Don't run too close to the player, grab hold of it or something like that.
---
Activation takes a few seconds and reactivating the signal is an unnecessary loss of time.
---
When uplinking the signals, it is more important to stay close to the signal than to deal with opponents (tagging is ok).
---
After both signals have been activated, it is important not to wait for the opponents marked with a diamond to approach you, rather it saves time to actively search for them. And only those who are marked with a diamond have to be done.
---
A little tip: take a weapon for the final boss that is difficult to get ammunition for.
---
In Vault 94, except for the final boss, I was traveling with a plasma flamer and then switched to a prime Gatling plasma for the final boss.
---
At the start of the day, after an ACP event, I had 15 cores, at the end of the day, after another ACP and 2 SBQs, I had 29 cores - just because of the daily ops
---
Truly heaven.
---
You was talking about NEW stealth oriented daily ops, isn't you? So am i. I was not talking about current daily ops
---
300 for legendary perk, they skipped 250
---
You was talking about NEW stealth oriented daily ops, isn't you, that you will need to change your build later? So am i. I was not talking about current daily ops. Edit: yes, you said NEW op, why talk about current op
---
It is really hard to keep up with ammo at that level.   You might want to get a level 30 melee weapon as soon as possible, something like a modded baseball bat, to help carry you through the times when you run out.
---
I'd switch 2 in Ground Pounder back into Concentrated Fire, as the damage increase is still really nice even if you can't get cheesy VATS accuracy anymore. Also Tank Killer should be level 3 always, as Anti Armor is multiplicative still. You will need Bloody Mess 3 for it's overall damage boost, and chems don't hurt either. (Psychotats are great for this, but Psycho will do too.) If VATS I'd recommend Gun Fu as well, and Blight Soup for crit damage % if you use VATS crits.  
---
Other then that, proper weapon modifications can also make a difference. Anti Atmor Magazines will help for the main rifles in the game (Combat, Fixer, Handmade) I recommend Perforating for max damage, and Stinging if you want the 5 extra bullets.
---
Let me know how it goes. :)
---
Ya I’m thinking about trying to find mutant slayers and troubleshooters heavy guns just for daily ops, those dudes are super tanky now
---
Can the glaive drop as legendary?
---
I miss Red Eyes Raider Radio. Some great fucken songs there
---
I’ll have to post my weapons later I think they might be fine but I’m not sure with the last few updates
---
Agreed that what you end up having to do.
---
But its premise of running like hell only to die and get respawn back at the other side of the nuke zone when you just died and got barley any damage on the SQB and all your left with is wasted radaway only to be killed by rads or other monster and be stuck inside the nuke circle.
---
It would just be helpful if you respawned back at the location closest you died from
---
There is literally 30-50 damage difference in my aa and b dcg... Going aa or vamp is so much better now. You still wanna have uny bonuses though.
---
Yeah, I came up with about the same math.   At level 318 and need to hit somewhere between 600 and 700 to max them all out....that's really hard to imagine doing.
---
Its not like that I dont like the thought that my presence in a battle makes it easier for everyone. I sport suppressor, tenderizer and follow through but the delay is simply too long to make it up for the coin cost.
---
Yeah I stopped listening after a point but it was great while it stayed fresh, like a fine milk
---
At least the name 'the gutter' fits...
---
Whistle in the dark sucks too.
---
I agree with everyone else here. 
---
Remember that your goal in this isn't to rack up kills, just fight enemies that get too close. Stay by the uplink untill it's completed. The more teammates that stand there, the faster it completes. Run past enemies when moving to next location, don't get bogged down fighting. Save the fighting for the finale. You'll be fine!
---
Yeah but wouldnt that take away from the magic that seeing insult bot holds?
---
I can only have my heart broken so much, but I wish you luck.
---
Dont bother if you focused on rewards*  its perfectly fine to run them solo for exp, while giving less exp per one, they swarm you in numbers
---
It's the grind and crap RNG.
---
I'm pretty easy to please, I just have one small request
---
IF I CAN'T PLACE IT
---
***DONT MAKE IT GREEN***
---
that is all.
---
Fluffy &gt; insult bot, i want him for my camp
---
Still having issues, game crashed for my second try on Xbox one x.
---
Am I the only one happy the game isn’t just a stroll anymore?
---
If the Blood Eagles are going to recruit a Mirelurk Queen into their gang, they should give it a giant leather jacket to wear.  
---
And maybe a pompadour wig.
---
Instead of heading directly to the op, I travel to my teammates. Sometimes they just finished an op and are busy repairing their armor and crafting ammo. Sometimes they appear to be away. I don't mind waiting a few minutes, I just don't want to sit around waiting for people who are never going to show up.
---
I'm enjoying the new wasteland. Lol. I am guessing the people that are complaining are those that have one million qol perks.
---
With magic weapon at lvl 35 i still need 2 shots on 50% of mobs and more than that on another half, bosses excluded. Otherwise it is a struggle.
---
What’s the dropping bombs event?
---
I honest to god thought this was legit but then I realised you were being sarcastic and mocking most people who complain on this subreddit, thanks for the vent my dude, this was worth the read. 👍
---
yea whatsup with sneak not working
---
Dont worry dude, Ive done everyone of them so far with Elder and havent gotten a single rare item
---
If you are running heavy gunner you want to have:
---
Blocker
---
All 3 damage cards
---
Bloody mess
---
Class freak
---
Starched genes
---
Adrenaline
---
Stabilised
---
I would auto-purchase a cash-register stash box or a clean rug.
---
Does it reward this everytime or once per day? Otherwise ill just swap to my gat plas at the end of every op i do
---
Me three 😭
---
The WHAT perk??? Sir, you are a lifesaver.
---
Hmm, But what kind of player are you I wonder? It seems like the people most happy about this change are the ones playing the game more like a looter shooter. Just hunting the next big legendary to get better legendary loot to kill the next legendary even faster. Also they're of course optimizing their character for combat only.
---
The ones that are hating this update are the ones playing casually not really focusing on trying to kill the next big legendary enemy. But merely "living" in the world playing the game the way they want with their builds not very focused on combat. But more on building, crafting, exploration, gathering side of things.
---
Look I'm not saying we can't have both worlds here. But with the games current state. Only the looter shooter combat focused players are seemingly having fun.
---
What the looter shooter players have to understand is that there are players that dont WANT to be running around with the best power armor in the game and only using super legendary loot they get from enemies.
---
Perhaps we want to use only the armor and weapons WE craft? Sure that meant that we couldn't face certain encounters in the game without help from more combat focused players. But for everything else it was more than feasable. Right now though it's nowhere near feasble.
---
The problem is like what they said in the matrix.. choice. Right now bethesda has seemingly eliminated that. Other than choosing to play the game or not playing the game that is.
---
sneak seemed fine last night. at ACP.
---
we dropped and let the 3 sneak builds hit 1st. Earle was down to half health by the time heavies opened up on him. mutated and then took 10 minutes to finish him off. was a good run.
---
props to the sneak builds and the random PA heavy players there having the sense to let them get major damage in 1st.
---
He’s really looking for a legacy for that. Besides, this isn’t the trade sub.
---
Truer words have never been spoken
---
100% trash
---
I winced when I saw "New Armor" on that list. Especially after the grindfest that was Secret Service RNG rolls. If I never had to do that shit again, it would be too soon.
---
The Secret Service stuff was already a cop-out and a retcon since Enclave WAS the secret service (and much more). What's next? The "Super Secret Service 2: Hidden Boogaloo"?
---
There's very little point to upgrading the perk, ngl. Hacking and lockpicking are dummy easy.
---
Enemies have enhanced perception, no hiding from them. It's quite the pain for those of us used to getting in sneak attacks for big hits.
---
Pepperoni rolls = 75 weight, deathclaw steak = 6str, with carnivore. Extra 105 weight 😻
---
I nearly always have a problem starting/turning in my quest to the dickhead at Foundation. I have to lower my gun, open my pip boy, talk to someone else or some other nonsense to get him to acknowledge me properly
---
That’s a fucking nightmare image I can’t get out of my head. Thanks😂
---
I'm not so sure! Not much has been revealed yet but it can be assumed from the october date and relevant name that it's related to the day the bombs dropped in the Great War
---
A lot of people said that they have anything for the Mothman Festival in the current roadmap either, but here we are and there they are in the atomic shop.
---
Ammo is now the easiest resource to get in the game, that excuse makes me believe you're just too lazy to go get lead and steel, make some gunpowder, put on ammosmith and eventually ammo factory, and never have ammo problems again. It shits ammo put at you. So do the daily ops. Ammo is everywhere, right in front of your face.
---
It's a bit ridiculous really how effective this is. Haha. Combined with my mutant slayer ffe mini gun haha. Rips right through these muties while taking virtually no damage.
---
Oh. Well, that works too.
---
it rewards you everytime you kill the boss with a gat plasma with 2-4 cores
---
started yesterday with 15 cores, did a couple of runs, did 1 ACP and 2 SBQs (where i use the gat plasma mainly) and ended the day with 29 cores in my pocket
---
I wish they would add more songs as well and new lines for Julie I want Let's Go a Sunnin back
---
Ok, I've had some time to look at your build and compare it to mine. The biggest differences I can see is that I've got 3 in Tenderizer, Concentrated Fire, and Gun Fu compared to what you have.   
---
Here is what I would change:  
---
Remove Ground Pounder, get Concentrated Fire 3 back. The damage it offers is still nice in my opinion.  
---
Find a way to get Rank 3 Tenderizer, at least. It's multiplicative still, and adds a lot of damage.   
---
Gun Fu 3 is Debatable.   
---
Fill in any gaps you have with legendary stat perks, say if your weapon breaks constantly, then start leveling Legendary INT so you can run with Gunsmith 5. and Nerd Rage at the same time.  
---
Since you are using a Handmade, switch to Perforating or Stinging Magazines if you have any of the others. Armor Penetration is multiplicative, and adds good damage.
---
Couldn’t agree more dude. Don’t get me wrong I like being able to silently and methodically sniper one hit most enemies but I fully expect other enemies like sheepsquatch, death claws, mothmen, flatwoods monsters, scorched beast, and other creatures like the queen and the colossus to put up a hell of a fight. I don’t want to one hit k.o. Those things because it would take all risk away from the game. Which means there wouldn’t be a point in playing. You gotta have conflict.
---
Nothing is forgettable when you have heard it a million times, but I agree that his was one of the worst. He is above Travis and Rose though
---
I used it to autohack a terminal in the Nuka Factory, and it completed the challenge, so I feel like one of us experienced a bug.
---
Yeah a big problem with this type of mindset is the "BiS" trap (best in slot), eventually the internet figures out what the optimal build, perk and gear loadout is and then everyone just copy/pastes it.  And if you try to build a unique character you get lol'd out of groups.
---
As we can kind of see in this thread, people already telling me that "well your build probably sucks".  They're probably right, but I prefer my quirky RP style of gameplay over the min/maxing drudgery.
---
F76 used to be unpredictable and dangerous for my character, now it's predictable and dangerous.  And boring.  Very, very boring.
---
I’m not min-maxed, im a competent stealth commando, but jack of all trades with enough health and armor to get by (I am in fully upgraded ss armor) but my build is pretty vanilla
---
Yep just getting ready to make this same post. Hope this is an oversight.(Ive seen worse from Bethesda since release) MN is literally the only thing besides the scorched christmas event I even plan to plug in the external and log in for at this point in the year ehh.
---
I don’t think it would have been so bad were I a more social player, they really seem to be forcing team play on us. I do believe that they are making tweaks to it, the first day I almost felt as if stealth was broken, tonight it didn’t seem all that bad. I am going to give it a week or two before I make drastic changes to my build, and work my way through all my usual events to make sure I can still solo them. And go see if I can still take out some of the tougher enemies. Worse case scenario is I’ve got lots of lvls saved up to swap stats or learn perks and I’ve got some mismatched gear sitting around to put together some sorta halfassed junkies or bloodied build. But I’ll have to track down mutations or stand by a rad emitter.
---
Considering they can’t even put out content they promised months ago on time I highly doubt they have the technical knowledge to increase the sever capacity in a way that would support additional players
---
Idk it depends but I’ve seen more activity on it though now that the Queen can finally be crippled. I’m on Xbox and I would just grind the queen event by looking for group posts saying,  “queen on me join off profile.”
---
Full of shit mate, my food builds have zero problems killing mobs, just to much crybabies around. Stop blaming food builds (i have all weight perks except shotguns and armor, im a hoarder)
---
If anyone wants to sell one on Xbox, hit me up. I’ve done earl over 20 times and still no helmet, I’ve gotten the plans 3-4 times each
---
It auto unlocks things at people's camps so you'll get instantly wanted if you aren't careful.
---
yeah got griefed a few times. was so cinfused. thanks for the heads up. will do,
---
I started a daily ops group  today. We ran it, got the Elder rank and we were done.  We were going about  our normal business. Some random guy joined our team and then I saw he was waiting to start the daily op.   We joined it and ran it with him because I realized he had join the group thinking that we were running it. We helped him get it done and then changed group to casual.
---
Tbh i dont care))
---
It's akin to "What in the name of God are you talking about?"
---
It's in response to your weird claim that you're not allowed an opinion on this sub, something my apparently upsetting post history contradicts. Not that your comment really makes any sense, since most of my posts from the last six months have either been on /r/gunpla praising people's builds, /r/kitbash praising people's builds, /r/casualuk making small talk about boring British things or /r/fo76 talking about this game. It's nice that you resorted to deflection and trivializing mental illness over reddit posts instead of actually replying to what I said lol.
---
MN is trick or treating. Thats literally what you do during the event.
---
They work fine for me. I travel to Foundation and my daily pops up and same with Crater. 🤔
---
Enemies will follow you anyway, if you have their attention, what are you talking about? You can lead enemies around the map right NOW
---
that's a decent consideration for anyone who's still &lt;100 and wont have the perk cards lying around to max level a LP yet, true.
---
As long as you actually have a team, elder is easy to get. Directing this at people soloing it and upset or confused at why they can't get elder, you shouldn't be soloing ops, they are team oriented events. Once you have elder time then time no longer matters. Solo it all you want and farm that ammo and xp and legendaries. Go nuts
---
That's good to know. Didn't think we'd be getting cores. Thanks for the tip!
---
It's ok. Foodbuild lives matter.
---
People gonna try getting BE level 1 rifles now
---
Also, when you open a pack, 2 of the 4 cards go off screen. I have to write them down so I know which ones are new / scrapable. Fucking annoying if you have like 11 packs to open.
---
Every time the objective is up link it will be active. They have stated they are working on other goals, and ones that will be better for stealth players
---
Whitesprings manager office is an easy level 0 lockpick and hack
---
Nothing to do with 2020 (again this appeal to the fallacy of constant progress). Are you suggesting that games have gotten and should become easier? Because that's what's happening. Click to kill, come back tomorrow and do it again. Games on the whole are pandering to an increasingly entitled player base where the only challenge is repetition and not difficulty. Your post is testament to this slide into mediocrity.
---
2 drops daily since update
---
SBQ and ACP do not seem any more difficult. Silo run needed a slight adjustment, as in gutsy's are a little tougher. but overall same old same old.
---
Wish there was a perk to speed up launch prep.
---
Yeah I haven't had to repair my PA in like.... ever. And I tank through nuke bunkers without killing anything bc. its faster, I also tank through basically everything.
---
Now with daily ops? I had 2-3 pieces going red each day.
---
Also: My always-broken-magic-mini finally lets me use some of my 60+ advanced repair kits
---
The same can be said about the War Glaive. Awesome visuals but can't be traded nor crafted Legendary.
---
Unfinished stuff everywhere.
---
Both the Gutter and the Glaive should be able to get 3 stars like all the other gold bullion weapons, with the gutter getting its stars on top of the one it already has, like the Fixer.
---
No, because bloodied use rads to limit their health. The red bar.
---
Im a food build and have zero problems after update, dont compare braindead lazy crybabies to casuals
---
Same here just straight up instant death every time at first I thought it was because I was doing encrypid but since then I went afk and freaking radroachs have caused and I even wasted some perk coins on the PA reboot legendary perk no point to it if there's no more downed state
---
You could make a backpack with adjustable length straps and be able to wear it with power armor like a normal backpack lol
---
Yeah, not upgrading it, but at base line I am just happy not to have to switch cards every single time, if only we could get perk load outs already!
---
The autounlock completed my challenge too
---
If you use the scrap box I definitely recommend using the private server, it's a great way to do multiple junk runs in one go without finding out one or more locations have been cleared already
---
^^^This^^^ Of course the developers for Fo76 are like 3 guys 1 girl a cat that cant find its way out of a plastic bag two empty mt dew cans and a stale cheeto.
---
That should be no big of a deal for the devs. I haven't looked into 76 but in the other FO games it is just yes/no under the point "essential" of that NPC.
---
Greetings member... subscribe to my onlyfans for... exclusive content.
---
Sounds like OP just had a glitch and it didn't work. What a surprise.
---
I came back to this game yesterday to try out the new update. I am level 8 and just died 3 times in 10 minutes while trying to set up my CAMP. I have no ammo, no stimpacks. no fun.
---
I'll go back to Crusader Kings 3. This was a very shortlived adventure.
---
I use around 30 50cal shots to kill an enemy, but get back 6 to 12 bullets. Also, im busy killing thins so i dont have time to loot stuff. Certainly im not gaining any ammo at all
---
Yeah man I war Glaive (fire mod) would look bad ass with my responder fireman outfit and makeshift rhonie helm. But I'll keep using my sheep staff since it's not legendary, and doubt I'll get the plan anytime soon lol
---
Try to use vats, shotgun damage register badly outside of it, vats = every pellet hit. It takes 3-4 body shots on my 29 alt vs ghouls, with basic normal shotgun. Magic shotguns still 1-2 shot things
---
Wdym "now" they dont break faster.
---
Dude I dont know where you live but in America we are all working everyday everywhere Ivdont think excuses like this really cut it when every city is 95% back to buisness as normal.
---
The thread where he helped me is here. Click on the link he gives to Nukes &amp; Dragons &amp; read his comments :)

---
I’ve noticed my BE laser breaking a lot quicker than it did pre nerf.
---
Yep, first thing I'm gonna do with Loadouts is have 4 sets. Crafting/Repairing, All Weight Possible, Nerd Rage no PA, and PA.
---
Out of curiosity, where is your camp? I'm looking for a nice location.
---
The problem with deathclaws is that sometimes they hesitate and throw pebbles at you like an angry gorilla defending his turf. 
---
If you really wanna make deathclaws scary. Have them full tilt extremely high speed sprint at you on sight (no hesitation). Followed by a massive flurry of scratches and bites.
---
That would make for some oh shit moments.
---
It probably also didn't help that I went straight into daily ops after the patch &amp; didn't read the instructions :D
---

This is harsh wasteland, not a Disneyland
---
I don't think she drops as many anymore, I only got two off of her last time I fought her
---
But you admit it is flavor and it is there 365 days a yr now so Bethesda pick a different flavor!
---
Never thought about that, damn that's a hard choice extra exp or that massive carry weight
---
A lovely new feature in Daily ops, although I'm finding it wasn't as good in other areas of the map too
---
This is the correct answer.
---
If you craft 56 .45 and Super Duper procs, it'll still give you the base 12 ammo that you'd get without perks, so Super Duper does NOT stack with those perks.
---
That you're getting "more ammo regardless" doesn't mean anything since it literally does not stack with perks, but just does its own thing, which would have done regardless.
---
Don't worry about that. I (PA Heavy 151) ran the supermutant ops with my gf (bloodied sniper, 83, and a friend (21, pseudo-bloodied-build-i-guess?) and her boyfriend (23, food-convinience-please-don't-starve-lets-eat-corpses-non-combat-build). The only one actually going down was my bloodied gf bc... 20% health and forgot her anti-super-mutant-gear.
---
You can't expect useful information from local radio. That wouldn't be realistic.
---
Everyone is working! This is not a valid excuse unless you work in a few select service jobs give us a break!
---
The new we can see you no matter what in daily ops threw me for a loop. But it is less effective generally than it was across the board
---
I'm spamming the ??? and the "come here" emote so often..
---
Just north of Lost Home in the lower right corner of the map.
---
Can confirm that it can be placed in team mates camps. Bud put one and the new "Kens chem den. The doc is in" sign in my camp last night for me.
---
I used mine at momma docles and it counted for the challenge for me.
---
That's unacceptable, they have had a year to fix it, which is a lot easier than shelving an old event and throwing something half assed together at the last minute.
---
Clearly everyone still enjoyed it as referenced here
---
I never scrapped, just on my fourth character. Each time it’s just a bit hard to get past the draggy slow parts of the main quests, or knowing that my new character doesn’t have any limited time event plans like the fasnacht donut. Also running out of common materials like rubber or asbestos.
---
Why not bigger mag? 20 rounds is kinda nuts like I get it they expected a ton of pvp but thats not the case. Keep pvp changes seperated.
---
It was sarcastic.
---
One thing for sure I doubt it will be any less buggy than MN. If they dont cancel it either.
---
I can vouch for other casual players loving the update, it’s cool that is a little more challenging, but I don’t find it frustrating, nowhere near say bloodborne  or mhw where I expect a challenge and to die many many times learning the boss movements and patterns, f76 it’s still my casual, build your camp, take a stroll, kinda game, even after the update 🤷🏻‍♀️ (and no, my “build” is not optimized or meta at all, I’ve done that with mhw and I am not getting near that rabbit hole again)
---
You don't PVP so you aren't qualified to comment on this. This isn't an aspect of PVP unless you consider a hitlist in a private community a fair PVP tactic.
---
Thats why its easier for them to tinker weapon damage with new formula, they can just double the damage of slow rifles, without counting all old multiplicative formulas, just need.
---
 Btw, was testing on my bloodied food build, AA pipe rifle (one of the worse snipers) + tank killer+ nerd rage rank 1, bloody mess rank 2 and rifle perks 30% dmg (each first rank) on top of 19% health. Was doing 600 dmg per headshot, resulting in killing scorched and ghouls in 1 shot, supermutants in 2
---
It would be nice if with the gutter it guaranteed it to be vamp but let us roll the last 2 stars. Weapons with a smaller pool to roll from to get what we want.
---
I hate RNG loot pools for gear I'd rather grind with a goal.
---
/r/entitledgamers
---
Are you guys on PS4? If so, I have a ridiculous amount of stuff, I'd be happy to give you some weapons/armour/ammo/junk to make life easier for the pair of you :)
---
The problem isn't that the game is hard.
---
The problem is that character progression has been replaced with character regression.
---
That moment when you first step out of the vault? Revel in it. With one wasteland, that's the most powerful you're ever going to be.
---
The super reactor plan is a rare reward from the new daily ops
---
Yeah for real lol 80 percent of my deaths are from fat charred boys honestly. Especially the level 60 spawns that used to be at the golf course.
---
Same offer to you as the one above - I have more stuff than I know what to do with, if you're on PS4 I can chuck you some stuff to make life a bit easier for you and/or your wife :)
---
Just came back to the game, hit level 29 just a second ago. Things are way way way harder than just a few days ago. Everything feels like it has entirely way too much health now.
---
As a fast traveling speed demon, that perk is a breath of fresh air. Pop one every 30 mins on it's cool down and you're good to go.
---
Thank you!  👍
---
No they’re just cutting down on the pure cheese that was bloodied builds
---
Care to share your build?
---
That would kinda be pay to win
---
Seems dodgy
---
Not being able to work in the same building means the people can't talk to one another in the office, crossover to a colleague's desk. It is cumbersome and what I've stated is a factual observation
---
https://www.techrepublic.com/article/long-term-remote-work-is-leading-to-a-global-drop-in-productivity/
---
Lucky Break can also be really helpful at keeping your armor in good health if you're running a high luck build
---
I can solo the ops but if people your level join me I have 0 issue with that, just stay near the unlink and stay alive as best you can is all I ask and I'll handle the rest and we both get elder and live happily ever after
---
I mean I keep hearing people say that, but it only takes me 3 shots with my instigating gatling
---
Not what I would call "lotta bullets" haha
---
&gt;complaints from players with superweapons and optimized builds who found everything to be too easy.
---
Players using optimized meta builds aren't allowed to complain about the game being "too easy".
---
They did that to themselves.
---
Some bullshit that isnt MN!!!
---
Yeah I guessed thats the only option. Thanks anyway
---
Yes, ohh the dream, I can taste it
---
My BE laser with a splitter is breaking faster, even with 5 gunsmith.
---
I did the super mutant ops today with my rifleman build with a 2shot lever action (one star legendary as my primary weapon!!) and was dropping most things in 1-3 shots
---
I came out with 20% more ammo than i went in with. Next i did the event solo, not to get rewards just to farm ultracite 2mm and stims
---
Just found out they aren’t doing the Whitespring event because it has too many bugs they haven’t fixed since last year.
---
I've a stealth build, the only way I managed yesterday to finish the daily ops was putting the PA I never use and forgetting about going sneaky...  
---
I think one of the points of Fallout games (as with any other RPG) was being able to solve the situation in different ways... I know Fo76 is 90% MMO 10% RPG, but still it feels too limited from my POV
---
I know but still mr commando could had held down fire and sprayed him down in less than half the time it took for you to kill him
---
I use a Explosive pipe revolver. Man, even with gunsmith 5 this thing is breaking in like not even 100 shots
---
Care to share your build please? I might help
---
Does this work with the heavys for magic dmg the same way?
---
Search for "meta"
---
Ops load you with tonnes of chems so maybe sell them and swap pharmacy for Blocker.
---
Can I go a step further and say if you're not gonna give power armor pieces legendary effects, the ones you before getting in transfer?
---
&gt; Our goal with various randomizations is to make different players feel like the ‘hero’ for the day.  
---
Sneaky-sniper here. That explains a lot and leaves me less frustrated after spending 30 minutes yesterday in Daily Ops. Thanks
---
Me and my 3 idle mules logging onto a private server on the same team would love this xd
---
well its also not that long until halloween, but still i would prefer hancocks outfit over the pirate outfit, but it will have to do XD until we might get it, alrady got the silver shroud and Pipes outfit so i still have hopes XD
---
 I have no food/drink perks. Speed demon and fast travel a lot, 1 every 30 mins  is all you need.
---
I’ve just tested it and it is. Guess it’s easier to downvote than just test it yourself.
---
They said that was intended though, so not a bug.
---
Does ammo factory work on grenades?
---
Here's what I've been doing with great results. When I want to do a Daily Ops run I'll get things ready and create a "Daily Ops" group, within a minute it gets filled with people. 
---
I wait for about a minute for teammates to get ready and will start an instance or join one started by a teammate, at which point everyone follows shortly. We complete however many runs teammates are willing to do.
---
When everyone is done I make sure to change the group type to Casual or anything else so not to confuse anyone else on the server.
---
i marked it as a bug because it SHOULD be a bug
---
Dear Old Friends: Remember Navarro
---
Low levels should not be in there and should have to wait comes from experience with low levels in there sorry not sorry

I have been downed a few times, but I’ve had the option to call for help or let myself die and respawn.

It does sound like opposite to sarcastic tho
---
Between Safe n clean disposal and the new Appalachian central trainyard
---
I use a faster swing speed puncturing power fist, and I also have a vampire's knuckles that weighs nothing (0.04 lbs) just for emergencies. For ranged combat I use an anti armor gatling gun, its ammo consumption is low while remaining effective. After doing a few daily ops, I am literally swimming in ammo.
---
My choice of legendary perks: What Rads (I could scrap my decontamination shower and forget about radaways), Hack and Slash (very fun perk, when it triggers in a cluster of enemies, they learn to fly), Take One for the Team (bigger damage is always welcome), Legendary Luck (so many good perks in Luck).
---
Hope I could help.
---
Not forcing, but giving advice. I wasn't aware if he just didn't know how to build a character or just built what he wanted. Nobody said to stop playing either so you're really getting offensive over nothing lol. 
---
I don't think my post came off as cocky or anything because that's not how I typed it. Some folks generally do want an optimal build (not just bloodied) but don't know where to go so that's what I assumed. 
---
And I'm level 204.
---
The only daily ops that are hard are any with the robots but this can be negated with a full troubleshooters armour set.  The key to all daily ops is a decent vampires weapon. I've solo'd all of them under 8 minutes, I just stand right next to the beacon blasting everything with my vamp shotty.  They don't have to die, I just have to stay alive until the timer counts down.  Works every time.
---
Omg I almost bought that bundle EXCLUSIVELY for the door!!! I'm glad I didn't bother now!
---
Nice work.
---
You dont need to choose tho, little bit more squirrel hunting and you can make 25% exp food , tasty squirrel stew, also scorchbeast brain for 6int (they worth hunting for exp anyway). Radstag or brahmin steak gives 40 weight and molerat gives 3str, lazy people alternative
---
It's funny how people will post as though their experience speaks for everyone
---
Thanks! Figured it would at least help people save some gold, 200 per blade!
---
If you pay me 1000 caps a day I'll pretend to be a 12 year old kid in a call of duty lobby for you.
---
Here is a free teaser. 
---
'YOU ARE A GAY NOOB LOL'
---
I can also do mothers.
---
But you can craft level specific non-legendaries and kit them out with Powerful receivers and the like.
---
I cant wait to hit 50 to play so people don't get mad at me. Am 45
---
Wouldn't escape art be useless because it has to do with sneaking?
---
It's a bit too harsh for anyone who doesn't have an optimized build. Bethesda has already recognized this. The early stages should be adjusted slightly, or lower end prefixes brought up (the latter is supposed to happen anyways).
---
They’ve said nothing about na upgrade for 76 at all unfortunately.
---
Well, if you are willing to pay for 4 accounts I guess there is this^^
---
My friend runs bloodied but is a casual player so she often dies, it's sometimes a pain but she's cool so we make it work
---
There, changed the flair for people like you.
---
Not gonna lie, they got us in a first part 😸
---
Sounds like the secret service is selling it, so you can get it.
---
Tip, after you put ammo in for points or buy ammo back out to the main menu every time. For some reason it will make you go back through every screen a second time to exit. Which is hugely annoying if you just exchanged a bunch. Backing out to the main menu after each purchase stops this.
---
So sad to see this. The only builds are combat builds. The only thing people do is killing things. No hoarding due to stash limits, no exploring, due to "lack" of content. 
---
If a game requires "Pick your weapon damage perk to be effective", just ditch the damage perks and buff the weapons... Its just limiting our build choices and is a shitty move by giving false ilusion of choice.
---
A game should have damage perks to make combat easier, not to make combat viable
---
And yeah, im exagerating. But everything revolves about combat and legendary combat effects and combat perks. There is 0 variety. Is combat or combat
---
The only people happy with this game as it is are combat people only. The people that just want to kill stuff and make stuff harder to kill.
---
Is a vicious circle for these people. Everything has to be a challenge. But you dont have a challenge because you solely focus on combat, so they make combat more "heavy" (it just isnt harder. Is just resource/perk investment heavy) so now everyone that isnt focused solely on combat IS FORCED to be a combat build... Hope the next year they do another overhaul focused on exploring and looting.. if someone wants to focus solely on killing things, there are A FEW WHOLE GENRES of games solely focused on that
---
/End of Rant
---
That being said, this is a nice start to check requirements to be somewhat effective on this game
---
I'm on xbox I'll trade you a helmet for any of the plans I don't have
---
My gt is CELLUL0SE (it's a zero) I'm on now
---
I’m not 100% but I think there is a diminishing return when you have too much damage resistance. I could be wrong but hopefully somebody that knows will comment.
---
I definitely didn't insult your build. Some people generally don't know how to build a character, but want a optimized build. 
---
I understand your problems for your "quirky RP build" from this update because I can imagine it's much tougher for you. That kinda information probably would've saved up both time lol.
---
No. Vasleek said they're not doing Mischief night this year.....
---
I never had one bug the entire time or anyone I played with the whole event. That's just bullshit they are saying. If we don't get MN then I know a lot of people that will cause their own durring what ever trash they try to replace it with.
---
Its not happening this year...:(
---
Yup anything over 400 is bad for you lol
---
They die easy, when you can hit them. When you are just running somewhere and they keep appearing and burrow when you try to shoot they get very annoying
---
Only if it’s a button you press and it flips off the enemy you’re looking at to draw their attention to you.
---
Does that also count for PA? Base T-65 is like 600+ DR
---
I think if we ever get a respecc I'll give my PA and Heavy Weapons to my Gf, so she can go tank dur dur hue hue not worry about anything and I'll go bloodied myself.. I thought her using vats was a good thing to make the game more easy, but seeing how she dies a good amount of time.. yeah..\^\^
---
No, because people will abuse this and afk. "Oohh but u can just kick". Yea and what if the team leader wants to idle?
---
Shared xp will be good if there is a good votekick option as well.
---
You are right, but how else would one make a post? Don't we all post from a personal perspective? I had the same thought as you, that's why I asked if anybody have more info to please share, also why I added "For me anyway."
---
If you hold the back button you can exit the terminal right away.
---
So are daily ops here to stay? Cause my buddy is telling me they only last the season or something.
---
Its not just as easy, as fallout1st private, you need to join same public world, so you need a friend (lol) or to join some person from your previous session (need to remember his name and he can leave while you logging)
---
I will look into that, at first glance though, I become over-encumbered without traveling pharmacy which means I am carrying too many chems, 200+ dilued radaway and diluted stims.  I am sure I don't need that many all the time so thanks for the idea about trading carry weight for defense!
---
What's these? How do you encounter one in a wild?
---
It's not bad for you. Just after like 350 it dosent do much. The difference between the t65 and t51b is like 3 damage vs a lvl 95 behemoth. And that's one of the strongest attacks in game, a smaller attack would have less difference. Then throwing in emergency protocols, lone wanderer, or anything else and the difference is non existint
---
Tiiiiiimes have changed 🎶
---
I'd use world of Warcraft as an example. Endless quests and areas to explore. Dungeons and boss fights to do with groups. Feel like the world in 76 gets quite small once you are nearing the end of the story and there's a huge shortage of interesting quests. Story felt more shallow than in past games.
---
Just so, but making sense went bye bye when they decided to let you wear clothing pieces over your armor. The real reason is because clothes over armor is purely cosmetic, while power armor already had tremendous benefits and they don't want to let you stack those with all your normal armor effects.
---
Cures diseases
---
I'll craft a vamps minigun and see how it works out, thank you for the idea on dealing with our robot non-friends.
---
Can't go wrong with power armour reactive plating and blocker, earl and the wendigos hardly touch me
---
Okay thats great thanks buddy
---
These are all excellent ideas.
---
I use PA and Pain Train perk for this purpose, just pop a few Nuka Colas to keep AP high enough and you can plow through the enemies and leave them staggered for the rest of party to run past them.
---
Just like real life!
---
I got it haven’t put it down yet thing is pretty damn big compared to the old one
---
I’ll have to look into combat chems. I only lost 31 point off my instigating and 26 off my other rifles but definitely missing all the safety I had with sneak. I might have to drop my int to 5 again and bump agi back up with adrenaline.
---
I love the private server. Nobody comes in my world unless I invite them. I can move items between characters. Very much worth it to me.
---
I’m level 44 and been playing a couple months for fun and casual after playing fallout 4 a while back. Honestly if you’re struggling, use a melee weapon!! It helps so much, it takes two swipes to kill a mole rat maybe 3/4 for ghouls and robots! I have been wearing power armour (t-60) and yes there’s a slight difference in more damage taken but overall it’s really not that bad. Like this guy says as well, even more xp! Just a different change to the game and tbh if I hadn’t checked on here it would of taken me a while to notice the difference 😂
---
I heard about them making the enemies notice you automatically so stealth is impossible and as a bloodied stealth commando I thought “Ah Christ this isn’t for me then.” Tried it for the first time and beat it solo and got the elder reward. It was insanely fun. If I had to compare it to something I’d say it was pretty much like Borderlands style combat, just insane mayhem and super fun. My bloodied dude didn’t have much trouble even at 20% health, my faster fire rate handmade and fixer definitely helped a lot needing to kill and move fast.
---
I think you are right, I should look at a lvl1 marathoner or something instead, thanks for the observation.
---
Don’t know. I know it’s a waste to have over 400 on regular armor. I’m also curious as to if it affects power armor the same way or not
---
Can this drop in legendary?
---
You don't need to kill the enemies, just tag them with pipe pistol or something.
---
Didn’t mean it as actually bad for you. I meant it was a waste to have over 400
---
Yeah it actually sounds like that is the type of thing they are considering doing, so guess we'll see. Late 40s is definitely harder at the moment
---
I bet there will be a sale on repair kits soon lol
---
I wish there were more radio stations. The Classical Station sucks and there are so many annoying songs on the Appalachia one
---
Today I joined all ready made Ops team and when I started the Ops, no one came. I stood there emoting for 15 minutes, until I decided F\*\*\* this and ran the Ops solo in 8:05 (damn freezers).
---
Haven't had that yet but I have got the solar panel.
---
things like this gets ignored but the post about free fast travel to foundation and crater in which should have been in the game since wastelanders gets upvoted and some reddit rewards lol
---
I can’t do commando. Nothing wrong with it. It’s just not my brand of tea. I’m just so use to sniping that bother styles are foreign to me. At least on my main. It would be a hassle to swap him around to new build.
---
I don't mind making and carrying disease cures. A 15 minute frolic through the Forest region with Green Thumb was relaxing and yields enough Bloodleaf, Snaptail, and Firecap to make 75 or more cures with Chemist and Super Duper equipped.
---
Of course, that frolic won't be quite so relaxing with One Wasteland, so...
---
Yep, two shot explosive handmade here, it breaks like it’s made of glass
---
Was it necessary to post this twice 14 mins apart?
---
Yes. That is how it works. There's entire things called food builds. Also yes teas and vegetarian drinks affect herbivore.
---
Nothing is multiplicative anymore. This has caused some issues like crit damage/sneak damage confusion as well because of how the card reads.
---
Hate how the game plays now. Incredibly unsatisfying. Have fun in your grindshit but One Wasteland was a piss poor implementation and a mistake.
---
oh holy shit, two shot explosive was already bad before... imagine now
---
Well, there are easy fixes for this, like "if you don't shot an enemie once a minute disable exp gain" (games like warframe do this)
---
Other than that: Just reduce the radius where you get exp. So you actually need to keep up with the guy who is doing the killing. And, as we now got daily ops, where you get into the vaccinity of everyone else - I really woudn't mind someone just standing idle INSIDE THE FUCKING BEACON to get exp, I'm doing most of it solo anyways, and anyone standing in the beacon would just speed it up.
---
To sum it up: There are ways around this. Best probably would be: Make it not-that-big-of-a-range-xp-share.
---
 But ammo factory eliminated the struggle
---
New rare plan for CAMP medical themed object. Works like disease cure.
---
They slap now! Went to test the damage on my heavy gunner to see what the changes felt like. Throw nade, up she pops. Open up with a bloodied 50 cal, notice her health is not vanishing in mili seconds and not even getting a chance to top my nerd rage region bar before it's all over.... I burst out laughing. I love this update. It's no longer brain dead auto pilot and is actually engaging in places now.
---
During ops sneak is negated by the piercing gaze mutation of enemies currently (next batch of ops seems to be tailored for stealth though). Outside ops - if you are high level enough you will get now the highest level of enemies depending on location (lvl 100 SM in Westtek for example). The higher the enemy level, the better their chance to detect you. Otherwise it seems to work as it should, at least for me.
---
I'm still in love with Curie.
---
I have gone through so many repair kits in three days, it’s hilarious
---
Its absolutely just as easy. You just open social and it shows every single person who was in your last session, you rejoin from there. I've had someone switch games while I tried to use them to relog, I just picked another name. It's easy as hell.
---
Should have mentioned this in the original post, this was a second attempt in the Valley Galleria against super mutants.
---
👍
---
Maybe I'm wrong I haven't played through all the new stuff. I just remember always being pressed for ak ammo but always having too much for my energy and 5mm guns.
---
There is a perk in agility that makes armour break 50% slower at max perk rank
---
I have a B3325 semi auto Handmade I use for fun and a B2525 Automatic Handmade I use for serious fights. If I’m just adventuring around and doing events I use the semi auto one, saves me ammo and now with one wasteland it takes two headshots to kill most normal mobs, feels pretty cool like John Wick double tapping stuff. 
---
But for serious stuff like daily ops raid bosses or fast paced events that require you to kill lots of enemies very quickly and/or protect stuff, I use the automatic handmade and leave nothing to chance.
---
But when switching between the two I can see that semi auto was not treated kindly in one wasteland... It did like double the damage the automatic one does in one shot but the automatic hits way faster and does way more damage even without the faster fire rate... Semi auto definitely needs a buff.
---
You can do events solo you can scavenge solo you can fight solo you can craft solo . If you want this thing to be easy than yes go and fucking find group they didn't say game will be easy without groups
---
This would be great. I had to stop listening so long ago.  Now I just stream spotify over the game. And if you adjust the volume between the game and the app it feels like you're just listening to the in game radio.
---
YESS PLEASEEE THANK YOU FOR POSTING THIS
---
Would you trade this?
---
he gets significantly more bitches than you
---
It'd be cool if there was a quest you could do for her, to get her more music or something.
---
Never noticed any difference in damage
---
Just did today's first go at 6mins. Easy as.
---
oh sorry It must've posted twice
---
Nice weapons, they sound really fun to run with 👍
---
When they record some new voice, after have to record also in all languages!!  
---
I don't think is easy to update voice messages.   
---
They have to call the italian studio to record new lines with italian voice of julia, etc
---
So far it seems that  the only  justified complaining demographic is the one that want to faceroll everything at level 5
---
Low levels should be adjusted, agree here. But...What's so called optimized build you people keeps refereeing about? Im running a food build with 17 (yes seventeen!) cards related to weight reduction and having zero problems after patch. Jack of all trades build with focusing on max weight. You can swap cards for heavy guns or commando with the same special. Tryhards call it *food* build, while it  takes 2 head shots to supermutant with shitty antiarmor pipe rifle. My point is, stop telling,  that you need max dmg build to effectively kill things, you dont
---
Changed over to commando too from my instigating lever, but not enjoying the new playstyle so switching back and just accepting dam will be crap.   Also ran out of lead for the first time due to how many rounds my fixer uses on mobs.

Forgot to post it

---
To my experience: I didn't see any real difference from let's say 400 to 700. 
---
But over 700 it start to get solid. I'm hulk. 
---
With a good fast vampire melee and enough action going on I can go on fighting forever .
---
Already learnt sorry bro
---
Does anybody know why the power armor revive doesn't work
---
What.....are you even talking about? I've never heard of a fly syringe, what do the flies drop, what is HRF?
---
I'm very grateful for this help and info, I've saved your comment for reference. Will be changing out quite a lot over the coming days.
---
Just had a huge clear out to a mule today and have dropped Traveling Pharmacy and Through Hiker so have gained some free slots.
---
Don't know but I sure hope it does, just got the plan today.
---
I have an automatic laser rifle, goes from 200% durability to broken in 5, 30 round clips...
---
Great thanks. Maybe I can finally stop hoarding and save 6 perks from pharmacy and thru hiker
---
Np.
---
Well, I know about Food Build, but when *I* played, millenia ago, those mutations helped with Hunger and Thirst restoration only. Made the Corn Soup gigaoverpowered, and was practically useless for anything else, so I never got it.
---
Nothing being multiplicative is a drag, tho. Can't have everything, I guess?
---
*slaps backpack* you can fit a a whole lotta typewriters in here.
---
That perk, along with daily ops enemies dropping your weapons ammo, have pretty much made it a non issue
---
I'm a sneak commando also (bloodied build. You can't sneak in daily ops, so you want to swap out all your sneaking perk cards for more damage resistance, damage output and or life saving perk cards. I've completed daily ops 3 times yesterday, one with just me and one other player and the other 2 times with 4 players. I managed to complete it mid-level tier as far as rewards go but I'm getting the hang of it.
---
Now 2 days ago I tried daily ops for the 1st time (blood eagles), it took me 25 minutes to complete (from being killed a handfull of times) because I was solo, didn't replace my sneaking perk cards and have never been inside that vault. After watching every other enemy explode from head shots, it would say daily ops is really fun. Only issue I have is because I've been sneaking for so long I have to get used to not crouching during daily ops.
---
Nope,  didn't spring for it.  Sorry bud
---
He's definitely pulling his finger and giving me nothing but stale air since the patch dropped.
---
It will become the new melee meta if it starts dropping as legendary, the non legendary version already outperforms most legendary melee weapons.
---
We should be able to use backpacks in power armour
---
I think the big issue I'm finding with sneak now is that I'm wasting an extra bullet because VATS doesn't seem to be exiting properly on enemy death (there is definite lag) and because of the fix to Concentrated fire that sometimes means an extra bullet as well.
---
What i could kill with one shot now takes four or five but if I don't use VATS and am close enough it is usually 2 - 3 shots which is what I expect.
---
After some amount of testing with friends, getting spanked deliberately by various things, full health builds benefit way more from Bolstering sets, Bolstering gives you the DR when you need it most, Vanguards when it least benefits you. Bolstering Solar armour is way better than Vanguard SS from a lasting the longest before dying perspective.
---
Hm, can it be displayed and does the display retain the effect like other items do?
---
If your on xbox i have a fixer plan for you, i have them in my vendors for 10k caps
---
And once you know the plan, it gets added to the purvs loot pool, as well end of events.
---
So you wont get fixers from enemies, but if you get a legendary as a reward from a quest/event, it could be a fixer
---
Syringer with the Bloatfly Larval Barrel makes enemies explode out a fly on death with a high probability. Every enemy in nuke zones drops the materials needed for Flux, an endgame crafting material, this includes Syringer spawned Bloatflies.
---
But the secret service is not selling it. I checked multiple times today. I dont know why this is being said.
---
Tbh mine have not suffered that much but i run gunsmith rank 5 and switch on weapons artisan for repairs (repairs to 200% at max rank) and i run mostly TSE lol
---
This seems like a good chance, so I'd appreciate if you answer me honestly.
---
Do you actually play the game after patch 22, or even have the game in the first place? Or you are just a viewer of some fo76 youtubers, and seeing the big nerf thing from their videos, without actually playing the game?
---
I apology for the question, but from my perspective, no one actually play the game after patch will actually agree what you say in the title and below, yet I see several people like you, makes me curious if the 'fo76 video-only player' actually exist.
---
About the Herd Mentality, in my experience, 3rd level Class Freak reduces the penalty to -1.
---
Class freak reduces the penalties to a fraction of a point effectively breaking a lot of abilities scaling of off special points ex evasive
---
Mr New Vegas was boring as fuck.  Sounded like an old woodshop teacher a month before retirement. 
---
But he’s still 1000x easier to listen to than Julie.  Because of her I can’t enjoy the classic Fallout music.  I fucking hate her.  Her repetitive whiny dialogue makes my vault dweller die of cringe. 
---
If I was in a vault with Julie, Hitler, and Bin Laden, and had a gun with 2 bullets, I’d shoot Julie twice. 
---
Travis Miles (pre-Confidence Man) is the best DJ of the modern Fallouts.
---
I hope you understand that if I give you some placeholder numbers \*as an example\* you can't really make a point the way you do...
---
Let say, if I play 1 hours and you play 9 hours, you can't make your point anymore...should I get an 9\* experience buff to be able to catch up with you? In persistent world, people who play a lot or who focus on a single character will always get a progression advantage.
---
Thanks very much for the details.
---
Take one for the team also full rank now, I hated pick locking and terminal so have 2 in Infiltrator. 
---
I've 2 in strength and 1 in Intelligence, still a spare slot to decide on.
---
You might want to change the wording in your post since the game does use hourly cooldowns for certain things.
---
Armor durability would be better
---
*smiles*
---
Ok. I’ll side with the Brotherhood of Steel then!
---
That sounds fun. Wish I could afford sprinting in PA :(
---
My god someone gets it. Team bolstering over vanguard any day.
---
Aside from the points you made, also Bolstering also makes better use of low health buffs like adrenal reaction and stuff like nerd rage if you're into that kind of thing. The closer you get to death, the more resilient and harder you bite back when you need it the most.
---
Well, yes and no - it would be very helpful for those who want to find a team, but not really if you want to try alone or to pair only with your friend (to have even more challenge, check out your build/new weapon in a hard way, etc).
---
The respawn fix alone is simply too good and a very good reason to give 10% more , i hope the majority of people got it fixed on their side too,  it's easy one of the most game breaking bug out here, and in my case it was legit the last bug bothering me, the current stability is impressive.
---
based
---
Leaderboard? With a different game and under difference circumstances, I'd be all for it but this'd just encourage glitchers and hackers to go ham on the event. No legit player would come even close to these people's scores.
---
They actually drop ammo for whatever you have equipped when they die, I switched to a prime lmg (ultracite 308s) and someone else killed a group of super mutants with a grenade before I got a shot off and they still dropped ultracite 308s for me.
---
Basically daily ops are much better than farming materials, just looking grenades with your weapon of choice equipped and you'll get ammo
---
Supposed to cure you of diseases, not contract them
---
Completely off topic, but you’re right! What the fuck happened to horses?!
---
Isnt sneak useless anyway in public events? I usually struggled because every new wave i was instantly in Danger even with full sneak build and Chinese Suit.
---
I have a non-legendary gutter and it does the same thing as the "legendary" version.
---
Id say just stay in the uplink zone, shoot each enemy once. People will be happy you're helping speed things up and you'll also get xp for all the kills. The xp is great so you'll start tearing through levels and fixing your build with the level ups in no time.
---
Good to see you standing your ground. It was too easy. And nobody will deliberately down-tune their build with pvp always being a threat (yes, pvp is ALWAYS a threat. they know how to circumvent any precautions)
---
Only for energy damage
---
And you liking the game doesn't make it good either. I love this game but I can't lie to myself and say it isn't a buggy mess of a game
---
What??
---
I was activating it during the resilient robots one and someone ran in front of me making me get out of my power armor so they could activate it. Not a big deal but I was aggravated as hell anyway lol
---
Agreed, my build is rifle + heavy based, using whatever I've scavanged/made for myself. Not having any real issues.
---
Still using my powerfist for "low levels", takes 2 hits instead of 1. No big deal.
---
With the legendary perks, I've used the SPECIAL cards, allowing me to get some extra damage and defense perks.
---
Some mobs &amp; areas are still too much of a bullet sponge, and some weapons need their base damage increased (hunting rifle being one of them).
---
It only works for energy damage
---
Thanks for the feedback .I'll try that out . I also have some bolstering ss parts
---
Problem is, not everyone wanted exp gain. Nothing really changes after level 70 maybe 100 anyway because the build is already there and only point in leveling is right now made by Legendary Perks. But other than that, it didn't matter. For me it still doesn't matter.
---
I suggest using the legendary card with poison resist and level it to 150. I killed such a queen yesterday without problems (i'm a level 150 one handed melee with chinese stealth suit).
---
Also, if a friend knows the plan, they can build one for you at your camp as long as you’re in a private team together.
---
Nope people are just cry babies they just want the game as easyw possible so they don't have to actually play
---
PA reboot not electric absorption.
---
If I disagree with someone I constantly get downvoted, and sometimes I get thrown even further into the pit, other times it’s the dude who I disagreed with thrown into the negatives.
---
I usually try to carry at least 10k, that's about enough for three back to back lengthy queen fights. I stopped playing this character for a while though, focusing on my alts. Just adventuring around with him since the update I was using the .50 cal a lot more, at least until I got my gauss rifle. I've got plenty of lead but I'm limited on steel, even with scrapper.
---
If this is all that it is for many many months on end, I'm with you 100%. What matters isn't that Bethesda did the changes to damage. That does feel logical and appropriate. What matters is how responsive they are to our feedback, which as of the 3 days it's been out it's pretty clear that:
---
* Melee and semi-autos likely need some buffs
---
* Loot needs a balance pass as it's on the low side in terms of resources expended, especially for low levelled players
---
* Maybe even look into possibly having zones or sets of enemies that are a little easier or a little less threatening (even more so than the forest lvl 50 lock) so it doesn't feel like the intensity is always locked in at 100%
---
Deal with these issues in prompt manner and it'll be fine. Wait until the Brotherhood expansion next year and we are going to have a lot of casuals drop off and just not play this game anymore.
---
on average they go for around 7k on the trade forum. seem them as low as 5 but never more than 10k. I mean if someone wants to pay over 10k then that's fine. But people don't.
---
I 2nd that motion, outside of Daily Ops, sneaking works just fine for me also.
---
Thank you for your response. You would think that at low hp bloodied would be better, but at least my collection of melee is getting some use.
---
Really fun update looking forward to playing more :)
---
not totally up to date

Get a chinese stealth suit - you will be unstoppable :)
---
It does work, had it activate a few times.
---
I'm finding exactly this VATS was broken before but it seems to me to have got worse now
---
On PS4 and I couldn't finish a single daily op on the first try yet, because somewhere along the way I just get disconnected. With the nature of these things, on top of all the changes to damage and enemy levels and whatnots - no fun at all. (And before anyone puts on the broken record: yes it's a wired connection, and I restart my modem every day.)
---
Finally someone with The Gutter.
---
Ah. I was wondering how I was meant to go about entering one without ending up solo. Admittedly, I hadn't bothered lookingg yet cos I'm still trying to salvage my character after the nerf. Sucks that there's no way around it. So basically the damage reduction from Lone Wanderer and the AP refresh to keep Dodgy working on melee builds now heavily reliant on VATS isn't an option unless you're soloing it. Yet rank 1 still uses 2 perk points, and rank 3 is 4 perk points. Add to that the fact that now Empath and Herd Mentality only give you the buff if you are *near* your group members.
---
Almost feels like it needs it's own lobby or staging area. *Not to the extent of NW*, but like ACP as you said. Basically forming a targeted squad for Daily Ops is the equivalent of putting you in ACP solo with nobody joining unless you are all in the same "ACP Group" - rather than what one would generally think of with a 'Public Group' at this point.
---
Or.. and I'm really surprised they didn't do this.. make soloing a benefit of Private Worlds. Just like any other event or area. It fits their MO. You can't solo SBQ or ACP in a public server unless it is practically empty or just by pure chance, and if you want to solo it you need to do so on a Private World. And I'm sure they could use the extra cash with so many people quitting 🤷‍♂️
---
The plans maybe tradable I think. I was able to drop the plan
---
I've 3 daily ops yesterday and I use tse and be weapons, none of mine has broken even once. I also repair mine to 200%.
---
Can you tell me what happens exactly like do you instant rev or do you gotta wait the 30 seconds
---
I have it worked a few times. It keeps you from being downed. If you're ded youre ded. In my experience i dont go to the down state i just instantly go back to full health.
---
I think it depends on what you're saying and how you're saying it. I'm fairly abrasive and I really don't go into negative karma on a post very often, especially here where the userbase is so divided
---
I use an explosive lever action and seems like I need to repair more often.
---
I fix to 200% and use gunsmith and it's always been quick to break.
---
Just added that luck card that repairs guns and haven't noticed it fixing itself, maybe need higher rank.
---
Been thinking of adding the demolition expert perk to gain back most of the damage lost in the update but then it will probably break even quicker
---
Well, killing things grants Experience.
---
Why'd you delete your post trivialising mental illness? Seems kind of a weird move.
---
Ok this is solid info. Idk why but I got downed like 20 times and it never proced
---
It's an insta revive. It can trigger multiple times in a row as well with no cooldown.
---
Aye. I like your suggestion. Also, the first time i equipped a legendary perk i went thru the menu with the keyboard choosing one, but it equipped the perk i was accidentally hovering over with my cursor. Was a bit meh.
---
Its like a 40% chance at max right? I only have rank one.
---
F
---
So close
---
Do you really have to get it in the circle? Scorched earth only requires the circle to be near fissure site prime.
---
What this person said. People would exploit the fuck out of it. 
---
However, also if you're in a team at the same location for an event or encounter, you can already share loot of enemies that one of the other teammates killed, so that suggestion is already in the game.
---
Bro, the wendigos and scorchbeasts are the real threats, I completely understand why everyone who lives in appalachia before wastelanders died, west virginia is horrifying!
---
ammo is basicly junk now and you have more xp per kill... so what you talking about? Bullet sponge is not npc that require few ammo to kill.
---
oof
---
It is i tested it at 30%
---
You've just made me realize how much I would love to add a clean rug to the living room in my C.A.M.P! How hard is it to give them a wash in the nearby river, do they really have to be so ratty??
---
UGHHHH i fucking hate this, my camp is south of the station and some dickhead nukes it every time
---
Good thing levels don't mean shit past 50, and honestly past 75 youshould have your perks fully decked out with only weapons missing. Armor doesn't matter if it dies before you do. If you don't, you fucked around with your perks WAAAY too much while leveling, and that's the player's fault. 
---
There's also the ammunition perk and the LEGENDARY ammunition perk which you'd be stupid not to take. Both of those together, 10 lead equates to 47 .44 rounds for my Gunslinger. 
---
10 lead. 
---
A quick run to Charleston Fire Departmena and then Monorail Elevator nets me average of 200 lead. That's 20\*47=940
---
Now granted, you  might have to server hop a couple times to find the dumbbell spawns cause other people loot it as well, but the end game is literally server hopping to find events you want ot do anyway, and don't fucking kid yoruself, that's what the end game is. 
---
so 10-15 MAX of work and you have an average of 1000 rounds of .44 caliber bullets. Different per caliber of course, but regardless even for Energy...that's al ot of fucking bullets. If you're burning through them that you H A V E to farm the lead dumbbells daily to keep up, you're a shit player who doesn't know how to aim your fucking gun. A bit salty there, excuse me. 
---
Regardless, don't make it sound like farming lead for bullets is hard. Go find a lead vein, put your camp there, go take the Workshop that gives lead or ammunition, you know...that mechanic BETHESDA PUT INTO THE GAME TO HELP PLAYERS LACKING RESOURCES OR BULLETS THAT WILL PRODUCE THOSE RESOURCES FOR YOU FOR FREE WHILE YOU PLAY. 
---
No, the ammo isn't the issue, the issue is that people are used to everything dying so fast ammo was hardly a concern. Now stuff is challenging, now you need to WORK for it. 
---
Time to grab perks that you manually swap out before doing a task, like Ammosmith for crafting ammo, WEapon and Armor crafting perks to repair and craft, food perks for cooking etc. 
---
I"ll give you this, that's a tad tedious, but it's efficient enough for me to realize spending TEN SECOND of my life swapping perks is a fairly nice trade off. 
---
Also, the Daily OPs giveyou more ammo than you use. It literally does. IT LITERALLY DOES. More than likely unless YOU'RE THE GATLING USER, you won't have to fire a shot, the gatling/fixer user will, you just loot everything for FREE ammo and then the end reward is like 100-250 rounds of whatever your using. 
---
Ammo isn't hard to manage.
---
This is what happens when you min max a little to hard.
---
Yeah to bad it wasnt a high percent. Mysterious Savior is just as flakey. He shows up walks around and then I bleed out. Like 2/3s of the time his punk ass shows up is just to watch me die.
---
(I could be wrong here) But GunSmith doesnt work on pipe weapons. You need (I believe it’s called) Make Shift Warrior.
---
Edit: That might be melee. I believe there is one specifically for pipe weapons.
---
What build are you going for mate?
---
Any ammo expect for cores
---
Though if you kill the boss with a core you will get 2-4 from the completion rewards
---
Collects:
---
1. Fertilizer
---
2. clean Sugar Bombs
---
3. Gut shrooms
---
4. Osmos kits, Turret circuit boards, Intrusion modules
---
5. Floater grenades
---
6. Missiles and Mini Nukes 
---
(Feel free to add to this list)
---
In Daily Ops the most valuable thing one can do is staying near the uplink. If you do that, you contribute much more than the ones who run around trying to kill everything that moves.
---
Not really. You can do the same with A Colossal Problem, but they missed it for like 1mm
---
RIP the Nokia 3310's autocorrect. I can see why they're pretty much a dead brand.
---
My friends and I played a for a few hours the day the patch hit. But both them and I haven't played anything since then. We all lost the fun factor even though we've been playing the game quite regulary since a couple of weeks back.
---
Feeling that every weapon I had crafted was useless and everything eating so much bullets that gathering runs feel pointless. We don't usually play events but explore and gather mostly. With a few events here and there + workshop capture which now also is a chore. We use crafted weaponry and normal leather or combat armor and abhore using power armor. And until last update that was still a valid playstyle.
---
Also noticed that my friend that was 30 levels under me did more damage (%) to the target than I did with the same but higher level rifle.... And we're not talking a few % here but like 40% difference that didn't do much to help the issue either.
---
I think it's quite important for immersion that you actually can one or 2 shot SOME types of enemies wether they're your level or not, if you have up to date gear and I'm not talking 5 star legendaries here but gear atleast your level. At the moment crafted gear actually feels completely redundant.
---
We might give it a try again now when its weekend. But I'm not holding my breath.
---
In my opinion they've turned the game from an open sandbox where you choose how you want to play, to something completely different. Before patch it was a fallout 4 game with some MMO elements and multiplayer. Now.. well it feels nothing like fallout 4 anymore.
---
This is much like what happens in MMOs where they boost one playstyle like pvp for example to the detriment of pve or vice versa. Why do boosting one style have to mean sacrificing another?
---
Was the game a bit easy in some aspects? Sure I understand where players are coming from. But that should've meant that they just adjusted the spawns to sometimes spawn harder enemies more often (e.g a deathclaw here and there or maybe some more legendary mobs). But not making every enemy in the game "harder" or bullet sponges. 
---
Also they could perhaps have created more and harder areas/instances for players that are finding the game overall too easy if they'd wanted without touching everything else.
---
Even if it is ultracite .308 and .50? 🤩
---
Got this kids 3 newbiee ages 12-14...I was helping along.God bless their hearts.....blowing up my Inbox if I'm coming back.it filled my heart I will say!!!.
---
 Let's do it! Only thing I don't tell them is how to stack their cards. I explain.... teaching them how to work in a team.place camp in good areas..try finish mission quick move on to the next.forage,how to sell to get max caps in a day,vendor hoping, the basics and other things. and solo. Although I'm mostly solo myself
---
They still have to bust their behind.
---
You do your mission I'll be picking flowers over here. Run into problems let me know. But only as last resort. 
---
I got one that wants to be OP and said I will point you to the right direction, rest you have to go on you tube because I don't play OP. it cool.. it's good to see them  today be more independent...
---
It kinda like having kids in the house again...hehe
---
It’s not about facerolling, it’s about the mathematically proven health increases of enemies as level increases, I.e. the tripling of scorched health from level 14-23. We don’t feel it too hard at high level but wyd with a hunting rifle or whatever melee weapon you have with limited perks? If you’ve even committed to a build at that point.
---
So, first you shoot them six times, then to kill them, you need to enter the Konami code. Suuuper-fun! /s
---
The proportions are completely busted :-D My heavy gunner is using an Instigating Gatling gun (3 shots per enemy, Elder was no problem in the first try), and i'm pulling 20-60(!) shots out of every body. So i leave the Ops with way more ammo than i entered.
---
But when i switch to a .50 cal-Machine Gun, the enemies are dropping 2-6 rounds of .50 cal ammo, which is SO MUCH less than the ammo i'm using.
---
Contextual ammo drops are good, but i guess they should even look what exact weapon the player is using.
---
Yup
---
Screams in angry Jack'o'lantern!!!?
---
i don't want to get killed by a pack of mole rats
---
Thanks for the confirmation.
---
I’ve got a one star instigating you can have for like 4K if you’re PS4?
---
I stopped and watched the shadows dance in the shrubs today, from the sun shining through a whirling windmill. I haven’t noticed graphics like that in FO76 before and had to take it in.
---
Wish we could have DJ Perico or Rabi Ray Rana
---
I am deeply disappointed and my birthday is ruined.
---
I'm trying to decide about this, being explosive and I think ballistic? made it seem attractive. But it has so many bugs I'm not sure I can carry on with it.
---
Shake bug, locks you out of reloading, sprinting, using stims or radaway on my keyboard hot keys. Have to keep bashing to unlock or holster and re equip the weapon.
---
In first person view which has always been my preferred gameplay the fire rate is greatly reduced for unknown reason. Trying to get used to 3rd party.
---
All old bugs that Bethesda refuse to acknowledge or fix.
---
Could just find one of the readily available bugged out mobs that don't move and wont die.
---
As a melee: 150 points of poison resist! I'm now unkillable - it's so awesome :D
---
yes, is saw something like this the other day.
---
As long as the other player activate the signal the loss of time is not as big but if the other one just want to protect you and you cannot complete the activation the loss of time is going to hit you at the end of the event - especially in burrows
---
1650 hours in game and i am still yet to see any of these hacked weapons on xbone
---
For me it's working randomly. It works only if I wait at least a second until I fire the second shot, sometimes it never triggers.
---
I never get the sneak multiplyer msg in VATS too since this patch, but the damage output of the sneak shot is there.
---
This all wouldnt be a problem since its a patch made by bethesda, they had to break some stuff, the problem are all the people who have no idea what they are talking about and telling that everything works fine, so it will take longer until beth understands the bug.
---
The hacked stuff is only on pc
---
The hp curve didnt change with the patch.
---
And at low level (&lt;50) you are far from being optimized, so the nerf is very limited anyway.
---
Before one-wasteland, you could encounter npcs far above your level, and *that* was hard.
---
Except AA
---
I love the music that goes into Fallout, I’ve probably got more songs from that period on my phone than I do from the last 50 years of music. But I’m finding myself switching it off more and more now, and just listening to it through a radio in my camp (side note : WHY ARE THEY NOT SWITCHED ON WHEN YOU SPAWN INTO THE WORLD?!?!)
---
I asked in one of the Q&amp;A’s if anything was planned to be added to the radio, and in a very roundabout way, it was a ‘no’
---
Xbox and haven’t purchased levels. If it helps in any way my score bar reads “score rank 1/1”
---
That’s because it’s a PC problem (I am never been more happy to be a console pleb)
---
Gattling plasmas that shoot a hail of bullets are not hacked. Those are just legacy explosive gattling plasmas with a splitter on them
---
 " I've heard that the nerf wasn't as bad on the update as it was on the PTS "
---
This is what I was thinking after playing the live game after Patch 22 but didn't say anything cause no one else mentioned it.
---
  I played the PTS as soon as Patch 22 was ready and I was really shocked - it was really bad and I was not going to continue if it was like that. I actually cancelled FO1st soon after.
---
But I find this update now ( on the live game ) not too bad. I think a bit of tweaking has been done for release since I played on the PTS.  I'm a high level and had to adjust a few perks etc but it's working for me now.
---
Sure you're not just using it more?
---
It’s not even harder though it’s just long to do anything now, most stuff just isn’t worth doing, the only stuff worth doing are daily ops, sbq and earl. events rewards aren’t worth it 95% of the time and that 5% is only if you get a god roll
---
Definitely janky in when they trigger. Before 22, I had no issue with any of them, I just hopped to any of the locations (Overseer's included), and as I ran towards the actual entrance, they would all pop up without a hitch. Since 22.... it's a hit-or-miss at best, with a lot more misses than hits.
---
I uninstalled on patch night because the update killed my vats stealth rifleman which I spent close to 700 hours perfecting to the best of my abilities. This is also the first time I’m commenting on the issue because I abhor internet arguments, and unfortunately there are individuals on this sub who will attack you for criticizing a game (when all you want is for the experience to be better for all of us wastelanders). To say that I am gutted is an understatement. 
---
Nevertheless - as opposed to those few individuals - I am more than capable of compassion and being able to find joy in the enjoyment of others: if this patch works for you and brings you many more hours of everything you wanted have fun lads! I honestly envy you, and wish you all the best.
---
I enjoyed the radio at first... But its just the same stuff over and over, i really wish there was a real radio station like what euro truck simulator has playing era apt music and modern adverts in a 40s - 50s style or even game specific ones if they dont wana make some £$€ from it.
---
They could at least add another station, im sure i did hear the radio host comment on something i had just done in the story.. cant remember what it was though now.
---
well what you want is the other games radio hosts that comments on your progress. i feel it. idk how easy that would be. im not a programmer but that sounds hard. i would love the same thing. 
---
The games been improving pretty great so lets hope they can get there
---
If I am not mistaken, you can use an Ammo Converter in any camp and many people put one down. So maybe give it a try first before you spend gold for it.
---
As for buying the plan, here is the part from the last patch notes:
---
"Finally, we’ve made several of last Season’s rewards, like Lunchboxes,  the Ammo Converter, available at Gold Bullion vendors so players who missed them have another opportunity to unlock them"
---
bloodied provides higher damage but it doesnt worth it in my opinion.
---
its like he's wearing nothing at all soldier.
---
I play on Ps4 too, My gamer tag is DostoevskysGhost. So I don’t currently have a mic but if you ever want to try the daily ops or anything with me, Just add me ok 👍
---
What's the ammo factory? I'm a newb.
---
Lol, it would fit well with the vault 76 lore. Hyper competitive
---
I hear you. My character is a stealth rifleman. A very good stealth rifleman. And it doesn't matter.
---
Eh. Wish I'd checked out the Ops before scrapping all those Perk Cards.
---
Lootbag has a collision mesh, so if you can jetpack/marsupial yourself to its level you can find  the right spot to stand on.
---
Thank you for confirming. I think a lot of us had to adjust a bit. That is also a problem, we are gravitating to the same builds. Less viable builds, less play stiles, less players.
---
Got it from my first op luckily, completed it under the time for the best results.  It looks really cool but it's huge.
---
Legendary perk, even a base line combined with ammosmith at level 2 is nice, max it out and add super duper and it’s a beast, never will you struggle for ammo again
---
I don’t know about the other two, but I’m pretty positive super duper does.
---
Proper matchmaking for these would be interesting. If the game notices you're decent enough at completing the missions, it could put you with higher caliber players.
---
I can solo the ops pretty easily, it's only the clock itself that I find to be the toughest enemy (hence why I need decent teammates, to capture the nodes quicker and get a better time).
---
For now, I've been server hopping and joining teams with high level players on them. I've had some success doing this, however last night there was a team of 300+ level players and a spare slot. I joined and found the op was already in progress, so I join late only to discover that the clock was already over 8 mins, and the three of them had only just captured the first uplink node.  
---
I nope'd out and server hopped again.
---
Fighting a wendigo colossus is literally the one use case for the drink and requiring you to kill a wendigo colossus just to make one gives it almost no practicality.
---
There is,it's Licensed Plumber.
---
Wait... You guys don't get undressed when you get in your PA?.....
---
Yeah it’s a pain. I had to spend grenades
---
I have never seen a beam splitter on a gat plasma that had legacy effects. That seems terrifying and exciting, does it affect the range of the legacy effect if using the splitter? Since on normal its kind of a shitty flamer?
---
Throw in serendipity and ricochet from luck and dodgy from agility when you’re in Daily Ops too if you’re low health build. Better lose a little damage than dying.
---
As already mentioned, only plasma or fusion cores cannot be dropped by the ememies.
---
But remember: the enemies only give you back between 4 and 16 bullets, which means that in the best case scenario you take a weapon that needs less than 4 rounds per kill to get out with a positive balance
---
Not getting missles or mini nukes either.
---
I'd never use the private server either, and would definitely sub to a cheaper monthly without it.
---
It turns it in to a full auto shotgun of death with unlimited range.
---
It's everything you'd imagine the splitter should be on it and more
---
They do
---
He hosts a radio station in new vegas. The more you know. 🤣
---
Clean rugs would be great. I don’t need them sparkling, but the modellers seem dead set on putting a blood stain somewhere on every new rug. Yes, this is an unforgiving wasteland, but not everyone will have been shot/stabbed/or died on a rug! It almost ruins the Grognak one.
---
i have heard  about and seen some crazy stuff on this game.
---
However...a black powder rifle in Daily Ops.......mind blown!!
---
O I C!
---
i don't quite remember but instigating wasn't hit by the patch, was it? It still does total damage X2, right?
---
Gives me a reason to run other prefixes at the very least...now if only health bars would stop rubber banding.
---
ACTSHUALLY...it hasn't been on the road map anymore for at least the last five months, unless of course I missed something. 
---
And no, it shouldn't swap specials too since that requires perk points to change.
---
Fast travel? What is it? I could do that at the beginning. Since then, all the crap I have to carry around with me has restricted me.
---
Did you collect them in the world or buy them from players?
---
I can confirm
---
I used mine in daily op and it lasted the whole time. Disnt need to fix it either, did another daily op. Still didn't break. And I like fire, so I spray it lol. Weird that I haven't had this issue before
---
doesn't count unless you physically find it in the world
---
I bought them
---
But it could be that he only caused indirect damage (explosion) to some enemies and these enemies then drop random ammunition
---
[My build at the moment.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=d433daa&amp;d=sd2sp2so2sb2p00pc2eh2ck0ce0i12ib4ir2s12a72a80a04a30l12lu1lt2l71x03xe0xl0eu0x60x83la2lg1x70sg0&amp;n=Bloodied%20Gauss%20Shotgun) Havent died yet since the update came ( and im a run and gun build lol ). Serendipity and ricochet is really amazing.
---
That doesn't count, you have to actually find them.
---
what platform are u on?
---
I think you're wrong actually. This is an open world sandbox game with multiplayer elements. Where YOU choose how you get to play your character and live in this virtual world. Well at least it WAS.
---
Some of us now feel that much of that choice has now been taken away. In favor of a playstyle which focuses on combat and combat builds.
---
If we've would've wanted that then we would instead be playing Destiny 2 or Borderlands 3.
---
Not that I don't want that playstyle to be viable in F76 also. It's just that I don't want it to be the ONLY playstyle viable unless you're very much into tedium.
---
I have an anti armor flamer and love it, I've never had this issue. Id go for it if I were you, flamers are so much fun
---
Dang, where’s the best place to look? I need the atoms. I have the tesla but I originally found only 2
---
Thanks for the tip! Have a good weekend.
---
Where’s the best place to look?
---
Maybe not just casuals. I don't think I'm casual. But Have little time to play and would rather spend that time playing the game than grinding ammo.
---
Telling people to play the objective isn’t toxic. Calling  them a fucking idiot and verbally abusing them is.
---
I've played with it for so long that I can't recall if the reload speed works correctly but the food/drink thing isn't that big of a deal with Class Freak ranked up. There's always water at people's CAMPs or whatever and I also use carnivore so I can just eat what I kill if I need food right away. But I normally have a few cans of dog food on hand.
---
This change wasnt to nerd but to make damage calculations more predictable so they can later adjust damage and perks accordingly.
---
I held off for the same reasons, with class freak the hunger/thirst is manageable, a little worse but not terrible, reload is about 30% quicker maybe....glad I got it now, sprint speed is a good boost but not massive, you notice less the longer you have it.
---
Edit: It's not as noticeable as Marsupial, but with both equipped you are very mobile.
---
Imo difficulty isn t putting 50 shots into a creature while it whacks you over and over. That's artificial. What I would rather if seen is something like this: "There's a creature over there that will kill me in 1 or 2 hits. But I know if I can sneak up, or if I can hit it's weak spot, or if I can deal enough damage in one go I can 1 or 2 hit it."
---
I have to fill my food and water bar about once an hour. Its super easy to get food and water in this game so not an annoyance at all.
---
if you want to farm mags (plus plans and bobbleheads) go to lost home 
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i6sj3o/here\_is\_why\_lost\_home\_is\_the\_bomb\_yo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i6sj3o/here_is_why_lost_home_is_the_bomb_yo/)
---
and then FT to forward station delta. On the walkway is a table and a mag/plan/bobblehead can spawn there. And inside the little cabin a mag can spawn on the table. Plus some ballistic fibre on the floor.
---
I like it. Run it on my characters and honestly can't remember what it was like without it. Food and drink are no big deal. 
---
The main thing is if you're going for this mutation do you have others? Just this one you won't need class freak but you will need starched genes to make sure you don't lose it. Then it's kind of like why not run all the other mutations and class freak?
---
That I could not tell you as I've never paid it much attention. The only thing I can suggest is using the perk in perception that makes a noise when one is near.
---
I’m not sure but I’m doing alright with it, Sorry wish I was more informed.
---
I usually use the friendly fire perk to heal them, so a medic could be another solution
---
Just get it man. The food and water is nothing. But you move so slow without speed demon haha
---
I was wondering what happened to it. Thanks for clarifying.
---
Yeah, i'm doing alright with instigating gear as well
---
I hear you but what if it was doable for people that are on your team from your friends list? I usually just play with people from my list. Would be great if i didnt have to be careful not to kill something before every had a chance to tag it.
---
Totally agree
---
https://fo76map.com/
---
I like it and wouldn't go back to play without it. Positive effects are really nice and I have almost forgotten that there is negatives.
---
Cool thanks!
---
I might have a look at trying to get a instigating gauze shotgun, Might be fun
---
Seeing how he’s a computer program, I don’t see how that’s physically possible.
---
I think you're confused. Care to explain?
---
Agreed. These kinds of changes need a scalpel, not a scythe.
---
I would drop bullet shield for blocker, you will get alot more survivability with blocker.
---
A little piece of advice for all those people having to dump ammo like crazy: try to use an anti-armor weapon.
---
I have tested yesterday with two 50 cal machine guns, one Explosive and the other Anti-Armor, and the Anti-armor was hitting for 51 damage per bullet, while the explosive was hitting for 24.
---
It was a dirty fast test against robots so your mileage may vary against other types of enemies, but I think the damage difference is very noticeable in the long run.
---
[deliverer skin](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/1/15/The_Deliverer.png/revision/latest?cb=20170115042741)
---
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
---
Theyre extinct in this timeline
---
I’ve been doing it with a Gatling laser and the daily ops unfortunately don’t give out fusion cores, but they do drop other random energy Ammo.
---
I choked on my breakfast reading your comment well played 😂
---
Yep.
---
Yeah it is ...like the people posting how fun they have and so on with the new update
---
Bethesda you need to read and implement something similar Reddit has spoken. Era and setting specific tho.
---
https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-01-30-the-truck-simulator-radio-stations-making-waves-in-the-real-world
---
I like how he challenges your killer to fisticuffs for the 3 seconds before he disappears 
---
It's so funny I can't bring myself to get rid of it lol
---
i think the game should give you an indication if something is rare. Or at least not common.
---
It's a solution to a problem they created, though, with the daily score level up challenge.
---
Plus it looks like a big candy cane.
---
The slayer prefixes on guns are still pretty much trash, even ignoring things like Bloodied or Junkie's. You'll get more mileage out of an anti-armor weapon in most cases, with the additional bonus that this works for basically all types of mobs and not just one specific type.
---
But OP is right, a set of Troubleshooter's, Mutant Slayer's and to a lesser extent Assassin's armor makes the daily op a whole lot easier.
---
Oh my god yes, that turd.
---
Oh yeah there will be some high lvl pets in camps now
---
nothing at all...
---
So true I have ammo factory rank 4 with Ammo smith and super duper I crafted ultracite fusion cores 5 times and I ended up with 86 of them... 86 ultracite fusion cores for 5 flux hell yes i have so many I can’t even carry all of them. Ammo smith is so powerful but it will drop the cost of all ultracite ammo to 1 cap ( aside for cores ) since you don’t need nearly as much flux.
---
What? When did they say Steel Dawn was delayed?
---
I have gathered all mutations for my playstyle where the negative effects doesnt harm me, like reduce strenght for example (im at one strengt anyway) so my current mutations are: 
---
Bird bones (+agi, - str. Fall speed reduce)
---
Eagle eyes: +per and crit dmg, - str.
---
Egg head: + int, - str and end.
---
Herbivore: vegan only
---
Marsupial: - int, + carry and jump (i like the jump as a sniper)
---
And im wondering if I should add the speed demon as well. I do this so I dont have to spend 3 points into reducing negative effects. Only thing affecting me so far, is the negative endurance and some intelligence drop from marsupial.
---
It's not a glitch. It's a legit loot drop bundle with a 0.15% chance from any Messenger event and any event in the Savage Divide.
---
Sounds decent that, herbivore wins ease i think, but carnivore definitely wins on most benefits that carry weight is definitely tempting
---
Ammo is no longer an issue for anyone using the ammo legendary perk. Also ammo is no longer an issue for anyone not using the ammo legendary perk. Because high levels will have a lot of extra ammo to sell.
---
Considering its base damage is reduced by 50% when applying a mod, the War Glaive definitely needs to be in the legendary pool.
---
But i like watching retro adverts on youtube so....🤣
---
The mutation itself is great to have for faster movement and guns you need to reload a lot. I run it without class freak and have no problems. Good doggy helps, of course.
---
Exactly. Ill never understand how people can have ammo shortages, now more than ever before.
---
You can place it at people's camps in a PRIVATE  team, so not any of the public teams. A friend gave me one yesterday, and today I gained the plan, so I also placed it at another friend's place. Pay it forward before Bethesda decide it's character locked!
---
I haven’t, but I can well imagine the improvements. The pip-boy UI for this game is clumsy as all hell.
---
All you need is 1 lockpick and it never breaks!
---
OOOOOOoh. Okay, I see what you are saying now.
---
Hmm. I *could* swap back to the default nozzle, but that effectively halves your damage output for the Flamer. Sad.
---
cant be that hard to make it so you select change all perk points instead of one ;-) but agree with the post, one free at lvl 50 and one at major changes would be nice ;-)
---
If that isn't a possibility then what are the private servers we pay for with a subscription for then?
---
I'm guessing most of us casual sandbox non-combat focused players are probably not even playing on public servers to begin with..
---
You might notice the food/drink at the start for a little while, but you quickly get used to it and adapt, the extra reload and movement speed comes in quite handy and you'll find it hard to go back without it once you take it.
---
The new Survival Shortcut perk if you take it also makes food/water loss a trivial matter for anyone.
---
Use the fo76 interactive map. Shows spawns for pretty much everything
---
Like previous people say there are players who are way lazy to look for lead which is the easiest to find since you can get about 100 per silo if you pick up all the barbells and loose weights, if you ran all 3 of them for 5 servers you be looking at 1,500 lead in an hour or so depending how much spare carry weight you got. Or hell if you ultra lazy go vendor hop and just buy it since I always run into people selling lead and steel in bulk forms for cheap. No excuse if anyone over level 80 says they have no ammo well to bad so sad this game literally holds your hand now for crafting ammo.
---
Super mutants
---
As others have said, the negatives are not a big deal, and in daily ops it really helps if you can run fast. I say go for it!
---
The amount of .50 cal you get from downed enemies and as final reward (150?) is quite underwhelming, though. Other ammo types like 5mm and plasma seem to yield way more.
---
Will do im gonna put it in my friends camp tonight thanks for the tip
---
https://i.imgur.com/dmm72x8.jpg - camp location
---
https://i.imgur.com/l1TFrxh.jpg - where it's. There's a tent with it inside.
---
Now we have to differentiate what we are talking about.
---
As a loot, the boss enemy in this case only has a little more random ammunition, you're right.
---
In the final report you will receive further rewards and the ammunition will then be the same as that which you needed to kill the boss.
---
That was datamined and I can reproduce it 100%
---
They do, fusion cores increase from one to 4 when you max out. Ultracite variants jump to 9 per craft instead of 2.
---
Sadly, playing in groups is leaps and bounds ahead of its solo counterpart.
---
Put it this way; I feel like I'm walking through treacle when I pop a Rad-X and my mutations stop working. So to me the speed is definitely noticeable.
---
The food and drink thing I didn't notice a difference at all. My character still chowed down food like I had worms, and guzzled gallons of water like I was incontinent, both with and without the mutation.
---
If you have the vaporisation nozzle then there’s no way you can avoid this problem. Every sever change and your flamer goes from shooting a stream of flame with fairly good range, to farting out flame about one foot in front of you. I’ve used so many resources always changing the barrel out then back in again to fix it.
---
There’s a radio host called Julie? Never listen to the radio in game, whoops
---
I can imagine Julie saying
---
"Xx_sniperboy_xX killed the legendary enemy without alerting others, what a scumbag"
---
Thanks. Yeah I actually took that one. Its only level one but I can see how it become handy with some hunger drain like this yes
---
it's not a skin though, its an unique weapon, kinda like the fixer
---
Marathoner does not work in PA, even says so in the card description.
---
Good point. Thanks!
---
I’m lower level right now and not only did my weapons get a lot weaker, but the enemies are now all just as strong as me at least level wise. 
---
So now not only are they harder to kill but it takes more bullets as well. I don’t see myself doing well since it’s now harder for me to collect lead to make bullets to use on quests and stuff.
---
Things are rough right now, hehe
---
I've have yet to get mystery picks yet you say it's 100%???
---
I'd get it. Food and water are plentiful even if it does drain at "full" speed
---
Unfortunately I doubt this will get the visibility it needs, as due to the cost of making fuel there seem to be few flamer users out there. Ridiculous that the nozzle bug has persisted for so long.
---
Ah gotcha. Makes sense as to why it's rarer then, which seems odd as it should be the other way around!
---
Thats the thing though.. this game should be a sandbox because that is what fallout is about since 3 imo. In a sandbox there really shouldn't be a "wrong way" to play to begin with.
---
A less than optimal way SURE. But not a wrong way...But you're right with this patch there now ARE serveral wrong ways to play and that is the problem.
---
This update only caters to those of you that likes to kill big dangerous things to get better equipment to kill the next big thing even faster. Thats not how me and my friends even want to play. Maybe sometime but definitely not all the time like it's been forced on us now.
---
And honestly there are a LOT of better games for doing exactly that.. But I'm not against having support in this game for that playstyle after all it is a sandbox. I'ts just I'm against having that being the ONLY viable playstyle...
---
They need to add more songs too, I feel like we've all just been listening to the same 5 songs on repeat I can't even stand to have the radio on anymore
---
Full Health :)
---
You can't be protected by SS armour despite the fact that you can get better rad res than some of the power armours.
---
It works for me sometimes but only if I wait at least one second. But many times it simply refuses to work, even if I wait 3 seconds.
---
Can I just publicly apologise to the 2 teams I joined yesterday for Daily Ops. I now realise I shouldn’t run off to kill the baddies but should stick around the beacons things so as to speed up the signal process whatsits. 
---
My bad, my very bad. That said I got a 3 rare reward drop including the War Glaive (built the electrical one, which looks very cool), so thank you.
---
Also on a previous run got the Spec Ops suit and have finally retired my tattered field jacket outfit.
---
Have you ever seen...a tree?
---
Yup daily ops rare reward. Happen to get mine on the very first daily op
---
Dammit I'm on 5k caps lvl 64 so out of my price range at the minute I have a vampire minigun 2 star but don't think that adds up to the extra 5k caps haha, lvl 64 and still learning things about the game still feel like a noob
---
Chinese Stealth suit or Hazmat suit gives 99&amp; radiation reduction and 1000rr, power armor gives 90% radiation resistance and whatever rr it has and SS armor just gives rr. It's the reason why css/hazmat and power armor do better than SS armor
---
Sounds like you're an experienced player staring a new character, not a casual player
---
I wonder if it can drop in legendary from purveyor/events
---
Can I just publicly apologise to the 2 teams I joined yesterday for Daily Ops. I now realise I shouldn’t run off to kill the baddies but should stick around the beacons things so as to speed up the signal process whatsits.
---
It's a funny post, but it's still just another attempt to brush concerns and complaints under the rug (and further down the page), while not considering that Bethesda is actually likely somewhat concerned about those gosh darned complainers finding something else to play and spending their money elsewhere.
---
Also I'll note it's another strawman of Bloodied builds, rather than all the lowbies and casual, and yes solo players where were told from the start they could play solo. Bloodied is still king.
---
How did you get it?
---
As said, they try their best to avoid talking about it, much like the VATS bug. The best you’ll get if you manage to beard a CM is ‘its complicated,’ which I think is a bit like when a Japanese person says ‘that will be very difficult’ what they actually mean is ‘that will be impossible.’ I don’t think they can fix it.
---
Yeah got this in the PTS and really want it on Live. That said I’ve had the spec ops suit and war glaive drop..
---
Yes please.
---
A lot of new and casual players are struggling with the sudden and jarring changes in builds and damage values since the update. If they stop playing the game, the population will drop and significantly  shorten the life of Fallout 76 as an online game. I’m seeing some new players struggle to even make it from the Vault to Flatwoods.
---
This is due to balance, since PA already grants you huge amount of various bonuses, but after the unyielding Legendary effects I don't think it's a huge deal.
---
I'm on xbox with a few good 3 stars like bloodied mini gun junkies combat shotgun 2 shot cryolater 2 shot fat man anybody know a good price checker sight
---
Isn't the Gutter the reward for doing the Burrows story line thing?

You obviously don’t have a wife.
---
&gt;“Of course you can play this solo. Whether you choose to explore the wasteland alone or with friends, your days will be filled with fun activities." - Todd Howard
---
Yes, how strange.
---
Yes I can confirm this since I am using 5mm. I get like 10 to 60 ammo per enemy
---
Thank you. Yeah, I'm just dicking around solo and tbh I'm not even sure I'm gonna go on bothering with these... not my kind of fun.
---
It's a way to make sure bloodied people don't die the instant they get out.
---
I support this stance 100 times over. Stay near the damn up link and dont die. I'll take care of the rest.
---
This is what Bethesda does best unfortunately, I keep saying it the atomic shop should be a comic book style catalogue of all camp armor and weapon cosmetics like they would see an instant increase to people buying atoms. Making everything “limited time only” doesn’t work when that is the case for 90% if the atomic shop.
---
For immersion purposes, I don't have the pipboy radio on figuring it'd alert enemies to my position. I like your idea tho. 3 Dog was my fave, although if I was just out scavenging parts for a blueprint, I used to hear the same story related stuff and got sick of hearing the same thing repeating until I had advanced the main story.
---
It's a complicated one, especially given everyone is at differing stages of the story.... Well, assuming radio is live and we all hear the same thing at the same time in 76
---
Yes "I understand why they changed from multiplicative to additive damage calculations." Whether the intention was to nerf or not, a nerf was the result.
---
It still took the base animations of the 10mm pistol though, and the fixer is basically a skin from the combat rifle the only difference is the stealth improvements
---
Unique would be a whole new pistol taking 10mm rounds
---
Are you running off to kill the bad guys? Get your team to stay close to the beacons and you’ll see the speed boosts.. work with just 2 players. I kept running off thinking it was based on killing but it’s a timer that can be sped up.. havent finished a single Op in over 8 minutes since..
---
Xbox pal
---
Xbox buddy wish I could
---
Must have. The extra hunger/thirst is negligible.
---
But the reload speed is something I can’t do without. Everytime it’s suppressed or I’m fresh into power armor (that breaks the reload buff until you switch weapons) it feels like I’m reloading in slow motion.
---
I still dont think its in the game from release so i wouldnt hold your breathe buddy would look nice with my gold skin though
---
Lol my comment fell under the wrong thread. My bad
---
I did not update my nvidia drivers and fps did not drop, so it might be driver. Maybe roll back to the previous version or unlock fps via the ini file?
---
Tbf, if you're in need of ammo you can just do some daily ops. Every enemy, and clearing the thing as well, drops ammo for the weapon you use (minus core weapons, but those still drop at the end).
---
2 runs of it today with my gatling netted me 1200 or so Ultracite 5mm, and when I used a flamer it got similar results, going from 700 to 1400 in a few runs. 1 run taking 6-8min.
---
its there for a while. Its pain and devs wrote something like they cant fix it easily ...
---
I made the shocking one, like the little bolts of electricity. Don’t actually use it much though, but it looks cool.
---
Thank you for the offer!!
---
Start building some mob specific sets. Beth tells us exactly what we are getting into. A troubleshooters armor set makes survival against the immortal robots even at low hp easy.
---
Would still be a waste of flux though. You should see about priming it and crafting Ultracite cores instead.
---
Yeah that’s unfortunate.
---
Right! My bad staying up too late on nukes and dragons not reading straight. Hahha
---
I know was definitely one of the best mods for a pistol made it look badass
---
TSE Fixer non automatic with Gunsmith 5 .. Not possible to do an endgame event without repairs during the event. It getting a bit ridiculous.
---
What, and have ass/sent power armor? No thank you! It already offers a flat 42% damage reduction, more if you have Emergency Protocols. Assassin and Sentinel on top of that would be even more ridiculous.
---
Earle?
---
Id look for a western revolver anyway bro the 44 does less base damage even though it takes the same round lol, my tse western does 176 after the patch with no damage perks so thats good :)
---
Personally I feel like the mechanics behind the progress bar when securing the area near the beacon, and the speed boost are very unintuitive.
---
When I ran my first op, solo, I had no clue how to make the progress bar go up - I ran around killing stuff because that was my first thought. Nothing suggested to me that I had to stand next to the beacon. I also had no clue about what even was the "speed boost", and even now after a few ops, if I hadn't been reading the subreddit, I wouldn't know that it goes up by standing next to the beacon.
---
It's not a huge issue for people who do use the subreddit and do research stuff like this outside the game, but within the game it definitely didn't feel intuitive to me.
---
Have you seen them doggo heads? They thick as fuck hard to fet through that skull.
---
Not sure I understand. Why do you have to scrap any character to start a new fresh character? I thought legendary perk slots were the only thing that carries over multiple characters.
---
Yup, same boat exactly. Wasn’t till I was in an Op yesterday where someone, through emotes, explained that I was being a dickhead.
---
Thats how fast we should have been in the first place.  A little bit more water but I was really surprised how little the negative was with class freak.  Reload speed is awesome.
---
I would think that it can, that's why I initially decided to learn the plan on an alt that doesn't know all the other plans that can dilute the drop pool.
---
I haven't had any drop yet to confirm this, though.
---
But I did get another war glaive plan after learning one, and I literally can't do anything with it besides destroy it
---
There’s something up with sneak damage, it’s been very inconsistent since the patch. I’m seeing the same thing even on identical enemies. The multiplier seems to just not want to work consistently.
---
I liked the diamond city host after you light a fire under his ass.
---
Hmm. I assumed a .50 caliber round would go thru his skull like butter :P
---
yeah unfortunately I build my latest camp with the skin on (after they said that it is fixed) and half the times my camp is grey and all the times my ally stay outside the area of my camp (motionless also) and I have to scrap them every day and change the location of their item, just to take the buff from sleep (kindred spirit or beloved). I don't want to change location, my camp is 1 month's old and I put a lot of effort to build my haunted house :(
---
I get what you mean, but if your regular enemies die anyway before it takes effect, what’s the problem? They’re dead either way lol
---
Unfortunately the game when the game was designed the event area was supposed to be the nuke zone. So when you die that's why you respawn in side the nuke zone, the players are the ones who have worked round this.
---
Thanks for the extra tips you've given me. I encountered that bug on a previous character that I was using with a friend (we were doing the whole game together on that one, so we are always at the same quest steps and location when logging in). We tried a few times and I found that it worked without a problem by adding the ghoul sample, running the test, then putting the fuse in. That was pre patch tho, so I'm not sure if I'll have to do the same on this character. Wasn't aware that it depended on someone else's progress, so maybe I just got lucky, but thought it was weird that everything worked without the fuse in place first. My RL appliances don't work without fuses 🤣
---
I joined an ops team to make it 4.. they all left:P I'm not going to bother trying to get teams.. managed 7m19s in the vault 94 one, just over in the super-mutant one.
---
Did the gutsy move eventually or did you die? 
---
If it doesn't move and you can continuously shoot it-its not your gun its the enemy who has glitched.
---
Anything that’s not “Your unarmed attacks do X” would be a welcome change.
---
Thx for the advice 👍
---
Legendary power armor is a thing, not officially but its definitely out their the PC wasteland of fallout 76. They range mainly from full sets of all PA ( except for T65 ) of sentenal unyielding AP refresh. I have heard they don’t work particularly well, since the game just thinks its regular armor since PA isn’t suppose to have legendary affects ( strangler heart doesn’t technically count since its a full set bonus ). So that being said you wont be benefiting from Power Armors built in 40 percent reduction to all damage, as proven by angry turtle. As if Bethesda will ever add legit obtainable legendary power armor? Hard to say really.
---
Yeah, I've noticed some inconsistencies too, but I thought I was just mad.
---
my mirelurk king was 30 before patch then 60 after, and is now dead - replaced with a higher level mole rat
---
my friend who is mute loves the game lol
---
Nah those size rounds make it through the head fat easy not the skull. :P
---
Gimme something for my Plasma Rifle as well and I'd be happy :D
---
Bloodied is still acceptable and dealing the highest damage.
---
Yes but bigger enemies die before the effect can trigger, too. like sentry bots and dearhclaws. It should work at least there to reduce the number of shots needed but it doestn, so the card seems like a waste of coins for me.
---
as far as i know it means you're getting hit in the left leg more
---
So from my understanding of explosives. The projectile hits for like 1 point of damage and then the game spawns the explosion in at where the round hit. So it might just be putting the crit to the 1 point spawn round.
---
You can see the 1 point on missles alot.
---
Not any good for flux if you're using flux for non-ammo uses (serum crafting etc)
---
Thats not the case. The right leg even has a larger bar than the left.
---
“‘Tis but a scratch!”
---
Going commando as a commando in power armor is definitely going to be the future.
---
400 PC hours and I'm yet to see one too, but I have seen a video where this guy put a MIRV attachment onto a pipe pistol. Fallout 4 though, there's probably people who did this on fallout 76 when it was first released.
---
Chiropractor is recommended
---
Yep I have the med back pack but now I’m a pa user it’s no good anymore I definitely think this should be a thing
---
^
---
But then we can drink something and magically increase gun damage. We can go low health and our guns magically have a drastic increase in damage.
---
There's only Surge, but in wiki we kill Caleb fisher.
---
I think this key spawn on last killed from this two named-subbosses. We just kill Surge second in most cases...
---
Anyway no caleb, no key, no lew, no bunker and all story arc is gone... just gone(((.
---
PS. good legendary raider with surge in most cases (2/3), so we can farm there... \*\*\* raider, but legendaries are only \*.
---
My lead run will net me over 2k lead in about an hour of playing. That's including lucky hole mine. Over 1k in a half hour without lucky hole.
---
Find VATS so bad now I just use it to find my next enemy cancel VATS and start shooting.
---
Heh no thats NOT what it means imho.
---
Whats happened here is a little bit like this analogy:
---
Imagine a standard MMO where no matter what you do you can kill even leveled (or lower leveled mobs) quite quickly with a variable effort but usually its at least relativly quick. You do not raid because you hate it, but perhaps you do some dungeon runs somtimes. All is fine and you game everyday.
---
But suddenly a patch hits and alla enemies now gain 500% or more max HP than they had before. And now the only way you're able to keep playing "yourway" without having to spend 2 mins per mob is to tailor your build for raid and raid A LOT to acquire raid quality gear so that you can increase your power and get get back to doing what you like with the same amount of efficiency.
---
I don't think anyone likes to be forced to do something they don't like doing just to enable them to do what they actually like to do.
---
Also I doubt anyone would like to one hit deathclaws or any other notorious fallout enemy. It's more likely that we don't want the entire wasteland be filled with those enemies. I want a deathclaw to inspire fear. But not a radroach or ant or a ghoul those should be trash mobs imo. If everything is bullet spongy then nothing really stand out does it?
---
If they wanted to increase the "difficulty" (in my world its more like tedium because dying in this game mean almost nothing). They could've done so without affecting the rest of the game. Like changing the spawn logic so that more difficult enemies spawn more often in certain areas or something. Or perhaps add more areas that are more tailored for the combat oriented min/max players.
---
Took me too long to kill that one too had to use vats for that 2% chance that kept appearing 🙃
---
We get different bonuses to damage reduction based off of stats. Perhaps the enemies do too. Maybe the dogs have more endurance and the super mutants have higher strength. 
---
I'm just making shit up here, but maybe there is something to it.
---
Put the VATS perk on and look at resistances...
---
I have a fixer plan for you. no charge.
---
i am on British time. online after 5pm. message me.
---
gt:  noman za
---
That's not what the guy who sold it to me told me :(
---
Yup, I literally only get lead pretty much from toys, pencils, shit like that. I pretty much never  go out of my way to get lead and I always have enough to produce ammo as needed, with the update I get excessive amounts of ammo with ease. People are just lazy as hell
---
Thicc
---
Then stop using the vaporization barrel? It tells you it decreases range and increases damage so I don't know what you'd expect from it lmfao I used It for a time and it did what I expected it to and didn't kill my conditioning.
---
As a stealth sniper myself, I can totally agree with that. I don't actually think the multiplier is doing anything other than displaying a popup at the top of the screen. I don't ever have damage numbers displayed, so can't tell for sure.
---
Im not sure if it works properly, sometimes i reload faster and its noticable like i critted a reload slapped that drum in instantly. Most times it feels like im reloading at normal speed.
---
Funky Duds
---
So, in your analogy, the people taking the steam engine were complaining that it got to the destination too quickly, and I pointed out there were push carts, and smaller locomotives, and even just their feet that would solve that problem already to whatever amount they wanted, but instead they insisted we make the railway path artificially steeper so their steam engine could take as long as a push cart.
---
That sounds amazing but i dont trust shotguns haha. They do alot of damage but it gets fixed unless you do vats.
---
Do you have different mods attached? Ie: one pocketed and one with ap refresh
---
I’ll donate 15,000 caps to you, then be grateful when you only say my name!
---
Good ones!
---
urrrrrg... what a stupid mechanism. it's too much unfair. Why explosive weapon always suffer disadvantage.
---
Secret service only comes in one.  And no. Neither of them have mods yet
---
Lol perfect!
---
I’d love to be the guy in Foundation who’s always drinking coffee
---
Read it was secret service after lol. Uhhhhh Idk then. Will look into this
---
I've been trying ever since the update, I'm not getting them at all!
---
I think there is a take all junk button
---
How is that? I have 3 saved up when I heard about this recipe. Looks like using one per event is adequate. You get one every time you win the event, which is often. Seems reasonable.
---
Perhaps it's that legendary perk breaking sneak attacks on my commando.
---
You just need to adapt to change. I have a low level character, he is doing just fine. People are over reacting. My character does not have a meta build, he’s all charisma and intelligence lol
---
That might explain it lol except it took everything (junk,aid,weapons,armour,misc, etc)
---
But the steam engines still won't take as long as the pushcart. Those of us with semi optimal - super optimal builds aren't having the issues people with unfocused builds are having, instead we're having to use strategy a bit more, there's a real risk we might actually die now. 
---
My build is only sort of optimal, there are perks I use that are lesser than others and I have more charisma than I really should so that I can share perks with friends. I now don't have to choose between carrying a gun I actually want to use or a shit gun that doesn't benefit at all from my build just to artificially gimp myself
---
I second this. Pissed me off seeing scorched doing it and we can't. It's clearly something still in the game files or those crystallised mofos wouldn't keep trying to evade and flank us.
---
No, it was moving around occasionally, and would shoot at me whenever I popped out of sneak. Its behaviour was perfectly normal. Once I switched to an automatic rifle I took it out in two shots.
---
I tested the same Gauss Rifle against a deathclaw an hour or so ago, and out of five shots showing 95% from quite close range, only one hit. And again, switched to an automatic rifle and killed it with around half a clip.
---
It’s just that gun not hitting.
---
With luck now that they changed the way damage is calculated they will start to adjust them. Back in the day demo expert was a 100% increase and made those weapons shine. But they nerfed it during the flood of duped TSE weapons.
---
It might be bc your intelligence wasn’t at 33 or was lower when crafting the other piece. Maybe make another to test? Still looking for a reason
---
Nvidia update their drivers every 5 F'ing minutes.
---
But turn of GSync/Vsync setting in the ini that helps
---
Everything you say is terrific for the high-level players. But legendary perks are only available once you reach level 50. Us low-levels also don't have full decks of perks where we simply pull in the right card to suit the situation. I don't have access to Ammo Factory, and I don't have Ammosmith or Super Duper in my perk deck. No one is shitting ammo on guys who recently started the game and are still leveling up. I have done absolutely nothing else in the game for the last 2 days but farm lead and gunpowder. No quests, no events, nothing but farm for ammo.
---
Please stop with the "The game works great for me, therefore it must work great for everyone else" mentality.
---
I just recently after the patch started to use lvl 2 fireproof. But im not sure if even lvl 3 fireproof is comparable to sizzling. I rly need someone who tested this.
---
Cause i can say that fireproof lvl 2 holds much dmg of my VE fixer when im shooting on the ground. But BE gatling plasma shots to the ground still launch me up almost instantly as bloodied.
---
Idk probably just a weird visual glitch. My BE flamer is breaking slower lmao
---
COVID is still a pretty good excuse. Something has to give. They planned for X amount of content, but it just isn't possible to hit those milestones anymore. They've delayed stuff numerous times now, where do you expect them to magically come up with more time and resources to do everything they planned in a shorter amount of time and less work force ability? Some stuff needs to go on a backburner, and there's no reason to work out kinks in a week long event  when you expect to have a full year to before you need to bring it out again.
---
i tried that and i got the scoreboard menu to appear and the progression bar to work correctly, thanks.
---
I only kill what I have to (if its blocking my way) until i get to the booster, there's time to mop up when the event is done
---
Give her a break. She’s........only 23.
---
I didn’t say they aren’t working. And cities are not 95% back to normal. Not even close. Where are you even getting that number? Oh yes, you made it up, to seem like the pandemic is over, so you can be right about a video game? 
---
But I’ve watched interviews where the devs have said they are all working from home, and that slows things down, and that the first month was working out the logistics of that. One of the things that slowed them down was having to download multiple versions of the game to test different game builds. Because when in the actual office, they have quicker and easier access to any version of a game the want. 
---
Some of the voice over work for different languages were put on hold as it takes up to 3 months to record, and sound studios in many countries were shut down.
---
You don’t know what your talking about and your doing the typical attack me because you don’t have anything to respond too because you don’t have facts.
---
I’ve got facts and experience. So you know. Go be a dick to someone else.
---
I was really worried about playing after seeing no end of complaints on here. I am a stealth sniper cats crits build and I'm not optimized, I'm not great at making builds etc and people keep saying that build is unviable after this update. I logged on yesterday to check and I fought various enemies at my level (I'm 155) and it just took 2-3 headshots instead of 1 which I don't think is bad? I'm so worried I've missed something here and I'm about to find out my character is utterly void now DX so far all I'm getting is that I will need to be a bit more sneaky because the enemies take a bit longer to down so I can't just stroll through one-shotting hordes any more 😅
---
Hey friends, julie he- welp I guess it's time to listen to the game music for a bit.
---
It doesn't process any more frequently as you rank up, but it repairs it more when it does.
---
I love fallout but this game is a list of missed opportunities.
---
You are clicking on the bars (can’t remember if it has one or two), and they don’t move?
---
Also tell me where the verdant season currently is.
---
No... op is talking about Evan. &gt;!overseer’s boyfriend!&lt;
---
I liked the sponsorships for diamond city radio in fo4. They were fun.
---
The second you die your health will go back to max, then the perk card will pop up like other perks that proc. Just had it happen for the first time and it caught me off guard.
---
Very strange indeed
---

---
Here's one with 2 rare rewards from one run. You get one roll per rank. If you get elder on first run, you get up to 3 rare rewards, first one with a 10% chance, second with 20%, third with 80%. So under 2% chance to get all 3 in one day.
---
Stealth suit, Hazmat suits (broken and undamaged) also allow you exceptional rad resist in nuke zones. it MAY be possible to have a full set of SS armor with Rad resist legendary effect, Rad-X, Max rank "What Rads?" and several other stacks to keep you from instantly dying, but you would be better off in PA, or the other options.  
---
i've tested What Rads in PA though, and i can stand in a nuke zone, take next to no radiation damage (outhealing the rads i take) and never need a radaway
---
Did you buy them or find them? Buying doesn’t count.
---
Really??? I really love her voice and personality. I think she’s repetitive but hardly the weakest. Travis was awful, before and after the quest. Three-Dog and Mr NV were pretty repetitive too.
---
Serious question:
---
I totally get that swapping cards to lockpick/hack is annoying and master infiltrator is a nice QoL feature for that.
---
But: why do people actually want to lockpick stuff? I stopped doing that like 150 levels ago. It’s not that locked containers yield anything different you don’t get from random unlocked containers. Why would I invest a legendary perk for looting more purified water and some ammo? What am I missing?
---
I also have an AA Combat Shotgun that also can’t hit a damn thing.
---
Both work perfectly fine manually aimed, but useless in VATS.
---
Ok. I was wondering about that because I didn't see it in the patch notes.
---
With you bro. I want a settler/raider PvP event that swaps between that whore and rose. Can’t imagine how yall feel about her though.
---
I’m selling serum at 499 each on PS4, what do you need?
---
[https://imgur.com/a/kgvD2FA](https://imgur.com/a/kgvD2FA)
---
Makes even less sense . Actually, now I even have more questions than before.
---
Level 75 super mutant has higher DR/ER than a 100 one? [https://imgur.com/a/gzc674d](https://imgur.com/a/gzc674d)
---
Why they all have different DR/ER if they are all the same level? [https://imgur.com/a/wkKHoMa](https://imgur.com/a/wkKHoMa)
---
Craft rad shield 300 resist and use 3 perks. ghoulish(during day)so rads hep heal,rad resistant for protection, and sun kissed to automatically reduce rad levels. If you have extra resist from armor then don’t worry about rad resistant perk. Pair with vampire weapons and some rad away and you’ll be a god amongst men
---
Thanks for this! Looks like I have to do more Mire events..
---
I've been playing in 3rd person this morning and I have to say there is a real difference, I can happily ignore these bugs if they happen, in 3rd person it's as if they happen less. Using VATS with Concentrated fire 3\* set to 'body' works great.
---
Sprinting around the mire killing with the vampire's version at around 40% health for a small boost from Adrenal Reaction, it's a change from my Sneak Bloodied and is really fun. And the firing speed definitely mandates 3rd person view, the difference is night and day.
---
I'll roll some more Gauss Shotguns now just to see what pops up 😁
---
Personally, I think Beth should separate servers into PvP-focused and non-PvP focused, like WoW used to be (maybe still does). Keep the specified PvP zones, even in the so-called "Care Bear" servers, but disable Pacifist mode entirely on the killer servers.
---
LOL, I must be running in low power mode, need coffee!!
---
Personally I think instigating would be the best for melee, but yeah after this update I no longer use my bloodied melee because a vats (good) shotgun attack will insta kill majority of things.
---
I wear the Chinese Stealth Suit... with helmet and everything... I't great for those moments when you need to exit the PA in radiation zones.
---
Psn?
---
Hello Im saying every other occupation is at work in a "office"
---
Do you have any available 1 star perks?
---
I'll have to check again after I get home from work. I wonder if this is due to some type of exploit or an issue the dev team had with implementing new atomic shop items? With all the cultist and mothman items in the shop lately, I hope fo1st members get a cultist / mothman themed survival tent.
---
Well, the snap and having to use a repair kit to use it again much more often is a weird visual glitch.
---
This made me laugh. What do you mean you can’t add any perks? Are you talking on level up? Select a different special and then tab over to strength.
---
when strangers give magazines to you also counts towards completion.
---
got two completed that way.  one was given to me by a rider near the giant teapot and the other by a settler near watoga.
---
Kinda badly cropped, but I guess it makes sense. Also nice to see The Gutter got the same treatment as the Whistle in the Dark in terms of visuals - I imagine both of those would look dope when used in Settler PA.
---
At least this means I only have to run it once a day.
---
The one I soloed earlier, I got 8:01. XD
---
You dont think lag might be involved?
---
Becausda.... that's it :-)
---
You’re missing the point. If you switch the barrel (let’s say you’re using a long barrel) to short, then back to long again, on the weapons bench then the range increases with the vaporisation nozzle still equipped. Whichever way you slice it, the mods are not working as they should.
---
I've only just started using it, maybe no more than a couple of weeks ago, it's still working fine for me. Nice to see it flash up while I'm cryo-ing the SBQ.
---
Feels like I see atleast one person with a hacked weapon everyday. 50 cals that fire an explosive shotgun volley, flamethrowers that shoot bullets...  i wonder if beth supporr looks at the videos we send them, its rly obvious when someone has thosr ludicrous weapon
---
For every shot with specific weapons including 30 in a row, but no problem with others?  My 10mm is also fine.
---
They infinitely spawn, plus they are leveled to the player. Just run past them. Best thing would be to get next signal going then help clear his way if he gets stuck (while staying inside booster range)
---
Gorram, it's bad enough to hear in the show, please not IRL :-)
---
Piercing Gaze is attached to the “Uplink” series of daily ops, once the daily ops category changes your stealth build will be effective again.
---
The number of railway spikes I got back yesterday was insane. More than doubled my starting amount.
---
So, like I said, I've been running with Buddy for about 150 levels. Never once got anything better. Today I got a War Drum with +1 AGI, Instigating and 40% fast swing. So when I hit creatures for the first time, it's double damage. The base damage is the same as my axe. But with perks, it's so much faster than my ax that I'm able to take out creatures faster because of more damage upfront and it's SO MUCH FASTER.   
---
Why couldn't it be an axe? I love my axe. I'm not getting ride of my Buddy.
---
Way to keep it on point my dude. ;)
---
Every Fallout game is a loot simulator. One Wasteland was a fucking mistake.
---
This is good to know! Thank you
---
Dude factories are working, stores working, libraries working, salons working, bmv/dmv working, mechanic shops working, recycling centers working, utility companies working, and bethesda "cant finish my work remotely its to distracting"(And your problem before the pandemic?)
---
Happened to me as well, the barred door latch doesn't work
---
its not a "slug" , it fires scatter but all pellets hit target. 
---
Its not a bug, and when it is, it should not be because without it nobody will use shotguns.
---
Never mind. got a bloodied war glaive from purveyor literally 10 minutes later. lol
---
If lag i would think so but something doesn't seem right
---
They will never act on this, they will not read it, it's juts another complaint post...pointless you might say :-)
---
Yeah you're wrong. 
---
  
---
You don't even need to "play through all the new stuff". Just look at your perk screen and you'll quickly understand the conversation.
---
I have a level 30 rifleman that was level 20 when patch hit, and it has never experienced an ammo issue. I played it the day the patch dropped, and have played it since. Ammo has never been an issue. The resources you need are not hard to find to begin with, and if you are too fuckin lazy to find the resources and make the ammo, the only person you can fault for your ammo lacking is yourself. It should not take you two days to farm for ammo, so I'm calling total bullshit on that. I have over 1500 5.56 on my low level alt, no ammosmith on it either. Stop making excuses
---
Press any other special and then press either R1 OR RB until you’re in the special perk that you want.
---
Build and scrap of you can't find em
---
why couldn't they just pair the notifications with audio (that is voiced by her) and pause the music?  They could be two totally separate things, but because they're both her it would feel like it was all the radio.
---
I think it should be upped. But I also think they should lower how much you get in scrip for 2 and 3 stars. Maybe just the three stars. Yeah, that's not going to be popular and I'm getting downvoted.
---
But they really don't seem like they are going to raise the limit to 500. Maybe 200, which will be a little better. But I think lowering how much you get would also help. It means having to turn in more, but a lot of people seem to be mostly upset about how they have too many legendaries to cash in. 
---
And suggesting that people don't farm legendaries isn't going to happen. That's what some people are playing the game for.
---
You’re not being a good 12 year old kid in a CoD lobby until you toss around more swear words and throw the N-word in every other sentence.

Idk-Yeet73
---
Yeah I needed one for this a long time ago and found it in a vendor at player camp. Bought it, it doesn’t work like that. Just go somewhere magazines spawn and server hop until you find the ones you need
---
Then take her off all together. Her "I'm 23" story make me stop listening to the radio.
---
I liked the diamond city host before the quest, not after. Awkward guy was a unique, relatable vibe, super chill to listen to and really funny. After the quest he turns into some generic loser trying too hard to be cool and failing in every capacity.
---
not fixed fyi, had it happen right after patch first SBQ, couldnt respawn
---
Or make it work like treasurey notes. Turn your guns in for notes, and your notes in for the scrip limit. Cuz the stash weight is the real killed for me
---
I guess you never played a Fallout game before, but this is how it is.
---
They do have weight. But very very little.
---
Well you do seem an authority on pointless contributions.
---
No mutations, and no food perks. The survival stim itself with no bonuses or perks gives 100% food and 200% water.
---
Sneak is definitely broken. I barely get my Multipliers
---
And you will respect my authority, point taken?
---
Id put them right in the same categories as the laser weapons, should have just said enegery pistols/rifles in general
---
It should be a rotatable rotation IMO, just like the melee one
---
To be fair the slow effect really wasent to bad sorta felt like walk speed at sprint speed maby even less dremattic
---
Even not farming, but playing all day, I have ended up with too many and always carrying too much extra weight is annoying.
---
SS armor set and Whst Rads with someone on team sharing Rad Sponge rank 2 will keep you at 0 rads.
---
1. I NEED IT
---
2. I WANT IT
---
3. like i care wtf
---
4. I WANT IT
---
5. maybe increase the level cap but I don't want to see a level 1000 tesla rifle
---
Zenimax isn't JBS meat. They actually are trying to keep their employees alive. Also Texas is a garbage fire
---
No problem.  :).  Yeah, the Daily Ops are honestly a breath of fresh air.  Something fun to do in the interim.
---
Go melee then.  
---
I wasn't able to use guns while leveling up either.
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
*edit: melee is much faster and smoother than using guns. overall a better experience but you can use guns if thats what you like to do   
---
Please don't try to put words in my mouth and act like I said you can't use guns. You people suck.
---
Some of these are legit complaints, others are not. Do you really need a level 300 weapon? Level 50 is more than enough.
---
Oh I dont know maybe from the $18 power armor skins the subs or the other overpriced atom shop crap everyone buys? Yeah perhaps the millions in qtrly profits they see from Fo76.
---
I agree!
---
It still works fine after patch and as someone else pointed out - higher ranks just increase the amount it repairs, not the proc fequency.
---
They award cores at the end, based on whatever weapon you have equipped when you finish the last objective.
---
You can run around with any weapon you want and then swap to your ultracite core weapon at the end for a massive positive.
---
It's a game of follow the leader, I kill most of them as I go and they are directly behind me
---
Very nice! I noticed you're using demo expert, is it for grenades? Thanks again for the inspiration for this build! Lol
---
It was never this bad though. I missed first shots quite often before patch 22. After patch 22 I get this which is totally unacceptable.
---
Sir, yes sir!
---
Stupid question.
---
Isnt the daily for NW and not adventure mode.
---
Sorta they released fasnacht on time then it was bugged so they delayed 1 wk than re-released. Not to mention they have not seen a single roadmap to fruition since release...PATHETIC!
---
I know the plan and the crafted version isn't tradable but is legendary versions?
---
Use super duper when crafting them and make the lowest lvl one possible. 
---
You can buy the medium night vision scope, until you unlock the reg med, these mods are always last to learn it seems.
---
Personally I prefer the classical radio. No DJ, just some tunes thats are easy to zone out on while you're doing your dailies. Cataluña is hands down my favorite one for clearing dungeons and large mobs. Its elegant but invigorating.
---
Also if you hate Julie's voice, theirs a spotify playlist. I copied that one and added songs from previous games and its loads better
---
What helped for me, was downloading a mod on Nexus that highlighted trash that had specific components like lead and acid. Once you “cheat” and turn on glow; its everywhere. Shit was hiding in the dark.
---
So far, so good on the daily ops. Except for Resilient days. Those are annoying. I think I'm gonna skip those in the future.
---
Thanks very much. Everyone has different reasons for playing. And one reason isn't really better than another. But a persons reason for playing will certainly impact how they experience the game. The more single focused you are about a game, like trying to make a one shot, impossible to die character, every time you don't get the things you need to be that, you're going to be disappointed. 
---
I play for fun. Log in, run around my husband and friends. Sometimes we set our own goals. Like, run the length of the Savage Divide and do all our treasure maps. For a while we had the rule, no fast traveling save back to our camps. 
---
There's all kinds of self imposed limitations you can have to amuse yourself. Our current one, don't look at the map. Remember how to get to places to see  how well we know the world. 
---
In the last 3 days, we've also started experimenting more with our perk set ups. Before it was, this is our fighting set, crafting/repair set. Because old perks we never really needed, now seem to have value. And that was what this change did the most for me, and my friends. It gave a lot of things new value. 
---
In a way, it's like finding a new game.
---
That’d be sweet.. it doesn’t have to be ALL the events.. just just a handfull like project paradise/earl/SBQ/teatime(whynot)/heart of the swamp/some of the horde events/ the crazy difficult one with the imposter sheepsquatch yaknow
---
Also, some people have had problems with various PERT cards not working but is remedied by unequipped in and then re-equipping them, so maybe try that with any sneak perks you have.
---
What quests are you running into trouble with? At level 20, I'd stay in the Forest for now and explore, maybe keep one eye on the Fairgrounds area for Leader of the Pack, and hit Fertile Soil when it procs. If you've got decent spatial awareness, look into Death Blossoms and Back on the Beat. Also look for Cow Spots Creamery and find a woman's body to start getting the "Ecological Balance" daily. EDIT if you're on PC, look for me (Lamorak\_2000). I'll help you out if I can.
---
I second this I'm sick of running out of space because I want to have a long play session.
---
Awesome to know they do come as legendary!
---
You gotta admit, the protectron voice line she has is amazing
---
I can 4-shot them...if by 4 I mean 5 and by shot I mean full magazines... lol
---
I will add you buddy ill be on the same time after work british time and are you sure i can't give you anything to help you out in any way ammo? Fusion cores ? Anything?
---
No, he is pointing out that his current setup totals 14 points and he can’t equip another 1 point perk even though he should be able to since he has 15 points in strength. But if he unequips a 1 point perk it will allow him to equip a 2 point perk to go to 15. I imagine this is 100% a bug with the legendary perk for specials jumping from 3 to 5 at the final level. The game miscalculates something with the legendary perk. Essentially I think a Bethesda needs to give us one free full reset of legendary perks once they get their shit together
---
This. Plans for lever action rifle mods drop with a 10% chance from scrapping lever action rifles, so stock up on screws, get the weapon plan from the Responders vendor bots in Camden Park or the Whitesprings Mall, equip Super Duper and start crafting and scrapping.
---
Alternatively, find someone you trust and who is willing to mod your rifle for you.
---
I don’t think that be possible
---
And it will destroy the game barter economy
---
Hmm, I really love all of these characters honestly. Travis is definitely the worst out of the bunch, but idk there was something about him that made him more than some nervous ass radio host to me
---
I played 3, NV and 4. And no, this isnt how it werent. Combat was more complicated if you didnt choose combat options, but they werent that resource hungry, and umbalanced, so there was not really the need to fully spec yourself in combat. In FO76, you pretty much need, since you need to kill to farm, kill to defend farming points, kill to protect your camp, and kill to do anything.
---
Symptomatic is basically disease cure? 
---
I want one
---
Agree on that one
---
I want that soooo much
---
Imo they're way too easy, hope they add some hardmode to them at some point
---
Yes you did. You had actually several forms of raising your attack power. We had small guns, explosives, energy weapons and melee, also unarmed that you can raise to 100. This is basically that, but in the form of perks.
---
No im saying its maxing out at 14. Eg if I remove traveling pharmacy rank 3 it says I have "4 unused pt" when I add it back its maxed out. I can't add another rank 1 card. I can get it to 15 by adding 2 rank 2s, but not a 1 and a 3??
---
Out of curiosity (not trolling), what sort of difficulty increase would you like to see? Lots of creatures roam and attack in packs, Scorched use cover a lot, although their AI could be better.
---
Wats the point. It is more fulfilling letting them have a powerful legendary at low level...
---
This! Fucking yogi the rage bear needs to chill. One swipe and im tumbling across the wasteland like a tumble weed.
---
Best legendary perk to max out. For example before using that card and just using super duper maxed and the ammo perk card maxed I could get 3 ultrice plasma cores for 2 regular plasma cores. Now with this card and not even counting super duper I get 9 ultrice cores. I had 10 regular plasma cores the other night and I used all 3 cards I ended up have 50 primed cores for only 5 yellow cake flux. I crafted 2k 2mm for my awesome vampires gauss mini I got last week. It only took about 40ish steel and lead. Best card to have if you love ammo
---
Stupid sexy Flanders
---
Solar is much better if you can afford the bullion, vault steel and leg modules, can't beat that healing for you and team.
---
Why does your mind go there first instead of simply adjusting the backpack straps to fit the PA arms through?
---
Worst case scenario I’d just use a carabiner on the backpack handle and clip it onto the back of the frame
---
Yes. Many players simply do not understand this theory n moved away from the objectives repeatively. Miss my regular groups. We just form a back to back firing squad n blast our way...
---
No problem i might have some explosive revolvers at my camp also if you are interested ill have to look after work but i can check are you on xbox
---
Yeah, I’ve had the auto lock also complete the challenge. For me, I upgraded the hell out of this perk because it then opened up 3 to 6 perk points in perception.And save me the trouble of having to switch out cards regularly.
---
Dumbest thing I have ever read lol. Exp gain literally means everything, even more score, as xp gains is the main repeatable for score. No one doesn't want xp gains lmfao
---
They should update they Perk a little. Maybe Lone Wanderer should also increase carry weight like it does in Fallout 4?
---
Damn I hope I get this. What blade would you say was best? It appeared electric or cryo were doing the most damage but it's hard to tell without seeing their stat screens.
---
Only newly introduced weapons need the plans to drop as legendary. Such as the fixer, bear arm, sheep weapons, gold bullion stuff, ect
---
The fixer plan is worth 5-10k, you can always save up caps and buy one from someone on the trading sub
---
like more out in the world I mean, rather than part of an hourly event.
---
Move camp.
---
The one time I ran into assultron she turned my anus inside out. I got killed 6 times and everytime my body landed further from her; so eventually I was able to sneak away. This was pre One Wastand. She was 30 levels higher then me.
---
No wonder i have been seeing a lot of nearly naked players nowsaday...
---
Is basically that, but organic, and pretty much "passive", nowhere near as "binary" as in FO76. And still, you had a ton of choices towards how to continue playing. Here you dont. is fight your way, or fight your way. It isnt exactly fair because they are different styles of game, but the focus and necessity on combat is over the top, and completely alienates many fans of the franchise, without the need to.
---
Yes it's true. And that's not a bad price. People say '$6k' but on PS4 I've only seen more like $10k.
---
That's one I don't mind: random dead creatures falling out of the sky (my tent was hit by a radstag once) is hilarious, even if it's unexpected and startling.
---
Dosent it have  a quest Marker?
---
And you should win stuff by listening!
---
👍🏻
---
Top floor on the right. Small shop probably two doors down. On the counter on the left.
---
I really want to see a Yoi fighting a deathclaw.
---
What...How... 
---
What's holding you back? maybe we can help.
---
Fun fact 150 per hit is still more then I hit with a single round from my handmade that isn't a critical hit.
---
There are a few legendaries you can only get from the Purveyor or as a drop if you know the plan, fixer beeing one of them. No idea if it's worth 8k, though.
---
This was a refreshing analytic comment. There is of course unfortunatly clowns and vultures in all ideologies.
---
I honestly never knew how bugs were fixed in games &amp; thought to myself "why doesn't Bethesda just fix them, are they seriously THAT much into their wallet" but your explanation made a lot of sense, not to be rude of course. Thank you for sharing this info because now I understand that it isn't as easy as 1-2-3. It takes work, &amp; a lot of it. Hell, you're also right, how can you fix something if you don't even know where to find it?
---
Anyways, thanks again for sharing this. I now have a bit more respect for Bethesda for trying to fix the bugs players report while releasing new content in their patches. :)
---
On the checkout counter In a store on the second floor on the other side of the fountain from where you enter.
---
Someone’s salty. They’re not a coding slave factory give em time and yell louder but more respectful
---
I have the Gutter Plan, can it drop as legendary now too?
---
Not that I can see. I've quit and restarted it 3 times now. I'm beginning to think it's bugged.
---
Its still a pain.they keep spawn me in radiated zone and fast travel me between floors... worst. Spawn in front of mobs n got instant killed as you cant move for the first 1~2 secs
---
I just played for the first time in a few weeks, I'm level 31. It was already starting to get pretty boring to play, just had my ass handed to me left and right from enemies that didn't so before. I think I'm done with this game. I gave it multiple honest chances, it just sucks.
---
Or just tie it on the back haha
---
I don't understand what the hell you're talking about, but 366. There are 366 days this year.
---
Oh, is it the same thing as .45 ammo with 2\*Bandolier?
---
I figured that was the downfall of the minigun unfortunately- and Ill probably start vending it when I cant carry it anymore, at 1 cap of course
---
Idk about you, but I could have never beaten deadwind cave in foNV without maxed out small guns.
---
And in fallout 1, imagine trying to fight with less than 120% small guns. You would never hit anything.
---
All of PackTray’s plans sell for no more than TEN caps! Stop by and see for yourself! You’ll love The PackTray Difference [tm]!
---
Yeah we could just kill random trick or treaters like the mole miner event or scorched christmas event.
---
Assassin's change only affects weapons, not armor unfortunately.
---
I don't think so. Pretty sure you can only craft that one. As it has legendary effects already
---
And say they do 500 and you will be back coming that 500 is not enough
---
Wasn't it like the fixer, with some sort of bonus effect?
---
I was struggling to level up before this patch since im levek 326ish, but since the oatch dropped im levelling up 2 or 3 times a day without really thinking about it
---
Teamwork! Awesome
---
I may be in the minority here, but I don’t see much difference in the patch.  Yeah I gotta shoot a couple more bullets, but nothing crazy.  I maybe shoot a super mutant 4 or 5 times instead of 1 or 2.  I haven’t changed my build at all, just added the legendary ones to my old build.  Bloodied commando here.   I do like the higher level enemies all over the map bc now I’m leveling like crazy and I don’t have to worry about score bc I’m getting so much experience for the repeatable.
---
Maybe you should just take a break from the game.  If your not enjoying it, find something else for a while to fill your free time.  👍🏻
---
Fo76 was way scarier BEFORE the update as a low level. Running into a level 63 scorched at level 25 was basically a spring run to the nearest building, out the window, and then sneak away. Now every enemy is my level and I never run into elites anymore that can turn my anus inside out.
---
You said its just flavor if you dont understand why I said what I did based off your own comment I really cant fix well...
---
If I recall class freak doesn’t effect speed demon. But even so, the hunger/thirst thing isn’t bad at all. I don’t even notice it. Especially with carnivore
---
Use the last 5 minutes before the daily op you finish closes to go around and loot all the ammo. I've been keeping myself in ultracite 308/5mm this way
---
Yeah but it has 2 effects, better damage and vamps I think
---
In fairness, we are quickly approaching the 2 year anniversary of the game - for bugs that have been issue since launch, what timeframe do you feel is reasonable to give them if not 2 years?
---
So the first day when we fought and had to melee the robots to kill them. One get random but when you complete it before you check the report pull out the weapon you wanna get Ammo for.
---
Great, I can be lvl 1000 sooner. Not really anything good or cool about that but you know.
---
Same as myself - I can live with the limit, but we need some way to offload this stuff like the mentioned treasury notes type idea
---
There's nothing you can do other than get better gear, if u want to stop dying
---
Maybe, but you still have minimum 10 rounds in a mag you can just fire out. And there is no preparation  to do so. Not compared to melee preparations and dps.
---
oh true! thanks
---
Yeah, when I get real serious on an enemy, and my main for SBQ/Earl is a AAE1P Gatling Plasma that I call Kill ‘Em All.  I get to hang back a little with it.
---
that's nice and all, but I'd also like weapons to actually have some firepower. It's rather immersive shattering to see a disgusting rat shrug what is basically a metal slug fired right into it's skull at..6 times the sound barrier? Here's hoping they bump the weapons up AND keep the leveled stuff. I didn't mind the higher level fellas from before, I had fun with them, but now?
---
Throw on a deathcaw gauntlet or a powerfirst and join the fight club. Those are considered unarmed.
---
You're welcome!
---
That's literally what they said at launch. There was one PVP server and one PVE server. Then obviously multiple instances inside those two to support many players. 
---
They removed PVP to make room for Nuclear Winter, and claimed it was because nobody liked open world PVP and the servers were never busy. The only real downside to open world PVP was that you couldn't fast travel anywhere except to train stations and your base, and obvoiusly events.
---
and then runs out of batteries.
---
Hell yes.
---
Oh great, another inconsistency added. \\o/
---
Would be great to do this so I don't have to look thru some list I made of stuff I put on my alts. Looking on the app would be extremely convenient.
---
To add to this suggestion I would like to see a shared stash between alts maybe for Fallout 1st members.
---
So important. The differential between what you use on a good gatling gun and what the mission gives you is huge also, you will easily come out with 800+ extra ammo.
---
Whew, dude, when using Talk-to-text, please tell your system when to place periods, commas, etc. It's not too bad for the first few thoughts, but for this long of a comment, please, please use punctuation! It'll make it so much easier to read.
---
Good looking trash tho
---
Also don't check the report either. Once you check the report, u are telephoned out. I look at the report once I feel the looting is done or timer is at 45 or 50 seconds left. Sometimes less
---
Just to be clear are you talking general combat or specifically Queen. Because at the Queen my handmade did like 8 damage before the update.  Not had a chance to try yet post update. 
---
For your average mob I hit around 40 to 70. Higher on ghouls because of ghoul slayer effect.
---
Increase your AP as much as you can and use loads of power attacks, they are still multiplicative.
---
But the best thing you can do is change your build but i see youre not up for that.
---
The problem here is that in FO76 the heavy combat is continued, is not restricted to end-game stuff, or X or Y zone. Yeah you would not go to kill 8 deathclaws without having a good build in NV, but you COULD surround them, sneak, and still complete objectives. Not in FO76. In FO76 you have to KILL. And if you dont want to kill, everything is a chore if you are not combat focused because you still have to kill to do whatever you want.
---
If this was somewhat balanced, combat could still be the main point of the game, but thats not the case. Legendary gear and damage perks are the main focus of attention in builds. Most people dont go and think "i want to use a pistol, and grenades" and do the build. People go with "oh, I have to get b/j2525, Uny, and The 6 perks for that kind of weapon, or i wont be able to enjoy the game at all". Because there is no variety. Is either Combat focused or combat focused. The only things that are not focused on combat (legendary effect/perks) are mostly used because they are bugged and cause massive spikes on damage, thus making it combat focused again.
---
I have been doing daily ops with a character that is normally stealth and healing factor with wood armor and while it is not the murder festival of my PA guy, I'm not changing perks at all to kind of prove a point.
---
Or moleminer gauntlet as I am using it rn :D
---
Then there's something fundamentally wrong with the game.
---
With a few minor changes you would die a hell of a lot less, but it would mean changing your playstyle a bit.  
---
It's the nature of life and games..  if it screws you up change it. :)
---
At least 500 scrip will get more than 1 hour of gameplay to fulfill.
---
They've been my go-to when zeroing out my daily vendor
---
Ah yes. Daily ops gives you an infinite string of enemies that can be mowed down for just max XP but MORE than max XP because they are all over level 50 now. 
---
Eat a leader bobblehead, have more xp in teams, well rested, and relish and you will be soaring
---
I thought both were the same kind as the fixers increased sneak
---
I can't recall is it a chance per fireing activation (pressing the key) or just as long as you fire (holding the key)¿
---
I buy plans at $5-8k and resell them for 11k.
---
Just got on to a laggy server so I checked it against my rifles, shotguns and Tesla. It was just a visual glitch didn't lose any ammo.
---
Maybe but it sounded cooler before, it was more sci-fi sounding now just meh.......
---
Level 3 locked containers have a chance at really rare plans for plan hunters. Also if you don't glitch the nuke silos you'll need lockpick to skip the pipe fixing and get to terminals to turn off turrets.
---
Dude your fucking balls deep in amazing. Thanks!!
---
Processes on hitting/damaging enemy.
---
Couldn't find it. Even quit out of the server and tried a new one. The only quest marker I see on my compass takes me to the far corner of the building where I can't go any further (it's like the marker is outside of the map).
---
I'd also be down with finding the candy bowls just hidden around the world.  Promote people going out and exploring random places.
---
Exactly! Who would do such immoral and disgusting thing when you can have [him](https://imgur.com/URqtpRR).
---
When u start. Take the staircase on your right.  Then go straight into the first shop u can.  It’s in a table/bench
---
Well, that downside plus the one of getting ganked by some bored griefer who gets a hard-on from killing noobs.
---
Thanks. I appreciate that.
---
I only keep 5 on me the rest o vendor
---
uhhh usually while you're leveling up its suppose to be a bit hard but ok
---
I guess you're not a fan of progression. I can gladly say I shoot bullets all day long now and don't care about ammo.
---
Big brain strat
---
It's been like that forever!  
---
I can't remember the last time I made ammo for my shotgun character, but my commando and heavy gunner spend half their time making ammo.  
---
The patch has actually helped with the ammo factory perk.  I've got ultracite rounds coming out of every pocket and orifice!
---
I doubt you'll see any changes but you never know.
---
No I’m not but thanks anyway
---
Pirate Costumes just increased their value 👀
---
no problem. don't need anything. see u online later
---
Making enemies bullet sponges add a terrible/false sense of difficulty
---
You don't get those unless you subscribe to the premium insult package
---
"if you're good at something never do it for free"
---
Pretty sure the wasteland ain't threat free if a level 9 can see level 50 scorched in the forest
---
I use HDR on my slim and I don't notice any performance drops.
---
All you can do is get better gear and better perks
---
Try junkies out. You should be able to get a junkies Chinese sword pretty cheap to keep your look. Doesn't take any doing of a build, just get 5 addictions and boom 50% more damage
---
You can also get some vanguard armour for cheap in player vendors, even 1 star stuff would help you stay alive. I sell 1* van stuff for like 200c when I get it
---
Also just work on your build. A few more damage perks and a few less qol
---
So thats wat a war glaive looks like...
---
One day people will realise you can use your map marker on the launch map and place it where you want perfectly...
---
I can confirm it drops plasma cores! But are you sure about fusion cores? I used my vampire Gattling Laser Gun the whole Daily and didn't get any fusion cores at the end
---
This game does not require optimised specs unless you’re referring to bloodied and stacking different perks. Junkies, anti armour, vampires and two shot are the simplest guns to pick up and cope fine with this update.
---
Shit I wish. I did find someone to build it for me if I let him. But only plans I’ve gotten. 3 times I’ve gotten vault 94 outfit and liquid courage
---
What platform are you on buddy
---
She needs to have NPC guests on her shown, like Meg and Ward. Maybe Lil Dicky too because he's fire.
---
Well that is really disappointing :/
---
I've regulary seen them on sale for 5-10k on player vendors.
---
As a 24 year Army veteran I can verify that going commando thing is real, that's just one less thing to wash while you are out there in combat and the Wastelands should be no different.  Now being in PA might be a little different.
---
Agree. As a bloodied melee you take big risks and need to be rewardedfor it!
---
If they dont balance things fast we will no longer have any choises about how to build our character. Sure we had a meta before but now its not just if you want The best damage, its about if you want do The end game content.
---
Best of luck. I got aid reduction pieces on my armor because I too had to get rid of those perks and man did it suck. 😂
---
I have to get used to the fact, they won't die as quick. I shoot them still thinking they will die quickly and stop worrting about them, then all of a sudden boom it hits me again. I am like oh, yea. I forgot lol. 
---
So used to the old damage lol. Its more challenging not complaining at all. Just have to remember they don't die on first shot any longer.
---
 Lots of pros: The daily ops is great, the awards going into your inventory, the timer is set long enough to go back and loot the bodies. The report is interesting to read. Crater and foundation are free travel spots so I m finally visiting them again. Legendary perks are good, i have more strength and ammo making abilities. AND as mentioned above the XP gain is great, I don't farm xp, just play and whatever I get is fine. Last few days, leveling up is quicker, the scoreboard just keeps opening up the rewards almost constantly and I am still just playing casually. 😁
---
Private server = easy resources
---
I can confirm I have been getting ultracite fusion cores as I've been using ultracite Gatling, good times
---
How much for the premium?
---
Ok, 100 score for 10000xp. Without it you still can do score easly. Thats second case to level up. Any other?
---
Idk what to tell you buddy, you don't like to fight, but fo76 is all about fighting with building on the side. This is how the game works.
---
If you truly want to go through the game without fighting, get sneak lv 3  and get a chinese stealth suit and a fixer. I am 100% sure nothing will see you. Except in daily ops.
---
Post a screen shot. This is very hard to follow.
---
You just put on any shit you find gotta be better than non.ledg stuff?

If Pacifist eliminated all damage to and from players, and protected the Pacifist's CAMP and pets, and was Iron-clad (no loopholes like exploding bait or the legendary perk mentioned in another thread), then I think there'd be less pushback. A lot of players (maybe even a majority?) feel there are enough NPC threats in a Fallout game without having to worry about PC threats too.
---
Oh no you mean something besides a bloodied build might be viable?
---
It's taking me three hits with my melee weapon (including the 2.5x extra perk and *** including double damage and extra power damage) by which point they're sitting at me and everyone magically knows exactly where I am :(
---
I do this for 5mm and fuel as well, it is fuckin STONKS
---
cant be traded
---
U need someone, at least 2 in the group with magic weapons to melt earl's health down
---
Just change to heavy, its super strong and you already have the perk points needed. What level are you?
---
Well, Anti Armor is extremely potent post patch. Obviously that’s not the whole picture being painted, but just an observation. I’m not sure anyone said max damage build, but competent damage is needed and some prefixes that were decent last patch simply aren’t cutting it anymore because of the additive change.
---
I sell for 1k when I get them, others want 30k....go figure.
---
No, i mean the opposite! The only real viable build now for me atleast is automatic weapons
---
I'm getting this as well, normally after having played NW.
---
&gt; I am not receiving double rewards its just a super annoying visual glitch. 
---
totally agree, watching it go through each level every time I'm awarded score is getting old now.
---
Sounds like a nice toy. I have a Prime TS gatling plasma (I forget the 2nd star) that I take to deal with SBQ, but Earle just laughs at it. My prime AA (again I forget the other stars) gauss mini gun does a little more damage per shot on Earle but it’s main advantage is the high speed. Honestly my TSE Gatling Gun (named Gettysburg) does the highest damage per hit on Earle of any of my ranged weapons and it’s not converted to prime.
---
I do that a lot now. Its a shame, because i enjoy the combat. But is just not worth with how much ammo and durability I waste in a single mob, and cant do much else. Hopefully, they will balance things a little bit in the future, now that the damage calculations arent so extreme
---
Just start or join a daily ops team... then enter the daily op your team mates should turn up..
---
If you want to respec, you need those levels. You should always be stacking levels solely for that reason, after your build is finished. And 10k xp is not that much after the update, I got a decent bit of extra score today purely from that repeatable. 10k can be gained in no time if you stick to highly populated areas. Xp is important, you not wanting more xp doesn't make it not important lmao
---
Yea it seems I wasted 300 coins on Ammo Factory.  If I want to resupply my ammo I just run a daily ops for that weapon and I am good to go.
---
*paid for by bethesda*
---
I got all the damn xp needed by going to the no no red zone. Now the whole map is the red zone.  How is that fun anymore?
---
Yea that worked thx
---
&gt;on my low level alt
---
New payers do not have the experience of alts to draw on with their character. Just because a low level player might be able to get ammo easily doesnt mean they will be able to.
---
They nerfed the bows a few weeks ago. It used to be that you could release the arrow at any time, now you have to have a full pull to shoot, which makes it very frustrating when you dont pull all the way back, because it just resets and you have to charge again
---
That would be kick ass if the trick or treaters had cordinates for bowl like some of the random spawn missions
---
Upvoted for obscure reference!
---
I think it will be soon
---
You you know what I did? I specced into full heavy arms and rifleman both maxed out. I also play sneaky for the majority of the game, but otherwise when no other option is available, I switch into heavy guns and shred enemies. I recommend you do the same.
---
When a game centered around using guns mostly has an actual tip be "hey don't use guns until you've essentially leveled up to full normally" then there's a core fuckup somewhere in there.
---
I know its "Daily Ops" but is this an enduring event?  If it ends then maybe ammo factory might no be such a waste of coins.
---
I mainly rely on ballistic bock(20% damage), and blight soup(20% crit damage), small guns bobbles(20% damage), gun &amp; bullets mag #3(30% damage), and overdrive (15% crit damage). Stack all that before going into a fight, put on concentrated fire and aim for the head. The great thing about the beer and soup is that I can just hang out at my camp and craft the hell out of them when nothin is goin on.
---
It's still shit. For me, I think it's gotten worse.
---
Need a quest line that would let you find her and help her get the word across Appalachian BOS has taken over all broadcast and we need to restore a free Appalachian radio.
---
Just checked and sweetwater's special blend is still giving +12 perception.
---
Yeah? That sounds interesting. Thanks man. I’m level 63!
---
The made it so that you need to have a full draw to be able to loose an arrow. If you dont have a full draw, it just resets and you have to press the shoot button again. Bows are so obnoxious to use now
---
People actually use radio? Besides these necessary for quests like foundation property, I do not remember using them. Be it in Fo76, F4 or currently F:NW.
---
Like others have said, you probably need to upgrade your gear. 
---
The thing about the vast majority of these games, is the difficulty of an encounter, the design of it often factors in what the average player would be, in terms of gear. 
---
It's a stick and carrot game in away. The gear and weapons being the carrot and the difficulty being the stick.
---
Give it time and sorry to hear of your misfortune.
---
I think most of the "Too-Hard" comments are from people who prefer to build for Quality of Life and roleplay rather than combat.
---
You can probably spec for one weapon like bows or something and then spend a couple points on speccing into explosives, especially if you get an explosive legendary of that type you specced into. I run an auto grenade launcher and the only damage perks I run for it are demo expert and grenadier. I also run bear arms and ordnance express for carry weight. All in all, the damage perks are fairly cheap and I could further stack damage with bloody mess and adrenaline which will still affect other weapons, not just explosives.
---
Thats exactly what i was thinking of doing, but instead of rifleman, going melee, because rifles are too heavy imo. Anyways, thanks for the suggestion, Ill probably do it
---
I don't use automatics and I have no problems. Daily ops give me a little trouble but that is also because I'm solo. That resilient needing to be melee killed really caused me problems.
---
Are you on PC, and have mods installed?
---
No why would it? It has the exact performance it can provide. 
---
Using a SSD would be really beneficial,but at this point,jusy invest those money in a ps5
---
I like to think this was on purpose, like they knew we were getting beaucoup ammo from Daily Ops and wanted to add an alternative way for people who either don’t do them or still need more. But I essentially run What Rads, Take One for the Team, and the Combat Drug (which is funny bc I almost never use them outside of ACP- but like just in case I want a touch of extra resistance and strength)- once I get slot 4 in a couple levels I’ll grab the lockpick one and that’ll probably be it for me.
---
That is a dumb excuse too. Anyone can easily get ammo, refusing to do so is dumb as hell. It is so fucking easy to learn how to find lead and steel and making gunpowder is easy too. The means are available for everyone. Thanks to scaling, new players can leave the forest and go wherever they need to to find more of each resource, even though the forest already has plenty. That alone is enough, if you can't make ammo it is no one's fault but your own. Workshops also provide lots of these resources, hell, people don't take the ammo factory very much so it's wide open to almost anyone who wants it. The mutants scale to you so anyone can kill them and set up the ammo machine. If you don't have ammo, you're ignoring the means to get it that are right in front of your face, and I don't want to read post after post of you crying and bitching about it when it is so damn obvious.
---
I said it's flavour based on the fact that the bombs fell close to Halloween. Halloween decorations were up. Bethesda can't just change that for no reason.
---
2000 caps. 
---
And you sign a waiver to say you cannot take my to court for the degenerate filth that will spew forth form my mouth. 
---
And you need to pick a safe word in case it gets a bit too much for you.
---
Would suggest these youtubers- badcompanyasarg, captain noob and angry turtle they do some great work
---
Misfortune? Sorry if I sounded sarcastic in my post! Haha I had a ton of fun today and it made me remember how much fun I had during beta :)
---
Legendary strength will help you a lot in this regard.
---
My safeword will be pineapple. You’re hired.
---
Anything you wrote doesnt prove point that it is necessary. Only that it is convenient. Because if i have built set and i dont need bonus score, it is useless.
---
Xbox
---
I was wondering if anyone would get my reference. I'm a civilian employee for the Navy and most of my coworkers are retired military so I hear all the stories lol
---
Ill put you one down if you like ?
---
Anytime I hear her VA in general. I really dislike the VA. I'm sure she is nice but uuuuuugh that voice.
---
I did the same. I wish we could bottle the water from it.
---
I would also recommend heavys, no armour needed since you run in pa. Just a bit easier to set up imo and have many more viable weapons to mess with
---

There's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights, it works pretty well for me
---

Yummy plastic....*devouring a whole action figure in one bite*
---
My main problem is, I don’t go for quests and the like, I am technically a merc in game I help whoever pays me to do something. I usually help a lower level through the nuke silos for around 500 caps. And the problem with that is that for some reason I don’t get as much experience as Others do.
---
But that's the point I'm trying to get across, you don't need an optimal build. You just need the most basic, and to get a basic build requires little to no effort. For example; if you prefer rifles then you should unlock and max out your rifleman perk cards. If you want a little additional damage bonus then max out Bloody Mess and you're off to the races. Don't care for grinding legendary armor? No problem! You can get by with craftable Shadowed leather armor. You'll be practically invisible. You're not much for legendary weapons? That's fine! Grab yourself a non-legendary lever action or Fixer from player vendor machines for cheap or ask someone to craft you one if you don't have the plans. That right there is your basic build. You should be able to survive perfectly fine against enemies your level. Let's go even further; Imagine if you played a different RPG. You decide that the broadsword you found is pretty cool. You walk out of the player hub to roleplay and explore so you don't care for stats. You tell yourself "I'm just casual. It doesn't matter if I toss my skill points into magic." You get merked by your most basic enemies because that broadsword you thought was so cool doesn't do squat for damage. You jump on Reddit to complain and a fellow player informs you that because you didn't bother putting points for that weapon you're holding, that is the primary reason why you're having a hard time. No MATH or CALCULATIONS. Just logic. Same scenario here.
---
I really wish we could get monthly updated voice lines, would make it so much better, maybe even some new songs every now and then
---
You should have them at the Tinkers Workbench under quest
---
Thank you. I’m at work right now and I won’t get off for ten hours. I live in eastern US so I don’t know if that is totally different time then yours or not
---
Oh yeah that would be cool!
---
You keep saying that until one day you want to respec or change something about your build and can't because you "didn't want xp". I'm losing braincells just replying to you and your dumb logic at this point. Don't want xp? Don't do anything that gives xp, enjoy the game while doing nothing then. Not my problem.
---
Tried and nope
---
lol guns were a waste of time when compared to how good melee is  
---
sorry if I found melee to be way better than using guns. You can use guns if you want but I didn't have fun using them while I was leveling up
---
I think you're way off but go ahead and keep talking. Tell me more about how much this game is "fundamentally broken". It really sounds like you're talking out of your ass.
---
Won't change until 2021 so we seem to be stuck with it for the rest of 2020
---
I was being sarcastic...
---
There no point to being bloodied anymore. Especially in daily ops. One hit from A hound and you're dead
---
If the bowl is empty (and only the owner can check that) then you get a message to that effect. Same as with the Punch Bowl and NukaShine kegs and NukaCola Machine.
---
If youre on PC, from the launcher do a scan and repair of the game. This could take some time to complete and might fix your issue.
---
Your fucking mum is hired to suck my dick
---
But you do get 40mm, let's me go ham with my grenade launcher.
---
How do you use ultracite ammo? Do you need special weapons?
---
I was just being sarcastic lol. They(Bethesda) will crush your soul if you get to attached be fore warned.
---
I really don't get why they add new stuff in that can't be traded. Isn't that meant to be the main point of the game?
---
Demo expert is for my BE90 cal.50, my BE15 Gatling plasma and B3390 M79 when I go kaboom in PA ;). For stealth, I use Prime B2525 Fixer for solo bosses and B2590 Fixer for farming. If discovered I swap my fixer with B2590 LMG.
---
What sort of gun drop do you consider "good"? More guns are at least useful now, if specialized (Ghoul- and Mutant-slayer, for example), so unless you've not used any carry perks/armour mods, you could carry two or three. I carry an AA Fixer as my main, and a Furious Handmade as my secondary, with a Vampire's Flamer if it hits the fan and I need to live long enough to run away.
---
EDIT: trying to help, not troll.
---
In other words, you had to solve *this* situation in a **different way**. 
---
Sometimes the only tool that will work is the hammer, no matter how badly you want to avoid using it.
---
This was a HUGE worry for me! Also, won't armor break down quicker taking more damage from a now fucking lvl 50 mole rat?!?! I hate One Wasteland. The other updates, yes I love but OWL sucks.
---
Noob here. I always repaired my armour at the 50% mark instead of waiting until it breaks. Was that a waste if mats? Do i wait until it breaks?
---
Yeah. They weigh something like .0001 pounds
---
Follow through and Taking one for the team are very complementary with this versatile build and for stealth/discovered
---
It does have alot of fun stuff but the bugs, delays and mis-leading statements from Bethesda can really make you resentful over time if your as passionate as I once was. But have a blast and welcome.
---
You don’t need a build, but you should put a bit more effort in than one of the worst swords in the game. You can get a different legendary version of the chinese officer sword and just call it blade of bastet
---
Did...did you join public events with this? You just leeched off other people?
---
I like her a lot personally, call it blasphemous, but more than the new Vegas guy.  Oh and the diamond city guy
---
Can you see many people bothering by the end of the year? Once I have the rewards I'll stop personally and I can see many others doing the same
---
Still trade glitch I assume
---
would rather first fix the Underarmors so they add Endurance properly.
---
Hope you got a good drop
---
You're a wizard ... Vault dweller.
---
We now have lvl 50 mole rats and such where they were lvl one. This sucks
---
Daily score challenge, and legendary perks were not an issue before.  For the longest time, I could not have cared less about levelling.  And now I feel like these two things are trying to twist my arm into this new play style that I never cared for before.
---
In short, this is a paradigm shift, that will always cause friction.
---
Ive noticed the new daily ops, like many of fo76 quests lack quest markers. A work around ive been using in daily ops is I join an op, if there is no quest marker leave then rejoin one until it does show up. Hope this helps.
---
Ask a turtle : https://youtu.be/WW9clKZa8nA

That’s about right

up the escalator to the right and then left at top.
---
There is much point in running bloodied. I almost double my damage output on my heavy gunner. And I can still spam crits to infinity on my commando.
---
All the communists downvoting you
---
Ok if i was set on using your chosen armor and weapons, this is the build id use
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3365db&amp;d=s51ss2si1sg2se2sj1eh2c72i44ck0a72a81aj2ar2ao0a00l71lg2lt2lu2pe2&amp;m=0c9fe8h3
---
If you dont wanna change it that much, at a bare minumim. Use the strength perks ive laid out. Incisor, martial artist and blocker all rank 3 are a must. Only put 2 points into each  of the one hand damage.
---
Born survivor, lone wanderer and field surgeon work very well together to help keep you alive. 
---
You can skip ninja and the sneak perks if youndont sneak much, but take action boy so you can keep power attacking. 
---
The luck n perks help aswell. If you dont have mutations get some, richochet will help you alot vs enemies shooting at you.
---
I'm in agreement. I had originally hoped the Daily Op mode would change monthly and perhaps even rotate loot pools alongside game mode.
---
As soon as I've cleared this loot pool, I cant see myself continuing with it (other than for daily/weekly score)
---
Why would they fix that? You have lvl 50 mole rats now...even trade lol
---
Look at the menu under the perk card when it’s in your ‘bank’ (not equipped). There should be a button option. On XBox, it’s the ‘start’ button. The one with three horizontal lines (I think).
---
No, I take the workshop near my camp at Seneca Rocks.
---
Have you tried frag grenading the door?
---
Ah gotcha. Thanks!
---
I can sell them all day long for 15k. They never last more than 1 play session at that price. 10k would be considered average price though and anything below that you got a great deal.
---
\^ This. My main is a heavy gunn3r build, perks optimized for strength. My main tools are the AAE LMG and the Instig/Furious exp. prime 50 cal. Armor is regen/lifesaving/unyielding, marine chest and urban limbs. You can make use of strength for heavy gunn3r perks/lock and load/bull3t shield. Glow sight for perception. Radicool for endurance. Stabilized and nerd rage for intelligence. Adrenaline and action girl/boy for agility. and one g\*n army for luck. I use the T-65 when necessary but rarely need it.
---
I want someone to give a real, logical reason why they did this.
---
Check again under ‘Quest Items’ and then submit a ticket if it’s not there.
---
im going to get an gatling laser and check it later
---
&gt; I don't want to read post after post of you crying and bitching about it when it is so damn obvious.
---
Firstly, that's a pretty lame thing to right in reply to my only post on the topic which does neither of those things.
---
Secondly, I still think you are missing the point. New players are not borne with the knowledge of things you describe.
---
I'm a dick,I know, but didn't you look at the screen?
---
That one is in no loot-table, even the purveyor doesn't have it.
---
It's also (reportedly) only craftable as a 1* vamp.
---
I believe so.
---
I mean I'm kind of excited for Bomb drop event, I prefer original events over overused seasonal ones.
---
I think the issue is that Molerats and Liberators are now lethal
---
Shame fallout 3 has the weakest songs I mean their not terrible but none of them are really bangers their all like Johnny Guitar
---
Tried it still no
---
Personally I've switch to my aa fixer. Get to run full health with vanguard and barely any drop in damage. Just don't see the point in running low health for a tiny damage increase
---
So many of these posts around now, and my response is always the same:
---
There *still* are hardly any real threats.
---
It's just that the non-threatening mobs take several more bullets to get rid of.  It's not making anything more challenging (unless you're level 25 or so, apparently), but it's made most things *more tedious*.
---
I did it yesterday with my ultracite Gatling laser and got 4 ultracite fusion cores.
---
I have yet to see a rifle that isn't nocturnal.  I'd be happy with two shot, vampire, furious anything really... 
---
Most of my decent rolls have been Heavy Weapons which I absolutely do not enjoy playing.
---
&gt;	crush your soul
---
It’s a video game...
---
Get your perception over 55 and you can go to caution stage
---
I still one shot pretty much everything.
---
Submit a ticket. That’s an extremely rare glitch.
---
Or you could go back to Abbie’s Bunker and see if it can re-pop.
---
I had to engage couldn't  get past died ever time if not. Was easier.  And died less with out power armor.
---
They didn’t... they adjusted damage calculations across the board which now gives them the infrastructure to make balancing decisions more easily and more frequently.
---
I'm not sure that I would point to a collection of industries which are open in the worst pandemic response of any nation in the world as indicative of Bethesda being a bad company. As I said, last year wastelanders got bigger and undoubtedly they were over confident in their projections. Better to admit, postpone, and get content working. I played wastelanders beta. Trust me when I say it was good they decided not to rush it out to meet an arbitrary deadline. In terms of mischief night what I just said above sounds like correct argument. Sorry you disagree
---
That seems odd. Who/what is killing you?
---
I really hope Bethesda doesn't say "Its just a bug bruh" and disable the thing saying "it was not supposed to cure disease. Was just supposed to be cosmetic" that would enrage so many people.
---
Just said this in my fallout 76 group myself yesterday. Its an amazing idea.
---
They explained in multiple posts that the additive rather than multiplicative effects make it easier for them to balance weapons in the game. They didn’t nerf bloodied, they simply changed effects from being multiplicative to additive. It just so happened that bloodied to the hardest hit, because they were doing the most ridiculous damage
---
Yes it is still viable.
---
It’s not intuitive, but it’s the menu/start button on console.
---
Ah. Yeah, that'll do it. To get xp, you've got to have a good INT, and go out and do stuff.  Events, questlines, dailies.
---
As for perk configuration it's a matter of optimizing the perk cards that you want to use. Off the top of my head I want to say my points are distributed at 15/3/8/9/10/6/5
---
It’s rare for a reason I like the anticipation
---
I don't think so not before this update anyway it worked for me
---
Then do what I did when I was a new player and ask people. Look shit up. It is not hard to do. In the time all of these people crying that they can't get ammo posted, they could have just looked shit up instead. But they need someone to hold their hand and tell them it'll be ok until they quit because they have to actually find some resources and do something for themselves. And it's *write, not right. Being ignorant to shit isn't an excuse, as all of us were new and didn't know shit and managed to figure it out, because it isn't hard to figure out. Especially when having the means to post here shows you obviously can use google to look up ways to get ammo, or just ask for advice on here. But keep making excuses as that's all you seem to know how to do.
---
If I were Bethesda, I'd hire a real DJ to run the ingame radio.  
---
But I'm not Bethesda.
---
Not real life, the OP is talking about Fallout 76.
---
Anything really. My main problem seems to be those anti armor gutsies or asstrons. Even scorched seem to take a huge chunk out my health with sustainrd fire.
---
game was way too easy. WAYYYYYYY too easy. 
---
Still is kinda easy. hardest fight i've had so far was with 3 scorchbeasts. 1 3\* and a 2\*. I would have struggled before the update being a shotgunner as well though.
---
I think they call t a menu button (but who the heck knows). They will always be start and select to me
---
They’ve probably already completed it
---
I have 14 INT, but it’s only for hacking and crafting.
---
Was it that bad? No. Was it still obnoxious? Yes.
---
This game has been out how long? And they are now doing this?
---
The problem isn't solving situation in *different ways* (as I said, that's the point of RPGs).  
---
The problem is (and with Fallout is becoming more and more common) that there's only way to solve it. Only one way forward, the one the developers decided you had to take.  
---
In this case, they wanted some players with the right combination of skills to shine for the day. (so they said). Fair enough... I'll join the daily ops when my skills are adequate for the job.
---
What does the reactor do?
---
I see. Are you on PC? If so, look me up (Lamorak_2000), and I'll see what decent rolls I get that I can pass on.
---
Came across a lvl 30 legendary sb near riverside manor yesterday,  i am lvl 23, shot at it a few times with my anti armor hunting rifle. Totally useless, i couldn't even scratch its health so i ran away.
---
So the flamethrower could be legit. Energy weapons could roll explosive effect prior to patch 5, but it changes the flames to explosive bullets oddly.
---
Those .50cals I see daily now... those are definitely not legit.
---
I've not noticed too much difference honestly.  I've gained levels for sure, but I think that has more to do with ops than anything.  When you can just kill never ending waves of dudes all day long with a 2k chunk each run on top, that's faster that method we used to have.
---
Nope. PS4.
---
Weird.  Now the only weapon I'm using IS a shotgun.
---
Ok, I 'think' I get it now. Thank you!
---
There is just one tiny spot though I'm having some trouble with yet,
---
what is this "personal sense of satisfaction" thing? Seems new
---
Almost 2 years, and yes they are just now doing this. Just because your weapons are no longer doing 1000+ damage doesn’t mean the game is no longer playable. There are plenty of people who play with less than completely optimized builds
---
HA you can take WoW out of that argument...Tell me that game doesnt cater to casuals compared to its release with a strait face again. 
---
The game is carried by whoever spends the most money...a "hardcore" player is prob going to have the resources to NOT spend money, a casual that enjoys a game will prob spend that money to get those resources.
---
Most companies try to make a monetized game engaging enough for the top tier players and still approachable enough to keep the cash cows coming back.
---
I mean I see the point when some builds could shot everything in the game, I'm sure that got boring, HOWEVER that is NOT the case for every build out there...
---
like bows TOUGH SHIT GO BLOODIED
---
sneaky sniper...yeah you'll do ok..well you did, better group up now though...and forget bossing.
---
its whatever though keep pushing out the people that want to play a different way than you see how that works out.
---
FFS the easiest fix would be reasonable respeccing but that might hinder played metrics.
---
Hell I really like just scrapping and building, playing a stealth sniper with rifleman perks to well past 100 only to have to specialize into a junkie build and fish for specific perks just to not run out of ammo to kill a regular lvl50 sb BEFORE the change to STILL just be barely scratching a SBQ and have to just be on adds to feel like im making any difference...but was at least able to go anywhere non event and kill leggos. It's whatever though
---
Aye thanks lad
---
Well, the xp boost is passive. Just go out and do stuff. If you're on PC, look me up and I can take you around for an xp run.
---
It's gotta be bugging out on me then.  I quit and rejoined 4 times and no usable marker ever showed up.
---
That’s the lamest sarcasm I’ve seen all year. Go waste somebody else’s time, will ya? Maybe spend yours on ‘how to sarcasm’ lessons.
---
Nope I'm a console user.
---
Tried, he spawn as level 50
---
I run junkies melee and it's still viable so bloodied would be more so. You may want to make sure you invest in blocker, serendipity and dodgy though.

Well those things are a beast. For assaultrons, try some leather armor for the energy damage. I’m surprised scorched are giving you trouble but if they are high level I could see them packing a punch.
---
I’m on Xbox but I’ll be getting a PC on May 15, 2021
---
So am i lol, havent had to change my build up at all either. In fact the legendary perks make me stronger.
---
Ricochet and dodgy still works fine! Only if you’re finding yourself not tanky enough of course.
---
I did that on Steam, and nothing’s changed. It’s still crashing to desktop.
---
Really? Nobody ever wanted that weapon even when it was free, why should I want to use legendary modules to craft one?
---
Adding it to the drop pool was the only interesting thing about it.
---
I would love for you to search the sub Reddit to find everything that's already been posted about this
---
It depends on the person. I’ve bought three from a guy that was selling them for 5k each, one for each of my friends. I’ve sold the ones I’ve gotten for 6, 7, or 8 depending on how badly I need caps.
---
Bethesda is just so reactive rather than proactive when it comes to this game. Redoing numbers, I can get behind that, but this whole One Wasteland is dumb, I feel. People will be wasting more resources due to that. Instead if nerfing or recalculating as people are calling it, let's make Mutants or Berzerkers relevant.
---
Oh. Well, good luck! RNG can be a pain! They need to implement cross-platform play...
---
How do I submit a ticket. And I tried for the bunker nopw
---
I have friend.
---
I don't know… Maybe you should read one of the hundreds of other posts about this already
---
it's just ONE MISSION in the game that is harder for you to complete at the highest level so it doesn't make your build useless
---
Alright. I expect I'll still be playing then.
---
He could just has to do it on his own effing time;)
---
You are asking a lot there, my dude
---
What are you looking to get out of this game?
---
Your comment was a mistake
---
After 350 your Dr doesn't really matter
---
A good game. This game has went to junk since Wastelanders.
---
Thanks, this is super helpful.  I can say definitively I never saw this marker, and I even searched this exact room several times.  Do you have a screen grab of what the repeater looks like?  I'm thinking it had to be glitching out on me.
---
It wasn't bad for my two melee toons, but watching my stealth sniper reload his rifle in super slow mo was painful. And the more you get hit, the more it stacks. Hell, even using a stimpack was in slow motion.  Finally had to swap to my Fixer to get a decent rate if fire.
---
I don't make much of an effort to kill anything even at the boosters.  Not much point another one just replaces the one you kill.  Melee or one that has an annoying gun for sure, but otherwise, just kinda sit there and take the damage.    
---
Only one where it actually matters is the "lure out the boss" mission.  I was getting today's done in around 6:30 with a level 150 guy and a level 88 guy who both were good about staying by the beacon.
---
Bye
---
Even with bloodied losing like 90% of its damage with the nerf it still out damages every other build so yeah still good
---
I just make a role-playing group. Nobody ever joins it lmfao.
---
Gotcha. Some PC players often have a lot of game issues with the mods they install. Updates like this, which add new UI elements can often screw up those players with Mods. 
---
Well, don't have any suggestion to help you out.
---
Then stop playing?
---
They had to prioritize actions.  This game was supposed to be a survival lite game with players being the conflict with each other.  They expected people to team up and settle in workshops and defend them from other players.  That’s why we have such useless legendary affixes like assassins and perks that are all about sticking around camps, breaking down walls, and working as a team.  
---
The bulk of the player base bitched and moaned to that, so they had to prioritize changing things - and thus we got wastelanders.  Now that the game has settled down as predominately a cooperative PVE game, they have to create content that focuses on that.  In order to accomplish that, they need to make changes.  
---
With so many new players coming with game pass, they had to find a way to make it so newer players could jump into events with the existing players, hence the level scaling.  If they ever want to give us 4 or 5 star legendaries, or to keep adding new things, they need to get rid of the multiplicative damage because things like “take one for the team” multiplied over the existing damage would have just been silly. 
---
That’s standard online game development cycle, not one online game I can think of has not gone through a change like this. If changes like this bother you, you’re better off not playing online games (or at least not online games where you want the developers to keep making content for it)
---
I still pretty much one, maybe two shot everything in 76
---
Asbestos
---
You do but far less than what it takes to kill.
---
I feel you’re wilfully misinterpreting what I’ve written. My build is useless FOR the mission. It’s the mission I’m talking about after all. I could perform as well as I do now, with NO build at all. I’m not upset, I’m not angry, I’m just confused as to the purpose of the limitation. It has been explained that future daily ops will use different build constraints, it’s just the uplink nature of this event that negates the stealth element.
---
Yeap witch is why high levels are happy and low levels are mad.
---
At least when I look on the map flatwoods won't be covered by a mass of level 1-8 level players lol.
---
I'm at level 394 and got there mostly with a full health build, middling weapons like Executioners, Furious, etc., combat armor, and a suit of X-01. I run around with a handmade and when things get tough like bosses or bum rushing hordes I switch to X-01 and heavy weapons. Just before the patch I was dissatisfied with my damage on ACP so I switched to Junkies and got better results. Yet, with this middling build I love this patch. Anyway, just trying to say that you don't necessarily need to have a meta build and weapons to have fun with this game.
---
Yes she’s so annoying
---
Plot Twist: Fallout and GTA share universes. In FO3 Alistair Tenpenny is a descendant of Officer Tenpenny. And Madd Dogg became a Super Mutant.
---
They could add it as a S.C.O.R.E. reward, for example at something like ranks 5, 10, 25, 50, and 75. Similarly to how there are already reward items that were speculated in the past to be possibly sold for atoms, such as the ammo converter, lunchboxes, and perk card packs. And the ranks can be bought with atoms, so there is still potential for monetization indirectly, without too much "pay to win" outrage. A system like this would also limit how often the feature can be used, so people could not just respec multiple times a day.
---
I am not sure about technical limitations, but at the least it should be possible to receive 20 (or whatever amount of) "move a point" tokens at once, and use those with the already existing system.
---
Yeah and low levels
---
God no please.  I like this season because there are extra challenges so I don’t feel like I need to do nuclear winter. I don’t WANT to have to do them to get limited rewards I can’t get in the game.
---
Its not bad. Wasnt very excited but the damage balance makes it feel like I'm not a superhero anymore now I'm just a baddass
---
*Old School Gamers unite!*
---
Sneak doesn’t work like it used to at all. The enemies catch on right away. Unless you’ve got a bloody rifleman build, you’re very underpowered.
---
Use blocker and dodgy over barbarian and evasive. It's better to reduce damage than have a super high DR. Also can pick up serendipity and ricochet in the luck section for damage nullification too. Anything more than around 400 DR is a waste. You also need to look at the types of damage you're taking. High DR doesn't help against poison damage for example.
---
Having Jason Mewes and not using him as a radio host *SMDH* 
---
Instead we get sensitivity training class with Julie in a post apocalypse.
---
Yes, it’s viable.  My unarmed build is still killing nearly ever non-legendary/non-boss in 2-3 hits, 1 hit if I do a power attack.  This is not a bloodied build.
---
Cait won't be alive for another hundred years!
---
Fuck outta here with that negativity
---
Just how illiterate are you? No one was complaining about Deathclaws being Deathclaws, or god forbid, you took a waltz in the bog and stumbled upon Yogi Bear, but he ain't in the mood for your fucking picnic basket jokes. Majority of the issues fall upon...drum roll please!  
---
Trash mobs. You know what Trash mobs are? It's a common language in the RPG world, it's like a hiearchy, in this game, the trash mobs are usually  
---
\-Mole rats/rats  
---
\-bugs, even stingwings are considered more of mid tier trash.
---
\-Liberators
---
\-Scorched/Super Muties (arguably the highest of the trash mobs) 
---
\-Mirelurks/Mirelurk hunters
---
As  you can see, these mobs only had one goal: They're cannon fodder. They're meant to fill your screen or annoy you from the side, being a danger for lower levels, challenge for mid, and a nuisance for end builds that pay attention. It's a system that many RPGs follow to this day, and it works, because it gives a player a sense of progression and empowerment. This patch kind of fucked this up pretty royally by giving them all the same treatment of HP bloat.
---
Sorry for sounding dickish, but you're the one acting rude and jumping to conclusions without actually..reading, it seems like this thread was just for attention, hell, you got rewards, even! HMMM.
---
😎
---
It was dropping like 3-4 ultracite 50 cal round per mob for me, not enough to justify me stopping to pick it up, now we can make 900-1800 per craft
---
Prior to level 50 most of us were juggling several weapons both melee and firearm, usually not legendary unless we got lucky. Levels 1-50 have and will probably always be the players’ resource sink. Use what you have ammo for and I suppose craft ammo when you really like a weapon but haven’t leveled up too high for it to be underpowered. But in all honesty the melee guy was half right- using melee and investing in strength is definitely the easiest way to 50 in this game. some melee weapons are just stronger than some of the weapons youll find before 50. 
---
Bandolier, and collecting .45, .308, and 5.56 are typically good if you are going to use rifles prior to 50 bc combat rifles, assault rifles, and the hunting rifle all do okay damage and have ammo readily available after most fights.
---
This legendary perk system is.... legendary!
---
That’s exactly what they said about the state of the game Pre-Dupelanders. And they still didn’t do half the bug fixes they promised. No COVID then, so you can’t even blame that on their incompetence.
---
I have Blocker and it comes in handy but dodgy was eh a vats sink. Since I am a vats user draining ap for damage reduction wasnt worthwhile. I just got Funky Duds to get 100 poison damage and it seems to work fairly well at shielding me from Earl. I use Serendipity but seems only useful when low health anyways.  I run a junkies/bloodied hybrid.
---
Please don’t take away Mischief Night!! We all have been so looking forward to running through the streets causing mayhem and destruction to the White spring. It was a great even last year and man of us already have our camps decorated and ready to go. Please work on the bugs and get it straightened out... your fault dwelling wastelanders need this night of chaos!
---
Truly it is
---
They aren't damage sponges if you never took a break from the game and have good gear, or stop being a casual and join the meta. Sitting and complaining isn't going to change anything. Can't stop em join em, and it looks like that's your only option
---
I think at the very least spend an hour or two vendor hopping on multiple servers. There is lots of decent legendary armor for sale that will get you started and help you out a little bit. 
---
I took down my first SB with the Blade of Bastet after I had run out of ammo. I was running a casual build and it took me forever, but I still remember it fondly and have a picture of it on my roll.
---
Screaming like a sissy is accurate. I was building my camp near avr med center at around lvl 15 and saw a dark thing on the cliff. Curious, i took out my hunting rifle, snuck closer and i saw it was a mothman lvl 30 or so. The damn thing saw me, turned around super fast, its glowing red peekers starring right into my soul. I got so scared, i accidentally shot it, it then jumped and all i can remember is me running in the opposite direction screaming like a girl. I'm a 30 years old grown man...
---
Well it's probably because you are presenting a false pretense that people are asking for the wasteland to be harmless which isn't what like... anyone is saying.  Newbie areas SHOULD be newbie friendly, that's just plain common sense.  High end areas should be high end.  Right now it's not balanced that way, and there's not a "safe" place for newbies and casuals to hang out.  I think what people want is actual, sensible, progression balance.  This aint it.
---
The fast travel:  Great change.
---
Ops:  Great change (cept resilient bots, did no dig that experience)
---
Season two is a pretty big let down to me.  Don't care about anything but the greenhouse walls.  That's subjective of course, though the chems and nukashine along the path, come on now.  Appreciate the added weeklies for sure.
---
This patch likely ruined the ammo/chem economy, not sure what you are talking about.  It gave us a perk to make ammo crafting absurdly easy, and ops is a giant ammo/chem farm, and I get 2 stimpacks regularly on like fucking level 50 scorched.  I've been selling them t vendor bots because I get overloaded.
---
Rifle gaming did the fast time with just rolling pins yesterday, was quite amusing.
---
Same with holo tapes, I learned that the hard way.
---
I pretty much have, it's sad because I loved this game. I personally didn't like how the game has been directed. I just wanted to hear other peeps thoughts on this change.
---
A DR (or ER) equal to the damage dealt reduces the damage by 50%, anything beyond that is diminishing returns.  We also get less HP in general in this game than FO4. This is why Damage Reduction is more important,  Dodgy, Blocker, Ricochet, even armor types like Mutant Slayers or Troubleshooters will just flat out reduce the damage your taking and stacks with the 350 DR soft cap.
---
(Edit: and this was not changed with the patch, that’s how it was before the patch)
---
Are you on a laptop with switchable graphics or desktop with multiple GPUs? If so, in Windows 10, go to the desktop, select Screen Settings, scroll to the bottom for Graphics Settings, browse for Fallout76.exe and set it to high performance.

Aubrie's bitching again...
---
Yeppers! Mine are all decorated with last years decor
---
Before I was dealing upwards of 2k damage with a unoptimised bloodied build - there was no sense in actually experimenting with perks and consumables because I killed everything short of Earle and SBQ in a single hit. Now, whilst I barely deal half the damage I once did, my build is much more optimised and I'm having waaaay more fun exploring previosuly neglected game mechanics to add precious digits to my damage output. I am very happy with this update.
---
it’s a second helping, you never have as large a portion when you go back for seconds.
---
Lmao i love this format
---
Try playing a sneak character with all the guerilla perks maxed and sneak maxed. I can solo just about any mob now which was quiet difficult before the update. I'm enjoying it mostly. I do miss running through low level bot spawns for easy metals though.
---
So one annoying bug fix warrants the existence of over a hundred others, some of which are game breaking?
---
I love dropping nukes but hate running the silo so I just wait for someone else to do it
---
There’s only one way to solve the task because that’s the reality of the situation. Stealth isn’t always an option, depending on the objective. 
---
Sometimes you have to fight the dragon on top of the mountain. Sometimes you can’t sneak your way to victory. 
---
Improvise, Overcome &amp; Adapt.
---
Personally it's not so bad. My build was OP before. It's still super strong but there's at least an element of challenge. My bloodied commando is still pretty damn potent.
---
Feel for those who are struggling though..we all remember that difficulty curve when optimising our perks and getting the gear we want.
---
Maybe for us vets it's great but it seems to be lower levels who are struggling.
---
I've killed a scorchbeast with a chainsaw.  I love the chainsaw.
---
So next year it'll be 5 days long? And called double meat week?

I’m sorry, it’s intuitive there’s a big thing on PS4 “OPTIONS: Scrap Card”, i mean how much more obvious could it be?
---
I decided to finally finish roses quest because I've had her stupid syringer in my bag for like a year, so I went there to get a rad stag chunk.  Didn't die but man it's pretty demoralizing to be unable to kill wildlife in under 4 headshots, heh.
---
Get the recipe for sunshine oil. It's easy to make and it doesn't spoil. Balances out that ap drain. Also anything that boost your HP is better as well even when running low health.
---
76 is the 69 of the fallout games now
---
If ur a full health build, ur better off with “enemy type prefix” then a full vanguard setup. 
---
The 15% DR is better then vanguard scaling.
---
That and a crazy RNG system for perk cards. I went 50 levels without getting a single shotgun card for a character I wanted to specialize into shotguns.
---
You know you can get an autofire receiver for the handmade, right?
---
DR is not the road to tankiness. Damage reduction is. So instead of Barbarian use Blocker, which is orders of magnitude more useful against melee attacks. Use Dodgy instead of Evasive, unless you're a heavy VATS user and need your AP to kill things. Use Serendipity instead of Junk Shield (not sure if Ricochet is actually defensive. If so, use that).
---
Use one piece each of Troubleshooter's, Zealot's, Mutant Slayer's and Ghoul Slayer's armor instead of a set of Vanguard's. Use Unyielding instead of Bolstering. Have two pieces with poison resistance (or the legendary perk for that) so Mirelurk royalty doesn't kill you with their poison attacks.
---
If you want to be really tanky, get a set of armor that has Cavalier's, Sentinel's or Blocker as the 3rd \* effect (15% damage reduction when sprinting, standing still or blocking).
---
In situations where you know you'll encounter lots of Assaultrons and Colonel "no you don't have armor" Gutsies (Encryptid, Missile Silos, daily ops with robots), use a complete set of Troubleshooter's armor and laugh at their puny damage - armor penetration ignores DR but does not ignore damage reductions.
---
They still can’t fix my goddamn garage door!
---
Oh so demo expert works on explosive bullets?? I had no idea. I just got an explosive minigun the other day, so I may have to invest in that perk! I've never really used power armor either, but sounds like I may have to spend some time in it lol
---
Im a bloody PA build, its not so bad. A bit more of a challenge, but its a good welcoming challenge
---
Grahm doesn't work on Sundays
---
Yes I believe it should, it's just like regular perk cards except you spend a coin for unequipping
---
I love this as well. I encountered one in the bog today and after noticing how slowly her health would deplete I was like nope and sprinted away to reposition. It would make sense that a nearly two story high mutated crustacean would be an organic tank.
---
Did they buff it ?
---
I dropped a drill the other day and it was still lvl 20 so im wondering.
---
They're doing it because they know people won't pay attention to the announced schedule, and will then come on here and post anger and confusion. This will give me ample opportunities to post hilariously snarky comments.
---
Yes, they are just doing this now. From the beginning, they have said that Fallout 76 is part experiment in making MMOs and trying to go in a different direction. 
---
They have said that they are NOT married to anything, and that sometimes they will put things in the game that doesn't work and so are willing to take it out. Take the raid on vault 94. Bugged as hell. So they pulled it. Probably not worth the time to try and fix the mechanics. But certainly the environment can be used for something else. 
---
So the game is always going to be changing. Which means, so will your character.
---
I did ops twice last night worh 2 others.  First time for me. We missed elder by a few seconds 1st time, nailed it easy 2nd time. It was kinda fun but I can see it getting boring quickly.
---
Damage resistance is second to damage reduction.
---
&gt; I can see why they're pretty much a dead brand
---
Nokia, the brand, hasn't been "dead" for a while now. After what Microsoft did to Nokia, the company, with Stephen Elop, and then ran the Nokia brand to the ground by failing to understand the mobile phone market (that's Microsoft for you, they tend to fail when they've got competition), the brand was resurrected by HMD Global back here in Finland, and since they launched their new smartphones in 2017, they've been doing fine.
---
Look into the [Nokia 8.3 5G](https://www.nokia.com/phones/en_int/nokia-8-3-5g), it looks pretty damn nifty.
---
Yes, just keep in mind it cost 1 perk coin to remove them.
---
While It's been basically fine for me personally, and I like some parts of it, though I lament the plight of the lower leveled and unoptimized, I really don't get the whole "I can explore the map again!" that I keep hearing over and over.  Why?  There's nothing new there except monsters that take a few more bullets and give you 100 xp rather than 50.    
---
I was always going all over the map before this change, and I've seen no incentive to go anywhere without reason, like an event or a good scrap farm which is just as it was before.    
---
Shrug
---
Wait what?  You’re telling me I have 40 pounds of holotapes in my stash?
---
Mr. New Vegas and red eye were the best.mr. New Vegas just sounded like the smoothest motherfucker on earth. It succs we never got to actually see him. And red eye was just cool. I loved all the stories because they made it fell like u were reading the Illiad or somn lol. Shame we never met him either.
---
great.  now start a new character and get to 50;  tell me how much more "enjoyable" it is
---
I want a talk show with Grahm and Chally.
---
(needle scratches on record)
---
Hello hoomans, dis is Grahm and Chally, wit Grahm and Chally in da morning. Iz hope you all is ready for meat cook next week. (mooo). That right chally, it gonna be best meat cook ever. And now back to your reg-u-lar singy noises.
---
Only thing I’ve changed on my unarmed bloodied melee is I swapped out martial artist for incisor.  
---
PA 1 shots most things.  2-3 swings at the most on lvl 100.  No biggie.
---
I mean, sure, it takes longer to kill a scorch beast or cryptid or deathclaw, but it's still perfectly doable.  Certainly not worried when I see one.  
---
And why is it fun to fight level 50 scorched at the airport instead of level 5?  I don't have any interest in fighting either, and I certainly don't feel that higher level mobs makes me want to "explore the map again" any more than I usually did.  Why would it?
---
Happened to me first time last night. I exited out and came back and got the marker on second go. Got to the last mob and got down to 5fps and blue screened. Vault 94 is the only daily ops I was able to complete without crashing or it being bugged out. Also on PS4.
---
Ricochet negates all damage of the attack when it procs, so yes it's defensive.
---
Aw I’m one of people to which Mischief Night was their favourite seasonal event. All well next year it is then.
---
Lucky Hole Mine, here we come!
---
I was already primarily using a Handmade with the fastest possible semiautomatic receiver for anything but true long-range shots.  Now on automatic, I fire in bursts, so the difference isn’t all that much as far as what I’m doing, but the recoil is hard to get used to.  
---
A couple of things I’ve noticed:  I do think I’m doing noticeably higher DPS.  Unfortunately, I know the VATS bug is hitting me more often - the first shot almost *never* procs a hit at 95%.
---
Is there an app version of the build planner? I would like to save my builds without them resetting.
---
South Korea, where it's almost criminal to be stupid.
---
Alright, that settles it. I haven’t actually killed anything save a deathclaw that was a ‘boss’ enemy this update, and I think it’s high time I finally do it.
---
I did this and the game still keeps crashing straight to desktop.
---
it's not been missed out, but angry people are usually more active.
---
So far, fully buffed for xp, a super mutant lvl 100 gives \~800xp, it's huge !
---
this -somehow- solve a part of the issue for high levels character having hard time to continue to gain levels
---
I believe at one point the furniture set was a sep thing in the store so it was clear what it was referring to. 
---
Regardless, a door is not furniture so OP buying furniture and expecting to get a door is their own fault.
---
Dupers
---
I'll believe that when I see it.  Endless adds are pretty bog standard for mmo bosses.
---
I see your point, pal, but I think you don't see mine... or I'm not explaining myself properly.  
---
In RPGs there should be more than a single way to face the situation... (and I'm aware Fo76 is more an MMO than anything else).  
---
With each Daily Ops there's only one, and they did that on purpose.  
---
How's that gonna play? We'll see what happens when they create a Daily Ops where a PA or a Heavy Gunner is useless...
---
No, but you can save links to your builds
---
Wait, there are no legendaries in daily ops
---
AND I WILL NOT JOIN THE BLOODIED SIDE... can i have some cookies tho?
---
Sorry was driving from 1 job to the next.
---
No. Meat week is available to play over 7 days. When something is a week long it means it has to be available to access on 7 days consecutive. Not a full seven 24 hour periods. 
---
That is literally how the whole world works in terms of something being a week long. It's nothing new. 
---
Count the days out. There's seven. Most people make the mistake of subtracting the low number from the high one, which gives you 6 days.
---
But that means you aren't counting the first day. 
---
So you will be able to participate in meat week on these days:
---
22  
---
23  
---
24  
---
25  
---
26  
---
27  
---
28. Count them up. 7 days. That's a week. That's normal and again, that's typical of the world since forever. No where did they say, Meat 168 Hours event!
---
Good luck in a WoW group dungeon without your basic build for that role. You'll be dumped instantaneously. You don't need break out your calculator or figure out that damage formula in order to determine what cards need to be where. You mentioned Stealth Rifleman. You don't care to spend all your time arranging your perks? Fine! Just max out all 3 Rifleman perks, toss in a Bloody Mess and there you go. Presto! Off to the wasteland you go. Having an issue sneaking around and find yourself dying often? No problem! Craft yourself a full set of Shadowed Leather armor (Escape Artist and any stealth card optional). Boom! Keep your distance, move around and you'll be bagging these level 50 baddies easy. It's really not that hard.
---
dispenses bath water from your favorite raider pipboy-girls.
---
Oh, for sure.  I just need to build up enough flux to not get caught in a pickle.
---
I look forward to all the snark!
---
What was teh respawn issue?
---
Enemies scale with your level but the enemy prefix makes then harder or easier. You will have basic ghouls at your level and then you might run Into bloated or charred ones which are tougher and then you get into glowing and bloated ect. The level just determines the level of loot they drop and base health and stuff like that.
---
It shouldn't matter all that much though, it's unlimited enemies so there's plenty of XP to go around. Plus, the real goal is to **finish the objectives** as fast as possible, so I'm personally not gonna care if my teammates one shot everything.
---
As long as they stand in the damn booster zone while they do it
---
It has many different spearheads depending on the mod you give it, some are cooler than others.
---
Except sneak commando won’t need your filthy help and solo all of it, so your point and your post are moot
---
I don’t think so...  am I screwed?
---
Do people really dislike Nuclear Winter that much? Its just a fun change of pace for me. I use it to break up the long Adventure sessions. I dont really take it seriously but I would like some cool stuff for my effort.  Thats all...
---
Agreed. While I dont mind having an incentive to play Nuclear Winter, having to grind limited time rewards from the mode WHILE ALSO grinding for seasonal rewards is just too much.
---
How often do you actually see people walking around in those $18 suits of power armor? 
---
I almost never see them ever
---
One minor correction. I don't think the word soon should ever be used in reference to future Fallout 76 content.
---
Seems like a real no brainer, and I'm not sure how they missed it.
---
Never make decisions late at night, this has cost me before😀
---
Is it just me or is headshot damage broken?
---
I got the sypmto matic on first day and the mask on second so your mileage may vary
---
Exactly. For an update that was supposed to make the game more dynamic, it is actually just highly restricted the variety of ways in which you can engage with this game.
---
The giant pompadour wig would need to be lootable so I could build a camp under it.
---
Yup \^\^
---
Poison seems to do me in..bloodied
---
It's all good, I understand. Future reference, eh? Your phone should understand "period", "comma", etc, and put in the necessary punctuation. Unless it doesn't, and places the word instead. My windows phone did that...
---
Anyway, how do you find time to play, with two jobs!? Lol.
---
I wear my chinese stealth suit under power armor. It's rad resistance should at least stack. I take less rads OUT of my power armor than while inside it.
---
The bloodeagles yesterday must've had taco bell. They kept exploding.
---
... Yeah.
---
Might be able to find someone to trade with.
---
I also use a stealth build, so I'll show you how it looks from my point of view
---
I like the fact that we can prove ourselves in a variety of circumstances, not just those that allow us to make the most of our perks. It seems realistic to me, we specialize in some skills, we are not superheroes, everyone has their weaknesses. 
---
Besides, there are probably two stealth perks, what about the rest? Perks that increase your endurance or weapon damage? They still apply. So it's not like you have to change the build, you're just a little weaker.
---
Last year it was Aug 1-8 and Sept 26 - October 3
---
A full 7 24 hour periods both times.
---
So why has this year gone from 7 to 6?
---
Lmaaaaoooooo
---
There's nothing about ANY door in the description, so why would someone expect to get a door at all? All you have to do is read the description. If you just look at the pics and just assume you get everything in the pics, that's your own fault. I personally don't think this is Bethesda trying to fuck with a player's head I think it's an issue of players not using their brain or common sense.
---
That is the worst business/game development plan I've ever heard. Throw buggy shit in, which they KNOW is buggy and glitched, and let us suffer.
---
I recommend funky duds the legendary perk. Grants 50-200 poison resistance if you wear a matching set.  Works in power armor too.
---
I do run that. mine must be busted or I'm too stupid i guess.
---
You mean the same dupers who have consistently found ways to trade 'untradeable' stuff? I just find it extremely annoying when I have something perfect for a friend and they have something perfect for me and we either have to drop and destroy it or scrip it
---
It does. Just less. 
---
It’s called diminishing return. It’s not a full stop hard wall.
---
8-10k is normal price range.
---
I got a rare plan for a caged light bulb. Smeh
---
People on here complaining that some creatures are bullet sponge so they get mad, even when there is that lovely perk card. Don't know why they mad if they can get more ammo now.
---
Love moments like this.
---
As a shotgun-primary player, this is absolutely correct. Use VATS all the time or you're just wasting shells.
---
You need to mod a Prime Receiver on your weapon. Then it will fire Ultracite, and only Ultracite, ammo.
---
I might just do that. Have 4 slots and so far I'm only using the extra damage when attacked in a team and the PA recharge
---
w8 w0t
---
Exactly that. With 5 characters it won't take me long to get all the rewards. I'm not sure I'll  even bother doing it for the score myself lol
---
There is a cover system in FO4? I'm only aware of a mod that adds this.
---
Yeah, it's still dealing more damage than most gun builds.
---
Best radio host is Red Eye.
---
Hey asshole, you’re listening to Raider Radio
---
Yeah. It was at least 
---
Maybe they removed it for this?
---
Not bad at all
---
I agree.  There's really zero reason to NOT be in a public group, and every reason to be in one.  I play solo but I always join a group because it greatly effects perks, and mutations as well as the bonuses they offer.
---
Yep i agree it's annoying as hell. It's still the mass duping that has led us to this point though.
---
The gutter is an assaultron blade 
---
Where do you get candy cane?
---
I dont think youd need 200 PR. I ranked it up to 100 and can survive Earls sludge for a while before the Wendigos swarm me. I havent ranked Sizzling Style yet which grants fire resistance but idk if its needed when Fireproof exists.
---
Ah very nice, I approve.
---
Compared to beta, it’s a lot better on the bug front. Although I have to admit, I miss the scorched t-posing to show dominance lol
---
But what’s the point when experience doesn’t really mean anything now that everything scales up to your level. There’s little point in leveling As a confers no real advantage in the game.
---
It could be a "secret service pistol" or something like that since it's often used with a suppressor and the secret service would probably use it
---
With Suppressor Perk (from Charisma) Follow Through almost never works, without it always works but it's still delayed.
---
Ive seen it, bear wins 
---
Or it did before the update so who knows now
---
Pc player here. 
---
I joined an ops team of 3. I was a bit late and after 30 seconds I got elder finished. 
---
I was pretty happy about that... so I checked my inventory what legendary I got. Nothing special.... 
---
then the message popped up that ops started... sure why not... second run.... finished in about 5-6 minutes... 
---
this ended up with about 10-15 runs all with the same team and all finished between 5-6 minutes.
---
For sure dude that lore is fitting i like it
---
We only need XP because they added the daily level challenge and the repeatable XP challenge. And most people have been creating new toons EVERY DAY and then deleting them to get the level challenge. Talk about a waste of fucking time.
---
That sounds like work and work is no fun..
---
I run bloodied and barely die still. Before and after the patch. Always surprises me. 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
I had like 30 because I keep shit. Drop them and find out. You can always pick them up if I’m wrong.
---
Just wish when you wore the hood it didn't show your neck
---
It only took someone sending todd a box of them with a message saying weigh these.
---
They mentioned that they were bringing the ammo converter to bullion vendors, i think it was in the patch notes. And yeah you gotta hit max rank with raiders for the ammo machine.
---
Scattershot (under strength) reduces shotgun weight 90% and gives 30% faster reloads as a bonus (when maxed).
---
I think Julie is freaking awesome, fight me
---
Edit: autocorrect wants her to be Julia too
---
Something's going on there. PC or console?
---
I know what your point is. You believe that all tasks in video games should have multiple approaches that can solve the problem. Brute Force *or* Stealth *or* Diplomacy, for example. 
---
- **[Strength 8+]** Bash Down the Locked Door. 
---
- **[Agility 7+]** Sneak to the Door and Pick the Lock. 
---
- **[Charisma 9+]** Persuade the Guard to give you the key in exchange for a ‘favor later on’.
---
- **[Bribe: 250 caps]** Pay off the Guard to unlock the door and go take a Nuka-Cola break.
---
- Exit
---
However, I disagree. While in general it is good to have multiple options to resolution, that isn’t always the case. Just as variety in available options is good, so is a variety of situations.
---
Stealth isn’t always the answer. Deception isn’t always the answer.
---
Use those options when you can if that’s your ‘comfort zone’. But expecting your preferred method to always work or always be viable is unrealistic.
---
I Agree I mostly do it with a full team with communication so I'm sorry when I say I've never experienced this.
---
I think their billions of dollars would say that your view of it being the worst business/game development plan means you might be the one who's wrong. 
---
And I'm guessing you didn't know any of this before getting into the game. 
---
But I didn't mention anything about throwing in buggy shit knowingly. This change hasn't anything to do with bugs. It has to do with the life of the game. Which means, if they are redirecting the game on this level, it means they are looking to keep the game going.
---
I does look cool but I'm more an enclave fan
---
If it came with a enclave badge and was a bit darker I'd be all over it lol
---
Update: I restarted my computer after doing this and everything works fine. Thanks for the help!
---
Thanks for the help, everything’s working now.
---
You could try to (re)move all the ini files from the install folder and the documents/my games/FO76 folder somewhere else and then let the game regenerate them at next start, maybe something went wrong with them. Using the event viewer from windows might be worth a try as well, maybe you can find a reason in the error message (if one generated).
---
Idk. All my legacies seem fine. Probably just something you perceive to be different
---
One at a time
---
I still cannot get under 8 mins, it somehow takes like 8:30 every time even shortcutting with jetpack.
---
Yeah it can, there's a post showing one a few posts down (when I posted this awyway heh)
---
I thought that was hilarious when he told that story.
---
Gutsies don’t give a fuck about ur armor.  
---
They eat right through armor.
---
You could keep using it and get +100 str
---
This entire post has no purpose lol.
---
Well, let’s start with I only have so much time in in a day for playing.  1-2 hours tops.  Trying to get into and actually do well in a NW match is going to take at least 20 of those minutes out of a play session.  Even just going all bush wookie, it’s 20 minutes of time where I periodically move from bush to bush.  Going down quickly just wastes play time as I now have to exit, re-queue up, and wait for a match to start. 
---
Second, the standard rewards that carry over from NW to Adventure (experience and caps) is not substantial. I could have earned more of both in the time I was in there.  
---
Then there’s the whole way you progress and build your character in NW, it’s based off your special in adventure, but by and large, even with the ability to now buy cards in NW, it’s random.  And I just happened to start with a. Character who has SPECIAL that doesn’t allow me to slot great cards.  
---
So it’s a game mode that cuts into progression in adventure mode and overall daily play time.  Is not designed in a way that high STR character performs as well, since what worked well as SPECIAL in adventure doesn’t necessarily translate to NW (especially if you don’t have the cards).  
---
The only reason to play NW has been the cosmetics you can use in adventure, and I’ve hit rank 33 and made peace with myself that I won’t get those rewards anytime soon, but at least they aren’t limited.  
---
Finally, if I want to play a PVP game, I’ll play a game that was designed from the ground up as a PVP game, not a game mode that has been tacked onto a game that already had bad PVP to begin with.
---
Lol, this should be rather like some sort of Auto-Doc
---
Exploit for strength. Because bethesda didn't test it before they released it to the public.
---
Nah it wasn't meant to
---
I'm cant remember if I've asked this here or have been searching the internet, but what triggers the Lone Wander Perk Card? Joining any kind of team, proximity to other players, or both? Ive been using Lone Wander so I'm probably going to have to move some perks around and reassign some special points.
---
I mean ya just a disease cure
---
Fuck the Mothman, 
---
ALL HAIL THE SKY WORKBENCH
---
Just wish I didn't have to leave my pa to use it
---
That's what I've been trying to tell everyone but they never listen
---
I'm overall happy with the update, my concern is the drastic increase on frequency in the health rebounding bug. Its way more rampant with shotguns than it was before and seems to happen with all my fast fire rate guns now.
---
For me, it's the gain in 'game experience'. Now I can ignore Cranberry Bog and play the game in the much better areas with a wider variety of enemies and places when before an endgame player had like a fifth of the whole map as a ground with meaningful adversaries.
---
NO. Ive received 2 of these..... sold one for 20k caps and traded the other for a real nice weapon ive wanted for a long time.
---
Even after the damage nerf you should eventually get to a point where your spec gear and experience make the game much, much easier.
---
You just said they "will put in things that doesn't work and so are will to take it out" that is them knowing the shit is bugged. They have PTS (which are shit) and they have to know shit is bugged. They are willing to turn an eye in sake of putting something out.
---
Horses are extinct???!
---
Hold up. The physical damage goes down, but you get the damage and more back as a different type. In particular, cryo and fire damage tend to have lower resistances on everything as compared to energy and normal, so at the very least they could do better in some instances that a purely physical damage weapon.
---
However - if it truly isn’t in the pool, yeah, it really should be.
---
It did way too much damage, and while I don't like this overall nerf there absolutly were affixes and weapons that needed nerfing and bloodied was the prime culprit.
---
No, it’s still there. The ops version is craftable and has a unique skin.
---
Cover is a thing on fo4? Thought it is duck and strafe only?
---
Yeah PS4 F4 player here, I don't remember ever having a cover system...
---
I’m saying it’s not intuitive because that button is never used for an **action** in any game that I can think of besides pulling up a menu/map. 
---
No one would “intuitively” think to press that button to perform an action. You may say that it is clearly marked on the screen. But no.. it is not “intuitive”. It is not a thing that one knows or considers from instinctive feeling (Oxford dictionary).
---
It's a second helping but this time the enemies are scaled to you, going to be fun primal cut events that's for sure lol
---
The new, craft able variant of the weapon has a gaudy yellow and red skin, hence calling it a candy cane.
---
6 days is enough
---
It just makes me not bother with any of the new stuff personally. I've o ly gone for the SS armour from wastelanders and I haven't even crafted any yet. Don't wana waste the scrip on modules just to get trash that I can't trade. There's gotta be a better way around it. Or test each update to make sure there's no old dupes resurfacing lol
---
You can still find jes2r at Freddy fears
---
Unique skin? 
---
Is it noticeably different? 
---
I collect swords but I'm not so sure I need 2 of the things
---
I do appreciate your comments. I read yer post you did about why you like the change. Maybe I'll give it a try. Maybe NOW I will have a reason to play my team medic lol.
---
I was wondering this myself just changed my camp around placed and can't use it yeay
---
Honestly? If it stopped at 90%, I could see this.
---
Sounds like fun
---
I completed it twice last night with a 1* vamps gauss shotty testing specs gear and weapons.  Only problem I had was some expected rubber banding of health bars. May want to reboot bro.
---
As a full HP unarmed off meta build im not having much trouble. 
---
Only thing that's killing me now is mirelurk queens but a single stimpack will heal me enough to kill it.
---
The map’s not that big though, ESO has a big map, this is one zone...
---
Put the backpack on the power armor frame
---
Just not being in a group, if you join one you stop getting the lone wanderer bonuses.  You can be physically close to others in game no issues.  :)
---
Yep. We are almost 2 years in and weapons like Laser and Plasma Rifles (with the beam splitter applied) still break extremely fast for no reason while also still being considered inferior to ballistic weapons, non-automatic weapons (rifleman builds) are still quite bad when compared to automatic weapons (commando builds), weapons with supposed "high base damage" (hunting rifle, double barrel, gauss rifle) are quite bad as the higher damage doesn’t seem to make up for the drawbacks of having small magazine and/or slow reload and pistols are barely even used. 
---
Then there are also weapons like the Cryolator and The Dragon which not only break extremely fast for no reason but also don’t even have a prime receiver to boost damage.
---
free disease cures for would be customers. you want sickies touching all your stuff?
---
Why does she refuse to play public?
---
Just found it...
---
Emphasizing Stealth and Sniper builds in future Daily Ops after severely nerfing them with patch 22. Unless they buff weapons and builds back up I don't see how it's going to work for the players (like myself) that use both of those aspects.
---
It's not bad.  But to me, a lot of the pouches and the vest are too big for the actual outfit itself.
---
You could use it endlessly for an unlimited stacking STR buff, that's why.
---
Hard pass
---
They’re supposed to lose range with the nozzles, that’s why they give so much extra damage
---
It's sad to see someone writing that he thinks he is a good player. Then the rest of the people that do not think like you do are bad people right? Let me tell you that what it makes it count it's not your own opinion about how things work. Everyones opinion matters here and you should respect it at any cost. I personally like one-shooting everything ingame no matter the strength, but I do think that this damage nerf has been a massive hit for a certain in-game lifestyle (me included) because I do so (well I used to one-shot everything before patch 22). I want to add that we may have chosen to one-shoot everything because it's the way it works and we need to kill enemies to survive in the same way you do. It's not our problem that someone loses a kill for someone who has a one-shot build. Improve and adapt, make yourself stronger.
---
Given that I listen to Appalachia Radio for hours on end, any change in Julie's dialog would be a blessing. It would be nice to have her responding to what's going on in Appalachia. I also think we should be able to...
---
1) Visit the radio station  
---
2) Be able to give Julie a Nuka Cola  
---
3) and get MORE SONGS\* ADDED!!!! 
---
\*I know it's a license issue, but a few more songs wouldn't hurt...would it? LOL
---
My favorite was one of the enemies spawning inside the wall. So you can't get the boss to spawn.
---
I should have exempted new players. The grind from 25-50 has always been tough and it’s probably almost as bad as it was when the game first came out (at least you don’t have to deal with the original scorchbeasts). 
---
Join events teams and just hop into events with high level players for XP. Don’t even worry about killing stuff just get your hits in. Also learn how to make Cranberry Relish to get an extra boost for XP. 
---
And if you die or your stuff breaks don’t worry. There’s no real penalty for dying; you just drop your junk. And literally all your gear that’s lower than max level is just trash anyway once you’re level 50. Don’t bother repairing your armor. Just scrap broken pieces and build new ones. It’s cheaper until you have the appropriate crafting perks.
---
This. 
---
I’ve wanted stuff like this for awhile, like being able to wear my silly mothman glasses over a gas mask for example
---
Pretty sure theres an achievement here
---
What I wanted from the start of the game back in 2018 was for a Protectron Radio host commenting on the game's action (Of course I would have changed Appalachia Radio to Responders Radio and have the Protectron be a Responder Bot similar to Fluffy) , and yes this could be individualized (I think, I'm not a game developer, obviously) with cues sent to the person's console or PC to offer comment on what that player just did if it were big enough.
---
All that being said, I don't mind the human DJ but yes, God yes, give her more dialogue!
---
Best result I had was 6 minutes and 45 seconds with the exploding Blood Eagles daily ops.
---
Dude, it isn't as complicated as you think. For one, the radio is already synced for everyone on the same server. All it really takes is for the game to send an interrupt to the next song in the queue for "special announcements" based on the Public Event or Nuke, which for some events you get a pushed alert with audio already. It wouldn't cost anything more than the recording costs and some time on the programming side. And really doesn't take much to time the voice clips, as it's not live radio, but instead audio files. "Start *Countryroads.mp5*, if public event starting play *specialalert.mp5*" kind of stuff.
---
And yes, my programming is bad, I haven't had coffee yet and haven't written code in years, just an example.
---
Prob around same as last season. I’m sure there will be ways to catch up like last season as well.
---
Power armor doesn't have that many benefits considering you have a jetpack for armor now. Adamantium skeleton, bird bones and marsupial. Don't forget goat legs on there as well and you'll never need power armor
---
Yes, I'm aware of what it is. I get candy cane from right [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi7vCS5OZW4)
---
Agreed - i got so fed up with it last season i just created one shot toons to restart and get the level every day. Delete, rinse, repeat. This keeps me on my main and still enjoying it.
---
Daily Ops are definitely a complete package of fun, i'm around 280 and with basic some XP boosts like well rested and canned meat i can easily get 1/3 to a 1/2 a level on a good run.
---
A lot of the songs in new vegas were recorded pretty recently so I doubt they’d add them. Plus none of that stuff fits the theme of the game, the only reason they were in new vegas because it was out west
---
No, it's still only level 20.  It does only tiny damage, but does it consecutively so you can see the health bar steadily going down.
---
I'm pretty casual so I'm not sure what's all going on there.  My kid has a very melee oriented build and though only half my level does way more damage with theirs.  Both of us have the flaming and long bar mods, iirc.
---
Enemies in areas like the Forest are easier, the ghouls there even say “Weak Ghoul”, and they are easier to kill than say the ghouls you encounter in the mire.  Those ghouls have other prefixes adding additional abilities like diseases. 
---
This isn’t intended to be like a JRPG where you can just grind all day on low level enemies until you steamroll the next enemy, it’s more like a traditional RPG where you are constantly facing enemies of appropriate difficulty, but getting new abilities, so while you don’t have to min/max, as long as you make logical choices you’ll still be a point you are better than them, and eventually, if you really push it, can make everything a cake walk.
---
Wasn't there something like this last season
---
People where using it to gain some seriously sick gains, bethesda disliked it and took away their protein powder and locked the bench
---
Technically you wear a bodysuit in there. So you're comfortable just naked when you get out
---
idk man, honestly I'm level 85 and I don't really care about XP anymore.
---
Money
---
If line in the sand pops up I can get 3 levels if I pop 4 lunch box's and a can of stew
---
I’m sure it’s possible. They’d just have to reclassify it as just a hat so eyes and mouth stuff is still open.
---
I think since most people were able to finish with plenty of time, and realized we don’t have to do every daily every day, and this season gives us even more, people didn’t think it was worth it.
---
Heh well you answered my question so thanks!
---
&gt;However, I disagree. While in general it is good to have multiple options to resolution, that isn’t always the case. Just as variety in available options is good, so is a variety of situations.
---
Maybe the problem is I've seen this one-way approach too much in Fo76 and the Daily Ops have been the straw that broke the camel's back.  
---
Why not splitting the Ops in two teams? One in favor of the BoS returning, another against? Or one favoring PA builds and the other sneaky or whatever? I get why they did it... I just don't agree with it...
---
In Path Of Exile there is literally an item you can buy in an NPC with in-game currency to respec 1 point in your build, yet, they give you a free reset even if a comma changes in the skill tree.
---
Enclave here why isn't your video feed working?
---
-the video feed was showing egirls- oh that explains it.
---
I don't think "perk screen" and "quickly understand" have any right to be in the same sentence - my god that UI/UX is brutal. Whoever designed that should feel shame, crushing shame.
---
it's clear 🤷🏻‍♂️ you are an enclave player 😁
---
I believe that The workshop mechanics overide pacifist mode.
---
Yep. I primarly have rifles and heavy weapons (so my perk cards are for those), but I carry about 10 weapons on me, which I switch between depending on situation. Recently aquired a powerfist which I use for trash mobs (saving ammo, and it's a bit of fun smacking things in the face).
---
Do you realize that with perks and normal armor you have more DR than power armor. Hell even a god roll suit of combat armor outclasses power armor. Power armor should get legendary just so it gets it's reputation as best armor in the world back
---
Yeah you're on the money there, I got 6 cards maxxed on release and am level 750 - I have 44 unopened perk packs, 400 unused level ups and pretty much every card already. Took Taking one for the team, Funky duds and 4 x SPECIAL and its made a real difference to my playstyle...
---
Really? do you don't like the outfit or the bos?
---
I wish we retained certain armor mods when getting into power armor, at least the pocketed/deep pocketed ones, or the ones that lower certain item weights by 20%. It sucks getting into power armor and suddenly being 30-50 pounds overencumbered. I got so tired of it I eventually took all of those armor pieces off
---
Yeah that would be nice
---
This wasn’t really a nerf for me I lost maybe 2 damage a shot
---
Intuition shouldn't even be a factor here. It says right there on the screen which button to use. You don't need Intuition to read a simple command.
---
😁 I can understand when you are enclave member
---
Yeah sarcasm is super hit and miss on this sub. Some responses blow up with upvotes and some sink to the depths of hell with downvotes.
---
Sarcasm on this post was risky since the majority don’t like pvp in adventure mode and those that do are very vocal and aggressive about their opinion.
---
Do you use by an chance Suppressor from Charisma? I removed and now Follow Through works for me.
---
Evidently personal hygiene is not a priority in post-apocalyptic America
---
Thanks for the tip..do you know if we need to rank up the special legendary perks?like say special do I need to upgrade it to get 5 perk cards
---
Before the seasons hit I would never join a group so there was nothing to consider. But now with the occasional score requirement for groups its not so straight forward anymore. I'm sure that's exactly what bethesda was hoping for.
---
It looks sick but fuck the brotherhood
---
Resistance and Reduction aren’t the same thing. Done right, Power Armor can still be better than normal armor, especially with the new legendary perks.  PA is also more accessible.
---
Didn’t know about the plans. I’ll keep skipping it but I can see that as a reason :) 
---
Too bad I can't fully respec my rifleman build at level 60.
---
I do love a good lunch box party! The community is really good at rolling them out for everyone's benefit there and at the Colossus and SBQ events.
---
Yup problem solved.
---
You see you use adjectives to describe nouns. Which is why hyperbole and sarcasm (nouns) can be condescending (an adjective) you’re welcome for the English lesson.
---
Yes, there is to an extent. Basically just look at a wall at a corner then aim down sights, and you'll peek around the corner. Let go of ads and you'll pop back
---
I perceive it to be different because I could fire a dozen magazines before my laser broke. Now I can do three if I’m lucky.
---
I use the new legendary perks for seringe, gives food and water and cure disease. It's awesome.
---
I did a lot of tests because it didnt work for me too. Turns out Suppressor from Charisma was the cause. I removed Suppressor and now it works every time (but it still has the annoying delay)
---
noticed...a lot of player hates the brotherhood 🤔
---
Oh I forgot to mention, here's how I did that part...grenade, sniper rifle, grenade, sniper rifle, grenade.  If you come from the top and stand on the mountain ridge directly over the shoulder of the Deathclaw, this should work for you.  I didn't know what to expect when I got there and that's just the best course of action that came to mind.  Done and done.
---
Not sure what you mean. The special legendary perks? Eh depends on your build. If you find yourself needing extra strength go for it but it caps at 15 so if you already have 15 strength getting the legendary strength will do nothing
---
Without fusion cores it's useless. Armor doesn't need them, while there's still various perks like dodgy which decrease taken damage.
---
The increase in difficulty from the nerfs and scaling are supposed to be mitigated somewhat from the legendary perks. I am stealth commando (non bloodied) and my weapons lost maybe 10-12dmg tops. Some legendary perks are mandatory now like ammo due to bullet spongyiess. But there are legendary dmg perks that can offset the nerfs. Also the SPECIAL legnedary allow you to add more regular perks that increase damage. The legenardy survivabilty perfs are a godsend as well ie poison resist and rad resist/remove.
---
I like the idea of multiple mission types and multiple objectives, including missions *against* the BoS (perhaps made available by MODUS).
---
I am always supportive of diversity and player agency and options and additional content.
---
Very true. I just remember how bad everyone freaked out last season. I'm not worried, I just like to see how far ahead I am lol. At r20 already, getting so much xp I'm moving fast lol
---
I'm getting really good at accumulating Vault 94 stash boxes it would seem - looking forward to some variety there
---
No it isn't. Something you don't know where the bugs are till you put it in the world and see how players interact with it. The Test Server helps, but if you go over to the offical Test Server Forums, there's very little feedback in terms of bugs. You see a lot of the same kind of post here. Remove the cost to fast travel. Give me this. Give me that. Because some people are using it to raise their voice on what they want in the game.
---
A lot of players are there to learn about the content before it goes live so when it does, they can do it without having the learning curve. 
---
Heres my favorite feedback I've read. "I hate the artwork for the new season and I will not be playing it once it goes live."
---
That's an opinion. Not feedback. Not bug testing, nothing but childish tantrum. And there's a significant amount of that in the forums. 
---
Players will always do things designers don't expect, which is often how serious bugs are found out. Then they have to re-evaluate the content and make a choice. In that case they decided to shut it down. And over time, decided to reuse the content for something else. 
---
Go make friends with a computer programmer or engineer and ask them. It's a great education in the reality of things. Especially for people like you, who think they know how everyone's job is done.
---
All I did is explain how it works and give the OP some understanding for not intuitively knowing what button to press. It’s awkward design to use that button on a console. Maybe on PC it’s not so weird.
---
Its kinda ugly imo. Makes it look like someone wrapped construction stripes wrapping paper around it.
---
Even with perfect SPECIAL and quite a bit of luck with perk cards you'll likely still want legendary perks and doing all the good quests with relevant rewards will easily put you in the 120s
---
Like I said, done right PA makes you invincible. I fight people in PA, and they’re total pushovers. But there’s this one dude in a BoS faction I fight that I literally cannot kill, even if he stands there and does nothing. And I’m no pushover myself, my weapons, build and armor are fully optimised for PvP.
---
(BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR) What's that? Sorry I can't hear you trying to kill that humongous mutated monstrosity with a lever/bolt action rifle over the sound of my gauss minigun.
---
I disagree. We don't need to buff rifleman, what we need is more powerful dedicated single shot weapons. You want to go kill that lvl 100 mirelurk queen or super mutant behemoth? Don't use a gun meant to kill deer. Bring a .50 caliber Anti-material rifle or 20mm anti-tank rifle or something.
---
I like the rad one, at level 1 i never have rads
---
I like my patched outfit and black cowboy hat. I dont plan on wearing any BOS gear (visually) because my character isn't into that stuff.
---
They could rip that shower stall where we got the the scorched anti bodies and, put it at home with a menu for the different symptom like disease, rad mutations, health. Maybe even a fancy option that requires a rare material  that will cure a specific mutation.
---
Exactly. In order to make a specific  type of character shine, you don't need to make the others terrible.  
---
But, as a sneaky character who had to put on his rusting PA yesterday to survive a Daily Ops event I'm looking forward a Daily Ops which penalizes PA usage (that is, glued to the ground)... 3:-)
---
Woo-hoo now I can do no damage but at least I'm 4 levels higher yipee!1!1!!!1!!1
---
Ok dude, I pvp constantly and even upload to a yt channel. Targeting someone with a nuke isn't griefing, there's something called a block for session button or you can leave. You're making it a way bigger deal than it has to be
---
Yeah I know, but I have enough banked levels and perk packs to (mostly) fully max out the 6 available slots and that's about it... So whatever I pick I'm going to be rolling with for quite awhile.
---
I get about an hour at night during the week. But the good thing is I'm off sat/sun. Thats when I put in a few hours.
---
This community really is the best community - together we will make the wasteland a better place!
---
Only in first person. Walk up to a wall and then aim, you will jump out around the corner automatically.
---
Did you come to any conclusion? I am considering swapping out 2 ranks of concentrated fire for 2 ranks of ground pounder (20% faster reload) or glow sight.
---
I used to enjoy going around with my armor-ignoring .44 magnum and shooting ghouls and rats for the fun of it. Can't even scratch them with it now, just useless weight.
---
The XP gain is nice though, I'll admit that. Just that shooting a rat 10 times with my explosive handmade, which before was my most powerful weapon, isn't fun.
---
I did have this problem at first but I took off all my perks and put them all back on, feels like it made a difference to me
---
I’m at 12 and going away for 4 days but still think I’ll get it done.
---
Survival shortcut is just amazing if you have a hard time dealing with food/water/cures/out of combat healing.
---
Oh and this is when it hits you all at once ..like I completely removed food and water from my inventory and just survive on these now. 
---
I have it at rank 4 and I get 2 every 20 minutes with a max of 10.
---
I feel like this and Whistle was only added to thicken the pot making the good stuff harder to obtain
---
Pal, I'd love to see how you do without burning through all your stimpaks in your stash....
---
You'll be fine with the extras and doubles and everything
---
Confirmed where? I need direct proof
---
A package courier found shot in the head near Goodsprings has reportedly regained consciousness, and has made a full recovery. Now that's a delivery service you can count on!
---
a shitty port at best.
---
they still have to support this game for the last gen consoles hardware spec, so unless they want to pull a GTAO thing where they ditch the last gen and stop supporting it, it will be the same game, just might run a little better. that being said, no amount of compute power will overcome this games server and engine side fuckery.
---
I have it at 30% &amp; seems about right ad I have had it proc a few times now.
---
Getting hit once or twice isn't bad. But when it stacks up? Yeah it gets pretty obnoxious lol.
---
Is this of any use i used it last season? https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html
---
Skyrim has that though. 85% cap.
---
xbox...wanted to make the switch to pc since i have ultimate (own the game on xbox) but account doesnt carry over, and I'm not keen on having to relevel...frankly thats part of my problem with this game is having to crank out levels to change ANYTHING in my build...have only been able to get ahold of a semi/auto handmade with junkies and a bolt action pipe rifle with junkies...running escape artist/3x3 rifleman/bmess/crippling and several other vats oriented cards (though id rather be able to run some more QoL cards for picking/hacking without having to stop and shuffle my perks around) had hope for the bow when it first came out because that would have been a great offshoot of the build, but we all know how that went...have some QoL mutations for jumping high and some other minor stuff...and a couple pieces of SS armor with bolstering or vanguard ..i forget I've been on a bit of a break and came back to check out the new patch...level 50 shit mobs take AT LEAST 2/3 stealth shots to kill...last time i played I burned through 900 rounds on sbq...i can make my own ammo so not a big issue there just really tedious. I'm sure my build could be WAY better, but I play mostly solo as most of my friends have abandoned the game due to getting half way through and finding out only xyz builds are worth a shit and thats not their playstyle...I'm sure ill keep playing in streaks because I love the wasteland and feel of the FO franchise. The game being a QUASI mmo is fine, but you can max out a char to only realize the build you were going for is worthless and be faced with hours of grinding to change it into something you didnt want to play anyway. I still have hope for the game.
---
I just get discouraged by the fact there are several things I can't do effectively without bending to the meta. With the scaling that is just more of the game I wont be able to do.
---
My legacy flamer can't get through more than a mag with max gunsmith before it breaks. I barely ever use it because I don't feel like using 15 repair kits to get through Whitesprings.
---
I'm a vats rifleman and you can still run it.
---
I had to move around some perks and max out some legendary perk point cards but I'm back to one shot popping level 100 super mutant heads at west tek with my hunting rifle.
---
Basically get all the + damage cards.  Covert ops, adrenaline, bloody mess,gun fu,  rifleman etc..
---
I added 5 star explosive damage card and it brought my explosive rifles back up to almost pre update damage.
---
Thinking of adding shotgun damage cards as I carry an instigating explosive combat shotgun for when things get out of hand and a vampires gauss for big game which jumped way up with demolition perk.  Both can rip through most anything
---
This was exactly my thinking too. 20% reload speed is effectively a multiplicative 20% boost in dps.
---
You can still sit up there to snipe the groups of enemies before the final boss.
---
Only in specific areas or boss fights it was a way of saying "you shouldnt be here yet". The problem is that the "difficulty" now is TTK. 
---
I would prefer if instead of doing less damage, we took more damage, thus punishing the rambo playstyle
---
Well that sorta sucks, Beth needs to get on that!! But as a heavy gunner tank in PA rocking taking one for the team, max suppression and tenderizer it more than makes up for it, imo.
---
Thank you. I’ll read up on those perks.
---
Oh god!
---
You arn't kidding. It looks REALLY ugly.
---
Yeah that would be great! Like, it’s nice to have it at the camp to come back to but it’s literally a fancy disease cure and not much else. I do admit that’s it’s a pretty nice camp item, just wish it had a more varied list of attributes.
---
I planned way ahead, knew which ones I wanted. Survival Shortcut, What's Rads, str, end, cha, int.
---
It's not just resistance. I can outlast a furious explosive tesla with 30% health, all it takes are a opened pip boy and have 50 super stims stocked. That's how i would remain invincible in power armor, it's a good trick but a complete waste. I bet he's using other chems or tricks but it's not the armor alone that protects you. Considering how pa reduces 42% with all pieces and then 30% on top of that with my AP i can easily die when i don't try to stay alive
---
right, or the ones that have been begging for this
---
It definitely went from hero to zero immediately. 
---
I'd make it give a substantial bonus to stealth, maybe?
---
The ledge is only for the clearing of the enemy group that has to be killed right before the end boss fight
---
I'm in the same boat you're in and I made my decision: to stop playing.   The sad thing is... I was a month and a half into the game and LOVING IT!  Then the update hit.  Now I hate it and I quit playing. 
---
When the zones were in place, I could choose if I wanted the day to be a challenge or relaxing.  Now everything is challenge, including just getting basic supplies.  When I'm not profiting on ammo crafting materials  when I'm trying to farm them, there's a problem. 
---
I'm keeping my eyes on the game.  According the Juicehead's video from yesterday, Bethesda has noted there's a problem and will be doing a hotfix.  If that solves the problems, I'll be back, but otherwise?  Playing a game should be relaxing me, not frustrating me.
---
I have 10 strength but how do I get it to 15.?one legendary strength card gives 1 point?
---
Holy shit! I'm sorry I doubted you. 
---
That looks horrendous
---
I do kinda like that skin on the Whistle in the Dark though honestly
---
Yeh totally agree, I love this one. Highly recommended to anyone else. I only have rank 1 and always have 5, well until I need one that is.
---
All the pistols are so damn chunky. The PPK is svelte.
---
Yeah and if you upgrad3 it it adds another point.
---
I was explaining it from an experienced player's standpoint. Yes the UI is bad but you don't need to "playthrough the new stuff" to know that.  
---
"playing through the new stuff" means you're probably an old player whos seen the perk screen a dozen or so times.  
---
If an experienced player takes a look at the perk screen right now then they will definitely see the differences and quickly understand. There are big arrows pointing out the new stuff.
---
NP man, good luck, try not to get too discouraged. This update eas a massive change, so some adaptions are going to be required. 
---
By the sounds of it bethesda is reading feedback for future changes that they plan to hotfix as theyngo rather than add a huge  patch like this one.
---
Exatcly , if they wanted to bump up difficulty , we should take more damage rather than doing less
---
I would like to see some scaling with the proviso around your luck, higher luck equals more procs.
---
Wow.
---
Emergency Protocols helps. A lot. That legendary perk helps too, you know the recharge one? Try the reboot perk too. He’s also got a load of other damage mitigation perks.
---
Agreed about no real advantage, however the point for most I assume is the 250 daily SCORE reward for the seasonal board + new perk card scrapable for 2 coins toward legendary perk leveling. I have not personally noticed a significant difference in any case, though I run a high-INT build, usually farm super mutants for XP, and am always gorging on cranberry cobbler for the +10% XP.
---
Fast travel out or walk out the door in the case of the galleria yesterday.
---
ok, I understand 100% ✌️
---
I didn't really bother with Sizzling or Funky Duds. I already deal with poison effectively, I didn't see either of those as worth the investment. Especially when I can just boost END by 5 pts, take Fireproof, and have 2 additional slots to play with.
---
I only needed Ammo Factory on my main, I was already supplying all of my alt ammo needs from there.
---
Junkies commando alt, I did take What Rads, but I'm debating if I keep it. It's more of a convenience than anything.
---
Taking One for the Team, however is a standard on all four of my characters. Beyond that, 15-20 addititional perk slots to fully build out characters? Yes, please!
---
As an internet Karen I disagree with everything you just said and I want free legacies. 
---
Nah but I’m in complete agreement with you, yes as a bloodied rifleman my damage is now minuscule but to be fair I was 1 shotting everything and 2-3 shotting scorchbeasts so the damage rework was needed, now it actually feels like an RPG game, not an easy but repetitive legendary grind, and all those complaining mustn’t have seen all the good they’ve brought with this patch, I’ve never had as much fun as I am currently doing daily ops or actually running away from mirelurk queens and laughing, people just need to take their tampon out and play an RPG how it’s supposed to be played. 
---
Learn, adapt, conquer. It’s not rocket science
---
that's pretty much what I mean, just playing normally I am getting all the XP I need. Every time I level I don't really have much use for perks at this point and legendary perks are just icing, not something I'm desperately needing.
---
I as rhe host of the team couldn't see it. But its visible for everyone else.
---
Oh god my sides.
---
 If you are going to bitch about everything this forum does, maybe find a different forum.
---
So it can be legendary nice
---
Well, in theory, you'll be getting level 50 drops instead of level 5 drops.  But scorched rarely spawn legendaries, they are literally deliberately designed so that you hardly ever see one.  And... if I'm farming legendaries, I would happily scour Harper's or some place like that.
---
Last SBQ run, it took a fair amount of time to down it.  But... nobody died, as far as I could tell.  I sure as hell took next to no damage (Ive taken Stimpak off my hotbar and I feel like even putting Diluted Stimpak in its place is overkill).  I didn't need to use any particular tactics.  At no point did it feel difficult, dangerous, or challenging in the slightest.  If the *end game boss* is just a basic bullet sponge, there's really no argument that *this is just plain tedious*.
---
Legendary perks are new, 1week ago power armor would be a lot weaker than today
---
Once you dont use it just scrip it. Save the scrip for when you hit level 50.
---
not in game anymore but it's in the middle of the counter against the wall. you go in the room straight ahead and it should be directly ahead. 
---
have you tried joining someone elses op?
---
10 weeks, same as last time
---
It's not a xp buff for low levels however, i read posts from 20-30 levels that are struggling,apparently mobs had such a huge health buff with one wasteland for all, that now it takes triple the amount of ammo to kill them and weapon's break faster.
---
But yes for me leveling is much easier,also i invested some legendary points to intelligence and i earn more xp.
---
Even a week ago I found it difficult to kill him, and I sure couldn’t do it consistently.
---
He’s bitching about the bitching, 
---
if anything he’s a bitchin’ bitch warrior
---
Yeah. At least it’s removable.
---
I thought you were the OP my mistake for replying without looking. I can still merge with a flamethrower or the place on a slope trick as well. OP had said if you had just the blueprint not the factory your camp wouldnt spawn. I honestly have not found anything i cant do that i could do before aside from placing the ammo factory that i did once to try it out. Apologies for not being more observant of who posted but as i said i cant find anything thats been changed as of yet.
---
Yeah right now it'll be more complicated with that nerf
---
Only 1 rank in concentrated fire is worth it now. I am moving other 2 ranks to ground pounder for reload speed.
---
TSE definitely needs as many ranks of gun smith as you can squeeze in.
---
i think this dates back to an ancient historical time in gaming called the “early mmo” era where players were often built up to new games or mmo expansions only to be very much let down when those said games released by missing features or having bugs or just simply not being enjoyable... this in turn started a trend where gamers now look for any small reason to complain or create a negative outlook on the games and is now continuing even for small issues similar to the ones you’ve just stated.
---
tl;dr - mmo gamers are scarred and just want a perfected game which hardly ever exists anymore
---
as for me personally i think the new updates for one wasteland are awesome except i find a lot of areas has enemies that heal themselves in between me hitting them with bullets which seems to be more of a bug than a difficulty issue.
---
I just hit "join".  This was my first attempt at daily ops, so I don't think I know how to join others.
---
Because Meat Many Days doesn't sound right. Grahm has repeatedly pointed this out in game.
---
I'm glad I blew your mind with the truth about the game and you. 
---
have a great day!
---
Drop from 1 cap? Thats the fair price as its everywhere and easy to craft.
---
I never actually got the water selling kid. Does that happen if you kill Travis or something?
---
Haven't started it yet, seeing how much pain it is, but I'll be doing it over time.
---
You’re fine with having just the blueprint for the ammo factory. But your camp can’t have the ammo factory in it at all. Leastways not anymore.
---
What is your experience with south Korea?
---
I did that uranium event alone and got swarmed with glowing ones. Got killed 3 times and failed the event but i gained 3 lvls and 4 levels on the scoreboard
---
I will try that today.  Thank you!
---
Hate to say it, but so what? The problem was not leveling up fast enough. Besides, the history of every RPG ever, you go trekking for harder monsters. That's part of the point.
---
Never seen that myself. I've seen enemies go back to full half after I die and respawn but not during a fight
---
This is just another example of high level players only thinking about themselves, and not the long term viability of the game.
---
Even without the nerf it’d be even harder. Now my damage has been severely cut, it’s impossible. His health goes down, but not a lot. Then it goes straight back up again...
---
She sounds like Rose
---
fighting exclusively high level enemies was *always* an option for players tho.....   the thing people are complaining about is being *forced* to do it.
---
It *is* in the legendary pool once you learn the plans. I got legendary War Glaives in the PTS and have heard reports of them in the live game. It's a top tier 2h melee weapon.
---
I just reached level 50 and saw this card.  Thanks for the tip!  Will def have to out it to use.
---
Well, I would prefer having encounters where you need to adapt your tactics sometimes.  But that is difficult to implement, so buffing their damage output instead of their sponginess would be good enough for me, yeah.
---
This is a real weak spot in OW. I have a functional commando/rifle swapper that now only really works as commando. Sniper is now unsatisfying.
---
Long shot ADS needs a dramatic boost and needs to apply to all scoped weapons. Maybe combine with largely worthless sniper perk.
---
Nice shot! Are you saying OW is a train wreck or are you just saying it is a wild adventure due to being harder?
---
I run a sneak rifleman who relies on criticals and a full set of chameleon armor. I have a TSE and bloodied FFR 15 percent reload rifles with a non legendary fixer.
---
And on the seventh day, he rested
---
it’s the craziest thing, i thought it was just me then found a thread yesterday where others experienced the same issue. for example i hit an enemy at 100%. health and knock them down to maybe like 40% then when the second bullet connects magically they are at like 75% health. and is continues until they die so i basically have to overkill every enemy or they survive currently. happened 2 nights in a row for me.
---
This is a great idea. Not everyone notices when the event message pops up in the upper left hand corner. if it happens when you are fighting, chances are you aren't going to be able to read it.
---
Makes sense. Avoidance is better than mitigation.
---
It's not hard to understand. We want to relax after a shit day at work in the forest, get some loot build up a camp and so on. And on weekends go to the bog for a good challenge.
---
Other people might want to take their frustration after a hard day at work/school out on the SBQ and relax during the weekend in a low level are and farm a bit.
---
On my main I enjoy sometime just taking in this game unique atmosphere. But I also have a low level alt I immediately took to the west side of the map for higher level enemies, for a more intense experience.
---
I had my main balanced where I could oneshot humanoids and smaller creature, but larger creatures was still a bit of a challenge.
---
Now everything's just spongy. Bullet sponges don't make the game harder, it just makes it more tedious, more grindy. For me anyway.
---
Wouldn't players who have played long term be the ones who'd you'd want to ask about long term viability though?
---
Not those who come in play for a bit then leave?
---
The flame mod is certainly worth a try. I saw most enemies high vulnerability to flame damage to be an oversight, existing because Bethesda had just introduced that effect, but no harm in taking advantage if it still applies!
---
*Because Bethesda is run by nerds that are just jealous of our sweet pecs and massive gains, brah.*
---
Seriously though, it was exploitable for infinite strength.
---
Junkies is one of the meta builds though. I shouldn’t have to use a junkies or bloodied build to play the game as I once did. My regular build was never awesome but I didn’t need to change it for 20 months, I could do anything I needed to, without having to play as junkies or a bloodied build, I didn’t need to sit and research to make sure that all my perks worked well with one another, I didn’t need to use mutations, I didn’t need to have to swap out QoL perks all the time so I can unlock a door but remain combat effective. I would never think my character should be as strong as the 100% combat orientated builds, but I should be able to hold my own in a fire fight and not get swarmed and killed immediately.
---
I can mod it for you. GT: Walrus Parkour. I'm off work in about 1 hour. And online within 2.
---
Presumably till winter a.k.a. "a season"
---
What kind of answer is that? Think about your response a little bit more.
---
Yep! I’m glad, I would’ve missed seeing the other variants
---
and this now take the combat rifle skins as of latest update. 😍
---
If you are going to bitch about what this post say maybe find a different post?
---
It's definatley a change a pace in the once - easier sections
---
I'm loving it
---
I'm only level 14 and so far it's been a great and rewarding experience. I'm using an armor piercing hunting rifle and a low spread shotgun. I always aim at the head no matter what and so far I can still one shot pretty much anything up to scortched, which is enough for clearing areas and advancing in the game. Mole rats are a pain to my armor though, but I just learned that it was a good idea to have an automatic rifle for such occasions. I'm not even a DPS build, I'm building a medic.
---
It's possible that later in the levels things will get harder for me, we'll see.
---
I still farm mostly bloodied unarmed, queen should be meleeable now with wings able to be crippled again.  Earl I one shot adds, but use minigun for dps and safety on him.  Bloodied is still the top damage you can do.  Real question is if you can live now. Survivability is the real problem.  Any other build will do less damage all builds do less now and the variance from best to worse smaller.
---
It's in the base game. Can post links after work if you need to see it vanilla.
---
I see. I indeed use 3 diffrent weapon types and diffrent perk loadouts for each of them, all with bloody mess. Before the patch i even used 6 diffrent types with the old bloodied luxury. 
---
Thank you for your insight on this topic. It really seems to be a bigger diffrence between weapons now with this perk. My shotgun really seems to get a lot more out of it than my fixer. I think i gonna keep it in my loadouts.
---
This...  Just simply go back to Appalachia either by using the exit door for the area or by Fast Travel....
---
I did this the other day when I realized that I had lost too much time fooling around with perk cards and switching weapons.  There is no penalty for simply abandoning the event.
---
Ah, cool. Not so cool I have to trust quest reward and Murgh’s RNG to get one, but good news all the same.
---
You would get tired of the same jokes, who are funny now because you rarely hear them.
---
Hey, I didn't know.  Thanks!
---
I agree with this statement, they tried to make her funny and she’s not at all. If you see an orange colored sky, GRAB THE RAD X.
---
Unless they focused on using elemental damage and resistance a big thing .im unsure on how they could make the game more tactical.
---
I thought about having to make more use of limb damage but maybe it would bump up vats builds too much
---
It’s crazy that in all the games they never did anything to actually improve the radio. It’s straight got worse.
---
I still have my original Gutter from the Burrows hanging on my wall so I'm not even gonna stress about getting it. 
---
Which is good. Because somehow I've gotten elder 3 days in a row now and have yet to get a single rare drop. Hopefully rng will come around for me because I feel like it has been intentionally hitting me with the near impossible so far.
---
T h a n k  Y o u.
---
compared to how many people play the game, almost no one is complaining about it.
---
I decided to try and tackle the resilient robots solo on day one. It didn't go so well. Three robots were stuck in machinery/under stairs in the final round. I was able to use VATS to melee two but I couldn't reach the one under the stairs. A friend joined as i was leaving the room and it "knocked" the last one loose. So you're not the only one it happened to but a teammate could fast travel out and rejoin and they may get freed.
---
But what if I wanna be nakey in my power armor...?
---
Exactly how I felt when I tried booldied, how can I complain about the game being to easy if I made it that way for myself. So I dailed it back to a balanced where I could oneshot humanoids and smaller creature, but larger creatures was still a bit of a challenge.
---
Scorchbeasts are the only thing that give me issues because I'm not long-range. Before the nerf I could down them with a secondary weapon, but now, I'm taking pot-shots at their wings with my gauss shotty to try landing them. 
---
I'm not complaining though. Going around one-shotting pretty much everything wasn't as much fun. Afterall this is Fallout. It's a survival game. There should always be the risk of dying. And I love that.
---
You can explore without grinding ammo. You can sneak past enemies with a Shrouded wood set and the Sneak perk. Or you could try melee them. But it get tricky if you e.g. *want* to use ranged auto, you don't *want* to farm ammo materials, you don't *want* to buy ammo after selling other stuff. Like, it's advertised as a "softcore survival game", not hardcore like dayz, but also certainly not as soft as.. minecraft. Ok MC can get quite tough, but still
---
I don't know if this was the placebo effect but it feels like it worked for me.
---
I would absolutely be fine with that too. Ammo capacity for "traditional" rifles is way too low. Would be nice if the Assault Rifle's thing could be that it has a huge mag, like 80 with the drum, or something.
---
What about it?  It wasn't listed in the OPs example so I didn't use it in mine.
---
However, my understanding is that whatever bonus it provides would be multiplicative in the old days and additive now.
---
My bloodied power armor build is damn near impossible to kill. Level 3 Blocker, Fireproof, Dodgy, Nerd Rage, Ricochet, Refractor, the fire and poison resist legendary perks, Power Armor Reboot 4, and Emergency Protocols. For bosses I put in level 2 Suppressor to reduce their damage by 20%, which makes my armor and damage reduction even more effective. I stack damage reduction foods too. Radstag stew gives +88 energy resistance, Scorchbeast steak gives like 38 DR.
---
I run at like 19-15% health, and almost nothing can touch me. It tickles when Earl and the SBQ hit me.
---
Ah thanks for the heads up
---
125 damage on a medium swing was enough for me.🤷‍♂️
---
Do... do you count anything above one-two shot kills as a leech?
---
I put... put my fair work in.
---
Yeah, as heavy gunner Follow Through isnt a very useful perk anyway but for stealth commandos its crucial to use it.
---
You guys could do with a bit of a challenge for once.
---
Also, Bethesda said that they were going to vary up the static mutation from what I understand so the piercing gaze one won't always be cramping stealth's style all the time.
---
However, the whole deal with challenging events is to challenge you. Learn to adapt.
---
I haven't had that happen yet but I suppose it's just a matter of time.  Especially since I need to move my camp now that Foundation and Crater are free travel points.
---
... do you get owned by ants?
---
... How is it not fundamentally broken in some way when the game gives you gun perks from level 1 (pistol one) which obviously encourages it straight from the getgo yet has the current system be a massive drain on ammo due to the big jump in sponginess of everything. Especially when the current health scaling curve kicks into high gear in the 20s/30s range that outstrips weapon damage increase by far.
---
A big problem with this game is that due to all the level locks on perks your build might not be coming online at all for quite a while. Contrast to something like NV or Grim Dawn where your build identity starts to show itself relatively early on.
---
Because there’s nothing to like about them
---
I’ll try that. Thanks for the advice.
---
Yeah well
---
The cryo is also a good choice, for the same reason. But do know, resist against it does exist, and is shown with awareness. Though it’s never as bad as poison resist.
---
Here have this comment in lieu of another upvote. You nailed it.
---
Just imagine if all events showed up in a window like the Daily Ops and could be joined from there. People would be running everything a lot more I bet.
---
And how did that make you feel?
---
That is some terrible luck. Here’s hoping today’s better and you earn the symptomatic!
---
They break extremely fast with the splitter because Austin in their infinite wisdom decided to make durability loss based on PER HIT than per shot.
---
Go ahead, grab an explosive and fire into the void for a while, then shoot into a crowd and watch that durability bar suddenly plummet.
---
Generic fps unlocking advice, use at own risk:
---
Go to documents/my  games/Fallout 76 and open the file  Fallout76Prefs.ini with notepad   (maybe make a backup first). Look for the line with  'iPresentInterval=1'  and change it to  'iPresentInterval=0', this unlocks fps.
---
IF you experience movement problems indoors (usually in PA), limit the max  framerate for  FO76 via nvidia control panel/AMD tool to a little bit under your  actual monitor frequency.
---
so what you are saying is, the game should be easier because some people are bad at the game?
---
I had hoped that Bethesda would add a third category of extremely difficult challenges that lasted the duration of the event. Things that would take people a long time to accomplish, regardless of level or build.
---
Does this work with Ultracite cores?
---
There's so many different ways to do things in fallout 76, it never hurts to be reminded of options. Cheers bud.
---
You say this now but closer to the end of the season they'll be more involved I bet. We're getting easier stuff now since it's only the beginning.
---
i rarely play in a group and i have zero issues with the new updates. all i get is more xp.
---
So, you don't want any players to be able to join the game and enjoy it, the way you have?
---
I tried stealth out on the melee robots and just got handled. Piercing gaze destroys stealth, as does anyone in group being in combat. 
---
I recommend swap sneak for dodgy and run PA vats commando for daily ops. 🍺
---
Someone around whitespring is a good bet
---
Yeah. I probably should’ve assumed it’d be inevitable eventually. Ah well lol.
---
Double the xp is a good reason to revisit some areas. I’ve been playing since launch with only one character(until now I just made a new toon on Tuesday for experiments) and there’s a lot of areas that I haven’t been too in over a year because there’s no reason to go back to low level scorched. Now I’m going back seeing all these cool places again and actually gaining levels while I’m doing it at lvl 206. Sure it’ll wear off in a couple weeks when I’ve revisited everything again but at least there’s more options to farm xp now instead of just golf club or westek. I see what you’re saying though, if you’ve already explored the entire map theres nothing new too explore but the thing now is just more xp and better legendaries in all areas of the map instead of just the south east corner
---
Having to dig for a comment on Reddit doesn't really feel like transparency, though. People have been asking for weeks whether or not Mischief Night was coming back, and considering they were radio silent, people just assumed they'd forgotten to add it, or maybe the dates weren't final, etc. The right thing to do, in my opinion, would have been a clear post from their official website, months ahead of the scheduled event. 
---
But don't worry. I'm sure there'll be no bugs with buying all the Halloween shit from the atom shop. Why would we want a community event when we can just spend money and play recycle events no one enjoyed?
---
Sorry for the text wall. No bad vibes to anyone but Bethesda.
---
It makes me feel weak and pathetic.
---
We should get to use all of our armor in power armor. We very clearly enter it with it all on, so why not? I’m sick of losing half of my weight capacity when I enter power armor because all my armor is deep pocketed.
---
Huh. That doesn't seem right. Maybe a bug? Hopefully it will get fixed.
---
By overseers camp, but good luck getting it to spawn in anywhere that has high traffic because everyone and thier buddy has thier base there already.
---
That must have taken days to make. So much glitching. Top talent builder.
---
Yep got those already.
---
Why do you think Giddyup Buttercup had to be made? :&lt;
---
Nope.
---
I hear yah but everytime I look for lead the weights aren't there on the public servers. I'm not complaining I can play private servers, but, won't lead start becoming scarce?
---
What’s ITV?
---
And ammo!
---
Yea. But im a PA build so id kinda get screwed lol
---
Here's the link:

---
I don’t know I just thot little kids wanted a robotic horse 🥺
---
Right across from the train station probably gets you the most traffic, but at the cost of not being able to place your camp fairly often.
---
I hope so too, but it’s Bethesda. So not likely.
---
Whitesping area, overseers camp area, possibly north of Charleston
---
Tbh ‘sneak’ (simply crouching) and vats (aimbot) make the game way too easy, like a walk in the park kind of too easy. Daily Ops finally brought back a sense of realism and challenge. I think it’s awesome.
---
with a prime gat plasma i get 2-4 ultracite plasma cores as reward, but i must check this with a gatling laser.
---
Other comments mention that it also works with fusion cores
---
I can def understand it being hard but before the ipdate the game was way to easy now it feels like an actual game. Right now nothing is really balances so well have to wait for buffs and stuff
---
"I'm glad I blew your mind with the truth about the game...
---
... and you."
---
Bwhahahahahahahasnortgiggle....
---
It's almost like different people want different things.
---
They can though. New players can enjoy the game more fully now then they could pre patch.
---
They no longer run into a wall while exploring. They can meaningfully participate at events. They can do quests at the speed they want without being out paced by mobs.
---
All they have to do is learn how to build their characters. This is an online multiplayer game. You need to think about your build.
---
What you said was exactly my point. New players not understanding how the game works. Being turned off at the first sight of change. All new players coming in to this patch will have things better.
---
Inside the vault
---
Thx I actually did, I got the spec ops helmet
---
I hate that guy so much... if I could delete allies, or just flat out kill him I would
---
lots of people that are bad at the game dont want to take the time to learn how to play, they just want easy mode
---
Yeah I run bloodied commando on my main and been playing awhile. Just cleared level 300. Was respecting an alt, albeit slowly lol. Have all the gear for the build but it’s gonna be a slog to get the last 11 levels to swap the stats around as it’s set up as a sniper right now which lost a lot of damage
---
Also easier to find with the fly buzzing sound if they're in meat piles.
---
The paper bags in vault 94 were annoying though.  Trying to find them on the bush...
---
No, high level players for the most part are thinking of the lower levels and people who are just starting to play the game. Sure, damage is lower, weapons break faster, and it's easier to die now but it's definitely beneficial for endgame in the long run. But it's such a shitshow for those who are starting out and overall I think they got the short end of the stick.
---
I LOVE the bloodied flamethrower I just picked up. But the low durability is truly obnoxious, and definitely needs to be fixed. I use the standard nozzle, so I haven't had the range/nozzle swap bug problems other seem to be having. 
---
Though if I ever use the vaporization nozzle, I'd be putting out like 430+ damage per shot, making it even more powerful than my bloodied gauss minigun post patch 22, so I can understand why its durability is low.
---
HOW IN THE WORLD DID YOU GET ONE????
---
You might need to re-read.
---
I love this game but have agreed with many of the "bitching" post over the past year. If not for some of these post the game you have now wouldn't exist. If everyone had just "found another game" you would not have some of the great changes that have been implemented lately. I've played since launch and nothing in the game has ever bothered me enough to bitch about it on Reddit but I'm sure glad some folks did!!
---
It wasn't great. You have to aim while looking just to the edge of a wall, but it doesnt poke out very much. I found it easier just to abandon cover.
---
why dont you google some builds? its really not that difficult.t here are multiple websites that have all the perks and stats listed out for multiple builds that are effective in the game.
---
My camp is sitting on seneca rocks. No enemy would ever make their way up there. Neither did any pet i ever sent up there. So nvm.
---
Same. I took on a mirelurk queen last night, just took a ton of ammo. Not harder just more tedious, more grindy.
---
Hit ADS when you're next to the end of a piece of cover, you'll poke out as long as you're aiming.
---
Can't blame ya for not knowing however, Bethesda is fucking terrible at explaining the finer details of things in game.
---
Sounds like you need to re spec because I’m killing those super mutants with 3 shots of a Gatling gun
---
None of this is true. You're not listening. New and mid range players are getting slaughtered because of the change, but you don't give a shit. In fact, you're telling them to leave because the game should only cater to you and your obsessive need to level up an insanely high level character faster.
---
That's entirely fucked and will wind up killing this game in the long run. Congrats, dude.
---
Everybody knows about Fallout pacifist runs. You haven't even played half the series. Please sit down.
---
Oh god... Might as well just give us Fisto.
---
Goodbye
---
He bought it
---
Using shotguns?
---
I found that the Mirelurk Queen is one of the toughest enemies post-patch, and I love it!
---
You seem to think that's some kind of justification.
---
It's just a reeeaaally long way to say "I don't want to play NW, because reasons".
---
"optiimized builds" = actually using the perk card system the way it was meant to be used.  
---
I dont get all this complaining about people who dont just select random perk cards and actually read them instead.
---
Ive always sold ammo for 1 cap. Never sold much as its pretty cheap to manufacture with perk cards. Example i can make .50 270 at a time for 12/10/40 powder/lead/steel. All available cheap as bulk or in the case of gunpowder readily crafted with the tons of junk I collected. Steel is 79 lead is 100 something. Its way less than 1 cap per 5-10 rounds or more not doing the math on it. If your selling for more than 1 your just ripping people off and manipulating the economy as well. I see people charging as much as 5 per round of cheaply crafted ammo and thats just ridiculous. Caps are easy enough to gather or farm if you know how without tricks. Duping on the other hand is an exploit and i dont see it going away regardless. I dont think Bethseda does either thats why rare drops like the western outfit can be now gotten from a vendor with only a little luck involved. That ruined the economy not ammo factories.
---
Also, make sure the whole team goes to the same signal booster. Missed elder yesterday by 30 seconds because the team split up when going to the two boosters and we didn't realize it right away.
---
Telling other people how to live their lives is a poor choice.  Give it some more thought.  Note: yes, I appreciate the irony of telling you how to live your life, part of the human condition, best to learn to laugh about it :)
---
Additionally, do you really think that setting up a whole class of content to specifically screw over certain builds is a good idea?  I mean sure, right now, it's Stealth getting screwed and you don't seem to be a stealth build.  But what if next time it is the bloodies folk getting screwed (say by a small amount of constant damage every second or a constant decontamination shower) or the junkies getting screwed (say by airborne addictol or some such)?
---
No, best to admit that screwing over people's builds and saying "I know you spent hundreds of hours playing the game the way you wanted to but now you either play it this way or not at all" for whole ranges of content, especially in a game with so little content, is a bad idea and needs to stop.
---
I like 1WL, though I know it needs tweaking, especially in the level of creatures spawning. I'm level 210+ and the lowest creature is always level 50 no matter where. I think they might need to adjust things for certain areas. Like maybe the forest, the max level a creature can be is 25? And then 30 for Toxic and Ash heap, 40 for savage divide. 
---
I wasn't sure how this would play out. And for me, I found it had side benefits that I had been thinking about for sometime. Ways to improve the game play.
---
I made a post about it. But in short, one thing me and my friends were experiencing was each time we played, we would end up with more resources than when we started out. 
---
I'd start with 50 stimpaks and after a few hours, and using stimpaks, I'd finish with 70+ because you get them so much faster than using them. My idea was that maybe the game needs less. You can make, find and get as rewards stimpaks in the game. So lower that. But making the world more dangerous is a better route than what I was thinking. Sure it's a survival lite game. But after a while it wasn't feeling dangerous anymore. I would die more because I was being lazy and not paying attention than from the game being a challenge. 
---
At one point I had over 170 stimpaks. So I went around and put a stimpak and other things in every mailbox in Flatwoods.
---
And it was the same for all resources. Selling them to vendors was the best way to use up resources.
---
Now I need to make things, repair things. It's great, because that's an aspect of the game I like. 
---
My feeling about people who don't like the update. It could be because of what kind of games they like playing. Mainly kill and level up and get rewards to get more powerful. 
---
This game has a lot of content that doesn't focus solely on that. Camps for one thing. That whole thing took on a life of it's own. I'm sure the developers thought players would like the camp thing. I don't think they realized the level of creativity it would spark in some players. And that's just really great. I'm into camp building. I don't mind it getting damage. 
---
I always want to see what new camp items are coming into the game. I made a big post about current in game items a lot of us would like to add to our camps. 
---
But yes, i can see how this change is a hard blow to alot of players that have invested their game play into removing all risk in the game so they can just kill and collect.
---
How they choose to focus their game play is not invalid. However, since the game doesn't focus on just the aspects they like, it does mean that their frustration with game changes are going to be more frequent. Because the whole point of being uber is so you don't have to worry. You've figured it out, and now you can just feel godlike and blow everything away. 
---
It's a fragile choice in how to play where even small minor changes to a perk or a weapon will cause players to have to rethink how they get back to being uber.
---
That's fair, I wasnt saying complaining is bad and peoplw shouldn't complain. I'm saying seeing the same thing over amd over again gets annoying, if it's been said already, why say it another hundred times
---
As a player of 2 months, I think this was the push I needed to cancel my Fallout 1st account and move on to the next game. Thanks.
---
Yes, thanks. I see that. Unfortunatly, it doesn't really work for me as I don't really want to have to create a new link every time I want to tinker with the build. Unless I am totally dumb, I don't see a way to return to a build and edit it without having to create another link or shortcut.
---
I would much rather have an app or account on their site to save builds.
---
Thanks anyways.
---
For me, Resilient modifier in Daily Ops is equivalent to getting the Exodus Crash strike in D2.
---
This is fake, because OP never once used the term "bullet sponge."
---
Little kids? Hah! I'm a grown man and I'll keep on enjoying my Giddyup Buttercup icon. Now if only I could display his toy in my camp...
---
Nah make it a separate thing just like the fixer is diffrent from combat rifle
---
Just because you don't pick a perk/add to your SPECIAL doesn't mean you haven't levelled up. You'll just be a level 51 with a terrible quality of life.
---
At least It doesnt roll on purveyor so one less garbage item for me to drop
---
Fuck right off with that "bit challenge" and "adapt".
---
OW is imho nice and the "nerf" was long in coming. I don't need to one-shot everything. I am fully behind this, even though it needs a lot of tweaking for lower level toons, because a 750% increase in DR of the mobs around lvl 20-35 is just insane when you can't get enough ammo.
---
As for the Daily Ops, **IIFF** Beth really brings some where piercing gaze is not present, then all is good for all stealth using toons.
---
But it just can't be that people that spent nearly 2 years perfecting their build and gear only get kicked in the nuts by Beth and curb stomped by others with schadenfreude to see a build getting useless.
---
So "learn to adapt" is the same as telling someone to change their skincolor (bad analogy, but it gets my point across), it's just not what you do.
---
Whenever you can reply in a way that can be seen different ways. 
---
Always take that option. ALWAYS.
---
It never showed up for me either. Pretty sure it's upstairs above the cafeteria section.
---
Haha u do u man, but I still want to ride a horse through a nuke lol
---
That's awesome. Kill enemies until you can't carry another bullet.
---
Money well spent I guess?
---
Fyi hardware generally doesn't work on games unless the game was optimised when that hardware existed... Who knows maybe Bethesda will update their engine 😂
---
Deathclaws are still wimps compared to other enemies. Took out a 3 star legendary Deathclaw Matriarch about an hour ago with no issue. I didnt even have a specific build on and my armour sucks ass, still wasn't that threatening.
---
Sheepsquach on the other hand...I wouldn't bloody know seeing as its event is now almost impossible to solo with those crazy OP wolves and shiity Brahmin.
---

---
Looks like maybe all the forest events can drop it based on datamining, just Thirst things first has the highest drop chance.
---
I know I'm going to get downvoted in to oblivion here, but I actually like this version of country roads better than John Denver's.
---
I got super lucky, but this wasn't meant as a brag it was to point out how badly the game performs at 4k in some areas and maybe BGS Austin can do some optimizations and impliment DLSS or something?
---
Link the guy posted above
---
 Can you really be this ignorant?
---
While I agree, I also disagree. Bethesda has a lot of experience with 'online services' games and we all love Fallout. We want it to be better. We want the best Fallout.
---
No you are not listening. This is a multiplayer game. I don't know of any multiplayer online game that allows you to have shit gear and a shit build and do well. That is not how they function
---
I am saying they need to adapt. Drop some of their qol perks. Farm some gear.
---
Mid range players will have it the worst because they don't know any better, but they need to adapt. All players incoming will have it better off.
---
If this change hadn't happened my play time, and the vast majority of other long term player would be leaving soon. Having 3/4ths of the map be pointless to us just kills the game
---
I am sorry your semi modded level 35 hunting rifle no longer kicks ass.
---
But leaving the game in the state it was before would kill it. Games need to change and grow. This game was getting incredibly stale and this patch brought a lot of new life to it.
---
Well, yes. The point of my exclamation was in the fact the RTX 3080 was basically sold before it was released and everyone (besides OP) was having a very hard time getting one. I’m glad OP got one.
---
Despite the damage nerf (change in how damage is calculated) this is by far (in my opinion) a huge improvement fron the last patch.
---
Ohhhhh okay, I thought it only came from the daily. Thanks for the info!
---
Yup, no big difference here (vats/crit gunslinger with a little bit of rifleman). I already had tank killer rank 1 for my usual opener from long distance with a lever action and now it helps with pistols as well.
---
Or just craft it with the proper perk cards. I make thousands of rounds a day of .50 with minimal effort or materials.
---
&gt;A big problem with this game is that due to all the level locks on perks your build might not be coming online at all for quite a while.
---
Is this your first MMO? is this your first RPG?
---
dude everything you're complaining about is regular stuff in an RPG. 
---
"I can't build my end level build because I'm only level 30!!" well no shit.
---
This. All of this. And make her a NPC we can meet
---
Ig we aren't allowed to criticize anything any more.
---
I am not sure but you may have experienced some type of temporary budget glitch. I have had this happen to me multiple times. I try to redecorate with a different object or a small group of objects that should use the same budget as what was initially being used and it tells me I have exceeded the budget. I spent over an hour trying to figure it out one day. Then I quit and restarted the game and my budget was back and allowed me to place the proper amount of items.
---
Maybe if Bethesda did something correct the first time and gave players actual options there would be far less bitching...
---
Didn’t know gutter was painted.
---
This is the best possible answer. Which of us are going to argue with Grahm about what he decides to call his event?
---
The one thing the vast majority of this community can agree upon is our support for Grahm.  I’d even stand side-by-side with those treasonous ‘Brotherhood’ bastards and the heathen Mothman cultists to defend and protect Grahm.
---
The Funky Duds legendary perk makes Mirelurk kings a total joke now!  Poison damage is meaningless in my power armor muahahaha!
---
So i have hope when i return. Thank you for your reply
---
It’s a natural part of the industry and as frustrating as it can be at times an important part of feedback and improvement. You have to remember that most people playing the game and enjoying it without issue have no reason to come on here and most don’t. The vast majority of people who come on both here and the forums are those who have issues and complaints. Much like twitter and social media, it’s not reflective of the community as a whole, only the vocal minority who have a problem.
---
Ill spoil the beans.
---
Like everyone else sair, damage reduction.
---
After you get that, pretty much you want born survivor 1 and Field surgeon. Sentinel on all armor pieces as well.
---
Just be ready to burn through stims, but you Will die way less often this way
---
What retailer did you get it through? Did you get the FE edition or a third party card? I’m waiting for the 3070 next month. Planning on upgrading from a 6600k to ryzen and the 3070.
---
Edit: it sucks FO76 isn’t optimized at all. But at least other games look good, right??
---
I see your point when certain builds turn to shit. I remember early on grinding and finally getting a TSE Gauss Rifle for my rifleman build only to have it nerfed. However when I reflected prior to the nerf I was in a position where Scorched Beasts were nothing more than a pest rather then a threat being I was able to one shot them easy. The game had no sense of urgency, no challenge and as a result it was boring really early on. Imagine if the ENTIRE map was the forrest region. The day after the nerf I found myself pinned down in the fire station by 3 Scorch Beasts and all I had was the TSE nerfed weapon equipped. For the first time in a while I felt like I was done for. Long story short, I liquidated my rounds/stimpaks, killed all three and barely made it out with a sliver of health. Then I realized the nerf was justified. I had a blast but it was back to the drawing board with my build. Ask anyone who plays Online RPGs and they'll tell you that's typical. So yeah, I get your dilemma.
---
That said, I find that something must be off if you're using a Junkies + VATS and are not able to down level 50s easy. I know the card swapping is a huge pain in the ass but ALL of us have to do it. Until the load out update drops, it is what it is. However, you don't need your entire perk setup designated to your build. There's only a handful of essential cards which leaves a bunch of optional slots to do as you wish. You can carry looting cards along with dmg.
---
Rather than talking a good game I'd rather prove it to you. If you ever jump on PC, I have a private server and I can take a look at your build and I'm sure we can come up with a loot/exploration/dmg sniper hybrid that requires no real build effort. Hit me up with a DM and I'll send you a friend invite.
---
That's the spirit!
---
Bethesda are big boys, they don't you to defend them.
---
If Bethesda wants fewer complaints, here's a thought: Maybe they could start by doing things people actually want? That must sound crazy.
---
I sorry to hear the game has taken anwrong turn for you.  With this update it seem you neednto optimize a certain play adtule to succeed.
---
If you are willing, high level players can take a look ast your build and weapons and give some advise.
---
All the fixers lost their names for some reason but they will still have their legendary effects.  
---
I feel with a little fine-tuning of your cards you will be more effective and able to survive. Also always join a group cuz a lot of people who have mutations and legendary perks benefiting your damage intake and damage output.
---
Gatling gun &amp; .50 cal rifle
---
Brownshirts lol
---
rifles got hit pretty bad regardless. I could 1-2 tap super mutants.
---
now it takes me 6 shots on average. it's insane.
---
Weekly challenges have been repurposed to act as catchup for the people that can't, due to real life issues, log in every single day and do their dailies.
---
The currency caps are the worst and utterly unprecedented (at least in the small amounts that they are). Can you think of any other game that caps you at such small levels of currency? It's a band aid for the fact that they need more currency sinks in this game. 
---
Lift the limit on something and let us pay for a respec or buy atoms with it.
---
I can level up in less then 15 minutes doing daily ops over and over with a good team and make +500 ammo
---
I think the SPECIAL ones are underrated. Although I was bummed to find out the C perk doesn't increase your team point sharing limit. The upside is I don't have to make Sophie's Choice over which E and L cards to load.
---
Yeah, celebrating the departure of another player is a great way to support an online game that relies on sustaining a player base to survive /s
---
No there’s not, there’s only a store all junk button but not a take all
---
Come to find out every subreddit dealing with a GaaS type game is this way. It was with Destiny, then the Division, and now FO76. The vocal majority will never be able to agree on what they want. I hate it too, trust me, but adding fuel to the fire just makes it worse.
---
Does this make the fluxes Gamer Girl Bathwater?
---
It effects no one though.
---
Just hop a few servers and the map will show you where to place your camp. 
---
They tend to mill around high traffic areas ie around Whitesprings (especially whitesprings station), around Foundation (though oddly not Crater for some reason), there can occasionally be some around The Rusty Pick as well as usually a small cluster near the Wayward.
---
It really depends on what your target player/player level is and what you're looking to sell as to the best location for you.

I remember this episode! They thought they were visiting a completely different planet but the plot twist turned out that they were in fact visiting Earth in a parallel dimension! I guess if we had not gotten into a nuclear war here at our dimension, we could have been exploring the stars and playing Star Trek instead of Fallout.
---
The only advantage I've found to having more people is the uplink bar moves more quickly with the team around it. Everything else is your build and strategy. Expect to have to play around with both now what with One Wasteland and all. 
---
As for the meatier BoS content, Bethesda pushed it back again so Ops is what we've got for now.
---
If you pic a weapon type and put points in that special you'll be ok. For instance.
---
If you put points in strength, you have melee, heavy weapons and shot guns to choose from.
---
If you put points in perception you have automatic and semi automatic rifles to choose from.
---
If you go to: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) you can plan ahead a little.
---
Yes I am telling you that.
---
For melee you have to actually chase down every single enemy so that you can one-hit them. For ‘sneak vats’ you just squat and pew pew and yipee all dead. It’s the easiest way to play this game. The challenge in Ops is great because the enemies won’t pretend you’re not there any more, you’d have to fight like in a real fps game not a fantasy theme park. And no i don’t think you can go far without any perk and bare hands. The game is easy when people take advantage of the aid components such as ‘sneak’ and aimbot, without those it’s not that easy.
---
I mean, what else do we do with it?
---
Can’t be anything as sane as bobble it because it dissappears when we use it. 
---
It seems we are putting it into one of our orifices, I just hope and pray it is the mouth.
---
If not, well I have pity for the players who did the stackable bobbleheads glitch...
---
FYI, I checked this morning and everything is back to normal.
---
Looks like another settlement can use your help. Lol
---
Except the are. People wanted a more challenging game then bitched when Bethesda did that. Same with the grinds. People just bitch about everything, and from both sides THAT is the problem
---
Its an upvote from me
---
I’m cool with deathclaws that can kill me, I’m not so cool with being beaten up by mole rats 😭
---
Were you in a group of three when you hit that 8:00? If so, I might be one of the others. It was nailbiting waiting for that summary screen to load up. Ended up getting ZERO rare rewards anyway, though.
---
Ammo Factory for sure....  Give me 150% more ammo any time + 100% from AmmoSmith = 250% ammo.  I have this at level 3.  A few more perk packs and I can max it out.  Of course, every enemy is higher level now so more bullet sponges, but I still think that it's a net gain.  Especially for those of us already making Ultracite .50 cal, 5.56, and/or 5 mm.  And it makes .45 ammo worth crafting vs buying.
---
I'm still on the fence about Electric Absorption.  I never have problems with food/water/cures so Survival Shortcut is on my maybe list.  Plus one of the rare rewards for daily ops is one of the medical machines that cures diseases.  
---
So, for me, I'd rather have the extra perk slots for the SPECIAL categories.  For example, my main is a heavy gunner so I have a lot of points in Strength.  But I also like to use Commando.  so being able to expand Perception and and Agility is really nice.
---
It's too bad that there wasn't a method to recover perk points that were lost as a result of having all of the cards for a category but then getting another one.  I've been playing on my main (level 410) for just over a year and a half and I'm sure that I lost a lot of points that would go towards ranking up more cards.  That being said, at least the legendary runs gives us perk packs...
---
Yeah, it has a weird red and yellow paint
---
Three things to consider:
---
1) if you are seeing the same complaint again and again, over and over...well, it suggests that something might be wrong.
---
2) not everyone lives and breathes this reddit.  If you select new posts and scroll down, well, you only go back a few hours before getting into the dozens or hundreds of posts.  Most people aren't going to spend enough time here to even see it.
---
3) A lot of people don't really search reddit to see if someone else has posted what they are about to post.  They either don't know how or don't care.
---
Other than the amount of ammo that I’m using I’m digging it. I’ve only played with my melee/ heavy gunner character but I’m going to try out my commando/rifleman character tonight
---
Ok.its kinda pricey then.whats your opinion on the level 1 lockpick one do you need to upgrade it to unlock higher locks or at level 1 you just need to lockpick any level lock
---
I have a similar issue. I'm running a rifle/stealth build (not bloodied). Before the update, a level 50 mob took max. 2 shots with sneak working just fine. Now I have a situation where I stand on top of a cliff, cloaked and undetected, and not even my FIRST shot gets the sneak attack bonus. And yes, I can repro it, and yes, I already unequipped/equipped my perk cards. It's not that sneak is not working at all, it just seems completely random now making my build unreliable and not fun to play anymore.
---
I use a Handmade too but I also tried different weapons, with the same result. Either I do something wrong or miss something or the game mechanic of sneaking now works differently.
---
If you are going to bitch about people bitching about people bitching about people bitching about Bethesda maybe find a different forum?
---
You've whittled it down to the Bitch Singularity.
---
Last week I moved/ rebuilt my camp by the wayward, and I've never had so much traffic.
---
OMG I am giving Preston vibes! Normally I wear the metal helmet. But was feeling causal that day. 
---
Well enough of that hat!
---
Sadly, from what you describe, you’re not ‘engaged’ - in other words you’re a casual player who wants to enjoy what the game offers at your own pace and on your own terms rather than a player logging in daily often for long periods because you’re hooked on or stuck in the ‘grind’ and are therefore more likely to visit and spend money in the Atom Shop. Unfortunately the game is no longer intended for you and probably wasn’t in the first place.
---
Just a little heads up for ops: get something like a vampiric plasma flamer, if you are up against robots use troubleshooter armor. No issues so far to solo them if necessary.
---
Shoot dem legs !
---
I love the update personally. Yes, I do take more damage but it's a good level of difficulty to me now. This update has me earning heaps of xp and I feel like an absolute machine when the enemies explode from the new legendary perks. People complain about the nerfs but it's nice to feel more like I'm part of the meta now instead of bloodied dominating the whole game. Plus there is legendary enemies fucking everywhere now
---
but xp and free ammo...
---
Yeah, that "article" is just pure marketing BS.
---
&gt; The team at Bethesda Game Studios will continue listening to player feedback to help drive the future of Fallout 76
---
They never listened.
---
&gt;and now that feedback will extend to Daily Ops
---
That's the biggest BS yet, the feedback they got was ignored.
---
What about the kings tho? I bet those are going to be literal nightmares now.
---
&gt;Had a "suppressed the Fixer" now after the update it's listed as just the Fixer, and became basically worthless.
---
Everyone's legendary fixer was renamed to "the fixer"
---
I had 4 fixers in my stash Box all get renamed to "the fixer"
---
 None of them lost any stars. I have a very hard time believing yours did as well.
---
I actually really like everything scaling with you my only complaint is I wish I could get a respec since my builds literal garbage. Only level 25 tho I guess plenty of time to fix.
---
I have to ask, what experience do they have with online service games? Last I checked it was basically none. The only game that might be considered would be ESO, and that isn’t even Bethesda, that’s Zenimax. The Bethesda team responsible for Elder Scrolls and Fallout games did the initial launch of Fallout 76, but they’ve not ever been a part of ESO.
---
Thanks for the kind words,  just glad i could help you out!
---
I figure last season's will work just fine, although this season should be even easier than last season.
---
My team is still using sneak effectively against Earl but there's no hiding in many events because perception is boosted for enemies. It is crazy to nerf half of a servers players though for sure. I hate that sneak is unpredictable in most of the late game now.
---
Reinforcement training more or less. 1 post has a slim chance of being seen (many posts hit maybe 200 upvotes and fade away). 6 posts with 200 upvotes means there's a damn good chance managers will see it. 
---
A good example of this was when the building "fix" broke double wall placing, castrating a big chunk of the player base. The only reason this got fixed was because at least 2 dozen major posts went up about it on both reddit and the Bethesda forums.
---
I've heard people say this before and I am a bit mystified.  Does getting upvotes actually DO anything?  I mean can I spend them on stuff at a shop?  Do they help me in some way (cheerleader flair for 10000 lifetime likes for example)?  Are high karma posters favored by the algorithm the way that Youtube does it?
---
Or are people just silly and treat it like some sort of score?
---
Unreasonably hard because of the damage nerf. Without damage nerf I think that things would have changed and enemies would be somewhat a match for all of us. Hard enemies for hard players is what we should be having right now (hard enemies without any damage nerf).
---
The level of an enemy is based off of your character level.
---
This expands across the map.
---
Before Patch 22, certain areas would only have high level enemies, making them extremely difficult to explore for low level players.
---
Before Patch 22, high level players were killing enemies too quickly, preventing lower levels from earning xp and/or legendaries.
---
Fallout 4 consisted of limited ammo and enemies that were not easy to take down.
---
Fallout 76 used to be just an open world in Fallout, though it lacked the stress from enemies that a "Fallout" game usually has. Patch 22 has shifted the game towards an older Fallout feel in my opinion.
---
If you have an opinion that is different from others on this post and/or in this community, then state your points and be professional about it.
---
Simply attacking someone for their opinion and being rude isn't a valid way to express your feelings in this community.
---
I just use the level 1 one. Was able to scrap all my hacker and locksmith perks since it lets you unlock highesr tier for both. Unless you're lazy you dont need anything higher. Just the base is enough. Now you dont need to swap cards every time you find a safe or terminal.
---
The perk loadout mod really is one of the best mods out there. Everyone i know who ever tried it never went back.
---
Every time i see posts like this one about the coming loadouts from bethesda i recommend it. Im convinced whatever bethesda is going to put out regarding this, its not gonna be as good.
---
Maybe a bit more shiny, but again with a lot of breaking potential for other things. Everyone, use this mod and wait for bethesda to bring their solution 2021.
---
Cant wait to loose perk cards or even whole perk sets because i switch sets in a heavy battle and something is glitching...
---
You could explain your views in a much less confrontational manner and those wanting to learn would actually read your advice. seriously why the confrontational attitude?
---
Mmmm yessss thank you for this very sweet valuable info
---
I've rebooted a few times and the same, it seems to be distance related, at range, say not in the same room the gauss shotgun is doing great damage, too far it drops off (extended barrel fitted), but close up they become transparent to damage, weird.
---
I'll keep playing anyway, new to gauss and though buggy it is fun.
---
Nice.  I got it 6 months ago from a Forest event too.  It pairs well with Responder gear.
---
yeah, the story does get annoying after awhile due to the length of it.
---
Fair enough, but more often than not it's the first thing I see when opening the reddit (meaning it's a trending topic)
---
Level 23?  You should do a bunch of side stuff to gain a bunch of levels before continuing the wastelanders questline.
---
I have a few levels in the legendary perk that deals additional damage to enemies that attack me while sneaking. It SEEMS to work in Daily Ops, but I dont have any data to back that up. May be worth a gander though.
---
My pistol character seems to be doing better than the rest of my characters.
---
Thanks for all your replies..think I just figured out the rest of my setup..again TY
---
I think the only value of this plan is that for those of us who have a tough time letting go of unique weapons, the plan allows us to scrip the Gutter we got from playing, knowing we can always recraft one in the future. Even though there is no actual reason one would want the weapon. LOL
---
The waiter brings you your plate of food you paid for. The steak is fine. The potatoes are delicious. As you work through your meal, you go to bite into your roll and come to realize it's a rock.
---
Are you going to do nothing because the rest of the meal was good? I would wager you'd probably say something.
---
Like I say I got super lucky, Ebuyer in the UK went live at midnight instead of 2pm so I managed to get an order in then. Would have stood no chance at the actual launch time. I'm sure you'll be able to get one over the next few weeks, though.
---
And I'm running an R5 3600 while I wait for Zen 3.
---
Edit: Oh it's the Zotac Trinity. Reviews weren't out so I just bought the one I liked the look of best out of the AIBs; from what I've heard the Asus TUF is the best of the "cheaper" (aka near RRP) ones. Will say though, the card is hecking long, overhangs the motherboard quite a bit. So if you get one make sure your case is big enough or get one of the less long ones lol
---
Best thing I can recommend at that level is the Gatling gun. Very economical on ammo and packs a hell of a punch. If you are on PC I would be happy to hook you up with one. IGN oddROGUE
---
Try having a perk that repairs armor to 130% or more might help a little
---
Dude, I feel the exact same way. I keep telling people to either mix up their card or do something new, but no one listens
---
Just ran again solo, made 500 2mm EC, that is pretty amazing. Wish they weighed less. I didn't do it fast as I was bumbling about looting bodies 😎
---
Taking One for the Team can proc PvP if you have pacifist off. Had a guy do it to me last night at his own camp. Killed him and started shooting his camp before he logged since I've seen him destroying low level players camps with explosive bait before.
---
Yeah I can still run in circles around them and not be seen. No problems
---
Yes I believe I read something about durability loss based per hit instead of per shot before. I really hoped stupid things like this would have gotten changed with One Wasteland when they kept hinting multiple times at "combat changes". Didn’t think the only actual combat changes would just be the way they calculate damage stacking buffs...
---
I sell some for caps. I get more legendaries than I can sell for scrip.
---
"For our second game mode we’re looking into emphasizing stealth and sniper gameplay with fewer but more powerful enemies. Our goal with various randomizations is to make different players feel like the ‘hero’ for the day."
---
Yes, complaining does help. But if people then complain about what Bethesda does to improve it, it's pointless.
---
I'll go back to the argument of "make the game harder. No I want the game to be easy again"
---
What is today's mutation?
---
Yea don’t tell anyone lol but something fucked up where if ur in a team they can attack u without u attacking back to initiate. Happened after new patch. Look it up on YouTube. I forget guys name but he explains it. With one of the leg perk I forget it’s name too.
---
Because I'm tired of seeing the same complaints from people who either want to one shot everything or people who "can't get ammo". I've tried being polite many times. I'm done being nice when explaining what I've explained over and over and over. People are complaining to complain, and I'm very tired of it. That's why.
---
There's no problem.
---
It's more advantageous to keep Bethesda on their toes with constructive criticism than blind praise.
---
There's nothing productive about criticism without being constructive, but there's also nothing constructive about blind praise or trying to be defensive for a very big company.
---
If you're personally bothered by people upset voicing their grievances, maybe just take a break from forums, or ignore those threads.
---
Glory to the gunslinger
---
Calling whining “critique” fools no one but yourself.
---
Ok thanks for the information
---
Yes, but I wouldnt bitch at them from bringing me a roll afterwards now would I
---
The card illustrations are really neat, I'd love to read some graphic novel illustrated by this artist or design house.
---
Why
---
Ironic that you would tell the people that obviously care more about the game to go away. As these people wouldnt be complaining if they didnt care.
---
Seems to be an overall theme of this place.
---
I've started having hopes for this last patch as soon as I heard about a TSE weapons being bugged.. I was, like: "Here's my chance to play my fav Lever action rifle build! Yippee-ki-yay, motherfuckers!".  
---
And even with those bugs rifles are simply too slow, too janky, with inconsistent damage numbers, accuracy etc. etc. etc.
---
I'm not saying that I should be killing SB with 5 shots to the chest (I'm totally fine with having to reload a few times before downing a lvl75 SB), but not being able to shuffle glowing ghouls left and right on Radiation Rumble with maxed out rifle specific perks + all of the dmg enhancing perks (e.g. 5\* Adrenaline, Bloody Mess, Tenderizer, Gun Fu, **Glow Sight**) like they're made of paper, is an insult.. Commando build is absolutely capable of doing that for some reason, as even with a single shot that mofo is taking half of the HP down from a glowing one,  and yet with rifle, which has more dmg per single shot I can't do the same??? I'm sorry what?
---
Here's hoping that with the changed dmg calculation they will be able to bring their attention to something other than heavy guns and automatic rifles.
---
This^
---
Tank Killer works for pistols so if anything they are actually slightly better overall.
---
Scorched earth with 2 Mirelurk kings and a Queen and some random mirelurks was intense last night. My vampires gatling gun has become infinitely more useful post patch.
---
Turn pacifist on, atleast for the time being.
---
There is a bug with a legendary perk that allows pvp against someone in a public team, if the victim doesnt have pacifist enabled.
---
Nah, still broken. We may never see the day when it works
---
That's not a psa buddy
---
Hey, I'm old too. This game would be garbage without us old farts around to make dad jokes and so forth. 
---
About your Fixer, I hope you held on to it because just the name is gone. The effects are still there. 
---
Now, dealing with the trash isn't impossible. You need to take a look at how you're perked. Like me, your first instinct was to load up on quality-of-life perks thinking that just a little for damage would be fine. It's time to murder your children. Get rid of the QOL perks and fully rank up anything that improves how you want to play. 
---
For example, you like Power Armor then choose the cards that make it strong. You use VATS? There are perks to maximize damage there. Want to sneak around? Stealth and Covert Ops. Machine gun? Go commando. And so on. There are guides that will help because there's a ton of viable combinations to customize your build. 
---
Watching a video or two can be helpful as well. Not so much to copy someone else, but to learn how the cards can work together to make you unstoppable.
---
I sometimes wish they would make loading screens in this art style
---
I hated Travis before the quest, and I still hate him. Something about him just irks me, idk. I killed him so now Shang Kowalski is the host 😂
---
I've found the fire department to not be a good spot for lead for that very reason.  The big spots for me are the gyms in the nuke silos, the monorail elevator, the penitentiary, and the gym in the VTU test vault.
---
nice
---
Not sure why people are downvoting all the whitesprings comments. They're generally correct, but anywhere right in the middle part of the map is pretty good. I'm always happy to go to the middle of the savage divide for vendors
---
I love shooting my gatling gun while frozen and it feels like slow mo
---
I completely agree with you about constructive criticism. But no1 wants to say "Yes Bethesda, that was a good addition" let them know what they did right so they dont have to thumb suck it and try to guess
---
Oh my god yes
---
Thanks man, honestly wouldn't found that out. Just took that card off
---
Sorry to hear that it’s become so difficult. You’re not the only one at all as I‘ve read several threads about the mismatch in gun levelling and enemy levelling now which, amongst other things like one wasteland levelling everything so nowhere is safe, makes being a level 25-100 far more painful now than it used to be. This message is clear and let’s hope Bethesda chooses to do something about it.
---
Your weapons shouldn’t have lost stars though. The fixer thing is just a name change issue as far as I’m aware though. Check again and you should see the stars still there - if not that a separate perhaps more serious issue
---
45 is 37 rounds for 3/4/10 with some perks not all. thats not much materials at all. More than some others like .50 but you go through that like shit through a goose. Use the ammo factory legendary card and your golden. At 4 stars its 150% im only at 2 and using ammosmith make way more than i can use with little effort or materials. For 50 cal is 315 per 12/10/40 materials. Play smarter not harder.
---
Isn't there an online Skyrim game? Only one I can think of.
---
Exodus Crash + Blackout = Guess I'm not doing the Nightfall this week.
---
Yea, people actually played the game and formed their own opinions of it...
---
Also, I guess there were a *few* bug fixes along the way too...
---
You see the op commenter actually knows that Bethesda doesn't have any online game experience but that info wouldn't prop up his complaint and so it must be changed.
---
You know...Bethesda obviously didn't have a clue about what they were getting themselves into with an online MMO style game.  That's fine, to a point, you expect silly mistakes from beginners.
---
But it's been two years now.  Twenty two months.  They need to pull up their big boy pants and stop making these constant, easily avoided mistakes :(
---
The enemies are endless until you kill the boss. So more people would mean more guns shooting at stuff and defending during the uplink defense portion.
---
While I personally agree with you about picking a weapon and build around it. Not everyone wants to play like that, and for 2 years they were able to play the way they wanted. Should all the builders, traders, RPers, explorese, farmers and so on all just play the same way we do now... or F-off?
---
Sometimes you have to look at these posts objectively .. this update did affect all players, across multiple playstyles .. we don't know how big the group of players OP falls into
---
however, it's safe to assume this game attracts more casual/older/less twitchy/less competitive gamers than say dark souls does, plus these types of gamers usually have a steady income they can throw at whatever peeks their interest so I think his post has some merit at least
---
I think it's just another attempt at BGS to copy a mechanic from other online games without actually doing the legwork to fully understand their demographic
---
I played since beta and I can honestly say I can't even tell which gamer group I've run into more as each session I usually run into a couple people from different groups
---
Some just mill about and build shit, some just socialize and log out, some wanna repeat kill the queen and max out their toon, a few wanna just try starting fights and raiding workshops and others just wander about acting like this is a real apocolypse and randonly hand out chems and plans acting like their part of the national guard
---
I dunno maybe BGS will re-evaluate maybe they won't .. but for me, I fall into the group that used to create a new char and immediately run to the high levels to tag and level quicker and setup a nice foundation for my character for later levels efficiently so I can get to end game content quick as possible .. and this update hurt me as well
---
Many players haven't received their roll yet
---
I haven't noticed any change.  Do you move around? You can't stay in the same spot forever, mobs blind fire or swing blindly if they have a vague idea where the shots are coming from.
---
Take Cover was a mod in Fallout 4 🤣
---
Yes unless everyone in the event is sneaking. If anyone in a public event is in open combat, then sneak is broken, even though the damage numbers show the bonus. I was skeptical about this but there have been videos posted showing how time to kill changes regardless of what the damage numbers say.
---
You shouldn't give up so easy. I'm a level 416 bloodied build with all bloodied weapons. I was feeling the same way due to what I was hearing before the update, i gone to the point of re-downloading fallout 4. Yes, i lost over half of my damage output which means it takes a couple of more bullets to kill (even to blow up cars sometimes take 4 to 6 bullets before they explode. Past couple of days I have done the daily ops 4 times, 1st time (blood eagles in the vault i have never been in) took 25 minutes because I was too busy fighting back and getting excited watching every other enemy explode from head shots instead of paying attention to the clock, dieing a handfull of times didnt help.
---
Did daily ops 3 times yesterday (super mutants in the galleria). This time I was prepared, swapped out all my sneaking cards for more damage and life saving cards, I was like yeah lets go do this. So out of the last 3 daily ops I did, I only died a couple of times and each time I got the mid tier rewards im not really paying attention to the timer im too busy having fun.
---
Right now, yes. But the piercing gaze effect that raises the enemy perception won't be staying forever. Rumours are that the next set of ops will be stealth based
---
I know lol just thought you were the OP that got it completely wrong.
---
Personally I use the chem backpack mod, thru hiker 3 (agility perk), bandolier 2 (strength), and have at least 2 weapon reduction armors. I also tend to prefer the 90% weight reduction legendary effect if possible on rifles or heavy weapons.
---
I'm sure Julie is a nice person. She probably helps out here and there. Not gonna tell her to go die, but come on....
---
Can she kindly take a week long vacation into vault 94?! She's so annoying!
---
I dig, but we’re doing recon operations for a military organisation. I mean, stealth would be the most obvious solution to the problem right?
---
Someone just told me PvP can be engaged even with pacifist mode on, and that was my initial thought that there might've been a bug with a perk card
---
Yeah.  Sort of suggests there are a lot of problems, affecting a lot of people and maybe Bethesda should pull up their big boy pants and start fixing some things.
---
Oh, you are talking about the War Glaive, not The Gutter. 
---
My response was for The Gutter, as in the OPs message title.
---
I think the people who actually enjoy the game are the ones that say "yes, daily ops is awesome, but nerd not that good" whereas people who say "nerf bad, game unplayable I'm leaving now. Oh yeah, daily ops are ok" are worse, no?
---
I’ll have to look when I get home. It looks like a trunk.
---
But swole is the goal brah, that was clearly intended
---
There was an actual cover mod. They're talking about when you're in first person view up against a wall, and you aim, you'll peak around or above cover.
---
Ah
---
As far as I know karma does nothing.
---
He creeps me out. Telling me to touch his toe and play with his thumb or some shit
---
That is, what all the Bethesda warriors don't understand. In their small mind they think that if you vocal criticism about a game, you must hate the game.
---
They don't grasp that those people probably even care more about that game than they do.
---
I have a 2080ti xc hybrid and it handles a solid 60fps in 4k Ultra settings in Linux. Edit: congrats btw 🍺
---
What is this anti one shot thing?
---
I’ve seen it a few times but my Inst Exp hunting rifle still does a fine job of one hits.
---
Also, TSE guns might be the new fad because they deal out 2 damage numbers, so you can bypass the bug.
---
I think explosive does it too, maybe thats why I haven’t noticed it much
---
Loot after you down the boss, but before you bring up the stats.
---
Hang in there. With all the backlash Beth is bound to change it up again. They keep saying it’s a work in progress and this was just jumping off point so they can manage it better. Don’t ask me why they implemented the nerf AND one wasteland in same patch but guys on pts told them this would happen and they did it anyway. I feel for u but try to switch up ur build a lil bit and play on a team if u can until they come up with another fix/update.
---
There are mods to increase carry weight in power armor.
---
You need to get to level 300, not 250.
---
But the did though. They wanted something to do, then got the gold grind. People wanted a more challenging game and got one wasteland. The problem is everyone wants the game to be tailor made to them
---
Always scrip if you don't want it. The vendors will give you extremely small payments for weapons and armour so it isn't worth it. Plus, each time you scrip you get closer to getting that God roll from the purveyor
---
**PSA if you're going to complain people complaining about everything Bethesda does, maybe find a different game.**
---
Hey man. From the looks of your post, you might need to tweak your build to get more out of it. Casual or not, it never hurts to figure out where you're not doing as well as you could be and make adjustments to improve your QoL. I use Nukes&amp;Dragons for all my characters' builds; really helps you see the numbers. One Wasteland hit hard for some, and I'm also trying to adjust to the new normal of it, but I don't think it's unsurvivable. 
---
As for your Fixer, don't stress. My 3* Fixer also lost its name, but it's only a visual bug. 
---
Let me know if there's anything I can do to help. If all else fails, take a break for while and come back when there's fresh story/meta tweaks/etc. Best of luck out there.
---
Think about it, the events that we could do alone, now we can't unless we want to die much more or fail it. From my understanding, Radiation Rumble is a pain as it is to finish, but now that the weapons are weaker and the enemies are stronger, I don't think many people will be able to finish it as often.
---
I tend to gain not lose stims from these. The daily ops are about moving fast to each uplink getting them going, finding cover to defend from near the uplink and moving on. I think most people that are having trouble are having it because they are focusing on combat and not the objectives.
---
Hey, your fixers still have the legendary affects, they are just not named anymore, hopefully they fix it. As far as the other weapons, I have no idea how they lost their affect. I had this happen with one weapon, but it was more the level not legendary affect. Went from 50 to 40. I know what you mean though, I have a level 265 and a level 35. My armor breaks all the time now but I find it a lot better with my 265, my build (junkie/unarmed melee) got nerfed pretty good but it’s not nearly as bad as people in here were making it seem. My 35, I feel pretty useless being on a team. I will only be playing that character to meet the weekly requirement of leveling three times. I hope you stay and mess around with the different ways to either possibly rebuild or overcome the new challenges.
---
Pre-legendary perks you get much less .45 for the same materials as 5.56 and it takes so long to make a decent amount of it.
---
That being said, the first legendary perk that I picked was Ammo Factory.  I have it at level 3 (100%) and I'm loving it.  Should have it at level 4 in the next week or so with perk packs from the legendary run.
---
Thanks! I used a normal gatling laser no ultracite
---
It's really fun to play again.  Exploring areas that were cake walks before the nerf and One Wasteland actually requires thoughtful approach and care and can be challenging.  Who knew a rad rat swarm could make you run for high ground, even with explosive bullets?  And the Daily Ops?  Wow, what a challenge.  Have done a few solo and it's a serious battle.
---
The original concerns about enemies being bullet sponges after the nerf really  isn't even a concern now that Legendary Perks offer the ammo crafting skill.  And come on guys....the master infiltrator lock pick/computer hack perk is an absolute dream!
---
All in, I think this update is a HUGE improvement to the game and I feel shows that Bethesda does care enough to make the game fun and challenging for all levels.
---
Where do I get the mods for the glave??
---
It just works
---
You **should not** be able to 1/2 shot any end game mob, under any circumstance.
---
Your previous damage was exploiting the multiplicative effects of multiple items, and now you're upset that they legitimately fixed it?
---
Calibrated shock legs, emergency protocols chest, targeting hud helm
---
Those are your best bets
---
I hate that they already pulled the posting.
---
But there was a post yesterday with a link of a vid of the glitch group showing it, in vid they stated the victim needed to have pacifist off.
---
But it wouldnt surprise me if they found another work around that didnt.
---
&gt; So "learn to adapt" is the same as telling someone to change their skincolor (bad analogy, but it gets my point across), it's just not what you do. 
---
If this is honestly your take, I just feel sad for you.
---
I'm also a bloodied stealth main myself (commando) and it really doesn't take much to adapt at all. 
---
I'm not even talking ultra efficient min max build or god tier weapons and armour. I'm even running a food/heavy PA hybrid that is even less optimised for combat and that does perfectly fine.
---
It really isn't that hard to adapt. This is a softcore survival game. The skill ceiling really isn't that high, even with OW and damage changes. Just a few tweaks to how you approach combat and getting use to the "new normal".
---
If you need some advice, feel free to ask around.
---
Are they all 1 star, or did you get higher?
---
I'm fully specked for rifle and heavy weapons, not much space left for qol perks. This bullet sponge update didn't make the game harder or challenging for me, just more tedious, more grindy.
---
Well fck me, that's 4,000 bullion wasted last week on 2 characters that will prob need even wear the power armor. Thanks for the reply
---
I leveled up Ammo to three stars before I did my first Daily Ops, I may have waited if I knew I would get so much ammo but who knows, down the road I may get bored with it and need the Legendary Ammo card. I can still change it out with one of the other SPECIAL cards until I need it.
---
I’m a shotgun guy and honestly I’ll admit it does take me an extra shot to kill an enemy, I haven’t really seen the increase in difficulty other than me dying faster. Though I should repair my broken combat armor parts, just don’t have the ballistic fiber to do so
---
I'm going to try switching out all my perks and putting them back to see if its just wonky...I had alot of pink textures on first fire up after patch and had to clear cache to fix it...who knows...
---
Wouldn't be a bethesda game if when killing a bug they somehow create 10 others in the process lol. It's like that video of the guy crushing the spider only for it to release 100's of babies lol
---
Learn to aim then, if vats is omg so hard and unreliable occasionally, you’ll probably discover your great talent as a sniper and are able to outperform aimbot aka ‘vats’ and ditch it, voila no more misses and AP worries.
---
You can get most mods from certain vendors And perhaps some players, but iirc, targeting hud and calibrated shocks are rare sbq drops only.
---
It's more than just perks my dude. Let's say you're wanting to run bloodied, now you have to get 5 pieces of very good unyielding gear and also a decent rolled bloodied gun. The same with junkies and other builds and the RNG in this game is terrible. I can see how alot of people can see that this update is hard for them. I get tired of people saying it's easy with their legacy flamers and shit.
---
But general.... The minutemen need a strong leader in Appalachia. And we can take back the castle... I mean whitespring from the talking toasters!
---
PSA people who pay money for a product are entitled to complain if the product has faults.
---
For those of us who play Nuclear Winter we hold out hope that,  if we continue to support it , Bethesda will improve it. It would be cool if Bethesda would throw us a bone for our support-that's all.
---
When I started this post I had this fantasy that it would catch on and everyone would be asking Bethesda to give us some cool rewards in Nuclear Winter.  Bethesda would take our request seriously and give us some cool cosmetics as a way of saying Thank You. Ever the optimist am I.
---
I'll give my vote to commando but heavy is good too
---
This definitely did not need to be added to one of the many posts about this.
---
yeah bullet sponges .. for now at least couple tips
---
use a cryolator with the pellet mod tag it a couple times to freeze/slow critters
---
when they get close full sprint opposite direction and toss a molotov or anything else you have that does a damage over time while you're repositioning
---
when you shoot, hit the head .. or take out limbs(usually 2-5 shots per limb) till you hear the sound effect of it breaking, limb damage still does a lot then go back to shooting the head
---
but when you're not engaged make sure to use what's available for damage over time while it's running around, like molotovs
---
they need to seriously re-evaluate item durability loss after this update both weapons and armor break way too fast
---
My only issue with her is how insincere she sounds most of the time
---
This. It is just like the difficulty levels in Fallout 4. 
---
Harder difficulty is translated to bullet sponges = boring shit.
---
I had a weird thing happen yesterday. I had forager for a couple days then switched him out for Becket cuz he wouldn’t give me a quest for a few days. So I have Becket In my camp right , I go do a few events and things, I come back and now I have Becket and Forager is back! With a quest marker on him. I tried to get it to go but nothing. So I had two allies in my camp at same time lol. Prob not there after I logged off but still strange.
---
Literally nothing you stated , anyone complained about. They complained that every single enemy even the week ones are over powered and the weapons are less powered. Those are the two complaints I’ve seen. Idk what your going on about. Yeah I get it some enemies were too easy but when you have to unload two clips into a radroaches to kill it it’s too hard. If you and 6 people can’t complete a simple event it’s too hard.
---
Good to know, but they should seriously let people know about this. Especially the people who don't want to PvP or lower level players
---
First off I'm sorry the game has turned you away. I felt the same way as well when the update first hit Tuesday. I was upset, getting attacked at my camp by now level 50 scorched and molerats and I'm built in the forest. They nerfed bloodied builds (we knew was coming) which I ran and daily ops frustrated the hell out of me. But now I've played the update a few days, tweaked my build and it's not so bad. I'm even starting to enjoy the daily ops. You Just have to give it time and adapt. That's what this game is about, adapting to a new challenge and your surroundings and (grinding) lol. It was that way before the new update and will be the same after the next update. Instead of quitting or complaining. Find an in game solution.
---
Judging by this sub people are the most happy about free fast travel to Crater and Foundation. So no, they shouldn't listen to most people.
---
I like it, can’t wait to get one for myself. Yesterday I got no rare loot for my elder run :(
---
I always turn my light off in stealth too. Don't know if it makes a difference or not
---
Hey, I play 6-7 hours a day.  Would that make me engaged enough?
---
I feel for OP.  I too find this update to be a giant fun suck.
---
Don't bother looting until after killing the boss enemy to complete the event. Do you looting before you view your rewards.
---
I’d save them for tomorrow unless you’re overweight.  
---
On a side note, you may want to evaluate what you’re keeping in your stash. At level 250+ on my main, I usually have about 200 lbs free. 
---
You probably have a lot of stuff you could sell for cheap in your vendors or even to a vendorbot.  Or even convert to something useful. Like, how many missiles do you have in your stash, and how often do you use them?
---
The events already scale based on the number of people. They intended for people to be able to solo them. Hell, Bethesda even said we can play the game solo for pretty much everything.
---
Do you even lift, bro?
---
Any tips for a melee character?
---
I’d suggest you join a (now) causal group instead. You still don’t have to interact with anyone but you get extra int based on the number of other players, plus free access to additional travel locations (them, their camps, and their survival tents).
---
Instead of the Minutemen, which was very specific to the area, because of History.
---
I'd like to see maybe the Responders return. Or try and rebuild. 
---
Or something new. I like the history and lore of previous games. But I'm always up for adding more, over redoing the existing.
---
You have to care about something to complain about it. If you dont care you wont complain as nothing you care about is wrong.
---
Thanks, I've been watching Angry Turtle and Lone vault wander on You Tube. I honestly never paid any attention to perk cards and builds until recently. Several months ago someone told me "wow you're really bloodied" and I had no idea what they were talking about! I started learning about using perk cards to my advantage but wasn't sure how the update would play out. I guess you would say that now I'm leaning toward a heavy gunner... I have equipped some cards like blocker, which was really helpful because I was always being killed by ghouls.. maxed out that card, added adrenaline as well. I finally survive the white Springs golf club run without dying!
---
Who knew bethesda could be incompetent?
---
Oh. All of us. We’re fallout fans.
---
Not for  Radiation Rumble, trust me, I tried it and got my ass given to me.
---
I dont have any missile i dropped them for space
---
depends on which you need more, scrip or caps.
---
I’m not pressed for caps, and although my stash is pretty much full, my char can carry a rediculously large amount if necessary.  
---
Given that, I generally wait out the time gate.
---
I don't see the issue with levelling, if your over 100 then levels don't matter, play as you've always played and you'l find those levels just come faster naturally, the creatures won't get any harder or the loot any better, if your under 100 then you want to speed through to maximise your perk cards for the optimum 100 build, so higher xp from encounters helps a lot.  
---
Legendary perks are still not an issue either, you don't have to have them all maxed, they are a nice to have, and something to work towards at your own pace, no reason to rush them.
---
Thats the thing even if they do hate the game that eludes to the fact that at one point they whole heartedly loved it.
---
Hate is love turned sour.
---
I saw a post on here regarding cursor placement on map, the square when selecting ft point. If it is centered over target it seems to bug more. I have tried a few times and seems if you just use the corner of cursor it will help. 
---
GL maybe a coincidence but seems to help from my testing.
---
join a daily ops public team. someone will more than likely start one and you get a pop up which says something like your team mate is doing a daily op why not help them. and then you bring up the intel and click join team.
---
I was thinking of FO4.
---
I'm not upset. Did you read my post?
---
yes demo expert works with legendary prefix explosive, enjoy
---
Similar happenings since Fallout 76 dropped.  
---
It's a Feature...?
---
\-Todd Howard, maybe
---
That’s a cool idea. I will upvote because the post is refreshing compared to the usual bitch fest.
---
Wow, easy on the martyrdom dude. It's one ability that happens to go counter to stealth builds. 
---
It's not even a new concept. You'd probably think that cloaked Assaultrons are sticking it to all the VATS users or poison attacks are a direct attack on low health builds (stealth or otherwise).
---
People managed with those. It's no different with daily ops. It's just a tad more challenging, which ain't a bad thing for a game that is far too easy for a good portion of the community.
---
Bethesda isn't screwing over people's builds. They set a challenge that's specifically harder for stealth builds than other ones. That's it.
---
You really should let go of trying to be the victim. I'm a bloodied stealth build myself and it really is not that hard to deal with.
---
Yeah, that's my understanding as well, which leaves me at a loss to explain why people seem to think others are only posting for the karma.  I mean if it does nothing and is worth nothing, why on earth would someone care enough about it to active "farm" it?
---
If you can't switch over to PC just post your perk setup and explain the type of character you're looking to roleplay. I'm pretty sure I and many others will be more than happy to drop some ideas. Even if it's something like a lock picking, sniper farmer. There's definitely a build we can come up with.
---
Sure. Just take the underscore out of my reddit name, and that's me on there. It's for sale in my CAMP. I usually list plans for around 30-50 caps, and I'm not accustomed to selling things of value, so I'm not sure what a price is that's fair to everyone.
---
Wanna know what doesn’t make sense? Carrying all kinds of heavy weapons on you that magically appear out of nowhere
---
Use repair kits until you get your workbench materials.  Great to have them in the field and in battles.  Repairs on the fly!
---
You're never happy you lot.
---
it takes less than 8 minutes and it's basically lots of free stuff.
---
Vats unknown is a legendary alien blaster quest reward
---
It’s not very good but it’s the only legendary blaster in game
---
You buy them from Reg with bullion. 
---
They're at the bottom of his plan list.
---
I just dumped all my food and Good With Salt. Now I need to get rid of all the inert flux I saved for water. Certainly nice not having to care about that anymore :)
---
If you’re playing fallout 76, disappointment is common.
---
Yeah... first time you fight one of those beasties in Fallout 4 it usually pushes your shit in so far you gag...
---
Thanks for that Preston.
---
*Brah, I know, brah!  But it’s, like, maybe the chief honcho dev dude is, like, having trouble getting gains so instead of turning to his brahs for brah support, he’s, like, turning* **against** *his brahs out of frustration?!  Ya know?  I think he just needs some good brah support.* ***Never lift alone, brah.*** *Whether it’s the iron weights or, like, the weight of the world on your shoulders, brah, everyone needs a spotter.*
---
At this point I’m just saving up to make secret service armor, I have the chest piece and the jet pack. Just need the limbs and dee pocketed mod
---
Not OP, but after dying (often bloodied, in rads, fire, or other AoE dmg) you would half respawn, standing in one spot unable to move, and the UI saying you still need to respawn a second time. Your character can still get hurt and die again in this half-life.
---
If you were lucky enough that you could choose a place to respawn, and if the new location was close enough (i.e. didn't need a loading screen) then you would still be stuck in this phase. If you choose somewhere a little further (and need a loading screen) this would fix the issue until the next time you died, and then it would happen again 100% guaranteed. Sometimes only Vault 76  is selectable (and friends), other times all locations are available.
---
There was also a chance that, in trying to select a new place to respawn, it would say you were too overencumbered to fast travel so you would be stuck in this half-life with no way to get unstuck, but continuing to take damage until you force crash the game.
---
This was the most annoying bug for me. It would happen on about 60-80% of my deaths, and haven't had it once since the update. A sigh of relief from me!
---
I honestly have no idea! 😂 It's just my theory behind why some people feel the need to repost about the same topic over and over again.
---
Dude. Just remove all the daily caps and players will be pretty content. Time gates are stupid in a game i paid for.
---
Ah, gotcha. Thanks.
---
Wrong
---
You were able to encounter high level NPC in a lot of places, especially if a high level player already been there just before you.I have memories of very cool moments in a lot of interiors (like power plants, mines etc...), during quests or events for my very level at this time. I was level 25-30 and enemies were level 65.  That was really challenging, but fun. And the xp was good too.
---
My stealth rifleman still works perfectly
---
Specially BoS underarmor. It's designed for PA. I can carry more and hit harder when I get out of my fusion powered robot suit.
---
Okay, which bipolar side of the sub is it going to be today. The side that hates any and all criticism and doesn't think it's valid to criticize anything? Or the crowd that has way too many harsh criticisms, and doesn't consider any factors? 
---
Are there any normal casual Fallout fans here? I'd say it's about time we make our own goddamn subreddit for normal people.
---
I just got a comment that all events can be done solo, but I know for a fact that this one can't be. Not only that, but the optional quest is near impossible seeing how many rads you get.
---
You are getting +2, going from 10-12 in your pip boy. Otherwise it would be giving +4 for carry weight.
---
My apologies. Youre completely right. Honestly ever since Bethesda got ahold of fallout its been so much better.. I can't name a single bug or bad/poorly executed feature in the game at all
---
*Send help im being held at gun point by Todd. My coordinates ar-*
---
Seconded. 
---
So many people would lead much happier lives if they had the capability to just walk away from a video game.
---
Eh. I can't speak for you and your build but I have a food/heavy PA hybrid that's far from being both optimised or meta and it does just fine.
---
Also, I don't think melee is still king. Melee was slammed harder than other weapon types with the changes.
---
you get +2 to STR and you get+2 STR perk points to use
---
if your base STR is 15 though you wont get anything. it's the STR on your specials perk card page not the status page. like i have -1 CHR when not in a party but my base CHR is 5
---
“People” wanted a more challenging game. Yes, those who make this game an occupation and spend hundreds of hours carefully planning and constructing a character based off of internet guides and metas. In my opinion, the new update alienates anyone who just wants to enjoy the game. I shouldn’t have to look up a guide and have every character choice made for me. One wasteland made it so that every fight ends up with a negative return on resources. Why would you tailor the game around the minority of hardcore players? I’d understand if the game was designed this way from the beginning, but after just under 2 years, pivoting sharply so suddenly? I think One Wasteland should have been a different mode, like Nuclear winter. Then people could choose whether or not they want to die 15 times fighting a group of scorched in the forest. A lot of complaints are just whining, you’re right, but One Wasteland in particular completely alienated all but the most devoted and hardcore players. I’ve been playing since launch, stuck with it through thick and thin, and now I can’t play the game because I didn’t plan out every single perk point and card from day one.
---
To be fair, my bathroom was the first thing to go once I hit build limit
---
Okay, fair enough on the missiles.
---
But I guarantee you that you have more than you really need in there. Whether it’s excess ammo or aid or weapons or armor or ore or junk, I’d bet caps to snack cakes you could free up some room.
---
Yes I can build a fusion generator but not tie a piece of string to my back pack so it can fit over my PA?
---
If I didn't use survival syringes now I'd disagree with you whole heartedly. Symptomatic still seems cool either way and I still want it. Disease cures are lame though that 0.5 in space for each cure could be instead filled with valuable junk and one of my many heavy guns.
---
Probably not worth arguing about, but Bethesda Game Studios is also a subsidiary of ZeniMax.
---
Good to know!
---
Back when my squad played this together at the beginning of quarantine I was always on King Duty as the rifleman of the group because they could wreck my melee friend with ease. They were super tanky too and took ~8shots to kill with my explosive lever gun.
---
How would you not level up? Even if you don’t take cards, you are still leveling up.
---
I used them to level alts casually.
---
If i got away from vault 76 i was set.
---
I'm glad you had organized PvP but that was not how the majority used survival servers.
---
I could but like i dont know how to sell ammo effectively ive been trying to sell all my ammo for ages
---
IDK but whatever you do dont drop them.  I dropped all mine at once hoping that when I picked them up it would complete.  What actually happened when I picked them up was I cried because half of them dissapered
---
If people are creating a new character daily just to get the level up score, they've completely lost sight of the purpose of the game and should probably move on to something else.  It's a game.  It shouldn't be a waste of time.
---
This game runs under Linux?
---
yeesh .. well .. yeesh
---
My only suggesstion would be get a flamethrower, cryolater without mods so they spray an aoe cone in front of you or the plasma gun that sprays like flamethrower to at least get   a damage over time going then switch back to melee and block a lot more
---
try the legendaries where you vats aoe can cleave and enemies explode causing aoe damage
---
the one thing that really make melee hard is we have no dodge, no alt melee skills that provide iframes to evade damage, no base cleave and no stagger effect unless you use a power attack
---
.. so when 2 or more creatures swarm you they swing faster, do more damage and hug you with their no action point dependant run speed so you have to just stand there swinging away tankin all damage to the face
---
tldr: I would look into the cleave and exploding legendary perks and maybe a flamethrower/cryolator to soften them up while creating gaps to heal/chem up
---
ps also noticed another reddit user saying something about ricochet maybe that might help alil bit too since you'll be receiving lots more incoming damage then most ranged people 
---
[Richochet](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks/ricochet)
---
Yeah. I don't mind it not being a solo event, but relying on people who don't care to do the objective is very frustrating.
---
Welcome to the internet?
---
other things than targeting hud and emergency protocols?
---
Take my updoot!
---
The method with VATS and the Gauss rifle that I use works. This also works with bows. I usually only pull this gun out against boss types. The trick is to shoot within the first second you're in VATS.
---
For example, fighting Earl, find your cover spot and charge the rifle, enter VATS and shoot within the first second unless you have a really bad % shot. You can target other limbs during this time but you need to be very fast otherwise leave VATS and re-enter before firing. So I usually enter VATS and target the head ASAP. Find a spot I want to unload at, then it's full charge, enter VATS and shoot almost immediately. This 'technique' works with VATS crit too. You have about a full second maybe two at most to fire.
---
If this sounds like it's complex, it's really not. It's like a short combo move. I play on PC, but use an xbox controller and it's really easy to do this on the controller anyway. It can get weird when you get rushed by multiple enemies and when you re-enter VATS you end up targeting a random instead of the boss so be ready to swap targets fast, change location/change weapon, or just clear the trash.
---
This is not a real solution and Bethesda needs to fix this still, but if you are like me and really want to play a VATS crit build rifleman with a gauss rifle or shoot a bow, give this a try it may work for you.
---
Same can be applied to life in general. Rather than constant complaining, either remove yourself from the source of your complaint or work on finding a solution. Most people like this are just unhappy in general.
---
Sure I wanted a grind to keep me playing the game and got the gold grind. But it's kinda stupid that it would take me a month or two, to get a complete Strangler Heart PA set. Entire set costs around 6k in gold and can get only 200 a day.
---
I can’t say for sure really, just my observation.
---
Challenges aren’t gameplay. 
---
No we don’t need them more difficult.
---
Not for PS4 then.
---
Didn't you just complain about Fallout 1st and the atom shop in your post about being annoyed about others complaining? That's a a bit suspicious.
---
Yeah it sucks ass. It’s still doable but it takes all the fun out of the build to try and do it
---
Not that I am aware. Sorry.
---
10 weeks per patch notes.
---
This has nothing to do with the "feedback" they ignore.
---
And we will know **IIFF** this comes, when it's there. Not an iota before. There are too many instances where the announcements where proven to be false and where the promises where broken and the announcements just deleted.
---
List all your ammo for 1 cap per. If it doesn’t sell after a few days, use the ammo converter and make ammo you use or ammo that did sell. 
---
The only ammo that you should list higher than 1c is cores. If they’re full, try selling them for 75c. If they sell quickly, raise the price a bit. If not, lower the price.
---
I ended up respeccing. I was already one foot in the door with vats and stealth being so buggy as it was.
---
You can create a mule character and stash them on that.
---
I figured but it would be cool for us. ☺️
---
It shouldn’t matter much now with one wasteland tbf
---
Ok ill do that thank you
---
Still not nearly as bad as the 6 ranged enemies with 1 health that force you to leave the booster or get shelled.
---
Lol, you're 2 reasons are not applicable for ppl struggling to get to level 50, the hardest hit group from this patch.
---
Enemy hp triples from level 13 to 24.  That's some lazy shit.
---
The new player experience is horrific.
---
But if bethesda "pull up their big boy pants and start fixing things" for every complaint the game would go no-where, every bloody build wants to be Op, every non bloody build wants them nerfed, every PvPer wants to be able to grief, every adventure mode player wants PvP gone entirely.  
---
Some people want a full CAMP overhaul, some people want CAMP building gone entirely, people complained there were no NPCs, then there were people complaining that they were adding NPCs...  
---
The issue with listening to complaints is that if you dont have a problem you remain silent and are probably playing the game and enjoying it, if you have a problem, you dont play and band together on reddit instead to complain about it.  
---
Theres no real way of gauging just how popular an idea actually is (no matter how much reddit loves to think its the be all and end all of conversation) a lot of people simply do not use reddit
---
I hate posts like yours. People are allowed to have constructive criticisms of games they like.
---
The reality is that Fallout 76 is an amazing and wonderful game with absolutely sh.tty UI and problematic implementation. People who complain about these things on Reddit and YouTube are most likely the only reasons that1 Bethesda hears about them and 2 eventually fixes them.
---
The pure haters are wrong, sure. But so are you pure fanbois. Stop attacking people for using social media to try and hold the developers accountable for cleaning up the garbage aspects they release into what is otherwise a very solid game.
---
The good news is Bethesda is implementing this into the game. Bad news is it just got pushed to 2021.
---
I will give this a chance. I played yesterday and was down on all my ammo and other resources within two hours. I feel like I'm forced to use one of those annoyingly OP min/max builds (like bloodied.) It seems like I cannot play this game casually anymore.
---
"If you don't like the countries laws, move"
---
Just because there are things you are unhappy with doesn't mean you should turn your back on it. People are complaining because they have loved Fallout and Bethesda titles for years. And we can all agree there is still bugs in a game that has been out for a while now. And there are many elements to the game that players are unhappy with. Just because they're a business doesn't mean they shouldn't listen to their customers.
---
The only thing that actually doesnt work 100% for me is atom shop. It shows everything free but it isnt. If you know the prices and have atoms you can still buy things though. Personally I dont use atom shop very much at all so it isnt an issue for me.
---
Yup ran into this when the update dropped. Guy was taking potshots at my wife while she browsed vendors (who didn't have that perk).
---
I didn't have pacifist and went to see what was going on, once he shot me, we were in PvP and his turrets started shooting at me.
---
I started destroying his house and he force quit super fast lol.
---
lower the xp gains and drops from enemie add xp per ore collected and when depositing you get a random amount of loot/xp based on enemies others have killed. 
---
people have even less incentive now to go for ore with enemies being levelled. joined one the other day and it was 50 seconds in and already 2 dead scavengers and 1 nearly dead. By time i healed them the other was nearly dead. 4 people were camping on one side. and only one person was collecting ore. I was so tempted to just let the scavenger die but it wouldn't have been fair on the one person collecting.
---
oh and add some kind of tutorial in the game about friendly fire and shishkebab healing. make it a constant pop up on the loading screens or whatever
---
I have it go thru all 23 levels every time. it is infuriating, especially when you get into a fire fight.
---
I thought this was going to read: Good news is Bethesda is implementing this into the game. Bad news is BETHESDA is implementing this into the game. 🤣
---
Did you try the shotgun cripple strat?
---
Still works for me fine
---
Near the whitespring station
---
If I need to keep herding the cats, I just keep spamming the follow me emote. People seem to get the message...
---
Even after getting Elder rank, if you re-rerun it, you get legendary weapons, a big XP bump, most of your ammo back if not more than you brought in, and a care package full of stuff you can sell or scrap if you don't want it. I think this is a nice set of incentives to run a Daily Op again after hitting max rank.
---
I understand that.
---
Here's my problem. I wear only BoS underarmour, that's designed for PA (no other armour pieces, no legendaries). And I can carry more and hit harder when I get out of my fusion powered robot suit.
---
Can i ask why I would need to level up?
---
Now, it's getting perk coins. Before there wasn't much point when you had your build set.
---
👋👋
---
Pride.
---
[The interface asks me to 'level-up'](https://i.imgur.com/q5thdPK.png)
---
Was just thinking this lol. They dont need to change daily ops at all. They need to build on it, as in its a great activity so add more activities like it. 
---
Maybe have bigger raider/foundation themed ops we can do daily alongside the one we have.
---
The bubblegum. I do it for the bubblegum.
---
The radio has always been one of my favorite parts about Fallout but for the past months I’ve been playing i havent even turned it on. Just so repetitive. Music is good but after the 1,000,000th time its just not the same.
---
It is essential for bloodied builds in some of those Daily Ops, I think. Ricochet + Serendipity + Dodgy and you're doing fine.
---
It's the same circle jerk in every online game. I'm a big destiny fan but my god the circile jerk every new xpac or season is the same there.
---
"Let's thank the devs for this update"
---
2 weeks later "why would they change this"
---
4 weeks later "omg do they even listen"
---
2 months later "there not listening let's all protest vs a dev during a pandemic cus were all cry babies"
---
3 months later new patch drops "let's thank the devs for this update".
---
And the cycle repeats. Every online game reddit sub is legit the dark souls cycle, the location and people might change but the outcome is the same flawlessly ever single time.
---
I’ve used Rank 3 of the perk on my Bloodied Commando in and out of Power Armor. It procs fairly often, but the Mysterious Savior always shows up to revive me after I have already died. 
---
So short and sweet it doesn’t work at all for me. At least my Bloodied character dies before the revive every single time. I just use the Ricochet perk in Power Armor now instead of it. Doesn’t revive but it helps mitigate damage.
---
Ah so you level regardless of selecting the ['level-up'](https://i.imgur.com/q5thdPK.png) option?
---
If you're going to complain about people complaining, maybe you should find a different internet.
---
Excellent post
---
Perk coins and bigger e-peen bragging rights. 
---
We have known that legendary perks were coming and that it was tied to levels since last year, so that was 99% of the reason before and now.
---
The games that do that allow you to change classes by going to a class changer or just by going into the menu, however this game has to spend your level ups if you want to change your class.
---
Sneaking in this area needs to be removed or all people would do is sneak to their objectives and wait and not worry about fighting at all except the end and get easy rewards.
---
The best sneak builds can do in this situation is put on PA. (EP if bloodied)
---
This is not going to be the last content Beth will be putting out so I’m sure they will make some types of missions that make stealth OP like it has been the entire life of the game.
---
Calibrated shocks and emergency protocol plans for Ultracite are \*very\* rare drops from the SBQ fight, don't think I saw them in a player vendor yet. If it really must be Ultracite, you probably have better chances to ask around if someone can mod the pieces for you.
---
I run a generalist build with a bias toward sneak/commando, and I'm doing okay now that I'm figuring out the new system. Hang in there.
---
bethesda has never developed a multiplayer game before. nor worked on one.
---
You chuds are simply not understanding the problem.
---
Not since the update, somewhat fearing that one... as right now to keep myself alive longer, I need to wear power armour.
---
I switched to Tenderizer when they added public teams
---
I would suggest not doing this. The ammo perk is nice. I have the base card but it is WAAAY to expensive to max just for the QOL of extra ammo. 
---
Also swapping the legendaries in and out if you don’t need to is just dumb. You really use two perk points every time you need ammo?
---
I have the perk maxed and play daily ops, it is still an issue, it's just not as bad as everyone is making, Daily Ops takes me about 1k of 2mm I recover around 130-140 from the bodies (many only drop 4-8 rounds when they die) and the payback from completing the event gets me around another 200, so 330-340 I lose a full clip every Op, ammosmith lets me regain that clip by crafting 10x, provided I have the 50 lead and 150 steel!  do you know how hard it is to actually farm lead, when everybody on the server is trying to do the same thing, remember the Atlas concrete debacle...  yeah now it's lead and Bethesda aren't going to jockey the numbers round for that.
---
I don't get it either.  I've gotten countless hours of enjoyment out of this game and this latest update has upped the fun and challenge again.
---
Looks cool, but not as cool as an alligator wearing an explorer hat hanging outside of your backpack which I traded mine for ;)
---
See that spec ops suit is what i want the most. But it’s like a .22% drop on paladin and 3.6% on elder. And i haven’t been able to get it because every single time i try, people just keep leaving the area and it takes forever for the ticking to go up, and then it just goes past the 8 minute mark, again because literally every team i’m on just does not know how to play the objective.
---
That's awesome.  Thanks for tip.
---
The people who are complaining are the ones who are still willing to give Beth a chance to improve.  the people you are talking about *DID* find another game.....
---
on xbox at least you can message them from the map.  but pip boy would be cool too.
---
PSA: IF people are going to drop their own money in to a game, they are allowed to have an opinion on the matter too.
---
I cancelled my FO1st a little while ago and it's taken some getting used to not being able to drop a tent wherever anymore, but it has steered me towards cleaning out my stash of unused items little by little and stop being such a hoarder. I completed wastelanders on my main but can't bring myself to bother on my second character. That's fine, my main is a strength build and , IMO, more fun to play in general that my stealth commando. I've also started playing more in PA now that unarmed has been taken down so much and I'm enjoying it well enough. I haven't tried SBQ or Daily Ops or anything like that yet since P22, maybe this weekend. I don't know, I still just run around kill stuff to unwind after work here and there. It's a game, don't take it too seriously....
---
I shall try. I want to be able to play future updates without it being a chore. How did you fix it?
---
Oh really? I got plans for a legendary assault rifle yesterday that was previously only available in survival mode or nuclear winter. I thought I was about to make bank selling copies of it.
---
All ultracite power armor mods only come from scorch beasts (very, very rare) and the scorchbeast queen (common but the ones everyone wants are very, very rare)  the piece parts are available from a terminal in fort defiance after you complete the vanilla BOS quest chain but also drop from sierra bravos and are the most common ultracite patterns to drop.
---
The incentive to farm it is even greater, not sure what you're talking about. High level ghouls give greater XP and max level loot.
---
Random Thoughts, The First 5 Levels:
---
1. **Disappointing**:
---
   1. Dear diary, a bee swarm broke my leg and 4 of them nearly killed me and used up all my ammo and stimpaks
---
   2. Ammo is a little scarce when you start out!
---
   3. Ugh, this water tastes like irradiated shit.
---
   4. Mobs that don't actually scale correctly.
---
2. **Cool**:
---
   1. At least beds are a viable and helpful thing again. It's slow to heal, but it's free.
---
   2. Being a 1st Sub really helps.
---
   3. Bot Scavengers are so helpful.
---
   4. Actually moving my CAMP around.
---
3. **Exciting/Annoying**:
---
   1. Having to scavenge again since every little bit counts. Man I have to scavenge.
---
   2. The thrill of finding plans that you don't know. Shit I don't know any go-to plans.
---
   3. Opening card packs means something again!
---
4. **Nice**:
---
   1. ~~The fact that I can range across the map to places and not get totally smoked.~~
---
   2. I never would have made it to foundation as a level 3, nor killed a silo code carrying officer scorchie.
---
5. **Damnit**:
---
   1. I forgot what it was like to be broke.
---
   2. Guess I'm back to selling Handys behind The Wayward.
---
See you in 5 more levels.
---
EDIT: That's not right... I'm level 6 and I thought mobs were supposed to scale?  This mofo chased me all over the place and 130 rounds and 5 stimpaks later, I managed to kill him for 35xp?
---

---
(It's a level 20 blood eagle predator)
---
You bizarro ultras aren't understanding why this is a massive problem. Your notions of what this game is for many people is absurdly wrong, but again, enjoy as FO76 starts dying.
---
&gt; If someone joins the OP in the middle of the part with the progress bar it stops it from moving
---
Technically Bethesda's. There's no way that's a 'feature'.
---
Complains about people complaining, then proceeds to list the "valid" complaints lol.
---
That is in my opinion a misleading description then, that i get more strength for carry weight is a normal feature of a perk point i see on the specials perk card page, not required to be mentioned, so the text should be simple like  "+2 STR Perk Points. Perk Points cap at 15. "
---
I have mine in whitesprings
---
I will be on in 6 hours (currently at work) 
---
Here is a tip. Have x3 people on uplink at all times. Than you just have to worry about the boss at the end, if you can kill the boss in 60 seconds its going to be under the 8 minutes.
---
Meh, played it through on release, bored the shit out of me so didnt play it again for over a year. Gave it another chance recently and was surprised at some of the changes and really enjoyed it. Now it seems like a grinding chore again since this last update so i'll turn it off for another year or so and see what happens.
---
As for sucking it up and playing with a team I hate the multiplayer aspect of this game and the only reason I keep giving it another go is because I have been such a huge fan of the franchise for so long that I dont want to let it go. Deep down I know this game is going to go the way of the elder scrolls where they'll probably never make a new game just keep adding content to their online multiplayer game....... I should probably just push it out to sea and shoot it with a flaming arrow.
---
Perk coins and SCORE rank.
---
If youre dying 15 times to a group of scorched maybe its time to turn in your characters pip boy and send him out to pasture.
---
For the most part, no, I'm saying high level players have little grasp on why this patch is devastating for most other players. But go on.
---
Ok, thank you
---
You don't stop getting stronger after 50. To make a good build you're probably gonna need another 15-20 levels to buy cards and move points. You may even need more depending on how borked your build was. Adding 3 ranks of bloody mess increases your damage a lot. some ranks of gun fu and adrenaline add more damage. 
---
and now perk coins for legendary perks. and perk points if people want to change their build. Or add something to a build.
---
Its about how they do it, not the game itself. We support these games and have supported bethesda and it doenst feel good when some feel they got scammed.  Just go to another game, wont solve anything, it will only allow them to keep doing scams. We complain because we care, and idk what you mean with complain, its simple critism and tbh, those people who "complains", also beta testing their game not only for free, but actually PAYING to do so. We care about future gaming, and if no one says anything, nothing will be improved either.
---
Bruh you don’t need to ‘join a build’, you just need to optimize your perks a little better for combat and look for a more effective weapon. Power Armors are also tankier than vanilla armors, you’ll die less for sure.
---
Well, there’s an easy way to deduce that. See if the complaints relate to problems that are actually in the game.
---
- I get 250 SCORE each day for leveling up. 
---
- I get 100 SCORE whenever I get 10,000 XP.  
---
- I get more perk cards available to modify my build as needed/wanted. 
---
- I get more level ups banked to change my stats if I need to. 
---
- I get more perk coins to rank up my Legendary perks. 
---
- XP is also just a side benefit from gaining more loot, better legendaries, running the new content, playing with friends, etc. 
---
Until legendary perks came out, on my main I didn’t worry about how much XP I got. It was only ever for the daily/weekly challenges that I cared if I leveled up. And to be honest, I could always do that on an alt if desired.
---
Its intended they said it
---
It's easy solo, easier with a full team.
---
I don’t get the “gold grind is too long” complaints. You can’t trade plans or weapons from it, why would my dedicated Rifleman with a whopping 3 strength want plans for the Gauss Minugun I can’t use effectively? Why do I need SS power armor when I don’t even use my T-51? Just get the stuff relevant to your build and move on. Don’t dilute your legendary drops with guns and armor you can’t use or sell.
---
many players received a ball of dough.   i guess thats better than a rock, but does that mean that the waiter shouldnt be called back over?
---
I have to admit I was skeptical until it happened to me. Before the update I was starting to see it a lot - either I would get a shot that would take out most of their health and it would just immediately start healing again or I would hit with an automatic weapon, score many hits but not quite kill them and the health would come back up again.
---
It certainly wasn't every time but it was enough that I actually noticed it.
---
Haven't done that kind of damage to anything after the patch as I'm not a bloody build or anything that can do those big fast hits so don't know if it's still around.
---
Theres a difference between a valid complaint (something that needs to be worked on and is being ignored by Betgesda) vs bitching (complaining about one thing then complaining about it being worked on)
---
Some things still need to be tuned. Some enemies need their shit nerfed (gutsies come to mind, and I think charred ferals too personally), Weapons could use a slight buff, melee especially, and durability needs to be increased for most things (why do my legs _always_ break faster than the rest, even before 1WL).
---
Three Dog would like a word
---
Yup I found that. Shotgun to the face does no damage anymore. I am very close to getting rid
---
Weekly challenges do feel like weekly challenges to me. I complete them on day 1 and watch the timer count down to next week.
---
Funny I was also leveling up a sniper alt, mid 20s are super rough and slow now
---
“Modder placed”. We all know you placed it exploiting a glitch. Enjoy rebuilding your camp.
---
For me, I have everything set up the way I want, even my legendary perk cards. I'm just playing to unlock the greenhouse set on the board and I do daily ops once a day to get elder and that's about it. I just log on long enough to do that and get my dailies.
---
Modder? Huh. No way to do anything but rebuild.
---
you're SOL
---
The only place that isn’t safe for a level 100 Deathclaw is a scorchbeast spawn.
---
that's how I felt
---
Last time I checked, yes it is. My friends and I always had the same songs together
---
Agree with other posters - additional weeklys gives people with limited time during the week the ability to catch up on weekends, as it were.
---
Also seems like there are more weekly challenges, but the ability to complete 5 of the daily score challenges for 250 score reward takes (me) much longer. I’ve managed 4, but only got the 5th one day because I leveled up.
---
 The addition of complete X daily ops, and complete 5 daily challenges....those two take more time than I typically have during a given play session during the week.
---
  A couple of the other easier ones sem to have gone away, so getting the 250 score bonus for completing 5 daily score tasks is not as much of a given as it was last season.
---
Last Night (on PS4), I ran across a L3xx players camp just above Sutton train station. completely decorated with \_everything\_ from the current score.  It was a complete glass house, the score map, the train diorama, the shooting gallery, all of it.  So either someone had a whole lot of atoms to buy levels, it was a dev, or the player never sleeps....
---
I don't see how that relates lol you can still use power armor and craft/equip a low level shotgun to cripple all the glowing ghouls legs 
---
Then just grab all the ore and wait til a few seconds before the event ends to drop all the ore off
---
Ezpz, just a little tense making sure you cripple all the ghouls fast enough, but with vats targeting it's alright
---
The liberators are chinese death machines made to kill, don't feel bad about it. Try changing your approach to them
---
Mines at level 4, so I hope not.
---
So grateful, thanks again
---
Its a post legendary world now and even before it wasnt so bad if you set your mind to it. Grab every gun and steel junk you can and scrap it. I had to sell more bulk than i used honestly. Steel was the killer as lead is everywhere if you look. It was the sheer volume of steel needed. And cheap at whitesprings if you had the caps. I just adjusted my play style a little and never had an issue using lever actions and combat rifles tbh. My collectron also gave me a decent supply too for a rifleman that is. The daily ops and legendary cards are what broke the ammo economy. After a shred through a few daily ops i have way more ammo than i started with using any weapon. People crying about the ammo factory are ignoring that Bethesda broke it even worse that a few people with ammo factories ever could.
---
Edit the stimpack economy is completely destroyed now as well. I never had so many before. A few dailies and again im up to my eyeballs with them. Get dozens per run. My only complaint its what to do with them all now as i max out vendors so fast and their worthless.
---
I don't mean to brag but I think I can count on one hand how many times I've died in this game in the last 150 levels. So it's likely a lot of people never even noticed this.
---
Is there not a time out, I panicked. I'll do as you say 👍
---
She should have a quest like 3 dog that allows you or someone to kill her for the session.
---
haha complaining about complainers hahahah EPIC simply EPIC my friend :O &lt;- my soy face hahahah
---
Another wad straight into my bubblegum bathtub
---
Fuck ya, I’m saveing up all of mine.
---
What they’re playing at is very simple - the game systems are being engineered in such a manner that make it more grindy - now you need to grind for more ammo, more stuff to repair the greater wear and tear in your gear, more meds and it takes longer to kill enemies. In other words you have stay logged in and play longer than before because this is how they measure player ‘engagement’ - the mistake you’re making is that you’re confusing that with ‘enjoyment’. Welcome to live service!
---
Reddit is a soapbox for the vocal minority to yell and scream and complain and get what they want. This specific subreddit had also been plagued by people who fabricate problems that don't actually exist in game (stealing someone's inventory for example), or are grossly over exaggerated. Then you have the people who take over a workshop with a sh*t build, get owned, and instantly get on Reddit to whine about how unfair the game is.
---
&gt; Protectron Radio host commenting on the game's action 
---
They could have a wholesome "Old World Blues" shout out. Dr Mobius could have built a bot that would eventually (game lore) become a satellite radio dj. Brings music from other games, comments on lore, doesn't understand the human experience, friends with a toy alien nicknamed 'Allen' due to mispronunciation.
---
Different factions could "overpower the signal" of Applachia Radio and static cut to news. Enclave nukes, bos daily ops, rose threatening whomever took her chems. Then they could even implement narrow frequency areas across the map where faction members dis other factions, gossip, call each other out, taunt, share recipes, solicit advice from a random npc with a 'Mr Handy live on the scene.'
---
To implement it into quest format before you can access the new stations; player gets a random encounter with a tip off of Julie's location, she has you nab a cache, she rewards you with nukashine and a mod to permanently upgrade your pipboy. Call the quest line  "Goooodmorning West Virginia!" and slap.
---
(*cough cough* PS Sh-Boom (life could be a dream) *cough cough*)
---
Nice.
---
Gonna follow your advices my man.
---
Does this works for a rifle build?
---
Already doing that.  But most bodies had 20 or fewer rounds, so that is a loss of about 130 rounds per enemy.    The ammo recovery was more even when using the Tesla rifle,  but it just doesn't have the range.
---
IIRC some areas still have minimum/maximum levels for enemy spawns, even with OW.
---
You could try to invent a time machine go back and not exploit!
---
These drones do not take criticism of their cult of Bethesda lightly
---
Ive been having similar issues. Using my Fixer especially they would drop like flies only to shoot back up to full hp or sometimes no damage is dealt despite the numbers showing a direct hit.
---
An unfortunate choice of response to failing to see a joke.
---
Yeah hopefully people will learn..
---
It is doable with two. My buddy dropped out during the first signal boost and rejoined as the second signal boost was ending. We had about 30 seconds left. The trick really is to just focus on the goals and ignore all creatures unless you are boosting the signal.
---
I have no idea how people are saying they are soloing it in sub 7 minutes, it just seems like the boost bar is too slow for that.
---
Nerd Rage is nowhere near 80% damage boost, more like 20% iirc
---
Karma is everything. Karma is love. Karma is life. And it has a 300% return!
---
Why did you let ‘the modder’ do that?  Why did you let someone you don’t trust onto a private team with you?
---
Lucky Hole
---
What also doesn't help is that melee attacks often miss the target and even when it says they hit they don't take any damage, so that's a real pain. So levelling up the enemies is all and good, but they should fix the bugs like that first.
---
No thanks to Beth :)
---
Appalachia.... The final frontier. These are the numerous voyages of the bog ship foodbuildaprise. On its journey deep into the heart of scorchbeast territory to hoard screws and complain on reddit. Sorry just had to!
---
Talk about some work... I can barely do 4 walls and a porta potty right.
---
Well said!
---
He's hoping for some free atoms in exchange for the shilling
---
I just killed the boss with bloody ultracite gatling and the daily op gave me 12 gamma rounds. 
---
The vampire gatling plasma works fine on the other end gives me plenty of plasma cores. 
---
Going to try later with a normal fusion gat.
---
Will report back
---
One wasteland works fine, its just peoples inability to see themselves as the problem. Oh i was fine before this patch regulated the broken damage and now I'm barely cutting it. Instead of playing around with their perk cards they all came out of the woodworks to complain. 
---
My TTK with my bloody commando is still fairly quick
---
My TTK with my bloody heavy is still fairly quick
---
My TTK  with my Junkies Heavy gunner is still fairly quick
---
I'm sorry you played fo76 like it was fallout 4 and just slopped random cards into your special and called it a build but with most games in this genre where those choices matter you shoulda planned ahead.
---
Yeah, I encountered that crap during the B.E.T.A. nonsense. It’s nothing new. Definitely annoying, but not new.
---
Or the metabitch?
---
No really someone in my team placed it in my camp
---
Yeah I knew that,  guess I should have worded differently but it basically makes assaultrons / encrypted a walk in the park. Just feels like something they will scale back after realizing it's kind of too op.
---
Based on previous experiences they'll release them November 1st
---
There’s rageing and then there’s constructive criticism. When people do the former they get shot down either way. There are some good points that a few people bring up about the update. Sometimes it’s better to allow Beth listen to the whole community.
---
One of the points I heard which would make lower levels have a easier time is to make it where enemies are scaled to half your level. So lvl 150+ will be able to fight 75 and 100 enemies ( which is the current enemy cap ) while a lvl 50 can fight 25 to 50 and not be overwhelmed by 50 or lvl 75 ( 100 rarely )ones when their not geared that great.
---
Killing stuff and leveling while low level doesn’t flow good at all. Some mobs feel like a brick wall to them. There are instances where lvl 10s and 20s are running into lvl 40 mobs even though their ghouls and what not. Adding on top the damage nerf it’s a worse experience.
---
There are still things they need to iron out but overall this is the step in the right direction.
---
Lucky Hole Mine, collect all the lead ore while wearing excavator PA for double amount. Then equip super duper before smelting it. One run usually grants between 600-800 lead and only takes 10 minutes, you will need acid.
---
If it bothers you so much, why do you come to this subreddit?  I don't get it.
---
I'm not your buddy, pal
---
&gt;people have even less incentive now to go for ore with enemies being levelled
---
that what i said
---
Is that the card worth 3 ps5's?
---
If so that's insane.  That card is worth more than my entire ps4 generation of hardware and games.
---
As ex pc gamer, congrats
---
The weights are missing because Bethesda Is borrowing em to figure out the Weightbench bug...
---
I’m sure they’ll put em back when they’re done.
---
Favorite the Chinese Stealth Suit and immediately put it on with the quick wheel. It's a pain to put all of your armor back on but you'll survive
---
As far as I understand it, the multiplier is based off the baseline unmodded weapon damage. I believe weapon mods get additively lumped in with the rest of the buffs. Recalculate off a base fixer and see if the numbers are closer.
---
I’m using it, I’m loving it , I saw all the statements that it’s intended... but I still can’t believe it’s intended ... but I’ll continue to use it
---
Exactly. I’ve been using Excavator with calibrated shocks for a while now but I’m about to finish my T-65 set so I’ve started inventory managing to make sure I won’t be overweight when I switch
---
Ah nice, good to hear. Thanks for the heads up!
---
You're not the only one i heard this from. Can somebody explain how that is possible?
---
I don't think fallout 1st is overpriced, you get more than your money just in atoms. You also get the scrap box (which you don't need first to use) and the survival tent.
---
I think we should get a shower skin for it. I need a clean wasteland shower!
---
It can't be crafted as a legendary weapons, but after you learn the plan you should be able to obtain legendary variants from The Purveyor, obtain them as quests rewards or from legendary enemies.
---
Edit: typo
---
Yup! It's sort of poor wording on the UI. Every level you gain, you can pick a perk card/upgrade your SPECIAL. You get some new cards to pick from every time you do. It's not really worth banking them so to speak until after level 50, when you've unlocked all the selectable perks, etc.
---
Not a hack... Glitch with a certain Legendary perk. Put pacifist on.
---
Precisely. Post level 50, what do levels mean? Perks. This is fine until you gain all of the perks you could ever use (and more!). Then what do levels mean? Well, now they're fodder for legendary perk points, plus unlocking legendary slots I think? And once you have those maxed out? Eh... 
---
If it weren't for daily challenges, I wouldn't bother. This adds about an hour of grind to my daily routine, once more. Luckily daily ops seems to be offsetting the grind, so hopefully those will stay fun for awhile.
---
lol yeah... they forget we like to play other games too,
---
I've kept my Bow build, and do still run it from time to time, as my build has 14 STR, 13 PER, 4 CHA, 6 INT, 11 AGI and 14 LCK, I am now able to do Heavy guns, one-h, two-h, commando, bows, shorties, snipers, pistols and auto-pistols as I wish. I did rearrange the points to get full usage of the Legendary SPECIAL points, but I don't feel to bitter about that. One 2x exp weekend with hardcore grinding, lunchboxes and Herbivore buffs net me +100 levels, and more exp boosts are coming.
---
Id probably take the 3 off of Adamantium Skeleton. If Adamantium Skeleton would also prevent you from getting staggered it would be worth it but sadly it doesnt. If you are a stealth sniper and are close enough to get in melee cripple range, you are more than likely going to use a stimpack anyways, which would cure the crippled limb. Instead Id put those 3 points into Charisma and flex between Tenderizer(for SBQ and Earl) or Inspirational for easier SCORE rank ups. I think Angry Turtle did a video on how much damage you actually gain out of Tenderizer and its pretty crazy despite the low % on the card itself, ends up being more than Bloody Mess. Id probably also take 2 out of Action Boy and put them into Gun Fu or Adrenaline. IIRC Action Boy doesnt regen AP once youre already locked into VATS and if youre locked into VATS 80% of the time, its wasted. Gun Fu works more times than not for me but it may not for others, so thats based on the persons experience. If Gun Fu doesnt work for you Id put the 2 points into Adrenaline. More Damage on next target-&gt;more likely to kill target-&gt;more likely to get AP back with Grim Reapers Sprint-&gt;More AP regen overall. I also use honey a lot since its insanely easy to get and regens AP super fast.
---
By leaving out details anything is possible.
---
So no final answer on this? :/ really holding on purchasing it because I am afraid I will lose progress
---
true
---
What you're experiencing is an intended effect by Bethesda. You really should read up on Patch notes sometime.
---
That's an old bug. It has to do with your client and server communicating with each other.
---
I'm not banned so what reason do I have to lie first he dropped me shit tonnof legendarys well not any good ones sadly then he placed the ammo factory
---
See you in a year! I while trying to gain some basic ammo types just doing my normal routing got ganked by mole rats, rad roaches and scorched near the starting area while in power armour and bleeding put all my 400 rounds of 45. Cheers bathesda, wake me up when you patch this shit
---
And that’s why I stopped playing:
---
season 2 has barely any atoms. 
---
The nerfs to guns aren’t too bad, but making everything the same level as me sucks. 
---
More currencies (yay) to add even more time-gates. 
---
Fallout 1st isn’t too bad but the scrap machine should be sold separately for like 5 bucks. It changes the game quite a bit.  
---
No new maps to explore after 2 years 
---
Making weird fucking choices about how to implement stuff, Vault Raids being constantly spawning enemies and creating huge lag for many. 
---
Lack of new events until it’s too late for holidays. 
---
They should’ve sat down and thought about what to add. Seems they’re kinda winging it.
---
Ok thanks.
---
You have to buy it with gold now but otherwise, yes you can get it.
---
My friend too today. We were in the same mission, he didn't got anything and I got the suit and the plan for the vault94 Suit (2 rare items for one run 🤷🏻‍♂️)
---
I tried to fast travel but with the constant waves of enemies I didn't have much luck.  I wondered if there was a quit option I missed somewhere. Thanks
---
my issues is that its still not a challenge as a high level player who can one hit most enemies.
---
Its that the progression is bad for low level players. enemies should not be the same level in the forest and the mire. progressing through the regions should feel like a big step.
---
My gunslinger is working the same or better depending on what in fighting, also tank killer is just wonderful to have
---
The OP acknowledged the Gold/Scrip/Cap limits.  That still is a problem that I think all players can agree on.  
---
But the "too easy" or "too hard" is the impossible to please aspect of this game and where I agree that you can't please everyone.  There are some that want to be gods and 1-shot all that get in their way.  There are others that hate the god players that steal all the XP and legendary loot.  Damage nerfs and One Wasteland address this to a great extent and offer real challenge.
---
For me, challenge is fun and what makes playing a game worthwhile!  Walking around virtually untouchable with a weapon that melts everything, to me, is the real grind.  It grinds my engagement of the  game and was the reason I started a new character from scratch. How boring!  I craved those early levels where I had to think, and hide, and RUN from enemies when I was in over my head.
---
Now Bethesda needs to build off this patch and fix individual weapons (laser/plasma/pistols) so they are useful but I don't think they could have properly done that until the playing field was levelled.
---
Hmm. They die fine for me, no health regen. I have a camp in point pleasant, the cultists are helpful to farm for weapon mods, and just found one. Took far too much of my (level 10) ammunition but Now I’ve got a nuclear keycard in the stash
---
Lol 😁 I can understand you, I have the same backpack for my safari tours 🤣
---
Those, at least, can be tanked with stimpacks or lured closer by using cover. Cover is awkward in the galleria and tanking just piles in the effect.
---
The thing is, the Mysterious Savior appears when you are knocked out, but if you are killed by something which keeps hurting (like acid or fire or a violent assaultron) you get killed and he saves shit. 
---
Life saving gear works better. But, needless to say, you should invest those points and perks into staying alive.
---
It can be purchased with gold from the raiders. Not sure how much it costs. FYI the interface sucks
---
The Sierra Madre
---
Do you ever get that feeling of deja vu?...
---
I think they added some items from season 1 to the gold bullion traders. I haven't checked yet but it might have been added
---
That's completely dumbing down the discussions that have been going on about the update. 
---
You're certainly free to disagree with people who don't like the latest update, but pretending like the only complaint is as simple as "make the game harder. No I want the game to be easy again" is not accurate or even useful, unless your goal is to justify ignoring anyone who disagrees with you.
---
🤔 I believe you 😉😉
---
The additions over the last year (Fallout 1st, scrap box, instancing etc) lead me to believe that the ESO team has been brought in to fix the financial burden 76 was creating. Let's be fair, at launch people paid for the game and that was pretty much it. We could earn atoms for free. The game was hemorrhaging money.
---
could be! until we come across opponents who are better than us at hide and seek game ;)
---
Very well said I'm a full health PA anything full auto vamp guy and Its honestly made certain enemies like 15% harder imo. That being said I am loving it I did dailyops solo and hated it but then I did it with a team and it was a blast! All around I'm happy with the changes.
---
FINALLY  a Red-Eye appreciation post
---
Honestly don't know if this is the right answer but how I do it is either join a daily ops team or create a new one and wait for 2 people to join.
---
robot melee was probably the worse. the only upside to that was most of them were ranged robots, you could just get behind cover and avoid damage. now robot freeze is going to be awful with the amount of shots they fire
---
Optimized meta players were too strong.
---
Now new/unoptimized players are leaving (again).
---
This \^ very different connotations
---
That is strange. I entered with around 700 shotgun shells and left with 999+. Granted, for every 3 shells I spent, between 3 - 17 shells were dropped as loot. I used my handmade for a little, but it wasn't great at close range. I did get most of that ammo back though. 
---
I was on a team with 2 others. 1 was melee and the other was tesla. No idea on their builds as I don't really play a build myself. I just use weapons I like.
---
It's may not be that simple. There's a bug/issue if you use cloudy's mod manager where it doesn't actually update to 2.8.1 (the latest version).
---
I've yet to get it to work even though I've followed a supposed fix on the nexus page.
---
You can do it non-stop. I think it is wise for it to give a limited amount of rare rewards.
---
Claim the hemlock holes workshop and place the acid collectors there. Then go to lucky hole mine in the excavator power armor and collect all the lead and smelt it. Make sure to use super duper
---
Those levels do matter now. They are worth 2 perk coins each, and you need to be 300 to get the max benefit of Legendary Perks. They did a good job at not only making leveling important again, but making it go by faster too.
---
except it’s happening in a new way now, i think you are referring to the old bug where if i one shot something like a really low level it doesn’t register their death then the enemy jumps back to full health. what i am experiencing now is what seems to be more like a health regeneration as i am skirmishing with the enemy or pack of enemies. this has only happened since the One Wasteland update for me.
---
Wait, if i put a bitch inside another bitch, does that open the portal to Bitchtopia? Or does everything just get sucked in and disappear?
---
I'm not your pal, friend
---
Oh misread.
---
You are part of the problem, not the feedback &amp; community. Based on what you've written, you don't seem to grasp the core valid issues or are too inexperienced to be affected by them.
---
This subreddit is monitored by Bethesda community managers, ergo it's a valid place for feedback. If *you* don't like it, why not find another subreddit to peruse?
---
My thoughts on some of your wishes :)
---
 
---
&gt;Optimized build menu's 
---
they really do need to fix this, i would want to see FO4s settlement build management UI
---
&gt;Change the camp area shape from a circle to a square 
---
This definaly should be added, i would make it a toggle option that could be adjusted when placing a fresh camp. I would also go further a reduce the minimum distance that 2 camps can be from each other allowing you to have camps that share a border
---
&gt;Add interior ceilings with wallpaper options 
---
All they really need to do for this one is add wallpaper functionality to existing non-foundation floor tiles
---
&gt;Add a feature to vending machines that shuts them down once a player hits max caps. A window would pop up on the purchasing players screen that says "Vendor has reached max caps." 
---
i would change this to allow players to sell items for Script, bullion, Notes, Ect. in practice you would always sell for a desired primary currency "Scrip,Caps,Bullion. 
---
if you maxed out one of these then you would get a Note of exchange that could be taken to a vendor(like gold bonds)
---
Remember: ricochet while equipping a VAMPIRE weapon also heals you.
---
Thank you! I'll be bringing my Gauss Gatling the next time I log in.
---
Every 100 levels I wear my vault Tec party hat I got when I left the vault almost 2 years ago, treat it like a little birthday party! :)
---
Is it only after you first shoot them? It could be the level scaling going into effect. They took this trick from ESO; mobs don't have levels until they get hit by a player, and then they become that level.
---
woah!! what a blog!!! consider me subscribed dear sir!
---
Was he in a public team with you?
---
If you're going to complain about everything this subreddit does, maybe find a different subreddit?
---
Bethesda deserve every bit of criticism coming their way. Their development practices are dated, and they have shown time and time again how uncapable they are of treating this game with the focus that is required of a modern GaS title. 
---
Bethesda aren't poor beggars. They are a multi-billion dollar company that are rinsing the fandom of Fallout for little to no return. You're correct they're not a little indie company. They're budget for the year was set months in advance, and you're massively mistaken if you think all that money from Fallout 1st &amp; Atom sales goes directly back into development. 
---
&gt; Not to mention new games that may come out in the future.
---
I honestly don't understand how people think atom sales are somehow funding Starfield or ES6. Like you think Todd can't find investors for those titles? Your money goes to the shareholders, and to the board of directors bonuses. You think the artists that actually designed this game see a dime of atom sales?
---
Look, good on you for enjoying the game. I've got a good few hundred hours of fun out of it myself. But video games are a competitive market, and the current competition is destroying Bethesda on all fronts. They "stole" Fortnite's Battle Royale, and Season Pass concepts. That's how little creativity this team have, they look at what game is making the most money, and they try to emulate it with mixed results, because they lack any real vision.
---
#STOP.GIVING.THEM.MONEY
---
I’m not your friend, bro
---
I'm not your friend, buddy
---
Nothing super about that....
---
Looks like you're gonna need a 3090.
---
This is way more whiny than longtime fans calling out legitimate issues. Just saying...
---
In one of his vids angry turtle shows an example where he has INT at 15 without the legendary Perk, then he added "Legendary INT" at rank 1 and gets +1 INT on the PIP-Boys stat section (no effect on the 15 places for perk cards then). Maybe then the description would be better "Rank2: you get +2 STR perk points to use if your below or equal 13, if you have already 15 perk points  you only get +2STR"
---
I’m not your pal, friend
---
They literally said it was intended though
---
I'm a glass is half full kinda cat.  I just thank the Mothman that I friendlied Watoga before this patch.  Christ on a dumptruck, that would have been scary.
---
He dropped me legendarys not any good ones but free scrip and invited me to the team I didn't know he could build if i joined he's team I always played solo
---
I know,  though they said it was, I still can't believe it, what I could  believe is that they didn't catch it , so to save embarrassment they decided  to say it was intended then scale it back in future patch lol or its them getting the last laugh on the legacy dupers  who go around harassing other players
---
Personally I’d prefer having areas where higher level enemies regularly spawn, similar to what existed pre-patch. Deathclaws should be top tier enemies ... harder to kill, hit harder ... perhaps a bit more rare and deadlier than scorchbeasts. 
---
The problem with enemies that match your level is that you never get the feeling of power that the best games give. Oblivion was frustrating in that sense. It’s not so much about enhanced AI, but more about the challenge of killing certain enemies matching the lore. A radrat should be a one shot kill at high levels, and if you’re using a sniper rifle then a headshot should kill most human-like enemies.
---
I would like to see the factions add more challenge ... make people pick a side. Being able to align with Crater and Foundation at the same time is nice, but raise the stakes and add bounties like New Vegas. If you become a well known raider, then have Foundation send people after you. Raise the stakes. 
---
I’d also like to see groups of roaming Brotherhood and Enclave soldiers, power armor included, that provide a high level challenge ... any npc in Power Armor should be a challenge, not a pushover like so much of the one shot pvp is in the game currently. 
---
An enhancement of the faction system and a karma system would add to the challenge. Throw in more neutral factions or groups that have beef with each other like the Brotherhood vs the Outcasts and give players experience for aiding one or the other out in the wasteland. We’re seeing more of that in the existing game now, with settlers vs raiders but the impact on the players should be raised. Imagine having to go in guns blazing to rescue someone from one of the settlements or turning a former npc ally into a high level raid boss if you make the wrong choices for that faction. 
---
Just a few ideas. Basically I want difficulty that serves the narrative. Not just making everything more of a resource hog to kill.
---
totally agree
---
this happens with ranged too as well all the time, you initially hit an enemy in sneak or just the first shot as a head shot and do 90% damage .. then the next shot it's magically back up to 50% hp then another shot or 2 only brings it to around 30% ... then 2-3 more shots to finish off the last 20-30% hp such wasted durability on my weapon now and wasted ammo for what shoulda been a 2-3 hit kill
---
it's the wackiest client/server sync I've seen yet in networked games
---
I'm not your bro, mate.
---
I shoot within the first seconds with pretty much every weapon I have and I do so at the end of the video and it still misses. The weapons that charge are more broken in Vats than normal. The video is only one tiny example of everything I did yesterday and I experienced the same thing all over the map with multiple enemies. Shooting quickly after entering Vats doesn't negate the fact that every shot misses at 95%. I'm sure Bethesda will fix it by putting  more grinding events into the game.
---
i did the calculation of a baseline fixer,but im confused ,the fixer comes with a calibrated receiver when crafted.
---
They'll need to buff single fire weapons first.
---
lol 🤣
---
I think that means add points to your SPECIAL.
---
That's not true at all.
---
I usually just start my own team when I'm ready to give it a go. It'll notify the server that there's a new Daily Ops public team available and that should get you a couple of interested parties. I've found that joining in teams that are preexisting usually results in me realizing they're already finished and just haven't changed the team objective.
---
Yeah I’ve joined a Daily Op team before but there doesn’t seem to be a way to say “hey let’s go do an Op”. One guy was in one, other 2 were doing nothing. Joined the one guy and he was already 16 minutes in. So that’s what I’m trying to figure out.
---
I saw they said it was intentional but I wouldn't be surprised if they nerf the health regen a little bit.
---
The Devs have changed other effects in the past and said "we don't want this to be a mandatory perk". This was in regards to White Knight nearly 1.5 years ago.
---
Isn't the point of complaining to better a product you care for/enjoy, by pointing out its flaws?
---
You mean you can’t place your blueprint?
---
The best damage I have managed with my stealth rifle character is adrenal reaction, lowish health Instigating Lever Actions.
---
I have Lever, instigating/10% aiming/vats
---
I can one shot most ghouls (75-100) from stealth
---
The instigating first hit is higher than the bloodied Lever Action. Bloodied Lever and Hunting rifle can one shot ghouls at white spring.
---
I was going to wait, but I just had to jump in.  So far I have 5 slots open and only 10 levels away from the sixth.  Here's what I went with...  
---
Ammo Factory - Rank 1  
---
Master Infiltrator - Rank 1  
---
Taking One For The Team - Rank 3  
---
Legendary Intelligence – Rank 2  
---
Electric Absorption - Rank 3  
---
EDIT: I may take out Ammo Factory and replace it with a Special perk.
---
I needed troubleshooters against gutsies, but supermutants and eagles never caused real damage to me.
---
The problem is the "resilient" Mutation, which keeps the enemy alive and shooting at you, destroying your armor.
---
Yea he just placed it in my camp no idea how so didn't know what to call it
---
Truth is, it was rigged from the start.
---
Haha, well then maybe tell your "modder friend" to enjoy rebuilding your camp. Then maybe when the have finished inform them to read patch notes next time before posting on here.
---
I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but an online community such as this subreddit actually consists of multiple individuals who likely have a whole range of opinions on different things. 
---
Not everyone wanted a more challenging game. Not everyone who wanted a more challenging game wanted the challenge to be increased in the way Bethesda handled it. Some people love the changes and that's great. But that doesn't mean that everyone has to love them, or that people who have issues with them, or even who hate the changes are wrong. 
---
But really, as consumers we have two options for trying to influence the direction of the game when we feel like it could be better for us. We can spend our money elsewhere and/or we can use public forums like this to talk about issues we have with the game and hope it filters up to the people who make decisions.
---
Other than the perk coins... pissing contest over who has the best number next to their gamer tag.
---
They have been pushed to 2021.
---
If you are interested in what is included in the update, there are detailed Patch Notes.
---
Maybe a in game list of how many plans etc we have learned, which ones are missing. Maybe a hint how to get them. Also been able to scrap level ups straight for perk coins and a way to get more perk coins in game.
---
There have been plenty of people over the past few days making posts/comments about how they like the update.
---
That could be it, I don't usually have background downloads going on, but my wife does watch the news or Guy's Grocery Games/Diners Drive Ins and Dives just about all the time these days, so it could be a lag issue.
---
We have FiOS and can have two movies streaming and I can still play Falliut, Minecraft, or No Man's Sky without noticing any lag spikes.
---
With the correct pieces of excavator PA equip, you should be getting 4x ore per collection node.
---
A run through lucky hole mine should net 400-500 ore, which when broken down should yield at least 1000 lead scrap. Hopefully i'm converting it correctly, 2 ore per 5 scrap.
---
Yea that’s initially what I thought it was. Should heal u and ur limbs as well. Does it cure addictions?
---
Lol obviously not, the PS5 &amp; XSX offer insane specs for the price, they're pretty much top end PCs from just a few years ago; plus you know they're just going to get faster as time goes on and Devs optimize for the hardware.
---
So you get the various blades from the bullion vendor?
---
no it is throughout the whole fight. here’s a full example:
---
i went to Westek last night to farm guns to sell and i open on 3 super mutants. the first mutant i hit with my gatling gun at 100% health, he drops to like 65% then when the second bullet connects he is at 85% then the bullet drops him to 40% then when the third bullet connects he is at 65% health and this cycle continues until i pump enough rounds to kill the super mutant off, then i move to one of the other 2 super mutants left and the cycle continues.
---
you can physically see the health bar jump back up in chunks too while this is all occurring, it’s not like my eyes are misreading the health i can actually see it regenerate back up  upward.
---
I complain because I actually like the game and want to see it improve. If I didn’t like it I would have just deleted it and moved on. Pretty much every complaint we have is just because they don’t listen to feedback and then implement things no one wants or likes. What’s the point of PTS if issues brought up in it still make it in the game. No one said they wanted a fallout with no npcs. No one said they wanted a daily mobile grind. We didn’t specifically want a nerf to everything. We wanted builds other than bloodied and junkie to actually exist.
---
Wondering if something similar will work those of us who play with controllers.
---
There's already some things in the game that require more than just mindless running and gunning: Encryptid and PP for example.  But you could also look at plenty of other games: cooldowns, interrupts, counters, and the classic "dont stand in fire" which is actually kind-of present in some of the harder enemies (in a very minor way) in 76 like the ML Queen.
---
But like I said, all these things would be much harder to create and balance than just making enemies more dangerous.
---
Sounds like you keep getting your butt kicked.  
---
Otherwise, is my understanding of one wasteland incorrect?  A level 23 should now be able to expect to go anywhere on the map to progress through the game and still only fight low level enemies?
---
Haha so true. Greetings fellow fallout fan. How about we go spend a few bucks in the atom store today haha.  😀
---
I had never heard of a mod manager. What are the benefits of it?
---
Players barely manage to do the sheep imposter mission anything more difficult might fry their brains
---
Omfg I can't believe I missed this
---
be careful it dosen't auto-charge you.  fyi: on ps4, set "fund wallet automatically" to no
---
I would suggest starting your own team. Try to get online just after the daily op resets and you should get a team in a few minutes, then use a mic to tell people you are starting or use the follow me emote
---
I left my farm and water purifiers up so people visiting my camp can take them or I can sell the water for caps.
---
That’s my understanding of one wasteland also, otherwise what’s the point of leveling up?
---
Yah I play on ps4, seems to help
---
I did
---
I'm not your mate, champ.
---
Thanks for all your replies everyone! I’ll certainly check out these recommendations. I’m still not very familiar with a lot of the acronyms or shorthand used here but I’m sure with the help of Google I’ll get there! See you guys out there!
---
wish it was free but 1 perk coin for switch isnt bad and incentivizes being more invested with what u pick
---
If you keep pacifist on it's not an issue but I like to PvP so I don't mind.
---
I doubt you believe everything bethesda says lol
---
It's worth noting that Tank Killer is an absolute must now. Even more important than the Basic/Expert/Master damage increasing perks. If you don't have room for Tank Killer, take off one of those damage perks, as Tank Killer will give you drastically more damage than one set of those other perks will.
---
With all the enemies scaled up (for a high level players at least) all their resistances have scaled up too. And some enemies in previous 'low level' areas have gotten resistances where before they had none.  
---
I believe this is the main reason why there are so many complaints about "bullet spongey" enemies, because you absolutely *need* to have armor penetration in your attacks now.
---
Before you could stack damage boosts so high that you'd punch right through enemy armor without any trouble (bosses excluded). But now with the damage dialed back, enemy armor starts becoming more effective.
---
The AA legendary effect has also skyrocketed in value since the patch, for obvious reasons.
---
Thanks for sharing your build! I’ll definitely check it out. Honestly I’ve barely touched power armour so I’ve a lot to learn about that?
---
You should just stop replying to these lol
---
It's something to do with taking one for the team, well that what thought to be the issue.
---
The slow fire of rifleman kinda hurt with the last patch..try a full auto reciever on your handmade see if you like it.i switched to commando and only using 1st rank of commando cards but time to kill is very fast for me.seems alot faster than my rifleman build
---
Would be awesome. My enclave commando would look fly with that as a secondary
---
Thats good to know.
---
Sorry, "issue" was probably the wrong word.  Levelling was not a concern before.  Now it definitely is.
---
My two cents: I've loved the fallout franchise since I first played it. I waited on Fallout 76 for a couple of reasons including the bad press at launch and my uncertainty about it being shaped into a MMO. I started playing about a month ago and fell in love. Here's the thing, I'm a single dad who can maybe play 2-3 hours 3-4 nights a week (if the kids don't wake up). I'm level 38 and have burnt through all my ammo, stims in 2 days and didn't build my character with any strategy. I'm not hanging around forums and I didn't know what a "build" was until about a week ago. If I go looking for scrap to make more ammo, I die. If I go looking for ammo, I die. If I buy ammo, I burn through the 1000 ish caps I have on hand super quick plus travel costs to get to vendors. Example, tonight I went to do the Lou quest in Carleton mines. I ended up trying to fight level 38 albino radscorpions with a pipe wrench that I found because the only gun that had ammo left broke. I found 6 .308 rounds and some plasma rounds which aren't much use because I favour rifles. The mission didn't award anything and I broke most of my armor. I play solo because I can't commit to meetups and I may have to exit. I can appreciate the value add for high level players but for guys like me, the leveling system is brutal. Just building a sniper rifle with reasonable damage took ages and now I can't use it because the ammo for it is expensive and scarce, the steel cost for repairs is high and getting my hands on scrap perpetuates the cycle.
---
Hits are definitely taking a second longer than usual to register. Yet people keep coming here and complaining about doing zero damage without just waiting a second to see what the real problem is. And I mean, it is a problem. Damage shouldn't take that long to register.
---
It's horrible that the game developer may be reading forums to see what people enjoy so they can remove it.
---
Seems logical to me, would perhaps be to long to place this on the card.
---
Thank You.
---
Yeah I wish there was a way to visibly view your ping in the game so it would be easier to gauge 
---
With my connection some games work great, and some can be really unstable, I guess it depends on where the host server is located and what type of connection it is, but I'm not sure
---
Funny how he didn't reply to this one.
---
If this effect is unlisted, this leaves the question. What other effects are unlisted that we haven't discovered?
---
I’ll have to try it that way. It would be cool if there was a way to have say the team leader send out an invite across the team. I mean I guess you could do that through chat/text and stuff but nobody bothers with that in public usually. Or a notification that says “so and so has entered Ops”.
---
The Queen should have the Daily Ops style reward screen.  After all, it is basically the BoS endgame.
---
However, the others are not BoS related.  Perhaps they can use a different style/format but the same type of post event synopsis, that would be cool.  But the style and format of Daily Ops is meant to reflect that its a Botherhood of Steel event.
---
Thank you! I was actually thinking of changing to commando since my handmade has the legendary effect to shoot faster but I read someone’s comment last night that they can’t do like any damage with it now
---
I'm not your champ, buddy.
---
I think the complainers that you’re *complaining* about are usually bringing up valid criticisms of a business model and enough people doing so may shift the focuses in the company to making players happy.
---
Definitely both of these. I had to get cards and scrap 131 levels when perks released, I can’t imagine a high level doing that for longer
---
If it's just that you don't want to socialize, I don't either.  I have no mic, because generally I catch up on tv when I game so I can't talk to people, and since I'm older I grew up on solo gaming, so it doesn't really appeal to me outside of a few irl friends.    
---
But I do join a public group first thing when I log on.  Even so, I don't think I've ever interacted with anyone in my group outside of ops, and there it's just were all working toward the same goal, so not really much communication needed.  Def check it out, it's really the same as playing solo, you just get a bunch of nice bonuses.
---
Are you sure Adrenal reaction gives 100% at 20%?
---
Edit to add - It's old data, but this says 50%

---
CONCENTRATED FIRE - absolutely agree. feels worthless beyond rank 1. Also have had to change my playstyle so that I start closer when shooting in vats as you get punished less with the increments if you start off with a higher base.
---
GROUND POUNDER - have you done any tests to work out what your effective DPS is with and without? Aside from tanky enemies, I'll killing at least 2-4 per clip anyhow so reloads aren't that big of a deal for me. 
---
Given how Concentrated Fire is, I'm curious to see if Longshot is going to help any in terms of improving base hit percentage chance and overall damage for a given range to fill in those slots you just freed up.
---
Glow sights might be a consideration too as more enemies will be of a higher level.
---
Also if you have any explosive weapons, the demo perk might be a consideration as explosive effects seems to have been reported as being stronger all around.
---
It doesn't take hundreds of hours to do a build. You can't have a bunch of carry weight perks and armor, green thumb, locking, hacker etc on, and expect to be good at combat. You're going to have a bad time. That's not unfair, or wrong, or bad. That's just how gaming works. If you want a more passive role playing experience, then play the Sims, or Fallout 4 (although in 4 if you leave the difficulty on normal and don't take any combat perks, you're still going to die a lot). Perks are fluid in this game, you can swap them out, change your special points, etc. The only thing stopping you from enjoying this game is you and your stubbornness.
---
Also curious about this. Following for an answer
---
I'm not your friend, bud..
---
That seems to be a loaded question at best or a strawman at worst. Are you saying you think Bethesda are going to ignore the potential loss of revenue that would come with the rather large casual player leaving? There is no should in this. Just reality, and the reality is that a significant portion of paying customers are on the fence about whether the game is even for them anymore.
---
Wow, the utter state of this. Unbelievable the lengths and mental gymnastics some will go to to defend a multi million dollar corporation.
---
I'm not your champ, amigo.

Start at Watoga train station, go to the roof of the school, one can spawn by the gnome and the toilet on the north side. Fall off the roof and head West, there is a bus in the low side of the wall that can spawn one on the bus seat. Backtrack east to the winding stairs that lead to a monorail, go left in there and a magazine can spawn on the seat at the end of the monorail. Leave the Monorail and go north to the diner (the diner on the corner, not the standalone diner). Two magazine spawns in here, one on a table and the magazine rack against the back wall. Head west across town to the transit hub. Magazine spawn in the elevator shaft, it is sometimes half buried. Leave south and cut through another building to find a staircase leading to a patio area. There will be stairs going up to another monorail. Go right in this monorail and a magazine can spawn on the bench at the end. Jump out the open door and land on the boxes on a ledge (bird bones helps), you can also backtrack back to the patio to some stairs down if the fall kills you. There are set of 3 tables and two of them can spawn magazines. 
---
9 spawns and once you know the route you can run it in 2-3 minutes.
---
It creates new life, I think.
---
Life is a bitch.
---
This is some hill do die in. This game went from alright to bad with one wasteland. It's clear they have a massive disconnect with their player base.
---
Only reason now is legendary perks.
---
My main is also a Stealth Sniper.    
---
My build focuses on a piece of gear with the Chameleon effect, Sneak R3, the perk that makes you lose enemies by going into stealth, a Quad Fixer, 3 Star Legendary Two Shot Combat Rifle, and scoping out an area before I engage.    
---
Damage is done differently but since enemies scale with your character then it's not as bad as you think. Rifle builds did get hit but in my testing so far not as bad as you think.    
---
We are getting more XP from higher level kills.    
---
If you don't have the Ammo maker from the Raiders then the Legendary ammo can take it's spot. My main is 120. I finished Wastelanders last night for a 2nd time with my other character. Shotgun shells are harder to come by as you need 10 plastic per hit in making ammo.    
---
Shotguns still do a lot of damage but best in VATS. I'm a casual player so more lost time to swap SPECIAL points isn't for me. I have to find a way to make it work. I do have Concentrated Fire maxed out.    
---
How about you shoot me a PM and I'll get my Rifle build and gear and come up with something I can post for you to  look at. I would suggest not changing our build and try to swap perks to focus on damage, crits, and limb crippling.
---
Honestly it just seems like hating everything is the new norm for fandoms. I'm not sure why, it seem like a lot of effort, and honestly a lot of wasted energy to just rail on every little thing. 
---
Dude fallout 76 is awesome. It used to be a shitshow at launch but the pros vastly outweigh the cons for me. I get to tool around the wasteland with my buddies, that's exactly what we get.
---
It seems like it's often the same for other stuff. I've been a magic player for a while now and every little thing the company does is put under a microscope and bitched about.  I've ram in various collecting circles for tots for years and there is not a single thing manufacturers do right the way I hear it. It's mind boggling how much people seem to hate their hobbies.
---
I'm level 410 I gave up and still have 60 levels to scrap lol. I know your pain.
---
Hell, even as a hardcore player, I can't solo Radiation Rumble. It takes my boyfriend clearing out the hordes so I can collect ore, and even then we don't always finish with all 4 NPCs alive.
---
Level cap would be pointless because we need legendary perk points to continue upgrading perks.
---
To max 6 legendary cards takes 500 levels if you scrap every level up and card pack. Excluding the ones you get from the scoreboard. Not to forget that it takes points to remove the perks.
---
It’s bound that they may add more perks to the legendary system.
---
My problem is that a lvl 1000 will have a harder time leveling then a lvl 100. There needs to be a xp cap at some point.
---
But I suppose a cap would work if they add a paragon leveling system that’s separate from the main level.
---
Ahh yes I must have missed a comma
---
I mean sure the game had a rough start, but Bethesda has tried to fix it and make it better. They’ve given it free dlc and updates and even made it free to play. Sure there’s a subscription but the game is free. They’ve fixed a lot of bugs the game had and actually made some stuff enjoyable.
---
K.
---
I thought the mic might be helpful but rarely do I find a public team where everybody gets together unless it’s a big event. So getting them all on same page that way would be tough.
---
Correct. You have to go downstairs and cross a flooded area.
---
Well, as the name implies, it helps to manager you mods. The main thing really is that it makes installing and updating mods easier and there's an option within the manager to turn off mods to allow you to play in NW.
---
This. I have tested it, and tank killer 3 is better than, for example, 9 rifleman points. Yeah. The same with commando. 
---
My rifleman is hitting decently and I have only the first level card of each, but full tank killer.
---
I made all of them adamantium skeleton too
---
He was having fun before One Wasteland. At the very least, more fun than frustration.  And he still does have fun now after the update, but the balance of fun to frustration is off.  He is currently jobless from Covid and has much more time to play than I do, and since the patch he is hardly playing except for when I'm on compared to how much he was playing before.  He actually told me last night that if he couldn't play with me and have access to the stuff I can make for him, he probably would have stopped playing the game for right now because of how frustrating it is now.  Before the patch, often we would each do our own thing in different areas, just in a group together to share perks.  At this point, he doesn't want to play his character unless we can run together, which obviously shows there is an issue as he was playing quite a bit more by himself before.
---
And look, I'm not trying to say FO76 is a bad game by any means, and neither does my brother think it's a bad game.  We both love the Fallout universe and want to play this game in spite of it's flaws, and it certainly has many flaws.  But before, especially for my brother, the fun outweighed the flaws more than enough to make the frustrating times worth it.  Now, at the least for my brother, the fun and frustration are equal enough that he isn't wanting to play the game like he did before.
---
Of course, this is only the opinion of 2 people and maybe for many people the game is not only fine but better than it was before.  Challenge is good, I'm not trying to say it's not a good thing.  But artificial challenge is not good.  And messing up the way the game plays for new characters who have no support is not good.  Playing solo is perfectly valid and should still be a supported play style.  I'm sure anyone who has played Fallout has played the lone wolf, and it's obvious that is an intended play style since there is a perk specifically for playing solo.  But having to be supported by other players to get by is, I think, an unintended side affect of the way things are now.  At least I don't believe Bethesda was attempting to force people to play in teams.
---
The point I'm trying to make here is that there is room for every play style.  The way it is now needs to be looked at, especially for low level characters with no resources or good items.  I don't think anyone wants the game to die off, but discouraging new characters from playing by making the game more frustrating than fun will keep the game from growing.  Challenge is necessary and good, but the balance of risk/reward needs to be addressed.  Most people play games to have fun and relax.  If the game starts to feel more like work than fun, then people will move on to games that are more fun.  I recognize that some people like the challenge of overcoming a lopsided struggle, but the need to realize that the vast majority of players don't want to feel abused playing a game.  Bethesda wants to make money, so scaring away new players and making old players feel like it's not worth it anymore is not the way to do that.
---
There are ways to add a lot of challenge to the game without making the rest of the game a slog or making it unappealing for new characters.  The intent of the update is very good, but the execution is flawed.  I like playing with my brother and I don't want him to give up on the game and move on to another game.  And certainly, the game can be fun with a certain play style and certain perks.  But it should be fun and accessible to any play style and perk selection.  And currently it is not.
---
I hope we can agree that this is a good game and we want people to keep playing it!  I have for many years wished for a Fallout game I can play with my brothers, and finally we have one and really there is a really good game underlying all the issues!  But there is a lot of frustration also, and the frustration has moved from the players who wanted a challenge to the players who are now struggling to just play and have a good time.  What I hope for, is that neither side has to deal with frustration anymore and everyone can have more fun with the game.  And I hope Bethesda will keep working on how things are, and keep making the game better.  I hope that real challenge can be added to the game and we will have to use tactics and buffs and cover and things just to survive in big battles.  I hope there will be enemies that any lone player will think twice about messing with because they know it's likely they will be wrecked without backup or massive firepower.  Really, all I want is for real challenge to be in the game, not just for bullet sponge enemies.  I believe it would make for a better game all around and I hope that is where Bethesda is going with all of this.
---
Haha! I honestly haven't spent any money on 76 in almost a year, and I probably won't until they fix a few things. Not saying the gane is garbage, or unplayable. I still play every once and a great while with a couple friends. As a consumer I just don't feel the urge to give them any more of my money.
---
For legendarys, Scrip what you don’t use/doesn’t fit your build.
---
You are limited to 1,000 scrip, so there will be a point where you will need to buy something from Mrgph.
---
The way I did it (and still do) is if you are happy with your current armor, buy weapons, if you are happy with your weapons, buy armor.  If you are happy with both, buy legendary modules, or sell the legendaries for caps.   
---
You’ll need Legendary modules to craft stuff from WL. IIRC, legendary modules are 1# each, so I wouldn‘t go too crazy buying them.
---
==
---
In general, follow the overseers questline.  You’ll get the backstory and lore.  I used to say it also keeps you in level appropriate areas, but I suppose One wasteland kind of changes that advice.
---
This game is a marathon, not a sprint.  Take you time and appreciate the world.  Learn the lore.  Do the daily’s.  Fully explore the Forest - that’s where you will pick up most of the main questlines.  Join the Pioneer scouts.  
---
If you do not like PVP, make sure you turn on pacifist mode = it wil prevent accidentally invoking PvP outside of workshops.
---
love it haha
---
How much power is it chucking out?
---
I think people need to stop suggesting that entire game mechanics should be adjusted because of a slight personal objection they have.
---
Make difficult enemies difficult again ... not make everything more of a pain in the ass to kill. There should be tiers or ranks of enemy types that are significantly harder to kill. I just think the balance is off ... a mirelurk king shouldn’t be harder to kill than a queen or a deathclaw. A Colonel Gutsy shouldn’t be able to kill you in 4 hits while a yao guai is less challenging.
---
Why don't you have pacifist on all the time? It's an on until absolutely needed off thing..
---
And then you die
---
Fixer’s break easily now. Mine only last 10-15 enemies.  It used to last over a week before the new patch.
---
I know it sends an invite to the whole team when someone starts the Ops but it's still a crapshoot whether anyone shows up at times. I hope you have good luck with it!
---
Yes, we're allowed to be disappointed when we pay for something that gets more broken and buggy with each patch.
---
I think it’s the same as a regular fusion reactor.
---
I wish I could show you my build.at the moment it's not setup.i have rifleman perks and commando perks 1 of each damage cards on both but the diffrence of damage on similar guns semi to auto is about 10 or 15 damage points almost negligible. 25 faster fire is really nice as well to play with.dont think you'll be disappointed
---
Yeah, when I said baseline, I really mean baseline i.e. without any of the mods on it.
---
I don't know if it's worth stripping down a fixer for science to find out though but that's what I understand to be the case.
---
I wear my SS helmet with it, looks good.
---
NP, this game is truly one of the worst when it comes to explaining things imo. It wont double stack the 2 points, but if you had 15 and added the 2 you would see 17 in pip boy but only have 15 slots open. 🍺
---
Good to know.
---
Thankfully I keep pacifist on all the time.
---
Agree that it needs to be fixed, but at least for now it's got a workaround. I'm tired of hearing complaints that it takes 50 rounds to kill a scorched, so I figured people need to know.
---
Oh neat! I would download it but you just said it was bugged.
---
People don't want "something to do". They want more content. A grind isn't content, its a waste of human life. No one wants to perform the same repeated tasks over and over, they just do it because they want the gear. What people really want is more of the game they have already beaten.
---
The issue is that there's only so much content, and no one likes grinding. Its something to do when you are out of things to do, but we don't want more grinds, we want more content. The main draw from the series has always been the large amount of narrative and history in the game, and this game fell way short of that. No one wants a season of repeated tasks. We want proper expansions that bring new questlines, adventures, history, and rewards. 
---
We don't want the game to be universally more difficult, we want builds that are more balanced, so you can be equally as powerful as a stealth sniper, commando, tank, etc. Previous games have always given you the ability to complete a mission in multiple ways, using the different attributes available to you. This one has removed that, and in the process has removed all balance from the game.
---
Must be nice...
---
My main is in a full Vanguards Secrets Service Armor set with Vampire’s Crippling shotguns. It’s a tank build. 
---
My low level character is on its way to being a Critical Strike Pistol build (gunslinger). Now that Tank Killer works with pistols it seems viable.
---
Man I'm sorry it doesn't work for you. I had the same problem with the gauss rifle and my VATS crit world never work even if it hit. Made me so mad hah. For me the method I use works really well. You do it at the end of the video and that one shot looked off, but it did almost kill it. Anyway, that's the way to do it, charge first and shoot right after going into VATS. I use concentrated fire I dunno if that makes a difference but it works very consistent for me.
---
this is what a reddit user said yesterday but wouldn't disclose what triggered it .. thanks for letting us know .. sounds like the same issue they had with mutations awhile ago .. when you auto apply a debuff to an enemy who hits you causes you to trigger the attack back to initiate pvp
---
Not really griefing if you have pacifist off.
---
Have you considered spending less time on Reddit so you don't see the same posts over and over?
---
Are you sure it's a glitch and not just people farming the same spots?
---
Yep. Every enemy is much more perceptive now. Stealth kills cause all enemy types to investigate much more aggressively after the patch. Stealth is becoming ineffective in spots where it's most needed, like sneaking/stealth killing your way through tight spaces like silos.
---
This is why I get a build to level 70 and then start a new one. I can see myself getting all my characters to level 100 someday and probably taking my favorite as high as possible to max out the legendary perk card slots...but there's just no way I'll ever be able to get a character to 300+
---
Plus, I just love 76's early game. Haven't done a new build with OW yet but that'll be happening within the next few weeks. I'm actually really excited to start a new build since I should be able to just jump into almost whatever events I choose right away...should help with the early leveling up.
---
Oh I don’t do them in stealth they will always detect you. For these OPs I go full on run and gun. I normally play as a bloody stealth commando so what I’m doing now is going to about 50% hp for these. With the mall I was using the center square for cover on uplink 1. For the second one past the water area I used the counter for cover and killed the long hall enemies first then moved out to shoot the ones that come from behind on the second floor.
---
Yep saw it on YouTube yesterday. But guess what I’m not a dick and Pvp sucks in this game. If I wanna pvp I’ll play fortnite, PUBG, call of duty, not fallout. So everyone should turn on pacifist specially if you carry junk around
---
There are theories about respawn times based on whether an item is in a locker or desk, versus whether it is a standard part of the location. I haven't seen any weights in the Charleston Fire Department or Green County Lodge for about a day and a half, but on the day of the patch I farmed both locations at least twice, so maybe they disappear if another player farms them. The tin can alarm strips hanging under the roller coaster at Camden Park seem to respawn regularly, but it's a more hostile location than the Fire Dept, so maybe it's not being farmed. 
---
I've been avoiding ore, because it requires Acid, which is also needed for Gunpowder.
---
When Preston Garvey tells you a settlement is threatened by raiders, you don't have an option to persuade them to be nice to settlers.  If you want to play the game to the very end of the story, you are going to blow up the institute or destroy the prydwen.  There is no option to politely ask the BOS to leave the commonwealth or to persuade father to stop replacing people with synths. The very idea of beating Fallout 4 passively is   complete and utter bullshit. Yes there are select missions that you can complete with persuasion skills and no fighting. But that is only true for select missions.  You are telling me everybody knows about passive runs and yet you have not provided one single piece of evidence where someone played the game from start do finish without engaging in combat. Which makes sense because that doesn't happen. Since the down vote has replaced actual rebuttals in this thread, I see no point in continuing this discussion.
---
Might as well put it on then, just put that last trophy off until they fix the issue
---
I wish it was for mutations instead of diseases. You get in, it pops up with a list of your current mutations and asks you which specific one you want to remove.
---
Would be game changing. (And possibly a bit broken?)
---
Then find a different sub if you don't like it here
---
I’ll definitely try out commando tonight. I’ve had my build set for about 40 levels so I’ve got a lot of spare perk points
---
Weird. Maybe super mutants in particular have higher regen? Not sure what's going on there.
---
No issues here
---
Hmm "a gun I actually want to use" is a sticking point. I love the variety of weapons in fallout games, they're one of the primary selling points of the game to me. This update turned over a hundred weapons into dead content.  
---
I collected every weapon in the game as a junkies, and I loved using them all. I would make a different RP for each one, and play it. Now the vast majority of them are nearly useless. You could have found the gun you "actually want to use" as a lower leveled variant to let it work with your perks, I however have no such course to turn my rolling pin, broadsider, or any of the other silly fun weapons I love into a higher level version.
---
They they are new then they're out in access to Legendary perks. Any ranged character is going to have an issue until they can improve how they get it.    
---
Any new players that are here:    
---
Many higher level players like myself like to help new players. I was helped by someone who set up on the road in the beginning area. Some water, food, ammo, etc. Nothing major but it did help. Most people don't use mics so if they're looking at their Pipboy the chances are very high that they are looking to give you some stuff.    
---
It's not ruining the experience. 76 is an MMO at it's core. Food/drink, gear maintenance, and a basic CAMP are time consuming enough.    
---
There are many beginner guides out there and many don't want to use them. I value my time a lot more than any game so playing efficiently is my goal.
---
Had that last season. Rebooting didn’t help. But it only lasted about 3 hours.  Not sure what caused it but annoying as hell
---
I couldn't begin to explain the math but to me it wasnt worth having 12 points for commando damage then anti armor cards .I have all 3 A.A cards then the 1st rank of commando and it seems like a good balance.but if you dont have any other perk you want use them.
---
Hmm I thought the Ops notification just pops up anyway. Like as soon as I load in it says Ops available. Or does it send out a different one if you’re in a team and start an Op?
---
Known glitch; they said they're looking into it.
---
&gt;is not accurate or even useful, unless your goal is to justify ignoring anyone who disagrees with you.
---
Ding ding, we have a winner. Posters with this agenda think they are being clever by pretending that's the argument being made. It's a flimsy strawman, but it's the only one, aside from the 'its just salty Bloodied players', they have.
---
*Reddit is a soapbox for the vocal minority to yell and scream and complain and get what they want.*
---
"I don't agree with people complaining so I'm going to reframe them as a minority to protect my own feelings instead of actually acknowledging their complaints."
---
Well, I don't know if the mod manager is in of itself.
---
Your circumstances might mean different results. That's why I said I have a bug/issue with it that's different to what's on the nexus because they had the same problem and fixed it with their workaround whereas I did the work around and it didn't fix it for me.
---
Your situation may differ because you're installing stuff from scratch.
---
There are seriously diminishing returns from DR &amp; ER one you get above 300 (of each) due to the way the calculations are performed, Mitigation is always better as per the posts from several other people on here.
---
Nice! Thank you!
---
&gt; Are you going to do nothing because the rest of the meal was good?
---
Probably? You go to a steak house for steak, not the roll.
---
Yup they take longer. I always two Tap and wait
---
There's a fan-made Skyrim mod called Skyrim Together, might be what you're thinking about. Otherwise there's Elder Scrolls Online, but that was made by Zenimax Studios, not Bethesda.
---
I agree. I’m one of the few people who’s still destroying everything in his path
---
Reload speed is a lot like FFR in terms of the fact that it doesn’t help you kill things with less bullets but it lets you put out more bullets over time. So it is most felt in boss fights where you spend a significant period of time reloading. 
---
Glow sights is absolutely an alternative. Or you could shift points to luck and get tormentor for crippling. 
---
I also think that with the change, the 33% vats accuracy effect gets a big boost in usefulness since people can’t cheese accuracy anymore.
---
I have demo expert in my build and an alt of gunsmith. I think some decent investment in intelligence is important for legendary perk leveling. Spend those 5, non nerd rage points as you see fit.
---
Farm the wendigos in Colossal Problem and the hit Lucky Hole Mine in Excavator. I usually end up with around 1200 lead.
---
I haven’t had too many issues with stray bullets (rifleman) and I only put it on for SBQ and such since it’s chaotic. Some newbies and casuals may not even know about it so this may help a few
---
If you honestly think that reddit reflects the majority of the player base, then there's no hope for you.
---
I guess ill place my camp there too
---
I think I get a little pop-up when my teammate starts one and then I can just go to the Op menu and hit 'join team.' I'm still getting used to the UI as well so I could be reading it wrong.
---
Sometimes more than a second. I used half clip into a scorched mirelurk, enter vats, shoot, nothing, exit vats and shoot from hip, nothing, damage numbers pops, hit sounds plays. No damage at all. After reloading I killed it with two bullets. Fortunately I recorded a couple of videos, this isn't just rubberbanding.
---
This 👍
---
That made me chuckle... I'll compromise somewhere

Legendary weapons, loads of xp, loads of ammo. Those 3 alone, plus the fact that it's something different and new is enough to make me spend a lot of time doing almost nothing but them, aside from certain events. Now, if the scrip limit increased or stash limit increased so I could stash all of these damn legendaries instead of moving them all to my mule, I'd be doing daily ops non stop I think lol.
---
Hopefully, it will have more purpose when we get instanced interior camps in the future.
---
I agree!    
---
I think it would get old if some event was done all year round.    
---
The holidays we have now have been around for a long time. That Halloween themed store to the far NE sort of near Vault 79 would be a great base of operations for the event but also unique vendors. New enemies during the event. New plans and gear from those events.    
---
They are missing out. I read there was a Halloween event last year. That was when I got fed up and took a break for awhile.
---
Yeah I saw the 2020 road map and events calendar for the rest of the year and didn't see anything halloween-y.
---
Same as it always was.
---
I'd have to heavily agree with that. The atom shop was supposed to be the thing that helped support the game long-term, but with the amount of free atoms everyone could get, that was basically a pipe dream. I understand a lot of people aren't happy about losing out the free atoms we could get all the time, but the game has to make its money somehow, especially with it being continually developed and updated.
---
I can usually place my camp on the first try, but just as a heads up some times it takes 2-3 tries
---
Ppl watched a YouTube video so now they’re doing it. Everyone should be on pacifist anyways and this would’ve never happened
---
I have a shitty video card, so that might be it. Loading times are god awful, and worst around Foundation and the Morgantown Greater Metro Area.
---
We live in an age where people just whine for the hell of it. I'm a fan of the Bethesda Fallouts and i'm happy with 76 for the most part. I understand the complaints in regards to bugs as i've experienced my fair share but i also understand its their first online Fallout so things will be a little bumpy. I'm also subscribed to Fallout 1st, i don't see it as too over priced since you get the scrapbox, more atoms than what you pay for and exclusive items.
---
That sucks. It took me over 8 hours to just install the update.
---
The squeaky wheel eventually gets greased. Make enough noise to get their attention to fix the problem. Of course grease only lasts so long before it needs to be greased again. I value complaints that are constructive. They have made enough noise to improve the game a little. But as others have mentioned it is a business and they do need to make money. So I would like to give a Big THANK YOU to those who have fallout 1st and also have money to buy from the atom shop. I am not well off to do the same. You support my favorite franchise. I love living in this world! See you all in the wasteland.
---
I am on XB1 got lucky and traded for the full set of plans. Thank you for the offer though very nice of you !
---
Will other floor pieces snap to it?
---
I forgot also, random currency drop hits everytime you finish, giving caps scrip or treasury notes. When it's scrip or treasury notes, it was definitely worth doing it for that as well. At least to me
---
I found this out the hard way. You have to get the shovel head in the nuke zone.
---
Well said.
---
Its ok
---
Where lits saying it’s shit waaaaaaa and others saying it’s ok?  I’ve read a hundred saying bloodied commando is now dead. Useless. And I can tell u it’s not.
---
Only a little testing when I needed to swap green thumb in. I went to one rank but the accuracy felt worse from the little bit I tried. I’ve just been sticking with the three ranks. Hoping someone will talk about it in a YouTube video.
---
So I jumped in to RR last night and luckily had a smart number of people around me who waited until we had a half dozen people show up before starting. We had heavies in PA defending the scavvers and the rest of us running for ore. Here I am, level 42 running around in a hazmat suit trying to dodge ghouls, snallygasters, deathclaws and floaters...and cursing myself for not being able to kill any enemies to grab some exp...until I realized that I'm a fucking idiot, equipped a 10mm and starting taking potshots at enemies as I ran around. The exp started racking up and I ended up picking up 3 levels by the time the event ended. Gonna be doing this one much more often since I feel it's actually gotten a bit easier with the OW update...*just a bit easier*
---
Why does no one believe me?
---
An across the board recalculation of damages is less of a nerf and more of a full rework, Bloodied is still the best build for DPS, just now other builds and weapons need attention from Bethesda: Pistols, Non-automatic Rifles, and Laser/Plasma guns.
---
Ballistic Pistols: High Damage for low fire rate and small ammo capacity.
---
Ballistic Non-Automatic Rifles: Higher Range than Pistols while following a similar correlation of Damage to Fire Rate.
---
As for Energy Guns (Not Heavy)
---
Laser Guns: High Ammo Capacity, Good Fire Rate even when Not Automatic, Highest Accuracy, Little Recoil, Fastest Projectile, Great Range, least amount of Damage per shot.
---
Plasma Guns: High Damage, Lower Fire Rate, Moderate Ammo Capacity, Slowest Projectile, Worse Range.
---
I would assume so yes .. bloody mess, adrenaline, gun fu, crit savvy, chems etc whichever you choose for your build
---
... however ...
---
there is still server/client desync and enemies still heal back health and some shots/hits from melee/guns seem to not count towards damage, but count towards degrading your weapons durability ..
---
I started a new character yesterday, this morning got him to level 10, 3 perks in rifleman, putting the perk card in and taking it out caused the same 9,9,9,9 damage [( using a splitter modded laser rifle )](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Beam_splitter_(Fallout_76)) on a feral level 10 ghoul with and without the perk .. so it's anyones guess at this point
---
maybe armor penetration is more effective now .. back to the drawing board on testing
---
Yeah I bet. But all you do is scrap everything and start over. And it’s like magic.... hopefully a modder don’t do it again
---
Iirc it has the most bleeding damage out of unarmed weapons, correct me if I am wrong
---
Absolutely true. Tank killer is a multiplicative perk among the weeds.
---
As long as you're trying to proc Revenant, stacking Lifesaver armors is a MUCH better idea. 5 consecutive 50% rolls gives you very good(but not quite guaranteed) odds of rezzing, and it isn't subject to AI spazzing out and ignoring you while you lie there dying. He does that, a lot.
---
I would use just about anything else for the slots Mysterious Savior wastes because even when it does proc he doesn't help you most of the time.
---
No private
---
Totally agree. This game was likely on the chopping block before they started bringing in more money.
---
I don’t think it’s intended to trigger in any case. Lot of casuals wouldn’t even know there is a pacifist setting.
---
Saw a post yesterday stating you needed to be careful with this one - it will Auto Unlock doors and such at camps (for example), giving you an unexpected wanted status
---
I don't know. Considering the pummelling your karma is taking I would assume not too many people agree with you. Just saying.
---
There's already a soft cap at lv50. After that every new level is just to get perks and change your special to redo your build or farm legendary coins for the legendary perks.
---
Same goes for weapons and armors, everything is capped at lv50.
---
That's like saying I never crash, so I dont wear a seatbelt. It's 2 way protection in this case.
---
You usually PVP or something? It's been on since day one for me.
---
Yea because before i was able to simply remove it huh? Don't think so couldn't even move the thing
---
This	^ is true 👍
---
Forest has encrypted. Edit....and project paradise. Neither of those are easy
---
Could be right. I’ll have to pay attention more.
---
Yes, please. Each zone definitely needs a Boss Mob event.
---
It depends on how they were calculated before and how they are now.
---
Assuming it was multiplicative per perk card the old way, assuming a weapon with attack 100
---
It would be 120 (base + 20%) + 144 (previous total + 20% of that) + 173 (previous total + 20% of that) = 437
---
New way would just be 160 (base + 60%).
---
You can see why some people went from doing thousands of damage to mid hundreds.
---
Why is it unplayable? Because if you stand side profile you can see a gap?
---
I jump on any complaints I find valid, but the idea still remains true. I see so many people bitching about how bethesda is taking all their fun out of the game and they can only enjoy it when they get to dupe presents and explosive lasers. If you get to the point where you're only enjoying the game when you're cheating, **the game is clearly not meant for you**. Go play something else instead of making yourself intentionally miserable here. You'll be better off, the community will be better off, and bethesda can focus on feedback (whether or not they ever actually listen to it) from a more like-minded audience and not just polar opposites to everything they do
---
So is there another version of fallout I don't know about? Made by someone else preferably.
---
Sometimes the Z-Axis gets ignored when checking for range.
---
How is cover hard in the Galleria? One of the boosters is in a room and the enemies have to funnel through three doorways, the other booster there is literally a wall at your back they all have to come from one direction.
---
Hopefully not, I'm a junkies build xD
---
Thats a shame. Yeah I read the notes and didn't see it but I figured I may have missed it. Considering the update revolved heavily around perks, I assumed they would've added loadouts.
---
 **"Theses bloodied stealth guys keep one hitting everything and I never get legendary drops**"   
---
This is partially true. It's not frustrating or anything and it's like it should be. Sometimes it make me kind a sad, that in best case great melee build will kill 3-4 enemies before my slow Ultracite laser gatling even fires 1st round :D
---
&gt;Should all the builders, traders, RPers, explorese, farmers
---
Everything you do in this game is done with the purpose of staying alive in a hostile world. That is the entire point of farming, trading and exploring. And that is why you build your character to survive fights.
---
I think you overestimate how many people still think about this game, let alone dedicate time to try and over inflate its problems. It doesn’t need any help in that regard. 
---
What you’re describing was much more of a problem about a year ago, and closer to launch. There I did see instances of people falsely reporting bugs/exploits etc as they were most often taken on face value due to so many other pre-existing issues. These days such efforts rarely get any traction, and there are far fewer of them. 
---
Most of the complaints you see in this sub are both legitimate and from current players. Brushing them off as a nefarious cabal benefits no-one in the long run.
---
Well the biggest thing that held me back from exploring the forest / ash heap toxic valley regions was the low level loot. Outside of xp if you are grinding for SCORE, there’s no reason to do the events in those areas. That’s completely changed now with higher level enemies.
---
I switched form half and half rifleman/commando to full commando a while back. You are already pretty much specced for it, just switch perks, keep tank killer. Decide if you want to use vats or not and spec accordingly. 
---
I also started using tormentor. Just unload a quick burst at a tough enemies limbs and it's easy to turn them into limping mush.
---
I miss one shotting stuff from miles away as a rifle man but honestly sneak is so OP you can get pretty close no prob. I can usually get withint 95% vats hit chance with no problem or strat, then just unload a quick burst of 3 to take down most things. Super mutants and robots take a bit more, like a burst of 9-10.
---
More dangerous enemies I cripple their legs with tormentor.
---
My set isn't meta, hell 3 of my armor pieces aren't legendary and my two weapons are a standard lvl 50 fixer I bought from a player and a 2 star quad explosive handmade. Nothing meta, but fun, no issues. Just make sure to pick up ammo smith and/or ammo factory.
---
I’ve seen other people suggest a behemoth version of Mad Dog Malone in the courtyard of the prison.
---
As someone who has invested time in money into their products, I can and will critique the product. I've been a fan of bethesda for a very long time and can be disappointed in what their games are turning into.
---
I could just as easily say that the "majority" of the player base isn't happy with what Bethesda is doing but isn't posting about it. In both my case and in yours, we would be equally ignorant of reality because neither of us have anything to substantiate our claims.
---
Cool. Thanks for the same requests that people have been asking for, for ages but because you asked I'm sure Bethesda will get right on it.
---
I'm going to go ahead and assume you're not a bloodied build. And you most certainly dont have to be. But that is a large portion of the payer base, and we die a good amount. Sometimes for no reason. It's not really a big deal as you get use to dropping your junk. But when you just couldn't respawn at all it was a bit irritating.
---
no. it sucks. i am deleting my game. it takes 2 shot to kill things now instead of 1. this is the worrrrrRRRRRRRSSST
---
I can get on in about 10 hours and we can kill each other, I’m sure I need this trophy too.
---
I usually complete Elder on the first 2 runs and then keep doing it without worrying about the time to farm xp
---
Wow 13 downvotes. How will I go on? And it’s certainly not because they’re from the exact sort of people who whine constantly and call it criticism. 
---
🙄
---
or Proctor Ingram
---
Everyone who loves Bethesda games bitches about them. This isn't a new thing to 76.
---
The odd workshop PvP. I haven’t had any dramas with it before.
---
Script legendaries you don't want.    
---
Play the game and you'll earn a steady amount of caps. Don't fast travel as much.    
---
Certain items can sell for more like Chems and Purified Water. I know many tend to scrap a lot but you can also sell instead to bank more caps.    
---
Player vendors are iffy. There's no guarantee what you put in them will be bought even at lower prices. Early on lower level and any Tier of legendary gear that improves your character is a bonus for the most part.    
---
The limit is 1000 script so you have to spend it in order to get more. Some quests give you script. Sadly, the random reward isn't good for Miner Lady. I do have gear on two characters that are a permanent part of their gear loadout.
---
its basicly an ammo and Stim Farm. complete it to get elder, then go back in and just keep killing things. depending on your build you will make bank with ammo (no need for that converter)
---
Edit running an agrp will mean all mobs drop multiple stacks of different ammo types. need .45 then have a friend run with you using a .45 caliber weapon.
---
She doesn't even do that much damage, but holy hell was she tanky. Auto handmade was barely putting a dent in her health, my sneak attack criticals wore off almost as soon as she got into range so I had to finish her off with lower damage and it actually felt worse than a mirelurk king. The giant queens are actually tougher than the tiny ass kings now, who would have guessed?
---
"I'm a grown woman with legal custody of two cats &amp; a pot plant." - not gonna lie, this made my day much brighter. Thank you. :)
---
You’re missing one thing: Punctuation.
---
So a level 23 can reasonably expect to solo a silo?
---
Came from playing shooters today to this and noticed it was taking ages to kill anything. Saw the hit markers and noticed my sniper wasn't registering till the reload animation was almost finished. Very very big issue for a game that revolves around a shooting mechanic. Thanks for the post at least makes me feel less crazy.
---
Ah, the age old way to deflect criticism from developers
---
i had the thought that maybe enemies have hidden bonuses such as a small regen that wasn’t easy to notice when everything was percentage based, but now that things are numbers based the formula that calculates these types of bonuses is skewed to much.
---
Unless things are getting stuck in the gap I'm not sure how it's unplayable
---
I feel for you Sneaky Commando's.  I tried to go from heavy to commando and it didn't work for me so I went back.  Now my TSE Gatling Gun is un-nerfed I will hold the line for your head shots.
---
I use a TSE Prime Gatling Plasma. It takes me 1-2 ultracite plasma cores to finish the mission in under 8 minutes. The end rewards then give me 6 ultracite plasma cores. This is all the incentive I need.
---
Some weapons do fire damage in addition to their other effects. I have some legacy explosive laser rifles and you can add receivers on those that cause your target to catch fire for a bit after shooting them. I think maybe that's what you're seeing.
---
Re read the post. 🤦 He said it doesn‘t make him rank up.
---
Hey, I had it as a collector's item. The introduction of this plan lets me free up 10 pounds from my stash. It's not entirely worthless!
---
I hope it stays the way it is.  I'm at Rank 3 and I'm not sure if I even need to max it out.
---
I’ve been through my fair share of games, and overall the Fallout community complains waayyyyyy more than any other gaming community I’ve seen. More than GTA and COD combined. I wonder what’s wrong with these people, if they really loved Fallout they wouldn’t bitch so much. They’re the reason it took me until this year to play it, if people didn’t complain so much more people who love the game would play it instead of keep their distance because it’s glitchy.
---
Disease cure = less than a second to take effect  
---
Sympto-not-so-Matic = 1 hour animation
---
I am. It is funny watching players die so often
---
Thanks for the advice, we're not very good at running and  gunning but we'll find a way. Want to try phantom devices....
---
there's that "assumed" word I see people use way too often.
---
Well......"Not Quite a Meat Week" doesn't have the same ring to it.
---
Monthly challenges* it would be a nice way for them to allow more poeple get more score rather then rely on double xp or score weeklies.
---
It's the last one I need, im available. Up_setty325
---
Yeah, no.  A challenge for stealth builds would be one that makes it harder to stealth.  This simply makes it not work.  Period.
---
Now you can stay in a stealth build of course but a lot of your perk cards do nothing.  Not less, not "work harder to make it work" but nothing.  And there is nothing you can do about it.  Not "stick to the shadows" or "move slowly."
---
So, if your basic tactic, stealth, and all the perk cards associated with it do absolutely nothing...then your build is screwed.
---
Sure, you can switch, within heavy limits, to another build, but that's like saying "sure your legs are broken but walking isn't screwed because you can still pull yourself along with your arms."
---
Cloaked enemies, which also come in daily ops, DO screw with VATS builds but they aren't entirely wrecked because the enemies have to uncloak to attack.  THAT is a challenge.
---
Poison attacks are tough on the low health crew but, since they know it's coming, they can equip armor that provides poison resistance.  THAT is a challenge.
---
"Stealth and all related perks don't work at all and there is nothing you can do about it!" is not a challenge, it is screwing over a segment of the player base.
---
Bro 🤦‍♂️. There IS a scrapper perk
---
Guess some people wanted to take advantage of it. Too many new people and casuals who don’t even know about pacifist mode to ignore it. Not fair on them 
---
Yep at least with the mutation one they had to be close. This can be triggered from anywhere !!
---
Impatiently waiting!
---
Different people have issues with different things. This game has issues and they should not be ignored or dismissed.
---
"The bombs fell on Oct 23"
---
Funny how you mention that, but conveniently ignore that we are literally getting an entirely new week-long event in honor of that.
---
Hang on, let me log in...  Are you on Discord?
---
Okay: I have S6, P12, E6, C5, I10, L10(+1 legendary).
---
I run a number of useful perks, not just damage, but the important ones are Sneak3, Commando2/2/2, Ironclad1, Covert operative3, Bloody mess2, Concentrated fire1, Gun fu1, and Escape Artist. Also, what platform are you on?
---
Travis was worse, until you did that quest that makes him a chad.
---
It seems to cripple more often, which is great since they can't knock you out of the animation.
---
The thing is, when any other developer makes screwy, buggy content or releases controversial updates or consumer-unfriendly game mechanics anyone and every gets in their shit, as well they should.
---
Over the years, Bethesda has somehow gotten a pass.
---
Game buggy? Part of the Bethesda experience!
---
Questlines so broken you routinely need to look up fixes online? Just Bethesda things!
---
STOP giving them a pass. No other developer gets such a luxury, it baffles me to this day that Bethesda does.
---
All because everyone wants a shot on a legendary to get their pick of zealots, troubleshooter sir nocturnal one star weapons from a three star.
---
This sub reddit isnt a majority of people keep in mind
---
The only way pvp can be engaged with pacifist mode on is in a workshop
---
None of that matters if theres no content left and repeating the same thing over and over blows, even if its "randomized". Its still doing the same shit over and over. Thats the core of the issue.
---
Two of the most defining aspects of fallout in the past have always been 1) wide branching story with player consequence (including a rich history of the area) and 2) freedom to be whatever kind of character you want, without being at a disadvantage. Speech checks always had several options for different stats so you could still pass them with different builds. You could play as a stealthy sniper or a PA laden heavy, etc, without being at a severe disadvantage. Both of these things are missing from this game.
---
Even ignoring, special, perks, chems, and legendary effects, the weapons arent even balanced. There are only a few weapons even worth using. For a while, energy weapons didn't even need to exist in the game, because there was zero reason to use them. The armor hardly seems to affect stealth, so there is no benefit to using anything other than the strongest non-PA in the game. The game has lost so many of the tradeoffs that used to make decisions impactful. 
---
Its just a shell of a fallout game. Until recently there werent even any factions to interact with or any decisions to make. It shouldn't be called an RPG, because the narrative is basically linear, you can't make any meaningful impact on the world, and the only way to play is to min-max character stats and end up in the same build as everyone else.
---
That link you posted there mentions there likely will be a Halloween event, just not the buggy one from before, however much fun it was. Isn't a little variety a good thing?
---
What does that have to do with anything? They explicitly said that it was not listed on the perk card but that it was intended to happen. For something like the radical mask they never said it was intended
---
Because Deathclaws are badass beasts and I already have an irl cat.
---
I ran into this this morning. I had already done the daily op before, but joined a group to help another team get it done in under 8. I did not have a quest marker, nor could I activate anything. But a teammate was able to.
---
It's no antibiotics, but it makes my camp's penis look bigger.
---
Doesn't sound like an issue that needs fixing. You just need to keep looking.
---
Toxic valley could just have a normal cazador.  With one wasteland that would be enough tbh 
---
Imagine a lvl 100 one
---
The mire could have a supreme deathclaw maybe even a gatorclaw
---
This is a post  apocalypse game, not a farming simulator.  But  it seems the down vote has replaced actual rebuttals to that argument so there is really no point in pointing that out.
---
Hell yes, it's ridiculous.
---
It tells you when you hit level 5 and the game has a whole help section on pvp. Personally I think pacifist should be on by default but still pvp is entirely avoidable.
---
Not saying it's the end of the world. I'm saying they clearly aren't alone. In the end these people are paying customers, with no less right to speak up than you, and their wallet vote outnumbers your own singular one. Welcome to capitalism.
---
Ok.but for rank 1 this would be great for a new build huh
---
Unarmed Weapons
---
&gt; At the end of the day, Bethesda is a BUSINESS not a free start up indie game. They need to make money. With 76 being an online game, the cant really charge for DLC because those who cant afford to buy a new DLC every few months would be locked out of the game due to the new stuff. So the Atom shop and 1st are what is funding the game and DLCs that we keep getting. Not to mention new games that may come out in the future.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Final note, can we at least be happy about the fact there arent any loot boxes a la EA
---
Start up indie games have to make money too, probably much more quickly than Bethesda. Bethesda have sold 35 million copies of Skyrim and Fallout 4 in the last decade - they can weather a storm of a bad launch to repair reputation. Start up indie companies have to make money from the start or they'll go under.
---
Online games have paid DLC all the time. WoW has expansions. ESO has expansions. Old players aren't locked out of the game because of not purchasing them. Fallout First didn't ship with the game's launch, so it's purely there to make money, not cover costs, otherwise it would have been included from launch.
---
I would be surprised if the thing keeping Bethesda in business for Elder Scrolls VI and Fallout 5 is the maybe hundreds of thousands they get per month (hundreds of thousands being generous) from 76 and not the hundreds of millions they have in the bank from their single player releases.
---
I'm not going to be happy that a game doesn't have loot boxes. Loot boxes are a bad thing. Not having loot boxes is the bare minimum any game should have. I'm also not going to be happy that Bethesda have spared us a fifth monetisation for a game that still feels incomplete. The four monetisation avenues (AAA title price, atom shop with in game benefits, subscription, pay to skip seasons) would be excessive in a game of absolute stellar quality - in a game that still has large problems, it should never be celebrated.
---
I understand where you're coming from with this post and I feel that there is some criticism of the game that is repeated and unwarranted. But that doesn't mean that there isn't big problems still in the game that should be called out. You shouldn't only praise a developer the same way as you shouldn't only criticise them.
---
Isn't there a timeout for looting after boss? I was kicked out twice.
---
Heard about aesthetics? It used to be better.
---
This has been asked and answered sooooooo many times.  But...
---
Gather Acid then Lead Ore.  Make sure to use Excavator armour when collecting the lead ore (4x).
---
1. Acid:  Hemlock Holes (3x acid nodes), Tenagra Town (Cave Crickets), Train Yard near Watoga (Snallygasters), Col Kelly Monument (Yao Gui), South of Wavy Willards in middle of toxic valley (Yao Gui).  You need 250 to 300 acid for one complete run at Lucky Hole mine.
---
2. Lead Ore:  Lucky Hole mine after getting Acid.  Chemistry bench at end of semi hidden passage for crafting and scrapping, \~500 lead ore = 1000 to 1250 lead scrap with Chemist and Super Duper perks.  Lead ore is lighter than lead scrap, so if you don't have a fallout 1st box then either fast travel to your CAMP or make lead scrap and then go down to Fort Defiance to make bullets.
---
3. Lead Ore 2:  There are also lead ore nodes on other parts of the map, vast majority to the South of Spruce Knob .  I've found enough of them that I can get as much lead ore outside of Lucky Hole as I can inside.  The basic locations are Dent and Sons Construction (3x nodes on small shelf at base of mountain directly to the West, 3x nodes south of that on another shelf along the same mountain range, plus more but you need to know where to look), Hornwright Testing site #3 (7x nodes just past the Excavator), etc.  One day I'll put a video guide together.
---
4. Server Hopping:  You can server hop Lucky Hole mine but you first need to bump the lead nodes off of what I am calling the "last items picked up list".  Another post mentioned that the first house in Summerville is a good spot.  Pick up all of the burnt text books, each are worth 1x cloth and there are a lot of them.  Afterwards you can jump worlds and first do an acid run, then go to Luck Hole mine.  You should be able to mine it again.
---
5. Rinse/Repeat...
---
BGS gives me the best entertainment option for my free time. Despite anything else, that alone for me says they do what they do well
---
Yea i know
---
Screw having it a skin, make it a standalone. Hell, even the Auto Axe from The Pitt DLC of Fallout 3 was found in the game files with a current-gen Fallout skin and several mods for it.
---
they are synchronized for everyone in the same server :)
---
Had this last season, multiple times. And man was it annoying at the very high ranks as it would take quite a while to go through them all.
---
Hey dude same here surge doesent have the key for me either and i have tried resetting console and server hopping with no joy, when i contacted bethesda they just said fill out a feedback form 2 days after i emailed them😂
---
To quote the great todd howard "it just works" 🤐
---
You can do both.  I’ m a melee build, but for certain enemies, I switch to a vampire gatling plasma.  (Before I got that, I used a Vampire 50)
---
I give a few points to perks like stabilized, tank killer (not sure if that one affects plasma)  and bloody mess to bump the damage a bit.
---
As for how well the gatling plasma  works....Couple days ago took on a L65 legendary SB.  Caught me out of my PA....I never dropped below 95% health.
---
What weapon were you using before the patch?
---
Nice.hope you have some fun..I know It's been fun for me
---
Unarmed weapons such as powerfist Deathclaw etc...
---
This is needed on PC
---
Yea i know i just feel like venting my frustration with the rest of the people that feel the same you didn't have to be so passive aggressive 🙃
---
no for real that clippy idea is grade a brilliant.
---
Todd give this man a job
---
In my best Dr. Evil impression possible: “riiiiiiiight”
---
Perfect
---
It is great, especially when I am tired of having to create those damn disease cures because I got dysentery from my own water fountain.
---
Due to grammar I'm assuming you're griving away a free PS4? I'll dm the address shortly.
---
Thanks man this set up sounds interesting to me! I’d like to be able to keep my melee strength!
---
Vats is what’s killing me , my build would be solid if rubber banding and just not hitting at all didn’t happen so much , definitely a pain to change out a full vats build because it only works “ sometimes “
---
Out of all the mediocre events they have created since this game started Mischief Night was by far the best and most enjoyable.
---
It's weird to me that they knew about this issue for a full year and were unable, in a year, to get the event up to snuff.
---
I did not even have any issues during the event.  I ran it probably close to a hundred times and crashed twice.  Hell I crash more during your average run of the mill west-tek run then I ever would at Mischief Night.
---
They should just put it out in the same state it was last year and players can choose to do or not to do it.  Why make the choice for us?  Give us the choice if we want to participate in this "broken" event or not.
---
Yea sorry. I just woke up.
---
It's not a bug.  The game knows you're looking for them and it intentionally hides them.  Of course I'm joking but I have noticed that with this game a lot.  When ever you are out looking for a specific thing, you can never find it.  When you're not, all you encounter is that thing.
---
I kill something like five Grafton Monsters a day, almost always up at Hemlock Holes.  I've encountered a couple fog crawlers but can't say I've seen any crickets or crabs.
---
And so is yours for other people.
---
So go leave, many others will keep playing and enjoying the game
---
I feel the exact same way, I just want to sit down and enjoy what I enjoy about the fallout franchise and although the game has issues, if you’re a long time player you’ve noticed a lot of those issues have been fixed. I’ve played on PS4 from the start and tbh at first the game was unplayable due to bugs and terrible servers but now it’s honestly good imo. I’ve enjoyed wandering the wasteland alone or tagging along with some randoms. It’s my game
---
Nah, I'm good with pissing snowflakes like you off right here, thanks.
---
Ehh, not really lol if your build has the damage cards for your weapon of choice it still shouldn't take very much to kill them
---
I am, I really really am.
---
Did people use them specifically for farming they were pvp servers first and foremost if I believe correctly
---
pass
---
You, in a month: "Where have all the new players gone?"
---
Lol, what an idiot.
---
Already did this. They treat there original player base like crap. They also can not commit to a scheduled on releasing new things. Now they canceled mischief night because of bugs. They had all year to fix it. They should really take notes on the way respawn entertainment treats there player base.
---
I have him always at my camp and he works fine.
---
But since the update all my allies stuck at the spawn place like 100 feet away from my camp build radius. This sucks. He don't move, just stand there and make his jokes...
---
I’m here for my free PS4.
---
That could be it, I don't really know, but this also involves a lot of horizontal distance, too.
---
Daily ops aren't intended to be solo'd anyways. Events weren't either but previously OP builds would just solo them anyways.
---
So maybe then let’s assume the company that receives the complaints and has accurate analytics showing how players react to their content, Bethesda, knows something about how to run their game? Since they actual have the data to substantiate their choices
---
I'm ready to cry
---
You know. The two last Daily OPs' enemies had "ultra perception" so you couldn't sneak.
---
Im not your bud, guy...
---
thats not really a good fix..it fucks up the textures even more..not shiny but complete black
---
I never paid attention to any of the negativity of this game..whenever I spoke to ppl in person bashing this game..they haven’t even played it..bunch of followers in the gaming community
---
I already sent it to your house. It’s in the garage.
---
I actually think there are a few low level legendary items that are pretty sought after. If your armor has the weapon weight reduction perk, keep and sell to other players. There are people creating mules that would love to have WWR for their lvl 5 character. Also, handmades at low levels are great for people trying to level up. I've bought a couple of those to grind out levels for second and third characters.
---
But, as others have said, most legendary weapons and armor are only going to be good for scrip. My advice, when in doubt about a piece, ask a higher lvl friend.
---
400 levels ago I used the Gutter as my prime weapon, it was a great weapon at the time.
---
He asked “people dislike NW” so I gave the explanation of why.  I think what I originally said of “please god no” was basically the “i don’t want o play NW, because reasons”
---
It's not unique. You can get the striped skin as a drop now.
---
Thank you for the constructive criticism.  I love the idea about being able to sell for scrip, caps and gold but I feel that Bethesda would never do that since bullion is supposed to be the end game currency.  That would be good for high end rare items.
---
My only issue with allowing camps to share borders is wondering how the game would handle a clump of 5 or 6 max budget camps super close together.
---
Because it looks ugly. If you don't talk about the problem, and just agree to them, they will never be fixed.
---
Fair enough.
---
| Heavy build with no mutations or charisma
---
Sounds like the ex wife :)
---
I think the point is that the game should be balanced in a way that you can play as whatever kind of character you want without being at a massive disadvantage. Thats what an *RPG* should do. You shouldn't *have to* play as one specific build to succeed, and changing what the build is with each update just frustrates people as they have to go grind a new type of uber build. If the game were well balanced, there wouldn't be a "best build" that everyone uses.
---
&gt; do you know how hard it is to actually farm lead
---
No, because it isn't. A single run through Lucky Hole Mine will get you somewhere north of 1k lead. Per run. I crafted something like 50k 5mm rounds yesterday from one Lucky Hole run.
---
Yes. It is funny watching those inconsiderate people die because now that the game vaguely presents a challenge they can't handle it.
---
Listen, if Bethesda is really, REALLY unable to actually fix the bugs in their game, if they are really so completely incompetent to fix the mistakes that THEY made in making it, testing it and releasing it...maybe they ought to look into a different line of work?
---
Because, let's face it, if a car manufacturer can't make a car that works, that car brand goes away...or the manufacturer does.
---
And it's not about something being "popular" it's about does it bloody work?  Can you release an item that actually works or does it bug out and have to be disabled (not fixed mind you, disabled).  Or does a feature of the game just not work reliably (fast travel for instance)?
---
Or are there clipping, lighting, animation, etc. issues?  Stability issues?  Major quests that just suddenly don't work and prevent any new players from actually progressing the main quest lines of either the vanilla game or its first expansion...for a month or so now?
---
No, Bethesda has never been "bug free" or "polished" but that stuff gets old eventually and you just have to start wondering, are they up to it anymore?
---
I'd like to think so because I have literally thousands of hours in their games and have enjoyed them greatly, but Todd's got to be getting tired of being the field captain for the Gang That Can't Shoot Straight.
---
His/her intent was quite clear. I'll just assume you're trying to be funny.
---
I found with robot it was alot eiser to just shoot them then bash to finish them off
---
Happens to me all The time. Its not the worst in the world
---
Upvoting because my sarcasm detector is working
---
Already done. I won't buy or spend a single atom or even log in to the game
---
It has everything to do with it.
---
Not trying.
---
This mans speaking straight  f a c t s
---
Hopefully an expanded Mole Miner story! Clearly there are two factions. The good and the bad (or maybe just misunderstood?). I want to have a NPC who can translate what they say, and you must travel with them down to the Mole City
---
Wait wait wait. You think Fortnite invented battle Royale or season passes? Your credibility just fell out the window when you said that
---
I'm pretty happy.
---
No...
---
Is it lvl 20-30 fresh players or experienced players w/ alts that are struggling?
---
They made a public comment yesterday saying they are looking at feedback and planning on tweaking things relatively soon. I would guess they are looking at buffing individual weapons as well.
---
This is my advice. Make or join the special ops team. Go to the special ops mission. And once there just wait. (The mission won’t start unless you walk away from where you spawned) so use that time to open lunchboxes. Take food or drug buffs. Although I recommend you do that for yourself before you join the event. So you’re not just standing there being useless while the team rushes and fights. 
---
Use the “follow me” emote so HOPEFULLY your teammates that joined the special ops team will know that the mission is about to start. 
---
I personally play with my gf and my friend. So we either wait for a random to join us, or us 3 just do it ourselves. We’ve gotten elder every single time so far.  So try to play with friends that have mics. Easier to communicate in party chat. 
---
I wish it was something like an event where it popped up on your screen so it’s easier to see. 
---
But unfortunately a lot of people miss it, or they already achieved elder for the day and don’t want to bother doing it again.
---
Yep, I was nerfed, but am finding the challenge enjoyable. If you're so unhappy, you can find the door.
---
i've never been to Lucky Hole mine, will give it a blast today and see what it's like.
---
would make for a really cool story expansion sometime in the future
---
imagine something like skyrims blackreach below appalachia :D
---
I am very happy.
---
Can you explain a little more?
---
You say, "knows something about how to run their game," but what does that even mean--because it could mean, and very likely does, operating this game at minimum operating budget possible while still generating revenue. That would explain the ongoing garbage quality control and the half measures about testing and listening to feedback.
---
Variety CAN be a good thing.  But if it means "you aren't getting the event you loved from last year but rather a new event that we will tell you nothing about but promise you will love it" then people are correct to a) feel amazed that Bethesda can't fix an event in a YEAR b) feel betrayed and c) be very skeptical about the new event.
---
That said, I never saw the old event and have no illusions as to what to expect from a new one so I can be cautiously optimistic until events prove me wrong.
---
Hey to be fair that is using DOUBLE the ammo you were using before. It's a shame we are all forced to play this video game under these conditions.
---
You corrected his grammar, so it's only fitting someone fixes your spelling. I believe it's giving away and not griving away.. that almost sounds like his ps4 died.
---
I think all they needed to do was remove all the cars in Whitesprings for the event. The crashing for all the explosions was the only real bug
---
I'm not your bud, hermano...
---
Wasnt aware this was new ive always had this issue figured it was cuz i carry alot of guns
---
Aside from my initial purchase of the disc, I haven’t put a penny into their pockets since. They’d lose nothing from me not playing. 
---
The only reason I’m going to give it another couple days to see if I’ll bother finishing quests now is that I have a magic shotgun, which appears to be the only weapon worth using at this point (for me). The game play isn’t entertaining for me anymore. And some will argue “post-apocalyptic blah blah difficult shit” all day long, but it’s still a game. And if a game isn’t fun, I’m not going to play. I’m not saying there shouldn’t be challenges, sure, but a group of mole rats shouldn’t have a chance at lowering my health at this point- I should be able to walk through most of the map unscathed- I’ve put in my time and leveled up accordingly. I shouldn’t now be penalized for my progress.
---
Either or really it being implemented would be a plus regardless of if its a skin or a standalone weapon
---
Please FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS HOLY fix the chainsaw. I have been asking for this since dinosaurs first roamed the earth. It's all I want. To our Lord and savior papa Todd, hear my plea!
---
As I said elsewhere, I come at this as a stealth commando main. I'm not blind to the issues but it really is trivial to work around.
---
&gt;Sure, you can switch, within heavy limits, to another build, but that's like saying "sure your legs are broken but walking isn't screwed because you can still pull yourself along with your arms."
---
See, this this kind of crying without thinking that bothers me.
---
OP with the rifle build could switch to commando with no shift of specials. If they burned all their perk cards/levels on maxing out legendary perks 3 days into its launch, once again, kind of on them but it's still fixable. Just takes a bit of time to get there.
---
Same too with all the stealth perks in agility. Likewise there are other agility perks (or even some other specials) that can improve utility and survivability.
---
People like you and a couple of others on here make it out like we're playing some MMO where have a fixed character build and you're actually screwed because you actually can't change a thing.
---
Builds and perks are so flexible, you can still keep some identity of your core build but tweak it a bit to suit the change in environment.
---
Once again, coming from a stealth commando, the very build that's supposed to be targeted and oppressed with daily ops.
---
The hud is the best by far for the helm.
---
I guess you could use a jetpack if you wanted for chest. But protocols is the only great chest mod
---
I don't know why this game doesn't have text chat
---
It wasn't due to balance - it was due to a bug.
---
For ages you had to strip down before entering power armor or the PA attributes wouldn't apply properly.
---
They really gotta increase the scrip limit to at least 300-400 especially if they're gonna make it so easy to get legendaries with the daily ops
---
I try not to think of Blackreach, fuck the Falmer and their Chaurus buddies.
---
I'm not your amigo, hermano.
---
I’m not your amigo, compadre?
---
Because I could legit walk through entire buildings, killing everything with just plague walker.
---
Probably because of the "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" effect.  That is, he'd rather have the event he knows he liked than a new one that is an unknown quantity.
---
And there is the lore angle...exactly why are bombs falling for a week, 26 years after the Great War?  And are they nuclear bombs, which fits the theme, or conventional ones which make more sense on one hand but less on the other?
---
You are still increasing your level. Go to the first tab in your pip boy. By not “leveling up” you are just not taking cards.
---
Hola! I’m a Bloodied Rifleman build. Taking me about 300-400% more shots to down something after the nerf..
---
It is utterly baffling to me that the deliverer hasn’t been in included in 76. 
---
They re-used basically everything else from Fallout 4. Just not my favourite weapon :(
---
Throw your excavator armor on and search every part of the mine. I frequently walk out with about 400 lead ore, which you can convert to about 1k lead scrap. The button clicking required in the chemistry bench is tedious, but by god I can craft 50k 5mm in about 30mins (including the trip through the mine and the crafting time) and not have to worry about ammo for literal weeks of playtime.
---
Hornwright Testing Site #03 (in the ash heap) also has some lead nodes and a bunch of iron nodes (for steel).
---
No cap means no timers.
---
Aka you'll have a 4 hour session instead of 4 days of 1 hour each. 
---
This has become a glorified mobile game.
---
Please read my post above. People just need to enjoy the game for what it is.
---
They were too busy breaking the game for half their players with this new update to fix it, obviously
---
It's a challenge...kept me from quitting.  Power is not one-shotting things, its finding a way to succeed under any circumstance.
---
I'm afraid, you'll have to rebuild from scratch. But hey, it's a good opportunity to find a new location and let your creativity shine!
---
well i would enjoy that cave system more if it didnt have creepy crawlers and ugly elves as well youre right 👍🏼
---
Yeah for sure i could imagine i used to have it named as the covert pistol in fo4 :)
---
The description is pretty straight forward I think a lot of you guys think way too hard about simple things
---
Ammo factory is not an option. You must get it.
---
There should be something to increase armed melee. Especially since you can't use "gauntlets" in PA.
---
And I'm really really very happy
---
I actually think they are going to work on that for The future. Considering the positive feedback from it
---
I like her a lot but I’d wish she’d stop commenting on me going deep into that one mine. 
---
I don’t remember when I did that, it isn’t anytime in the last 300 hours of playtime, please stop Julie.
---
well certain areas will still have minimum levels of enemies and I’m not sure how siloes
---
Work, but yea. The point of one wasteland was to make the whole map accessible. 
---
I disagree with this design, but that’s what they were going for.
---
I don't think it was on the chopping block really, but it was probably going to be thrown into maintenance mode until they could figure out what more to do with it if they hadn't started doing the Fallout 1st and the season stuff. I'm hopeful for its future, but there's a lot of issues that still need working out. Time will tell how well it holds up.
---
the event lasts a week. we don't know the structure of the event.
---
What, having the rank up graphics in the middle of the screen on a never ending loop? No, not the end of the world but pretty freaking annoying when you are in the middle of an event and you can't see where you are aiming :)
---
And yes you’re allowed to complain about stupid little things that can be changed with a little thing like saying there is a bug that allows me to have an unfair advantage over all other people in game.
---
They announced theres other modes coming for daily ops with a focus on sneak in the next one.
---
[link](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/09/15/explore-one-wasteland-and-more-fallout-76-patch-22/)
---
Agreed
---
I think that I read somewhere that you need to unequip or change the skin for your C.A.M.P. device and then leave the world and come back and then it will be changed.  No need to move your CAMP or rebuild.
---
I didn't correct anything.
---
You mean the daily ops with enemies that have inflated levels and exp? I think this is exactly what I’m talking about lol.
---
Complaining about Bethesda is a minigame
---
I try to do about 10 daily ops per day. I obviously do my best to get elder. And once I do, even though I know I won’t be getting another chance for a rare reward, I know I’ll still get legendary weapons (even if they are complete garbage)
---
Most of the enemies take 3-4 bullets to kill for me, with my shotgun or Gatling gun. So at the end of it, I always have a lot more ammo then what I ended up spending. Plus when you see your reward screen, you seek to get a larger amount of ammo as well with whatever gun you were holding at the end. 
---
They also drop a lot of stimpacks and radaway. Which sells for a nice amount of caps at the vendor. 
---
The experience is worth it, in my
---
Opinion. I actually keep the team in “casual” throughout the whole thing, and when the legendary boss spawns at the end, I switch it back to daily ops so we can get the event xp for it (I play with friends so they know this ahead of time) 
---
Doing daily Ops helps a lot with the level up challenge. I think it’s fun, and honestly pure chaos which is a lot of fun for me.
---
honestly, ive never leveld THIS fast :'D
---
That is exactly how a person's brain functions, so I would say it is all true. There's a good reason you (probably) don't complain about the overpopulation of deer in the SF Bay area because you don't have a reason to care, yet when I complain it's because I care that my front lawn is getting ravaged multiple times a month.
---
I will remember this fight but what’s your name again?  😂
---
For the most part yes. Though some perks like tenderizer are better for faster firing / lower dmg weapons since the bonus doesn’t apply to the first shot. 
---
With rifles I would focus on maximizing that first individual shot dmg in the hopes of crossing the 1 shot 1 kill threshold. If you find yourself right on the cusp of a 1 shot kill, try switching to instigating but keep the bloodied build. Instigating should do 10-20% more damage on that first shot against a full health target. That may be all you need for the single shot kill. For longer fights you can switch back to a bloodied weapon.
---
Thats not really a boss event where youre just fighting a giant bullet sponge encrypted can be done pretty easily if correctly done
---
If people didnt bitch, this game wouldn't change.
---
Also I don’t think they are plans, just the items themselves. But I could be wrong.
---
I have a Stealth Sniper and a Shotgun character. Both weapon types tend to be heavy so anything that reduces ammo, weapon weight, chems, food, etc. is a big plus.
---
I think a good chunk of the issues people are complaining about are overblown or just growing pains but having said that, I 100% support this action.
---
If it's something that you truly dislike and want Bethesda to do something about it, cancel your subscription and encourage others to do the same.
---
Sadly, this is the only known reliable way to get Bethesda to promptly respond to any issues with the game.
---
Don't forget scrip. Flat out scrip can be awarded as much as 50 per run!!! Its the new easy grind to purvy roll later.
---
Who decided that, you? In FNV you could beat the legion by just talking to Caesar. Todd himself said it's a soft core survival game. You don't have to sell me on a high damage build, I play the game that way as well, doesn't mean I can say others should play it the way I do.
---
The below video i threw together pre-patch, but I've been to most of these locations on a private server post patch 22 and still seeing lead at all locations.
---
https://youtu.be/MGniXDzyDHs
---
Thank you for your deeply profound and insightful thoughts. I am honoured to be in receipt of your virtual presence.
---
Charred ferals and gutsies do need a nerf and ballistic weapons a buff.
---
Not much point really then?
---
It will get worse on public servers if Beth doesn't fix the Xp-glitches.
---
ATM there are several glitches that lag the servers, old ones, still from beta. But due to the limiting of the mobs' level not really useful, until the scaling of OW.
---
a workaround for camp borders and server load management could be provided in the form of the proposed "camp Cells" (separate load space prefabs) or just add a number of prefabs that can be found or purchased with bullion or through the Atom shop that if placed in a camp remove borders and only allow for editing withing the prefab its self and a small area around any entry point. this would dolve the issue of server load. 
---
Keep in mind we already have a log cabin, red rocked garage, brotherhood bunker (seasonal reward) and others im probably not aware of.
---
As for the use of gold as a player to player trade currency. we would just default to the currently implemented trade notes. after all you can only ever trade in so many in a single day/week. this would allow players who have completed the "wastelanders" quest line to obtain this currency even if they did not have the time to invest in grinding events. (like myself, I only have around 4/5 hours to spare in a week to player call of the games i do) 
---
also keep in mind that trading in these currencies still requires that someone else has already obtained it through standard game play to use as a currancy to purchase an item from you. the "IOUS" given if a player was at max limit would only be tradable to the relevant NPC (vendors for caps, the pervayor for scrip etc.)
---
I agree these things are great! Wonder what today will be
---
Weight AND  reload speed? How didi not know about this card?
---
Same, the marker isn't exactly on the entrance so you have to nuke a little more as when you nuke the queen.
---
Leveling up doesn’t make those fights easier?  U mad as hell bro
---
The op claimed to be an experienced player with a new alt he made for scoreboard.
---
I’m bloodied, and still happy. My BE combat shotgun still kills a level 100 super mutant with a single VATS shot to the head. My BFFR plasma flamer takes what, .1 seconds longer to melt a ghoul? The only noticeable differences are with my handmade and Fixer, which both need an extra bullet or two. 
---
If your build is optimized, you’ll hardly notice a difference. If you’re one of the people complaining about a very slight nerf, then, IMO, you’re the same time that plays FO4 and presses ~, tgm, enter, and finally ~ so that you never have to worry. 
---
Fallout is a series set after the world has ended. Back in the original Fallout, deathclaws were something to be truly feared, and most people that said they saw one were called liars because almost nobody was able to escape with their lives. And now? Now we have people like you making posts complaining that one of the most feared things in the universe takes 2 seconds to kill instead of 1.5.
---
My name Jeff
---
You go to a burger joint for burgers, but I'd sure as hell complain if the soda was gasoline and I'm sure you would too.
---
I’m just thankful I kept a bunch of odd weapons “just in case” lol. Cause now those weapons are coming in handy
---
Seen this too.  I use shotgun so only one or two shots but sometimes looks like they have health left but then keel over.
---
I noticed that if I spam the X button (ps4) to confirm I want to travel and pay, that always works. 
---
If I do it normal, it doesn’t work. If I spam the living daylights out of it, always works for me.
---
Yeah, they’re paying customers. Who will pay for a game they hate just so they can whine about it. Because people are addicted to spewing bile anonymously on the Internet. That’s why they cry about remakes and reboots of movies and still pay to go see them in theaters rather than support original films. It’s why they pay MMO subscriptions and spend their time whining in chat about how the game is so terrible now. The only thing whining does is annoy the playerbase who have to hear the same thing every single week when they come on message boards. 
---
If it was actually about the content and not just having a boner to bitch, these people would have stopped buying long ago. But they’re here, paying for atoms and logging into the game, showing a successful property to the shareholders. Because that’s what “voting with your wallet” really is. An ironic maneuver to complain online while fueling the very entity they claim has others suckered in.
---
Welcome to REAL capitalism. Paying money to look like a loser.
---
Taking one for the team, is literal unless you are a pacifist.
---
Do ya know anyone willing to sell the suit or mask?
---
even with 50% the numbers dont add up.
---
Ded. Goodbye X.
---
I just don’t think we should be penalised for our progress and loyalty. Like I’ve literally been playing since day 1 and had Fallout 1st since it launched but this they nerfed everything, gameplay stopped being fun.
---
This is why i love the Gatling gun, already shoots slow enough
---
PSA if you’re going to complain about people complaining on a game’s subreddit, maybe find another subreddit.
---
Woman  👸 but you are very welcome!
---
My experience has been less stellar. I’m amazed at the number of “omg, I faced rolled and got elder solo. Get gud.” because with my weak ass gun it was a real effort to get paladin with my equally average geared, sub 100 friend.
---
We did it twice and the rewards were a 2 star, 1 star and 1 star. Yay? The ammo? Yeah the mobs dropped a nice amount of shotgun ammo and I came out with more than I went in with. Not quite the same story with a 50 cal. I’m burning through ammo and only picking up 4 or 8 .50 cal ammo from each body. And my reward at the end? 192 .50 cal bullets - yay? Definitely in the hole there.
---
Until I get a decent weapon I won’t be doing it with just one person and certainly not solo.
---
The game's tick rate is 20, and the servers aren't exactly what I'd call "snappy", so this makes some sense. With some high rate of fire rifles, I've also noticed that sometimes I dump my mag into a boss until I'm dry but when I reload the game says there are still like 10 rounds in the gun.
---
You know what would make me subscribe to 1st in a heartbeat? If they announced that private servers run at 60hz. I don't care about tents or scrap boxes or silly cosmetics, but good response servers would be killer.
---
No but just write this because you are one Xbox -
---
[XB1] H: offers W: bos special ops suit and mask
---
You think that was sarcasm? is my pain a JOKE to you? 
---
This game is a fucking prison! On planet Bullshit! In the galaxy of This Sucks Camel Dicks!
---
Then write in the body text what you have and the word offers can be changed to list, or be whatever items you have.
---
Agree with all except F1st being overpriced. $8 a month for $15 worth of atoms, Private World, scrap box, survival tent and unique cosmetics... Worth it... Would be worth more if they added the extra camp budget and persistent workshops they said were eventually coming with it though.
---
Jeeze this seems like an overreaction

I'm new to the game and only level 14. It sucks now. Reading all this talk from people about how what builds work and which ones were nerfed, and I'm not even at the point where I'm thinking about a specific build, I'm still just figuring out the basics of the game and trying to do some of the storyline stuff. The update made it incredibly tedious to try to make any progress on that front.
---
Most players right now are around level 50-100. This was the point we’re builds start to flush out.  Now builds need legendary perks to work. At lvl 25 you’re just scratching the surface of your build.
---
Yeah the place itself was awesome, and it's not that you can't outright destroy the crap out of the Falmer, there's just something about them that makes me think "fuck them" lol. Don't even know what it is, because they were just poor Snow Elves that time took its toll on, yet you have to kill them anyway because they're a bunch of angry bastards.
---
Yes I agree with you! This game was unrealistic with damage but like this game should’ve been like this since the beginning. I just hate that we’ve all gotten use to something and it’s all changed. But I feel as tho this is all for the better
---
Thanks for the downvote dickheads, but I'm right lol
---
This is, as we know it, correct. But I have my doubts. I’m more into duping than griefing.
---
Yeah, this is a very touchy positioning.  I don't know where the "this area must be nuked" marker actually is, but you can have the mine entrance in a radioactive nuke zone and still have it *not* count as starting the event.  There's no wiggle room when it comes to this Event.
---
Nothing you can do but rebuild.  Just be glad that's your only repercussion from having an exploited item in your camp.  Doesn't mater if you placed it or not.
---
Tbh, my issue is that the patch killed my stealth build. I by no means have an optimized build, and now, even with full stealth perks and a silenced weapon I'm getting seen from long distances after one or two shots.
---
I’m good homie.  I don’t feel shafted.
---
They should've gone either the Travis route, do some quests for her and then make comments about the things happening, or the Tabitha route, super mutant rambling with insane behaviour about anti-human propaganda.
---
Damn.from 38 to 45 in 3 hours that's nice.public casual team?events or did you stick to the story. I'm at 32 right now really want to rank to use better gear
---
They are good as long as the mutations are absolutely ridiculous.
---
*Ahem* resilient
---
add playernnames! 
---
after 0.1 seconds of thought i thing that "420pussyslaer6969" is not suitable for the office
---
People will always find something to complain about, some people actually live for it. But there are plenty of valid complaints and even bitching. This game, however fun I have with it, is still so buggy and uneven in many aspects, and it can very frustrating especially for regular players.
---
I personally am really enjoying the direction the game is going. however I do think that the new players need a buff until they hit 50. Starting a new character from scratch even for me who knows somewhat what they are doing is a pain in the butt. It was a pain before the patch, but now it's worse. I have the luxury of crafting and dropping good loot for a new character, but not all new players have that or can hope for it.
---
ESO gives damage and health buffs for new players up to level 50. As long as it's stated clearly and it's understood you lose that buff at 50 this could be a good way for new players to be introduced to the game, get used to the mechanics, and be more prepared for higher levels.
---
Also like it or not, the game is very optimized build centered now. It's not really a casual combat experience and require a dedicated build set up. While I can kind of see why that would bug some people, every game is like this to an extent. If you spread stats/cards it's going to be much harder.
---
Also anything semi-auto or with low DPS in general really got hurt by this patch, so I still think adjustments must be made. While I personally am enjoying the consistently high XP gains, more challenging encounters across the map, and am not worried about ammo, I'm also over level 300 with a solid heavy gunner build, good weapons and gear under my belt...so I can see why if you don't have that, you wouldn't be having a great time now.
---
Quality control is bad no doubt, but they’ve def catered to the community’s feedback. Probably too much as it’s gotten in the way of actually enjoyable new content. 
---
You act as if any companies job is to not make money?
---
Any other service game requires a lot more money from the average user or massively over-charges for add-one, despite fallout always having a much smaller playerbase than the top dogs. Not saying there aren’t problems, cause there’s a ton, but ever consider that Bethesda isn’t making however much you think they are on f76? You can only spend as much as you make.
---
Seems arrogant to assume you know how Bethesda operates when in your own words you said, “neither of us have anything to substantiate our claims.” If you like the game offer feedback and enjoy it! If you don’t, find a better use of your time. Beth Isn’t going to change their stance because you called them greedy.
---
So is your ammo reward at the end determined by how many enemies you kill?
---
I crafted I regular the fixer. Put the same mods as my  bloodied 25/25 the fixer. Only 30 damage point difference. Something needs to be done. Being a bloody the pay off for being a glass cannon was high damage output. With this update with buffing the enemies and nerfing the damage output has made this game unplayable.
---
So no one should have had any constructive criticism of the game when it launched in the garbage fire state it was? That's the stupidest thing I've heard today.
---
&gt; **They had a year to fix Mischief Night. They didn't :(** 
---
That's Bethesda in a nutshell right there. 
---
For what it's worth, it took Bethesda over a decade to unhook physics from FPS somewhat.
---
How are you being penalized? They made an architectural change that will allow for more profound balancing. My weapons still shred through daily ops for what it’s worth. 
---
Anyway, weapons will be adjusted. Maybe submit feedback on specifically why you would like changed? Or throw a temper tantrum and leave without any specific areas you think can be improved. It’s up to you.
---
I feel like you were setting someone up for the old Dane Cook "chief/gaylord" routine, but someone else went a different way...
---
I think it's filling up the ranks you already obtained previously, which is why you're not actually ranking up and the prize box is a blank image. Happened to me yesterday and i started counting how many times and it ended up being the number of times I had already ranked lol still a goofy glitch that needs fixed, but i think that's what it is
---
Like fallout 3 and 4 did
---
The time gates are so you'll leave and come back every single day for an hour~ at a time,  instead of a few hours all at once. 
---
Mobile game tactics.
---
It does not, as long as you stay offline. Same   goes for other perishable goods.
---
i have been seeing more and more people nuking the queen in such a way that requires her to be fought in the nuke zone as well.  while it is not impossible its a PITA.  Be responsible with your nukes people!
---
Spiting Fax
---
It will automatically unbulk it as you need it
---
Yes. These are called jokes.
---
Ok I put everything I’d be willing to give
---
If you're getting repeated crashes on the same activity, clear your cache. We used to have repeated crashes trying to start vault raids and only clearing cache would help. Its different on each platform on how to do it, Google search will probably turn up the steps for you.
---
Yes you do
---
It will automatically de-bulk
---
i dont think so, ill be more descriptive.If someone had a TSE combat shotgun and shot it at a wall.the explosive pellets would create a large circle of orange/yellowish light around the spot they shot at that lasts for about a second and a half afterwards it disappears.My question is why none of my explosive weapons have that effect and its just a cloud of dust whenever i shoot them. I see youtubers have that effect on their guns that dont have fire damage like miniguns
---
I agree, the scrapbox is the main reason I'm tempted to get a month of F1st, it's kind of a pay to win.
---
But did they reduce the atoms available in season 2? I know that 2000 atoms (season 1) in 10 weeks is so much lower than the previous 2300-ish available per month by dailies and weeklies, but did they reduce them to less than 2000?
---
Just curious...which ones?
---
No, it'll still let you build.
---
You are doing nothing wrong... you are enjoying it and having fun.. seems perfect to me !
---
I havent tested this actually. Intersting question but I would guess no. When I do it for the first time and want to get Elder I dont kill many enemies and I seem to get a bunch of ammo anyways. I will try this today after Op changes and will let you know!
---
Why do almost all 2A/QA people have such a hard time with grammar? Unless it’s meant to be understood that there is a group of countries with undesirable laws—not a country’s laws.  And is/are, still a struggle.  For example....That pizza place are filled with sex slaves.  There is bullets in my gun for the owners.
---
Which part was the joke? I ask for professional reasons. And for science. 
---
And snark. can never forget the snark.
---
Someone had it equipped and shared on my team and it did really help.  I had never used it before, and will probably invest in it for situational purposes.
---
Haha I had one!
---
I maxed out ammo one because I get so much ammo for barely any material. Then I got follow through for my sneak build and then I picked strength being I lowered my strength down when I changed build around , then I did perception so I can have 15 and move points from there to give to charisma, also picked intelligence and luck so I can get luck to 15 and intelligence up to 8. I’m happy with it and will switch around as needed. I scrapped every card I didn’t use and opened every pack. I still have 70 level ups I can use if I need to move stuff or just get cards for scrap.
---
Also you can write presents or you tend to have that thing removed :/ trust me I’ve tried cheesing it. I used them for my caps giveaways and my weekly gold
---
seen the Brahmin one and the gltiched enemy spawns
---
An extra bullet or two...that's unacceptable.!!.
---
lmao same here w my build it's all good
---
Awesome. All I got yesterday was shotguns, crossbows it was wierd.
---
Blimey that has more damage than all of my weapons combined
---
He could shift to commando easily enough, if he happened to have the nine commando perk cards or nine levels laying around to use on it.  Of course that's 18 perk coins he can't use to upgrade his legendary perks, so it's not exactly free.  And of course he'd have to modify his weapons to be automatic.
---
And while he could also switch out his stealth perks for others, he would have to either already have or purchase those perks.
---
And we ARE playing an online game (24 max concurrent players is not "massive" by any stretch) with fixed builds...or at least builds that have substantial costs (in time required to level if nothing else) to change.
---
And the "stealth commando" build isn't the one suff.  It's the stealth rifleman/sniper one that is.
---
If your build identity is "stealth" anything, when you lose stealth, you lose the identify of your build.  Oh sure you could stay a rifleman build I guess, retaining some aspect of your build but come on...
---
The actual problem of course is none of the above.  It's that Bethesda decided to do an op type that could be trivialized by a particular build.  A very common particular build type.
---
Did they adjust their op?  Nope, they just said "stealth builds are out in the cold" and went ahead anyway.
---
See they said "we want certain builds to feel like heroes" in certain ops.  Which is great...except that didn't make any build feel super, they made one set of builds useless.  They say they will make the new ops so that other builds feel like heroes...which, given their track record, just means that the other ops will shut some other build out into the cold.
---
They just need to design ops that everyone can participate in and contribute to.  Not equally perhaps, but without making a certain subset of their customer base feel useless or put upon.
---
😂 Yeah man I'm off the charts stupid, lol. We should have grouped at least, but alas, we didn't. We'll remain as unknown brotherhood strangers. Kinda poetic.
---
I’m a melee build As well. 
---
FWIW, I got my butt handed to me by a pack of L50 liberators at Morgantown train station.
---
I was in Buttressed SS armor (400 DR, 300 ER, an 400 RR)
---
 Being morgantown, was armed with a “fun” weapon - a chained all star whiffle bat. (L50, does on the order of 125 dmg.)
---
Dead before I killed the 2nd one.
---
===
---
 Anti-casual, I know, but tweaking your perks will help, as will obtaining a couple of mutations.
---
Perks: At minimum, Incisor3, martial artist3, blocker, barbarian, glowsight3, bloody mess.  Consider Nerd Rage.  
---
Class freak2 and starched genes2 (to offset negative effects and retain mutations)  
---
Mutations: Twisted muscles.  Marsupial. Healing factor.  
---
Scout armor is available in legendary varieties, but it will likely take time and a lot of scrip to get.
---
I retired my blade of bastet when I found a cultist dagger, replaced that with a vampire switchblade.  Its still my primary (although supplemented by a few others - like a swing speed ghoul slayers switchblade I use in Whitesprings and Radiation Rumble )
---
Huh? That’s not true at all... I work for a multi billion dollar company. We are closed until January.
---
after coming back to the game my loading screens only show 1 of my old screenshots instead of all of them, what gives?
---
I mean your original post is almost illegible because of the lack of punctuation, not to mention how rude, demanding and entitled it sounds.
---
Also you say "decrease lag and crashes" and "make increasing the camp budget 10000000 times easier". Are you a developer? Do you know how easy or difficult making those changes are? 
---
You're just banging the same drum that has been banged for a long time.
---
I actually agree about the Scrip, Gold and Cap limits but if it happens it'll happen. 
---
Also, CAMP budget will be increased with addition Vaults at the end of the year.
---
No, there should at least be a show of how many people want this to prove that it is a bug/nerf/buff that everybody wants. There are only 2 things I would want changed and that is the damage of the charred ferals and gutsies. Even then it isn’t a big problem, because I can just avoid them by either sneak or sprint past them to where I need to go.
---
Uh... huh?
---
I see. Thanks for the information. Just found it strange it was happening so much. Cheers!
---
My biggest issue is the leveling for lower level players, with pistol and non auto rifles. A 30’s level turret is harder than a legendary at this point. I have since encountered an assaultron since the patch, but I barely survived one lower than my level, and I bet now it would be impossible.
---
This is supposed to help lower leveled players wanting to jump in and keep playing, but it seems to have done the opposite effect. Wasted ammo, broken weapons and armor, and no good way to get enough lead.
---
Also an issue is with constant breaking of weapons and armor, and the lack of ballistic fiber and screws
---
The xp sucks for daily ops
---
The sneak attack buff is near non-existent if at all. I've sneak attacked a ghoul wanderer and had to take a second shot. That's fine while I'm cautioned, I enjoy the challenge of trying to hit a moving target to kill it. My issue is I stayed out of range of another feral wanderer (same level, literally the next enemy I came to), stood up, lined a shot, hit it, took another and killed it.
---
I'm ok with maths, but surely I should have needed a third or possibly fourth shot on the second ghoul if my sneak attacks were actually doubling initial damage?
---
I like the sound of your hunting rifle tho. Mine was explosive and 30% extra ghoul damage, but it was level 1 and is outdated now I'm level 26. Maybe I'll bring it back out to test damage compared to the standard 20 hunting rifle I'm currently on.
---
Currencies are different though, for me its equal to about half my salary
---
I did it yesterday with just 1 other person and we managed to kill everyone and beat it in time to get Elder tier. If you're having problems, yeah just try and speed run it. If you aren't having problems then get that sweet sweet XP.
---
There are two problems. Firstly, people with terrible builds that are very high levelled so they're getting pummelled harder than you would since you're still relatively low.
---
The other issues I've noticed is that some people haven't shifted their playstyle so they're playing 76 like a run and gun shooter where you could jump into a group of 6 or so enemies and slam your way through them whereas now it's just asking to be killed. Now you have to play it a little more like a tactical shooter where you need to be more selective with how you engage a group of enemies and use tactics to turn a mob of 6 into groups of 1 or 2 which you can pick off.
---
Well, that is unless you're a vampiric tank build. Then you may well still be able to run and gun it.
---
6:41 .. my favorite location by far!
---
Yea I’ve seen so many nukes barely missed WS club, Fissure Prime and now Monongah. People just need to get familiar with all the little icons on the targeting map.
---
Does any of the things I posted seem like someone might would accept that
---
The thanksgiving shelf will re-appear someday soon. Patience is a virtue \^\^
---
Well yeah, now that I know that's how it happens I'll be sure not to join one unless I've physically seen a team mate start it up. Hopefully this catches on and everyone can do the same to prevent it being a regular occurrence. The chances of that are better than getting the problem itself fixed any time soon unfortunately.
---
Overall I'm still rather pleased with this update, there was bound to be something wrong and if it's just an op here and there that gets halted then it's not necessarily a wright off, just have to look at it as an XP farming run and make the most of it that way.
---
I only complain about specific bugs in hopes that Bethesda sees it so they can fix it. They need to know if something blocks progress or hinders the game so they can fix it you know.
---
There can be constructive criticism. But constructive criticism is only constructive criticism when it is suggesting not complaining or demanding like a Karen.
---

the ivan ivanov ivanovski of raiders :'D
---
Jup, it's great fun although the blood eagle one from yesterday was a **blast**... ha ha
---
Do you use it in power armour or regular armour?
---
The reason why I ask is because it's possible that you are getting a magic effect from your armour (reduce damage while blocking by 15%).  Even though it's a melee weapon it might be doing enough hits per second for it to trigger.
---
A simple pedestal for a single display object would be a welcome addition.
---
Haha. Honestly the joke is the ticket submitting because we all get the same response. “We’ll pass this along.” Just wanted to see if I was alone in thinking we needed better emotes than duplicates and unneeded ones. But this is Reddit so I’m ready to be told to go die.
---
I’m envisioning a player in x-01 PA with a plastic grocery bag full of loose .308 rounds and frag grenades zip tied to their PA.
---
Instigating and furious swing speed melee and two shot guns with ffr. I have to retire some of my bloodied melee.
---
Where the hell are you that it’s 95% back to normal? Not in Boston, I will tell you that.
---
yup maybe 3 1/2. I used some of my lunchboxes, benefit from other player's lunchboxes, have a relativly high base int (iirc 10 right now) and of course i joined a casual team. Ever since they released the public teams, it's always the first thing i do when entering a server. I did a mix of quests and events (at least one radiation rumble got me almost 2 lvl-ups and to my surprise people actually gathered ores &lt;3 )
---
I think so, but I can’t guarantee. If I get one from my daily ops after I’m done with school I’ll let you know. Free of charge because everyone should get one. Unless I use it as part of another offer like I did last time. That offer 3 days ago best trade ever. I got a be gat plas. And I also used 8k gifts and a dc mask
---
I think people are just bitter because the spent a LONG time and probably a lot of caps gathering all this Bolstering Sentinel armor only for Bloodied to get reworked down to average usefulness. People hyper-focused on end-game Bloodied builds to the point where they lost respect for all other build options, thereby leading to them selling/trading it away AA, Junkie's, and perhaps even TSE stuff for some caps/scrips.
---
My main is a full health AA Fixer Stealth Commando, and I'm soloing Ops in \~7min because my character doesn't fully rely on stealth, being at low hp, or stacking damage food/chems. Can't stealth in Ops, so stealth cards were replaced with survivability and White Knight. Crits are very strong right now, so I went heavier on crit cards. Damage is not multiplicative like it used to be, so Bloody Mess was bypassed for Better Criticals. I'll admit I wasn't able to do the first Daily Op solo on my Stealth Commando because it relied on melee finishers, but I don't need to complete every single activity with that character. My Heavy Gunner was able to get it done just fine with an AAE .50 Cal and some Stimpacks.
---
As far as bosses like Earle and SBQ, I haven't experienced much change and am still able to dish damage out to the boss, clean up ads, and am more comfortable shooting off more ammo because the Ammo Factory legendary card is amazing at keeping me replenished.
---
Furthermore, when you get those Daily Ops like yesterday's Mutants with Freezing mutation, you can grind it over and over for Legendaries and experience. If you're one to complain about more ammo being needed to kill enemies, you can clean up the dead bodies for relevant ammo once the Op is over. Personally, I don't waste my time because again, Ammo Factory card is amazing.
---
If you're really struggling I highly suggest you YouTube Angry Turtle for his post-patch build videos. He will show you how to get by using easily attainable weapons and armor.

I’m not worried about new players. This update definitely wasn’t made with them In mind either. All we high level players can do is gift them meds and help with more bullets.
---
Good advice. I tried making my own team after my post. Two people joined immediately. Started the Op and I had no idea you could wait when you spawn in. Did so and the others joined and we hit Elder with 3 people with 4 seconds to spare lol.

Fallout 1st is 100x worse than a loot box given its a pay to win feature
---
If they want to make money maybe they shouldn't alienate their entire player base with piss poor planning and poor play testing so they can release a patch without fucking up the game in new colourful ways
---
"You want a serious outfit? THERE'S your serious outfit! Never ask me for anything ever again" -Bethesda probably
---
Im not talking about bug fixes, obviously bug fixes have to be made, what im talking about is when people claim things are "broken" because its a design choice they dont like, like they say one wasteland is broken because game is harder now, well, no not really, maybe the game is harder now, but thats a design choice not some wacky bug that makes you deal no damage.  
---
So I mean If your talking about bugs and bugs alone then yes I agree with you, but the thread as whole isnt about bugs its about people not liking the changes made
---
Lol that would be kind of you
---
Ive noticed with 2mm it gives you from 160 to almost 400 sometimes but i cant pin wether its based on kills or not. I dont think it is because of how inconsistent it is but who knows haha
---
I feel bad for seeing the bold questions be the very things I say, but thank you for explaining
---
Perhaps they hadn’t decided to can it publicly enough for an announcement. Maybe there is still a chance it will come out.
---
Agreed...however, new players are hurting.  I remember being new and overwhelmed, but felt comfortable at least in the forest when wood was gold, and fighting ghouls was tough, but doable with my 5-10 rounds. Maybe there are so few new players that Beth went all-in with the existing player base??? Doesnt really make sense though.
---
Sounds like a pretty good summary of the current state of affairs in fo76. I kind of like all the stimpaks because I use the medic pump torso mod on my PA during ACP and selling my excess stimpaks and rad-x / radaway almost cleans out the 1,400 daily caps.
---
I just saw a post that suggest Daily Ops will show some love to stealth players with adjustments in the future. Maybe they will swap out piercing gaze with a mutation that greatly increases enemies armor penetration when firing at us.
---
I mean it, also yesterday my stash got to 816 and I was confused so I emptied out and let some 260 fertilizer wherever I was. I know that’s off topic but still
---
It used to be 100 × 1.2 × 1.2 × 1.2.  Now it's 100 × 1.6.  172 vs 160
---
Rockstar with RDO are much worse than Bethesda and they get away with everything .
---
See, now this is a successful Reddit post.
---
I thought they had something to do with ESO.
---
No, you don’t.
---
It's clear that their developers are playing both new feature and bug-fix roles. They've rewritten large portions of the game, introduced many new events and items, added seasons on top of it. I, for one, am excited for more NEW content than rehashed stuff. I can't take any more meat week for instance. While it would have been nice to blow up some more cars and see what groups of level 100 assaultrons would have done at the end; I'm glad they're not just pumping it back in with all the old bugs. Who knows maybe they'll bring it back off-season? I mean it's always Halloween time in fallout
---
My mistake. Maybe they could have learned from them anyway.
---
Wait the glaive gets added to loot pools??
---
It has 76% positive reviews **despite** people trying to review bomb it
---
hahahah thank you so much for this information!
---
You can get mods for it from Regs in Vault 79.
---
That's what I thought too. I unequiped the skin in Atom shop. (that's the only way I know how to equip or unequip the skin). I left the world several times but my Allie still stucks. Always at an other point and my camp divice still got the skin.
---
It's just a fucking skin and not even for the settler . How is that possible lol.
---
Not available. Sort alphabetically and scroll past is the best option. 
---
But that’s a decent suggestion.
---
Sometimes the game just seems to get stuck. I hope this resolves it for you. GL
---
No idea *yet*. I assume so, but I'm also assuming it's part of the Mystery Pick list, which means the only places to get it are spending Scrip at Mmmurg (and I got no scrip after the recent sale!), or from a VERY small number of quests.
---
I used my vampires gauss mini and it shredded them
---
Well keep me updated lol bc I’m looking for suit and mask- I use a mini gun so it’d go with my style a lot
---
If you glitch behind the fence, you'll find &gt;!nothing! The mole miner just walks back and forth from out in the open to sitting on one of the rocks on the end of the cave off-screen. Also, you can't pick up any of the power armor pieces. The game won't let you. Also also you can't shoot him. He's essential (for some reason).!&lt;
---
I just want my ally to be able to wear power armor lol
---
Before bed, I pray to Todd Howard for its return
---
There's no tooltip or action for it. If you aim while using iron sights you'll see your view shift either up or sideways a foot or so when at the edge of a wall or corner. Works with scoped weapons too, but it's harder to notice for those not in the know about it. Doesn't seem to work in third person from what I can remember.
---
I recommend using one of the other subs. This one doesn’t allow bartering posts. You’ll get more exposure and more replies there.
---
I get ya... but even with the standard nozzle, my B25 flamer has higher Pip-Boy damage numbers than my Primed BE 50cal, and I'm full Explosive spec! So it's not exactly hurting to use the standard nozzle ;)
---
Turn on pacifist mode. If someone can kill you, they will.
---
Mole miners travel in large packs and are ~~not~~ over 300+ xp a pop.
---
I honestly haven't found any event to be toxic by any means. I guess I've just gotten lucky to usually end up in events with other like-minded players who will call out legendaries or sacrifice what they're best at to do something else. I won't lie though, I'm a bit worried to jump into daily ops because I feel like this has the potential to get toxic. Hopefully not.
---
Get perk batteries included. Never used it in two years of playing until recently I have right now. 2500 2mm I have 50 ult plasma cores 20 fusion cores and I think flamer fuel is counted for it also and it doesn’t show but .01 or .1 for the ammo
---
I'm so happy we have an unlimited supply now.
---
I got the vault 94 outfit, dont know if its actually rare or not though, i wanna get that symptomatic
---
No, it's an over generalization. A logical fallacy. 
---
Just because a red car wrecked into you, doesn't mean all red cars will wreck into you.
---
Just because one person cares enough to complain, doesn't mean everyone that complains cares.
---
So no, not true.

Thanks very much!

Did... did you read the whole thing? I address that TWICE.

It's definitely 50%

This is the type of mindset that does more damage to the community. What a bullshit post. No. We can enjoy the game and not enjoy bad decisions. We don't have to ask for more egg on our face after wiping away the old egg.
---
Because the Legendary Perk card system just dropped and, if you don't know where to look on the perk card screen, you can miss the button that opens the Legendary Perk menu.
---
Give it a couple of weeks for people to become familiar with it.  Then you can complain about the complainers...  (grin)
---
Lol!
---
No doubt. I must have bullied RNG in a previous life, because it really seems to hate me. :)
---
I like the idea of going commando before going commando.
---
It makes for some funny moments when a scorched takes a shot to the head then runs about 50 feet before its head explodes.
---
How about letting us just use the shelves they we are given instead of making them empty
---
What's exactly the problem?? If it's damage ask for some build advice my friend. You likely going to have to start specializing in at least 1 damage or weapon type.
---
I’m talking about those whom abuse glitches on the daily by don’t spam report other for using other minor glitches.
---
Yeah.  I've run one maybe once since the patch, and I lucked into having no turrets.  It's not an activity I randomly elect to do anymore because you really just want to get it done as quickly as possible, and now, it's much more time-consuming and resource-intensive.  If you combine running the silo and the bullets needed for the Queen, you simply aren't going to end up ammo-neutral.  Earle, you'll have some chance of getting most of those bullets back, but now, you could run Daily Ops and get more-or-less the same result without the silo.
---
*Beth Isn’t going to change their stance because you called them greedy.*
---
No, but they may change their stance if they get enough negative attention on their anti-consumer actions. Or are you saying we should all just be happy with our metaphorical nylon-bags-which-were-advetised-as-canvas?
---
This battleground isn't just about getting Bethesda to see a problem. I don't honestly think they care what I think individually. It's about convincing enough of the player base to see these issues and push back. Collectively we make a difference.
---
In that regard, I think your position is of being an apologist and it's because of people like you that we are even in this position to begin with.
---
A valid point. I never really utilized the swapping out perk card system, I really should try that. I’ve moved points around and gotten rid of quite a few of my ‘food build’ perks before, so that’s not the MAIN issue. I just believe that people who are roaming in the forest aren’t necessarily seeking out a challenge. It feels like the sort of extra challenge that shouldn’t be imposed on players rather than optional. I think they could have just made a separate mode for One Wasteland, with SCORE challenges that can only be completed in it, like NW. I’m not sure it’s fair to say that this is just how the game works; this significant change to the game’s dynamic came just under 2 years after it’s release. If it was perfectly plausible to get by casually for two years, why is it so implausible now? Why should casual players be forced to put so much effort and time into the more difficult combat if plenty of players aren’t playing for the combat? Why is the answer to those who don’t want to put in all of that elbow grease just “Play something else”?
---
okay, i never jump into any larger groups of enemies. most of the time I'm crouching and popping those heads from safe distance. And i never use any weight reduction perks etc which dont help me in combat while i'm in combat. i guess that helps too. Vampire...if only i would have the ammo for it, i never would use something else on my other char. But this one stays non-legendary till i'm done with all my quests XD
---
Well I'm only on rank 7 and I left it going for 10 min while I went for a drink, thinking it would fix itself, but it was still going when I came back. And even logging out doesn't help, I have to restart the game for it to stop :(   
---
But hey, if that's the only problem I get with patch 22, I can live with it :)
---
Exactly you know the Load Barring event. Yesterday i tried to do it but like the rubble blocked the entrance and didn’t move. So i posted about it asking if it’s happened to others. If that’s considered complaining then man ig i shouldn’t report bugs anymore.
---
I just went through and opened like 40 card packs since the update hit now, swimming in all that delicious flavoured gun now
---
Been saving my atoms hoping they release something good!
---
A lot of the bitching is warranted. Although there's a lot of bitching that has to do with how much people suck at the game
---
That's the real issue though, we get the "rolls" but it isn't what we wanted because Bethesda doesn't listen. Bethesda's "rolls" are like a gluten free flat bread, when we asked for light, fluffy sourdough or something.
---
We asked for a way to convert or break down ammo, and instead of a simple reloading bench or something we got the ammo convertor that's a huge waste of time to use. It's something sure, but not what people wanted. And Bethesda's idea of a grind is max limits, time gates, and caps on everything. That's not much of a grind, it's just frustrating.
---
It's a mystery but for some reason Bethesda doesn't know how to actually implement things the way people want them. Which might be fine since it is THEIR game, except that they do stuff so weird, in ways that no other game does. 
---
I get where you are coming from for sure, but in the case of Fallout 76 I have to say a lot of what people complain about is valid, however tiresome.
---
The comment I was looking for.
---
I was so disappointed when I started 76 that deathclaws were no stronger than a pack of mole rats. They were truly a force to be reckoned with, or run away from. Now you can approach one and it practically wets itself in fear.
---
Oh crap... that's what was happening. So many red triangles after scorched earth, I thought it was my teammates getting in fights. Luckily noone shanked me for my junk.
---
The only two things I care about, the BOS outfit (idc about the helmet) and the symptomatic machine to complete my BOS camps. 
---
The solar powered generators are cool looking. But don’t give much power to begin with.
---
Yes! But my hope is if they make it, they need to make a new model or animation.. If not we all will know where it comes from.
---
Would you like the **rare** rewards everytime you complete it? 
---
This last one takes less than 8 minutes to do. You get a guaranteed legendary, lots of aid and you come out with more ammo than you go in with.
---
"You should only complain about things that I think its okay to complain about."
---
It drives me absolutely nuts. For 40 dollars people get a game that provides them with hundreds of hours of entertainment, and then they complain about how it isn't perfect in exactly the way they want it to be. If you compare this to concert tickets, or the price of a nice meal, it really contextualizes the value. People get upset because the updates don't address the issues they want them to, or because the micro transactions are predatory, or the bugs are unmanageable. I don't understand it, you can get so much out of it for such little cost. I've been playing fallout games for the last 10 years and have encountered my fair share of bugs and unoptimized gameplay, I would never try and misrepresent that. That said, it isn't an unmanageable problem, and never has been. The games are fun, the worlds are intricate and engrossing the quests are memorable and fascinating, and in spite of the bugs and random issues, I have never felt jilted or cynical towards Bethesda. I think it's an indication of an extreme sense of entitlement that people believe a developer ought to provide a service for them that functions how they want, when they want it to. If I get frustrated with a game, or I don't approve of the choices of the developer, I find a different game, and I suggest to people that feel the same way about a game/developer do the same.
---
You need to min/max stealth buffs now.  Wearing secret service armor, using the sneak perk and skating by with unyielding agility doesn’t cut it on lvl 100 enemies.  Armor with full shadowed mods (meaning scout, combat, metal, robot or leather), a harder to detect legendary effect and a fixer will help considerably.
---
Legendary perks?
---
Yeah, I was never able to get this quest. Finished wastelanders and it's not something available to me. It must be bugged. Tried everything.
---
7:30, but with only 3 People.
---
Griefers be griefin!
---
Oh well when it happened to me, it didn't take nearly that long lol so scratch my theory 😂 but agreed, it's annoying but I can live with it til it gets fixed (:
---
Yeah last season I played so much nw it was crazy plus I wanted to get the Halloween and christmas rewards so I went from level 1 to 30 and never bothered with but one challenge for nw this season. Not stressed about them so I rather not have it like that. Because nw sucks I think imo
---
Seems they have. I scrolled through the chart thing and noticed how less there are of atom rewards but I haven’t done the math yet.
---
Ha ha your tears give me life.
---
5:40 Team of 4
---
Im after any CAMP items I can get, even if its just for the option of building it later on
---
Jesus christ dude, it's been like an hour, calm yourself. Only toxicity I see in this thread is from your response here.
---
Nope, your just fine. The vast majority of the complaining people are players that leveled up like crazy and didnt put any thought into optimized builds or even a decent set of perks. The others are ones that just want a constant easy mode and are spoiled to being able to one shot everything. The main thing is to have fun playing. As long as you enjoy it and have a good time that's all that matters
---
You know, I forget people don't research and read when new updates happen. They just wait for others to tell them what's going on. 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Depending on your weapons and build you can profit big time! Went in with 300 ultracite shells, left with 1100.
---
Take one for the team legendary perk
---
Yet I'm still seeing plenty of one-shotting going on.
---
What are your thoughts on the Legendary Script capacity? In my opinion i feel as if they really need to increase the amount you get per day specially now with Daily Ops you know?
---
Yeah, there is definitely a pop up in thr top left corner of the screen. If you wish to start one, when you land - do not move and the timer won't start, this allows your team to travel and pop lunch boxes etc. Some people need time to check weapons and armour are repaired before they come 👍
---
&gt; I hope you understand that if I give you some placeholder numbers *as an example* you can't really make a point the way you do...
---
yes, i can, cuz the placeholders you choose in no way represent the sheer volume of time required to progress legendary perk cards at all. we're not talking an hour or two to make a fully ranked card, but more like 50 hours of nonstop experience farming to finish ONE card. playing normally it would be closer to 80-120 or some bs like that.
---
&gt;Let say, if I play 1 hours and you play 9 hours, you can't make your point anymore...should I get an 9* experience buff to be able to catch up with you?
---
and now you're throwing a false equivalence at me. you are also disregarding that the guy with 9 hours is the one who gets fucked for playing more than one character. his 9 hours of progress become fractional when he plays more than one character. 2 characters? 4 and a half hours. 3? 3 hours. 4? 2 and a quarter. it doesn't add up to 9 hours of play in this system, it is only ever 9 if there is only one character.
---
&gt;In persistent world, people who play a lot or who focus on a single character will always get a progression advantage.
---
except people who play a lot on multiple characters do not get a "progression advantage" under the system as it currently exists. you can only progress on ONE character. imagine if ESO had done the same thing with its champion system. nobody would have an alternate character. they'd only ever have one until they hit 810 and then moved on to the next if they really wanted to.
---
Daily ops is all about team work, if you apply yourself then I can't imagine much will go wrong. Team players go a long ways in ops. I guess I'm just not as good of a sport as I think I am in public events at least.
---
I love watching these turds cry while I'm racking xp off these lvl 100 mutants. Unfortunately I still see a lot of level 50 and 75s though I was hoping they would all be 100
---
The xp from daily ops are terrible.
---
No, but I’d like it at least once. Again, YMMV, but I’ve been getting a better return for my investment doing my companion daily quest.
---
the new humblebrag meta is to say you're a casual player these days.
---
I get all kinds of issues with the berry mentats glow.  Sometimes it works indoors sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes it will be working and I'll fast travel and it goes away.  Hard to pinpoint exactly what the issue is for me as the effects come and go.
---
Can confirm the chem fiend thing too.  It doesn't highlight for the extended duration at all.
---
Yes I used to use melee all the time when I changed my build to carry more and I ended up having a bloodied death claw and frog axe and loved them. With no perks I use to be at 1k damage with them and now it’s at 400ish. I use my dcg 2 star the other day when we had to melee the robots and it did it in two hits
---
Very good points. To go with that, I was leveling up and just banking all my card packs till this update, but wasnt like a goal. And prior to the introduction of the S1 Legacy Run I didn't care about levels at all once I got the cards I wanted. But well said and thanks for the response!
---
I suppose so, I hope he doesn't blow those caps on overpriced ammo at least.
---
And people think that’s worth 25k? Don’t get me wrong it sounds cool, but not anywhere near worth it imo. But if you are giving it away for free I’ll gladly take it.
---
Yes you dont
---
This, I'm not having a go at OP at all, but there's too much complaining about something that people are absolutely clueless about and couldn't put a game out anywhere near the level that Bethesda does. I'd like to see them all try sink as many hours as we do into something of their own creation that's "sheer perfection" the way they demand things be changed like they know any better.
---
VATS targeting "already dead" npcs. new feature. it just works
---
I could be wrong, but perhaps one of the STR cards might be like lone wanderer  (No stars lit in the card but still counts as 1 point, 1\*=2 points,etc.)
---
Pretty sure vats does work.
---
But I dont think you do practically any damage on the first shot in pvp
---
I have a BE flamer, and yes it breaks like an egg, but damn it still has a major punch even at 50% HP.  I was going to try Gunsmith 5, but ive heard it doesn't work well.
---
The disease cure machine looks amazing. I’m going to be doing this event until I’m done with Armor Ace, so hope springs eternal.
---
Just wish the incentive to complete the each time was slightly better and only slightly. Completed elder this morning solo because no one was running ops. Same with yesterday
---
I recently started my first alt to get plans I couldn't off my main, nice bonus to be able to knock out some SCORE and such with it as well
---
I was already using maxed out rifleman perks, tenderizer, and bloody mess. I dont think there is mutch more I can do to bypass the nerf my build got. I guess I'm supposed to start looking at take one for the team and mutations.
---
Oof big facts.
---
Oh I completely agree with you. It’s just “what pc buyers might pay for”
---
I know the price isn’t accurate, for certain weapons and armor. But like I said, instead of me scrapping it for script, I figured maybe somebody would like to take it and see if they can make a profit, or they need it for their build.
---
Can I ask you for help? What’s the best place to find lead? I’m a pistols and rifle person. I’ll look it up as well, but I would like the insight of a veteran as yourself to help find the best way to not be worried constantly about ammo. I’m a level 34 currently.
---
7.40 solo
---
Edit: 7.23
---
How about we also get new tunes with each release? I need some additional variety.
---
Especially with the placement issues since your gonna need a lot of flat earth.
---
I gotta admit though, always happy when a lvl 500 or so shows up to run ACP or Ops or whatever with me
---
The mechanic was always there, it was just separated by region before. You couldn't start at the vault, and then go straight to the Cranberry Bog and expect to survive. Now it just spreads that out so that the challenge matches your level everywhere.
---
As for your build, you can keep your QoL perks. You just have to swap them out for combat perks when you go out to explore and fight. While you're at your base though, it's feasible to keep your harvesting perks running.
---
I'd rather see players rise to the challenge, not quit. It's not that difficult or time consuming to pop a few ranks into some combat cards and make yourself more viable in combat.
---
Absolutely
---
you know why.. LOL
---
I'd love for it to be reflective of reality and take .38 rounds. You know, actually name a 38 worth carrying.
---
You mean those 5cap per fusion cell vendors 👀
---
Woah really! Awesome, can’t wait to get my mits on one. Such a bad ass weapon
---
Honestly, while the Thanksgiving displays are nice, it's not really what I wanted. What I wanted was a version of the bare metal shelves that allows us to display our stuff. Basically I want a display shelf unit that I can throw a few bottles of coolant, a couple of old oil cans and a few wrenches on in my own CAMP "garage" (the area I have my crafting benches set up) and hell maybe even leave a few fusion cores just kinda lying on a shelf next to my PA station.
---
That's what I wanted. Something that fits in with a garage workshop, and the Thanksgiving shelves, while great for displaying "nice things" in the house, just don't work all that well, from a strictly aesthetic standpoint, in a garage/workshop setting.
---
Edited to add: I would also like this same functionality for tables and nightstands in the game. Have a couple of glasses and a bottle or two of Nuka just sitting on a coffee table in the living room. A pack of cigarettes lying next to the bedside lamp. It would really help to give our CAMPS a "lived in" feeling. In my own CAMP and in my visits to others CAMPs they by and large look great, displays and decorations galore, but they ALL look too neat and tidy. There's no daily mess that comes from living in a space for any length of time. Most CAMPs tend to look like some kind of knockoff of an Ikea furniture display. I would like the ability to make my CAMP look like someone lives there. That's all.
---
Or shot gun shells at anything above 1 cap. I've seen people even sell 5mm for like 4 caps, its nuts.
---
Yeah I tend to be a team player so I should be alright. Might give daily ops a shot tonight.
---
As for your experience in RR, that sucks lol. Dude should have realized that you weren't trying to hit him but some people are just gonna be assholes about it. I was doing Scorched Earth for the first time on my current character and accidentally hit another player, forgetting that I had to turn pacifist mode back on. I turned it on and have them the sorry emote and they hearted back so lucky me I guess xD
---
Doesn’t have a gap with the flyboy outfit.
---
I just visit white springs for disease curing that way those damn things aren't taking up inventory space
---
That must have changed.  I bought motion assist servos for the torso and bracer mods for the arms at either WS or Modus, I forget which.  But its been something like a year since I got those plans.  
---
When I asked here about targeting hud and calibrated shocks, multiple people said those two were very rare SBQ only.
---
7:43 solo
---
Sure, blame the guy that disagrees with your self serving analysis of the game for the parts you hate. That makes *so much sense*. Mind=blown.
---
Bethesda's loot box equivalent is the Scrap Box that is only usable with 1st membership.  And buying up your level ups for the seasons with atoms is another blatant money grab.
---
And DLCs - if you're talking about this seasons crap - its piss poor content that isn't worth paying for.  A proper DLC would require them to do Wastelanders type storyline content releases on a regular basis - you'll never see that, they will just milk you and give you quick/easy/cheap "updates" which is basically reskins and a few things you can build in CAMP (who even has any CAMP budget left?!).
---
That's the biggest problem - there's no real meat to 76 content updates that justifies giving Bethesda any more money.  Everyone should just cancel 1st, sign off and let the game rot.  Go find another game like OP says, I know I did.  Cause it stopped being fun when they went overboard with monetization and grinding for the sake of grinding so they can produce less content updates.
---
that was not a serious post. 
---
So much for the worlds greatest detective.
---
Totally have to remember to pop a lunchbox next time duhhhhhhh.
---
I can see that yeah. I just went and grabbed cards for Commando now in case I wanna switch from Rifleman later, good point. I kinda thought most cards would be obtained by now. Have they ever added new cards? I stopped playing for ahwile, think the bow stuff is new yeah?
---
Get off the game then 🤣🤣
---
Too soon, resets @ 1pm EST.
---
Thank you. I was bracing for an onslaught of people telling me I'm wrong.
---
Just go to white springs golf club, kill everything, and tell me the right exp isn’t inflated
---
Exactly. It just isn’t worth it. I wish I got the symptomatic instead.
---
How am I gonna get my pumpkin decor now..?!
---
Is the the power armor visual glitch?  
---
Where if u got score while wearing PA the score meter wouldnt show until u exited the PA.
---
Question for you since I haven't received that plan yet. Does its condition degrade over time like food and drink, or does it have an infinite "shelf life" like stims and chems? Also, how much does it weigh compared to the vocal sac you need to craft it?
---
I tried to fight a glowing ghoul yesterday and it put out more damage than my unarmed instigating power fist build with adrenal reaction (with glow sighted). It out-dpsed me shot for shot and killed me. Something is a bit off.
---
Say I have an instigating power fist with no other bonuses. I equip a mutant power fist (10% damage when mutated) with +1 strength. My damage goes up from 250 to 262. Which was my experience with adding the legendary +1 str perk, my damage went up by 6. Which is very low and arguably not worth it.
---
Melee doesn't always feel weak but when it does, it really does. Someone I played with said their sneak rifle build was still hitting over 1k crits. I assume we'll see some tweaks, hopefully.
---
I will add that I do like this update. I really love hack and slash.
---
I am excited to finally hit 200, so yeah there is that
---
Line in the Sand prior to the no-tent zone being expanded would turn into an arms race every time. It was like the cold war sped up to 10 minutes. It might start out with everyone trying to tag as many enemies as possible without killing them but almost without fail, by the final wave you'd have someone trying to time an orbital strike grenade to hit right as the next wave spawned so no one else could get any XP.
---
That's what i'm thinking too. But to be fair i'm far away from having a optimized build. My best guess is some weapons need a lil bit of extra dmg and everything will be okay. I hope bethesda dont do a 180° turn and make everything weak again.
---
No they won’t. You can’t really put it inside a building at all.
---
Especially if you just bought the game. I waited for the Wastelanders update and positive reviews, because I felt like it would flesh out the immersive world experience I expect from the series. And I was right, I couldn't keep myself off it for the past month since I took the dive! Now I don't feel like I got my money's worth.
---
&gt;He could shift to commando easily enough, if he happened to have the nine commando perk cards or nine levels laying around to use on it.
---
Not even 9. Just 3 will get you 50% of the damage bonuses right there. The rest you can work on over time. That is if you needed it. that 30% damage bonus might just be enough.
---
&gt;And if your build identify is "stealth" anything, when you lose stealth, you lose the identify of your build.
---
Umm... so we're just going to overlook that whole rifleman part of the build because it's inconvenient for the argument?
---
All you do is lose the stealth part and only specifically for a single event/game mode. It's overly melodramatic to say that a build identity is gone when it's just that tiny slice of content. You're still stealth rifle for the rest of the game.
---
Also as I said, we're day 3-4 in the new meta. It's going to take us all a bit of time to adjust to it. Shit doesn't happen overnight. It's a process.
---
But if you're the sort to just cry about it and not adapt, that's on you. We have the means to adapt to pretty much any challenge due to how flexible the character system is.
---
So, why now, you know, adapt. It's very doable. 
---
If you'd rather not, join this dude and show Bethesda how displeased you are by cancelling your Fallout 1st sub (if you have one) until this issue is addressed.
---

---
He didn't say fornite invented it, but as it is (maybe) the most profitable game right now, many games are implementing similar things to get more money.
---
And now with them just copying a season of Marvel's heroes, damn, they're going to earn REAL money, so other companies will try similar things.
---
Him turning and killing you isn't really toxic, pacifist mode is there for a reason. If someone was shooting me in a public event I would turn and shoot them aswell. I would do it once or twice to a low level -30 but anything higher I would keep killing them aswell until they turned pacifist mode on. 
---
The way I figure it is this, you are spamming my screen with stupid "under attack by...." So you can die and give me some caps to say sorry.
---
VATS does work in PVP but their is a delay (as stated above). Also, the gamma is effective vs bloody builds. Most people stalking/PVPing are going to be full-health SA Armor + Junkies
---
When no one gets the ore and all you want is rad barrel and hazmat outfit. There will be 6 to 8 people at it and no one else gets ore. If everyone just picked up 2 sections of ore we would be golden. Drop it at the end when 30 seconds are left. Thats the only event that is frustrating to me.
---
Yes it's 2h and it's attack speed is slow.
---
Propably yes, on trading sub. As trading is against this subs rules.
---
I agree on the builds. I was bloodied before patch 22. Im glad it brought others up to standard.  I actually respec'd from bloody commando to heavy guns for this patch. Now i may even swap out the heavy cards for shotguns to mix it up...and that would of never, ever happened before patch 22
---
Weapon artisan, gunsmith, white knight. If your problem is durability, then just spec into it.
---
I'm a bloodied melee and even though they still haven't fixed where I constantly have to hit a creature for the hit to actually register; I still keep playing this game. Hitting the same enemy over 5 times is extremely frustrating and it got even worse after the patch. 😪😭
---
IKD just sounds like free junk to me
---
Damn that sucks
---
It don’t matter how high it is. I use to believe that it was but I use to die so quick. Being im bloodied but I started using perk cards and even with a sliver of health I can take a ton of hits. My dr is only 300 something with all secret service unyielding armor and 288 if I use one piece of chameleon marine armor
---
People have a right to complain if they bought the game and if there a lot of complaints about one thing maybe that one thing is shite
---
Bloodied melee should be pretty OP. Are you using nerd rage? Keeping health under 20% to trigger it? Using regular damage perks like bloody mess? Serendipity for avoidance, etc? Everything maxed?
---
Personally, I don't run with QOL perks and swap them in when I need them. For example, if I'm overencumbered I'll swap in strong back or thru hiker (and others). If I'm scrap/crafting/repairing, super duper, scrapper, weapon artisan, etc. Anything that you use for fighting and avoiding damage are the priority cards to run with.
---
My biggest issue is that I sometimes forget to swap cards back in and don't realize it until I'm hitting enemies as if I wield a wet noodle.
---
What do you mean "farm" for the fixer? You mean the plan?
---
The Eugenics War predated that by about 30 years (mid-90’s in a timeline obviously alternate from ours).
---
Casual nerds sometimes get the Eugenics War and WWIII confused.
---
That was another pathetic display that people at Bethesda don't even play the game. Now it will take us a long time to use the season reward. I wonder how many more of the season's rewards are broken too.
---
serendipity, 1 in born survivor, nerd rage and dodgy obviously, lone survivor if you don't have them
---
maybe hack and slash if you have enough ap or collateral damage for legendary perks
---
if you do go with vats better criticals and/or crit savvy
---
maybe try ricochet
---
and chems for more damage reduction
---
Sounds exciting, I didn’t realize they buffed this event as well, gj BGS!
---
When did I say I was an apologist? Where did I say I was happy with the state of the game or that we shouldn’t voice concerns? “People like me” are around because people like you prefer to assume we just bow to Bethesda everytime they make an update.
---
- What I said was you have no idea how Bethesda operates, but assumed you did
---
- No idea what the majority of players want, but assume you do,
---
- Like to generalize others and consider yourself a representative of something that isn’t that big a deal
---
To that end, all you’re doing is polarizing others away from agreeing with you. If you want to represent a collective voice, you have to speak with respect to their reasoning. Not generalize and dismiss anyone who has a different opinion when, once again, neither of us know the actual facts.
---
There's a new vendor glitch?
---
even at 335 there were many cards i didn't have. i assume the bow ones are new. I also stopped for a long time.
---
I agree. Just hit level 59 and I'm loving how fast I'm leveling! It seemed to take forever before this patch.
---
That’s true, but people expected to survive in the forest. That’s why the game is split into the different regions in the way that it is, so that you can have at least one area of the map where you can relax, and combat isn’t a worry. I strongly believe that One Wasteland should have been made a separate mode, with separate SCORE challenges to incentivize playing it.
---
if they made fallout 1st 60 dollars instead i’d be happy
---
Gotta admit, when I read the title my first thought was "Whoa, buddy, this isn't the subreddit for that."
---
But after reading your post, it reminds me of the dreams I had of filling a bathtub full of pre-war money.
---
I just don’t want the rewards to be limited.  I’m not even a fan of seasons for that matter.  Not a big fan of being forced to do things in a set time frame.  If they wanted to add new rewards for people rank 100+ I’d give my support, as long as I don’t have to play the format at anything other than my leisure.
---
This happened yesterday afternoon. Launcher and five others stood in the entrance shed and shrugged at each other.
---
Neither of my builds are 100% optimized either but as long as you have a good set up with damage boosters and some defensive cards you'll be fine. I doubt they will change it completely, I see them doing a lot of balancing and tweaks but it wont go back to how it was
---

---
A boss behomoth event would just be so dang cool. Man just thinking about that gets me excited for the possibilities
---
As a destiny player. Trust me when I say, leave and come back later. The game won’t die and be gone forever before you decide to come back. Instead of playing a live service game may I recommend hypnospace outlaw or anything that’s just a fun game. Trust me. Stop complain and start having fun playing games.
---
Yeah from what I’ve herd people can one buy things from your vending machine for free, and some have taken items from peoples stashes through the vending machines. Sometimes they are actually accidental but I’m not taking my chances
---
...so the answer, rather than asking for Thing to be fixed, is to exodus from a game that you've generally supported and enjoyed so it ends up shutting down as just another failed live-service? It doesn't seem like your opinions, and those also telling people to take a hike, lines up with even what Bethesda would want.
---
Right underneath "Updated 2020 Roadmap &amp; Community Calendar" in the first block of text.

---
&gt;because you believe that in order to play you have to be 100% combat orientated doesn’t make it so.
---
Me believing it doesn't making it so.  The fact that people didn't spec for combat and are getting their asses kicked- I'd say that  makes it so.
---
Daily Ops is super easy. Spawn in, run to the objectives and turn them on, stand next to them and shoot stuff. Run to the next one and repeat. Finally, kill a boss. Just follow the waypoints and there’s nothing to get toxic about
---
Today a mutie glitched into a wall, made me run 15 secs to him and I ended up with 8:15. GJ Bethesda.
---
Oh hell yeah! I’ve been running 2H melee for a while, this just might be a new main squeeze if I can get it!
---
Not initially no imo but intentionally walkin in front just to murder someone yeah. Obviously this could have been avoided. At the end of the day OP’s first move should have been to enable pacifist mode but i’d be surprised if there weren’t players out there who don’t know it even exists.
---
That's what you food builds do you turn on passive and when someone YOU think you can take hits you,  you turn it off and kill them but otherwise, its "WhY ARe YoU HiTTinG Me GWEEfER!"
---
Shoot him through the window.
---
Don't  go into 94 alone...all I'm saying.
---
Or an adolescent Travis miles
---
You should probably send a ticket to let them know this is happening. I haven’t had a problem on xbox yet. So let them know.
---
So there won't be a way to get the Halloween and outfits. Damm it been waiting all year for this I missed the last one.
---
I’ve given up on trying to post on the marketplace sub. The titles have to be so specifically worded just to make the post it’s not worth the effort to me.
---
Why did my question get downvoted?
---
There are dozens of costumes in the game, and limit yourself to one? This is silly for MMO games. Before to Update 21, this backpack worked correctly with all suits.
---
im a junkies heavy but i feel for any build you can run blocker, especially since your melee and will always be up in there face and will probably get meleed back and it would lessen the damage by 45% if you max it out
---
Yeah I can’t understand why they made this change, the old one was perfect...
---
It takes no time to level up anymore, early levels are kind of rough without a decent 3 star but after you get an optimal build going, levels 50+ is a breeze. Easy to respec.
---
That was me lmao wrong button
---
This!
---
Yup aint all or nothing thinking. Ppl who usually complain are closeted masochists and they'll come on here to complain as a form of catharsis and then a couple hours, maybe days later go back to the game and be like "okay w/e I sort of still like this game anyway"
---
Ahhh, Bethesda’s red-headed step child....
---
The misfit game mode for its misfit gamers
---
&gt; "Theses bloodied stealth guys keep one hitting everything and I never get legendary drops"
---
&gt; -one wasteland comes out and brings player nerf and enemy buff-
---
&gt; "OMG unplayable after the nerd, now I have to take an extra 2 seconds and spend a few more bullets to kill this scrochbeast"
---
&gt; "How could they do this, I cant one shot everything anymore now it takes 2 shots. I'm spending soooooooo much more ammo now"
---
Yeah.... The people making the first complaint aren't the people making the next two.
---
One Wasteland made gameplay worse for all those people without a mixmaxed build.
---
Sure, the bloodied stealth guys can't one shot everything anymore, but everyone else now has to shoot enemies 3 or 4 times, at best, to bring them down.
---
Well this isn't the place to do it either. Read sub rules.
---
NW has a number of problems, I understand the appeal to some people but I deal with enough RNG in adventure, didn’t really want to deal with RNG in another format.
---
Use ricochet.  Definitely decreases the damage you take.
---
Ah, thanks for the fact-chek 👍.
---
I agree with your post but if you compare posts now from what was here a year ago you will see a difference. Most of the posts today are related to complaining about the game, most of the posts a year ago were about gameplay and lore.
---
I got a I2525 Fixer last night after my fifth run. Daily Ops is the bees knees. I can keep rolling for legendaries and all I have to do is drop the crap I don’t want.
---
Ah haha :)
---
I’m jealous I always wanted to do shottys. I have a instigating explosive double barrel just waiting for me.
---
I think there are supposed to be a stealth friendly set of Ops coming up that will be more to our advantage. With these it definitely helps to duo and just focus as hard as possible on getting the uplinks going ASAP.
---
Really want the wall decor from last year . Reminds me of Halloween decorations from when I was a kid . Just imports from previous fallouts but I love them !
---
You underestimate what will make players content. “Give ya this and they want more of that. No that was bad give me this instead” I was told to stop complaining and do something about it. Shit has stuck with me for years. So I finally did do something.
---
Take me down to the Mole Miner City / where the moles are miners and they live in their city
---
[PS4] w: serums h: caps
---
How fuckin hard is that? Every trade sub if seen follows the same format.
---
Things to consider:
---
* Raise your health above 20% to 40% or even higher if you need it. Gives you more of a buffer to work with and you're bound to often go down to 30% (when serendipity triggers) and 20% for the rest of the bloodied stuff. At 40%, you're still doing more damage than most other melee builds
---
* Use chems and food for health/END buffs and str/melee damage
---
* Ease up on the direct damage combat perks and slot in some more survivability perks like dodgy (I presume you're not using vats so you don't really need the AP), blocker if you don't have it or other direct damage perks like tenderizer and bloody mess.
---
* Have a vampiric melee weapon with fast attack speed to gain back some health if you're being mobbed and just want to survive
---
https://www.google.com.hk/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gvr103/warning_to_all_people_having_their_vendors_close/
---
^^^^^^^^^^ I couldn’t agree with you more.
---
You're defending a multi-million dollar company with a proven recent track record of lying to its customers and watering down a beloved franchise to make a quick buck. That's why I'm calling you an apologist.
---
Like the first released xbox one’s?
---
Technically, if you can pull of having maxed  legendary special cards and enough of them you could in theory do almost anything.
---
My PS4 pro isn’t a fan of daily ops.
---
I think most of us just really want to love this game. It's really great until you finish the stories. After that, the other content is glaringly worse and it's much easier to see the problems. Most of us are playing 76 because we love the FO franchise so much, and we just really want a good game in the series. It's just kinda heart-hurting to see Bethesda do so much damage to a franchise we love so much
---
Personally I’m being safe because I’ve got rare stuff I don’t want to lose but it’s not a wide spread issue
---
I mean, how much faster will that be? Probably need two lol
---
Also, happy cake day.
---
Uranium Fever has always been the most toxic event for me. People not wanting to share the legendary enemies and just one-shotting them on sight. I am the type that if I play this with others I use weaker weapons that won’t one-shot and I usually call the people over. A lot of these people now just don’t. And I always thought in events you couldn’t do team damage, but recently I’ve been seeing it happen a lot. I think that guy was just being rude really.
---
I say if you want something simple just do a PA build or try to make the best of what you already have and turn on pacifist mode cause higher levels will make your life a living hell if you don't.
---
Yeah...and my post will be in the dumpster, but only because you can’t misspell a downvote.
---
But but but, its internet trendy to hate Bethesda! youtubers told me so! /s
---
Heard if you use a Gatling Plasma to drop the boss you get plasma cores. If this pans out I'm milking this indefinitely.
---
It's character based, so you can do it up to 5 times per day if you have strong enough characters to do so.
---
No one wants to farm low level legendaries, i shouldn't be locked to one side of the map. If you aren't willing to take a step back and rework some cards that aren't working or a gun that youre attached to thats on you. So again I politely show you the door.
---
If you pvp all the extra perks give you a better advantage
---
Uuhhhh.... Companion quest MIGHT give 1 legendary.
---
Daily Ops gives 2, ammo, and tons of chems. Plus grenades, but ehhh
---
Nope, no PA, just a "regular" full health sneak rifle build.  I thought they fixed that PA/SCORE bug in this patch though? (:
---
It seems like a huge oversight that we don't already have things like this. 
---
Bethesda: It's an immersive game.
---
But, every damn turn in the game, there's tons of things that break immersion, whether it's beeping from mobs, an unceasing stream of screen pop-ups, or the lack of actual 'junk' to decorate your post-apocalypse ideal of a dwelling place with, instead being given pristine cartoonish toys and not any kind of actual junk that would legitimately occupy a garage area. I miss that 'Do It Your Shelf' mod from FO4, it wasn't perfect, but at least it gave you this kind of a thing like weapons, book, food, and junk you could fill up those empty shelving units with.
---
There should be a quest that has you go and visit her or an event to repair and defend her radio equipment
---
welcome to Fo76. that's how weapons perform when they're not bugged. a lot of people have magic weapons and don't even know, and keep spouting that the game is 'too easy'.
---
why did you respec anyway? they haven't fixed magic weapons.
---
GET 'EM OUT, BOYS!! HE GOT IT!!
---
Its almost like we're different people.
---
We need a community event to bring her new songs
---
That is some bad luck I have got at least 1 rare each day.
---
8:43 Solo and 5:32 with a full team.
---
Yessssss, I've been saying this for ages.
---
Leader of the pack could be changed to an event that needs to be started through a more lengthy process, then leading to spawning a large dire wolf boss in the forest.
---
Maybe the mire could have some story about somebody having kept a single pet alligator (no gators in west Virginia) in a bunker, that mutated broke free, or is in the bunker. They can just use a larger scaled Gatorclaw from fallout 4s nukaworld.
---
The Ash heap could have a giant blood worm, like from nukaworld.
---
The toxic valley is kind of like a desert, so the giant vulture-like creature (which was the original concept for scorchbeasts) which is already in the game files could work there.
---
One wasteland made it do enemies should scale to your level. If i go to whitesprings at level 15 i should expect level 15ish enemies but if im level 100 i should expect enemies around 75 to 100.
---
Im not sure if the minimum level (before One Wasteland) still applies to regions or not but that shouldn't have affected where i was because before one wasteland the are was between level 15 and 99.
---
I'm lvl 29 only played 76 for about a month or so but very experienced in the other fo games. It can be very difficult at this sort of level I took out around 15 super mutants and about 5 mutant hounds at lvl 29 same as me, got rid of them fairly easily just afew extra rounds than normal but was attacked by a forager ant after the fight and found that so much harder to kill it took around 10-15 shells with my pump action shotgun with 86 DMG, I am definitley beginning to struggle with ammo I had to buy some for the first time ever yesterday. I can normally make enough for a day or two at a time but I went through most of then in a couple hours. Despite this though I still like one wasteland 👍.
---
&gt; I apologize as I'm going to assume this question gets asked a lot. 
---
So much so that if you look just above your post, you'll see something called Guide to Returning. That might help somewhat.
---
Aside from what though, specifically about character, personally I'd start over but don't delete your old character unless you haven't progressed that much with it anyhow.
---
I kind of agree but the side effect of the unyielding criticism is that new players have to break through it all to even consider playing. I’ve heard lots of new players say “I avoided the game for long...I heard it was horrible, then I played it...why TF did I listen to haters? This game is awesome!”
---
Having fun with a primed Railway Rifle in daily ops as a single shot rifle guy, you get so much ammo back on their bodies. Running blocker, serendipity, ricochet, dodgy, bloody-mess, tank-killer, 1\* master, 1\* expert, 1\*  base rifleman, and tenderizer perks.
---
Don’t scrip it... it’s worth a decent amount but not what you’re asking
---
Once again, not defending them. You’re generalizing again. Don’t assume everyone who disagrees with you has to support Bethesda. I can be pissed with their updates and still know you are just looking to complain for no reason.
---
Yeah it can be a real bummer so most find another fallout subreddit.
---
Because it’s the best looking outfit IMO. That’s why I bought the bundle. For the whole set of cosmetics.
---
I've put a ticket in, yes. The Chem Fiend issue has actually been around for a while and I've put in tickets for that many times. No response. We'll see what happens... Thanks for confirming!
---
I got one in my inventory lol
---
Halloween canceled irl and in game not cool !
---
Well the way I read your post the other day, was that they just weren't working at all. And I had used them that very day, and they worked as normal. And sometimes bugs aren't consistent. And sometimes bugs only happen on PCs, because of mods people have. 
---
So today the information gave me a better idea of what you meant, and you also offered a challenge about providing proof. So I investigated. 
---
You are 100% correct.
---
I don't think there's really a way they could "fix" Mischief Night, because the fundamental problem is the Whitesprings itself.  There's just too much *stuff* for the engine to handle there, *and* have this big, explosive event going on.
---
Maybe if they could transplant it to Monongah, or even the frat house area of Morgantown, it would be better.
---
They could also have an ulterior motive for not bringing it back, due to future development at Whitesprings.  If MODUS and the Enclave come back at some point, they probably aren't going to be hosting a Halloween event in their backyard.
---
I hardly die when fighting the queen, but when I do and I respawn inside the nuked area, I use my hand dandy rad-diluted drugs along with radshield and then.... I run like I was being chased by the devil himself. Speed demon helps, too. Oh, and I do all that without ever getting into PA or using rad suits. 🙃
---
I didn't care for the resilient robos that's for sure.
---
I should clarify, the biggest problem is these near mandatory perks come in by the time you've already passed that hellish mid 20 to mid 30 point where the health scaling jumps up massively yet your weapon damage does not. There's this long critical stretch where you're at your absolute weakest, and where people tend to just leave due to the struggle.
---
For example, the big ammo solver (Super Duper) only comes into existence at level 50. Same for even the remote possibility of getting Ammo Factory. This results in this long drought of constant ammo scrounging (worse now due to the now constant level scaled mobs instead of backtracking to a lesser leveled area to get some mats) that never really ends until much much later into the game after hours of play.
---
Bethesda seriously need to revise this health curve ASAP.
---
Another FYI- the only reason to bulk stuff is to sell things that vendors won't buy bulk.
---
Two exceptions: Unless something's changed since I last checked, Aluminum and Lead get lighter when bulked. But nothing else does. So don't waste your plastic on bulking anything else, unless you want to vendor it!
---
Here's hoping they don't cancel Christmas too.
---
Seen a lot of people say "they've read about it." Haven't seen anyone say it actually happened to them.
---
That’s amazing. Y’all seem like true role players.
---
Honestly, fallout isn’t supposed to be COD or some sort of linear speed-run type of game.
---
Hearing that you and group of friends play this way is really awesome! Hopefully I can run into one of you in the wasteland!
---
People laughing at you are just trying to play you and get it cheaper. It is as expensive as any other legacy weapon.
---
is it level 45 or 50? does it have 100-200 range or over 700? assuming it's a 'legit' legacy laser rifle, it's worth a ton.
---
having said that, it's one of the most duped legacies, and people with access to legacy flamers probably already have one. or multiple.
---
Don’t script it! And be sure someone doesn’t low ball you too, it is a legacy yes, however in terms of legacies I’d say it’s closer to the bottom of the list than the top, I may be wrong here but from what I’ve seen the flamers are one of the most sought after and explosive lasers are typically bundled up with other legacies to get a decent explosive flamer
---
You would think having multiple characters would increase my chances for rare drops but the only thing I've gotten consistently (besides nothing) are the damn sign plans. 😭
---
As a person who has bought Fallout 1st, the scrap box changes the game for me. And I imagine it would change the game a lot for anyone playing. Not to mention private servers and public servers have a VERY noticeable difference with lag. I don't agree with charging for a scrap box and probably never will.
---
That posts from over 3 months ago hey?
---
I think that one got patched, but the workaround was to have one item in each vendor for max caps. 
---
They couldnt buy you out, if they couldnt buy everything at once, or something to that effect.
---
I never did pull my vendors down for that one.
---
Had to make the title POP
---
I know. Fallout 76, and Bethesda in general are full of total bullshit. This is why I’m taking a break, playing Fallout 3 atm. What’s strong in the offline games will stay strong no matter what. In 76, I lost 80% of my damage. My build is meta. Before I wouldn’t have to spend more than half a dozen rounds, now I’m spending half a dozen magazines on one enemy. Not fun anymore.
---
It’s worth nothing to people that don’t want it.
---
You have to find a collector without one that has a spare of what you want.  After the last duping round they are probably out there, but it will be tricky.  
---
Legacy weapon market in this game is incredibly weird.  I’d say you’re having a normal experience.
---
What about an invisible 1by 1 meter tile, that acts as a display? You can put things on the floor, counters, pretty much and flat surface.
---
The BE flamer is I think a bit more sought after than a BE laser, but it’s a pretty awesome legacy if its max level.
---
Lucky 🙂
---
All i got was that new generator and a vault suit plan.
---
Well there’s stories about it but I havnt seen videos but it might be for the reason that some people but not realize it because the glitch has a small chance of happening to someone without them even realizing it, and if someone actually does the glitch Bethesda might just ban them
---
a likely story tell it to the judge
---
I have only found a single legendary (a 3* too) outside of events, and it was inside west tek. A level 20 killed it as i switched to a lower damage weapon to ping it. Oh well. It seems like events are better for finding legendary enemies now.
---
Yeah don't use a normal weapon for pvp, gamma gun is the way to go. Had a horrible and completely accidental pvp encounter all because my dumb ass forgot pacifist mode existed. Next time some PA big shot wants to rob me I'm gonna give him the radioactive finger.
---
I didn’t get any plans yesterday but I got a god roll fixer.
---
Yeah I just don’t like it, I did win 4 matches during season 1 but most of the time I can’t do shit in it and get taken out by level 400 team. Like they must only play that.
---
Idk where the post is from right before the new update but people have been saying that it’s back I’m just being safe man
---
Ok but also have you considered its been asked for since the game came out its almost been like 3 years and also ',......,,,,,,::::'''',,,,,,,,,,
---
I just want random clutter packs or the ability to put junk anywhere in my camp. I would love to have my place look lived in.
---
My ammo situation because of ammo factory 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iu77ma/im_pretty_sure_ill_never_need_to_craft_any_ammo/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Correct, bro. However, it doesn’t work like the one in Fallout 4. 
---
There’s also an ammo perk already, but they also added a legendary ammo perk.
---
Yup. Bought pre owned from gamestop like 5 years ago. Never failed me except fallout 4 is unplayable anymore even without mods lol
---
Some people said the same thing about Wastelanders, that it should have been a seoarate game mode.
---
Games change and evolve. Mechanics change and evolve. This isn't exclusive to 76, and the changes aren't that bad. Really.
---
Pfft the theremin stands alone!
---
Oh yea 1.8k to 360
---
melee got hit the hardest. but even my stealth commando is taking 6 shots to kill super mutants whereas I could single tap then before the patch.
---
the only issue is that it would make the game too easy and Beth wants you to play its game at a slow pace and work toward the things you want grind wise.
---
Strange, I've got a 1st gen ps4 and daily ops works fine, thought it would have run better on a pro
---
Nah man, I think it east to understand that I have played the game somewhat frequently over almost two years, but it is obvious I dont fully grasp some things. Example: I've launched zero nukes and haven't finished wastelanders yet.
---
I think you're thinking of the other power armors mods.  Modus sells the plans and mods for XO1 armor in the bunker and the rest of the power armor mods can be bought from the faction vendors in the mall.
---
Ultracite mod plans only come from scorchbeasts, queen just has a better drop rate.
---
I have all six legendary cards and three are ranked to max.  I ranked up Legendary Strength first and will rank up Legendary Charisma and then Legendary Intelligence so I can have all but one SPECIAL ranked to 15.
---
Thx. Trying not to spread how the bug is done, just how to non specifically negate the bug.
---
Thanks for confirming!
---
If I could have a singular pedistal to something beyond stupid like a stick of chalk I would do it in a heartbeat. 
---
Screw the rest of my camp, its chalk meta now.
---
Is that the only thing that you wanted to make POP?
---
I lost my BE90 laser rifle to the one that came up just before the display case dupe glitch was made public. But as far as I know, that is patched.
---
this is also my experience. well over half the people (that I spoke to) that bashed the game in the beginning hadn't even played it. And... the ones that did eventually try it found out that the "game breaking bugs" weren't so game breaking after all. Imagine that.
---
I hate the bitching but love critiques. The tone often isnt one of grown men and women having a perspective with an alternative idea but one of just saying F$#K bethesda and crying. 
---
Bethesda knows 90% of our grievances. There's absolutely no need for the inflammation. 
---
At the same time, I think FO76 mods would be doing us a service if they had a sticky section of the most requested fixes and changes so that we would have to see the same shit posted over and over. I understand why they let the talk ride out as it could seem they are Bethesda's right hand squashing decent but it gets to a point where the community knows the issue and are sick of hearing it.
---
I feel that's the main reason for its existence.  Even then, the Fusion Generator is still going to be a vastly more efficient use of space, but the Super Generator would be thematically appropriate.
---
Oh wow that means a lot considering the guy that thought the next gen console should be made specifically to watch movies. Long story short thats what the first gen consoles were ment for. Also that guy got fired. 😂
---
I got full unyielding in SS armor. Took a lot of rolls. But you can scrip the ones you don’t want.  I wish I had saved some vanguards though with this update.
---
I look exactly the same. Stalker bandana? I also use the stalker goggles.
---
Which backpack is that?
---
Do the feed the people event for the canned meat xp buff
---
I'm not a game developer but my friend is and he is pretty good at understanding this stuff mister smarty pants
---
It's a 90% lightweight, medic combat shotgun with the hardened receiver and piercing magazine.
---
I've had the same effect with non legendary pump and combat shot guns. As far as armor I use the chinese stealth armor.
---
Thanks! Serendipity fully maxed, yes. Just one level of bloddy mess. I think I have the essentials, but i struggle staying alive. I've just been testing, I think it's energy weapons that I struggle with... Ill have to check out some perks. Thanks!
---
I would also like to see a little more added
---
Not op, but I’ve only noticed my pistol alt really struggling, but that’s partly because pistol builds are pretty ass to begin with
---
Oh yeah, one of my favorite things is logging in and out of a game serving hopping. Really gives me that emersive feeling.
---
Doesnt sound like a meta build to me, my commando is using 1 or 2 extra bullets maximum, my shotgunner still rocks in VATS and my heavy gunner hasn't been affected either. My numbers in my pip boy are lower for sure but it's not reflecting in my gameplay.
---
Lucky for OP flights are cheap right now so he wont go totally broke flying to Maryland to suck Todd's dick.
---
No, I am tired of the toxic food builds accusing me of griefing. WHAT IS GRIEFING!!!!!
---
7:01 w team of 3 - Btw, still can’t figure out why they started on Tues with the hardest one of all!
---
This is true. Also I paid for this fucking game. They owe me I don’t owe them.
---
 PSA if you're going to complain about everything posted in r/fo76, maybe find a different subreddit.
---
My friend is landscape gardener, that doesn't mean I know anything about fucking gardening.
---
My companion gives me the weapon quest 90% of the time, which drops anything from a one to three star weapon. Perhaps RND likes me with my companion and not daily ops. ;)

Correct, and this is the main thing that screws with a lot of the melee weapons right now.  Melee damage is buffed by Strength, and because there's kind of an expectation that you'll have STR if you do melee, the actual base damage numbers of the melee weapons are surprisingly low.  And yet, that's what it's basing all the math off of.
---
Where’s the N-word? This isn’t what I bought!
---
Actually, no. According to her imdb page, Grace Rolek is Julie. Note, she turns 23 next month.

Explosive shotgun, cripple legs, don't kill ghouls and only focus on keeping one scavenger alive. It can be done solo, just not with the best rewards. Though it's likely harder to do now that there's level scaling.
---
agreed, except  the last one...with daily ops, i have quadrupled my fuel, and with survival shortcut, water/food/disease cure are no longer an issue.
---
If your on ps4 I may know someone who has a flamer
---
I always forget to swap them back. Every single time. Perk load outs can’t come fast enough for me.
---
I'm using the secret service  backpack with the jetpack
---
I can understand that I guess I wouldn't mind no currency increase but I would atleast enjoy camp budget
---
Serious question. Did you expect to be able to max all cards on day 1?
---
Smart plan! I live by a junkies Gauss shotgun so corpses in Daily Ops has 2mm rounds on them.
---
Also thanks for not going crazy
---
I guess this is where we tag /u/ladydevann and /u/valseek for comment.
---
It’s a chance reward for the Encryptid event, which unfortunately I haven’t seen happen in weeks.
---
I am the judge.
---
I have faught one lvl 100 deathclaw and one yao guai since the update. The deathclaw killed me, and was a drawn out fight. The yao guai fell in four hits. 
---
I haven't faught a mirelurk king or queen yet, looking forward to getting decimated.
---
lvl 20-30 is not very long or very critical.. where are you getting that info from?
---
I don’t trust people enough for that
---
I’m switching to anti armor from junkies.
---
Encryptid event gives you a small chance of winning them, otherwise you have to buy from another player.
---
Yes I’m on ps4
---
Nope. I had 2 incompetent people with me last night using melee weapons. I was on my medic with a vampires handmade. No one had Tesla in burrows either on first day. I get to the final wave and it locks up and blue screens every single time. When you log back in you will be dead and can’t respawn so you have to log out again just to play. It’s maddening.
---
Why they dont compensate? Why people downvote everytime I talk shit about glitch? Even my fucking mobile game compensate for bugs. Just give me a free respec. Give me atoms for the bugged lunchboxes. Give compensation Bethesda!! Is it so hard to fucking piece of mother fucking reward LEGIT PLAYERS FOR ONCE"""!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
You do not need to un-bulk your scrap materials for them to be used during crafting, repairing and building. The system will un-bulk as needed automatically, using loose scrap first.
---
Again, again, again, you morons aren't getting the impact on the majority of new and developing players. You're so fucking selfish you don't raise this will kill the game if Bethesda blocks new players from advancing. Galaxy brain stuff here.
---
Damn I remember that event too, I died a lot. Oh well thank you!
---
Happened to me just now and i was doing it solo...
---
You’re welcome.
---
Looks like buying is my way to go then cause I hated that event haha
---
It’s level 50 with 104 range. I used it for a while and it shreds but I’m not a commando build I’m a heavy gunner.
---
I've been trying to file a ticket with Bethesda to fix a melee weapon issue, and their bug reporting system is really, really bad. You can only pick the type of bug from a list of 3 or 4 and there's no choice for "Other". So you pick something which isn't your bug, just to get to the point  where you can describe it and submit. Then you get the first layer of support who asks you to unplug all of your peripherals, reset your router, reset your ISP's peripherals, etc. And then you get the second layer of support who ask you to film a video from before and after you did all of the stuff the first layer asked you to do, upload it to youtube, and submit that. My presumption is that the next layer is going to tell me that this is a known issue with no workaround.
---
Alright I'll let you know if I find a flamer, feel free to add me psn: XxzgrimCYBORGzxX
---
Thanks for the tips. I think some of those I can implement, specially the vampiric
---
Yeah like give us a new map at least
---
What was even wrong with it?
---
I think its timing is about a half measure behind.
---
I feel you OP. Apparently a lot of people need to argue the opposite of anything. If you would have made a post complaining about everything, these same people would have hopped on this post and argued it.
---
Do not scrip it. But it is not worth a legacy flamer, both are very valuable. The laser just less so
---
BE pump action for me... sooo damn happy especially as I have an explosive shotty build
---
Only change I’ve made to my bloodied unarmed was swapping out max martial artist for max incisor.    
---
Armor penetrating helping out a bit more this time around.  
---
This build took the biggest damage hit that I have but I’m playing just like I did pre patch. 
---
Power attacks are usually 1 hit kills, other then that 2-3 swipes.  No biggie for me.
---
That's... that's you players. You guys are exulting over a broken game and not letting anyone else play it.
---
This is as close to r/selfawarewolves as I can imagine.
---
Really enlighten me, go into depth and explain, HOW this will kill and deter newer players, because the way I see it, I’ve seen more newer players than ever before, so please tell us oh mighty one, why you think this way?
---
Same shit happens to me man
---
Dont worry, I did. Played it for about 30 mins and gave it away. I'm still in shock people actually play fo76
---
Ok well that doesn't seem like the best job for them you should help them get a better job and it might help you lighten up :)
---
This is an issue for PC players. 
---
I guess everyone just has to eat up their budget to add their discord username in their camp...
---
Yeah, the bow ones were added with Wastelanders. I’m considering making an alt a ‘stealth archer’. 
---
Either that or just start playing Skyrim again. I *always* end up as a Stealth Archer.
---
Hmm so what do you think I can trade the laser for? I’m willing to trade my way up to the flamer but it seems like everyone wants fixers or handmades
---
Why I respecced? Because I wanted to do automatic rifles instead of shotgun, thinking it would make mobbing easier. But then after having MORE armor pen and better weapon, more crit etc, I couldnt even kill a mob after 30 bullets, I wanted to respec back to shotguns but I stick with it because I didnt want to waste another 15 perk swaps. And here is why, because bethesda's bug would have costed me 30 swaps. I should just go melee and be done with it. No bullets, just go tank which is meta anyway and tahts it. but no, I just had to grass is greener on the other side and go fking stealth.
---
Take their food away, that’ll teach em !!
---
What the heck were you running? I still kill super mutants in 2-3 bullets with my junkies commando
---
They said they're discussing. If they're discussing this close to Halloween, then either nothing is going to happen or what will happen will be a very rushed attempt at putting out anything for the sake of saying they did.
---
I'm imagining something along the lines of Halloween scorched or ghouls, in a couple variations of outfits, dropping different variations of candy buckets. Rewards being maybe the same as last year with a few new additions.
---
If you're going to complain about peoples complaints, maybe you should find a different hobby.
---
Yup it’s max level.
---
the acid problem is pretty fixable if you go over to the trainyard by watoga and kill all the snallygasters there that are a gaurenteed spawn there and server hop till you have around 200-300 acid and should be able to smelt down all the ores in no time. ive done this multiple times and got up to 3,000 lead out of 2 lucky hole runs and 10 snally runs.
---
I don't see why not!
---
Other perks are also about not playing aspects of the game: 
---
Don't want to play the survival mechanic? Survival Shortcut! 
---
Don't want to unlock or hack things ever again? Master Infiltrator! 
---
Radiation just too annoying? What Rads!
---
its gone. its sold. It was a shitty shotgun, I didnt even want shotgun. I have to swap perks, the shotgun perks are scrapped too.  Everything ruined.
---
Funky duds is your friend.
---
15:12 solo (stealth build). Piercing Gaze is a real kick in the head, but Marsupial saved the day.
---
For me, after the first death in a play session, it happened EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
---
I'm SO HAPPY they fixed this, they claim there's still cases where it can happen - but for me I've not had it happen once since patch 22 so I'm no longer terrified of dying, lol.
---
Uh it came out in 2018
---
Considering there's free fast travel to crater and foundation, expect more traffic around those locations, particularly foundation because it's a nice area to build and people go there to cash in their treasury notes each day because no load screen.
---
"We are discussing having another event"
---
They are talking about having another event...a month before it would actually occur.  That's not an indication that we are getting jack shit.  It's literally just a *discussion.*
---
As for the "Bombs Drop" event, there's been no official description of it whatsoever.
---
&gt;Funny how you mention that, but conveniently ignore
---
Oh piss off.
---
Uh... have you been reading the critiques, or has your head been up your ass these last few days?
---
Its 2020 btw i dunno if you knew
---
Same. All the instanced stuff runs great on my original Xbox one
---
JuiceHead and AngryTurtle on YouTube have some very good videos that demonstrate that the ‘nerf’ is a lot less impactful than many people assume. They also have good videos with tips on leveling (mainly AngryTurtle).
---
then it's legit. just saw that you're on PS4. don't let anyone tell you it's worthless, specially on consoles.
---
you could probably get a flamer for it, yes. problem is finding someone willing to do that trade.
---
Lol no but 2 out of 26 seems a little tight with over 2000 hours in the game even with my other characters at lvl 250, 200 and 50. I would only get a couple more and they would all be using different cards anyway the main issue is I now don't have the incentive to play with the other characters when the grind is this long.
---
Totally agree. I’m lvl 210 and was close to putting it away for a while out of boredom.  This totally reenergized me. Focusing on end-game/higher levels totally makes sense and they finally did it!
---
Same build but with a Bloodied one, works great no problem at all. Got a Quad non legacy Harpoon, also great still after the patch
---
My biggest issue with this game is the private servers. With that said, I don’t usually use a private server when I play personally but, I do have friends that that is all they play on for one reason or another and I’ve not been able to join their private server. I pay for fallout 1st (for now) and my friends are obviously on my friends list. If I’m going to pay for a premium service, all aspects of it need to function properly. I don’t want to have to go through this ridiculous process just to be able to join my friends on their private server. Outside of that, game’s great.
---
The event gets easier as you do it more. I haven't died in my last dozen times and all my characters are level 70 and under.
---
I think that is what most people did.
---
They are randomized but yes there are 4? Possible locations.
---
The event is on the road map, my dude. We know the dates it's happening.
---
It’s not a random event. It is player-generated. There are steps you have to take to get it to start. If no one does that, it will not pop on it’s own.
---
I have but I still don’t see your point, that’s why I’m asking you to ELABORATE, also things isn’t going more well for you the more you just curse and name call, but please do go ahead and make a fool of yourself, but I still stand to hear your reasoning, if you do not give it then it seems I’m right
---
I got your "Anything Goes" reference.
---
That would be awesome, but there are so many smaller things that I'd like to see done first. Like automatically equipping your most powerful grenade after you throw one, nerfing frog legs a bit, fixing the Gauss shotgun bug that bypasses fire rate restrictions, giving us statistics after games, fixing the power armor spawns, and more
---
Well, I'm a professional illustrator. And one thing I believe in, is that limitations spur creativity. And that makes things really fun for me. I know some players aren't into that. Though I think maybe if they tried it a little and worked it into their game, they might have more fun. 
---
So i'm always looking for ways to do things differently, try different approaches that pushes it. Because the one that that kills a game for me, is always doing the same things over and over the same way. I play ESO, and it's kind of like that. So I play that game in spurts. 
---
I also love nonverbal visual storytelling. And the Fallout games has that in spades. Along with dark humor. Like coming across the two crashed golf carts at Whitespring, and realizing, the two were jousting. Did it happen when the bombs dropped? Did it happen after? Why were they jousting.
---
There's all this stuff about sickleman. Someone spent time searching for clues about it and wrote up a whole post. 
---
So not sure how much is roleplaying as just not expecting a limited computer game to do all the work. 
---
But thank you also!
---
Flamers are more rare. So while that gun might not be worth a legacy flamer it's without question worth any non legacy in trade and also should trade for any other legacy rifle.
---
Also there very well may be someone out there with a bunch of flamers willing tti trade but that's unlikely as that guy already has whatever her wants.
---
I posted on another, will you share it?
---
It’s up to you, 60 hours isn’t a ton for this game. I’ve run multiple characters. Sometimes it’s nice to start fresh, especially with new wastelanders stuff
---
Get yourself a full set of Troubleshooter's armor - makes the whole thing a lot more bearable. The drop chance for the plan is 10%, provided you have finished the Lying Lowe quest.
---
I've had a positive experience from doing these daily ops.   
---
I usually get multiple 3-star legendary weapons at the end, and 2/3 days I've earned one of the rare plans. I also get a huge refill of ammo. I haven't had to craft ammo at all, I use the daily to farm it.
---
Sorry as it sounds like bad you've definitely got a cursed RNG.
---
That’s the problem I been having, I posted it in a ton of trade groups but got no offers.
---
Why not both?
---
It's true though... I broke 4pieces of armor this week after not breaking one for months ... White Knight is inbound..
---
I’ll message it to you. The Mods here are very... particular if we mention any other subs. Even when it would help guide people to what they need which would keep this sub more organized.
---
Deathclaw? I sleep. Yoiu Gui? Oh shit kill it kill it kill it@!@!!!! 
---
I'd kill for the ability to have the minigun start spoiling up when I ads. Just saying.
---
That's how it was in the beginning of the first one, wouldn't surprise me if it magically appeared midway and force the not so dedicated players to use atoms.
---
this is the way
---
That’s odd. If he is wanted you should be able to kill automatically
---
THANK YOU!  I’m getting tired of this bullshit too
---
The comments are salty people but the gilds tell a diffrent story
---
Not a bad day of challenges for a Friday. Thinking I will knock these out then do a CP run.
---
Patch 23 is on the roadmap, but as far as I know that doesn't have anything to do with One Wasteland, especially an unnecessary "fix" (One Wasteland is working as it should be).
---
Maybe they ahould make a game thats up to today’s standards? Take the dick out your mouth for a second
---
Thx
---
All these guys saying the game is 2 hard, heres something from a Soulsborne player. Git Gud.
---
It came out in October 2018. There is even a 2 year release anniversary coming up. It's still not 3 years though is it?!
---
Bullion is fine where it is, it forces you to spend or lose out on daily turn ins. Scrip honestly should be a tad higher maybe 2k. Caps I just do not see a reason to raise it really, all the good stuff is trade only. Caps are their for the weekly gold bullion and running encrypted. If there were 4-5 more cap sinks maybe I could see a reason to raise it to 50K? maybe.    
---
As for camp budget that is coming in a couple of months. No one knows aside from bethesda (maybe) how the interior cell will work but I do expect to have 8 times the current budget with ease after seeing interior cells we have now.  The question is what it will look like form the outside. Will there be a magic door? Do you have both an exterior world cell along with a interior cell?  I expect more news and info on it next month since I am sure it will need PTS testing along with steel dawn/fractured steel.
---
Thx for the heads up. I will see if I can fix that issue. I swear there was a build when I copped the link.
---
Nice bait
---
Make it ten feet tall
---
Yeah, something similar happens to me (PS4). When I enter a new world, and rank up in a new level (for example, level 10), the S.C.O.R.E bar goes from 1 to 10, and it gives me the message that I have the level 1 reward, level 2 reward, etc
---
Huh interesting
---
If your a bloodied build and have a full set of Unyielding you are wasting points on that sneak card in the first place.
---
Get on their heads bru😹
---
What would the clown outfit do?
---
Really? I think they are a ton of fun and you end up with a lot of extra ammo at the end.
---
Lol no.
---
Honestly don't think they like making money.
---
No clean display cases (except thanksgiving cupboard, which is very different).
---
No clean weapon displays (coming soon, but my gosh Bethesda. How long do you wanna take)
---
Fwiw; if you dont read the after action report, you have about 5 minutes to run around and loot the bodies you might have missed. Than after looting, read the report to exit.
---
Im up over 4k extra .45 shells and atleast 150 stims, with 3 days worth of daily ops. All while still doing all my dailys and a sbq event 2 of the 3 days.
---
Last night I did one round with the hunting rifle, just to stock up on .308. Started with 150, walked away with close to 600.
---
Lotsa scrip, including a 3 star unyielding SS left leg and bloodied tenderizer too.
---
Got a few new plans, my RNG stinks most days. But I got the BoS secret service outfit last night and its pretty epic.
---
Cool, now I know you're a jackass and not worth engaging with any more.
---
Amen to that.
---
I take Bethesda "discussing" it so close to the time frame akin to a parent saying "I'll think about it...". Ain't holding my breath.
---
I would hate it. That would mean I would need to use a spesific outfit that fits my build to get the most out of it.
---
That... doesn't make it unplayable, and saying it's not unplayable is not the same as being okay with the problem; it just means I'm not loading it with hyperbole
---
Not bait?? I’m fairly new to playing sooo
---
I could share my build. I want to be very clear in saying I have no problem killing enemies on either of my 2 mains. That isn’t the problem. The ppl saying “oh wahh it took you four seconds instead of two to kill that one enemy” are being short sighted.
---
 “work on your build” ppl don’t seem to understand the biggest problem is burning resources way quicker and needing way more resources to maintain everything. I use 2x maybe 3x the ammo, everything degrades quicker. My camp is getting broken way more often. This update doesn’t make everything harder, it makes everything less fun and way more expensive. I like to play events and explore, not spend all my time repairing things or getting mats to repair things.
---
Also, for low to mid level players it is way more brutal. You probably won’t admit it, but I know you wouldn’t want to start your optimized build from scratch with no access to gear and resources from your mains.
---
Ah yeah ended up scrolling thru the comments and was reading that. But like... Why not just... Take out the exploding cars and have something else? Is the code so dependent on it for the event?? Oh wait, aren't those cars static spawns in whitesprings, outside of the event anyway? Hmm
---
I tried the encryptid event several times, but never got them. Ended up buying them from another player for 5000 caps. I think that must be a deal, because I usually see them for sale for around 10000 to 12000 caps.
---
It most certainly does.
---
That looks neat! I believe I got the Brotherhood Special Ops mask? It looks interesting lol
---
I agree, and I also think with the addition of free fast travel to both locations, more vendor camps are going to start showing up near both.
---
You may have tried this but if you didn't know you can go into 3rd person then zoom the camera all the way out and this greatly increases the range that you can interact with objects
---
They are awsome. I get about 700-1000 2mm rounds per op and a legendary, xp, stims, scrip. I love the
---
Not necessary anymore with OW boosted xp at least. I was leveling in uranium fever acceptably
---
Is this from Daily Ops?
---
I think just on principle of being a clown outfit it should do something amazing just to force people to wear it. I say more AP regen while on a team. Cause like a clown entertains people so like the energy would come from the performance or something like that.
---
Exactly
---
Yes Pal 👍
---
So, you're lazy and dumb and just don't care about the health of the game. Seems you have a lot of idiotic company. Got it.
---
Even though I just posted about Julie the radio host needing to comment on in game events and say her heart felt speech less, I mostly agree with this post.
---
This is actually sound advice. All of the ops are easily workable with a bit of gear and/or aid items but it seems a lot of people would rather refuse to budge on their setup and moan.
---
Thanks. Looking forward to getting it. Someone said something about a hood?
---
I got the mask the other day, hopefully I can get lucky and get that suit to go with it.
---
Honestly I’ve just gotten used to it. And everyone else should too
---
Oh yeah you're right, well thats what I would mean by like really minuscule bonuses. Like they exists but not to the point where they would be equivalent to a perk.
---
I'm only saying this because I wish the moth man hunter outfit would give me a better chance of finding one.
---
Define pay to win please.  
---
I want to know.
---
Sounds like you have a build problem, have a check you have the right damage perks my commando still kills most things in 2 or 3 shots
---
And to make you feel better my full health non junky shotgunner is still 1 shotting most things
---
It's really noticeable with melee recently.  It's also hard to wait to see of the hit registers as a melee character. Odds are the enemy is attacking me.
---
I mainly just mark it so items I find let me know immediately what has lead in it. Then I explore and it just adds up. Lucky hole mine has a lot of lead deposits, certain workshops provide extraction points for lead which is an easy way to accumulate it. When I do manhunt, I always search the dam as it has toys and usually combo wrenches in cabinets. Whitesprings actually has a lot of different areas with lead, like the main building people farm, which has toys, and a shack with a stack of pencils. Toys are also in the actual toystore in the whitesprings. But my main advice would be to set up at workshops and start extracting it, as well as mark it so items you look it will notify you that it's an item with lead. Usually exploring areas gets me all the lead I need. Just gotta be thorough.
---
This is an aspect of 1WL that I didn't expect to happen. How some much stuff, for a lot of players have new value. I used to just sell magazines, and I figured most bought them to complete challenges. 
---
I seldom needed an extra boost. Now I want those boosts. 
---
Now I go out look for magazines and bobbleheads.
---
I have a few camp design ideas for it but I personally won't be using it until I get the BoS prefab and have a cranberry bog trench warfare camp motiff. The absolute most shitty thing about it is that you can not snap floors to it. It is also an oddball size since it is a 6x6 instead of a 4x4 like a normal flooring piece. That makes it a tad harder to work with.
---
I ran it yesterday a few times after getting the ‘Fingertrap’ bonus from a lunchbox. That helped a bit.
---
Yo we can tell people they're wrong and think the game is good and not because we're worshiping todd.
---
i love you, thank you for posting this. i gave up a long time ago trying to spread the word of positivity in this reddit via numerous comments. at least your post is gaining traction, and I plan on upvoting everything positive in here to keep it hot boi
---
Well if the devs are too lazy to care for this event, I'm curious what sort of watered-down halloween shit we'll end up getting :/
---
I was doing 1460 in stealth, per shot. Now I’m doing less than 300, in stealth, with headshots. That’s not a nerf. That’s a “we wanted to invalidate your play style” and considering I liked my play style, I did go somewhere else. I played for two days, chewed through 2600+ rounds per day (bloodied fixer, just a one star) on both days. And decided I didn’t wanna farm daily for ammo. I liked my lazy play style. I didn’t go to events and “steal legendaries” I went to private to do boss runs, and I one shot everything on the map and had fun doing it. I understand that not everyone’s was hit as hard. But I was. As were a few people I played with daily. To the point that they quit as well. 
---
My bigger issue, is this. I can run 3 commando perk cards at rank 3, for 20 more damage. 20. More. Damage. That’s a slap in the face. I can bloody up for 30 more damage. Hell, I’m 80 percent as effective at full health, with out stealth, as I was at 15 percent health, in stealth. It isn’t a nerf in the damage sense (I mean it is literally) but it’s playskool mode now. 
---
Builds don’t matter. Legendary effects don’t matter. I can craft a handmade that does almost the exact same damage as my bloodied one. Same for junkies. Same for mutants. Or berserkers. Like, why can I craft a weapon that does almost the exact same damage? Why bother finding legendary weapons then? 
---
And since the real end game was build optimization and continued growth of your build, that’s out the window now. That’s why I quit.
---
So you decided to make a post about not wanting to get attacked while attacking people with different opinions than you?
---
Ner they would have to prevent that some how like you have to be level 50 before you can scrap them
---
That’s a real steal
---
I'm sad too, friend. I like Mischief Night even more than Fasnacht and I really like Fasnacht. Meat week....meh.
---
Bloodied commando. So in theory I should be doing more damage than you. It’s still taking me a hell of a lot of effort to put down a basic mob, especially compared to pre nerf. Patch 5, MkII.
---
I was kidding lol
---
I think for lower levels you have a bullshit view about an extra 2 seconds and few more bullets to kill an enemy. 
---
It takes a lot more than a few bullets and 2 seconds just for one enemy. Plus a lot more stimpaks. 
---
And that is truly annoying when going on a resupply mission for lead and Chems to build ammo so we can go on quests. 
---
We’re wasting a lot of ammo, to get material to build ammo, to do actual in game stuff.
---
Everything else, yeah, I agree.
---
"If no one spoke up about the things they'd love to see in a game they love, it would die."
---
Challenge accepted.
---
I love this game but damn right I'm gonna talk about shit that needs fixing or just about stuff I generally want in the game.
---
yes that is exactly what happened.
---
Interesting choice of words, but far from the truth, if you’re REALLY thinking of the health of the game, then the long time players outweigh the newer players in majority, plus the game has receiver better reviews due to its successes as people have formed their own opinions, and also people who may be new to the game, but still play mmorpg for a game type will still like it, if nobody ends up playing it oh well, if they end up enjoying it and wanting to grow in the game then we welcome it, it’s not that we don’t welcome new players at all, and if anything higher levels aren’t selfish as most flat out help out lower levels, like I’ve done to a few of my friends, we help them learn the mechanics, fallout 76 is different from other fallout game as it builds on team building, knowing the mechanics and basic ins and outs, If you don’t choose to sit your flat ass down and think for a sec then I think your mentally ill bruh
---
Encrypted
---
Ok I completely agree with you like 100%  and also thanks for the update in interior  camps and thanks for not being an ass
---
I do mark it for the search, but thanks about lucky hole, and I usually don’t gravitate towards workshops. I knew about pencils and toys, but I didn’t realize there was a shack with a stack of pencils, thank you!

You realize that people aren't a single entity that complain about everything and rather different people complain about different things, right? There are common complaints too ofc but all of this is feedback. I made a I like this game thread a month ago or something but now I dislike the way scaling made mobs bullet sponges. We talk about both.
---
What system are you on?
---
I love fallout games, have spent so many hours on the first player versions. For whatever reason the online version doesn't work for me. I haven't played in long enough that I can recall specific gripes beyond running out of bullets and it taking forever to kill things...  I just know I played through New Vegas and Fallout 4 entirely for a metric ton of hours... and Fallout76 couldn't hang on to me. And all I want to do is play Fallout in a sandbox. 
---
A big part of the problem is likely that I suck at games. But that never was a problem in single player.
---
Me, I'm back to getting my but kicked every 5 minutes. But I figure if it wasn't challenging it would get boring. Frustrating at times, yes, but not boring.
---
Well we are getting a bunch of other stuff. Bombs drop could be fun. We don’t really know anything about it
---
If you're on Xbox I can give you one.
---
It's been weird for me, I haven't noticed much delay in damage, maybe because I use a commando build, but have sometimes seen a 1-2 second delay trying to put stuff in my stash. Seems like servers are just overloaded
---
I started playing in mid January. Therefore, I missed Halloween and was very much looking forward to it. Now my favorite holiday is cancelled. I'm rather disappointed. Fallout without Halloween??? Lame! I want my Halloween!
---
I dont have build problems. I have 100% crit modifier with the starlight berries, and I have 95% chance on headshot while stealth and press crit, yet they keep healing, my stealth goes out, even if I sit still and not doing shit and mobs not around, I am in danger, with chinese stealth armor. I have ranked up the stealth perk card legendary sneak effect, I have everything. Game is so fucking broken I cant do this anymore. This is discusting, that you even DARE to blame players BUILDS in this shitty fucking game. How? You even play this?
---
Ok yea maybe im not specifically talking to you but there are alot of ass hats in here like what I just explained
---
Damm,  everyone went in on this guy lol. You deserve it though,  having an attitude like this is why bethesda half asses everything in this game.
---
There's an exploit to stack strength on the weight bench,  whay does bethesda do? They disable that shit asap,  but god forbid they don't fix bugs annoying tf out of the player base for months.
---
Sorry but you brought this on yourself,  Get todds pp out your mouth.
---
Isnt it still considered to be in beta? Not on to look at game mode icon to see if it still says beta.
---
Well i didn't mean it in a attacking manner just wanted to point out the obvious
---
Well I never said it was random just that it was an event.  Take it easy
---
To me the daily ops is a cheap filler dlc that belongs in call of duty instead of fallout....run around in a circle shoot as much as you can in under 8 minutes... groundbreaking gameplay there... Between the nerf and the daily ops crap Bethesda is really giving the solo players the shaft....
---
Correct.
---
You had to ruin it didn’t you. I was reading all those and was gonna finish it with GAYLORD. Thanks bucko
---
Really, the barrel on my minigun was barely moving.
---
That could have something to do with it. I've been noticing about a second-two second delay on my initial shot (especially in VATS) but nothing after that.
---
Didn't this happen before or is it a different glitch?
---
Something doesn’t sound right..
---
Well, I've played this game for almost exactly 2 months.  That's it.  And I'm level 141.  I'm also a pc player with 15 years of WoW experience, so MMO's are nothing new to me.  I don't one shot everything, but I have a decent build that allows me to do incredible damage while having ridiculous durability, and all at 20% health.  And I don't only use combat talents.  I constantly swap perks around based on my current activity, including non-combat perks.  Perks are literally how your ebntire character works so yeah, build is important.  76 is actually the LEAST grindy MMO I've played.  You don't know what a grind is until you've played a Korean MMO.  Fallout 76 is easy as hell.  And I never complained about anything other than all the whining happening on this subreddit.
---
I do agree some mobs should be easier to kill just by nature of what they are;  low rank scorched, ghouls, mole rats, etc.  But adding some challenge to the game isn't a bad thing.  And making you use a small amount of extra ammo isn't ruining the game.  If your build isn't working as well anymore....find a new build!  That is the nature of a constantly evolving online game.  Build are supposed to shift. You learn what works and adapt.  That's what makes a good gamer.
---
Should Dark Souls lower it's difficulty to be more accessible to people who don't want to try?
---
And also, I'm not talking about any of the other changes that messed with CAMP stuff and neither is anyone else.  This discussion is about the difficulty of the game after the damage change and enemy scaling tech was added.  Obviously bugs and things that don't work correctly need to be fixed.
---
I switch to commando/heavy gunner lol it was nice while it lasted
---
Ight I guess I'll switch to eso hahaha
---
My bad, chief.
---
I had three replica of grognak axe plans, I've set one aside for you if you still need it
---
I changed my sneak unarmed to a high AP power armor heavy build because going from 2k damage to 350 for melee is just insane. My heavy guns are doing more damage in one shot than my unarmed weapons are in one hit. Doesn't really make sense
---
Why is this the 15th time this post was made just tad different each time today? Are ppl farming likes for some reason? I have my feed to new posts and not hot topics and I swear every time I see one post get over a hundred or more likes then ten to twenty posts that say the same shit gets posted.
---
But hey don’t take my word for it, just watch and wait for a few months and really decide for yourself if the game died, grew, or stayed the same? Because arguing is pointless at this point and all we can do is wait to see if your little claim holds any merit
---
Yeah. I figured the bug was known on bethesda’s part but maybe not widely on the player side.
---
Regs loved that.
---
Sorry, I was at your camp and I needed a wash up.
---
Yeah I've found that doing 3 or 4 daily ops will level up my high level character. So I can level it in about 30 minutes and knock out one or two other dailies at the same time.
---
You’re posting on a subreddit, where other people have opinions as well. They can upvote, downvote, Insult you, or agree with you. All depends on the person tbh. 
---
This is the internet. Anything goes. I made a post about how I was giving away a 3 star handmade because I didn’t need or want it. And instead I got attacked for making a typo.   
---
This comment itself. Next time I check it could have -7 downvotes. Or upvotes. It’s random.
---
I was just downvoted for saying that Encryptid is an event lolll
---
Nice.will do
---
Gimme gimme gimme gimme
---
I am easy. I was simply adding in what I hoped might be some useful and relevant information. 
---
There was no rancor in my words.
---
&gt; i read posts from 20-30 levels that are struggling
---
I started a new character with the update. I'm running a stealth build with a hunting rifle modded with a .50 receiver. I'm one-shotting most of the forest at level 20+ and most of the enemies that don't die to the first hit are dying to the second. A couple enemies like rad rats appear to take entirely too much damage to kill so I avoid them rather than waste my ammunition.
---
Concerning perks I'm running almost entirely weight reduction and quality of life. I don't have a single bonus damage perk. I do have the sneak perks. Aside from using the .50 receiver to reduce ammo requirements I'm only using Scrounger as an additional source of ammo. I'm collecting more gunpowder and lead than I'm burning on ammo crafting.
---
Would have been nice if they had made it 200 power to make the size a bit more palatable, though I can't imagine ever needing that much power, but still.
---
I thought the complaint was "Wah, they have all these daily limits and timers so no one plays more than an hour every day!"
---
Get your story straight.
---
No player vendors selling it for 500 or less? If you are on PC I think I have some if you wanted to test it out yourself.
---
Usually do need ..think I need to start stacking ex buffs I never sleep at my camp etc.ill start doing this
---
ill give you 10k caps for it if u can reserve it for me! will be on in 30 mins
---
8:08 solo really mad about the spawns otherwise I'd have shaved 30 seconds off that easy. Boss got stuck on a chair.
---
Quad/33/fr double barrel vats only 🤙 2 shot everything except the boss.
---
There is a difference between Complaining and giving feedback.
---
They used to be a no brainer but now other damage related perks are a little more competitive if you're having to make a choice, especially if you're already stacking multiple buffs.
---
Some examples: Quick hands is still not great since it's only an 18% chance. But scattershot for shotguns is really important for their sustained dps. So is taking starched genes for the speed demon mutation's reload speed bonus. If you're a commando this is a must, worth sacrificing a 10% additive damage bonus if you have to even if you're not a low health running adrenal reaction.
---
Also if you want to double specialize into weapons like commando and rifleman simultaneously, where it's impossible to max all of the damage perks, you're penalized less now for doing so. This might not be a bad build now, an instigating gauss rifle on a stealth rifleman kills most things in one shot and has great ammo efficiency, while an auto fixer or handmade has good boss dps.
---
Grumpy Smurf:  I hate PSA's.
---
I did that in my camp and it looks nice. Presents are useful for it and plants
---
Vats is broken, mob health rubber bands, enemies take 3 seconds to decide if they were killed, vats targets the already dead mob.....  The damage balance kinda killed the role playing for me (I am a believer in leveled areas not leveled players) but I think I could get past it if the game worked.   My build would still be completely viable if it weren't for the fact that I can't target the right enemies and they take too long to decide if they die.  Quit adding stuff and fix the damn bugs.  I'm tired of Fanboys talking about how perfect this game is it's not it's got major problems and it's not going to get better if we just suck bethesda's dick all day.  There were changes recently that made a lot of things better but they neglected some glaring glitches that have now been compounded and make many builds unusable.
---
It's funny.. I would have said the casual players are the ones who won't care about those, because it's one of those non-combat minigames.
---
I agree with you though. Extremely convenient. I'm ditching food, drink (gives me back 3 agility perk points, bunch of weight) most of my radx/radaway (more weight savings).  Am commando cuz everyone is.. so extra ammo is always welcome.
---
Again, I have to ask.. How in the world can you say people having build problems when game is in a state like this? How? How .. I am out of words. Build problem,?? When LIMB DAMAGE that doesnt even damage limbs but cripple them, and BASH DAMAGE is the way to get your bullet dadmage 50 timnes higher? If you oneshot anything in this game with a full health build and a shotgun, your shotgun is bugged and you are in the EXACT same spot as I was.
---
I cant even oneshot a level 50 creature in the starter zone, with full rifle / bow cards, AND legendary perk and crit modifier AND sneak modifier. And you just randomly full tank shoot a "random" shotgun and oneshot, and you blame player builds? You are using a glitch weapon. Or you are lying about the oneshot.
---
these things take a while. tried the market sub and their discord, right?
---
whatever you do, just don't scrip it.
---
The problem here is that complaining and feedback are not the same thing. For feedback to be useful, it has to be constructive. Which doesn't mean flattering either.
---
Constructive Criticism helps. Complaining doesn't. Because complaints only focus on the persons emotional reaction to something. 
---
Once on the forums for the test server, this was the "feedback" a person gave. I hate the artwork for season 2, and I won't be playing it."
---
What the heck is anyone going to be able to do with that? its too late to change the artwork. We have no idea what changes to the artwork they would need to like it. 
---
As a professional artist, I've learned how to pull information out of a client. because through experience, the whole. I don't know what I want, but I'll know it when I see it.
---
Does not work. I could give you 100 different options to choose from, and none of the could be what that person wants. 
---
And no company has the time to run around asking everyone that expresses a negative view what exactly they mean. It's not humanly possible.
---
So if someone wants to complain. They need to do themselves a favor and do more than just complain. If they want to be taken serious, don't rage post and call names because you didn't get a chance to loot a mob. 
---
If everyone is entitled to give their feedback, that means I'm entitled to give my feedback about their feedback. If you don't like that, maybe you should take your own advice? There's my feedback.
---
If this game was a hoe you would send it back to the pimp and then shoot the pimp for giving you this VD infested ,ugly ,stuttering ,botched surgery hoe.
---
Unless ou like them like that
---
Yea i know but its just annoying like when i tried to report a bug and people are like no it didn't happen not real didnt have it so it dont exist. But also thanks for being nice
---
I've held onto a freaking Nocturnal Flaming Pitchfork for all this time in my stash for this event again, what the hell guys.

[https://www.gamersdecide.com/articles/fallout-76-player-count#:\~:text=At%20the%20time%20of%20this,million%20copies%20sold%20at%20launch](https://www.gamersdecide.com/articles/fallout-76-player-count#:~:text=At%20the%20time%20of%20this,million%20copies%20sold%20at%20launch)
---
so a game that sold 1.4 mill copies at launch and as of Jan 2020 had about 400k remaining players will have better long term health by making it harder for newer and casual players who are need to the game afloat. The game came to xbox gamepass on July 9th and will have an influx of new players but gearing the game to make it harder for them is not good for the health of the game i feel. Its good for the health of long time high lvl players yes but that is not the whole community.
---
Spend money immediately 😃 
---
-todd
---
One big build help thread would be a good idea tbh! Hopefully this starts one
---
It's like the media news cycles. It'll come back around. :)
---
I've been saying this *forever.* Most of the underarmor suits are designed to be worn under power armor -*in canon*\- and it's the only thing that would fit within a power armor frame anyway so it's silly that we don't get their bonuses.
---
I consider myself hardcore (playing since release, all armor and builds, all godrolls, bored enough to give Bloodied Fixers and Junkie's FF Teslas for free) and Project Paradise is still a fucking nightmare because it is impossible to shine at it while solo (feeders), and the creatures just love getting in trouble.
---
I went from 2-3k sneak headshots on the SBQ to 2-300 with my BSS DCG.
---
Well my bloodied explosive was not killing the super mutants in one shot through west tek. Although, the only buffs I had were damage perks, covert operative and ballistic bock. It takes me at least two even with max adrenaline, unless I hit them in the head, but I wasn't using vats, so my hits weren't perfect shots.
---
OP: "I fully support your right to peacefully protest, but do it where I can't see or hear you."
---
It’s down to 1,850 now. Likely dipping their toe in the water to see how many people notice/object.
---
Damn bro like 90% of the people on here are just salty as hell
---
It worth a lot. Its legacy.  It breaks to quick and that might be why ur having a hard time trading it.    But don’t script it.
---
As someone who is tired of the constant bitching in this subreddit, I agree to an extent. Unfortunately I cant see how One Appalachia is good short term or long term. As others have stated, I burn through more resources than I can gather when out exploring. 
---
I get that I can do Daily Ops for ammo, but I shouldnt have to do one particular 'dungeon' or mission just to replenish. My play style is to grind until Im waaay over-leveled for the next region/mission, and this patch has kind of ruined that for any new players looking to do the same.
---
I'm moving on to another game now. Hopefully the people that stick it out enjoy it, but what the game is becoming is of no interest to me.
---
Depends on the perks and build. Why shouldn’t two different weapons potentially both be viable or comparable in damage output?
---
Considering flamers are much more powerful, even non-bloodied ones, getting a flamer would be really lucky, if not impossible. I would try to trade up to a good flamer. As a player who has gotten every weapon I could ever want through trading, I'd say it's your best bet.
---
If they're worthless to you, then just stash them at locations where new players would find them.
---
Or, fot those of us issuing our first" complaint" after playing Bethesda games for many years ,shouldn't get talked down to because we make we our first complaint.
---
My favorite holiday is cancelled. Cancel Xmas, not Halloween! Fallout without Halloween is not Fallout.
---
Yeah, no third person without a mod.
---
You’re a true OG.  What level are you packing?
---
Finally someone with the guts to help.
---
are you missing materials needed to build it?
---
I wasn’t playing last year during Mischief Night and missed all the spoopy stuff, any chance you wouldn’t mind doing this at my camp? 😬
---
I will be trying the market sub today, never knew they had a discord that’s news to me
---
Yes of course, the death of the bloodied build. I have been stocking up on TSE stuff to sell off once they dropped the damage recalculation. Glad I did lol
---
I pass by so many subreddits in my trip through r/all.  And it's amazing how many specific game ones always have these stupid posts. "If you don't like the game, just stop playing" as if it's profound and not a lazy and boring way to deflect criticism just because you enjoy it and don't want to go through the idea that not everyone finds the game as perfect as you do.
---
sure but they also said it was "intended" for the queen to not be crippled patches ago then they said that was a mistake and now we gonna make it so you can cripple her again....
---
Both min maxed for damage. The problem is that a melee weapon you need to get close and a heavy like a Gatlin can basically be a sniper if you wanted
---
I think you're conflating two issues. People who actively seek out karma for a sense of accomplishment vs people who "farm" karma and are then able to sell their high karma account to someone that wants to appear credible.
---
I tried out the Standard Nozzle and 100% agree. Especially when aiming for the head / face, it still does boss damage.
---
Yeah, melee is rough because you don't have 250 yards of breathing room to sit back at wait.
---
Well it’s surely doable to solo them under 8min, but for 6min or less you’d definitely need two spots held simultaneously, by more than one player apparently.
---
That’s what I plan on doing but I’m not sure what other legacies I would take for this
---
Flamers usually aren't duped as much so they have better value generally. What other weapons are you interested in?
---
I still run a bloodied unarmed build. Exact same perks as before. Nothing has changed. Sure, my damage on the pip boy went from 1,700 to 500, but I can still kill things pretty easy. Instead of my usual 1 punch, now it’s 2. AT MOST 3. 
---
Still, punching an enemy 3 times isn’t a big deal for me. I also run a shotgun build and heavy gunner build. Both bloodied. So i simply swap the perks from time to time. But my main is still a bloodied unarmed build. 
---
I keep reading posts about how unarmed is ruined. Impossible to kill things. Etc. It’s definitely not ruined. People are just mad they don’t see high numbers anymore.
---
Got 2 in a row.  Not a fan of the outfit.
---
Totally. As someone that works in a creative industry for decades, I'm pretty savvy to when something is just bitching and complaining, and genuine useful feedback. 
---
And most of the posts here are just bitching and complaining. Even this guys post comes down to complaining about other people. He offers no feedback. Like, instead of attacking them, try and open an dialog with them. See, that's feedback. His suggestion is get the hell out of here if you don't like it.
---
No problem. And yeah I didn't really like workshops much at first, but if you can grab a couple of them with lead deposits, and then go farming, you just occasionally go check on them in-between locations and it will add to your stack quite a bit. If you get a server with people who want to just take workshops and wreak havoc which seems a bit more rare now compared to when I first started, you should be able to hop to the next one and repeat the process. Its up to you, but workshops are great for getting off your feet and I loved using them at a lower level as they just give you resources for free while you're out farming and you come back to a nice haul to add to it. Good luck either way man
---
They are leaving due to these constant issues and at some point Beth will shutter the game:
---
https://steamcharts.com/app/1151340
---
Be careful what you wish for
---
I tried to launch my first nuke in a location that got AROUND Fissure Site Prime, and for me, the complete opposite of this statement was true.
---
I literally could ONLY snap it to the Fissure Site’s map icon; it legitimately wouldn’t let me place it just in a random spot.
---
Pardon me for trying to help you, 
---
yes I do play I have over 1400 hours in, 5 different characters and none of them have any problems with this upgrade. Simply because I know all about perks synergies and what works.
---
So why don’t you just keep moaning like a spoiled child instead of listening to people trying to help you.
---
Technically yes, but it has been in beta for a long time now. And isn't the point of it being in beta that they can fix stuff?
---
Yes another reason to craft 20k 45 with my maxed out legendary ammo perk. That card is the best thing since slice bread
---
So glad I never bought this game. You can just feel the desperation years later of users wanting it to be a great Bethesda title and it just isnt, never was, never will be.
---
AP/sent with dodgy and serendipity and you won't even feel those gutsy shooting you. 
---
That first daily ops, I just stood still next to the beacon and barely took any damage... If it gets too crazy, take a nuka cola of some sort for more AP so dodgy keeps working.
---
I know this is crazy but I’m also after an explosive gat laser, but being realistic I like any heavy weapon that has explosive effects
---
True thats one option. I prefer server hopping that gigantic tree in the mire with around 7 cave crickets in it, cant remember the name of the location right now.
---
True. I'm not complaining or anything. I just have to do a lot more moving around to get away from the enemies shooting, so I feel like it would be more fun to have the cover feature back.
---
How *exactly* does this bug work? Do I have to have the perk? Or do I have to be killed by someone who has it?
---
I've always wanted a suppressed Walther PPK/S. It is such a sleek and sexy little pea shooter.
---
Probably a player that baited you into pvp. Probably had a full pvp setup and was just waiting for someone to take a shot at the bounty.
---
I’m still not seeing a problem. Some people enjoy up close combat and others enjoy ranged. So there should be viable options for both.
---
Character builds are very important, I always recommend people use the online build websites to put together their builds.
---
It resets at 1 eastern time. Score dailies reset at noon eastern time.
---
I did daily yesterday with a friend and we could only finish with the paladin rank. 
---
I got 192 .50 cal ammo as the reward. And each body only had 4 or 8 .50 cal bullets on them. So I definitely used more ammo than was given back to me.
---
they do. it's called the same thing (m a r qu e t 76, you can't type it for some stupid reason) so it's probably easy to find.
---
you'll get more bites there rather than the sub. but try both anyway. you may have to top it off with something, though.
---
alternatively, do the daily ops. if you can get the BoS suit or mask, you can get whatever you want for either of them.
---
IMO radiation rumble is the hardest event to do solo
---
Right but if you use a Vaporization Nozzle and change servers, you'll have a range of **1**. I get range penalties, but that's broken. Yes?
---
180, 160, 120, 70, 20 (rounding down for each since I’m not logged in)
---
Because they still have not actually given us what we want. The biggest complaint besides the game being so janky and buggy still is the arbitrary mobile app time gates. Its why a lot of people gave up on the game once they hit hi level. Nobody wants to spend two months grinding bulion and mods for decent SS armor.
---
This. People expect the game to be easy when all they have equipped is QOL perks.
---
Well magic weapons ain’t fixed. U can easily keep ur new respect and find another magic shotgun.  It will still kill stuff quick without any shotgun perks.
---
Thanks, I was worried about balancing main quest, wastelanders, multiple workshops being attacked, but I’ll give it a shot!
---
Bruh 20? Is that the best amazon servers provide? I see people in CS complaining about 64 tick not being consistent enough all the time
---
PvP \*is\* good for you!
---
Yes I know I like to play both but an up close weapon needs to be able to 1 hit otherwise its useless
---
but they are soloable. you need the proper build for that, though.
---
I think it's more like a lot of people hate playing in groups. I know that I do.
---
At this point I'm farming in Daily Ops, guaranteed legendary item dropped into my inventory, mons drop appropriate ammo if any of my teammates kill them, and all high level mons- I'm happy
---
My alts camp is close to the wayward too and it does 5 times the business of my main characters camp near clarksburg even though both camps sell similar items at similar prices
---
Yo brother. Mic user, chill guy. I smoke pot so i can be goofy/slow. Im a solid char and would love to just kick around WV with you. Psn egroegy
---
I did "Paradise project" yesterday. Before p22 it was "who will see a final boss first - wins a legendary". Yesterday, the team of 6 100+, 200+, 400+ players spent two minutes trying to kill a fog crawler. Couple guys in PA died in the process. That's fun again.
---
Next hour I went to blast zone and accidentally found Colossal Vendigo in the forest. I was trying to survive and do any decent damage for like 10 mins till my team (200+ and 451 bloodied) arrived. We spent 15 minutes killing it. Bloodied died couple times. It's a challenge again.
---
Takes me 6 minutes - happy with the returns compared to other events.
---
Even my BE railway rifle struggles. And I hate using it because that would require me using VATS - the recoil on that thing is stupid. My BE handmade barely tickles anything anymore and while my BE laser just about gets the job done it breaks too quickly to justify use for PvE.
---
Couldn’t find your GT on Xbox bro, add me GT cozyxhugo
---
But I haven’t changed anything in my stash or scrapped anything. Suddenly after the update it changed. I never had a multiscope or osmosis kit in the first place. I was surprised that the game thought I had them. But I’ll try to find these items and see if I can go back to my glory days.
---
Dude that is so many alts.  You of all people should stand strong with my cause.  You got shafted by playing multiple characters...unless you don’t feel that way, which I don’t get, but you do you
---
I got the mask and since I know everyone is wondering it goes perfectly with the clean Chally costume.
---
Even if it is doable, that's not the point of them. I love playing solo, but these events and ops are all clearly team oriented. You can do them solo, but that's not what they were made for. So when people say "I used to be able to do blah blah event solo and now I can't, it's so stupid" or "I can't get elder solo, why are the ops so hard" and stuff like that, it makes me facepalm. They aren't intended to be done alone, or it wouldnt be multiple spread out objectives in these events or a speed multiplier for having more people on point to get it done faster.
---
Yep, its easy enough to help guide people. Ive been trying to help "tweak" their build . Still want people  to have their own playstyle, so ive been trying  **NOT**  to completely wipe everything they have laid out and just recommend a few adjustments to help them cope with the changes. Often times a couple changes here and there can make a big difference for  people. Theres alot of mechnics to this game that people simply dont know about/how they work. And explaining it can make a big difference in their n understanding of the game.
---
One thing i have to say about this sub is theres a ton of Min maxers ( i min max to a degree myself) who want to shit on peoples builds who dont min max. Rather than try to discourage people and belittle them, you should encourage them and give them pointers. Rather than telling them everything they are doing is wrong and they suck at life and the need to "get good", give them some helpful advice. Negativity isnt going to help anyone.
---
Y'all keep making me hungry for steak and rolls.
---
I looked last night when I thought of the idea but no one was selling. Also with the vendor glitch being back it seems less people are selling. Then you can imagine that many people wouldn't put in the resources to make a mutation that is generally useless.
---
Good Guns n' Ash Roses song there.

Gatling plasmas have been duped a fair amount of times so that might be an easier trade to swing. The damage changes hit laser rifles harder than heavy guns so that is part of the issue.
---
Fallout 1st has nothing to do with what I said.  I have a stockpile because of Fallout 1st and the scrapbox.  But I only have that much steel because I picked up the scrapper perk.  You could use it just the same to collect just as much steel.  You just need to use it when you get it rather than hold on to it.  So only farm what you need.  But you'll farm it 4x as fast.  And you get a free 50 coins at 50, plus all the coins from scrapping any unwanted cards that you've collected thus far.  So you could get two legendary perks to rank 2 and switch if need be.  You get your second slot at 75 also which is only another 25 levels.  And in 76, 25 levels is nothing if you know how to increase your xp gain correctly.
---
My Gunslinger is doing fine and remains arguably the most fun of my three toons to play as.  Tank Killer helps a lot (although I've heard Rank 3 might be bugged?).
---
Sounds great man. I will add you. Got an armor set for farming that I am using now.
---
It's actually true. After patch noticed that numbers don't make sense. My "handmade" mostly worthless, while "lever action rifle" still does same damage(mb slightly less), but there's more, one of my rifles&gt;!(not gonna say which one to avoid nerf)!&lt; does 1200 dmg per shot compare to 400-500 on others and all this with Stealth Rifleman/Commando builds. After reading this post decided to run some test with my melees for easier numbers&gt;!(actually run them twice due to technical issues)!&lt;.
---
Here's some numbers for those who interested.
---
Test goes like this: 27 STR with Ninja perk, tested on LVL 60 PROTECTRON WATOGA (DR 146 ER 104).
---
||Instigating Sheepsquatch staff 40% more power attack damage|Instigating Deathclaw gauntlet +50% limb damage|Bloodied Deathclaw gauntlet             +50% limb damage|
---
|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|LA\_DD|358 (must be 380)|352 (must be 458)||
---
|LA\_DD\_S3x|550 (must be 1140)|487 (must be 1374)|404 (must be 831)|
---
|||||
---
|PA|379|399|481|
---
|PA\_DD|678 (must be 758)|611 (must be 678)||
---
|PA\_DD\_S3x|1016 (must be 2274)|846 (must be 2 034)|703 (must be 1443)|
---
&gt;!LA - light attack | PA - power attack | DD - Instigating effect | S3x - Ninja perk effect!&lt;
---
&gt;!Also killed some 75-100 lvl ghouls all weapon does slightly similar damage.!&lt;
---
After those tests a little bit disappointed. Yes, numbers are more consistent, but at the same time they don't make sense. It would be logical to apply DD/Sneak bonuses last, after target resist. But when they actually apply is still a mystery. And probably "Covert Operative" perk suffers same issue as "Ninja", in result stealth builds suffer from it.
---
Although with my build I'm still pretty much able to kill everything in one shot, but I would like to have more logical numbers.
---
100% agree
---
I speak for myself; but I genuinely enjoy FO76 and always keep Bethesda in mind when I’m commenting with a complaint or criticism. I imagine it gets tiresome seeing the same complaints over and over again, but I would like to think the moderators of this subreddit see all that feedback and it allows them to see which issues need to be addressed first, so they can continue to improve the game. I think this is a necessary part of the process.
---
What an egregious false-equivalency to imply that packing up 10, 20, 30 years of family, relationships, possessions, and comforts is somehow tantamount to putting a game down for a couple weeks or months.
---
I have been dreaming with a crazy shootout in Flatwoods since the game was released. I want to fight endless waves of ghouls while trying to protect the Vendorbot, a sniper shooting from the tower, two power armored tanks machineguning and blocking the door, etc.
---
I want THAT firefight. I want someone to help Earl Williams escape from the mine and try to make its way into the Whitespring. I want to help\`Foundation stop a raider attack, and see all those NPC's killing and getting hurt.
---
Oh yeah? That interesting care to explain?
---
Bethesda took my 60 euro for me to beta test their game. They said "gimme gimme gimme gimme" as well when they released this shit fuck of a game. But yeah, bad me for talking on a forum when I got scammed.
---
Electrical absorption is a must have for pa users. Energy attacks also heal you, and they have said it is intended
---
There are a handful of weapons that do not drop their own ammo type, mostly heavy and explosives. You may want to double check that you aren’t using from that list.
---
People complaining about people complaining about the new update. I hope they realized that they changed it BECAUSE OF COMPLAINING to begin with. So we're all a bunch of whiners 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
it's a rare reward too 🤣
---
I don’t think it does make things much harder for them. The damage rebalance effects them the least because they were stacking fewer buff perk cards. On top of that a level 30 will find level 30 ghouls at the white springs not level 68 because a high level player recently strolled through.
---
If ur struggling with a bloodied commando ur perks got to be setup wrong.  
---
My bloodied commando melts anything like it did before.  Granted some lvl 100 enemies now require 2-3 shots more.
---
They don’t work on crouched players either - even after they stand up.
---
I feel you man. I used to be able to look at the ground and everything would die. I didn't even have to pay attention. Now I actually have to PLAY this game that I paid for so I could have fun. I hate that I have to have fun during my free time rather than mindlessly grinding for imaginary stuff I don't need or care about.
---
I'm able to solo everything except Project Paradise, Free Range and Radiation Rumble. And it's only because I can't keep the things alive on my own, I can handle the mobs that get thrown at me though.
---
Increasing the tick rate increases the computation demands which increases the cost of the servers, and depending on how they've implemented their network stack it's possible it would increase bandwidth usage and costs too.
---
I have all materials needed, like I said, it just shows that red circle with a line through it, but only in generators menu. I built it from misc structures but it doesn't generate power like that.
---
I'm not your buddy, pal.
---
Turn all existing  shelving  into displays.
---
Just shy of 2k atoms, but the bullion, script and caps almost compensate for the loss, especially casual players who don't really build up huge amounts of script/bullion during their play sessions
---
Isn’t Encryptid in the ash heap?
---
Well... You can convert the combat rifle down to .38... Don't know if it's "worth" though.
---
I had a Furious Pipe I was using for trash mobs... But .. not anymore.
---
Before this last update trading was a lot easier, I would wait a little to figure out the true value of your weapon. Once you know the true value try to trade up from there. With all the backlash and people moving away from bloodied, it's hard to trade bloodied weapons right now.
---
Currently it resets an hour after the dailies. In the near future it will be changed to reset alongside them.
---
Give overall weapons a buff and I'll be happy. It would balance out the high health pools and resistances and SPECIAL stats of normal enemies that are now about 40+ levels than their old selves and would incentivize critical damage as criticals in any game is proof of at least minor skill use. People using VATS perk cards would be ofcourse balanced out by not having other perks that would be useful for their builds of they chose the VATS route. 
---
Spongey enemies are bad game design and shows that low levels is the most fair it'll ever be as going higher you get level regression with spongey high-damage enemies.
---
Well damn it =(
---
I don't see how else they're supposed to balance the game so that some people aren't drastically more powerful than everyone else. If they make it so that any combination of perks and weapons and armor work fine then the people who bother to optimize will be way overpowered like they were before. Then everyone complains about kill stealing, legendary stealing, events being ended seconds after they begin, and the powerful players end up bored with no challenge.
---
It comes down to... do you want to play Fallout or not? Playing Fallout has always meant paying attention to your skills and perks and gear. It's just that up till now this game was messed up and let you get away with a poor build, and now it doesn't and is just like every other Fallout game. The only difference being that this game has no difficulty slider to lean on, it's set on survival mode for everyone.
---
Ok. Sorry I guess.
---
I like trying the daily ops solo the first time so I can get a feel for whats going on, then doing them again on a team. Makes me feel like I'll be more help.
---
No, they don’t. Especially not a DC Gauntlet, which is pretty quick already. Though it’s a ‘Medium’ swing speed weapon, it’s quick enough it should almost be classified as ‘Fast’ in my opinion. 
---
If you want to one shot enemies and are worried about staying too long in close quarters, get an Instigating version. Or equip defensive perks like Blocker or Serendipty and appropriate gear like Sentinel’s or Cavalier’s. 
---
Bloodied can be exceptionally tanky. If you need guidance on that, check out Angry Turtle’s videos.
---
VATs in PvP broke after Wastelanders dropped.
---
Yeah, it's rougher, but not in a fun way. I'm a new, casual,  low level player just trying to explore the world and do some of the story missions, and this new level scaling just makes that super tedious. 
---
A random pack of feral ghouls while walking along the road on the forest used to be just a minor distraction. They were level 3, I was level 12, spend a few seconds shooting them and get on with my life. Now I'm level 14, and all three of them are also level 14 and so they take a bunch more shots to bring down. So now all of a sudden this minor meaningless encounter has used up half of my gun's durability, a bunch of bullets (sorry I'm only level 14, I don't know what the hell that 'ammo smith' perks or whatever people are talking about is, and I don't know what the daily ops are all about and I don't feel like worrying about them yet, so ammo is sometimes scarce for me). Oh, and since I can't drop them quickly, there's a good chance at least one of those ghouls is going to close the distance and get a few swipes on me, so now I have to burn a stimpak as well. 
---
None of those changes makes that encounter any more fun for me. It's just tedious. It just wastes my playing time doing things that aren't fun and leaves me less time and resources to do the stuff in the game that I want to do. And it took a game that a week ago I was having fun with and considering putting some money into,  and basically made it way less fun overnight, to the point where I haven't played it again in a couple days. 
---
I'm fully aware that this is a big game with lots of people playing it, and I'm certainly not expecting or demanding that every moment of the game be perfectly tailored to my personal preferences. But when you're making a game this broad and which combines such a wide range of player levels/experience/etc. it's almost never going to be a good idea to make such a drastic change totally across the board like they did. 
---
I totally understand why many long-term high level players wanted more difficulty and why many of them are enjoying this update. But I really do not understand one bit why with a game world as large as this one Bethesda thought it was a good idea to jack up the difficulty everywhere and for everyone the way that One Wasteland does. 
---
It just seems so poorly thought out, and honestly just lazy. It's not only brutal for new players like me who don't understand the game anywhere near enough to easily adapt, but it also apparently slams the door on a bunch of more casual play styles. 
---
Sure, on a technical level, it's kind of a weird instanced hybrid, but at a broader level Fallout76 is an MMO. And for an MMO to succeed financially, its devs need to balance their game to offer something to a wide variety of players. They need to understand and accept that features that appeal to their long-time hardcore players aren't necessarily going to go over well with casual players and newer players, and so they need to figure out a way to build a game that offers different kinds of fun to both. 
---
This kind of balancing act is just inherent in the act of making a big multiplayer game. And it's a tough problem that takes continual effort to try to keep a lot of people happy. But it's what they signed on to when they decided to make the game, and based upon the comments we've been seeing the past few days, they didn't do a great job of it with this last update.
---
i was useing shotgun minigun and 50cal and yesterday all of those gave me the ammo for them but not today for some reason, i even relogged and still was messing up
---
As do I, that's why I mainly play solo as I said. But they are team oriented. Yes, it's possible to solo them. But that's not what they were made for, they were made with teams in mind. So you will obviously have a much better time if you get a team. If you can pull off soloing it, that's fine. But a lot of people are complaining that they can no longer solo certain events or they can't solo the ops, and that clearly shows that these are not meant to be solo'd. Just because your overpowered build could solo something doesn't mean that's the way it was intended to be done.
---
Could you tell us what gun you are using. Some guns don't work that way.
---
Ooooh, thank you. Good to know
---
I don’t feel like I’m getting shafted. I’m in no hurry and like a reason to keep playing. 
---
Each character has a reason though:
---
1) original adventure character
---
2) my survival character... of course survival is one so now he is just my powerhouse for daily ops
---
3) wastelanders character 
---
4) nuclear winter character 
---
5) created just for easy season level ups. I trashed him 4 times last season and started new but now am keeping his as a unique vendor who only sells baseball related merchandise.
---
Full set of Troubleshooters Armor for Sugar Grove and Full set of Mutant Slayers for West Tek. Basically I am just ready for doing robots rn. Got my Troubleshooters HM lol.
---
Or like someone had mentioned somewhere else....enemies explode into confetti
---
There's a key piece missing, just not sure what it is. budget, item quantity limitations, something. Usually the UI will tell you exactly what the problem is.
---
I'm yours father
---
Oh that's perfect!
---
Ah a specialist. Im just a stim hoarder :))
---
Define sponges? I can take down a top level super mutant in 4 or 5 shots w/o sneak using my radium rifle.
---
pump shotgun, minigun, and .50cal
---
I have angry turtles build. What I'm saying is that a weapon that has 500bullets per mag should do Lee's than a weapon that you have to be next to your enemy to even start damaging
---
All three of those and some others are what I'm talking about. Multiple different objectives to protect, and shit like that. They aren't made to be solo'd. Cool if you can solo them, Im not saying it's not possible. I'm saying they were made with teams in mind, and are team oriented activities. They aren't made to be solo'd.
---
Beacuse bethesda took my 60 euro for me to beta test their bugged game, and while they do ZERO to compensate for it, which literally every game in the world does, I sit here and wasted weeks and got literally straight out scammed. So not accepting being scammed, is a spoiled child? You didnt TRY to help, you just out of nowhere said my build is wrong, without im sure in your 1400 hours of "playing" or standin afk in your base, have you tried stealth build? Do you know how crit and sneak multiplier works? You just said you doing shotgun, and that was literally in my title as well. Im not talking about shotgun, Im not talking about heavy guns. Im talking about the fact that I had a glitch weapon and spent perk coins literally to swap to a worse build, that should be better on paper. Me spending 100 levels on getting perk cards and swap that I need, and then waste bullets and have to sit for days farming lead and shit at workshops, just again to waste 2k bullets on nothing, and I cant even use melee because I swapped. Im done here, you fo76 fanboys are so tunnelvision its insane, how bethesda is using you for free. If it wasnt for you guys, the game wouldnt had a server online even. Its insane how you defend this shit hole of a game.
---
Vats does not work in PVP with the exception of legacy lasers and railways
---
I don’t know if they already are but those events should be scaled based on participants. One man army meets 10 supermutants, three man team gets 24-30, etc. Otherwise it’s too easy for team or too hard for solo. Real team events are like Rad Rumble, each person has to do his own distinct part and do it with great performances or it would fail. I wish they come up with more events like that or Encryptid.
---
&gt;(why do my legs   
---
&gt;always  
---
&gt; break faster than the rest, even before 1WL).
---
This! exactly I have had SS armor for 2 weeks, I've had to repair the legs twice, while the rest of it is still on the extended health bar.
---
I did a daily op today with a lvl 547 who was running around everywhere and would not stand with me at the uplink. He kept shining his light at me as if he wanted me to help him come kill enemies. So sad.
---
What?
---
Edit: The only thing I can grasp is my comment is in relationship to my beliefs in the 2nd amendment and my belief in Qanon?
---
I'm English, not American lol I live in the UK. And I will say I moved over to Duck duck go and there is not an inbuilt autocorrect and I've noticed I have to search if I've got the spelling right or grammar correct. Ironically I'm a paid **writer**/ director lol damn you years of autocorrect what have you done to me
---
Thanks dude.
---
I believe that was my post!
---
Thats the odd thing, it won't display the usual message for the problem. If I moved it out of water, it would show that it needs to be placed in water, but not when it is. As if I haven't bought it or something.
---
This!!! You watch some mainstream YouTubers and they are relentlessly shitting on the game, to this day, while the background gameplay or bugs they're displaying are months old and fixed.
---
At the beginning trashing fallout 76 got people views because it was a concept many wanted to hate. Any time I convince my friends to play they say the same thing every time: "Wow this is actually so fun. I'm done listening to player reviews." It seems like some people are still trying to ride this train.
---
I do feel, sometimes, we take for granted how far this game has come  and complain about smaller things because we are so used to things being wrong, but even then that  user feedback is how Bethesda continually improve the game. It's really a double edged sword because ,like this comment said, the unyielding criticism turns players away. If you really look around, no one is doing better. Red Dead Online suffers many of the same and sometimes worse issues. Anthem is dead. GTA Online was a shit show for a while before they figured it out. The list goes on.
---
The appreciation that patch 22 got was definitely refreshing and I think  that type of appreciation needs to be done more, when Bethesda does get it right,  to get new players to play the game. Yes each patch will have its bugs, need for rebalance or other smaller issues, but I think it's important to keep in mind how far the game as come as it continues to push forward and improve.
---
Also I like having players on my server cuz my build relies on me being on a team. So if complaining on reddit is what you need to do to stay then have at it.
---
If you buy only the atoms ya. But you also get some in game benifits and you can play in a private world with friends even if they don't have first.
---
I put some things in someone's scrapbox at their camp before I got first, you could also pay for a month, use the private world to claim all the bases, farm for scrap then when your subscription expires you still have access to that scrap.
---
To each their own I guess im a sucker for in game purchases so I figured I could kill 2 birds with 1 stone by paying for the atoms with first so I have some atoms to waste in dumb stuff lol
---
rifleman has been nerfed to the ground? looks like im not coming back then since that is my main. Shove it bethesda.
---
What a game this is.. wow. No words. Im actually about to quit. And for info, I almost never quit games I started out. I am a long therm player. But this game is an exeption. And the tunnel vision fanboys arent helping this game in a better state either. Every gamer out there with slight experience somehow with other games and know how they should work, are laughing about this one.
---
If you are in PC I'm happy to donate to science. Should be on couple hours from now. GT is OvetsSquatsch
---
lol. Wouldn’t call me a specialist. I just trying to be efficient when farming. Might just throw on PA for West Tek since I can’t be bothered to change armor every time.
---
whats all the weapons that dont work with it so i know in the future aswell
---
You've misunderstood the point
---
Complaints can still be valid but overused. Yes there are problems with the game but it's gotten to the point where everyone and their mother is complaining about it.
---
Like no joke I haven't posted here in 2 weeks just because it's been so toxic.
---
I am on Xbox actually are you sure?
---
I probably don’t have as much good stuff as you but here’s what I do: I don’t like to just dump them for people to find. Instead, I sell my plans for 5-10 caps; some even for 1! I also find some players from my country (sometimes I recognize their names etc) and gift them some valuables. I follow some low levels around, check their weapons and if I like them enough I gift them. I decided not to keep anything, we can find everything again in the future. Just get rid of them!
---
One Tamriel definitely saved ESO as well and it's still kickin
---
I tried the gauss shotty in vats and missed every first shot.  Manual aim was fine but damage was poor.  Went back to normal shotty.
---
In the interests of full disclosure
---
There is a custody hearing at the moment over our new potplant after the old one met a drowny end. - my boyfriend is blaming me
---
--
---
I share custody of the cats with him except when they vomit on the carpet &amp; then claims they are strays who wandered in &amp; he has never seen them before
---
Got so maybe try posting yourself when your on
---
There's nothing wrong with that. I solo'd my first op to see what it was, and as soon as I realized more people meant faster speed and a quicker run, I understood it was team oriented and have only gone with teams since. Random teams of people I don't know can easily finish in 6 minutes 30 seconds to 7 minutes. On occasion 7 minutes 30 seconds. My first solo was like 11 ish. But my first run showed me that it was clearly meant for you to team up with people to get it done
---
Yes. And I think people haven't really stopped to check the XP numbers. Each eagle gave me like 65 XP while any ghoul in Meditation gives you three times that. 
---
Daily Ops are for farming ammo and a sure legendary item, or grenades and stimpaks if you are into it. But XP? Not good enough, considering your armor gets attacked a lot.
---
you can follow one of the many pace charts that were out there for last season, since the number of levels and the SCORE needed for each is the same.
---
Im at work currently and will be for a while. If someone hasnt tested before I get home, ill take you up on that offer.
---
You undermine your own point with that absurdity.
---
It's classed as alcohol so it doesn't degrade once it finishes fermenting.
---
Without perks, a vocal sac weighs 5 while one liquid courage weighs 1.
---
Love the Radio songs, I really love 'em, but just abhor the constant complaining of the DJ. What OP proposed makes so much sense, but I feel like Bethesda was already planning to do something similar like this, but since the revenue isn't there they just decided to not continue this on with the DJ's voice actor and implementation of it. - 
---
On a side note, I really miss Three Dawg.
---
Spongesquatch
---
These are all valid points LOL
---
Maybe I need to reinstall and boot up Fallout 4, because I don't remember a cover system.
---
Some categories are limited to certain quantities (you can only build 50 total lights in a CAMP, for example). Maybe you've hit the max quantity for power sources?
---
Tbh I can get caps and other crap through other means. Atoms I have to buy or do these ridicules challenges.
---
Thanks for that, appreciate the info &amp; the link :)
---
Yea I was able to do one run in like 9min solo but once I did it with a team it was under 8 and was nice to really see people WANTING to work together
---
If it’s the post I’m thinking of, it looked like one person got into a debate with you which stemmed from basically it being a ‘Bethesda plz’ post, which is one of the topics that in general the mods have asked the community to stop posting. There’s actually a long list of such topics. Things like ‘bring back fast travel mats to camps’ or ‘increase the stash size’. 
---
When you don’t take time to read the forum rules and post redundant things, that tends to irk some people. You’re not only wasting your own time since you could have used the search function, but your asking others to waste their time as well. That applies mostly to the redundant questions, but the same feeling is applied to redundant statements. 
---
You irked someone and they downvoted you. If you don’t want public discussion or opposing opinions, then I suggest you post your thoughts on a blog where you can disable comments.
---
They are both good.
---
That's not true at all. I'm level 854, have been using Berry Mentats since level 60 and have been stealth just as long so I'm crouched more than not. Crouching has zero to do with their effectiveness.
---
Wonder which class of starship this is. The placement of the nacelles in relation to the midsection and the saucer suggests to me that it isn't any one of the existing USS Enterprise classes; Constitution (NCC-1701, NCC-1701-A), Excelsior (NCC-1701-B), Ambassador (NCC-1701-C), Galaxy (NCC-1701-D) or Sovereign (NCC-1701-E).
---
To me, it reminds me of the Freedom-class the most, so it might be USS Freedom, instead of any of the USS Enterprise iterations.
---
I'm of course not being 100% serious here. Cool build!
---
Same. It doesn't help that it feels like no one is selling that much anymore so I'm always at cap max. I know I can go to the vendor bots but buying from players has more variety.
---
You said everything I wanted to say but was to lazy to type out. 100%
---
&gt;"How could they do this, I cant one shot everything anymore now it takes 2 shots. I'm spending soooooooo much more ammo now"
---
Idk about you but I went from single shot stealth kills to 6+ shot stealth kills with a hunting rifle on level 50 super mutants. that's 6x the ammo for this enemy type, and other enemies scale to 100? It definitely consumes way more ammo, but the thing that annoys me is that now I have to respec my character and also worry about my perk coins at the same time.
---
Man is there a super upvote button here
---
I'm literally just going off what the majority of casual and new players have told me.
---
I'm on Xbox
---
Looks like the update hasn't had a really big impact on me luckily. Just booted up the game for the first time since the new update and I can still sneak headshot the Whitespring ghouls with one shot. I am doing about 50% of the damage I did before but it's still enough. As long as I'm undetected, so I probably shouldn't just throw myself at them.
---
&gt; I wasnt saying complaining is bad and peoplw shouldn't complain
---
You literally were saying exactly this.
---
&gt;seeing the same thing over amd over again gets annoying, if it's been said already, why say it another hundred time
---
People feel strongly about certain things, the more often a thing is said the more likely Bethedsa (or whoever) will see it and understand its a common problem or much wanted change. If you're seeing the same complaints over and over you should consider that whatever they are complaining about is a widespread issue.
---
Also sometimes people just need to vent, nobody forces you to go into the threads and read all the complaints.
---
Yup. Or occasionally from like eight of them.
---
Should reset in 5 minutes.
---
I agree I was just saying that casual players benefit most from the Season rewards
---
You've taken the example way too literally, to the point of absurdity.
---

---
This is right in line with that. The darkness we've endured since BETA? Get out of here.
---
I bet you go to a restaurant, eat your order, then demand it be free because the lady next to looked at you funny.

Ah ok thanks. That’s it I’m officially crazy

Fallout 1st has *everything* to do with having a reasonable stockpile of scrap. If you can store infinite scrap, of course it’s going to have an affect. I too have a scrapbox and I also have a fairly sized stockpile of materials, common and rare alike. But I can tell you now, I wouldn’t be able to do that again so easily. As for legendary perks, I’m pretty sure it costs 50 coins to rank one up once. I’m also certain you get slots every 50 levels, but I could be mistaken. And while you’re right about 25 levels being naught if you know anything about levelling anywhere, it’s suddenly become impossible to have your friends power level you, and since everything scales to your level, unless you have a good build and gear set already, it’s very difficult to level or farm efficiently because you spend more time running than farming/killing.
---
Have.... have you been playing the game? They are literally all sponges for damage once your own character pases the 75 mark. Mainly creatures have gotten a buff from the update so they take several more crit shots than before while still slamming hard damage towards the players now that they are 40+ levels higher. This is the same issue Fallout 4 had when it leveled up into high numbers; enemies do more damage and have higher health pools but the weapons you used ingame will and would always have a set number that it couldn't go over. You either optimize your build in 76 now to focus primarily on ome weapon set as splitting your points for varied gameplay disincentives the new gameplay goal of "shoot more bullets, doesn't matter where", the new Ammo factory is proof of this new gameplay motif of "here is a lot of ammo now go out and shoot"
---
Is it a couple extra shots? Yes but Fallout 76's main gameplay gimmic is mobs of enemies at a time. Players are heavily unfavorable if in solo.
---
It's already in game.  It's a Daily Ops reward.
---
She is ok but she is no Tabitha
---
They're losing money by the minute. Expect this to be fixed faster than anything you've ever seen.
---
I'd honestly love if a Behemoth world boss could launch players in the air similar to Skyrim's giants. The regular behemoths already have the attack (the fire hydrant slam), all that's missing is the effect.
---
They supposedly say stuff according to the wiki.  Just super freaking garbled.
---
Corrected: it resets an hour after the dailies challenges reset.
---
What you mean you dont like Nukashines and Radaway kits? /s
---
“It’s a feature.” Nahh for real I agree. Time gates are dumb. End game loot doesn’t feel end game so it’s no use grinding for it. I’m there with ya. But I just took a break. Nothing tells a dev to fix something like telling them and then not playing the game until they do.
---
I always avoided the fight before patch with the sheepsquatch and in no way will fight it unless it is a SCORE challenge. Shit isn't even fun, just monotonous.
---
Yeah, events like radiation rumble are what I'm talking about. Even earlier game events like feed the people or tea time. Its 3 spread out objectives to protect. You can't be in three places at once, so it's obviously not intended to be solo'd. I've solo'd a few myself, but it's not as fun and if you slip up and aren't paying much attention, it's easy to fail it when you could've just gotten a team mate or two and been done with it easy. They are just very obviously team oriented is all I'm trying to say. I personally haven't done encryptid before, mainly because people seem to have issues with it where they wait for people to show up and the first person who shows just starts it up and they fail because of it.
---
what,... level are you I am 294 and only got 3 to level 3.
---
Pros: 
---
-Very, very tanky
---
-Pretty much never breaks
---
-Best with heavy guns + Stabilized perk
---
Cons:
---
-Keeping up with fusion cores
---
-Getting out and in PA animation gets annoying
---
-Carry weight is okay but not the greatest (Calibrated shocks is a must)
---
Just a few of the minor but still pretty important ones, hope this helps. I've been a heavy guns user since wastelanders and i'm always in power armor, and i've stuck to it since and love it. Would definitely recommend!
---
My main is ~245, but it feels so sour to have to wait until 300 to unlock the last card and even longer to max out (I’ve done minor respecs about half a dozen time and one major).  I just have all these ideas for how I would use the extra special and as I said in the post I feel entitled to more (even though I know I’m dead wrong and one good double xp weekend will fix most of my issues).
---
Bah dum shhh.
---
No more corny 50's sci-fi vibe. 😢
---
Bosses are supposed to have a lot or health
---
That's very nice of you and a very great way to look at it ☺️
---
To my knowledge, those should work fine. I’m asking because I just ran an Op using a prime Ult.Gat and while all the drops were random, I did get four ultracite fusion cores from the completion. Maybe server hop?
---
Yet shaft those that been around since beta. It doesn’t matter as I’m done grinding. I’ve moved on to other games when they released season 1. Maybe they’ll release a offline version of the game where we can mod it.
---
Based on what you just said, I'm very happy to have a shotgun that 3 shots everything because they're dropping 20 rounds per-body. I'm rollin' in ammo. These ops are great (sometimes).
---
Finding some of those blocking legendary pieces and the one that reflects damage could be really fun. You should hunt some player vendors as those go really cheap!!
---
You could have a badass melee build!!

---
Let me know what everyone thinks! I haven’t decided on my last two legendary perks but I was thinking ammo factory and Agility increase.
---
I swap between explosive heavy guns and explosive shotguns but only swap out the 3 cards in strength when I do
---
Absolutely not. The Legendary Perks are meant to be a top tier feature, requiring planning and thought towards your style of play. One of my favorite things about the Fallout franchise is that I have to sacrifice some abilities to be able to use others. It forces me to be smart about my choices. Perk coins being a rare commodity is how it should be.
---
Agree that quick hands is a waste. It’s just not enough of a chance and also doesn’t stack with other reload speed bumps. No reason for it if you take ground pounder or the reload speed magazine, or have a 15fr effect. 
---
I did squeeze 1 rank of gunfu into my build. Additional ranks make sense but I need to see how my ap use goes before I can allocate actionboy/girl ranks to gunfu. Loosing AP for vats is just as bad as having to reload. 
---
Commando perks are still worth it. There just are not enough perks that give more than 5% damage per rank to pass them up. The optimal choice would be to do rank 1 in each and free up 6 ranks, but you wouldn’t have other damage perks for those ranks. So that’s a hit of 30% dmg for the option of non damage perks.
---
I might not be a high and mighty level 854, but I had a level 176 character pre wipe, and I’m 116 now. I’m also an avid PvPer, so I know *exactly* what I’m talking about. That’s why it’s so annoying fighting people using the Chinese Stealth suit or the pricks who crouch while using a Stealth Boy.
---
Na.  I was just being hyperbolic.  Todd lied...people cried.
---
Thanks man. Will do
---
Yes I can tank just about anything with Power Armor and my vampires gatling gun. Its pretty awesome.
---
Why?  A combat knife is a CQC weapon. A .50 cal is a ranged weapon. Why should the knife do more damage than the .50 round?
---
Herpes.
---
Fwiw it got added with daily ops;
---
 https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Scavenged_solar_panel
---
Edit: drop rate for just this plan;
---
Initiate: 0.22%
---
Paladin: 0.44%
---
Elder: 3.56%
---
That's not really complaining but reporting a bug, so keep doing that.
---
Complaining would be making a post about how you've done the event twice and still haven't found all the plans it gives and how you're gonna find another game unless they transfer all the plans to your account because they've done you a great injustice.
---
Seriously, we need more of the mole miners. They create an entirely new cool faction and what do we get instead? More of the goddamn BOS.
---
I have the same issue on a lower level character and no issues with my main. No materials missing, just won’t let me build. My best guess is it needs one of the specific generator plans learned in order to craft it.
---
OP PSA for you: if you tired of complainers here maybe go find other sub then?
---
While there is 'valid complaints' it better be going as it helps to become game better, even with this long route Community -&gt; CM -&gt; Devs. I don't say there isn't BS complaints.
---
Now this:
---
&gt; They need to make money. 
---
How about to release a good quality product then?
---
&gt; be happy about the fact there arent any loot boxes 
---
What a good point "it could be worser". But i like "it could be better" more.
---
Also thanks to all these 'complainers' who made a positive changes in the game real. Peace
---
Teams are "recommended". Those who wish to achieve solo completion are looking for something more.
---
Very true! Especially on PS4. It feels like there's hardly anyone playing and when they are, there's nothing in their vendors. Like 5 plans and a handful of 38 ammo. Plus, I haven't seen a nuke since the update lol..
---
I agree. Seeing people actually helping each other get the objectives done and working together fluidly blew my mind. People want those rewards though so it makes sense lol they just needed some incentive.
---
They have much more important things to fix than mischief night. As fun as that event is, I'd rather see them fix issues that are present all year round before worrying about an event that will only be running for a little while.
---
Yea i get what you mean imma just give up on this shit
---
Alright dude, I'm not gonna argue with you.
---
I hope you’ll be free of your burdens soon 🙋🏻‍♀️
---
it is okay I am in power armour so it will be recycled into useful water
---
If it’s obvious, then there’s no need to point it out. That makes it a redundant post.
---
I love how you admit your entitledness haha
---
Some radaway and 16 40mm grenade rounds. Been to him three times and got the same thing from each time.
---
There's a lot of backpacks and armor pieces that help manage weight. People really need to pick a combat style and take the relevant perks. 
---
Upvoted
---
Nice drop. Are you going to put the Armor Ace paint job on it?
---
The latest thing I've seen people complain about is the Bombs dropped event instead of your normal cookie cutter Halloween event
---
Wait to level 300 then you still have to rank all 6 cards up. Does anyone know what rank you have to be approx to have 6 max rank cards.? I'm level 410 and I don't think I'll have 6 max cards by 500.
---
Why would i do that 😂
---
Is it?  Then paradise is in forest. I got confused
---
he appears to have the same drop pool as forbidden knowledge
---
edit: i got a science scribes outfit and some ammo but my friend got the shielded bos lining so makes me think its the same pool as turning in tech data
---
This... Found out on accident last night. Not a fun surprise.
---
Fusion cores as in weight. Sucks keeping them on you, sucks keeping them in stash. These are just my views on it though
---
Yeah i have a makeshift set of super mutant reduction armor and oh boy did it make yesterdays op a breeze! Think i used like 4 diluted stimpacks lol
---
can you keep geting rewards from him ? or was this different charcters?
---
Couple 5mm rounds and some purified water when I did it.
---
I'm also using pump shotgun and i don't get any shotgun shells when I do daily ops, just random ammo all the time :/
---
I’m not sure you understand. You can crouch and they’ll work just fine if you’re using them. But if the dude you’re trying to fight is using them, he won’t be able to see you because crouching breaks them.
---
Right? You could practically do it blindfolded knowing this!
---
Thanks. Just checked mine. Looks like 300 .50 rounds for me.
---
I was curious about this interaction too. Following your post to see
---
Personally I have always enjoyed fallout 76. The hackers make it a bit less fun, I play on console and some how I still encounter hackers, though luckily not as much on pc. The game has come a long way since launch, and I look forward to seeing where it goes
---
blowing up cars caused a ton of server lag, which made the event difficult/impossible to load for some people.
---
this could have been fixed really easily....
---
Surprise!!!
---
Sheepsquatchs are not bosses, they are normal enemies. I do not see Earle walking in the wasteland.
---
Yep played every day, got elder on all the daily ops. Took me 4 shots with my radium rifle to take out a super mutant in the valley galleria yesterday.
---
Lol
---
Yes they are.
---
What is this comment?  16 times the detail of Skyrim was a lie at launch and is more so one now.  I’m not insulting him...it’s the truth.  My mom is alive, but I’m dead from your cutting remarks.  Love you
---
Also yes, carry weight isn't a problem. All I said is it's not the best compared to a high cap backpack
---
Do what works best for you. I just had someone get offended because I simply added some potentially relevant and useful clarifying information about the Encryptid event.  He seemed to think I was attacking him. 
---
You may need to evaluate if in some cases *(not all, because some people can be intentional jerks)*, perhaps you are misunderstanding and getting offended when there was neither a reason to be offended nor an intent for you to be offended.
---
Lol okay then, whatever floats your boat
---
temporarily remove some percentage of the cars.  problem solved
---
Steel Dawn wasn’t delayed, it was merged with Fractured Steel. If anything, FS got effectively cancelled.
---
Ty, I posted something similar and much shorter earlier today about the whiners. Im glad yours got traction
---
That's actually not far off from what I put it up for. I'll jump on, but I'm going to be doing something else for a bit.
---
Whatever floats yours.
---
If i want to fsrm ammo or stimpacks i will just join a daily ops and still try for the top tier rewards. I still grt smmo and stuff and I also grt a legendary item. Faster I complete them the more legendary items I get. If im going for just ammo I dont even bother with a team.
---
No idea, but some people tend to do that. Which was my point. Reporting bugs is fine because it helps the game. Feeling entitled about something ridiculous is not okay.
---
I am okay with people complaining about certain aspects of the game because it might make Bethesda rethink something, for instance the Ammo converter. But some posts are a bit over the top, which is what I was going for in my example.
---
I've been using electrical absorption because rn it heals you in addition to recharging the power core...Not sure if it intended but its made some of the DOps a breeze
---
No. The free 50 was more than enough. They are legendary perks for a reason not a free gimmie.  If I have to grind out a few hundred more levels I will just to have an exemplary build  that has a great balance it will feel much better.   
---
With one wasteland I found levels are even easier to achieve especially now that i can bullion sink lunchboxes. In an hour yesterday I managed to go from 255 to 262, 4 lunchboxes, inspiration, herbivore cranberry relish (25% xp) brain bombs 8 int (17% xp) well rested full unyielding casual group. I have 51 int which is 102%+ (I say plus since I have not done the math myself but the given math in another post would imply each int gives 3.6% which seems rather high and would be 183% if that is the case which it may really be and I have seen other math that says it is 2.1% and just play the minimum since I have note see definitive proof myself of either.
---
They nerfed the board hard at the end of last season with the extra daily challenges. This time there are way more weekly challenges. Don’t worry about missing some dailies if you manage to knock out all the weekly ones.
---
Well you're not going to get something more lol. You don't get a better reward doing it solo, and considering I had solo'd events for a while before realizing how public teams worked, I know it's not somehow more gratifying. Less enemies then if you had more people, so that also means less xp and less loot. Don't know what "something more" you're looking for by doing a team oriented event by yourself. Now that the patch hit, these events are even more team oriented considering an enemy getting to an objective can wreck it fairly quickly, and should be done in teams because of it. I'm not saying all events can't be done solo, but certain events clearly aren't mean to be done solo, and people shouldnt complain that they can't solo every event now that they got nerfed. Its not meant to be done solo.
---
added you ign Tombstone.-
---
I wasn’t hiding it.  It’s in the title.  I know I’m wrong
---
Ahh I see. I can't speak to that since I rarely PvP.
---
Best bet is to report it to BGS. My take is that posting things like this on reddit does spread the word to warn players. Problem is I'm sure some will read this an go on to grief others with this knowledge.
---
I hate that thing 😂
---
I’m almost positive you can... i’ll be on my melee alt In a couple of minutes so I can tell you for sure a second
---
I'm in a similar situation in terms of having limited time to play the game due to finishing school. So I'd consider myself a  casual and mainly solo player. It took me time but I finally configured a build that suits my play style very well. It allows for a good amount of damage, sustainability, and resource management. If you want me to link my SPECIAL set up, I'd be more than happy to. And if you're on XB1, I can craft you practically all you'd need to be set up for it.
---
Yeah, I was amazed/annoyed that they are choosing to do *nothing* for Halloween (something everyone wanted an event for), but are planing to give us *four more* Treasure Hunter events - something that was universally hated and people asked to never return.
---
Like, I know Bethesda is listening, but man that is some selective hearing...
---
I got hit for that too, however I was able to get a B/40%SS/+1S Power Fist and along with the Martial Artist perk (max), it's working pretty well! 😊😃👍🏻
---
Both PA cards are great even if they dont sound like it on paper.
---
If you are a full HP player go for What Rads. You will never need a radaway ever again.
---
Pvp
---
You rock, thanks for the info.
---
At level 50, probably before tbh I started to focus on a build, events, adventuring. Even today 2000+ hours in I'm still finding new stuff.
---
Your literally making little sense. I think you e got your facts mixed up. But since you still dress funny no point in providing anything else.
---
The best part of this is how you’re a little butt dire and bitter over it. Can’t deny cause why else hold on to that for two years and keep bringing it up.
---
Have a bitter life!
---
Excavator is good as well
---
Text chat please.
---
First part is definitely wrong.
---
Should have been like 4 minutes ago.
---
I understand. And admittedly it's easy for me to have my opinion, because I had 5 slots available to me from the get-go, had my Perks already selected, and was able to take one to rank 4, one to rank 3, and one to rank 2 from the outset. I don't have to stress about my build, because it's more or less exactly how I want it without any further needs.
---
Meh, I'm fine with it. It helped me get rid of a couple of thousand rounds I never got rid of through the vendor. Now it's mainly collecting dust in the back of my camp.
---
But yeah, the interface still kinda sucks, but less then it did before.
---
But... I don't wanna fight people
---
One wasteland should of gave us at least one special and perk change up
---
The glitch is that you get it back to normal range after you switch servers. It should stay at low range after you switch
---
He hadn't been subjected to pointless monologue enough about "it's not *real* fallout, and "stop liking what I don't like", to know better yet.
---
It was endearingly naive on OP's part.
---
I’ve never posted about it before.  Straw man trolls are boring
---
I think this is the right way to to approach it. Help people to develop their own play style.
---
For example pre-patch I went dual build, heavy guns and commando. Anyone reading that would be like that is crazy and a waste of perks, they are right. I removed almost all quality of life perks, except Bear Arms and Traveling Pharmacy. I could do a silo, scorched earth, a colossal problem, rad rumble, etc.
---
Now it is a balance. Blocker, Serendipity, Ricochet, and Dodger just to name a few. They have a place and helped before but you could get by without them.
---
I can’t wait! I need the mask and outfit ASAP!
---
I want the issues that bled over from fo4 to be fixed &amp; the pay to play properly system removed
---
Kind of? Im a power armor build and every time i try to use it in my power armor its like nope.
---
Medics shotgun is nice
---
An event of that scale in the Mire could make use of the lake at Thunder Mountain. Dropping a nuke there would temporarily drain the lake and trigger the boss encounter. The boss might have to be a semiaquatic creature like an enormous Angler, Gulper or Gatorclaw, maybe even with more Vault 94 lore.
---
You should try it some time. But make sure you’re packing commando/heavy guns - PvP is all about DPS. Once upon a time, before the damage cap, you could one shot the dude from a distance with a sniper rifle. Now it’s devolved into a close quarters war zone dominated at the higher levels by stealth boys, legacies and Nuka Cola Quantums.
---
Do events for more levels get more perk cards and swap around your special stats. Look up some builds if you have just tossed perks and points everywhere.
---
Get a legendary perk.
---
I know it's the attitude of the current times, but beyond giving you an online multiplayer Fallout experience, they don't owe you anything. Everything else is to just *keep* people playing. Two things matter to Bethesda, money and their reputation - every decision they make is to maintain and increase these, in a balancing act quite often. To think any developer *owes* their customers constant improvements and fixes to the game would be a slippery slope.
---
Strange it seems like the type of thing to have one determined reset time, thanks though.
---
Hey smart ass they deserve the criticism. This game is in terrible shape two years after release. I just dropped a nuke on WS and half the plants didnt flux half the enemies didnt mutate. It was a complete waste of 2 hrs.
---
There’s a sub for trading
---
Do events and start making a specific build if you haven't already.
---
It’s also just a upgraded nocturnal gun
---
If I ca do the same damage with a better fire rate and I can be 50meters away what's the point in using melee?
---
1 cap.
---
This sub isnt used for trading.
---
haven't found a work around, but if you are trying to fast travel open pipboy then hit map button.
---
Trade only. That is one of the absolute best miniguns there are.
---
Try r/fo76filthycasuals probably the most drama free 76 sub
---
I've had it happen a few times. Think changing servers will work. But I've just let it ay threw both times its happened since I was doing something lol. It's annoying for sure
---
Every death was scary af. As a hoarder with no stash space, I'd often be carrying junk and praying to the gods something didn't kill me. Now the enemies are stronger, I'm dying more (often getting 1-shot even by poisonous radtoads!) but don't mind the deaths now that I know my junk is safer!
---
Time to make a full set of every build with ultra light mods so I can fit them in my stash.
---
They owe all of us who paid for this game a working bug free experience. If you don’t think so then you’re exactly the kind of sucker they hope buys theirs products.
---
I already started going for an auto rifle build, but the grind is kind of boring when it's just "kill this and this with a bit of radio dialogue and hope you level up"
---
I was at like 6:30 with one stranger
---
I use batteries included for energy weapon ammo anyway, so fc weight isn't a problem
---
It's fun and it's new with every new encounter.  Low level pvp is my fav.
---
Thank you kind stranger your a nice person hope you have a good day
---
Embrace the grind. It gives you something to work toward that's not at the mercy of RNG.
---
this is what i got 9 purified water and 30 5mm
---
What why would you think that. Obviously EAs work /s
---
🤣😂
---
that has to be an error right?  like some one at bethesda messed up an input?
---
makes no sense
---
It resets at 1pm EST, but they’ve said they are gonna do a fix on Tuesday (iirc) and put it back to noon like daily challenges
---
For me it’s none of that stuff, I don’t think anything is more fallout than a vault experiment that puts dweller vs dweller.  
---
As a mode i just find it not fun for the reasons i stated. I’d rather them not release more limited rewards. But if they, did i’d either grin and bear it as i have or understand i’m not entitled to everything
---
Wait the rusty pick has a basement? or are we talking about her old shop?
---
Had a fight with a 3 star legendary mirelurk queen. Fuck man, I was running around loke crazy and firing back just wishing it would die. It killed me 1 time, then I started firing at her feet, and it Dropped on the floor helpessly. I start screaminh at the screen charging towards her and fired in her face. Then it finally died.  (ノಠ益ಠ)√
---
Valid, i think its easier for me a bloodied build to damage the imposter i can visibly see chunks fall where on the queen its just a smidge with my heavy 
---
But like i was saying the queen and early is just a fight where encrypted and project have tasks to do which are kind of different events in my eyes
---
Id like a monstrous mole miner in ash and like wretched radscorpion or gargantuan yao guai things like that where theyre giant versions with spawns well i guess after saying that encrypted is kinda like that
---
As a pure tank PA Heavy... man, I have never had so much fun. I’ve started tweaking a handful of card choices to maximize my cores a bit more, because I am using a small amount more charge per kill. I also maxed out Ammo Factory, however, so I’ve far more than offset that cost.
---
My only downsides so far are that moving points to alter builds now feels like a punishment with the loss of perk coins, and on top of that, I now need to move points to Int to add Batteries Included for carrying the extra cores I need for the buffed up enemies. Super minor issue, easily solved.
---
Functional, absolutely - bug free? I think having minor bugs is to be expected unfortunately, but that still doesn't change the fact that actual content/gameplay updates aren't owed.
---
Hello Jon! I’m the friend of msscahlett, will be awesome if you join us, I don’t speak English pretty well and sometimes have some hard times trying to understand but, if you don’t mind, will be a pleasure! My nickname is pretty similar to my name here in reddit (*I just don’t remember the rest and I’m are not in home*). I like a lot playing and help people, me, msscahlett and a newer friend have created C.A.M.P’s near Flatwoods, I doing a “*New Responders*” camp type, design for help people. Later my fiancée will play with us. I don’t know, if you guys want we can all make C.A.M.P’s together. Even if we can't play on the same team, we can play on the same server (*with 8 we can close a private server, we have Fallout 1st*), I know that my fiancée will probably use the “New Responders” theme in her C.A.M.P, but what I think truly nice is give the regions a feeling of re-growth.
---
What? They're just the extreme side that's super lenient on Bethesda.
---
Hmm, having tested it, that seems to be the case for me too. Must be a bug! Thanks
---
I think the 50 was more than enough. I had so many unopen perk packs from the last season and from leveling up. You get a ton of coins for scrapping those. I've only unlocked 5 slots so far and all but one is fully upgraded.
---
Offensive?  Sorry.
---
Definitely not trying to be, maybe a bit frustrated and defensive without realizing it but not trying to get into fights with people.
---
Cheers.
---
I'm surpised the weight of irony behind posting about desperation in a forum for a 2+ year game you don't play , didn't crush your typing finger.
---
First of, you get downvoted because you are a salty complainer, In your 30+ years of playing mmos you should really know better that post where you just vent/rant/complain get downvoted to hell.
---
Also why should the game or beth compensate you for a mistake you made?
---
It is really on you to know what gear you use and how to use it best.
---
You selling the shotgun before you checked your new loadout, well that blame is on you, too. 
---
As one oldtimer to another, I don't know about you, but I'd never sell/trash my old gear until the new one is better. And in fo76 you keep enough points in reserve to undo the perk changes, or even to respec if needed.
---
Hell nah I'd be salty if they added them and just handed us all the coins we need. Earn that shit, don't ask for handouts
---
And all I've got from daily ops is the caged lights everyday.....
---
And when you do make them lock diseases or change the description
---
It’s way to good to share with like of a momma’s boy that you are.

I've also noticed that sometimes enemy health bars register zero, then jump back up to their actual length. I was popping Super Mutants in short bursts with my LMG and everytime it looks like they died the health meter jumps back up. I don't know what to make of that. But the short bursts are saving ammo.
---
my crossbow very rarely drops crossbow bolts, i get arrows, plasma cartridges even EC2 but almost never crossbow bolts.  which is weird because even in the non "rigged" content when i kill something more often than not it has at least 1 crossbow bolt.
---
On the original one from the non-daily op burrows mission?
---
Horrible take, IMO. 
---
People have every right to be vocal when it comes to horrible business practices. If you don't like seeing other people's complaints, maybe get of the subreddit. Simple.
---
I just tried playing the Uplink Daily Ops for the first time. I did it solo. What a waste of time. Countless freezing enemies constantly on your arse and then you have to face down a 100 level mini-boss who brings another gang with him. It basically stripped me of all my ammo and stimpacks and in the end I just gave up.
---
Might be fun for a team but as a solo player I just found it an annoying grind. And we're meant to do this every day?
---
Completely unbalanced. And EVERY enemy in the Forest is a 50??
---
The game lurched from pretty easy to ridiculously hard.
---
Well thats the thing, i deleted my other generators so i could build these, since they did 12 power instead of 3.
---
I played 76. Is it as horrible as it was made out to be? No. Definitely some enjoyable content. Plenty of hours of play time.
---
But it's not the Fallout multiplayer I wanted. I don't believe it's the multiplayer the community wanted in general.
---
I mean bugs aside the thing that got me was how absolutely some things make no sense immersion wise. But for the sake of competitive and ever evolving game play they had to implement the mechanics.
---
For instance. How the fuck do I lose carry weight capacity by getting *into* a suit of power armor?
---
Or why isn't it feasible to play the game in a way that isn't centered around the most maximized and optimal build. Because literally 85%+ of people I met were running some sort of Bloodied Commando or Bloodied Heavy Gunner build. With the only exceptions being low level players, and people who enjoy melee damage.
---
Point is. This game will never be what a lot of people want it to be because it isn't the Fallout Multiplayer experience we all fantasized about when first playing Fallout 3 or New Vegas.
---
What we should have got was a Fallout game with the option to invite your friend(s) as a follower(s) of sorts. Something similar to how Borderlands handles multiplayer. Or how Diablo handles multiplayer.
---
Not this whack world where casual players have to play at the same rate no lifers do in order to actually feel like they are part of what's happening.
---
They said we weren't getting an MMO. But that is a lie. It's exactly an MMO. They just said that to take your attention away from the fact the game servers probably couldn't handle more than 24 people. But mechanically it's an MMO. It loots like an MMO, it ques like an MMO, it's PVP is like that of other MMO's. At some point the fanbase has to swallow their pride and admit they bought, and are continually playing a Fallout MMO.
---
If you enjoy 76 and want to play it/pay for it. Fine. No harm in it as long as you are actually having fun doing what you are doing.
---
I'm not going to complain because your wallets are funding future Bethesda titles that have the potential to fulfill some of the more reasonable requests the community would like to see in future titles.
---
Such as a simple multiplayer option where you can simply toggle friendly fire on or off. Or you can give your invited friend specific permissions like the ability to receive/turn in quests or loot bodies.
---
It didn't need to be as complicated as they made it.
---
They’re owed if they say they’re part of what you bought. In this case all dlc and content is free per Bethesda. So...... they owe.
---
The bitching is because people want the game to be better than it is.  They expect more from Bethesda and Bethesda doesn't deliver.  I agree the damage rebalancing was needed and will likely be tweaked as time goes on, but people have every right to complain about how their characters feel different.  Why do you seem so offended by other people's displeasure of the game?  Why not just play it and ignore what other people think?
---
Seconded. Gear is way better.
---
It makes sense, as I see it. Score starts at noon, give people a chance to do that instead, then daily ops.
---
Instead of having it all piled on at once.
---
I have gripes but none are listed at the top. My biggest gripe is CAMP mode limitations that fallout 4 never had.
---
There is mole tunnels related content coming. I know I read that in a ITV or something.
---
Also strange that the time gets posted a lot and people keep missing it.
---
That wasn’t my experience. One had two open doors on either end the mutants would stand outside of, where I couldn’t deal with them without moving away from the link, and the other was in the middle of the room at the bottom, where I got pelted from above.
---
The trade off is the Gatling requires more resources and inventory management to be able to use it. Granted 5mm isn't hard to get but it is what it is.
---
I know 😭
---
You as well. Best of luck.
---
This is awesome thank you so much for this post!
---
press strg/ctrl when scrolling .)
---
Ok dumbass lol
---
Worth it all the way. Class Freak doesn’t work on it though, but with how fast the food and drink *already* drains it’s not that big an issue if you think about it really.
---
I'm out of ideas on that one then
---
They want to but Fo76 will self implode if limits are removed.
---
Some people just like to piss and moan no matter what the circumstances. It's annoying.
---
The gold's rewards are a joke, 50, 100 gold? You can't buy nothing with it.  They should give at least 500.
---
Also the 2500 caps.
---
PSA: If you don't want to see posts of this nature, stop browsing the subreddit that's basically dedicated to bug reports and venting. Go to happy fun land r/fo76filthycasuals instead for memes, achievements and posts about builds. 
---
There's a sub for everyone. I guess this one's just not for you.
---
Build a base, grind rep, and pvp
---
People who complain about complainers are usually top tier hypocrites.
---
Much of what he listed are legit concerns. Yes, it’s a business, I’m a 1st member &amp; buy stuff from the Atom Shop weekly to support the game in fact, but if you disregard too much of your user base you will have a dead game. 
---
This is the first Fallout game with an online community, and you need to work towards pleasing the biggest % of players.
---
Sounds like crash bandicoot is more your difficulty. Sick of all the whiny posts this week.  I dare you to take doom eternal for a spin then come back here and try saying this game is challenging. People over in the r/doom community welcome challenge I.e two mauraders instead of one, most here seem to cower at the fact of anything slightly challenging. Get a build as it's clearly the issue. What a joke your replies are to some folks on here that are trying to help you.
---
I’d suggest removing points from int as you increase the legendary perks and add them to agility
---
Drop out enforcer if you aren’t running shotguns 
---
If you aren’t in PA you don’t need stabilized , if you are in PA get electric absorbsion I’d also consider getting take one for the team  and drop lone wanderer for team orientated perks (inspirational , strange in numbers) plus add herd mentality and empath then join casual teams.
---
I’ve been doing that and you rarely feel like you are in a team until you see the caps come in when people complete quests and the XP shoot up
---
That’s it for now I’m sure others have more ideas
---
I miss survival! No fast travel added that extra challenge.
---
Just got one Tuesday when I did the regular mission on accident trying to start the Daily Op.
---
I'm pretty sure the cover system was a mod, Bethesda themselves never added such a feature.
---
Not much change with mid tier critters (100 level SM, etc.), but some of the big guys (leg scorch beasts, legendary mirelurk queens) definitely take more effort. I used some of my legendary perks to add tenderizer, I'm interested to see if it makes any difference.
---
Yup it has a basement and small tunnel too
---
Level 196 and TIL that you can *sleep* some diseases away in this game.
---
btw: wish we could do this in real life  :/
---
They try to focus more on enjoying the game than the problems. A lot of people get posts removed for complaining because that's not what the sub is. A lot of them don't like everything Bethesda has done but filthy casuals is not a place for that kind of thing. Its meant to be for light hearted and fun posts about the game content. Not how to fix the game, not how to grind. Just a silly picture of Mothman showing up to your camp and other similar casual things
---
&gt; Has anyone else had any issues?
---
Without the Sneak perk card enemies have been spotting me very quickly. Just getting the +25% card immediately made a noticeable difference in my stealth. Upgrading to a +50% card made an absurd difference and has led to a few funny moments where I turn around and discover a line of enemies that previously saw me walking behind me without noticing me at all.
---
Sure am. GT: dydamas
---
Much appreciated, but we are on PC.
---
I didn't say I wanted things easier.  I said I wanted them more fun, and that I hate bullet sponges.
---
There's a way to introduce better difficulty and balance without making bullet sponges:  THAT is the progress that pretty much every video game studio has been making across all platforms for the past decade.
---
I recently started playing Far Cry 5 for example.  Boy oh boy do I suck at it.  I die literally every four minutes.  That game is freaking HARD.
---
Danger is everywhere, sneaking is harder, clearing bases without setting off alarms is REALLY hard.  For me, almost impossible.
---
But damn is it ever fun.  And you know what?  I can 1-shot almost every enemy in that game.  My headshots are rewarded, my sneaking and sneak attacks are rewarded with the gratification of instant kills.
---
But my noob mistakes are also punished severely, and -get this- players aren't bullet sponges either.
---
Difficulty isn't a thing of the past.  Bullet sponges are.  They are almost universally hated for a reason.
---
You think that is because its in such a terrible state....
---
It is true, I have no love for nuclear winter. For me, combat is the most boring part of the game. However, I want all my 76ers to be happy, so give these folks some new maps and for the love of God find a way to get the cheaters out.
---
Yep sometimes people (mostly first timers) would start the event himself immediately and by the time others arrive, there’s not much on the timer left.
---
Strawman arguments classy, not everyone making an argument is the same people.
---
So, the game should be as bad as possible? Encouraging Bethesda's continual lies?
---
Just because they could have made loot boxes doesn't mean they are good for not doing so. Just not as bad as they could be. They've in total released less gameplay content than any previous of their Fallouts had by this time in the development cycle yet countless outfits cost as much or 1/2 as much as their dlcs. Yet they have a 13.99/month subscription service. And what, pray tell, dlcs have this gotten us? A handful of npcs and what 11 distinct quests from Wastelanders? After nearly a year and a half into the games release. Another two about the BoS that got compressed into one? No doubt cutting out what there original plan was since fractured steel was supposed to come out later and they have yet to release this sort of thing on time.
---
Bethesda is not an indie studio as you pointed out. They are a billion dollar company. If anything indies have a better excuse to charge subscriptions (patreons or what have you) because they don't have titles that sold millions of copies on every console of the last decade.
---
They're a business and what you're doing is telling them with your money, that you don't care how often they lie to you, how often they take away freedom of choice, how much money they can make off of the meagerest effort.
---
Honestly I'm still baffled that there are people like you going out to bat to defend a billion dollar company and saying that *they* need to make money, but indie startups don't? That is one of the most ass backwards arguments I have ever seen.
---
Edit: I have since stopped playing until actual content comes out, and I hate it when people virtue signal, by paying for a overtly greedy game who thinks they're helping out the little man. Has subscribing to 1st or buying 10+ dollar skins including ones that you may already owned from FO4 gotten you in this nearly two year development cycle the same amount of content you got for the same price in previous Fallouts? Wastelanders can really only compete with automatron and even that introduced a brand new system not in 76.
---
Yeah but now with leg perks you can make 450 or something for 40steel.
---
that's amazing! I have been singing the praises of electrical absorption but i have been waiting for the announcement that the healing was a bug...If it was intended, hell yes!
---
It is for an unyielding player use to lugging around 500lb :(
---
I think you have to know the windmill generator plan to build the water mill.
---
Ok then. That’s news to me, and now I wish I had one of my five characters who didn’t do this mission yet to confirm.
---
Personal preference. The increased functionality of perks like Blocker, since many ranged enemies switch to melee when you get close. 
---
Not all builds will rank the same as far as min/max effectiveness. If that’s important to you, cool. Find the build that suits your needs and use it.
---
But if all that mattered was ‘highest DPS’ then there would only be one or two weapons in the game. 
---
Find what works for what you want. Don’t lament that not all ‘tactics’ are equally effective.
---
Very annoying....lol. Thanks. Appreciate the response.
---
I had an autocomplete on my weekly 3 ops. I've only done ops twice and only finished the second one. Idk why that challenge completed but I'm not really gonna lose sleep over it tbh.
---
Yep, by choosing the right Armour you can get away from a lot of QOL perks
---
Got downvoted for that too goddamn haha
---
Thanks. Can not get it to stop without switching servers then it starts right back up after next accomplishment. Thankfully only have one more daily left...lol
---
Wait, you mean [this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iv90hs/how_do_i_get_the_fixer_plans/g5pqhz0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)
---
Worry about this a couple weeks before the end of it.
---
Along with above, last season you could compare your board piece characters progress against the enemy's board piece. Unsure what the board is like this season if we have an enemy player havnt checked it out.
---
I think that a lot of people dont know the difference between bitching and criticism. Criticism is intended to improve,  bitching is just whining without alternatives. This post is pretty well thought out and telling some people to "find another game" might actually be good advice considering how much headspace it's taking up. Take my updoot, you have made many valid points, sir/maam/Z
---
The game everyone hates! But they are divided in their hate!
---
If they promise to support a game for X years with content updates, in that sense yes - but the actual quality of that content, or what the community wants to see, isn't owed. I think we're largely on the same page, but they could release one normal patch sized update a year and still be honouring their word technically. It's good to have higher standards to hold them accountable of course, but to say they "owe" you everything they put it is just blatantly false.
---
I have had times where it only ran through all my levels once and others where it just kept going through all of them over and over it was.. just awful..
---
I have the same bug. Screen shows a brown box where a reward should be and goes from 1 to my current rank. Nothing prevents it once it starts.
---
yeah that's a thing that can happen.
---
The tick has been a thing for at least as long as the game has been on game pass (when I started).
---
Batteries included is your friend
---
I’m hopin to get the plans for the BOS suit &amp; helmet jammy by the end of the weekend.
---
I got Liquid Courage or something like that from one the other day,but I’ve no use for it...
---
Wish I woulda researched it before I “learned” the plan so I coulda sold it or gifted it to someone who would get use out of it...
---
Oh well,live &amp; learn.
---
Yeah I just think they’re fun, the rewards are a nice little bonus. I’d do them if they didn’t have rewards.
---
Hell yeah! Just got to claim it tomorrow then it’s drinking loads of dirty water and going hunting
---
Yeah it's a simple fix
---
I don’t think the rebalancing of thing did anything to help the game long term, I’d be leaning more in the opposite direction of that. Not because it didn’t make it more fun to some degree, though only marginally. The game needed a rebalance AND content. Not a daily ops system for a few measly plans. Earle still isn’t hard enough, even solo with a proper build. I haven’t tried the SQB, farmed her more times than I care to. Yes, I’m one of the players pissed about what they did to the game but not because of the player nerf and creature buff, just because of the constant lack of new content. I love the game but how many times can we repeat the bare minimum of vanilla content and the bit we’ve had after?
---
Level 100, 200, 300, burnout, break, 400, 500. Try different play styles, weapons, armor as you’ll have most perks maxed out (level 285 and am almost there).  Max out legendary perk cards, enjoy new content as it trickles in, become an engineer and build/rebuild camps, grind for plans, set up shop to sell whatever goods you choose, learn what sells through experience.  Do whatever really, it is an RPG.  Try a new game...I really should, but am still digging 76.
---
Had this happen two days ago and eventually it stopped after a few hours and went back to normal
---
Haha my drop is for the vault stash.... only plan received so far after numerous elder runs
---
Hold up, are you calling Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and the Ink Spots weak? I would’ve been so bummed if the songs of Fallout 3 weren’t included in FO4 and FO76, though would be happy to need to do a quest to unlock holotapes for 76.
---
Probably got rewards and is ammo grinding
---
Lol....my apologies then, friend.  It was honestly a tongue-in-cheek comment based off your header comment.  Here in America, It’s very....let’s say....if it looks like a duck, sounds like a duck....
---
And autocorrect has indeed spoiled us all.
---
Johnny Guitar was great, but on launch, I’m positive it played more often than any other song in that game. Still does but not as much.
---
What I'm saying is that if they are trying to balance the game then why make melee do near to no damage per enemy
---
I'd love to come through after work! Love a good escape room.
---
I enjoy the game plenty, I just also like to discuss the game on Reddit. I've been on that sub before, it's barely any different than the main sub, and it's just not my thing. It's just another extreme.
---
You may want to get the Grounded Mutation; adds 100 Energy Resist, at the cost of 50% reduction in energy damage.
---
You may want to consider switching to unarmed melee, only requires three perk points in Iron Fist, and frees up the rest of your strength points for Barbarian, Blocker, Martial Artist and Incisor.
---
That stupid bug prevented me from joining colossal problem event
---
As a level 47 with no specific build and whom only played casually, I think I'm done. It's not fun getting my ass kicked by molerats outside my house and then watch them destroy my house with my defenses trying to keep up. 
---
Yes, I'm aware I could grind for better and more specific weapons and gear but I can't really do much of anything by myself anymore. And when my friends and I play we have to dedicate the few hours we have to getting resources to fix our stuff or make ammo that we can't even go do the things we need to to actually get ahead. 
---
I'm glad everyone who has been glamoring for a more challenging endgame have received it, but for everyone sub 50 this just isn't even worth playing anymore and that's a real bummer.
---
Good point tbh.
---
The only issue with the damage rework is that it launched incomplete. There is a huge amount of tuning that still needs to be done. Looking at the Alien Blaster buff, they're not taking this seriously.
---
I hope it happens sooner, rather than later.
---
I just wanted the smoke machine... not all the other stuff
---
The daily deal that was 600 atoms
---
This is fantastic man. Thank you 👍
---
Awww maybe mom will kiss your boo boo and make it better
---
Like they're gonna be happy to see us after what we've been doing to them.
---
Ah ok. I only use PA when fighting the Queen so I wouldn't know.
---
while i don't necessarily disagree i think there are some weight management perks in Strength that are must haves.  i use all my other specials for build synergy (and change based on content/current weapon) but i have \~11 strength and most of it is QOL unless im fighting the queen then those all get swapped to heavy gunner.
---
Thanks for this!
---
Its trash, doesn't work half the time. An when it does even proc you have to be in a very specific situation where the small explosion would even hit. Angry turtles legendary perk breakdown shows this as not being worth it.
---
Excactly, and he shouldn't forget to start making a decent build and getting gear for the build
---
People saying pvp are full of shit lol
---
Don't scrip it. 
---
Keep it in your stash and keep asking for trades. You'll find somebody who wants it.
---
It ain't worthless. They were heavily duped so not worth quite as much as they used to be but it's a fair trade for another legacy.
---
I'd missed that info somehow, thank you !
---
That’s the one
---
Three different characters. I got the same reward each time from him. Other people may have different results.
---
Ya know, I’ve been trying to get an answer to that for a while. I have a hunch that she’s seen, heard and experienced shitbag players from other games and is just a bit gun shy. I keep telling her that I’ve never had a bad experience with FO76 players (maybe I’m lucky?) and we are of a different mentality in this game, but she still just doesn’t want to. And that’s okay. Myself, our son in law and my best friend join her on her private server and team up for whatever she needs.
---
Yes! 100% Yes! this need to be a thing.
---
I have batteries Inc, brandoiler, travelling pharmacy and thru hiker. But the fact my unyielding build allows me to lug 500lb around hopping in PA with shocks and dropping sub 400 is a real feelsbad moment. Excavator sort of helps.
---
We're discussing some different options for this. No concrete information to share just yet but its been brought up. :)
---
Its more so i feel the 3x sneak damage isnt calculating right. I stay in caution most easy though and i see the 3x succeed at the top left, but it seems just as much damage taken off if i wasnt sneeking.
---
This exchange gave me life
---
That really sucked, but gun bashing worked.  With the power armor recharge legendary perk, I could ignore the energy weapon robots and focus on the Gutsies and bash them for the final hit.
---
I don’t care about the size of the patch. I care that their shit works and gets maintained. Two things they’ve not been great at yet. And they owe me what I paid for. That’s what I said and that’s the fact.
---
I think this situation has to do with how common damage comes in at that character area and how enemies target you.If you don’t have lightfoot you set off all ground based trap damage.There are quite a few lower height based enemies attacking with melee in the game.Molerats and canines and rats etc etc.Many people use the hoppy hoppy tactic with marsupial.So when things with ranged weapons fire up at you they are hitting your legs first.Any kind of falling damage I would imagine is applied solely to the legs area.Ghouls I noticed natural swing low when they attack you.They also run and dive to attack which ends up with the swipe coming in at the end of the dive when they are near the ground.I think all that stuff just ends up adding up rather quickly.Also you stand taller in PA so I think even more attacks hit that region than on those not in PA.This is just my personal theory on this situation though.I have no actual data to back it up.

Hm, odd but if thats the case, then it would certainly explain it. Normally it gives a message saying you need a certain plan to build it though, or at least i think it does.
---
Give it a try. Been broken for a while.
---
A few guns work in vats like railway.
---
I'm running with full Commando perk cards, and my AAE Lever and my Junkies Lever action rifles still consistently two shot kill every normal enemy. (note, this is without any Rifleman cards equipped)
---
However... I am using the Junkies additions x5, VATS crits and Sneak modifiers. If that helps at all? (although the junkies wouldn't matter on the AAE)
---
Without knowing your current build, and I'm at work so I can't post mine... just tossing some ideas at you for thoughts. :)
---
edit for clarification: I really only use Commando and Auto rifles for "boss" fights and events.
---
Wow, thats a no brainer for me, at least I have to try it. Thanks so much!
---
ETA: thinking about the perk. Ill also think about unarmed, but I currently dont have the weapons...
---
Are you kidding they are making money even with the free atoms. $18 PA skins geez this comunity is delusional. Why dont you send Bill Gates some rent money this month or Elon Musk some free Tesla stock back so he can eat.
---
They fixed Line in the Sand, so that great xp farm is gone.
---
Make an alt :)
---
I got 100 flamer ammo and water. So nothing special.
---
I dont know why but I agree
---
We're talking about Tamed Pets. They're never level 100. Normally level like 20 something.
---
Try using the power armor and the ammo converter then you’ll see my pain.
---
This begs the question - why do they have QoL perks in the game if no one should use them?
---
Yes please. I power attack 90% of the time and I hate doing less damage just because I can't hit the molerat without vats (just an example.. I can hit molerats)
---
Ah ha! This is the 'catch' I was looking for, the wording Can be confusing &amp; I'd thought 2k bullion: the jetpack must be pre attached. So I have to buy both the chest parts? (Bc one is the actual mod?)
---
Yeah, I'm kind of afraid to take the plunge of changing my build from OP sneak/crits/vats/bloodied commando, but its so fun, I think I'll go for it.
---
Get rid of damage cards. Get limb damage cards. ?????. Profit.
---
Same. It’s amazing how many people only play games for “rewards”. That’s never been a thing for me.
---
Tell me about it. I got 4 plans 3 of them being the outfit and one being liquid courage so I feel your pain lol
---
You’re at 0 votes from what I see. Which means one person downvoted you. There are random people that cruise through and downvote lots of comments just for ‘the lulz’. Doesn’t mean you were *targeted* for what you said.

One downvote isn’t anything to even complain about, friend. You’re not being persecuted.
---
Celebrate your special day! When one of my friends hit level 200 we had an impromptu party at someone's cafe themes camp in the forest, we all got dressed up, wore our hats and had a little party! The guy who's camo it was probably didn't know what was going on, some 8 odd characters sat at his table on party chat lol. Probably my favourite moment in the game
---
New players are having a harder time because the enemies level with them and stimpaks/ammo are too rare in the wild. Players who have been here for a while don't have those challenges.
---
As someone who loves the fallout franchise ( I have a main that is over lvl 300) I did just this.  I haven't played 76 in a few months.  I keep up with the updates and reddit, but I haven't been playing.  I will simply play other games till I feel like it has been fixed.  No need to get all crazy and induce undue stress on yourself.  I found that I really a game called Subnautica, similar enough to a lot of fun different enough to not really be the same kind of game.
---
what they said.  :)
---
Because a lot of players are entitled and lazy people.
---
&gt; What is the benefit of playing that way?
---
Maybe they just want to play, idk.
---
Isnt that the definition of P2W? In game benefits?
---
Excavator makes adds 100 more
---
From my testing; all i was able to achieve taking 3 strength % food (carnivore &amp; Strange in numbers) and fury was only about 150 more damage.
---
This was a bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet (Full unyielding) that i was averaging little more then 350+. I got to roughly 500 damage taking the buffs mentioned above.
---
The 4 buffs listed above should have theoretically increased my damage By 105% (3 x 25% + 30%). As of now now its only granting me barely half of that.
---
For comparison my bloodied DC gauntlet was averaging 1800 damage (no strength consumables) before nerfs. A non legendary DC gauntlet (before nerfs) would let me deal roughly 800 damage (on pip boy).
---
I’m about to trade my same prefix mini but a bloodied one for a fireman and helmet outfit so I guess let that show how much they’re worth
---
Thanks for mentioning that, I didn't realise the 2mm EC was included 👍
---
Some people in this game have gotten used to the game difficulty being that of an hello kitty island adventure, where you can put on some fancy pink suit and throw sticks at enemies and watch then die. They don't know how or want to change that.
---
Limb damage bonuses adds exactly 0 dps.
---
Ammo factory, to counter the sponginess.
---
it's fucking constant.
---
I thought it was 1850 last time? 9 cases of 150 followed by a 500
---
Same, this may be some weird network bug, I'll keep trying.
---
Yeah absolutely! You'll need to grab a bunch of pumpkins though from pumpkin house! I'll probably be on in a few hours, my GT is Badgerist
---
I’m pretty sure nuke silo instances last for a decentralized amount of time before they reset. I have left a silo and returned bc my dumbass forgot a nuke keycard, while my friend stayed in there. Upon returning, the countdown quest  re-added and was on the step that I left on. I’m sure it works the same when your alone. If it doesn’t, then that feature should be added.
---
I adore Julia but the fact that shes like 10 voice lines ruins it fast.
---
Different companies. One might know better than the other for what their games need.
---
That’s patently false. I’m not running a Bloodied build on my main and can still one shot most weaker enemies. Yes, it’s an Instigating piercing Croquet Mallet, but that means it’s *intended* for that purpose.
---
To each their own. You could try a discord
---
Wow... maybe I need to unequip all and requip all..
---
I had Gunfu fail for most of the day.. fixed by un- re- equip.
---
Also got 4 ultra lite fusion cores.  Only had used my ultralite laser for like 2 minutes too, and still got rewarded them.  Not sure how the game determines what to drop based on usage?
---
are names case sensitive? I have mine CamelCased
---
I got 5mm and water. Figured it would be better
---
Some people sandbox.   They are a trader walking from town to town, or they are a hunter with specific weapons,etc.  They role play in a game that allows you to be and look however you want. 
---
Some people like to be challenged,  some like to be able to relax and just be and play with their friends,  quest, but not be stressed while they do it.
---
Not everyone wants to be the ultra ray gun mega weapon all the same guns, same perks type. If everyone HAS to use the same range of perks and weapons to play.... whats the point of having all the rest?
---
West tek is still hear though.
---
The backpack quests, Wasted on Nukashine, Sheepsquatch, ally quests, lots of stuff you might have not done yet.
---
 I mean yeah - a lot of quests are going to be the go and kill variety, but thats a lot of gaming for you.
---
If it's broken, and from what I've googled it's not a feature it is a bug. Why take away functionality on a bug.
---
Playing that way is perfectly fine. 
---
*Complaining* that you’re not doing as much damage as a more optimized build is the illogical part.
---
Julie is the manifestation of Bethesda corporate management doing the “Hello, fellow kids” meme.
---
Also, she sucks.
---
They are fine pre-50 when you're dealing with scarcity but by the time you're in the endgame content you need damage and survivability.
---
It was a hidden feature that was never really discussed. It only worked in first person. The third person one is a mod.
---
Tbh, shotgun ammo is so common I’d happily donate some if you needed it.  Never had to craft it.  I’ll take your 5.56 off your hands too ;)
---
The enemies used to be higher level than you if a high level character was also in the area. So now if you are level 30 you’ll find level 30 enemies. Before you’d find higher level enemies in many areas. The challenge is different but not more difficult.
---
I have one but I use him as a mule, don’t think I can grind the tadpole challenges and that rep over again
---
I already did
---
You're not reading what I'm saying dude.  My point isn't that I have a stockpile of scrap.  it's that the SCRAPPER PERK allowed me to amass that scrap.  I put that 4k together in TWO DAYS.  I can absolutely get that much steel again, and again, and again.  Fallout 1st doesn't affect how much scrap I get from weapons.
---
Legendary perks are gained at 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, and 300.  Look it up.
---
And considering I can still wreck enemies in a few shots, I can absolutely carry people MY OWN LEVEL.  Your points don't hold up.
---
Because not everyone is a min/maxer.
---
These perks are legendary for a reason. This *should* take a while to max out.
---
However! For anyone else reading this thread, playing on PC, I’ve usually got a metric fuck-ton of ammo and stimpacks lying around. Gladly willing to give them to players in need, if our paths happen to cross in the wasteland. Just because wife doesn’t do public, doesn’t mean I don’t! How else would I sell shit with my player vendor? Bethesda gamer tag; Fission-Chips
---
Than you sir are the exception. Drive around your town and see how many places are staying closed and going out of buisness. None in my area hell resturants have opened dining rooms back up. Just left a wendys with 30 people inside eating with the mask down. The exception. Hell my co-worker just had an elective surgery she waited 2 extra months for because they are back in full swing.
---
As a lower level player, I had to adjust my tactics and rearrange what few perks I had to make traveling the wasteland alone a little more bearable. I think some of the things about the patch make it more difficult for us lower level folks to manage, but you gotta take your lumps.
---
Now I just need a crew to play with.
---
Its about finding a decent balance in qol and dmg, some people get a little too heavy on qol.
---
Some also use situational perks outside of their useful area, like having super duper or ammo smith on while exploring.
---
I have 90% reduced food/drink/chems/junk/ballistic ammo and 60% RW weapons. And a fair few other qol perks, and can still one to three tap almost all normal mobs on the map.
---
Some are useful when you are low level , but after 10 levels would you really use woodchucker!
---
Then There’s stuff like butchers bounty or green fingers that you can use but don’t need all the time..
---
Just look at how many perks people got rid of for the perk coins...
---
Folks had been saying the way it was coded meant it looked intentional and it was subsequently confirmed by Bethesda that it is intended but the card description doesn't include the effect.
---
it just doesn't feel good
---
heh, you got a point there.
---
&gt; if you're going to complain about everything Bethesda does, maybe find a different game. 
---
This is exactly what I'm going to do https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iuudmg/since_a_lot_of_people_ask_why_players_are_unhappy/
---
Running those pieces with the other new melee perks could be a ton of fun!
---
I feel like some of the rare rewards should be old vault raid loot, not useless camp cosmetics. Just my opinion.
---
No problem. I use to never carry it being it weighed so much and would only carry two fusion cores. I’ve played since beta and still finding new things out. But batteries included is a life saver I mean I literally have so much of the heaviest ammo and it doesn’t go up much. I got rid of a lot of it so I could use nerd rage and then when legendary perks came out I added intelligence for a legendary perk so I can have that on again. And now I can finally use the god roll gauss minis I have. I have a anti armor and a vampires that I would’ve never used until now. And crafting ammo is so easy. But I have my ammo legendary perk maxed out and I use super duper maxed and ammosmith maxed. So awesome. But you’re welcome enjoy the many rounds you will have
---
Dude I love the survival chem perk and think it’s completely underrated! It allowed me to dump all my food and drinks, no more diseases, got rid of thru hiker, and freed up camp budget by eliminating my farm! HUGE!!
---
But it keep things from swarming you.
---
I'm actually shocked that there isn't some kind of local chat available outside of proximity audio on PC. This feels like a basic function of any online/multiplayer game.
---
Considering how one could be perfectly fine doing 2000 damage hits just a couple weeks ago, without being a min/maxer, it seems reasonable to complain a little about having to mess with a build you liked just because people now have to have specific builds to be nearly as efficient.
---
I thought if I was on my own and left then I couldn’t get back in. Unless I put the nuke card in. Only asking as I see someone launch then as soon as the sbq is done they launch again  literally in minutes. Don’t want to waste a nuke card trying it.
---
It’s like 45 minutes for a reset right? Asking for myself here.
---
The glitched low range is a distance of "1". You literally have to press the end of the nozzle against a bad guy's forehead in order to register hits. You are telling me this is **on purpose** ?
---
Have you *tried* the Flamer at all recently?
---
Same here. Some enemies take the same number of hits. Some enemies take 1 or two more hits. Some enemies take twice as many hits. 
---
But I'm getting more XP for the kills, and between the Ammo Converter, the Ammosmith Perk, and the Ammo Factory Legendary Perk, ammunition will never be an issue ever again. 
---
So what exactly is the downside here?
---
Yep there is Latency in the Hits.  Add or MultiCap our old girl can't handle DMG Calc that well...
---
Most of the reason for non optimized build is to switch through multiple play styles I run a sniper build outside and while inside my build lends to better shotgun performance. While playing with others I have a few spots saved so I can share increased experience with my team. 
---
This, too me is an optimal build that allowed me to play how I wanted. Not how everyone else wants me to.
---
And it keeps you from getting mobbed and wasting ammo. Damage cards as an additive and not multiplicative don’t really help as much as it used to. We limb damage meta now.
---
Wait you can change your psn name now?
---
Then how do I have 4? I’m only 117 or something like that.
---
Yes but what about supermutants? Most other things can get 1tapped with a stick
---
Ohio and I travel weekly to Illinois and Indiana where everything is open and moving. Hell kids are back to classrooms in Ohio
---
Shhh...you never talk about things that are going well...it’s bad luck lol
---
Her legs were amputated above the knees. Does she have an ass to be chafed?
---
I have a pretty standard bloodied sneak commando build. before patch 22, I could one tap super mutants in west tek. now it takes 6 rounds on average to finish them off.
---
that's 6 times as many shots. and I'm using pretty much every damage bonus available to me, minus temporary ones like chems. now imagine what's it's like to someone who doesn't minmax.
---
for awhile now
---
no, joining u
---
The new business model for Bethesda is to monetize the haters.   Buy the games and get years of fun bitching about it.
---
I’d like the be able to find her in my gauss rifle sights
---
Yes I have, and no you do not need to be that close. You can be within a few feet and it will still hit them. If it wasn’t intended then the actual range stat on the weapon card wouldn’t go down when you put the nozzle on
---
You could also drop 1 point from all the HG perks and add blocker.
---
Blocker, Dodgy and Ricochet are often overlooked and they get rid of a lot of incoming damage.  Add them walk into Westek and let the muties use you as a piñata until you get bored :)
---
Honestly I love the survival chem perk and think it’s completely underrated! It allowed me to dump all my food and drinks, no more diseases, got rid of thru hiker, and freed up camp budget by eliminating my farm! HUGE!!
---
Farming Tick Blood is more challenging now but doable. There are regular spawn areas for ticks, and Tea Time and Campfire Tales are great sources for extras. Add in Chemist &amp; Super Duper and you can still generate a lot of Stimpaks. Perhaps the drop chance for Tick Blood could be increased a little to balance it out, though. 
---
As for ammo farming, we have the converter *(I know, it is subpar in its current version)*, the ArmCo from the Raiders, but also some great places to gather lead. 
---
Yesterday morning I spent 30 minutes and generated 9600 5.56 rounds.
---
On the up side 5mm Ultracite is dropping like it were Christmas.
---
You don't have to have the same exact stuff. But you can't expect to be able to not take damage cards and do good damage
---
Something is incredibly wrong with your build if it takes 150 rounds per super mutant. What is your perk loadout and what weapons? You should be able to dispatch them with about 5-10 rounds.
---
I have been preaching the legendary ammo perk. I have that maxed out and I can carry and make so much. I will never ever worry about ammo. So I’m ready to show the wasteland what I’m all about. Lol
---
I think people get confused between a optimized build and a min max build. 
---
You can still role play and use whatever weapon you want but you have to put more thought in how you are going to run it.
---
I thought it was longer. Lol I do 3 at night and then log off after.
---
I wear a field scribe hat with mine.
---
I feel like 300 to max out fully would be more in line with reality, but I didn’t expect a community organizer to hit me with the “I’ll mention this in the next meeting”.  As I said entitled to the max (I’m ~245)
---
I like this buff and what it done to the game but I hope the next step is reworking gear/weapon to more of an mmo-lite thing.. 
---
This game need gearset bonus and quality like NW and Repairing need to be better... repairing my gun every hour is a bit too much
---
Exactly, you have worked out/summed up why they did it right there...
---
Yea but do people having a scrapbox and a tent make the game harder for other players? Can you still play the game without it? It's not like it's a huge advantage over non 1sters it's littlery just an infinite scrap storage
---
Edit: did I say it wasn't a p2w advantage?
---
Doing 2k per hit was almost always overkill except for the toughest enemies. And JuiceHead has a recent video that shows the need is not as extreme as it was in the PTS.
---
Some reasources you might find helpful.

That does suck. I haven't tried my stealth class but honestly I quit playing it because it seems like ever patch breaks stealth which is unfortunate. I hope they fix it for you.
---
Say, this wouldn't happen to be your ship, would it? 
---
Because you walked in it like it was your ship. 
---
And if this ship is yours, well, you owe Spacer's Choice a hefty fine.

Afraid we have to dock your pay.

bethesda is doing a-ok with this game.. it needs some improvements and quality of life fixes but 76 I believe is a game worthy of spending ones time on
---
when you die it's not your junk anymore...
---
I've gotten two War Glaives plans now so I'd really like it for them to either be tradeable or not possible as another drop for the same character.
---
I want a proper fish tank. Fish lamps belong to r/shittyaquariums
---
May I ask what do you use each of your heavies and shotgun for? Might be able to tweak a little based on your play style. Also like others say, remove the adamant skeleton and lone wanderer, get strange in numbers and inspirational, these 2 are awesome perks to have. For legendary perk the firework isn’t as useful for now so I’ll hold off it until more good reviews come in.
---
For real though
---
Fun fact: one wasteland and legendary perk were base off ESO’s one Tamriel and champions point system..
---
Found a level 100 Legendary Deathclaw, engaged battle! An acid Floater nearby helped me kill it only for the body to vanish. Dunno if it fell thru the floor or pinged off into space. Fast traveling back didn't spawn it back and my trusty camera couldn't find it. Hmph.
---
Anyone mind clarifying “Legacy” weapons please? Are these pre some nerf weapons? I see it mentioned a lot and I am new to trade. Thanks!
---
Why should Super Mutants, which are supposed to be one of the toughest standard enemies of the game, be easily one-shot?
---
^This, so quit crying.
---
I DID lose a bunch of perks from not knowing about the duplicate card glitch, but that’s my own ignorant fault.  I had plenty of cards to burn.  I just think 500ish is wild.  300 feels less like a sin, but I know they want this game to last years
---
They owe you the game you bought and literally nothing else. Unless you’re paying a subscription fee I guess...
---
nope, its preset and shit, could you imagine a vampire ontop of gutter
---
Out of all of them, this is at the bottom/ ear the bottom
---
Range still lists as 128 using a Vaporization Nozzle at a minimum, higher if you've got the Long Barrel equipped. When *mine* glitches out, I've got to be within half-melee range in order to get hits to register. I literally could smack targets with the nozzle.
---
Also this was **FIXED** once by Bethesda for about a month before it was rebroken again. They declared it a fix, stating the glitched range and increased durability damage was **not** intentional.
---
Must be nice for you to have a special Flamer that doesn't glitch, I guess.
---
I guess that's why I haven't had these issues that folks posted. I don't play this like CoD. I guess as I've gotten older I'm more cautious when playing.
---
I do not use any weapon/armor perks. I have 120+ perk picks but only use QOL cards so I have yet to have a reason to cash them in. 
---
Since the update I have had no trouble in any area I have entered and usually play solo. I live in the mire and love my walk from Freddy’s down to Watoga. I do team up for the daily op as it is a pain to try and solo it, IMO, not that it can’t be done. 
---
I’m level 270 with 300 def and use mainly melee weapons, except for the Queen where I use a hunters Gatling plasma gun but may go back to melee since she once again lands. 
---
I find the game fun and challenging once again with the latest update. No longer is it a boring trudge. So no...you don’t need to use perk cards to have fun.
---
Yes but I also have legendary ammo maxed out. I get so much ammo for a little bit of junk. So here’s a example. Before patch with ammo perk maxed I could change my plasma cores to ult cores 3 for 2 plasma. And then super duper would give me more. But now with legendary perk I get 9 without super duper. I had ten plasma cores last night I changed to ult and walked away with 50. I crafted 2500 2mm with only like 40 or 50 lead and steel. I love that perk but yes the ammo from ops is nice also
---
Sad news. My favorite server event. Blowing up stuff and running around spray painting was so much fun. I don't remember having any issues but it did seem to lag things a bit.
---
I hope what they replace it with is fun but I'm not optimistic.
---
I’m ~245 with many respecs.  I’ll be over 500 before that happens.  I’m salty about that tbh, but that’s my own damn fault...
---
I have had this happen multiple times in daily ops, I didn't rationalise it to a weird bug with ranged melee attack, but what you describe is exactly what is happening to my character. Its caused me to die a couple of times as well, which is annoying
---
The experience is the best part. I still think the issue could be card selection for some and also I do think the stealth builds need to be buffed so that they do more damage. Lone wanderer is swear is a must for playing solo for being able to soak more damage.
---
Which was fine before as you could beef up to go to the right side of the map,  but just do whatever you want in the forest and left side of the map.
---
You could be the woodcutter or healer and not worry about needing much damage as long as you didn't stray over the border.
---
Now you sort of HAVE to beef up as even the scorched at cruise control that were level 1 are now level 50.  There isn't really a middle ground anymore.
---
Legacy weapons are weapons that no longer drop in game. Any energy weapon with explosive affects is a legacy because you can’t get in game anymore, only through trading.
---
I ain't got time to grind out 28000 levels
---
Out of curiosity, what makes you say it’s better than a super sledge?
---
Gonna have to do [better than that](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_fallacy)
---
I once launched a nuke after someone else had cleared the silo. I checked the holotape for the silos and it had a different status so i checked it out. I ran straight to the room waited a few minutes to see if anyone would come back, than I just launched the nuke. You should be able to get to the final stage where you enter the card/code and leave but someone else can come in and launch the nuke with their card.
---
WhY Is mY fIsT nOt sTrOnGeR ThAn A gUN???

On console but this should be added
---
You act like I lurk here, this just came across on popular, sorry if the shoe fits.
---
If you’re having trouble, or just want to min/max for a tough Op/Event, swap perks.
---
I swap a whole bunch of perks for Ops as a commando build.  I also built a suit of T-65 to avoid armor breakage, improve my DR and gain 42% damage reduction.
---
I'll be on later. :)
---
I hope they see this and fix it, for me it refreshes each rank I’ve unlocked over and over and if you hit the start button wanting to open the map you’ve played yourself and it opens the Game Board ☠️
---
“ ThEY DiDnT FoRCE YoU To BuY THe GaME” what an intellectually dishonest argument. No dumbass they didn’t force me to buy it. But they damn well owe everyone who did buy it a working big free and finished product.

---
Ive noticed im leveling a bit more faster now. May I mind you this is on my lvl 369 hesvy guns character.
---
How did you un-lock them?
---
I mean... Once someone gets to west tek they should have a firm grasp on their build.
---
If theyre having difficulty then they haven't optimized properly
---
And not every Three Dog can be a Mr New Vegas
---
That would kick ass tbh.
---
For those who use guns, I totally agree... ammo goes like wildfire and finding the right ones can be found hard to do.
---
It’s legit just a projectionist troll.  I don’t get it either.  This post is mostly total bs anyway.  I know we won’t get it and if we do it won’t be because of my crybaby post haha
---
NCR supports this message.
---
&gt;  ballistic weapons a buff
---
Why you didn't mention non-heavy energy guns? I would rather put non-heavy energy weapons first to be buffed. They are meh for far longer than currently ballistic weapons are right now. You don't see people using laser and plasma guns.
---
So we are gatekeeping who is allowed to complain now? Very heroic.
---
I will never give up my hundreds of nuka cola cherries. I need to keep running as long as the caps and ap keeps coming in.

My rare reward for completing daily ops

It's not complicated though.  Just take the damage perks, etc.  Is it really that hard?
---
Ok I will try that. I’m planning on doing it private so I won’t have worry about that but thanks.
---
Thats probably the worst advice I have heard today.
---
Thanks for effort tho.
---
They owe EVERYONE what they advertised which was a working bug free product with free content and dlc. The second part they changed and now it’s just free dlc which they have delivered. The first part why haven’t. Man you guys will shill for anything. Do you go to a restaurant and order a well done steak and get a raw one and just say “ well they delivered a steak “???!!!
---
Listen man.  You’re probably right.  I’m a victim of the internet age.  I want it now or within two business days (joking).

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

---
unfortunately, the solutions aren't equivalent.  before 1 tamriel, u couldn't visit any of the other factions (and all their related quests &amp; content) until u "beat the game."  nor could you squad up with your buddies to do dungeons in other factions' areas
---
  this was not the case w/ fo76; you could visit bog area level 2 if you were so inclined.  w/ the 1W update however, everywhere you go will be bog area
---
one of the challenges is to do a daily op....  this *forces* people to either just wait to get on, sign on twice, or play for over an hour everyday.  thats ridiculous for Bethesda to set it like that.
---
i guarantee it was a coding error
---
not necessarily. rifleman and gunslingers who didn't optimized the F out of their builds are gonna have a hard time regardless.
---
there are tons of things wrong with patch 22. I can see it pushing away a lot of more casual players.
---
I don't feel like playing with my commando anymore and he's not exactly weak. I can only imagine what it's like for food builds.
---
Julie new voice line "The insult bot has claimed another victim who will now stare at the mole rate infested ground and reflect on their wasteland choices."
---
What that sounds like to me is that the game got adjusted to be an experience closer to what a Fallout game should be like.
---
The majority of places are closed. Restaurants are takeout only. We are in the middle of a pandemic. 
---
Where do you live the we are 95% back to business as normal? There were 45k new covid cases yesterday in the USA.  Whatever your experience, that’s not what the rest of country and rest of the world are seeing.
---
Cities are not reopening, and certainly not 95% as you claim.
---
Must be I got valley galleria signs work just fine.
---
This is my most requested QOL item I need in my life and now I have to wait again smh.
---
Haha, that is pretty awesome. That camp owner guy probably still thinks about that. Would love for a random get together to happen at mine!
---
What's your gear and build? Asking Bethesda to balance the game around people that have the absolute best gear and legendary stats on their armor and weapons along with all the cheese perk combinations is just as much nonsense. Literally nothing has changed for the people that cheesed the game before to make it really easy while it has changed for most other players that don't have the luck of getting good legendaries or friends to feed them gear. That's the problem and if you can't see that then I don't know what to tell you.
---
The problems were not addressed and just created a bunch of new ones for people that didn't take issue before.
---
Project Paradise would be perfect as a daily op. Not so much for rr.
---
I don't remember experiencing *that* in any previous Fallout games.
---
in fact, I remember I could sell ammo for 1 cap a pop and buy my preferred type for about the same, so.
---
GET 'EM OUT, BOYS!! HE'S IN THE WRONG SUBREDDIT!!
---
If grindings not your thing thats cool you do you but this probably isn't the game for you.
---
Only with their insane commando builds.
---
I mean I don't blame you for shooting your shot lol at least xp is coming in faster than ever now
---
You forgot one.
---
"This sorry ass, shit excuse for a mother fucking company, banned my account when I did nothing, hadn't played for months. FUCK THOSE SORRY BASTARDS. They can take FO76 and shove it up their sorry, failing, fallout asses."

How's that fit into your sorry ass PSA
---
Turn on pacifist?
---
I was just talking about this yesterday with some of my 76 buddies. I get having complaints and not liking some aspects...but it seems as though some people are never happy. Just stop playing the game at that point if you're that unhappy.
---
Fun tip you can do once you clear elder..  jump back in with a solid group and ignore the objective and just exp farm..  it nonstop waves. 
---
The longest I stay was 45min idk if there a time limit

The board is very unexciting compared to last season.
---
I was actually wondering about getting in and out of the armor as well haha. 
---
But what the hell. Guess I can live with that lol. 
---
So what heavy weapon do you use?
---
I’m not really the kind of player to go farm for materials all the time. 
---
Any recommendations on that part?
---
Would be great if you could just mark yourself as hostile and engage in open world PvP. 
---
It would be also nice if there was more of an incentive for PvP as well. Right now, the handshake system you’re referring to isn’t engaging and often discouraging for newer players because there is hardly any rewards for the amount of risk you take on. Exclusive cosmetics would be nice or maybe a PvP-exclusive currency that we could trade for rewards like scrip or bullion...
---
This game has a really fun mix of RPG and shooter elements that almost no other game has to offer. More rewarding PvP would really help diversify the endgame and create a nice alternative to usual tasks we get.
---
It happens to me whenever the game crashes and it's really annoying.
---
AT did just fine in a Solo Spec Ops with a non-legendary automatic pipe rifle.

300 gold a piece. So I guess technically limited to one every other day.
---
Nw absolutely got updated with this last patch
---
You want a working, bug free Bethesda game? Not in this lifetime pal
---
Nobody said anything about remote work being distracting. There is a serious argument to be made about development not being as effective though. Have a co-locates team is naturally more productive and allows for more creativity. This isn’t the case for all industries, but development it certainly is.

Murder cow

For what it is worth, I had an equally spiteful response for the sh.posters on launch. There were a whole bunch of Obsidian fanbois who wanted Outer Worlds to be the better “new evolution” and who therefore tore down FO76 without any basis for doing so. FO76 is an expansive game with amazing content and it even did some amazing technical things for gaming such as improving the way dynamic lighting and shadow is handled. It didn’t get the credit it deserved back then and I was 100% right there with you in calling out the Obsidian fanbois who were sh.tposting about it.
---
The answer is in the middle. Fallout 76 is an amazing game. Fallout 76 has problems. *Both* of these statements can be true at the same time.
---
BTW - the #1 difference between the launch-era sh.tposters and the people complaining now are that the launch-era people *were not FO76 players*. If they even tried the game at all, it was explicitly for the purpose of complaining about it. Unlike them, the people complaining now are actual FO76 players. That’s a pretty significant difference.
---
Neither will I after the number of respecs I pulled.  Maybe perk packs in every season will help assuage my fears of a drawn out grind, but it will probably be a drawn out grind....oh well
---
Oh man, you should play Fallout 3 then. It's great. Getting mobbed by a gang of Super Mutants, having to use the environment to protect yourself while forcing them to do the same... it was fantastic. A true kill or be killed experience.
---
I've got all my perks for ammo and since I mostly use the Resolute Veteran, I accidentally pumped out 10k rounds yesterday with a handful of clicks. But newer players who don't have those perks are at a disadvantage.
---
I would also like to see the drop rate for tick blood upped, although for my character explicitly I will definitely take your advice on Tea Time and Campfire Tales. (I find that the ticks at the Moonshine shack and at the lumber mills are already dead when I get there. I'm not sure where else they spawn.)
---
And this attitude is 100% why they keep getting away with releasing shit. You’re part of the problem of you just accept it.
---
Lots of states (like Massachusetts) aren’t allowing interstate travel for certain states. We are not back to normal in this country. Expand your world view.
---
Also for reference while Ohio saw about 1000 new cases yesterday, Texas saw 4,000 and currently is sitting at 14k deaths.   Texas is about 2.5x the size of Ohio but daily cases are 4x. People not taking this seriously is why we have 200k dead.
---
Gatling gun is most ammo efficient, but i like all the heavy weapons that are fast firing with no spin up. ex: 50 cal, Light Machine Gun, Flamer, etc
---
I traded my plan for a TSE Tesla. Now I am pretty happy with that decision.
---
My galleria signs work fine as well and the other burrow signs work too. It's just the dang Dr. Ken's chems sign lol.
---
It’s just business
---
The Deathclaw I tamed was literally level 100. That was the case before the most recent update but now mobs have scaled leveling so that isn’t the case. Also people’s tamed animals that they had before their update had scaled to their levels and if those players were high enough levels these animals could be 75-100.
---
It's a working product. Get your head out of your entitled ass. You don't like the product? Ok.
---
They don't owe you a bug free game. Sorry, they just don't. That's not how it works. Can you play the game? Can you? Yes? The end.
---
That range is still wrong even for the big nozzle. Do you realize how far 128 is? If 128 was on a hunting rifle or other ranged weapon, that’s the range that it starts losing a lot of damage, not the range that the bullets just stop. There flamers range should only be 10-30 on the normal nozzle and even less on the powerful ones
---
Yea that would be the best solution, a full on overhaul, but for the time being, I don't expect Bethesda to do that. So the simplest solution would be adding and tweaking a few mechanics to make the current system more fair.
---
Right man, I cant be bothered to argue with a brick wall. We shall agree go disagree
---
Likewise you can finish the kill with another swipe of that gauntlet. Also melee doesn't suffer range drop off on damage. There are worse problems wit the update than you not getting a one hit kill.
---
Yes that is huge.
---
Heavies for SBQ and Earl, and shotguns for mobs, and daily ops. I have a nice shotgun collection and it’d kill me to get rid of them even though I know it’d be best to optimize the heavy build lol
---
Would love a hoard mode in the game like tf2 or cod zombies where you can buy upgrades to combat against increasingly difficult waves of enemies.
---
I know this works with 3 different people.  Just not sure if this would work solo.
---
true, lol
---
Just get the gold star daily and all the weeklies and you'll be fine. Towards the end they'll probably be x2 anyway.
---
I just want to at least get the Elder rank to try to get some kind of rare drop.... No one in my public team ever joins me in the ops event...... Freakin pain in the ass to do solo.
---
Really, next to any train station will be good. I'm in the southern savage divide and i get plenty of traffic and the vendor bot/legendary scrip next door really helps I feel like
---
#bloodlife
---
Its superior
---
The automatics is where I notice it the most. The handmade it's pretty noticeable but the LMG is almost unusable because a short burst is like 10 rounds. I only break out the LMG on big creatures. But yes great tip.
---
Because you have an unreasonable expectation.   Wanting to be able to one-shot *everything* is unreasonable.
---
Have a good day.
---
Thank you. I was testing and thought it might have been broken.
---
I didn’t say I don’t like it. I’ve played over 3100 hours in this game. I’m saying they owe people who bought it to deliver a working bug free product. HOW IS THIS EVEN A FUCKING DEBATE???!!! If you buy anything from anyone they owe you the same thing.
---
Long term viability of a multiplayer game is usually reliant on the end game. The end game is played by the long term, high level players.  
---
Therefore...
---
#morebloodlesslife
---
Would 2 work?
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
I am sorry dude, but this is a really bad take, and the mass upvotes really put the hivemind of this sub on full display. Everyone is here because they love Fallout, and I bet most of us love FO and TES and for many of us, Bethesda has been among our top favorite devs for a long long time. No other game has had these kinds of issues, not to this degree at least. I played Skyrim for years and years and years because it had so much content, and never got old, I played 76 for about a year, and almost all of the good times were due to the people I was playing with, not even necessarily the game itself. The game has some truly shining moments, but once you do most of the quest content, a season system that consists of picking up wood, scrapping concrete, and aimlessly building and then scrapping stairs at my base for SCORE is NOT engaging! I am sorry but those are not the things I play Bethesda games for, and given that since Wastelanders they have relied HEAVILY on the seasons thing to keep people playing, they did not implement it well for that purpose, I got to level 15 of season 1 and despite really wanting some of the rewards, I just couldnt bring myself to log on nearly every day for a couple hours just to do incredibly boring stuff, and I have not played once since like 2 weeks after SCORE was released.
---
This game has severe issues and has had severe issues the entire time and it is incredibly concerning that they dont really seem to ever learn from their mistakes, and many of them they never fix such as all the bugged ATX and SCORE items that remain bugged to this day. This raises very legitimate concerns about future games. I want to look forward to Starfield and TES6 but honestly I am nowhere near as excited for those as I have been for CP2077 since it was announced back in 2013, and thats because the precedent for CDPR is almost universally positive, and while that was the case for Bethesda up until 76 (for me, I know many people had issues with FO4 too, but I didnt really, I thought that game was great), it really isnt the case now, at least not like it was, and that is entirely based on what I have seen from Bethesda for 3 years now. Three years and they are still making the very same mistakes they made pre-launch...I have not given up hope entirely, hopefully they got their Zenimax/Providence equity stuff figured out and they can get back on track, but the players need to hold their feet to the fire and discourage them from going down the path of EA/Ubisoft/Activision and just totally saying fuck it and embracing the bullshit 100%.
---
No doubt. Every time I hit a daily or got the 10k repeatable it just starts over and over again. What a pain in the ass..... Thinking about dropping a ticket, but i know what good that will do......lol
---
Roger that. 
---
I actually totally forgot about the flamer! 
---
What do you have the most fun running with?
---
Cause flamer sounds fun lol. 
---
I hear the .50 cal eats a LOT of bullets. 
---
So maybe that one is out of the picture for me personally.
---
Within legacy weapons value is placed on rarity ( usually determined by dup ) for instance a BE15 gatlin laser Is a dime a dozen and you can get one pretty much any time you look. Alternatively a JE gauss is so wildly rare that even if you can afford it 4× over your not likely to find it.
---
Good post, however i would appreciate it and many others would too if you added more paragraph breaks to future posts make it more readable.
---
Easy to lose track of reading when it's a block.
---
Cya
---
One shot everything? No but even with a tanky build it was still difficult to clear westek with melee before the nerf and now with stronger enemies and worse weapons
---
The biggest thing that feeds into this is the non-existent communication between BGS and the player base. I am look you two... u/ladydevann and u/valseek.
---
@OP while BGS' marketing says that they'll listen to the feedback, facts show that they just ignore it altogether, except when there are enough posts of the same kind. EG Wall-glitching when building.
---
K
---
The proposed idea is simply to add more life to the game's PvP. And the junk is still yours, the game tells you when it's stolen, marks it on your map, and tells you to recover *your* dropped junk
---
Mine work
---
Just....swap them out?
---
Their are a lot of QOL perks that you don’t need in the build 24/7. Like you can always just equip something like Woodchucker when your near a source of wood, then replace it back with a damage perk when your finished harvesting
---
I get that, I'm fine with losing my junk if someone kills me, takes it, and I'm unable to kill them back, it gives better players a reward.  
---
But when someone shoots me in the back because the game's PvP mechanics are broken, then I'm not beaten by a smarter, better player, I'm beaten by bad game mechanics.
---
I have been doing this since Halo 2 came out when I shoot automatic weapons. It makes my 50 cal feel like it's got a 500 round magazine.
---
Is this type of build even possible anymore?  I thought that you had to use the flamethrower trap to get round walls and that they had fixed that "feature".
---
The abundance of people in the community willing to help low levels is amazingly high for any mmo. I often craft them a heavy weapon or Tesla so they can use them to better tag enemies. As many have said before, a box setup in camps with a lockable level range would be a great addition to the game. Many new players won’t know to check suitcases or cash registers at train stations.
---
This! I feel like its overlooked alot.
---
Coming from /all and I did, I will also never pre-order from bethesda again.
---
The not reviving a teammate even after you stim them and go through the animation.
---
The auto fire glitch when you get downed and then revived.
---
ASD glitch.
---
Glitch where throwables cannot be equipped.
---
Hotwheel glitch.
---
Have stims but they don’t work glitch.
---
Falling through the map glitch
---
All the people who run full demo perks and blow you up before you see them, screw them
---
But lastly, why do so many people cry about frog legs?
---
I will never defend Bethesda for not creating a Fallout game specifically for you and your play style. I cannot believe Todd doesn't have you on speed dial to approve every change made to the game. You've seen my last penny, Beth!!!
---
I love my flamer. It's a legacy so that's the main reason why, as with the regular flamer you gotta get pretty close up. Besides that, I always use my Lmg and 50, which both do eat up quite a bit of ammo lol
---
Not if you have a solid build dedicated to melee. I ran WestTek yesterday and still melee one-shotted pretty much every Super Mutant. It did require me to slot in my Melee perks and pop a PsychoBuff and a Glowing Meat Steak, but again, it’s viable.
---
Yup. In full bloodied gear.
---
No I think that it's because people don't like needed change.
---
My AGI is at 30 with sneak, ninja, escape artist and evasive.  When I strike with my Deathclaw gauntlet I do not get 3x dmg even though the perk is listed as 3x.  It’s actually additive.  Also if you kill an enemy it goes from caution to danger rapidly and I can’t evade enemies as they all seem to find me.
---
Yep.. they are beasts, I’ve got an explosive stalkers DB and it melts , surprisingly durable as well
---
these are the kinds of things people point to when they say this game has failed *as a service.*  at least they didnt publish it while it was still broken (ahem, faschnacht)...
---
Never said you needed perk cards to have fun. I said you needed certain perk cards if you wanted to do damage like min/max players do.
---
Bye, Felicia!
---
I'm thinking the instigating combat shotgun would work really well for a sneak build, but would have limitations in Daily OPS.
---
Give me your stuff
---
I’d be pretty happy if they added it to the legendary pool as well! It would fit in with the ripper and mr handy blade
---
Stupid shit like this gets upvoted.... Lame ass psa. Thanks!
---
Bye!
---
The ultimate insult...getting insulted by insult bot so badly that you attack him only for him to kill you lol
---
Another year this game will be empty as fuck. Already seeing a drop in server population.
---
We don’t like your kind round these here parts, Now GIT.....
---
Don’t think Todd’s gonna see this mate.
---
With how messy my apartment is a cat would probably have a higher survivability rate in the nuclear wasteland than with me irl where it could choke on some straw wrappers I didnt know were even there
---
Except it's two shots instead of one now. Great changes. *thumbs up*
---
No idea. Never tried it all 3 solo like that. 
---
My crew we sometimes run all 3 at the same time, then launch 1 at a time.
---
So you don't consider daily ops as new content... do you consider ACP as new content? 
---
the "constant lack of new content" is a bit confusing to me. Theres a few new pieces of content in this patch... and in last patch there were some too...
---
Also there is a roadplan which shows upcoming content... 
---
This game gets content updates every month which is pretty much an industry norm right now. Are you just unhappy with the new content?
---
Bitching about people bitching... is still bitching. :) I bitch... and I’m a bitch. Hello bitches!
---
&gt;It’s clear this game isn’t built around me or my play style. 
---
And now I shall recite one of the most famous Vulcan proverbs ever: The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
---
The change was needed. And the fact that you actually mentioned out it isn’t handing **you** everything on a silver platter says something about you, as a person. You’re selfish.
---
Lol.
---
Ah, so you like to play God Mode. Definitely not what I'm looking for in a Fallout game, but I can how you wouldn't enjoy 76 then.
---
I think you are wrong. With overall damage nerf and enemy spwan only with high level, your damage ALLWAYS will be reduced. Due DR formula is 50% reduction lead to roughly 28.8%, but multiply over total damage, instead of other like Bloodied that add 80% (standard bloodied helath set) over base weapon damage. So if you stack peks/consumables to increase damage AA effect multiply it by 28.8. There is turn point in damage output where AA is more powerfull that bloodied !!!
---
Well they do have some okay stats right now and they have their scenarios but I would say many people would prefer ballistic to energy weapons. This is because when you are walking through the wasteland you find more ballistic low power ammo than energy ammo. And the low power guns that take them do a moderate to small amounts of damage. Also the energy weapons are capable of doing more damage than ballistic weapons with their mods and fire a whole lot faster.
---
Because my sentiments are anti-foodbuild. ;)
---
I can't believe that stairs are this difficult. 😑
---
LOL You took the words right out of my mouth.
---
So I have to constantly farm for psychobuff just to have a viable weapon?
---
see you tonight in daily ops
---
Here’s to hoping a perk is added to reduce rifle weights in the future! My first build was instigating hunting rifle and it worked pretty good until health kept rubber banding for some reason.
---
I might have to try that out lol. 
---
Thanks!!
---
Ever since 1 wasteland my stealth build has been struggling a bit. And I find the daily ops hard to complete tbh. Rifles just don’t compete with the challenge imo. 
---
So a change might be good at this point.
---
I usually play with another person so if we both did them at the same time and 1 launched. Does the other not put a nuke card in?
---
It’s not just an extra few bullets, I can’t kill a damn thing anymore without my armour shredded and stimpaks and chems used.
---
I’m selfish because... i’m quitting a game that clearly isn’t made for me. Alright dude lol
---
I have it everytime i level up.
---
One Tamriel killed the game for me because it completely removed all sense of danger and challenge from the world. You can't really equate the two.
---
The normal laser gatling does in fact reward fusion cores i just got 4 of them.
---
Ill have to keep that in mind. Sorry about that, just popped into my head and I typed it out fast as hell, didn't really consider how damn long it was lol.
---
You put my thoughts into words better than I could have lol
---
Right. I thought it’d be important for some peeps that are struggling or considering what to do with this one wasteland and figured I could holler about the DB. Making a new character and I’m going to craft him a modded DB without stars just because I know it’ll have similar results just not as tuned.
---
You don't believe me right well ok you don't have to take a guy on the internet on his word but I'm not banned so I have 0 reasons to lie. If I did place the factory I would just say it.
---
Even if you have plenty of food, SS is fantastic. I got it and was able to free up perk points in endurance, agility and luck. And I'm free to dump all of the dog food I have into vendors and my swaths of nuka cola into my trader character
---
that's a lot to digest, but I only have one question right now... IS THE DEHYDRATION BUG FIXED?!?!?
---
queue up everyone who will state there was never a dehydration bug... yeah there is/was.
---
This. There is almost never a good reason to hold the trigger down and dump ammo. Short, controlled bursts. Two to the chest, one to the head.
---
Daily Ops are not new content, they are quick little radiant quests at heart using repurposed areas and enemies already in the game.
---
lol k bye
---
If I remember correctly they were supposed to remove the negative effects of hunger and dehydration and focus more on giving bonuses for being well fed and well hydrated, they may have changed focus since then however. I unfortunately don't remember what the source was where I had read or heard that.
---
If someone can confirm or deny my statement with an official Bethesda announcement video or post I would appreciate it.
---
Ok so, remove the cars, you may as well remove the robots while you're at it, just make it a walking simulator to get plans. No, wait, let's just give everyone plans for joining the event and be done with it.
---
It's mischief night, not guided meditation. You can't have mischief without the mayhem.
---
Edit: I'm really disappointed you all think that walking around Whitesprings is sufficient for an event. I'll just go visit Valley Galleria and have some fun there by myself. \*sniff\*.
---
This just occured to me:
---
If it didn't apply the freezing effect, I would have stuck with thinking it was just an audio bug.  But the freezing effect, the fact that it only happens with melee armed mobs, and the audio makes me think it really is some kind of range bug.
---
Behemoth in the prison, megasloth in the mire, deathclaw in forest, moleminer using heavy equipment for ash heap. These would be epic
---
Literally cannot use aimbot on Xbox but ok
---
So what?  He removed one of the major factors in a Bloodied build’s offensive power; the Bloodied Weapon. 
---
The live version of the nerf is far less impactful than the PTS version was. 
---
You don’t have to be ultra-optimized to remain highly viable. 
---
And no one in their right mind would expect a base pipe rifle to be effective in that scenario without some added boosts. So of course he has perks and stats suited. 
---
He essentially used a commando build for the damage output. For survivability, he went with damage mitigation and avoidance instead of soaking it up. And he also lost his sneak damage bonus in addition to the Bloodied damage bonus. 
---
The new meta has shifted. It isn’t ‘broken’ like some people claim.
---
The most frustrating thing about this post is that I've seen it linked twice elsewhere with the statement that you should do the Daily Op 3 times at each level to maximize rewards. I don't know how someone can say that with a link to this post, which states several times (both in the post and the comments) that you do not need to do this. Mind boggling.
---
Bloody is less required/ effective than before. Because the boost is lessened. You could play as low health just as effectively with AA now. Or Vamp if you prefer survivability and you can do so without sacrificing massive damage.
---
Well, I know my ass is above my knees, so probably. 😁
---
You made it a point that one single part of the game wasn’t designed specifically for you, and that it’s a leading contributor as to why you’re done. Yeah, that sounds selfish. 
---
“Bethesda didn’t make game for **ME!** Game bad!!!”
---
No.  We run silo till last room.  1st person will initiate the launch then launch there nuke.  
---
Once done, other teammate goes back to the silo they did and then initiate launch and same thing for the 3rd.
---
Well in the future note this, many players in the community want to help and are awesome people. But if something seems too good to be true (like an ammo factory or 5 star legendaries), be very careful because sometimes things like that can get you caught in a ban wave.
---
VATS is as good as redundant at present, so hit and miss.
---
Yes that is correct. I've got an Instigating Combat Shotgun, and a sneak/shotgun build, and it packs a punch. With Follow Through and Adrenaline, you can cut through level 75 charred ghouls like butter.
---
This is perfect for a scoped cursed fletched harpoon
---
*Cries with Minigun equipped*
---
That's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. Been running this build for 200 odd levels now and love it
---
Note, 5 luck is from a legendary perk
---
I just wanna know if it will stip me from blowing myself up with my shotgun like dense and fireproof
---
I would totally go for the anti armor 50 cal
---
lol it's not like it's that much more difficult now. Just like instead of 1 headshot it takes 2. You're not a super tough hardass lol suddenly.
---
Fallout 76 daily quests
---
It's kinda funny how many people get butthurt when somebody says they're quitting. Its like people think they can't actually like something without refusing to accept that it has flaws,  and choosing to ignore those flaws.
---
maybe its a legacy build,i have a base on a monorail column,but i cant build one like it anymore on other toons.
---
That wasn’t my question. I asked if you were trying to place your camp or a section of camp from the blueprint. 
---
My last question has nothing to do with how it got there.
---
No i didn’t. I made the point that the game isn’t made for my play style and it’s moving in the wrong direction for me.
---
Yep. Just gotta wait for them to do it.
---
I was pure bloodied in PTS, all damage perks max rank plus mutations, and your example sounds about right, and I was only just short of killing the super mutants. But I got sick of being swarmed and murdered by level 75-100 mobs, so I swapped out, because the tradeoff of "Low durability high damage" was not really viable for me any more. Used to be a challenge, "pop heads before they get a shot off", but it became a lot less fun when I couldn't pop heads.
---
I am curious how well AA works now. Hoping to find a post soon.
---
I love the build no mutations or charisma. Very heavy on the BoS cosplay.
---
I dunno, I’m ALWAYS hungry on my char, so butchers bounty makes it great for glowing meat (and any extras I can sell for either 4/6 caps a piece! (1 Charisma) doing events with a lot of glowing enemies is a hell of a cap profit
---
I really wish they'd explain it's pretty pointless to fight enemies unless you're defending an uplink because they just respawn constantly. Just hoof it!
---
You guys suck. For real, instead of spending time plowing out the over priced atom shop items how bout you fix your damn game. Things like the Halloween event are what mmos are for. To get communities together having fun. I don’t care how cool my outfit is if there are no events to show it off at. You guys stink.
---
But that Vampire Gatling Laser is a damn good gun too.
---
I'd just be happy with a improved frame rate and decent load times. Maybe some improved textures.
---
Exactly what you said was mentioned in some interview with a developer as something they were thinking about, but it has never been confirmed in any official capacity that it is going to happen.
---
In addition to that other super mutant spots scale to player’s levels. Lots of farming spots opened up.
---
Well I was 2 hand melee before the patch.  Last night during the op I was on the struggle bus big time.  I was frozen so my swing speed and run speed where nonexistent.  I was seriously thinking of switching to heavy guns since I have 15 in str.  I like the patch but it has made melee, for me at least, feel very underwhelming.
---
The rest of my team were gun types and they all were melting faces ;P.
---
Thank you that’s what I wanted to know 👍👍👍
---
Wait. So I can only kill people who have this perk?
---
I'd personally keep two: the AA .50 and the Furious Minigun. Standard heavy build with them.
---
I don't have any experience with Bloodied or Junkie builds, though, and I don't know which stat combos make a weapon "magic," so one of the others may be/is probably better.
---
For like the longest time I remember Sony would not let you change your username unless it was reported to many times.
---
I find it cathardic just to build shit and craft shit.
---
Basically, it was mentioned in an interview that they were looking at removing some of the negative effects from food\\water but its never been on a "its coming this patch" type communication. 
---
Survival Syringe cures all food\\water , disease   and restores your health
---
I don't run an optimized build.  I can't (and never have been able to) solo the SBQ.  Unless we were talking about mid to low level mobs, I could never clear a room by randomly firing from across the map.  However, the nerf I experienced from One Wasteland is vastly smaller than what many other people have experienced.  A L50 mob takes just as long to kill as before.  The same goes for an L75 or L100.  If anything, I think a typical encounter goes much better than before.  I have few complaints.
---
Sadly we are not playing a game where QOL counts for much.
---
Bit of a shitty thing to assume, no?
---
You could have said something like “This daily op clearly isn’t centered around stealth builds,” which would be a valid and fair thing to say. In which everybody else would respond by saying that in the future, there will be Ops where being stealth will almost be mandatory. 
---
But no. Your exact words were “it’s clear this game isn’t built around **me**” See? You’re making it entirely about yourself. You’re not asking for other alternatives to make it easier and still keep your build and play style. You’re just throwing in the towel and letting a subreddit that doesn’t care about you know that you’re quitting because of *you*.
---
If you can aim from side to side then you can aim up and down.
---
Its bloodied commando or heavy weapons as it always was?
---
Just a vanilla lever action? What were your teammates doing? Or were you trying to solo an event made for teamwork by yourself?
---
I'll have to think back and look through some interviews, that sounds about right. Thanks for that. If I can find it I'll post a link.
---
https://twitter.com/jg93/status/1304398358669332480?s=21
---
The project lead confirmed its still being worked on
---
Youre paying to basically beta test the game and items for them. This is literally a no mans sky scenario, game launched with empty promises and bugs galore, then in turn us the players get to help them make it into a passable online multiplayer game over the next few years. This game is a minimum 10 year title from what ive heard.
---
I support the idea 100%. I also think that if a player is in pacifist mode he shouldn't be able to pick up a dropped death bag.
---
Oh you mean the event they said was tuned for solo as well as teams?
---
well there were at least 200 stinkers, but only like 8 assaultron heads and 5 broadsiders.
---
not an assumption.
---
When you are reading a line and go to next line sometimes you lose track of where you are at. So it's a quality of life change for the reader.
---
 Thanks for responding and have a good one brother.
---
yeah but in reality, he/she/it is not wrong  :(
---
Well that touched a few nerves, didn't it? Reading the same 2 or 3 replies over and over.
---
I agree though: there's complaints no matter what.
---
These two would make for a good commando build: 
---
Quad Handmade, +33% vats hit, +250 DR reload (Never have to reload and good VATS accuracy)
---
 Junkies Combat Rifle, explosive, +1 P (decent damage, these would be great if this was a Fixer)
---
These would make a good PA heavy gunner:
---
Vampire Gatling Laser, +25% faster fire, +15% reload (super tanky, you would never need stimpacks)
---
Junkies 50 cal, +10% damage aiming, +15% crit meter 
---
Anti Armor 50 cal, +25% faster fire, +1 P (probably best as of the latest patch)
---
That's a very good question. And I'm someone that doesn't run an optimized build. 
---
Here's my view. Optimized builds work. But they work based off of how things in a game currently stand. 
---
Any change to any aspect changes optimized builds. Change a perk, maybe a little adjustment. Change a couple perks have to rethink your build. Major changes to the game, well, seems like you might be starting over. 
---
So for the build is dependent on a static world with very little change. And new content has to fit in with what the player has planned for. 
---
These games are never going to be that static over their life. And new content has to introduce new aspects otherwise boredom sets in. 
---
So all of that can upset a builds purpose. 
---
So while I'm not optimized for ONE thing, I do make sure my character isn't gimped. I have both melee and range damage boost from a couple sources. It's not maxed out damage. But I don't need to be that maxed to play the game. So it takes me a few more bullets to kill a creature. Or an extra swing of a my weapon. 
---
The way i see is this. My character is optimized to be functional and effective in a variety of situations. When changes happen to the game, the impact on me is little. Little changes have almost no impact, and big changes like this update have little impact. 
---
To be honest, this update has opened up a lot more options for me. Because before, I wasn't having any issues in playing the game. To much had become trivial. There was no reason to try and up my damage, legendary hunt, or whatever. And I do have good gear. 
---
With Daily Ops, I don't have to change my whole character for that. I can just adjust how I play the game, rather than how my character is built. And that makes the game challenging and interesting. 
---
So for me, I see it like this. How you build your character is your choice, not mine. If the results gets you what you want, good. However, if anything happens to change your equation, and now you are frustrated, that's still on you. Because the equation should include the fact there are aspect outside of your control. The biggest being when the game changes.
---
You guys clear diseases instead of letting it run it's course and using the mutation Walking Plague?
---
I don’t know why it’s weird. They’ve known about countless bugs since the game launched that are still here. They just don’t care.
---
You can please all of the people some of the time...etc.
---
I won't go back through your pretty solid list of the good, the bad and the ugly when it comes to complaints. 
---
On the one hand, some of the complaints come from people who do really enjoy the game, and want to see it iron out some of the bugs to improve it.
---
FO76 and RDRO are my main online gaming experiences (apart from a short-lived dalliance with FIFA once upon a time). There's always a challenge in creating an online environment that's well-balanced for veterans and newbies. 
---
I'm sure that folks that have much more experience in online multiplayer stuff like this will have more informed opinions, but I think FO76 works pretty well. 
---
It can be tricky to keep currencies balanced, and there are times I'd like to be able to hold or use more caps/scrip/gold, or have a bit more stash space without paying for FO First 
---
I think it's good that Beth staffers are active in this sub. I'm sure the latest patch will come off of the back of intel they've gained from here and other player communities, as well as what their data tells them about things like OP builds (and, obvs, about ways to earn a few more caps for Beth too). 
---
In my day job, I've found that the loudest and most frequently expressed opinions tend to be the negative ones, but that there is often a silent (or not very loud) majority that are broadly satisfied, generally speaking.
---
I'm enjoying FO76. I'm a relatively recent joiner (level 80 today - categorise that as you see fit) and there are things I might like to change, but broadly speaking, I really like this game, and the player community involved in it.
---
Yeah, getting a lot of bouncing too. I'm wondering if it's due to dynamic scaling whenever I enter an area.
---
Yea obviously, passive players could get warned like in workshops, though that's clearly not enough sometimes. So those features could be straight up barred from people in Passive.
---
They’ve had a year to fix it. A YEAR. if they knew there were issues then they’re either too stupid to fix them or too lazy. I guess it’s 50/50.
---
Add that vampire Gatling laser too. Makes for a pretty solid setup for heavy
---
Dang, you really hit the nail on the head for how I've been thinking about Bethesda. I have been very vocal in the past just how much 76 sucks. Probably more so than many other things in life that are much more important. However, you know why? Because I love Fallout. I've loved Fallout since I was a kid, literally played every single one. For years it was the gold standard for me, a series I compared anything else to when it came to quality. I pre ordered 76, paid full price for it, booted it up day one and the entire thing was broken... I have never experienced such a 180 in quality, and I'm not even talking about bugs since I expect them at this point from Bethesda. It was like watching a part of me die. I have a feeling that most of the people who complain vocally on this sub have had a similar experience.
---
Ayer. BUT some people want the best things now
---
That very last line is what pisses me off (not at you, at others). People either don't know or totally forget the kind of shit that is normal now days. Atom Shop is fairly benign. Of all the things to bitch about, that's not one.
---
Yes, there are bugs, and yes, they should be reported, but bitching like a six year old who got a red megazoid instead of a green one is not useful or interesting. PSA's on game breakers? Important, glad you shared, upvote for awareness! 500th post about how much bethesda sux because bugs exist? Not so much.
---
Yes, we know the nerf hurt. But it put the game at much better footing for later balance. Adapt for now, or come back later when they fix it.
---
These are the people buying PS5's for thousands.
---
 I support the idea 100%
---
Pacifist is always activ.
---
I get that you're trying to be cute and all, that's literally all you do all day long. but subjectivety is a thing.
---
personally to me, actively choosing to gimp yourself because you're some masochist addicted to pain make as little sense as I'm sure playing in 'god mode' makes to you.
---
Hadn't seen that. Thanks.
---
Ma'am, this is not an airport. You do not need to announce your departure.
---
With chems and headshots it’s absolutely possible
---
After the last sale, I started saving up scrip on 11 characters. First day I turned in 11k scrip, plus scrapped unwanted legendary's that I got making for a total of 12k scrip day 1. Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday morning I turned in between 120-150 scrip per character for approx. another 5,500. I used a 12th character to collect and turn in another 5-600 scrip over that period as well.
---
That's what I was wondering, if since the game is now trying to...balance itself around me, if it loads differently somehow? But it's really making the game harder to play when I feel like it's playing at slideshow speeds.
---
I watch the animations. I noticed during yesterday's ops that the muties were dying before their life bar updated/vanished. Big thing is, some weapons have trouble with tap and wait, like miniguns.
---
I have 350 hours on the Steam variation of FO76 and a minimum of another 100+ when it was strictly on Bethesda launcher.  I find it hard to overly complain about something I've spent roughly $150 on over the almost 2 years.
---
Has the game had it's ups and downs?  Absolutely, I hadn't played for quite a long time before Wastelanders came out.  Before that I'd of probably called it messy but fun and completely unrealized potential.
---
In the months since then, they've pushed a lot of content including two seasons, the full wastelanders and a bunch of tweaks since then.  Is it all great?  Not at all.  Are some mechanics / grinds a bit overkill?  Absolutely.  But it's still fun, I still enjoy most of the dailies, I've grinded for most of the gold rewards I overly care about so I don't have a nose to the grindstone mentality anymore.
---
I'm very interested in the introduction of the Brotherhood of Steel.  I feel like they put the back end groundwork of retooling with this patch to give us another large content dump in a few months.
---
From where we started to where we are now, it's night and day.  Some things still haven't been addressed but they also haven't forced expansion costs or anything like that.  I look at it in comparison to WoW which I've spent oodles of time over the years.  It's been 9 months since they've done anything of interest and that's a typical cycle for their expansions.  Having spent so much time / money in WoW, I find the cost to fun ratio probably better in 76.
---
So agreed with you OP, some points are frustrating but I still like to play 76 frequently and think they've continued to improve the game.
---
Like fallout 4 waiting for the semi announced 5 ?
---
Get out of here with your common sense nonsense🤬
---
i get that (&amp; im inclined to agree that aa or vampire will become more meta).  what im saying, is that relatively speaking, bloodied etc is still BiS.  they nerfed it...but also everything else.  relative to all the other loadouts, it is still king.  its like they tried to kill that mosquito with a nuclear bomb, but it survived -- weakened but survived, and everything else is just an ashpile.
---
its my hope that this is the first part of a larger weapons/skills balance.  if this is all they're gonna do about it tho...
---
Electric absorption is good for now, but the healing effect is probably a bug that's going to get fixed. I didn't bother with it myself, because I didn't want to get attached, and Fusion cores are easy enough to farm or craft that its a waste to use that legendary slot for Electric Absorption for just the recharge.
---
Now, if the healing is actually intended....that is an entirely different story.
---
Except the game has been a hot mess since its release and its crazy there are people that actually care about its state are still here.
---
If this were League of Legends, yes haters gonna hate. But in this case no.
---
Lmaooo, you’re just jealous
---
solid picks, if you run power armor which torso mod do you use?
---
LOL just got mine
---
What addictions do you use? Thinking of switching my bloodied to a junkies heavy gunner.
---
Sorry i didn’t craft my message to your exacting specifications.
---
Worth note, Steam now has some measures in place to prevent review bombing, so that bombing is probably as big a part of the average than you'd think.
---
Not in the least. On my main, I run a non-Bloodied/non-Junkies/non-PA Gauss Shotgun build. I’m doing pretty much the same damage output (occasionally have to take an extra shot, but that’s not a big deal) and have to be a little more tactical and defensive. I slotted in Born Survivor as a backup.
---
There are more decisions that have to be made in builds to be as effective, but it’s certainly viable to have something other than Bloodied Commando or Heavy Weapons.
---
I recently switched from rifleman to commando (before the update actually) and I just figured this out after burning through tons of ammo.  I’m now just tapping the trigger and popping off maybe 1-2 shots and seeing what happens.  Usually this puts the enemy at one shot left and sometimes it kills them.  Basically, it feels like my old rifleman build can just shoot faster now.  Improvement
---
This post must’ve been made by bethesda
---
The game works though lol. A bug list isnt a list of work that they "owe" you. Jesus christ dude. You pay for something, you dont like it? You leave a review or get a refund. The fact that you think that after 3100 hours in a $60 game that they still owe you something is honestly hilarious. They owe you a copy of the game you paid for. Thats it.
---
I don't care when I take a bag that was not meant to me, but i'd like that as a way to engage pvp yes.And obviously to get you loot back.
---
With 1st players it would just be pvp as we can stash every junk in a second.
---
Still building my first suit, and I don't know what all the options are yet, so I dunno.
---
I'm guessing they prolly have a back up bloody fixer and red asylum dress.  Those things dont mean much when you have a stash box on a mule full if them.
---
You realize you can damage them down with any weapon you want then just use the specific weapon for the killing blow?  That’s all I did when it was melee, I blasted them with my vampiric minigun then whipped out the bowie knife for finishing blows.
---
Exactly. If it’s from a blueprint OP will have to just delete the blueprint.
---
Haha
---
I agree that the value is inflated, but if someone traded what you said they probably have multiple dresses and God roll fixers. Duping means some people have litterally hundreds of those high value items
---
Remember to scrap all your existing perk cards that you don’t use.  You’ll end up with a ton more perk coins.
---
True, but overpay something like that? Holy moly! O_O
---
This community’s turning ultra defensive again.
---
Wait you mean having a build actually matters and its not just a useless game mechanic?! /s. 
---
I 100% agree with you a build is the only thing separating the people who enjoying the update to the people who are not enjoying it.
---
Woosh xd
---
Oh no 
---
What does psa mean apart from powered, sentinel, assassin again? Just curious lol.
---
That’s not entirely accurate. 
---
&gt;	While the heartiest adventurers will be able to complete Daily Ops alone, we do recommend teaming up with at least one other player if you plan on seeking out Elder Tier rewards. 
---

---
Sounds like you aren’t one of the headiest adventurers. They are intended for team play unless you have an excellent build.
---
I got 2 of them so far lol. If I seen that offer I would have jumped on that real quick.
---
😂😂
---
Now you're just being a dickhead
---
That why i'm continue to play as bloodied build event if bloodied build was nerfed and unplayable, uny gear is the only reason to keep me playing as blood.
---
I pop enemies from point A to point B, but only if they are in a direct path, and only because I am going to slow down even more if I have to stim (I am set to autorifles, so a kill takes a literal second). Between that and the faster running in groups perk, it's just easier than hoping the folks behind me can get by without being dragged into the fight.
---
It's not so much the quests themselves, but getting to them &amp; running into level 25 mutants &amp; the like. But I will follow your advice. I'm on PS4
---
Lol ok. I have to attack him for disagreeing with me?
---
Or at least go to a different sub
---
What’s your gamertag?
---
**That build sucks...**
---
*For any enemy on the receiving end. ;)*
---
This might be a good time to remind you that as you go through life, you're going to encounter people who have opinions that are different than yours. And it's important to remember that that's OK.
---
If players wanted that, they'd play OGame and not Fallout. It's a bit sad that Bethesda doesn't see that.
---
"We want Bethesda games with co-op.  
---
- Here is Fallout with 24 players.  
---
- Thanks, I'll be able to play with my buddy.  
---
- You're welcome, the benefits of your playing session end when we decide it.  
---
- ???"
---
They owe you the fucking product they told you was for sale, dude, legally.
---
Could probably add a limit to the tent, not placing it during pvp or any sort of combat.
---
Either way I can only really see it improving the health of the game
---
Lol it was unintentional
---
I bought Fallout 1st to smite my friends who kept griping about it and now they play on my or other's private worlds.
---
Also i like supporting decent or good businesses. Stop playing EA game that came after battlefield 4 with some exceptions. Also I work for i don't get paid to work for free neither should these developers. So fck off ya bloody leeches and be grateful but don't sit there and take bad parts and ignore them we're all people we make mistakes. Just gotta try and figure it out.
---
Yep! That makes sense, thanks!
---
Be nice if we could get shelf sets with set slots such a slot or 2 on top and for each shelf so yu could add stuff to make it look less like a collectors display and more like your everyday decor like a sheepsquach skull and miners brass lamp on top and other knicknacs on shelves. I would love it if yu could have even if it reduce your main capacity a separate stash for display and venders
---
I honestly believe since day one that they are working with minimum resources.
---
I wouldn’t blame anyone that is working on the game development side. They are doing their best. I’d blame the VP’s, board members and shareholders for pushing certain aspects of the game to increase its profits.
---
Game developers then have to allocate resources to those things while delaying and cutting others.
---
Additionally, the development team probably isn’t given enough budget to hire additional to increase its resources pool. And with covid-19 now, the pool of workers is already low.
---
Just after it was gone for a day or started again right after logging in today... this will become even more fun over time. Imagine being score level 50 and have that popups for minutes more than 10 times a day. This needs to be fixed asap or in a few days I'll have those popups almost constantly making playing almost impossible
---
&gt;The enemies used to be higher level than you if a high level character was also in the area
---
Not in the forest, where now everything does scale with new players. Packs of formerly level 1 ghouls and scorched with maybe one level 6 leader are now all the same level, and that level is always the same as the player encountering them instead of less.  Did you see none of the threads made by sub level 50s in the day and a half immediately following the patch drop talking about this? They were all telling the same story of being out of basically every resource (ammo, scrap and meds) because every enemy they encountered was a bullet sponge with high damage output that would cause their weapons to break more rapidly and shred their health and armor.  You don't see as many of those posts reaching the front page now because they get downvoted from the offset and a bunch of high level min maxers show up in the comments to repeatedly write what amounts to 'get good'. It doesn't matter if enemies in the bog or divide scale with new players if they can never actually get out of the forest.

Auto nade launcher doesn’t come from an orange crate

What do you know about my build? It's not possible that maybe they missed the mark? I want to use rifles, and I should be able to if I want.

The challenge only counts the base amount of ammo. It doesn't take Ammosmith into account, I'd imagine it's the same for Ammo Factory. So, even if Ammo Factory has you making 100 rounds of something, you'd still have to make it several times to complete the challenge.
---
But, yes, that card is the best. I now make 900+ ultracite 50 for a minimal amount of materials.

I see. If you were on PC, I'd be able to help you out. Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.

My wife and I had it complete in error when we did other non-op events after the first op. We still got score credit for it (we were confused AF because we'd finished all the other weeklies and had the score notification pop).

Also thought a pegboard display would be great to have to put tools on and such by benches

this is what you get for finishing early

did you finish beckett's questline? rewards a nice AA 50 cal.

Did you touch my drum set?

There is a thread here from Valseek, which says it’s an intended mechanic ...

Also pour one out for my AA Fixer that bit the dust because I had put the Jack O Lantern paint on it (which doesn't show in the UI right now as a painted item) thus it got sent to the Shadow Realm when I dropped it.

To be fair the week before Halloween we have the Bombs Drop event

It doesn't force people to get on and wait. Because there are other things to do in that hour. 
---
Legendary run, started off with this:  
---
5 challenges, a bonus score for completing all five, and an extra option for NW. you didn't have to do NW to complete the run. 
---
This Season you have:  
---
5 challenges, a bonus for completing all five, and two extra options, one NW and one Daily Ops. 
---
And I'm sorry, The idea that playing a game for longer than an hour is some how bad? If a player is literally getting on, banging out the challenges and then logging and not doing anything else in the game. If that's what's happening, maybe they aren't into the game. And lets not mess about, that's what you are very much saying. 
---
Signing on twice is a horrible thing? Playing more than an hours is forcing players to play? If players have to be forced to play, something else is going on.
---
So sorry, I don't think it was a coding error. Maybe it was. But if it was, it has NOTHING to do with what you are suggesting.
---
I was 3 seconds shy... Wasn't paying attention and the clip on my Gatling ran out... Oh well, just have to play it a bit smarter next time.

what about the junkies explosive railway rifle for a commando build? no silencer, but would wreck in daily ops.
---
Yep, it's  only a few minutes but still this bug has been around for so long
---
Gotdayum that's how. I need to up my game, i guess.
---
Time to flip my new BoS Outfit!
---
There were massive amount of things that people were lying about certain “bugs” for some attenchen or to turn people away from the game. 
---
There were a lot of these kinds when the game released. At that time running into game breaking bugs was still rare but everyone went on the train and saying bugs were so common that one step would destroy the entire game and ruin your console or whatever.
---
Idk I literally just used VATS in a workshop PvP 🤷‍♂️
---
They should be listed. Think it's alcholo, daddy o, day tripper, and ments
---
That's a cool perk - now you can relive the moment over ajd over and over and over.
---
I have the same issue
---
Personally, I think they're gonna remove it from the game. Hardly anybody plays it.
---
Congrats, so far I died when doing solo runs.😀 I love though a team run, even if I just have another player participating.
---
All that means is you have the ability to do it. They specifically said they do not recommend it.
---
they actually uncloak in private servers. so I'm guessing it's just lag.
---
this game does not handle quick events like that well.
---
well the guy said 20k, i dont think we need 20k for the challenge lol

does the flamer get boosts from heavy gunner? from demo expert?
---
Perfect, thanks. Core Assembly or Motion-Assist Servos is what I'd likely pick; am very much a fan of fast AP refresh. Maybe the stealth boy or jet pack. Probably end up keeping one of each on me and swapping them out as needed.
---
Clear cut case of "Someone misunderstood the instructions and is incapable of admitting fault."
---
Fallout 76 came out in November of 2018, so it's almost two years now. Yet there are *still* bugs from the beta in the game. That's sad.
---
Yeah that's probable, so many issues in this game are all due to lag.
---
Only on the Tier levels. If you beat Elder once, you have a 5%, 10%, and 80% of getting a rare reward as it bundles all 3 tier chances. Only once per day.
---
Some of us have all of that and can still find a couple of hours for gaming. Its called good time management- for more info just Google it up.
---
First of all I paid $80. Second of all I continue to pay $100 a year. They still owe all of us that bought this game. If you’re fine with a half finished bug riddled mess then that’s you. But I’m not and a lot of people aren’t and we have every right to expect a finished working product for our money. Go eat your half cooked steak.
---
It's not optimal becaise they chose too many quality of life perks over damage.
---
Before the patch,they could live off of mega stacking bonuses,now they need to adjust to the state of the game...that is not really forgiving for who isn't well built in gear and build.
---
No I know because when the old challenges would be 100 I would craft with ammosmith and I would have to craft a couple more but thanks for letting me know. I did know that tho
---
no, you only get one shot at the rare rewards per tier per day.
---
Can confirm, did this yesterday with my gf, dropped a shotgun so she could repair kit it and return, and it showed up on both of our rewards, which of course wasn't there for her.
---
Agreed. I have a Bloodied Auto Railway Rifle on my stealth commando and it is a lot of fun, just not sure I would base an entire build around it unless you had some other commando weapons to go with it. Spikes are heavy but easy to get. It will do crazy damage and I like it as a boss fight weapon.
---
Emergency protocols
---
Yes you can take part... but you’ll have a much easier time on a team
---
The old system had a vampire or aa doing 80% less damaged for a fully buffed stealth commando. Now AA does 5% more against armored opponents and vampire does 5% less. That sounds like problem solved to me. Each one has their pros and cons.
---
And you found this highly accurate information...where?  And before you link me Steam Charts or something please be aware this game has 5 versions - Xbox, PS4, and 3 PC versions (Bethesda Launcher, Steam, Microsoft Store.)
---
I didn't get to participate last year because I was on hiatus from 76 at the time, but having a halloween even at the frat houses sounds so freaking cool
---
My thoughts are to move it to Bolton Greens and activate the waiter robots from Distinguished Guests. The bots would become more and more disapproving as players cause mayhem amongst them.
---
Fork Bolton Greens for Halloween!
---
A working bug free finished product. Free content and dlc per their own remarks. Those are two things they owe all of us. But yeah.....
---
Yes for heavy gunner but I've never tried demo expert
---
That's not "resolution" for starters. That is your refresh rate.
---
Secondly, its because you have vsync enabled. In Fallout 76 the ONLY way to disable vsync is to edit the INI file like this:

If you are using an NVIDIA video card (Google if you are using AMD/ATI), you can also force it to use a higher refresh like this:

I guess the first year doesn't count? They've had nearly 2 years to fix it.
---
Maybe we can get Meat 144 hours again instead
---
He gave me 2 Radaway and 12 2MM bullets.
---
Self defeating argument
---
"maybe find a different game"
---
Yeah, way ahead of you.
---
Awesome thank you for clearing that up for me
---
thanks for the laugh.. well played.  :)
---
Yeah, I'm saving 38 lvs so far, and that's 70+tokens that I'd be missing out on.. Shit sucks
---
Yeah, rank 1 of bear arms. Sorry I really should have mentioned that. After much fucking about I removed all the perks and legendary strength logged out, went back in added legendary strength and then I finally had the last unused pt. I was ready to scrap them and try new cards if that didnt work I was gonna try throwing the xbox through the window. This fucking game.
---
You stated, and I quote “ people expect the game to be easy when all they have is QOL perks”. 
---
This implies that without specific cards you cannot have fun or successfully complete the game. I was simply pointing out that you can and do not need to get rid of the cards as the OP stated as well
---
We should host our own Mischief Night, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the blackjack and hookers. For halloween, lets all just go to Whitespring and wreck up the place!
---
Well, the Halloween event came out after the game had been out a year. So it’s been a year since the Halloween event. That’s were the year came in.
---
If anybody wants a decent bloodied power armor heavy weapons build, here is mine. I share team medic so other people using stimpacks heals me, and keeps my health topped off. I run at 15-19% health. I can carry as much food, drugs, or energy weapon ammo as I want, and still have tons of carry weight left (I average at about 180-200lbs base weight, carrying like 5 heavy weapons).
---
I have almost no problems after the patch. I put out a hell of a lot of damage still, and am even more invulnerable than I used to be since I have poison resistance.
---
I use T-65 power armor with emergency protocols, and use radstag stew and scorchbeast steak for +88ER and +38DR, along with a few other things carnivore boosts the shit out of, like tasty squirrel stew (+25% xp).
---
I have the legendary perception perk for now, but that is just my current preference, so I can use a few QOL cards, and for flexibility on weapon choice in case they add a good Anti-material rifle or something later this year.
---
The only real disadvantage to this build is that I couldn't afford to use the infiltrator legendary perk. But I run with a team, and my teammate does, so he cracks doors and hacks for us.

Bad bot
---
Bloody stupid bot! :)
---
yes it is.
---
I know you are struggling solo and the event is easier with a team. They certainly can do some further balancing (as they said they would). The fact is daily ops are intended for group play or solo for those who like a significant challenge.
---
🍿🍿🍿
---
when i run around hunting legendary's i can usually average 1 every 10 minutes. sometimes you need a leader of the pack, uranium fever or rad rumble to keep the average up though.
---
Future updates hopefully 😁
---
There’s a lack of resources, then there’s sheer incompetence. They’re not only short staffed but the staff they do have aren’t capable of doing their job right.
---
Most definitely.  But the way people approach it with their entitled attitude . . . Like they don't realize the artists and programmers don't get to make these calls.  I'd hate to constantly be told how shit my work is, when it's out of my hands.  A little respect goes a long way in constructive criticism.
---
[https://steamcharts.com/app/1151340](https://steamcharts.com/app/1151340)
---
Yeahh.... no
---
There's a difference between pointing out problems and throwing fits. This sub cannot figure that out.
---
You're both wrong:  Sheepsquatches spawn as legendary enemies.  So they're neither.
---
So you feel the reddit should only be filled with posts about how amazing the game is, or "great job devs" posts?
---
This reddit is an amazing source of information for the devs. It helps them gauge whats working and what isn't as well as what the community would like to see down the road.
---
I like Fallout 76 a lot - but is it perfect? No - its a bug ridden mess at time. 
---
So yes, when I feel like complaining about something I don't like - i will, as thats how games ultimately improve.
---
Bethesda don't need cheerleaders - they need good honest feedback.
---
And you immediately got the disk or download after handing over your money. That's it. You legally have your product the deal is final.
---
Junkies explosive railway is the most unique. I would make a stealth commando with vats and just wreck things. Wear the BOS engineers outfit and yell choo chooo over the mic.
---
Use the quad handmade as a backup for sbq and earl.
---
sub machine gun...its the tommy gun
---
I’ve seen this before update , I walked in to talk to ward for daily and he was having a full conversation with someone about sending scouts out. I said damn that’s cool then never really saw it again or at least didn’t notice it
---
This was only for the first one...
---
You got the plan??
---
Did we just become best friends?
---
Since your being very contentious, I’d need a link to fully accept that.
---
I have to say with What Rads perk and Healing Factor serum, you really do need less rad away and stimpaks, only use then if you're in battle.
---
I think it's what you kill the boss with
---
Right on. Well, I don't want to play on a team. So I'm making the decision to fuck right off and not come back until there's game modes geared towards solo play.
---
Yep
---
Rare rewards may only drop once per day. So if you are only interested in getting the rare rewards and you already reached elder tier, there is no reason to do that daily op again (even if you didn't get any rare rewards - it can happen).
---
If you agree with him, why did you make your OP?
---
Almost all of them are gone.  I could probably get rid of a ton of melee perks, but if they buff melee I will...what...use melee? Probably not.  Unless I get a bloodied war glaive.  Now I’m torn about the couple dozen (including maxed as 3) cards that I had sworn to hang on to
---
Probably the 10mm; that's the only small one I can think of.
---
Oh Hi, Nuka I love your vids!
---
Aw man, that would make me sad. I guess it doesn't really apply to the target audience of fallout games, but I still think it is a ton of fun
---
I did ;)
---
I use like 3 weight based perks, the rest are focused around combat, survivability, and mutations. I can play at sub 20% health and tank pretty much anything as long as I pay attention to my health. Builds are super important, specially now with One Wasteland.
---
found a bloody explosive railway rifle in a vendor for 5k caps a few days ago, its not in the vendor anymore.
---
[](/XLR8TER)I need an event that doesn't run at 13 fps on minimum settings on my over recommended spec computer. Daily ops isn't giving me that.
---
This is the tenth post on this today.
---
I have had great success with sharp players daily. Elder only and once by only 11 seconds! &gt;8 still &gt;8 :)
---
Even bethesda themselves said they are working on fixing the new player experience as its unplayable right now we have shit ton of post about it and you still go against it XDDDD
---
I completed it already 4 times, and did bring stimpacks, but I assure you that the enemies do not decloak even for a second while autogunning me smack in the face for me.
---
I think 50 every 50 lvls is too much, I'd prefer to see 50 coins every time you unlock a new slot
---
Shhhhh.
---
i find the best thing to do is kill them.
---
You need some new material :)
---
Now if only your money could by you friends and a worthwhile personality you’ll have it all.
---
After the first day of reading 20+ posts of people screaming that the Daily Ops were "bugged" because the enemies wouldn't die (because they missed the part about melee being needed to kill them!), I just assume that any bug in the game now is a player not understanding something.
---
Awesome. Thanks!
---
Yeah, anyway, be smg is a keeper too
---
It's not so bad, if your crosshair turns red, just shoot!
---
cause i was being sarcastic.
---
Have you even ever played a DOOM game?  If you think 76 is too hard, you wouldn't make it past the main menu in DOOM.
---
You still could have played what you have time for, progressed through and then bought the remaining ranks at the end and saved yourself some atoms (or money if you didn't just have tons of atoms saved up). In the end its up to you to spend your money on what you want just like its up to the guys that sit in mom's basement and play to decide what to do with their life. BTW, I have a job and family and finished the last season early without buying rank, so its possible without being a hermit.
---
Get Schwifty!
---
You mean like everything else in the game? Lol
---
Yeah I’ve had that happen to me already
---
OP said sub machinegun
---
I have 6 kids a wife and work 60 plus hours as a lumber yard manager and still have time to play. So let’s not say that everyone that doesn’t pay for all rewards are sitting in mommy’s basement drinking juice boxes. Some of us would rather save our money and just easily grind the season out for free rewards instead of paying for those rewards.
---
If I kill you and take your junk, it's my junk now, I can do what I want with it.
---
Now, if some sort of PvP was initiated if you stole someone's loot bag who died doing regular PvE things, that would be fun.
---
Or even just a gun bash. It doesn’t have to be a melee weapon. Just a melee attack.
---
I think people are completely misunderstanding this post. OP clearly states that he isn’t necessarily annoyed with the complaints but more with the fact that nowadays the sub-reddit is like 90% post about complaining (or at least 90% of the post that are “Hot.”) I see where he is coming from. The middle part of the post where OP breaks down how hypocritical the community can be sometimes is down right comical to me because it is true. Every time things change and gives us something we want, a huge part of the community complains cuz it’s not exactly how they wanted it. 
---
A good example is One Wasteland. People complained about the game being an absolute joke in terms of difficulty, with people being able to Solo the endgame raid boss in like 40 seconds, then the second it is revealed that the game will become more challenging people complain. There is legitimate criticism such as level 30-40 being incredibly difficult, which Bethesda has now acknowledged and said they will release a hotfix for soon, but I’ve seen at least 20 post about that single piece of information in the last few days.
---
When things need fixed then complaining is 100% valid, but it does seem like all the post that reach “Hot” status are complaining post, or post complaining about complaining ironically enough.
---
I know you dont believe me and Im not gonna try convince you either, but I did play professionally a few years back and yes, I confirm, the only shit worse than this game, is the fucking fanboys. Im out already uninstalled this shit see u.
---
Dope you get it from the ops or acp?
---
I would use only one point of demolition expert at most. Ever since they nerfed explosive legendary modifier, it is nowhere near as effective as it used to be, may not be worth it anymore for the relative gain. Gunsmith would be a good choice, as is scrapper and power user.
---
nice, would you go with the BOS medical goggles too?
---
Do your own research then.
---
tested it with a ultracite gatling laser - got no cores as reward. tested it with a prime ultrcite gatling laser and got reward
---
looks like prime weapons get the correct ammo more often (everytime in my case)
---
it seems other player get fusion cores as reward too
---
I had it drop on the lowest tier (5% chance).
---
If you are wearing power armor, you cannot have limbs crippled at all.
---
Yes foodbuilds should always have pacifist on. 
---
You would think they would all have learnt by now....
---
If you own a digital copy you pay for the licensing rights to that item, goodluck fighting that one.

Sarcasm doesn’t always convey well over text. Which is why it seemed at first glance that you missed his point. 
---
Hence the ‘whoosh’.
---
Yeah, her and I have been over this. I’ll keep trying to get her to do it, but I don’t think she ever will. Whatever, ya know? She’s fine playing on private. So she misses out on some of the more fun aspects of the game, (silly players, fun camps, big events...) if she doesn’t care, big deal. I just like that I get to explore the wasteland with her at all.
---
What's with the power connectors on the floor? Or is that just there for decor as well lol
---
My point is that they're not doing what they're supposed to, the event isn't impossible because of that though
---
Oh. I just noticed it 30 mins ago and It seemed very wholesome
---
i really don't care if you guys got it or not.
---
Sometimes you have to break a few eggs to make an omelette
---
Oof, seasonal events like this are a huge part of the longevity of online games.
---
I look forward to Destiny 2's halloween event every year, and despite them having to delay the latest expansion by 2 months, they're still having the event.
---
Yes with the PPK little james bond blammer
---
I've got all three in mine and I love it. I'm freaking invincible in power armor even though I've only got like 15% health.
---
I always get a ton of legendaries during a normal play through. It’s so easy, just like you said
---
I feel ya bud. My main is a Bloodied Heavy Gun Power Armor DPS machine that rocks full T-65 and a Gauss Minigun. While ammo factory boosted my bullet production dramatically, I haven't bothered to use him since I figured this out on my bloodied commando.
---
they ruined it of course I’m gonna complain
---
People trying to help me????? With saying that if you dont use an ingame bug that arent listen anywhere, your build suck? Is that the help? Thats the time I talked negative to someone "trying to help". Doesnt matter how salty I am, or the way I say it, because what I am saying is facts.
---
So this is my first time playing fallout 76, what do you guys think of this build I'm aiming for? Going for stealthy rifle/sniper at range and a melee up close
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=df711031&amp;d=s52ss2si2sj2pd2pk2p62pr2pl2eo2ee2cr0i12i91i44ic4ar2sa0
---
I was about to say the same thing.
---
most likely just backwards compatibility.
---
What's it's 2nd and 3rd legendaries? Chances are it's magic like the others stalkers DB. 
---
"Magic" traits are instigating, junkies, stalkers, 33 vats, limb damage, bashing damage and/or blocking on armor. The only work on shotguns in vats or ~200 fire rate weapons, they don't stack other than the armor can boost the weapon. 
---
Anyways enjoy it while it lasts. Who knows when it'll patched.
---
You can only get it from ops
---

---
Here you go, went for a 2 HD build using All Rise - a standard legendary weapon anyone could get as a drop. Power attack head shots took them out in 3 hits tops.  Midway through put back my unarmed weapon on without changing the perks and cleared the rest of the way, that took longer.  No downs,used maybe 10 stimpacks total.  
---
Figured you might be upset I went with a 2HD weapon vs. a 1HD weapon (with the higher base damage), pulled out a 3* Ghoul Slayers Baton, no mods on it, +15% vs. ghouls, -15% when blocking, +50% limb damage.  Doing half damage to a 2HD meant more attacks, but since I swung faster it took equal amounts of time,. But it was fine, I’m sure if I had equipped Incisor where I got to ignore armor I would have done better, as if I had not been herbivore and could have benefited from at least a +20% damage steak.  Modding the weapon to make it electrical would have helped, as Super Mutants have higher DR than ER too.  
---
But all in all, yes, it was doable, as a rushing in melee character, not optimized to actually be focused on melee (vs Unarmed that I normally am).  Even more legendary perks would help, getting myself onto a team and using “Take one for the team” even at rank one, even solo, would have increased my damage output.  I did stay out of 3rd person view, since that is terrible for trying to get accurate headshots ( I don’t know why).  Power attacks to the head are key for maximizing damage.
---
Noticed this as well. I run commando and have been doing "burst" fire to see what happens and it's more effective for sure.
---
I’ve been working on it. But for these kinds of posts, it comes across as polite to those that choose to believe it is polite and snarky to those that choose to believe it is snarky. 
---
And I never have to reveal to them which it is. ;)
---
Link?
---
edit: NVM, found it, HOT DAMN!

---
iirc the glaive is added to the purveyor pool.
---
I think players just like to complain.
---
pistols are dead now so its pointless
---
Agreed. Heavy gunners got the shaft with this. I'm curious to see how my plasma caster character works out.
---
Mine is like absolutely higher than 90%.
---
It's as if the percentages are switched.
---
Idk why I equipped it.
---
I don't think that's the 'nerf' that most people are complaining about. The nerf is the change to the damage calculations. Even if the other change in this patch of increasing the levels of enemies in low level areas wasn't applied players would still be affected by the increased time to kill/more ammo used/more wear on weapons/potentially more player damage taken and wear on armor.
---
Sure the increased levels of enemies are exacerbating peoples experience with the damage changes, and yes the offshoot of that is more xp, but I don't think conflating the two is helpful.
---
Misunderstanding the myriad of various interpretations of the instructions? Don't be a condescending shit.
---
Google aimbot Xbox. I don't know if they work Don't use them myself but they certainly exist.
---
I can understand the frustration of previous builds being less effective and the One Wasteland update changing how people play but I am loving the update. It’s more challenging and having to tweak my build and use perks I’ve never thought of before is really  cool. It seems like there are more potential builds and useful weapons and armor and legendary perks change it up a lot too. Overall I think it’s a great update and brings a new future to the game.
---
I hope they don't change, I have the ones I want and I spent hundreds of coins to get them that way.
---
if you did it within an hour of reset (freezing supermutants) it hadn't reset. it resets an hour after reset.
---
if it was invisible blood eagles though.. no idea!
---
Nah, they really don't owe you. You can make all of the demands that you want. They want you to keep paying $100 annually. Do they owe you for what you paid already? No. You got what you paid for. So why do they keep updating the game? Because you'll keep paying, not because you already did.
---
Its not? I play on an 4-5 year old gaming laptop and it goes just fine. Also, they fixed the ash piles causing stupid amounts of lag.
---
But read that PSA from that dude! It's the perfect game and no one should complain!
---
What's the point of even having them if you can't even use them.  I don't think they'll be changed.  They were dealt with in the pts.
---
No I think I will be.
---
And we really don’t care if this game is built specifically to your needs or not. Nor do we really need you to **announce your intentions.**
---
You’re playing a video game, not dating my daughter.
---
Nah they really owe everyone who bought. Nobody who bought this game “ got what they paid for “. Again please go eat your half cooked steak because that’s what you’re arguing for here. The ability of companies to give you half what you paid for. Sucker.
---
Yes they have.
---
Nuke deathclaw island, open a fissure to the deathclaw spawning grounds (much like opening the mine for acp). Waves of deathclaw "broodlings" and a massive deathclaw matriarch queen the size of a behemoth or Earl. Make the Forrest nuke event the scariest thing ever.
---
Could very well be the case then! I have the figure of 2000 atoms lodged in my head concerning season one, for some reason. Maybe some people just rounded up because it was easier to remember.
---
Hmm I mean I tried two different ones I guess the 2* is q/bash and the other is q/limb/25vats.. so maybe it is magic.. also why I’m making this new character to try a default double barrel I can’t see those being the reason however that may stink if that’s what comes to be the truth.
---
With the nuke hit, the leader of the pack changes from wolves to Deathclaws with the alpha male and female you must take down.
---
Then the power will op af.
---
T65 tank pretty good already and now dump a lot of underarmor stat.
---
This literally was one time when we could honestly and unironically say **”It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.”**

Infinite scrap storage meaning you can keep more guns, armor and ammunition stocked, as well as craft as much as you want! Being able to trade in higher yeilds of resources because you can accept a duped 10k of resources.
---
I got the same, very disappointing. Glad to know I'm not the only one
---
GET 'EM OUT, BOYS!! I DID IT!!
---
I've already started to decorate my camp for this event I genuinely do not know why Bethesda keep dropping the ball with this game
---
Let me guess, you only get invited to parties when you buy the booze. Because your personality does not make you very likable.
---
&gt; It doesn't force people to get on and wait. Because there are other things to do in that hour.
---
yes it does.  one of those things absolutely has to be true.
---
if Beth made the times different on purpose, there is a 100% chance that they did it for some nefarious (low impact) reason.  most likely a time code was just input wrong and they will fix it to be aligned with the rest of the game.
---
and no, it doesnt matter "how big of a deal" it would be for the company to be forcing one of those three things i mentioned.  its the principle.  if the daily Op reset was 6 hours later would your opinion be the same?  how about if there was 4 different challenges that all had different reset times?  do you see where im going here?
---
Yeah I spend a bunch of points on one and now I regret it. It didn't realize how hard it will be to lvl them up.
---
many thanks. this should help
---
Who ever gave up those weapons for this outfit isn’t missing them.   I’m sure they have more duped in their inventory.
---
\*You have been enlightened\*
---
The one item you missed repair kits. That would make them ( more) excellent Even only a chance for them.
---
I think your asking way to much of people. It’s 2020 all people wanna do is complain.
---
No one get the struggle being gangbang by a bunch of gutsy and those protectron start menacing theme.
---
I’d like to use that eventually when I grind the rep.. does that thing use the shotgun dmg perks?
---
Hz is frequency my friend not latency
---
I think they are doing a fantastic job with being way understaffed. Big props to them.
---
Loved one Wasteland and love this new update. Looking forward to BoS and shelters.
---
I agonized about it for a few days, but ended up jumping in this morning. No regrets. I'm fairly certain I'm invincible now so even if something marginally better comes along I don't think it'll matter much. At least for me .
---
So...variety has been decreased
---
I was able to make a plate of pizza rolls while waiting for the second shot to pop off.
---
I give things away for free and I help other players. I get complaints all the time. I don’t understand?
---
But this isn’t a reasonable critique. One new feature doesn’t suit your chosen playstyle. 
---
I’ve never seen Miller say this game was infallible either. 
---
You’re angry. Cool. So move on to something more suited to your needs. 
---
Or are you enjoying the arguments?  If so, please continue.
---
Working in the creative industry (as I do) you should understand the term 'constructive criticism' and thats regardless if its intended as that or not. Yes you do get people who leave ridiculous things for the sake of it (less often than most assume) but there is always a truth behind every statement. Being able to take that onboard will take you a long way :) 
---
Not everyone is able to communicate in a civil manor, unfortunately. Obviously you don't have to respond to these people but that doesn't mean you shouldn't listen.
---
I already lost 300 perk points to lost cards and some build changes, what's another 84 levels if they come out with any interesting cards.
---
"They need to make money..."
---
Well...what about the 70 bucks they charged waaaay too many ppl for waaay too long?!
---
They could've gone the early-access route,
---
saying: "Look folks, we know this game has problems! So we charge you only 30 bucks if you buy now, because we have a vision for this game and want it to be thriving down the line with YOUR help, all you loyal Beth/Fallout fans.
---
It might be lackluster now, but just bare with us."
---
But no. They went the greedy, deceiving corpo route, misleading their fan base and trying to profit of their reputation and the Fallout brand name alone.
---
Did you know they recently thanked EA for f****** up Anthem so hard?
---
It overshadowed FO76's BS for quite some time.
---
I dont think we owe Bethesda ANY understanding and patience anymore.
---
They have to make up for us!
---
the plaugue doctor mask matches the color of the outfit too.
---
Does it effectively heal at lower ranks? Is 2 star decent?
---
I maxed Ammo Factory. That has immediate and lasting changes on my game flow. I haven't decided on the others yet. I'm not holding back due to changes but because I'm unsure what I want to do.
---
Lol please let me get on that slippery slope. A fully done immersive  working game that i can play through. Oh man what would i ever do! Where do i throw my wallet?
---
I have all 6 I want and I don’t care. I maxed out ammo one and I have follow through rest are special ones. Strength so I can get my strength number back up as I lowered it for my bloodied fixer build before patch and also luck intelligence and perception. Perception I had at 14 but with that card I’m going to use some of the 80 level ups I still have to move some regular perk points over to charisma so I can actually share cards again being I’m only 1 point and just max out perception legendary card. The others aren’t really that good other then the power armor one for laser weapons I might do that one to as I see they say it’s working as intended.
---
For my higher level play and two meta builds the patch is great. **However.** How is it good for the long term health of the game if there is massive attrition in new players and half the CAMP building whales and casual players leave to greener pastures? It's a live service, and one that has already got a black reputation and struggled, with it's development team always around half a year or so behind it's roadmaps, and you think that cutting away the 'chaff' is a good business strategy?
---
🤓☠ It's the law of the wasteland
---
I'd guess less then the other bugs where PvP was impose-able onto others.

Frankly I don't know what the heck is up with it. 76 runs exactly the same no matter what settings I put it on. It will run butter smooth 97% of the time, but somethings make it chug on my machine like no ones business(taking radiation damage, opening my favorites wheel, or using the quick weapon switch all make my game stutter insanely to name a few), but the daily ops have been running especially bad, and I've tried everything I can to fix them even went and did all the ini tweaks to make the game extra potato freindly even tho I'm not on a potato.  
---
I am glad they fixed the ash piles tho, but there's some other issues with 76 that I haven't figured out.
---
I would rather Bethesda limit ammo drops than make all enemies into bullet sponges if they wanted people to craft ammo more.
---
I was able to get some mileage out of Follow Through on my PA stealth rifleman/heavy during ACP. The buff lasts 10 seconds, which is roughly half a clip with a .50 cal, and it's possible to drop back into stealth every time you reload. All in all though if you're a dedicated heavy then Taking One for the Team is going to be more effective.
---
So much of this is patently false or misinformed. 
---
But have a good journey.
---
Why would I go around collecting junk when I can just kill someone who did.
---
Im not a dick who gets mad when he dies and loses his 800 lb of pixels he had on him.
---
It's... not that hard?
---
Moral of the story is you're an ass yikes.
---
And of course, stealing should go unpunished, but simply picking a lock is just horrible.
---
I'm asking for consistency, and more importantly, the reason I even had this idea was more just to add a little more fun to PvP. If you kill someone and want their junk, it'll be another fight to stash it, add a bit of suspense, a bit of urgency when you die rather than simply "Whelp, guess that junk is gone" because the dude took it and ran immediately.
---
Daily ops are super easy to solo though, except for the resilient one though
---
True. Although I have +60 of em so more wouldnt be helpful.
---
If you die or the game crashes/disconnects while you're doing the event you're screwed. No re entry, all the ammo and chems wasted. And for what? Cause Bethesda can't fix their game. They keep putting more content into the game without fixing anything that's been broken since launch or breaking something from an update. It's getting really old, they should just take one whole patch and having it just be a QOL improvement and fix a lot if not all the known bugs in the game instead of ignoring them and the community
---
Exactly. I moved on shortly after launch to better games that were less aggressively monetized. I still hang around on the reddit and am glad that these people bitching still enjoy it enough to play it.
---
That doesn't create time.
---
That’s what I was thinking of
---
Oh jeez, that’s scary
---
Doom eternal and ESO are getting supported into the next gen, besthesda are giving them free next gen versions if you own them so hopefully they do the same with 76. 
---
There’s backwards compatibility but they need to optimise it more, maybe my internet but sometimes can wait a good 7 seconds for the pause menu to show up on the Xbox x.
---
Try hosting your pics on imgur and not a locked google-share.
---
Friendly remind that tank killer now affect pistol as well.
---
Speaking of which, pistol lack of firepower but very versatile in 10mm and light weight compare to rifle.
---
did you add tank killer to your pistol build?
---
Is it doing well on Earl?
---
Ah ok I expected something like this. I never played in a PA. Only for 2 days now since the first update.
---
...and murder them all
---
but when you hit 50 you have access to all max level armour and weapons plus you can sort out a build and get mutations. So even if they're gonna be your level you're gonna be more powerful. And they stop at 100 so there's that.
---
If you are wearing power armor, does the healing effect from Electric Absorption only trigger if the attack "hits"? For example, if I have the Ricochet perk, and Ricochet is triggered by a laser rifle shot, would Electric absorption get a chance to heal you, or would it not be able to trigger because the attack was deflected? 
---
Or would EA have a chance to trigger before ricochet?
---
Also, does it apply to ALL energy damage, or just some types? Like would the SBQ screech trigger it?
---
Basically, is it giving me additional chance to effectively ignore energy damage?
---
I think the thing to ask is always “optimized for what?”
---
A lot of people think of optimized in terms of damage but you can also optimize for team play or optimize for qol. You can also try to have some sort of middle ground that isn’t optimized for anything but strikes the right balance for daily play.
---
Wait, what?
---
Because I can remember all the new players complaining about the old system being unplayable. You should have been here furring free weekend. There is room for improvement but it isn’t worse.
---
Same here! The perk cards have always been a nightmare for me. In fact, until recently, i haven't even touched or looked at them in probably a year. I have over 150 levels up to use if i want. 
---
So needless to say I'm still getting used to the new update and gameplay before I try to tackle the new cards 😂 I miss fallout 4 where i just pick a perk I think sounds cool and there was no limit or swapping. I get why it's there, but i can't seem to wrap my head around how to do it effectively lol
---
Dion was unhappy with his song being associated with violence
---
Sometimes I think about tweaking my build, though mine is actually quite similar to yours. 
---

---
Not quite finished as the legendary agility perk isn't maxed.
---
the special ones are a safe bet. can never have enough perks.
---
Just to let you know, this is the same way any event is. I’ve disconnected from queen fights and lost everything I disconnected from a daily ops yesterday and lost everything. It happens but we deal with it. High risk high reward I guess
---
Can confirm, also a bloodied build, that it does not heal my rads
---
The part that always bugs me is when I get the "legendary enemy has mutated" message when fighting regular enemies...no legendary anywhere nearby.
---
This is neither an official Bethesda forum nor is it run by Bethesda employees. And there are only three people associated with Bethesda that occasionally visit this subreddit, and they don’t read every post. 
---
You need to go to the actual official Bethesda forums if you expect the possibility of being heard by Bethesda. 
---
This is simply you complaining to other customers while you are out of earshot of the store staff.
---
If you don’t like the store, then shop elsewhere, *homie*.
---
Ikr! Oh well, at least I have mad acid
---
Don't go into workshops with junk.  Cache your junk frequently, etc.  Also, just don't die to super mutants right next to me.
---
Sure, but if I want that junk back, I can't do anything because you decided fast travelling away was better than actually fighting for it, or you simply went into passive right after. Or the game didn't let me seek revenge and you won't fight back.
---
It's simply not fair, and adding the bounty would add a little fairness, and a little suspense into PvP. Is that junk worth a bounty? Will he be able to kill me after I take it? How fast can I run before he'll catch up to me? Or until I find a place to set down my tent?
---
It just adds a little, something, to PvP, more than just who shoots second wins and gets all the spoils.
---
While the other guy summed up the pros and cons pretty nicely, I would say the entering and exiting animation for the PA isn’t necessarily a con, but more of a trade off. Yes, you have to go through that animation every time you enter and exit, but you no longer have the stimpack use animation, and can spam them pretty efficiently. IMO the stimpack animation is worse than the PA enter/Exit one because you use stimpacks in the middle of fights, and shouldn’t be entering/exiting PA in the middle of fights. 
---
PA also protects from all air and waterborne diseases.
---
So if you die just once you don't respawn in the waiting area? You spawn outside? First time i'm hearing of this. I've heard of people dying after earle and getting spawned outside. Or the rare glitch where you cannot respawn and can only fast travel somewhere.
---
this is my only complain: the level-based mobs. before the forest is just a walk in the park. now, it's like cranberry bog level anywhere for me. the dam is now new westek level area with highlevel sup mutants. aside from that, i have no problem. beth gave a lot of efforts on this game. the free big updates, atoms can be earned in-game, etc. this is online. cloud infra is not free. been  playing this game for over a year now. it's just that, beth always is threated with double standards. majoritt of the hate is from the hate train bandwagon.
---
Yep. I just finished running an outfit that was the hunters long coat with the plague doctors mask and the free creepy red eyed cat backpack (whatever it’s name is)
---
And if they made one big patch of just fixes I can be almost certain ppl would bitch and say what no new content. We need content not fixes blah blah blah. Everyone is never happy, everytime they give us something I see ppl post about then they ask for something else or say they didn’t want this. I tell you what I sure would hate to be a game developer
---
I think the point of having a daily ops team is to say you are ready to do it. That announces to the server the team was made. If people join one would expect they'd join the daily op. I think the (in daily op) next to the name is a check mark in a way. I think the issue with daily op is players making or being in a daily op squad without doing the daily op itself. There is absolutely no benefit to being in it other than running the daily. I join one and immediately leave when I'm not doing it
---
Nope, just like a stim pack. Anything over r3 is wasteful imo. Since you cant store them anywhere. You'll repleniah the one if you use it before you get all that hungry/thirsty again
---
I haven't had it happen to me from the queen fight or the ops (yet) but we shouldn't have to deal with it, it's their job as the game developer to fix problems in their game
---
Praise be to Sky-Bench, the giver of all things!
---
Only for ps4 games that’s it
---
The quad handmade and double barrel are pretty nice.
---
Yes, I have a shotgun build now because of it. I get about 540 damage with the mods after the nerf (was cc 600 before). If you do the daily ops and ACP you will have so much ammo you don't know what to do with them😁😁. Fortunately I saved a lot of perk cards and with the new legendary system I can max out SPECIALs.
---
#1 i’m not doing anything wrong. Chill the fuck out
---
#2 it’s obvious this community is in circle jerk mode, once more. Just ignore my post if you don’t like it
---
The blue screen is all part of the experience, honey.
---
From ops but vocal sac from cp, as far as I know. There is one that spawns in the nukezone at cranberry or those groves, but dunno drop rate or whether it counts cuz I think that one also has a fear aoe too
---
Because it’s not going to cause half the players to leave. Or cause massive attrition. I leveled up on the PTS. It’s quite manageable. The old system had equal or greater pitfalls for young players. It was just the devil we knew.
---
Cosmetics add nothing to a character. No bonuses. Nothing.    
---
For the most part, I don't care what someone else's CAMP or character looks like.
---
Hey we bought the game.. We have a say.. 🇺🇲
---
You made me realize now that maxing legendary perks allows for addition of more perks.... :O I mean I imagined maxing the str card for shotgun dmg but all the other stuff too....
---
In my crazy crashes last night I got kicked out of the OP by blue screen. Relaunched the game and spawned in dead and couldn’t respawn. Relaunched again and the daily op auto completed and gave me my 250 score.
---
Same, ony main. But my poor alts... Lol
---
It's 100 gold a piece, you can buy 3 for 300 at the foundation and 3 at the crater. Serverhop to get more.
---
Thing that disappoint me is .44 don't have the bull barrel mod even some previous datamine show they have ingame.
---
I wish all areas scaled and didn't have caps though, or at least not so low.  Level 50 enemies are too easy.  I want 75 minimum
---
Why you shoutin’, homie?  Damn, you just escalated your ragequit!
---
You made a public post on a public discussion board. If you don’t like my replies... *then just ignore them.*
---
Workshop warning literally occupies the center of their screen until they accept and the still come running here to complain. No amount of in game warning will prepare those people.
---
Oh I do that, the problem comes when it's just after an event and a lvl 100 mirelurk king, or glowing ghoul slaps your ass and one hits you while you're looting, or while you cant fight back looting through the Queen's corpse. 
---
I'm mostly speaking for casuals here, I dont usually have these problems because I do store my junk before workshops, right after events, whenever I can. But for the more casual players, this would give them a chance to recover it
---
And for me as someone who does a decent amount of PvP? It would give a little more effort in stealing junk from kills other than, take it after ya kill them, fast travel away, stash it, done.
---
I would say the new content is being able to play the game without all the issues lol
---
2 years later you can return it? I’ve got 3100 hours in it because I like the game and my friends play it. That does not mean it works as it should or as advertised. But hey you guys keep shilling and they’ll keep releasing half baked shit because idiots like you let them.
---
God, it must be so hard to know everything and be so well informed. How do you cope with that burden?
---
I got the plan but haven’t learned it yet . I saw on YouTube before the patch went live and I knew we needed sacs. Good thing I kept 5 of them on my display. But I don’t know if it’s good or not
---
I guess my vampire tesla will teach some lessons today, jeez...
---
and according to that law, lockpicking doors is illegal.
---
With 15 str you can easily swap between 2H/1H/Unarmed/Heavy/Explosive/Shotgun. Its a very flexible stat allocation.
---
I keep at least 1 of each type in my stash, and swap perks around depending what I fancy using
---
yes it is. But i just died 4x rapidly because enemies eat ammo.. they don't die now.
---
it's a little different when you're literally directing your comments to me... Lol
---
Someone bought an item from you that you had on your person? That seems... impossible?
---
Magic weapons have been a known exploit for a long time in game, it's not advertised by Bethesda because it's an EXPLOIT. However on any other social media platform the information about magic weapons is readily available.
---
If you chose to run a magic weapon without any build as a back up that's a you problem not a Bethesda issue. Should Bethesda have fixed this bug a long time ago, yes they should and that's a whole other conversation. The information was there for you to find you chose not to read it or to just ignore it and be happy that you could walk around with a lackluster build and a over powered weapon.
---
Other builds are not broken in the slightest, actual builds are still powerful, it was the weapon you chose to use that trivialised the game.
---
My observations about your comment to the OP is that he tried to explain to you that you now need a build to still have a relevant damage count in this game and also that your lackluster build would have still worked with your exploited shotty, as a counter you stomped your feet and proclaimed just like you are to me that all other builds are broken, when in truth running around with a glitched weapon and no build is the truly broken part of the game.
---
You dont want help and you dont want to adapt to the changes, in a live service game that approach just isn't a viable one. What's meta today can be trash tomorrow so you cannot hold on to your build and weapons, dig your heels in and be stubborn when the goalposts of the game are changed.
---
Eyup, probably would be better to just lock workshops out when in Passive.
---
Make sure everything is dead before you start looting stuff.
---
Gosh, you're just so subtle and brilliant.
---
A lot of people jump to this kind of reaction when up against a wall. As a reminder for anyone who calls me a “shill”, here are a list of a few things I think were bad decisions in this game:
---
1.	Scrap box in fallout 1st. I don’t think it should exist period. If it has to exist it should be available to everyone. I think Bethesda overswung with fo1 features. 
---
2.	seasons. I feel like they cheapen the experience and ultimately lead to less meaningful engagement with the core product. 
---
3.	one wasteland. Wait... what? I don’t have a problem with damage calculation adjustments. It’s needed and they still have some more work to do. My issue is the lack of progression a player feels as enemies scale to you. Example:  I had a new character in the forest... level 10 wolves were giving me a challenge. No problem, let me level up. Return. Now level 15 wolves are giving me a problem. Well that didn’t help... I don’t mind a challenge with my higher level characters, but te lack of feeling of progression in an rpg, particularly for new characters is a weird choice. 
---
4.	removing vault raids (though I think daily ops are a lot more fun!)
---
You throw out a toxic post, tell me not to dare comment on your public post in a public discussion forum, but then get upset when I make a few gentle jabs and laugh at your toxicity?
---
Huh. Maybe you shouldn’t post on a public forum if you don’t want public replies?
---
The fact that you think they did it for nefarious purposes underminds your whole point. Right, they have this horrible plan to make people play over an hour because of this wait. 
---
LOL. Seriously can't believe you think that.
---
If it worked how it's supposed to, It wouldn't be a Bethesda game. That's the charm of their games...
---
I'd use that for sure! Pip boy or just on the pause menu if that's easier. Just hover over their icon n send them a message. There's been plenty of times I've wanted to thank other players more than the basic thumbs up emote
---
I had issues with the burrows signs as well.
---
You get the sac from the one from the grove I fought that thing ten times before acp came. But I always scrapped the sacs being it’s 5 pounds and there was no use. But I started displaying them with balls written underneath
---
I use a one-star quad double barrel on my shotgunner. The only other shotgun I've found that comes close is an anti-armor/fire rate combat shotgun. That one can be nice against non-bosses because it's easier to land multiple headshots with. The quad wins against bosses, the ROF is great.
---
Just go get some freinds and stop being a lonely sweat on NW of all games
---
Has been since last patch before this one
---
This is something I'm wondering. Do I need to run around searching meat piles (or for some weird reason sometimes paper bags) to collect from the enemies I've downed, or are they included in the reward I'm given at the end (so there's no need for me to race around collecting it all)?
---
Duh...
---
It would have been most cost efficient to progress as far as you can until the last couple days of the season, then purchase any remaining levels.
---
You've tried the best, now try the rest - Spacer's Choice!
---
Yep! My character wasn't wearing it at the time but it was definitely in pip boy inventory and not my stash, along with the bloody chef hat I have
---
So I bought 3 woops, thanks for the correct info.
---
srry ill just type what it said
---
That will amazingly good for it
---
I am loving it, but you do you.
---
You love this game bro. Admit it. You love it and you're angry it doesn't love you back and give you everything you want. 
---
You'll be fine. The game will never meet your expectations. We both know it.
---
No way buddy. You make the claim, you back it up. That's what being an adult is all about. Or maybe you just made that up, which sounds like what it is. You put forth this suggestion that it was possibly an error then come back and claim they said it will be changed.
---
The Series X should get some loading speed benefit over current gen just with the SSD internal drive being fully integrated into the design. I would definitely trust Xbox to make sure their backwards compatibility is running smoothly after the work they put into getting their older titles running well on Xbox 1. Sony on the other hand sounds more like yeah we totally tested a ton of games and they all run fine, when they just checked if the title screen would appear. Lol. 
---
I would guess that Fallout 76 will be stuck as just a backwards compatible title for at least the first year, rather than a proper next gen optimized version. The fact that it wasn't mentioned alongside those other Bethesda games makes it sound like it's not a top priority.
---
You couldn't tell that just from the post?
---
It's toxic because you disagree. You still haven't shown me any example of the toxicity I displayed.
---
You're also exaggerating my reaction to fit your agenda to discredit my legitimate claims. I am not at all upset, I'm engaging you in a discussion. And you don't like that.
---
I'm mostly trying to make my point appeal to the casuals but it's clear you're not one 
---
I just want more bounties to hunt down man. And this is a very reasonable and sensible place to make that happen.
---
Lockpicking a water purifier is enough to do a bounty, but killing someone and stealing their junk isnt.
---
Agreed can't hide from tesla 😁
---
Teslas since the beginning did more damage when arcing off the ground its not that hard to point at the ground and shoot why the h3ll would you ever need to vats with a tesla
---
Rad rumble is hardly possible solo. You can farm it and keep them alive for 10 min, but getting even 25 ore, you are guaranteed to lose a couple npcs
---
Found a workaround on Patch day: On the Main Menu click on Scoreboard - that way it won't screw up/pop up each time.
---
For reference: Look at your S.C.O.R.E. on the lower right corner it'll say 1/1 - click on Scoreboard and it'll be fixed.
---
Bare in mind you'll have to do this each time you get on Fallout 76 but at least it's a super easy workaround.
---
You couldn't handle couldn't keep up with my lifestyle. Your responsibilities clearly get in your way.
---
And yet, you can still ignore them if you choose.  But you don’t. 
---
Who am I supposed to direct my replies to?  No one else posted this OP. 
---
Hold on a sec... hey, u/beefytrout !  I want to disagree with you about this post that Cashavelli made. **Get in here so I can illogically direct my replies to you even though it wasn’t you that posted it!!**
---
Time will tell. I genuinely hope you are right, because otherwise neither of us will be happy.
---
??
---
...permabanning cheaters and exploiters, and more
---
I'm glad you enjoy the game! Not for me, though.
---
The fact that you were downvoted prove you upset the people who would do it lol.
---
I hear what you're saying... and I'm not upset because it made the game harder or easier.  It just made every encounter, every zone, every situation so similar.   Level 10 will feel like level 20 which will feel like level 30 and so on. 
---
It flattens out all the fun dynamics of the journey, with its hills and valleys, roadblocks, and sprints into a straight, homogeneous, slightly inclined path up the hill.
---
*Um, hey, that wasn’t a reply to you. Why are you commenting on it??*
---
Me too on the new daily blood eagles one - definitely A BUG 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
---
I do like this game. I haven’t said otherwise. That again, does not mean they don’t owe us a working bug free game as advertised. Now you’re just being a troll so this is where our debate finishes. Enjoy letting companies ass rape you with half finished shit. Peace.
---
At this point, I’ve revealed my intent quite obviously.
---
Nothing in FN:NV killed me as often as a cazadore did.
---
I'm only allowed to comment on things directed to me... I see.
---
I’ve never had issues when dying. I’ve only done the event 5-6 times though.
---
For me worked, not black at all.
---
Maybe you might want to read my other comment in this thread.
---
And then I offer this as my view on the difference between complaining/bitching and feedback.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ivbjor/fix_colossal_problem/
---
That's a complaint. That's feedback. How is anyone going to do anything with that? yeah, players had to ask questions to get more details. 
---
You know what. No company has the time to do that for every complaint someone has. And so when something like that pops up, I wouldn't blame them for quickly moving on, instead of having to read through to find useful information.
---
That's what constructive criticism is. Feedback that gives information. Not just I hate this, this sucks. I don't like this. I hate doing less damage.
---
Yes, but only in the gaming industry is it considered toxic to do so by some people’s standards. Even though money was exchanged.
---
Do you have to loot the bodies to get those items, or are they automatically given to you at the end of the 'match'? If I don't loot a body, am I leaving that stuff behind, or is it automatically put in my inventory?
---
I did as well and I was surprised so many others glossed over it.
---
Add 308 and 45 to that list.
---
I am a casual.  It's not hard to survive out there.  Have you ever heard of castle doctrine?  That's my opinion.  You do anything to my house, watch out, but out in the middle of nowhere it's free game.
---
My unarmed took hit. It's harder for her to take stuff down. But then I plan my daily stuff around the characters that can do it more easily. My shotguns still take things down fairly quickly. But ultimately, I'm still having fun. The only frustrating part was trying to kill robot after robot with melee attacks that first Daily Ops mission I did. That was a hell of a time. But we did it! Just with the lowest ranked. Lol Honestly.. I'm glad we have new stuff to explore. I still enjoy the game. And new things bring me back to it with the same or even renewed joy as when I started. Sure, some things are tougher. But maybe they needed to be. I think some people just complain for the sake of complaining. Like, some people aren't happy unless they're unhappy. 🤷‍♀️ Imagine being THAT miserable.
---
This. Not that unstoppable anymore.
---
At least someone does, yeesh people dont like being punished for poor behavior
---
I mostly just want more bounties to hunt, dont have to feel bad, and its PvP
---
Permaban cheaters, and warn or suspend exploiters. Then actually fix the exploit!
---
Lmao I like the game for what it is. I dont bitch and moan about the company owing me, especially if I played so much that my investment came out to 1.9 cents per hour like you. Seriously, get over yourself.
---
My real question is how did they spawn the guide stones thru the floorboards?
---
Hilarious camp honestly.
---
Well no law system is perfect, it should be part of wasteland  life, survival overrules everything 😎
---
Ya i agree maybe recall card type things like encrypted not sure if you’ve played eso but they have world bosses that are hard that could be a fun idea
---
I used mine through dozens of rumbles. It's about to die.
---
I have no problem with your opinion. The game doesn’t suit you so you’re leaving. 
---
I have a problem with your logic. You decided that one aspect of the game which is currently not suited to you is sufficient to abandon it altogether. And you started off with a blanket accusation that people here defend Bethesda for a ‘bad game’. 
---
In other words, only your opinion is valid, and anyone that doesn’t agree with you is a shill for Todd Howard. 
---
You came in guns blazing firing bullets marked ‘To Whom It May Concern’ and then acted shocked when people had an opposing opinion. 
---
That’s an amazing level of entitlement. And that’s what almost all of us are laughing at.
---
This was a bug ? I thought it was because I died a few   times and needed to reset at vault 76... If I died at the queen, I could not go back,  it was respawning me and could not move untill it gave me the vault option.
---
I agree and as a high level ,I really cannot afford to waste 300 coins if i'm not sure.
---
Nothing stops them from adding new cards in the future,considering all the ideas we gave them.I just hope they won't be better than what we already have.
---
I'm canadian, and regardless that's like the equivalent of mugging someone, taking their junk.
---
What are the actual weapon types?  50 cal lmg, etc.
---
Well, that's more xp buffs for you, this is a good thing -)) I personally bought 12 boxes already since I don't want half of the plans that are currently in stock of gold vendors. Finally having a reasonable gold sink is a very good starting point, I guess.
---
It's like we gave up on that half and just want the game to  function at all or be a little bit fun first.  But here you go.
---
Vault 94's reopening was terrible and half assed with nothing to richen the lore. It didn't even feel exciting to explore even for visual storytelling. Just a big empty husk with the same terminals and not repurposed for anything other than a 6-7 minute daily. At the least they could have picked a specific faction to inhabit the place. Mark a quest and let us empty it out. Could have been the perfect way to end the game really.  Its got a working g.e.c.k in it. The envy of the wasteland. Any faction would want to fight for and control its use/growth.Even its destruction if your talking mothman cult.   Or you know that housing they were gonna give us. Though im still hoping thats reserved for whitespring.  Just give us consequences for ANYTHING. The only thing anyone will regret right now is skipping the chinese stealth armor mission if they side with raiders.  That and time spent in  vault 94. Should have just let someone else explore it and tell me about it.  My bad for getting excited.
---
Oh, wait... you mean you have different opinions regarding different aspects of this game?  
---
But... that’s not possible!!!
---
Only lockpicking gives a bounty...
---
I run Prime Vamp Gatling with faster fire rate. It is slow and steady, compared to 50 cal or minigun, but it is incredibly powerful and ammo efficient. Always go PA for heavy guns, imo.
---
I find in PA, the key to perks is all 3 fully ranked damage perks, the weapon weight reduction perks, Stabilized, Adrenaline. And 5 gunsmith. Everything after that is really up to personal preference. I sometimes drop bloody mess because trying to loot body parts is annoying.
---
As for legendary perks. What Rads is amazing. I have not used a radaway since the patch. Electric Absorption is a must in PA. Not only will the energy attacks refill your Fusion Core, you will be healed as well. Pretty much makes you invincible fighting certain enemies.
---
As far as mutations, I only use the Energy one and the Marsupial for jumping. I have carnivore, but it isn't necessary.
---
Ah forgive me. I thought I wrote it. Gatling gun.
---
I'm leaving 76 because of this bullshit one wasteland thing as well as not having the time to grind that bullshit legendary run again
---
To put ammo factory on it to not waste coins on your main, and to do scrip/legendaries on it.
---
Good to know.  Definitely will use the ultralite then as that’s really worth it for the cores alone
---
Is that why most of my comments have upvotes? Because everyone's laughing at me?
---
I never said that people defend bethesda for a bad game
---
I don't mind people liking this game
---
What I do mind, is that people act personally insulted that I don't like it. That's what I find ridiculous.
---
Just had him stuck in the middle tree pilar thing lol
---
Great question. I did not buy the paint because the nerf on melee was a beast, but I want to know if it can work as decorations.
---
Ward, Ward never changes.
---
He's gotten so used to stealing from foundation for his side hustle, that he's finally gotten bold enough to start stealing from the players as well.
---
first of all how dare you
---
Especially after I spent the bullion on the SS underarmor with shielding lining when I wasn’t a PA build :/ ir would be nice to be able to wear it
---
I don't understand what you don't understand. You, like a lot of folks here, seem personally offended by my opinion.
---
You came in guns blazing and making generalized accusations. That’s toxic. 
---
You decided that because one aspect of the game doesn’t suit you, you’re done with the whole thing. That’s toxic and childish. 
---
You wanted to make sure you for the attention you craved instead of just saying ‘Whelp, that’s enough for me. Let me go find something else to do’. That’s toxic. 
---
No one cares if you play this game or not. 
---
Tell me, what was the intention of your OP?  What was your goal?
---
I believe they're working on it, but with the incentive to scrap cards you don't need they may be too late.
---
Use the 5 minutes when the event ends to grab meat piles. As far as I can tell they're separate pools, so if you grab meat piles, you'll get more.
---
Ohpleaseohpleaseohplease beefytrout pleasesayitpleasesayit.....
---
Yep, it's had free updates, free DLC content added, and it's been supported for two years now. They've done an ok job so far, I bought the game for $60 with the pre-order and have definitely got my money's worth out of it.
---
Trust me, I'm very irresponsible.  
---
Keeping up might be a problem, but I'll get there eventually.  Depends on the pay really.
---
That just says you got busted in a lie. I follow Valseek and LadyD and neither of them have said as such. And there's nothing on the official forums. 
---
So you can't prove it.
---
I made a full health build just to play with all gun non bloodied gear I have on my main.im level 32 right now full vanguard set and cant wait to hit 35 so I could use an aa3325 handmade. No real reason for making it
---
Ah.  It's not mugging them.  Someone literally died right next to me.  It's like taking the boots off a dead guy to replace your own worn out ones.
---
Nope. That was sarcasm. Because you whined earlier because I replied to your comment that didn’t address me individually. 
---
Thanks for highlighting your hypocrisy.
---
Both?
---
I'm literaly deleting the game right now, because of patch 22. It's unplayable for me, no resources, can't fix my stuff, can't change my build. Game is not difficult, it's tedious, because enemies are sponges now and you are constantly running out of ammunition and resources. Yesteday I cancelled my 1st subsctiption. I will be back when Bethesda rollback the patch or make some major changes.
---
Yep, been saying that before WL dropped, gauss rifles, after WL most every weapon was effected, completely friqen broke for some, telsa. 
---
Now, post update, we have most everything has gotten worse and unstable for some. What a lovely day in Appalachia
---
I’d definitely settle for that!
---
Honestly, I've started a new character with patch 22 and having a blast with it. Game balance seems good even with an early game god tier handmade (instigating/10 on a semi auto stealth/vats build
---
Right. I stopped playing for a while and missed out on both fastnacht and mischief night events and I was really hoping for it this year as I really want the firefighter outfit to match the hat I've got.
---
Build link seems off... Special not all assigned, too many perks points assigned.
---
That said.. my thoughts are to:
---
1. choose Either Guns or Melee, not both.
---
2. Junk rat not worth enough, stashes are pretty common, so that weight is fleeting.
---
3. Long shot and sniper are of minimal use in sustained fights. Guns with scopes are plenty accurate anyway. You might nail that first shot, but between server lag and mobs rushing you, it's 6 points just to open a can of worms. Consider Tank Killer, which will let your shots carry a bit more punch.
---
4. Getting crippled isn't so frequent, and is fixed by Stims which are plentiful and available at a button press. Skip adamantium skeleton.
---
They can't because Bethesda owns the Fallout universe. If you own any universe, you will receive constant bitching. It can not be avoided. Because everything you do, changes the lore and people will expect more of the same or something they see as better. It's like owning the bible and making changes... That would result in bitching and then in violence(due to what is written not seen as fictional by many people). Fallout is sacred for many people. Even some people who love the Fallout universe but think Fallout 76 sucks, still purchased Fallout 76 and play the game because it's a way of worshiping the Fallout universe. I doubt they are the type to subscribe to Fallout 1st though and buy from the shop as well.
---
Cranberries are the forgotten XP food item.  The cobbler or relish give XP boosts that stack on both stew meat and well rested.  It’s too bad they aren’t a CAMP item.
---
The damage change WAS bad, at least for some builds. My lever action rifleman build would do 4000-6000 damage (depending on Adrenaline). Now it’s down to like 200-400. Which would be tolerable (not preferred, but manageable) if the enemies remained the same. Now, though, it feels like I’m back to level 30 or 40. And I’m level 356.
---
Oh, well heck. Not sure why I didn't think of that lol. Thank you.
---
None really tbh. Sorry.
---
Odds are you actually are killing things in 2-3 shots the game just takes way to long to register the damage. Hit a super mutants with 2-3 shots and the health drops to a quarter so you shoot again, but try waiting a second and watch that quarter health disappear.  After all this time, the lack of optimization in this game is embarrassing. I don't know why they can't find a way to get a better handle on lag
---
Game still considers the junk property of the player who died, gives them a marker and a notification when its stolen. More akin to someone passing out than dying
---
These were tested and changed for months on PTS theyre not just going to massively change them. Inevitably some things will be added or changed but thats just how games like this work. Whats the point in having all those coins or useless perks if you're not going to use them? Enjoy their benefits now.
---
I know I can mod both. But I figured I’d just upgrade one. I’m only going to use it for the queen. And nothing else. I have a build and weapons for my unarmed and shotgun. I just swap the perks around for the queen.
---
Oh, that's what you meant.. yes.. admit I lock my scavenger collector and a water purifiers but don't even have doors on my shop and home 😁
---
Prime your gun
---
Nothing you just said refutes the point that they owe us all a working non buggy game. Sorry that’s so hard for you to comprehend.
---
Yes that lvl 100 Mirelurk Queen is terrifying! I put a heap of ultracite 50.cal bullets into her and barely made a dent. I was crouching when I shot at her which made it easier to back out while still in the land of the living. She was as scary as when I first encountered her a newbie. I am going to give her a wide berth from now on.
---
Do events, try to discover more locations, do side quests/main quests/misc quests, that sort of thing
---
Fermenting some right now. Bye bye, giant veiney yellow testicles on display at my camp.👍
---
Man, you really are full of hot air. I feel like I should apologize for personally offending you and your game so much. You've spent the last hour arguing with me, and I think it's obvious that you hold a lot of contempt for anyone that dares speak out against the game you feel personally responsible for.
---
Complains about agreable complains then agrees with agreeable complaints. Should I complain?
---
Same need the plans and outfits from mischief night badly.
---
Also, it helps not to call people contentious and lecture them about acting like an adult, especially when you've got head so far up your own ass you could wear yourself as a hat.
---
I am seeing the snapback of season 2 already. People play for about an hour. Complete bulion dalies/score and then log off.  I know part of my guilt is buying building bundles. But at this point i stopped. Not because of how overly priced they are. BUt the pointlessness of it anymore. Building caps aren't getting raised and the bundles are thinner and weirder. They offer buildables separate and with such a large price tag. Well even if you convince me to spend 5 bucks on a bug zapper where the hell am i going to put it. Especially after i get all my season 2 rewards. At this point its just buying things to pretend own it till they shut the game down for lack of players.  Ive fully deleted a buddy list of 200 people and have made about 100 more since then. I see about 1-2 people on at a time right now. thats nearly 280 people that have quit since the games started. Ive never played a game with that kind of friend loss.
---
&gt; Headshots or weakpoint shots on robots STILL DOES LESS DMG than body shots
---
Wasn't that always the case? I swear I thought torso shots were best for robots.
---
I mean are they both gatling guns
---
Well I've no idea, that's the point of the post. A bug or a hack, I'd guess. I think there was a bug previously where someone could buy something from your inventory
---
Yea, lockpicling gives a bounty, but stealing someone's junk doesn't.
---
That’s too bad. I leveled up without much hassle on the PTS.
---
In my experience, one hour after the daily challange reset. (19:00 Central European Time)
---
You can adjust it by getting fatter and wearing bulkier clothing. In fact, getting too plump creates the opposite effect.
---
I think it's just RNG mostly. But I've definitely encountered cryptids overall more frequently since Wastelanders.

&gt;I never said that people defend bethesda for a bad game
---
Are you serious?  
---
&gt;**I can't believe some of you are actually defending Beth.**
---
That was in your OP. 
---
But sure, you never said it. It must have been ‘fake news’.
---
So that they have a chance to get it back and know if they lost that chance.  Point is it's out in the wild.  I allot all the other dead corpses, why can't I loot this one?
---
Bethesda: Sorry we didn't craft our game to your exacting specifications.
---
Never was
---
So if we don't like something we shouldn't be allowed to play it? Negative comments and feedback to actually from the developer push the game into a more positive direction. Otherwise how would they know nobody likes it. You are allowed to like a game or genre but still have valid complaints about the way it's updated, made, handled, or anything else. That being said though I do think there is a difference between negative comments and actual complaints vs toxic fans. Also though I completely recognize that fallout 76 is more of a cash grab for Bethesda as opposed to one of their actual games. They ate in my opinion using fallout 76 to make money to publish and work on their actual games like ghostwire tokyo TES 6 and others.
---
I wouldnt mind earning some through boss fights or something. Maybe like 2/5 coins per.
---
What system u on?
---
The wrecked assaultron has some decent scrap loot too, usually.
---
I got the vault 94 stash box 3 days in a row
---
I don’t understand what gave you the opinion I don’t think it’s appropriate to critic the game or think it is infallible.
---
I'm using them but not investing coins in them.4 unlocked slots..might as well
---
Yes. They are Gatling guns. The ones that shoot 5mm ammo. Not the minigun that shoots extremely fast.
---
You definitely still spawn inside where you always have. Even right after earle dies you spawn in the mine, again, like always. You dont spawn outside until the event ends. Everyone on reddit is full of shit after this update lmao.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha

---
I've noticed alot of random encounters working that haven't been trigging so its quite nice .
---
I’ve never seen a sheepsquatch that wasn’t legendary. 
---
But also, I haven’t seen them as often lately.
---
They dont though. Thats not how transactions work! You bought a shitty product. Period. Anything they do after you buy the product is to squeeze money out of your wallet. Not because they "owe" you.
---
Fallout 76 has given you some of the most extensive and cost effective entertainment in your entire life and you think they still owe you.
---
I was someone who ran with a semi-food build for a long time, because I value QOL over pure damage. 
---
However, after this last patch I finally decided to commit to a more damage focused build. I tweaked my perks and... I still ended up with a few QOL cards in there. But best of all - my ability to survive in this new patch jumped up significantly. (And then I got a friggin' amazing 3* Fixer in my last Daily Op that made almost two straight years of shitty rolls worth it, which makes fights even easier now.)
---
So you don't even need to go 100% damage monkey to make it work. You just need to make sure you're building to support your primary source of damage.
---
That sounds like a fun one, I just sometimes get 0% hit chance for melee attacks even when I'm right on top of the enemy.

/shrug
---
Why even finish with them? They proc vampire even if they have 0.1 health left.
---
Well we atleast know that it's apparently easier/better to simply introduce a new event instead of fixing the old.
---
Oh I know that there's no way in heck a Flamer would hit something 100+ range yes. I'm just saying, they definitely don't have a range of *1-2*.
---
Right.  Assuming you can survive well as bloodied, I'd go for bloodied.
---
He can’t have spent atoms completing it??  Nobody but an absolute fool would do that when there’s weeks left to run and they clearly play a lot because they have the score thing popping up as the play
---
&gt;  Ive never played a game with that kind of friend loss.
---
That's because the game does not work as a long term game. I had great enjoyment out of it but once you finish all the quests and grind a bit, that's it. There is no way people are going to play the same event (be it SBQ, daily ops, blue mountains escort mission) forever. The item progression is not interesting enough to do that and you can't transfer items between characters anyway. If Fallout 76 was a tiny bit closer to Grim Dawn regarding items and crafting materials, that would work.
---
If you are PS4, I'll give you a replacement. This bug is kinda scary. Bloodied chef outfit is one thing,  Bloodied explosive       .50 cal is something else all together!
---
This has not been the case for me since people would just sit in daily ops teams after they are done with it. Also there is no way to signal that you want to do more than one    and there have been teams where we completed it more than a few times.
---
Others who want to signal to their team would have a QoL change while you can continue to do the same thing anyways.
---
Yes.
---
The only thing you can no longer do is glitch through structures like junk walls or the communist bunker. Interior walls, round buildings, and all that stuff still works.
---
I am having the same issue in workshops. I assume it's bugged out because these patches always cause some crap to bug
---
You know what else I want! Concentrated fire for melee. Ppl can shot things in the face....why can I stab them in the face?
---
Maxed charisma? Share rank 5 Gunsmith just for the WTF reactions when people see it in the group.
---
That's not a bug if you DC while the event is about to end. Of course you can't go back to the event once it's over, as long as the event is going you can still re-enter and if you die you stay in the mine. Crashing is not a bug unless its caused by something you do consistently. I do earle 10+ times a day sometimes and I've only lost rewards ONCE because it crashed.
---
you may wanna have a doctor check out your fanboyism. you might be going blind.
---
It's been both ways for me.when I party up with a higher level at times I get mobs that are twice my rank.im 32..or perhaps we weren't in a party it was a event some mobs were 30 some 60 plus
---
Use a gattling gun, a faster wind up and will let you one shot an enemy!
---
In game values and player values are always going to be different and there’s no point in changing the game value. This is a ridiculous ‘issue’ to have.
---
That is absolutely how all transactions work where you buy a thing from a company. Always. They advertise a thing and you buy it. They then owe you the thing they advertised in the condition and functionality they advertised. You have to be stupid not to think that.
---
I for one, can't wait to explore the vault hidden in the ash heap. There's bound to be stuff about the mole miners in there.
---
I’m one of the strongest proponents for improvements in this game. When I recommended the survival tent over a year ago, but it was implemented behind a paywall, I spoke up against that. I’ve constantly made the recommendation that it needs to be a free quest reward. 
---
And there are countless other times I’ve given a critique to Bethesda about this game for multiple reasons. The lack of testing for things like the camp skin was a recent one. That shouldn’t have skipped through QA. 
---
Your belief that just because I disagree with you on **this topic** means I defend this game no matter what is laughable.
---
Haven’t had the chance to fight him since the patch! I guess i shouldn’t have said everything
---
No disrespect here, but if it was a legitimate transaction where you earned caps for a sale, then Occam's Razor suggests that it was for sale in your vendor. If they were going to hack into your on-person inventory (which seems impossible giving the details), why take that one thing, and why give you caps for it?
---
I think it looks pretty good, not amazing. Instanced interiors seem to look noticeably better on Xbox. I’ve never thought the game looks out of this world, but it looks nice IMO.
---
Okay, that made me laugh, honestly.
---
I would love a buff. Handgun main myself. Ill be the guy to ask, could you post or DM your setup? Maybe i can help a bit. 
---
I dropped junkies and went to AA because the damage was about the same, AA doez a bit more to real tough critters. The AA gun kills super muties in 2 hits. Sneak 1 hits them.
---
Tank killer is a must now.
---
Most people have it anyway.  Try to share a perk that's good, but not so good everyone has it.
---
Say it!! Say it!! Say it!!
---
Thank you for your opinion. I know I can just add the prime to both of them. And test both of them out with the queen. Just figured I’d ask people more experience with this topic first.
---
I would love a ready check system kinda like how ESO has it for Dungeons
---
I saw someone the other day with the glass house😂 so that counts for something
---
My build is optimized only in the sense that I've gathered and kept all of the defensive perks, and the general damage boosting perks,.
---
The only specific ones I swap out are ones that concern specific weapon types, or camp duties.
---
I got rid of most of the food perks because food is plentiful if I keep killing stuff and always remember to swap out my building and crafting perks before going out to fight. 
---
I have to repair more often now but isn't that big a deal so long as I remember to visit places I can keep resupply of adhesive. 
---
Only major buffs I farm for are nuka dark, berry mentats, and psychobuff, and doing a run for the mats when I run low helps me to refresh the world loot table elsewhere.  
---
I always keep my favorite melee weapon on me, my best flame weapon for events where I got to protect NPCs,  and always have a cryilator and shovel on me in addition to my main guns.
---
I'm able to jump into any event or swap into any boss fight with minimal prep time, I usually only run into problems with over encumbrance if I recieve too many stim packs or heavy guns as rewards,  at which point I'll swap in one of the many weight reducing perks to get to the nearest scrap station. 
---
Overall my characters a bloodied melee build but dont have issue with ranged encounters. I have the ability to go hard stealth mode but tend to only use it if I'm finding myself getting wrecked over and over again due to getting sloppy with my play style, usually I just need to remember to block more. Overall tho stealth just gets boring to me, as I love being able to use the speed boosts to leap head long into an encounter smashing the toughest enemy into smithereens and now blowing up his closest friends too. 
---
Only thing I really regret is that my favorite melee dagger just isn't competitive with the DCG especially when it forces me to use some 9+ perks to get it to not even half the damage for the Deathclaw. 
---
So am really hoping they look to rebalancing pistols and daggers next to bring them more in line by either buffing the benefits of their perks or merge some of  them and reduce the need for so many if they'll end up still being useless. 
---
Best thing I love about my character is being able to swap to a high end event or boss on the fly without having to run back to my camp and grab the weapons specific to fight x, y, or z then grab all my stims then swap 90% of my perks, and waste the rest of my party's time.
---
While I don't put out the biggest damage numbers yet I will once I finish the raider grind. And I'm becoming tankier as I get the minimum viable roles in my secret service armor. But I'm still regularly besting players who refuse to use at least junkies or anti armor gear.
---
That's definitely arguable if you're into roleplaying.
---
Anything over 350-400 is a waste. That's why vanguard and bolstering are not as good as a piece of scorched, Assassin's, and all the other enemy-type resistances.
---
Weird, unfair, but that's how it goes.
---
It would really help weapons with +limb damage
---
The people complaining are the only reason this game got any better....without them this game would of stayed Anthems less shit brother.
---
Bloodied stealth guys can't one shot enemies, but only because sneak criticals are broken this patch and don't work at all, when they do we will be able to!
---
Mid eye for Gutsys' with them and then torso for all other bots.
---
I know. Being confronted with bad behavior can be upsetting and causes people to take a defensive stance, in this case down voting.
---
Just so people don't think I'm sitting on a high horse, I'm very good about getting defensive in such a case. Just ask my wife...
---
I learned my lesson yesterday,  killed like a 100 supermutants while stuck in a closet 😁 was running  the op solo.  Now I know that I should've broken free from there. I like teams though, much better experience...
---
THE OTHER CHOSEN ONE.  Call whoever makes Todd’s jacket shopping appointments to book us in between fittings.
---
Excellent.  Ty
---
Agreed. I played so much about a year ago and got to the point where I was complaining about various aspects of the game while playing. One day my wife stood in front of me while I was doing that and said "Are you going to do anything to fix the problems?" I said "No, I don't know how." and she said "Well then stop constantly crying and do something else". I had one of those "Damn she's right" moments and never played again after I put her in her fucking place for getting out of line.
---
That is not a PSA, its a guy telling others not to complain while he complains for his own "valid" reasons. 
---
I will complain all i like, because when i get in daily ops with a team that actually knows how to do it, and i have elder rank in the bag, the event stops advancing and we fail because of a bug,it was not the team that did it it was the devs, also if it was not for complaining we would still have 400 pound stashes,and we would still have to travel all the vendors to get 200caps from each,also with out complaining the travel to foundation and crater wouldnt be free, so either you like it or not complaining is what makes the game improve.
---
Well reasoned, very convincing.
---
This is the first thing I have been happy about spending my gold on.  Don't like any of that stuff, and it dilutes my drop pool with weapons I don't want and can't drop. So regret learning some of those plans.
---
Could be. All I know is if every single seasonal event the introduce has to come with the expectation that it is an annual feature, we will run or of room for new community events. I like that they are shaking things up. Honestly I would like something to replace meat week next year. 4 times in 2 years is enough lol
---
I will need a link for confirmation.
---
I love the title of this post. 👀
---
XB1
---
I thought it stacked up, could be wrong. So if you had rank 3 and someone shares rank 3 you get 30% boost.
---
You have to ask why it is even there in the first place. It only exists to get you to log in every day and increase your odds of buying from the atom store. Its mobile game tactics. Just get rid of it period.
---
Because it's a player's junk, and the bounty system is only otherwise used for lockpicking a camp, nothing else. 
---
I simply just felt it would be a good place to use it, add some life to PvP and give players a chance to get their stuff back if they died in a dumb way and a player stole the stuff. 
---
It's like you dropped your wallet and someone picked it up, without police, shouldn't you be able to just fight them and take it back?
---
On my side, it's less about getting my junk back, and more just having more people to kill, bounties are a really cool mechanic but it's not used in any way other than lockpicking, which only ever gets people who either don't realize, or are baiting with a few friends backing him up in case he dies.
---
With this mechanic in place, I could run around hunting bounties, and not only get some junk for the troubles, I'll attract more to myself to fight off as well.
---
I’m still 100% sure they will reverse the animated card decision and I will be out tons of points.  I should have mentioned that in my “how to whine in 2020 like it’s 2005 post”
---
Wow. Did it make his armour better or allow him to kill faster?  More EXP?  Maybe legendarys spawn in it?  How desperate do you have to be?
---
You forgot about all of the Nuclear Winter complainers.
---
I was wrong it was 300 for three not one.
---
PC! Game pass, specifically
---
My stealth rifleman now wears PA full time. If you're at sniper range with escape artist and 3 ranks of the sneak perk you'll stay hidden pretty well.
---
In my experience, Power User can be useful early on. You'll quickly amass a literal ton of fusion cores, at which point you can swap it out for batteries included and forget about it. No need to run both ever unless you use a gatling laser.
---
PA degrades very slowly so white knight is not even remotely necessary. You'll get enough improved repair kits from queen fights.
---
Speed demon is a nice mutation to have with it, I'm pretty sure PA slows your non-sprinting move speed by like 20% which can feel bad otherwise.
---
Not taking fall damage is very nice but they need to increase the height you need to fall from for the landing animation to play. It's annoying, especially if you have marsupial.
---
Protect 🤣 we're done here just accept the fact that criticism and bitching about an update are two different things. Keep steering the conversation thats all you can do
---
Criticism- the good, the bad, and the items that might need some tweaks but overall not a negative footnote to ones patch
---
Bitching- ahh I was doing so much damage and now its been regulated and now i cant 1 shot things anymore, or the slew of cards that I randomly picked aren't working with their current enemy models. Change it back to having designated areas cause i cant 1 shot a level 50 bloatfly when im level 80
---
Welcome to the wastelands people.
---
No problem at all. 
---
Glad to help a fellow Vault Dweller in need.
---
Hopefully with instanced camps we will get some more display options. I think the limit on them now is to keep things within the ability of the server to display stuff. I also think the problem where you can't have your camp close to someone else's isn't mostly so your camp doesn't interfere with someone else's, it's so you don't get two heavily built-to-the-build-limit camps right next to each other bogging down the game when players walk by.
---
Instanced camps would eliminate a lot of that so people can go hog wild with junk displays and heavy builds. I just like making displays for things that commemorate certain parts of the game, like I'm still hanging on to the scorch beater pistol you get to go fight them in the mine at the start of that quest, so I can display it sometime when there's a nice way to do that. Unfortunately I've had to drop a lot of things because of stash limits that I would have liked to have kept for a display later, so that's a bummer.
---
We’d need a high-powered microscope for that.
---
BOOM!
---
Each area has a min level that the enemies will scale at. Go to the Cranberry Bog and nothing should be below the previous max level. Go to Wixon in the Forest and you're not fighting lvl 1-5 scorched they'll be 30. Any end game areas will still be above your level and any low level areas will scale to your current level.
---
I honestly have no idea what your try i have to get at.
---
Agreed, but you're looking in the wrong place for anything else. Reddit is a cesspool of negativity, whiners, and bitchers. (Obligatory "not all" of course, but still WAAAY more than it's fair share).
---
Exactly. No limits means I can play for a few weeks and then not play until the next big update. By god, what an idea. But they don't want that, they want good little boys who log in every day.
---
Bruh who needs that when with fully maxed ammosmith and ammo factory you can make like 10 or so ultracite fusion cores and with super duper you can get double that
---

I use 4 types of weapons,. Heavy Guns  shotgun , automatic rifles, pistols and i swap my heavy guns perks with shotgun. All are junkies
---
The event was not about to be over, Earl's health wasn't even half gone. When I re launched the game I was still on the same team I was in before I disconnected. This is the only game that crashes on me so it's not my fault in the slightest. This game has crashed on me many times, even just standing still it has crashed.
---
Are you and /u/D-camchow sure it auto completed? I'm pretty sure there's a bug that causes your teammates completing a daily OP to count for your score challenges, perhaps camchow missed that?
---
Is it affected by chem fiend or party boy, do you know?
---
Not quite what you asked for but I know there is a drill and a chainsaw weapon in the game which you should be able to put on the weapon displays.
---
You could contact Bethesda and see if they can help. Otherwise you have 22,000 atoms.
---
Or.. you complain the credit/debit card company. They reverse the charge but Bethesda will most likely block your account due to fraudulent charges. 
---
Good luck
---
Nope, I jumped right in.  5 SPECIALS and infiltrator.  What I am having trouble with is scrapping all the "maybe I will use this in the future" perks.  I do wish we could select 2 coins at level up instead of a perk that we then have to scrap.
---
My experience with my heavy was that I only lost a couple shots on the plasma caster and gatling gun (the gatling shoots slow enough to see and the caster usually makes either an explosive or melty death animation that us easy to recognize). The minigun was the worst, that plus the relatively low amount of ammo they drop. That said, I can complete an op with a gatling gun... so i can just farm NPC's for more ammo.
---
The issue is that while you can easily swap out cards to make different builds:
---
1) you can’t swap out special allocation without paying for it. 
---
2) excess cards that used to aid in build swaps are now being scrapped for coins. 
---
3) legendary perks cost coins to swap out.
---
So in general I still want leveled alts to play with different builds. The only non leveled alt I would want is a simple mule to store stuff.
---
i looked in to them for quite some time now and found out that for some reason when you use them in vats and go for torso shots, they do way more damage than with free aim,
---
also their acurracy is surprisingly good
---
i still find them hard to use because they just degrade so quickly that beeing said, the m79 grenade launcher seems to work quite well as long as youre going for individual targets rather than groups
---
they are definitely satisfying to use though
---
Yea I’m not expecting amazing quality. My textures just have a hard time rendering.
---
Alternatively, considering how much the game flopped, let them keep complaining so that maybe they will try harder for the next game, since they obviously don't want to on this one. These posts are useless.
---
thats exactly how i feel. i really want this game to be good and succeeded although probably 95% of my comments here are negativ towards bethesda or their game.
---
I'm too scared to use mine at all 😂
---
Ikr. All I know is he’s up for that glass house and it’s somewhere in the fallout builds. A lighthouse to be exact. Been in it and it’s tremendous
---
Honestly let them pay how they want to pay, in my eyes as long as both the participants at the end of a deal are happy it doesn’t really matter
---
What do you think the best way to contact Bethesda would be?
---
Is it really bitching when they sold us a game that's in alpha for $60
---
Just remember that scrip and legendaries are tied to lvl, so a lvl 50 alt is best for that kind of work. Unless you want underleveled legendaries.
---
Great! Then you could've just gone back in. You not doing that isn't a bug.
---
I maxed Intelligence and Taking One for the team. Got 3 stars on Hack and Slash. I was leery about doing it and took a little time to mull it over but decided I wasn’t too worried about it.
---
I had to log out before it finished fermenting but I would guess it's party boy because you craft it at the alcohol bench.

Gives me an idea, what if there was a mode where we each have an like a 6x6 foundation space and are tasked with building a structure of some sort, where the build space is square to pack as many player camps into a neughborhood block as possible,  and then it's a crazy open pvp mode where where running around through each others buildings trying to raid loot stashes lock picking doors and evading a modest number of traps.
---
Instigating and 33 VATS are magic effects that can proc because of GM has built-in explosive effect that doubles the hit-rate. If you can keep hitting the right spot, it melts enemies with minimal ammo usage. However, the shape of the enemy can disrupt this process and you won't see magic damage.
---
I remember a lot of people saying that they constantly crashed during the event.  I really didn't have that problem much on Xbox.  At least not so much that it interfered with my enjoyment of the event.
---
Why are you on this sub?
---
By using their Support Ticket function.
---
Sure, and if you are going to complain about a game community complaining, maybe find a different hobby. Thats what gaming communities do. It comes with the territory and you are just going to have to accept it.
---
you sound american
---
Huh, I never really noticed more damage in VATS. I forgot to mention this in the post but the grenades become magical TELEPORTING grenades in VATS. I think the game rolls for a hit and if it does, it just teleports the grenade on top of the enemy and detonates it. Found this out when trying to VATS one of those speedy nuclear keycard cargobots and the grenade would hit them a good 2-3 seconds after I fired it and in a completely different direction.
---
I found it boring and repetetive, couldn't care less.
---
No, it doesn’t stack.
---
not saying that you're wrong, I've noticed the same thing and it also made criticals unusable. but it's actually 6 shots, I counted it multiple times when I was testing crits.
---

Sooooo you want a boycott of Bethesda?
---
As a melee user I found resilient to be a breeze. Joking aside, try and find a buddy who run a melee build or is willing to run around with a fast attack speed melee weapon to help finish them off.
---
That makes no sense
---
Yes, this. If she just had a few more dialog lines and like OP mentioned, commented on things going on in the environment (this one I understand wouldn't be super easy). But honestly too, as much as I like the music selection, I think there needs to be several more songs on the radio. If you play for an extended amount of time, the radio gets kinda repetitive - and that's not strictly because of Julie. If they add 5-10 more songs and some more dialog for Julie I'd be satisfied and could have the radio running the whole time as I play.
---
What did it have on it? I'm looking for a legendary gatling myself, and don't know what the best would be for it
---
The whole idea behind low and high levels is gone with one wasteland. Make area bosses, period.
---
A way to message at all would be great on PC
---
I think so, Im fighting a lot more legendary enemies in general and that's good
---
Have you never bought a product on Amazon that breaks after a few uses? Or doesn't work the exact way that you expected? It happens all of the time. Leave a bad review. Return it. Oh no, that shirt I bought is kind of see through in the sunlight. What can I do? I can return it. I can leave a negative review. Or, I can DEMAND that the manufacturer fix their MISTAKE and provide me with a FREE shirt that isnt see through. 
---
Oh no, my roomba doesnt clean as well as it looks in the commercials. MAKE ME A NEW FREE ONE NOW YOU OWE ME.

I understand that, most expert players assume that since a very long time, but has anyone recently tested  it ? Things changes and  I'm not so sure above 800 armor has been extensively. I went eating while standing in the Colossus event because it was too slow...wen I came back 10 minutes later I was surrounded by level 75 wendigo  and still alive...I have 2 sentiment pieces,that may help in that scenario..bus still I didn't expect to survive at all.

Jesus Fucking Christ.  There's another event lined up for Halloween that we know next to nothing about right now.  Is it a new Halloween event?  Is it something random and BoS related since we're leading up to that stuff?  Is it something to do with the EVER SO SLIGHTLY more significant event that happened in this games lore at the same exact time of year?
---
Who the fuck knows!
---
Know what we do know?  That we don't need another dozen fucking threads crying about how Mischief Night was the most awesome event in the history of gaming and that Bethesda officially cancelled Halloween.
---
This. Why take one item that we’ll all have a chance to get again in 4 days, but nothing else?
---
*Like, someone broke into my house and stole the ice cub trays. But they left my wallet on the kitchen counter.*
---
All I’m saying is a didn’t have a specific build before damage nerf patch like yes I had shotgun perks but I didn’t get any damage buffs from bloodied or junkies or anything I had a two shot +50% limb damage shotgun and I one shot everything except bosses so even incomplete builds like mine which wasn’t getting any damage buffs from anything except limbs I guess could one shot everything the nerfs were not that bad
---
same when it switched to new Op it still said i have completed the 3 tiers
---
Ooh I see! 
---
Now that you mention it I hate that stim animation lol. 
---
Good tip! Thanks mate.
---
Well that's horrifying. I would be pissed if I lost my Strangler Heart PA.
---
People only complain ab things they care ab nobody cares when something unrelated to them gets ruined some people even get happy
---
They're scared of the NPCs
---
We paid for the product did we not?
---
Thanks for doing all the grunt work.
---
I too found this to be the case last night, I was hitting the 10000xp score reward a lot.
---
only issue I have is getting ammo for my gauss minigun. that thing burns ammo like it is the POTUS and peoples trust....this is even with ammosmith and ammo factory.
---
Ahhh ok, so kind of a jack of all trades setup than. New update made that alot tougher to pull off, thats for sure.
---
because the majority of people despise the daily NW challenges. imagine the vitriol for making it a weekly on top of it.
---
Haven’t made any choices yet. Thinking of leveling an alt specifically for ammo crafting. This would save me a legendary perk slot on multiple characters.
---
I agree on all points, although 30 rounds from a lvl 50 kitted smg should kill a lvl 50 scorched whether or not you've got the perks to improve the dmg...no one likes legit bullet sponges.
---
This disappoints me...ever since starting a few months ago was waiting to get those decor plans, decorating my camp, and having a Halloween event...I mean this one makes the least sense as it is practically part of the lore due to the date the bomba fell...
---
And if you interrupt it by fast traveling it starts over till it finishes.
---
You’re gonna clear out the entire vault before you get all of those turned in
---
yes its funny with the possible time delay :D
---
and well i used a junkies m79 and a junkies auto grenade launcher and both have the "+10damage while aiming" effect aswell 
---
i fought some level 50 super mutants at grafton steel and was oneshotting them with vats torso shots (provided the grenades actually hit the target and not the surrounding area)
---
however when i was manually aiming i couldnt kill them in one shot even when i saw that the grenade directly hit the body
---
There's a lot of tips posted so far about QOL perks and switching to damage, etc. As I switch between my different level characters, gear definitely helps and you have to be patient for that, but i would argue tactics matter more now. I don't charge into fights anymore (my low level melee assassin does...she's nuts)  I never cared for grenades and mines. Now I do. It's great to soften up your victims. I kite enemies more now. Use exploding cars wisely now instead of just for fun. I go John Wick and pick up dead enemies missile launchers, fire them, then scrap them.  Put my favorite weapon away and experimented with 3 or 4 that I haven't used in months and have been pleasantly surprised. Just have to experiment a lot.. As far as ammo...i ditched a lot of stuff I didn't need so i could carry more and now loot/scrap/craft like a fiend. And don't be afraid to team up with someone...once in awhile..not all the time. Lol
---
i would argue that the Travel Agent would be a good one to share (in retrospect i share it on my character build anyway) since no matter who you join up with in a team, people will always be fast traveling to places and it helps them spend a little less to get there in my opinion
---
Uhhhhh.... phrasing?
---
Like seriously, some of us are children.
---
if they do it should just be play 3 NW games
---
Right on. For me personally it seems instead of 1 shot it's 2-4 but there are also some weird enemies. I seem to be able to take down level 100 mutants with less shots than level 75s which seem to be the tankiest. My guess was they might have DR curves swapped on those.
---
There was never 1 set interior for it, the interior rotated between 3. Idk which one it is now since I never did the vault raids
---
Hmmm ima have to mess around with it. I swear i was getting more xp when players have inspirational shared, i usually run rank 3 when im on teams. Will have to pay closer atttention.
---
Lucky. All I’ve gotten are 2 sign plans and a stash box
---
Well, I am using them at base level currently. I just think given their track record so far, they may add more or alter them and considering I liked my build to begin with, I’m taking my time to consider my options before I go all in.
---
Ah okay. Good to know. Thanks!
---
Long term viability of any game depends on new players joining and spreading the word. This is why the game is on Game Pass and elsewhere. You don't have a strong grasp of economics.
---
This is why I prefer to team up with people I actually know and can communicate over mic.  Being able to give verbal guidance *(“Okay, the boost is almost complete. On my mark, get ready to rush past the mobs at the door and let’s head left along the upper level to get to Bravo. And...... Go!!”)* makes a lot of difference.
---
Well that's good to know. My grandmother plays it on Gamepass and I'd like to get her a permanent copy for $20 next sale.
---
People have been trading legacies and godrolls for them so you should probably trade them if you don’t like it
---
Fuuuuuu. To me, this is more annoying than most current bugs (settler forager not giving quest for example). Visually it interrupts tremendously and will only get worse as you level in season.
---
It would've worked if you had so
---
He’s gonna say the thing!!
---
If people cry over an extra optional challenge that's their problem. Its been well established and statistically proven you don't even need to do NW. I bet the same applies to Daily Ops, its just a nice thing to have
---
Only thing is my thighs chafe without boxer briefs in a walking + sweaty environment and if that happens, the stinging is literally debilitating. I'd be the one fucker happily washing his drawers in the river. And for the record I'm in good shape it's just my build.
---
What really gets me is the complaining over one wasteland.  People  are now complaining that they have to build their character to do damage. I am not talking about doing damage with crazy meta gear in  PVP or anything like that. I mean people are complaining that they have to actually invest perk points to do damage against mole rats and scorched. It seems that some people have been playing this game as farming and building simulator, I mean you can do that, but you still need to be able to handle the hostility of the wasteland.
---
you're talking headshots, right? I usually go for the torso. but even so, 6 shots from a single one is a massive difference.
---
You brought that one up kiddo not me maybe backtrack and read your own comments 🤣
---
How can you do this?
---
&gt;Because I can remember all the new players complaining about the old system being unplayable.
---
what? XDDDD People were mostly positive about the game after free weekend... 
---
&gt;There is room for improvement but it isn’t worse.
---
i mean right now the game is unplayable for low level players if bethesda wont fix it the game is dead
---
I did it yesterday solo with the freezing super mutants. Just need to prioritize the objectives and don't worry about killing every enemy until you kill the boss.
---
Prolly because it was alphabetically the first item.
---
With server-lag and loading-in it is possible to buy from stash and inventory.
---
Take me down to the Mole Miner city where the water is green and the people are ugly, oh won't you please take me hoooome
---
I've done it under 8 everyday besides day 1 with robots. Those gusty's just have too much armor penetration.
---
Yes, thank you very much. Very profound if I do say so myself :)
---
Hey if that's what it takes I would argue either. As a non FO1 player I can just think the only reason to go priv would be workshops and PA farming but I wouldn't know the benefits. Enjoy your travels!
---
I think also it will be great to make like LTM which includes like the efectos of the DOp like exploding when u die or make u extra fast , or only low tier wpns like that would make it more interesting to play
---
Nope. That asshole left right after so I took it from him.
---
Make it right before the wayward with big flashy neon signs saying MOONSHINE IS LIT
---
The patch affects builds differently. On my main, bloodied stealth commando seems to do just fine with a bit more ammo consumption. Daily Ops actually give me more ammo than I use. 
---
On [my second lvl 87 character](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f275e8&amp;d=sg2s01pd2pk2pp2pl2p02ek1ce0cu2c62ic4ar2an2ao0l71lt2lu2a71a04x00xm0&amp;m=051c249f7b3), full health non-junkie stealth rilfleman becomes even weaker now. I am not even sure if sneak damage is broken? Anyways, I am using a magic shotgun/heavy weapon on this character now until Bethesda buff rifleman.
---
but.....MY CARRY WEIGHT!!!
---
Plus it would make some sense lore wise
---
Well in my case, it's because I'm a new player and I don't know enough about it or have enough unlocked stuff available to me to really even think about a focused build. 
---
But broader than that, maybe some people just aren't really interested in min-maxing even to a degree that requires focusing on a particular build.
---
And again, it seems like the 'complainers are just lazy' point of view is taking a wide range of arguments and simplifying things to an extreme so they can argue against a point that almost nobody making.
---
&gt; "Why would you intentionally run a build you know isn't optimal, and then expect it to allow you to do all the content in the game, equal to players who do optimize their setup?"
---
I haven't seen people arguing that they should be able to easily do every single thing possible in this game. The arguments seem to be more along the lines of it suddenly being much more tedious to do things that they were able to do and enjoyed doing before the patch. 
---
I'm far from an end-game level player in FO76, but as far as I can gather, the issue with the game pre-patch was that end-game level players ran out of challenging content. That's a common issue in these types of games, and a perfectly valid complaint. But maybe the proper response to that problem would've been for Bethesda to make a bunch of new, higher difficulty content. Instead they just fiddled with a bunch of numbers across the board and in doing so raised the difficulty for everyone. 
---
It's not like they added some new super challenging content that requires a bunch of serious work and strategizing to access. They took a bunch of existing content that more casual players could reasonably enjoy before the patch, and suddenly made it way more difficult to enjoy. That's the big issue. 
---
The benefit of playing 'that way' is that is how I enjoy playing the game. 
---
&gt; so why run something that doesn't work?
---
The point is that a week ago a bunch of 'somethings' that worked just fine for a bunch of people suddenly don't work anymore. That's why people are upset.
---
I only did the OPs solo
---
It's still needed for queen battles tho
---
Yes but at what cost
---
I’m in the same boat, believe it or not. I’ve already made choices but I’m doing so methodically because there’s no hurry.  That said, Knowing this system was future proof would help me make decisions.
---
Thruster does the most i beleive.
---
And i thought i had alot with 800 damn son, also yes pls remove the cap
---
Are you like insane or something?
---
Yeah, I kept hoping it would return when I left the Op, but no.  So I fast travelled to my camp, still nothing, then logged out and back in, still no power armor.  Ugh.
---
The just need it for the daily, they don't care if you take it back right after
---
Are all you legendary slots full/could you use the legendary intelligence perk to allow you to equip batteries included?
---
I’d say (Known) would come first alphabetically. 
---
The most likely situation is that OP though it was in inventory but it actually wasn’t. I’ve seen no other recent reports of direct inventory stealing. 
---
Until there are more reports, preferably from reliable sources, I remain skeptical.
---
Have you checked the amount you get when making ammo with ammosmith and factory? That alone is pretty much all the incentive needed to prime any guns now.
---
Yeah right now I'm carrying a B2525 fixer, a V10/250 handmade, an AAE90 pump shotgun, Q25 10mm pistol.... and they all work well enough that I can get through any location with any one of them. I even solo'd the daily op today and got elder rank with the V10/250 handmade, used maybe one stimpack the whole time too. Looking forward to another melee daily op so I can try out the melee loadout I set up for that character. It's based around a BSS Bowie Knife. I did OK on the last one but I was just using the knife with my rifle loadout.
---
A lot of people are complaining about having to fix their build or try new stuff to get their build working... but damn it's refreshing to have to do that and have so many viable options instead of just grinding for the same legendary attributes.
---
Another awesome side effect has been that people are actually buying the non god tier legendaries that I put in the vendor... and not for scrip. Whoever bought the V25/250 radium rifle from me earlier today is going to have fun with that one, it works great in the daily op.
---
An then there's people like you bitching about people bitching
---
there's a huge difference between 1750 lost score per week and 2750. if they made it an extra challenge on top of the current ones, sure. but replacing one of the existing weekly challenges with a NW one is stupid. whether you like it or not, most people despise the mode.
---
I did try you dummy, I went right back to the mine to be greeted with the entry way covered in ruble
---
Sucks to suck
---
Feel free to test it out and let us know your results.
---
Nah the whole point of forumns etc is to express opinions good and bad not too cater to the whims of specific users, people forget that nothing is made for them specifically and there will always be content you find yourself uncomfortable with, some people love the game, still complain, some people hate the game, and have never complained once
---
... HOW
---
While a mic would be better, the reality is 90% of players i run across doing these have no mic or no inclination to put one on.
---
QoL changes like this are built for random's.
---
That’s the perfect pacifist build :)
---
I have two fixers, one regular and one primed for the queen, the extra damage on scorched comes in handy. For the rest, regular ammo works fine. Still almost one shoot everything.
---
my big oppsy moment was running into a lvl100 scrorced mirelurk king.
---
Hell, the raiders give you a backpack mod that is just 3* traveling pharmacy. That's 3 strength perk points you can put somewhere else, or if you weren't using traveling pharmacy it takes stimpacks from 1lb to 0.1lb. A massive decrease, especially for someone like me who carries 50 at a time.
---
If it was just mine, I would say so. 
---
I did one while wife was offline.  Then she got on and we did one together. She gained two more after, despite not touching OPs beyond that, and got the third at least at the same time as completing an event (cant recall which, want to say it was a defending workshop event).
---
Heheh I love it thank you brother may I offer you cockroach milk as a thanks?
---
The quest is bugged, I have heard that making a new character and discovering the locations works. But do take this with a grain of salt because I'm not certain.
---
The build is still good tbh, using junkies FFR weapons still work tbh
---
They recover after awhile, lower levels won't get the same xp as you since that same enemy will now scale down for them even if you're in the area.
---
I’ll prob just throw in my vendor.  I don’t trust doing trades with people.
---
That’s a long time bug. Take a screen shot if you at Becky and then one of the challenge not completing. Send to customer service. People have said that works and they get the atoms added.
---
I totally understand that. I only sell plans and no outfits though so I know it wasn't in my vendor. No hard feelings if you're skeptical though of course
---
That's my question too. On one side dupers/exploiters are bad...but on the other now they would be the only way to give people what they were looking for if Bethesda makes the choice for us to simply not bring back the event.
---
This was supposed to even the playing field. Game is still around the same difficulty low level and end game. Low level you're learning, but to get from low to high you need to plan a build and work for gear around said build, otherwise around level 30 you're screwed. This was supposed to make it so there were multiple viable builds, and it did. But if you want to actually play efficiently, and not need to repair shit every half hour, you're still limited to Bloodied, and maybe Junkie's
---
So then nothing lost, you got your workshop.
---
Or do what I do in a group before I start either I look at the map for the general location of both points wait till we're 3/4 the way through the uplink then let my teammates handle the rest while I run in the direction of the other one to start it when it's ready saves alot of time
---
You can’t return software once opened. You would not know if it’s good or not until you open it. This is a simple fact that seems to be eluding you. Again, NOTHING YOU SAID REFUTES THE SIMPLE FACT THAT A COMPANY OWES YOU A WORKING FINISHED PRODUCT THAT YOUVE PURCHASED. 
---
Go shill somewhere else.
---
I support this idea I would know how to rig it in my favor and trap people with it
---
This logic applies to a refrigerator that breaks down the day after you purchase it, yes?
---
We didn’t get what was advertised, so. I don’t particularly complain about the game but people who paid for it have the right to do so. I expected more of 76 but I still love it
---
If it wasn't an outfit I'd agree with you, but I never sell outfits - I haven't even put anything new in my vendors since meat week as I haven't played at all since meat week finished up until the start of the new run.
---
If you find you really like the game, it's worth buying a code for the bethnet version so you can run text chat mod and perk loadout manager and all that good stuff. I don't think they work with the gamepass version yet. They really are the icing on top though, I wouldn't play without them.
---
But it is perceived as latency when the server is slower than your average 15 year old jacked up on Mountain Dew.  Difficult to tell how many boolits to use if the server takes 2 seconds to register and the critter can kill you in 4, so you end up using too many to make sure he's dead, while the refresh catches up.
---
So, to clarify, did they come in and contest/claim it while you were away, and then left?  Or where you there and they attacked you during this?
---
I just started playing maybe a month or so back, and I am having a damn good time. I'm really enjoying it, and even with the new update I'm still having a blast. Only level 31 or so, so I'm really nowhere, but yeah I'm having fun.
---
I'm Xbox but thanks so much for the offer. It is a scary bug! Like I said, bummer about the outfit but I could have lost a lot worse
---
I found it to be quite playable. Hit 50 on the PTS. And there were plenty of people saying the game was unplayable because the level 20s couldn’t fight the level 60s to progress the story b
---
I was lucky enough to get the scout masks to drop now I really want that coat.did it drop for you or did you trade for it
---
Are you on PC? I can give you a set of PA. I have extra t60, t51, and I can make Ultracite or X01
---
The black cowboy hat is a classic
---
Found in the whitespring golf club in the back of a wheel chair
---
Yes. Everyday with two diffrent characters. Bloodied stealth commando and bloodied PA 2handed melee.
---
Right,  but the ragequit posts are pretty frequent and they do point out a lot of issues with the game.  It's ridiculous to just ignore them and pretend that the game is fine.  Hell, had people not complained,  the game would still be the buggy boring piece of shit it was when it launched.  The community should really get together and point out the flaws and things that need fixing.  Pretending that everything is perfect will result in things never changing.
---
I used a vampire tesla for awhile and it was OK, but it pales compared to other options. Hoping this gives me a reason to change some things up.
---
This game is not the exception, nor is it the rule. It's the same as any other game. People complain because they can. Not because their complaints are valid, not because they care, not because they want to see it improve. Just because they have the ability to complain.
---
Haven‘t done the current one cause I’m at work but the others, yes. Don‘t stop for any enemy and run straight from objective to objective. Speed is literally the key to success here. :)
---
You dummy you're supposed to fast travel to your teammate thats in the event
---
The options don't have to be...    
---
1) Accept mediocrity    
---
2) Leave    
---
...just because that's the limit of your imagination.  Some of us will stay and complain until things get better.    
---
EDIT: Also, yes you were saying "don't complain", it's even in the title.  You're just annoyed at all the complaints.
---
As a stim, chem, ECT hoarder you are 100%. Foodies should get grocery and chemies should get chem backpack. I only use travel pharm when in PA now. Ty for input!
---
Take armor penetration perks or use weapon mods for it, also the legendary perks that make the enemy take more damage work well there. 
---
Once you get past his high DR he's not nearly as bad.
---
Farming Earle, SBQ, &amp; CheapSquatch....they start to add up lol
---
The Daily Ops are really bugged
---
PSA: PSA stands for personal service announcement.
---
Look now you got me using it wrong too.
---
Naah, Bethesda has been shitty lately and they deserve the shit they get for it.
---
I did log off immediately so I've no idea if they would have bought something else, but I guess with it being near the top of the inventory maybe it was the first thing they saw and wanted? I don't know, it doesn't make all that much sense to me either
---
Maybe the answer isn't in balancing, but changing how the shitty durability system works.
---
That would be the ultimate troll.  The insult bot can only be taken down to 1% hp at which point it becomes invincible and starts attacking.  Physically and emotionally dominating you into wasteland dust.  The last thing you hear is "YOUR BUILD IS TRASH"
---
Finally, someone says it. I was coming close to making a post exactly like this....this fandom is starting to get annoying. I know some people on this sub that would whine about the way Bethesda BREATHES and how they should make their breathing easier for US to listen to. This game hasn’t had break since release. We’re probably putting so much pressure on them that they are bound to “screw up” everything they do. Some mechanics have real issues. Others, the player needs to learn to help themselves.
---
I only hope I gave one person a chuckle. Have a good one, thanks for offering the help to the player base.
---
Oh no, criticism! Grab the pitchforks!
---
Shut up
---
Yeah I was assuming headshots. I'll try some bodies later today but I'm sure your number are right.
---
We all want in game chat and rp player want pipboy chat, me ? I want the ability to have both, HUD chat is good but if you want to play chill and don't want to be bothered by the HUD chat it's can be hide in a section of your pipboy
---
"When you pay for a product, you own that product (At least according to the laws where I live). I don't need to do constructive criticism, it's my product. If i want to be destructive that's a right i bought with the money I've earned through hard work."
---
Again you own a product ie. Licensing rights that most countries don't have laws in place when it comes to digital you pay for the rights to play the game and you aren't entitled to anything.
---
Better now? Or shall we go further in depth since you seem to be unable to follow your own threads.
---
I'm starting to wonder if I need to switch back to rifleman, which will take me forever
---
Yeah for real, I feel like there’s a huge divide between players who like the game but understand criticism is a good things, and players who would suck Todd Howard’s dick if they could.
---
I agree that the team theme should match what they are planning to do, especially since it can be changed. And if more people did this, then more people would join that intend to participate appropriately.
---
beep/bop/boop.. sure  :)
---
"We're taking away Mischief Night, but we will replace it with a 7th Meat Week!"
---
Yeah, it's awesome, until it takes 10-12 hits to kill a liberator while leveling.
---
Maybe tomorrow, too tired right now
---
I've done elder Solo on the Exploding blood eagles. But the burrows was just too spaced out to get it in time and the freezing + mall size made it hard to get it there too. I'm sure I could have if I had kept working at it.
---
when the fight starts the entrance gets blocked off so no more can join
---
Very bummed at no Mischief Night. 😕
---
We definitely need Spooky Time celebrations in the Wasteland. Hoping the team will be able to bring us something cool.
---
I've been soloing them on elder so I'm not too worried
---
No worries. It might be an actual glitch, and sorry to hear that it was lost. 
---
While i appreciate what you are trying to do, at least choose posts to comment on where that makes sense.
---
F76 is a trash ass game and I quit May 2019 because it is a dumpster 🔥.
---
I still get on for trades ONLY though.
---
So I will happily bitch about how awful the game is while still getting on to make trades that do not force me to actually play the game.
---
Wrong. When a company puts something out they need to sell a working item. If you bought a tv and the channel buttons don’t work, it’s the companies fault. Not yours for buying a TV the company advertised as functional.
---
I was literally thinking this the other day, more I suddenly thought why can’t I do this? I’ve always been able to do this? Then realising it wasn’t actually put in this game
---
That’s why I stopped playing Fallout 4 and never finished the story.  I got to level 80ish and it would take 1000 rounds of explosive minigun ammo to take down a Deathclaw with maxed out weapon parts and perks boosting explosive and heavy damage.  10 sneak attack head shots on a ghoul with a gauss rifle with 3.5x sneak attack bonus?  10 missiles to kill a mirelurk?  That’s not fun.
---
I'm starting to think people just arent reading or comprehending what I'm talking about here.
---
I'm only mildly annoyed that people have taken my junk, being able to take it back is only a bonus with my idea
---
the main reason I propose this is to encourage more fair PvP, where it's not just running at people and tagging them until they shoot back, usually instantly killing you because of broken guns and the fact they always get the first hit in but that's not the main point
---
if the bounty system changes from being only people who accidentally pick a lock to people who have been taking players junk, that makes them actual targets with actual value to me. I just want to get more worthwhile challenging PvP and Bounties would be perfect, however there arent any chances to that. 
---
I wrote this with casuals in mind, but the raider in heart
---
Yeah, today with a gunslinger build (B50 western revolver)
---
This morning I've leveled up twice in an hour just by soloing bloody eagles (invisible guys are annoying) and a round of protect paradise.
---
It does let you but it can cause problems with certain online games
---
I haven't thought about using mods. You can't use them without a fully paid for version? Also, how DO I find friends on Game Pass? No one I know uses it!
---
I likely WILL buy it though
---
I like the insurgent hat too (black floppy cap)
---
Eh, once people catch on that death bags give bounties, itll be as effective as trap camps, which would actually be hurt by this change as well, because those camps would disappear once the loot is collected
---
Fireproof is where it's at. Especially considering these events lately.
---
Wait, where did you go?  Wasn’t it important for you that Bethesda sees your concerns?  Why did you delete your post?
---
nope, wore that shit for 5 years not going to runaround in a game in it
---
They're basically rhinos, they have very poor vision so they just perceive everything as threat and attack. Not evil just misunderstood
---
The spotlight effect is more pronounced now. You cannot keep shooting from the same spot and expect the mobs to not find you. Behave like a sniper.
---
Just get to the objectives ASAP, don't die when you're at them and kill the boss quickly.
---
First time getting on in two months yesterday. I got on my level 360 and got 756 perk coins, I went to kill a bunch of ghouls and shat all over them. It felt better than it ever had. They died very quickly . The math seems to be straightened out. I will work some 76 time into my daily rotation again.
---
We don’t complain about everything Bethesda does. Bethesda has made some of the greatest games in history, we love them. That’s why we are so upset and embarrassed for them over this game. Yes, there have been some good improvements made over the last year, but FO76 was a flawed idea since its inception, and it is still not a game worthy of the Bethesda reputation. At the end of the day, all the matters is if you enjoy it or not. It’s great you are having fun with this game, but it decidedly does not make it a good game, nor does your appreciation of it invalidate everyone’s very justified complaints and criticisms.
---
Today, just before noon, with about 15 minutes remaining to kill Earle, he feared the four of us, and when the fear wore off, Earle was gone. 
---
This was the third time I’ve had Earle just disappear. The first time, he was glitching all over the ceiling before disappearing. The last two times, he just vanished when we were running away from him.
---
Earle left us with around five Wendigo stragglers. I spent the next ten minutes picking up every bit of Wendigo loot and ended up with over 280 screws. After I was done being irritated at losing Earle, I realized that this was probably the biggest haul I’ve ever taken from an Earle fight and felt better about the whole situation.
---
Thruster is the weak spot for Gutsy. Can just about one shot them. Haven't really figured out the others. Besides crippling their legs.
---
That what i did since the second run i did during the PTS lol, imo when you need to rush for the last wave, try to kill enemies in your path because they are count as "last wave"
---
It can only be bought from random-spawn vendors in the Forest. I got mine off the Responder vendor bot that cruises around with the eyebot posse.
---
You can sometimes find them in player vendors, but they're always ridiculously priced.
---
&gt;I found it to be quite playable. Hit 50 on the PTS. 
---
playable for somebody who knows what he is doing not for a noob starting the game. People starting the game will fuck up many times and expecting them to go and learn everything about the game after few hours of playing is like saying "Im an idiot".
---
&gt;the game was unplayable because the level 20s couldn’t fight the level 60s to progress the story b
---
yes there were posts about it and bethesda lowered the cap in few places and problem got a lot less frequent
---
I just pointed my flamer and sprayed away til I got hits 😂
---
was about 10 seconds short. i would have done it but as i was shooting at someone an invisible dog jumped at me and i blew myself up.
---
Everyday with each of my characters, including my slowest weakest character. Love joining a daily ops team and starting it and no one on the daily ops team comes to do daily ops.
---
Edit: if you you’ve already run daily ops and don’t want to run it again, I politely ask you to leave the team and/or join/start another. Or if you’re the team leader change the team goal so I know you’re doing something else and I’ll leave the team and take my own advice.
---
they should set all resets to be same time like daily challenges reset an hour before the daily Op even switches to the new one and now another hour to reset the ranks
---
You are not alone.
---
im only running 2 star rn and between that and ricochet i was barely noticing my health drop at all during the DOps.
---
disclaimer: i use X-01 so i already have high energy resistance
---
This.  I wear the fashionable sunglasses too...on the fence if that's cool or not, but i like it so far.
---
Also if everyone who complained about the game "Found another game" this game would just die.
---
When it ends you get about 4 minutes to run around and collect stims and ammo from the mobs you killed. If you look at the event review though, that extra time is over and you and your team can’t loot any more.
---
This community is just..
---
Would you like to know what that did? It fast traveled me 30ft away from where I was already standing. So fast raveling did nothing. Do you honestly think I wouldn't have tried everything? Are you that stupid?
---
Oh I see. So they get xp as for the lower level enemies than I get.
---

Go to the Whitesprings bunker and use the terminal in the military wing to locate a cargobot. Then go kill it.
---
*cackles while buried in +600 stims*
---
Which is kinda ironic if they truly want to go with the 'it makes some people crash' as by that argument most if not all events would have to be taken down as most have the chance to 'make some people crash' xD
---
I'm not saying replace it, I never said replace it.
---
Really helpful for all public event, it's really annoying to try joining an event with a lots of player
---
Thank you, if only this other guy knew that, or knew anything for that matter
---
Electrical Absorption is my favorite.  I have it at Rank 3 and don't know yet if I need to max it.  I'll have to test it at RobCo.
---
My perception stuff is already set, I have to balance my SPECIAL with my NW character as well so I cant go too insane with stuff unfortunately. I run bloodied builds but still, he is just not fun to fight for shit loot reward
---
You have to locate one from the white springs bunker and shoot down the cargobot that has the keycard.
---
Also, if you stumble upon them flying around the map, you can shoot it down without having to track it first.
---
You can still go in if you fast travel to someone in your team doing the event
---
Xbox! I'll have to try my luck at the next meat week to replace it

Atom shop.
---
Criticism is important for anyone that creates things. It’s an important part of the improvement process. 
---
I’ve seen the majority of complaints include at least some constructive criticism even if the tone is obviously angry. That’s a main reason Bethesda and most game studios have dedicated social media teams these days. Other than community outreach they usually also track and report back what people are saying as it’s one of the best ways to learn what to fix or improve, like free research. 
---
In any case, moving to a different game won’t solve anything since this is exactly how all games these days go. Every game I’ve played in a “serious” manner (meaning enough to be involved in some type of community for it) in the last several years has the exact same type of stuff that’s posted in their respective subreddit/community/forum.
---
Being blunt.  No it's not that simple.  I have the damage perk cards for rifles and I've stopped playing since the patch.  
---
What I loved about the game?  I built up a nice little camp with well stocked vendors for aid &amp; bulk junk between grafton dam &amp; the Steelworks.  Some days I just wanted to relax, so I'd stroll down to Morgantown on a resource run.  When I wanted to be challenged?  I'd head down to Cranbury Bog and fight the high level enemies.
---
Since the update, I don't have a choice.  It's tough fights all day, every day.  The game went from fun &amp; relaxing to ready to throw my controller at my xbox.  I don't play a game to prove how fucking awesome I am at mastering it's systems.  I play a game to relax.  Fun for me is getting to take an open world game at my own pace.  I don't need the endgame to be simple... I just want to be able to choose when I want to engage at that level.
---
Look,. I get how there's some folks that have fun with survival games, always being on edge, the thrill of victory when you take down something bigger and badder than you - you all should get to have fun too.  But not everyone has fun in the same way and a good game accommodates those different playstyles.
---
If you're familiar with Magic the Gathering, they talk about how they have different player psychographics - what they love about the game.  And they try to build every release to give a bit to each of those groups.  Timmy, who likes big flashy things but not necessarily winning.  Spike, who only wants to win and will do anything to maximize their chances.  Vorthos, who loves the lore aspects.  Each of these psychographs plays the game and likes the game for different reasons.
---
 Until now, Fallout under Bethesda has been like that.  I want an easier day?  I picked where I played.  Now?  This update is miserable if you aren't trying to be lord of the wasteland.  The game is now entirely about Spike.
---
Yep same, i have a first gen xbox one. I have problems with fo4 too, some mods i can run on the one s at my brothers place but crashes to desktop on mine.
---
Then you werent in the team with them. I did this literally yesterday.
---
How is the "price" determined? The standard assigned value?
---
If you are a consumer who actively consumes a product, what the fuck do you mean they don't, 'owe you'? -- That sort of line of thinking justifies the early access shit on Steam. It justifies what the DayZ debacle was about. Anti-consumer shit is not good for us and enabling it isn't healthy, either. Yeah. If you give somebody money, they owe you. If you continue to give them money and use your voice while using their product? They owe you.
---
What kind of weeklies do you want to see for nw?
---
 In July 2012, for instance for the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) the [European Court of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice) ruled in the case [UsedSoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UsedSoft) vs. [Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation) that the sale of a software product, either through a physical support or download, constituted a transfer of ownership in [EU law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_law)
---
same goes for Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.... Really, the U.S. happens to be an exception when it comes to property. You come up short.
---
Literally none
---
Exactly. Don't like the people complaining in the subreddit? Find a new subreddit. Take your own advice.
---
right. im over it now lol. just when it happens twice in a row, like literally as i take out the last enemy some level 200+ rolls up and claims the workshop, its a bit rage inducing. someone pointed out they’re probably just covering the challenges.
---
Glad I was sitting down for that.
---
From time to time. Mostly works fine but maybe 5 times since beta I've gotten the empty containers
---
People complain about a game because (mostly) they care about the game and they don't like to see bad things happen to it. Scaling is bad.
---
Don't do it. You will regret it. I had maxed rank commando and Rifleman cards, and rifleman really needs a big buff to keep up. Reduced DPS makes it hard to get by. I got tackled by a yao guai, and I couldn't down it before it got me. As a commando, I can splatter brains before anything even knows I exist.
---
Edit: I scrapped the Rifleman cards
---
Lmao. Have you tried running daily ops with a other gun and swapping to ur mini at the end? It gives a nice amount
---
Hardheaded people just won't accept it lol
---
Y E S
---
Yeah, fire/cryo damage is really good right now. It's the only reason why I still keep a chainsaw in my inventory. The flame damage makes it so the lvl 20 weapon still kills relatively quickly.
---
Their are aspects of this update I enjoy, others not so much. Daily ops forces a change in play style, fine running a power armor again. My bloodied weapon being outdamaged by other prefixes when Iam on the threshold of death, not cool. Iam not even certain adrenal reaction is proccing, stealth feels wonky. Yes it has increased slight diversity, but not by much. While I do not believe it should go back to the way it was before, a bloodied weapon should have a head over the competition when parameters are met.
---
not really, some weapons do work (as others posted above). I was using an AAE Railway, VATS DOES work haha
---
My biggest beef with people on this subreddit seems to be that it isn't okay to actively criticize an experience in attempt to make it better. Or, even more simply? To vent. To waddle through the frustrated sense until you are able to settle with something that's been changed. People bitch, man. People yell into the void. That's a coping thing. It's healthy. In a public forum, it's obviously okay. Just as much as it is your right to be annoyed by it. But the Reddit is obviously okay with it. It doesn't service much to bitch about people bitching.
---
damn.  I have been carrying aound all my valuable (to me) stuff around so I can keep my vendors oline.  This post is nuts.
---
Mischief Night was fantastic not sure what game you were playing but sounds like you just like to bitch bitch bitch Mr. fucking negative
---
Low level people need to hop onto the event wagon and get legendaries
---
That part absolutely 100% needs to change, yes. All of the Scorched/Mole Rats/Ghouls/Mole Miners/etc are level 50 now thus taking a hell of a lot more bullets, stimpacks, etc to get through and yet the loot is EXACTLY the same as it was before. So the only thing that's changed is that the trash mobs are now infinitely more inconvenient than they were before with absolutely zero reward/incentive to go along with it. 
---
It's a silly decision for the trash mobs that at the end of the day makes zero difference and they should have just kept them all the way they were. Even if they DO change it to where those mobs start dropping more ammo/junk/stimpacks, what does it matter? It's a net zero change from how it was before other than it's just more cumbersome. 
---
I don't know what they're going to do to fix it, but they have to do something. A level scaling idea is ok and all but when you apply it this way universally....just not good.
---
That song is so old that my mom was born the same year lol
---
Sure.  If you're talking about electric absorption I use it at base and I think it's fine.  I don't really plan on leveling it up unless I have nothing better to do.
---
I tried, it said "error location unavailable at this time"
---
I need a gun that I fill with junk and spray it around the room for that 'hoveled-in' look
---
I rarely do the quest, 3 times to be exact with the first being normal and the other two being bugged.

Nuclear keycards can only be found on containers in destroyed SAC cargobots, or player vendors

I had the same issue. I'll try again tomorrow:)

I tried, but it said "error location unavailable"

I missed mischief night so I can’t say I know anything about it, but like you say, post-war its very unlikely that Halloween would be as big a deal as THE DAY THE WORLD ENDED
---
Anyone else doing it with you?
---
I’m all for new events. I was taking a break from the game last year during the Halloween event so I don’t know what it was or what we did. But I rather have new events every year instead of the same ones over and over again

Team medic
---
I seriously love that perk. Even a sneak companion will heal you. I tend to hide behind a tank PA or melee and spam my excessive stims when they need. Even if im at full health then get hit it works really damn well.

If youre doing a big boss fight and someone has armor or born survivor proccing the stims? Constant healing. My goal is to share 3 star by today's end. Already at 2 *

I think for now the system is fine as is.

How much do people sell keycards for?

Tried it once. Looted a crate, walked out of the building, got immediately shot and killed by someone sneaking on a rooftop. 0/10 will not nuclear winter again lol
---
It is reproducable, but...
---
The one being bought of needs to spawn in. The server needs to be lagged, and the final thing that makes this unusable to exploit is the buyer needs to be standing where the vendor spawns in.

So it's either, like you said, or a very very unlucky coincident \^\^

You must have done it in your head because you can't get back into the mine. Now stop commenting you're only making yourself look more dumb

Just now

Yea I’m on a s and it still has a rough time

But all this is sacrificed for around 10 times the total exp gains. It’s worth it in the long run. Even if all ur shit is broken, you can fix it. Basically everyone has a baseline high intelligence and exp

It will taste like betrayal and duchess blood

The terminal in the bunker has  a cooldown timer. If the keycard quest doesn't pop then wait or jump servers
---
Dont listen to this person. They are very wrong.

I guess the player vendor thing is true.

WHY WOULD YOU HARM HIM?!
---
Walk it off

This is what I wear with wrap around goggles

But I used it more than 24 hours ago

The rare plans are not guaranteed, out of three elder completions I only got 1 plan. The War glaive plan

As if you were buying from a NPC.

haha yeah, ive played doom it is tons of fun.  this game aint got the smoothness of doom is what im trying to say
---
A lot of people aren't interested in Poor Man's Fortnite, sorry.

When using the terminal in the bunker? Or when using the keycard swipe in the missile silo?

Some styles being removed in the atom shop makes me hopeful, cross your fingers!

May I mambo dogface down to the banana patch?

I don't know why everyone hates on fallout 76 so much, i only got it a while ago but I've played almost everyday and haven't came across a bug or a glitch or anything, it's actually a good game...

Ive tried 6 new characters for abandoned bogtown. Still busted.
---
Both BASH and LIMB are part of the MAGIC shotgun family...that is why it feels so good.  Just FYI with full shotgun perks it would probably feel VERY cheesy.  Don't hate tho, magic is clearly real in Fallout now
---
Same as Daily Ops, just do 3 NW challenges
---
Shotguns , cripple all ghouls , collect ore . I haven’t. Been able to get 100 ore though .
---
Cqn I dm you ti brainstorm?
---
This. I accessorise with the patrolman sunglasses.
---
A behemoth behemoth. One that has jutting parts you can climb on. Like he has a piece of the prison on his back that you can climb into and shoot as a weak point, not targetable by vats
---
I usually see them for anywhere from 200 to 1000. I sell mine for 150 but they go *very* fast so that's probably too low.
---
Thank you for this. Like lmao I feel this way too. I love the detail put into this.
---
A big issue with commando builds is all the good rifles perks are in perception, but all perception points are taken by commando perks. Tank killer and ground pounder are both good af but can’t be used without 15 perception
---
AA pipe rifle is like basic hunting rifle with penetrating mag, cuz pipe rifle doesn't have one
---
Really? That's great news. I've had 5 Deathclaws and they were all level 20ish. They all died, of course.
---
Maybe I'll try again if they scale to up.
---
Ah ok ty!
---
I don't know if it's just a total one off but I'm taking my vendors down when I'm next online
---
Too many people have been burned by griefers who farm you over and over, or those who do it to demolish your camp.
---
If you're on PC I'll help you out.
---
Yes, but it was fun. So...
---
Not everything. Just this last update. I loved the game before this update. Never complained once.
---
I just end up seeing the cargo bots flying around and take them down. I just got another one so I have 20 again.
---
How would it have *anything* to do with the Atom Store? You can't buy legendaries with Atoms.
---
I totally agree with you that voicing observations about the game have helped improve it, but helpful criticism is very different than the hyperbolic ragequit posts which aren't exactly constructive and, more often than not, contribute to the toxic levels of vitriol here.  Not helpful.  So in response, I think a lot of  people try to lighten the mood by mild ribbing - 'see ya' and 'can I have your stuff' and the like is to diffuse the dramatics that are, to be honest, just too angry to be healthy.  Yes, the poster gets poked fun at a little, but it isn't that bad.
---
Moot point of course, since he deleted the post.
---
For someone who keeps calling me dumb, I suggest you go try it and then look at yourself in the mirror. Im not gonna waste more of my time justifying my own knowledge and experience to an idiot complaining about not being able to join an event thats already finished. Just don't do collosal problem then, I guess? Bye.
---
As far as I’ve seen, Bethesda can’t it won’t go into a players account and make changes like that challenges.
---
However it’s still worth reporting it directly to them. Hopefully that particular bug will get fixed sooner and people will get the credit they deserved.
---
Try switching to another world and try it. Never heard of a timer for these like what others have posted.
---
I just tried it on my game and I didn’t get an error
---
Thank you. Nothing is more annoying than people complaining about people. Period. Unfortunately your mostly alone in that viewpoint
---
Maybe try hopping servers?
---
Ah, melee must have some troubles, im talking as sniper
---
I’ll tell you my weapon setup cause I think it’s the best.
---
I’m a bloodied build but this will apply whether you run full health or not.
---
* Explosive Gatling gun: use this when you’re farming or just trying to save ammo. I would not put ultracite on this because it functions as your gun of last resort/ ammo saving. If you’re just out in the world running around killing stuff, this is what you should use.
---
* Faster fire rate 50 cal: this is your boss killing weapon.  Bosses in general shrug off explosive effects and FFR is the highest DPS trait in the game. This should be your ultracite gun. Do the hardest content with this one. 
---
* Explosive 50 cal.: this is your gun for dealing with groups of enemies. You’ll pull this one out when you need to kill stuff faster then your Gatling gun allows. I don’t put ultracite on this one. It allows me to step up to this gun from the Gatling gun in any event I do without feeling like I’m wasting expensive ammo. If I know ahead of time I’m doing wendigos at earl, this is the gun.
---
That’s it. All you need to be a good heavy gunner weapons wise. That said, there’s some situational things you can do to improve.
---
* I take a gauss minigun with me to Earl and SBQ most of the time. With ultracite ammo, it does more DPS than the 50 cal if you can avoid interrupts. It shows more damage, it’s naturally explosive because it’s gauss, and it’s faster. The downside is that the barrel spins. This means you have to wait 2 seconds before it starts firing and have to wait 2 seconds to let it stop spinning before you can use a stimpack. It’s use is situational because it’s so slow to start firing and if you get kicked by earl or SBQ or one of their minions, your barrel has to spin up again to start dps each time.
---
* I take an Explosive LMG with me sometimes. These fill the same role as a 50 cal but with trade offs. If the target can be killed in 75 bullets, the LMG does better DPS. If it has to reload though, the 50 cal is better because it holds 250 bullets. The LMG does less damage per shot but has a much faster fire rate. It does chew through ammo though and 308 ammo is more costly in materials to make than 50 cal.
---
There’s tons of other guns to explore, but I usually fall back on these 5 listed here, and I never leave my camp without the first 3.
---
Edit: as for your question, I’d run the bloodied and I wouldn’t prime it, but that’s just me. Gatling guns do enough raw damage still to punch through the queens DR withouhht needing the AA version.  AA would be more helpful on lower damage faster firing weapons like an LMG. I would trade the AA for a bloodied 50 cal to get you started. It can be 1 Star until you can get better.
---
Just because it's clear why they did it, doesn't mean it wasn't more fun for some people the other way. They have a right to complain. After some complaining, they can either move on to another game, or figure out how to make it fun for themselves again. 
---
Personally, I don't mind the nerf. Sure, popping heads like grapes was satisfying, but I'm not overly concerned with having to hit something a couple more times.
---
When I have extra, I sell them for 100 caps
---
I still do need it yes
---
Yh, on my screen a deathclaw was lvl 100 but for a friend the same deathclaw was lvl 40
---
Its fallout 4ish online and you can show real players your camp builds...that's all I care about. Thx Bethesda 😏
---
Mischief night managed to take all the fun of Fasnacht's "following around slowly moving robots" with Meat Week's "click on shit until the event says its done" in one very stretched out and laggy trip through Whitesprings.
---
The game works. Bugs dont constitute a broken product. Sorry pal. Thats the way it is. QoL bugs dont mean the game is unplayable. Occasional bugs that crash the game doesnt mean its unplayable. The fact that you have such an insane amount of hours is a testament to the fact that the game works.
---
This is like somebody demanding a director recut a movie because the advertising made it look different than it was. "You owe me a better movie!" Nobody does that, because it's ridiculous. 
---
"Companies provide a product for sale, and consumers pay for that product if they decide it’s worth the price. The hard truth for some is that a company has every right to create, distribute, and otherwise market and sell their product as it sees fit. Gamers need to do their part in understanding this: we are not entitled to any game product or service. We love to play games which is why gaming companies exist in the first place. But they are companies. They owe us nothing, and we owe them nothing. Video games are produced, developed, and sold to us as they are. The company tells us exactly what we’re getting, and unless they falsely advertise the inclusion of something on the disc as well, we’re not entitled to anything except what the company actually sells us. Companies have the right to distribute their games and add-ons however they see fit, and we, in-turn, accept what they offer with our purchase. If we like what is advertised, we purchase it. If not, then we can choose not to buy the product."
---
Just give some recent examples of actual false advertising. Delayed features arent false advertising.
---
There's valid criticism, and then there's "OMG F**K BETHESDA, THE GAME NEEDS TO BE FIXED ASAP!!"
---
Silo will start to reset in stages after about 20-30 mins.
---
I had to discover Beckley again when I know I was there before but I did it again and got the atoms. This was awhile ago tho. Just walk around Berkeley and you’ll get it
---
The first couple of days was right for me but I adapted my technique and am fine. I even did an ops as a low level with two other low levels and did fine.
---
Food builds still take workshops they can't defend so they will definitely take free junk on the ground and than get mad about it
---
Please also give us a way to opt out of those messages.  I love you all but I don't want to talk to you.
---
I don’t disagree with you, however I will offer a rebuttal: I ran daily ops with my gauss weapons yesterday and today. Started with only 600 rounds each time. Waddled out of there with over 1600 rounds. Now I’m not sayin if you’re hurtin for ammo that this is the best and most efficient way, but it definitely made up for a deficit.
---
I didnt know people actually took CF for damage.. 
---
I just use one rank for head/limb shots...
---
Ive never considered it a good card for generating damage...
---
On their map, click their circle and click message. It’ll pull up the Xbox message interface for them
---
I think you're missing the argument.  It really isn't about the amount of damage dealt.   
---
 Personally my frustration is more about the fact that EVERY area on the map is now Cranbury Bog level difficult.  In an open world game I like the ability to choose when I'm challenged.  If I wanted an easy, relaxing day, I could hang out in the Forest.  I felt like a challenge, head down to the Bog.  One Wasteland removed that, and worse, if I'm being expected to play at Bog level difficulty all the time, the game isn't dropping things like ammo at the rates now required.  The two days I played since the patch, I saw 5.56 drop 3 times.  I am having zero fun in the game because of that.  It's not the damage nerfs that are the issue.
---
Testing this as well today on Earles and I agree with turtle on this. It’s more beneficial to have the faster reload and I haven’t noticed much change in VATs at all.
---
I agree! Just voicing my opinion, that’s all.
---
Thanks. Yeah that don’t sound fun
---
Sure it was fun. Never said it wasn’t.
---
But that’s part of it, other people (myself included) are not spec’d properly for builds and are not struggling.   it seems to be more than simply “not good gear” or “builds” which is where the confusion and annoyance is coming from.
---
If I can go into west tek with All Rise, a quest reward weapon, and clear it out with little effort solo.  Shoot I retried it with a ghoul slayer baton and did it there too.  I didn’t even equip perks that would have helped bypass armor which is so much more important now.  I’ll admit I was more tanky, but not outside of the realms of what any other player \*could\* achieve.  
---
So If I’m going in with intentionally bad gear (and yeah, All Ruse is pretty bad) but can kill enemies in 2-3 hits, it’s not the change in damage modifications or the gear I’m using.  It’s something else
---
I like to cripple the insult bot and watch it drag it’s sorry self into the sunset.
---
Sounds like they know what the problem is though?
---
Yah!  He said it!  He got 'em out and he said it!
---
I did, I even fast travelled to it and walked around a bit, nothing.
---
You've had two people in this thread tell you that you're wrong. And I'll say again that the even was not finished it was 5 min into it and Earl's health wasn't even halfway gone. Try reading bud
---
did you get the SCORE for it? Because that's the main issue from before.
---
Their fault for not seeing the warning or hearing about the change, just like workshops.
---
I just want healthier PvP man, I'm sure Beth can figure out some way to make them less broken, regardless itd be less of a problem than workshops already are for em
---
I've had a weird glitch where if I rank up, the animation for the SCORE going up goes through every rank up from lvl one onwards, including prompting me to claim items that are blank, without any art...happens every time I rank up now.
---
does it insist upon itself as well?
---
Bugs don’t constitute broke??????!!!!!! That’s got to be the dumbest fucking thing in a long line of dumb fucking things you’ve said.
---
yes but what's to stop people from running back in taking there junk you killing them timer resetting and that just repeating.
---
Honestly I have no complaints for the game other than them removing daily atoms and atom shop items being over priced
---
That's to much lol
---
Progress will not transfer over because you will have to make a new account on those systems, best head a net will not link saves. I went from Xbox to pc over the summer and had to say goodbye too all my beautiful progress.
---
I have no problem with valid criticism, I do have a problem with hyperbole and people afraid of change.
---
Very true.
---
I'm not 100% I even want to deal with the BOS. They just seem like assholes in the other games. Adding them in at this point kinda feels like they're trying to suck in players that don't want to play FO76 but they love the Brotherhood so maybe they'll give it a try. We have preexisting factions in the game. Give *them* content, instead of adding in new factions.
---
Tse is very strong atm, pick demolition expert if you haven't yet. Full health or low health?
---
Ok good to know, I guess I'll just have to do like the OP says and tap'em
---
No kidding. Normally if I binge gamed all day on a saturday, I might have gotten a few levels if Rad Rumble or something ran a few times. 3-4 levels tops, if I was using lunchboxes.
---
I leveled up *at least* ten times yesterday, and I wasn't even really trying to grind XP. Granted, I did use lunchboxes a couple times when it was advantageous, but that it still a hell of a lot more than normal.
---
Maxing all legendary perk slots no longer looks as insurmountable as before. More like only a matter of time TBH, especially with all the extra perk packs you get as SCORE rewards and every 5 levels.
---
That would me my thought, and if I was higher player, I would imagine a lower level player who may *want* the workshop for supplies, would rather me take it and then they take it back, rather than waiting till they take it and then take it from them, since either they may be afraid to engage me in PVP or they have to spend extra caps to take it back again.
---
Pretty sure I saw that you can block ranged attacks in an angryturtle video.
---
My issue being low level I find myself spending most of my time trying to find ammo and then it's gone in an instant because every enemy eats bullets
---
I was at NTC and missed the event last year. Damn
---
Maybe with the new OW patch. But before that give me mischief
---
It's not damage its accuracy 3-4 shots from any distance used to get hit rate upto 95% now it can take over 10 shots
---
Legend! Thanks!
---
You can play in the Forest, Toxic Valley or even Ash Heap. 
---
You’re not going to run into level 68 Suoer Mutants in the Forest. They cap at 50. You’re also not going to run into level 68 Charred Ghouls. 
---
I crafted 9600 5.56 ammo yesterday morning in 30 minutes. That was from starting at 0 Lead in my possession. 
---
There are ways to handle this. It’s just up to you if you feel like doing that. 
---
If not, no big deal.
---
Curious how does the camera help you find bodies, that could be a great help!
---
Power sprinter at base is already a very noticeable change as well
---
I thought my Xbox account and Bethesda.net account where different.
---
Not so sure about this, I still have my swap in cards on my main and have to do the manual swapping when repairing weapons, armor, making ammo or food, or doing any of the QoL things that i dont take with me into the field. 
---
Having a set change out for being in camp vs in the field would be of great benefit for these things.
---
How would that work? Cutting off and re-attaching your nose every time you want to equip it?
---
Yep, got the special ops suit and the cage light bulb.
---
That was with the bloodied commando, now Ill get it with the PA heavy dude
---
Yes, thats right. Small bugs do not constitute a broken product. Glad to know you didnt read the rest of the comment explaining why you arent owed anything.
---
The game was never advertised as bug free. You bought the game. They dont owe you shit.
---
You WANT a bug free game. Theres a big difference between wanting something and being owed something. Try to think about it a little bit.
---
Sometimes windows crashes, thats a bug. Windows isnt a broken product because of it. Bugs exist *everywhere*
---
It was indirectly good for damage because Rank 3 was bugged.  Non-auto Rifles gain more % per shot than auto ones, but on Rank 3, they were the same.  This is what led to the effect where a Commando would basically have a guaranteed 95% shot by the third shot, and hit every time thereafter.  It now tops out at 4% per shot for auto weasons, so engagement distances have to close.
---
You should be looking for nuclear winter weapons.
---
I used to buy my junk from vendors when I needed it. Now with less people doing Earle and sbq, I can’t spend my caps like I use to and used more time scavenging. Was hoping breach and clear would be another source but it fooled me twice aha.
---
🤣🤣
---
In reality the entire player base of fallout 76 does not live in one of those 5 countries.
---
Check the recent player base updates and the contribution by country.
---
Lots of people are trying to show off their junk, however God Todd gave them undies that they can't take of.😀
---
This is what I do. I go Join a daily ops team or create one and when I finish the ranks I leave the team and goto casual.
---
Thanks for all the info mate!
---
I never thought about what you mention about power user. That’s a good tip! noted!
---
Curious tho: is white knight for PA also? I thought there was an exact card for that for PA under INT actually. Might have read it wrong tho. 
---
And already got speed demon. So that’s perfect.
---
Shows how old I am.
---
Somebody else probably did the quest recently on your server. It seems like there's a timer for the player and the server
---
My guess is they took some shortcuts during Wastelanders development and those broke the event making it unable to be played. Maybe the amount of working robots + cars is determining where Ward's equipment gets dropped off and if everything is destroyed it spawns right above him or Miss "can't shake this nightmares" only brings her voicelines as long as the bots in Whitespring are ok (which wouldn't even be a bad thing...)? I don't believe their "explosions made people crash" as that is a thing/problem in most parts of the game but they don't seem to care about that one that much. (ok a map without any events would also be a bit barren as they all have a chance to make you crash one way or another)
---
Thank you will deffo come in handy. :)
---
In addition to what others have said, you only unlock each tier of special reward once per day.  Yes the daily op is repeatable but you can only get the elder reward for example once per day.  The basic reward is always given as long as the op is completed successfully.
---
Oh I never thought of that actually.
---
Canned Meat Stew + Nuka Cola Cranberry, Well Rested, Lunchboxes, Inspirational Perk,  (Berry) Mentats all work together/at the same time. Of course if you have the herbivore or the carnivore mutation there are better alternatives to canned meat stew (Cranberry Relish for herbivore for example). I used all of it on my other char last season and it was amazing at double xp weekend XD
---
I just got a b2525 pump shotty but I'm a heavy gunner, shit sucks
---
Hmm, not false
---
Earle could easily be killed in the 2+ minutes it took for you to restart your game
---
Maybe Reddiit isn't for you  OP.
---
Might have escaped your attention,that this is a discussion forum on everything Fallout 76,good and bad.
---
The game evolves because  posters discuss it.
---
I posted yesterday that my Gun was broke since the update.A poster took the time to  reply that i should get over it because all Guns in Fallout 76 are broke.I mean seriously.The poster was offended ffs.,even took the time to ramble on about it.
---
Don't worry about being attacked by people, unless you shoot back they do super reduced damage. I have 1 endurance and can just walk away from most builds trying to fight me. With the newest update getting perks like Ammosmith, Scrounger, Gunsmith and/or Makeshift Warrior is good quality of life.
---
I agree but notice how all the replies here are still being dismissive.
---
They sell styles in the atomic shop and you can change the way your character looks anytime through the pause menu. You can change race and body type and hair and all that. Even your nose. That's already all in game.
---
r/ihadastroke ?
---
Got them mixed up there, meant that the content from Fractured Steel would be delayed till we got Steel Dawn because they merged them. I wouldn't put it past Bethesda to delay Steel Dawn though considering how long it took them to get Wastelanders out.
---
TLDR: Bethesda can do no wrong. we only suck Bethesda dick here. Unless you rimming, you’re not winning.
---
He wasn't, all my teammates were still in there fighting him. Look I'm sorry but just accept that you are not right about this and move on
---
I paid sixty quid for this game I’m going to complain as much as I want until it’s a game worth sixty quid
---
This line of thinking is a bit too easy, tbh. It’s possible to love the Fallout franchise but feel upset about how Bethesda treats it. The reason people complain is often *because* they care.
---
 ⸮ S E Y
---
Workshops are pvp zones. Avoid then if you don't want pvp or at least don't linger inside them for any length of time. 
---
Pacifist mode can be enabled at lvl 5 and will help prevent accidental pvp.
---
Stealing from locked containers or hacking/ unlocking in workshops or player camps marks you as wanted allowing other players to attack you.  Once a player kills you the wanted status is removed.
---
You lose a few caps and drop all junk items when killed by a player, so when in doubt stash your junk and it's not a big deal if you get killed.  There's not much pvp these days regardless.
---
No PS-to-Xbox transfer. Game will be available through backwards compatibility.
---
right, but at the time i thought they were claiming it to actually use it. i also think its better to leave someone be when you just watched them clear out a workshop with obvious intentions of claiming it. like just go find one no one is after. but i dont really care anymore. the post was half a joke anyway.
---
Standard Armor mix of pieces do seem to be breaking faster, I have White Night 3 and I have to keep fixing the damn things, I'll run out of Ballistic Fibre at this rate and this is new since the game update.
---
Thank you! I didn't realize/remember the special stats swapping too. Man, I've been out of the game for far too long.
---
Thank you! Wasn't aware of that.
---
No but not
---
I thought that when I get somewhere around low level players I give them an headache with the enemies' level. Thank you for a peace of mind.
---
I agree and disagree. I agree that well constructed criticism and stating facts is beneficial and helps lead to positive changes. It also helps when trying to suggest fixes and help said players with their issues. It does nothing when it is just a pointless rant like the other dozen posts before it or just a general screw Bethesda post. That helps no one and doesnt benefit  the game or the players
---
When it says that it’s because someone’s already called one in on that server and the terminal in on cooldown, I was told but can’t verify that a cargobot can only be called in once an hour. I’ve had the same message jumped to my private server and been able to call one in so the timer is definitely on the terminal and not your character but as I say I haven’t verified how long you would need to wait on that server to be able to call one in so prob best to server hop until you find one that’s not on cooldown. It can be tricky as people call them in just to sell,them and the new Earle event means more nukes are being dropped
---
Wicked games :)
---
Beth will probably call it griefing and ban us they don't care about the PVP community they haven't ever since they removed survival mode.
---
U on pc?
---
I think we will all have to wait until some form of etticate is unified by the community. 
---
I simply start a team and wait for at least 2 people to join then use the follow me emote, wait ten seconds then start the op
---
I have a versatile build heavy PA and commando stealth, so for me the Queen now it's BE Gastling Plasma, free ultracite ammo with the daily ops is enough ;)
---
I found a different game after I got banned for being too edgy
---
I agree.
---
Lots of those clowns didn’t even play the game, they simply parrot what other bullshitters said in order to get clicks. Negativity sells, always.
---
Who knows, no one uses mics anyways.  It’s like the best and brightest are a bunch of mutes, only able to communicate through hand gestures and don’t know a full range of ASL.
---
I agree with a majority of what they've done, it's just that I feel like they nerfed players a little too much. I do agree that some of the builds were very op but when I'm playing a heavy weapons junkies build and I'm dying in just a few hits while wearing power armor I think it's a little ridiculous
---
They run a business, fun is not the product they sell that is just the label they sell what's inside the tin and that is fresh Atom Store goodies.
---
Sigh, why do i bother
---
She should spend no time talking. Adding her ruined the radio.
---
Similar thing happened to me, I think they fixed something but couldn't be bothered to put it in the patch notes.  Honestly I hate that we don't get a complete change log with every patch.
---
I have an alt that have ammo factory \*\*\*, I gonna check how much is it worth it
---
That's why I added the Still part. If head shots are labeled as a weak point than they should kill faster but they dont.
---
I'm still not entirely sure what this bug is supposed to be
---
Now, now children...

what are you a cop
---
I am.
---
Post  it before I do
---
First issue Ive had with them. Tho Ive noticed if Im logged on in a session when the change happens it boots me to the main menu. Think ill avoid logging in before 11:30 my time from now on
---
Get out your credit card and start buying those sweet Atom Store QOL items.
---
Yeah I definitely agree. There’s a Nuclear Winter community out there. They love to play Nuclear Winter all day. Sucks they don’t get a weekly challenge.
---
why would you use an explosive with the queen?
---
Had a dog spawned in the ground, i just shoot the area like mad and somehow the splash damage killed 👌
---
Agreed. Nothing with Bethesda is future proof lol. They drop changes like we drop nukes. I think I'll end up adding the str and int cards next.
---
Slap those perks on so you don’t have to
---
If damage perks are the only way we are able to deal enough damage to go for late game content, then they shouldn't be optional. They should be rewards given at various level up checkpoints, allowing us to use perk points for whatever QoL combinations suit our playstyle. Otherwise, we'll all be at level 1000 with the same perks, weapons and builds, and it's a pure on-rails shooter with no RPG elements at all.
---
I'll counterbalance all that by saying that I'm enjoying post patch much more than pre patch at level 68 - it's a real challenge again in a way that it hasn't been for about 40 or so levels. However, "just take the damage perks" is a bullshit argument. It's supposed to be an RPG, there should be multiple ways to be good at late game, not just beating the shit out of everything with the same big stick everyone else has. This is the first Fallout game I've played that I'm considering heavy guns, not because I want to, but because it feels like the only way to progress to late game.
---
And with today, unless I missed a mutation, we’ve seen every location, enemy type and mutation the ops has to offer.
---
Yes, that's the best one can do at the moment, I wish it were organized somehow.
---
There is 27 countries in the European union... jeez. At least make some effort.
---
I guess, but wouldn't that just be a little wierd, face is all fine but your nose is a ghouls? If they were to do anything like this I'd just prefer it to be full race changes, from human to ghoul. It's been a well requested feature in all fallout games too, so if it were a possibility this is the way they should do it.
---
I prioritize time but I kill for the ammo.
---
I understand why people want this to happen, but it is never ever going to happen.
---
Ah lmao so I’m totally tuning this new character for cheese then(I’m from WI so no worries).
---
I've had a couple buddies that did not get a rare reward after more than 24 hours and hitting elder

Full health atm I can’t find adrenal reaction serums anywhere.

What is the benefit of playing that way?
---
Most non-min/max builds (That I know) play with lots of weight reduction perks on. It makes it so they don't have to manage weight every five seconds.
---
I took 4 SPECIAL boosts and level 2 what rads and level 2 Survival shortcut, I don't need starched genes, dont need Rad X or rad away, dont need to carry food or drink or make any. I buy ammo. Only swap a perk to repair armour or weapons and then only when I run out of my hundreds of repair kits... many many perks saved.
---
I have a long time ago. But the only reason I asked if there was anyone else is because i noticed one day that another player taking stuff out makes me miss out on its content, the first player gets it and everyone missed out.
---
I'd been online for a while if that makes a difference? My camp spawn shouldn't be next to my vendors, I moved them after the last time this went round, but I could be wrong about that
---
well, i communicated my disapproval through bullets and they communicated that they didnt have time for my noob antics with a missile to the face lol. looking back it was pretty funny, at the time i was losing my shit though.
---
I already took demo expert.
---
Did it with the blood eagles the other day, alot of running and killing
---
If you think this is bad, you should check out r/escapefromtarkov , what a bitching shit show.
---
What alot of ppl fail to grasp is nearly 2 years into the games cycle an optimized build is required.
---
Its literally a case of ppl saying "play the game my way"   then poof, 2 years later they're right.
---
Its a bummer for ppl as.....well this game isn't casual anymore.
---
People can take things from your stash and displays.
---
I tried that too but no luck, got it on the next one. But this glitch had been in so long, I doubt it'll ever be fixed
---
I'm specced for non-automatic rifle, but even my fixer was taking 50-60 rounds.
---
I don't know why they have over 2,000 hit points.
---
If you want bethesda to make a good game find a diffrent one
---
Funny thing is, claiming that people are 'afraid' is somewhat hyperbolic :)
---
I have Bethesda.net linked to my Xbox and Pc and since they’re two different consoles(owned by the same company even) I had to make a new game. ):
---
Project paradise almost never happens perfectly due to needing at least six people to protect all three creatures and get them to level 3. Doing this would allow that to happen and give more people access to diffusers and bear arm plans.
---
I’ve seen a few perfect Rad rumbles, and to my mind, the biggest issue here is just people not going and collecting ore. I hope people have gotten over that thanks to what rads, though - in a hazmat/Chinese, you take 0 rads down there.
---
What are you talking about? You don't need to activate the terminal in the enclave bunker to find one... you can find the cargobots flying around the map at anytime or you can buy them. They're also giving out a few off the scoreboard for the season pass. So not quite sure why when I give you the correct answer I still get down voted 🤣🤣🤣
---
Do you already have the handmades or do you still need 'em? If you already have them, take the junkie's one.
---
Teams I’ve been on for ops. We just go about daily challenges until one of us go to the ops and the rest of us will join them.   People need to do other things during play but should join you when it shows you are in the ops.  And none of us use a mike either.
---
I can give you one if u on pc
---
It means there's already an account opened using that current email address. Either use an old password or reset it.
---
Finally, someone said it.
---
“Screw Bethesda” posts aren’t criticism and I never attempted to defend those kind of posts so I’m not sure why people keep bringing them up to dismiss my point. 
---
Since launch any kind of criticism towards the game just gets dismissed by this sub for some reason, not just the people who rant and whine.
---
Not debating your entire post, just your 'not worried' remark...if new players have a hard time of it and no one stays then the game will eventually die out, maybe not to you but to Beth the game is all about drawing in and keeping new players.
---
I haven't played in a few months. But I see people constantly complain about some new update making it very hard to be a new player. Or just bad overall unless you had God rolls for every slot.
---
&gt; being happy about there not being any lootboxes
---
Really high bar you set there huh.
---
Keep SS on fav wheel swap in/out for travel or battle...
---
Interesting
---
Yep. Private world, unlimited junk stash, place-anywhere survival tent that is a fast travel point... we can totally afford FO1st and we like it. And farming materials and resources is a breeze on private. Cheers, friend!
---
They won’t.  Because that would then mean with any new content they create, they need to creat it twice. Once for adventure. And once for the Survival, as well as any testing afterwards.  
---
You’d also have the bevy of PVPers who are mad that the server they’ve been begging to come back would effectively be used even more to cater to the “casual food builds”
---
yeah this is pretty much it. I'm not meta, super mutants are taking about 10 shots for my sneak commando. 
---
Honestly, it's really not a big deal BUT I can definitely tell it adds up. Fights last longer, use a lot more ammo.
---
The patch isn't harder it's just like a 30% time and mats tax.
---
Yea super annoying, yesterday was also a hound spawned inside a wall, I did the same just spam shot the area marked with the diamond, somehow killed it too. Ghouls spawn inside the wall in WS clubhouse all the time, looks like something won’t be fixed easily.
---
I’m fully specd on my third person to team heal and self heal. I’m not built to deliver damage what so ever. I had no problems other than wasting more rounds. I don’t understand the complaints after playing a non bloodied character last night.
---
The problem isn't that Fallout 76 charges money for them to maintain the server. (Although that is something they put them self in, no one ASKED for a live-service fallout). It's HOW they do it in the shittiest way. 
---
Everything is build around getting that extra cash out of people. There is a lot of ways to make this game better, but a lot of the issues is directly implemented to cause people to make money, or make people waste time.
---
I played survival a lot when it was a thing. I don't think Bethesda had an appetite to develop two separate game modes at the same time. They are doing what they can to just keep up with one and have barely touched NW lately. Initially they had survival to push the PvP community to a different place. It worked as most PvP players went to it. I think we often do some simple math in our head thinking it's easy to cut things in half and create two systems but I don't think it's that easy.
---
I like the new update. Those who are feeling the pain are those want the game to be more of a world sim sandbox and not a survival game. The game *is* a survival game and the update reiterated their place on that.
---
The cure-all here will be to offer truly private and modded servers. Allow players who pay to have their own space and tinker with it. This private world should not be part of the official ecosystem (should have your own leveling there and not count toward things like dailies weeklies etc). This doesn't have to replace the private servers we have now but can be a space where you can build run around relax etc.
---
I was t around last time but I’d heard so much good about this that I was very much looking forward to it.
---
I haven’t played this game in a long time so take what I say with a grain of salt. While I do somewhat agree with you, complaints need to exist or there will never be any improvement. You will live with whatever they give you, broken or not. Anti-consumer or not. 
---
There’s a difference between constructive feedback and acting like a total asshole in a complaint though. If you want to be heard, being an ass is not the way to do it.
---
I'm not. Just curious.
---
I tell people this that bitch about a FREE game I play. The backlash is staggering. Good luck.
---
I dont mind lower damage.. the game just doesnt Feel good anymore and thats a real drag...
---
Earlier I warped into some low level players camp that was next to where a group of nasty super mutants spawn.. i drop in looking for a vending machine and immediately aggro 6 lvl100's right out in the open, im fighting for my life and trying to hide behind their camp while  I figure out what on earth is trying to mass kill me... then the owner comes in with their buddy and they're running around shooting everything like no big deal. Im nearly dying and ducking for cover... I keep forgetting they're seeing super low level stuff LOL
---
Depends. Power armor or no power armor?
---
That may seem unlucky, but us melee mains are pining for that untradeable, unvendable war Glaive 🤤
---
With ammo, 50 caliber machine guns and plasma flamers may or may not be able to recoup their costs.
---
For other weapons, I think you’re correct there (maybe not the lmg either, but I haven’t seen that one used and haven’t tried it myself).
---
As for stims - another good option is to use survival syringes in their place or be in PA with recharge, as every current enemy type can use energy weapons.
---
It's definitely not.  Rifles are definitely an option.  And don't tell me other RPGs don't have "optional" mandatory damage perks.  Even Witcher 3 has them, and that's a great game.  People are literally complaining about not doing enough damage, while having more damage sitting in front of them.  You can't charisma your way out of every situation.
---
The old one was annoying as hell. I'm actually quite happy with the new one.
---
True. But Think it would be a good addition though with the funky duds perk now available
---
Nice! I can't wait to get that plan
---
I don't think so.  I don't think it's a very good perk.
---
The glavie is, the gutter and whistling in the dark are not
---
Gatling is best boy.
---
Smallest ammo and high damage
---
War Glaive is on the menu boys..
---
Initially i thought melee would be usable if you went 100% investment but even with every buff the damage goes up extremely minimally(10-15). This may be due to bloodied and I want to test other effects first but maybe they did go a little too hard on the nerf after all.
---
Because that one is a legacy and the exploding damage is not mitigated by the SBQ.
---
Not really, it is quite easy to detect fear in some of the posts I've read.  I'm not saying its everyone or that everyone is being hyperbolic, in fact I'm not attempting to lump everyone that has problems with the update into the same group since some if the criticism I've seen is perfectly valid.  I freely admit that there are problems and some things, notably unarmed, need buffs with the new calculation method; but people also need to realise that no amount of bitching is going to make Bethesda revert to the old damage calculations.
---
Is it possible to have deep pocketed AND ss jetpack on the torso at the same time?  Sorry if it’s a dumb question but I’m still grinding for ss armor mods.  The treasury note/bullion cap is killing me
---
Not that dude, but I'm on PC, and would love an X01.
---
Sounds like that worked for you, I did do the what rads but found during radiation rumble rad away or the shower was still needed. Maybe just during the one event as i cant think of any other reason to need it would starched genes be necessary. 
---
I make ammo, although after daily ops i found iwent from 7k 5mm to 9k 5mm, so i may not need it as much soon. Not sure i want to put full faith in that continuing in case i switch from the gatling gun to a mini gun or similar. 
---
I dont run the queen enough to cover reapir kits, although only going to 100% while in between kits could be possible. 
---
Maybe i should re-evaluate my setup to see if I could slim down my picks and remove the need for any swapping.
---
Nobody will attack you, and even if they do- they won’t don’t damage outside of a workshop. 
---
1) turn pacifist on once you reach level 5 so you don’t accidentally engage in PvP. 
---
2) don’t take over workshops if you don’t want PvP. 
---
Just follow the story, explore, make friends, have fun!
---
It did not show for me yesterday, but i still had the jumpsuit plan in inventory after
---
Let us know if rain passes through the roof like the greenhouse dome.
---
lul wut
---
Still very effective cause of the beam splitter despite it's explosive. Legacy have not been nerfed... And cheap ultracite ammo, free with ops.
---
That is the absolute worst reason to prime a gun, except you don't use it for anything else.
---
There's a reason you don't see anyone with bounties. People would just stop doing whatever they get a bounty from.  Just go play nw.
---
I'm not. Just curious. I don't have one. Damn. Ask a question and the trolls come out.
---
Pic..

---
it's not lol
---
I always thought it was an oversight they never cared to fix.
---
I mean, I have before and there's no benefit.
---
Only 2H
---
&gt;Dont even care if it's a grind.
---
FIVE YEARS LATER....
---
Not dumb question. I have buttressed and jet pack mods on my chest piece so probably could
---
its not too bad though, use it with enforcer perk card to cripple w/o switching heavy gunner cards off. should work really well on ghouls.
---
Not everybody plays this game with a "here's how I'm going to kill everything well" mindset. I like to just run around and scavenge, do dailies, occasionally SBQ or Earl. All my perk cards are for carry weight, scrapping, building, adventuring.
---
It's just a bit easier than first season, you can at much miss 14 days in 2nd season while in the legendary run you could only miss 9 days (without considering the double scores).
---
Thanks for the graphics by the way.
---
I'm not your compadre, Freund.
---
Yep, those demolishers and gladiators are no joke if they got automatic weapons lol
---
I don't have either yet - I'm usually a rifle and looking to be more useful against bosses and in the Uplink op (Would swap in Adrenaline for the stealth perks for Uplink).
---
Nuclear winter ain't my style, ain't a good highlight of what fallout can do with PvP either
---
No, it's not.
---
Me as well. But if they’d like to test it, no harm. And at least then he’ll see it with his own eyes.
---
I was playing my sneak pistol alt that I am switching to a full health build and noticed I had to use 1-3 more bullets on the lvl 100 miners but later realized I was still using a bloodied crit 10mm. So it wasn’t all that bad. But I had to use a full clip on robots. That’s when I double checked my gun.
---
Jet pack already shouldn't be on anything but pa, don't let it leech onto anything else.
---
At this point it seems like the damage difference between junkies and anti armor is so slight that anti armor is (all other things being equal) the easy choice since you aren’t losing stats to gain that damage. Junkies fairs a bit better against low armor enemies liked scorched and ghouls but those enemies are such a non issue that it’s not really pertinent. 
---
Because you’re doing an auto build the real issue comes from magic damage. The question is is a god roll junkies/faster fire rate/faster reload doing more total damage output than a AA/“magic effect”/faster reload weapon. I don’t have the weapons to test it myself, and I haven’t seen it tested by anyone yet. This is somewhat mitigated for you since you are doing a sneak build and can fairly easily incorporate a magic armor piece instead or relying on the weapon having the magic effect
---
Armor and weapon durability drain is down 50% in ops.
---
OP is probably the type of person to tell immigrants "if you dont like it go back to your country"
---
Lol very true my friend , I'll choose my words more carefully
---
I got it on my alt today... In other news I'm now levelling up my alt into a melee build 😅
---
I’m going to give it a go tonight, coming back from pre wastlanders. Any tips?
---
Power armor gives:
---
Unlisted 40% flat reduction to damage (not from DR).
---
Inherent immunity to crippling (frees up perk points from Adamantium skeleton.
---
50% damage reduction from emergency protocols mod (stacks multiplicatively)
---
High inherent rad resist without needing radshield or rad-x (great for fighting ghouls, glowing critters, etc).
---
Targeting HUD is the king of helmet mods.
---
No grinding needed to create highly effective armor setup (no need to blow 10,000 scrip trying to find a single leg armor piece with the legendary effects you need to be effective.
---
No need to wear body armor, reducing carried weight dramatically.
---
High accuracy and 45% armor piercing with heavy weapons using stabilized.
---
While in power armor, Energy attacks HEAL YOU and recharge fusion core with the Electric Absorption legendary perk. With high enough ER and perks, super mutants and other opponents doing energy damage will often heal you faster than they can hurt you. This means with the right setup, you can be mostly invulnerable to energy damage.
---
Neither is adventure mode pvp, lol.
---
They as in Bethesda? Yeah they have come out and said that enemy scaling needs to be fixed
---
I like to imagine Old Longfellow saying something like "Hats?? We don't need not stinking hats!" and he is the OG Hunter Long Coat. 
---
Cowboy hat hard to beat but I like the Ranger helmet I got with FO 1st.  Looks good and protects from airborne hazards.
---
Just pistol whip them...
---
ok, so i have a question, i have BE flamer and BE gatling plasma, but since i'm commando i don't use them... i noticed that the explosive perk card doesn't modify the damage on those but it does on the BE handmade.... do you know anything about that?
---
Someone said throwable melee work. Knives, tomahawk,  cleavers.
---
Those mole rats are deadly critters.
---
Ok cool.  So far I have all the pieces buttressed.  What would you suggest for a good backpack mod? So far I have the high capacity but I’m not so sure it’s all that great.
---
TL;DR : Yeah, the game is all fucked up, but I am tired of being forced to admit it. Besides, it could be worse. If you like Bethesda games tho, you better buy shit in the Atom Shop.
---
People keep complaining about this ruining their one-shot build, but in reality it lowered the gap between builds and this REALLY helps the utility effects. I still don't see much talk of medic's, but vampire's and quad have moved up in their relative weight to other effects because their bonus is the same and the trade-off of using them is less significant. Also something that people are slowly starting to catch on to: explosive has been buffed, whether through the way it is calculated or by removing the ridiculous explosive resistance enemies once had. Doesn't matter, the takeaway is that explosive is a clearly better choice for almost any scenario for DPS now, and FFR is no longer the unrivaled best secondary effect. Since it synchronizes with TS, TSE is now a more viable build, but not as hilariously overpowered as it once was. 
---
What's that? You have multiple choices on how to make an effective build? Game is broken now wtf bethesda. My min-maxed build is now only somewhat stronger than a more casually optimized build, unacceptable, uninstalling
---
also yeah people are going to bitch about having nothing to do and then bitch that they can't complete the new grind in one day. More stuff to work for = good, doesn't matter if it's just a grind. This whole game is designed to be a time-waster and a grindfest, if you haven't realized that by level 100 then there's a problem
---
Myself &amp; the Group I run with make sure there is always some Events for everyone to do &amp; are always launching Nukes, we breath life into boring &amp; stale servers. Just sucks that Bethesda has gone the "Mobile Game" route as far as letting player spread their wings &amp; progress in 76. 155 days of Treasury Notes, this will double in a week or 2.
---
Sounds cool but bethesda already said no to other races. Maybe as a holloween item though? Thatd be cool
---
Are you being *intentionally* obtuse?
---
Matter of perspective, I guess. I do a lot of sprinting in power armor and my power armor character can cover more ground before getting winded than my non PA character. I appreciate the qol.
---
Oh ok.  So it’s either deep pocketed OR jetpack?
---
I’ve had a year to tidy my cupboard.
---
Subscribe to Cupboard 1st. Let’s get the wasteland that is my cupboard tidy together!
---
Only 7.99pm.
---
Wow. Thank you for the full details. I’ll consider it with my build.
---
it would be with a few tweaks, my idea is just one thing that could help, a reason for the bounty system to even exist
---
Nothing changed, go to random location spawns till you find a lonely critter and aim and click X to tame
---
So how do you get them? Cause wether or not you activate the terminal you get them from cargobots lmao
---
Because some people want to just play the game how they want to play it, what is the fun in playing a game where you are forced to play a certain way to be successful in a game series known for letting us go our own ways?
---
One mod, your choice.  Unless you have t 65 pa of course.
---
No, the jetpack and deep pocketed use the same slot. Kind of a bummer.
---
Well shit they're utterly useless then thanks for the clarification.
---
I don’t consider Daily Ops as new content because the new content isn’t the Daily Ops itself, that’s just a repeatable quest line. The new content itself is a few plans and cosmetic skins. And I’m not saying they don’t add content, I think what I meant is the lack of content they’ve added in the time frames they had. The game was unfinished when released, it remains bug filled and broken at times. So, while not fixing bugs and glitches, they could’ve added way more to the game than they have. In roughly two years we’ve gotten exactly one mediocre endgame boss, a raid they pulled out due to it being buggy while not fixing other bugs, an extremely short quest line to grind for gold bullion and a small spattering of other things. So, we haven’t really gotten monthly content. Yes, I am unhappy with the new content. I’m unhappy with it because it’s lazily done and I do love this game, despite my frustration with it.
---
When you decided to start a fight you lost all ownership of your junk. That's your risk/reward scenario. Stash your junk before you fight and you've alleviated all these issues well in advance.
---
I personally go with chem/aid weight reduction from crater , it's amazing
---
A bit sad i enjoyed that event.
---
If it was that Whitespring it self  there was too much happening.
---
A solution could have been to move it to  Helveta where Faschnacht was held.Ideal place no Cars  for game lagging explosions.
---
That event ran flawlessly.
---
I’m not
---
I am a full health build, so as far as bloodied goes i cant help, but i do run gatling guns primarily. I have 2 V ffr 25lvc gatling guns, one primed and one not. With this, I can stand at the queens nose firing non-stop and taking her health down as I go and keeping her on me while the High dps comes from the bloodied in stealth, although my output is nothing to laugh at. 
---
Find a bloodied ffr gatling gun and trade your way to it. Before that I wouldnt bother or it wont be enough to take her down or keep you going.
---
Despite demo expert don't affect the number of the legacies that are shown, the perk work despite everything. That was proven multiple times. So the numbers you see are false
---
once again. pics or it didn't happen.
---
every day there's talk of a vendor glitch and every day there's no actual evidence
---
I sprint in pa all the time, I just cant tell the difference between having the perk and not.
---
Gtfo, seriously? There goes my weekend making viable alts.
---
I'm just trying to talk from the casuals point of view I guess, since that's what Beth listens to the most
---
I just want more bounties to hunt
---
I always take a maxed Blocker.. ignoring 45% incoming melee damage is huge in this game..
---
Happening to me too.
---
I have 3 immobile mules though
---
I always only used 1 rank. I never noticed a difference having 3 ranks.
---
No, I'm not.  Lvl 50's take a couple of bullets, less than a second, instantly dead.
---
Amen to that!
---
People will never stop bitching here, so it just must be happening less frequently. I won't believe it's truly fixed until this remains the case for much longer though
---
He's an essential worker. He's wearing a mask and stays behind cover
---
I think I can understand what he thinks, thx.
---
Here's an explanation of what he's talking about: https://youtu.be/7nO9bZm8ceY?t=51
---
It's a bit long winded, and some of it is very specific to the battlefield netcode implementation, but I think the visualizations are nice to get a better understanding of things.
---
Here's another interesting section:
---
https://youtu.be/7nO9bZm8ceY?t=697
---
It's a bug among a lot of them (also "discover places at cranberry bog" and ALL the "kill different kinds of..." are bugged) since launch. 
---
It seems it's not a priority of Bethesda fixing them up, but if it's something that benefits players you can be sure they will fix it (like the weight bench, daily equipment bug, the rockets faster reload, the line in the sand bug, the infinite camp budget bug).
---
BUt I neEd 200 stiMZ anD 500 stEAks at ALL TIMEZZZZ juSt to GEt by. rEeeEeEEEEEEEEE
---
Do you have a map with good quality? Beacuse other maps i've look worse than the og fallout map.
---
ah right.. i logged in at [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) with my default email and see its connected to xbox, should be good to go then?
---
tfyf
---
It will be common in 2 weeks, but red asylum outfits and BE fixers are already common. People who are trading them have dozens of duped ones fyi, probably mules full of them too
---
If that’s true it’s a game changer for me, and my sheepsquatch shards are gonna get some use.
---
It comes across as dismissive because no one gets to the root cause of why the player is struggling.  They are just *assuming* it’s because of the changes.  
---
Over the past 3 days I have tried multiple builds. I have tried a shot gun build that’s high CHA.  I have tried an unarmed build.  I have tested melee builds, both 1HD and 2HD.  I have tested a sniper build. These are not bloodied builds.  They are not Junkies builds.  Most of the armor hasn’t even been modded out yet.  Most of it isn’t even the highest tier (meaning it’s regular leather vs. Heavy leather, missing out on DR/ER). I’ve tested it out with Quest Reward weapons. 
---
And yes, just for comparison sakes, I’ve tested it out with my only true OP build, my “bloodied” sniper, and I put bloodied in quotes because even the weapon I’m using isn’t bloodied, it’s a Mutant’s Handmade with +10% damage when aiming.  Mutant’s adds all of 10% damage to the BASE of the weapon. 
---
All of my builds are doing fine.  I’ve even done some tests going further and intentionally tried to use WORSE gear, and even then, even in the worst moment of using a ghoul slayer baton without any mods against a horde of level 75/100 super mutants, I came out only missing about 15 stim packs and that’s only because I didn’t make more preparations.  
---
If people here can do this with bad gear, why can’t your 38-110 friends?  My characters are 12, 61 (started this week at 52), 120, 125, and 220. Most are pretty close to the scale you gave.  
---
Just as there’s a difference between valid Criticism and “F*** Bethesda”, there’s a difference between Bad Build/Bad Gear and apparently actively sabotaging yourself and/or just not even trying. 
---
So give us examples, what is your level 38-110 friends using, why are they having problems. What specifically is the issue.  What have they done to try to adapt to the change.  
---
Provide concrete evidence of it, rather than just saying “they are having a hard time”, and then we would have something to use as “valid criticism”
---
i would trade you I have gotten nothing 3 days running
---
im not sure where you're sourcing those #s from but if that is the case then id be much more mollified.   havent seen too much about them balancing out the other effects etc, but if thats the case then thats super cool &amp; makes 1w more palatable
---
They laid out *exactly* what the problem was and you completely missed it. If you aren't being intentionally obtuse, did you bother to read the response you got before you made one? Did you read to understand, or did you read to reply?
---
Yes, that's an option. However, it's slower than a switchblade, for instance.
---
Got a Blooded 3\* Gatling Laser for 300 caps a couple days.  User disconnected after.  If you can race to a vendor machine before camp loads it gives you random stuff.  To protect you can put vendors on 2nd floor or make weapon vendors slightly harder to get to.
---
I'm not your Freund, kemosabe.
---
Ya, I'm going to try it. Is the daily op today resilient again?
---
You should try this [page](https://www.kevduit.com/fallout-76-builds/) I found it when I was looking to rebuild away from stealth sniper. It's pretty helpful even if you don't follow his build to a T.
---
And yes, the explosive damage of the legacy is not like another explosive damage (BE cal 50 for example). The SBQ is not immune to the legacies explosive damage even if she is for explosive damage in general.
---
Buckle up butter cup.
---
I run bloodied, enjoying the challenge.
---
Lucky you. I got an AA/25 handmade dropped from daily ops. You can pick it up for... try to name a price \^\^
---
This. I can't believe that they do such a large change without a free respec/card refund based on level. 
---
Trash all cards, let people keep their animated cards but at level 1 then refund card buys equal to Level x 1.8 (because card packs would be 5 cards, one of which was animated)
---
A "public team" for me is a neccessary part of my build.  Without it I have less damage, less health, less experience gain, less carry weight, etc.  I don't care about anyone on the team.  If y'all want to talk, that's fine, share tips, etc.  But that's not why I join them.
---
I just want want my user account data restored (player characters and inventories). My account was accused of exploits and subsequently wiped. To begin with, I did not exploit fo76 and had my player data wiped. I know players that did/do exploit and they get to keep their player data. Granted, I have traded with players or bought items in a box or player vendor that are probably suspect (player sold 500 quantum's in a player vendor that many people would consider buying). However, just because I traded my *insert item(s)" with player "xyz" and they gave me item(s) "abc" doesn't mean I exploited the game and should have my user data wiped.
---
There is a noticeable difficulty spike. Melee attacks from enemies don't seem to do much while damage from guns feel overpowered. Though I haven't encountered more than three or four creatures in a group and it's easier to dodge melee attacks.
---
I don't know why Daily Ops are included in the dailies and weeklies when they seem unplayable for lower level players.
---
It will be interesting to see how many players there are in the upcoming weeks and months. At least Steam has a counter, though probably not the greatest measure.
---
No problems on pc so far
---
&gt;I haven't thought about using mods. You can't use them without a fully paid for version?
---
I'd think that so long as it creates a local Data folder the mods should be workable regardless of how it's launched...I only use a couple, perk load manager, a mod to show weight by tab/category and one that makes finding loot after the fight easier. I could live without the last two but the perk manager is an absolute must QoL item for me!
---
I think it’s the invisible until attacking mutation today.
---
I’ve tried but apparently the 4 rare fasnacht masks and the reclaimed deep mining mask just get ignored when I try
---
Not saying as a race. Just purely aesthetic.
---
I heard it still only counts if ya have a melee weapon equipped when throwing EM though...
---
Like,throwing while equipped wit a gun Is a no go.
---
Not sure if it’s true as I don’t melee or throw really,but I did read a discussion on here yesterday about it.
---
ohh i might have to try the flamer then
---
I don’t really know much about the game as I JUST started to get into it... but as a low level player all the enemies just kick my ass because we are the same damn level... things that are supposed to be easy to kill like feral ghouls are hard because we are putting out the same damage pretty much... feel like I’m hitting enemies with a pillow... 😅
---
Thank you for the offer, I'll just work on finding replacement pieces, I'm sure it won't take very long.
---
I mean, this is still pretty true nowadays. Angry turtle's words have been stretched thinner than a laffy taffy at this point with how many people have made false statements based very loosely on what he said
---
Glad PC is fine but on PS it's not doing great. So I was wondering if anyone else was having these issues on console.
---
Yes! I had to learn this from Reddit. 
---
I’ve only had two 8min+ events. First was me going solo with a non-melee build and got my butt handed to me by the General Gutsys.
---
The only other event was when no one stayed by the booster.
---
Lesson learned: everyone stand close and soak up the damage.
---
Trade stealing hoax was a fun one
---
My husband went all in on heavy gunner, and his gatling gun was taking a dozen or more shots.
---
Ps4? could get into this action... lvl 240 full uny/ap/sent with more than enough guns to help clear
---

---
My personal loop is start @ cranberry glade (turn right and see parking lot) 
---
Then travel slightly northwest to The quarry X3, run around the right side of the quarry and check the unmarked fissure behind it, then run towards abandoned bog town to see a second possible encounter just southwest of it 
---
Then go to the bend in the road west of Big B’s rest stop
---
Then go to East Ridge lookout
---
Then to Freddy Fear’s and run northwest into the hills to get the spawn location north of red rocket mega stop
---
Finally go to the fissure site next to vault 79 and walk East, there’s one random spawn immediately northeast of it and another east of that by a lake with an unmarked vertibird crash
---
You can already make your face look all scarred, wrinkled and burned like the ghouls right now. Even give yourself stringy gross hair like them too. Only part missing is the nose.
---
I've been crashing too on Xbox
---
At least 1 every other hour it seems. Never happened before, especially on private worlds
---
I like sharing bloody mess. I used team medic last night on daily ops and it worked pretty great.
---
There are so many good rank 3 card sets you can share though! Sky is the limit really, just depnding on what you and your team are doing.
---
I want mole miner ally in my camp!
---
Did you actually run this through WesTek, or is it a paper build?  Not being snarky just curious- because I've never seen a char with that many on demand mutations.  The only way I know of to get them is through one of the questlines and the recipes are exorbitantly priced.
---
The health regen one might work to salvage my build with Follow Through legendary perk.  Any information you can supply without spoiling publically would be appreciated.
---
&gt; Can't stop em join em, and it looks like that's your only option
---
And their whole point was that it shouldn't be that way.
---
They are not running much. But def not visible most of the time. I wasn't able to use vats. Though, my vampire gatling on a close distance has worked just fine. The boss is helpless face to face.
---
Well, I said that in response to your other comment which seemed to imply that but I could be misunderstanding
---
Point is to not get everything at once... thus the grind for greatness.
---
If any player could play a few events and get all gold needed to get all end game items in a tiny amount of time... why play? what is there to work for?
---
Think if you had everything there is to possibly have. Would you keep grinding events? It keeps players playing, filling servers, buying atoms, something to work for, etc.
---
In the top right(?) corner it'll say what you are looking at. Like Molerat. For some things that are hard to see in taller grass it makes finding the body easier. Or if there's a load of dead bodies, goo/ash pile. 
---
Also makes finishing the photo challenges easier to picture the dead. When I started doing them I thought they needed to be alive and was scared to take pictures of harder mobs at the time. Then I realized them being dead counted and the Glassed cavern had static dead bodies you could also take a picture of.
---
That's an interesting thought. I'll try that next time.
---
The legendary perks and the ops are fun, the rebalence is horrable and buggy and has made the early game level up the worst grind I've seen in videogames for years!
---
So your Fixer fixes, explosively.
---
Are the plans tradeable?
---
Went in as a team of 2.  I tried line in the sand last week, just to see if I could.  Most events we do as a pair.
---
i only use power armor at events so no power armor i’d say
---
what’s that?
---
Lotta damage, what perks do you have on to increase it?
---
You were so generic and vague it means nothing, kind of like politician.
---
So maybe it's linked to consoles? I'm aware of all the problems Bethesda faces but this makes the game unplayable
---
Those numbers are from the damage calculator.
---
Two handed
---
Right. Don’t most perk/skill slot based games have a in game currency reset. The ones I know do. Ay ay ay. I like my main and the grind I’ve put in however playing off some website build instead of being able to test my own is a bummer.
---
Took me 10 minutes to kill a Legendary Gulper for a fucking Rolling Pin today.
---
It kept healing to full health every time it disappeared, then reappeared seconds later.
---
Not deterred i kept plugging away for my richly deserved reward.
---
I am using Power Armour,and Heavy Weapons more, and more, as a Bloodied build,i simply have to,or i will die.Uranium Fever Mole Miners can now get in close and kill you before you kill them.
---
To be fair i am enjoying that event .Definitely more challenging.
---
Yeah same
---
Just a regular Gatling gun? I’m running a bloodied one and a nocturnal explosive one at night lol
---
Yep, wasn't sure if this was the exact method but I know people have already started exploiting some method of triggering pvp for griefing
---
Cheers...as you said this will make looting easier when you have moved during battle in an area with tall grass.
---
nothing has changed, but the biggest hurdle is that the creature has to be both random and under half your level. so don't even bother until you lv 150 for those lv 75 critters spawns
---
I also wish we could use the Atom Shop underarmours as skins for all underarmours.
---
None! This dropped for my bloodied commando. My bloodied melee hasn’t had the plan drop yet, annoyingly.
---
Furious, bonus limb damage Gatling gun.
---
Yes lol and heals the team
---
I just don't get how people think it's hard, that's my point.  People are complaining they want the "easy areas" of the map back.  Before they were just a waste of time.  Now they are low level areas that I still don't really want to go to because of bad xp, but better than before.
---
I know the mtg reference, but this person isn't a timmy, he's playing a joke deck and complaining it doesn't work.
---
I wouldn't mind, but you can get the X-01 plans in the Enclave Armory from a terminal near the back in the room with the modus vendors. Mine would be nothing special, I was just trying to help a guy out :p I'm assuming you have access though, just based on post history.
---
If not, I'll make it in return for the rarer mats in it, I think Nuclear material, maybe something else.
---
No problem :)
---
I've was wondering this tonight, had a weird evening in general. Joined a daily op team of two, another person joins soon after, we wait until we hit full bond. Once it does, the team leader doesn't start the op. I emote, nothing happens, then two people (including the team leader) leave. One more joins. Wait for full bond. New team leader doesn't start the op. Fed up, I just jump into the op. Gesture "come here". The other two people leave the team. End up just doing the op solo.
---
Do I smell or something, or did I misunderstand the etiquette of starting a daily op?
---
The first three days were fine, incidentally. Team leaders started the op either immediately on hitting four players, or as soon as the team hit full bond. It's just tonight that I felt like I'd missed a memo or something.
---
Mist be something to do with the port of the update to consoles after all pc has had the update for months in the pts
---
I'm on pc if that makes any difference, but since I launched my 1st nuke (done about 50ish so far) I can place my location marker on my normal map and it will appear on the launch map which helps me max out flux etc, but it never snaps to anything just put it where I want?
---
&gt; Seems like servers are just overloaded
---
Which is really sad when the whole damage formula simplification change (nerf) was made to _reduce_ server load and make it easier to adjust balance in the future.
---
I figure if you want those racial traits you can just take ghoulish and what rads? Then you'll basically never get rads, and you'll just heal instead. There's perks in the game for that kind thing already. Currently we just lack the aesthetic piece.
---
To be fair, prior to being accused of cheating and having my user data wiped, I did enjoy the game. However, I'm not willing to restart from scratch after spending nearly two years (from beta to July 2020) and loosing everything. Why would I want to restart a game that I played as legitimately (as anyone could, despite those suspect items/players), only to be accused of a crime, punished, and told to "go start over." Why should I do that? So bethesda can wipe my data again in two years? 
---
Tldr: I'm salty over false accusations of cheating, and therefore venting. 
---
Outside of that bs; I do enjoy the records of other players talking about their experiences in game like camp builds and so forth.
---
Us shotgun mains got a bigass buff with the contextual ammo thing
---
yup, and people are paying a lot more at the moment before time saturates the market
---
No problem, I have some bloodied guns to help you get started if you want. I know I have a 3 star bloodied Gatling gun on my mule. I may have a bloodied 50 cal too. I’d have to check. If you want, give me your PSN name and I’ll get with you after work in about 2 hrs
---
Many of those super nice pics are from PC, and even furthermore, many are those of us that fully edit said photos before posting them online LOL. (I have one such gallery myself, check profile, i need to update it with the last couple months of gameplay).
---
Also, keep in mind, that many of the pics you see too are resized to a smaller size, the full size images may not look so great. If you're using a massive TV or 4K or whatever, and your game is only outputting 1080p, you're goign to get a not so great looking game too.
---
Consoles are pretty limited in what they can do, on top of that, 76 does have some optimization issues, so older hardware is going to struggle with it.
---
That's a good a tip but with an asterisk (\*) the rare plans are only available after level 50, so if you only want those and you don't have a character that high don't waste your time
---
Every day so far except the first one, and today I got it without trying lmao granted with 4 second left
---
How much bullion is that?
---
I haven’t crashed yet on PS4 ever since the update. I’m actually surprised.
---
Travis and three dog were much better.
---
Messages/text chat: yes please pipboy: god no, the pipboy paradigm is a travesty of uix design. It's a case of so much usability/clarity merely for 'cool factor' in it's look.
---
I use it on shotguns so i'm supposed to be close anyway
---
Your biggest problem is that you aren't trying to maximize your damage. Under perception you need to get rid of almost all the perks you have, especially the lock pick stuff.  For running rifleman you need all three rifleman cards at rank 3 as well as tank killer at rank 3.  If you need to pick a lock then switch perks out, pick the lock and then switch back once the lock is open.
---
A lot of your other stats are wasted on weight reduction and quality of life perks.  One or two perks like that are okay to run to a point, but every one you use is a sacrifice to damage and survivability. 
---
There are a lot of solid builds online to guide you.  Changing to heavies is not going to help anything until you learn how to focus a build to maximize it's potential.
---
After all of the advice I've received on this topic, I think it may have to do with my rifle build just not being good enough anymore. It looks like even if I implement group bonuses and mutations, I'll still be underpowered. Unless I move over to a bloodied build, which I'm not a fan of. I'm not a fan of mutations either for that matter.
---
\+1/2/3% damage.
---
\+10/15/20% hit chance with non-automatic weapons.
---
\+2/3/4% hit chance with automatic weapons (rank 3 was previously bugged and gave 20%).
---
It's at least better than Destiny. They charge for MTX AND all big Dlc expansions. People who whine should go play that
---
?
---
I see a lot more random encounters as well. Just killed a lvl95 sheepsquatch 1 star today that was spawned next to my buddy's camp.
---
Exactly, it fixes
---
Eggs isn't enough, throw bags of dog crap at their office.
---
I’m not 100% sure but I think the furious prefix is still broken
---
Then unarmed is the build for you \^\^. Here's a prototype, you can build around it:
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f141158&amp;d=ss2sg2sf2s92lt2lu2l71se2xk3x13x33xe3xg3xp3a04ee2&amp;m=cfgh3](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f141158&amp;d=ss2sg2sf2s92lt2lu2l71se2xk3x13x33xe3xg3xp3a04ee2&amp;m=cfgh3)
---
There's always more rewards to be had.
---
Meant to comment that on the post, must've accidentally hit reply
---
Perception:: I recommend only putting on the picklock perks when u need to pick something which is very uncommon and get rid of bobble head card and Agility:: i run a sneak build so while you are hidden or in caution it adds an additive 2.5* damage every shot but you don't have to
---
Edit: if going for heavy power armor built you will not need to sneak
---
Hi. Thanks for the love! :)
---
So, what the direct consequence on gameplay that make it pay 2 win ?
---
How those 10k resources can kill a SBQ in less than 10 seconds ?
---
That's a really good idea, I'd actually really like to have my synergy between guns and melee
---
I agree wit all gameplay wise things but then boys leaked folks info on accident from what I remember 😅
---
That’s a shame. If there’s a way for Bethesda to allow us to transfer our progress over that would be great. I feel like they will lose a lot of players if not.
---
It’s RNG. I got 2 of the same plans some days apart from one another.
---
I tried checking everything, latest software, latest updates and I'm on PS4 pro so I doubt it's the hardware.
---
I just wish it would stop focusing when I let go of the button so I don't die to whatever is close range killing me -\_- you have to hit every key on the keyboard to make it stop, and sometimes it still wont, so you just have to run off while fully zoomed down your scope and hope it stops.
---
The double lvl thing is not true ' it may have used to been but I  shared animal friend 3 with my mule xbox character and at lvl 4 was able to tame a mirelurk king
---
Not gonna lie, you sound like a Bethesda employee here bro, but then again this is reddit.
---
ah
---
Earl.😎
---
Exactly.  I don't get how people don't understand how to spec well either.  Reading the card explains the card.  Put mountains in your red deck wins deck people!  Like, come on.  If you're using a rifle and the card says rifle on it, it's probably a good idea to put it in.  Basic rpg stuff.  Oh, and RTFM
---
thank you!
---
You're right, I just hope it gets fixed soon since I like to spend a few hours on it to decompress from the day
---
Oh yeah I have. and they are fun. only the 2mm I get in return would be great for something like like the gauss rifle or gauss shotgun(which I am working towards)
---
Thanks dude. I had no idea where it was. I play a lot but would be considered casual as fuck. I'm level 150 but haven't even beaten the main quests to grind gold or whatever. I just kill shit for a couple hours a day and chill in my camp.
---
Watched this on lunch today and I’m going to test with one rank as well. I just got a 33 hit chance on my fixer so this should help as well. Will try the two ranks of ground pounder too. Plus my character has an orange Mentats problem....it will be nice freeing up two points
---
Lmao who gave this post awards? Bad take
---
PM sent!
---
Not really sure if it proce the legend perk, but its a great mutation for ignoring anoying enemies like rad roaches and mirelurk spawn. They atk, they die...
---
Yes! I did it solo with the super mutants and the explosive blood eagles and I don't have a specific OP build(7:45-ish both times). 
---
My advice is RUN! To get to the objectives and fill the bar and only kill the ones you need to, if not find a good team and it will be a lot easier.
---
Having a vast supply of rare scrap to buy a magic weapon of course! Magic effects are more powerful now then before the update!
---
Players without Fallout 1st are priced out of the market!
---
Its 350 , I have it on the 60lb carry weight backpack that you get for completing the tadpole quests
---
Thanks for the stats!
---
Do you think rank 3 is worth it for commandos?
---
This is from daily ops? Guess I ought to start running it. I'm more Enclave oriented but it's hard to turn down a good-looking outfit like that.
---
LOL I love creative camps!
---
I'm honestly about to switch to a shotgun build at this point.
---
Yes, I ran this through West Tek (twice actually).  I didn’t want to skimp on anything so I provided as much detail on what he actually has, even if it doesn’t make sense.  I hate the idea of buying serums for players, so I just farmed mutations the old way by sitting in rads with starch genes off, getting a mutation, putting starch genes on, cleansing all my rads, hopping servers, and repeating it (that’s the brute force way).   I’ve done this with everyone, since there is little reason not to just have every mutation.  Herbivore vs. Carnivore is the only annoying aspect of it, and getting something like grounded sucks if you want to use energy weapons.  But this is free, since I don’t drop nukes solo and even though I do have the caps, I can’t see myself spending it on the plans.  
---
Healing factor is one of those weird ones, and I probably would be better off without it now, given how it impacts chems.  It only heals out of combat (which was nice), but in combat it reduces the effectiveness of all chems, including stimpacks.  Even something like “Buffout” only gives +2 STR vs. +3.
---
It's very disappointing especially since I missed out on it last year.
---
Everything else is, except the Glaive plan.
---
Good idea, but no. I don’t have the coins to upgrade it twice for the 3 points I would need.
---
Thankfully so far seems harmless but kind of annoying at times.
---
I was pretty much invincible before the latest big update.  Now I’m dying all the time and I’m actually sometimes low on healing chems and stuff.  I like it.  It’s more fun to be challenged than basically Superman with a 50 cal.
---
I feel fine with it. You have six slots. You can probably at least decide the perk that is most beneficial to you and the least beneficial out of the 6, even if the middle would be somewhat blurred. I would assume most people are currently spending their points maxing out the perk that is most beneficial to them. And that they will probably not max the one that is least beneficial until they maxed out the others; that least beneficial perk will probably be the one to be swapped out if something happens or others are introduced
---
As for balance, yeah, that's bound to happen in an online game. Everything you invest in should be done with the knowledge that things may change to some extent, especially if it relates to the meta. Bloodied builds are finally starting to realize that other effects exist in the game after patch 22. The people who paid $50 for explosive lasers probably felt stupid when they got duped by the thousands and were being given out for free in train stations. People who made their entire build around abusing bugs like damage overflow are now upset when that's (partially) fixed. And now that AA and explosive are buffed, people are mourning the ones they scripped/sold beforehand. Things will continue to change and you will have to continue to adjust
---
no problem
---
I appreciate it man. But I just bought a serum so I only have 700 something caps to my name. I can’t afford it lol
---
Or just wait a week or two and buy them for couple hundred caps :)
---
Pirate hat, reclaimed deep mining mask, eyepatch
---
I have to shoot slow to be accurate with my TSE handmade, panicking and going full auto on enemies running towards me kills them slower. I definitely notice the difference
---
But that's how it turned out huh 😕
---
Ah that brings back the memories...standing in a doorway crying as my feeble combat rifle barley fazed the queen as she spat acid and mirelurk spawns at me.
---
Did you have and learnt the war glaive plan ?
---
Yeah effortless fame just by copying and pasting others’ stuff no matter how accurate/inaccurate it is.
---
People have to be told this?
---
So in other words the ultracide gatling laser don't give fusion cores except if you prime it...
---
Thanks man!
---
oh my.
---
Impressive.
---
I always die these days because of in game  Bugs,the fact you dont is impressive.
---
I can be doing the Colossus event,doing really well,and suddenly i go in to a seriously slow walk in my power Armour,and Stim packing myself dosent work either = Dead.
---
Or doing a Queen event and i drop dead killed at the end of the event with nothing near me.
---
Stim packing at intense events is so hit and miss for me it annoys the shit out of [me.Like](https://me.Like) the game is determined to kill me.
---
Another one is jumping 12 foot clear from an attacking Ghoul ,and still getting Ghoul slapped = dead.
---
I accidentally auto picked a lock on a jail cell door trying to shop at someone’s vendor. Why they put a vendor directly behind a cell door is beyond me. It’s not like we can take it with us...
---
Anyways, I had to beg someone on my team to kill me lol this auto pick legendary perk is great, if I remember to use it....
---
The servers usually stop responding on Xbox every day I get on but I can just exit the world and start a new one so no biggy. Even before the update it would do that too.
---
Nah, not anymore without the bug. It's better to use rank 1 just for the ability to target specific bodyparts, and get Ground Pounder rank 2 for reload speed and hip fire aim.
---
That's like two level 50 Mirelurk Queens.
---
My old pc was poop, so I played many a game without grass. Now that I've got a nicer computer I kinda hate grass. 
---
"I can make this game look nice.. but, I can't never find what I've killed!"
---
Events are fun, Items to buy with Gold are always being added to the game at a decent rate. I play for the fun of it &amp; attain everything...but even if I had everything it would not stop me from playing. Everyone has different reasons for why they play 76, some may not play as often if they had everything...but that is not me &amp; never will be me. I tell no one how they should play or what their goals should be &amp; neither should you....thats the open world beauty of Fallout 76....There is no right or wrong way to play...but hindering people from progression is my gripe, not the way someone plays. Hindering progression is more likely the reason I stop playing over having everything the game has to offer.
---
I'm pretty sure it's unrelated, I've seen talk on a few comments and certain discord channels about an exp exploit that includes spawning in an obscene amount of a certain enemy
---
Last test was ten days ago. I even tested RR and it also suffers from ridiculous diminishing returns.
---
Yeah, Griefers have made legitimate calls for assisted suicide rather more difficult in recent months. Thankfully at the n'th attempt someone relived me of my pain.
---
I’m not looking for anything in return. Just a hoarder looking for a way to unload some stuff you might use.
---
Tbf I dont really like ppl 1 shoting everything. Specially when it's a legendary
---
My berserkers 3* The Fixer also changed at the patch to just say The Fixer
---
I didn't have server crashes before, but now it's the whole application that crashes and I need to relaunch it and log in again. Luckily I get put back with my team but I miss out on the events ending and all that.
---
That’s kind of you. I appreciate it. 
---
Just message me whenever you’re on. 
---
Killer-Soldier1
---
huh, must have changed that long ago then. my bad
---
As soon as I logged in to check my vendor, I got caught up in a daily op ( I like them all except the melee robots)  and during the daily op I got the message that someone bought the liquid courage plans.  Sorry.   Today I was also on a good team and got Elder first try and got the burrows signs.  No CAMP budget to add any though  :(
---
Sure thing, have to head out to work soon, but have the entire weekend off. I'll send you a PM later tonight.
---
i don't use a meta build, never have, but i am level 156 with full upgraded ss armor with the perks i wanted (mostly chem/food weight and AP regen, crap main perks), and some 2/3 perk weapons that i wanted.
---
Gotta tell you, from the posts ive been seeing, i was worried that i'd be outclassed now, but my double dmg at full health/25% faster fire rate ultracite gauss rifle still smokes everything in a few hits. There's nothing meta about it, not a god roll, just a decent gun, and enemies are not much more challenging than they were before. I also went ammo/special stats with all of my legendary perks. nothing fancy, the regular perks are better than most of the legendary perks anyway.
---
point is you don't have to have a crazy build. Use whatever you want, just use some common sense.
---
My grief is more the other way around. Sure, there are lots of complaints. People will always put more effort in complaining rather than praising. It's a human thing to do. But after nearly two years of following the sub, one grows tired of the unending stream of 'suggestion' posts that could and should just be labeled as a banned 'Bethesda pls' post. A lot of them even literally start off with these words.
---
Some are valid, rare ones are really original, others are not taking engine limitations into consideration, and most just seem to be an endless copy/paste that will get upvoted anyway because it works. I wonder when the next 'suggestion' for 10mm SMG attachments will hit the sub. Or for a central player hub to be made (ignoring that The Whitespring was intended to be just that, and look how deserted it is). Or technically improbable in-game displaying of player-made pictures. Nobody feels like doing a search to find feedback on an 'original' idea they get.
---
This sub desperately needs a moderated sticky with the most requested features and a ban on blatant karma farming through those topics. Think about it: nearly all requests don't get replies from Bethesda employees because that would be a neverending task. Instead those posts turn into a circle jerk, only to be reposted a few days (maybe weeks) later ad nauseam. What if we just bundled those all together and organised weekly or monthly input AMAs from the Bethesda community managers? Would we even get that far on such a schedule before the 'original idea' well just runs out? Can players face that instead of accepting the karma circle jerk status quo?
---
Now before you hurr durr about just not following the sub, I personally prefer to get my updates about the game through Reddit. I'm not going to visit Bethesda's website every week just to search for new updates and features. If I could filter out 'suggestions', I would. There's nothing new in them anyway.
---
Now feel free to take away my internet points because you don't like my opinion.
---
Make individual weapon suggestions for boosts, saying the update is boring is convincing nobody.
---
They are not balancing the game around subjective feelings that differ from player to player.
---
WAIT so daily ops is giving you shotgun ammo?! So I only use a shotgun and have used it for every daily op since the start and am only getting random ammo types. Was reading some other posts where I commented and they said it's prob a bug with shotguns. But you're saying you get shotgun ammo, wtf am i doing wrong here lmao 🤦
---
what platform? if you're on PS4 add jimnvalerie and I will set you up with ammo, gear, armor, weapons, etc to help you get going
---
First time there I was a stealth melee build at like level 10...
---
Bitch came rolling up on me and I just shat and cried in the corner.
---
yes from daily ops 😁✌️
---
4 days of shitty rng? I know it’s rng but four days!!!???
---
Thats a good amount of DMG for just adrenal reaction DMG boost, gonna try to get one for my hybrid melee build. Hitting for around 300+ in the pip boy on my ISS super sledge. Guessing a plasma glaive would probably be slightly better
---
Other then getting  rid of your healing factor try running for a few feet before you try to fast travel
---
I have to say I don't like at all Fallout's fornite game mode and only play it for the daily challenge. If they add a weekly so we have 11 weekly challenges it's OK, but if they replace one of the weekly for a NW then no, definitely not at all (and that's more alike what Beth would do if they consider adding it).
---
So no, I don't think so. :/
---
Going to have another go at this event soon.
---
After my first pathetic Solo attempt took 35 minutes and robbed me of literally all my Stim packs 60+
---
I did try and kill them all though thinking this was i had to do.
---
Not going to do it solo though.
---
Yeah but here if you say anything regarding the mode getting attention you get downvoted to hell for liking it. Example: This post
---
You're such a goober lol
---
Same it’s kinda annoying because I’m terrible at remembering which prefix is what and what they do
---
*Just because they were a waste of time to you doesn't mean they were to everyone else.*
---
Personally, I like the update. The high-level areas have been scaled down for me, and the low level areas have been scaled up. But I *also* liked being able to waltz around the Forest region, one-shotting everything that came at me and not having to think about it. 
---
There are just some days that people have, where when they come home they don't care about leveling or XP or anything of the sort. They just wanna pick stuff up for scrap or simply enjoy the scenery. Maybe that's boring to you, but it's relaxing for others. And now, a breezy waltz through the Forest takes more effort on days where we really don't want to put in any effort at all. Things that *used to be easy* are now a challenge. And most days (for me) that's fine. Some days it's not. And for some people, it's not fine most of the time or at all.
---
Not everyone plays this game the same way you do. The game should accommodate different playstyles and with this update laid-back players have been shafted.
---
Suggested the same thing regarding lock pick.  Definitely would not be any of my choices for a legendary perk, but assuming they are level 50 they could use the new infiltrator perk if they really want lockpick available all of the time
---
🤙🏻
---
Yea I run a low health (20-30%) heavy PA build and use most of the time VE heavies. Enough dmg to kill a lvl 100 supermutant in 3/4 shots and im almost invincible.
---
I had a full set of weightless wwr armor and round about 150 weapon in my inventory. So it was not that easy to handle the weight after entering a power armor. My backpack to compensate the weight of my 300 Stims and 300 rad aways. Useless. My armor with weapon weight reduction effect. Useless. 
---
I was a bloodied melee before so the special stats where almost right for the heavy build but the fucking weight. Took almost 2 days now not to be 
---
overload.
---
I upped a few of my leg stat cards... being bloodied makes you remove a lot of QOL perks... and adding points back with the leg stat cards is sooooo niicceeee, even if it' just for an extra lvl1 perk here or there on various stats, it makes a huge difference and much more able to fine tune.
---
Oh no problem, I know it's kind of hidden, but I'm an absolute PA nut so I got the plans ASAP lol.
---
So you do have access? If not, I'll still help.
---
Yes i found out that after a couple of hours it would crash like clockwork. So now I simply restart the game after a while and have been fine since. It’s probably related to graphics cache which happened when I used to play other games on PC.
---
I prefer fast 1H weapons over slow 2H.  Faster swing speed means More hits, so fast 1H can potentially do more damage than a medium or slow 2H in the same time frame.
---
for example, unmodified by foods or chems, my pip boy says a super sledge is rated at about 180 per hit, a serrated switchblade is rated about 90 per hit.  But the switchblade can hit 3x in the same time frame it takes a sledge to hit once.  90x3=270 vs 180x1=180.
---
Legendary prefixes such as instigating change the picture, as does enemy type and armor, but those are things you find out along the way, and does not cover things like deathclaw gauntlets and meathooks :)
---
Beyond that -
---
You need high strength.  More is better.
---
That said, a few common perks are
---
Incisor (armor penetration), martial artist (swing speed), blocker (deflects incoming damage), barbarian, bloody mess (damage boost).
---
Consider nerd rage (bumps DR when you are low health)
---
Common mutations:
---
Twisted muscles (do more Melee damage, but penalty is reduced ballistic weapon acuracy.
---
Healing factor.  Heals you to 100% almost immediately after combat ends.  This Reduces the number of stimpaks you need to carry. Negative is chems dont restore health quite as well.
---
negatives from mutations can be offset with classfreak.
---
Personally, I also run adrenaline, marsupial, and speed demon.
---
Armor (or the PA mod) that provides faster AP regen.  (Power attacks)
---
Motion assist servos on PA add +2 STR.
---
Underarmor that provides  +STR ( BoS shielded is one, SS underarmor is another)
---
Vampire weapons.  Give you a heath boost every hit.
---
Back to the beginning - I can take out a horde of ghouls with either a vampire switchblade or a ghoul slayers switchblade (and survive).
---
If I try that with a 2H weapon, I can still take out the crowd, but I will die many horrible deaths in the process.
---
I was hitting for 15K. I would hit the Queen and she would be like: "WOAH, DUDE, CALM THE FUCK DOWN YOU MAGNIFICENT WARRIOR". 
---
Now... She doesn't  even feel it anymore.
---
I didnt say boring
---
I did my ally quest x2 last night, and didnt have trouble completing either. Havent done the clean up since pre patch 22.
---
I will note worlds have seemed laggier since the update imo, could be partially to blame.
---
Also I always have luck moving my cursor off the npc, than back on again, and quite often the quest will advance/npc will react after I do that.
---
Yes but you are hiding behind a bush.  Mele are getting whacked in the face.
---
Yeah, im not sure if what bethesda said extends to something like that though. That and bethesda likes to go back on their word
---
Yeah, I actually did finish that Enclave quest line so I could get the scout armor mods, so I can probably fumble my way to the X01 terminal now. Just had literally no idea the plans were there. Tunnel vision. Thanks again!
---
Completely valid. I’d just argue that this patch wasn’t geared toward new people at all. This is absolutely centered around endgame. 
---
However, look at most mmos, WoW in particular. All expansions are just on top of the old one, the levels increase and the individual player power initially is diminished, yet works back as you get to the new max level. This is what has happened, but the new max level is gear and legendary perks
---
I use shotgun and also get shotgun ammo drops!
---
All the while Preston shouted unhelpful advice as he (likely) was downed.
---
Heavy guns work well too. I use a two shot gauss minigun and usually walk away with 400-500 more bullets than I went in with
---
Yeah it's almost every few hours. Thanks for the tip I'll keep my eye on when it does and restart before it to avoid it crashing at the worst moments.
---
The forest is still easy/a walk in the park though.  That's my point.  Even with all level 50's it's still 1 shot city.
---
I got two ‘caged bulbs’ back to back, at first I thought it’s some throwing weapon lol
---
If you're on PC, there's a mod that removes her dialogue completely. I have nothing in particular against Julie, but after the hundredth time hearing her tell me about how she doesn't like to talk about herself or whatever I was ready to snap.
---
Why aren't i? ): sad face
---
A Scorpion King event would be awesome, like a Load Bearing style with hidden treasure troves.
---
I have 3 immobile mules and one level 50 playable bloodied alt that sadly has also become an immobile mule. I refuse to do the ops on an alt until I get the glaive on my main as that would piss me off too much to get the untradeable one on the wrong character.
---
Yes I actually quit the game after launching a nuke then join back, just to make sure no blue screens during the fight.
---
I will do try it tonight
---
had twice now where early glitched up into the ceiling. He finally died from us shooting his legs and his dead body respawned near the exit chest at the top of the mine. Super weird.
---
Also had one where he glitched into the caved in wall where you drop down the shaft into his main room. everyone spent the rest of the event trying to explode the walls or die and respawn above the shaft to see if he was up there and all kinds of crazy things. Someone finally found a few pixels worth of Earle that was sticking out the wall so that's how he eventually died. The body wasn't able to be looted :(
---
Press the yellow console and wait for the door to be opened
---
I love her comment about Butcher Pete, it being a direct response to so many fans. "OH, IT'S INNUENDO? YOU DON'T SAY."
---
I just went in there last night... I think I just clicked the red button, although there is a terminal next to it, so maybe there was an option to "unlock it" or something as well
---
Or some are saying not to put the cursor directly over the icon you want to FT to on the map, im going to test this tonight a bit.
---
I also find that traveling to a player via the social menu fails less often.
---
The night of the patch, had 0 issues with FT, last few nights not so much, but also had the same issue with health rubberbanding, seemed the worse the lag the more it bounced back.
---
Limiting ammo drops would do nothing because ammo is dirt cheap to craft. We've had the AMMOSMITH perk for a while, we have locations with heavy lead weights, lead deposits, and workshops that not only give lots of lead, but also just straight produce ammunition. 
---
Now we have a legendary perk that gives us even more ammunition. 
---
Limiting ammo drops does absolutely nothing. They would have to nerf the entire ammo economy of the game. Nerf the perk, nerf the amount of lead the locations give, AND nerf the ammo drop rate if they ACTUALLY wanted to make a dent in how much ammo is in the game. 
---
The way I see it, it's funner to fire more bullets at something, then to fire one or two to kille verything.
---
Yes agreed i love FO76 and the only things i wish were implemented were double sided wall and either lowered amount of rep. requiered or more rep. from dailys.
---
This right here. While some weapons need boosting like one handed or pistols, mostly it's players just probably being bad and not adapting/adjusting. 
---
However players in mid game do have enemies that do increase by x3 health and enemies become way harder without damage scaling up appropriately so in some ways the game does need adjustment. 
---
These things however would fall under fair criticism instead of subjective "bad" experiences.
---
On PS4, havent crashed for months, until this week.
---
I also have two others that I bought  both 3* one was called anti armor and the other was a stalkers both say the fixer before the patch they were cool
---
Thanks, I might try pvp later on but I really want to just melt into the lore and environment. I had a bad experience the first week and never touched it again
---
What were the other rolls because i sell 3* bloodied weapons for half price scrip. So a 3* bloodied anything would be about 400caps in my vendor
---
Okay so I just saw another post here that the guy races to people's vendors and before your Camp loads they can access your stash. That's why it was your bloody Chef cuz it's a b which loads first.
---
Ya I’m a little worried about the perks but hopefully I can melt into the story and like it
---
Feel good? Boring? Makes no difference.
---
It's a subjective experience that not every player shares.
---
 What you think "feels good" might "feel bad" to another player.
---
Exactly my situation! Hopefully they notice it and give us a quick hot fix for it.
---
uhh. what is the prefix of the explosive one
---
&gt; You can't charisma your way out of every situation.
---
I mean, that's literally an option for the final boss in the first game of this franchise.
---
I've played and beaten 3, NV and 4 multiple times each with vastly different playstyles. 76 is the first time I've played a modern era Fallout game with only a couple of viable late game builds. You say rifles are an option, when what you really mean is one rifle in particular, the Fixer, with one of maybe three possible legendary prefixes out of the whole range. I'm as fed up as you are at the state of the sub this week, I don't buy into all the whining about how people can't one shot enemies any more, because there's clearly ways to get round that. My problem is that this franchise used to give us a shit ton of ways, and now there's really only one - damage boosts.
---
I don’t plan on stealing or attacking people but interacting with people will be way fun I think as long as they are not attacking me ha
---
Amazing luck 👍You got the plan right after patch?
---
Whats the perk on the explosive
---
listen new players can complain all they want.. existing players had to spend 40-60 caps all the time to fast travel to and fro.. place to place.. so they can cry because the enemies are a little stiffer.. big deal. now ppl get more XP and to play the game normally save way more caps..
---
explosive what? if it's two shot then it's up there with the best. AA is also up there.
---
My ally quest has vanished now 😔
---
Someone's cranky. Wow.
---
I’m so happy to hear that.  Embrace the cheese.  I’m a magical heavy gunner, but I don’t do the jerk moves of insta-killing bosses
---
What new BoS outfit?
---
That's what made the wasteland feel like fun. It felt dangerous. That was also no where near as prevalent as you think. If you had one piece of Chameleon gear which you can earn very easily earl on, you just ran into a building and crouched into stealth. They're not taking the time to find you. It wasn't hard to avoid people. 
---
Most people didn't give a shit, they were busy playing the game. You just stayed wary near hotspots, like Whitesprings and Watoga. 
---
And I mean....hey, every open world pvp game has bored griefers , nothing new or special.
---
No high level player should be using QOL Perks.
---
Lower levels have no choice really until they increase carry weight..
---
Life only gets easier as you rank up.
---
If any high level players are using QOL Perks.......then they are beyond help :-)
---
i think they have to be 50 to get the rare rewards.
---
It is an mmorpg to be fair, not a single player.  Are you talking about ceasar?  Also handmade are fine too.
---
dude, look back at the comments.  its very clear that i think it was a coding error.  YOU are the one who thinks it was done on purpose
---
kill the enemy fast
---
That’s what I meant by limiting it in my head, I just didn’t use enough words lol
---
Onto the sponginess, the current problem is that everything is pretty much a sponge now. If it was more limited to things like bears and death claws while bugs could take only a 1 or 2 shots, that would be great.
---
Depends on what kind of teleportation issue you are encountering.
---
I have healing factor on all my characters.
---
1. Try to fast travel, and it the map closes but you don't go anywhere. 
---
   1. The fix for this that I use that works most of the time, click to teleport, but wait a few seconds when it asks if you want to if you want to fast travel. To me, it seems like server lag is what's causing it to fail, and waiting gives the server time to catch up.
---
2. You try to fast travel and the count down box opens up the immediately closes.
---
   1. This one, waiting doesn't seem to fix, I have to move around a few steps, or leave the area completely to get it working.
---
Well it's that room with the vendor for the scout mods :)
---
Enjoy the armor, the recipe will show up as "Prototype power armor" and when crafted will be prototype colors, if you like those colors, don't change it, you can't go back once you color it silver.
---
I WILL say that there is a problem that every character i nthe game if you want to not struggle so much, have to go into Strength and Intelligence because of crafting and weight perks. That is the annoying part of the perk system. They need to better balance that shit, otherwise EVERYONE has high strength, high intelligence, high endurance, because there's no other viable build if you don't want to be annihilated or farm at all.
---

---
Disagree with second part. My jack of all trades builds with 17 weight cards doing fine
---
I agree with this to some extent. I think constructive criticism is important for the health and growth of the game. 
---
With that said general complaints like "this sucks" or "game is trays now" aren't that helpful
---
special bonuses are additive as well, so if you relied too much on agility and nothing else then you'll be easier to spot.
---
same with sneak 'multipliers', which are now also additive.
---
Its even worse with melee, im losing precious seconds in daily ops because i have to hit stuff more than id need to for it to register.
---
Level 50 takes me anywhere from 10-15 shots with the same pistol I used to oneshot them. And while I have plenty of ammo and it doesn't bother me, you are incorrect about it being just as east as it was before.
---
And you get an asinine amount of rounds for it off enemies in daily ops.
---
To be fair though if I were to walk into a kitchen appliance store, flailing my arms around screaming bloody murder without coming to any form of logical conclusion, one of two things may happen.
---
I’d be banned from the store,
---
Or police would be called and I’d still be banned from the store. 
---
In the same token if I were to enter the place with at least some kind of logical debate about said faulty product, even though irritated I’d probably be given a replacement/have my criticism listened to as it’s actually pointing out the flaws.
---
I think this guy just worded his post all wrong, it could have been constructed in a sense of: 
---
Why say the games “Broken” and “Fucked” three hundred thousand times to multiple people when you can actually point out the specific thing you’re finding so terrible.
---
It’s like how there’s an issue with Stealth Attacks in VATS for a good portion of players, myself included (others have the polar opposite problems and are running into non-VATS related stealth issues) 
---
If I just scream “I’m quitting, games fucked” it’s not actually doing anything constructive for the company, nor the player base.
---
It’s definitely not something that will stop, sure, but with criticism I’d just ask people to take a two minute breather and focus their frustration on the points that are actually bugging them rather than the point of they’re just angry.
---
They still only take me a couple of shots, but I don't use a pistol.
---
Well done !
---
Bring back the ghoul mask!
---
I have definitely noticed this.  I use an LMG, and repeated click and waits uses waaaaaay less ammo than holing the trigger down.
---
It might have just taken a few seconds to register completion, you might be on a dying server.
---
I had the Cop a Squatter daily last night, killed all the enemies, no more markers on the map, didnt get completion, so I just figured an enemy had glitched... FT'd to my camp and was half way through a nap for the exp boost when the quest completed. 
---
That same server also took 3 minutes ish to notify me that my teamates were starting/doing the daily op, even though on a dif server it was almost instant.
---
Boolits. Nice
---
I mean it does have its problems but I love the game I love the grind it gives me something to do at least they ain’t EA
---
i had heard of it hat happening months ago but still never seen actual proof of it. As far as i know it was no longer an issue.
---
300 is an odd number. As in. not odd. sounds like it was listed for 300 rather than being taken out of storage. I've bought stuff before and they've disconnected doesn't mean it was glitched.
---
&gt;Bethesda aren't poor beggars
---
i dunno, they certainly act like it.  and its not like they have any other cashcow franchise they could milk by re-releasing a single game on a dozen different platforms..  if only..
---
I love you too, but in a *prison* kind of way.
---
Im still a bit confused on one thing...
---
Yesterday for example...I did the daily ops solo and got the paladin tier. No rare. Then I did the daily ops with a friend and we unlocked the elder tier. I got a rare reward plan. We did 10 more runs back to back, all elder tier and there were no more rare rewards. 
---
This was at lunch time after server reset. About 5 hours later I logged on again and did some more daily ops with another friend. First run I got another rare plan. We did a few more runs and no more rare rewards. 
---
Why was I able to get a second reward after running 10+ runs a few hours earlier all at the elder level? Could it be because I used a different character? If that is the case, I have 5 characters all over 50 I should run paladin 5 times (once each char) then elder 5 times to get the best chance at rewards?
---
And to add, I’m not saying everything is perfect, I’m sure there are some tweaks and changes that could be valid.
---
Stealth Melee is not in a good place right now because to be most effective you need headshots, and to get sneak attacks you have to crouch, but the two don’t combine well since so many enemies just stand up all the time and are tall. It would work best against say ghouls who lay down.
---
But it’s just that, tweaks or pinpoint changes (like maybe melee should be allowed to take Concentrated Fire to target body parts)
---
But we can’t figure it out if we just throw our hands in the air
---
Yeah, I get that, and to be fair, you're right - this is a very different beast to other Fallout games. It's just frustrating to feel limited like this. I'm happily tooling around with legendary pipe revolvers and combat shotguns at the moment, because that's how I like to play, and it's great, I'm loving the new difficulty curve. But make no mistake, I can't really do any of the late game content with my current loadout. It's effectively locked away from me unless I become a death dealing tank, which is fine and my choice and I'll live with it and so on and so forth, but it doesn't really feel in the spirit of the franchise. That's my issue, and I don't think it's a very common opinion, but there it is.
---
Yeah not to mention their roadmap last year was axed half way through we need to just hit them where it hurts and uninstall already. The first major sp release for elder scrolls or fallout and Fo76 will be dead. Not that it isnt already. This is why they added it to game pass. Player count is way way down and anyone here since beta knows it.
---
Unless they use the app...
---
Ya, keeps happening to me too
---
Yea, that’s what I wanted. My dreams out the window
---
Ironic post of the Day much,complaining about Bitching,then bitching you wont believe its truly fixed until this remains the case for much longer bwhaaaaaaa.
---
Bitching about People complaining.
---
Love this place. :-)
---
I will tell you that I no longer have to pick a lock or unlock a terminal at any level and I can do a silo run in half the time because of it.  no regrets.
---
Personally I’m not super mad at the bloodied nerfs but now I can’t really use my bloodied heavy energy weapons because they got pretty heavily nerfed, lve switches to furious and instagating because the damage is now higher but my shotgun has very little damage change which I’m not mad about.
---
Yes you can. I have joined teams and fast traveled and got in the mine. I’ve also fast traveled and ended up outside of mine and walked in but that was start of event. I have done this multiple times. I don’t know why it hasn’t worked for you. But I’ve done it and the other person has. So it’s not in his head
---
Ok, I found this thread that seems to clarify it. 
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ivbv6w/psa\_daily\_ops\_are\_character\_based\_not\_account/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ivbv6w/psa_daily_ops_are_character_based_not_account/)
---
So non-auto got hit pretty hard in the damage recalculation and sneak absolutely does not work in the daily ops. You may need to tweak your perks or work on getting better gear. My second character is a heavy gunner using power armor at level 85 and using a vampire gatling gun I was killing most of the super mutants with 5-7 shots.
---
My main is a stealth based low health commando. I have had to adjust his playstyle to incorporate power armor in the daily ops since I can't stealth in there but damage is not a problem at all with my Quad Fixer or TSE Handmade. I'm not saying you need to go bloodied or anything, but maybe a few tweaks could really help you out.
---
People complain when the broken things they were exploiting get fixed, or if they can't use it. That's why we saw so much screaming about stealth, in an event where the entire point is that you're actively in combat *the entire time*.
---
It's *finish this while getting shot at for 8 minutes*, not *hide for 8 minutes*.
---
Its a ghoul slayer so nothing special
---
Melee build alternating between vampire switchblade And SS ghoul slayers switchblade, depending on location.
---
  What I’ve noticed is, yes, it takes a couple more hits to kill, but given the enemies are now higher level, thats not really a surprise.
---
Fortunately, I’m high enough level I could slot a number of legendary perks to help offset all that.
---
Boosted Luck, which let me add bloodymess2 for a bit more damage.  Added a point to class freak (now3), to better offset negatives from my 5 mutations)
---
Added what rads, so now I do not get rad damage from ghouls (or anything else, really). That was a great benefit since I alos have a high capacity backpack, which significantly reduces RR.
---
Added take one for the team, which also boosted damage.  Added another point to nerd rage, which helps in low health situations.
---
So with the perk tweaking, so far, it has pretty much balanced out the higher level enemies.
---
The biggest thing/issue is roaming the forest - which I still tend to do without PA - I cant be as relaxed as I was pre-patch.  More than once (shame on me) I’ve been caught by surprise and murdered by roving packs of L50 liberators.
---
i will try number one, number 2 is caused by the time, and moving out of range of enemies or reason for timer often fix it  
---
thanks for the tip
---
Before you go talking about other states, please do your research. I will preface this by saying that we as a nation failed in our response to the pandemic. We failed at all levels from the citizens themselves up to our elected leadership. We are still failing despite being almost eight months into this. 
---
1) The spikes in cases are not all people who currently have COVID and contagious. Anyone with antibodies present in their blood are counted as being positive, even if they are long past their main symptoms. This means that someone who was exposed to the virus three months ago but didn't get tested until recently would have been counted as part of the current cases. Looking at the "new cases" reported by the DSHS for 9/16/2020, of the 3,409 cases reported, 2,617 were old cases included in the total. This, along with some individuals having results reported from more than one location and getting counted more than once, is something that has been going on for months, and is not unique to Texas.

2) The death toll is not limited to those who expired due to COVID related issues. As with the reporting of active cases, simply having antibodies present in your blood is enough to have your death added to the toll. This came as a result of the DSHS changing how they identified COVID deaths, which unfortunately was supposed to have the opposite effect, however mistakes keep getting made here. 
---
Numbers released today are changed tomorrow and further altered days after. This is mostly at county level and then added together for statewide counts, but the changes can vary anywhere from a few dozen to over a thousand. Until our leadership gets it together and we get a proper working system in place that is used by everyone, our numbers will remain very much skewed.
---
I didnt say their a bad company just its not a valid excuse. Besides as already stated they didnt even say its covid related they are just a shitty team. Under staffed and unproductive period. 2 years in a row now they released roadmaps and failed to deliver. They are lying to their community and it will not stop.
---
In my mind there are early game, mid game, and late game weapons.  A pipe gun or hunting rifle is early game.  A handmade or fixer is late game.  I don't think you should be able to do end game content with a pipe rifle because it doesn't make any sense. Why would a rifle with a wooden receiver do as much damage as a finely tuned military sniper rifle?
---
I agree with all that. I just think it’s unfortunate that there’s no precedent for an honest free respec when the game undergoes balance changes despite that being a commonplace good faith practice these days.  I’m speaking for the sake of the games longevity rather than for myself specifically because (knock on wood) the way I’ve been playing since the start, just doing my own thing and never chasing a specific meta like bloodied, etc. has led to me never being massively inconvenienced or nerfed.   But I feel for anyone who hasn’t been so lucky or who has taken their time testing different builds only to have been penalized for moving special points around too often only to find out that any detours they have taken to their ideal build will now be a detour again. Stuff like that.
---
You don’t have the pressure of completing your daily tasks. Sure, some rewards are very nice, but in the end its about having fun. Some people, including myself have the urge to complete things. Me personal, I try to keep my todo list short. And I need to be vigilant that I don’t put the pressure on myself to get the lvl 100 score... In the end... it’s still a game.
---
God gamers are thick (and I don’t mean fat but that’s also true). If you don’t want to get an incomplete product DONT BUY IT
---
See tip above
---
I’ve done this couple times. It always worked for me. I join team fast travel to them end up in mine fight Earle. So you’re correct it does work that way
---
r/gatekeeping at its finest.
---
I've launched 2 (on console) in the last week, which is down from my 4-6 per week previously.   Both were dropped on  Morgantown to  farm High Radiation Fluids (was running low on Violet Flux)
---
Colossal Problem I don't bother with anymore, because it's too much of a crap shoot about who you wind up with.  The last three times I ran it, everybody bailed when we didn't melt Earle within the first 5 minutes.
---
Scorchbeast is still fun, and will probably launch some nukes this weekend.
---
But the Daily Ops are a great new addition, and I think most people, myself included, are working on getting good at them to the point of neglecting SBQ and CP.
---
Yup, now they have better loot and give a lot more xp
---
In that case AA. Don't waste the 5 extra points for demo expert
---
That's OK I'll still drop the soap for you baby
---
are you suggesting i might not have the issue on a private server ?
---
I'm new to the game so idk whats really going on... All i know is at lvl 26 gattling laser go brr and the the mole rats hate power armor... Ive had to replace pieces more than once a day because of it. Andnits difficult for a new player to find power armor pieces that are on level and can take more than a few hits. I first got my power armor at lvl 10 and vouldnt use parts till lvl 15 and Idk where to find parts that are around my level (currently lvl 26) i keep finding lvl 40 and above pieces... The best thing i do is make ammo and find guns in better condition. At this point until i can at least reach level 50 so all the good gear i keep finding isnt just caps and scraps. I already got a bunch of lvl 50 stuff in the stash waiting for when the time comes. 
---
All in all im really just royally cucked right now... And I'm doing the Modus missions so i can get general rank.. Fuck me am I right?
---
Oh absolutely. That one is solid right out of the box without any additional investment. Good QoL choice.
---
If you wanted your character to be able to do that, that’s a niche enough benefit and I also can’t thing of any alternate card that would do something similar but better OR any meaningful way it could/would be nerfed, either.
---
Seems like there's been quite a few people asking that question lately, so probably so.
---
Yeah this guy probably went to someone not in the mine or just didnt try this lol
---
what system do you play on? If you were a stealth sniper type of player, I’d assume you use perks like rifleman, expert rifleman, and master rifleman, concentrated fire, lone wanderer (if you play solo), covert operative, or mister sandman? All those will increase damage for stealth/rifle and if you have them maxed out they do like 3.5x regular damage if you’re in stealth mode.
---
Work perfectly.  Again, appreciate it.
---
We know. In the Daily OPs. What we are talking about here is OUTSIDE the Daily OPs.
---
Yes you are totally right, no way I could ever know what im talking about compared to your superior knowledge and intellect sorry for disturbing you.
---
Hell schools are back in class so its ok for children to be at risk but not people who make video games hmmm...
---
I took video of it happening!  You are not alone.
---
Thanks all. Made a few tweaks with your advice!
---
My addition:
---
I took the survival syringe perk and don't need food or water anymore. Sold it all. Swapped grocers backpack for chemist. Swapped travelling pharmacy for max incisor.
---
 Damage now is about where it was before on all non-massive enemies and bosses. I'll take it I guess!
---
lol yeah I’ve gotten vault 94 stash four days in a row
---
healing factor is really great but if it cause the bug, i would remove it, but to do so, i need to gamble and remove a lot more mutation ( i know my luck ), i will be the last one to go
---
Well you can either consider your self really lucky or unlucky ;p
---
Welcome to now.
---
Like I said, all weekend lol
---
Being dismissive is still more constructive than being a dick.
---
Shit paper bags, pls.
---
Seems much easier with more players.  We finished yesterday's DO in 6:20
---
If you want to play, and are on XBox, let me know  :)
---
I usually clean out my PS4 and organize the data base every 3 months or so.
---
Try doing that. It does help a lot. I use to crash, over heat and freeze up quite a bit on multiple different kinds of games until I started showing some love to my console.
---
Green hood and scout mask.
---
I took on the Diseased Grafrton Monster in Whitesprings.
---
I used to one shot this Dude for fun.
---
He killed me,i couldn't reload quick enough to kill him.
---
I was on the Minibus near the Sulphur  water spout.
---
Went back to get my Loot Bag and it was some how underneath the Bus.:-(
---
Sorry to hear that! I hope you’re able to have a better time this go around. There is a ton to explore! The game can sometimes be difficult but just take your time and be patient. I have ~900 in the game. It really can be a lot of fun.
---
I remember coming from fallout 3, where you could just go any direction and explore.  and going north (instead of south) and just getting absolutely wrecked....
---
They could even just make say, 50% of the cars already exploded and not regenerating.
---
It would cut down the explosive fps hits, and look appropriately "festive".
---
Gaslight much? Trump, is that you?
---
I’m also going to try a melee stealth build, but that will take a bit longer to get the character ready.
---
I do see a potential issue that since so many enemies stand up, and since the most effective thing would be sneak attacks to the head, the distance can be an issue.
---
It’ll work fine against shorter enemies, or enemies that lie down (like ghouls when not attacking), but the ever active super mutants could be more “hard mode”
---
I’ll still give it the old college try, I think i have a nice combat knife somewhere i can trt
---
Then go play Minecraft? 
---
Or Fallout 4 with God mode? 
---
This isn't a single player game that can cater to weekend warriors, or even casual players like myself. 
---
They need to ensure high level, long term players still have to try. While trying to maintain a new player friendly balance. 
---
On my non optimized mains, game is still pretty easy peasy. 
---
On my new toon. Level 25. It's been tough, but not grueling. Died a few times. Have to use cover. Have to sometimes run away.....
---
It was marketed as a complete game. We got an incomplete one. The one who's thick here is you, pal.
---
Well dang, course my only other characters are level 1 and.. 5 i think. Plus if I did get something nice to send to my main I have no way to safely do it. No 1st and no friends.
---
Oh sweet summer child
---
Even though it’s potentially less exciting than some of the other options, it definitely seems like a sensible choice.
---
Hell, you don't need to min-max to put out obnoxious damage, be nigh invulnerable, carry lots of stuff, etc. Just take a bit of time to put some thought into your perk point allocation and perk card loadout. My build can do ALL of that, while still using heavy weapons, 2H melee weapons, shotguns, and rifles effectively.
---
You will be amazed at what you can do when you ask yourself: "Is this card really that helpful?", "Is this card really worth it at max rank for the points it costs?", and "Do I really need this card in ALL the time?".
---
You get diminishing returns from quite a lot of perk cards after first level, and it is not always terribly advantageous to further upgrade. So don't do it if you don't want to! You don't really need to!
---
Is more than 1 point of adrenaline really worth the cost? NO. You get +36% damage for 1 point!, then another 24% for 4 more! Same is true for tenderizer, demolition expert, and others (with exceptions on demo expert, however this is true at least for the legendary explosive effect).
---
The damage perks for weapons is a big one. You get 30% extra damage for only 3 points (1 in each card), whereas 60% from all three cards upgraded to level 3 is 9 points. That is 6 points you could be using for other things.
---
And oh sure, if you can take those extra points and be specialized for a particular weapon, that's great! Go for it! But if you only have 3 perk points to work with you can get almost as much for a lot less!
---
I am fairly sure that is just nukes auto-launching periodically.
---
Ok. 
---
My main point is everything is not back to normal as he states repeatedly. It very much still is a real threat and many companies are still figuring out how and where work will be performed. 95% of people are not back to the office in the same way as pre-covid.
---
Any game made after around April 2018 is supposed to work fine with name changes. That said, Fallout 76  hasn’t caused any issues within my group of friends.
---
It's not really that simple. See, MMOs. FO76 is classically defined as one. Unfortunately. It isn't entirely by definition, but it is described as such. Games have service models. That's what they are. They service you.
---
Somehow with my not nearly fully optimized build main, a rifleman build....
---
These trash mobs are still trash. I have to use a stim occasionally. That's reasonable.
---
Well I’ve gotten the burrows sign plan three days in row *sigh* rng at its best
---
I had no idea what organizing the data base was, but just looked it up online and thank you for that! Will give it a try and hopefully it'll help. Cheers
---
Nope, privates can be laggy too. Generally they are a tad bit better.
---
But I jumped in one last night to do the workshop weekly, did the first claim and left the server because it was so laggy, the second one I joined was much better.
---
May have been partially on my end, b/c everything was slow, but even with a private your still connecting to a remote server.
---
I just spent 3 hours playing Nuclear Winter. Every death except for two were because of a grenade, M79 or more often a Gauss Shotgun.
---
It was fun, until I downed two people and died from a grenade that had no indicator (signaling I was outside of the blast radius).
---
It was really fun when my and my teammate won fights against people who ambushed us until a guy with a gauss shotgun spammed the trigger until we were dead, which took less than 2 seconds.
---
Explosive weapons have been a problem since day 1 and nobody will play this game for an extended amount of time without running those. They effectively killed it. But the real blame is on Bethesda for making this, ignoring player issues and then ditching it. As if any BR survives that way.
---
I liked it and it is enjoyable when frog leg/explosive combo people aren't around you. But that's not very often.
---
Great advice. I feel like now that they have added Daily Ops, there is one more thing people with a Completionist mindset will focus on. 
---
It is almost too much now to make sure you got your 1400, your 150, your Score, your Elder rank. 
---
So relax, play the game the way you want to, don’t worry if you don’t get the Watoga Forever Flag plan or whatever.
---
I guess I’m just gonna hand  them out I bet you I get it tomorrow too
---
I have the same experience and I run bloodied, unyielding set with all the rifleman perks, tank killer, bloody mess, follow through, etc. It usually takes 3-4 hits for a mole rat or level 50 mob. Anything 75 - 100 takes 3 or more shots, which is pretty much the clip. That assumes I hit and the shot doesn't miss in Vats. It makes Gun- Fu pretty much useless.
---
My saving grace was to break out the TSE lever action which kills most things in 2 shots... but that still means I reload after every other kill.
---
I'm thinking lever actions and hunting rifles are done for.
---
We can not sneak in daily ops they have a mutation that they see us. So if that’s why you’re asking if sneak isn’t working then no it’s just the daily ops. I am a sneak commando and I can sneak everywhere fine except daily ops
---
It's fine for me. I can stand on a super mutants head while I'm shooting him and he's looking around going huh what's that?
---
yeah, I unequipped my legendary perks (minus agility) just to put myself in a position more people may be.
---
What rads is great though, I can sit in water with no issues
---
3\* Swords...3\* Swords everywhere.
---
Your drop gives me hope.
---
Electric absorption, funky duds, sizzling style, taking one for the team are essential imo. I took stat cards for my last two. Will swap in ammo card whenever I need to make a ton of ammo.
---
How do you know it's 20?
---
yeah i think it is. my vats damage is ass and i get detected in my chinese stealth armor with all my perks without even firing a bullet. stealth damage also seems fucked.
---
wut. 2mm ec is one of the cheapest ammos you can have. it doesn't require gunpowder and you can make a few thousand last a long time. steel and lead. that's it.
---
and with the new daily ops i'm going in with 1200 and coming out with 1800+
---
I’m not sure what you are talking about. NYC has 1 million students who are all virtual right now. 
---
My state is a mix between hybrid learning and 100% remote. No schools are 100 in person right now. 
---
And the debate around whether schools are safe right now is very much ongoing. A 20 something year old teacher just died in South Carolina from covid. 
---
I can only assume you don’t have kids or just haven’t been paying attention by the comment.
---
Go back and read, you said:  
---
&gt; if Beth made the times different on purpose, there is a 100% chance that they did it for some **nefarious** (low impact) reason 
---
Do you know what nefarious means? it means  (typically of an action or activity) wicked or criminal. 
---
You are basically saying that they did it on purpose, for some wicked or criminal reason. 
---
I suggested so that not everything was dumped on at once. And someone else posted a link showing Valseek saying they are planning on changing it.
---
So it could have been a mistake. it could have been on purpose. There's nothing in what Valseek says to prove either side. 
---
But sorry, when you say they are being nerfarious, you just undermind any point you have. Because they didn't do it for criminal or wicked reason.
---
too smelly for my car.
---
i'll add glitter to the eggs.
---
glitter is evil incarnate.
---
Mine is still named the exact same thing because I gave it a custom name.  All the guns I use have custom names.  You are allowed 50 from what I remember.
---
Well and lever guns already break ludicrously fast, add TSE onto that and you're repairing after a single event.
---
Junkies because Tank Killer and piercing mag mods make AA worthless to me.
---
"Why take away functionality on a bug" - I don't quite understand what you mean here but a bug in a video game is when something is unintentionally not working as it should.
---
So yeah nobody meant for this bug to happen in the first place.  
---
Personally I prefer it this way, I find pvp without vats to be refreshing.
---
I don’t know they attack me and then I explode them when I kill them
---
godspeed
---
they're pretty much daily quests but don't fall into the region rotation that actual daily quests get
---
Lol I’m on Xbox I’d give you the stash plan for the sign plan if you want I’d love to have something other than the stash box
---
I always have been a interchanged shotgun/melee/ non pa heavy gunner. Great combo I love it
---
Legendary enemies are still enemies, doesn't really make them bosses or different from other pools besides regen health but thats from my own perspectiveand can see otherwise. But then again, no one would waste resources to fight an unlegndary creature so no point in making them.
---
Indeed! Totally use way less than even 10 per enemy, which is the lowest they drop!
---
Wait... you guys play Daily Ops for rewards?? I use it to increase my ammo reserves!
---
Nobody knows for sure, but tbh that is likely
---
if you can repeat it even with a cooldown it's repeatable. 
---
thanks for coming to my ted talk.
---
Commas wouldve helped me.
---
I mean, why would they take away game mechanics to accommodate for the bug rather than fix it.
---
If you’re new. Heavy guns, full hp, PA
---
So you can do them again in like 20 hours?
---
Yeah. Starting a new toon patch drop night, o noticed immediately I needed to use cover(no more just letting mobs swarm you while standing out in the open)
---
I also had to be prepared pre encounter and even had to run a few times when I wasn't. 
---
It was great. More difficult, but more tension. Enjoying it as a new alt.
---
So i agree too melee isn’t good enough for end game bosses end games bosses like earle should be soloable not everyone likes playing with a tm Bethesda nerf melee too much we aint asking for wht it use to be but as of now melee is useless besides for common adds if i can do more dmg with a flamer tht doesn’t make sense too me should be reworked melee should beable to do half the dmg it use to not 90% less of it
---
Rename it to something that means something to you.
---
My favourite way to play Fallout 4 is high Agility melee with Blitz. As I progress through the game, I get better and better melee weapons, but I never need to pivot into using guns and respec my character in the late game - melee is always fine. Alternatively, I can go power armour and heavy guns pretty much right out of the gate if I want. There are also pistols and rifles that will melt with the right perks, but the point is, once you've picked something you like, you don't have to change. It doesn't feel like we're getting that with 76, which is ok, but doesn't feel very Fallout-y.
---
Ha, too real
---
If that were the case why differentiate repeatable and daily in the first place? Im sure there's a difference
---
Damn, i‘m on ps4. Would love to have that plan :)
---
I have them on bro , it ridiculous gunsmith 5star and my prime Gatling leaser good for an hour 
---
The agi 3 perk armor perk and my armor stay broken
---
Decor, it is the electronics aisle anyways.
---
i believe so, i don't know the exacts but if your doing them along with your other daily quests they'll reset at the same time
---
This would be the best way to do it so people could get it out of the way quickly without actually having to play it. The game mode is a mess and if you're competitive it will put you in a bad mood because most of the people winning only run a build new players can't compete against.
---
what quests are you referring to?
---
They live longer so they have more of a chance to see you.
---
 "What do you mean my lv25 pipe wrench medic build isn't able to solo silos anymore how could Todd do this to me :C"
---
That's not an honest representation of the event. It's shorter than Fasnacht, has varied prank-type activities like blowing up cars, forking lawns, and lighting bonfires.
---
As for the lag...I didn't have any problems and I have basic internet and I'm running the game on a standard PS4. Not sure what kinda potato OP was playing on
---
The free range ones get killed as soon as they come out the ground . The only spongey SQ in the game is the one at the end of project paradise
---
I’ve gotten 3 vault 94 outfit plans and liquid courage recipe. Yesterday was the first time getting two rewards
---
Damn
---
With the extra weeklies and the huge buff to earning xp across the board the scoreboard feels ways easier to complete now. I haven't grinded hard or done nuclear winter dailies and I hit rank 22 today.
---
Oh no! Resources are less easy to obtain!?!
---
Your character isn't a god at everything?!?!
---
You may have to buy ammo if you don't want to risk farming it??!?!
---
How unfortunate.
---
So basically I have too many also: I drop them for new players.
---
Lucky
---
Nothing like having 1/3 of your inventory weight consisting of just stims.
---
Free lead! Lol.
---
If you want the stash I’d trade it for the outfit plan if you want I’m on Xbox
---
People do the events in the mire and forest for the chance at the rare uniforms. Majority do not go to that or mainky to finish up SCORE challenges.
---
AA is good, Ghoul Explosive would be great for the Line In The.....whoops, not anymore. Honestly, carry both if you got the room. I carry an AA and a Vamp as my  "Get out of Hell" cards
---
Got a quad lever action and speed demon. It works out great. Just need the right gun.
---
All the kids in Ohio are back to school classrooms as well as many other states. Hell I even have kids riding the bus so...
---
Bro it only takes a half way decent item and a couple perks to be effective. Maybe at low levels it sucks but people are WAY overblowing the damage issue.
---
Theres a couple waistland doctors on one of these subs i think a donation in these hard times of coved-76 would be much appreciated  lol
---
I think they're going to try to fix that.  They mentioned they weren't happy with the numbers currently.  But yes, you shouldn't have to switch weapon types.
---
I read an article on this a while back about people spending 100's 1000's in mobile games like clash of clans and such, and why they do it.
---
Aside from the whales that play, some actually made sense. One guy said "I was spending 100's each weekend at the bar with my friends, and finally I realized this wasn't good for me, so instead I spend that same amount having fun in other ways, like playing these various games..."    Makes sense...
---
Remember it's those spending money that keeps development going for all the F2P crowd (after initial purchase in this case for this particular game).
---
Yeah, I've fought two 1* ones in the last couple of days. I just thought it was weird considering between level 20 and 100 I didn't see any. Now if they could just show me another flatwoods monster.  I only saw one once on top of a hill at like level 30. By the time I got up there it was gone.
---
Clearly I haven't played in a while. How would one obtain this outfit?
---
Well maybe this year it will be something new added to it. I don’t know, I wanted to experience it but then he said that. But you described something that seemed fun
---

---
If you're referring to ops the uplink mode we have stealth doesn't work in there by design.
---
If you're talking outside of ops and just regular play I find the opposite my stealth is working better then ever.
---
It's a boss monster if it's dying fast bethesda did it wrong.
---
I don't use any ultracite ammo, so I could see Ammo Factory still being useful for that.
---
but why though?
---
Operation tidy really
---
I read a while ago that there was a new map datamined Mire/Harpers Ferry based.  
---
Could be interesting
---
🤦 thank you, I really appreciate it
---
Have you tried using adrenal with your lever of choice? Run a bit lower hp if you can. It'll increase your damage.
---
With bloodied lever at around 30% hp I could 2 shot lv 100 mutants.
---
As for durability.. i don't get it. You run a semi auto build so it shouldn't be issue. You using weapon artisan and gunsmith?
---
Mainly for the reason the enclave bunker gives you the location of the cargobots 🤣🤣🤣
---
Damn wish I actually built my other characters up. I had one which was my beta character and they’re the highest level at level 10. All the rest are level 2 just holding 1000 weight of weapons

---
Well I hope nothing bad happens. To act like there is consensus that everything is safe is either misinformed or disingenuous. This pandemic is far from over.
---
Bethesda checked out for the rest of the year. This is what is happening by default. All the new content (aside from bomb drop event) is coming 2021.
---
It’s a nice QoL change for that mission, but you can always just go pick up all the meat piles after the mission ends.
---
If they did implement this feature people would be complaining to Beth that they want it to auto pick up caps and or ammo in the wasteland.
---
Hmm, all those sacs I've scrapped.. dangit.
---
Or dont complain on reddit and we wouldnt see it :)
---
She needs to walk her ass over to Boston and pick up some missing songs from Diamond City.

Give me back my Skeeter and let me crawl out thru some fall out damnit!

Yo uranium fever is a legitimately fun event now.  I've only had good times.
---
Or just find them, either way its the same thing. Not my problem youre to lazy.
---
I’m not your kemosabe, amica
---
No I face tank these guys. I literally stand still for 90% of my fights.  I have found with the movement speed of some mobs that running is pointless.
---
As godd Howard once said,"who's laughing now??"
---
Damnnn 900, I think I just got the mindset to not like it and Bethesda opening week games is never good haha.
---
I've no interest in playing bloodied, and I run tier 5 adrenaline.
---
Ahhh, so you were just *pretending* to be stupid the whole time.  no worries then.
---
You were the only one who believes that they set it that way on purpose. So by all means, i would love to hear what totally-not-predatory reason you think they had for setting the reset up that way.
---
also, me being proven correct by a different comment on a different post, really isnt evidence for your side dude.
---
If you say so.
---
I’m not you amica, venn
---
No its extreme sarcasm in the hopes my response would illicit deeper thought than "hurr durr he is a troll".
---
My mistake for having faith in you.
---
that doesn't make sense either, they didn't "take away game mechanics to accommodate for the bug".  They just haven't fixed it.  
---
It's a bit weird but they had it working on the pts, so my only guess is pvp is an absolute bottom priority for Bethesda.
---
Oh okay. It's going fine for me at least.
---
 I'll do the easy ones but I'm not worried about it as a whole. I finished like three weeks early last time w/o buying any levels.
---
Yeah I'm keeping an eye out for a quad.
---
The secret to weight management is to ask yourself questions like "do I really need 100 stimpacks" and "Do I really need these drugs". The answer is NO! I carry like 30-40 stimpacks at most. Same goes for grenades, purified water, etc. This is especially true if you don't have weight reduction perks.
---
Also, make sure you don't have a bunch of gunpowder, Ore, and certain other misc items in your inventory. The flux ingredients are obnoxiously heavy for example.
---
Improbable but not impossible... rng is a cruel mistress good luck :)
---
Ah yes, because not wanting to go on a goose chase for an hour is being lazy rather than just finding one, just shut it
---
The chemist backpack is a damned godsend in this new world. I used to wander around with 10 stimpaks at a time... no more
---
Lay off the drugs kid....
---
The only thing I don't understand, is if the first run through manages to complete it at ELDER level,  do you get three chances at a rare reward ( 5% roll, a 10% roll, and a 80% roll) or just an 80% roll?
---
It's pretty much the same as always. Meta didn't really change much other than melee suffering more than most
---
I could only place that sign near the edge of a wall, almost like it snaps in place there.
---
Just got it last night on an alt, love the design, goes great with the BOS beret.
---
They flattened the power curve and added consistency which was sorely needed. By making all damage boosts additive you make balance and make it far easier for players to understand the damage multipliers without having to memorize which ones were multipliers vs additive.
---
Ops also fixed a major issue with the game which was a lot of weapons were prohibitively expensive to maintain for regular use. I've always wanted to do a plasma flamer build but the ammo grind was so tedious it was never worth it but now with Ops I can actually run ammo eating weapons since there is a fun way to obtain ammo for them.
---
I know this but I’m still gonna complain cuz ughhhhh
---
That would be cool. Like I said, I like my loadout right now, but I can already tell it's not gonna be long before I need to rethink it - I did a supply run through West Tek on Monday, but I'm pretty sure I'd get absolutely fucking shredded if I tried it now! All the complaints this week have been from people whining that they're not one shot heroes any more, but that was never a fun idea for me in the first place.
---
I mostly play by myself so I haven't done ops, from what I've read it's a group thing.
---
I never used Guass because the 2mm charges were very difficult to find out in the wild, so I assumed they would cost to craft. I guess they don't, problem solved.
---
Me personally, don’t think it matters, you should still play the game you want, I have a stealth/sniper build and I feel fine with where I’m at in the game rn, I’m about to make it to level 50 and I’m pretty satisfied with my build and progress.
---
Me too.
---
We got Dogs abuse on here,unforgiving lot :-)
---
I suspect many others did to.
---
OP says they shouldn't let you target people in Vats till its fixed.
---
Which is backwards
---
Ah ok.  I’ll prob work my way towards that as well.  I think I have enough treasury notes to finish my armor set PLUS backpack but the bullion cap per day/ week is slowing me down LOL .  Ah well, maybe next week
---
Play the game how you want man, I had a minimalist camp by the munitions factory since the beta. I only recently moved it because I wanted a change of pace and haven't touched it since
---
Melee build?
---
I used to dilute all my stims since I barely needed healing as a bloodied. But now I use full strength and regularly spam them when an enemy even glances at me wrong just to see if I can even make a dent in my stockpile. The number still goes up every single day.
---
Nope, you can go bare bones and not lose anything. Pretty camps are just for show.
---
What are you trying to show me? Only 38% are going back in person full time lol
---

---
You get them from finding the bots by going to a terminal in the bunker
---
I agree whole heartedly but unfortunately neither my job making ammo for the US gov cares nor the truancy officer care. Sad state but true.
---
I wasn’t sure if it was intended or not but they did nothing during the Daily Ops today. I thought that was a good option to counter the mutation but no one was highlighted.
---
I am pretty sure I had a non legendary fixer with dark matter skin before the update. Now it’s just “combat rifle”. Weird.
---
Here is my current one I am working on but he's only level 23. This may not be the final. I am not sure if I will use 2handed melee or unarmed yet. Right now I am using 2handed.
---

---
Patch 23 is scheduled for later this year, and I'm sure it will continue the trend of fixing bugs.
---
It was a great idea honestly
---
Tbh yea I need them at least with my old build. But your right since I wear PA I don't really often use Stims or rad aways. I don't use drugs and trust me im a master of weight control and especially the misc tab is always clear haha.
---
Time to let the Stims and rad aways go lol
---
I am a very small sample and I know there are many ways to get even more XP but simply with Herbivore, Cranberry Relish and Well Rested I was getting 25%-30(?)% more XP. 500+XP from a Super Mutant Demolisher at West Tek. Now throw in other food buffs for intelligence and you are looking at even more. There is a streamer named Battlestation1 on Twitch who put out an XP guide and he rolls naturally like it is double XP EVERY day. I don't have the patience or the items for all that but it is insane what you can do and even more so now with the higher level enemies.
---
Yes, you're right, it's Power Patcher that applies to power armor. Either way power armor degradation is way more forgiving than it is for regular armor, even without perks.
---
I have that problem all the time, I have to switch in and put of VATS to get it to register
---
Money over people will always be the American way despite my love for the country and its people.
---
+1 for scrotchbeast
---
Not sure how that would prevent incoming damage from breaking armor.
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
animatronic clown is from the next treasure hunter event I think.
---
Hunting rifles are great for level 5 squirrels. I don't have the science or facts to back it up, but I could almost....almost... swear that VATS has been strangely better with the Lever. (Auto grenade launcher too oddly enough). Instigating Lever has been good to me this week, but yeah, depending on the effect, Levers are going to be tough
---
I am trying 😊
---
Not from the daily ops, it's from the new (not yet in game) Treasure Hunter stuff. Apparently people that had pails were able to craft them and get the new loot.
---
Yep. It's a treasure hunter event reward for the event that starts October 15th. They updated the loot pool a little early so some people have them already.
---
Yes, I stand corrected...
---
Point made but I think the 'leveling' should maybe pop in at lvl 50, once they get most game mechanics and how to actually play.
---
I am reluctant to start dismantling my sneak/commando/Sniper build yet though.
---
Sure i hear daily OPS it is deliberately supposed to be switched off.
---
Not sure it is supposed to be in game though.
---
Depending on Sneak VATS Kills to get the job done is a bit of a struggle at the moment.
---
I think this might be fixed.
---
I think part of the problem too is how do you convincingly make a pistol better than a machine gun?  There's a reason there's no such thing as a trench pistol from ww1.  If you want to play like that, a game like Hitman 2 might be better.  
---
But on an open battlefield with lots of enemies, I'd kind of be mad if someone with a pistol could do as well as someone with a machinegun.  Maybe there need to be more stealth areas, but I don't want content gated behind playstyles.
---
Sigh.
---
Is the reason you're armour is breaking so much is because you're a melee build?
---
Does escape artist lets you stay stealth with a revolver? because it doesn't have a surpressor.
---
I am sure I lost a lot of loot in the grass over time lol.
---
A lot of people have multiple characters, so they only run daily ops once on each to elder rewards. I'll join a server, start a team and run an op. Often by the time another teammate joins, I have solo'd the op and am leaving to go on another character.
---
I've been a melee/heavy gunner for my bloodied build but goddamn, my heavy guns eats through ammo like a motherfucker.
---
I don’t even get put In groups with people I just have to do the by myself
---
Which platform are you on? That's either really unlucky or really messed up.1
---
Ok so only half and might I add its the poorest student with the least resources and the most federal grant money to lose those with money are going private.
---
All I want is to fast travel without trying 17 times.  😂
---
Heart emote is the universal thank you message.
---
What the actual fuck?!? 
---
I never denied I said that.
---
Your the one thinking they did it for nefarious purposes.
---
I thought they did it to spread things out at reset. Nothing nefarious about that.
---
Seriously you got it all fucked up wrong and just don’t want to say oops, yeah my bad.
---
I will always love fallout because evryone hates it..lol.
---
By the way 246 dmg?thats it? My weapons do 3 times that damage.you need to setup your perk cards a little my man.
---
3 shotgun 3 expert shotgun 3 master shotgun 3 skeet shooter for better accuracy and grouping.3 enforcer for crippling.that right there with a combat shotgun will kill everything, except the big bosses , in 3 to 4 hits easy.same with non auto rifles.i do both at the same time.lever action is almost like the .50 cal from new vegas.
---
Keep in mind you have to get close and personal.
---
I would too.
---
That makes a lot of sense actually. I have a few characters but I only use one.
---
I highly recommend psychotats and berry mentats. Stay away from buffout drugs, they can kill bloody builds if they wear off at a bad moment.
---
The only things important to a camp are the utilities it holds.  Get a resource extractor though.
---
Joining existing groups is a crapshoot unless you see the pop-up that it was just created. By the time I have joined most groups they were already done and forgot to change the group to something else. I just start a new group and run it with whatever randoms join.
---
I'm in PC but I think it probably has to do with what Cattabliss said
---
Or just roaming around in the world. Sorry you're a new player and you have to be spoon fed.
---
It's just constructive grieving, they know they can annoy low level players and benefit in the process. 
---
Same as sneaking in and stealing a nuke launch after someone has ground there way through the silo. Some people get their rocks off by trolling others, way of the world 🤷‍♂️
---
Vendors. One of the ways to make caps in this game is to set up a vendor at your camp. That will be the "big" thing you miss by not having one.
---
Lesser reasons to have a camp are: resource extractors, collectrons, camp allies that give quests, refrigerators, decontamination arches, the ammo machine from Wastelanders, that sort of thing.
---
I wanted to loot the bodies
---
Or you're just an old player and are mad you missed something, sorry your ego needs to be spoonfed
---
Oh cool! Thanks!
---
What about your average 34 year old jacked up on mountain dew?
---
You don't happen to watch that food ration guy do you?
---
Lets get this on a tray..
---
I’m referring to regular play but yeah I’ve noticed in Daily Ops it doesn’t work but I assumed that was by design or due to the higher perception modifier. Maybe I’m just crazy and it’s working haha.
---
That's actually a very clever idea, selective healing seems like a feature a booth capable of healing you would have.
---
People shall learn to play the game to progress in it. If all your friends wanted was kicking some bugs around... well, tough luck. Since they are your friends, you can spare some gear for them. That wont be a problem to get some weak legendaries, especially with your bloodied unyielding fixer build.
---
I saw this too, the post was made before One Wasteland.
---
On tue I was 421 and I’m now 433 so that’s pretty good goin but I spend a lot of time in ops now good exp plus legends even if there rubbish u still scrip them
---
Like I say I use VE heavy only no worry about bloodied now or finally haha. I only use overdrive from time to time.
---
Bigger Hordes,better rewards. Definitely
---
I think my current in game struggles may be being caused by Issues with the sneak mechanic.Being a Sniper it is a fundamental part of my build.
---
I can be sat on a Roof in full stealth mode kneeling in Chameleon sniping Ghouls,and Covert Operative is hit,and miss.and that right now is the difference between a successful Kill.
---
Geeze kid, you can't even paraphrase correctly. When did you drop out? 3rd grade? 
---
Seriously though, you didn't give me much to go on. Why drag it out? You already admitted defeat.
---
So go to the filthy casual sub where theres no complaining.
---
I only saw one in a year. During last Fasnach!
---
Wonder if this has anything to do with the improperly spawned enemies that are invulnerable.
---
Agreed. But they took off before I could even do that
---
Ahh yeah!! I always forget you can rename weapons
---
Happening to me too, Xbox. Really annoying when you go to check the map and it's happening.
---
Been critting heads on my junkies not-sneak guy and it's about 3 shots, wonder why it's such a huge difference. I only shoot torso/thursters on robots. Bloodied stealth guy is about 4 shots, usually I don't bother with headshots on him. I'd be interested to see your build
---
You like it?
---
Oh sorry, I got that comment backwards. No I'm a commando build and now gauss shotgun also, but not sneak so I'm up close and personal with the enemies.
---
I understand these enemies are scaling to my level, just wondered if I had overlooked some little trick or perk to mitigate some of the damage.
---
Yes.  Idk how much, but it's not much and not worth it
---
Most of us non bloodied folks need some percentage of damage back. Its a strugglebus now. Even tea time can easily fail...
---
That last section is 50% irrelevant considering how it's only here for 3 days. The rad resistance against ghouls is useless, take too many hits and it'll go as fast as in a nuke zone. And stabilized only works with heavy weapons so unless you focus solely on that, it doesn't provide a actual bonus. And mind noting that it has a chance to heal you. It's not like it will recharge/refill with every hit.
---
I literally just started playing this game less than a month ago (or maybe a little over a month) and I have already started submitting complaints.
---
It's not even because I hate the game. *I AM REALLY HAVING A BLAST PLAYING!*
---
That being said, there are some things that Bethesda does need to get off their asses and fix. I understand that it takes time, being one who works in IT and software development, but when you claim to fix something and it's not, you shouldn't expect your player base (who has been VERY vocal about this game from the jump, as I've known) to keep quite.
---
Just my two caps.
---
In this game if you want to maximize damage, you must minimize practically everything else. Some will suggest losing all the carry item weight reduction perks, and that will surely free up slots for max damage. This is a game of min/max not real life situations. Running a suicide tactical character is supreme if you want to kill everything with minimal thrill yet riding a slaughter attitude and a higher respawn rate. Since there is no need to have caution in character build and that there is no penalty for dying, a Bloodied build would best suit you. Ultimately, the experience is rewarded the same however build you make, yet the prizes will differ if it takes you longer to kill than your opponent. FO76 has become a fast-paced shooter rather than a RPG like previous editions, and now with the latest update, the focus seems to me more slaughter rather than adventure.  Good luck and enjoy.
---
Finally someone who agrees. I always get people telling me "but then they'll give up on the game"
---
1. It's a hell of a lot easier to work on a game than it is to make a new one .
---
2. The studio that works on fo76 was bought for that reason.
---
Maybe they will finally fix "Leader of the Pack".
---
Open your perk menu, and click on the large blue bar above your cards that says "Legendary Perks". You unlock 1 slot for them at level 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, and 300. You rank them up using Perk Coins you gain from scrapping unused regular perks. You have to pay Perk Coins to unequip them as well, but it's really cheap.
---
Must be the old part,just saw that..tyvm
---
the gift that keeps on giving
---
Could be a build or gear issue. 
---
Heres my take and its only anecdotal. Shortly before wastelanders I respec for a better stealth and up to 15 agi and with some gear and silincers and understanding how sneak works I became a ghost to enemies... then wastelanders hit and something felt off and every update it got worse, i changed nothing and was getting caught out a lot.
---
This patch hit and I'm back into bumping into enemies or walking past them because we don't notice each other its funny but stealth seems better then ever to me now
---
Welcome to the new legendary perk system
---
“Oh No! Not VolatileRipper again! Quick bro leave this team and join up another server. Can’t stand that guy”
---
You will need the essentials such as water and food but there is nothing to prevent you from having a minimalist CAMP.
---
I would at least put down an army tent, a bed, and a campfire then call it a mobile basecamp.  But I like themed CAMPS, even simple ones.
---
Any build challenges can be done at a workshop.
---
Yes I noticed that yesterday in Valley Galeria. But then when you go back there without the Daily Ops running, it still doesn't work.
---
I dont want help to find me a build, correct. I want bethesda to fix their game like 2,5 years ago, and even more, I want the gaming community to NOT accept this and you know why? I will tell you why:
---
It's not about fallout 76. We (we as in actual gamers) dont give a FUCK about fallout 76. But we care about The elder scrolls 6! If fallout 76 goes clear in this state, tes6 will as well. Literally, you as a fallout 76 community are able to destroy one of the biggest hyped games in history of gaming if you continue allowing shit like this.
---
So please, don't fight against exploits because of me. Do it for the elder scrolls 6 and the whole gaming community. I don't care the game itself, I dont care what you think of me as a person. I just want to fucking enjoy a proper upcoming game.
---
resilient super mutant suiciders are going to be fun
---
I’ll trade you either a vault 94 stash box or war glaive for the caged bulbs.  I won’t use either lol
---
That's what I figured. I'm guessing no more than a grenade explosive damage.
---
(uses Disease Cure)
---
You've recovered from Herpes!
---
Instigating is probably your best bet. If possible get an Instigating/Explosive or IFFR (this will not be easy).  
---
IF you're willing to run adrenal reaction and run even half health you will see a big spike in your dmg #s.
---
Omg yes please we need some pretty ones. Some longer ones.
---
If ur on ps4 i have a qffr lever for trade
---
I’ve tried to give out some of my gear to them in the past but they don’t want handouts. And I can’t tell them not to take only QOL perks because it’s not my place to tell them how they should play
---
Its worth it if you level it up some, which is the whole point.
---
There is a difference between challenge and grind till you die.
---
it can be done alone. but if your main goal is to farm ammo you can take an hour if you need to. Every enemy i killed was giving me 8+ 2mm back. and it was only taking 1-3 shots to kill them. plus you get like 200+ at the end
---
OP needs to learn that value is subjective
---
I noticed this too, stuff dies 1 to 1.5 seconds after I shoot enemies now. I thought it was a result of Follow Through but I guess not.
---
I dont think you can drop those plans or trade them.
---
How? HOW??? I rolled 25 times for lvl 3 armor and all of them were right arms!!! ALL OF THEM!
---
Can’t like this post enough man. Good write up
---
Yeah sure, those magic weapon that will be raining in players shop in some days due to the Daily Ops drop, with no rare scrap usage at any point.  
---
Fallout 1st is just really interesting for the free travel point and the comfort of the scrap stash.
---
If you want to troll about Fallout 1st being p2w, you should just reclaim a true OS weapon from Bethesda.
---
After reading this im trying to remember the last time i blue screened on ps4. Probably about 3 weeks ago i did 1 time, before that it was a while with no issues too. 
---
Looking back (knocking on wood) i guess ive been lucky
---
I totally agree that you shouldn't play a game you dislike. I don't play this game anymore for that reason, however:
---
My only posts since I stopped were about what I'd personally like to see moving forward from this game.
---
Yes, this game in my opinion was a catastrophe, but I believe some of the backlash was over-the-top and this game certainly has a lot of merits that they can expand upon in future releases
---
Furthermore,  there were far more interactables and dynamic quests in the F76 game world than Eso. I know this for a fact because I'm played both for about half a year. 76 animations are far less scripted, than ESO animations, especially in terms of dead bodies, explosions, what have you.
---
So, if you ever see my post, know that I'm definitely not bitching. I'm just offering free creative ideas. Trust me, I don't want Bethesda to die on F4 and F76. I've played oblivion for at least 3 full years, the only quest I never did was the Fighter's Guild one, but I've modded the hell out of it. skyrim was pretty good too! I disliked the over-simplified body armor (Helm, Arm, Body + Greaves) and the fairly bland game world. But nothing that mods couldn't fix!
---
F76 is still the first of it's kind, and it was certainly the most ambitious rpg I've come across. But criticism is well deserved where its due, and criticism, when made constructively, is not bad.
---
Im just gonnna do it till I get that train set then Ill probably slow down on it.
---
well it's a daily quest that is repeatable. i personally dont refer to them as repeatable. Just daily.
---
there is at least one quest in the game you need to build something, and you can get some resources from the camp, but no need to go crazy.
---
But with if the are really just playing the troll game? 1000 internet tears can unlock a new outfit skin!
---
They have just lowered damage for rebalancing so there could be an increase
---
Earle should have 50% of his Heads removed to compensate the player Base.
---
He feels like a Bullet Sponge right now.
---
I used a Bloodied Mini-gun,which i had done previously to decimate him after the Nerf,A Big Gun Bobble head,chems,and food Buffs.
---
Me and another high level player got him down to about 50% Health.
---
An experience i wont be doing any time soon.
---
Definitely,definitely, need a few players now.Just 2,3,players unlikely to cut. (\*Poster appearing in 3,2,1, to claim they dropped Earl solo in 6 seconds after the Nerf :-) )
---
Queen still as easy as ever though. Embarrassingly easy.
---
You're right, normally I'd assume a user error...but I've heard of a number of people (including some in the circle I run with) that have lost things from their stash and their displays.  This is the first I've heard of from a player inventory, but at this point there's too many to ignore.
---
I pulled all my vendors and displays until this gets fixed.
---
I don't think it'd be so bad if it didn't take so long to respec. Like, if I HAVE to pivot to heavy guns and power armour, ok, but if I've got 3 STR and 14 AGI due to what used to be my awesome Skyrim stealth archer build or whatever, I'm fucked for about twenty levels while I slowly move perk points across and set the cards up. Maybe a free perk point shuffle every twenty levels? Or make it cost caps, or atoms, or whatever, just not the current system, where it's gonna be harder to level up to move perk points in the first place because I'm suddenly underpowered and struggle to reliably kill anything to gain XP.
---
Edit: also, you're right, there are two problems here. In single player games, you only need your pistol build to be able to take out NPC enemies viably. Cool. In 76, you need that AND ALSO not have your pistol build make the guy next to you with a gatling laser look like a cunt by doing the same damage as him. I actually don't know how you get round that and keep everyone happy.
---
It definitely makes a difference.
---
YES♥️
---
Since update 22 there seem to a rash of lvl 300+ who take great joy in taking workshops from lvl 8.  Started a new character and have been farming plans and resources in the Forest while I lvl up, so I just take the workshop for the plans and leave the server, can’t afford to loose the caps getting killed and don’t hold any junk.  Much less stressful way of starting out after the patch as this seems to be a thing now...
---
Good to know, thanks
---
I lost it at the confessions area! Great build lol
---
*No.*
---
Complaining about it is half the fun.
---
Hornets nest? Haha
---
Is there a subreddit for people who actually like the game, where we wont get downvoted for liking something?
---
I probably should have phrased that better.
---
Legendary Perk SLOTS open at those levels.  All the cards are available at 50 though.  If you have 4 slots though that's interesting because it should only be 3 at 117.  I'm 141 and only have 3 slots.
---
Respec man, full health legacy build for the win.
---
Survival shortcut, what rads, boost your 4 lowest special.
---
You become the terminator...
---
The higher the level, the higher level enemies u have (50-100)
---
I can’t confirm for sure but last night I got a 3* Medic’s Handmade and when I went to try it out non of my crits were healing me at all.
---
I haven't noticed, but I have AGI over 30 from Unyielding x5, sneak 3, and escape artist. I can stay hidden while hanging from Earle's family jewels.
---
Oh I had Fallout 1st for a month, that scrap box is an op unfair advantage.
---
All the trading groups asking for either god rolls or thousands upon thousands of scrap that no normal player could possibly have without a Fallout 1st box!
---
Yeah I have a junkies ffr primed gauss minigun and earl ate 1200 rounds in about 5 minutes last night. Was not really worth crafting all that ammo.
---
Can one person beat this segment?  I went in with a TSE gatling gun and a TSE .50 cal machine gun.  I went through over 2,000 round of ammo and finally gave up when both gun broke.  I must have killed at least 50 mutants, but probably more.   There was just a never ending stream, mostly three and four at a time.  Anyone else have this issue?
---
I see
---
I just started on PC and my character is only Level 9 and I haven't had much difficulty. When I was looking at posts before playing after the update I thought I was going to have just the worse time. From not having any healing to no ammo but I haven't had much trouble at all. The only time I've struggled recently is when I tried to do daily ops at Level 6.
---
I'm on PC but thanks
---
&gt;if you ever see my post, know that I'm definitely not bitching. I'm just offering free creative ideas. Trust me, I don't want Bethesda to die on F4 and F7
---
The issue he has is that Bethesda has not kept on its word, nor are they acquiescence to what a lot of consumers want. That being said, I did enjoy playing this game, until the bugs drove me out. I would love to see a better fallout game that shows they've learned from the mistakes of F4 and F76.
---
Two handed weapon and legendary perks still caps at 15. You can put 10 on strenght and use a maxed legendary strenght perk (+5).
---
Sorry if I offended you but legendary perks wouldn't be so legendary if you didn't have to earn them. The current system is very generous to alt characters. The grind can be a pain at times but at leasts there's a sense of progression beyond getting your initial build. A low level with maxed legendary perks would just be wrong.
---
I doubt we will ever get that long but I’d be happy even with past shoulders a little. I understand clipping etc but surelyyyy we can get some prettier ones or even a proper ponytail instead of that weird thing one that looks terrible imo and I hate the pigtails.
---
You're totally right on that!  DOOM Eternal's graphics engine is made of pure butter.  That shit will run at 60fps on a toaster!
---
From what I've seen. That happens when someone gooifies or vaporizes an enemy, then they respawn for a new player. They respawn without AI and are in God mode.
---
I don't think you've ever done crack
---
Exactly. When it gets in the way and has to occur like 15 times and growing it gets annoying.
---
The camp is there so you have a place to store you junk, repair weapons etc. You don’t need to make anything fancy. I recommend a mobile base you can plop down anywhere.
---
tbh my one alt that can actually move is using a junkies explosive lever action and it still packs a meaty punch
---
just flick em a heart emoji and soldier on.
---
Tbh I thought they would be the same. 
---
So thats good to know. 
---
I’m currently setting up the new build on Nukesdragons. 
---
Thanks again for the help mate
---
They don't even have equipment. It's like an improper spawn. Best ones to see that with are Super Mutants. They spawn butt-ass naked.
---
I have notice my combat shotgun is working correctly out of vats.in vats it is a beast.but i also have 3 shotgunner 3 expert shotgunner 3 master shotgunner 3 skeet shooter and 3 enforcer.so i think it was always super powerful.just depends on how you have your perks set.not much has changed as far as me demolishing enemies with it.it used to be 1 to 2 shots now its 2 to 4 shots.no problems here.i also have bloody mess 3 on too.
---
The owe you the advertised product or an apology, or something meant to show good faith. 
---
Regardless, I would love for Bethesda to make a new fallout that shows they've learned from their mistakes in F4 and F76. 
---
I believe this online type of game has a lot of potential, but they just need not rush the release. There are many pre-release articles noting that the game's release date was unusually short from the time of the announcement. I guess we know why now.
---
Literally your second paragraph.  That seems like a square circle to me.
---
Maybe they want someone else but don’t want to be a dickhead since if you’re in an op and get kicked from your group you get removed from the op, even if you were editing it solo
---
Since you decide to dm me finish what you started and read my messages you fucking coward
---
Probably

r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Unfortunately r/fo76 is a cesspool of haters.
---
Some of them are great.  Over all I like the legendary perks.
---
Unfortunately I don't like a lot of the sacrifices most builds need to make to get high damage. I don't like being addicted to  chems, or sitting on 1% HP all the time, or always being mutated to shit. I just want to play at full HP with a clean bill of health.
---
Jesus was a lich.
---
I hear electric absorption is good, what makes funky duds and sizzling style essential?  (I usually play solo so take one for the team is less attractive to me).
---
Mine has been working correctly now.outside of vats it is taking alot of damage off and staying off.its not perfect but alot better.
---
If you had a skin on it before the update that weapon was just a “combat rifle”. Before update 22 the fixer didn't had any option for skins.
---
Ok so it's not just me. Thanks for commenting
---
Ok well I doubt you have
---
Piercing gaze blows.  Every enemy having it is the problem.  There should be designated sentries that should be able to reveal you within a set perimeter. But for stealth to be completely irrelevant -- This sucks.  It completely invalidates a much-loved play style.
---
I've taken so many pictures posing with those. Charlie's angels super mutant, Vault dweller orally pleasuring a super mutant, vault dweller mounting a mutant hound from behind, the list goes on.
---
How do you do a daily op with a public team? I still can't figure that out.
---
I love you all.  Great thread and comments.
---
Having perks that do just that for caps and what have you wouldn't be a bad idea.
---
Yeah but you couldn't just go and buy it all out. You would still have to earn them.  Still take a decent time. Just some would be quicker then others.
---
Is that so? Then that means I’m missing a fixer cuz I’m sure I had a vanilla one in my stash. Hmmmm...
---
lol I got them too yesterday. There was my first reward 😁
---
I need the mask too 🤣
---
This is cool, need a couple spots "fixed" instead of having to handle as much manual entry. I.e. when putting each day rank, auto calculate score earned, then front page rely on last non blank day, things like that. Im going to update it on mine when i get to a PC, as cell phone editing is not fun.
---
Which platform are you on?
---
Ye but it will take them 2 years at least
---
I just thought it was odd that the game kicked me out of my own op when I left my own team.
---
I must try it 😁
---
I miss BIV, and the scout masters, and that terminal that was supposed to connect us.
---
sigh
---
Its all I've got so far, I really want the BOS suit and the super generator.
---
This feature can be tested super easy at strangler heart event. Try shooting continously and then double tap every few seconds. See which one does more damage registered
---
Have we really? That's kind of concerning... I hope more types will be added soon...
---
you want AA or TSE then tbh. Maybe furious.
---
Thanks this place is so toxic and negative it feels like Facebook.
---
Dropped out of school and right into your mother you caught me.
---
Underwhelming considering all of the changes
---
yeah the super generator would be very nice
---
Plenty of reasons.
---
For example it would make things less laggy by auto cleaning up dead bodies off the ground so the game would take less resources on console.
---
Also play on team aspects of working together. If players don't want stimpacks in inventory then you can make it so body only dissapears for each player then have each player do their own.
---
If your in an op and you leave the team it kicks you automatically. It's the game not the other team. Same if say all 4 of you are in the instance as soon as some one leaves the team they are kicked from the instance for some reason.
---
We need a set of emoticons just for Daily Ops. Like "Rally at the uplink" or a ready check for the group. It gets old joining a group, loading in, just to be kicked out into another loading screen. That'll be abused eventually.
---
If you built an elevated camp in the forest, you had a  relatively safe (from NPC attack) haven - use workbenches, obtain sleep bonuses, etc.  If you had to swap out damage or defense perks for crafting perks, not a big deal - the NPCs were really low level.
---
And you have a place for your vending machines where expletive could shop in relative peace. (When you gt attacked while at a vending machine or bot, Or while crafting in the open, you’ll better understand that)
---
Also a free travel point to help you get across the map.
---
OL kinda changes that, as even in the forest, you are subject to attack from high(er) level enemies,
---
A couple of L1-3 ghould don’t do much harm.  A pack of 5-10 L50 liberators or supermutants, however, are another story.  need to think about more defense, and location becomes a bit more important, too.
---
I mean, what else do you use your free space for?
---
Have you done the raids before and gathered the code keys from back then?
---
When I hit it it just beeped. No door movement.
---
Very low
---
Haha yeah I would never give an opinion on anything I didn’t try
---
It will let you break detection and return to stealth.
---
This is pretty dumb.
---
Laughs in Johnathan Lawrence from karate kid voice
---
I missed Mischief Night last year, I was excited to do it this year and get the Halloween camp plans and outfits. Sort it out Bethesda, don't cancel it.
---
No I got the game like three weeks ago and when the new patch got out I tried it and it opened up
---
Well fuck
---
I got a response from one of the community managers on here ages ago about the terminal, they said that there were plans to implement all the dailys into the terminal as well as add more functionality, but this was like 6 months ago Maybe. I guess they didn't think it was worth it, but then why bother in the first place?
---
Probably seething on the level of meat week with 1* rewards
---
yea was hoping the bug where she crawls into the room with the power armor would be fixed by now, but nope, she still just stands there looking at the computer and does nothing so need to go out and in again, was kinda hoping on this new char that i could finally get that PA head but i guess not, ah well its not like im gonna be a PA user anyway but it still sucks...
---
The only thing I can think of is to make it easier to respec SPECIAL points. So you could switch between whole builds for different events and bosses. I think I should be able to play high AGI high sneak day to day, but switch to high STR with heavy guns perks for SBQ fights, without needing multiple level ups to shuffle points around in between.
---
it's got a pretty good radius. like you ain't gotta be on top of them.
---
Doing Earle multiple times a day just fills you up with stims, you cant do anything against it... beside not picking them up.
---
Bethesda: We need more money and they complaining all the time.
---
*Do more shots, less damage, more HP, more craft, more everything.*
---
Bethesda: Oh no our servers can't handle so much actions!
---
Anyway being a beta tester isn't fun so better forget about that doomed game for a year or five. We could have a private configurable servers (like Fallout 4 lol) but have to test that thing.
---
I just wish i could get emails from Ward with the subject:” Finally, someone with the guts to help”
---
Why? I think that will be as we pass from xbox one to Xbox one x I trasferd all I found the same saving
---
It does that's why I want it I've got elder 3 times on 3 toons and only got 2 vally signs.... boo
---
3.28% for elder rank
---
im a two handed mele build. i use the t65 armor. no legacy items, no crazy bloodied build or anything. just your basic perks.
---
my full health 2h junky melee can ohk lvl 100 super mutants with a power attack.  So no, melee isn't remotely worthless.
---
Whatever the numbers were before or after the nerf don't amount to a pile of dogshit, all that matters is ttk and mine is relatively unchanged.  
---
I think ppl just see the number go down and think "bad nerf is bad me no like bad nerf!!" But if you go out and actually play the character and find you are still killing shit efficiently then what difference does it make if you did 50million damage before and now it's "only" a few hundred?
---
Oh yea, i always carry way too many chems with me, i got the mod as soon as i had access to it.
---
Enemies now scale down so it’s easier for lower level players, the problem is once you’re level 50+ enemy damage resistance scales way above what it should. Once you’re level 50 I’d recommend going either unarmed or two handed melee temporary until you can get enough perk cards to spec you’re preferred build. Melee is naturally strong in this game though many of people hate playing melee
---
Haven't been having ammo issue but I do notice if I pop a few bullets into something and turn to shoot something else I'll see in my peripheral that they just explode or fall dead.
---
Now as cool as this sounds, it's probably a pain in the ass for people who don't carry enough weapons to be considered a walking war crime.
---
seriously the room with the power armor is still bugged now 5 months later... isnt it about time you fix this bug now?RaRa crawls in, then jumps down and just stares at the computer and does nothing. still...  
---
did notice that she bumped into some stuff, so it might be what causes the bug, dunno.
---
ah ok yeah that makes sense lol
---
I payed for the game, i buying f..Ing fol1 for my sake and support devs i gues, and i think i have/deserve all the right for bitching!
---
Some bitching is stupid, but without it there will be no more fol76 (because everyone either feed up and left, or stuck with it and suffer), Its same shit with warframe.
---
Its not bitching, its called passion/caring, you love this thing so much, and whant better thing for it. If you dont care for it then after much frustrayion and problems you Just leave for other thin, but if you love it, you Will stick and start complaining.
---
What's your two handed weapon if I may ask
---
Agree im level 410 and im not close to maxing out all 6 perks.  Love game and played loads and I know its a new grind on top of the other grinds but what level are they expecting me have to be when I max all 6, 
---
Or they could set the XP needed to level up the same after say level 300 it's taking a while to level up now too.
---
game-pass problem, visit the official forum. There is a help-stub available.
---
Different environment over there. Moderators do a great job filtering out the douchebags.
---
Only odd thing I had happen was finishing 4/5 Daily Gold Star challenges, I was so far from level on my characters, so I did the NW challenge. The Gold Star Daily completed but it did not register on the Weekly Challenge to "Complete a Gold Star Daily Challenge" /shrug. Not a huge issue but there is some strange disconnect with NW and the challenges
---
Yes. It sounds identical to an older bug.
---
Use concrete foundations. All around better
---
Yeah, i'm with you on that one. But honestly i try to avoid using these foundations under "important" buildings because Mole-rats often manage to spawn under them to finally break into the buildings.
---
Anoying ! 😡
---
Haha that would be great.
---
Glad I'm not alone. PS4 here. Same problem.
---
Definitely maybe.
---
thorn is not very good. it's essentially just a better sneak piece, if you have the full set. solar is very good for full health builds, though.
---
keep in mind SS doesn't have a shadowed option, though.
---
I think there’s more enemies but the uplinks are quicker the more players you have around it 
---
I guess it just depends on how you work, I can solo as a heavy PA build but if you’re bloodied or  not using a high DPS weapon I recommend teaming up
---
How the fuck a low level player like me was god at everything in F76? The difficulty was spot on, I had hard times on new locastions, but I could farm mats in low level places. I don't have thousand of caps to buy ammunition and new armor. I don't need second work so I stopped playing this piece of shit.
---
Fallout 1st works for me. If I’m not grouping up to do stuff then I’m a curmudgeonly anti-social git. 
---
The grind is usually okay. (That first season was a doozy though. I got fed up doing dailies after a fortnight.) As for the Atom Shop, well it’s paying for the DLC; I don’t mind spending ten quid or so a month. 
---
The only gripe I have (and it’s nowt to do with Bethesda) is that due to being an original gamer most of my friends consider themselves out of the gaming loop now; I’m stuck with PuGing instead of a regular crowd to game with.
---
2021
---
Relatively low, considering the other rarest ones. But keep doing it on elder and you'll get something. Got the special ops suit and liquid courage and wasn't even aware of its rarity until seeing the list. Next up, disease cure machine and solar panels!
---
With the changes one wasteland brought i would opt for SS.
---
I actually ditched my junkies sneak commando build for a plain sneak commando and don't regret it in the least. I've been running an instigating explosive and vampires explosive combat rifles.
---
So... A karma post. On the fallout76 sub. Nice bait
---
Thanks legend. I’m on Xbox but it’s people like you that make the community great.
---
I haven’t chosen any legendary perks yet until I figure out exactly what will work for my build (or new build). I have scrapped what I can (about 368) perk coins.  Not even sure how many maxed out legendary perks this will get me.  But yah, waiting...
---
If I play for an hour I'll get 4 of the challenges complete without even trying.  Then I chew some bubblegum or craft some ammo and I get my gold star
---
15 STR and all of it is in weight reduction perks,
---
who needs damage when you can carry the world on your shoulders.
---
You are forgetting one thing: perks packs obtained from the season passes
---
Final word is better than explosive ghoul. Since it shoots faster and has AA. AA didn't get nerfed at all, it's still just as powerful. Explosive is just better for shooting at an enemies feet and fixing the problem of low accuracy at longer ranges.
---
Perhaps possibly
---
You’re awesome. I’ll try to jump on later today. Thanks!
---
I could never find a reliable source of Firecaps other then the Agri building.
---
Just like th croc backpack plan when that was super new I remember seeing threads saying they wanted 5 or more legacies plus a hundred thousand caps for the plan... I was like the hell you do the plan is everywhere now isn't to hard to find one usually sells for 12k now. All the daily ops stuff will be super cheap in a month or so when the community is flooded with it.
---
I agree. The way Bethesda handles the game is iffy. But as a software developer I can recognize it as a project that is starved on resourced (time and/or people). Of all games I play/played in the last years, 76 is the game where I would list the most issues. And yet I consider the game fun and fine. There are many positives about the game.
---
Sure, some people may not see the same positives, but they probably see other positives. If they see only negatives, then they are here just to troll. "Unplayable", "nothing to do", "only grind", "they don't play their own game". So much bullshit gets thrown around. Morore often then not I'm under the impression that some of these people are here just to spread dissent and never played the game.
---
In the end it's fine to dislike a game and give up. Sometimes the tastes are too different, too incompatible. It doesn't outright mean the game is bad, Bethesda is scheming and Todd is raking money in his personal turbomansion.
---
May I ask why? Did not junkies give you more damage overall?
---
Yeah, maybe.  I prefer heavy guns day to day, but to each there own.  Or maybe just make heavy guns prohibitively hard to use on all but bosses.
---
You get 50 perk coins when you reach level 50. 13.9 levels saved. 
---
Additionally, at least one of the legendary perk cards doesn’t really need to be leveled up to get the best benefits. Master Infiltrator let’s you free up six perk card slots (or have the benefits of six perk cards if you didn’t slot them in), and therefore allowed me to scrap those six perk cards for 12 coins. I’ll never need to equip them again and any I get randomly will be scrapped. And that’s also 300 perk coins I don’t have to spend   83.3 levels saved. 
---
Finally, last season (as well as this season), there are perk card packs as SCORE rewards. Each of those is 8 more ‘perk coins’ and another 2.2 levels less you need to advance. Not sure how many off the top of my head, and players may choose to spread them out between characters, but that’s still a ‘level savings’.   *Edit:  There are 13 available this season and 13 last season. That’s 208 perk coins. 56.7 levels saved.*
---
Overall, good math, but just a few details to consider.
---
*Edit: Total levels saved by all of the above: 153.9*
---
Also corrected a typo.
---
Flatwoods monster is one of the most rare. I've only ever killed 2-3, and maybe seen it two other times in the 700+ hours I've got into it so far.
---
Actually I remember seeing it at the end of an ACP event the other week. A few of us were running west off the cliff side to escape the nuke zone and down on the side of one of the cliff ledges I hear all this shooting. I run back over to see what on earth these guys are shooting at, and it's the flatwoods monster just hanging out on a little cliff shelf.
---
People that think like you are another reason 76 will always be a laughing stock and the only discussions for the game will happen on this shitty sub. 
---
Everyone did get out. There’s not many left. Tell them to go too, I guess. Logic.
---
Easy. You dont need to be in a Daily Ops team. Any team will do. If your teammates are doing one, then next to their name you will see (in a Daily Op) or somerhing like that.
---
Just go to the map, select daily Ops and join normally. The button should say Join Team rather than Join.
---
Full health....Bolstering solar armour all day, much better than Vangurd and out performs SS comfortably when it comes to time alive while being spanked.
---
What does liquid courage do?
---
Yeah AA, TS, Furious, or Instigating are my ideal picks
---
Since before the update tho I've gotten hit markers and damage numbers, yet no damage was actually dealt so there is that.
---
I definitely don't want radaway or stims, I'm just going to sell them. I get that they help low levels but that's why they are rewards for events. Also daily ops awards a lot of radaway that I just sell everyday as well. I would also like the option to scrap a reward for atoms, even if it was 20 atoms
---
I don't know, ask the developers of the game and the consoles. It's their setup.
---
This. For daily ops and just the insane enemies now go for SS buttressed.
---
This happens to me every rank
---
&gt; I expected more of 76 but I still love it
---
YOU expected more. But you got nothing less than was promised. To be frank they didn't promise a heap of gamebreaking features. They promised some basic MMO-lite stuff in a Fallout world and delivered exactly that. The only broken promise I can remember was breaking of Pete's "cosmetic only" long time after the release.
---
It’d be cool to see your set up. I may need to take you up on your offer if I can work out my build. You’re a legend.
---
If you use a full health build, you'd probably actually like solar. I absolutely love the qol the healing it provides. You can turn yourself into a tank stealth machine with the right legendaries and perk combinations. Plus, you buy the mods from modus instead of spending bullion.
---
Ammo factory is underwhelming?  200 poison resistance?  I think they're good additions
---
I also have ammosmith and super duper permanently equipped, I keep forgetting to equip them when crafting so they're always on. I really should switch then out to get that little bit of extra damage but whatever.
---
bye
---
PSA: People still don’t understand what a PSA is.
---
I maxed out my first legendary perk today, I’m at level 183 and I have finally finished legendary strength
---
And the free 50 perk coins at level 50.
---
There will be more locations, and a new mission type coming in the future, likely with new enemies and mutations.
---
But fret not - there is still plenty of rewards to grab from these.
---
The bugs weren’t promised. Losing my weapons randomly wasn’t promised. That was my point when I said I expected more.
---
You really have it backwards. You make it seem like Microsoft is doing all these specail things  and acting like its not on ps5 when its more the other way around.  lol  first off ps5 ssd is far better for speed and intagration.  its so well integrated (hardware wise) into the architecture thats what puts its above the rest of ssd on the market even for pcs for elimination overhead challenges for games on ssd. Microsoft ssd is more so standard nothing actually special like ps5 ssd and  its hardware. sorry to say but watch mark cernies presentation on ps5 and linus tech tips videos on it. Although microsoft is better at software then  Sony is superior in hardware where all this actually  matters more so.  fallout 76 is not getting any secret sauce on on next gen xbox  over the ps5. They would have to build it up from the ground up again for ssds specifically which I doubt there doing. But ssd already makes the game 10 times better on current gen so of coarse its gonna be great on  both next gen. But still perform better on ps5 so far.
---
Yeah that’s right fuck all those people who have jobs there
---
Miserable cunt
---
&gt;We got an incomplete one.
---
It's YOU who considers the game incomplete. From objective development standpoint the game was complete.
---
instigating lever to open an engagement and then swap to my JE handmade. pew pew boom

I keep getting the vault 94 jumpsuit :/
---
The bug with wall weapon displays has not been fixed
---
Daggum hippies.
---
Tesla approves of that cover ;)
---
nothing in the files I don't think.
---
Good idea, but I am using radicool (more rads=more strength) and Bloodied (with rads used to cap my healthbar). If  wanted to run a full HP build than What Rads would probably be pretty great.
---
You will want the caps this season. Treasure Hunter event returns next month with new rewards. If it ends up like last round and scorched Christmas event the purchased pails will give better odds at the exclusive rewards. I plan on dropping 60k caps at minimum. 
---
Last season I had to buy gold bullion on retired alt just to make space for the caps. Lol.
---
The community's too small and quiet for that tho, the only real option's r/fo76FilthyCasuals but beth doesn't really listen to people there, so there's sadly no way to see NW get anything
---
Good solution to a 3 sec delay, lets not talk about how shit this game is, lets just go do something else for 3 sec and pretend everything is fine. Fallout 76 community is the best example of that meme with that guy sitting on a chair with fire behind him saying "this is fine".
---
This crowd doesn't even realize that many of us played for the building. I already wrapped up shop at the end of season 1 after the idiotic build nerf (door &gt; wall &gt; door swap) since it really screws with some of my more creative building tricks.
---
I would probably do fine with my so-so stealth sniper build and very good AA Fixer, but my wife is far more casual than I and only in it for the building.
---
So while we don't really count in the eyes of the people loving patch 22, it's just another nail in the coffin.
---
How would bolstering be better than vandgaurd for a full health build? Honest question.
---
well, i did just one run with a utlracite gatling laser and a run with a prime ultracite gatling laser
---
the result does not mean that we never get fusion cores with this weapon - somenone should investigate this a litte bit deeper
---
u/Ladydevann

Ward said something really strange to me last night while I was trying to return some vital equipment....every once in a while he’ll say something real weird
---
Bitches gonna bitch
---
https://imgur.com/a/glnmrz6
---
I have been playing the game since it came out but i don't think this is that complex of a setup at all.
---
You maxed it?
---
Yeah, I think I'll be avoiding this perk for that reason
---
Was 100 on my main, 20 on my alt when the patch hit. Both are doing fine, didn't experience much difference at all in either. People who are struggling 9 times out of 10 could easily fix their problems by swapping a few perk cards. You can't be surprised you're having a hard time when your build isn't giving anything at all to your damage output.
---
More logins means higher probability of buying. Its straight mobile game logic.
---
You are going to want to build a camp, but it doesn't have to be something you put a lot of time into.  I just have a simple, small shack that is designed to fit in any reasonably flat location without modification.  I don't tinker with my shack or add a lot of decor, I just plop down beneficial things as I unlock their plans.  Workbenches, ammo converter, bed, water and crops, and a piano for when I want to take a bathroom break - when I come back I've got a sweet AP regen boost.  Defense is pretty simple, put turrets all around the top of that bitch and forget about it.
---
lol yea!  mmmmm buttery toast.....
---
Yep, every time you continue to shoot it just resets their health basically, noticed this using my bloodied combat shotgun. Still a 1 hit kill for most mobs
---
This may be anecdotal but I craft a lot of alcohol and that eats through wood like nobodies business so woodchucker is actually useful. 
---
It's 1 wood per boiled water, and 5 per alcohol (specifically whiskey, but I think it's the same for others) In total that's 8 wood per whiskey and I usually make 50+ whiskey at a time. It's useful to keep my character permanently drunk w/ +6 STR.
---
For damage it doesn't matter if you are solo or on a team, for the most part. Its the other bonuses that I was referring too. And the lack of bonuses for solo play. Hell, I don't even think you can solo Elder Rank in Daily Ops. The closest I can get is 9m or so. 
---
As for damage, you're going to struggle with many builds due to the scaling health and resistances of the enemies. The only work arounds I know of, are to bump up the damage you do with a different build. That way you do more damage even after the resistance reduction (due to how their resistances work). Or to stack anti-armor perks and effects.
---
Even some Bloodied builds are ineffective now.
---
Two
---
It did before the nerf. It still does now just not enough to balance out the negatives. Before the nerf my junkies explosive combat rifle was giving me 205 damage after the nerf 134. That's running 1/3 health for the adrenaline mutations to kick in. I'm getting 100 damage from my regular explosive combat rifles now running full health. Not even counting modifiers. Plus I have a ton of commando weapons that I haven't used in awhile lol.
---
Huh. I would have never considered that. Thanks for telling me!
---
Pretty good wep if I say so myself swing speed good roll on it and anti armor not to shaby
---
And then divide that by 9 for ~0.39% for any one of the nine in particular
---
No offense intended by this but players like you, squeezing the game for every bit of damage they can, killing Earle in 40 seconds, are the reason this nerf happened. I hope your struggling friends would atleast recognise that.
---
I don't have the game I bought any more.  I was enjoying FO76 until the most recent patch.  Now I have a game that's unplayable for me because it's too difficult.  I haven't come across a single enemy that's lower than my level.
---
I'm doing what the OP suggests.  I've stopped playing.
---
Can you share a list of which mods you are using?  You can use Cloudy's Fallout 76 Mod Manager to get a list of the mods you have loaded, if that helps.
---
I'll compare it against my list and see if I can figure out which ones we have in common.  I managed to get rid of the mods preventing me from seeing the Daily Ops Menu on the Map screen.   Now, I need to figure out which mod is blocking the operation report at the end.  That one isn't as obvious.
---
It's a good way to start making money, but not a good endgame way to make caps.
---
I chose thorn for stealth at high hp,because I don't mind losing hp. The stacking poison of thorn+gauntlet+talon also help finishing some enemies(some are really weak to it after the latest update)
---
I feel the casual player isnt subbing to fallout first or buying very many atoms.
---
I agree the game is much more challenging now and way more exciting.
---
i actually hate that. you're weird if you love it. you some kind of pervert?
---
Oof, I feel sorry for you man. I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.
---
Super sledge good two handed melee but I think war glaive best one now
---
Daily ops I'm assuming
---
1-2 second delay? Sometimes I have to click an item 6+ times to stash it, yeah that's bad
---
It's literally the same thing for every game ever, gamers are never satisfied with anything yet they keep playing such games. It's like they want something to complain about.
---
Helps you get laid after colossal prob :)
---
Agreed. Noticed this effect immediately. Also my SCORE rank is going up very quickly because I'm hitting that 10,000xp weekly more.
---
I play with a buddy that always has super duper equipped and shared for the group 24/7.
---
I mean it is an amazing perk, just doesnt help the pew pew much other than keeping it fed.
---
But if your dmg is in a happy place and you dont have to swap cards hardly ever. All the power to you, play as you see fit.
---
&gt;six legendary perk slots, so you need to advance to level 300 to unlock all of them, since they unlock every 50 levels starting at level 50. 
---
This can't be right? I'm level 170ish and I have 4 legendary perk slots available.
---
Above 350 the added protection is lost due to diminishing returns, the way the game calculates resistance.
---
Bolstering gives you added DR when you're nearly dead not when your'e at full health when it doesn't really help (Vanguard). I have tested a lot and Bolstering solar keeps me/my friends alive way longer than Vanguard SS.
---
idk. i love fallout 4 survival. im playing it again right now, geeking out over this RP outline i found where you play as a synth.  
---
You cannot compare dying in fo4 survival to fo76.  Lose all your progress and no fast travel?
---
who needs to waste a max ranked legendary perk card for something the game gives you in a couple of minutes for free?
---
Especially ultracite plasmacores requires previously crafted plasmacores (lead, copper, plastic) and flux also.
---
Some people are just sick in the head.
---
I had to stop watching that guy after he ate rations that were over 100 years old and revealed the number of times he’d been hospitalised. Crazy bastard will kill himself one of these days.
---
It's not like they've spent the year doing nothing. They've made tons of other things the year and this event was probably lower on priority. They were probably busy with One Appalachia and Daily Ops till the patch release...
---
I only take the first rank of it. I’ve never seen a camp with level 0 locked doors. It is so convenient to eliminate pickpocket and hacker cards or does it? Wouldn’t surprise me if new content comes in with rank 4 locks or terminals.
---
make deathclaws travel in packs again  
---
i never understood why bethesda nerfed  this aspect of deathclaws, knowing that after you killed one that there was five around the corner ready to turn you inside out was always the scariest part of them to me in 3/nv
---
I kinda only have junkie weapons. Im a rifleman and cant afford the ammo for commando so hoping for a little buff.
---
Great thanks. So must be in a public team. Second question since you're so helpful lol, does being on a public team negate my lone wanderer perk?
---
Need 5mm for your minigun?  Take a decent gatling gun in there and make 50-60 rounds for every 5 you fire
---
Even with ultracite plasma cores not dropping, I get more from the end screen than I use.  
---
.50 cal is a bit tougher to come out positive unless someone has ideas there.  Seeing a lot of 5-14 rounds per corpse and nothing at the end
---
You can measure server tickrate and client tickrate by just installing any network measuring tool and checking how many times per milisecond your pc sends info to the and viceversa.
---
I think they fixed it but the Line in the Sand event had this. Ended up losing half of the time because the enemies were so overwhelming that despite them being slaughtered in the matter of seconds, there were so many that we couldn't defend the turret well enough. Doesn't help that a Scorchbeast attacks at the same time. Suure you can kill a bunch at the same time for exp, but you get exp from completing the event too guys...
---
I know that at lvl 680 I have enough coins to max exactly 4 legendary cards. 
---
I never respecced,but lost many duplicate cards before this update.
---
So it should take about lvl 880-900 to be able to max 6 leggy cards.
---
99.7% of the people who play this game don't know what friendly fire is.
---
You prove you have no knowledge of NW. You can't "block for session" and then magically they won't be in any future matches you play in. There aren't enough players for something like that.  
---
I never said targeting someone with a nuke is griefing. If you can concentrate more and read, you will see the point I am bringing here is they are targeting one person every game because in their discord they have put my name on an accused hackers hit list. Have you ever been wrongly accused of something?
---
Gotcha. One piece would still be useful, right?
---
Can you clarify what you mean by explosive heavy guns?
---
Fat man, Missile Launcher, and Auto GL all count as Heavy and are also "explosive" but don't receive the effects of the heavy gunner perks. If you're using a regular ballistic heavy with the explosive legendary effect then you're fine.
---
I'm assuming you're running regular ballistic with the legendary effect cause carrying a decent amount of missiles/mininukes/40mm requires that you run max Ordanance Express or have ammo reduction armor.
---
reproduced it with a ultracite gatling laser - didnt get me fusion cores
---
the same weapon modded to prime does give me ultracite fusion cores
---
so i think this weapon is not on a rewardlist
---
You are my people. I have built a few floors, bed, an instrument, crafting benches and some stuff for farming. The only time I build more is when the challenges say so for score. Sometimes there is a scarecrow or raider tree that looks cool but that's it.
---
Be very careful at owned workshops. I opened up a L0 metal box by mistake thinking I was outside the boundaries and it took forever to get rid of the wanted tag.
---
Thanks for the tip, editing my post now
---
Population is not the key population density is and texas is 5x the size of Ohio btw
---
Its not like I tried, it was like a black hole with syphilis.
---
&gt;the idiotic build nerf
---
You know they reverted that right?
---
Take one for the team boosts your own damage too. It may work even if no one is on your team as long as you are on one. We will need to do some research on that I guess.
---
Funky duds saves you from the only real weakness a heavy gunner has. Poison. Sting wings esp during SBQ and Earls poison clouds, mire lurk queens. If you’re not doing earl or SBQ you can get by without it. But for me it’s essential.
---
Sizzling style is less essential if you have fire proof, but they stack as well. Earls fiery ceiling drops become something you can not worry about at all. Again if you don’t do earl, it’s not needed, but those two are the first perks I selected above everything else. I think with 4 ranks, I can get rid of fireproof and use those points elsewhere.
---
I didn't even think of owned workshops
---
We're not getting mischief night???? 😭 No way!
---
Edit: no sarcasm, I legit loved mischief night as much as fasnacht :(
---
Nobody wants to be the one to tell you, so I'll just do it. Your character smells like they haven't taken a bath since the bombs dropped. Sorry.
---
I visit Biv most days, love that old drunk and I've not learned all his recepies yet.
---
OP is incorrect. It’s 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, and 300.
---
I only have it cause I dont have enough perception points to have all of my build and picklock
---
I am merely saying that Microsoft has put more work into backwards compatibility in the past, including X enhanced titles. I'm not going to try to predict how this next gen fares, but I have more reason to trust Microsoft based on recent history on this one area. Regarding the SSD I will wait for the actual results to determine whether Sony's performance matches their marketing bluster. As noted it will likely be backwards compatible only and not a ground up rebuild, so even if Sony SSD is better for real PS5 games I don't think we'll see much benefit here on a BC title.
---
When it comes to making baseless assumptions based on hearsay I absolutely guarantee the X backwards version of 76 runs better. Lol.
---
&gt; to fix their game like 2,5 years ago, and even more
---
You mean take it offline, right? Because FO76 wasn't even live 2.5 years ago.
---
&gt; I just want to fucking enjoy a proper upcoming game.
---
Good then leave us be.
---
monster mash!
---
Yes, don't go running straight out there. The patch made enemies scale up to you personally, though the forest is capped at level 50. Still, you run out there with your instigating rolling pin and you aren't going to scratch anything. If you are level 50+, then you need to look at legendary perks. You start getting slots at level 50 so you need to pick them. You can also level them with coins - you will have 50 to start with and you get 2 per regular perk card you trash. Leveled up ones count their full leveled up value.
---
I suggest looking at Infiltrator which works as all 6 of the pick lock and hack perk cards. It also let's you auto hack or unlock all lvl 0 terminals and locks. Ammo factory gives a bonus to ammo production which grows as you level the card up. It stacks with the regular ammo perk, too. 
---
Stat legendary perks are good too, so consider them also. 
---
There is a public team system that allows you to team up with bonuses based on the type of team. Join one. Many team mutations and team perk card  bonuses work even if your team isn't around (except herd mentality). This also makes charisma perks much more valuable. Note: the legendary perk for charisma gives more perk points but not shareable perk card points.
---
Go back to the early areas since they added a new main quest line. There are also factions. There's a bar at the very first overseer camp site south of vault 76 - start there. Play through that and it will take you through wastelanders content.
---
The daily and wkly atom bonus tasks were replaced by a themed set of rewards. Each task gets you points and you progress through 100 rewards.
---
Theres a ton different so don't expect things to work the same. There's a new endgame boss at monoghan mine that has to be nuked like the queen. 
---
There are new daily ops to help prepare for the BoS returning. Stealth doesn't work there and the enemies will all have one other special ability that changes them.
---
There's more but you need to work through the content to appreciate it.
---
Sorry just googled 6x the size but I knew it was roughly 5x as I grew up in San Angelo
---
Imagine launching your first ever nuke and miss with it 😸
---
I rolled a TSE Gatling with 90% weight reduction during the sale this last weekend and it's already my favorite weapon
---
It wouldn't be so bad if I took dodgy off.  Waiting on AP to gun bash can suck
---
My GUN FU is slow and useless for my squirrel/monkey agility sighting style!
---
There are no alternatives until Cyberpunk 2077 comes out.
---
I'm lvl 220 and have 5 so that also doesn't check with each 50
---
REEE BETHESDA I WANT TO USE WOODCHUCKER AND NOT USE ANY DAMAGE CARDS WHY IS THIS GAME SO HARD
---
Flamer bashing works on NPCs and Flamer flames and bashing work on other players.
---
What's wrong with it? I do that event multiple times a week just for the kill legendary dailies/weeklies and never noticed any bugs.
---
You do realize that this is a live service game, right? The development is still ongoing so to say that the game was complete at launch is simply wrong.
---
If youre goint to bitch about the community maybe find a new community.
---
Bloodied stealth melee builds* don’t include ranged.
---
&gt;They owe you the game you bought and literally nothing else.
---
Yeah, we still haven't gotten that, shithead.
---
Oh lord, is it another charisma drink? I haven’t got it yet.
---
yes i mean its good, but its def not a god roll item
---
First off, you’re absolutely wrong about everything in that statement. 
---
That kind of damage is not possible with any form of bloodied build without using food and chem buffs and I don’t bother with that stuff, only “magic” weapons are capable of that kind of damage and those were not effected by the nerf at all and it’s is still entirely possible for people with “magic” weapons to kill Earle in 40 seconds.
---
Furthermore, I’m not even fully spec’d, i only have one rank in each tier of commando and flex the rest of my build between shotgun and melee for fun.
---
90 legendary weapons
---
Yup, got 3. Between them have had the spec ops suit, 2 war glaive plans, one legendary war glaive and the burrows and galleria plans. Really want the sympomatic though..
---
There is one thing I love about scrap kits. You can get the BETTER version by playing the game
---
&gt;One Tamriel killed the game for me because it completely removed all sense of danger and challenge from the world.
---
I can take my hands off the keyboard and stand completely still in ESO and overworld mobs will kill themselves attacking me (I play a tank).  You can strip off all of your armor/accessories and still wreck everything.
---
It was funny for a bit but yeah, it quickly takes the fun out of the world.
---
Right that too
---
dammit 2020 will we every be rid of you?
---
Are you telling me to change my settings for this or for Bethesda to do this?
---
You had a year...
---
Idk I thought it was more than 2 years old, I just remember 2018 doesnt matter. No I wont leave beacuse IDK, I already payed a few days ago for a month sub, so idk gonna step it DOWN a bit, because thats the solution, to not give a shit. So Im just gonna respec to 15 charisma 15 intelligence and sit in my base and watch my red turrets and sell some water to a vendor and pretend like everything is fine, like the rest of you are doing. Then Im just gonna join some random group when they kiill earl and idk sit there and debuf with my stealth perk and my charisma cards idk, just gonna chill.
---
The cryo blade is too good anyway to pass.
---
That legendary ammo perk maxed out is definitely worth it. I can make 245 ultracite 45 per tick with it ammo Smith then add in super duper.
---
Its 52 cards, 104 coins.  208 less.  So really it's more like 428 levels to get 6 cards, maybe 500 after changing stuff, getting perks etc.  Getting 6 legendary perks is meant to be end game content.  Getting to level 500 isn't that bad.
---
Are you on PS4?
---
Good thing it’s only 8 minutes
---
This is the best option for now. The interface would benefit from an update that asked for a second button confirmation. I’ve left it at rank 1 (0 level locks) but haven’t run across 0 level locks or terminals yet. I need to go test those with a friend, perhaps.
---
One piece of what, Vanguard?
---
Just switch out rifleman or whatever with picklock when needed.
---
Agreement. I'm having a lot of fun with it too
---
What are you looking for in return?
---
Preach!
---
Yes it does. But dont worry. You can counteract that using Empath Mutation. 
---
I was a Lone Wanderef build but when I saw there were many perks and mutations for team builds I changed over.
---
Ps: the in-game description of Empath is incomplete. Watch a video by Angry Turtle on the subject, you will want to change to a Team Build.
---
They should implement some sort of easy mode or beginners area. 
---
I very much welcome making the game harder, and I’d hate for all this whining to result in the opposite.
---
I dont have Fallout first so I cant hold scrap :P My stash is at a constant 799 pounds XD
---
Aw okay
---
Very good advice for light machine gun users. Just do small bursts until the enemy chunks out. Full rip if getting mobbed. The game is so laggy you can't do much else in those situations.
---
 Because you are ugly :v
---
Yeah I just dont enjoy switching out perks cause I'm lazy
---
Yes I agree. It's called the legendary perk system for a reason. You put the work in levelling up your character and you get rewarded for it. Plain and simple. Perk coins shouldn't be handed out willy nilly. 
---
If people want more perk coins, they need to look into how they can gain extra xp to rank up faster so they get more level ups and perk packs. There's lots of little tricks out there to increase xp.
---
Don't get upset at the truth. We've all seen the speedruns it's not 'magic weapons' it's literally just nerd rage, unyielding pieces, adrenal reaction and Bloodied Fixers.
---
&gt;if you've played MMOs before then you know that new dungeons don't mean new enemies.
---
...what?
---
I feel a smart fix for this would be while the perk card is equipped you need to just hold the interact button for a second like you would with furniture.
---
You agreed to buy a product. You knew what the product was. You paid money for the product. You got the product (what was owed to you) as it was agreed upon. 
---
Now I will say that it is in Bethesda’s best interest to improve the product based on feedback because they want us engaged. But this is certainly not “owed” to you simply because you bought the game, rather it is a separate transaction which you are free to disengage from.
---
This point may be a pedantic one but I believe it important. If we do not understand the nature of our transactions we get into logical traps like the final one you’ve made. 
---
If you pay someone for something, that person owes you the thing you mutually agreed upon. If you continue to give them money (and your attention) then you are implicitly agreeing to the deal which you describe as “anti consumer.” 
---
I am not saying don’t complain. I am saying you are making a bad deal if you continue to pay and don’t like what you keep getting and it is exactly what you are “owed.”
---
Agreed, they look like a real house.
---
My bad. Yes, vanguard.
---
So down to only 1 viable sneak build?....
---
if you did the rose quest you get a raider PA set.
---
But we wouldn’t want to talk about this, so Bethesda doesn’t find out....
---
It’s funny, I have absolutely zero problems killing enemies with my TSE Minigun, but the instant I start shooting at enemies with my BE LMG or AAE LMG it’s like they get a massive damage reduction. On a good note though, this lead me to figure out that an instigating railway rifle is probably one of the strongest weapons in the game right now.
---
I’m on now if you wanna join, I found 2 Gatling guns and a 50 cal
---
Can you equip ballistic ammo reduction. I carry about 20k + rounds on me at all times and it ups my weight by about 10lbs.
---
If memory serves me right there are about three blocked off tunnels to a mole miner tunnel system with bonfires positioned outside the tunnels.
---
Fallout 76 is casual... there is nothing you can’t do with normal weapons or normal time invest. 
---
Sure you can focus on one of the builds or more like on one legendary effect but your not forced to. You also don’t need a fancy 3* weapon or a full set of 3* armor. 1* just does perfect. Low health glass canon? Bloody. Drug victim that searches for drugs all the time? Pick junkies. No one of this? Pick anti armor or vampire. Anti armor is the Allrounder if you don’t want to focus on anything. 
---
But sure one handed melee is hard and maybe needs a buff... maybe you are ok with two handed melee. If you not already did the major quest you can get a nice hammer with less weight for trying two handed melee. Not sure about one handed melee but power armor is a good choice for two handed and it’s easy to get. You don’t need to life in it but you can use it for hard situations. Give it a try and scrap it if you don’t like it.
---
For the perk card packs, it’s 4 cards each, right?  26 packs is 104 cards. 208 perk coins. 
---
Every ten normal levels you get 10 cards and 2 packs. 18 cards or 36 coins. So 3.6 perk coins per level. 
---
208/3.6 is 57.78. 
---
I *think* my math is correct.
---
My Xbox did freeze up and crash last night.  This was the first time since I started playing a month ago.
---
It literally takes less than 15 seconds
---
Bingo.  Didn’t see it pop up in the rewards notice.  I assume the LR is the same.  Very nice.
---
you could aim while near the corner of a wall and you would snap to the corner and lean out to fire, kinda situational as the game wasn't really built around needing it
---
I have 30k 556 and 20k 45....
---
Hacked weapon is the most prevalent hoax so far
---
Finally, someone brought it up!
---
The fact I dont have to go to 3 specific places to get worthwhile XP anymore is a Godsend.  For so long i avoided places because it wasn't worth my time going there, whereas now it's a different story
---
I haven't gotten any ore from this event in weeks. I've been using it for a quick challenge score or to level my newbie level 40.
---
I was promised a canvas bag, lol.  Remember that debacle? Didn't end up getting one until like a year later.
---
Well I mean, no one has lol
---
To get the 100 ore you need 3 people, one person can only collect 40 ore
---
Reddit is like ebb and flow. Circlejerk and counter-circlejerk.
---
One opinion can be valid, but it attracts people with the same "direction" as the original opinion, until it finally reaches the absolute end of the spectrum. One may have a valid criticism. But shortly after it usually follows with people who use the original argument as jumping point onto statements like "unplayable" and "I'm owed" and it end with solid hate on Bethesda.
---
On the other side, one may have valid different opinion and sometimes catch other opinions as being dismissive or invalid in premise. But this too can snowball and suddenly people are dismissing all criticism as invalid.
---
Recently r/Games was a showcase of that. In one thread people were talking critically of CDPR, finally seeing the bad and not just the good. Some people went maybe too far and started seeing only the bad. And the followup discussion was counter-circlejerk with people dismissing the participants of first discussions as haters and other crap.
---
Critcism can simply be both valid and invalid. Sadly, reddit tends to bring up the most radical ones, which are usually the most inconstructive and overexaggerated. So it may lead the other group as seeing most criticism as invalid.
---
That is fair. Like I’ve said before, you are free to disengage from bad deals. 
---
I disagree that the game is fundamentally different (or difficult in any sense of the word). But I still want to try and experience the difficulties many are complaining about before I pass judgement. 
---
Might I suggest you try a PA heavy guns build? This is what I run and it was nearly unchanged as far as I can tell (maybe buffed).
---
If you’re on PS4 I could probably even get you started with some supplies!
---
I know
---
You said ash piles, are you doing a tesla?  Iirc ACP had a ton of lag from those
---
For me they are just the same as normal skinned cards. I don't spend my time in the perk screen enough to appreciate them. So yes.
---
I also was that build! I recently swapped back to PA heavy guns after daily ops as the bullet gutsies tore me apart I also dropped melee after the update since I lost a lot of damage
---
I got that day 2, with the reactor, today I got the solar panels, yesterday I got nothing. I want the signs
---
You’ll get your sixth one at 300. 
---
It’s 50/75/100/150/200/300.
---
I'm currently on rank 17, so if I keep up this pace I'll be done well before the PS5 comes out.
---
it was a suggestion for bethesda not a suggestion for everyone. As if everyone would take the time to do that
---
Even perks cant fix someones playstyle or lack of skill tho, and alot of people just dont want to adapt or become better
---
Yes I understand that but it was stated that it was one each 50 lvls
---
if the card is bad, the coins they give me will make me glad
---
Oh thanks, I couldn't heal the assistant robots of the silo with my flames and it was annoying. Now I know
---
I just went to see him after I made this post! I really wish they would have added some npcs down there with him or maybe just turn it into an actual bar.
---
 Somebody should really have told dutches about big als tattoo parlor. Would have saved a lot of hassle.
---
After my 6th pass the animated cards got zapped too, except for a few favorites.  Magnetic is one of mine as well, as is woodchucker.
---
I meant per season.  57.78 is correct counting both seasons.
---
Seems like a great armor but Im bloodied
---
I was happy to get that one too. I'm curious if the purveyor can give legendary ones once you learn the plan. Haven't heard anything on that yet
---
Were you rewarded as if you turned 64 in? I had 2 on my person and got some ammo and water...
---
I can barely find bullets and I need like 10 of them to kill a radroach lmao
---
&gt;"If you don't like the countries laws, move"
---
 Yeah, this is some really dumb apologist crap. Can't believe I'm hearing this argument
---
&gt; It comes across as dismissive because no one gets to the root cause of why the player is struggling. They are just assuming it’s because of the changes.
---
[I diagree.](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/423543/one-wasteland-feedback-and-discussion?language%255B%255D=en&amp;language%5B%5D=en) The evidence is there and in every iteration of the PTS where the feedback saying the same stuff we are seeing here and now got ignored only months ago. I think its more low-level than that. The people that play the game actively and post here actively are capable of looking past a lot of problems just by nature of conditioning themselves over time and not giving up. It is rewarding, because in my opinion the game is getting better but just at a confusingly slow pace and it seems like not a great majority of people stick around for that long in the games current state. Primary example: My friends list has been broken since August 22nd. Support is not compensating with atoms for it and stonewalling me when I ask in spite of making the game unplayable. Why is it broken? Nobody knows. When will it be fixed? Nobody knows, but oh here subscribe to this garbage support article one of our interns wrote and it will email you when we fix it. Support wanted me to recruit a friend and download some shit elder scrolls card game off steam and then add each other in that separate game as an attempted fix. This was after they un-linked my account from steam twice and had me try a pegan ritual (when in all likelihood they knew nothing we do would fix it since it broke after the August 22 hotfix) Like what the fuck? You wonder why you couldn't pay my friends to play the damn game for longer than a week and then this kind of stuff is happening in the background. The two things are related. This is the root of the problem. 
---
For me and my my discord friend group for example, the problems start even before you get into gameplay/lore with the bugs and overall janky feeling of just about everything. Even still right now as of this post, my jetpack disappears from my characters back when I switch servers and it has done this since Wastelanders came out and the fix is to unequip and re-equip it. I mention that because it particularly annoys me, but this kind of jank extends to just about every system in the game right now. Call that what you will, but if you take a casual gamer who is used to a finely polished experience even with many popular mmo/fps games and then throw these kind of bugs at them, or deprive them of a colossal problem rewards because Earle clips through the floor (or gets turned into a good pile and cant be located), or they spent twenty minutes ineffectively damaging the queen and receive no loot at the end, it leaves them with a very bitter taste. That is another core problem in my opinion. 
---
tl;dr, its not one wasteland. Its the changes One Wasteland brought in addition to everything else.
---
Well now we’re getting into the standards practiced by the programming professionals (of which Bethesda is notably poor). 
---
This industry is unique in that it can rework the “channel buttons” by pushing a patch and the consumer has agreed by consensus that this was acceptable.
---
But I speak as someone who has never thought this game was worth less than its price tag (played since launch).
---
Upvoted good advice.
---
Also keep your structures small so they can be placed easily. A added bonus is that if your camp gets destroyed you can move it and save the scrap it would have taken to repair.
---
So what is this?  The Master Infiltrator's Burden by Rudyard Kipling?
---
I was going to if it would be something cool to see
---
Yeah the purveyor/ops/Earle roll pool can drop legendary war glaives
---
Thank you for notifying me of that. Currently transitioning into a Heavy Gunner, Power Armor build with the secret service PA, so that tip will give me an edge for dealing with that modifier.
---
You know what’s odd.  Yesterday I looked in my on-person inventory and there was a full marine tactical outfit.  I already have one in my stash, and unless an outfit is extremely valuable, only keep one set.  Unsure if this was an event drop but have no idea how it got in there...
---
Cool, thanks!
---
&gt;Right now only normal hits with the Shishkebab and bashing hits with a Flaming chainsaw work.
---
The chainsaw with flamer mod also works, I used it on last Fasnacht event to heal the NPC robots.

I quit a week into Season 1. I still keep an eye on the sub to see when things will get better so I can come back. The complaints I'm seeing now are basically the same ones I saw months ago. As someone that played all the way back to the Beta I didn't see how much of a grind everything was designed to be until I took some time off of the game. I played yesterday for the first time in ages and put the controller down after two hours. I'll come back when BoS drops but there still isn't enough for me to do until then to keep me interested.
---
Oh yeah, I was checking the wiki out and it listed that and the empty compartments as the main problems with this quest.
---
I can agree with you on this tbh. While yes we should be complaining on certain things, this balance patch was a long time coming, and honestly needed in order to keep the meta from simply becoming stale and boring. I for one welcome this change to the game, as it's made multiple build actually viable in the late game.
---
Wait until 25 - 50. It gets really grindy and doesn't  ease up that much until 120. Then it's easy peasy.
---
Only 65 xp? For me i'm getting a solid 105-165 xp per kill and have been leveling up like no tomorrow and i'm a 217 now, 9 levels up since the update launched.
---
Not great, not terrible. I think the score is justified. 
---
It also lampshades the issue of Metacritic - anyone can vote without owning the game and review bomb it. Steam needs the users to own and suddenly the score is somewhere else.
---
And no, it's not just that people are not reviewing games negatively out of "sunk cost fallacy". Steam users are very able to rate games negatively. Many games have worse score than 76.
---
The caps are lost aren't they?
---
Possible, it's quite hard to test mix/match sets as they're very situation specific in some cases. But 100% Bolstering will keep you alive longer than Vanguard, more so with solar.
---
Every single time you start the game up you MUST look at that atom advertisement. They want that to erode you enough that you take the plunge and buy.
---
I was roaming around the Mire today, and found myself with a few other players at Tygart water Treatment and we were actually having a challenging fight against the robots. Sentry bots finally feel powerful again and it's as if the world has gotten harder, not our weapons being nerfed. The good thing to come from this is that these enemies now reward a lot more XP than they used to. I killed a Grafton Monster for the Queen of the Hunt quest and gained 800+xp from killing it.
---
One thing Bethesda could add is an ammo stash, that way I can store the ammo I'm not using.
---
Do you mean with normal hits? That would be a very a good change
---
I run a non bloodied level 179
---
With mostly furious or armor piercing weapons
---
 while using perk loadout manager
---
and I am struggling as well
---
its not the leveled enemy's
---
it the fact that Bethesda over did it
---
a group of level 50 mole rats  that tear up your armor and take  6 to 9 hits from a furious 50 cal is ridiculous
---
unnerf the weapons  and make mobs a mix of leveled and unleveled  enemies
---
???? "Why complain for a better product??"
---
Yes, but nawt by armor. That was patched out. Only magic shotguns are shotguns with certain rolls.
---
If they were using a fixer then they were abusing  aid buffs. That is literally the only way to achieve that level of damage with a non “magic” weapon.
---
Tastes. I'm the opposite. Without challenges ,after completing season 1,I barely touched the game omce every couple of days.
---
Bad idea and waste of perk coins, if it were a single player game and easier to grind it would be a godsend. Any lock in camps and workshops owned by others will now get you a bounty if you have the instinct to open doors or take resources, wish it had prompt to confirm. Best to stick to the base perk since it already gives +3 into lockpicking and hacker
---
Yeah, 50 cal machine guns do have an issue with ammo drops. Some give me 15 50 cal ammo, some give me 60 50 cal ammo, inconsistent. But swapping to my explosive instigating minigun and the 5mm rains down.
---
yep, once you get the plan from daily ops
---
I think the shishkebob is the only melee weapon that works for friendly fire
---
I will keep this in mind. As for me my problem has been people walking in front of me while i am prompting uplink and i exit my power armor.
---
Yea thats my problem. After the update I need every resistance point I can get but I also absolutly cant be discovered my any enemy. After reading the comments I tend to go for the SS armor because there are good skills that can make up for the missing shadow perk
---
Yep. I'm l200, but I still like casual play, and now if I encounter multiple baddies at once I'm more easily overwhelmed. It's making me have to reconsider all of my perks that I liked before. And I hate grinding for ammo. It's hard to find 556 to buy.
---
I do like some things like the daily ops. I won't do it every day, but I like that it's different daily, kind of like the things Overwatch used to do (still does?) where they would mix it up.
---
using plasma mod atm. looks cool, not sure which is the best though
---
I came across my second today. I'm level 56 and so was it...had to run away as I managed to get it mutate after a long struggle but after that it was just a waste of ammo as I was barely scratching it! So not looking forward to stumbling across more...xD
---
haha. damn that's a buzzkill. 😂 
---
i haven't been able to play since tuesday due to the hurricane that hit us in r/pensacola but i love reading around about it here. i'm a lvl 328 on since beta. it'll be nice to feel challenged again. 👌🏽
---
when and where
---
Makes sense. Thanks for the advice, nooby me appreciates it
---
Right, it's love to see some jazz musicians hanging out in the speakeasy. Give us some flapper dresses and zoot suits
---
It depends on which one. I favorite spots to claim for a challenge are the really small areas like up north by the Waterpark with the three acid nodes or the southwest one in the ashheap with the picnic tables. If those two are taken and I need the challenge done I either steal one or switch worlds
---
THANK YOU!
---
Is it only one rare/uncommon plan drop a day? As in, I got the super reactor plan during my first run today (got elder). Should I not even bother doing other runs until tomorrow, or am I interpreting it wrong?
---
I hope honestly we get a different queue system for events. Honestly this game needs a system like most games where you select an active event or quest and once the required number are ready your team loads and the event starts
---
Did you have pacifist on?
---
There is a damage cap for pvp. If you deal insanely high damage it bugs out and doesn’t hurt the other player. It might sound silly but to deal high damage In pvp you need to deal a low amount of damage. Also that player may have had a Build that specialises in pvp making them almost impossible to kill unless you have a pvp build yourself.
---
I dont believe that we have had months on end without new content several times and the game is 2 yrs old. Nothing new. Fix the damn game. ITS A MESS!!!
---
Yeah I switched to two handed weapons since they are the only viable melee option in my opinion. Unarmed is super weak now. Bloodied tenderizer hits like a small truck now , not as good as anything before but it’s usable in game.
---
People making up bad stuff about this game to tarnish its reputation even more? Nothing new here, sadly.
---
I still remember the shitshows of the "tradesteal bug" and hacked superweapons with tons of legendary effects. Many people swearing their life on it happenening to them, but noone was ever able to provide a video. At this point I don't believe an exploit/hack until I see the footage of it.
---
I break even with the .50 BMG. Fully specced low health build, 2-3 headshots drops enemies and the boss can take a whole mag if teammates are slow to help but the op reward ammo covers most of that. Plus, if teammates kill an enemy near you that's free ammo for you. I haven't tried plasma flamers for ops yet, but now that's top on my to-do list 😁
---
I think the lower level players have a legit gripe. It used to be that if you were underpowered for your level in equipment, you could go back and farm the low level areas and survive. It allowed a slower pace.
---
Also camp builders could go to lower level zones and build without fear of level 50 mole rats tearing everything apart it's a real complaint from casual, non combat oriented players.
---
das wassup
---
Yes and no. 
---
If you were forewarned about defects or could reasonably assume they were present, then this is exactly correct.
---
If the company advertises a fridge with a 20 year guarantee then they are obligated to stand by that.
---
Your analogy falls through because Fallout 76 has never just bricked, incurring cost to you to fix it.
---
That would make sense on why I can never got past 40 lol
---
Its if you are dropped from server like when you freeze on the weapon wheel 10x a night and get disconnected.
---
Sadly on events like radiation rumble draws too much aggro and I lose my stealth too fast (dunno if it's because the noise of the amount of hits it does) so I prefer to run a shishkebab there.
---
Someone did the math in another post. I think they said you needed to be 5 or 600
---
it turns out the rare rewards are rare 
---
\*shocked pikachu face\*
---
How so? If you haven’t received your copy you may want to take it up with your retailer.
---
Unless its full/blocked
---
This happened to me today and I have not purchased any levels.  Went from lvl 1 to my current level and then repeated.
---
[Casual Heavy](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c335f4e&amp;d=sq2s32sr2s22pe2c72l22ls2lt2ic4id2ip2a72l71lu2s12e72cr0ih0a80x00&amp;m=c29fea&amp;wp=w7&amp;wm=1k28)
---
This build is achievable at level 50 but if you have to level up some more to invest in perks you don’t have, it should be a little easier.  I’ve been rocking it for awhile and leveled my way into it so it’s doable. 
---
It’s a heavy build so you can tank some damage. I can craft you some heavy PA, I just have to check my sets to see which I can craft completely. And then I could start you off with 8k 5mm ammo and about 25 fusion cores. 
---
Recommendations and additional perks:
---
If you don’t want to use the Batteries Included Rank 3, you could substitute it for anything else like Power Patcher Rank 3 so you’re not blowing through resources on your armor. I use Batteries Included cause I carry all my fusion cores on me and some other energy ammo. Ammosmith Rank 2 is also very helpful, just swap it in when you have to craft ammo
---
It sounds like they were using a full sentinel set. To deal with that you need to stagger them or get them to move. This is just my assumption because I don't pvp
---
It makes me sad, when I see noobs get mad.
---
Good chances but not 100% of dropping
---
Exactly. I’d say give it time, but I completely understand why people sell it for so expensive at the moment. Some people are making LARGE amounts of profit; it’s so crazy!
---
I thought the data miners said it was a 100% chance on elder difficulty.
---
I unfortunately did not get to do this event but i did love fasnacht.
---
Now I dont mean any disrespect by this, but what is it about Halloween that makes you Americans go so crazy?  
---
Like where im from its basically non-existant, I think last year we had 1 trick or treater, not in costume knock on our door.  
---
A few minor halloween parties are held and thats about it, its just another excuse for a dress up and drink night.  
---
Whereas from august onwards we see people decorating their houses and getting costumes ready for halloween on reddit.
---
See for me it’s a really beneficial set up as is switch between a lot of different heavy weapons but I’m just amazed at how much I can make for so little resources and it means I don’t have to grind out daily ops for an ammo boost
---
No it's generally all still viable to create the circles and merge roofs with flamethrowers etc. They made it harder for a little while, but reversed some of that. We can't drop walls off of floors the same, but there are workarounds and this is totally possible.
---
It's also a really sweet Enterprise and I've seen a bunch!
---
I have completed on elder 3 days in a row with no rare rewards.
---
Problem is Im playing a bloodied build. Can you even deal decent damage after the update?
---
Haha.  Yeah, could do that.  Technically, all you need to do is enter the Level you are at the end of the day on the Personal Tracker.  I wanted to plot the rest just to get a more granular look at how much of the Daily/Weekly Grind I'm actually doing and how much Repeatable S.C.O.R.E. I'm earning.
---
I put together the Report Card after the fact just so people could punch in their number and see an instant result.
---
Just added an index for the last entered Level value in the Progress Tracker to automatically populate the "Report Card"
---
Perfect?! Maybe if you dont run a stealth build solo 90% of the time... you may get what you listed but the one thing missing thats actually the most important is fun. Its not fun to totally negate a legitimate build especially when they dont make it easy to swap between them with limited ability to change special stats and limited stash space. Daily ops basicially tell me Bethesda expects us to have multiple accoumts which isnt possible for many people on a tight schedule
---
I've noticed that my guns (not being specced much into fire arms or laser weapons) do more damage to enemies, a good option in the daily ops to burn down enemies faster then closing to melee affords..I like the changes
---
Rng.  You have a better chance at rare rewards for elder, but it's still an 80 percent chance. Not guaranteed.
---
“Piece of shit”....that’s subjective dude. For some players (myself included) the game was too easy. Pre-patch, I was literally never afraid of anything. Post-patch, I actually have to be careful. I use to walk around with no stimpacks, unless I was fighting Earle. And I always left that encounter with more stimpacks than I went in with. Now, I actually have to carry them with me all the time. I actually need my friends to help me now. My low level friends can actually do content with me. Maybe try playing with some friends dude. I made a new character yesterday and it was a little tougher for sure, but I just got one of my friends to tag along and help me. This is an online multiplayer game. Most problems low level players complain about, can be solved by playing with others. So, instead of asking people to help you with content. You come on here to complain about shit.
---
Its very unlikely to be full if its halfway through. Still not a bug
---
Just got this today.
---
If this is supposed to just be a floor only device then it needs to have a thickness on par with other foundations. 
---
Dont get why they keep releasing prefabs with such paper thin foundations,  only ensures that their always partially floating no matter where you go.
---
That its base is as thin as it is suggests to me that its supposed to be able to snap to stairs / upper floor tiles. 
---
I've confirmed that it wont snap to roof tiles, can walls even snap to it? 
---
Really should be adjusted to be separate it from its base and put the conduit snap points one all 4 sides of it.
---
Would love to use it but theres no way I can adjust my camp enough to allow for its inclusion. 
---
Would have to build a structure using it as the core foundation.
---
*update*
---
Walls wont snap to it, foundations wont snap to it, wont snaps to stairs or upper floors cant place on a roof.
---
Wth are we supposed to do with this? Leave it sitting out in a field?
---
My personal combinations:
---
Top Hat + Plague doctor mask (Atomic Shop item)  
---
Gray knit cap /Wool fisherman cap + eyepatch (AS item)  
---
Reclaimed Miner Mask (ACP rare drop)  
---
Sea captains hat (Tweed vendor in Whitesprings)  
---
Old fishermans hat (Cunnigham in Whitesprings)  
---
nearly every fasnacht mask  
---
a nice fedora  
---
a cowboy hat (prefered in black) or the Starlet sniper hat (atom shop)  
---
Sackhood (for that deranged killer look)  
---
Pirate hat or the leather hat (both AS items)
---
Same thing that it had last time they fixed it (Xbox version).  You can join the mission and see the wolf packs on the map. But, they don't always show up on your compass.  It's more of a nuisance than anything, since the first two mobs move, they are rarely where the map says when you start moving towards them.  I literally was on top of them this morning, without a marker on my compass, and I didn't agro them, until I stepped on one.
---
Weird thing is, it doesn't always bug out like that.
---
Read the last few comments by u/Valseek
---
Alrighty. Thanks for the info. 👍
---
Yep we had this also and it was a waste of a nuke ammo and time(first run we did infact)
---
Bethesda procrastination is taking more than a year ;)
---
How is Legendary something you work for?  You trade off cards, it takes 25 cards to bump one Legendary card.  Serious grind that you can't keep in the fore brain. As for Legendary weapons, mine are feeling pretty useless at level 76 compared to what they did before, mainly because every scab in low country is at least level 50 now.  I would disagree it keeps the game healthy, it just pissed off every casual player the game had because now we have to grind for ammo and pay more attention to the minutia of perk cards and swap them around for different reasons, something we didn't have to do before.
---
no reason but to screw with us
---
the weapon nerf sucks ass
---
The “Brotherhood Special Opps Suit”. You get it from completing Daily Ops.
---
Hello.
---
Disease cure gang
---
I have zero invests in rifle and my stock fixer kills normal enemy’s with about 10 hits to the body... that’s ok for me. But with perks and legendary or even magic effects this should go down to 3-5 or? And that is totally fine. How did you run out of ammo? I would understand this if you running the 308 lmg... but not with rifles...
---
Oh, wow, that would be awesome.  There could be a whole set of hidden tunnels under Appalachia.  Mole Miners are probably even MORE unhappy about the Scorched given where they live.
---
Yes. Game has been really laggy and crashing when logging to main, or trying to switch servers. Mostly crashes to desktop.
---
very nice. great success
---
It's really easy and brainless, though.
---
I play both games, and I agree dude. First thing I thought of when I heard about the changes.
---
For real though. And my alt is a stealth rifleman and it still works fine even though almost every other stealth rifleman is crying for buffs and saying stealth is ruined lol
---
You could troll with the radiation cure perks... or the increased strength while irradiated (forgot name).
---
Better than fireworks.

I'm playing Fallout 76 like anyone else - alone. This game is not designed to play with other with few exceptions.
---
I’ve found that people usually don’t want to be the one to start it . If I start it , 90% of the time others will come before I’m half way to the sq. If not it’s pretty easy to solo once you learn where the spawns are
---
I scrapped everything *insert Thanos meme*...
---
it's a higher chance but still rare
---
Good point! And you assume right, I meant ballistic weapons like the LMG and energy weapons like the Napalmer and the Gatling laser/plasma with the legendary explosive effect
---
Holy hell; this is awful.
---
Level 50 scorched vs two shot, level 40, flamer with standard nozzle -- 101 dmg.
---
Single tap... dead.
---
Hold stream until they die... 5 fuel used.
---
This is probably part of the reason why people think enemies are so spongey now.

Really? I liked em.

They should actually update some of those types of things but they keep abandoning all the previous content.
---
I love biv I wish he could be my camp ally or at least get an update with more rewards. He's literally the only reason I only carry alcohol as drinks.
---
I join or make a Ops team when I do an Op, leave it when I'm done.
---
I like that going to your camp is a free fast travel but I still need to pay to get back to what I was doing before. If I'm near a railroad station or a Red Rocket, it seems like they always have a stash and one or more crafting stations so I get rid of my junk there. Or more often, I just walk around overburdened.
---
You have to craft with it at a tinkerbench
---
Well I want everyone to know that I’m fairly certain the last 20 levels can be done by the double week score. (Did the math and it was around how much was needed but do it for yourself as well)
---
I see your point, however the game is still being patched for things that were an issue 2 years ago. Any other company would have pulled their product off the shelf and issued refunds and gone back to the drawing board.
---
Do you have super duper?
---
I STRONGLY agree with this.
---
Honestly, there's no words but I am going to say this. The whole nerfing thing had me terrified (no pun intended lol), but it was a bunch of he said she said. And now it's out, there's really nothing wrong with it. Except of course you know the vending machine glitch and the weight bench not working.
---
30k is your idea of not being able to afford ammo for commando?
---
The reason they didn't add it was because they didn't want people to get pissy about things being stolen from their camps. Honestly I wouldn't even care if I could just pick things up.
---

Might need the team looking into this "death lag"; super easy to reproduce even on private servers.
---
I read it in his voice as much as I could
---
You know there’s something wrong when you just so happen to get mostly unyielding and some of the best effects on weapons and armors.
---
I think people are just fed up to be honest, for the last year and a half people have said theres no end game content and they need to focus on high level players experience, this and the legendary perks adresses both of those to a certain degree, now all of a sudden these same people are complaining that they got nerfed or that the grind is too long and I think its made a lot of people just dismissive of everything now because no matter what, its a lose lose for anything bethesda does since the hatred seems to run so deep for them
---
it's the BASE amount that is counted
---
Crouch and do headshots. Jam some(multiple doses) Formula P into your arm to turn your .50 BMG into an automatic sniper rifle. I've been using a Vampire's fire rate reload speed Prime .50, and it barely takes ammo to kill Daily Ops enemies. I can burn thru almost a whole mag on the boss, but the op rewards usually cover that. I'm pretty much breaking even on ammo and getting more stims than I use. I guarantee you'll go ammo-positive if you use a Bloodied or Junkie's Prime .50 BMG with Formula P headshots.
---
Edit: Crouching isn't necessary with 4 doses of Formula P, but otherwise it will tighten up your cone of fire.
---
I'm just here 1 hitting lvl 100s with a shotgun. (Well, when the hit actually registers/hits)
---
No amount of charisma could make one immune to fear. However.......
---
It's a slog by yourself cause you have to baby sit with a weapon that you generally have to menu to get to and press E on each brahmin. Combine that with enemy waves and one cow that always run off by itself and then meets up again, it's just tiresome and feels like a chorelist. At the end you have to fight the SQ and fight off enemy waves attacking the brahmin. But when others are there, itxs way better. I just find better events to do than free range cause its just so time consuming with little exp payoff.
---
You are, by your own admittance, still running around and 1 shotting everything. Stop denying that you're part of the fixer commando sect that do stupid damage and were a huge driving factor for this update
---
Totally agree with your post dude. Everything low level players complain about can easily be alleviated by one thing...playing with friends. It’s an online multiplayer game. Can’t believe people are surprised they’re being overwhelmed. I created a new character yesterday, and it was a little tougher. However, I just one of my friends to tag along for a bit and I was fine. Just like an online multiplayer game should be. The enemies have mobs. So, I get my own mobs lol.
---
How do you have 470 carry capacity?
---
As it should be :) wish more people would do the same. Cheers!
---
I've gotten elder every day so far and only 1 plan. Such is life.
---
That's plenty if you do your build correctly. It'll last quite awhile.
---
In total, I was in there for at least an hour wandering around, so I had plenty of time to fight off the super mutants.  I can't say I had much of a problem, but I run a power armor setup with a bloodied prime 3 star lmg, which runs through most enemies in this game like wet paper bags.  Usually keeping that lmg fed is my problem, but the way this event drops ammo, it works out really well for me.
---
Now, I never made it past the first phase of the event, so I can't say how I would fare in the long run with whatever bosses come along. But I was not having trouble with the early waves.
---
80 % chance
---
It's amazing how when I first started playing the game, couldn't find a single stim (on console). Now I'm like 170 something and I'm finding a BUNCH. 😂😂
---
Agreed. I burnt myself out doing the score last season and completed it with about 6 weeks to spare. Now I'm just doing the dailys and if I get the 100 bonus score while doing my normal running around then its just a bonus.
---
thank ya thank ya
---
Try and kill something with your fists since the new patch 🤣
---
I agree. More like a NW queue where you say "hey, I want to do an op!" when four people queue, it teleports you there. Do your business and leave.
---
\--This suggestion would ideally be in addition to being able to manually queue from the map, so people can do them with less than four, or specific people.
---
Double tap.
---
Probs a fan cause I would of done that when creating my account
---
I’ll say this: I was a walking tank that could 1-shot any enemy in range before and I am still one now (TBH I think I’m actually taking less damage somehow.) The thing about me though is that I min-max like crazy, have meta equipment that perfectly compliments my play style, and I have already done most content in the game. I completely sympathize with those that are struggling right now. Not everyone takes builds as serious as I do, not everyone got lucky enough to get great rolls, and not everyone can invest the time into this game that I have. 
---
To those of us that are well off I ask you to put yourself in the place of someone just starting out that doesn’t have an OP main account they can switch to when they get frustrated of getting stomped.
---
I just learned about resource extractors last night. I haven't tried to build one yet but junk sites seem like they would be useful.
---
It's a shame the '76 version of the Scrapper perk doesn't let you recover screws and springs.
---
Most likely they had a full assassin sentinel armor set. It's pretty hard to punch tough that, especially if they have stimpacks, chems and perks on top of it
---
You can still play the game YOUR way,  just going to struggle a bit if YOUR way isn't at least somewhat optimized.
---
Yes, bloodied still top of the heap, but you need to be optimised to the max. Otherwise full health legacy builds outperform.
---
Yep, me and some rando did Leader of the Pack together the other day rofl, everyone gets a shot now XD
---
Ahh yeah I need updates like this, I'm at work most of the day and knowing what's up today is awesome. Take my award fine sir.
---
Exactly! That would be perfect. Let's hope
---
It's not just a select few perks or a select gun, it's all of them combined. You gotta have a solid build all around in order to do excellent damage. After this patch, less players are one shotting enemies but with the right perks, weapons, and buffs it's definitely possible still
---
Was gonna make a joke about how Americans have an obsession with guns, but I'm too tired.
---
This, the extra ammo from ammo Smith and super super doesn’t count for the challenges
---
THIS!
---
This specific issue isn’t effecting endgame players as much it’s mainly mid level and casual players that are struggling. People are writing them off without any perspective on their issues because they assume it’s high level players like me that are complaining
---
Well, stealth builds are loosing a part of their power. But if you see Angry Turtle's latest video, you should see commando build should have no problem doing the event. Neither should melee, I know because I have done it with my melee build.
---
And certainly, Bethesda doesn't facilitate build swaping. But it is possible. I have like 4 builds in my main character and swap between them all the time. Granted, I use the Perk Loadout Manager to make it easier to swap builds, but I used to do it without the mod.
---
Ugh, I saw what you mean. It's such a slog with non-glitched(magic) weapons. I actually quit ACP for the first time today.
---
Agreed. I have a back injury, and it's a pain bending down over those fucking corpses to rummage for ammo.
---
I wouldn't take it personally bud, all sorts of things can happen. I had to leave a daily op earlier because I didn't plan well and had to pick up my kids from school.
---
The amount of angry faces and thumbs down emotes I got during fasnacht for healing the robots was insane
---
It's a drop from mole miner pails in the upcoming treasure  hunting event. Some people kept their craftable pails until now and apparently got the new items. They increased the weight of the craftable stuff so they had to use them
---
Oh my god, I never knew this!
---
Never even occurred to me. Too used to screaming into the abyss.

It’s literally an online multiplayer game dude. Its literally Bethesda’s first online multiplayer game. It was clearly designed to be played with friends. There’s literally perks that work better with teammates. Legendary effects that work better with teammates. Only one perk (lone wanderer) helps with playing alone. There’s a public team feature. Most events have recommended limit for players. The game was literally designed to be played with other people. Since beta, I’ve been playing with friends dude. So, don’t lump me in with you. I’m not “anyone else” and neither are my friends.
---
I don't buy armor from purveyor, too many bad combos
---
Not to mention if you really want it that bad without grinding or paying caps there’s gonna be an ATX version at some point.
---
Oh yeah, a water purifier would be really helpful. On the other hand, I'm working on Lead Belly rank 3 so I can eat and drink without worrying about rads. (Though I still gotta cook/boil to avoid diseases.)
---
80% chance. No guarantee youll get a rare reward. I didnt get one yesterday
---
Thanks for the feedback! Maybe it is something based off my gear or build so I’ll check that.
---
Now it actually feels satisfying to take down a Mirelurk Queen!
---
Daily Ops. Its a rare loot drop.
---
I keep forgetting about the legs!
---
Mine worked fine earlier. Might double check your quests to make sure it didnt give it to you and not pop up the notification. I've had that happen a couple times and spent a while trying to figure it out when I had the quest the whole time and it didnt auto activate
---
Yeah thats true, but people also get very defensive when they themselves are questioned, like i simply remarked that i personally have felt ive been doing more damage to enemies since the patch, each time i say this i get downvoted as if im lying or something, ive seen others get down voted for saying the same thing so people will start getting defensive for their experience and only their experience.
---
and thats the top 25 from 350+ legendary's.
---
Yeah. Ever wonder that previous positive experiences with Bethesda might be why people are extra salty about this game?
---
I did not know!  I'll have to try that out next time, thank you!
---
I know what OP said. I was giving the ***correct*** levels for your reference.
---
I can understand adjustments, but last week those level 68's in West Tek had 700 hit points.  The level 100's in the daily op had well over 2,000.  Or at least all the damage numbers that pop up per shot show that I was doing over 2,000 damage before they went down.
---
Portable, minimalist CAMPs are a thing. Have a 2x2 with all your crafting tables and a stash in it, maybe a bed, and you can plop it down just about anywhere. If you want to get fancy you can even add walls and a roof.
---
Ah, okay. My bad.
---
Really? There were daily PTS posts regarding how awful the system was/is.
---
I think one of the biggest reasons I don't like building is because my OCD cringes when thinking about placing everything perfectly. I might like it better if objects snapped to a grid. Or better yet, if you could find/buy pre-made blueprints for entire camps and then just build components as you get the resources.
---
Well thats weird, I wouldve assumed it worked similarly to a Fixer plan. I hope that was an oversight and they fix it
---
That's about what I'm seeing... 1-shot now takes 2-3,  2-3 shot now takes 5-6 shots, etc.
---
Super easy farming spots that took less than 30 seconds to do the event now take a couple mins and you have to duck and watch your health and such now.
---
Manhunt was an easy 30 second in/out event. I almost died twice and had to kite a group of supermutants away to keep them all from ganging up on me.
---
Even Leader of the Pack / Wolf Hoard up near the fairgrounds was suddenly a bit more challenging.
---
Fly Swatter was an easy 7ish shots and less than 10 seconds to complete the event. I had to unload at least 15 shots into it now, and hope that it didn't fly off while I was reloading.
---
It's definitely more challenging.... but not to the point the OP was hearing about. I think the OP is watching bad vloggers that are just in it for the clickbait without actually playing the game much. Fake news and all that. Those kinds of people are why 76 has such a bad rep. I wouldn't watch their content anymore if that's the kind of "news" they are reporting.
---
I like sticking to Final Render and Rifle Gaming for FO76 content. They both love this game, and any complaints are warranted and constructive. You can tell they are annoyed or frustrated by things sometimes. They focus on why they love the game and keep their notes on the fun and positive and keep all the negativity out of it.
---
You play on ps4? I got tons from last year lol
---
The only reason that I’m even doing the legendary run is so that I can get the Subjugator outfit and the greenhouse set.
---
With a laser allergy I bet it's annoying always asking restaurants if their food contains lasers or not.  
---
"Do you have a laser free menu?"
---
I've noticed that.. it's exactly falling to about the sameish little bit left each time, so I shoot again...ill have to try waiting for another second or two and see what happens.
---
It disappeared one time and I scrolled to my pip boy event slot and tagged it again.
---
Yes it seems it has the same drop pool as " forbidden knowledge"
---
Im a hoarder and I hate farming ammo. This took me a loooong time to gather :P
---
Or add backpack like mods to torso.  Maybe you need a PA scout badge to add storage to torso, like small +5 carry weight or something but let us use the damn grocers or chemists mods!
---
Trust me, the plasma flamer is disgusting. Think your lmg, but you have to aim even less.
---
I advise trying it with slug buster for the best experience.
---
HA! Yeah. This one time i was whacking away and this low level ran up and shot at me and gun bashed me several times and then they stopped and i swear i could see them doing that maths meme pics. And then they went off. 
---
Another time in radiation rumble some level 300+ messaged me and asked what i was doing. They'd never heard of friendly fire.
---
As a rifleman my pile grows a litte every day ;)
---
luckily, the uplink quests seem very easy to do in under 8 minutes if your is above level 120\~\~
---
Well you’ll need a reliable place to repair and upgrade your gear. A camp is really the best place. Plus you get xp bonuses for sleeping so it’s good to have a bed/sleeping bag. You don’t need anything fancy but you’ll find it super helpful as you progress.
---
I do not agree. Like I said in response to Beefy and agreeing with him because the only people down voting him, are the ones that don't want to put the work in.... they are called legendary perks for a reason. 
---
If someone wants more perk coins then work for it. Use the tricks of the trade to increase your xp. They're already easy enough to acquire if you know how to gain extra xp and therefore level up faster. And now that enemies are scaled, it should be even easier to gain more xp.
---
If anything I think it's probably well balanced. I'm level 516 on my main. I've fully upgraded 3 perk cards, have 2 stars on 2 perks and 1 on another. I've just gained 2 perk packs and more level ups in the few days since it's been live and have 82 perk coins banked. And I'm happy with that. 
---
If they gave out perk coins for events etc, there wouldn't be anything "legendary" about them.
---
Hey they got rid of survival due to low player count, and the NW player count is looooooww. On xbox you see the same people in every match, doesn't speak well for the numbers. But yes, sweet summer child or whatnot
---
Complaining is a type of feedback. If a player is unhappy with something, they complain about it. I know, there are constructive and non-constructive ways of doing that, but they are both feedback.
---
These are the same people that were dismissive of the pvp community . It’s a tad bit funny that the shoe is on the other foot now.
---
It seems like Bethesda doesn’t know what they want to do with this game or who they want their target audience to be
---
Fallout 76, 76%. I'm sure that's totes legit.
---
Are you sharing a perk card that adversely affects the build they are using ?
---
When you offer a "Live Service" then yes the game developer owes you more than what you bought at launch.
---
And I thought my 600+ was a lot lol
---
Or one hundred lvl 1 Mirelurk Queens!  
---
I imagine they would be very small and swarm you in a pack like land piranhas.
---
sorry for the stupid question, is there quick way to find where your teammates are on the map? I've had a few signaling to come over or having their health matter start going down and I want to come over but I can never find them on time on the map.
---
I removed stormchaser(i had rank 1,2 and 3 animated ffs and lost many duplicates for that),because it's the absolute worst perk in the game. For the others animated I kept all lvl 1s and maxed. This way I can just level them if needed(never).
---
Typically you are catching them after they finished. For some reason people just sit in the groups after and won't even Thumbs Down emote for you. Across four characters I had an average of three-to-four servers per character before I found a group that was just forming or hand none so I could wait only briefly for someone to join. That said keep trying, you generally don't need more than one or two other people.
---
You have to remember most of these teams are finishing in less than 8 minutes. That's not long to catch them before they start/as they start.
---
Oops.
---
I noticed this before the update, but it does seem to be slightly worse and it practically breaks gun fu on my commando.
---
I understand your point. To get free cores as an extra reward is just one point, every 7-8 minutes a legendary from murmrghs loot pool is another point. the extra xp is also another point. It’s not just another grind for ammo
---
It means you aren't bored enough,which is good.
---
I’ve noticed a huge death lag too. My boyfriend gave the new update a try and while watching I noticed with Ghouls in Morgantown when they get down in health they usually just die off instead of needing the final bullet.
---
I scrapped everything......and spent it all on hacker/lockpick.  Perfect balance....  
---
Why aren't I doing as much damage as other people??
---
fml I didnt know this. I've dropped or exhanched about 20 shishkebabs including legendary
---
Did you craft the quest item?
---
I think so yes plenty of longterm players feel the same.
---
I currently find myself with an abundance of some materials after this patch. From running daily ops as a junkie power armor build with heavy guns I went from \~4000 rounds to \~33000 rounds of 5mm and literal DAYS worth of legendary weapons/armor for script. I'm loving how the game feels now, the only thing I would like to see is some information from Beth about how they are going be going forward with the new damage formula on weapons and how buffs/nerfs will work in the future and an increase in our daily limits for scrip/gold.
---
I wish, that was my favorite in 4.
---
Seems like a lot of work
---
Just my opinion though. They had to add the ammo because of the increase in use.  New score is blah. Ops blah.  I dont find any of the rewards amazing. Im level 450. I have everythjng and dont need ammo. I chose poison resist because nothing in general blew me Away. We all have a right to feel how we do. The change in damage calculation, builds is a little too extreme to me. I love enemies scaling up, but Find the overall damage nerf to be too far
---
Just blindly accepting Bethesda’s fuck ups wont help anyone. Those people complaining have good points. Bethesda has made some really stupid decisions in 76’s short life and telling people to not complaint isn’t doing it ahh favors
---
Just got retirement plan
---
With the increase in xp you earn per high level mob, it's actually a lot easier for me to grind out the repeatable xp challenge just doing stuff I would normally do anyway.  I can grind for score secretly while not grinding for score!
---
This right here. went from around 4000 rounds to 33000 after a few days worth of ops!
---
XP for sleeping? Why didn't anyone tell me that? Lvl 50 here I come!
---
Not sure that's the right link, it's new Vegas real locations. I'd love to see your cosplay tho
---
The ammo for commando is actually cheaper as bullets per kill is redicuously less than a rifle build!
---
Were you using vats?
---
Ammo Factory count?
---
It happens even if you're not 3rd person. Happened to me twice yesterday.
---
I play in 1st person POV, and it interrupted me when someone ran behind me.
---
Nothing on PC.  Never had an issue. That's no reason to deny us it if it was problematic on shitty consoles.
---
This community it majority in support of Bethesda. It’s not like saying I love this game brings a negative reaction.
---
Damn, that hurts dude
---
It'll grow faster as a commando as it'll take less bullets to kill things!
---
There are trade offs, I am lvl 372 on my main and I am a bloodied sniper build. My shorty did almost 900 damage and my handmades did 600+ and 300+ damage before the patch. Now the shorty is around 600+ and the handmades are 115 and 500 after. So it does take more ammo to kill the higher level baddies but I also get more so now too. I dont mind the changes, never been a fan of nerfs but it is a change we will never win anyway
---
😭That's crappy, I was mad when I didn't get anything yesterday
---
I want one.just because it was legacy "quote "unquote "a few weeks ago even though we could probably obtain that exact piece from the purveyor...now I'm curious is this tradable? Did you get a plan?because if it's a plan with the same perks over and over....
---
I wouldn't blame you, but I also understand not taking the chance lmao
---
I think the catfish mirelurk that was in the concept art for Fallout 3 would make a good boss for the Mire.
---
They have skins for PA that is has raider aesthetic. they have outfits. Don't think many players worried about combat armor skins as much considering 90% of players cover up anyways with a oufit/hat/helmet.
---
Some people like looking all military-like. I like wearing the amusement park outfit and the Nuka-shine hat.
---
Not everyone has low standards.
---
Are we taking bets before the meta meta threads start?
---
"Threads talking about complaints vs criticism are missing the point" is due for its run at the top of the hot list.
---
I'll be honest and say that once I completed last season's SCORE I started to play less, and for the last 3 weeks of the last season I stopped playing all together. I've only just started playing again with this latest update.
---
80% chance for a rare, still got that 20% of nothing
---
I've had a blue screen crash every day. Thankfully it's only happened once each day tho
---
Why is nocturnal still even in game when they made night time last less time? Talk about useless perks/legendary effects.
---
The door -&gt; wall -&gt; door one?
---
If that's true, then I would almost consider coming back.
---
you get one chance a day to get the RARE reward
---
Oh!ok it's a plan!just took a closer look.same affects evertime.so probably cant trade it
---
Mine hit for 2k prenerf it hits for 50 now
---
You lose duplicate cards?
---
I run optimized because I still want my QOL perks.
---
Instead of something that eeks out more damage, I swapped in things like Scrapper and some other stuff. Then I am not constantly swapping cards all the time to maximize whatever it is I am doing.
---
I also run a few weight management perks in place of a few more damage or survivability perks. Sure i might die more often, and takes more time to kill something ,but I am not having to  constantly manage weight after every battle.
---
I may have to take an extra shot or two to bring something down, but that's ok if I am not hampered by all the card swapping all the time.
---
... though on that note, I finally install a perk manager (PC) and holy cow, it makes this a non issue now. I'm going to be re-tweaking my character again.
---
I have perk manager saves for "bloodiedsneak" and then "scrap/craft/repair" and then I want to make one for "findallthethings" (like can do, pharma  farma, etc) and more ... 
---
I will say that I upgraded a few of my legendary stat perks, which gave me just enough extra points in some of my stats to where I was able to re-add my damage perks, then, say, slip in a LVL1 perk of some weight reduction, etc. Or added one more point to char, so I can run travel agent and save caps (I wasn't running it for a while)... just stuff like that.
---
Optimized = do your goal to the best of it's ability, but deal with the hassle of other aspects of character management.
---
non-Optimized = do you goal a little less optimized, but  less hassle of managing your character.
---
I also really enjoy the new update but there are some things that are a pain. The major spot I've noticed the nerf was when I was trying to shoot down a cargo bot for a nuclear keycard. It was flying around in circles fast and too high in most spots to use vats. I spent at least 30 minutes and broke one gun just whittling its health down. It also never slowed down like it usually does when you get the health down a ways. By far the most frustrated I've been trying to kill something in this game lol
---
I don't think so. I usually use Inspirational or Strange in Numbers
---
Since the BoS are all about technology, wouldn't they confiscate Biv?  
---
Are we going to find Biv roaming around their base with their insignia stamped on his ass, trying to peer pressure random scribes into drinking with him?
---
&gt;Are ppl farming likes for some reason? 
---
On Reddit?
---
No of course not. Their pasta is 100% all brand original comment.
---
I’ve cancelled FO 1st and shelved this game because of your reasons given. The one wasteland has made simple tasks way too difficult. I mean I don’t bitch I just move on to the amazing library of games I have!
---
N.O.W. New One Wasteland?
---
What did it cost?
---
Not as bad as doing a silo for 20 minutes, then fast-traveling to the prime fissure and crashing as you approach the SB queen.
---
It was just the name.limited time reward from back when they had the survival world.people called it legacy even though you could find one if luck- or unlucky enough
---
50 cal
---
it does? You do less dps per bullet but you do dps faster as I understand it. That means it uses more bullets no?
---
I personally don't think legendaries should be super game changing, I like them now.  Although Electric Absorption is bomb.
---
Yeah, it came as plan. I haven't crafted one so I don't know about trading it. I read someone said you could remove the skin from The Gutter, so maybe if you remove the skin?
---
*the horrors that await below will blind the mind as they are simply inconceivable by any human measure.  The only thing for us to see in that void is madness*
---
No worries. I appreciate the effort you went into crunching the numbers.
---
Yes 50 cal
---
Unless that restriction is Atom skins only.. I'm not sure. I've never traded with anyone.
---
Haven't got woodchucker yet. Should I scrap the non animated version in order to get that?
---
Well rested bonus. It’s either 30 or 60 seconds to get it. Playing an instrument also gives an ap bonus
---
80% for uncommon/rare plans given you complete Elder tier and given that there's a small chance you'll get an uncommon/rare plan on Initiate and Paladin tier too (5-10%) that bumps it up to about 83% chance you'll get a plan from a Daily Op. So yeah about 1/6th of the time you won't get a plan.
---
The good news is to offset that, about 1/8th of the time you'll be awarded TWO plans instead of one so it almost but not quite balances out over time. IIOW today you didn't get one. But some time in the next week or 2 you'll get 2 plans in one run and that'll sorta make up for it.
---
I don't think the number who do that in 76 is that high.
---
Combined with ffr, pretty amazing
---
My situation now. I’ve also noticed my anti armor explosive handmade is as good as my bloodied variant now. Game makes no sense in termed of trying to optimize my build.
---
Best legendary perks are the SPECIAL stats. I was able to add a few more poitns here and there to specific stats so that I could squeeze in a LVL1 card here, or a LVL1 card there to really bring the quality of life back up from a max damage build.
---
Just 1 level of weight savings perks is huge if you didn't have it at all before. I still have a ton of coins left, so I' mwaiting to see what else I really NEED before i spend any more.
---
The odd thing is I hope we can get all of them..unstoppable monster was one there was also a double barrel most were meh.but the custom name on it I guess
---
I remember getting something like a creature attractant from the quest to get the scorched vaccine. As far as I know nothing can be done with it but it would be nice to be able to use something like that for powerful defensive builds
---
yeah, I did that.  Even with no extra coins in it, I accidentally picked a level 0 lock at a player's camp.  Stupid 10 cap bounty...
---
Maybe an outfit or flux
---
Hell yes. But given that you get only 1 perk coin for an entire level-up, I doubt Bethesda would give us multiple coins for any event.
---
QOL is huge for me... I removed damage perks in order to carry more of this or that, I love to just wander around. Taking stuff down is important, but so is hauling a lot of stuff to sell.
---
Do you get to unlock the skin and apply it to other assault rifles?
---
The difference is that at high hp I could kill a mutant with 1 power hit. Now it takes me 3 in stealth. And I can't add perk cards or strenght points.
---
The .50 cal. 
---
*But on a side note, while I know it was just a typo, now I want a Gamma Gatling Gun that does 50 Rads per shot!*
---
They didn’t nerf any specific build tho, they just changed the way the game does math and pretty much everything lost damage . Bloodied still does the most damage
---
Even if it came from Problem, it would have been better than daily ops of all things.
---
And correct me if I'm wrong but isn't this all just temporary? They did this damage change in order to make future balancing easier in their part.
---
Stop complaining about people complaining about people complaining. Tsk. I’d like to complain.
---
Hey look no downvotes!
---
So that 1st play through  you gotta make it count?
---
What's the new outfit?
---
Edit: never mind, just realized you probably mean the one from Daily Ops
---
I have an AAE Lever gathering dust in my stash that you’re welcome to, if you’re on PS4.
---
I have faster swing reduced weight grognak axe that I bought ages ago. I didn't really think about Nocturnal on it at the time. Just thought something funny was going on or I forgot to put perk cards back on after crafting/hacking/picking on why it would suck sometimes. Damn you Nocturnal!!
---
It's not that that the gamepass version doesn't allow them, but the way gamepass stores the game locally in an archive format makes it incompatible with the current version of the mods that work on the steam and beth launcher versions. I've heard some of the mods can be made to work, but it seems like a headache.
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/fle0C2T](https://imgur.com/gallery/fle0C2T) working link, gotta say, not too shabby.
---
How does it work? Do you go visit the dude every time you finished a daily ops?
---
Storm chaser doesn't seem to work during a light rain.
---
were it so easy
---
armor still seems to be working for me but i do think the vats bug is back so you need to come off vats and back on if the first shot misses
---
Probably ur the only one that liked it. A lot of people just want to look like they been copy and pasted from call of duty. Which is why I have gotten a bunch of god roll weapons from trading subs from trading the BoS spec Ops outfit.
---
Technically three. 5/10/80%. If you hit Elder on the first run, all three chances are rolled, with the chance to get three rewards, I think. Like, 0.4% maybe?
---
And that’s per character as well.
---
Do you see *this* sub full of those complaints?  Because I don't.
---
So, if this sub is not where the complainers are - and it isn't - the what's the point of whining about it here?
---
And not every post that talks about bad things with the game is just bitching.  Bethesda really screwed the pooch with FO76 and has been playing catch up ever since.
---
Yeah, leveling up to rank up my legendary perk cards is most important to me now. Combat, combat and more combat!
---
Exactly what i have been trying to tell players.
---
heading that way myself
---
I run  a 179 level toon  with furious weapons while using Perk load out manager 
---
I was playing a week ago  before the patch  and still had to use caution around some places and mobs
---
the weapons nerf  and leveling were not necessary and broke the game  for me
---
I get lit up on IPA and the speed seems fine to me
---
Full unyielding armour, high strength, a good bagpack.  You could get higher if he had the high capacity mod but for him chemist mod makes sense.  You can go carnivore and eat bramin meat or pizza roll, idk about herbivore.  Its very nice for the vault dweller who like to pick up the shinies.
---
Fusion cores and repair kits 😆
---
If you check the wiki there are more cut liquors that were probably supposed to launch alongside the others - firecracker whisky and toxic gin. As someone who enjoys brewing in-game and has all the recipes I would love to see these ones reintroduced.
---
That's an interesting question. I'll have to check in a min. Trying to find robots still alive to kill atm..
---
Nope, just the base
---
Yeah couldn’t find him yesterday either
---
that change didn't shorten the nocturnal gears window, but it's still a useless prefix.
---
It's your gun. The hunting rifle can no longer one-shot kill everything, and it fires too slowly to be useful. Your options are to either go low health and find an instigating or bloodied legendary hunting rifle or lever action, or up your base damage with an instigating gauss rifle. I didn't want to go low health so I ditched my two-shot explosive lever action for an instigating gauss rifle.
---
The black powder rifle or dragon can also one-shot-kill still, but they can't be silenced or scoped, which makes them sort of useless against groups.
---
gotta earn those caps
---
Cool, I knew getting FFR on that harpoon gun would pay off someday
---
With the commando perks equipped the numbers get pretty high per bullet and an increased fire rate means more bullets hitting the squishy weak point in a shorter amount of time!
---
It's usually 1-3 bullets to the head depending on the enemy all done within vats.
---
This new patch improved some things and is absolutely broken in others. I can fight scorchbeasts and take reasonable damage but if I'm fighting insects like ticks and cave crickets I'm dead in two hits. They have effectively broken the game as far as random encounters go.
---
I have twice. Once with the resilience bots in burrows, and once with the freezing mutants in galleria.
---
basically
---
I still haven't understood if this is intentional or a bug in the update. I'm even sacrificing 12% gun accuracy(talon) for nothing basically. 
---
The damage model has been update ok.Now it's time to let them know this weapon class has been hit too much.
---
Tbf I only do daily ops to complete and daily/weekly challenges and get the rare rewards because nothing else seems worth the effort, even the legendaries imo as I’ve always got too many that clog my stash and I end up selling to NPV vendors because they’re almost always shit
---
Also the ammo return for some of my weapons has been poor or even inadequate unless I’m using the Gatling laser
---
It's the new white wolf fedora.
---
You are dying something wrong then. I clomp around in pa and ohk these same super mutants. Jss super sledge power attack ftw.
---
That said 3 hits seems fine imo. 1 hit kill everything doesn't make for a very interesting game though of course ymmv.
---
So then you don't need legendary weapons and armor?
---
My wife has a bug that once she completes a challenge the challenge just keeps repeating it is completed over and over.   It does not change her status of the board but it is annoying.   Only way to stop it is to restart game
---
*Pour some sugar on me. You gotta earn those caps.  Pour some sugar on me.  You gotta trade up fast.*
---
Not really. If you hit Elder on the first run, then that’s three rolls (5%/10%/80%) to get a rare reward. That’s character specific, so you could do it five times per account.
---
If you don’t hit Elder, you can keep running it until you do.
---
Survival mode was removed some time last year, as hardly anyone played on those servers.  But yes, they should have "adventure hard core" and "adventure filthy casual".  Then everyone would be happier!
---
I am your build to a T armor wise, even secret service and can definitely feel a change in enemy designs and whatnot. Enemies get more health but our guns get nerfed, doesn't make sense at all.
---
If it's a single shot rifle  instigating is probably the highest at the moment..I could be wrong but a instigating lever rifle with the right mods or even a hunting rifle with a .50 receiver does about 200+ damage double that on the 1st hit a headshot multiplier maybe throw in 2x for sneaking. Probably see 1k damage give or take
---
That's what I did. A few months after release it was clear that the game would never recover from the dupes, that Bethesda couldn't fix anything without breaking two more, that there would NEVER be text chat or guilds, and that the whole game is an assist flip scam designed to milk the FO fanbase one drop at a time with MTX.    
---
   
---
Fuck this game, fuck Bethesda. Because of their blatant lies and absolute disrespect for their customers I will NEVER purchase another Bethesda game.
---
I'll not way to scale back on enemy lvls is to make a new character haha
---
The outfit makes me think more metal gear,I'm considering trading it since for the short term it has stupid value.
---
Sigh. Like we're not already doing that. 
---
If you are going to go into West Tek like newbies, you need to do the following, and then let us know how it goes:
---
1\] Leave your power armor at home, and go in with some level 20 boiled leather armor. It's cheap to make.
---
2\] Take along any weapons you like, so long as they don't generate more than 60 damage.
---
3\] Limit yourself to 20 perk cards. Your perk cards can only be those available to a level 20 player. See [The Perk Matrix](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/perk-matrix/) if you're not familiar with the perk levels.
---
4\] Limit yourself to 100 rounds for each weapon you take. That's roughly the amount of ammo a level 20 player has on them these days when they're maxed out.
---
West Tek is not impossible. I do it regularly, but I'm not taking the mutants down in  2-3 hits. More like 5 to 6, which means you're going run out of ammo before you clear the site, if you rely on one weapon. I go there recently to reap weapons to sell, so I can buy more ammo. The mutants don't run with my ammo type, but I eventually collect enough unusable ammo to run through the ammo converter.
---
Feel free to post your expert-optimized build, so we can see how it's done.
---
He self destructed and destroyed any chance at a cathartic or satisfying end to a fight.  
---
Truly the greatest troll.
---
*Pour some radaway one me cause I need your love*
---
I have played probably 20 mmo style games over 13 years and bugs and losing weapons occurred in all of them.  The technology that drives them is not infallible, nor is the code. I doubt it ever will be since they are made by people under deadline to get stuff done.
---
Think about it this way. If u play everyday, u can get elder everyday. And its not like the drop pool is massive.
---
Seriously. That's the move. Bang........... Kaching!
---
Yep, looks that way, this was my first return, seems to be repeatable from the dialogue.
---
I think if you go to the team screen on the map  you will have a fast travel option.
---
if the base amount is 21, shouldn't I be making 21 per batch? or is that x21 I see not the base amount? I guess I should read up more. 21x 3 is 63 not 43
---
You should change the flair to suggestion, I love this idea
---
yeah, it happens every once in a while.  Bad luck for you to get it twice in a row.
---
Yep, I'm on Xbox and it just shuts down, black screen half the time.
---
You think I didn't struggle as a low level?  Of course I did.  Everyone did.  Bit you'll get past it if you keep playing.
---
Read the note in the tent he usually hangs out in.
---
You and me both.
---
Other than ultracite 45 I rarely have to craft ammo. Between the ammo maker ammo converter and picking it up I'm usually good.
---
Its a plan. You can't sell or drop it. Takes legendary module to craft. Similar to SS armor
---
I always hated the day night stuff.
---
I wish they combined the perks so both day and night would do something in a single perk. Switching them out every time night or day opens up is a mess.
---
Like the 40 max hp during night combined with heal rads during day wouldn’t be bad if it was the same perk.
---
Well i did like the weight bench lol.. im not going out of my on score this time.  Feels like the a repeat and I dont like the rewards. New bullion plans wouldve helped. Im a bloodied stealth commando and I can substitute any of my fixers into my build the damage is pretty close no need to waste damage increasing chems bobbles  or alcohol now they barely increase any damage
---
It's just too physically and mentally exhausting at this point. I'm just gonna keep my trap shut and then vote in November.
---
Canned meat stew baby
---
Communications in this game still sucks. There really isnt any, dont know if it is a language barrier or just introverted gamers but I can never get anyone to talk when I am in a group. Would love to use some tactics but maybe I am asking for too much.....
---
I noticed this too on xbox.also vats is bugged.when you tap it.your shots go all over the place.but if you exit and tap vats again it works.so double tap vats to get it to work properly.
---
Well, I was liking the game I bought. And less then a week later ole patchy McPatch came out and it's a drastically different experience for me now. Same game, I guess, if we are being technical. But it isn't what I expected and was playing when I paid for it.
---
I don't recall seeing it before, for what that's worth.
---
It can be mildly double edged. It is powerful, but now your spendy LMG/minigun also spends nuke zone materials in addition to what it already does for regular ammo.
---
The weapon nerf doesn't just apply to weapons its perks too all damage is now additive rather than multiplying the damage output sobit goes for all damage perks heavy, commando etc.
---
Since launch yet me and my friends have them all.  It's not hard to make a new character,fast travel close by and walk there.I admit it took me 2 characters to get bog town,but what is it? 20 minutes?
---
Yeah that's why I'm probably leaning to dump it, i already play daily and have 2 characters if I really want it again i can double up my dailies, but most outfits get old after about 5 days a good weapon lasts forever.
---
Wow so it affects all of the combat rifle tyepes
---
Yo, I got the legacy be flamer 90 for the mask and flux today.
---
You mean the short gatlin.thunder pipe.not laser or plasma or mini.
---
Unfortunately on PC, but I appreciate it
---
Yes but it didn't proc
---
Wtf?! They cancelled Halloween?!
---
I'm thinking about getting intelligence to get more from my power cores seeing I need my power armour more.
---
I mean the entrace hole
---
I sometimes like to switch off to a weapon I haven't been using for the final enemy, as whatever you have equipped when he goes down determines what the final ammo reward for the event is, and it is something like 700ish 5mm
---
That’s hardly a 25K weapon....
---
Sometimes jokes get too real, but yeah, without saying much just thank you for voting. I can't believe I have to say it, but thank you.
---
Yes annoying but worth it for that factor. I mean sirens are still a thing.
---
Well then, this struggle is on your friends. Good luck with that.
---
I also noticed a bug in long term firing of my laser gatlin.it holds a few hundred rounds and sometimes just stops shooting like it ran out of ammo but it was not.
---
Exactly this ^.
---
It was fun when I was clearing the kelly monument of radstags and yao gai with a minigun. But other that, will probably swap it out for some SPECIAL points.
---
You have  9 point cards,see the difference?
---
Like I said, that’s what fed76 says it’s worth. If it’s true or not, I don’t know.
---
That's half the backpacks in the atom shop, just a bunch of bullshit like a bottle of moonshine and a purse tied to a frame with jute twine
---
Nope, only thing that sees me are molerats for whatever reason
---
I also want to mention daily ops give a reason to look for good troubleshooters, mutants weapons
---
You played 20 mmo's that just delete items from your inventory once in a while?  Were they all games you found on facebook and pornhub ads?  lol  
---
/doubt
---
You just gotta ignore the posts. One thing I’ve noticed coming from /r/fo4 is that it’s all discussions here, while that sub has screenshots that you still learn from, and it’s all just fun.
---
[here ya go ](https://imgur.com/gallery/bH9Iipr)
---
Yes they changed the entire game and some may want to respec into something else because survivability makes certain builds less preferable. And there no way they could tell what build a person is so a blanket reset would be easy. The real question is why would you argue against your own interests if not to simply be contrarian?
---
Agreed that the Chem fiend thing has been around long before the patch. Im junkies with full chmw fiend and I often reup before it runs out if I want the highlights.
---
And I just finally figured out how to scrap your old cards, go to the line of cards within each area and while you are on the card you will see “F” to scrap.....
---
I bought the Grafton Outfit and used it for a very long time, only exception was I used the vault girl head instead of the Grafton monster outfit head.
---
Never encountered another player wearing the same outfit...
---
After I got my achievement of number of events wearing an outfit I stopped wearing it because I am now working towards the achieve of doing events in power armor but it is still my favourite outfit.
---
Before this last update,you could lose duplicates under some circumstances. At high level(500+) you were hitting those at every perk pack. Now it's not a problem anymore,but sure nobody will give lost cards back.
---
The effective options now seem to be stealthy non-PA, or PA. If you don't want to do stealth, use power armor. There are no real drawbacks other than worse stealth for most builds.
---
Also make sure you do every SBQ fight that pops up. You'll get repair kits that can be used to maintain whatever armor you end up using.
---
yep, broke right after the patch Tuesday.
---
It can swing the other way.  My first Daily Op, I joined late, and by the time I made it to the end of the Burrows the other two players had killed the boss, at 7:30. And I got the Sympto-Matic plan. 
---
First Meat Week way back when, similar thing. I got there late and only shot two squirrels and then the event completed and I got my first Tenderizer. 
---
I apologize for hoarding all the good luck.
---
Thanks, I'll craft in the morning, I have less lag and disconnects then. It was probably that and me smashing keys too fast. Appreciate the replies.
---
Realizing my unarmed weapons do shit damage now is so frustrating.
---
Lol, "rare", more like "rare to play for more than 30 min without the game crashing to destop."
---
The reason people don't do the ore is from what I remember, you get killed by the rads  too fast, so no body bothers with getting them.
---
at least 5
---
That skill is only good to scatter everything into the bushes.
---
Yep my damage is at least half of what it was prior....I cant one shot most things anymore...
---
I would have bought it if I could, but it must have been in the shop a long time ago. I've never even see it before.
---
I would like to see the looks on some players faces when they sign into this game for the first time, and realize that’s it’s not Fallout 5. It’s a pseudo-MMO that has a tremendous grind, and it’s vastly more rewarding to players who min/max their builds. Literally, the antithesis to what a casual player wants.
---
yeah, even progressing normally, it sometimes will pop up level 1-12? or wherever I am.
---
Well, thats your opinion. It’s ok. I like the new daily ops and the possibility to get some free ammo, legendaries, scrips, treasurenotes.
---
what else is to do?
---
I knew how to scrap em, just took awhile to find the cards
---
This is DupeOut 76. Nothing has any value.
---
For real? And that includes the "kill different kinds of..."?
---
When I played during release I was able to play 4 to 6 hour sessions before a crash. 
---
I know everyone’s experience is different .
---
Oooh will do, thanks
---
Its too bad that when you go to Watoga the note wasn't pinned to him. Would've been another dark and hilarious turn for this franchise.
---
Also many player vendors sell them too, all of my characters are still bugged so I cant launch at all. I love hunting down the bots so I get cards all the time and sell them at my vendor all the time....
---
Yiph been going hard on that def lep!
---
We can go back to talking about video games, but this exchange has been a pleasant surprise. Takeaway: 1) no need to antagonize people just for the lulz. 2) complain if you want, but you don't get to complain if you don't vote.
---
This is what I have and nothing about secret service has made me want to switch. I have 3 Bolstering a Vanguards and an Unyielding piece. I can run full health junkies or drop my health and do bloodied and either way I am tanky. If I'm running full health the solar will fill any missing health and if I'm low health the Bolstering and Unyielding kick in plus my perks and mutations. And with this I haven't had any problems dying more often with one wasteland. Now my melee damage on the other hand...
---
It definitely was different. Unfortunately I was one of the people who ran into problems EVERY time I tried to play it to the point that I just gave up.
---
Yeap
---
They said it themself on an interview that it was base off eso system. Unfortunately for us they half ass it 
---
But I’m still hopeful they will fix it and also wish we had eso gear system
---
That happens with everything (reloading fixer with 16 rounds left?), but happens the most with Gatling Plasma and Gatling Laser. That reload glitch has been here for a while.
---
I don't think the devs can/want to play much, based on some of the changes and the gameplay we see on devstreams. Probably just a fan. Especially since you say gamertag and it's a console name, probably made a good decade ago
---
The Spec Ops outfit is honestly my favorite one I've ever gotten. I prefer having a realistic or wasteland get up in the game. I used to do the western duster and mountain scout outfit but then I changed to bomber jacket and now spec ops outfit. I just think it looks legit. Plus my CAMP is a BoS airship so it fits the vibe.
---
Well, for fun, I put on my rifleman perks, converted my Fixer to hardened, and healed to full health and ran through Westek with rattlehands (-25% ranged damage). The level 100 super mutants there were going down with about 7-8 head shots. Not ideal but totally doable. I don't think the super mutants in the daily op had more health, or at least they shouldn't.
---
I keep forgetting to get the quest again. I already have the elder paint though so I guess there's really nothing much to gain from it. The elder chest and arms pairs nicely with the Inferno paint from NW on the rest of the body parts.
---
I know, I keep waiting for them to add them into the game with each update bit still nothing.
---
Just like there was meant to be more scout content but that's never been launched. Order of the squirrel I think it was.
---
Wild Appalachia was the best expansion in my opinion.
---
It's pretty fun but just doesn't seem all too...practical haha
---
Well I'm glad you learned some pretty valuable things just from this. But yeah, back to games.
---
Which one?
---
Gamma gatling?
---
I was specifically responding to the comment about "melee" being useless. 
---
And those extra ranks don't add all that much since the damage nerf. 
---
Buddy of mine was 2 shotting all the enemies in daily ops after popping a psychobuff and washing it down with a whiskey.  Ohk with pa as well iirc, no stealth at all.
---
Annd Vulthuryol (Dark-Overlord-Fire), That was a fun boss fight (under level, legendary difficulty, iron arrows). Pfft hmm inb4 underground winged beast boss fight sounds perfect for Fo76.
---
Don’t get me wrong I’m not saying it’s bad because it not I actually really like it, it’s just a shame it doesn’t benefit me as much as it does others but I’m not gonna look a gift horse in the mouth because it’s a fantastic addition to the game
---
I’m on PC and I could guess your name which discord are you in the Bears ? I’m assuming
---
If you dont like america then you can get out!
---
I got Hack and Slash to three star, and thought I enjoy the perk, I spent 100 points to go from 30% to 40% chance of explosion. Still cool though.
---
Couldn't the server update game state more often that it receives the data by interpolating between data points?
---
Yes!  I was just listening to it.  Can we get a metal channel on the in game radio?
---
Ironically, I have a tripwire in my base that sets off the siren, some rad emitters, a flamethrower, and an electric arc. I guess I just didn't like having two sirens in my base. Especially when the NPC's have nothing better to do than play it all day.
---
Sometimes entering an interior cell will fix this bug for me.
---
This is the most passive/aggressiv thing I've read in awhile🤣
---
I always nuked a smidge to the West of prime and it triggered Scorched Earth every time. Im surprised it doesn't work when the nukes edge is over the icon like that...
---
Magic right ball says......”My sources say no”
---
Really only takes less than an hour to get the challenges done so its no big deal. Used atoms to close off the last 5 steps last time.  Since nothing is game breaking i really don't care.  Should have put some time in between  season 1 and 2.
---
Had no idea it was connected to ops.  Been to lazy to check lol.  Thanks for the info
---
Welp back to the ESO Halloween event instead, this year they're allowing throwable bones!
---
I didn’t think the interior could have exterior enemies lol! Weird
---
A lot of players in this community have no empathy. If they don't personally experience a problem, even while many others are raising valid complaints, they would still straight up dismiss them all.
---
On the other hand, they defend Bethesda's every decision as if criticisms are personal attacks, and they just come across as fanatical fanboys with no independent thought.
---
They shouldn't hence why I was like "why do I hear wings inside here?"
---
Oh Bethesda.
---
It was a dumb change and should've been reverted with the double wall "fix" 
---
The whole system needs to be scrapped and rebuilt from the ground up, they took a lot of the issues that were present in the original fallout 4 system and just made it worse and added more restrictions, some that don't even make sense.
---
I like to build camps in existing locations, however because of that change, a lot of the houses that are broken are next to impossible to fix up. I found that you build a single foundation up one side, you could then build walls up, then add floors and the build down on the other side. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/4zHMwMc.jpg - example of one where i build up one side, and down the other to make it even, the house before hand was basically half broken. .
---
Agreed. I also wouldn’t mind if they added a guild system. That would make it way easier to help all these struggling players. Text chat and a global trade market would also help this game immensely. All we can do is hope they keep building upon the experience. So far, I think they’re doing well.
---
Oh that's weird. I've actually never had that happen on ps4
---
I was sad when I unlocked the last remaining alcohol recipe because there was no longer any reason to visit him.
---
Order of mysteries base and Biv need new life.  They are both awesome, underused assets!
---
Go legacy explosive, I one shot the map,.except level 100 Behemoth, he takes 3...
---
of course it is.
---
The opposite of love isn't hate. its indifference.
---
There is a stand up routine that says it best.
---
Person a: "I *hate* you.
---
Person b: "I don't think about you."
---
Would be nice if they did combine all that stuff into something where you get tankier in the daytime, more damage at night.
---
Would probably still be trash, but at least not flaming trash.
---
Ah I figured, just making sure! Maybe throwing in some different variations and some of the tubing stuff would help a bit, but it does already look interesting
---
but the grafton monster toesies make it the best outfit D:
---
Yeah I got trigger happy
---
We are rarer than Encryptids B)
---
An image for the books though!

THANK YOU! Wouldn't happen to have a photo would you?
---
Haha flawlessly, funny Fachnaut chugged!
---
I have a Mutant Slayer LAR that says 232 base damage and a 50cal Instigating HR at 225 (18% health Bloodied build). Pre-patch I could hit for 2k &amp; 4k respectively from Stealthed headshots but that's been roughly halved now (actual figures vary wildly) - not exactly great but at the same time I rarely struggle and still get a fair few 1 shot kills. 
---
And if I ever get Bloodied rifles I should get an average 80% boost pushing me close to the original numbers.
---
3/4 of their players!
---
That was what they had before One Wasteland. The forest was the beginner area.
---
Truly the most cursed of all years.
---
Can you get plans after you’ve already gotten all the ranks I’m a day??
---
but everyone said that it was too easy, so leave the qol perks and accept that its harder now LIKE YOU WANTED lol
---
I like to think someone was wandering the wastes after realizing they forgot their keycard, trying to shoot down the supply crate, and their nuke goes off before they get back.
---
I know, most are pretty dumb, I just use the ole standard skin. I have a high capacity mod backpack with the chally skin on it so that it’s glaringly obvious I have my loot hauling bag on and not my combat pack.
---
He’s dead?
---
I'm a mid level player and I'm actually happy with the changes. I do go through ammo a little faster, but its not like I can't just go get more. I'm not writing anyone's struggle off though. I can imagine there are people that are having it rough. But anyone that's willing to just put a little research, thought, and time into their build, would find it easy enough. I definitely like these changes, but if there are a lot of people that can't hack it, it wouldn't be the end of the world if they were reverted. To me, it seems like the issue is split down the middle, on this subreddit.
---
I always sell anything over 5 stimpaks. Way too many of those just given out like candy.
---
I would give a million (totally not counterfeit) caps to see that 😂
---
I like how the Mysterious Savior just turns into the Stranger when you're dead. He's just like, I'll avenge you bro.
---
Lights, in the same selection as the battery operated fireplace if you already have that one too.
---
"oh dear god not my TURRETS! Please launch yourself up there onto Mad Dawgs back and repair them for me!"
---
I maxed agility and got perception nd endurance to 3, melee cleave at 2 I think, though I was drunk last night so it could be max now
---
If they continue to make higher level versions of enemies they should continue to evolve their mechanics/design instead of just raising their number. 
---
Make things more interesting. I fully agree.
---
Technically it doesn't give you XP for lying down and doing nothing. The Well Rested affect gives you an increase in XP earned for a short while.
---
Expected as much.
---
Yep and yep!
---
yes  i seen a screenshot of a 2 star furious one on this sub.
---
No, im saying it be funny if they did kill him.
---
Not comparable.
---
One Tamriel was *required* because the game was splitting the player base 9 ways.
---
Also, you *do* get more powerful as you level up in One Tamriel. There is a clear sense of character progression.
---
One wasteland has replaced character progression with character regression: You get less powerful when you level up.
---
I think it's exactly **not** the same people. I think there are two pretty big distinct groups here. Before the patch, the end-game high level minmaxers were complaining there were bored. But now, it's the casuals and mid-levels complaining.
---
I don't give a crap what level my team mates are as long as they:
---
1)  Show up.
---
2)  Stand near the damn uplinks.
---
That's it!  The enemy swarms haven't been so challenging that extra firepower is needed.  Bodies for speeding things up count though!
---
My JFFR 50cal and JE Gatling do the trick and my JFSS Mole Miner Gauntlet works well enough. But my other melee weapons that used to be my fun weapons are next to useless. It takes five or six hits to kill enemies with my Sheepsquatch Club that used to one-shot almost anything. My other melee weapons are just junk now.
---
More than 20 for sure.
---
no
---
Last I heard you cannot get animated single rank cards anymore.
---
I forgot about biv.....i need to visit that drunk. He reminds me of my dad, likely why I only remember once a year.
---
Agreed they are pretty awesome.
---
RNG is wild. Just cheesed Paladin Rank in two toons to no effect! Oh well.
---
Update the mods and everything will be good.
---
consuoom
---
You’re right. Thanks for the advice, my dude!
---
Update you're perk load out manager and sfe and it will show up
---
I give people (LV3) Serendipity, Good With Salt, Super Duper, Nerd Rage, GunFu, Adrenaline, Grim Reaper's Sprint, Action Boy, and sometimes Mysterious Stranger for the lulz.
---
Which outfits you interested in?
---
Wow that’s insanely poweeful
---
Executioner's in practice works a bit like those magic heavy weapons, you see a sudden acceleration of the enemy hp bar decreasing. For most things I'd say it's a coin toss between the two effects.
---
I went with slugger because I landed two really good two-handed rolls - an instigating/swing speed super sledge and a junkies/swing speed/strength bone hammer. The sledge kills most things in one attack or power attack. The bone hammer I use for anything tougher. If you're non-PA though, unarmed is nice because with only one damage perk set there's room for blocker.
---
I've been trying out hack and slash on my two hander. I have it at rank 3 and it goes off often enough. It also seems to do great damage, possibly 100% of your attack damage (it's impossible to see the floating damage numbers, but I know it took a level 100 scorched down to half health). The problem is that there are few situations where enemies are grouped up tight enough for it to damage more than one or two. I haven't done ACP yet with that character, that's where I thought it would be most useful. You'll probably be better off with something else, like Taking One for the Team.
---
No it isn't, low level players are hilariously under equipped for the scaling mess of one wasteland! Lv 20 scorched now have more health and armor than lv 68 scorched pre patch!
---
Reminds me of the woman on the Sweet Dreams music video I listen to sometimes.
---
This game crashes more than a demolition derby. Been that way since launch, deal with it....
---
I confess, I did that last time. Didnt think about it, but your 100% rigth ! 
---
Wont happen again :)
---
It wasnt a mod. You could do it if you got close enough to the edge of cover and your character would hold his gun differently, then youd peak out of cover.
---
I think you are correct.
---
I've had a Sheepsquatch show up inside the National Radio building before.  Very odd.
---
I've been waiting for this, I want a cannible nocturnal build! Let it be viable!
---
Any of the devs that play just have regular ol' gamer tags like anyone else (they're gamers and also play other games too)
---
plus 1 strength plus 1 luck and makes you immune to earls scream in ACP
---
He's just getting the munchies for the BBQ 😂
---
Link to this trick?
---
5 days 1 reward, elder everyday, rough
---
So you can obtain level 100 without completing every single challenge daily? Because someone else on here did the math and said that you can only miss 15 challenges max (not counting the repeatable XP challenge). I don't know who to believe, but from playing other games I know that 76's season pass is very unforgiving
---
I hope Bethesda will follow the appropriate guidelines. "Let's set up a combat perk."
---
Seriously, my character is a sniper and now I have a reason to use my instigating gauss rifle going for headshots. I’ve missed this
---
💀 he can eat a whole mirelurk queen off the FEV OG
---
The most economic option I can think of is to use a different weapon for most of the Op, and use your 50 cal for the boss-- possibly softening him up beforehand.
---
I never have PA issues what version
---
It’s the load out mod. Update or remove it and try again.
---
Had a similar idea with open world hunts where players can get higher tiered weapons and armor off of them such as 4 and 5 star armor/weapons.
---
After you find the boss it becomes a event on the map players could teleport to and have a limited time to kill it before despawn.
---
This is how I played the last season, even though I didn’t take it seriously I made it into the 70s so that’s not too bad.
---
Those irradiated greens get you high as a mofo or so I've heard
---
Playing on Xbone
---
Every time I make a daily op nowadays no ones joins after waiting 5 to 10 minutes so I just solo it the entire way. Rarely has anyone joined my daily ops groups from the servers I been in.
---
Could be the time of day since I’m not on when reset happens.
---
When I join someone else’s group and go into their op that’s in progress it’s always 10+ minutes.
---
I gave mine away to one of my team members who ressed me during the op. It’s really nice but I’ll never use it.
---
Those poor billion dollar companies need to be protected! Wont you think about the shareholders's feelings?
---
So i just have a lesser experience because someone doesn't want to understand or learn the game properly? 
---
Think I'll load up the new character i have this weekend and see how much better the experience actually is.
---
I did notice that a bit, but sometimes I felt like the advantage was lost due to the enemy sometimes not realizing it was dead due to calculation delay until after I wastefully put 2 more rounds into it, plus it feels so slow at the beginning. It's definitely hard to choose because without regards to numbers it's incremental cumulative effect vs delayed time-bomb. If I can get over having to wait for the damage to feel like it's beginning to happen with Executioner, maybe it'll be an easier comparison in my mind.
---
Thank you thought they gave enemies stimp packs 😆
---
Whole heartedly agree with that first statement, the double wall fiasco is another example of them not really understanding what players genuinely want with the system. Just some more flexibility to use the game and the camp system as advertised, a fuckin sandbox. Also great tip for building into prebuilt houses, I hope they revert the changes because doing it just seems unnecessarily difficult now.
---
I got a legendary bow recently and put those explosive arrows you get from the wandering vendor and holy shit it does like 500 damage per-headshot with AOE.
---
Power armor low hp gauss minigun/gatling gun build here. When I saw the new dmg I got scared but then realized it's almost unnoticable. However that +150% ammo legendary perk is a huge gift from Bethesda
---
I think I just completed the xp challenge enough to make up the difference.  I play a lot....
---
I was finished before the last double score weekend as well, I'd have gained a lot more during that.
---
Double xp weekends help a ton.
---
I find Furious leaning more towards accuracy to really get some damage, while Executioner's is more towards quick snapshots.  But I feel both can be considered the same.  Depends on the build.
---
Spooky Meat Week!
---
Graham puts a clown outfit on to dress up as who he was in his past life for halloween.
---
Also have the displays and weapon racks show the items by name. I don’t know how many times I’ve perused a super high levels camp looking at all the weapons on the rack and said cool gat laser sure wish I knew what it was. If they showed the name &amp; description people could set up trade displays.
---
I think he said 15 days, I’m sure someone will correct me if I’m wrong. But I’m pretty sure I saw that thread and he said 15 days of challenges, and that’s not taking into account the repeatable and the double score events.
---
You're debating over two suboptimal effects so it's kind of moot in the long run. It's like having a debate as to which is better between an under ripened apple and under ripened orange.
---
The only thing that's clear is that executioners is better in event situations where you're fighting enemies with high health totals. You can get other people to do the heavy lifting to get health below 40% and then you step in and do some efficient damage.
---
However for general stuff, you can do the math.
---
Say you have 100 damage weapon and 2000 health enemy.
---
Furious: 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, 145, 145...
---
Executioners: 100 (10 times), then 150, 150, 150...
---
In the above scenario the min. number of shots to kill is:
---
* Furious: 16
---
* Executioners: 17
---
If you do a similar test for much higher health and much lower, you'll likely find executioner does better with lower health (you reach the +50% peak sooner, whereas furious ALWAYS requires 10 shots to get to its max) and the reverse for high health.
---
&gt; and that the whole game is an assist flip scam designed to milk the FO fanbase one drop at a time 
---
And yet I never hear anyone complaining about New Vegas being an asset flip for some reason.
---
Appreciate the info
---
What simple tasks are to difficult? Because I've not really noticed a change.
---
I've been dealing with enemies that spawn normally, but without AI.  They just stand there and their animations freeze when they die (and become unlootable)
---
It's creepy because the frozen animations extend to effects like being on fire...just this scorched hunched over in pain with frozen flames licking it's body...forever...
---
I dont understand, iv fired 10000 bullets with my 50 cal and i still dont need to repair it... are you running the luck perk that occationally repairs you weapon?
---
I think it will be fixed also. Seems more a bug in adventure mode
---
My strength is at 30 in power armor
---
So look into this strength perk called blocker. At rank 3 it gives 45% reduction from melee attacks. No need to actually block at all, that's just what it's called. If you can afford those 3 spots I highly recommend it.
---
It has a valid point to make!
---
Well I’ll be thank you
---
You mentioned you were a low level player. I started a brand new character with patch 22 and have had no troubles leveling up with a build that is focused around weight reduction and other quality of life perks. Without damage perks my character is able to deal anywhere from one shot (just after a weapon upgrade) to three shots (just before the next upgrade) with a hunting rifle.
---
Prior to level 15 I was keeping a supply of ammunition solely with the first rank of the Scrounger perk. Once I hit level 15 I walked my way to one of the refined .50 receiver vendors in the Savage Divide and started manufacturing .50 ammo but even then I'm collecting more resources for it than I'm burning. At last count I have sufficient to make nearly 8,000 rounds.
---
Before I built the character I was worried that the changes would be overbearing but to be honest they're not as bad as some people are making them out to be, and players who are willing to adapt to the changes should be having no troubles with them. You don't need a good build, you don't need legendaries, etc at low level.
---
I find it's usually easier to start a new team rather than join an existing one that may have done an op and never will again. As leader I will wait for all slots to be filled then jump to the waiting room, hopefully others will follow within 2 or 3 minutes - if not then why bother to join in the first place? On completion I travel to camp and wait 5-10 mins before going again. Sometimes another member will start it first and that's fine by me.
---
😂 Can't argue that. It has just been happening less frequently for me through the last couple of updates.
---
I have a new character i made, he was level 36 when the update happened. He has 4 pieces of armor that are lower than level 20 and a lazer pistol that's level 15. Sure it takes a bit more to kill something. But the experience is amazing and making so many more events mean something again. If someone is having that hard of a time playing than they should probably have planned out there character build a little more or probably don't have that much experience with character tree build and in that case should just need some practice. I remember needing to remake characters back in the day in different games because i was just learning how to character build. This game went from extraordinarily easy with no challenge to something that actually makes you think like a video game should. This update was a blessing in my opinion, but I am sorry your buddies are having a hard time. It always bums me out when my buddies don't dig a game id like them to play.
---
This season I’m gonna try to log in every night just to bust out the challenges, just get my gold star and then go to bed. I don’t know if I can afford to sacrifice an hour of sleep every night but I’m gonna try.
---
OH NO IT TAKES ME 6 SHOTS RATHER THEN 3 TO KILL SOMETHING. BETHESDA YOU HAVE RUINED THE GAME!!!!
---
Fr
---
I couldn't tell it was sarcasm until you said just because people are claiming mole rats and rad rats are murdering them as if they aren't still weak as hell so I wouldn't at all be surprised to see this and it be legit
---
The problem is that if people keep paying a high price for it, the price will remain high.
---
In the end, it doesnt affect just the 2 people involved in the transaction if that becomes the standard price.
---
All those guys with duped items buy stuff at high prices, it drives the standard up and the people who are playing it honestly have to either wait even longer for the price to normalize or suck it up and pay the high price.
---
It artificially inflates the price because of people who either cheated and dont care or people who dont have good sense and everyone suffers for it.
---
I usually give the cruddy ones away
---
Lvl 222 and run high health. I'm kinda stuck between my gauss shotguns and my. 50 cals/ gauss miniguns. Everything is primed atm. I switch out my shotgun perks for heavy gun perks for different situations. Any feedback is appreciated.

People complain about everything. We live in the age of complain. People complain about the weather, people complain about people, people complain about complains... At the end of the day this is a game, games are supposed to be fun and that's something most people forgot to. It is all about be the best, have the best weapon, the best gear, the best time, what about having fun? I love Fallout franchise and that includes F76, it's a good game, lots of things to do, it is a fun game to play. People don't have fun anymore and that goes beyond gaming. F76 has its flaws? Hell yeah, but it's playable, it's enjoyable, it's fun.
---
back in my day you had to travel to each vendor individually to sell to get the cap limit!!111!!
---
sell them in your vendor for 400-500 for weapons and about 300 for armour.
---
Same I'm just a fan of optimization so I just switched to my old build and blew threw everything but I do see a big difference in TTK and I can totally understand how non leg weaps suck butt sauce and would love some adj to help people and in all honesty I hope we get more CC added to the game to differentiate from tank, utility and dps roles.
---
Do you have room in your stash? 
---
You can store them until you can get more scrip and/or you can put them in a vendor.
---
I noticed the same too. Ended up wasting a few more rounds than I'd have liked but I caught on quick.
---
Put them in your player vendor for 10 caps/ scrip and they will fly out the door. So for weapons 50/150/400 caps and armor 30/90/240 caps. People will buy them
---
Personally Id say Toxic Valley should be like a Grafton Behemoth. A Grafton Monster that’s like the size of a Super Mutant Behemoth or bigger. The Forest should be some sort of Mothman. And I like the idea of the Mirelurk Emperor, maybe for the Mire; or it could be some hideously mutated plant beast made from irradiated Strangler Hearts.
---
I had hits that didnt register at all,i always  tap and wait but sometimes it gets ridicilous,you tap once ,then twice and the mob is like "oh wait!,i should die know" it stays there for a a sec and it drops dead.
---
FREAKING AMAZING!...... great job!
---
I got a legendary gatling gun with faster fire rate,i crank it like a model t car
---
A pedestal, How I would love that so I could show off my dog helmet my only prize &amp; joy after my TT Plasma Flamer.
---
Armor ace?
---
Nah that was herpes. Easy mistake though. To bad there's no cure... you're just all kinds of screwed.
---
Ya I hated that. They each had a cash pool of like 200 or something and you lose quite a bit of the money you get from the fast travel. Not to mention the loading screens.
---
You're absolutely right. Don't let the fanboys sway you.
---
We already have beach boys which broke the whole fallout timeline anyways so why not!  I'm all for it.
---
Thanks, I Didn’t Know Where To Actually Post This, I Don’t Really Use Reddit Like That But A Friend Suggested Asking You Guys ✌️
---
I maxed out Ammo Factory and Funky Duds. The latter is pretty much essential for bloodied builds. People were joking about molerats being a threat to bloodied builds after one wasteland, but that's wrong. The threats are, and always have been, enemies that deal poison damage. Stingwings and Radscorpions are the biggest threats at low health.
---
i am just rolling with level 1 ammo factory. that plus ammosmith and super duper is still a ton of ammo. plus i assume we’ll be seeing more ammo in vendors now. 
---
i put all my coins into take one for the team, i needed the damage.
---
HOnestly I've always wanted them to bring back unique ammo types, but that would require them to take away from the legendary effects and perks. No more Anti Armor effects or Tank Killer, instead you have to craft AP and HP rounds. I would've preferred that to be honest. We laready have legendary armor pierce effect AND perks for it, so i say just take the perks out of the game and leave the legendary effects in, so you could have a weapon that doesn't NEED to use AP rounds, but have the legendary effect be just miniscule weaker than ap rounds, and using them together is better than one or the other, but quickly has diminishing returns. 
---
Sounds simple when I say it, i'm sure the math is annoying, but at the very least i'd want the legendary effects gone and i rather craft rounds like that. AP rounds early levels into robots or super mutants would've been great. 
---
It's like the bows having plasma arrows and shit. I want incendiary rounds, explosive rounds, hollow point rounds, and armor piercing rounds outside of legendary effects, it'd feel so cool being able to craft unique ammo again.
---
Why would it break the timeline?
---
You need to equip the junkies to see the correct damage.
---
It depends on how you kill them. I have found only headshots reliably make them drop the nuclear football. Also, they don't seem to drop them in Ops.
---
Same. PS4
---
I've never seen it either honestly
---
I guess I could really talk a little more on the subject. I'd tell you more about my build but I'm bloodied and you won't be able to benefit from a lot of them. I'd suggest just sitting down and familiarizing yourself with the damage cards in particular. Glow sight is one you'll likely overlook. 3 rank perception card that gives +30% damage to glowing enemies. But just give each category a hard once over to see if your playstyle could benefit from them. I'd also point out here that the explosive perk in intelligence WILL add damage to legendary weapons with the explosive effect. 
---
After you've filled every slot you can possibly fill with more damage (because dead things don't do damage so more dps is often the best defense.) Also keep in mind swinging weapons faster or reloading weapons faster counts as adding dps. But after all that, that's when you start squeezing defense cards in. And there are tons. You can get defense in many different forms that take advantage of different playstyles. 
---
But that's just my take on things. You don't have to shoot for the most optimal build if you don't really want to. That's just how I enjoy playing.
---
Yeah it's not particularly useful, I've taken it off and will replaced with a special buff
---
You should start an insurance company
---
As an example, challenge to complete an event. I usually do powering up Poseidon, which with level 1-10, I can do that in 15-20 minutes. Now with everything equal level it almost takes the full time. 
---
I usually walk through it with my pistol and not waste precious 5.56 ammo. Don’t get me wrong I love the challenge as it makes me have to play more to my stealth build. 
---
What I do believe is that they made it so you have to play more instead of logging in, completing the challenges and logging out.
---
Have you tried showering?
---
I have
---
76 LITERALLY has the Prydwnn in it. They flipped assets that don't even get used in the game! 76 flipped assets from fo4 and brought the bugs from those assets with them! It's a comedy of errors in the highest degree!
---
Also, likely because despite flipped assets the game was GOOD (so I hear, I haven't played.)
---
Now equip the vamp and note the decrease in damage.
---
Edit: if damage is the same after equipping the vamp you prolly cured your addictions on accident.
---
I thought I’d hate this update and holy shit I fucking love it
---
They did before patch but I’m pretty sure last night I got them to drop. Gotta kill them before they explode
---
It is neato burrito. My furious ffr gauss minigun is fun.
---
My Gatling gun that kills stuff in one or two shots in ops gets back 10 to 60 ultracite ammo.
---
It’s the only gun I use in there just because of that lol.
---
It had not happened to me before the last update, and now it happens a lot.  But I'll try your solution, thanks.
---
So if you get elder right away and get a plan you won't get anymore plans for the day?
---
If you hit elder, you unlock 3 opportunities to get a rare reward. 
---
For initiate you get a very small
---
Percent chance for a rare reward. 
---
For paladin you get a decent chance to get a rare reward. 
---
And for elder you have the highest chance of getting a rare reward. 
---
But what people don’t seem to understand is that IT IS NOT guarantee that you’ll get a reward. Some players have gotten lucky and gotten 3 rare rewards, as in when they beat it in elder, they got a rare reward for each tier they did. 
---
While others, like myself included, did not get any rare rewards for all 3. 
---
You can farm special ops as often as you like. For the ammo and xp. But it’s purposely done so that you don’t have endless chances to get rare rewards. 
---
If that was the case, every single player could’ve potentially gotten all the rare plans in one day if they really wanted to.
---
I use a gauss minigun lol
---
Gotta love the absolutely archaic hit detection system that has plagued us since launch.
---
Most people forget they were new once. They don't care about the newer players and their experience, they only care about themselves and their level 500 character
---
I love my vamp gauss mini I got before patch and now I use it being I have the legendary ammo perk maxed. I have so much ammo for it now I will be using it all the time
---
I'm crushing literally everything as an unoptimized power armor build using junkies or vampires. I'm not even using max rank of any of the heavy gunner perks.
---
It's a 10 week event so whatever 10 weeks from this past Tuesday is
---
Cuz I can get elder without them and it’s unfair to my teammates and I who have already done half the thing and not hard at all to start a new instance ::0
---
Their true weakness is my Size 10 Boots to their 'nads.
---
Ouch. How much you get back? I’m figuring not much.
---
Need more songs I think, same old songs get repetitive.
---
Ahhhh down to 92. Ok my stuff up... I think. Thx mate
---
12!
---
Ive been server hopping several times and I kill the Suicider at west tek before he blows up and he doesn’t drop one. Done it several times now
---
You could sell the elder paint
---
I just googled the definition of simp, and deleted my previous comment. I shouldn't use words whose meaning I don't know.
---
As far as I know the only thing that was shared between the characters was open slots
---
I have to get a gauss shotgun
---
👌
---
Though the game has upped in challenge, it is clear that increasing enemy level range to 75 to 100 while armor and weapons remain 45-50 has created balance issues (likely intentionally). 
---
I fully expect that the next step will be to increase the top end levels of weapons and Armor to the 70-75 range, and force everybody to grind out the upgrades from their current 45-50 gear.
---
I am not sure I am complaining though ..... but I don’t like having to shoot a mole rat in the head 3 times to kill it.  That seems a bit much.
---
It still does over 1k according to videos
---
Hi Bethesda, thank you for being engaged with the community and continuing to make changes to your game I hope my feedback is able to reach you well.
---
I'm a casual player who started playing since the title arrived on GamePass last month. COVID life has been tough for me as of late, but fo76 has been a nice distraction to invest the few hours a week of personal time that I have. So much fun, that I bought a copy of the title, and decided to join Fallout 1st 10 days ago.
---
I'm currently level 32, and progressing through levels has been tough but I was able to manage progression by sticking to the lower level zones and venturing out when I'm ready to challenge myself. I was really excited to try out the new update last night, but I'm sad to report these changes break the game for me. I've gone through essentially all of my ammo, I've run out of screws to manage repairs, and I have no way to easily continue my progression. There is literally nothing in the game that isn't a bullet sponge, I tried tweaking my build with what SPECIAL cards I have but it doesn't seem to make a significant impact. 
---
I'm sad to report that I cancelled my Fallout 1st subscription this morning, I don't have time in my life to play games that don't bring me joy.  It sounds like this update brought some nice improvements for end game players, but with no way to opt-in to this extra challenge it has alienated me. I'm hoping future updates will make the game more approachable for players like me, but I will have to sit on the sideline until then.
---
10 week season, 15 Sept - 24 Nov iirc.

found this for you, not sure if you can make heads or tails of this but check it out:

---
Well, the Ash head sorta has encryptid. Heart of the Swamp features a queen... Or do you mean "nuke to summon" boss?
---
my daily op still has not reset
---
It's confusing, the junky bonus will appear on all weapons while one is equipped.
---
As much as I would love that, I'd rather get out of appalachia. Especially to Washington DC for some nostalgia in better graphics
---
You don’t need elder, I got them yesterday at 12 minutes
---
Draws them out and typically line themselves up
---
Can you only get them once a day or multiple times?
---
Angry Turtle on YouTube gave me that tip.  There's a hidden bonus of free healing, too, which was very helpful.
---
The problem is less the PA and more that unyielding is insanely OP in terms of the carry weight benefits. 
---
15 base strength + full set of unyielding is pretty much the equivalent of PA with calibrated shocks. That doesn't even factor in the backpack (high cap mod or not).
---
Unyielding is very long overdue for a nerf, and this is coming from a bloodied unyielding main. The low health really isn't that much of a loss. Even if you're at 40% health the benefit is still too good.
---
Everyone complains about the cards, but now that I see the system I see I can have level 1 legendary cards on a new character out of the vault. Some of these are real game changers like the rad one early on.
---
until the dps comes in short
---
I am one who is also over level 300 on my main right now, doing fine. After seeing all these posts about struggling, I started a new character. Level 9 now and frequently run out of ammo and sometimes end up running or hiding and then attacking again. So far haven’t died. But it is defiantly hard if you leave the forest and go to the savage divide, I was almost swarmed by level 25 ghouls and realized I don’t do much damage to them. I jumped off a cliff onto a roof and escaped. I sure miss my mutations on my main. Overall it is quite terrifying and I am enjoying every minute.
---
I know this has been asked and answered quite a bit in the past few days so maybe you can find a thread with that information
---
To be fair, that’s my weakness too.
---
And that sir is why Im hardcore and your a casual. Check urban dictionary.
---
Yeah I just got it in daily ops, thinking of hanging onto it
---
I’m not sure about that tbh
---
It's a shame that it isn't there but the simple likely answer is that there was no point fixing the event last year when a dozen patches later they coulda booted it up and found something new was broken. Odds are reworking it was on the schedule and got pushed due to the pandemic and there being bigger priorities in terms of content.
---
The theme of the current season.
