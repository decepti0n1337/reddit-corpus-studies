I dunno, and maybe this is just my wrong opinion, but bloody build is way overrated. Just way to squishy without the god rolled unyeilding gear, but still even then you are running at less than 20% health always. You have to get pigeon holed into a constant stealth sniper mode, and the moment a big event comes up like SBQ or radiation rumble you gotta completely rework your build. We still don't have skill perk sets to quick change out. As far as I know this only exist with PC mods. I just got rid of almost all the last of my bloodied weapons, and now I am glad I made that move. I was collecting junkie weapons to try that build, but if it gets nerfed too I won't bother.
---

---
I am plenty pleased with my PA-Heavy Gunner-melee/shotgun loadout I seem to have mastered and fine tuned.  I only think it's a bit fucked up how quickly I get diseases while always wearing power armor or the Chinese stealth suit. Otherwise I think its gunna be the next master build in the game if bloodied and junkies get nerf as bad as they say.

"Fallout has the nicest and most supportive community" 
---
O wait I held my breathe your a bunch of low iq noobs who love a dead franchise and a broken game, that never worked in the first place.
---
They're not talking about the assaultron in daily ops, they're talking about the assaultron in the [waste management](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Waste_Management) quest
---
The reason I went bloodied was to reduce the amount of ammo grinding I would have to do to keep my heavy guns running with good reserves but this pts change along with the legendary perks for ammo making the only thing that will change is my carry weight
---
I want smooth rum too.
---
So is claiming something happens when dozens of people are telling you it doesn’t. And there are YouTubers that have extensively tested it. 
---
You’re wrong. You’ll eventually realize that. 
---
No go shoot that video. Get your ‘proof’ and then we’ll talk.
---
Still waiting on that video.
---
... what?
---
Those are throwables? Geez, I never even tried equipping the dumb little things because they’re listed so weak! Well thanks for the unintentional notice, random internet person.
---
A further hint is to pay attention to the weapons that enemies drop as loot. Some guns have valuable modifications already on them.  I’ve sold some Assault Rifles for around 80 caps each to the vendor bots, and Gauss Rifles &amp; Radium Rifles can sell for over 100 caps.
---
Why would I help someone who's throwing shade.
---
Well if you include perk packs every 5 levels its 85 levels to max one card. 510 levels to max 6 if you include perk packs.
---
Does your controller turn off after 15-20 min? In that case you're using a charge only cable. The controller will stay on, if you use a cable that can transmit data. That way your xbox will see it as a wired controller and not as a wireless controller and won't attempt to turn it off.
---
I got no real tips on how to find out if a cable can transmit data. I just tried different ones each time and check wether on not the controller had turned off after ~20 min. If it was on then I knew it was a correct cable.
---
Using a rubber band around the right trigger prevents 76 from kicking you because you are AFK. Though you can still disconnect if the world is set to reset or the game crashes.
---
Didn’t they add a baseless green house after the initial release? Maybe they will do the same for the bunker.
---
Ultracite is(was) the most Op set in the game for that reason
---
Do like some people and make a water purifier farm and sell water. Alternatively, one thing I did as a low level was go to whitespring resort and pick up everything that wasn’t nailed down and sold it. There’s about 97 flower vases. This takes about 45 minutes to do. Alternatively, farm the cap stashes are Poseidon energy. There’s 10 on the outside of the building. Always in the same spots, although sometimes they may not spawn.
---
I dont think it's been abandoned, i think it's pretty low on their priority list though.
---
Awesome, that's still stupid. I spent like 140+ hours playing and was lvl140-ish. I could have grinded for levels instead of enjoying the game to level faster, but that's not fun and such a tiny fraction of people will ever get their cards maxed.
---
All else aside, it IS Fallout. That should be an option with everybody.
---
[removed]
---
Player vending is super good. Run all of these primal cuts events with others, kill legendaries and sell the gear, and maybe sell the junk you get too. Even if you’re low level people may buy legendaries for the scrip value. Having purified water to sell to vendors is neat too. I started the game at the junk extractor by the sunshine industrial farm and can still get by with selling screws for up to 7 a pop. Sell chems to players or vendors too! In primal cuts you can get a lot of meat or drops in general. Sell those to vendors. There’s so many caps to make, it ain’t even funny. Now get out there and rob the Appalachia blind.
---
just create a bethesda id as well.
---
Yes they said they haven’t found a fix yet. 
---
Apparently if you go to the terminal first, if may work according to some people on here. Haven’t tried yet with my new character.
---
I don’t need your help. I know what the truth is. 
---
You’re the one making unfounded claims.
---
It's the same perk spread, so yes it's cheap and easy to change between the two!
---
Most of the trap camps I see I actually find entertaining. I just don’t carry much junk on me anymore
---
I love my missile turrets ...... totally ignore 3 super mutants pew pewing my camp, but go ape shit when a level 4 radstag gently canters by....but they never fire at merchants, I went to a players camp today and a turret was shooting that smarmy professor dude, I smiled so hard when I saw that, him running away like the spineless arsehole he is, I've shot him so many times but to no avail ....just gtfo of my camp already dick head :(.
---
Bloodied builds aren't doing this, people glitching magic weapons are doing this! And they didn't even fix that!
---
You on console or pc? The patch wasn’t released on console if that’s the case.
---
Please add back home that was my favorite song was fallout 3.
---
All events are lagging right now...
---
I was on the spit and someone kept shooting at me and doing the thumbs down emote. They can kiss my ass.
---
Actually take a minute to listen to grahm. He tells you exactly what to do.
---
Plus the event runs for a full week. 
---
Plus it comes back again in September. 
---
You may be confused your first time... but you should get it after that. 
---
I agree the atlas thing is poorly executed. But this event is clear, if you just listen to the green man when he gives you instructions.
---
Did you go to the atom store’s FO1st section and click on everything there?
---
Sorry, that's my mistake. It's been so long I forgot there was a quest in there and my mind went right to the daily op that uses that location and also has an assaultron boss.
---
What seems to work for me in the mire is a scare crow and a few corn in the direction things mostly spawn from with a pair of missle turrets above and behind them. they light things up. I mean I still get a lot of damage but that lights stuff up.
---
Thank you
---
Oh that makes sense then
---
Yeah on the dot like with Fasnacht
---
How do you get sludge lung?
---
Mort or Aries they are by far my favorite people in 76
---
Perhaps. But it doesn’t mean they aren’t. Regardless, it’s still an extremely brutish trophy.
---
Thanks
---
Oh don’t forget to start an event team for a little extra bonus.
---
Are you sure they hadn't finished theirs? It only takes a minute to complete. I did one that started on time.
---
It's like being horrible drunk, trying to get something to run, you need a steady hand 😂
---
I just got back into fo76 after a long while because I saw the colossal problem event on the pts and thought it looked cool. 
---
I wanted to be specced out and ready for the job, got unyielding, already had a few bloodied weapons and levelled 30 times to accommodate the build.
---
But after seeing that if you died you respawned outside of the event, and that you die a lot with bloodied, I scratched that thought. 
---
I would like a build with consistency, and to not rely on one thing (bloodied) in the event it gets patched, nerfed or as such in the colossal problem... useless.
---
Thank god for these damage nerfs. Everyone gets to hose the boss with what they got no matter their build. Sounds awesome!
---
TLDR; bloodied felt too much of a crutch, can’t wait for damage nerfs to bring other builds on par.
---
Level 130, I haven’t figured out these builds, most of my weapons are vampire, I have a two shot prime gauss shotgun I like, may see if I can get a vampire one. Any recommendations for a vampire build besides night eyes and the night person perk? Also, I was doing the protest march event yesterday with a guy level 19 or so, now my vampire auto combat rifle can 1 shot those goons, I held back, so he could get some kills too. Having just left a prime meat event where I killed nothing because someone kept one shotting everything kind of pissed me off.
---
Yeah, I asked at each event, and hopped after confirming it didn't start.
---
No worries
---
I only do one purchase per camp...
---
MUAHAHAHAHAH
---
Wooooooooow!
---
Got lost in your youtube page. Love the camps man! What platform?
---
I was about to post this but you beat me to it! Those NPC are too scaredy cats to even be close to raid your CAMP and instead they stand all the way back shooting one bullet per second. Very annoying.
---
I either have it amonsgt all my other plans yet to be dumped to my alt or I can probably source it for ya, sitting just below caps limit and was looking for something to spend some on, might as well help out a newcomer 🤘
---
PSN: demonconfined
---
Strange, was that on PC?
---
Yeah I can see where that may raise some eyebrows in the house if they aren't privvy to the game!
---
Totally understand about not sticking to one game for super long.  I am finishing up Ghost of Tsushima on PS4 (great game) and playing FO76 and Rogue Legacy 2 on PC so I totally can appreciate juggling.  I've definitely scaled back a ton on Fallout but I've enjoyed the game enough that I want them to entice me to play, just in a bit more fun of a way consistently.
---
Yeah
---
This is why I have flamethrowers pointing at my vendors. If somebody keeps buying stuff after I have max caps I turn it on, destroy the vendors and leave.
---
I want a low chance of grahm appearing naked drunk and performing and epic dragonforce electric flaming guitar solo with Chally running on a treadmill wearing a neon pink thing to provide the power
---
I'm not the only one who used the app for FO4 am I?
---
Speaking of turrets, what is the point of the turrets even having a defense stat? Am I missing the hidden meaning behind this stat? Or is it just page filler?
---
I’m worried about some of the wanderers out here in the Wasteland. Who in the world carries around 158 burnt books and 121 burnt text books??? I think they may have been exposed to too much radiation...
---
I hate ESO prices on the marketplace. Yes eso plus is pretty good. But if you just want individual content expect to toss a lot of money at them.
---
Loot boxes, P2W, Pay to speed progress, there are so many greedy tactics used on that store that it turns me away. (Ofc I know about paying gold for crowns with players)
---
The expensive content expansions just add a new skill tree, some more skill points and new places to steal and a couple of bosses and lots of lore.
---
At least with fallout 76 I just payed once and I have all the content except cosmetics.
---
In the end I enjoy the combat of fallout over eso anytime. Eso feels like a standard MMO game you can find on the market. It does have some unique traits that makes it stand apart from most MMO but the combat does not feel that great.
---
How does anyone fail it EVEN if they have never done it? There are enough people at every event usually that i could stand around with my thumb up my ass and still complete it
---
Yeah but I don’t get locked out of new content because I’m broke.
---
No problem buddy, have a nice day
---
I put them on the "cranes treasure hunting" sign and then added my own lettering, you can also put mounted things on that sign and the backboard will hide so it actually looks like a bug is crawling on the sign
---
Well thank you so much, I just sent a friend request!
---
I've gotten 9 cleaver plans......
---
The worst part about completing is having nothing to do
---
Yeah gotta say I haven't seen the #31 at all it looks nice and unique. Number #30 I have seen variations a few times in the past.
---
Exactly my thoughts hahah
---
PS4 for FO76
---
Bethesda doesn’t know ballistics, when a 5.56 weapon is rated at higher damage than a .45 caliber weapon, you know they don’t know.
---
What am I missing with gauss shotgun? Seems like I have to hold the trigger down for several seconds to charge it, and rarely get off a second shot.
---
(Bonus if someone can explain assaultron head)
---
Grahm*
---
use this for an idea  [https://fed76.info/pricing/](https://fed76.info/pricing/)
---
I’ve seen him once but other than that it’s just been chally all by her lonesome :(
---
If you fast travel there to join the event, it gives some hint of what to do on the screen as its loading, but as a few months old player its still confusing to me. Ive figured out how to spin the meat, and drop off my prime meat, but thats it. Goes so fast ive missed rhe prime dropoff.
---
If graham gives instructions at the beginning thats news to me, ill have to look for that.
---
Check out my farm with vendors in the barn.
---
[deleted]
---
Just ran into this...
---
Just failed it 3 times in a row in the bog.  Berry mentats, ran far away to make sure we weren't missing any enemies.  There was nothing at all to shoot at but we still failed.
---
Those are great effects on the majority of weapons. You could probably reserve that for trades only, as you could get 20-30k caps or more.
---
https://fed76.info/pricing/ is a good resource for gauging prices, but don't rely on it entirely.
---
MMmmm...... Double gold barrel [50.cal](https://50.cal). would look pretty badass.
---
Yeah most definitely, fo76 releases free content. But at least the content on eso WORKS, as far as i’ve been able to tell. And they release wayyy more content.
---
The last one I was at, no one was doing anything. And these were higher level players (200+). I was dropping off chunks as fast as possible, cleaning up fires and poo and junk as I ran past them. 
---
Still failed the event.
---
I'm always so strapped for caps I've never been CLOSE to the limit. But I can totally see how this is obnoxious
---
The problem with that is pvp situations (if you ever actually have them) but easy fix is LOWERING DAMGE TO PLAYERS LIKE. SERIOUSLY WTF
---
Dude thank you so much, I have no idea how I didn't find this site already. Appreciate it!
---
Nah I’ve not fixed it that way. I think the problem is that it’s taking the blood sample on the first time which doesn’t work, and then you can’t get the blood sample back so you just don’t have one to put in
---
Don’t forget to click the other fallout 1st stuff to activate too, like the outfits.
---
I’m PC, just waiting for a patch and slowly losing patience lmao
---
yeah definitely, buying those content packs individually seems pretty silly. That’s what makes eso+ look so enticing. Hundreds of dollars of content packs + infinite crafting storage. Compared to fo76, infinite crafting storage and... a sweet tent... lol
---
I feel ya. Console here and we’re waiting for... well... anything. Meat week is a small distraction.
---
I gave up. Doing other stuff in the game. Some people found workarounds, i tried for 2 hours and just gave up
---
You can solo it, spend the minute and a half before banging a drum. Then clean up a bit to help reduce percentage loss, then it's a simple as killing critters till you have a healthy stack. Repeat cleaning up and gathering if necessary. You get luckier with some critter spawns more than others but they all bunch up in the same places.
---
Because you claim to know so much about a game thats still in beta version like almost 3 years later. It's like saying jesus knew everything about the bible before it happened.
---
I think they should just make legendary enemies drop their loot for all event participants. Only in public events, and only legendary enemies, not all enemies. Sure that means people that contribute nothing can now loot it, but hey better than what it is now.
---
Are you sure it was the tato salad?
---
I think what’s really going on is the Meat Week Sweats; the tato salad may just be incidental.
---
What I’ve discovered is Meat Week Sweats (from turning in prime meat) have a max bonus of +30HP. This totally ignores your rad levels- I was around 19%, got it, went up to 30ish, and had to rad myself down to under 10% to get back to 19%- I could tell because every time I took Rads I’d flash down to my “real” level, then quickly (not instantly, just quickly, like over 3-4 seconds) climb back up ~10%.
---
But Tato salad wearing off could totally kill you if you’re bloodied herbivore- it’s 75hp. That’s a big drop if you’re bloodied!
---
Finally,
---
This is why I like building in high up locations the game doesn't intend, no need for turrets if enemies can't see my base!
---
I'd buy that. Holy shit. Caps or trades? Like I have caps and high level plans to trade.
---
it's meant to be legendary not common as muck
---
Don’t forget some random cosmetic stuff they give for free like that love bed I seen for members ;)
---
All true and justified. For the lag I hear cutting down on notes and hollotapes can help, they sure stack up quick and linger since they dont weigh anything..
---
I sell quite a lot of ammo and it's funny when someone buys 1x5mm x3 from a stack of 18000 :P it doesn't bother me at all because we all do stuff for a quick easy score, like for instance join a group then leave instantly after taking a random photo of whatever happened to be in front of you at that particular moment :)
---
Seriously. I’m picking up poop and rotten leftovers and then picking up greens with nowhere to wash my hands in between!
---
I'm not having issues with camps on site or tents. I'm having issues with the events randomly failing, and randomly failing quite often.
---
Check and see if your controller is updated.
---
Settings, Devices and Streaming, accessories, the 3 full stops, and it should show if your firmware is up to date.
---
Try that and see if it helps
---
You evil bastard!
---
My concern is being locked to a build or having a card break after throwing 300 coins in it.
---
This. This is a simple and ideal solution. Don't get me wrong I am for the nerf as well, I just hope they balance some things out as well.
---
Yup only fix Is to store/scrap what they were placed on, if they were placed on the ground, then you're out of luck and have to move your camp,
---
What artificial damage cap are you referring too? There’s no damage cap on non pvp combat. That’s why BE pipes were so highly sought after for a long time.
---
Have a point good Sir/Madam I will be using that term in all future correspondence.
---
Not a problem! Hmu when you sign in and I'll come find ya
---
Caps preferably, PM me if you'd like.
---
B/FFR, TSE, B/E
---
What do these mean?
---
Whoever buys 10k 10mm ammo bethesda should ban.
---
It would definitely help with the headaches.
---
Becket's raider past is still taking a toll I see, he probably rewired your turrets too!
---
Not had this problem with other ally's personally.
---
Just found one! 33%vats chance +1Perception. Paid face value = 1458 caps! 👍
---
Yeah I'm definitely going to start using that as a guide to get an idea of what I got now. I know the most preferred prefixes but still don't have a firm idea of their actual worth.
---
You ever notice the majority of pictures they use in the promos of the atom shop are at Whitesprings?? Lol.
---
They need to try these things in other places and make them placeable on spots that aren't completely flat.
---
Honestly i hate when someone leaves once i get to their base, but i get it.
---
Dosen’t matter much to me this game will always demand way to much in terms of ammo grind so I’ll just be a casual with a bat
---
Wtf are you talking about?  Axe beats chainsaw no problem.  Have you ever used a chainsaw?  They very fucking fragile
---
Awesome, I just got back on and I'm in Crater, still trying to start the raider quests lol
---
Is the old man bugged? I have them all but only ever really used the two ladies besides doing Beckets quest line.
---
Accurate. Why the downvotes?...
---
I've tried reporting it to Bethesda but I've gotten nothing in return
---
Ps4 here.  There was one cookout in the 3 hrs I was on today.  Didn’t hop servers though
---
I usually go check fed76 prices and list my weapons/armor a little less. I never sell ammo bc of ammo converter (excluding power cores which I sell at 75 caps for 100%). I sell nuke keycards for 150, most bobbleheads for 75 (the crappy ones like lockpicking I sell for 50), magazines for 30,  purified water for 1, etc. I always try to go just under or at the lowest market value in hopes it sells faster.
---
so then yeah you only need to power one! wild
---
Pffft ahahahaha
---
I guess the Handmade rifle is covered than - if you got a bloodied one and got far enough in the legendary run :) 
---
A bullet-breaking-through-shield decal for anti-armor weapons would be kool
---
Doesn't cause the spawn but it does seem to encourage the aggro!
---
I uninstalled mine awhile ago and reinstalled it before wastelanders and still had all my stuff
---
Spotlights are bugged and need to be manually toggled via a switch every time anyone visits your camp as their ai just turns off till their power is cycled!
---
I would have rather had the concrete and steel donations go towards rebuilding the dam at Charleston. The BOS can get their own stuff.
---
It would have been a great community project, with the reward being the lake refilling!!
---
Thank you! I'm glad you like it!
---
Join up!! Gt:shadyrebob
---
Left over code from Fallout 4!
---
I get angry for a second, then I just think that people have lives outside of the game and there are plenty of reasons why someone would.
---
It's always good to take a break your brain can only make so much dopamine from the same game, it's just science! :P
---
My mom watched me play GTAV when I was in my old house with my ex so I doubt she would care...my dad however...ugh. Remember keep away some hidden savings in case your relationship goes to shit and you need to bail! That's all I can say from that now haha.
---
You don't need to interact with the workshop object, just hide and active the workshop with the build button.
---
I had seen variations of it as well, I just hadn't seen it as completely enclosed. But #31 was a huge challenge, so i figured no one else had either tried it or had been successful at building structures inside of it.
---
Simple fix: You get awarded a one-time, once per character, extra perk coin pack when the update goes live based on level. But not one coin per level since level 1, that's not entirely fair. It needs to be staggered. Because you spend your level-ups moving cards and specials around just account for those cards. Basically for every 100 levels of your character, you get 50 coins, starting at 100. It could go like this:
---
Level 50: 0 coins
---
Level 100: 50 coins
---
Level 150: 75 coins
---
Level 200: 100 coins
---
And so on. Then you can scrap perk cards to get more. Because we all had wasted level-ups. Hell, I wasted some last month moving points and cards to mod a melee weapon, then moving my points back. Probably 10 levels worth. That way, at level 300, you have 150 gifted coins and 100 or so coins you got from scrapping. You aren't left behind and aren't overpowered either. That's only enough to master one card, still have 5 more to go.
---
I just started playing Fo76 (level 13) but in Fallout 4 the damage scaling was so jacked that explosives were meaningless.  At a high enough level, a death claw would take a dozen FatMan rounds to kill and to do any meaningful damage, you had to be a stealth sniper with a Gauss rifle and all the critical, sneak, and rifle perks. It broke the enjoyment of the game for me.  Same went for miniguns in Fo4.  1000 rounds to take out a Yao Gui?  Piss off.  It took a long time to get that taste out of my mouth and I’m finally dipping back into Fallout.
---
I hate the people who place a camp there and cover the barrel so you can’t interact with it.
---
I know optimized bloodied if getting hit pretty hard but like if you look at energy wep's they seem to be getting hit worst then their ballistic counterparts. anyone know why? (and no saying just to nerf legacies is not the reason why.)
---
And thank you for the kind words! It's just a hobby, but i sink a ton of time into them to make them look like they do.
---
Thanks...? This was more an inquiry for details, I should've been clearer?
---
Yeah I love putting them into the big backwoods bungalow so you can shop but they're "protected" by the glass. 
---
Unfortunately with this update, I cant do that anymore BUT I made a damn blueprint and THAT works. Weird choices man
---
Yes the new level 400 player who grabs all the free stuff like a wasteland hoarder. Seen it happen alot in my vendor setup.
---
It also bugs out the enemy spawns!
---
You can also craft Chally's Greens if you have the recipe and donate those as well.
---
At least the ammo grind will be better with daily ops.
---
Then stop dying. This is to punish people who blindly charge in fights not using their brain to figure out why they are dying soo much.
---
I mean I'm not on top of it like that, I'm about 30 yards away. Close enough that my turrets can reach it
---
Thank you... have been looking on sites for about a half hour!
---
Those were the LAST thing I learned about in NV and I absolutely loved it. That Khan dirt sweep is hilarious, PLEASE make those moves work in Fo76
---
Thanks for answering could not get a straight answer!
---
I camp at a nukashine spot, so, I just pretend it is Groundhog Day. Wake up, pick the lock, do some dailies, go to sleep, log out, repeat.
---
You can door glitch/power armor glitch through doors at your camp. Any door. I usually trap the room that has the switch.
---
To each their own. I have found almost 0 of my friends who I talk to about 76 complaining about the legendary board game. There are some like me who enjoys the "work" side of the game. I love getting on daily doing my chores (scrip gold caps challenges etc). It takes me less than an hour to get all of that done. Other friends of mine go on to take screenshots. Others just run around.
---
I mention this time and time again. 76 business model isn't built on the previous iterations of fallout. It's meant to keep you coming back. The more eyes on the game daily the better chance they have at selling atoms. It's a business model and 76 is far from the first and far from the most aggressive. But 76 is a diverse games with a wide range of player types. Everyone from PvP players, casuals, RP, builders, screenshot, fanfic fall into Appalachia per day.
---
So decide what, if anything, keeps you coming back and enjoy it. Zenimax (Bethesda) is not a 501c3 non profit so expect some sort of FOMO pay model. But enjoy the fact that it doesn't preclude you from 90% of what the game offers. Simply losing some outfits and camp cosmetics we'll forget we even have.
---
Which one was full?
---
Customer support has stopped caring and seems to just lock tickets these days without response.
---
Now I did. Thanks :)
---
Id even say they cous go as far as letting then double dip for damage my adding an intelligence perk that gives them more damage/energy resist pen. It would justify it's current state of being _extremely fragile_
---
Man That sucks, But what suck to me is my emotional scarring from the death of my cat, He was almost 3 years old, he died a few months ago
---
How are you going to be locked to a build the majority of players will play all special only to get +15 in more trees. The big boys will have enough coinage to hotswap for the ammo and the lock/hack as needed.  Some may go other routes for fun and not to min/max, but be honest you and I both know most everyone will go for the optimal 30 perk points.
---
Dude that Khan move was nasty. Could make you win any fight with a ballistic fist. I loved it.
---
They're really useful if you run out of Ammo and count when killing robots with specific weapons, such as a Rifle, a Shotgun, etc.
---
Also as a Melee build, it's a useful feature.
---
They are abbreviations for legendary effects. B/FFR is bloodied with the 25% faster fire rate effect. TSE is two shot on top of explosive. B/E is bloodied with explosive rounds.
---
Just hit 100 tonight and its anti climactic.
---
Been wanting to rebuild my camp for a while now so I'll probly do that until next season.
---
Assaultrom heads are like close range snipers. Walk around fully charged and bam. Or you could hold the trigger and tap reload as fast as you can, and you got an auto assaultron head. 
---
Sniping with a gauss shotgun, people I know who use it say they use skeet shooter and longshot
---
There's no point in charging it. People have figured out a way to make it fire literally like 10 bursts in a second. It instakills you without any charging, from way far away even
---
I wish. Hundreds and hundreds scrapped. Still no automatic receiver nor silencer.
---
The problem is there isn't an endgame or even much of a base game...
---
That sucks :(
---
Lmao and it genuinely makes you feel like a dirty fighter when you take them down with it
---
Ya I’m fine with people camps there but not the ones that cover the barrel. As long as your a reasonable distance so it doesn’t affect the monsters spawns that much then it’s fine.
---
This. I realize players these days feel entitled to have everything in the game handed to them but ffs how much more explicit can the instructions get. Graham literally explains every last thing every single time.
---
To be honest it doesn't LOOK anything other than a fence with a few spots of paint flaking off it. It says "communist fence" when you repair it, but it looks right in my Free States (kind of) themed camp. Well worth it.
---
My view - give it an innate scorched killer’s effect.
---
I find myself doing this often. That; and repairing all the broken turrets at people's camps when I happen to be shopping.
---
No. Those are coming with Patch 22. This was pulled from today's PTS update.
---
What does that have to do with anything?
---
Yes. I mean if I knew why it was failing surely I'd be using countermeasures and I wouldn't be posting this? Not trying to be funny, it was simply failing without any clues as to why. People can speculate, but it's clearly a bug and I have no idea what was causing it.
---
It means you don't need to be within range of those turrets. And as soon as you take it they will be your turrets!
---
Wow, and I just wanted to buy some plans.   lol
---
Bloody unarmed. I’ve been loving my tomahawks, looking for that throwable quill plan, but I had no idea about this one. I love throwables.
---
Finally, someone with the guts to help.
---
(Maybe allow Ward to just stare at you the whole time as well.)
---
So that's the thing that kills me all the time.
---
Did you find anything?
---
I feel like they were working better for awhile (after wastelanders), and now they won't shoot mole rats right in front of them
---
Everyone rushes the prime boss and ignores the other enemies, even after the prime boss dies, I ignore the prime boss now and try to rush and kill everything else they ignore...
---
I surprisingly have that plan unlocked.  Holy crap, you need Squatch's Quills to craft.
---
Great question!
---
I'd pay those bastards whatever they want for NV Perk/Skill/Special system, service Rifle, antimaterial rifle, etc etc. They highly underestimate how much we simp for NV.
---
Yeah... but I hear they’re fantastic weapons, and I run a lot of Free Range so I keep a steady stock.
---
I'm 250 and get 3-5 levels my few hours after playing. Boost your intel.
---
Is this why my bloodied character gets one hit killed by every single prime mob? I personally think it sucks.
---
I've had a few Primal Meat fails today with no one camped nearby. One in the Ash Heap and twice in the Mire. The "dangerous prime beast" came and was killed, and nothing else after it, but the progress said to "defeat the final wave" until it timed out.b
---
My thoughts were that with mole rats always being in attendance, as well as radscorpions in the Ash Heap, if something stays underground for too long the event times out.
---
Legendary perk slots are account wide, the cards/loadout are separate for each character.
---
I rarely see that event pop up, even if I were in a private server.
---
But then I wouldn't see her sweet ass in the Chinese SS walking about my camp, she's got the helmet on too coz like she be ugly innit.
---
I failed a handful last go around but for the most part it’s super easy once people get the hang of it. If people are still failing in another day or 2 I will be shocked.
---
I think he says it if you arrive beforehand and hang out. He talks to Chally and himself the whole time.
---
Oh, I usually get loot, but not if the queen goes down within 30 seconds. I use faster-fire or explosive gatling guns when she's in the air and either a furious faster-fire gat plasma or a vampire's faster-fire gauss minigun when she lands.
---
Idk That what rads seems mighty enticing to me for full hp builds never having to worry about rads again. 
---
Well not having to bother with it to be more specific.
---
But I suppose sun kissed could replace it.
---
Grahm's idle dialogue spits out at random intervals, can be triggered by other players, and sometimes includes helpful hints as "to meat cook, cook meat."
---
The concerns of the OP are pretty valid when it comes to Meat Week. The return of Fashnacht was a really enjoyable time, the return to Meat Week was full of confused new players.
---
You don't spend a lot of time pvping in workshops. Can't progress the bar just hiding if the other guy is in the circle. 
---
In the end workshop turrets are a nuisance more than anything but it's an annoying one and no reason for turrets to be so effective.
---
I don't care if camp turrets were buffed just not workshops.
---
Nah, chainsaws are too heavy for my stick arms lmao
---
Yup you just have to chase them, from what I've seen Toxic Valley is easiest to solo as there isn't even a boss monster!
---
Honestly I feel like all of the caps on everything is just freaking stupid.
---
Thank you for this information. I can die happy now.
---
Turrets are completely useless garbage in this game and they just attract more creatures to your camp. I had 6 turrets on posts and a scarecrow to aim aggro away and there still useless
---
I couldn't care less about Adventure mode pvp personally, I just use them to complete dailies/weeklies and to occasionally gather scrap. If I want PvP I'll go into nuclear winter where nobody gets an unfair advantage.
---
Yea its annoying at times. I almost wish there was some sort of fast respawn where it would be like 10-20 caps to bypass the timer
---
Edit: holy crap it my cake day!
---
Then why comment on workshops?
---
Just because there are some OP builds doesn't mean you have to use them. Your 3 friends who gave up might've had a lot of fun if they stuck with a normal build. The game is easy enough, you don't need to 1-shot everything.
---
Fair enough that makes sense. Wasn't complaining I just thought it was a bug. Ty
---
From what I heard you have to spend one perk coin to swap the card out
---
Gonna be on in aprox. two hours?
---
It’s a fence. It’s only “communist” because that’s what it’s labeled. It’s like saying the 10mm is the most capitalistic weapon in game just because it can have the American tricentennial paint on it.
---
Because I was offering an alternative as I was assuming you were being taken out by the turrets because you tried capturing at the workshop object, not that you were trying to attack a well prepared player.
---
I’ve given up on turrets all together. I’ve tried every one there is and all they do is get destroyed. They take too much budget to use!
---
This auto-complete bug has screwed me twice now. Including today for double rewards. There should be some kind of payback. If I don’t make it to level 100, a big reason will be the autocomplete issue.
---
Fair enough, be safe out there in the wasteland
---
Definitely not. The fo4 app was so awesome!
---
Yes you don't know how badly it angered me Charleston got destroyed by a fucking lame ass raider
---
I keep seeing these kinda threads lately and I agree we do need some better hard mobs that take 2-4 people to kill, I'm so bored of blasting everything that comes my way into a million pieces.....but yeah bigger legionaries please Beth coz I need my 1 star rolling pin dammit.
---
I have the bundle. I think the power armor and bunker are cool. Some things mess up like it’s hard to get fence to look good I hear. I have not tried using it yet being I am all the way up top left of map above lumber yard. So where I put camp I’m in a valley so prob not ideal for a fence. I think just to get most out of the bundle I will be moving to a new site.  But like other person said, the fence don’t really look anything other then a fence.
---
It’s got a red band on the sides but it’s hardly noticeable. It seems to fit any camp really. They could have just called it a fence.
---
I hate to break it to you, but this update isn’t going to fix that. If someone is burning her that fast it is either because of injected or magic weapons. Do you play on PC or console?
---
Hopefully changing the shishkebab damage type doesn't break friendly fire, because that is the main purpose of the shishkebab, to cauterize wounds of friendly npcs and to spot weld friendly robots!
---
Keep spin meat, keep collect wood, keep clean dirty Chally piles!
---
Chally love feed that humans brought. Look how happy Chally is. Both heads smiling!
---
You need SOME protection from rads. People usually go from 1000 to 0, but a set of Marine/trapper or the leaded backpack (or some legendary pieces with the effect) can make your life easier. 
---
Endgame items, like the Chinese stealth suit or a full set of Secret Service armor just solve the problem.
---
Explosive ammo should.also be rare.
---
I've noticed that I die easily if I'm getting melee attacked, I even have a full set of ss armor almost fully upgraded
---
Agreed. Nothing like a 30 second countdown after being insta-killed by the imposter only to find out it’s been killed and now you can’t respawn at all without reloading the game.
---
Edit: should say AT the imposter event. There’s been times where I just fell over dead and nothing had even hit me. And no, I wasn’t a conduit either.
---
   It would be nice not have to invest nine points for your primary weapon. You don't have nine points on your rifleman, sorry buddy. Your bullets do less damage...somehow. 
---
   As a bloodied build, I have no problem with taking a nerf. As long as other game mechanics get fixed, wether that be the wonky hit boxes on enemies or the viability of other builds aside from the bloody ghoul and the crack head. In any game, their will always be top tier builds and their will be everything else. But, the everything else should be viable in some way or form.
---
   One should not have to rely on what is meta to compete. Gods forbid you are a hybrid build, stray away from the cookie cutter and you are taking a hit somewhere. Am I saying it is unplayable, from experience I can say no. As much as I love running in and smacking shit with a sword, 76 takes place in a world with guns and farting bat dragons.
---
It’s been less than two years. 
---
Other people have tested this. Reliable people. On video.
---
You are neither reliable nor have you tested this under video. 
---
Until you do that, you have no proof, and I don’t believe you.
---
It's amazing how many of my friends think they have to interact with the workshop object so I just assumed.
---
He takes a lot of firepower, even more in the PTS with the damage nerf.
---
As a former long time player of ESO, you will soon see that it too has bugs. Check the official forums, and you'll see. Sure, some of it is whining, but some are legitimate concerns that have been around fot a long time. Don't expect the grass to be greener is all I'm saying. ESO has it's own glitches and bugs.
---
I'm a civie I use clips
---
I found and scrapped several before joining Reddit and learning about them. I can't tell if it was a coincidence, but I got at least three from Government Requisition holotapes, and two from collision course (event at the airport).
---
So, cargo drops. No doubt about it.
---
all because everyone needs to be either a dog person and a cat person for some reason. I call myself both because they’re both great. I can be entertained petting a dog for hours, and I can be entertained petting a cat for hours as well
---
&gt; Perhaps. But it doesn’t mean they aren’t
---
For the twitching? No but us killing it in the first place to cut off their heads for the trophy means they aren't alive though.
---
I just had to chase a rad toad so far my raider daily popped up. Got it, but the event still failed.
---
Yeah. I'm stuck on a low levelled character because my first character has a totally messed up build. Plus my girlfriend wanted to play it so I've been levelling with her and we've just hit a stump ngl
---
It’s basic marketing. Undercutting others tend to bring more people to the more reasonable and affordable purchases. Something people won’t regret buying. I’ve done this for so long and have been steady on caps. It’s a great way to go around Appalachia, be there to help others make their gaming sessions easy with affordable items to help them progress further. I have free water and food at my camp as well as everything being open. Never understood locking doors in the camp. It’s gotten to the point where there’s no need for caps for me anymore, besides fast travel. 
---
Plus, legendary run does supply you with a decent sum of caps.
---
I think I got the first transaction backwards.
---
Not 100% sure but I think it messes with some of the creature spawns occasionally. Did one earlier where someone had their camp in the cow pond and it moved the honey beast spawns all the way down to site alpha.
---
Yep, today lagging was really bad so I went to a private server and still had lag.  I managed to complete an event but was really disorienting.
---
Same brother.
---
They are both Incredible animals and super cute when paired together
---
15-18?they must have been forest asylum dresses
---
Except that's the argument I was making to begin with. The challenges. There's your content in a fallout game now, log in daily join a public team to make the grind easier and shoot to earn points. As soon as you realize that this is all filler in order to keep you preoccupied until they make any real meaningful content, you'll see the point.
---
I dunno if you were around since day one but after a while of playing the same you start seeing the flaw. The actual stuff to do in the game is still not much. And believe you me I tried it all. Doing stuff in a game shouldn't feel like a chore and after a while... it does in this case, no matter how optimistic you are about it.
---
Above all this is the other games I'd rather be playing or trying out, especially the newer ones coming out. Like I said, summer is limited as-is and I'd rather spend my free time wisely. You spent 2 months playing a game that you clearly enjoy and that's good for you, but I'm done with it and it's boring loop.
---
The fact the SBQ has been survive able for me since LVL 15 is a joke.
---
I am guilty of this every night. I’m thinking of selling ammo just to help others get this daily.
---
I heard that if you swap to a private server it’ll complete like normal. If you don’t have 1st ask around someone will likely let you borrow time on a private server long enough to complete it.
---
Alien Blaster would be still weak with a 100% damage increase.  The fact that the thing have bullet fly time does not help, too.
---
Sorry stingy dude,I prefer the wealthy people that buy 3 99 caps plans at my vendor
---
I don’t think you have to go to the boathouse. Just go to Poseidon, kill the guy and return to Meg
---
The timer should be more generous to account for enemy stupidity, but this is a Bethesda game so... stupid is kind of a feature.
---
Ooh
---
I think there is nothing you could do to honor your cat more than reducing digital molerats to bloody chunks in her name. Long live the memory of Phoebe! May molerat bits shower her in Valhalla!
---
Rockin post, I've tried developing my own play style across 5 different characters since launch, but they start losing their viability late game, leading to me quitting, making a new one and repeating the process because tracking down 5 unyielding wooden armor scraps and an unused steam gift card didn't sound very appealing!
---
My hope is that with this damage change comes changes that make these other play styles that I cobbled together with pixie sticks and glue more viable, more fun, and more predictable instead of pelting a grizzly bear 24 times with a maxed out hunting rifle and not killing it because I wasn't wearing the magical platinum sneakers with the +48.5% damage bonus during the lunar eclipse.
---
Npcs attacking camps in general is kinda dumb, I mean you got a scorched running out of a town full of lights right past a built in generator with a fusion core in it to come smash my razorgrain I have planted 1/4 mile away its just dumb. I would understand them attacking things like a generator or lights so to make them destroy cheaper things is nice but makes it weird. And they don't attack anything else why my camp
---
How awesome would be to see a collaborative effort against the SBQ, with a bunch of dude bros pelting heat seeking rockets at it for maximum efficiency!
---
There’s a bookstore in Summerville that you can get over 300 books. This server 2 purposes. You can use them and some acid to create a lot of gunpowder, or picking them all up clears your object spawn table so you can pickup things you really need in other areas.
---
It is a great weapon (I have maybe too many of them) but you can achieve similar results with some other not-so-hard-to-get weapons, like a furious handmade, furious combat rifle, etc. 
---
The important element is to know it is good for a COMMANDO build, but meh if you go rifleman.
---
*applaudes
---
Yessss thank you!!
---
Same. Most of my perks are just for increasing carry weight lol
---
That's the way to have the most fun man. The best part to me about the multiplayer in the game is checking out other people's houses, selling stuff, and having a blast with people in events.
---
Why do ya think McDonald’s is one of the biggest kings in the fast food industry? 😉
---
if they *always* fail for you then that sucks but today i've only had maybe 2 out of 20 or so fail because of no reason.
---
I think we all get burned.
---
I feel your pain.
---
Numb nuts that i am i put all my serums in a Vendor in one go cost me nearly 7,000 caps.
---
These days i drip feed my vendors,maximum 2 serums at a time.
---
And 1 high value item and the others 2 stars.
---
Also had to lock my water aquifers.
---
I left them open for low levels..
---
But someone was farming them.I know this for a fact because i went down to 8 water from 3 aquifers.Normally i have so much of the stuff i have to sell it regularly.Some savvy players out there. Probably some one who had me as friend making frequent visits.Raiders gonna raid i suppose.
---
I love Fallout and normally I ignore the small things and praise Bethesda but the player vendor cap limit is absolutely stupid!! Who's boneheaded idea was it to add a vendor cap limit without a vendor shutoff.  The entire concept of a cap limit on the player vendors is stupid to begin with because it doesn't benefit the community.  Adding the cap doesn't help the economy by giving something for players to spend caps on removing the total volume of caps from circulation.  We actually do infact need something to spend our caps on end game to help the economy but that's a different thread.  And adding a vendor cap limit without a shutoff is a complete brain fart because it's not realistic to have all those caps and in effect product literally disappear.  Bethesda owes OP an apology at least and they definitely need to fix this asap!
---
I was only able to attend one cookout in 3 hrs playtime today (only one showed). So I’m sitting on about 18-19 prime cuts.... just rotting
---
The only problem I’ve encountered is when I travel to a still active event after we succeed in completing a harder difficulty and it says “defeat the final hordes” and nothing shows as the timer clicks down.
---
Other than that the actual event goes by within like under 2 minutes ion PS4 servers
---
I don't know what it is, i always get to the end and kill everything sometimes with up to 2 minutes to go and then sit there for the remainder of the time until it eventually timed out. That it just fails with 6 minutes left cause fuck me lol
---
I’ve seen a 1* Bloodied one.
---
What's the difference between someone who's afk and drumming and someone who's not afk and drumming?
---
Flare gun too.
---
Save your stuff and take a break, come back for patch 22.
---
I wouldn’t say that for sure. If Colossusi had, say, ghoulish somehow or another way to regenerate, he could possibly be alive still. It would certainly explain why Earle is still alive after we’ve killed him so many time.
---
Yeah I'm getting that except I get to do the entire event from the start and waste a ton of bullets
---
When is it coming to console? I’ve got a few characters I don’t use anymore thqt I wana squeeze
---
Im level 550. Double yours and double your requirement to level up and I don’t feel like playing hours
---
Aye. Every now and then i've found a random enemy miles away which was preventing completion
---
Once I failed because there was a random fog crawler literally in watoga so..yeah..
---
Man that sucks! Terrible luck!!
---
Nice Fahrenheit 451 reference!
---
That would be my kind of repeatable quest.  Like cleanse the commonwealth,  but there's an actual random boss pertinent to the faction leading the mobs in the area. 
---
Also,  why do so many people hate Beckett? Him and Rose are my two favorites by far.
---
I could see what rads being used by none PA full health builds but that is kind of a minority of what I have seen. I guess losing 5 usables in an undesirable special wouldn't be too terrible.   
---
Personally on my main I plan to go 15/ 5 /15 /6 /15 /15 /15 gets me some QoL perks and allows my bloodied build to go to 15 endurance without sacrificing elsewhere.
---
Atomic leaks?
---
When the event breaks it's either there was supposed to be more enemies spawned that didn't but the server is waiting for you to kill them or it doesn't register the kill on what you need to complete.
---
Probably.  You can add me and hop on whenever bud!
---
&gt; If Colossusi had, say, ghoulish somehow or another way to regenerate, he could possibly be alive still.
---
But he doesn't. So can we not?
---
&gt; It would certainly explain why Earle is still alive after we’ve killed him so many time.
---
We're not going there.
---
Cool idea, but two shot would look very stupid with some weapons (fat man).
---
Also, I’d think they could only do this for primary effects - otherwise, it would probably cause a significant amount of problems/way too many skins.
---
Embrace your freedom
---
I love my lmg
---
That's my guess too, however the Commie Salute has been in the game files since Nuclear Winter launched.
---
There was even a bug that unlocked it for everyone, however it had no graphic, so you could do the salute (which had the same animation as all other salute emotes), but the emote icon would not be visible.
---
My problem is when a trader comes up the stairs.
---
WW3 erupts gun turrets,Missile turrets,shotgun Turrets go crazy.
---
They fire on the Trader.
---
Then they turn on each other.
---
The only way to stop the mayhem is store them all until the trader fucks off.
---
I played for 2 months when it first came out and got to lvl 50 then stopped as there wasn't much more to keep me playing then I picked it up when wastlelanders came out and I'm now lvl 140, it takes awhile to get into just need to keep at it, i would suggest looking at the perks instead of getting random good ones focus on a certain build and get all perks that will help you optimize that build
---
We all do, but I think they should be more convenient.
---
Yes. Add in all the areas. The potential to upgradr the fun is there
---
Level 62 here. I play max 15 hours a week. Took me 2 months to get to where I am. I see these level 300s killing everything in one second every time I try to participate in an event. So I just stopped pretending this is a multi-player game. The only interaction I have now is at peoples camps and them buying from me. 
---
The legendary run is a big LOL and ill be happy with where I end up because I do quest lines and find random things to do, not grind.
---
It took a while but I put this game into perspective of what I wanted it to be and not what it has become
---
“Ugh, a mini nuclear bomb... I’ll stick with this black powder rifle.”
---
Is there even really a point to doing the Primal Cuts besides a farming opportunity? This is my first meat week and I had assumed the Prime Meat was used to fill the meter in the Meat Cook event. I only learned last night after looking up something else that it doesnt count there. All it does is give the meat sweats buff of a certain level depending on donation and that buff only lasts 15 minutes. It takes 3 or 4 Primal Cuts events to accumulate enough Prime Meat to get max level for a 15 minute 5% xp buff. Im not sure the effort to reward ration is worth it honestly. Change my mind
---
If like a guy last night your base is sitting on the barrel YES your messing things up! But having it near by out of gun turret range it actually helps for workbenches selling ammo or mats to make it
---
Name that gun
---
Do you go to the Ash Heap location a lot? In my experience that one fails about half the time because crickets in wave 1 get stuck on the other side of the hill or burrowing critters get lost.
---
I haven't had any other locations fail (yet.)
---
Have you seen it ingame, it’s literally got red and green painted on it. Know what you’re talking about before you leave a comment
---
Let's get a moooove on
---
Fed76, it'll give you a rough estimate for pricing (:
---
The ash heap failed 100% last night for me not one finished right though we killed everything
---
Yeah it does it. But if I remember correctly the tag disappears after exiting zoom, or perhaps switching weapon
---
Isn't its prices based on pc markets
---
I have it fail most often in savage divide, but everywhere has failed for me
---
Thats why i have a year sub to not worry about each month
---
Phoebe, and Lola, are lazing in the Sunshine of God eternal garden
---
Yeah I want to see things like armor pen or dps! Plus it'd be nice to know when a certain effect is capped so we don't get diminishing returns by stacking too many extra
---
This event is not bugged because of camps or tents but Bethesda's crappy devs - this is the same spawn/pathing issue that existed in Faschnat and they had all the time in the world to fix it. They have a central point and multiple radial spawn points if one is blocked any good dev would have just moved to another spawn point.
---
Prolly a lot honestly.
---
This. I don't even bother with the ash heap anymore. Got dumped from the server 3 times, required complete game restart. The bog is the only one I do now
---
Shotgun turrets my friend.  Shotgun turrets will shred every enemy.  I only have four at a choke point to the entrance to my camp.  None shall pass.  In fact I always smile when I’m in my workshop tinkering, and majestic sounds of four shotgun turrets firing faster than a machine turret.  The smile is me knowing that whatever was there, is no more
---
That's a big Hammer.
---
Haven’t been turning in prime meat I’m too lazy lol
---
A bit unrelated but my turrets target the traveling merchants and NPCs from ally quests. It’s so annoying while you’re trading or talking and turrets just shower them with bullets.
---
Not upset. Congrats though. Looking good.
---
Do you realize how long we've been sitting with garbage explosive weapons?
---
Other night on Xbox we fought queen twice and colossus 3 times. I have a magic junkies mini which I rarely use. I had 15k 5mm saved being it’s so easy to find. The first queen fight was easy and first colossus was too. First colossus no one showed up even with me waving them over. But he got stuck in trees in the grove and rarely any wendigo spawns came. So I could just aim at head and take him down. Next one was later on I went down and there where super mutants cleared them out and went on with my business. I check every ten minutes to see if anyone is down there to know if I should check. Well I went down and one player had him out near the other fissure site closer to watoga. He was harder this time. At one point we both died and he almost ran back to the grove and his health went back up. I put my Chinese stealth on and kept picking at him. I had to lure him over to watoga being the other player kept dying and I didn’t wanna lose what work we did. I got him over to train station the bots helped a little and another player finally joined and we took him down. After that a player launched another nuke this time we had six minutes left and half her health left being she barely landed. I broke big daddy out and we finished with a minute left. Walked over to grove and again fought that.  It was best night I had
---
I believe they recently did more to balance it across platforms. But also try the marketplace for quotes. I think it’s a trades only type item, depending on other effects.
---
Keep trying to justify your beliefs like anyone else cares.
---
It's possible your turrets are attracting mole rats that tunnel over and get missed and that could cause a failure if your turret fails to take them out.
---
If you played ESO Public Dungeons,  its basically like that. In one team theres a higher level and and lower level players, but has a scaled damaged to all monsters depending on your level so that there will be an equal distribution of labor work to finish that dungeon. If you'll join in a public dungeon with your 600 cp character, you'll find a team with a level 35, 50 and 75 in your team, and everyone can participate well inside the dungeon. I think that's how will One Wasteland want to adapt.
---
I’ll be damned, I just learned something new. I know exactly where you’re talking about and I must admit, that would be a pretty good/quick way to refresh the spawn table. I’ll definitely keep this in mind since my camp is directly south of Summerville. Thanks for the info!
---
I was in a group with my friend who has been OGLING over that weapon...I saw it dropped on the reward screen and walked up to him and equipped it and he let out a Vader "Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo" lol  
---
Also, thank you!
---
It's pretty...beefy...
---
Really? I completed It like 2 weeks ago and i feel really annoyed
---
The end game is grind, grind, grind and more grind. Most people agree there needed to be a nerf to bring balance to the game but this nerf is stupid. It went way to far and was all inclusive so now the only viable builds are bloody and junkie. And lets be real here giving their track record with this game so far dose any one believe that Bethesda could do a comprehensive  re-balance  to the damage model and not introduce more bugs and more grind. Fix the game and add meaningful content with a story should be their top priority. That would stop some of the hate for the nerf. We all hope Bethesda wont screw this up but chances are...
---
That’s too bad because I’m too busy vibing on the drums with the boys.
---
Nope
---
As a Melee Build, I have a mighty need.
---
I am not mistaken, I am in denial! 😤
---
Asking for clear instructions = entitlement? Careful...your arrogance is showing.
---
What part is supposed to upset me?
---
Celebrate Meat Week

What ‘belief’?  That you haven’t provided any proof?
---
That’s not a ‘belief’. That’s a fact.
---
I thought the helmet is what gave it the voice?
---
I loved fasnacht. That was more of a reference for limited events.
---
That is at least, is a semi-rationale response.
---
Not sure if you are joking or not but if you are totally Hilarious!!!!! if you are not then don't worry you will get rich one day!
---
Why do people keep dropping nukes on the mine?
---
I'll have to try this. Thanks
---
\*\*Shrugs\*\* No idea, a friend I played with was really upset with my lucky drops  
---
Backpack, Melee and Hat  
---
Maybe these are common items, not sure, but he told me I was lucky
---
15 scrip an hour? Thats amazing. And it *does* fill up the bar and it is damn nice not to have to eat all day.
---
They’d probably just end of locking NW rewards to the character instead.
---
You should get "The importance of communication" quest on the alternate days for the raiders as well
---
It happens. Hence the post
---
Do all the things you've been putting off: Clean out your stash, restock vending machines, shop for plans you don't have, etc.
---
I was doing Primal Cuts in the bog and someone nearby at the Bogtown workshop had an ammo farm going. Wtf...
---
It’s always kinda off on higher tier items
---
Maybe take a much needed break. I know when I finished it about a week ago I was burnt the f out. It’s nice to take a little breather and enjoy meat week.
---
2 yellow 2 forest
---
Don't use Fed76. The dev openly admitted that they don't go off what the average price is. They used a bias sample of the maximal price that people will charge for it.
---
... I can't argue with this post.
---
I've voiced annoyance with this nerf because I heard you can't even hit the current high points of DPS with legendary perks.
---
But I can't see how it surprises people, though.  The dominance of bloodied couldn't last forever.  
---
What did surprise me was that it hits every other build, too.  I would have rather just seen a nerf on bloodied and some boosts to other builds.
---
I don't even run bloodied or junkie's, just stealth crit-spam and good with salt.  Maybe this will make my build a little better.
---
If you need more lead from lucky hole, this works well. When you load into Summerville I believe it’s the first house on the right when walking into town. It’s a multicoloured house with a green porch/red posts.
---
The issue from Respec is where I'm at. I've played ONE character this whole time, so I've moved shit around. Am I at a huge loss cause of that?
---
It isn't on consoles yet
---
Aw man :/ thank you very much
---
If anyone wants to play rn let me know!!
---
Well dont drop it, take off the paint and then drop it so itll still be there for you. But, why would you drop it
---
It is stuck on the power armor chassis and I cant take it off the armor
---
Radiation rumble 3 star ghouls are all lvl 40s.
---
Or the picture daily quest you can grab at the overseers house. You can exchange photos to the raiders or the settlers for rep
---
Ammo count is how I determine what camps to visit,  arrows are hard to find.
---
Ohhhh, yeah then just take the paint off and move it, it's annoying as hell but itll save your mods atleast
---
The fire pit &amp; drum should be used in the 2 minute wait period as it helps with the progress, but as soon as the event starts then you should get off &amp; do the normal collection tasks. I've seen 4 fail as well :(
---
It should return to your inventory by itself, after very short time.
---
OP if you read this- Well said. Well delivered. 
---
Thank you!
---

😂
---
Just got online bro
---
Yep, I know where the house is and a refresh of Lucky Hole mine for lead is exactly what I was thinking about. It might also be worth pointing out for anyone else reading this, there is another bookshelf with a lot of books at the Overseers house upstairs in the hallway if you need it.
---
No worries, I got the flux earlier thanks though
---
The game has been out for almost two years now.  How many meta switchups have we had?  How many builds have become entirely unworkable?  You still see people running around using the same weapons with the same builds as a year ago or even later.
---
Even after the upcoming damage changes there shouldn't even be that much of a change considering everything got knocked down roughly the same peg.
---
Even then, what meta?  The "kill the SBQ in one minute" meta?  it's not like the vast majority of the game actually requires a "meta" build to do anything.
---
\*buys your .308\*
---
silenced energy wep is the idea of my dreams
---
Maybe just spend your caps?
---
If the very last enemy is outside. You can kill them outside the zone just dont kill the very last enemy of wave 4 outside the zone. This is just my assumption based on failed events and passing events.
---
Ok sounds good.sorry couldn't vone through earlier
---
I put part of my camp underground at a cemetery and put her there so when you walk around you hear a disembodied voice talking about nightmares.
---
Moo
---
Its all good
---
Karma at its finest ladies and gentlemen
---
..........
---
The info I read said it doesnt. So I dont know if it was incorrect or old and its changed. If it does indeed fill the bar then Ill keep adding it. And you make a good point about the scrip etc. I forgot about that part of it. Ill likely keep doing the one in the savage divide at least because its a good source of springs acid and adhesive if nothing else. Plus I got close to maxxing out my daily caps just from selling the meat and other stuff i picked up lying around
---
I have no problem with people doing this but I prefer to either find plans I need, a magazine or bobblehead I'm missing from my collection, or a cheap known plan I just resell.
---
The only complaint is that its a glitch that they will eventually patch when this is how all shotguns should work!
---
So 75 lvls to rank 1 legendary perk to max? That seems fair to me.
---
Right.  Biggest issue is they just took an axe to everything and nerfed everything.  All that means is everything does less damage, but bloodied/junkies are still king and now even MORE powerful relatively since not using those builds means you do even less damage then you do currently not using those builds.
---
Honestly, people on fire pits and drums aren’t the problem. People running around like chickens, that maybe to YOU appear like they are doing something but actually are just running around, shooting at players or dropping grenades cause they find that fun etc. you’d be surprised how many times I have seen event fail with 4 people there and all of them were running around but not actually doing anything, I was the only one cleaning up, picking greens and depositing critters. 
---
Assuming positive intent that some people just don t know, event though it’s pretty much common sense. But I find it hard to believe that levels 600-800 don’t know what to do 🤷‍♂️😑.
---
PS: the times that event did fail, no one was on drums or spits. Everyone just running around wasting time and fooling around. And playing that dumb moth man 1st sub dance emote 😑
---
Supporters of the nerf forget the one thing that matters: it's going to be THAT much harder to finish the next season pass now that everything will take longer to kill
---
Level 400+ characters not withstanding for the level up daily.  I mostly was intentionally underestimating the time needed because the people I am responding to are claiming it's super easy and quick.
---
I hate it all.
---
And headless scorched!
---
The true prize should be the realization that you didn't have to work as hard as you did in the first place.  You've still got weeks to spare... that means you could have slacked off for all that time worth of daily challenges and weekly challenges and bonus challenges and double score points and still finished in time and gotten all the rewards.
---
You were never really at risk of not finishing the season to begin with, it was all in your head.
---
Some guy was running in circles at challys feed stack, so i slow but surely nudged him into the lake under the event.
---
Yep, seems like so. If they were to scrap it I think it would have happened by now.
---
Depends on the rolls a lot. A one star might fetch 8k+ but with additional “ok” stars that can go up to 30k. Beyond that are obviously god rolls such as B2525, BE25, etc. which are trade only exclusively. These are based off of what I’ve seen in trading subs.
---
This is the real problem.  It screws over players who have been playing this for a while and have lost countless cards due to this.
---
Absolutely agreed, I actually enjoyed colossal problem due to the timer getting so close!
---
I stand corrected.
---
I suggest  it doing the savage divide primal cuts, thus one fails more than others due to the glitchy terrain and enemy spawn!
---
The easiest is the toxic Valley as that doesn't even have a boss!
---
It's also the only weapon it works with...flamers haven't worked with it in forever
---
A chainsaw is a terrible weapon. It is fragile and prone to jamming, especially when used on something like the squishy innards of a parademon. It requires regular maintenance for safe use. It requires oil, and power in the form of gas or electricity. It pushes back when used, and if it hits an extra hard bit, like an old nail or a bone or just an extra dense knothole, it can bounce back and eat your face if you're not ready. And if the chain breaks, you're literally rolling dice to see if one of the many flying bits hits anything important on you. Chainsaws are garbage weapons for post-apocalyptic nutjobs who do things like hold up their half missing hands and cackle while trying to bargain for your kids for food. Just use an axe.
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
Flamers work with a gunbash, however that costs more action points... And if in power armor... A hell of allot more action points!
---
The shishkebab is just much more efficient in ap cost and its heal rate!
---
Well, today I learned why I shouldn’t kill people with a chainsaw! I’ll stick to my good old pipe. Nocturnal of course, because I got it from the Queen. And I’m never awake during the day, only nighttime anyway.
---
What do you mean by prime it?
---
Where is the Chicken Coop for gold? I have max rep with both factions and don't remember seeing it.
---
Haven’t failed a prime event in like 10 plus attempts. Failed a few early but learned my mistake. Hunt down the prime creatures. Don’t wait for them to come to you. Their pathing sucks and their icons don’t immediately show up on radar and map unless you are close to them.
---
I do this ALL the time for that challenge, but if I really need it I’ll buy more than 1 round
---
Prime receiver?
---
you get them from scrapping perk cards and use them to upgrade new legendary perks that come out in Sept.
---
It's not just an issue of people not knowing what to do.  There's also the people that know what  to do, but don't care because they think they know better.  These people seemed to honestly believe that by sitting at those drums and doing absolutely nothing else they were obviously contributing to the event more than I was because they were getting the dings even as all the evidence to the contrary was slowly draining the meter.
---
Honey beast and Yao guai loot is pretty nice. Lots of armor and guns to scrap, gold, honey, acid, leather.
---
I love Beckett. But that emotional twist you just felt is what these future bosses need
---
I'd love to use my white new years tux as camouflage in a Toxic Valley map!
---
liberty prime *barely* existed pre-war. He was never completed and was scrapped and replaced by T-51 for anchorage, and you're telling me that what, the US government, went out of their way to build a suit of power armor based on an incomplete, top secret war robot, and for what reason? And nobody would have done it post war either, prime was found underneath the citadel in 2277 by the east coast BOS. Seriously pulled that out of your ass.
---
And you're telling me a statue capable of, not pyrotechnics, but spontaneously combusting into a nuke explosion is somehow completely fine and justifiable? Fuck sake.
---
It's a fucking butt inserted alien probe. "Aah yes this is genuine alien tech, put it in the archives. it goes up the ass, It's not a joke in any way." it was obviously made for shits and giggles, a goofy item for the store like almost every other item featured on it. Sure aliens exist in fallout, but you're telling me what seems to be an alien shitter-examiner should be considered important or at the very least noteworthy. Amazing.
---
I'm not arguing over this, I'm not going to waste my time. I think you've already proved that your points are very far fetched and unreasonable. I provided you as much proof as you needed, by attempting to show you how goofy some of the items on the shop are that should show any reasonable person how it's not canon, yet you still cling to the most unreasonable far fetched arguments just to hold your point.
---
Am I the only person who never went to the spruce knob boat rental as a part of that quest? I’ve seen all these posts saying they can’t progress and read about it in the pc patch notes but I don’t even remember a guy named Rocco or ever going to the boat rentals
---
Glad I'm not the only one who wants this. I'd love to use laser sniper rifles instead of standard rifles for my sneak rifle build, except after 1-2 shots I go in danger.
---
That’s honestly how it should be, there was hardly ever any risk to the reward when it came to bloodied. Addressing that discrepancy was sorely needed in my opinion.
---
You need several bloodied or junkies buffed out to kill Earle
---
It's on PTS, will be after the season ends
---
These are actually some really cool ideas. I would definitely see myself using them.
---
Yea I mean that’s just ignorance on their part then. If they are afk on drums, and the world they loaded in does not have enough people on greens/critter runs, then it will fail. 
---
Bottom line is, regardless how it’s contributed, everyone should be present at the time of the event and adjust their position if necessary.
---
They need to add a “go get spit roasted by a deathclaw and a mole rat you absolute wanker” emote ngl
---
I just remembered in order to get Johnny to survive in vault 79 you have to convince Gail to get into the Biometric scanner and the way you do that is by reminding her you saved RaRa and then she brings up whether or not you were nice to her. So have I been screwed out of both obtaining a free legendary and saving johnny?
---
We want a better way to get coins, the decrease is nice, but its sidestepping the issue of some vets having lost a lot of coins due to respecs and card packs.
---
Yes except even with killing everything, it still fails ~7/10 times for me
---
Or just let us clip them through the foundation squares...
---
Should have just left and let him fail
---
Meat week seems like a nice time to kick back and relax, might do it.
---
It’s amusing to watch you get this triggered.
---
The schematics and specs for Liberty Prime were in the Enclave computers. 
---
You’re very focused on the statue.  As you’ve yet to say how it ‘breaks lore’. 
---
And nothing about the probe says it goes in the anus. You’re fixated on that for some reason. 
---
Nothing in the Atomic Shop breaks lore. 
---
It **adds** to lore. Huge difference. 
---
Have a good night.
---
What’s the point of only making it a one star random legendary for completing? should have made it like fasnacht.
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4515](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/4515)
---
It must be like this at the bare minimum, accept nothing less.
---
Ha ..so I think this was me. Little do you know that I ran out of ammo and had to switch to my non-auto weapon. Sorry you felt it was intentional. Geez. I'm a bloodied stealth build so no, I can't take the beating you obviously can. All players play different styles, yours may not be another's and that's ok. Cool thought that I got to read a story about it...kudos.
---
ahhhhh okay, thanks!
---
Oh and I don't need your scrap...got plenty of my own!
---
Serious question: Do we know anything about Bethesda's Deathclaw biology? For all we know, the male Deathclaw it a snakelike critter that fuses with the female deathclaw when mating, resulting in the spiked ridge look on her back and a constant stream of fertalization for her eggs.
---
Yeah dude it lags because I put my tent there...I guess that’s why fast travel is broken also right?!? seriously I can’t believe the ridiculous excuses people come up with to side track from Bethesda being thieves...they put out a broken game to get our money end of story
---
I
---
Then you are probably missing something. The mobs can wander off. You have to be proactive and meet them at their spawns. I one time found a mob that had wandered in the opposite direction and gotten stuck in a pond next to a camp. It was just sitting in the water. The marker didn’t show up until I saw it from 10-20 ft in front on me.
---
My friend's been like 'oh but the damage!" despite my entire problem being that it has to be the same weapons with the same legendary perks w/ the same build. I'm glad this is coming, so I get to try new weapons n' stuff without knowing Bloodied will always be better.
---
From what I understand, it's a known bug that is intended to be fixed. But the sauce for that is now long since vanished into the internet, so take it with a pinch of salt.
---
The way the events keep failing, you won't hear the voice that much.
---
I'm unsure, if thats the case then my opinion still stands. They can't expect me just to assume my fog crawler ran off to watoga and have me run there in 30 seconds and know exactly where it is
---
What location?
---
Server hop ( it make take a few or several times) or complete it on a private server.  It can be done.  I have known 3 guys that did it this way.  Who knows when they will fix it and what else will break.
---
The enemies don't drop bullets you use all the time, actually. Only in Daily Ops and A Colossal Problem.
---
I have had this happen to me SBQ, I run out of ammo on my big gun and I've got what I've got sorry
---
You probably have but, you try hard powering it off?
---
I didn't know this
---
Are you using an external HD?
---
Yes 3 times, unfortunately nothing.
---
Cool, now my berserker build will make the game look like survival horror in combat
---
Everyone keeps complaining yet I’ve never had a single one fail, out of at least 10 meat weeks and primal cuts. Yet what I have had is the enemies get stuck in trees and down cliffs and stuff. They’re probably wandering around far away from the drums and you don’t see them
---
I am, is this the problem?
---
Near Welch station!
---
A wastelander of taste! I too use a chainsaw for the critters. Flaming one so as to give those chunks a nice crispy bite!
---
Ah okay thanks
---
We did fail it.....
---
a middle finger emote would be amazing. They might as well use the M rating
---
If there is an Enclave add on, should come with a new boss like [Frank Horrigan](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Frank_Horrigan).
---
same, love the game, got mad once then realized.. it a game... crap happens.. i didn't even get dark souls mad lol...
---
Focusing on the legendary is a jerk move? From the way you talk about yourself you seem perfectly capable handling all the other creatures on your own. Sounds like you’re complaining for no reason
---
Unless you roll with a full weeb PSN name I don't think so. If it was, thanks for staying on your pole.
---
Makes sense thanks for the added detail
---
Could be. I had a lot of issues once upon a time and that turned out to be my problem. I still use an external one, but it’s a nicer one that doesn’t give me problems
---
I use the high cap backpack and use traveling pharmacy. Carry a ton of stims and radaway. Carry capacity about 350 and with the 3 guns I carry and everything I usually have about 150 on me at all times. 200 carry weight for whatever I pick up. Should be about the same if you want to ditch traveling pharmacy and just not carry as many stims and radaway. It all depends on your build really.
---
Hey man. Believe me. You think I didn’t? Doing that repetitious sh*t every day? No. Not really. But I did what I was supposed to do. I beat Wastelanders, and sided with the raiders. Then, I just played the game like I normally did. Only adding in the stupid daily tasks. Over and over. No glitches. No cheats(although if I knew at the time I could have, I probably would). And a month later (after farming random encounters), I finally hit ally. Boom. Gauss minigun plans. A couple days later, after rolling and re rolling trash. I finally hit what I wanted. Bloodied faster fire rate, lvc gauss minigun. And I haven’t looked back. After that, I did the same crap for the settlers. Then unlocked the gauss shotgun. Which I was a little disappointed with. But it’s doable. No. It’s not fun. But once you get over that rather large hump, it’s worth it. I have since moved on to ss armor. And I can definitely say, this is a lot worse. I have been crafting this armor for months. And only have two pieces out of five that I want. Anyway, good luck man.
---
I mean the gauss rifle is something but until the vats issues with bows and gauss weapons is fixed it's kinda worthless
---
Or he's tiny compared to the Queen...awe
---
Should I move it to internal and try again? Or do I need to reinstall the game completely?
---
I've had nothing but lack of players to complete meat week so I keep server hopping
---
I don’t care if someone does that. But I’ve got a lot of great stuff so sometimes I think people buy more than they intervened.
---
Its grindsem up fast n good, the whole pile splattered in moments
---
I'd say more are seeing the problem than not.
---
Yeah, I didn't realize I was that low..and had to switch to my explosive...so it may have seemed like I was shooting at him but whatevs. We failed it anyway and the legendary drop was shit...so I wasn't exited about that interaction either!
---
It just half-works   (in collectron's voice).
---
No we didn't. Wasn't you at all.
---
Xbox
---
That isn't a great option in areas where mobs are actively spawning and attacking your CAMP.
---
I've had problems with that one failing even after we kill the SS, we finish then the time just runs out and fails
---
A few is lucky, its every other one ive done. At least it’s lots of acid scrap
---
If you’re a purist and get one tapped very easily then go with chem. If I remember correctly the high cap mod cuts your DR quite a bit. May require you to carry more stims which then defeats the purpose of having a higher carrying cap.
---
Oh man...well I had that same interaction...guess plenty of players enjoy the pole....
---
I also jumped off the cook spit at Grahms cook out and died earlier today too. Can’t survive those 5 to 10 drops I guess. And not one bastard at the cookout picked me up...
---
You can’t even attack stuff while you’re underwater
---
Delete and redrop the vending machine and see if it keeps happening. It's the equivalent of rebooting. You can try storing it first but I don't think that would work.
---
I usually just check the time as the event starts every hour, I just make sure to get there a little before it starts
---
Happy cake day, my perks are not optimized too. In game I have a shop, just go to loot and have some fun, almost all my perks are for carry weight and better loot. Don't see the point to do a heavy build for my style of playing.
---
No you don’t. Super sledges only have 1 mod, that mod doesn’t weigh 22 pounds
---
I've had it happen twice today..even with 4 of us in an easy locale...so probably a glitch...lol
---
What’s with Meat Week being finished before I can fast travel to it? I don’t get to play much lately and I login, try to fast travel to the event, and by the time I’m there( one-two minutes after) it’s already finished? I don’t remember it finishing that quick last year.
---
it's a public test server feature that is not even in the game yet
---
It's the question of where you have more free perk space, if you are someone constantly needing carry weight then you probably need high cap and traveling pharmacy and/or thru hiker. 
---
If you're usually fine with weight while using similar perks, then maybe try the chem no and use the perk space for something else
---
Keep in mind, that's not canon. Nothing is. We know very basic info from Fallout 3/4, but nothing really solid about their life cycle. Do DC queens eat their mates like a mantis? Do DC's switch gender? Or worse, have both genders (two DC's meet, both get preggers, double the murderous fun)?
---
Iirc shotguns really was the only true meta nerf that made the build rather unusable.
---
Of course they did nothing to address their awful balancing attempt.
---
There's a static spawn for the accordion on a desk inside the Overseer's house.
---
That’s genius. I have pretty much saved those atoms anyway. I’ll use some of them to level up.
---
Were they a low level? Im debating trying this on a freshy tonight.
---
Try grafton
---
I've seen 600% budget camps with no lag, so that's wrong!
---
I have no respect for people who use this weapon. I can't remember their name, but a long time player was even abusing it the other night. Pathetic. Might as well just spawn in a dozen turrets on top of each other. You are as good as that hacker if you use Gauss. ;)  
---
  
---
I will forever play legit, using non-noob weapons, and 100% solo and random teammates.
---
You could try that? It at least would rule out whether the external is the problem. I don’t think you need to reinstall, just move it. 
---
If you delete the game you lose all your photos, so you want to avoid doing that
---
Yeah. Its why Ill keep doing the savage divide one at least
---
the key is have aloooooot, don't just sell 10 mm sell multiple types, fusion and 308 pretty easy to get and sell thousands of each, when people see the sheer number of ammo at your camp they will come buy ALSO sell like 10 regular non legend weapons and like 30 random assorted clothing.. people will eat your base alive and see your ammo stockpile and you will sell quick
---
Yeah I know about the gauss rifle, I wish they had that option for other energy weapons as well.
---
I honestly don’t care what Bethesda thinks it will do. The game is the game. Just trying to give advice for what is and not what will never be. This is as an issue last meat week too.
---
Lol I nearly have 20k ammo always at my camp. 10mm just never sells compared to the rest of it.
---
New? The last one was never patched!
---
Got my camp on the coal tower as well. Its getting nuked on the daily but I am not ready to give up on it yet lol. How did you get stairs and platforms inside the building I have been trying to figure that one for a long time. Are they just clipping from the outside structure?
---
Yeah I agree. Not adding any new rifles in wastelanders was a total cop out
---
Rads from food?
---
If you mean the actual armor then finding someone selling it in their vendor is the only way. I see them from time to time along with the rest of the MoM gear.
---
Just keep making weekly posts about NW. They will see the demand. There is clearly a small grass roots player base for it. I think it could be the best battle royale if they put resources to developing it.
---
That it messes with the spawns is a myth. People just love to have someone to blame but it’s Bethesda’s fault. I mean yeah if your camp covered a barrel but the rest is just a rumour. I’ve had it fail more times with no camp or tent around than with.
---
Vader. Lol.
---
Is it still dropping vanilla? Like non legendary? I only did the event twice late last eve. Have done all previous meat week events. If the damned thing wasn't 20lbs, I would have one. Very unique.
---
*¡SUPERCOW AL RESCATE!*
---
That's awesome !! Kudos to for fighting alone, the first beat my as lmfao. The second time there was definitely a few magical guns.
---
No other battle royale would ever allow this.
---
It's almost as if one of the games has been around years longer and has had a chance to work out a number of the issues.
---
Started one week late and I'm up to 90 now.
---
Merchants aren't so bad.. Athena on the other hand..
---
You should be able to do so by going in settings
---
I'll give that a try next time it happens (When it still has things tagged and priced but the machine is empty and my CAMP vending marker is gone.). It doesn't work after I re-load and nothing is priced or marked. I doubt this would work, though, because when you delete a full, working vending machine all it's items get moved to your stash, and deleting the machine should have the same effect. Storing and re-placing is more likely to work I think.
---
A surprise map from the Commonwealth.
---
Not just doors. Walls too.
---
Nice
---
How long left on it ?
---
Tato salad seems bugged and removes HP for some reason sometimes. Aside from that you can lose HP because of losing your well fed buff. I eventually got the healing factor mutation because of that very problem.
---
One wasteland isn't live yet I dont think
---
Someone on here may as well. Good luck.
---
Aaaand that's why I don't sell scrap items at my trap camp. Its one thing to sell you some guns and ammo that don't drop when i kill you. Its a whole other dick move to sell you scrap then take it back after I kill you.
---
Have been for months as well as perk packs
---
Anyone got a link to the updated legendary perks? I've read somewhere on here that they added more, but Google isn't helping.
---
Don't sell it.  Period.  Trade it for what you want.
---
I have ammo in the machine specifically for this. It finished it for us as well when people do this.
---
lmao watch that be the only one you get for like 6 months.
---
Do quests you haven’t done
---
Congrats only 160 more modules and you might get what you want.
---
&gt; Its for real so dumb, please can we potentially get a 50% increase in time
---
In terms of events I've failed, I think that would have helped once, maybe twice.
---
Most of the fails - we have 1 minute left+.  Just nothing will spawn.
---
In the savage divide they regularly spawn so far away that the quest doesn't tag them sometimes even underground!
---
Shake they removed the legendary effect from it...
---
I don't carry tons of junk but I always put it up for what the game says it's worth. Steel sells so quick
---
Not to mention it seems easier than ever to advance, now. Imagine all that grinding at 100 points/10k XP.  All that time, its no wonder he comes in here an complains.  I'm still taking my time.  Even missed a day the other day.  No big deal.  I'm 8 spaces in front of the bad guy.  I dont even do the NW stuff unless they are easy.  When I was in the army there was a saying.  Its when the troops DONT complain - that's when you should listen up.
---
I have absolutely no idea what the hell I’m meant to do. So I play the chemical barrel, because I know it at least helps a little while I watch and try to figure out what they’re doing. I’ve also started making Chally’s feed before events but I don’t know where to put it.
---
Thank you I completely forgot about that quest!
---
I've gotten a bunch of 3 star legendary fog crawlers on the last 2 waves.  But the "boss" mob - only 1 star legendaries.
---
I have no idea how you’re selling steel. It’s literally everywhere you look.
---
So, you don't think the event should be realistically possible? Thats all I'm trying to say, its not realistically possible to go on a manhunt up to 400 meters radius from the event to find 1 fog crawler.
---
I never noticed this one before. I’ll be running it now. Thank you!
---
I can’t say I hate it all. I’m 220-something but the amount of time I have to put in is still too much. Especially since Meat Week has been a distraction.
---
Pigs on the wing.
---
Storing and replacing is the same as removing everything and reselling. By removing it from the world and rebuilding, you're initializing everything. No reason to wait for it to glitch again. Just get it over with now and see if it's fixed.
---
Stop
---
The shooting gallery is season 2 as well I believe.
---
Sigh. Why is the first assumption players and player camps are to blame for everything in this game? If player camps are truly the cause, then shame on Bethesda for bad coding and not allowing the two to coexist. Literally, the point is to let us camp almost anywhere. It’s on the dev team to make sure the seasonal events overlay on the base game properly. And if the servers can’t handle both at once, that’s on Beth too.
---
Meanwhile I love using short but highly destructive bursts of three to six.
---
As i understand it for meat week it is just The one star drops, and are worthless, but the prime meat 15 per cookout will make up for the scrip losses and then some.
---
Edit: this really should be upvoted - I knew about it ahead of time, but I know I wasn't around last year and there a ton of new players probably thinking they need luck +2
---
Huh, I’ve had the game since launch, but never really got into it. It felt empty, like something was missing. Played on and off for a bit, but once my friends stopped playing that was it for me. Wastelanders brought me back, I’m a whopping level 45 now and I’m just excited that I have started amassing enough legendary items to get scrip. It seems like things are making progress in a positive manner, I guess the point I was getting at was I never saw what the end game was. But I’m excited that by the time I get there it will be an enjoyable experience.
---
interestingly enough i died from eating taro salad today. I thought it was just a bad batch...
---
&gt; Enemies in new content now drop the ammo used on them 
---
My gripe was that nerfing damage just means more bullets spent.  The game for me is treading delicately on a balance of my casual play netting me just enough junk to make ammo and stay armed without having to go farm materials like you would in an mmo.  Tip it over to where I've got to spend a lot of time going around looting shit just for ammo and I'm going to lose interest fast.  But if the mobs are going to drop ammo like that, then I'm all for it.  But in a game like this, nerfing damage doesn't really change anything other than having SBQ, wendingo collossus, and a small handful of legendaries taking a few more bullets than normal.  Just about everything else is going to get one shot whether you've got a 3 star or a player made weapon.  These monsters are not difficult because there are almost no mechanics.  SBQ is just as dumb as a rad roach.  She just has more hp.  Instead of nerfing damage, I'd rather they make these encounters actually difficult with harder mechanics that would make me want to roll a medic build and having that be the difference between my group winning or losing.  Right now it's WoW circa 2009 where you just blindly join a group with group find tool and everyone just blasts away.
---
Power armour wall glitch ~ google it
---
A new feature being introduced, currently in PTS. Basically you scrap perk cards to get perk coins and use them to upgrade legendary perks (also PTS)
---
I'm talking about what's reported on the PTS
---
95
---
&gt; Without a damage re-balance, how could Bethesda possibly release meaningful endgame content if all of us are just destroying it within seconds? 
---
That's the crux right there. Sadly for a tiny fraction of the community, this is all they care about. End game bosses aren't about a challenge. They're just a chore to deal with asap so they can move onto the next objective and meaninglessly grind out more legendaries and XP.
---
I'm a bloodied main as well and this is very much a welcome start to balancing the game. Certainly by no means the end of it but a good start none the less.
---
2 weeks from the upcoming tuesday
---
Yeah quite a bit of area in between my camp and the site, my green perimeter doesn't even touch it
---
What would medics be than?
---
Try to get the SS to die near the cliff edge. Shoot the SS body with explosives at the very least they have to climb all the way down to get to the SS.
---
The western duster has been around for quite some time - I believe it came out around the start of the game, and it cycles through the atom shop occasionally. (If that’s what you’re referring to!)
---
Some friends and I ran around as the Garvey Gang for *months*. Great memories.
---
Cheers. Thank you.
---
Thanks 🤙
---
Sometimes when they do that it may seem their gone,but, really turned into a meat pile some distance away.
---
This post is only going to increase griefing.
---
And? Those are literally just colors. Unless it has the red star that China uses on it, then I’d hardly say it has anything to do with China. 
---
Planting something red white and blue doesn’t automatically mean it represents America. It could be the UK, or France, or any other country that uses those colors. Maybe those colors used together aren’t even supposed to represent a country. With no definitive imagery, you can’t just say that it’s absolutely supposed to be one particular thing.
---
And with the nerf, everyone is going to need better gear!
---
Hmmmm...I already re-filled my machines. Another idea I had was destroying the machines with flamethrower traps. But really, Bethesda just needs to fix the damn vending machines once and for all.  
---
Edit: Oh, you mean build new vending machines entirely in case they are bugged! I have tried that, unfortunately. No dice.
---
I'll swing by a player vendor, look at the plans offered, and if theres nothing I need, I buy ammo.
---
I'm thinking cap dumps or newer players. Only reason I sell it is cause I get so much from scrapping guns. Definitely is everywhere. If it didn't sell I wouldn't bother but it gets cleaned out 36 caps for 1 bulk set
---
Yup, happened to me too when drinking some sweet, sweet toxic goo
---
This would make “can breathe underwater” a useful effect finally lol
---
I have a wonderful Bloodied LMG, but after crafting 3k .308 ammo and being down to 1.1k after doing a few missions, I just stuffed it in my stash and went back to my Furious pump action
---
fo76 has made almost zero progress in the way of fixing problems in nearly 3 years.
---
I can't speak for other platforms but there are definitely quite a few more than 10 on PS4. I have a long list of friends and typically hop between them when I'm in the mood for shopping at vendors... they're all on different servers.
---
However, it definitely seems like there's some formula which results in me landing on the same smaller set of servers over and over when I just quit and rejoin. Cuz I rarely randomly end up on my friends' servers and I definitely end up on the same other servers over and over. 
---
My friends are from around the world so that's probably a factor...
---
Finished it today. I also finally got max rep with the settlers last week after focusing on raiders first. With meat week events failing for me more often than not I don't have much to do in game now so bring on the next season.
---
Vanity backpack update just means you can now apply skins to small backpack and you no longer need to craft a new pack to apply a skin
---
That might be fun to say but if you genuinely believe that you haven't actually been playing because it's absolutely not accurate... But nice try.
---
try Melee/shotguns/heavy (you can do all of them with the same SPECIAL)
---
Oh congrats
---
Show Grahm respect.
---
I bought a dozen assaultron recall circuits today. Within 10 minutes of spending 30k caps I was at 28,000 again. I’m not even level 50 yet.
---
When your food drops your well fed disappears thus losing your 25/50 hp bonus dropping u to 1 hp. It’s the same way with food if they expire.
---
Right now, I only have one item in one vendor.  A GAS certificate for 30k.  It's mostly there so people can use my camp as fast travel to monogah mine when it's nuked.  Since it's down the road from ATLAS, I put up what I like to call my welcome sign for the BOS.
---
It’s only glitched once for me but holy crap it was too comical to be mad at. We could all hear the fog crawlers but couldn’t see em and they were even damaging everyone. Used vats to see that they were galloping around below ground and they were sideways lol only thing that could damage them was explosive damage. Still completed tho.
---
hey there, i recently quit xbox and can give you some free stuff. you in?
---
Fallout 76 is supposed to maximize money by using as little resources as possible.
---
I keep saying if you want real change to stop spending money. Its easier and cheaper to work on a project continuously than it is to make a new one.
---
They bought that studio specially to make fallout 76.
---
Do they even talk about it in the vault anymore
---
If I can figure out how to make a mod to silence Sofia's cringy commentary, the Todd mod could be my second release.
---
From a sort of outside perspective (been keeping up with the game but waiting for good changes, I was tired of 1 step forward 2 steps back) the nerf _can_ be good, if followed by other correctly applied changes. Bloodied became the go-to not _only_ because it was the most damage, but it was also easy to set up on the lower end gear-wise and largely because end game enemies _are already_ meat shields. Base damage needs to go up and enemy and boss health needs to go down too
---
My assumption is confirmation bias.
---
I don't notice the last 20 Cave Crickets that vanished into the ether over the last few Primal Cut events, but that one legendary that shows up and just disappears as soon as I shoot it, you damn well know i'm pissed I've lost my 1* nocturnal rolling pin.
---
Yes I waited for the meat pile, no it just no longer existed - i even have a glowing meat piles mod for this exact reason.
---
*I may also be venting*
---
The auto complete bug made it far more grueling and demoralising that it should be... Half my friends list gave up on the game because of it!
---
I think you’re right lol
---
One more level and I finally catch up.
---
Two shit auto grenade launcher. I know it's a typo, but that cracked me up.
---
So perk level and coins are not account wide? That's dumb. I thought the whole system would be account wide.
---
The Gauss Minigun also requires this as 2mm ec cartridges were also intended as sniper ammo!
---
That's good to know, thank you! I will still post the .38 special, I just won't assume it helps for challenges from now on.
---
Yau guis are the absolute worst
---
I just picked the locks of player camps then let the owner shoot me!
---
What level are you? I'm new and level 25 lol
---
I started experiencing this more after i took the empath mutation. It real helps others and almost negates it if another team meamber also has it.
---
Actually level 22 😂....
---
That's not what a mule is.
---
This one isn't, there's two variants.
---
Happened to me as well.
---
There are controllers with chips that can fire super fast. Also, there are rumors of ways to use scripts, even on console.
---
96 here, I honestly thought it was going to be really hard to finish, the way that it was broke down by how many points per day and how many repeatables you had to get. Thank Todd for double score or I would have had to push more.
---
If that's the case then it's probably best to rethink the camp location until Bethesda gets around to buffing turrets.
---
\*waves down the Reddit crowd\* Hold on, mates, I got this.
---
(ahem)
---
Why are you white knighting for Bethesda? Clearly you don't understand how brutal it is to move your virtual house for a week. They COULD have given me free jimmies for my trouble, but instead they added a broken patch to a broken game and ruined my fun, after playing since beta (and despite posting this regularly enough to set your clock to it). Well, I finally had enough! Open your eyes, sheeple! They don't care about customer retention or PR, they just want your money, and of COURSE those two things aren't related.
---
... To be clear, because this is the internet...
---
/s
---
To be honest, if this is what drives a person to quit, I cannot imagine why they would have ever kept going in the first place. This isn't game breaking. This is comedy gold as you can only get from a game and engine as bonkers as 76 provides.
---
I like the Ash Heap one, nice acid farm with all the cave crickets.
---
But yeah fuck the Yao Guai at Savage Divide, "oh look, a bear, oh look it hit me, oh look i lost half my hp and am staggered for 30 years, oh look it hit me again" xD Bonus points when I should have killed the damn thing but I get the rubber banding damage glitch.
---
I die when regaining my well fed sometimes with plenty of room to spare for the rads from the food.
---
So frustrating. 
---
Just feels helpless watching that timer count down while running hopelessly around trying to find a creature we might have missed.
---
Yep. They're able to be used even if you disconnect the power. Store them or put them behind locked doors.
---
Disconnecting the power just makes it not show on the map. Doesn’t stop people from buying.
---
No power just means ppl wont see ur camp on the map, they can still buy stuff tho. Just store ur vendors if u hit max caps
---
Power just “advertises” it on the map, they’re still usable without it
---
I just want to be able to continue my story plot. Is the glitch with the tcell and the blood fixed yet?
---
I never went bloodied on any of my characters. Felt like it would be a waste of time. 🤔😆
---
Bruh. She ain’t *that* ugly. Not compared to your mum anyway.
---
The people that are playing the drums and spinning the cooking spit ACTUALLY HELP because they help the event bar not go down too much/too quick. 
---
The easiest way to fail the event is to not put out the random fires that start every now and then. I’ve done so many events, and they all take less than 30 seconds to complete. 
---
As soon as the event starts I suggest turning in your prime meat, so you can get rewarded script. 
---
I go for the plants. And only the plants. Gf goes for the skeletons. And my friend goes for the creature chunks. 
---
Some people go clean up the poop, and some people deposit wood. I’m really not exaggerating when I’m saying that each event I’ve done so far gets done under 30 seconds. If you failed an event, do yourself a favor and hop servers.
---
That's not a random encounter, just a normal day in Toxic Valley.
---
Wow thanks for the quick answers. That kinda sucks I figured it was completely unusable since the power lights are off. Seems more like a bug to me.
---
Try not to rush through quests. 
---
You're going to run out of ammo if you use only use one type of gun on your first playthrough.
---
If enemies are too tough, you've progressed to an area that you are not ready for.
---
After you finish the green forest region, you can choose between south, in the Ash Heap, for higher enemies, or north, in the Toxic Wastes for higher enemies. If you go east, you will find enemies too tough for you.
---
When you get to lv 40+, that's the time you will have more fun in the eastern parts of the map, which are the Mire and Cranberry Bog.
---
Deathclaw armor should have even more energy resistance than leather armor and as much damage resistance as say heavy combat armor.
---
Nope it didn’t fix it, I was really hoping it would. A friend of mine is having the same problem.
---
I'm just waiting to see that 1 PA display will cost like 10% camp budget
---
Toxic Valley is the easiest one to do, no burrowing enemies and no boss level enemies! I always complete that one with 2 minutes to spare solo, so I can travel over and finish whatever other prime cuts is still active!
---
F'n Cranberry Bog and that one fog crawler that spawns and then hightails it to RobCo, or it simply spawns at RobCo.
---
I didn’t think I would finish either but I won’t say it was enjoyable. It was a distraction the core gameplay which I usually enjoy.
---
I’ll pay the bullion cost. It would’ve been infinitely quicker to get the gold to pay for the chicken coop, for example.
---
Damn. Sorry to hear that
---
There’s a way easier way if you’re interested. When you’re facing her, you’ll see to the right in front of the counter there is a barrel. Stand behind that barrel and try to put down your power armor Infront of it. Now get as close to the wall and try to get in it. If done correct, you’ll see a small camera movement of you trying to get in the power armor, but you will not do the “getting in” animation at all. 
---
When that happens and you’re able to move again, run towards the vendor, jump onto her little window thing and just keep walking forward. After a few seconds you’ll magically get put into your power armor and be able to get inside with her. 
---
You can also do this method to get into her little jail cell with the pool table. And if you try to do the power armor glitch downstairs, you can glitch your way into the mole miner in the basement. You can’t kill him and he won’t turn hostile.
---
Step one, turn pacifist on under gameplay settings.
---
Let's not forget about those same turrets happily and endlessly attacking friendly trader NPCs that wonder into the camp...... Or at times even random camp items for some reason known to none.
---
yep, welcome to Bethesda.
---
only care about 59 lbs of things for immersing
---
I have my weapon break and thumb fumble around trying to change it
---
It has been like that since they were launchef
---
Yeah it’s super annoying. Makes 0 sense.
---
Ok, so thats probably not the case then
---
Gauss shotties are amazing
---
This is the correct answer.
---
I was killed a couple times to that today, first shot gun breaks, yau giu over runs me as I fumble to get a different weapon out
---
I’m level 91!!!
---
Yea I love that encounter!
---
I just bought a level 50 1 star bloodied fixer for 500 caps. 
---
Wasn’t sure if it was worth much. Since I’m not a rifle build. Bought it anyways.
---
Thank you. Perfect clip.
---
That sucks. The flamethrower idea would be satisfying if nothing else though.
---
It should use 5mm rounds imo. Lore wise the game already refers to them as 7.62x51 NATO cartridges on their ammo box mesh, and balance wise the LMG is already basically a side-grade to the minigun, just with significantly more expensive ammunition. I'd love to use my Junkie's LMG more often, but as is it's just way too expensive; the amount of lead and cloth I would spend to use the LMG for a single SBQ fight would last me multiple play sessions if I spent it on my other weapons.
---
I carry only about 10 stims at any given time and use my high capacity BP only when I'm overencumbered. Damage, and rad resist take too much of a hit using only the high capacity.
---
What lvl? I'm 180 somethin
---
agreed! When you hit fast travel, you then have to accept the cost to fast travel. In that SAME place, add an option below it that says ‘travel inside.’ That would not add clicks ;)
---
Vamp/vanguard.  You will be the tankest thing alive!!!
---
Exact same, I am running from yao guai trying to find a weopan
---
100% agree with all of it.
---
Got 2 from him today.  His inventory is wildly unpredictable
---
My point, which sailed directly over your head,  is that Graham provides perfectly crystal clear instructions if you'd only just listen.
---
I disagree with this premise. Mathematically speaking The first star is the most important one. Especially with bloodied. I mean explosive and faster fire rate are great, but completely unnecessary in 90% of situations.
---
I did the same thing.
---
Be really cool if you could store caps in your camp. Like in a piggy bank or something. Even if it could be picked just put it behind a keypad lock so it’s impossible to get at it.  Then build strong boxes or something, each one could hold 30k caps but they are only accessible from your camp. And they can be stolen from so it seems balanced.
---
fire station  and little building between fire station and belching betty
---
I found him the first time up by the sodium drinking fountain. Like I want to be Fritz, dude is great
---
Barely playable is just an absurd exaggeration, hands down. You’re being a drama queen.
---
i try to find low level camps and buy the most expensive things they have hahaha just to make their day...probably they aren't selling anything anyways bc the prices are hilarious since they are noobs and don't know the game yet. 
---
A mini nuke for 400 caps? yeah gimme all of them! and I drop all the plans I have on me that day.
---
I played for several months from Beta, and dropped the game for 2 years. Came back and played for another 2 months and almost all of the exact same problems still existed. Little bit more content, but not much, and same bugs and glitches still rampant. So not only is it “fun to say”, it’s true.
---
Does it change every hour or only by server? I usually stay at the same server unless I have to hop and noticed he seems to always have the same plans, even the quantity is the same.
---
Added :)
---
Thanks and added :)
---
lol what was it called before you renamed it?
---
Haven't had an issue yet
---
I missed out earlier because I tried to leave the spit once the event started to turn in my prime meats, and I wasn't able to move. Fast traveled to V76, fast traveled back, and Grahm was giving his ending speech. It's insane how quickly people are finishing it, at least on PC.
---
That would be a horrible trade for OP. These rolls are prob the rarest rolls atm
---
If you have my ammo I will buy them 1, 2, the rest to satisfy the challenge (if it's 1 cap each)
---
Did you make sure you're not perked for travel or something like that? I do that all. the. time.
---
After throwing a grenade you can quickly hit the VATS button and blow it up early. It's a tactic people use for cheap and easy kills because most grenades one-shot and have massive blast radius.
---
AFAIK its based player to player, I've seen people mention that if they find grahm, they will get a friend to keep him in place while they log out and back in to change his inventory. Never tried it myself so I don't know if this is an old method for getting all his plans or if it still works.
---
Mirror ball stone and metal benches rad emitter and a few others rotate.  seems server hopping is only way to get a new inventory.
---
Doesn't seem bugged to me. I run only one Stabilised, but there's a definite difference with and without with each of my weapons (Handmade, Gauss, Hunting)
---
Take your time, and piece together the lore from terminals, holotapes, notes, and clues from the environment
---
.44 pistol
---
Your story feels like 2020 in a nutshell. A bunch of people yelling at each other all the while collectively failing
---
[](/kajexplain)It's got the gilded skin, which was only obtainable from the dev room if I recall correctly. Some duper prolly gave it to ya. It might be worth something to someone, but it's also a bit of a taboo item.  
---
Edit: Mmmm, downvoted for answering a question? That's a new one to me. It's not the atom shop gilded revolver, it's the one from the dev room.
---
Acp not on console.
---
Idk about that man. I know a lot of people have been asking for it but those tall buildings will make for some really annoying high ground camping.
---
I've got no perks like that? I've also re-equipped all my perk cards. It happens  every day until I check the legendary exchange.
---
It took me two server hops tonight to get it. The letter and signs was on it too but I didn’t buy for 10k caps I’ll just wait. I think I can get from vendor at watoga for that anyways
---
When I was leveling I choose a balance of QOL and damage perks. If I were to do it again, I'd suck it up and level damage faster because I hit a road-block which made levels 25-45 pretty ugly.
---
Yes. I really hate that you gotta see teammate markers at all.
---
Whats wrong with it?
---
Or they were just lucky
---
damn right, i am laughing
---
I’m 91! All my perk cards make me a beast tho
---
Um, he was spraying me after when I was emoting him. He wasn't out of ammo. Also, last 10% of SS he decided he'd put a few rounds in.
---
Also saw him at a later one watching everyone else do the lifting. So.....
---
yes, that i was. i spent 1000 scrip
---
Oh I think if he didn’t get stuck in tree I wouldn’t of been able to do it alone that quick. But being I could hit him in he head over and over again the magic happened. But thanks. It’s fun, I really wish consoles would get the new event so we can test that out. I have 20 nuke cards and have fallout 1st I might try to see if I can solo the queen just once. Just wanna see what I can do
---
Dude to answer your question. So basically caps value has been inflated. Back in the day TSE handmades were like 6k. Now they sell for nothing because they exceed max cap, 30k. That’s the most you can hold. Once something has exceeded 30k, it becomes “trade only”. We still have to give it a cap value so we know what’s fair when trading for other items that are relative in value. 
---
Having said that, there’s no such thing as a rare gun anymore hardly. They’ve all been heavily duped, especially the top end weapons. 
---
If you’re on Xbox, I can also help you get started with a higher tier weapon and explain a few things. It’s the only thing I have left to do, guide people down the path so to speak. If not hope that clears some stuff up.
---
No kidding. Server I was just on, Grahms meat cook never even started. Everyone stood around making the question mark emoji til we all slowly left.
---
If you don't have fo1st don't be sentimental with your gear or your stash box will be too full for all the junk you will need. Look up guides and nukes and dragons website for which build you think you will want so you don't end up wasting perk points.
---
I don't play on PC but I agree getting rid of hackers should be their top priority. Maybe they can't figure out how to get rid of hackers and that's the reason they abandoned the game mode.
---
i honestly like scaling, so even low level content may only be just slightly  easier and i dont have to make a new toon to play with em, and exploring and doing events can feel more fair rather than having a highbie ruin it for lowbie coz i really like exploring and fucking about donig random events, not really into end game stuff in here, not really the main reason i wanted to play fallout with other peeps to begin with xD
---
You say you want 3 star enemies more rate and difficult to find, and then talk about a 3 star enemy that is guaranteed. Don’t you see the conflict?
---
I've given up on it. I'm not interested in the event either so now just not planning on logging in until the next score season starts.
---
I've actually seen him wearing a hazmat suit just wandering around inside a nuked Whitespring before.
---
Have run it a dozen times over last 2 days. Spawn rate slower than the timer so it always fails before the last prime beast appears. Every time. No matter how many players participate.
---
? Whats going on?
---
I’ve gotten the emitter every time until just this last time he had mirror ball and letter and signs. I got the ball but not the 10k for letters
---
You are so not wrong. I cannot wait to finish and not care about score for a bit. This game is sadly feeling more grindy and more like a "mobile game" with all its time gates, currency cap, and daily "jobs" as it ages.
---
we tested it a bunch more, him without them on had sway, with had none. either way mine was unaffected. super weird. but, I tried fully quitting to desktop and relaunching the game entirely, and now they're working. so at least solved, even if it's a weird bug to have happen XD
---
Yes...he gives clear instructions. Clear as mud.
---
I stand by my previous comment.
---
What system you play on.
---
Never mind it says Xbox
---
I’m also on Xbox I can find plan and then give you it
---
And difficult to fight and kill. I’m fine with SBQ and Encryptid being guaranteed because you need to have some skill to launch a nuke or complete encryptid. Boss events should give 3* and I mean make 3* more rare in the wild
---
Still better then 76
---
So I just moved my camp last week and got it perfect and I love it. This week it’s on the spawn for this stupid event and I can’t even play the game or my camp is destroyed literally every 5 minutes. It’s not even fun to play anymore
---
you need to server hop. which is easy this week because you know where he is
---
I don't know if this is related but I just noticed my ultracite power armor just duplicated itself in my inventory?
---
Damn. I would either relocate for the time being if i were you. Good luck!
---
If that's true, wouldn't it be impossible for some players to get it without "trading"? That's kinda stupid tbh
---
Did you accidentally put the dense mod on your brain?
---
yes it’s broken, but if you want to complete it you need to go run and find the enemies. they won’t come to you. it doesn’t fail f you can kill them in time
---
#MODUSTERMINAL
---
Aye, very strange. Least it's sorted now.
---
Nah. Everything I’ve worked for the last 2 years is going to be garbage. My perks, my armor, my weapons. I’ve been here since the beginning and now I’m out. I for real don’t have time or the energy anymore to rework my whole build. I’m too busy trying to eat and drink to stay alive. I’ve loved FO forever but game has become a chore bore and I’m over it.
---
Would actually rather just uninstall this game tbh. Like I spent 4 straight hours making my camp perfect and now this event is just making it ridiculous lol. The animals don’t even attack players they go straight for my house😂
---
I like Fasnacht more
---
The BOS didn't learn that in time.
---
Just finished a gunslinger build. Hope it doesn’t suck too hard after the nerf…
---
finished it yesterday thank god im done
---
Ok thanks for the reply. On another note I suck at primal. Almost finished it twice but crashed when the legendary came out.ill try it again tommorow
---
Got 4 more levels, stressing just a little with bad weather in Gulf forming.
---
Cant display a banjo, idk what they were doing.
---
I havent even tried it yet.worth it?
---
Is it worth it to go to 3 star for friendly fire? I have to move points around if I do so and really don't want to.
---
Thank God, i was only upset about this nerf cuz I'm almost always low on ammo 😂 but now I'm worry free
---
I’ve never had any luck with the spotlights, but the scarecrows have always worked for me. Turrets in general have given me mixed results, anything larger than a rad rat they’re pretty quick to discharge unless it’s a scorched or mutie half a mile away behind a tree.
---
Would love this but its min max or nothing as of now
---
I'd say so, you get a pretty decent at worst reward for a successful finish, and it's incredibly easy. Plus, if you're into trading, some of the items it gives are of pretty high value
---
4h? Those are rookie numbers! In all seriousness try relocating you get your set up blueprinted so you should not have to rebuild much
---
Even if they’re behind doors if the camp hasn’t loaded in you can get through, or using wall glitches
---
Happy cake day!
---
Or maybe they could just fix the exploit.
---
Legendaries at primal events and main event. Decent xp,recipies, plans. Theres always something do constantly.
---
Missed three weeks but I’m at tier 82 without buying any yet, hopefully I won’t have to
---
Odds are somebody got lucky and traded or sold to the highest bidder.hell I would
---
Now that's a Boss I hope to see ripping my comrades apart like accordions someday
---
I'll just keep letting my ArmCo machine produce more ammo than I can use up, thanks.
---
how about, stop asking for stupid shit like this to be on the atoms shop.
---
Sorry for your loss, hopefully you make tons of memories in the Wasteland to cheer you up
---
Anything is possible on pc!damn nice find though
---
I’m only a level 50 so I only have so much stuff lol
---
Or make it so everyone on the team has a different colour so you know who’s is who’s
---
I don't mind seeing teammate markers since it helps me help them, but make them different colors so that, like OP, I'm not walking around in circles.
---
I'm still hoping someone will broadcast One More Pils over their mic during the cook out...
---
Better question are the meat piles still de-spawning and leaving behind actual items?
---
Am i the only one who's pearly peepers barely zoom in at all?
---
Damage nerf why exactly? We've been asking for more bosses harder enemy's end game stuff for 2 years and a  damage nerf just makes things after 2 years redundant, you haven't thought this through weakling
---
It has. Like 5 minutes ago. The last prime beast was a giant hermit crab. Killed it in about 5 seconds. Still had about 15 seconds left.  Ran back to the drum to play in crlebration because I thought Finally!  It cant fail the quest now...but it did. There were 6 of us standing around. All over 200th level. Pissed off.
---
Sounds like you’re looking for an excuse to quit man.
---
True, i can now afford doing a 53 cap trips but for newbies it has to suck, Ive never hit the cap limit tho so idk.
---
I’m sitting on 40 prime meat, think I can turn it all in? Nope cause Bethesda as usual has to limit how much you can turn in at a time. *eyeroll
---
What do you mean? Greenhouse Walls are rewards for season 2, you can only pay for it with Atoms
---
They’re literally asking for something that’s already in the damn game for 15$. Hell they pay me 15 I’ll build them one lol
---
Mine is just at the edge of one of the spawn points. I have minimal damage, aside from my Brahmin being eaten by wolves and Yao Guai, and it is a quick sprint over to scrap or resupply. And my vending machine sales have seen an uptick, too.
---
I love Meat Week. I missed it completely last year because of work commitments.
---
Does everything have explosive resist cuz my 1000 damage bloodied missile launcher did almost nothing to anything
---
Leave while you can lol
---
In all seriousness though don't get too mad if the game crashes or you experience some glitches, just part of the experience. Use multiple weapons and when choosing your perk card have an actual build in mind
---
They already cap PVP to like 100 dmg per shot
---
I hit that house once and will never have to hunt for cloth again.
---
Good thing I waited.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That's a kind way to admit that I never even noticed the legendary perk tab.  Heck, I got two old characters that are around level 300 that could sure benefit.
---
You may find melee build fun on PC if you're using a mouse and keyboard. I love just flying through a hoard dodging enemy like a bullfighter and flanking etc.
---
Wear 3-D glasses to take it to another dimension.
---
Nah, I hate shitty people who think exploits are okay and ruin it for legit players.
---
I'm really hoping that the instanced space is dynamic enough to be set inside of a camp. Like a trap door or regular door, and  ot be some massive bunker that wont snap to anything. 
---
I have a silent hill experience of a camp where peeps wander I to a dark smokey hall and exit into a nightmare mode of the camp. 
---
It's all so expensive tho that I'm constantly maxed out on space. Can't afford even a single flamingo or conduit connection. 
---
If they let the instances space be a door were place or I could empty out the back side and really deck out the front of the house going nuts with the instanced side. Trap door wise should be like the floor safe, a door space u just slap onto any foundation. 
---
Ah man could dee some dr who fans making some tartus camps.  
---
I just hope that the instanced space is sufficiently large to get really creative with and not restrict the space and placement of the exterior.
---
Not looking forward to people whining about having to load up to access our vendors tho.
---
Maybe I'll out 1 out for the impatient monsters. And leave the good stuff inside for those who explore the entirety of the base.
---
I've DC'd a bunch of times going to Prime Cuts and the BBQ and from another players perspective it still looks like I'm there but AFK until I restart the game.
---
I just bought one from grahm
---
Posted about this earlier and people seem to have the attitude that if it hasn’t affected them it’s not an issue unfortunately
---
Also can people stop one shotting the legendary that spawns at the end? Like chill, there's 2 minutes left, let everyone else tag it
---
I wonder if the shishkebab buff will make it more viable with other enemies and maybe even make it a decent melee weapon outside friendly fire
---
I did skip all of that. It's just a bummer to not get to play content. Especially since I only get to play that choosing Raiders, and it's a shame
---
Have to agree. The only ones that failed for me were the ones where I was the only one on the ground chasing. One of them had like 8 people standing on the tent. The other one was me and another guy both level 60 trying to kill a level 100 murelek Queen with a bunch of driving mirulek kings. We got slaughtered
---
I get annoyed by people who kill SBQ quickly
---
I've seen people just stand around during the cook out event and the primal meat event, that's infuriating.
---
Only a 1* though. At least Fasnacht you had a chance at a 3*
---
To be honest, straight average prices is BS too. If some buys one for 10k, another for 9k, and a third for 1k, is the item really pricing at 6k? If someone overcharges and gets away with 20k, does that bring the average up to 13k?
---
They've been doing "more, faster" because of the shit show it was at release. It's less to do with balancing and upgrading the experience and more damage control. The few rebalance elements they have implemented are more than likely a precursor to micro transactions of some sort.
---
lol
---
Yeah I was being cool and making sure everyone could get some xp. Not gonna work. Just gotta mow that shit down like a shellfish asshole. It's the only way.
---
My shotgun is bugged,  has 200+ shells chambered and periodically adds more. Haven't to reload the thing in over a week.
---
Mines on a spawn point and I dont think it's taken any damage? I disabled my turrets so they wouldnt mess with the event somehow lol
---
Sure, but there's already a bit of this at Morgantown, and on bridge in flatwoods, think it'll be okay. There are a few different ways to get high ground in watoga so it becomes a King of the hill mode
---
Does playing the drums and not standing on top of your tent prevent the failures? This is my first go at this event since I got back once WL dropped.
---
Thanks.
---
I actually started the wastelanders story after finishing the run since I finally had time now to just slow down and enjoy stuff...
---
Then meat week immediately happened and then I was back to playing constantly for the limited time event items... lol 
---
(I got em all though so back to relaxing... I think I’m gonna take up archery now. Got my first bow from Graham and I’ve been having fun with it.)
---
So this actually seems to be caused mostly by people finishing their own primal cuts event and fast travelling to yours during the last wave. So please, just do your own and leave the rest alone. I did one solid and some high levels fast travelled in during the last wave, one shot the legendary and failed the event for me because of the glitch
---
I like Graham having a fixed location, but Fasnacht was way more fun imo. At Fasnacht the whole server showed up every time. Here, maybe 10 people max show up. Which is fine, but as a solo player I really enjoyed seeing the whole server get together to do a fun little parade and get cool rewards.
---
Nah, it’s very niche and not worth the increase.
---
I fall asleep every night to the sound of drums and Grahms sweet nothings...
---
-frank the other vault dweller: well i made a rug with his skin
---
The only thing I wish they'd do after this is making it so that it's 2 coins *per rank* of the card you're scrapping.  So if you have old cards that you were ranking up just to avoid clutter in your Perk UI, you'd be able to get the full value of what it cost to rank those cards up in Perk Coins.
---
If I weren't grinding rep and gold, I would be using my explosive expert and rocking the event with a two shot Auto grenade launcher.
---
This destroyed my framerate on multiple occasions including the colossal problem event, when it takes long to kill him, the wendego spawns corpses pile up and u get lik 2 frames per second 
---
I've also noticed that when meat piles increase in count, surfaces like walls and ground become a bit pixelated, which seems like a shader problem
---
If you have team mates that are still in the event, you can fast travel to them and you’ll rejoin. At least this worked for me, when I had 2 ctds during the event.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
*Satan's coming for you, hell's bells.*
---
Is there a way too loop this so you can just farm cloth and whatever else?
---
Have you played since BETA? It was actually a challenge at the start. I made a new character when wastelanders came out and it’s sooooo much easier now than it was before.
---
yeah yeah the rant all pretty but
---
can you describe how did it break? so people can replicate them? i have been running bloodied shotgun build since October and never run into this problem. Ocasionaly i got stuck in the aim view with the gauss one but running fix the animation glitch.
---
I've done a dozen Cookouts and roughly 20 Primal Cuts. There have been 2 Cuts runs that were bugged, the rest ran as they should. All Cookouts have gone perfectly, and all but one acheieved the highest rating.
---
I've already received the full Chally Outfit, the Backpack, the Brahmin grill, and the Spicy Tenderizer Plan/Mod (whichever it is). And today alone has brought in around 200 scrip.
---
If this is Meat Week being "broken," then I can't imagine what it looks like if it's "working."
---
Theres a pile of hay near the brahmin that you can deposit chally feed in one at a time with a short cool down between each. 
---
You can gather the large green plants that appear and deposit them in the "greens" cooler
---
Pick up the piles of bones that spawn or piles of poop the brahmin drops
---
Put out any small brush fires that pop up on the ground. 
---
Shoot squirrels and chickens and critters and deposit the critter chunks in the shopping cart next to the greens cooler. 
---
Deposit prime meats into the large cauldron next to the spit in the middle
---
Add firewood (in quantities of 5s) to the fire wood pile. Also a cool down.
---
Spin meats at the spits or beat the drums to stop the decay of the progress bar.
---
Especially with the two step goodbye, would make explosive dust. Playing tales of two wastes and going through the capital wasteland with those moves was the best time I had in fallout
---
This guy was probably a Nazi since he burned books and even has a WWII Paratrooper bag.
---
2200 hours in game
---
Fastest way is to create a new character, get the dress and then give it to your main. Luckiest way is to find it on a vending machine. 
---
I bought one last week + an Eye of Ra. 500 caps each.
---
I made mine with the idea he'd be a medic for the vault raids. Well at full health he actually was a huge liability in there because the heals just couldn't mitigate how little damage i was dealing. 
---
I took him low health and he's fine up to level 68 mutants. Queen fights are a struggle. It's very difficult for me to envision him being viable dealing any less damage than he is now but I guess we'll see.
---
the Prime Meat scrip events things out.
---
I agree, I completed the legendary run last night as well as maxed out raider rep so I can finally get my gauss minigun. 
---
Forecast for tonight: whatever I want it to be 😄
---
Man, I wish I had your luck. This is really frustrating for me. It has literally failed every time I have participated. Plus the server dropped 3 times tonight in a span of 3 hours
---
Definitely my favorite
---
no, i rolled it from the purveyor
---
I hope not. Imagine farming ridiculous scrip daily limits to get good purveyor roll, or buy legendary modules for a little chance to get a weapon you want, just to release a few levels better weapon?   
---
Sounds unlikely to me tbh.
---
the last 2 collections gave us the double score going on rn and the extra challenge week next week, not an item
---
thanks..for some reason i thought there was more
---
have you heard of turrets and traps
---
No, its RNG, much like many other things, you will be able to get it off him eventually, but he has about half a dozen rare plans and its always random which one(s) he stocks.
---
It's a great mob tagger!
---
Wow, looks nothing like the ingame .44. Thats very cool. I kinda wondered if it had a unique name or something.
---
Dude, if you are bloodied (I am bloodied too) you only need 10 diluted radaways, five radaways, ten diluted rad-x and 10 stimpaks. Just in case. 
---
Unless you take pylons during Encryptid, of course.
---
I wouldn’t be okay with it unless we could raise the level of GB weapons
---
I don't think they will, but, what would be the point of nerfing weapons that already exist just to release new ones that are as powerful as the old ones used to be?
---
That was Alpha, we do Bravo next. The one I want the most is the 50% Purveyor sale.
---
With a pa suit kinda like Coulter's in fo4
---
I've notices this, even happens at point blank range.. Used a missile once at a torso, 95% chance to hit.. Saw the missile go through the enemy and then through the buildings wall.. Missed countless 95% shots with rifles too.
---
Makes me wonder if I should just stop using concentrated fire in general.
---
okay, that shit is literally 100% Pay to win
---
The grind for legendary modules to craft gauss weapons was so awful, if they make the weapons I have now obsolete that would be it for me, I think. Never mind the effort that went into getting my non-gb weapons. That's a bridge too far
---
110 but it's possible to break hardcap
---
I think there'd be a meltdown if suddenly there was level 60 or 70 weapons and the value tanked on all the current max level stuff.
---
Edit: Spelling
---
Do these developers even play the game..they are constantly way off ' pfft' but glad the feedback helps out somewhat
---
I have max caps on all 5 characters and still do this.
---
Weasel too.
---
I'm XBone as well and it kicked me off about 2 minutes ago.
---
It is a level 5.
---
Love me some Fasnacht. Itching to get back at it again. 
---
Sometimes I wander through Helvetia and relive the memories.
---
No one except god Howard can explain the mysteries of fo76
---
Just wait for Mischief Night 😈
---
I'm really hoping we get mischief night again, that's a fun one
---
Agreed. Maybe Saturday will bring higher numbers to the events.
---
The only ones with notable loot are the ash heap and cranberry bog versions,
---
Ash heap always has a sheepsquach boss, that is always legendary, and the first wave is crickets (acid). Most of the time the boss is legendary at other events, but the ash heap is 100%
---
Cranberry bog has a ton of fog crawlers (fiber optics), and a behemoth at the end who always drops a ton of caps, ammo, and gear. This is by far the hardest one to complete though.
---
I also found a Gilded .44 in my stash. Have no idea where it came from. Im on Xbox.
---
Im disappointed. You're not even gonna include an image link?
---
Ever prime meat event I go to has this.
---
It depends. I got a Bloodied Explosive one some weeks ago, and ended up giving it to a Fallout friend who seemed eager to try it. I don't really miss it, I don't enjoy the explosive in combat rifles. 
---
I sold a Junkie's faster fire for 15K in half an hour.
---
To be honest, there are tons of fantastic weapons, and my bloodied SMG, for example, can kill the same. 
---
I keep a mutants faster fire Fixer in the stash because it will be equally effective if I decide to stop being bloodied. And I think one of my mules has a furious faster fire one too. But again, some other weapon are more fun.
---
The neon letters are 10K?
---
YES. This and Radiation rumble are the two places off the top of my head
---
Another Noob question about muling here: How do you get items from one toon to another?
---
I haven't been having any frame rate issues, nothing like the bugged line in the sand that bogs everything down
---
I have 40 prime meat just sitting on my character because you can only turn in so much at once.
---
It would be nice. I have all paints, so... I shall be a Captain.
---
 I like butt-stroking the tiny critters though, there’s something satisfying about taking my B3325 Handmade Rifle or my Fancy Pump Shotgun and whacking them with the buttstock of it to kill them. Makes a satisfying crunch sound. It’s also funny to punt a possum with my gun and send em flying.
---
I have not played an MMO or FPS that has not had various clipping issues.
---
All I have with this event are issues. 
---
It's a waste of ammo and a waste of time.
---
Pays out so well imo. I'm swimming in treasury notes after one day. I'm gonna hammer this event all week for sure.
---
I'm in favor of it too but why the hell did it take almost 2 years to fix it? Bloodied is all about risk v reward. I fear the risk will no longer be worth it because i spent a year getting accustomed to the dmg output of bloodied weapons. On the other hand, I don't participate in SBQ anymore because I can't even land enough damage to even get credit for the kill. Sigh... Better start hoarding weapons and test new builds.
---
Relog. For some reason when you apply the mods they don't work. But on relog, worked a charm!
---
One ahead of Zorbo for the *first time since the start*.
---
I wanted to invite Maggie over to say hi to dad.
---
Ive found a few queen drops got a bunch of ultracite plans not that i need them but its possible to find piles in that area as well.
---
Ehh. I prefer a colossal problem
---
its up now
---
Interact with them, that usually gets them moving.
---
just added it.
---
Lol Juicehead was using it in the Forest on level 50 Liberators in his newest video.... still took like three or four mags to kill
---
You can also shoot explosive arrows point blank and take 0 damage (no fire proof necessary)
---
Add me and I'll save my .44 for you: orias
---
I used to have the full collection of musical instruments in my vending machines, even drumsticks. They all look beautiful. 
---
In fact, I scrapped them all when I completed it.
---
I'm selling OVH and Hydra spots, #1 OVH is in Montreal Canada, #2 is in Straus France, and the Hydra is located in London. They're only $10 a month. My instagram is iAkira_v so  dm me on here . DM me before paying so I can show you how to connect it. They're great for preventing DDOs/DOs attacks on your home IP or connection
---
I just hope bloodied isn't say with 10%damage of other builds because you take the biggest sacrifice running it. I also think or hope beserkers gets a buff to be up there with top tier builds. The only reason I say that about bloodied is because I saw someone running damage calculations on the pts and anti armor was around 5-10% dmg lower than bloodied. At that point might as well run a low health AA build and with chems you would be higher dmg than bloodied without chems. I do believe bloodied needs a nerf and others need a buff but I just hope they execute it properly. Imo I think bloodied should be around 2x dmg and beserkers should be around 2.2x dmg since you have to take a huge sacrifice, Junkies I'm thinking 1.75x dmg and TS and AA should be 1.5-1.65x dmg.
---
Or at least mine is yellow and their are white or green
---
oh i usually use fire arrows the aoe is p good too
---
Still a bit bitter that my PA Helmet from that is low level and can't be scrapped to learn the plan so I can build a better one. At least I finally have the Tenderizer plan so I can get  Legendary one.
---
What causes issues for me is tesla ash piles amongst the meat piles.  Can collect hundreds of meat piles without much lag but just a few tesla piles and it's like 10 fps.
---
I never did this "meta" get to be, not once in my whole time. I only have 1 character, and I love playing him. I always liked the concept of Power armor. I always was a sucker for heavy weaponry. I started as a melee and went over to a heavy weapons build. No bloodied, unyielding or anything like that. That never interested me. I  happy to shoot stuff with my Tse minigun, rip stuff apart with my 50cal's (yes plural). Let me tell you, a TS grenade launcher is Hella fun.
---
I always played what I wanted, not what was op. And I still managed to reach everything I want. Kill everything I want to kill.
---
But I love the damage changes. It gives other playstyles a chance to be more common. Maybe I'll start my cowboy character after the patch? Because I like the revolvers in this game. Who knows.
---
You run out of ammo fasssssst. OTOH, Choo Choo!
---
I have e an anti-armor and it eats SBs. The ammo, tho... Even if the weapon is 90% reduced weight, the ammo adds up when it’s 10 shots a magazine.
---
I prefer this over fasnatch. That event was way too long. The robots walked so painfully slow. The music got annoying after your third time doing the event. 
---
So far every event for the cookout has been done under 30 seconds. Compared to the annoying 10-15 minutes the other one could take. 
---
I got all the plans for the event already, so now I just do it to dark treasury notes.
---
yeah
---
Yeah man, right be I took it hit, it freezes with that horrible noise.
---
yup yup, I tried that a bit after making this post and it's working now! it's kinda weird, but it works now so it's fine :3
---
Yeah, drove me bonkers when I put it on....
---
It’s server specific just find a new server
---
A bit unrelated but when is Bethesda gonna fix the quest “An Ounce of Prevention?” I’ve been stuck here for the past week and a half because the quest is bugged. Think about that for a second-one of the MAIN storyline quests that grant you access to a lot of the other quest content in the game. 10 days and still no word from Bethesda on this issue
---
Mischief night is more fun with all the car explosions lol
---
&gt;I've brought 3 new players to the game and do you know what made them give up? Realizing that endgame was just acquiring an unyielding set, a bloodied weapon, and changing their build to stealth commando. Realizing that they had to stack all the damage perks and tweak their build to do so. Realizing the perk card system and all of it's flexibility didn't matter, knowing 90% of legendaries didn't matter. Feeling like everything special they'd enjoyed so far was meaningless unless they could jump around in stealth and 1 shot 99% of enemies.
---
The damage nerf will turn the fiction you just wrote into reality.
---
You sir deserve an upvote due to your welcome contribution to the secret pun society
---
Just started this game earlier this month, I'm level 70+ managed to kill Colossus with another player who was 150+ or so, just x2 of us (everyone rushing for primal cuts instead) and I got a harpoon gun &gt;.&lt; Looks like harpoon gun is the common drop for everyone..
---
Yeah i noticed it but i was going for a space cow look myself.
---
I recently sold my Bloodied FFR 2 star for 7K.  The I decided to try Bloodied. My timing,,,
---
I agree
---
I don’t think anybody cares about being unique or special. Trust me, if you had to pay for the ammo machine or get it for free. People would still go for the free option.
---
I agree. Get the meat sweats and pass the beer. I am giving tons of things for free, dropping plans, etc.
---
My son... tater tott
---
I'm also sick of them targeting the traveling merchants.  They'll fire at them non-stop at ignore the actual enemies.   The turret once aggro'd Grahm and he started going ballistic, destroying all he could of my camp.  I had to hop worlds to get him to stop.  Fortunately, that only happened once.
---
Right like I shouldn't encounter a 3* legendary wolf that's level 5 doing leader of the pack.
---
How many hours you’ve played, and when you started playing are two different things. As I stated before. BETA to now, the game so much easier. It is bubble wrapped for entitled players who need Bethesda to hold their hand through the whole game.
---
The animals in these events are being hunted, for their meat.  Literally, that is the event.  It makes way more sense that they are trying to run away and not get slaughtered.
---
Some of the Season 1 rewards will be made available for a bullion cost some time after the season ends. There’s been a few threads here about this being available on the PTS right now.
---
I assume this will also apply to Season 2. And now I know how much effort it is to complete a season, I think it will be less effort to just buy the things I want from the post-season with bullion.
---
&gt; lock that player character from joining public servers
---
That is a weird request for an MMO.
---
Throwing knives are good to craft and use in a pinch. They do good damage low level and can be thrown during some reload animations, eg hunting rifle. I recommend picking up and scrapping guns dropped by enemies and converting the steel into throwing knives. That way, you learn the crafting recipes associated with each weapon while also crafting a useful backup weapon.
---
When are they doing away with hunger and thirst?
---
I think after awhile unlooted meat piles spawn into the world, happens a lot at line in the sand
---
I would like it too if wolves weren’t biting my fences all day😂😂
---
Yes they don’t do too much😂
---
I started with BETA as well...and yes, the game was different back then, but we were learning the META too...and no, they aren’t going to buff damage.
---
You’re lucky then lmao
---
ammo weighs a ton, small chamber, breaks relatively fast, cannot be used outside vats. can't sneak with it.
---
having said that, it's a great weapon with possibly the highest dps out of all rifles, if you can deal with the cons.
---
Who is that desperate though?
---
I started it like a month ago and am near rank 50. Will probably have to end up buying my way into 100, but first i want to know precisely when it ends just so i can rank up as much as possible for free before resorting to the rank-ups.
---
fair, but if you go on youtube and find some tutorials and stuff it may begin to somewhat work
---
Yeah I got it down to 9500 with my unyielding armor but I know caps don’t mean nothing anymore but I just now started doing the whole camp building. For two years I would just put a box up. Lol
---
Mine hard reset while trying to beat on a barrel
---
Okay thank you!
---
One of my favourite weapons was a Stalker's (+50%) +33% Vats combat rifle. Two stars only.
---
As a rifleman, I was delivering headshots without a miss. Always a critical, always a kill. It was a beast. I sold it when I got a lever with the same effect.
---
I'm sitting at 694 Treasury notes... you're telling me
---
Dude I found a scorchbeast graveyard at random like this. There were like 6 plans, loads of organs and probably 6-7 bones, all in one small area. How there were that many in one area is a mystery.
---
Well since I spent like $60 in the atoms shop yesterday I would have to disagree lol
---
Great galloping Bethesda Jesus. That's a shit-ton of caps for me. 
---
My dream of purple neon letters on my house just got that much further out on the horizon. :(
---
Can it be any worse than what they did with the ammo converter? 
---
Who am I kidding...of course it can.
---
Settings in 76 in gamepass don’t have any account info that can be changed. The Bethesda.net under settings lists my née ID and BUID. I may just see if they can unlink it.
---
It should say ‘It just works’ when you attempt to fast travel. After a couple of hours you’ll get severe headaches like commander sofia.
---
Probably nobody
---
I would rage quit the game so hard, it took me **F O R E V E R** to find all the weapons with junkies.
---
Damn that Nobody guy :-/
---
The real question is why does Bethesda like to put the dumbest limitations on absolurely everything? Damn it, call it grind incentive, technical limitations, I honestly just think it's stupidity
---
4 months later, but can confirm this works on console.   
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
I have like 250 of them sitting basically at all times, I would rather I have to grind a bit for them
---
I have done this several times. Idk what to do at this point.
---
The cooler is where they go.
---
oh okay, thank you
---
Melee and unarmed got murdered in Fallout 4 and 76.  Mostly unarmed.  It's really stupid how much they cut back on variety for unarmed, since Bethesda just seems to treat unarmed like an afterthought.
---
It really took them until 76 to make unarmed better, but only its damage, and pretty much accidentally, since both melee and unarmed are kinda broken with how powerful they are.  Unarmed variety still sucks shit.
---
Either way, for whatever reason, the hit detection for melee and unarmed sucks in Fallout 4/76 compared to Fallout 3 and New Vegas.  And I'm not saying that you strikes miss or anything like that, they hit, but the way melee hit detection works makes it so hard to hit body parts and other limbs accurately with the way the characters swing to the point where even if you're aiming straight at someone's face, you'll somehow end up hitting an arm, or a leg.  It's stupid, because it wasn't anywhere near as hard to do so in Fallout 3/NV.
---
That sounds surprisingly fun. No need for XP though.
---
Damn, that's worse lol
---
I had a run tonight where the enemies spawned far away and proceeded to run AWAY from the event area.
---
It has become time since it takes about a full 30-40 seconds for me to open my stash and use it lol
---
Like war zone it would be nice but omg the fps
---
Yeah like I got 28k but I don’t wanna spend it on them and then something amazing comes up lol I bought the mirror ball for 300 no problem lol
---
U/legatt 
---
Hey vault tech calling I read your post and I got a extra thing to mention to what you said. Ok so the nerf is great my build is basically weight reduction and search my guns are quad 1star so nerf is nothing &lt;lol nerf pun&gt; to me atm but I wanna mention that by September there’s gonna be an update revamping the legendary mob system and I’ve already seen the “phase 1” as my oldest called it which means that 1st bethsheda makes update that makes All enemies spawn around your level unless you enter events of any kind then it’s whoever is 1st so as a little picture to give my daughter was lvl 70 finally and she was gonna give census violence a roll and shortly after the desision our middle daughter mars said are you sure Kate didn’t dad say that the enemy spawns around your level and sometimes as high as lvl100 to give a challenge. Kate reconsidered as the event started and even with my friend they fought 4 ish waves of lvl 50-100 deathclaws. Just wanted to add that to what you said because i warned it almost a month before the update happened and the nerf can make defending a hassle for people &lt;pill size increased to mininuke&gt; its one hell of a pill to swallow but a bomb shell to do both in the strangest of ways. Tbh give me a 9mm 1911 pistol and a m1 garand in the game and I might come back the stability and repetitive board game shiz is a turn off for me . I didn’t grind and I don’t enjoy cheesey jokes that scream fo76 is fortnite 2.0... todd doesn’t seem to see some of the problems in the game that I found a fix for each that wouldn’t cause issues among the community and brings back players but I’ve felt ignored when trying to get the words out.anyways tough pill but understandable non the less but the game is going down and will captan Todd be there or will we have to abandon ship in the future? Well see
---
Finally a voice of reason, well said! Signed a hyper-optimized level 320 bloodied player that’s stoked about a balance change.
---
ya I stopped playing before fasnacht and started again after fasnacht and I heard it was a shit show. Some people have said they ran that event at least a hundred times and never not even once got loot from the legendary sloth.
---
So, on xbone, I’ve noticed the event doesn’t show up - last three top hours I  was in. I can see people  running around doing shit, but no event icon and it doesn’t join when I’m in the space. 
---
I’ve also had it in the past where I was there when it started and didn’t join me. I had to fast travel away (76) and travel back. Traveling to the event while there didn’t work.
---
I run 1 stabilized and on my level action rifle using a medium scope, it’s damn near still.
---
you don't.
---
Just wait til the Scorchbeasts start falling on ya!
---
I absolutely love this gun. Very effective, deadly, love the sound effects, even the reload one. There should be a mod that adds a 5.56 receiver but also does reduced damage
---
🤣😂🤣 you must be new here!
---
Today I spend around 3k caps in 308 lol. I don't like doing the ammo worshop so I buy them, as long as is 1 cap each
---
They’ve neglected to put something in so you can do the daily and weekly challenges for atoms once the Legendary Run is complete.
---
Works with anything that shoots multiple pellets at once, even The Dragon.
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
Fun. Yesterday the SBQ corpse was fast traveling with me.
---
I also noticed that today the loot was suspended in the air when I loaded in my it did not rain on me.
---
Ive found a few of those. I saw at least 8 sets of plans in 1 pile as well as bones etc.  Yesterday i picked up a legendary weapon from the bog area of prime cuts all loot from battles i never even participated in. Its a great bug.
---
Been buying different TVs off him every server hop.
---
Are they the right kind of cores? Ie ultracite cores cannot be used in power armor or non primed weapons, and normal cores cant be used in primed weapons.
---
I did find plans on the ground at SBQ yesterday as well
---
FFS seriously?
---
Sounds about right.  Thx!
---
Then they should increase stash limit since my unyielding armor will be horrible if bloodied isnt worth it...
---
Had that happen last night, although it seems to have been fixed today. Had no issues finishing the event multiple times in multiple locations.
---
Yes, I usually have all 3 as I need them for different things.
---
I can't do the one down in the Ash Heap. I was able to do it, like, twice, but then every time after that it freezes me and I have to reset the game. My fav is to do the one at Flatwoods because it's easy and usually over fast enough to jump over to join the tail end of one of the other ones.
---
Yea. Make it so we can actually kill each other in there. Obviously it would suck for the people trying to set their load out. But why give us the option to punch each other if nothing happens.
---
Sometimes they end up in your stash
---
Trust Bethesda devs to put a bandaid on a compound fracture. So. Stupid.
---
It jest werks.
---
NERF BLOODIED AND MAKE OTHER BUILDS VIABLE.
---
PC. I hope the magic weapons have reduced dps after the nerf.
---
Thought we all knew that from Day 1
---
Yeah it's really sad. I loved unarmed in NV and I love unarmed right now in 76 because it's so broken lol. I just wish the variety and mods were better like you said. I also miss the specialty moves.
---
Its been empty. It's like they are just disappearing. And I checked their power level, they were all 100%  yesterday. Today I didn't have any.
---
I grab absolutely everything and sell it to the bots lol. Glowing meat and blood have a good price and is everywhere with this event
---
Nah, I'm ignoring the raider stuff, there isn't anything that is worth infringing on my RP. :) Thanks for the thought though.
---
Hm, I'll kill 'em all and see what happens. :P
---
Do you use a gatling laser at all, or several?  I'm on pc, but occasionally I've noticed that my gatling laser will hold onto its core if I've drawn it at all this session.
---
For instance I'll have 30 cores according to pa hud, draw my laser and now my laser says I have 30, but my pa says I have 29.  It resets on sever change or logging or removing the laser from my inventory.
---
Erk. Thanks, I'll keep an eye out.
---
Interesting. I've yet to talk to anyone in Ward's daily, wonder if I'll get that option eventually.
---
Thanks, Ward's daily hasn't given me the option to chat with anyone after him yet, but hopefully it's random.
---
Dude, where's my Power Armor?
---
cranberry bog. Rad scorpions just get stuck underground
---
Yes, And I've had that problem. But the other day I modded it for prime ammo, and had it in my stash today as I didn't plan to do SBQ.
---
The whole point of the new “legendary run” system is no more atom challenges.
---
I basically got the polar opposite of a god roll on my Fixer.
---
I'm not even mad, because it is so horrible that it kinda makes it good
---
And won a world record in speed skinning.
---
In FO4 there was a CC item called the handmade shotgun or something like that and ones that dropped with ghoul slayers or incendiary had a special paint job
---
I'm glad it's just cores and not my armor
---
*”this game may work but you dont”* - idk some robot insulted me
---
same, just bought one off him an hour or so ago.
---
Post-nerf, my TSE Handmade is still rocking hard.
---
But my Instigating LAR, that was my main weaponpon pre-wastelanders - is now totally useless :(
---
I've got an AA backup I never sold, maybe it'll fare better.
---
Blood/I yield is stale meta shit that has sucked the fun out of the game. It’s like rolling stealth archer in Skyrim until your soul dies. I’m pumped to switch it up
---
Oh, just stop baiting the angry masses.
---
This happened to me even before Meat Week or patch 21
---
Me to. To bad you cant fast travel with it. Imagine if you could send it to your camp
---
Sure you were at the right event?
---
Lol, I typically drink spoiled milk since it usually takes about 40-50 rads for me to bump my health just below 20% after dying
---
I know the best meat-cook when I see it
---
Except it would be rated higher, a .45 in 76 a pistol round/submachine gun ala WW2 Thompson. The only exception is if you look at the lever action it actually fires .45-70 Gov’t rounds which would and do have a significantly higher per bullet damage than in game 5.56 rounds. That being said a .45 is a pistol round but a 5.56 is a high speed rifle round capable easily of armor penetration as in real life. The large caliber .45 is easily stopped by armor of any kind because it loses 90% of it’s kinetic energy on immediate hit. Seeing as every creature in game minus critters has some if not a massive amount of armor or resistances it all makes sense. 
---
So yes I would 100% agree that in game a 5.56 would, should, and does hit harder than a .45, not counting the .45-70 Gov’t lever action. For game balance reasons guns of the same ammo type do different amounts of damage and I do hope they change that.
---
I noticed this on XB1 as well, except the one time I did find him. He was just off a bit from the camp wandering around, not by the fire pit like usual.
---
Chally's in charge, leave any complaints with her. Then switch servers.
---
yeah, had the same thing about 2 hours ago. chally did her thing but grahm was nowhere.
---
So the next fair question is did you make prime cores and just lose track of numbers, make more than intended, or miscount how many you had before starting?
---
I'm just throwing out ideas now as I have never heard of this before.  And with how often I use PA and gatling lasers, I feel like if it were common I would have experienced it.  Assuming it can happen on pc. 
---
Almost seems like intense inventory lag causing things to not show up properly for a while.
---
Sample size matters. 3-4 doesn't make for good data. In the same way that basing your price only on trading groups, a tiny fraction of overall transactions, as per Fed76, is equally dumb. That's exactly my point.
---
Wait so we get tokens from scrapping cards or scrapping perk packs?
---
I heard someone online complaining about that a new character has a better chance or something due to more perk cards to open.
---
Can someone explain?
---
It’s hella bugged. Basically the health buff ignores rad levels. For me getting it bumps me from 20% to a bit over 30%, and I have to re-rad down below 10% “true” to get my “buffed” level below 20.
---
Other health buffs will jump above my rad level, but as soon as I get a wiff of rads, they reset back to my proper.
---
This ^ . It happens everywhere on a server that’s been up for awhile
---
You should find someone to make the rad barrel in your camp. It’s a game changer
---
Reading the comments it seems most people that have no problem with this nerf are bloodied builds. That build will be like how us normal non-bloodied/Junkies builds are now so I bet you won't have a problem with it. Since public teams became a thing I've noticed 90%+ people in this game run a bloodied build so anyone saying it's a tiny percentage of the community isn't telling the truth.
---
Because it’s *our* backpack
---
Sometimes I’ll have to spam click him for literally a minute while he walks around his room before he will open dialogue with me
---
This glitch will literally get you through almost anything, btw. Locked camp doors, whatever.
---
Never said "my backpack" ;)
---
i found the same thing one day, along with an NW pipe rifle
---
They changed how the backpack skins work so you don't have to craft a new pack to have a skin. Just go to your armor station and hit modify, select your pack, and now there should be an option for appearance I believe which will let you apply the skin.
---
Camera mode glitch works best for my when I go to the nuke silo. Or when I went to get through a door without picking the lock. 
---
The power armor glitch works a little better when you want to get in areas you aren’t opposed to be to begin with. 
---
I like to scare people by standing next to the purveyor or the vendor bots.
---
Stop fucking dying so much. Use your brains, reevaluate your tactics. The only time I died that much was trying to solo him, then I switched up my tactics and stopped dying.
---
Yea I still do the dailies for rep but it’s Nice to hit my 20 so easy
---
He can wander off if an enemy spawns.  He will go after it. I found him down the hill from his event. He was standing there next to a dead tic. I was able to find him since he shows up as a white circle on your compass. Like any other NPC
---
So since I exclusively run a non-bloodied/junkies stealth character with instigating weapons I should just stop playing. I'm certainly not going to go bloodied like 90%+ of players are now just to stay at the same level.
---
Ah makes sense thought it was a bug thanks man
---
”... you're the only reason for me to show up.”
---
Awwww - sounds like someone has a crush on good old Grahm...
---
Grahm and Ohnobabe sitting in a tree, K - I - S - S - I - N - G, first comes love then comes marriage, then come Chally Moo Moo in a baby carriage......
---
(Yeah, no, I don't know why I just did this post either...)
---
Um. /Market has “price check” as an option for literally this reason.
---
I’m not grinding out lvl 60 gear that would effectively be the end of my 76 journey
---
I noticed this started happening with Wastelanders, especially at Line in the Sand.
---
What a guy, he'll chase after anything if he thinks itll ruin meat week
---
I'm pretty sure the random, yet large amounts of meat and such being scattered around isn't a bug. I believe it's all the loot that people simply aren't picking up. It's just like if you kill an enemy, they turn into a meat pile, you enter another area or go far enough away and then come back, all the items will just be a pile. 
---
Though for items and corpses following you, I'm sure that's a bug though. Scorchbeast bodies following me after fast traveling was rather common lol
---
That's ridiculous. :/
---
Don't forget the nightmares she never shuts the Hell up about
---
I’d love it too, but this is Bethesda. They can’t even get combat numbers right, let alone pip-boy numbers (trust me, I know of several situations where your pip boy is not representing your actual damage).
---
You think they even know how to give you that much info?
---
You don't use communist backpack, communist backpack use you.
---
My love for the big mutant is no secret, Grahm is love, Grahm is life
---
It’s a bit silly.

They aren’t fantastic.
---
They’re throwing knives with an utterly useless Poison DoT.
---
With much rarer crafting requirementa
---
image is from 4chan.
---
Ohh I didn't realize. That's good stuff, thanks!
---
Whenever the armor says it just works, it kicks you out of the suit
---
One every 50 levels sounds like the worse grind tbh
---
ya he does sound like a tool.
---
Bloodied is very strong, PA with EP keeps you very tanky, only weak to poison/fire/bleed damage (which are generally rare).
---
Junkies is next best for damage, and “easy” but minor stat debuffs.
---
Anti armor is middling on Live but almost as good as Bloodied for my Bloody Heavy Weapons build on the PTS; we’ll see if those changes translate to Live.
---
Furious is good on fast guns as long as you understand how it works (changing targets resets the stack).
---
Two-shot is... eh.
---
Has anyone else noticed how many extra perk card packs we have been getting? Season 1 had tons. Probably going to be more going around and this system could be why
---
So you KINDLY called them A CHODE? You don't seem so innocent, princess.
---
What a party pooper hahaha
---
it was kinda funny
---
Turrets need an everything buff.  They should smell a molerat tunneling in from 100 meters and pre-emptively start unloading at it.  They shouldn't have to wait to be shot first, or wait for them to recognize the threat or whatever.  Turrets should use the same damn AI that NPCs use... they see a threat, they engage it at max range and max intensity.  
---
The way they perform is FUCKING EMBARRASSING.
---
You can’t display them however, also while I haven’t tested it yet you might be able to do the same with critter chunks
---
Instigating
---
Oh my god meta Todd bots and power armors would be fantastic
---
I guess I'd be for a Watoga map if the city wasn't dead center of the circle. I'm just not a fan of vertical combat. It encourages explosive use and it's just not fun when one person has a massive advantage over the other imo.
---
I feel the same. There was so much hype, I couldn't wait for it. Now it's over so quickly, I worry I won't be able to turn in my primal cuts before it ends. I swear half the time I fast travel there, I get the joining an event picture, and then immediately after the event completed.
---
I've seen it on PC but just a few times. I changed servers and he was back.
---
I’m pretty sure if you don’t pick up the meat piles after you kill and enemy the items that the creature would have had eventually just drop in the ground and if other people don’t pick up there’s eventually they will turn to items as well.
---
It won't be any better than it is now.
---
Honestly not that much is changing. The merf hype is overblown.  
---
You will need a couple extra shots to kill things, and depending on your build tweaking it with more damage (which will be easy thanks to legendary perks) can potentially get you back to where you are now.
---
Bloodied will still have the best DPS, and Junkie's offers the same ampunt of damage as Furious right away instead of after 9 hits. So, no, even if I think Furious is underrated.
---
It would be better if it said "it just works" every time you encounter a bug. But it would get annoying fast because it would be saying it constantly... also the PA itself would probably be bugged.
---
Use the recoil compensating stock, and long barrel. It's a beast in vats. It works with commando perks to increase damage. I use a bloody explosive/25 less vats as my main weapon and it's outrageous. 
---
Bandolier is your friend to offset the crazy ammo weight.
---
In theory it kills off the market for all the tens of thousands of duped items at the current meta. It would be a ham fisted way to do it, but in theory it would solve some issues.
---
Not saying I support the idea but I could see it having some purpose.
---
Of course he is. Grahm is bestest, BESTEST Super Mutant.
---
Hammer it like the town hooker. Right there with you man.
---
ok chief.  be safe out there in the wasteland.
---
That's what I figured
---
It was just one comment, I didnt expect a nuking in return lol
---
Indeed. Short, controlled bursts are best unless you're close enough that you're simply just not going to miss no matter what.
---
I love my LMG. I just wish we could mod it more.
---
Looking back, maybe a little funny
---
Ya iv'e had that happen a lot too. Also every time i encounter a mothman if I don't loot him within like 5 seconds hes gone.
---
Yes the Cap limit is annoying and yes Vending should be able to overrule the Max limit. Now the real question is why did you put up 10K Ammo for sale when you know there's a cap limit, it like putting 20 weapons for 5K each then have someone come around and buy 5 or 6 of them and you get mad cause you just lost a bunch of caps, don't sell more than you need to be selling. I usually like to keep my vending at a reasonable amount of caps and i always make sure im spending my caps on the Ammo i need or the Ammo i can potentially sell. I basically use Ammo as a form of Caps, cause i know 5.56, 5mm, 50cal and Shotgun Ammo will sell, so i buy everything that usually people put up for sale, then when im low on caps i put up the same ammo for sale in my vending and it usually sales quick. Im playing devils advocate here, just adjust to the mechanics until they do something about it, its not that hard.
---
Roger that
---
Personally, I just leave the Ammo Factory item you can buy from the Crater Raiders for bullion on .308 and occasionally collect. A guaranteed trickle of ammo is better than nothing.
---
I can understand the frustration though. Honestly though, with how often I'm murdering Super Mutants and getting gunpowder from them, Snallygasters and getting acid, etc... Lead and Steel become my major limiting factors, and Lead can be found at Lucky Hole Mine in abundance (using my Excavator Armor I can routinely come out with 400+ Lead Ore at a go).
---
The fact that a 3 star wolf can give me the same loot as the sbq i don’t bother with her anymore
---
So, the "put out the fires", "clean up after my cow", "clean up the rotting remains", "put critter gut into the fridge", "put greens into the fridge", "put wood into the pile", "turn the meats" instructions are not clear for you. Okay.
---
generally speaking bloodied will still deal the most damage. it may not be worth the downsides, though. but every weapon and effect will remain more or less the same.
---
furious will essentially be as good as it is currently.
---
Clean clown suit
---
found him chillin outside vault 76 this evening!
---
I for one am okay with fortni.. I mean pub.. nuclear winter dying off.
---
Arguably those mods give you a competitive advantage over others
---
They keep it in beta so they can leave it broken and not obligated to fix or change it
---
Remove the scrapping and reward perk with exp
---
I haven't noticed enemies just not spawning at all, though they rarely make it to the drum setup in a reasonable amount of time.  I end up checking my map for the quest pins on the prime enemies each wave and running to get them.
---
I think it's mostly pathing issues, especially when tents are around.  Or maybe I'm lucky not running into the spawn issues people talk about
---
Other day a robot in the whitespring threw a telephone at me.  I was so confused.
---
Making enemies spongy does not make them fun or challenging. It just makes combat tedious and dis-incentivizes me from even bothering to reach endgame in the first place. The game's already losing what little fun it had to offer as enemies sponge up in the early midgame and if they're just gonna get spongier and spongier and spongier the further on I play....why bother playing? It stops being fun when I have to hit a raider wearing a fucking t-shirt 30+ times with a fifty caliber machine gun to drop them, or 8-10 times with a .308 bolt action, or 40+ with an SMG, or with an entire magazine from a 12-gauge, and fun is why I play a game.
---
Rebalancing the game so Bloodied isn't the only viable endgame build is what we wanted, but Bethesda, in typical fashion, kludged it so badly they ended up just ruining the fun instead. We didn't want an across-the-board damage output nerf, we wanted Bloodied to be balanced against the other builds so they, too, were viable. I suppose if you squint at it Bloodied doesn't hit for 4x what the next best build hits for, so mission accomplished, but it's to the detriment of everyone playing.
---
Prolly just gonna go back to New Vegas and 4 where I don't have to worry about bulletsponge enemies and microtransaction bullshit sucking the fun out of the experience. Started a new Tale of Two Wastelands run and I'm fuckin' lovin' it. Got Medicine Stick now and it's pretty damn effective; one shot one kill just the way I like it.
---
Has anyone actually been banned for using those?  I use both the perk loadout manager mod and the better inventory mod. If I were to get banned for using the perk loadout manager mod I just wouldn't play anymore because that's pretty much a requirement in my opinion to efficiently play the game.
---
ricochet, definitely. I think I only ever get crippled from explosions, and that's what dense/fireproof is for.
---
My guns are all plasma cores. And my inventory shows 20 plasma cores, some I bought some I crafted. But my plasma laser, which isn't new to me, just won't load them. I don't currently have any ultricite cores in my inventory or my stash. 
---
I don't have any guns that use the fusion cores, didn't know that was a thing, or maybe I misunderstood, so it is possibly inventory lag with the fusion cores.
---
I'm guessing it's just a weird bug.
---
I’d recommend stop playing the game before you are out of a ps4
---
It's the apocalypse.    
---
IRL and in-game if you think everyone is going to 'play fair and be nice' 100% of the time you're not going to last long. People get bored. IMO when it crosses the line into harrassment and turning into a psychopath there's a problem.
---
Huh?
---
In FO3 the Enclave Tesla p.a. armor would boost the effectiveness of energy weapons (makes sense). That was my go to build. Combine that with a tri beam laser rifle and you had a really decent build.  76 should do the same thing.
---
Can they be re-used in the next event an hour later?
---
My vendors are stocked and priced so I can at most go 2k over.
---
I consider the cap an incentive for reasonable pricing and a quality selection rather than just dumping trash in.
---
How ever will I live knowing somebody was able to find items they need in their inventory faster than I can during a SBQ fight?
---
Probably
---
I'm sure it would be! Though, I would like to get the plan myself but I'm sure you're well aware of how most people are at the event lol
---
I want a power armor that talks to me no mater what I all ready thought it all the way though
---
When a fight starts it plays a little battle tune (like ed-e from FONV)
---
When your health is low it will say (A stimpak is recommend)
---
When you enter it, it will say (hello 76)
---
When you exit it, it will say (don't you love me)
---
At the end of events it will play reward music if you beat it, but if you fail it it will play a failure tune
---
There's more that can be added
---
They don't ban people for using mods, that's why the game lets you load mods. That's why ESO allows mods. They even said in an interview that they follow the popular mods for the game to show what features they should consider implementing.  
---
They WILL ban you for using third party tools, and clients like the ones we see in NW cheating, but those aren't mods.
---
I had a dead Scorchbeast (non-Legendary) drop out of the sky at some random camp in the far NE. I was able to loot and then it just laid there and twitched.    
---
A few hours later after getting on again, a dead Radstag fell out of the sky almost on top of my character. Nothing on it but still.....WTF.
---
I’m not saying they are a big deal but that’s what Bethesda will say. Not to mention breaking Terms of Service.
---
I finished my score board today with my FO1st atoms so I didn't have to.
---
Grahm???
---
Since when is he supposed to be there?
---
I got the info from here:  [https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/fallout-76-players-banned-overmods#:\~:text=Fallout%2076%20players%20have%20started,out%20before%20introducing%20private%20servers.](https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/fallout-76-players-banned-over-mods#:~:text=Fallout%2076%20players%20have%20started,out%20before%20introducing%20private%20servers.)
---
Or maybe it is clown shoes that the game encourages camp building and free placement of 1st tents, then doesn’t make sure events are coded to handle it?
---
Crit damage was additive which is why it was so irrelevant.  Bit it will become very relevant.
---
So downvote me if you want but it’s the truth. I don’t care if people use mods
---
What's really funny is when you go there and no-one else shows up. Me and sheepsquatch danced long after the event failed. In the end I was victorious but out of ammo and stims. I can't wait to do it again.
---
Am I really the only one who just bashes the critters? No need to waste ammo, weapon durability, or send them flying... Just smack 'em, they die in one bash.
---
I’ll buy one right now for 10k. Haven’t received one and am busy with life stuff.
---
Plans is a hard business to excel at, i tried it for a long time, but it never really worked out. I have a bunch of Mounted Heads that seem to never sell and i know that's because everyone and their mom has the same ones for sale in their vending when i visit. Ultracite Plans usually sell here and there, but it takes days upon days, not worth the slot. I have 1 Vending dedicated to Plans, im in the Forest area right behind the Flatwoods Church, so i tend to keep normal plans for sale like couches and beds and instruments, you know typical stuff, they sell alright, but not very profitable, i mostly do it just to have inventory and help out the starting players with getting some things in their CAMPS. I do tend to get my hands on some of those rare plans and those can sell for quite abit. Any Marine Plan sells, Robot Plans sell, Weapon Crafting Plans Sell, the bed and butter of plans for me seems to be Deep Pocketing for any armor.
---
Vending 1: Plans
---
Vending 2: Chems, Bobbleheads, Magazines, Serums.
---
Vending 3: Rare Clothing, Weapons, Armor, Ammo, Rare Junk and Mods (sometimes)
---
Vending 4: Pre-War Food
---
Pre-War food has been my bread and butter for my Vending for a while, i can't keep the machine stocked up, the demand is faster than my ability to stock. I sell every Pre-War Food for 11 caps no matter what kind, all of it sells.
---
It's confusing because graham isn't there 90% of the time.
---
It's just a " dangerous prime beast is coming followed by event failed"
---
But why?what happened?
---
Instigating for solo, furious for events
---
King of the vault where you have to try and get to the overseers chair but everyone is invincible it gets knocked back far by punches
---
How so?
---
Ehh me and my friend ran the one at 1am and there was about 12 people there. It ended up just being me and him doing all the work while every1 else sat around
---
Sorry. I went thru a week of this a while ago. I sent multiple reports thru ps4, submitted a ticket. But what they responded to was my complaint as a comment on a tweet that someone else had. But the things they told me to do didn't help. It eventually just stopped.
---
I had a few weeks of really bad right before the legendary race started where I didn't even want to play it was so bad.
---
I feel this, I have sympathy, sorry I can't offer anything that actually helps.
---
What fire?there is only a drum. And how long are we supposed to hit that drum anyway?
---
Honestly anything like this is great, a break from the usual monotony of dailies and events. I guess it could turn into more monotony though...
---
The source on that article is a year old post on reddit with a big mod message on it that says "Unconfirmed Rumor."
---
It wasn’t that glitchy to me but there’s no incentive to do it because all it gives you is scrip and treasury notes and I don’t need either
---
I think that's a little to much into endurance, when you can put those points in much more valuable categories like agility for sneak, perception for rifle and assault rifle damage and accuracy, strength for heavy and melee damage, intelligence for XP and nerd rage, you got the luck right though, high luck Is essential for ranged builds.
---
I didn't buy my set of brick at level 25.
---
Be patient lol.
---
The meat/metal pile forms right where the enemy died so if the body got flung and vanishes you'll have to go back to the spot it got finished.  Can even fast travel away get on with your business and come back in 5 minutes for the pile, if you remember where the enemy died.
---
Great, now I have the Charles In Charge theme song in my head, only with Chally, and I can't make it stop.  Thanks heaps.
---
I guess they had a beef with him.
---
It's definitely popping up the least for me, but when it does it seems to run at least twice back to back.
---
It makes you immune to scorchbeast screeches too, so it's almost essential.
---
I have this problem, I will usually look away fast so they disappear.
---
Easy until no one shows up. Still, it is excellent. Only change I want is npcs to show up like the overseer, Meg, and Paige.
---
Id say skip the comments.
---
I find that 2 heavy laser turrets on top of telephone poles with 1 spot light *kinda* works like I think an MG turret should. 
---
Even then they often fail to notice rad and mole rats. But they will savage a scorched or mutie.
---
That is partialy true but if you go to the Tos (terms of service) of bethesda it says you cannot use anything not autorized by zenimax

---
(They havent give permision for mods and violation of the terms of service is enogh to ban you)
---
Since you already got the real answer, because democracy is non negotiable!
---
Nothing in the atomic shop breaks lore? 
---
So Pipers outfit, the Mechanist outfit, and Maxson's battle coat dont break lore? The Mechanist who doesn't create said outfit until the 2200's? Piper who isnt alive until the late 2200's? Maxson who isnt alive until the mid 2200's? Yes, these outfits are from special bundles, but they are still considered and marked as atx items
---
Vault dwellers can just leave the Vault knowing how to craft an alien weapon? I mean its description pretty much states it's a straight up piece of alien tech. Where can you find these? Alien prods weren't introduced until Fallout 3, which if you dont know takes place over a century after Fallout 76. No mention of Zetan prods before that, or how anyone could get ahold of schematics to build one
---
The chinese were just able to fully reverse engineer power armor and create their own sets + jetpack in a handful of years before the great war? It took Wes Tek, the creators of the power armor, 3 years to create a new version (T51) off of their already completed T45 + frame. Then another 6 to make T60.
---
Where is it stated that the Enclave had Liberty Primes schematics? I dont remember any mention of that in Fallout 3, or Fallout 76. I wasnt able to find anything from the established wikis either. Not calling you a liar, but it seems like you may have pulled that from your ass. 
---
I dont want thing to get too long, but there's other notable things such as: Free states + monthman cult engineering their own jetpacks, Red Rocket's parent company having the capability to produce a unique power armor set + jetpack, Hellfire power armor (I get they tried to retcon this, but it was shitty), and so on
---
Not everything in the atomic shop is canon, not everything is lore breaking. Some things do add to the lore, where some convalute it. But you need to look at what the atomic shop is: a cosmetic shop. It's just a way to keep a steady income to 76 and they will add whatever they think will sell.
---
Thats udderly ridiculous. Idk where you herd that but Chad was the nicest cow.
---
If you're going low health unyielding, then you're better off just going bloodied at that point.  At least you can actually use damage resist perks and equipment.  Berzerker has garbage synergy with existing armors and perks AND it is more fragile than bloodied.
---
Or... If you are at max caps, the vendors won't sell and throw a message to the buyer "Seller can not accept payment at this time"
---
Lord knows I get some kind rejection message 9 out of 10 times when trying to put things IN my vendor.
---
I went to join an event and someone had blocked in the barrel totally with foundation tiles. Thanks, asshole.
---
I’d loot them if I could find them.
---
now pls feedback on the damage nerf!
---
I want a girl with a short skirt and a looong jacket *pause
---
They aren't. In fact there is zero evidence of them ever doing so.
---
I will finish it tomorrow, or one day after. Congrats to you :)
---
Better still turn the door into a wall, no picking. 
---
For the record I think it's dumb as shit that pulling the power doesn't disable them completely.
---
Blocker and serendipity are your friends against these monsters.
---
I’ve heard several people say that AA stronger then Junkies on the PTR. AA caps out around 28% damage Increase but is unaffected by the balance changes. Junkies lost 15-20% or more of its raw damage and it’s at 50% increase at 5 mutations and is affected. Not sure it can claim that second spot anymore.
---
You can still be crippled from explosions even if the explosions do no damage. I agree that ricochet is generally better, though.
---
I’ve also heard this. That’s why I just traded for an AAE25 Handmade :-)
---
I’ve been on a lot throughout the day haven’t seen it once.
---
There's also mods for them that reduce chem or food weights
---
In my camp there are always 2 lvl1 radroaches that are destroying my camp and the turrets are useless.
---
Yeah, lesson learned i guess. Never know who has control over a whole ass nuke
---
A companion app can be a valuable resource to you as you play the game - it becomes a 2nd screen and could allow you to do many things so you can focus more on playing the game. One aspect of Destiny’s app was inventory management - and not only could you manage what was stored and equipped on each of your characters but you could quickly rearrange and even take an equipped weapon from one of your characters and equip it on your current.
---
I think the skin would be better than an appendage.  Like a ghoul skin grip.
---
After doing primal cuts for an hour that drum time is my bathroom and coffee break.
---
When it came out it was the only new content we had gotten for a while so they stretched it the eff out like nobody's business to make it last.  Unfortunately, as is the case with many of their poor design decisions, they've decided to move onto other things without a backwards glance.
---
Unrelated but I traded for the same handmade before the PTS changes were announced. I’ve run a pretty off meta AA build since May she gotta day, it’s looking pretty crazy right now with these scaled enemies.
---
I’ve got nerd rage, not using any sneak stuff in agility it’s just not my style... I have dodgy/action boy/adrenaline/and 1 star of thru hiker.
---
In endurance I have 3* lead belly because I’m eating a ton of buff food all the time, and then 3* fireproof and 2* rejuvenated and *1 raidcool. 
---
Strength is maxed at 15 with cards to buff my death claw and damage resist. 
---
Char is 4 for strange in numbers and tenderizer.
---
May I ask what your build is? I was curious what an AA Build would be I’ve only ever had bloodied or junkie’s.
---
I read that as "The trash heap" for a sec.
---
Spent hundreds of hours building a character and it's taken away, yah, good.
---
I'm not here to argue if bloodied is good or not, it's something I've put a shit ton of hours of building. My personal perversion is seeing damage numbers creep up, no matter if it's one shot or not.
---
This will just remove a huge portion of my motivation and I understand it doesn't concern a lot of players, they're fine.
---
Same here.
---
Did this get nerfed?  I just tried them and all three were unlocked.
---
Just wasn’t sure if limb damage was doing some kind of backend damage to me I wasn’t aware of.
---
Can´t argue with that
---
I love Mischief night!
---
How is the way I enjoy the game come at the expense of anyone else at all? Reaping the benefits of a build I worked hard for shouldn’t be punished because some people haven’t been able for get there yet. I don’t get it at all. Games always end up catering to the worst/most causal sometimes younger players base. Kills it for the loyal ones. We enjoy the game as is, why kill the game that so many people are enjoying?
---
Shite!  Shite, I tell you!  Just give people perk points per level and ditch this perk scrapping BS.  If they did perk loadouts first, this wouldn't even be necessary.  They just want to create an additional grind out of leveling up, since they are running out of grinds that don't require new content, which has been pretty lean so far...
---
I'd suggest using refrigerated backpack mod. It will stop it from spoiling. You could always skip a few primal cuts. Each meat you put in gives you 5 legendary scrip.
---
And then it should have a legendary effect. 
---
*Constantly wanted by all players while equipped
---
I helped someone with this issue not long ago. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/idbykj/my_game_crashes_every_time_i_try_to_log_in_ps4/
---
I can get the possum backpack mods in a day now, just done it for the 5th time, the key is to focus on areas and not focus on one badge at a time.
---
I usually start the tadpole quest ASAP then by the time I’m ready for the possum badges they are pretty much complete.
---
Also never scrap things you’ll need until you start the possum quests, and keep the weapons you’ll need.
---
K
---
I had an event where a creature was running away from the event. I had to literally hop a bit across the map (outside of the event zone) to kill him, then run back to the event.
---
He didn’t show up on my radar - just seen him from a distance running away.
---
Does friendly fire still work with the shishkebab?
---
The music is the best part of Fasnacht! I even think of the parade and the song starts playing in my head.
---
Adding to this, I'd like to see a non-tan colour in my UI, thanks. It's a little excessive and can easily be broken up with variants or alternate colours
---
That's the problem.  It's knee-jerk rebalance that doesn't actually address the real issues with the game.  Considering the glacial pace of updates, that means you have a decidedly unfun experience with the chance they might make it better.  Might...
---
Plus my permanent camp is north and a little east of it and I would appreciate it not being nuked every few minutes or so lol
---
They need to just do a comprehensive re-balance altogether at the same time, not a lazy "lol we cut everything by X%" and they call it a day for who knows how long
---
I'll try a few cables, thanks for the tip
---
See I posted something like this a week ago and had every keyboard warrior on Reddit screaming at me on not telling them how to play their game.
---
Yeah, I can usually trigger it via spending too long world jumping, oddly or spending too long in certain interiors.
---
I think this is due to their fix to the goo piles and ash piles messing up spawns when that was an issue back then I’m pretty sure. This has been happening for a long time for me at least
---
Real talk I'm taking a dive from work one day this week for dedicated hammering!! Priorities lol
---
I have a quad explosive harpoon gun (WestTek drop) Ixm going to try this.
---
I think your link is broken.
---
Ah. Thank you. Apparently I haven't been able to do my settler daily because I had two many other daily quests?
---
Berzerker should be top since you basically have to sacrifice all DR and are far more fragile than bloodied.
---
Well, since I didn’t do unyielding I wanted a build that was strong but could also pass speech checks so I went with something pretty out there. On my phone but the gist is:
---
1 STR/15 PER/1 END/9 CHA/5 INT/14 AGI/11 LCK. 
---
For my lonely str perk I have traveling pharmacy but will switch to bandolier once I get more aid reduction. Agility is pretty par for the course, all rifle perks, co contested fire, and tank killer for more AA pierce. Endurance is Chem Fiend do psychotats, berry me tats and orange mentats last longer. Charisma is where most people wonder about my build, I’ve got rank 3 inspiration, rank 3 tenderizer, tank 2 suppressor and 1 in the fast travel perk. 
---
For intelligence I either run demolition master 5 or gunsmith 5, changing to repair perks as needed. Agility is rank 2 sneak, rank 3 covert operative, rank 5 adrenaline, escape artist perk, rank 3 gun fu. In luck I’ve got the basic mutation perks, starched genes and class freak, bloody mess rank 3 and good with salt rank 3. 
---
Replacing good with salt is hard as hell but I might opt into critical savvy or better criticals depending on how beefy the enemies feel. My legendary perks on every get them will be the 40% damage increase from sneak attack perks and maybe 2 in legendary luck for a critical perk for more burst damage. 
---
It works dry well on live right now, so if that doesn’t change going into the patch too much I’ll be quite happy.
---
Stealth VATS AA explosive commando.
---
Man I miss that fasnacht marching music so much. Oh I love the fasnacht collectron too.
---
Me too just like 30 minutes ago
---
It should also say 16 times the detail when you find a new location.
---
Try and let us know
---
The whole server except for that jerk in the silo waiting for everyone to gather so he can launch a nuke at Helvetia.
---
I played 4 hours today trucking around rotten meat waiting for the damn think to start.
---
LOL
---
Its not just camps. Seems mob corpses are not meat piling and de-spawning with the inventory just dropping on the ground. So the servers are slowly filling with loose items piling up that to seems to vanished in puffs of green smoke but its not wiping items fast enough
---
The best part of Fasnacht was the two shot explosive Gatling gun I got as a drop. It is my go to all purpose daily use weapon.
---
Just got off after doing 3 straight with at least 8 people each time.
---
Just unlucky, my server has had good attendance all night.  Including the AFKer on the barrel drum.
---
You, sir, are daft.
---
Remove the level caps on armor and weaps, have them scale normally... damage nerf becomes balanced with gameplay... problem solved
---
Genuinely don't understand the love for bloodied builds, sounds like a boring way to play to me. I came up with what I call a utility tank build, and it's great fun - none of the things most players complain about are problems for me. Heavy weapons and explosives, focus on Str, Int, and Luck. I can carry an army's worth of supplies (more stims, fusion cores and ammo than I could ever use), including 7 different heavy weapons, and still have 200lb headroom to loot junk. I genuinely don't remember the last time I died, probably 100+ levels ago (currently L180 ish). By far my favourite weapon is my harpoon gun - explosive and 4x. With the flechette mod it's rather like what I imagine you'd get if you crossed a shotgun with a fatman - with minimal damage perks does nearly 1k damage per shot, wrecks whole groups at a time. For bigger stuff, explosive .50 cal does just fine. 
---
There are lots of viable builds, just not for the CoD players that are obsessed with DPS. My own days as a tank taught me something important - the one who wins a fight isn't the one who can do the most damage, it's the one who's still alive when the fight ends.
---
You can scrap burnt books? I’ve been ignoring them because you couldn’t do anything with them in FO4, I just assumed it was the same in 76.
---
Lol more like you are confused but ok
---
So how does this effect the people who hate bloodied or junkies build?
---
Try Juice heads videos on YouTube, he does updates about pts. They changed them about two updates back though
---
My friend couldn't find her the other day. Told him to fast travel to Watoga train station. He did, she followed and he was able to loot her there.
---
If I can’t click on the event icon I just zoom in on the map as close as it will go and then no problem.
---
I can give you my car keys and tell you how to start it. Won't do you any good if you're in a parking lot and I don't tell you which car is mine.
---
You pick up what I'm dropping?
---
Fancy 44.?
---
Its been a while since iv used a tesla rifle but I believe it did get nerfed a while back. It’s still usable with certain mods i think. 
---
As for bloodied weapons the strongest is probably a bloodied 25 faster fire rate and 25% less vats ap fixer or an explosive bloodied fixer. Best of luck getting one though. The drop rate is extremely low and traders are going to want legacy weapons or half your inventory. Even after they were duped to hell an back.
---
Just bad luck :( I’m having same problem I need to offload this meat before it spoils but can’t get one
---
Edit: people have been finishing them fast. one time I just could get there quick enough.
---
it largely depends on your build. but generally speaking, probably an explosive gatling plasma one.
---
not aware of a tesla nerf but teslas in general don't deal much damage anyway.
---
I wonder if it's possible to find voice files for the game ? Some of the stuff in game would make great ringtones and other stuff. I mean, a phone alarm say "Attention Citizens, nuclear strike imminent" would make you wake right up.
---
They did. It's written right there that they have improved unarmed damage.
---
I hate when people moan about this balance nerf. It's completely fine.
---
I'm a bloodied mele/heavy char and I'm hit the most, yet I still 1 hit every enemy on the PTS, a few more hits on bigger enemies so what? it's still OP. 
---
It's fun for a while when a lvl 100 prime mirelurk queen comes out and 4 players shooting it with heavy guns takes about 10% of its life away, and then I run over and kill it with one hit. Woo go me look how awesome I am
---
And then the game just feels non challenging and repetitive.
---
I can melt SBQ in seconds with BFFR lmg and the biggest strongest enemies in the game die in 1-3 hits. I don't know how you can even justify saying this is a good way to intend the game to be played.
---
Visit the beach. Start counting sand grains.
---
The TOS of any modern live service game gives the publisher complete rights to discontinue service for you at any time for any reason. The rest is just there to give them something to copy paste in an email.  
---
So it's very much a question of what they actually do ban for, not what you might think they'll ban for.
---
I have found that just fast traveling away from your camp then right back will cause Athena to leave. Of course, even in the time it takes me to travel out, she can really put a hurt on my camp.
---
Strongest bloodied is Mele. Either deathclaw gauntlet or power fist. With the right set up you can look the sbq in 3 hits
---
I agree. I like not feeling the compulsion to log on just to not fall behind. I’m logging on now solely when I want to.
---
No, you’re looking for legacy ultracite arms with the jet pack mod
---
🤣
---
If your camp gets attacked a lot, you should move it.  When I was in the cranberry bog there were nearby fixed spawns, a fissure, and a random on load spawn of molerats or scorched, but my current location sees almost nothing.
---
There are some other ways to manage enemies.  
---
1. Build where there are limited approaches, like a cliff on either side, then aim turrets at the choke points.
---
2. Place a scarecrow and aim turrets at it 
---
3. Face your turrets inward, at your base.  They tend to prefer shooting within the area that they swivel
---
4. Rockets
---
5. Build your vulnerable stuff, like power, inside and use conduits.
---
So, what else they have to tell you?
---
"To get wood, look around, press E on logs if you are on PC, press else if you are on console, or scrap from junks at wronkbenches, and press E if you are on PC on the woid pile (wood pile is a pile of wood, wood is a grey looking logs, pile is a triangular-piramid looking pile)", "to put out the fire, look for fire (orange flames on the ground, orange is the color of the fruit orange, ground is where your character is walking, walking is what your character does when you press W, A, S, D on PC), press E on PC"?
---
It’s fucking boring. Like really completely and utterly boring. It has essentially shitty rewards that I don’t care about. I did several boring Primal Cut events only to have the actual even start and be completed before I ever got there because everyone donated the Max instantly. Definitely not making me want to log in.
---
Edit- seriously how is it rewarding at all? I might as well just log in to stand there and do nothing and still get the “rewards”.
---
Wym
---
Hate to break it to you, but bashing uses durability
---
Is that plus 100% damage at 0DR?
---
I'd take that.
---
And can we get an armor added for Berserker?
---
Doesn't for me, I've been using it constantly and haven't repaired that weapon lol
---
furious on a 2H is garbage. better off with AA
---
I don't really understand how they justify it doing such shit damage when it literally one shotted everything in other games.
---
I don't understand they have other weapons to be crazy powerful, but not the alien blaster?
---
Just make the bullets hard to obtain or something, or make it so it can instantly kill, but it doesn't happen every hit or works on bosses.
---
Gilded weapons are real rare drops. I never saw one, but they are darn cool looking.
---
Being competed under 30 seconds isn’t a good thing.
---
Check the Resources tab
---
Happens after a nuke
---
I've been having a blast with an AA SS super sledge.
---
Wait you guys have a Colossal problem?
---
You might consider the Grocer's backpack instead of thru hiker if you eat tons of buff food, I carry like hundreds of food all the time, well I carry hundreds of everything as I also use rank 3 travelling pharmacy... 🙄
---
Doesn't work. It's a massive oversite imo. This would so much fun.
---
It won't spawn for you.
---
With the damage nerfs coming and AA rising in strength, I think that's a good call.
---
Ya I did. I can't remember how but I know I looked up all their locations online. Look it up and make sure you have them all and then go and talk to her I think that ends the quest.
---
If you call the backpack grind massive compared to rewards... I have some really bad news for you lol
---
It's not about individual camps it's about total items on a server. Also when you layer items using exploits it eats a lot more resources then if placed separately.
---
I found it in a vendor tonite. I'm not setup to see what it can do at max, and I'm still hitting home runs.
---
and make it says "sixteen times the detail" everytime theres a graphic glitch
---
It will eventually respawn but I can't say how long it will take. My CAMP is next to a Power Armor spawn location and I farmed it for a while to get my full sets of 45, 51, and 60. There are a lot of spawn points around the map though, Watoga has like 4 or 5 spots alone.
---
Yeah tried that, just my collection vendors and ammo converter there.
---
If you take a set of power armour from a power armour spawn site, and the hop into another server, the power armour has a chance to be there. Based on standard spawn rates and if anyone else in the server has snagged it. My friend and I use this sometimes when we are trying to get a set of power armour or additional frames.
---
I just hope the ten that show up actually do something.   I've done about five so far.   On the last one, I noticed no one was on the drums.  (Without that, you're just putting air into leaky tires, as someone else here said.)   So I got on them and noticed the bar just went nowhere.   I guess that means no was was putting in anything?   No greens, critter chunks, prime meat, wood, Chally feed.....all just standing around with their thumbs up--eh, never mind.   On all of the other four, everyone just nailed it, and it was such a blast.
---
Why should we have to pay for something that was already implemented for free in fallout 4? Not even a new feature. They could've just added it in at any time, instead had to wait 2+ years for a basic feature that was already in the games files?
---
You can pull over 300 lead/crystal ore from lucky hole mine easily.
---
That one was much lower player (lvl 30, I'm lvl 150 xD). But I just wanted to kill them, didn't wanna grief them or take their loot. I tried to add them and give back their junk cuz they never came back, they refused me lol.
---
Try sending in a ticket to Bethesda. I had an issue with a daily quest that would stop mid start every time. It took them a little bit, but they fixed it.
---
This. Ty
---
Are you telling me your sick of playing "The floor is Fire" in the pre-match lobby!!
---
I “bitch hide” on the pole as well.. but I’m a lvl 68 bloodied rifleman with ass for a perk-loadout that I’m currently fixing.  
---
The poor guy could have just been a bloody that ran outta ammo. We’ve all ran out or had a gun break before.
---
I’m sorry this interaction left a bad taste in your mouth though, man.
---
I’ve been lucky so far, in fact I get really confused because as soon as the vent starts within 30 seconds we’ve beaten it. I don’t even know what to do other than shoot critters.
---
I finished waste landers, and when i went to go see the overseer she said “if you ever need anything always be sure to stop by” so i figured my missions with her were done but it still says follow the overseer journey
---
Nah. I do a clean camp with clean aesthetics and that is my nature in real life.
---
I don't understand your question, If you mean the Overseer mission where you get rid of the Holotapes, you need to collect them all and talk to her about it, then the quest will be done and you can drop the Holotapes. I can't think of another potential unfinished overseer mission.
---
I read somewhere at some point that logging out while someone is currently shopping can cause your vendors to empty like this.
---
Just scrap her station
---
Only in the video game industry to people get away with selling half finished products.
---
The ONLY industry. It needs to seriously stop.
---
Yeah, i bought the pack and made a bunker camp surrounded by fence fully (except one entrance). It was the only fence I enjoyed building and could use my 15k steel xD I put it around because it's indeed very cheap, if it breaks it will be nothing to repair.
---
Oh no.   Geez, I was really hoping this was the solution.  :(
---
I don't know what Emote your talking about but is it like the 'Socialist Fraternal Kiss' - you have been warned.
---
Toggle the locked items, might have no resources, you need corn to build it. It's in resources tab.
---
The overseers journey is completed by finding all her holotapes out in Appalachia. All the locations can be found on google. :)
---
Yeah I mean it was like a feeding frenzy, I would help set it up, collect all the stuff and get the parade started then jump up on a roof and watch then wait by the fire once it was done because unless you was a one shoting the enemies you wouldn't get a look in
---
Curious as to why you think this would cause it?
---
Yeah the ammo might weight a lot, but you only need Steel to craft them, so..
---
It seems where there are people on the drums and spots as the event starts the countdown, the actual event is much easier and faster to finish.
---
Not very hard with three in the 250-300 range.   Just everyone kill as rapidly and aggressively as you can.
---
It comes with a helmet variant that looks like Todd’s head and blasts “Sweet Little Lies” as you slaughter mutants.
---
There's more holotapes of hers you need to find
---
I had a camp next to power armor spawn, once I took it and changed servers it never spawned until usual cooldown is over (dunno if there is any, but I think there is). Same with a caps stash there and a bobble head. Once I took it, it wouldn't spawn until some time passed even if I changed servers.
---
Eh, it's more of a community event than a challenge. 
---
Just a quick way to get some unique items/plans.
---
Also the primal meat events are good quick legendaries and bullion/scrip.
---
It really is.  This is not an event where you can worry about sharing tags.   It will fail.
---
Last time we had people building their camp around the drum and blocking it off. 
---
I'm also not seeing death platforms this time either (elevated platforms bristling with turrets that grease anything that spawns)
---
Thanks :)
---
But the real question is: Was it designed to keep communists out or to hold them in??
---
I’d nuke you too if you called me a chode for love-tapping you.
---
Ohhhh, that's it. I always have locked toggled. Didn't know it took resources to build. Thank you.
---
Can you stack one on top of the other, been trying to build a fence that stops even marsupials from just jumping over it, i want the entrance to be the only entrance.
---
If you drop the nuke a little above the mine, there's like tons of yellowcake, cobalt and crimson flux to be farmed as well as a lot of creatures spawn for other materials. Spent like 2 hours in the zone above, 2 groups of scorched spawned right at me and I got those sweet high radiation fluids and masses and a lot of flux.
---
Try walking to a close by area and then fast traveling. That usually works for me. Someone one explained that it's kind of like a grid and if you can't travel from that square, try from a different one.
---
My camp was there before the god damn event, do you honestly think I would choose to build my camp in a place where yogis will tear it apart every 15 fucking minutes? Yeah let me move my entire camp I spent several days on just on a whim for you. Ignorant self centered toddler.
---
No problem. I had this too, until a friend told me I need corn for it xD
---
Hi, it works, cos my team mates were in the Colossal fight after the second nuke fell on the queens fight.
---
Yep, like everyone said.   How to identify them?   Big, leafy, very green.   Many leaves coming out from a center.  Take a look at this video, at 2:24.   The guy practically jumps over one of them to get to the spit stage; it's on his left.    
---

---
I wonder how well that would work on my old iPad? I haven't really used it for anything else in ages.
---
These places were not events and didn’t have mob spawns before now.
---
I do that periodically, but I like having the daily quests since they have given me some great legendaries.
---
What is the cap max?
---
I've seen some people build their camps as close to him as possible then extend their gun turrets around his little shed to keep him safe :)
---
The Whitesprings, full of fearsome ghouls that will swarm and destroy you if you dont go in prepared!
---
Fritz: (swinging a golf club) righty-ho. Perfect place to set up camp!
---
I've seen if happen once or twice before this last patch. Since last patch though i've seen is constantly. 
---
It's got something to do with the items being left in meat piles and loot bags not being removed when they expires. So all the junk starts to build up, which lags the server even more. It's especially prevalent in places with a lot of player activity like events, the nuke silos, and the area around FS Prime.
---
You get a small backpack from overseer's mission. You get a standard backpack (which doubles the weight) from tadpole missions and you do not have to do them all, only like 3-5 of them or so. Tadpole challenges are way easier than Possum and give you a backpack with +60 weight at max lvl. But Possum backpack modes are way better. Also once you enter the rows of Possum scouts you will get 1 badge for completing Campfire Tales event every once in a while. You can get a backpack mode that gives +120 carrying capacity at max lvl. I say it's worth it and it's not too hard or grindy.
---
Wait, you can scrap perk cards?? What??? How do I do this? I have so many multiples of cards. I've been hearing about these legendary perks but I haven't actually seen any in-game, can someone clue me in?
---
Got a chally backpack plan for free by asking a guy what backpack he was wearing, gave me one of his spare plans 
---
Traded the plan for a bffr lmg 
---
Traded the lmg for a Be25 fixer
---
Free be25 fixer :)
---
Really hope you enjoy the gauss :))
---
I'm not so sure that they could have, considering the considerable issues they've had with display cases in the past.
---
Wait they give you legendarys?!
---
But then you wouldn't have any reason to slog back and forth across the entire map fighting high level enemies in exchange for a shitty gun!
---
Yeah I had this happen all night for me. My favorite was the SBQ.
---
That's cool. Could they also finally fix the 1-hit kill glitch that sometimes leaves the enemies with full health after you sneak attack them for more than their HP?
---
Between the Meat week grind and Colossus (on PC) I've gone up a few hundred in under a week. It's great.
---
https://youtu.be/L3smS2lxO_w
---
After a ton of trial and error, I got it to work by getting the flooring as close to the front of the door that doesn't open as possible. I was able to get a piece of  flooring to connect on the other side.
---
Too many screens would die from the controller being sent through them.
---
It doesent work on orbital strike beacons because of course not
---
This is a classic MMO problem. Nerfing abilities that don't work the designers want in PvE fucks up PvP and nerfing abilities because they are too powerful in PvP makes PvE flat and dull. 
---
Since we can just choose not to engage in PvP, I'd rather have broken PvP builds than fuck up the main game.
---
Yes, because playing the drums before the countdown gets to 0 and the event starts for real actually increases the bar by a good amount.
---
I just started with Bloodied two weeks ago. It’s definitely not boring - juggling dads and health and the absolute need to be stealthy is quite interesting. I am aggressive so I do get into trouble a lot. I’m not a DK or DH with self heals, so... ouch. 
---
My problem is I like playing. If Alts were easier in terms of sharing grind, I’d be all over the place with builds. My wife went from stealth commando to Power Armor Gatling and she loves it. 
---
I’ll likely go back to full health stealth and not worry about bloodied. Or maybe not.... there’s some other stuff I want to try.
---
Haha, I can see it now. The Overseer standing on stage drunkenly yelling out "Party, Party!"
---
Fair enough. I’m just not feeling it as much as I thought I would compared to how people talked about it.
---
💪
---
I put on hard bargain, ate grape mentats, put on a level 1 magnetic personality, only 4 charisma, and joined a fully bonded casual team and got it for 8,750 caps.
---
So does Raider Punk!  And the worst from him is "How Now Brown Cow" or something stupid like that.   At least he isn't a syncophant who goes back and forth endlessly between horrible things and how utterly amazing it is to be with you.  ugh
---
It took the Catholic Church hundreds of years to agree the new meta was earth going around the sun. Pioneers of that movement were jailed. Don't give up the fight based on mob rule!
---
Raider Punk and Sophia do.   FWIW, I think I get more with RP.
---
I’ve had this problem AND my carry weight keeps drastically fluctuating without me drinking/ eating anything special or messing with my perk loadout. 
---
It’s pissing me off because it went from 360 to now it’s at 235. 
---
I stay overencumbered now with a full stash. ):
---
I believe that the only thing you can do in Ward's daily is to allow the Raider to keep the item, you can sell it to them for them to put in a good word for you at Crater. But, I don't think it affects your settler rep negatively, however, and it the last time I did that it just ended that quest. 
---
There's really not much consequence for anything you do, either way, eventually, you can gain full ally with both factions and not lose any reputation after that.
---
They were so terrifying in fallout 4. They seem a bit meh now. Maybe because there are now bigger and scarier things out there.
---
I don't see anything different this time around from the last time with regards to AI pathing. They were far away before too and had to be proactive. It sucks but it was what it was. However I have noticed after the 4th wave and final enemies the event not concluding an failing.
---
But what's the point of extending. The bread and butter is the hourly event.
---
You made me burst out laughing.   Thanks.   :)
---
That sucks! Sorry for bad info.
---
This ^ if he wasn't around for it last year, it'll be a real treat for them
---
Yeah movng entirely built camps never works great.
---
Higher intelligence lets you learn plans easier when scrapping.
---
Take some items that boost intelligence like berry mentats, then craft&gt;scrap&gt;craft&gt;scrap&gt;Etc. Since crafted items allow you to learn plans.
---
Does that work for the tenderizer too.?
---
Interesting...I try not to, since I think it's rude. But I'll keep an eye on that.
---
It works for every other armor/weapon in the game aside from gold bullion plan items.
---
Thanks ill craft a load and scrap them.
---
Because of this mixed with atlas &amp; legendary run auto completes I just started a new game. MMO are just not worth it.
---
So I played the drums for the full ten minutes before the event, put in my prime cuts and Chally Feed, gathered some greens and cleaned up messes quickly, got back on the drums, and it stayed at 50 percent.   It looked as if the other players were just standing around; does this confirm that that was exactly what was happening?
---
Id wait until you are level 50. You wouldn't want to get a good combo on weapons or armor and have it be low leveled. As for Purveyor Mumbles, 2 star on weapons and 3 star on armor is a good starting point until you grt to the point where you are drowning in Scrip.
---
I completely agree, it's ridiculously frustrating especially when these events roll around. That system needs to change, the limits need to be raised or removed at least for the scrip for selling legendaries. 
---
Having to fiddle with the inventory interface every two or three minutes of playing this game isn't fun, I want to run around shooting things, not balance my carry weight and play cards the whole time. It's hard to be immersed in the game when you're having to play Inventory Simulator 9000 instead of Fallout 76.
---
Yeah, but sometimes you might disconnect from server or accidentally be sidetracked or in a hurry to leave. I’ve done it a few times to friends. And I’ve had it done to me lots.
---
It’s worth a shot to check out! And then at least you’ll have your answer! Best of luck. I know how tedious it is to restock full vendors with custom pricing.
---
Hold up i was doing research and supposedly the plans for tenderizer are actually given to you as rewards from the meat cook. I am not sure anymore.
---
People running around hitting each other while they wait for shit to happen is normal.
---
They did that during Fasnacht. They do that during the wait for the rubble to clear at the ACP event, they do it at Meat Week. I use a shovel because there can never be enough BOING BOING BOING :D
---
I used to sell ammo until you'd get some arsewipe come along, snag all the free ammo (I am a magnet for 5mm and 45) realise it didnt count towards the challenge and buy 3 separate bullets. Screw you. No more free ammo for anyone.
---
Just finally came back to this game after 9 months once i heard about this. I cant stand the bloodied madness and it just seemed like a chore to try and get a full set. And there is one thing that games should NEVER feel like is a chore. 
---
And also it make so much sense that explosives should be buffed. I mean how tf does a punch do more damage than a mini nuke?
---
YES. I missed out on FIVE events tonight with my friends because of my inventory struggles.
---
It does not help that my carry weight keeps fluctuating even more than my IRL weight does, which is saying something. And it’s doing it for no reason that I’ve found so far. 
---
I’ve rage quit a few times due to the carry weight issue.
---
If I wanted to micromanage my stash every 5 minutes, I would not be playing fallout.
---
I'll have to give him a try. I enjoyed the quest lines for DaGuerre and Beckett, and was disappointed that the others didn't have any. Wanderer drove me crazy with guitar plucking and Forager with his farting. Guess it's time for a change.
---
I suggest lvl 50+, but if you're tempted, lvl 40 would be a good start. Now type of weapon, depends solely on you. If you're maxed Scrip, 3⭐ is costly, but a luckier chance to get some great weaponry.
---
On the Beth launcher just select the games tab that opens up all the available games and it should show as a download right under Fallout  76.
---
Pics added :

---
No, they vanish. Just like chunks. I had to answer the phone during one of the events and had no time to deposit chunks or greens and when the next event was up the game told me that I was missing the items when I tried.
---
Same I have had the one in the cranberry bog insta-fail as soon as the *dangerous prime beast* spawned several times.
---
Its not a bug its a ~~feature~~ creature.
---
The devs don’t want you to play their game, every decision they make just punishes the most committed players, and implementing walls to prevent how much you play every day. The devs of fallout 76 don’t want long time players, they want daily log ins of max 1 hour play time from the most casual players
---
The way Graham says Chally... Reminds me of "ouuch Charlieee."
---
Then go one minute earlier.
---
I love the fallout 76 community but holy crap you can be a bunch of moaning bastards sometimes
---
That would be alot of fun.
---
Yup, totally this. Anytime you are moving a camp, just assume that you will have to rebuild it from scratch. You might get lucky and be able to place down the large blue printed pieces, however, often times you will get the 'this item needs support' error and you will be forced to dismantel the blue print and build things piece by piece.
---
Im  2h melee bloodied unyielding  and the sbq can kill me instantly. Most of the enimies during that fight kill me in one hit. My damage makes it worth it. This will not only ruin my build I am going to have to change my whole play style.
---
Or just keep them in FO1st
---
you hand them in during the event grahms cook off, in the middle of the event area you can interact with the grill under the roasting yao guai or the large pot to hand in your prime meat 5 at a time, total of 3 times per event.
---
You need one perk coin to take off legendary perk from slot.which means you will not swap the legendary card freely. I believe you get perk slot at 50 75 100 150 200 300.
---
Grocer backpack, travelling pharmacy, pack rat and some  random weapon/ammo weight reduction effects on armor turn you into a living stash.
---
I probably carry around more than I actually have in stash.
---
And yes, I understand you have to give up some damage in the process, but the quality of life improvement is very significant. 
---
Just my 2 cents eh. 😊
---
you can find gatling plans in enclave vendor
---
I’d cry as I’m bloodied.
---
Reminds me of a saying my buddy tells his girl "if your gonna smack a dude, u might wanna make sure he isn't a wife beater"
---
Nothing pops up when I go to those.
---
You have to get the mod plans to drop during the Meat Week event. Cannot be learned through scrapping.
---
Save until you hit a 1000 scrip and then redeem just enough to to refill it with your daily 150. That way when you hit 50 you can spurge yet you'll still get some items along the way.
---
\*confused\* Isn't the intention of using a Tesla to be polite by tagging things \*without\* one-shotting them?!
---
Ok thanks ill keep grinding.
---
And so the beef wars ravaged Appalachia...
---
stick the 1\* legendaries in your vendor for 50 caps. people buy them.
---
use your friends to transfer stuff to alts for storage. get rid of excess aid and junk and ammo. I use FO1st to do it and every week i have a proper clear out and i get my stash weight down to 350. Feels good man.
---
If's a server specific shutdown, not game wide maintenance. Just go to a different server.
---
It's just a stepping stone to the Possum back, which adds 120 lbs.   Well worth it.
---
They drop as plans from Meat Week. Scrapping doesn't work. A bit stupid considering that a plan is not among the guaranteed reward pool but that's how it works.
---
Grahm is so funny and Chally the moo-moo is so cute.
---
Not the same msg as usual to say that is the world that shut down
---
\*\*lets play some Fallout!!!!!\*\* -in my head
---
"yeah yeah yeah I'm almost ready" -me 45 min later telling my friend I'm almost done trying to get my inventory under 200 pounds
---
You'd still outdamage most, and frankly you can count on one hand the enemies who last more than a few shots, at least at the moment. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
It is next to a cooking station in camp. Like the previous person said, it is only during the event, at the top of every hour. And once event starts it lasts only 7min, so your window is small. Also...some is bound to spoil, because you can only turn in 15 every hour
---
i think harpers ferry and watoga sell the heavy combat plans now
---
I will not give them the benefit of a doubt, they know what they did
---
All I did was die and I failed the event, spawned basically back in D.C. and couldn't get back to the event before they completed it.
---
Bigger problem I have seen is an empty supply drop following everywhere I go. As a warning, DO NOT look at any that are already there. They will follow you
---
It seems that you're right, strange that I have maintenance msg and not world shutting down msg but fine
---
I had that exact bug on pc well before wastelanders, just before the vault raids fucked up the whole game for me.
---
I do love the events that force people to cooperate or fail, breaks up the monotony of just shooting stuff
---
My camp is next to - it has been popping up all day for me (and annoying me as I try to renovate my CAMP - the monsters go after my camp and start destroying walls while I am building)
---
Travel one minute earlier to an event that doesn't yet exist?
---
Same here, I missed the last Meat Cook because for some reason I was over-encumbered by 5 pounds and I couldn't resolve it in time to get to the event. 
---
I really want something done about getting rewarded missles, armor, mini-nukes all of the time; every freaking time I get those things, I'm having to go into my inventory and drop them or scrap them, and it's asinine. Those things are helpful up to a point, then after that, they are utterly useless. After you grind forever to get bullion for a set of armor, or grind at the purveyor to get the armor you want, another goddamned piece of heavy or sturdy combat armor is no good to you. After Level 50, that stuff should stop, you should get rewarded scrip, ammo points, or bullion, stimpacks or something useful instead of missiles, mini-nukes, and armor. Fallout has always had a tedious interface, but this version of it is like it's on steroids and it's too much of a pain in the ass. I feel like it's due to the arbitrary limits on everything in this game that have exacerbated the tedium of that interface, there's simply not enough of a way to mitigate the weight issues within the structure of the game. Some of the limits need to be eliminated so we can enjoy this game instead of dealing with this stupid weight issue all of the time.
---
mischief night crashed my xbox 99% of the time, only ever completed it once without a crash.
---
I think it's also a problem that loot is meaningless unless it's a legendary.  The only reason you fight any monsters is to find a legendary one, or to gain XP, which is *just* to satisfy seasons challenges.    
---
But yes, I think combat has needed an overhaul from basically the start.  Without the actual balance, this nerf is just going to make people feel bad.
---
Yeah that's what I usually do. Still seems hit or miss for me (pc). Depends on the event and how clustered the players are too. Meat week seems to be exceptionally bad for it
---
I'll be working almost those exact hours lol
---
Maybe it's Bethesda easing u into the nerf? They must like u
---
Nothing about a wrapped cap fix, unlucky
---
There’s going to be a 50% off purveyor sale here pretty soon so I’d hit that up. But like everyone said it sucks getting an awesome weapon or piece of armor that’s low level, it becomes useless really fast because of how quick you get through the lower levels
---
This is going to hurt only casual players. When they fix magic weapons, there wont be any more of oneshots (unless they use HACK - not hacked weapons). People will complain that they wont make SBQ in time. But personally, IDC :D I have everything I wanted. GL
---
buy whenever you feel like something. will get some nice stuff to make your way to level 50 fun and easier.
---
Just buy 2\* items in the interim.
---
There is always more scrip. 'saving' to level 50 is not necessary.
---
Wasting our time
---
I bet you're carrying a buttload of stimpaks and food.  Meat week is not a time for caring stimpaks, it is a time for celebration. Live for today, for tomorrow may never come.
---
When does it end? I’m currently on 80 so think I’ve got about 2-3 weeks left
---
I haven't been back to meat week since launch day. not worth the frustration. Rather spending time dropping nukes and farming SBQ and flux components.
---
Ultracite heavy ammo stockpile is growing nicely.
---
Easy treasure notes...pfft..still have 530 to cash in.
---
But what's the reward?  Monsters aren't really very fun to fight, they just stand there and shoot, or rush at you, and non legendary loot is essentially just scrap for bullets and repairs at very best.  XP?  Outside of score challenges and possible legendary perks (though that system still seems DOA to me)?  Why?  My character is finished.        
---
I have a feeling monsters will still be no actual threat, they will just be more of an annoyance to kill.    
---
This just seems like a poor bandaid for the problem that a) all gear and combat perks need a full overhaul, and b) loot really sucks.
---
Whats that?
---
Lol like the guy today (the only one using mic) yelling at all the other players telling them what to do, YELLING. And when it ended was acting around like we succeeded because of him 🙄 the event is every hour, chill out
---
This would be what Mike Wazowski would sing If he played 76.
---
Absolutely. Except it’s been bugged to hell since patch 21. 
---
Those sceeenshots with dozens of “chain” on them? Tesla rifle. LITS and RR running at 1FPS? Tesla rifle. And now Primal Cuts at 1FPS too.
---
Fortunately I’ve seen considerably fewer Tesla’s in the last couple of days and all those events run great. Well ... as great as they can, considering this is FO76 after all.
---
Welcome to the Graveyard Shift life, in my case it's quiet about 90% of the time. I play Switch and be on my Chromebook almost all night.
---
Agreed. The scrap perk does wonders on them.
---
Something weird up with weight. I completely emptied my stash and put everything back and lost close to 300 weight, 200 in stash and 100 on me.
---
hit 92 last night. looking foward to next weekly's to jump again. should be done in a week.
---
I finished about an hour ago. I thought it would be a bit more of an event, sadly mistaken. Does anyone know if there is an alternate reward for completing dailies? Well done to all who accomplished the task.
---
I sleep these hours normally anyways. I specifically asked for the graveyard shift because I can't really function at anywhere near full capacity. Like 40%, maybe.
---
grahm has them. i am looking right at them right meow. 1150 each
---
I now know how to get into those locked camps....
---
I think I saw Gram selling heavy combat armor check him next time the cook out starts  Edit: I just checked and he sells the full heavy set
---
15 times and not a single 3\*?
---
Oh boy, wait till you've done it hundreds and hundreds of times and you're still lacking the fucking plans for Ultracite Calibrating Shocks. Level 552, killed the queen way more often than I can be arsed to recall and 99% of those fights ended with "oh cool, 1\* Rolling Pin/Pitchfork/&lt;whatever other insulting shit you can imagine&gt;, on the ground you go."
---
The RNG in this game actively hates the players.
---
But yes, I agree. The Queen, Sheepy and Earle need to drop a guaranteed 3\*. No need to make 3\*s out in the wild rare, just give bosses a reward pool that's actually rewarding. Stopped bothering with Earle because the new weapons are shit. Stopped with Encryptid because I can only tolerate so much White Fedoras before I get angry. Queen it is.
---
I'll do it in the morning I'm going to bed.
---
Any idea when the next sale is?
---
A mod for backpacks, I think plan can be bought in Foundation with gold bullions.
---
Basically gives you Thru Hiker rank 3.
---
Rewards have been atrocious for me. Constant meat cleaver plans and bloody chef hat's. I just want the tato salad recipe!
---
But yea I like it. I prefer fasnacht but I like this event as there is no combat. It's different. Plus all the treasury notes. Ah makes it so easier, not having to worry about doing dross like guided meditation and the terrible settler dailies.
---
Yeah me neither, I don't like in person interactions, hence why I always work graveyard shifts. I usually get like 5 hours a sleep, which is enough to function for the rest of the day.
---
After the event begins, go to where the Yao Guai is being roasted in the center, those grills are where you put the prime meat - like *you're* 'putting it on the grill'. 
---
You have to have 5pcs at a time when you turn them in.
---
Yeah 4.5hrs is average for me
---
On the PTS, furious and anti armor are right behind junkies, and instigating is great for clearing mobs as a sniper.
---
I have the damage backpack on, not sure if giving up the 90 damage resist is worth what I’d get back from thu hiker. But maybe?
---
we have had this suggestion and discussion many times before.
---
It's a great idea to be expanded on. eg.
---
Like spawning minion deathclaws, with chameleons in the mix roaming the wasteland. an idea would be to hunt and kill those, get some kind of pheromone or whatever from them, then you can find craft a 'disguise' of sorts to be able to find and enter lair etc
---
Don't forget half off Fridays.
---
"It jus...."
---
Ill be working at a Casino so I think it will be pretty much the same night or day, maybe a bit less people as the witching hour approaches.
---
Charleston
---
Peace out frame rates
---
Yet I'm toting 4,000 ammo of three different types somehow.
---
100% agree. Easily the best thing about the event.
---
I got a two-shot and a quad explosive, both of them break after fired less than 300 ammo.
---
There is a locked door in Balton greens. Go to the kitchen and you will see it.
---
Less atoms to earn, more atoms to buy. It's not silly, it's just good business.
---
So all the grinding, all the trades, all the hours, all the levels, all the levels switching SPECIAL cards back and forth to optimize build to what Bethesda gave us... all that down the drain cause its too op and kills pve too fast... wow
---
So the few hundred hours we grinded to get an explosive shotgun, a tse gun or a hook... then people complained cause they were op compared to their build, so those got nerfed... ok so no shotgunner or tse build.
---
Now a thousand hours after previous nerf you have redone your build, traded god knows how many times and grinded legendary scrip to go get hundreds of shits from purveyor to optimize once again your bloodied build and you kill things too fast so people complain and you get nerfed again.
---
I’m not saying the damage math should not be reworked, but for everything.
---
How about you start by buffing enemies?
---
Rework their HP and armor.
---
How about adding harder enemies?
---
Hulking MegaDeathclaw, Hulking MegaYao Guai, Hulking MegaGulper, create new bigger and badder enemies.
---
How about buffing the other builds?
---
Mutant should be +10% for each mutation, +5% each if you run class freak. Up to 10 mutations.
---
Let Junkie go up to 10 addictions.
---
Nocturnal gets a stackable +5% dmg the later at night it gets from 8pm to 6am total 50%, add 10% more dmg per each piece of Nocturnal armor during those hours as well.
---
Hunter/Troubleshooter/Mutant Slayer/Ghoul Slayer weapons give them a stackable damage effect, each animal/robot/mutant/ghoul you kill every 24hr gives you 1%-2%-3%... up to 100% bonus for the remainder of the 24hr, resets with each login.
---
Zealots +10% dmg bonus per each SBQ killed for 24hrs. Resets at login.
---
Stalker +10% dmg per each Sneak armor piece you wear. Stackable+5% on top if its Regenerating Sneak armor pieces.
---
Suppressor each kill grants a stackable -1% dmg dealt to you by any enemy ever after up to 50% less dmg taken for every 24hr with reset at login.
---
Basically give the other builds a good purpose instead of killing the current op builds. People would start cherishing all those weapons/armors that get scripped 99.9% of the time
---
People would walk around with all kinds of weird miss matched armor sets and different weapons. I can see my bloodied build carrying nocturnal, hunters etc and not just bloodied weapons.
---
But no, its easier to nerf whatever current op build might be.
---
De-purposing instead of Repurposing.
---
People have fun killing things and seeing their numbers go up, not down.
---
Double or Triple HP on the endgame enemies, on all enemies !!
---
I hardly ever fight the SBQ, and my build is pretty meh, but I'm going to take a big hit in effectiveness for no benefit that I can see, and I'm already using one of the less effective weapon affixes for my main gun (instigating).      
---
I 100% agree bloodied needed to be nerfed... but they nerfed everything instead and left bloodied still the best.  Why?      
---
All gear and combat perks need a total overhaul, and have needed for a long time, this is just a bizarre bandaid.    
---
The notion that this is what was needed to add in meaningful end game content, or that any further rebalances are coming just seems like baseless conjecture to me.  There's nothing like that in the road map, and there's really nothing we have seen from the dev process that would lead me to believe anything like that is coming any time soon.  I mean it's been two years and they haven't given us anything for end game content outside of repeated quest/currency grinds, and I don't think it was because people do too much damage.
---
Absolute mad lad
---
Plan is just 350 bullions, it might be worth a try. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Is it still the same leg perks?
---
How do you get 150 scrip a day?
---
I loved Oblivion, Fallout 3, 4, Skyrim. The best games with the most bugs. I'm also a masochist so I come back for more.
---
Oh no! I hope this year is better!
---
Its one of my favorite events!
---
I eventually chose to settle at WS because it's a good area, near a station and vendors, has a water stream that I build by camp over and have water purifiers indoors, nice plat land, xp farming spots, etc.
---
Before that I used to have a small 4x4 when I started and struggled to move it around and rebuild it every time so I went for a design that had 1 foundation and stairs leading up to a larger floor so as ling as I could fit 1 foundation my whole camp would fit even on hills and other places so I could place it when I needed it.
---
I think you can make blueprints that snap together.
---
Make a blurprint of each floor or every half/quarter of the floors then when you move it maybe you can snap those pieces together so you only have to place like 5 or 10 camp sections rather than rebuild the whole thing. 
---
That's something I did when I was first settling mine where I wanted, I used to be at the top of the mire and had a 4x4 with a 2x2 hole in the middle for an indoor garden and water purifiers early on and made a blueprint of the foundation layout and everything on it then the walls and ceiling as a second piece to snap on. It was a bit difficult to snap because it's one giant piece and trying to snap many points together so maybe smaller pieces would work easier. It's not hard to place walls and ceilings where you know they should be so if those blueprints don't work out it's not too hard to place. The floors were more important because you can add everything on the floor to the blueprints so they'll be in the same place
---
Soooo much fun!
---
What can be exploited will be exploited.... unfortunately.
---
Yeah, I’ll try it out for sure.
---
You can't learn mods for every item in game by scrapping. Tenderizer being one of them (and bear arm, sheepsquatch staff/club, and bullion items you mentioned, there are many items..). You need to have the plans drop for you from certain places or for some items/mods buy from vendors. Like tenderizer plans drop from the meat week event. You can learn about them / find the drop locations from here  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR\_El8/edit#gid=2043760311](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=2043760311)

---
Considering there are only a few people, when a lot of people join she gets a huge boost to health
---
Yeah the first star is the most important I never said it wasnt but in order for them to shine (IN MY OPINION) youd need something like explosive or ap cost. To say explosive doesnt matter when it adds a huge chunk of damage is weird. I have a 1* bloodied handmade and a tse one and my tse one does I believe over 60-80 more damage.  I feel especially with this upcoming update just having a bloodied 1* isn’t gonna cut it anymore but hey I could be wrong im not sure as I haven’t got to test it myself on pts.
---
I think it would be funny to equip the alley with a fatman (even if equiping weapons does not increase the damage at all). Just to see those nukes go flying any time there is a minor attack on the CAMP like some molerats...
---
Get someone to make a baseball bat with heated coils for you.  You can get a better one every five or so levels.   Ammo is a constant hassle at first.  
---
Don't feel like you \*have\* to pick a perk if nothing seems worthwhile.   You can save up those points.   Once you hit level 30, keep your eyes peeled for Starched Genes, so that you can get (and keep) mutations.
---
Lol i know the feeling
---
How do you even trigger dialog? The raider has always been aggressive from the get go for me.
---
some people do it for fun
---
The purveyor, Who is that? Do you mean the EA/Activision store? XD
---
We are a simple species, only just out of the trees. For most of our evolutionary struggle we have had a paucity of resources. We cannot help but want more including what we will never use. We haven't had time as a species to outgrow that. Our primal instincts allow us to both manipulate and be manipulated.
---
you don't have to understand.   
---
you don't like that specific gameplay, it's ok.
---
Nice I work at a Hotel as the Night Clerk. Casino sounds busier
---
Yeah, I couldn't handle that same riff over and over again either.   I didn't keep Forager because he didn't have quests that gave me legendaries.  :)
---
Probably just rare for that to happen since it doesn't happen everywhere it once ti technically there's a possibility it won't be in one of the locations all day
---
I just lack the incentive now. If they do it for fun, that's fine. But for an event this hyped, to have most of the rewards in less than a week is just... Depressing.
---
I felt the same, until I did the Colossus. 8 Notes and there is usually someone who melts him after enough screws have been farmed; wheras I've had so many Primal Cuts fail at this point that the 2 notes feels barely worth the load screen.
---
Just adding to what Jebu said already... You need to install a seperate copy of PTS from the launcher game menu. Your normal game installation won't allow PTS connection.
---
I use this soooo much while trying to gather myself and plan out my next steps. Thanks for sharing with the community because when I first started I had no idea about this
---
your character will not be finished after all.  
---
The reward will be to get your character on track again :)
---
\^This.
---
I don't even understand how people can be that stupid. If you place the blast radius carefully you can leave out also the scenic overlook which, once fast travelling to it, it's literally a few meters from the mine.
---
If you run dailyOps, you wont be able to sneak, I strongly suggest you to get  a side build for this kind of stuff.
---
Maybe anti armour
---
Nothing for me to buy but ammo, and people never sell 45.  If they do I but 1 twice, then the rest of it with the 3rd hah.
---
I think that the guaranteed 3\* is worth it
---
Maybe for some people. Not for me.
---
Lol just found out i was carrying 40k 556. I use a fixer lol
---
Is this live on xbox yet ?
---
I think its funny af that he’s the only super mutant so far in 76 that somewhat kept his sanity from the experiments that west tek did
---
I would have to look on the Bethesda site but we got it as a reward for donating supplies to atlas last week, it should be pretty soon
---
Edit: just looked and it’s actually a reward for project bravo which is the next time we donate supplies for the BOS. The purveyor sale is September 10-14
---
Its not vegas so idk tbh. During the day it's mostly old people so Idk how many people will be there at night since it's definitely a different crowd lol
---
Yes! A destiny and fallout fan. Absolute legend
---
Really whens the sale?
---
Thank you very much for the extra info. Yor numbers change is quite a lot!
---
Why won't my character be finished?    I have no plans to change my build, it will just be worse, its not like this change gives me something better to change it to, it's the exact same except everything does less damage.  Even if I did, I already have 100+ unpicked perk cards, and most of the relevant combat cards.
---
I'm level 98 now and there is more and more relief riding through. I can actually start picking and choosing which ones I go for.
---
Like if find a bobblehead came up. I'll pass.
---
Same as the bubblegum. I was on a private server the other day and went to 5 locations where bubblegum spawns. Not a single one. In a private server. Wtf?
---
https://youtu.be/z286f9gAGvE
---
This!
---
I can see that. You probably have all of your gear maxed, right?
---
Does it have a door or gate of some kind?  I can't find one
---
Lol makes sence, that's pretty cool either way. Hope everything goes well.
---
Thanks man
---
I'm level 310 and managed to level up everyday fine. Only a couple of ocassions did it start to agitate me.
---
If you’re playing a video game but don’t know that a gift/present picture means “gift or present”, I don’t know how much more hand-holding you can do. 
---
It’s more likely that they’re scared of a trap, or a high-level using an alt character and don’t want you to waste your presents. I got so sidetracked when trying to level my second character because people kept interfering and trying to help me to do quests and killing enemies so I wasn’t getting any XP.
---
Not yet. I’ve got my weapons, I’m working toward my last two pieces of secret service in preparation for BoS arrival. But I decided not to rush it.
---
Especially now that I have no plastic.
---
Didn't realize it was so difficult to find a massive camp with a supermutant walking around it filled with fires and drums that you've been to 30 times already and is literally 5 seconds walk from vault 76, you can put down a custom marker if you really find it that difficult.
---
Gram and the entire camp is still there if the event isn't.
---
September 10-14
---
Fair point. Hadn't considered that.
---
Tbh they should make it so u can level up past 100 for the hardcore players, maybe make it so u earn more lunchboxes, gold, script and perk packs and caps
---
No offense intended, but is it so hard to remember where you left your camp, or you change it every few sessions?
---
I don't see the problem with camps being the same color for the team, you easily see the owner just by having your mouse cursor on top of the marker nothing complicated. This, in no way means I like the map, it's just your complaint is focusing on the least relevant thing. In my opinion the map and interface needs a huge rework because it's bulky and at times not practical. Some kind of  inventory sorting would be great(all quest items in one tab, food/water/chems sub-tabs) or something like this, bring back pip-boy color change, let us move the interface elements, etc. ,hell even the simple ability to chose the desired amount of items you want to craft would be a huge improvement(was implemented through mods in both skyrim and fallout 4,so I don't see how it will be complicated here), well anyway, i hope that the rumors about official mod support are true because this will solve a hella lot of problems.
---
There's a short story mod that alters the Starlight Drive-In in Fallout 4 into a Chinese-American internment camp (and also Dunwich stuff for some reason), and it was so well made that I really like to consider that Canon (it's already borderline canon if not fully so that Chinese Americans got the same treatment as the Japanese Americans in WWII, so it's not too farfetched imo).
---
With this in mind, I'd say definitely to keep them in.
---
People just love getting a chance for rare plans to trade. Even though these have a ~10% drop rate some dude wanted 15k ultracite 5.56 for a flag plan.
---
I bought it from a vendor for 50 caps in the end. People are seriously overestimating the value of these things
---
No. You need the game on the Bethesda.net launcher.
---
My thoughts too.  I can't see me walking away from genuinely new content, but I think my 8 hrs/day are done.   Not sure if I'll even like the game after the new damage model changes.   Who knows--I might like it more--we'll see.
---
Thank you for a great post.
---
Just last nite i looked at my vending machines and thought this is actually some great stuff, dirt cheap but no one is interested. eg. EXECUTIONERS weapons.
---
I am looking forward to the change and subsequent balancing. And of course the OPS addition has me excited.
---
I am committed to spend some money on atoms when it launches. The game has given me so much value over the past year. Bethesda has my support
---
ammo is not a thing that rifleman has to care about, but in any case i have friends that I play this game with. if i need to run that specific toon thru a daily op it will be trivially easy.
---
Yes.   It's worse than it's ever been.
---
it's not about ammo
---
Stop spreading FUD. The [Bethesda TOS](https://bethesda.net/en/document/terms-of-service) has a whole effing section 2.D Game Mods that is all about "we're fine with it but you're on your own when things go wrong".
---
6 weeks late, level 60. Got the things I really want, do want the blood Eagle handmade paint but not sure I'll get it but all in all I'm happy with my progress double xp has helped speed things up. I was level 47 when it started.
---
Please screw off. I'm not on an event site but I have spent a considerable amount of time building up my CAMP. I sure as hell wouldn't move it unless the game forced me to, and if the game encourages putting a camp in a certain place, who are you to tell people not to build there?
---
Selfish? Perhaps. They still made the promise.
---
They've had quite a while to redeem themselves. I'm hoping for the best, but not holding my breath. 
---
Majority of things in the atom shop are literally cosmetic, so they can implement a discount. Permanent workshops are whatever, dont see why not.
---
I dont just have one complaint with the game. Thats been made pretty obvious. Again, I enjoyed it. But at a certain point logging in just to sell some stuff and wait till the next day gets really old and kills any fun in the game.
---
Will say, I appreciate you dropped the name calling. Id recommend avoiding doing so just because you don't agree.
---
Yeah it would be nice to be able to toggle them off.
---
Yw mate!
---
I'm disappointed with deathclaw island. One and you're done. Now new vegas had the right idea, a whole section just for deathclaws. And I believe one was a queen. Mean and ugly and her spawn was just as bad. Took a crap ton of mines and ammo and hiding to kill it. I want all them back. Maybe in the ash or the mountains next to foundation.
---
Oh, you do what you want.Personally I aim for fun, and right now, my bloodied build is not as fun as before, so I test new things I start to enjoy more.
---
I take this as a soft reset, like in many mmo out there when an overhaul is released, you constantly need to update your character. It's fine for me, I don't mind.
---
Ok thanks
---
But the fast travel system is still flawed and not functioning appropriately.
---
Work-arounds are great but do you not want things to work as intended?
---
You could always play the game while you're there and turn it off when your not :-)
---
I use instigating, not bloodied, so...  I wasn't even part of the problem, and I get nerfed anyway.
---
I’m probably gonna take a break and play the new PoE season. Then come back to new content (hopefully).
---
Yeah.....I would have been leaving.   I don't need anything badly enough from any event to enable someone like that.   He can do his own work.
---
Start farming wood, glass, cloth and leather. They're in the ATLAS loot pool.
---
If it take my perk cards off, I sit at about 800 weight so I’m with you on that. Bandolier, thru hiker and batteries included.
---
Mask is cool
---
I played it when you could receive all of those Christmas/Halloween/survivors items. Now they're gone I'm just not going to bother at all.
---
Forgot about that... *Buuut* I got it too.
---
Having more than one console on the drums 2x or even 3x or more loot
---
Yeah I always found it strange when all of the sudden my base starts self destructing whenever Emerson's around, in game I chalked it up to Sophia being cheeky with my missile turrets but I 100% bet that Todd was in fact the cheeky one.
---
I was having a blast last year. Equip the cannibal card and eat people that get downed by exploding cars for even more fun factor. 😈
---
The bullets are already hard to obtain, only spawn in one location. Not counting fusion mag receiver, because it cuts the damage.
---
I'm pretty sure he's talking about the custom navigation map marker, not his camp marker.
---
Same here. Event never ends, just disapears. Creatures spawning underground. And, Ash Heap is NOT easy if you are alone. Those who tried knows why
---
You seriously think it could compete with Apex, fortnite and Warzone? You're kidding right?
---
The easy one will either appear in the forest or in the toxic wastes. The medium one will appear in either the savage divide or the ash heap. The hard one will spawn in either the mire or the cranberry bog. If you are not seeing the event in the forest it's because it's at the other location in the toxic wastes. With a 50/50 chance for it to be in either one, it's likely that it will appear in the toxic wastes a few times in a row which would make it seem like the forest spawn has stopped working.
---
How about, and stay with me in this bonkers crazy idea, you actually play the game?
---
Play instrument and rubber band while your map is up
---
Do someones camp lol, it's what I did. I'm not the only one, saw numerous bounties yesterday at ppl camps lol. Cheeky dwellers.
---
This is simply amazing, good job Bethesda(feels weird saying that)
---
It's not the color of the camp they were talking about but the marker you can put on the map where you want to go to. So when you use the compass , you sometime ,if your friend's have also a marker on the map, you walk in the wrong direction because the marker's on the compass have the same color.
---
Just read the TOS and you'll see that you are wrong.
---
Stop spreading this rumor.
---
No, actually all of us haven't.  Some of us carry at least two weapons that use different ammo and carry an adequate amount of ammofor each precisely in case a weapon breaks (two is one and one is none) or we burn through ammo faster than we anticipated.  It's more than okay to "hide" on the pole--heck, it's just good tactics--but it's another to watch someone else do all your lifting.
---
This. Neither camps nor tents have anything to do with lagging or failing prime meat events. The spawnpoints are fucked up which makes it fail at times. And the lag mostly comes from unlooted meat piles that bug out and leave any content of said piles as a lootable item on the ground.
---
If there are no boss enemies what is the point?  Hit that legendary for loot and daily SCORE.
---
Hell yeah. Get yo blood suck on.
---
You can glitch it, but then your camp is fucked and you get disconnected if you change anything else in your camp.
---
It doesn't help that the wording on a lot of things is really ambiguous.
---
It took me a while to realize that gauntlets counted as unarmed and not one handed
---
And that the empath mutation doesn't exclude you from the - 25% team damage. If you are usually on a public team, you should be using empath. If you have strange in numbers /class freak you receive 25% less damage and your team gets 33% less damage. That's insane. If you don't have those perks you recive 0% more damage and your team takes 25% less damage. 
---
But the wording makes it sound horrible so nobody runs it, but it should be the first mutation everyone gets after speed demon and marsupial.
---
You gave me idea - Chally Mask + Manta Man Costume = Super Cow!
---
This update is awful, heres why:
---
No real thought put into this at all, its just a flat nerf to everything. There are alot of builds on this game that are already useless and their gonna be even worse.
---
Bethesda have ignored all the main problems of the game in favour of this.
---
What about all the useless weapons in the game? Why cant they be buffed?
---
This just isnt a "rebalance" its just a kick in the balls at this point.
---
I used to have that problem, then I realised how valuable plastic for bulking your scrap is and now I easily farm, bulk and sell 1400 caps of scrap a day, which also helps with the stash limit.  
---
You can also farm water and sell that, a great way to earn caps is with the Pharma Farmer perk, getting extra drugs from most containers is a win win for caps.
---
Hard to play while your asleep
---
Id rather farm
---
Jetpack says hi.
---
Then maybe, just maybe, you shouldn't be leeching off an event while you're asleep anyway? Shocker, I know.
---
How am I leeching when im helping the event?
---
No one will watch that. Links in titles are not clickable and w/o any sort of description there's no chance in hell.
---
If you want help here, make a proper post and ask.
---
Sophia, I just don't care anymore. I just don't fucking care. Should have left your ass in the bunker.
---
Yeah that one Im not really much worry about, I rarely see people with Jetpacks, but everyone is always jumping around.
---
Has this worked for you for long periods of time?
---
Are digital rewards really this important to you?
---
So does Beckett although they're mixed with rescue and assassination missions.
---
I have her wearing a prisoner collar at all times. I keep hoping one day she'll run away and I'll find her head blown off like thirty feet from my camp.
---
While they have buffed unarmed a tiny bit, at max bloodied (5% health) with all the right perks and mutations, damage has gone from 1400 on live to 350 and now up to 400. It's still pretty low for the risk of being one shot by literally everything.
---
Nah that's to much money for Bethesda's deep pockets
---
It’s a fun event to do, remember, you’re the exception to the rule. Most people aren’t going to grind it hard the second they get ahold of it and they’re likely more interested in things like Treasury Notes and guaranteed legendary items. 
---
For you, remember that the loot pool isn’t complete. There’s going to be new Gold Bullion items released with Patch 22 and of course more in the future, so having another high level event to do to get TN’s might just come in handy.
---
While true still would be funny
---
Cut off a cockroach's head and it will starve to death in a week or two... Really. A buddy (in Texas) used a pair of scissors and cut one in half straight down the middle and each half tried running off in a different direction. He also blow gun darted one to a wall and it tore itself free... These are huge "Waterbugs" which is what they call roaches in Texas, apparently. One was crawling on my shirt once and I noticed because I felt the shirt being tugged as it climbed... Ya... Icky f#ckers!
---
Woooo! Thanks for reaching out and keeping us updated. This has been a big problem for a lot of us.
---
How about, and stay with me here, you just completely ignored my question and now have a different argument than before because you arent able to answer the question
---
Yeaaa give this guy some credit he's banging those bongos all night long .. we couldn't have done it without you..
---
*Structure on perfectly flat ground, is green*
---
THIS ITEM NEEDS SUPPORT.
---
THEN WHY THE FUCK IS IT GREEN, BETHESDA?
---
Good to know. I am grinding the event for exactly that plan. I have just about everything ELSE drop from it...
---
Also I could ask you the exact same question for just playing the game
---
Not funny I'd much rather receive a shirt that 20 USELESS atoms
---
How?
---
Hahaha thanks for the humor bro
---
I'm just sick of seeing afkers at an event, because for some reason the bar still drops even while they're supposedly "helping."
---
Dear Bethesda please ignore this suggestion. I love sharing the cannibal perk and hearing my friends angrily sigh every time they accidentally eat a corpse while trying to jump. 
---
Ty
---
Aye. It's not so much that people are doing too much damage, it's that all the multiplication made attempting to create anything balanced just.. oof.  If you're currently struggling in the wastes.. this is why. If you're one shotting everything, and can't find a challenge, this is why.   Changing to additive bonus's gives us a much more predictable damage progression that is going to help them make content that is a reasonable challenge rather then oppressively hard or stupidly easy.  They'll probably need to adjust numbers, but now they'll be able to without wild exponential results.
---
I'm not the one leaving their machine running while they sleep because they're so desperate to get rewards they never earned.
---
The fence goes right through another fence piece and won't recognize it as solid object.
---
You might want to look for a workaround for this.
---
Um you get 760 now
---
It'll work until the server shuts down providing you have your controller set to not switch off. You should also switch off your vendors and stay out of public teams unless your camp is in a nuke free zone.
---
Your saying the bar wouldnt drop without us there? Because if we werent there the bar would be dropping much faster.
---
Calibrated shocks and set bonus.
---
Sure the damage has been nerfed but with our actual damage we just overkill everything... we needed one 2000 damages bullet to kill a 500 hp mob, now we need 2 * 400 damage bullets to kill the same mob. 
---
But the low health builds are becoming an issue with daily ops, unless you only play with a really organized team (with friends for example) the incoming damage can be hard to sustain, and if you die all the time you can't beat the best timer.
---
Im still going with one or two spaces ahead of Zorbo. I haven't spent any atoms which I'm pumped about. I want to use this board in my CAMP as I had my son irl and want to use small letters to put his DOB on it as a reminder of him arriving mid season.
---
Even a week in hospital I'll still finish easily. It shows it wasn't too time demanding in reality as I was very casual doing it.
---
Wow .1 atom per hour played huge payoff
---
Hope you're a high level or set to pacifist because I've been killing those people.
---
You can just zoom in and wiggle your curser around a little and it's fine. We're not talking about the fast travel glitch here, that's a separate problem. We're talking about going to an event that has 'too many' players. 
---
I get it, the game is fucked in many many ways, but this just isn't something worth moaning about imo. I just don't see the value of negatively posting about such a tiny inconvenience that you can easily solve yourself without having to moan about it. Do you not get tired of complaining all the time and looking for things to complain about?
---
Don't get me wrong, feedback is vital to the development of this game, but there's plenty enough of it and stuff like this just isn't even a problem.
---
Well damn. 
---
So much for that plan.
---
As a heavy can confirm 10k rounds for each of my mains. .50 .308 and 5mm usually more for the .50 as it’s my go to.
---
This is all on the Public Test Server. If you're not on it, don't worry about it yet. :3  Or do, cause you wanna give feedback.
---
How did we not earn them
---
The Captain Cosmos and Dark Matter power armor sort of already does this, i know it plays a little tune when being attacked or getting a kill, think it also plays a tune when you level up so its completely doable.
---
I have zero issues completing the event with one or two people and nobody afking on the drums and spits.
---
You're literally leaving a machine running all night to let others do it for you lol.
---
Do you have weight reduction armor or backpack? I have the chemist backpack because I carry around a ton of aid for my bloodied build and I also have weapon weight and ammo weight reduction armor so my weight goes up immensely when I get into power armor. I usually have to put traveling pharmacy and batteries included on when I where my PA
---
The reason the drums and spits are there is for people to use them believe it or not
---
Also a list of event etiquette
---
The last few times I’ve logged on I just spent the whole time fucking with my inventory and trying to find screws. Eventually just said fuck it and logged off
---
I got up to a 1min timer when my friend and I got put in our own instance for a colossal problem. That sucked. 1 min is a loooong time to be out of a fight. Even 20sec sucks if he dies during it and you get respawned outside without looting
---
I'm not on the BGS hate train. I think 76 and BGS has some big problems, but I think they can fix their act. I made this post for fun and to hopefully get some laughs, not to hate on BGS
---
Hit or miss for me, 2 will complete and the rest will fail for the hour even with 7 people. Last enemy either is non existent or somewhere we can't see.
---
I'm sure all of my friends would agree with your suggestion to be fair
---
How do you set your controller to not switch off?
---
I don't care if people show up and use them for the event. Just tired of seeing people sitting there for hours and getting rewarded for it. If nobody showed up to actually do the event you'd get no rewards as it would fail. They're doing the work, you're leeching.
---
A t shirt seems far more fair for playing 316 daysand 16 hours your gunna make me start a petition
---
This is genius.
---
Others do it for me. Others do it *with* me. Saying others do it for me is saying I dont contribute at all. Thats not true. If you replace that for for a with I would agree with that statement
---
We are with many! Operating in the shadows, always on the lookout for fences to fly over and main entrances to ignore.
---
Just a normal backpack.
---
On PS4 go to sound/devices in the quick menu by holding PS button
---
I'm totally surprised nobody has already
---
This exact same thing happened to me today!
---
Yeah I also want it to sound like this
---
https://youtu.be/TeTZ1Nc8Qnk 
---
Around 0:45 you'll hear it
---
I've never done this.  How do you not starve/thirst to death?
---
Energy weapons need some love, they are bad in this game when in fallout reality, they should be some of the best weps in the game. I just cant be bothered to explain weapon diversity on this game anymore as it feels like im talking to a brick wall, Bethesda suck balls.
---
I've noticed  (First time actually participating in meat week) that there r 3 different sites per event, u might just be at the wrong one
---
What does it matter what others do with what they've bought from you?  
---
My prices are 10% of actual value except for bobbleheads and magazines which are 50 caps, and rare clothing/PA skins which are recommended game value, someone can buy all my stuff and i've made the caps I want, if they want to then sell it for more in their vendors good luck to them, I find throughput of low value sales is far more lucrative and consistent than waiting for the occasional big value single sale.  
---
It's in game currency with no real world application, you aren't losing anything even if you sold everything at 1 cap (unless you specifically fast travelled to get it).  It cost you nothing to get it so anything you sell is profit.
---
No problem, was just wondering!
---
Just a regular backpack and I wear the Chinese stealth suit all the time.
---
Dang now I feel stupid(er)
---
This was my exact build until I could carry more without being in PA than I could in it. Honestly I wish PA would give an extra 100lbs to whatever your weight limit is including your backpack.
---
I'll let DIO answer this one: [https://youtu.be/OzOuKYak88c?t=104](https://youtu.be/OzOuKYak88c?t=104)
---
I die from falling rocks almost every single time I run the event so basically I just try to loot Earle as fast as possible and accept that I will die soon. Sometimes I'm lucky and loot him, usually I loot 1-2 items and then bam falling rocks.
---
But you previously said the progress bar has gone down *with* people playing on the drums. You just made  a severe mistake. You contradicted yourself. Not the best thing to do in an argument.
---
it's pretty much useless, with perk card packs you will get duplicates too. Considering Legendary Perks are coming, you can use spare cards and scrap them for perk coins.
---
200 is ... odd. Your carry capacity should go up in excavator, but not by 200 if you're wearing a backpack and CSA.
---
If nobody showed up to the event. First off never happened. Secondly it would fail anyways.
---
Leaching would be getting rewards for doing nothing. Im am imo helping a little bit.
---
Just leaving them to it 😂
---
I didnt know you could lol
---
Was hoping for a bit more, but one upvote coming your way..
---
Or test your game then make adjustments so the tents don't cause an issue. They're a convenience, something to be used in exactly this way, we shouldn't have to work out what issues they cause and self police what we do based on that.
---
They just shouldn't cause issues, it should have been accounted for at implementation.
---
or they could just limit max caps earnt from vendors to 30k daily, that way you cant sell anything for more than 30k
---
Gotta say I love the game, but only currently at about 850 hours. If I get to 7600 hours, I want a statue in the image of my main character, my character to be embedded into the lore of the game to the allegiance of what ever faction I have aligned myself and a shirt in the atom shop with 7600 on the front and the usernames of all who have completed the task on the back that you can see clearly when using a scope. Too much.......?
---
Much appreciated 👍🙌
---
["Yeah I was in the chess club"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xqfC80SRGU)
---
If you fail a mission its "sometimes... it doesnt just work"
---
Problem is that you lose the buff in PA.
---
Thats not very nice
---
Im on xbox but thanks anyways
---
That's actually a pretty great idea, a statue that when you place them in you camp it makes the statue look like you player character.
---
I’ll put my two cents here - most bloodied builds do not waste the scorchbeast queen in two seconds... in my 600+ hours of gameplay I’ve only ever seen 1 scorched earth event where they had killed her faster than I could get there. Only once. I’ve also been a bloodied since level 80 (lvl 260 now) and most of my weapons don’t one shot everything and I’m perfectly content. I use a bloodied Gatling gun, gatling plasma &amp; a plasma caster. I have a full set of SS unyielding that I spent months getting. I can one shot things like radrats but I can’t one shot those level 60 ghouls or super mutants &amp; that’s fine with me. I understand why people want a nerf so that these incredibly OP people stop melting the bosses but IMO most casual players do not play like that. My cousin also said that fallout 76 was boring because all it makes you do is kill things &amp; I think he has a point, actually. To me killing creatures is just a part of the game, but to me it’s just pretty boring &amp; I view most of them as pests. That’s kinda why I like the colossus so much is because he has that special move where he makes you run away, which is different from other enemies. My meaning is that I would like some more variety with enemies, ones that actually provide a challenge instead of just plain bullet sponges and maybe more quests that don’t require having to go out and kill everything. Also I brought this point up before but ammo still weighs a lot. If all enemies are harder to kill for everybody (and I mean everybody) that’s more ammo everybody needs to hold
---
Don't mind afkers at meat week as long as they drum or spin the spit. I afk there all the time when I work. Some people can't spend all day attached to a game so I just leave them be.
---
Neither is taking advantage of other's work for crappy rewards, and don't give me the, " but I'm playing the drum.." because if you have players on all the drums and all the spits the bar still falls it just falls slightly slower.
---
Because it happens 90% of the time people fast travel in at the end and every time I tried to do the same thing and otherwise I've not had an issue
---
Ive already replied to this argument
---
Basically the drums help. If we werent there the progress bar would fall much quicker so we might not be able to carry the event we still help.
---
you only need to play the barrels for the event to start and then you can stop anyway.
---
And every time you load in from fast traveling or what have you it says:
---
#**16X DA DETAIL**
---
I want a Power Armour voiced by Tony Todd.
---
Yea with you there .. I also really don't care how people are playing this game as long as it doesn't ruin it for others.. upvote coming your way..
---
Wastelanders been out for so long already..  on that note, I got my first legendary bow yesterday. 1 * Furious.
---
What system and how’s it going
---
Seriously the conduits plan is so cheep and easy to find, why people don't like using them is be on me. Oh and not to metion how they get mad when there generator gets destroyed even though it's right out in the open. I can't feel sorry for those people
---
Half the time the game doesn’t even load the model for our jetpack, so it’s invisible until we use it and two flames shoot out of nothing above our backs. We are the sky ninjas; you groundlings are never safe.
---
Same here, and I don't want anything so I don't even bother turning them into gold. So they'll just go up and up
---
Not that it would really improve it but he did say he had a lv 20 alien blaster.
---
At L38 you probably don't have enough Agility points to sneak really well. Try for at least 20 or so. It improves without end to at least 54+. You'll probably find that without Sneak perks, once you start firing they'll find you.
---
Nah man hes celebrating to its fullest what is the holiday for but not celebrating chally a beast of burden. Hes just celebrating in his own way
---
yea, you should be able to do it. i love my chinese armor
---
I'm literally sitting with no damage card on and using a magic shotgun at preset just to move lol 😆.
---
I like to claim a few workshops every now and then and in most cases people will drop by and help defend it if required. But every now and then you will get the PVP, personally I don’t even bother firing back because I don’t see the need (and honestly think I would suck at it). But I am a persistent bastard and once returned to the workshop about 20 times, with the the other guy gunning me down every time. After about 15 attempts I would wave at him to speed the process up and just get killed again. I lost some caps and time, but eventually he just moved on.
---
I‘m colorblind 😐
---
Of course you can combine them. Highlight one and you'll see at the bottom of the screen that you can Rank it up. Try it and see.
---
No it doesn't help, if it's not going towards the positive to complete the event then it's accomplishing fuck all, most events get completed in about a minute anyway. The only thing the drums do is let you take a faux moral stand because "I'm helping". But hey, you do you, just don't end up on my server because I'll mow you down and if you have pacifist on I'll just lure a creature to you to do it for me. I'm at 3 so far.
---
OOF
---
The timer is too low, and the enemies spawn too far away. Every single event I join fails.
---
I can’t though.  It’s max level is 1
---
I live it hope it never goes away, there's been so much acid just lying around at primal cuts
---
Yep I did. Sneaked past every single one and even the legendary 65+ scorchbeast at the end and didn't get detected once. And I'm out ✌
---
It ends on the 8th of September, I think.
---
Xbox and I got through :)
---
It’s my first meat week so wasn’t sure on the drop rates and hadn’t seen anything on reddit about it, thanks for the info
---
Unfortunately, no action.
---
Dunno what lvl I was but, yup, that's how I did it.
---
Now thatd be worth the 20 freaking dollars per paint lmao. I'd buy it
---
Have a medkit strapped to the stock or somewhere. I think some real world forces do that one.
---
Give them enough rope and they'll hang themselves is the tactic they employ, best to ignore it I'm afraid.
---
Bethesda's best option is to try to run a script that detects weapons/gear with mods that are not supposed to exist on that weapon, like beam splitter on handmade rifles, and delete them/remove said mods. how long will it take to add something like that? hard to say
---
[](/glassesdash)Hail to the True Raider Queen! Rose is my favorite NPC in the game, bar none. Really sad she didn't get her own little raider group with WL. Ace the raider collectron says he used to murder people for rose, it'd be cool if she got a bunch of raidered out robots. They already have the automatron stuff to make them look the part.
---
I build mind down on the other side of the lake. It's been wonders for Vendor traffic and doesn't seem to do anything to lag the event.. so far at least.  I hope people aren't getting closer then that?
---
TNT 7
---
Before the recent changes I used to throw nuka nades/mine at them.
---
Once an afk'er died and he dropped me 5k wood, that was like many many months ago, but after the scrap box is introduced.
---
I still have 4k wood lmao.
---
I had idea for an eternal stash. Basically we get in game 800 but unlimited external.
---
When you load into main menu your external stash is there. You can swap items in and out of your online one and between characters.
---
To stop hackers your game checks both your stashes when you turn game off and when you log back in. I know it has flaws but I think it could work. We wouldn't have to worry bout carry weight at all this way..
---
Unyielding or bolstering helps alot for bloodied and carry weight. Im by no means a optimized bloodied build but my carry weight is around 411lb and im normally content with it. Im kinda a hybrid build for xp and bloodied. I also don't run any power armor. Hate that clunky ass shit😅
---
Just because im not helping more than you doesnt mean im not helping. If the event wouldve gotten beat anyways you could direct your hate to anyone in the event that didnt do that much and say they might aswell not be there.
---
Maybe they tried to milk him?
---
Are you trying to do it during the event?
---
Congrats.
---
wow,that's sad
---
You can do all the mental gymnastics you'd like but if I polled the entire community and asked them they'd say you weren't which is probably why you deleted it.
---
[](/kderpysilly)Surround them with an army of PA frames.
---
I have no clue what you mean by this
---
Maybe the Xbox Series X can handle it better?
---
In the Fallout world, you should use Chinese to represent communists instead of Russians.
---
Well actually that sbould apply probably in the real world too.
---
They seriously need to make a zombie costume drop for the event and the only way you get a chance for the drop is If you eat a few people during.
---
I was severely dissapointed when i did this mission. As i went in the cave as a fully kitted lvl50+ and all there was were protectrons
---
Are you both on pc
---
Katon Jeto paku no jutsu
---
With hacker there are 3 cards, all adding 1 rank. Starting with Hacker, Expert Hacker and Master Hacker. For level 3 locks you need all 3 equipped, for 2, you need to and level 1... Well you get the idea.
---
Duplicates can be scrapped with the new update soon to releases. Also its the same concept for Lockpick.
---
fuckall
---
Ah yes me too. I always forget as well naively thinking I am about to do some scout armour shopping! Ah god damn it Fasnacht masks!
---
Yeah i remember hearing you can only get 30 a day or something?
---
 Still, i feel like it's just too useless. I was watching a juice head video and it still took him like 6 shots to kill a level 50, that's just stupid to me. I understand a normal pistol or something weaker, but a ALIEN BLASTER?
---
My camp was first. They shouldn't put events right on top of resource pits.
---
The funny thing is so many bloodied builds didn’t care about One wasteland update because they would still be one shotting everything. Now, they care lol
---
no, my point is that ammo is already rare enough, so they can make a more decent buff to it
---
Oh crap - sorry, my bad. Just hold onto it until the Legendary perks comes out soon and you can trade it in.
---
It would also be nice if they fixed it so that armour penetration works with energy damage. Anti-Armour Laser Rifle/gatling? Well, that's useless.
---
Can’t join just says I don’t have permission to join? Even though I’ve been doing it since it began.
---
I’m sure you can buy some in market subreddits
---
I needed to scrap once. Reached the table through the window and popped right in.
---
Do you really need all the stuff in the stash? I haven’t been playing long enough to know really. The player encumbrance has always been an issue in every modern fallout but at least those had companions to treat as pack mules to haul your junk around. Player inventory sucks but being able to break scrap down all over and using grilled radstag and ribeyes to get the extra 20 weight helps a lot. I can kill all the brahmin in Flatwoods to cook enough ribeyes to last a while. I’m kind of a hoarder in survival games bc I have the “you never know when” mentality but I’m sure half the stuff I save is never used. Can you use other storage besides the stash box to hold some less important gear?
---
The bug has been around well over a year and nobody knows why and how it happens. Even bughesda is clueless (no surprices there). There has been lots of speculation on how and why, but the truth is.. It seems to be random, some people get it, some people don't.
---
Both on Xbox.
---
Wow I remember thinking this in Beta! They still haven’t changed it? 😒
---
This is the first time I've heard of the fast travel bug reappearing on Xbox, but I might have missed sub
---
i'm bloodied and i use all of those except pack rat
---
maybe I'm not doing 3k damages but 2400 with max adrenaline, yes
---
Yes, I was thinking the same thing, and let us get loot from our turret kills at our claimed workshops. We can at our camp, but not at our workshops.
---
If this is true then this is incredibly stupid. The event needs speed and efficiency. I really hope this isn't the case!
---
Is the Tesla performance bug fixed in PTS ? Even just running the prime-meat event with someone using a automatic Tesla rifle will drop you down under 30 fps when everythings dead. (this is not a meat-pie issue)
---
That's why you'd cut the low and the high out before you compute the average, if you have enough raw data.
---
Also when Legendary Perks go in the game, the damage nerf will compensate for that probably.
---
Do you have the healing factor mutation.
---
It will disappear when you continue the questline a bit.
---
What i delete lol
---
Also the downvotes on this and the other arguments disagree
---
i have a lot of junkies 1* that i don't want to sell but I'm close to max  the stash lol... junkies minigun, junkies gatling, junkies gat plasma, junkies axe, junkies radium rifle... it's sad
---
The real slogan would be "What do you mean I don't heed five hundred steel and every one star legendary I've ever seen?"
---
Would be really nice if there was a thread that told the prices of legacy weapons since the value estimater tool says trade only
---
I didn't call you names because I don't agree with you about something, I called you names because of your dishonesty.
---
'I want what's best for the game.'
---
'I want them to remove limitations cause it's what I want, not because it's what's best for the game.'
---
Sure, they COULD implement a discount.  I'm simply arguing that FO1st is already worth the value you get for the price you pay.  Anything on top of that should be considered generous on Bethesda's part, not mandatory on the community's behalf because they feel they're entitled to more.  Maybe they could come out and just clarify why they've decided to go a different route, if they have, would be for the best.
---
I'm not sure what permanent workshops would even look like, to be honest.  They run indefinitely while you're on the server or not?  They run indefinitely only while you're on the server but you... don't have to defend them or something?
---
Well, regardless of whatever complaints you have with the game, it can't be fixed overnight.  The sooner you accept that, the sooner you can focus on simply being patient and understanding of the situation we're currently in, not the situation the game started in, or what it might have been had they did something else, etc... 
---
I see good things on the horizon.  Certainly buggy things, but good things nonetheless.  The Wendigo Colossus event is a good start.  It needs some ironing out as I'm sure everything they ever release will need but at least it's something.  All of the BoS content will probably be equally a mess, but this is kinda just the ebb n' flow of Bethesda.  The damage nerf is going to be glorious as well. 
---
The game might actually be challenging to some degree sooner than we think.
---
It took me looking it up to figure out what to do. I arrived as soon as announced and hit the drums almost half completed when it started.
---
The thing I found funny was playing the molerat catcher from Hamel at fasnachts event .. luring a bunch of molerats into Helvetia that munched all the afk'ers up..
---
i thought you could sell them to vendor bot for 1 cap
---
I am on Xbox and have the same issue and have done for the last 2 months. 
---
It's frustrating to have to try to fast travel at least 6 times or so.
---
The same thing has been said about fissure sight prime, level 600 will do it anyway.
---
Sell the shit you’re not gonna use. There is no reason for you to hoard 1 * Level 10 legendaries. You don’t need Scrip that bad to buy a 3 * armor that frankly, you won’t wear anyway because it’s Wood Armor and you’re rocking Marine.
---
one of the things I hate most about this game is the painful inventory management. I could be out in the wasteland having fun, but no! I'm over here in my pipboy trying to figure out why I'm so heavy and making decisions on what to jettison. and it's not like you can just NOT collect all the junk you find, you need it to make a insane amount of bullets it takes to down these enemies! 
---
yet... I keep playing
---
odd, i started getting it when i took a bunch of serums.
---
Caps aren't worth anything to high level players, hence the silly price.They are pretty much trade only as that's what they value, other weapons.
---
Yeah, I imagine, I guess I might be lucky, I'm on PS4 and never had it after that patch
---
Yea, the whole bug is damned odd.
---
You telling me I need to rework my blueprints against flying invisible ninjas
---
Yeah I guess, but still 350k caps worth of flux and other trade items is a lot
---
I can give you some if you are on PC
---
Lmao are you ok?
---
I hope they leave Bessie and Tessie the moo-moo alone.
---
I wish we could just get a mini version of the stash box from fallout 1st. But There would be a limit to the amount of weight. Hell. Even if it was like 300 pounds for junk.
---
I would sell you my Junkie’s Fancy revolver if you were on PS4, dang!
---
Because people value flux at around 250 caps per and that’s like 1400 flux lol 
---
That’s a lot of grinding flux
---
Inconceivable!
---
I've just recently found out about hacked weapons. 
---
I have a explosive plasma Gatlin that appears to shoot normal bullets, and a two shot one that shoots one plasma and one laser round.  Both dropped for me. Always worried people will think they are hacked, since I've learned about the issue.
---
Personally, and this is entirely subjective, I wish Beth hadn't introduced Legendaries in F4. As goofy as Fallout science has always been, there's been at least a sense of verisimilitude about the way the world works (mostly...). Legendary weapons and armor threw all that out the window with the introduction of magic items. 
---
I'd rather they just stuck to unique items or at least put more thought into devising the effects. Anti-armor makes perfect sense, right? Explosive is a stretch but doesn't strain credibility too much. But a weapon that adjusts its damage due to its wielder's state of health? A piece of armor that commandeers it's wearer's will and forces them to use a Stimpack? Pretty goofy. I wouldn't be at all upset if they went away or were majorly redesigned in any F76 part 2 for next-gen machines. 
---
Seems to me that they could do most of the effects, if they want, by adding traits. Take the trait, 'Bloodied' and your character gets their second wind and fights harder when wounded. Or, Junky or Berserker or Assassin.
---
Early morning grouch time over.
---
I'm  not massively high level, I have legacy weapons and rare outfits etc. I have a few toons at max caps and sitting on thousands of flux, steel and adhesive etc. I want something of benefit in my trades, so do they.
---
It’s great for playing Pip-Boy games while sat a comfy armchair, next to a roaring fire, in your camp.
---
You can obtain 350k with 100% certainty. It's just a matter of time. But can you obtain a legacy with 100% certainty?
---
There was probably a radroach stuck on a rock half a mile away.  Happens alot
---
I know that feel all to well haha. 
---
Sucks when you miss out on legendaries too due to that :( 
---
Should be wicked when they patch it so the enemies are scaled to the level of the players a little bit more :D
---
Thing is that most people will never sell good legacies for caps since they are pretty much worthless in the long run. When it comes to 350k, I have never see anything move for higher than 90-100k caps and that is already 3-4 characters whole bank. You may find some rare legacy to caps- deals that are under 30k but I have seen only a few. Best way to figure out value of the weapon is to compare it to other weapons/items. For example one god tier legacy (i.e. BE90 Gatling plasma) is worth about 2-4 high tier 2-3\* weapons (i.e. 2\*BE handmade + 2\*Q25 tesla + 2\*IE lever action). In the end the cap or trade value depends on the individual who you are dealing with. I have also seen Flux and rare junk taking the place of caps in trade market since they are harder to make than caps.
---
Ok.. don't really see what that should do but yeaa why not .. upvote coming your way.
---
Pretty much. Bethesda seem very generous with their nerfs (-80% explosives damage, way back when) but ultra conservative with any buff.
---
Omg lmao! That’s mental haha
---
I appreciate the gesture friend, but I'm more just hoping to make the claim tickets more known. Mathematical odds are it's going to take 86,666 tickets to find a junkies fancy single action, and that's if luck favors me. So it'd be really handy if more people sold or used their tickets in general.
---
Thanks for the information, pretty helpful but I have no idea why some people downvoted my post for asking a question lol
---
Ok ..  not a thing I would recommend but thanks for sharing.. you get a upvote to but only because I'm upvoting every comment in this post..
---
Untrue it has been datamined and proven otherwise.
---
She usaally take less damage from stealth players though. IF she is aggrod against anything, player or other enemy any damage dealt from sneak attacks is not being fully applied if she is aggrod. Only normal non sneak damage is applied. 
---
It is very missleading because anyone with decent stealth can stay in caution,have the sneak damage message appears on screen and the damage numbers reflect sneak damage on screen. 
---
This has been proven to apply to any monster, angry turtle has done videos on it aswell. So always keep that in mind. 
---
The only way to have your sneak damage truly apply is to fight her in private and avoild aggroing her. Thats where those videos of people downing her in less than a minute with bloody commando builds come in.
---
Holy smokes. How long was the event? I’ll have to get on that grind haha
---
Yeah true but with how much duping has been around plus the glitched weapons I thought they would be a little cheaper maybe, I’m not sure
---
1. After 50 you choose between new perk card or you can move special point
---
2. Decent build but you should replace "Strong back" with "Bandolier"
---
3. Not mandatory but if you take a lot damage and it's kinda hard try using PA for more defence.
---
Lone Wanderer is ok but now we all join Public Teams I'd drop that for Inspirational and Strange in Numbers.
---
Radicool = Bloodied so lose Gunsmith for Nerd Rage + anything else you fancy.
---
lol I found the same exact house yesterday. 273 burnt books to be exact.
---
Dang, oh well, gratz on finding one man. :)
---
What do you mean by work light? Those standing lamps like you’d see at a construction site?
---
Heads: Stop crying Maggie, it’s better this way. 
---
Twitch twitch.
---
You’d think they’d learned this by now as this is what most people do for the SBQ nuke.
---
You get a card pack after every 5 levels so 50,55,60 ect...
---
Looks like a good build. I would say if you want an easier time playing the game. Use a bloodied build (YouTube it). If u do choose this avenue. You preferably want a bloodied weapon and unyielding armor (the YouTube videos will explain why)
---
PA isn’t required for silo runs if your a sneak sniper. 
---
Private servers are nice. However I would play in a public server so you can take advantage of players dropping nukes.
---
At your level I would play the game at you’re own pace. Finish the main vanilla storyline along with wastlanders DLC. 
---
As of this week there is an event called “meat week” you can get some cool rewards. Once again YouTube it to find out more. 
---
Best places to level up; West Tek, Whitesprings golf club.
---
Not gonna lie, if god Howard promised me infinite stash space I’d do anything he ever wanted no limits XD
---
Legacy bug from Fallout 4. Doubt we’ll ever see it fixed.
---
No your talking about the prime meat events which are not the same as the main meat week event.
---
Ah, my bad, still learning
---
I’ve been surprised by random dead scorch beasts landing (?) near me. Too bad you can’t tame it. Imagine a scorch beast at your camp.
---
Nope. Bit bloody stingy of them, really.
---
It... worked? I really wasn't expecting that, but it actually worked. Thank you very much.
---
Take Cranberry Relish if herbivore and canned meat stew for carnivore to XP buff.
---
no thanks, maybe join the rest of us in the 21st century and upgrade your toaster. I want all the animals to spawn in one location so I can server hop and do this dumb event that is time locked again before the next hour.
---
Do it in a private world, if you don’t have first you can join a friend’s, I tested it with a buddy of mine that was stuck on the quest and it worked first try
---
Try a private server. That worked for me. Somebody said it has something to do with someone recently having already handed it in. So a private server is your best hope. I am happy to open my private sever if you are on pc and don’t have FO1st
---
that'll be 999 atoms plus tip please
---
From Fallout 4, could explain them. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/These_mannequins!
---
but the members here will tell you to just subscribe for a small fee of 9,99 a month. and they will add the question; what are you? poor????
---
I have two main bloodied characters, the fast travel bug was bad on both, I rebuild mutations on one avoiding healing factor, that character now no longer has fast travel problems the other one still does? Just my anecdotal observation.
---
&gt;friends
---
Must be nice.
---
Innosurvivalist in a video recommends using your camera, it shows in the upper right corner what’s in view.
---
The point is easy treasury notes, and the boss isn't always legendary anyway.
---
Do you really need all the space in the stash box? I haven’t been playing long enough to know. The player encumbrance sucks worse than other Fallouts since you don’t have companions to use as pack mules. I’ve been killing all the Flatwoods Brahmin to make lots of ribeyes for the +20 weight. I know in other survival games I tend to be a hoarder but in reality half of the stuff will never be used. Can you use other storage devices for less important items?
---
Yesterday same thing here...
---
Playing private, getting kicked, cant login on account/server error..
---
Have to quit game, and restart from homescreen...
---
After 10 times of stopped..
---
On ps4
---
?
---
You guys know that now some civic minded toad will tell Beth and this won't work next year. Hush about this stuff, peoples.
---
(It's all good, OP. I'm just kidding around.)
---
A month ago you could literally get b2525 fixers for free. 6 months ago that weapon traded for several legacies.
---
Go to fed76.info, then under more tools there is another marketplace, which usually gives a price where fed76 says trade only
---
Wind whistles....Tumbleweed....distant bells......crows squawking
---
I do, the extra heal is needed if you can afford the slots and if there aren't enough players to protect properly.
---
I like to have a option to let my collectron be quiet...
---
Christmas bot is less annoying to me, but still like to have the option
---
I got the full plan set from completing Roses story. Is this not a thing anymore?
---
Nope. If ur on console quick scoping works for a split second with any weapon. That’s how they’re jumping around and hitting u mid air.
---
Given how long this has been going on I doubt Bethesda have the inclination to do anything about this, they clearly must be pulling in enough revenue regardless so it's not hurting the game. Maybe they know somehow that dupers and hackers actually make them money?
---
It's all about the bottom line as with all businesses. I'd bet if this whole hacking thing was costing $$$ it would be a priority to get it stopped.
---
Thank you, thank you.
---
Had the same thing 3 times but only at that location so I stopped going there.
---
Thanks, mate, it worked.
---
It may have been your first time... but for me, it’s Tuesday!
---
Seriously; I just ran into 2 headless Scorched. Tule of thumb: if they’re headless, don’t waste ammo on them as they’re glitched. Same for enemies that don’t move even after you shoot them. They’ll just auto heal to max and are impossible to kill.
---
Just run *line in the sand* and you will end up with dozens in no time.
---
Fisher Site Prime in the Cranberry bog. Jump in and Grams bro will take any prime meat you have on you.
---
This happens so often it's driving me crazy... I'm currently a bloodied heavy weapons build using vampire weapons so I might do some science and ditch healing factor when I log in.
---
I'll let you know what happens after an hour or so of playing...
---
The worst part about buying legendry weapons is the reasonable desire to stash and scrap them tomorrow, alongside all the other legendary crap I'll aquire today...
---
Lot's of great info guys thank you!
---
Another question I have is what is a good way to make caps?
---
Stop gaslighting, people! This is indeed related go any kind of quickly updating character data like HP on a character with healing factor. You can absolutely reproduce this and it is indeed temporarly fixable by disabling any kind of such quick updates as to verify it being the cause. Anecdotal evidence becomes empirical once everyone can reproduce it.
---
I’m so happy to have a break from taking photos, killing X raiders, and finding equipment for stupid ass Ward!
---
Yes you can, I did, slow and steady wins the race, hug the walls. If you can mod armor with shadowed and muffled. Silencer on your weapon but avoid shooting..
---
Why do you care?
---
Eventually that will fill up though, so doesn't it just delay the time until you hit Cap / Script limits?
---
Step one: Google...
---
It’ll be fixed in a hotfix coming this week hopefully or next week.
---
&gt;Whether you wanted it or not, you've stepped into a war with the MooGang in Appalachia.

Yes! The peeish colour is The one reason i never used PA in FO4. Now we're stuck with it, Would like something a bit more colourful.

Sadly line in the sand has a nasty habit of crashing my game. So I can't really do that. :c  
---
Thank you for the suggestion tho, I do appreciate it. :)
---
8/22/2020 Hotfix Patch Notes: Fixed an exploit that was causing some players to have fun.
---
Pro tip, disable healing factor mutation.
---
and m2 drives spawn in a couple of seconds before even ssd people, it's terrible. nerf m2, hdd are okay, sincerely ssd.
---
Yeah, it was never a thing on T-65
---
I don’t have it 🧐
---
I guess with an iPad or tablet it could be better then with phone. Just try it. I'm going to make some free space on my phone today to test it myself. So I can farm meat week the hole day during work lol
---
Oh gosh you are better off going around and scrapping fans, hot plates, typewriters, etc for screws. 
---
Not sure about gears. I’m always overloaded with them. Maybe wrenches and that sort of thing. I’m too lazy to look up right now. 
---
Just go on a looting spree through any of the bunkers. If you haven’t gotten to that part of the questline, go through Helvetia.
---
Played since the beta....had no idea this was a thing. Thanks!
---
this is my main experience rn and I'm lvl 42
---
I’d love a reason to desire power armor
---
Healing factor mutation?
---
No I don’t just sit at the workshops, I set them up and then go do other things and fast travel to check maybe every hour. I was trying to find a place I can build my camp that has a junk pile I can place an extractor on to passively farm junk. 
---
I’m going to try and find Helvetia next time I get on bc I heard it was a good place for wood anyway.
---
How much would people pay for these?
---
Can you stealth? Yes
---
Do I think you should do that quest at level 38? Not really
---
9 endurance.
---
that's a Vanguard build.
---
There should definitely be more events like fasnacht and this meat thing. I’ve only been here since a little bit before last fasnacht, but I played the living shit out of this game when it was going on. Having a reason for people to stay in the same lobby together for a long period of time is nice. It really highlights how awesome the community is in this game
---
There is a junk pile in the northern part of the forest near one of the farms. (Sorry can’t be more specific). 
---
Also the wayward has a lot of screws. Loot everything.
---
We I've given up on fallout 76 due to the nerf . I think it's another excuse to screw legit  players over.  I'm a bloodied unarmed build and well I'm screwed .
---
I don’t mean glitches or duping (not sure if it’s a thing on this game, probably) I’ve played Ark officials pvp for years so I’m not worried about grinding in 76, just figured the wasteland pros might have some more efficient methods
---
You will scrap it for legendary perks when they come out. 
---
I’m assuming they are both hacker and not master hacker, expert hacker
---
It doesn’t reset your score, so you go from say rank 1 with 200 points to rank 2 with 200 points.
---
The amount of weight you are carrying or your carry capacity?
---
Is any of the power armor broken?
---
How do you even get downvoted for this ?
---
Ur score won't change.  It would still show ur current progress.  Aka  1200/3000 ...even after you use atoms
---
Okay I did the thing and put all of my mutations back except healing factor and have fast traveled 20 times since without any issues...
---
I'll check back in later
---
Cries in power armor
---
Personally I like how you mix two events into one with the frantic prime cuts into a relaxing BBQ
---
With 16 times fusioncore drain
---
You need evidence (video) or they'll do nothing, and even with video sometimes they'll do nothing.
---
Bethesda: 
---
Hotfix - Can no longer use exploit to access pipboy while doing other things
---
Bug - Pipboy now broken and instantly disconnects the player
---
Yea I started taking everything from the Wayward now. At first I was hesitant bc in other Fallouts the merchants aren’t too fond of customers looting their establishments. The lumberyard where the Free Radicals are has been another place I’ve been hitting up as well.
---
Some people literally downvote everything.
---
I found if you just spam the button to fast travel then " it just works".
---
Yea I kind of wish they reacted to you stealing everything. It’s a little weird to go into her bar and take everything but whatever.
---
Is that the one were you unlock the carved pumpkins?
---
That's just how she rolls.
---
Only in PC ? Not this option when I go in map when I play an instrument
---
I've done the event only 3 times and all three times it was a shit show, no mobs......6 peeps at event 5 were afk......alll mobs dead no reward....waste of my time, but glad it's working out for some.
---
Perk coins just have to go completely. The concept is just shit and makes no sense.
---
I have the feeling, that some lead designer had the idea with scrapping perk cards to get coins and now he want to see his idea gets implemented at als costs
---
Remove any source of healt regeneration (mutation/armor/buff/whatever).
---
Rose is best robot girl, following Best Waifu Curie from Fallout 4
---
This, plus there are just too many damn legendaries in the game. It can't be 'legendary' if everyone has one. Then it's just normal.
---
Woah, don't besmirch the good name of guided meditation. It's maybe my favorite event. It's easy to solo and you get tons of experience and usually a few legendaries.
---
Stop hoarding. Scrap any non legendary weapons/armor. Scrap any junk. Get rid of your missiles and mini nukes. If you have power armor that’s not on a chassis, but it on a chassis  
---
800 lb should be more than enough If you spend just a few minutes to clean up. 
---
Also you really don’t need more than 100 of most scrap items.
---
It's always at the top of each hour.
---
I guess bc they were added later into the game it might have been too much trouble to program stealing from NPC shops. That’s the main reason I finally got the game (and 50% off on PS store) I’ve been a fan since FO3 and was really excited for 76 until I saw there was no NPCs and it seemed like a very empty experience until the Wastelanders DLC.
---
Still works just tried, it wont work if someone has recently unlocked it tho
---
In my pipboy, A weapon might say 180 damage, When I click it to equip it, It’ll drop to say 80, I have no mutations etc, I have no idea honestly wth is going on.
---
crops and scare crows are your friend. They distract mobs long enough that /hopefully/ the turrets figure out where they are...
---
Bruuuuuh....If she does it for ya then knock yerself out, I'll leave a sick bucket out for you for when you finish.
---
Travelling pharmacy is about all I use, but as avid melee character i never pickup guns or ammo.
---
Just so when my friends complain i can go "what's the problem just drop your guns"
---
I'm still doing pretty good damage with FE LMG and all heavy gunner perks
---
True.  I accidentally unequipped Thru-Hiker the other day and pulled one of those "looks like we've got a new one!" pre-rant warmups on team chat after only checking for unnoticed missle/mini nuke acquisitions (which had 0 chance to fix the 585/365 i weighed).  
---
I took the moment of self-reflection to drop my 5 pieces of WW-20% armor and Bandolier, Pack Rat, Travelling Pharmacy, Thru- Hiker, Batteries Included, etc.  976/275 (after deducting for the radstag and deathclaw steak fully Carnivore/Class Freak/Stranger in Numbers buffed).  
---
Literally more than the stash.  When properly kitted out (incl. Thru-Hiker active), i still had 45lbs free.
---
(Makes me wonder, does the game have a metric option for the vast majority of the rest of the world?  While i remember having to heat the robobrain replacement to 41C during the next to last Settlers quest, having a 363.64KG stash might be odd.  Nor could Godhoward's minions be trusted not to create gigantic Office Space rounding disasters if given access to fractions.)
---
I've payed between 20-150 caps per ticket in vendors I've found them.
---
The simple solution for them to do is to untie every storage item, that why you storage is only as big as the item you build to hold for it. Then they could bring in a system where you have to put certain item in certain storge, like a gun rack to store guns instead of everything being stored in a 100l box.
---
Or just let us use modules to craft literally any weapon we have the plans for to make legendary versions. It's bad enough there are already select weapons you can just barf out dozens of legendary versions of. And to prevent this crashing the economy you could just flag a player crafted legendary weapon as not trade able or something.
---
Ooh, we could add an NPC that wants gold bullion to give us a legendary plan version of plans we know.
---
That's the Raider skin, it was in the atomic shop a few weeks back. It scavenged chems, weapons, and ammo.
---
Oh I hoped that was just one one of the recent patches when it happened to me twice. Sad to hear it can still happen.
---
Not a bad idea actually. Just make a requirement that they won't sell the Legendary version of a plan unless you know the normal version.
---
That’s been on going for me and friends on PS4 for a good while now.
---
I thought it was patched but maybe it never was
---
Yeah it was happening to me a lot a month ago or more but I thought it was patched after the last update, maybe not though
---
The bug is triggered by **any** source of health renegeration, not only healing factor mutation. That means if you don't have that mutation but you have any other HP regeneration it will trigger the bug (legendary regenerating armor piece, solar armor set, regen buff from guided meditation event, any food that heals over time, etc).
---
Awesome thanks both of you on that!
---
When is that
---
Absolutely I’m just enjoying myself for a change a guy on my team built his camp right by the spawn point so it was great being able to scrap down and craft more ammo in the break and not be overweight. I levelled up twice, got a couple of decent legendarys, quite a lot of treasury notes. Completed all my dailies except NW only managed to use one stimpack and was in there had 10/15 minutes done then it reset to use 3 stimpacks and I didn’t notice 😬
---
I would go to uranium fever any time it pops up and try to tag as many enemies as you can. There's always a few people at the event and you won't be on your own. Afterwards just loot everything and sell all the weapons. The whitespring station is right next to the mine so it won't hurt to be over encumbered. If you have any of the perks to increase selling prices, make sure they're enabled before selling to the bot. One good run will put you a lot of the way towards the daily cap limit.
---
It is just speculation that regeneration is the cause. My newest alt (lv13) does not have a single regeneration effect on him. No mutations, no armor effects you describe (full 1* unyielding wood set), nothing.. And i get the bug even after afking for 10minutes on my camp with him.
---
Rich players problems. I wish I could sell something.
---
How much time do you have to get to monongah after the nuke drops?
---
They could always add that functionality later. 
---
I actually liked the game pre-wastelanders. How are you liking it?
---
could you in theory just stay at grahm's for a few hours banging the drums and get a shit ton of notes once you come back to the game?
---
the event is active for 30 minutes, same as Scorched Earth. enough time to kill the SBQ. when you FT into Monongah you‘ll get the other 4 minutes timer for the rubble to clear.
---
1. Purified water. Build several industrial water purifiers at your camp, collect water and sell it to robors at train stations.
---
2. Marine tactical helmets. Find a plan for it. Make like 50 of them (you need plastic, glass and rubber) and sell to robots. 
---
Watch this video to find out where to get plan for helmet:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMej8PCDKt8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMej8PCDKt8)
---
Get yourself a rank 3 "Hard bargain" perk. Equip it before selling or buying stuff then you can unequip it. You can also use grape mentats to get even better prices.
---
I just find it sooo boring. It lasts too long. Half the time in just standing there waiting for a ghoul to decide to run in every 30 seconds or so.
---
I'm sorry but the reward for 7600 hrs should be like 5,000 atoms MINIMUM (I think it should be more)
---
Not the fucking, what 40 atoms the reward is at now....
---
It happens so regularly and it's been happening for so long that of I had to guess, around launch when the hate train was at an all-time high, someone probably let a few bots loose on the sub downvoting everything for the memes and never bothered to retire them.
---
For gears, I go where the mike miners are. The scrap they drop have heard s in them.
---
Good to know 👍 just gotta wait for the event to come to consoles now
---
The current reward is 760 atoms not 40, and this post was meant to be a joke to hopefully make a few people laugh. I ask that you don't make this a BGS hate train. I agree they have done lots bad. But this isn't the purpose of this post.
---
Everyone wants to rush through this game and get top gear right away
---
Is there any point to saving the packs? Can't you just scrap the cards for perk points anyway?
---
I abandoned having any turrets along time ago. They are completely useless, eat up to much budget and just keep shooting at traders that wander round which is really annoying to listen too.
---
Rather deal with the annoying mutants and scorched that randomly take pot shots at my camp myself.
---
Bethesda: *Ohh woops, more grind. "Darn"...*
---
I think they have changed the way loot is dropped after the dead enemy despawns.
---
No not at all I bought a radaway for 1 cap last night to finish mine 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Just wait until the end. Get more bag for your buck
---
fuck brahmins, all my homies hate brahmins, we only love our great Lord Julie!
---
It has enough of the real Fallout feel for me to really get into it. The pvp could probably be better. Seems since there is no real penalty for dying that most veteran players use these ridiculous bloodied builds to deal massive damage and not worry about having tiny health pools bc it doesn’t seem to matter if you die. I guess that’s going away with the upcoming patches though.
---
Well it was obviously a side account, probably someone duped the shit out of it, no worries.
---
That's understandable. I think I like the monotony of it in a way.
---
Awesome reply thanks a lot! 
---
I got a lot to check out later today. I just recently got my adhesive problem under control and started planting tatos, mutfruits and corn to make starch.
---
Thanks totally calm again..and one more upvote coming your way
---
Mike miners? Idk what that is unless it’s a typo and you mean mole miners. I just ran into them in a big building with the motherlode mission. I didn’t notice what their drops were scrapping into though
---
That's what the game has turned into fallout the overencumbered game.. I spend more time caring about this than I do the actual storyline
---
Fuckin auto correct. Mole miners
---
Yeah I had a few in the pond area near TOTW fail because a CAMP was causing them to spawn *below* the map/ground, where we obviously couldn't kill them. 
---
Naturally, it was right next to the CAMP. I believe totally that it affects spawns.
---
In fairness to the owner he'd probably lived there without issues for months before this event.
---
This has been great. I've gotten so many mats and with all the high level weapons and armor lying around, along with all the meat, I'm able to get max caps from venders in like half an hour.
---
Most of these dropped in the Christmas Present but raider armor sucks generally. Arlny particular reason your after these plans?
---
Did you find that crafting benches placed inside clipped into the floor as well?
---
Enclave
---
Probably because the whole story behind it was too well hidden.
---
That thing is dangerously good... for a minigun that is. If you want to, go for it
---
I agree. I think it’s so much more fun than Fasnacht, which I never got the appeal of.
---
It’s quick and full of action as opposed as slowing walking in a circle with slow ass robots. And it’s easy enough to solo and takes about the same amount of time wether it’s solo or with a team
---
Awesome idea! While we're at it could we get armor and outfits separated as well...
---
The number one weight killer is explosives. Get rid of them all, grenades, 40mm, missiles, all that stuff sucks and weighs a ton.
---
I like Rose, but imo, if any NPC deserves more content it's Weasel.
---
Fo76 really annoys me in this regard. I can appreciate how stacked you can make your inventory  and cut the weight on say armour etc but so I fucking hate the limited stash space (especially when the scrapbox can hold unlimited scrap) and the fact meds and ammo have weight (I finished fnv in hardcore mode but that was a choice not a "feature").
---
I'm a hoarder; I collect food, meds, ammo, novelties etc it was something I enjoyed doing in fo3/NV/4 so it really hurts my play style in 76
---
Ah, misc, I always thought they were under drinks haha
---
You have to get the plans to mod the tenderizer and bear arm. You cannot learn any of the mods from scrapping. This is 100% confirmed from multiple sources.
---
Pretty sure that's why we got packs as rewards on the legendary run. I doubt they'll bother outside of that.
---
Oh shit, I had someone grab over a 100 off me the other day, they were free 😶
---
Yes it’s super annoying to be following a marker and realise it’s not yours 🙄
---
I do not know if this will help however in to failed events I checked the big map and found the targets quite a distance away and moving quickly away from the event. Perhaps this will assist in tracking down what's going on I am on xbox
---
It might be worth it, if you up the fire rate close to 200.
---
But who knows when and if Beth will fix the magic.
---
Well I got armoured and high cap, armoured until I max out then swap. Doesn't help you now, just saying.
---
You can fast travel out of the mine lmao
---
I agree with the rewards, couldn’t care less about any of them. It’s nice though not feeling like I have to participate in every primal cut and cookout event, but have the option if I feel like it.
---
Well, I'm sure you made someone's day at least. :)  
---
Next time you'll be able to make some sweet bank on them tho. :P
---
They duped the plans, so you likely buy one btw.
---
I agree, I wish there was some more penalty for dying but then you have people complaining that dropping junk is too harsh! Cannot please everyone.
---
Besides the Fixer, none of what I listed would really be considered "Top Gear."
---
I did that at roughly the same time as I made this bitch post. Still no response. And I’m willing to bet I’ll get a bot.
---
If it bothers you, move your CAMP. The ammo factory will then occupy 0,6% of your stored budget, but at least you won't worry about being banned. And one day perhaps we'll get a proper solution.
---
I don't think it's down on the map as a location.
---
[](/cc_sad)I second the motion, I've been server hopping looking for camps selling PVCTs all day, and the number of times I hit vendors with hundreds of "misc" items that are actually all serums/bobbles/magazines that are all under the aid tab makes me a sad boi.  
---
Well, that and gunpowder, and bobby pins. Does anyone buy gunpowder or bobby pins?
---
I wasn’t really able to confront him, so I just blew off his head instead. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I have this bug with my combat rifle as well. No idea how to fix it or what causes it, but very weird
---
[](/abhuh)I don't know how you did that, but you can repair it to empty the clip if you want it back to normal right away, otherwise it won't let you reload until you drop under 20 rounds in the clip then it will reload as normal.
---
The mob's pathing suck's,if they get distracted you have to chase them down, i was in the cranberry area and i had to chase one until we almost reached bog town!.
---
hahahah only zoomers need theur hands held for everything. including videogamed
---
&gt;Edit: I tested it myself (you can check my post history). since I removed the mutation and avoided any source of HP regen never had that bug again.
---
It's great that you don't get the bug anymore and doing those things helped. But lots of people still got it without any regeneration effects. This has been discussed numerous times during the time the bug has been around. Which was after they reworked the fast travel to function while in combat early 2019. If it was this simple bethesda would have been able to fix the issue already.
---
&gt; My concern is what happens when the meta switches or entire builds become unworkable due to fuckups. A simple error gutted melee as a build on PTS
---
What happened?
---
What is the actual issue? Your icon is an arrow while theirs are fringed circles ..
---
I use this method for adhesive:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdh\_MP78-YY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kdh_MP78-YY)
---
Use "Green Thumb" perk to maximize the amount of adhesive you will get.
---
Only downside of this method - it's a high level area so you can encounter some tough enemies there.
---
Yes I’m totally over the same old two places
---
Yes
---
I have been for months i have around 70 stored levels and 30 card packs across my main and NW alt.
---
Rose, just Rose. Get that thing out of here
---
Fallout Inventory Management 76
---
It's a start.
---
Most boring for me was probably Sofia's storyline. For much of it I didn't really understand what I was doing or why, it was just go here, collect a thing/shoot a robot, come back. Beckett's story was of course very similar mechanically (just with shooting blood eagles rather than robots) but the dialogue in between missions made everything tie together so I always felt I understood why I was collecting that item/shooting that dude.
---
With an accelerated barrel on it, that thing will cheese through everything as its a bugged weapon. 
---
When they fix the magic bug, it'll just be an OK minigun
---
Ive been..on the fence of getting it vs the bundle, I want the fence but the bunker looks really cool but from what ive seen its riddled with issues (things float when you place them, the door sound isnt right and the turret slots arent useable). So I may just get the fence and not the bundle, thoughts?
---
&gt; I am sorry for slow people who whine 
---
Unnecessary jab at lower level players, elitist garbage.
---
Honestly? The main Wastelanders one. I just don't particularly enjoy heist stories.
---
I loot them almost daily, they still spawn and can be unlocked!
---
Thank you. Guess I'll stick with emergency protocols.
---
If you can just get a legendary handmade simply for buying thenpln (as another commenter states) that is pretty much top tier besides fixer. 
---
Legendary sheepsquatch staffs are actually a top tier melee weapon.
---
Bloodied players are going from unnecessarily powerful to still acceptably powerful, but needing more hits on the tough enemies. It's a good change because it adds difficulty back in where none previously existed.
---
For me as someone who's not Bloodied/Junkie's, and was barely scraping by on damage before, this nerf hurts a lot. I play a sneaky Instigating Rifleman. When I lose my sneak, I struggle in combat *even in the live version of the game*. In PTS I'm a joke as soon as I get seen - my damage becomes so low that common trash mobs can take me two whole mags to kill. Since I'm a Rifleman, my fire rate is low enough that I could easily die from their fire in that time. It's a bad change because my difficulty was in a great spot, and now it's about to be frustratingly difficult all the time. 
---
Realistically I could live with it if Bethesda was willing to let me use stealth, because then I'd have the fun tension of if I break stealth I'm doomed. I could handle that. But in Daily Ops and in Primal Cuts the enemies have perfect vision - it is completely impossible to get the Sneak bonus (even with the 5 pieces of HTD armor I've worked for months to acquire). It feels like a slap in the face to lose 2/3 of my damage at the same time as they introduce new events where I desperately need every shred of damage I have, because I can't buff myself with sneak anymore.
---
PTS damage nerf hurts me bad because in combo with the new "stealth is not allowed" rule, my build has essentially been cut out of the game. I know the response is going to be "online games have changing metas," but I've been playing this type of build in Fallout games since 2015. I don't know any other build, and I don't want to - sneak Rifleman is tons of fun for me, and when I've tried other builds I just haven't liked them. Sneaking creates a unique type of tension that I really enjoy, and Bethesda starting to add rules that tell me "stop that, you're having fun the wrong way" really hurts.
---
Thanks. I'll probably just stick with emergency protocols.
---
Well am at this point now I have a god Roll set of secret service all the guns you have talked about and when I heard about this nerf it made me go back to my weapons collection on my alt and think that all these others types will get more play now as mainly I only keep (BE , BFFR , Quad E, ffr ) on my Main. 
---
But now I have to work out what might work better e.g  TS , executioners, furious but also what might get bugged in the next update as well like the magic guns at the moment because when ever there is an update something goes wrong some way or another am just used to it at this point. But I do feel like Bethesda really need to go back and change a lot more than just reducing weapon perks multiplayers as legendary prefixes need some work like assassin should just be Humans and work on all human npc ,players.. as nobody really uses it at all and same goes for nocturnal should change also to have better buffs as it’s pointless and is never used.
---
&gt;as Bloodied survived the massacre, it's even more than before the one viable build, while all the others have fallen even lower and some have been rendered completely useless
---
 hear! hear!
---
The same thing happened to me but I'm afraid to beat the quest in case it does make those deaths permanent.
---
Might as well, that way the reward would be as old as the game engine - https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/Lousy_T-shirt2_2163.jpg
---
Agreed 100% about Rose
---
Do you like spending 1000s of rounds ? Then step right up your next on 15 str is life.
---
Glad to hear man 💪. My karma is now well balanced for today.
---
All cosmetics are available to all characters from the season. Same with camp items.
---
Same
---
Bethesda site says 10-14 September
---
So much like the person you replied to, Beths insistence on keeping this system really pisses me off.
---
I had a similar thought like you mentioned, except instead of some arbitrary bonus coins they could do somethimg like World of Warcraft does.
---
Reset everyones charachter's build. So if you are level 100, you would login and you would have 0 perk cards but would have 99 level ups, plus 20 perk packs (from every 5th level).
---
However this still sucks because, like everywhere else in this game, the Interface is hot garbage to actually use. Think about all of the clicks to actually interact with these legendary perks. Woof. Ammo converter vibes.
---
Eating perks for points is just dumb and they need to decouple this shit. We are talking 150 delete clicks and 150 confirmation clicks  minimum for one max perk. Gross.
---
Its really just a joke not a BGS hate train. Like I've been saying BGS has problems. But with 76 we gotta go with what we got the ground we've won. I honestly hope for the next games they make that they get or make a new engine, however unlikely.
---
It’s annoying when a Yao guai spawns in my fucking house. But the prime animals don’t seem to attack camp objects.
---
Just use walls, they snap on top of each other. You'll have to surround your base in foundations though, not sure you have the budget for that.
---
Yea who needs the rewards lol
---
I have no clue, I just noticed it at one point. Must have been happened when I was moving to these new mini events. My guess is switching from mini-gun to assault caused it, maybe the event had a say too.  
---
Gonna have to repair it soon anyway, I'll just stick with it for now, it's a nice change after having to reload every 10 shots.  
---
Gonna respond later if a repair fixes it, thanks.
---
Who mentioned anything about a Handmade?
---
I'm only talking about non-base game gear.
---
I disagree. Between her obnoxious attitude and the shitty quests she sends you on for the most petty of shit, there's not enough nukes in Appalachia to drop on that floating trash  can.
---
Piper’s outfit is hardly unique. The combination of the cost and the goggles and the cap may have only been seen in FO4.  But that’s like saying that because you saw an outfit with a red scarf with a blue dress in Fallout 4, that any red scarves or blue dresses in FO76 ‘break lore’. Just because the *assets* were used before doesn’t make them unique in the lore.  Tell me what part of her outfit makes it unique to her. Not the title of the item in the shop; the actual item itself. Those goggles aren’t unique. Neither is the Newsboy Cap. Or the coat. Maybe the boots were unique?  You tell me. 
---
The Battlecoat is a pre-War item. It’s just an armored leather trenchcoat. That’s not unique to the BoS.
---
The Mechanist?  Ah, I ***LOVE*** when people throw this one in. Because the Mechanist *you* remember from FO3 was nothing more than a ***cosplayer***. He didn’t create the persona. The Mechanist was a pre-war fictional character, like Captain Cosmos. 
---
Scott Wollinski didn’t ‘create’ the Mechanist. He simply used the pre-existing **Pre-War** character and built a suit and some tech. Same for the other Mechanist from FO4,  Isabel Cruz. Both of them were inspired by the **comic book character** *The Mechanist*. 
---
Here’s the thing: You say you’ve done your research, but you honestly thought The Mechanist broke lore?  Then so does the Grognak Outfit or the Captain Cosmos outfit.
---
Just because something wasn’t spoonfed to you doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. And just because you didn’t see the link between event A and event C, doesn’t mean event B couldn’t have happened.
---
Something is only lore breaking when a new, verifiable and unbreakable piece of information directly contradicts a previously verified and unbreakable piece of information. 
---
Example: The Ranger (Tactical Riot) Armor. Just because we only saw that in New Vegas didn’t mean it was the only place it could have existed. And in fact, the lore states that the NCR found the armor in per-war police department and military caches.  So there’s no reason Ranger (Tactical Riot) Armor couldn’t have been in other police department caches... like **Charleston** Police Department. Which is why the versions in FO76 have **CPD** on them. 
---
Just because something new is added doesn’t mean it breaks the lore. It has to contradict previously established and incontrovertible evidence to ‘break lore’. 
---
***Nothing in the Atomic Shop fits that description.***
---
Have a good day.
---
very weird, but not so bad I guess.  
---
Another user said a repair might fix it, gonna come back later to you and tell you how it went.
---
When Grahm says that he set up Meat Cook in tall grass and it was a bad idea, look around for wildfire patches.
---
If it’s a bug, don’t fix it Bethesda!!!
---
Its caused by running down the mag, fast switching between a heavy with a large mag, and fast switching back.
---
Cosmetics and camp items are available to all characters on an account.
---
Consumables such as scrap/repair kits, perk packs, caps and lunchboxes go to whatever character you are on when you claim them. You can unlock them on any character but if you dont want them on that one dont claim it. Switch to the one you want then claim. Or unlock on the character you wish it to be on.
---
Atoms are account wide too.
---
Yeah it definitely changes once you figure it out. Try messaging a level 200&gt; and asking them if you could buy some screws. They may give them to you. I would.
---
Piper’s outfit is hardly unique. The *combination* of the coat and the goggles and the cap may have only been seen in FO4.

Killing legendaries
---
agreed. if you can paint the outside of the PA, you should also be able to paint, or re-colour the inside too.
---
No no, I love that bug. Cause it on purpose.
---
I'm not even made about the guy one shotting the legos. They were probably scrip anyway. I'll take the TNs though! Finished my bullion desired plans on one character with 50 banked
---
neat, I guess that's a feature.
---
Why are they booing you? It’s not like... You’re wrong...
---
You know I'd be alright with a talking suit like the stealth suit from NV or the Prototype medic power armor from FO3
---
Huh! Every time I fight the SBQ I usually shoot at it while it’s flying around with a tracking rocket launcher to help get rid of the weight and it always tells me that I have like 20 rounds to fire and just keeps launching and it even happened with a Fatman and I was wondering wtf was up
---
It's true. I don't play much anymore, but I know that I had given up any pretense of using perks to create a build. They're just ways to carry everything.
---
I loved playing this game, but the endgame just bored me. No way do I go in for "grinding as content", so I shelved it. But I must have done ten different playthroughs on multiple profiles.
---
If I recall correctly, then the BLD minigun is magic (in other words glitched to do insane damage) if you use an accelerated barrel to get the fire rate above 200.
---
Well, I use a online map that gives suggested level ranges so I'm never really going in over my head. Unless it's in the divide where I've seen lvls ranging from 9 to 70+ so I still only go at night and quietly explore. I don't dip in and get in a few shots, that's cheap IMO unless you've been invited to tag along.
---
exactly this
---
yeah, but you have to grind for prime meat, and that just might be possible if events weren't BUGGED and FAIL even tho you killed all the enemies spawned.
---
Whenever the weekly post comes up about people asking to close doors or stop killing their Brahmin comes up, I always stop by to comment “no I don’t think I will”
---
They're a queer bunch here on Reddit at times...
---
None of it felt like the old Fallout stories. It doesn’t feel like they put any effort into 76.
---
Eh, I fixed it anyway.
---
Bethesda's cartography skills haven't improved much since Tamriel.
---
Everything is highlighted in the same low-contrast yellow, with the exception of non-team player vendors. Someone decided to make those easier to see, which means they know the yellow shit is hard to find but only fixed the thing that concerned them.
---
Not to rag on Beth too much but sometimes they do seem like a mechanic that keeps your car for a month, fixes the wrong thing and breaks something else. Or maybe my mechanic is like Bethesda, but that's the WRX sub.
---
In retrospect, it is not that bad compared to bullion/ ss armor / Gauss weap roll grind
---
if vats were fixed id concur, but its not.
---
it will be great to miss 70% of vats shots (or hit and have no damage registered) AND do less damage at the dame time.
---
great fun.
---
i have plenty of treasury notes, i get way more than 20 per day. a month or so ago, i had 500, &amp; have been converting them every day, now i have just under 800. at this rate, I'll never clear them all, unless i just go online to convert them &amp; do nothing else.
---
It’s not a bug, it’s a feature!
---
But Todd, they’re using it to their advantage!
---
*pulls out M9* YOU BETTER FUCKING FIX THAT BEFORE I PUT TWO ROUNDS INTO THE BACK OF YOUR SKULL YOU PRICK!
---
~~battlepass~~ season
---
Not a fan of exploits tbh, but I wouldn't mind it happening again.
---
I only carry the high capacity on me for those rare times I am overencumbered and cannot drop stuff at my tent.
---
Railway rifles, especially bloodied ones are super strong. Don't let these haters discourage you lol. 
---
You absolutely *must* use it in VATS if you go full auto due to the insane recoil but the cost per shot is pretty low.
---
Go choo choo, motherfucker. You'll love it.
---
Well, if you ever need help moving stuff over into other characters in future, I have a totally blank character I use to help my friends move stuff around. I’ll be happy to help, free of charge. I have the stuff I need already except for an ass/sent set of armor.
---
Well if we assume everything is duped that what is even the point?
---
Fact is not everything is that much duped.
---
I haven't been able to find him after the first few I did either. 😥
---
Then you’ll hate favouriting and equipping the fireworks... Massively increased reload speed. Brilliant bug, specially for noobs and PvPers.
---
Yep. Already gotten the clock and metal picnic table
---
Personally I think they should add plans to make ANY Legendary weapon in the game.
---
Perk loadouts are coming.
---
No, not everything is duped. But if you come across a high end weapon, it’s likely to be duped and unless it’s a unique legacy (i.e a JE90 GP), you can guarantee it’s duped.
---
Planned for winter
---
No, it should be "i used to be a rpg."
---
Thanks for the offer. It's just I move stuff between 3 to 4 characters and it always takes a while. I feel bad asking anyone but I might have to take you up on that offer.
---
Wouldn't happend to have a bloodied handmade for sale would you? Lol 😂
---
just build an underground base. i did, &amp; in the past 2 months, I've only had to replace 2 walls. I don't even have tutrets anymore. enemies can only attack above ground, so being underground is pretty safe.
---
OR! Stop the crashes...but yes Play with team option should do this...while your at it hold my spot in the world. I crashed and some random took my last player spot in the server...
---
I had to read that title three times..
---
also, having my ally above ground hero's clear out any nearby stragglers.
---
[you agreeing to someone suggesting crafting any weapon you have plans for](https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iegg8n/_/g2g8nrb/?context=1)
---
I’m not sure. I have two, but one’s on loan and I’m planning on using the other. Although I haven’t done anything to my main at all. Not even put any points into my SPECIAL. Still 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 and I haven’t opened a single perk pack.
---
I dropped them before I knew about that bug :D
---
Why didn't you reply to that post then??
---
I went to the work of farming Unyielding for this set up, and then it bored me out of my skull. I started to miss just running around with a non-meta set of PA, some big guns, and a Grognak Axe for flair.
---
Yeah I was just playing the drums in meat week and didn't have any option. Which button is it anyway?
---
S1 should end ~07.09
---
Colosoal is only on pc there is a new npc at foundation near entrance
---
If you are on console, need to wait for colosal problem to be released. 
---
As for the season, look at the game board. Count number of spaces in front of zorbo. Believe it ends sept 8 but they could always extend.
---
Does it matter? Lol.
---
I believe the Colossal Problem starts when you nuke Monaugh mine.
---
Season 2 is due to drop sometime in September, I think I read but don't quite me on it.
---
Season 1 ends when dude gets to end. He moves 1 space a day. Hope this helps.
---
I don't understand this 200 fire rate thing. My Bloodied gauss minigun has a fire rate of 91 and it's bugged as fuck. Kill a queen in 2 seconds.....
---
I always thought they were listed under Aid. Thank you for letting me know.
---
I have the same but in bloodied, since the prime cuts I've been trying to stay under my weight limit. I also like to collect stuff, I've got all the nuka colas and teddy bears.
---
If you don't need XP desperately then their is no point to be honest, running about in a frenzy trying to kill the widely dispersed spawns is pretty boring, I'm running wes tek still for xp, I prefer it.
---
This\^ pointless, waste of fast travel caps.
---
LOL that's a great discount, but 8750 caps is still 6750 caps more than I have.
---
Weight reducing armor and perk cards are your friend. I don't know what level you are but until you get some of those thing you're going to be struggling all the time.
---
FO1 isn't quite pay-to-play but the summoned storage chest is close to the line. It sure is damn handy though.
---
What she said....
---
you don't need to kill anything, you need one hit to register a mob. A lvl 1 can do that.
---
I have no idea why people stoke pile treasury notes only 20 a day can be turned in, do they eat them?
---
Meh it’s just a one star, could be worse
---
This.. do it in all my characters gives you the best of both worlds
---
If they added a pvp respawn timer or not allow you to respawn right back in the same area instantly maybe. I wouldn’t want it to be as bad as Ark where if you die by pvp you lose everything you’re carrying usually but the way it is currently leads to broken ass builds. I don’t even attempt to fight back when I get pvp killed bc it’s usually some 200 levels or higher than me so I know it’s impossible for me to really do anything about it. There’s always going to be end game players that like to curb stomp low levels, I’m not going to give them the satisfaction of constantly murking me. One guy kept trying to kill me after I would empty my extractors but I place a stash box right by them so I can instantly dump my junk.
---
Bethesda doesn't care, you probably shouldn't either.
---
Fair enough. Such a move would be too much for me, however. The grind for good gauss shotguns and miniguns was so wretched, not to mention the effort over many months to acquire all my other gear. If it all got rendered obsolete I'd have to stop playing. I'm not doing it again.
---
Wait, is there a way to message people? I thought it was all voice chat and emotes?
---
Yeah just go into social? I’m on Xbox not sure if it’s different on pc
---
Instead of fearing people might actually have good guns I'd rather the game was balanced so more weapons are viable, or so that people could use "unoptimal" weapons they want to use but no market exists for.
---
I would imagine it's quite hard to get a really good roll on, say, a rolling pin because there is no real source of people keeping them to sell. Now that we have all these silly chef outfits maybe somebody would spend modules on making themselves a decent rolling pin just for something to do or cosplay?
---
The way the game is now you do not get that luxury, you hope and pray for a drop over the course of months or you start asking around and hope somebody just happens to have whatever silly thing you want. I'll just never understand the fear that more people might get optimal gear because it's equally likely there are are people that simply don't WANT optimal gear.
---
'Kree!'
---
Same thing happened to me. Super annoying.
---
If your on ps4 add me! I'll be your friend 😊 this game is about the community.
---
I can offer you some of my grinding routes for stuff:
---
I like to hit up WV Lumber Co, then I hit up Sugar Grove. Full of desk fans and the like. When I’m done there, I go to Bog Town. There’s a building that when you drop down into the roof, you land in a room that’s full of typewriters and desk fans. I might have to add the Wayward to my list...
---
Alternatively, if you’re at the level where killing Deathclaws isn’t a sweat, you can go to the Abandoned Waste Dump in the Mire to kill the Deathclaws inside, then server hop to go and kill them again. Good for gears and black titanium.
---
I'm almost at this stage now myself. &amp; i end up buying legendary bits, simply for scrip, but then, i find i hit the daily scrip limit too. so then i buy legendary modules, &amp; just put them in my stash. i currently have 100+ modules, &amp; am unlikely to use most of them. if i could put them into my vendors, i would, but then we'd back to hitting the caps limit again.
---
It does matter, yes. You are basically putting my words in their mouth to argue a point *I* made.
---
It’s a real shame you can’t trade those or I’d give you one of mine lmao
---
Udders. Hot.
---
I have this issue as well. Must have been a bug in one of their updates.
---
They overrated
---
Select a quest and one of the options should be show in pip boy. Dailies quests work well for this.
---
It's a bug unfortunately :(
---
Thanks! I use WV lumber but I haven’t found the other locations you mentioned. I’m only level 14 so definitely not killing any Deathclaws at the moment. Wayward doesn’t really have a lot of stuff, I just looted it while reporting back during the missions. I wouldn’t go out of the way for it.
---
Use the perks to move around the world but when u get there swap out the weight reduction perks for damage.
---
Can't wait for loadouts.
---
Beth knows we want them so holding out, lol
---
I'm still using a full set of less-than-optimal robot armor because every piece has some useful combination of auto-stim, lifegiver, improved sneak, and weight reduction in ammo, weaponsx2, food.. pretty much makes me an immortal moving truck.
---
I can't say no to 8 TN I get a hour tops most days and never weekends
---
They agreed with you...
---
This is so last,last year.
---
Yep... I’ve gone the 2nd account route and that already got its 5 characters at max caps. In total I’ve got 8 at max caps and the two I actually play are both 20k plus. It’s crazy.
---
Oh man, I’m an idiot. Thank you, kind stranger!
---
I'm sure you're very popular with that helpful attitude
---
My concern isn’t for the market. It’s for a sense of progression. Being able get legendary gear of your choosing early on seems boring to me. That’s my opinion. I don’t like to rush things.
---
Okay, 760 is still not enough, at the very least it should be 1 atom per hour.
---
OMG this is so needed!!
---
Too many blue screens and long match queue drove me away from an otherwise fun team play mode. That and afkers in bushes get more xp then me getting 6 kills and dying in 7min. If I'm doing something and rewarded less it's pretty universal that it's going to drive people away.
---
The only one I can think of is big bend tunnel west right east of ash heap and above homewright estates
---
Used to be 20 atoms.
---
While I agree it isn't much for what's asked, this post wasn't created to discuss a massive change. Just a post to make some people smile.
---
I would take you on a power level run but I got hit pretty hard in the ban wave. I duped 300+ legacies and god rolls and about a dozen sets of ass/sent combat armor, then sold them for caps to the people who couldn’t get anything despite the state of the so called “economy” where caps are worthless.
---
Core game - Raiders.
---
Wasteland - Wasteland.
---
It doesn't mean they think my idea is better than theirs though. You are putting them in the awkward position of arguing for an idea that wasn't theirs. I'm more than happy to discuss this though.
---
Or offer a real life shirt made out of canvas!!!
---
If you have FO1st you can actually go into your private world and drop whatever you need to drop to transfer items to your alts. I do this all the time, either regular drops or public containers work. Also if you have C.A.M.P blueprints that you want to transfer to your other alts you can claim a public workshop, place it then have your alt blueprint them. Just one of the unfortunate benefits of having FO1st, especially if you have no friends. I really believe this game should have its own mailing system.
---
Yes, but the server will time you out if you don't move in game for some amount of time. While using an instrument I read it may be 30-40m.
---
Would be fun way to poke fun at themselves
---
I've weined myself off of travelling pharmacy. Still yet to do it with thru hiker though, that's my next step, to free myself up of 3 agility points will be bliss.
---
I have to have batteries included though. And bear arms. It annoys me, but I cant see anyway around it.
---
I'm bloodied and I had healing factor and this bug happened to me 90 % of the time. I just tried removing heal factor and test fast travel after 20 times : no bug anymore. Just my experience. I'll come back if the bug reappear despite of healing factor removal.
---
Don't ever count on it ever being fixed, they haven't even acknowledged it.
---
i use https://fed76.info/pricing/ for my prices and thats the price it gave me, if you know of a better place to price things id love to know.
---
My concern isn’t really with PvP, all death should have consequence.
---
This is the best thing I've read on reddit today! Ty for tip
---
tomorrow never comes, just how it works
---
Problem with me is, without being in power armour I die constantly.
---
I'm PA I'm super tanky.
---
Every 15 minutes off of the hour (8:00, 8:15, 8:30, 8:45, 9:00) ,  on xbox some servers tend to start 2-3 minutes early/late depending on server lag
---
Legit just have to shuffle around things when you want to put a heavy in the vendor, otherwise I'm playing with 50-60lbs free space + if marsupial. Reduction of energy ammo was the game changer for me, all those cores
---
This is gonna sound disgusting. Private server is your best hope. I know, they create a problem then sell the solution.
---
Some people go to roleplay and have fun from it. I met a man who was roleplaying as trader, and we had a the best ingame conversation.
---
I’ve got four 3stars all using .45, to do whatever I might need - vampire, explosive, quad fixer, etc. plus the 90% ammo weight perk. I don’t even think about it.
---
Sound like east of harpers ferry, the rail bridge is pretty wide with a collapsed train tunnel at le east end, I used to put my camp there.
---
https://i.gyazo.com/743d6eadcb00f2dd5c24418be08f2d9d.png
---
I know I was pretty surprised the first time I died that I could just spawn right back where I was, grab my bag and continue on as if nothing had happened. At least make you start back at your camp or vault 76 if you don’t have a camp. Not sure of any other game where dying means absolutely nothing.
---
It won't change that the game mechanics suck...   
---
The last wendigo boss is just an other sponge with heavy armor, there's no team strategy apart shooting like new year's day  until it dies... For what? A helmet that light functionally works?  
---
Number sucks, a bullet should be a bullet missed,  hitted or bullseyed.
---
I have the bug sometimes (comes and goes) with my third character (heavy weapon build) and don't have that mutation. Never experienced the bug with other characters.
---
I had it for a while, and now I haven't had any trouble with it for weeks. It seems to come and go and be totally random.
---
I like to drop some loot while playing the chemical drum. My loot bag is the gut sack.
---
There is only one train tunnel I can think of and it's right next to harpers ferry. You can see the traint racks merge on the map. You can't build a camp there anymore however, since it will be used for future content
---
Have you done the burrows? Level 50+
---
Toys and typewriters, check the fairs and willard's, whitepring toy shop and DMV charleston 2nd floor, also a building in bog town with typewriters on one floor and concrete bags on the other
---
Brotherhood got me hoarding concrete now lol
---
They elaborated on your comment about limiting trades if you own the plan. I disagree with their idea there as well. I don’t think any plans should be craftable legendaries.
---
Its the size not the power they look at 😅🤣😂
---
I’m not AFK I’m playing Grognak and the Ruby Ruins
---
Yeah I get it, but it has been said that it could occur with any health regen, such as food also, maybe that ?
---
what if i'm using an instrument but also holding down the W A S or D key with some sort of weight
---
No, because I love the game. Love reporting exploiters and watching them get banned though.
---
Not big bend east or west, that’s very operational now. I think you mean east of Harper’s ferry.  Two tracks converge over a bridge into collapsed tunnel.
---
You can build there although not close to the cook fire.
---
When are they going to fix this problem being a longtime Fallout player this is no excuse we are working on it other games keep you updated and they automatically fix the glitch you're telling me money-hungry Rockstar can fix a glitch in a matter of days but Bethesda can't fix it and it's almost 2 weeks
---
Imo the camp attack system is stupid. People always ask me “how do you stand living in whitespring? Don’t things always attack you?” And ... no. The only mobs that attack my camp are the ones that the game spawns in. Why would 4 ghouls be randomly interested in eating my walls ?
---
I’m thinking of making a new character next double XP weekend and it will focus on food, chems and weight, probably going to be melee since All Rise is easy to get and just focus on making him into a all around survivor instead of my power armor walking Death Star or my stealth addicted crack whore lol.
---
That's exactly the one, quick on the mark there! Thanks.
---
Sure, I agree if things were acquired early on that would possibly be bad. That's why I suggested at the end of my original comment we could tie it to gold bullion. Not only is that an end game currency the more things that can be bought with it the worse the crunch is for it. The more things you are buying to make legendary the more you need scrip. Hell, who's to say the legendary plan for a legendary fixer couldn't be some ridiculous price like 5000 bullion and use 5 modules per craft?(I am not suggesting this should be the case)
---
Add in the idea that these items could be made to not be traded and Bethesda could sneakily add in another grind that would be character specific. Suddenly all the people with multiple characters have a great incentive to log into each one each day to do all the grind stuff. I dunno, just seems like if done well it could be more interesting than the system we have right now.
---
i know it's possible from the pipboy, but op says this is possible from the map
---
That's a bummer, I had my heart set on that spot.
---
Literally never seen the plans for sale in 300+ hours, so it can't be as bad as you're making out.
---
I'm not sure that is an intended effect. It's funny and I love it because explosive arrows launch food into space. But I would have thought that's a bug- taking 1 container (meat pile) and turning it into potentially 5 individual items rendered into the world with their own physics to calculate.. Does not seem like a design choice?
---
I assume you have never been on the market sub? Traded on there all the time.
---
I went to the kitchen and got a drink and when I came back he worked
---
People already rush through wastelanders content just so they can start earning bullion. I think this is poor game design. No wonder people think wastelanders content is short, they rush through it.
---
Any reason why people don't sell it? Given its rarity, it'd probably sell for max caps.
---
If you’re on PS4 whenever I get them I turn around and sell them for 1500 caps. It’s a great cap sink. Better than shutting down my vendors every time I hit max caps.
---
Username checks out
---
Purely subjective.
---
I've never felt the need to grind treasury notes.  The limit means even at it's worst (barely playhing for a couple of days) - I had plenty to turn in.
---
I've never not had 20 to turn in prior to being able to turn them in....
---
Ugh I know it’s so annoying. I finally have every plan from the whitespring resort, bunker &amp; robot vendors and finding something to spend it on is kinda hectic. I usually try and stay at around 10,000-15,000 caps ... pretty safe amount
---
I can't recall at this moment but doesn't moving take you off an instrument? Or is it tab?
---
If not, that might work! It's worth a try
---
hey level babies need a good weapon too, found a lvl 5 TSE pipe that makes you the supreme ruler of flatwoods and bought a lvl 10 perfect storm (the 10mm sub w/ pyro effect) that I hand down to my leveling babies like the family heirloom it is. I even have a mythology about it like Zorro where the kids get the mask and the guns and keep the legend going. TMI.
---
Sounds like how I used to level my stealth up to 100 in oblivion.
---
U can add 15 each time just gotta be quick cause it ends fast.
---
Yeah, whenever I put my power armour on I have to up all my weight reduction perk cards lol it's a pain in the ass.
---
So are you indeed saying that in your opinion this system is ideal?
---
😂🤣😅
---
I would assume so, kinda pointless to not have a BoS themed handful
---
Get some secret service armor plans, my dude!
---
Yep. On here. That site, whilst useful, isn’t very accurate. Just do a little search and see what an item usually trades for.
---
SS Underarmor + Shielded Mod
---
Either the Chemist or Grocery Backpack Mod
---
Secret Service armor plans, but wait level 50 to craft it
---
It’s because the higher the fire rate the more likely the lag hits. That’s supposedly what causes the ‘magic’ damage.
---
Nope.
---
I got a zealots explosive fixer.
---
.. And I can't do anything about it really because I've hit my daily limits (credits, scrip, gold bullion, etc.)
---
Did you wait for the container inventory to load? Sometimes it takes 30 secs to a minute for it to load for me.
---
Otherwise, no I have been transferring scrip to all 5 of my characters every day for the past few weeks and never have an issue.
---
Isn't that like packrat lvl 3, (genuinely asking because I am only lvl 11) 😅
---
Stimpacks and gunpowder are notoriously heavy,  yet you inadvertently get them from events which you might not notics
---
It's all good. I don't expect my suggestion to even be considered by Bethesda and I totally respect your opinion on wanting a grind. Personally I want freedom and choices with my build and to be able to try out whatever seems interesting when I think of it.
---
Recently fell in love with The Dragon and would friggin love a bloodied version, an instigating version and whatever else it can spawn as that might work with my Rifleman build. As it stands that Sony isn't possible right now without trading and that bugs me. I took grounded to help my defense while I waited for a bloodied Gauss rifle to drop... That was 500 game hours ago and I still haven't rolled even a 1 star version of it.
---
It's all a bit much lol.
---
Yes I was in the chess club.
---
Its cool how happy Graham gets when u feed Chally.thats my favorite part, the worst - picking up his poop 💩
---
They made a simple math error and unarmed became pretty bad according to the multiple posts about the damage nerfs. The devs later admitted it was unintended
---
good point actually
---
&gt; Sell the shit you’re not gonna use. There is no reason for you to hoard 1 * Level 10 legendaries. You don’t need Scrip that bad to buy a 3 * armor that frankly, you won’t wear anyway because it’s Wood Armor and you’re rocking Marine.
---
I'm not sure if there is a real answer, but sell it where?  For what?
---
Cap npc limit is easily hit.  (and even if it wasn't - then youd' just hit the cap limit).  
---
Which basically brings you back to 'dropping' them.
---
Not if they are duplicates
---
"My stash is full of junk!"
---
*buys 1st*
---
"My stash is full of weapons I cant use yet"
---
I go a little early now a minute or 2. Use the time playing the drum or turning the grills. Or just running around, I actually picked up garbage and Challys poop before it started so we had a clean area.
---
No, just did again last night
---
You're an absolute star, but I'm XBone.
---
Blocker. Serendipity. Full uny armour. For a start
---
Plus you can shoot through them, and at their tallest, no one can jump over them without a jetpack
---
 Oh, I got the flag last night 🤔 lol.
---
Full unyielding set + nerd rage perk + adrenal reaction mutation + starched genes perk + class freak perk should get you started! Get Egg Head for a bigger Int boost too 🤘🏼
---
Huh??
---
the idea isn't horrible but implementing that would be a nightmare, bethesda can't even stop hackers when every part of the game is stored on their servers
---
Nope. All good. Saw post people lost stuff but when a hit fix was active.
---
No. I transferred over a bunch of stuff last night without any issues.
---
Had similar problem. Primal Cuts tends to crash me in the Mire if the queen at the end has a chance to drop her spawns, too.
---
Yeah, I've been trying to sell some speed demon serums and no one seems interested lol
---
Yes!
---
This ATLAS event is a load of complete and utter bullshit. Reskinned diluted Christmas presents are unacceptable.
---
Sorry. On the trade forums. That gun will reach a   B2525 or J2525. It wasn’t duped and with the vats instead of ffr it’s very good on the queen and similar high end bosses. Fed is good but not very accurate as far as cap pricing goes
---
I just stay near the entry structure where Earle can't reach us and at best run into the harmless wall.
---
Nice. I’ve yet to get a legendary fixer drop. I’ve got the plans 4 times now but never the gun itself.
---
My main weapon is a furious fire axe. His name is Buddy Hack-it. Would you like to meet my Buddy?
---
Sweet I'll give that a try that after meat week is over. I'll assume that if I mess up a platform inside that there will be no way to remove it because of that dumb error about the piece not able to be disconected.
---
&gt; use your friends to transfer stuff to alts for storage. get rid of excess aid and junk and ammo. I use FO1st to do it and every week i have a proper clear out and i get my stash weight down to 350. Feels good man.
---
I have fo1st and a mule account.  All 5 character slots are full - each character is in the 13-15 range.  (leveled off of cooking food).  So they are running the perks that help with weight.  
---
Once a week?  That'll work if you aren't playing much.  I normally need to do it every 1-2x days, depending on how much I'm playing.
---
The only things my mules have even at this point, are:
---
1.  Some additional flux stabalizers (glowing mass / hardened mass) - probably 150lbs worth.
---
2.  Fusion Cores.  (about 400lbs).  
---
3.  Everything else - legendaries to script.  ~3500lbs now.
---
The mules vendor everything else over time (food, chems, etc) to hit the 1400/cap limit.  
---
The frustarting part is - removing the script limit would do two things.
---
1.  SImplify management - I could just script it all.
---
2.  I'd get to buy more legendary modules - letting me keep rolling for more attempts at slightly better prefixes.
---
3.  Make it feel like I'm actually accomplishing something when I get legendaries.
---
Yeah i really dont like fed the prices make no sense cause everyone i see in game doesnt even go by those prices
---
Don't horde. My stash is never full because I don't horde shit. Like wise I only ever get over encumbered due to me hording unnecessary shit.
---
Maybe not. Thanks for the advice. I’m glad I didn’t lose too much. One mid tier weapon and scrip but I was nervous that they patched.
---
I am doing it right now - no issues 🤞
---
Yea its hard to get so i was very surprised to get it from the parade, did not know at the time it was even a chance.
---
\*hoard
---
I've already done that, two copies and two Xbox lol mine and me sons. Just still a pain tbh.
---
Nope. Anything north of 25k in value is going to be trade only.
---
I’m a heavy gun build so the Gatling gun was perfect for me. Although I wouldn’t mind a rifle sometimes.
---
You can get around the time out problem on console by going into photo mode and setting a joystick with a weight like a cell phone or pillow so the view spins around you.
---
Also, this actually helps people at the meat cook a little bit, as the drums and meat spits rack up a little bit of progress towards the event during the prep timer before the actual cook time starts.
---
You can still launch nukes
---
It's one of the best armors in the game if you have all of the pieces.  assassin, Sentinel, powered is one of the strongest pvp armors
---
Thanks for all the responses. Glad it still works.
---
Thats not the issue here bud..
---
You are correct about not being able to remove it. 
---
The way around that is this. While working to finalize the foundation placement, jus use regular stairs and floors, until you're ready to settle on your foundation placement. Then start stair glitching. It will save you hours!
---
So... what's your point?
---
Don't forget to claim your up to 200 per day from the raiders camp or foundation.
---
You'll want to start early...
---
No problem, glad you didn't lose anything too valuable.
---
Haha if they patch that without giving us an alternate way to transfer items between characters, I will for sure cancel my subscription. That's like 80% of the reason I use private servers. 
---
The other 20% is for private nuke farming, which I'm guessing if they patched the ability to leave and rejoin the same server, would kill that for me too.
---
Thank you and yes I'm on Xbox explains why I haven't done the fight yet
---
Bandolier under strength reduces ballistic ammo, batteries included under intelligence reduces energy ammo, including cores, and something else reduces explosive ammo (missiles and nukes)
---
The times have not been consistent for me at all.
---
gave my last gold to you, you'v earned it.
---
been preaching this shit for many years on many games and always falls on deaf ears, to those who do notice but complain its usually with responses like "hue hue you hate game you try nerf everything! just buff everyone to \[meta cheese here\] level and everyon r have funz0r!" which A: do not help the games health at all and B: even if it DID get buffed to be the same as \[meta cheese here\] then everyone will feel exactly the same and you end up playing a boring cookie clicker.
---
sometimes nerfs gotta happen to make the game healthier for everyone, if you HAVE to be the "MLG pro 420 blazer" that just HAS to kill everything in one hit just to make people notice you, your not proving anything to anyone, beat the games hardest content naked and with a pipe pistol and people will consider you a damn legend and not a chicken wuss.
---
This, and yes, wait till level 50 to craft.
---
The backpack mods are from the faction vendor at Crater/Foundation.
---
The Secret Service Under Armor and associated mod is from Regs in the vault.
---
So maybe go for backpack mods first since you can benefit from those immediately. The under armor mod needs flux, which you may or maynot be able to get easily.
---
You can still go through the entire experience. The only difference is that a ‘check mark’ in your log is there. 
---
And this isn’t a ‘Public Teams’ thing. It’s been a thing since the beginning of you were on a private team.
---
Yup. It’s time to switch the game off easy mode for a while. 
---
One of the main reasons I quit after launch was that this game was an easier version of Survival mode in Fallout 4. That was the hardest game to get to the plateau I had ever played.
---
First time it took 17 minutes to kill him; me with a magic minigun that didn't work and a temmate with a lvl 35 be fixer.
---
He ignores 80% of damage and is tougher than the SBQ.
---
Bring AA, Furious or even Bloodied weapon, even if you are not specced for it. There will be plenty of health loss...
---
What is the issue? It's the same tedious mission and anti-climatic launch every time you run it.
---
Can you only get treasury notes if you've completed the main wastelanders quest?
---
You said you wanted to experience it at your own pace. You can still do that.
---
I have 5 and while I can move them around all of them are currently bloodied.
---
Keep lots of deluted stims and deluted rad x, and keep an eye to rads, fire and venom because they are the real enemies. Don't team up with people who uses Sun Kissed perk
---
Expect to die.
---
Especially to poison.
---
Daaang, alright, thank you :)
---
I'm pretty sure that'll become a free mod in no time ;)
---
The only times I ever get overencumbered is when I nail an exacator boy and he drops 200 lbs of junk. Never have stash issues either. Maybe learn basic resource management skills?
---
Actually, yes.  Yes you do.  Please provide your IGN so we can gain access to your camp and stare creepily while you wait for your +5% XP buff to kick in.
---
The burrowing event enemies at the bog location and occasional interruption of event enemies by a SB at both the big and mire locations can mess with getting all enemies. The hidden molerat or scorpion issue in the bog has been a bit of a problem every meet week. Nearby camps can exacerbate this issue, but, interestingly, really simple camps with enemy-accessible turrets and punji boards push the burrowers out of hiding to attack the defensive elements. Enemy spawns love to attack the nail boards...
---
Can't speak for pc but I don't think rare plans were ever duped on consoles. Especially if we're talking about possum BP plans.
---
Plasma grenade plans were from duped presents.
---
Sneak is your friend. Put 3\* Sneak card in agility: with full set of uny armor mobs won't detect you even when you're literally walking 1ft from them. Silenced weapon or melee to attack of course.  
---
3\* Dodgy in agility is a must, as well as 3\* Serendipity in luck. When playing alone, also 4\* Lone wanderer.  
---
Now let's do the math:  
---
Lone wanderer is 20% incoming damage less, Dodgy is 30% incoming damage less at a price of AP you've just got from Lone Wanderer. Then Serendipity gives you a 45% chance to avoid damage at all. So you get half of the damage slightly more than half of all attacks going at you. And you're almost undetectable when sneaking.  
---
Now add Nerd Rage to this for some more damage resist and AP regen that you needed for your 3\* dodgy and you die about the same rate as full HP builds.  
---
3\* Fireproof would give you 100% resistance from scorchbeast screams.  
---
2 parts of 25% poison resistance would give you immunity against green poison from SB but this is tricky to find as you'll need Uni armor with poison resist.  
---
Then just distribute rest of your points to have decent attack. For example, with 3 x 3\* rifleman cards, 3\* Tank killer + 3\* Concentrated fire I can produce \~2200 damage on headshots with .50 cal sniper rifle (shows 468 damage in pipboy when under 20% health)
---
It's a joke bro lighten up.
---
That's actually really handy!
---
I got the fence only, no regrets
---
Then there should be a colorblind mode.
---
*Whored
---
People posted screenshots here of players inventories showing hundreds of backpack plans lol
---
Oof.. yeah.. that hurts.  That's why I keep a close eye on my caps and make sure to keep my total ~ 10k.  That and making sure not to have so many high price items that people could clean me out with a couple of purchases. This includes huge amounts of ammo.
---
I want to test builds. I don't want to roll new toons.
---
Fair enough mate, I appreciate you taking the time to helping me understand why this is unsettling. I can understand your concern here. I have heard a lot of people will be hit badly by sneak, and I love your build because it's literally my go to in every single singleplayer bethesda/obsidian game. Stealth archer/sniper is extremely fun but i can understand why it sucks in 76.
---
However, saying that, whilst it is very fun (and I hope this doesn't sound insulting) hopefully the perk loadout update can help assist you maintain your build composition whilst also being able to switch out to another more competitive build easily when it comes to these particular events. After all I guess they are kindve optional events designed to push players to their limits and provide a challenges. 
---
This is why I ended up going for strength build - in this case that melee ends up bad for me I can always just switch out 2-4 perk cards and then I'm a shotgun main. Again and I'm a heavy weapons main. This helps a lot with the casino style of the legendary drops and I try to actually build my character around the best weapons I have. 
---
It may take some experimenting but I'm sure with a few perk cards, weapons and Armours you could definately create a loadout that is competitive with these events. I'm sure this is what most players do when facing the SBQ etc.
---
Also bare in mind - Bethesda has a LOT of information that we don't. We like to think of the developers are bumbling wreckless moon chimps with no experience actually playing the game, but I've worked as a back end data analyst for years and there is definitely more going on in the background that we're not aware of, mass lakes of data, system capabilities, upcoming changes etc. The good news is that they're obviously looking at it as shown by the recognition of the unarmed nerf. 
---
After all, this is an MMO. I think maybe they're pushing towards a more traditional tank/dps/healer compositions rather than their traditional fallout one man wonder who can do everything character.
---
Atleast there won't be as many one hit wonder men running around making your character feel useless, there will be a LOT of people in your situation. If the data shows masses of people struggling, they may lower the HP/damage output of certain enemies. Who knows, the PTS changes so quickly
---
We will just have to have faith in father Todd, and remember
---
It just works
---
Gross. Not a single good piece in that. “Dream armor set” and the chestpiece has waterbreathing LMAO
---
In pc I wouldn't doubt. I mean there's flying players in NW so anything is possible 😂😂
---
Woah woah buddy. You’re asking too much of Bethesda.
---
I by all means, die alot. But with serendipity its significantly less often.  I just have to pay attention to my surroundings and spam vats before things get too close. I've been running this build for about 100ish levels now and its well-versed for most situations but not optimized for those crazy one shot kills all the time. Out of all the "sacrificed" perks the only ones that annoy me not having equipped is locksmith and hacker.
---
There are too many ways to easily manage this. I wouldn't confuse the lack of ability to manage your inventory with in-game problems. But that's just me.
---
All that's happened is that you got the achievement/ credit for completing it. Nothing is stopping you from doing it yourself
---
No on console, there was a duplication method of placing items in player vendors, loads did it, anything that could be placed in a vendor and had value was heavily duplicated, I can assure you :-)
---
Is Mischief Night that fun? Still pretty new to the game but have to agree with the OP, this event is fun.
---
When you click your map you get a waypoint marker. On a team, everyone's waypoint markers show. If I'm trying to navigate with the markers in my hud, there is no way to distinguish between my marker and joebob42069's marker.
---
finding teammates on the map is a chore. Sometimes I just give up and go shopping.
---
I've noticed that some folks just lock some of their aquifers. Good way to be kind and still make sure newbs can get some water too.
---
But that’s a lot of perks devoted just to carry capacity. It’s more practical to sell for caps. Or if they insist on people paying to remove storage limits, it should apply to your stash and not scrap
---
i wonder if the mike miners have any relation to the republic of dave
---
Wow. Oh well... That's FO76. Fixed one glitch, start 76 glitches.
---
Hi, I just tried this too and can confirm it did not get nerfed. I was in a public server, went to the Ag Center and all 3 fertilizer containers were unlocked. Hmmmmm.. I decided to retest by leaving the public server and joining my private server. All three fertilizer containers were locked in my private server. Well, this interesting, let me log back on a public server to test again. Went back to a public server and all three fertilizer containers were locked. I think the other person who replied is right, the containers won’t be locked in a public server if someone else has recently unlocked it.
---
**It iz horde yer 'umie scum**
---
you know.. you could just yank the cord and disconnect them?
---
so was that, ease up brocephus
---
You can get them via the Legendary Run, but generally you have to do the Vault 79 Raid (where you side with Raiders or Settlers) in order to get them to start dropping from Events as rewards.
---
Add that flechett mod to it let me know how it goes
---
Yeah me too...in FO3, FO4, Oblivion, and Skyrim I made effort to fill my home with every object out there, not now in this one, even the things on display cause issue.   
---
However, the sub price for 1st is not viable or wise for me right now, just have to deal.
---
People can buy from your vendors even if it doesn’t have power. When you disconnect them the only thing it does is make your camp vendor icon disappear.
---
Daily scrip is empty.
---
It's huge and really cool looking, have you placed it? It's one of those on a massive flagpole and under misc items. It's sweet! I just wish ghram did a better job of drawing the art on it lmao
---
I’d also like legendaries to be marked, or at least clothing separated from armor..
---
its not QOL if you can buy a solution
---
the hard part is getting your toon to look like rutger
---
Wait, do you need flux for the armor itself or for its mods?
---
Well in that case..congrats for real
---
AP regen maxes out at 60% regardless of buff source
---
That is a core mechanic in Fallout and TES games. 
---
Now I just set carryweight to like 999999 on the single player games.
---
Ah yes the coveted nocturnal/bash damage/250 reload DR/fire damage handmade
---
Infinite scrapbox too strong!
---
[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hoard](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hoard)
---
I assume it's like scrip where you have to exchange something for it?
---
Don't do it then.
---
Yeah poison keeps getting me too. Not much else does.
---
Aid in general needs broken out to drugs, food , drink , healing, mutations.
---
You can zoom in and out on the map to make events/ locations bigger, this makes it easier to join events when lots of players are in the way.
---
Yes please!
---
So you only get a benefit from one powered piece if you run action boy?  That doesn’t seem rifht. Why are so many players making full sets of powered armor. Do you have a reference? I’m curious because one of my characters has a full weightless AP set and runs all vats for medic/ vats crits.
---
Question.  Can a player play A Colossal Problem at any time the nuke zone is active or is there a time limit on how long after the nuke drops that a player can access that particular instanced zone?
---
You can be significantly tankier outside of power armor than in it.
---
Blocker? Is that just for melee? I’ve not
---
Done that one and I’ve been bloodied for awhile 🤷‍♂️
---
I actually had the idea that they should send a message that you need help. For example, once you shoot it, your teammates will get a message at the top of the screen that you request backup and help.
---
that... is silly.... &gt;.&gt; Whhhyyyyy
---
Nope. It’s STOPS melee damage. One of the best perks in the game got damage reduction
---
It's been thoroughly tested by many people including myself, yes, if you max action boy then only 1 piece helps, after that its wasted, better saving card points and not using action boy in that instance
---
200 =   
---
50 per Leg + 100 bonus for wearing the complet set of the Excavator ;)
---
I'm curious about the mobs that attack your camp. 
---
If you build in the forest are the mongrels and robots that spawn in high level??
---
I can see that being a major complaint from people
---
also none of the weight perks affect gunpowder and ore
---
Idk but it’s really frustrating that I have to waste workshop budget just so people don’t buy my stuff after max caps
---
Not encountered that yet, but my camp is in the Mire so it always been high level for me anywha
---
The buff has no effect after 3 pieces though.
---
There are lots of little quests you could run like mistress of mystery and such.
---
Yeah! I connected all my vendors together, used one wire to connect to the switch, then the switch goes to the main power source or another power connector. Basically, you just need all power to the vendors going through the switch.
---
Where do they spawn in? I haven't actually used the blaster yet, but I've been buying the ammo every time I see it in a player vendor
---
Oh well thats something new for me thanks for letting me know that 👍
---
Hmm I am going to need to sub that in for something
---
Oof yes. Might be easier to just remember where the next vendor you need to clean out is so you can quickly port and snatch up plans. ((Assuming you're like me and want /all/ plans))  That or world hopping so you can go find somethign to buy.
---
Destroy your vendors with flame traps. Locks and barrier are useless when most people have access to the power armor glitch.
---
I learned this the hard way. Luckily it was only about 2k caps lost, but it could have been much worse if the user that bought ammo had bought the entire stack of 5mm
---
For your #3 it's something we can all relate to.
---
It's absolute escapism for me too. When I'm playing I forget how utterly fucked the world outside is. For the time I play I actually feel like *me* again. Hard to explain.
---
TNT dome #2
---
i think it‘s 30 minutes like SBQ :)
---
Saw a flamer the other day that sounded like flames but was shooting like a .50cal the enemies burned up in an instant at range.
---
all carry perks and no weapon cards, I call it the glass forklift
---
no scrap left behind but your weapons are all marshmallows
---
/me does her part for server stability and runs around collecting the free loot...
---
I’m selling nearly 60. Just waiting for that one guy, usually in Excavator, to buy them all. I love food builds until they think they’re hard enough to pick on someone less than a twentieth of their level. I find it’s not PvPers, but food builds that are the most toxic in 76.
---
Thankfully I only ever need 1k of 5mm at a time for gattling gun sniping.
---
It's really not that useful. I'd much rather take the extremely rare melee hits and rely on my defense and serendipity to cover my ass. Freeing up those 3 points to put into something that doesn't help fringe cases. Granted, I'm a sneak rifleman so your mileage may vary, I suppose.
---
I hate when people have 20 guns for sale but when I see them they are just low level trash guns with no legendary effect
---
One piece of advice that I received and always do is to dashboard the game before you start a transfer.  I always do this.  I guess it kind of resets everything.
---
30,000
---
Well I mean you spent money on an emote
---
Commando
---
To begin with:
---
Full unyielding set (though specific armour doesn't matter AS much to begin with), 1 star bloodied auto rifle (fixer, homemade, combat rifle), serendipity 3, action boy/girl 3, adrenal reaction, speed demon, concentrated fire 3, as many commando perks as you can afford, bloody mess 3, set your health to 40 rather than 20 as balancing on that knife's edge takes a fair bit if micromanaging. 40 gives you a wider buffer while you get use to micromanaging health/rads.
---
Later on:
---
All of the above plus Blocker 2-3, nerd rage (need to be at 20% health or lower to activate), radicool (for carry weight if you need it), crit savvy, covert operative 3, ammosmith 2, stealth perks if you want but not critical with such high agility. Set your health to 20 try to keep it as close to 20 as possible.
---
Yeah, the Chemist backpack starts to become pretty invaluable.  I've started hoarding quite a few more Stimpaks, especially Super Stimpaks.  It used to be 20 of each, and I'd sell the excess for Caps.  Now, I consider 50 the average, because you can end up in one of these very costly battles, like with Earle or during the Daily Ops, that takes a dozen of them.
---
It's fun to a point... but like Encryptid and Project Paradise were when they both came out, it kind of feels like "kitchen sink design."  Just throw everything at the player.  A dozen Lv. 75 Wendigo Spawns.  Let them figure it out.  Or like when you have the enemies with infinite Perception and resilient to everything but melee, what's even the strategy at that point?  There's not a whole lot to it: you are forced to tank.
---
Oh yeah, never mind what I said, after one wasteland it will still be useless everywhere. Once you reach level 20 to use the level 20 variant, it will suck against anything you attack. Once you reach level 50 for the level 50 variant, it will suck against anything you attack
---
I'd rather it say something like "I'm never leaving the vault"
---
Could you try to have a friend present in the world?, just to make sure the world doesnt shut down
---
I thought perk points were just 1 to upgrade a card. We’re talking about fallout 76 right ?
---
The emote wheel has expanding slots... You have to actually open one of those expanded slots to find your new bought emote.
---
you know if you go for the 1* armor then you can get vanguards and then marine armor so...
---
I’m fine with the camps being there as long as they have turrets
---
I would save your scrip for legendary modules and vault steel.  The best armor sets in the game are bought with bullion and you need the two things to craft it.
---
If you want weapons your best bet is to check player vendors. I see some really great stuff in them.
---
They added this a few patches ago or since wastelanders.
---
I haven’t been. But giving us a loot pool that’s been duped so heavily, everyone and their mum has the plans is ridiculous. Even a low level will have them if they come across a duper’s drop bags. I found a dozen of even the rare plans at level 4. Literally more than a hundred of the more common ones.
---
MEAT Week isnt new content
---
So when u get swamped as a rifleman u don’t die pretty much instantly?
---
Perks: Serendipity 3, Nerd Rage 3.
---
Armor: 5 pieces of UNY if not using PA. Emergency Protocols if using PA.
---
Mutations: Adrenal Reaction, Speed Demon.
---
Weapon: Bloodied (obviously), although this is pretty optional, since with the above you'll be doing shittons of damage anyway. A Bloodied weapon is just the icing on the cake.
---
And that's about it. Honestly, the hardest part is finding 5 different pieces of UNY, assuming you want pieces with other beneficial effects too and not just 1\* UNY.
---
Did you equip the emote in the shop window?
---
People who duped thousands of legendaries and holiday gifts don't really care how much they give them away for
---
Mods AFAIK
---
Yep. No way in hell am I moving it either
---
Yeah I've ran most of the side quests I mean more for end game content? Is the burrows still a thing I remember when that came out but never went there. And is there a vault raid now?
---
Wow same...!
---
No vault raids yet, but sounds like daily ops are coming soon.
---
To add to that: if it's purchased then you load up the PTS, you have to re-equip them when you return to the live game.  
---
Same applies to any bag skins or tent skins.
---
The joke
---
Your head
---
Does the fence give off a commie vibe or would it work for just a generic military camp?
---
I'm a smart consumer bud, no newbie to this game they aren't anywhere, the shop or the expanding wheel. I'd do a bit of research before making such a claims.
---
Any build that doesn't rely on sneak benefits greatly from blocker.
---
It would need to be more of a wagon...there is sections of track destoryed right or busted up trains blocking the route
---
My point is they need to get their shit and fix it
---
Nope did it on XB1 yesterday
---
What platform are you on?
---
Exactly, if product don't work companies need to suffer the consequences. That is capitalism at it's best. Unfortunately other countries other than the US are actually holding companies like these accountable.
---
You may have been hacked by a duper who used your account as a burner.
---
I mean, I've seen people do the Fist Shake emote.  So either you didn't equip it, or you didn't expand the emote slot, or you have some weird problem and should open a ticket for a refund which they'll generally provide.
---
Did that
---
Yeah I'm also collecting them and have never seen them for sale on a player vendor. I already have the Fancy Single Action Revolver, but I'm still missing the Fancy Pump Action Shotgun.
---
I have the feeling that I get them more often from wild ghouls than from scorched. So most of my tickets I get from Radiation Rumble. 
---
At the moment I'm saving all my tickets (as they have zero weight) until the Atlas Bravo Cloth challenge is up (starts 31st August) as you get a lot Pre-War money from it which can be scrapped into cloth.
---
I was saying who spends money on an emote
---
Xbox and pc
---
In ps4 so not in pts
---
The ghouls from Radiation Rumble have a small chance to drop one, and there are literally hundreds of them spawning in minutes. I usually walk out with a few tickets after looting the area.
---
Looking for the same
---
Sometimes, sure. Generally I don't get swamped though. Really if it came down to it I'd probably prefer to get hit, get revived and run revenant over blocker if I was getting hit a lot. Something I'm thinking of doing once legendary perks free up some of my perk points, but I only expect that to help during SBQ, Colossus and maybe daily OPs if they keep all the super perception enemies.
---
Yes.
---
For some reason, this is the one sticky element that follows you from PTS back to live - it unequips your Atomic Shop equips.
---
Just enjoy it, Bethesda says duped and hacked items are perfectly fine.
---
Yes, I should clarify, select the quest marker on the map and one of the options that come up is "show in pip boy"
---
Not alone, done 3 of them and failed em all. Ps4
---
People who like this game have disposable income and want to support games that are fun. Unfortunately the amount of bugs has pushed me over the edge and I care no longer for the health of Bethesda as a company. Fallout series is dead to me now.
---
Caps aren't worth anything to us higher level players. We trade legacies for other weapons, gear, etc.
---
He was making a joke and you missed it.
---
That’s what I was thinking. I didn’t notice too many duplicates of these insane items so he was probably in the process of duping the items when I logged in and changed my password.
---
You knew the game was buggy so you should of considered the outcome
---
Clearly you aren't.
---
A duper would never do something like that.  The I are here to save us from the horrible rng and make this game playable.  We need them so very much! /s
---
Oh I've experienced the support system for bethesda. Even with proof the answer is 'sorry, cant do anything.' This is getting to far.
---
Yea not much point in getting mad, buying something for something that clearly has issues is a gamble, sounds like more research could've been used.
---
Unless they are planning to release the final 2 stars and they somehow contribute to increasing damage.
---
That's very interesting.  Always looking for opportunities to swap perks for armor effects and vice versa.
---
I see, thank you!
---
damn iv been wasting all this time doing the usual "do all the side quests before the main quest"
---
Alright, then you don't need to worry about it.
---
Would you please enlighten me? I'm getting tired of being a tin man in all my builds.
---
It's pretty odd, especially given the PTS character is an outdated copy.
---
I'd love to know what's on the backend that's causing it.
---
I’ve only passed one. No one shows up and the prime critters are strong enough that it makes me regret those hunters legendaries ive scrapped.
---
The best gear in the game is currently sold by Regs and the Faction vendors at the end of the Wastelanders quest line, with the exception of the Fixer plans from Encryptid if you want to go rifleman/commando, and Ultracite PA mods from the Queen if you want to wear the Strangler Heart PA.
---
In general, I'd say for now just so all your quests, level up as much as you can and move as little points as possible, and wait until Patch 22 goes live before you start thinking about a final build, then start looking around this sub for the conclusions reached by people who datamine and test these things in depth. There are soon going to be a lot of changes with this next patch to damage output, so it's wiser not to waste precious perk points that you'll need for Legendary Perks.
---
I have done it 3 times this week. No issues.
---
I have in the past had the "not loaded yet" thing happen where the stuff shows up after I wait like 10 seconds, or even open the container.
---
&gt; But I also don't study this game
---
make up your mind
---
Lag doesn't explain why a bloodied magic does a shitload more damage than a vampires magic.
---
I had someone buy close to 7k rounds at one time earlier this week o.O
---
As a bloodied commando I find blocker is an absolute must. Get swamped often especially at events and the new ones where sneak isn’t working saves me dying a lot.
---
Good looking out! I'll add this to my daily loop. Even if it's just a little every day, it'll add up nicely by time I'm ready to use the AB
---
I actually did the opposite and made sure to stay online during the reset, just finished the legendary run a week ago with 0 lost score. Not saying that’s the rule but that’s my little anecdotal experience there.
---
Well. It felt like shit while using it.
---
I've noticed this too! I consumed all of my water once and not a single pound went away and then randomly later it was fine
---
Totally agree, all advice written here only help in beginning, but when caps become useless and the limits start to push, you just have to survive. Because the actual currency is legendaries, flux, ammo, junk, which all weights a lot.
---
People kill a lot more time managing their stuff than actually playing.
---
I could see them buffing individual weapons but no way do they raise the level cap. All the veterans,  myself included,  would quit.
---
That would be amazing but only if we could change them on the fly the way we currently can with perks.
---
I'm at 1800 hours so quite a ways to go lol, A real life reward would be nice though.
---
Fallout 76, A Very Special Weight Management Edition
---
Level 99 here.. waiting for today daily’s to get off the grind train
---
Im on PS4 Luckily I haven’t failed any yet, but i agree with you, people afk way too much and this event really requires team work, or at least couple people who know exactly what they’re doing, and sometimes there’s bunch people running around but clueless and i do the carrying, multiple times i go there and find like 4-5 people on drums or grills and im the only one that supposed to do all the work!! Absolutely not I just server hop and let them enjoy their tunes along with their fail 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
A lot of bloody builds use bloody explosive weapons so blocker may not be for everyone when your own attacks hurt you within melee range. But it sounds like it works for your build.
---
Everything costs a red asylum dress now
---
I mean, the majority of the good items we all get from trading networks are likely duped, so I don't see the harm in keeping *one* unyielding set or whatever they put on your character. Maybe don't keep duplicates of one item, but other than that, meh.
---
Ya know, I tried to give this game some time hoping it would stop being so miserable and this was one of that last straws that broke my character's back. 
---
This is exactly what I did. After becoming frustrated with the carry weight (among a slew of other things) I got rid of everything I deemed even slightly useless, only carried a few guns (which run out of ammo or break after two or three locations), and just a bit of food, meds, and booze so I could carry more if needed. Boy was that a waste of time. It all gained me maybe an extra 20 mins of gathering scraps and I'm already encumbered again, only now I have like 3 weapons to choose from and I just wasted all the ammo I've been collecting for weeks in the matter of an hour.
---
So not only am I again trying to scrap shit and toss stuff so I can fast travel, but then enemies respawn in the area I just cleared out and now I need to deal with them again or at least enough to get my junk out of there, because I need it to craft more ammo to replace the ammo I wasted trying to get scraps for ammo.
---
Then the DLC came out and it was terrible writing, with a boring story line that offers no actual decision making, and to top it off, I'm still spending more time on item management than actually doing anything.
---
So yes, I did this, and at no point did I feel like I was "rocking". I was bored and annoyed. Bad combination for a game you're expected to grind in.
---
I thinks it because gauss counts as exploding, even though they’re just lil explosions, and exploding effectively doubles your fire rate when counting towards the magic bug...
---
There are no other storage devices. All storage is the same stash void (or isn't part of your camp and therefore not safe/stable.)
---
Could you be bothered to share your build? This sounds like what I’m planning for a rifle character but I haven’t tweaked it to perfection yet.
---
Ive managed to get my carry weight up to 350+ in x01. If I do the legs on my excavator I'm thinking around 400. Which is just under my backpack carry weight.
---
Just make sure you do each faction's quests up to the point where you have to pick a side (the quest names are pretty blatant, but you get a pop-up too saying if you continue further you'll miss out on the other faction's stuff).  Maximizes the rep you can get from each of them and the rewards (i.e. you can get the Chinese Stealth Suit just from the quests leading up to siding with Foundation, rather than being forced to buy it with Bullion).
---
Its a known bug.  You either have to server hop (a few to several times to complete it) or complete it on a private server.  Who knows when they are going to fix it. If you want to progress on the main quest you have to do one of those two. Also next time try searching your problem. I myself have posted about 10 times this response.
---
Fireproof eliminates explosive damage or a dense mod. I’m not a fan as it breaks sneak to much. Don’t really have any other perks I need tbh. Huge damage. High carry weight and decent survival and big crits.
---
I had already self-nerfed my damage in order to stack my INT to 15 points for more experience near the beginning of season one. My Stealth Commando Bloodied per-shot damage has been under 200 for some time now and I've still killed things ridiculously fast. My damage goes even lower when I am in night forage mode, when I swap out all the Commando cards for the fun "find it" perks and the +3 INT night card. I still do well because 140 damage per shot is still far higher than a standard build.
---
I am looking forward to having another 14–18 points to spend (depending upon how many Coins I end up getting), so that I can have all my forage abilities, my quality of life abilities, \*and\* my higher DPS abilities all slotted at the same time and still be right where I am.
---
But you did assign it in the Atomic Shop, right?
---
Had that happen to my shotgun. It was nice but I still tried to reload every few shots.
---
Yeah would be neat if after you get 7600 hours you get a email from BGS and they send the shirt out to you, or some other item.
---
I didn't ask for your opinion
---
Primal Cuts is a crapshoot. It seems like about a third of the time, it'll fail for no fault of the players.
---
If you're worried about the items ruining your experience, drop the items during the cookout at the meat week event and let people have their way with them.
---
Drop one item, let someone pick it up, then drop another so hopefully different people get them.
---
No burden on your soul.
---
Last night I finished a Prime event with one other- we kicked ass together and got the rewards...but no meat. 
---
Is this common? 
---
Annoying as hell to go through that and not get the item it’s supposed to be about.
---
During a week like this where they're rolling out a new events they hotfix servers. Therefore you won't be able to get back on the same private server sometimes. You're best off waiting until events / updates are over.
---
My defence is 600+ without power armor, with power armor its less than 500
---
Armor perks, mutations, etc.
---
Yep I’m usually in during the change over, the only time I lost points was a day when I wasn’t on.
---
Today is the last set of daily’s I’ll need to do .. so obviously I’ll lose all the points today.. it just works
---
Probably a Minigun user.
---
So healing factor is preventing FT?
---
Or have a friend stay on the server.
---
And yet, somehow we chew through .308 &amp; 5mm faster than .50
---
I only used to use my X-01 in Nuke Zones. My Chinese Stealth Suit means I never have to use it again, thank God.
---
They did a similar thing last year and both events were identical.
---
I agree. I participate in nearly everything, but I have stopped doing this event because it is just too frustrating to fail 50% of the time for no good reason.
---
Yeah, you earn treasury notes from events, then cash them in for gold bullion at the exchange machines. You can cash in 20 notes per day for 200 gold. 
---
Also, first purchase should be secret service chest. Then save for the jetpack mod, it’s a game changer. Not initially, but as you keep getting SS pieces, save the ones that have the 50% reduced fall damage perks. Two of those pieces and you’re a god damn super hero, never taking fall damage.
---
Have rads and have the radicool perk and nerd rage
---
PC?
---
Wastes a lot of good ammo too.
---
This keeps happening to me, so I've stopped doing 'primal cuts' in certain locations (Top of the World and the Bog). I have no issues at the other locations, so I'll continue with those. Gives me a break from doing it every 15min anyways.
---
PS4
---
Sadface. I'd be willing to grind for that one potential extra item. Ah well, didnt play last meat week cus the game was so broken. Hope they do add another reward. Thanks for the reply!
---
Merfs are over hyped
---
Too relatable. Getting rid of carry weight restrictions in previous games was the single best thing I've ever done in the series. It's actually an insanely fun looting game when you aren't thinking "should I loot this" and just grab it, and it significantly cuts down on downtime between quests.
---
I just hit level 55ish in this one and can't get myself to keep playing as my stash is full and I can't do long quests without inventory management breaks.
---
Obviously. My point was there's no right or wrong way to play - what most people accept as the 'best' would be dreadfully boring for me. Half the fun is finding a playstyle that suits you, rather than just following the pack. So long as you're having fun, then you're doing it right.
---
you only have to bang the drum to start the event..
---
likely one of the mobs spawned and was drawn away from the area for some reason.. chasing another mob.. poor AI.. whatever the case may be..
---
I see it Happen most often in the bog and forest.. 
---
forest prime mobs chasing radstags that spawn there is the worst but the spawns are relatively close to the barrel unlike the bog
---
to a lesser degree the divide is a pita too bacause of all the trees.. often the hermit crab cant make it down the hill all the way...
---
I don't know maybe it's a coincidence but I haven't had the bug since I removed it and I've been fast traveling around flat out doing meat week events
---
Dying is a big part of it.
---
Bold words
---
Interesting, I’ll give it a try, thanks man
---
Happened twice so far this morning. Annoying.
---
So does the chick with the guitar when she sends you to retrieve the weapons case.
---
I've actually had people shoot at me and complain over voice chat about me being on the drums 🤣 some people don't understand the event at all
---
Me too
---
My first few went really well, but now it's started to have a high failure rate for me. People just don't show up (Grahm doesn't even show up to his own meat cook, half the time), and those people who do show up either afk or obviously don't know what they're doing.
---
So yeah, it started off well, but now people seem to have stopped caring. Has everyone unlocked all the rare rewards already?
---
I have not had that problem on PS4, we just run to them.  Was there a 1st tent or camp at the event this causes issues.
---
Fasnacht took too long, even longer if someone decided to drop power armor
---
This is the best use you can give to it. Then, you slowly grind for the rest.
---
You should get on the instrument, then access your pipboy via the map and try holding a key down then. I don't know if this works but it's worth a try.
---
Had a time where I was the only fella banging the drums and trying to deposit critter chunks as well, and the other four players didn’t even bother turning the spits..
---
can find em at my camp
---
Wow, I guess not.
---
This has also been happening to me. It’s gamebreaking for bloodied builds like me
---
What’s the drop rate of the fancy weapons? I spammed 120 Tickets the other day and only got a suppressors revolver but no shotty
---
I couldn't stand the repetitive guitar riff long enough to find out.
---
If you get any spare plans sell them for very cheap(10-20 caps) since your target market is newbies.
---
It's just a regular looking fence, nothing commie about it.
---
If you want to learn it yourself, it might be a long time before you get a second one you could sell.
---
The scrip limit has me wanting to pull my hair out. I built up a decent amount of legendary modules while grinding out faction reputation for the Gauss weapons. I want to craft as many as I can in order to try and get the rolls I want, but if I did that I would find myself overencumbered and with a full stash.
---
I could live with capping the amount of things you could buy with scrip on a weekly/daily basis, but PLEASE let us scrip legendaries whenever we want.
---
Sugar Grove

The office building inside Abandoned Bog Town
---
The Whitespring Bunker
---
Bonus: The wendigo at Freddy's house of scares and or Wendigo Cave
---
Desk fans, globes, typewriters
---
Yeah, it's not very clear from the event itself, I admit.
---
I liked Rose. She was the only thing with character until ra ra. The only thing I hated was everytime I logged in her voice would play on my pipboy until I finished her quests

My math might not be working right on this. But the legendary machine scrip limit should be 400. Because it's not fucking fair that I lug around these shit weapons with no stash space. 400 should buy back every shit weapon I got from cashing in on my 1k scrip
---
Kinda fits the request... I spotted this during Quakecon at home where Pete Hines was playing Fallout.  https://clips.twitch.tv/AlertBlightedPartridgeDeIlluminati
---
Look, I’m just passing along what I’ve heard.
---
Bethesda just said that they’re changing damage modifiers from being multiplicative to additive because that makes the coding easier for them.  So who knows what is what inside their spaghetti code.
---
Thursday. It's a literal week.
---
Back in my day the cap limit was 20,000 and each vendor only had 300 caps on them and we had to travel to each on across the map to get caps from them.
---
I believe you.   I was lucky then,  today, with the 10 percent.   I went into a couple on the last wave and they ended fine.   I don't doubt you're seeing it, tho.
---
Your argument is bs because its not a rebalance its just a flat nerf. Nothing that was useless before is better it might be less bad but its still trash.
---
I'd like to have waypoints on the compass for unlooted enemy corpses.
---
So obviously the bug doesn't rely on being log in or not.
---
They are very accommodating with atom shop purchases, I bought gold skin for .44 revolver thinking it was for western revolver, they refunded and I got to keep the skin, my fault but they still helped.
---
I dont play chore simulators. Good for you tho.
---
200caps, 7 vendors. Hence why it was converted to 1400 for all
---
You technically don’t have to. It is completely optional, so I just let the rest of the server do it while I only log on once an hour. Of course, doing the cuts ups my note gain even more.
---
It’s runs from 1100 ET on Thursday 8/20 until noon ET on Wednesday 8/26.
---
Lvl 50 in Flatwoods ? Sounds good.
---
I think i read enemies would only go to 25 in the  Forest ?
---
Certainly! Now I run Bloodied. As a result, I had to keep my health below 20% to get the most out of my Unyielding. Sentinel armor is the best, because it has flat damage reduction, regardless of who or what it causing it but only while you’re standing still. [Here’s my melee build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1843eb&amp;d=ss2sm2se2sn2s42em1eo2eh1c72ir2a72aj2a12la2l71lt2lu2a04&amp;w=ar2pe0eu0) and my commando was running [these perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f845cb&amp;d=sg0pg2po2ph2pp2pi2em1eo2eh2c72ib1ir2a72ar2am2a12la2l71lt2&amp;w=lu2).
---
My commando had a full set of ass/sent armor, as well as legacy laser rifles so she never got killed in PvE, and was rarely killed in PvP (this build leans toward PvE more than PvP, but this build could do both because of the sheer DPS and damage reduction perks on both armor and build), and my 2H melee was designed for solo queen killing, so needs to be tanks anyway. I wasn’t able to get a set of Uny/sent armor for him, but 2* Uny heavy combat armor did just fine. Power armor has a standard damage reduction of 42% when using all 6 parts, and combine that with emergency protocols you’re hard pressed to find anything better until you take inti account Serendipity doesn’t work in power armor, but it works with sentinel armor.
---
I assume that when you're in your power armor this no longer counts right?
---
For that amount of time i want a statue of ME not the character. Like submit a picture of me and everything. But it would probably break the game so never mind...
---
Scrap kits are my usual go to when I'm doing a long haul explore at least for junk then it's try to find a workbench to break down all the excess weapons that I'm hauling around (Scrapper perk is plus for this) 
---
Also, as for your weapons max the weapon artisan perk and you can over repair to 200% 
---
(Or if you have friends with that perk ask them to repair your stuff once in a while in exchange for the raw mats you would use yourself)
---
EDIT: If you can be bothered with it, get a 1st sub for the unlimited scrap storage
---
Just bought fallout first to try it a month. Such cheating with the scrap box. Stash went from 800/800 to 400/800 after moving all the scrap over to the UNLIMITED scrap box/storage
---
I just had that at Encryptid. It somehow only happens there.
---
[It ends on Wednesday 8/26.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/72tNixuDqBoHEVDsI3Dc29/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-pts-a-colossal-problem-and-meat-week-begin-soon)  Not Thursday. It’s six days long. 
---
‘Meat Six-Day Time Period’ is too hard for Grahm to say.
---
Thanks bud! I'll do that
---
I'm really curious how they plan to meet demand for the Series X, due to Corona their production of Xbox Ones is down to 25%, I called every gamestop, walmart, pawnshop, and thrift store for 60 miles when I was trying to find a replacement for my Xbox, gamestop now has a policy where any console they buy has to be sent in to be cleaned internally, with a roughly 2 week turn around, walmart hasnt had them in stock since the stimulus checks went out, and the pawn/thrift shops also hadn't had any brought in since they have limited hours or are closed since my governor is still holding us hostage even with a downtrend lasting a month. 
---
It wasn't until I called this cool ass store called 2nd &amp; Charles that I finally found the one and only Xbox One X within my search radius, which technically covered 3 states, PA, Del, and Nj.
---
Edit: For anyone who doesnt know what a 2nd &amp; Charles is, its basically a nerds paradise, or Hot Topic meets game store/record shop with comics, and collectables thrown in.
---
Dragon skeletons did it in Skyrim.  Old bug...
---
This is entirely why I don’t play anymore.
---
I log in, I’m overencumbered, my stash is full, and I don’t feel like dealing with it again.
---
They wont. They cant even fix shotguns.
---
And nobody asked to see your shitty armor, yet you posted anyways.
---
meat week meat week
---
You have unyielding gear?armour with wwr fwr jwr?same happens to me.remove your armor see what your max carry is without the armor buffs and keep it near the max then put armour back on.def something to do w weight..
---
Bought it specifically to use as a sign for my camp.
---
Why does it bother you so much my dude
---
Thanks just wanted specific time tbh (should have put it in title)
---
I just failed 3 back to back.
---
The worst one was the one in the toxic valley. For some reason the dumbass radtoads all ran straight towards Willard Corporate Housing and we had to chase those fucks right into the floater posse that likes to hang around there. Failed because there was no time left.
---
Fix this shit.
---
I'm on PC - most of them failed the first day for me, but after that the success rate went way up. Didn't even come close to failing any yesterday. The event is a little complicated if you don't do any reading about it beforehand. It'll get better once people get it figured out
---
I am with you my fellow gaurdian you will have my setinel shield as backup
---
So "focusing" in a quick-scope increases the hit chances?  It's not the same as an auto-aimer like VATS tho?
---
I thought she was the most annoying character of all fallout games in all honesty she was a scummy raider and deserved a death far worse than drowning because of her insane murder filled boy toy.
---
I’ve got a commando build - all automatic weapons, but can swap out the equivalent rifleman cards if I need to. Perception is 11.
---
My armor is built around stealth and vanguard legendary perks so my go to gun is a quad fixer. I also have an executioner legendary for when I’m in power armor, a vampire model and an explosive (rarely use that)
---
Also have a couple of melee weapons - strength is 15 and I use slugger perks. Go to weapon is a vampire mr handy blade - I just let it spin and it can cut through anything and I don’t have to worry about healing. Also have a 3-star legendary sledgehammer that. Has one of those 5-upgrade mods you get as a prize, and a zealot grognaks axe for scorched.
---
Mainly I’m a craftsmen - intelligence is 15, so I have all the perks for making upgrades to anything. Make amor and weapons more durable and more powerful. I sell heavy combat armor with BOS upgrades and maxed out fixers in my store. Sometimes I’ll go do leader of the pack, upgrade the level 5-15 legendaries I get then give them away to new players.
---
Old. Not sure what triggers it, but I had it happen twice in the space of days, and since then it hasn’t happened once for months. 
---
I suspected it was to do with constantly not being able to place camp down and changing worlds numerous times in quick succession, as that’s when it happened previously, but that’s purely anecdotal.
---
Seconded.
---
Had it happen once when I crashed while somebody was shopping at my vendor. I just assumed the game clears out your vendors and displays when that happens as a safety measure to stop duping. Crash recently?
---
The math only applies if you only bought 3-star weapons and nothing else. If you bought 20 2-stars instead of 10 3-stars, the conversion would be 300 scrip.
---
idk every server I've been on you better get to the event 3 min early because its ending 1 minute after the timer is up, if not sooner.
---
I feel like the fact that you haven't addressed anyone who is asking if you remembered to equip the emote means that you haven't tried that. 
---
Try that. Both of the emotes you mentioned are working just fine on my end. 
---
This post is unnecessarily dramatic.
---
I'm pretty flush on ammo atm. So it's not my first instinct. However if I'm short on time or I've hopped to a few different vendors with no luck thats almost always what I do as well. Tho I'll usually buy the rest of the stack if they have .45 for 1c
---
I failed like 3 or 4 in a row because the boss never spawned in. So much wasted ammo and chems.
---
Lol. "Crash recently". Um, ya. Its Fallout. 
---
Honestly I'm not sure exactly when it happened. It happened last night sometime, I just noticed my map icon changed. Sometimes people find my on/off switch. I thought that's what happened and I didn't bother to check since I had a ton.of caps.  Oh well, time to restock.
---
It’s amusing when people delete their posts once they realize they are completely wrong.
---
Remove or raise the scrip cap. That’s it.
---
you can turn in 15 each event. just stop running the low level primal cuts
---
In 3 weeks.
---
The second nuke doesn’t even have to be on the Queen. So if you nuke another place like Whitespring, it’ll reactivate Earle.
---
It is fully cannon that happened to Chinese Americans, you visit one of the camps (Little Yangtze I believe) in Old World Blues in New Vegas and another one in Point Lookout in Fallout 3
---
That’s messed up. The best course of action would be to send a ticket to Bethesda.
---
Thank you, great explanation! I'll definitely try the commando build, seems very solid. 
---
I prefer tanky builds over sheer damage, especially when the damage nerf hits. I think it will become an important factor when enemies are able to reach you and hit you more often. Right now we kill them so fast it's impossible for them to touch us.
---
I have a full set of leather armour, all with Deep Pocketed and the "Weighs 90% less" legendary, took it off and I seem to be right about the max already.
---
It’s an instanced event. Only 8 players can be in one instance, so maybe you were just the 9th to join. Other option is that the nuke was dropped ok the SBQ, since it’s glitched rn and if you drop a nuke on the queen while there’s a nukezone at the monongah mine it will trigger the colossal problem aswell.
---
That would be cool
---
Ohhhhh, _waypoint_ markers.  Gotcha.  Yeah, agree they should be distinguished somehow.
---
Yeah, that's our next course of action. It's weird because I haven't seen this issue with other players and it is mildly infuriating.
---
the Colossal problem event has a max player count of 8 per instance, so if you are #9 then you are gonna be alone in your own instance
---
If you're just ignoring the Crater Raider's, you probably won't get the dialog options with them from Ward's daily. If you're still sitting on Hostile with them, or at a low rep, you might never see the options or hear about how 'they need Foundations bonesaw to take off grampa's leg!" The Blood Eagles will always be hostile, but sometimes Ward's quest has a Crater Raider that you can talk with.
---
She doesn't have negative stats.  The (-) only denotes that the stat number is reduced by something.    Her stats are different than yours because she isn't getting unyielding bonuses.
---
She has +6 Str and +6 Int.
---
Edit: re-read.  I don't know why removing the perk would negate the (-) but I suspect it is just visual and obviously related to a bug with class freak if no mutations are present.
---
Instigating Minigun, no need for perks, that one is magic if the fire rate is near 200.
---
You shouldn’t carry that much junk on you and it’s an online game, so maybe it was just your internet? No issues at all for me all week and I didn’t seen many complains about the servers also
---
Thanks, I'll keep an eye out I guess. :)
---
Okay, I gotta ask... Why did you have literal weeks worth of junk on you and not stashed? I mean, yeah that sucks and all but why carry weeks of grinding on hand?
---
Yeah I’m not having much luck with the servers lately, seems to be crashing more than usual but I gotta ask why you’d risk running around with 3 weeks worth of junk on you without putting it away in your stash lol
---
definite over estimate on plans at the moment, come 6 months tho, the tenderizer plans, its mods, might be a bit more pricey since they have a lower rate
---
Spin meat spits or play the drums while the event start timer is still running. Progress counts and when enough people do this the event starts with reward stage 1 completed.
---
"Climb in back and we'll be off."
---
my favorite part of this event is all the acid/stimpacks/hides left on the ground at literally every location.
---
Doesn't doing this have a chance to glitch your character so the pipboy is unusable?
---
You killed him because you had a “magic gun”.
---
I loved this idea!!!! Applied skins would affect PA UI as well!! Way to go!!
---
Refrigerated All Day Every Day.  I swear it works better than Good With Salt.
---
&gt; so let's pull that instigating explosive minigun I've found the other day
---
That's a 'magic' minigun. Instigating is one of the 'magic' effects, and that's why it made mincemeat of him without you even being spec'd into heavy guns.
---
It would be! 😀
---
No thanks. That’s how I got trapped in Skyrim last time...
---
Damn.once I dripped the extra pounds the respawn bug hasn't happend again.the day before every time I died I had that bug..sucked f.c to main screen die and do it again
---
lol carrying 3 weeks worth of junk?
---
sounds like you need to do a serious cleanout of your stash
---
Sounds like it worked as expected.
---
I expect most people are off doing the Primal Meats events as you stand a much better chance (2 events per hour, no nuke needed) of getting more and better legendaries than you do wasting 5k round of ammo on Earle.
---
Since this isn't happening to the vast majority of players.. at least not on this scale, I'd have to suspect that you have a networking issue.  It probably isn't the server since you are able to rejoin it apparently.
---
hey I'm helping with this as I love free stuff. I've picked up 3500 acid, 220 stims, quite a few legendaries (these were in bags) as well as I eat all the honey, and snatch all junk. Only thing left when I'm done is stuff I couldn't see or meat, and even that's picked up and all placed in one neat little bag. Hardly takes 5 minutes.
---
This, I tried to join a buddy on my team and got put in a seperate instance with only 1 other person.
---
Almost always a tent. Is that what is causing the issues?
---
Highly agree!
---
Yes spawns them away from event
---
My camp was there before the event, i spent an entire weekend building it as a permanent home. I am not moving for an event that spawns in like fifty places on the map for a week.
---
Is it only a decent effect on heavy weapons? I have an instigating plasma caster with bonus vats damage and crit chance but it's kinda underwhelming unless I'm fighting creatures in the lvl 50 and below range.
---
Whoever posted that he/she got 3\* is either lying or accidently mistaken. The cookout only drops 1\*. He could have gotten the thing from prime meat events and is confusing them to the actual cookout.
---
100% of my problem would be addressed on this if displayed items didn't count against the stash limit.
---
The weight limit in the stash is dumb. It should be a count limit with a separate one for junk.
---
You on PS4? MooGang stands together 🐄
---
I have never had a 3* in hundreds of cookouts since the event first dropped
---
Everyone asking why I'm carrying this much junk, my stash isn't clogged with crap, there's a couple guns for sale and a couple hundred in aid, I run a PvE pack mule and the most effective way of hoarding is vendor sales, crafting and recycling~
---
The stash just can't accept 300 lead on top of the other stuff, I carry 500 stimpacks bc I can't place them anywhere else and this build made junk light~
---
It hasn't been a problem before and in the rare occasion someone steals my crap then cool, you got the motherload, enjoy it~ but when it's a server crash long after a buggy death then it kinda hurts~
---
It's really laid back and chill. I really enjoyed my Saturday participating in it while doing other random stuff in between :)
---
God I can’t wait for ACP on consoles. Sure it gives you 8 treasury notes but the actual fight looks fun as hell

I’ve had several disconnects and crashes in the past few days both on private and public servers.. probably the worst it’s been since beta
---
I think that is likely the case.
---
Yeah that's where mine is too, and I am finally selling out of all those plans I have been hoarding.
---
Huh. Didn’t even know that was on option. Good to know!
---
Does not work with walking cane. 
---
Weapons you can add to the legendary pool by learning the plan: 
---
Gold bullion weapons, Fixer, Bear arm, Sheepsquatch club, Sheepsquatch staff and tenderizer.
---
You don't lose hp when your hunger/thirst bar completely empties. 
---
I let mine run down to nothing for half an hour when I was trying to catch the Woopsies.
---
People on the spit and drums are actually the hero’s of meat week. When the counter starts counting down they are making the bar progress even though you can’t see it. Last event I just did I got there and all spits and drums filled so when it started the bar was a fraction away from the end. So when it’s counting down go on the drums/spit and you’ll hear the ringing sound of the bar going up, even though it’s not there.
---
This is Bethesda they don't care about your opinion
---
3 weeks worth of junk? Are you sure you weren't the one causing server instability?
---
Put on Pacifist and don't attack anyone at your camp.
---
Didn't knew it was instanced. I've just clicked the event icon.
---
I had a cat named Phoebe as well, he was nine when she got out of the house and never came back. Condolences.
---
*Laughs in 340 carry weight without my high capacity backpack*
---
Yes it's a common issue.
---
I read that in life alert's "help I have fallen and I can't get up" tone. Hhahaha it made it even funnier
---
Does it reduce carry weight also ?
---
That shit needs to be fixed :/
---
I didn't attack him ... he just flew in on his jetpack &amp; slapped me with some huge melee fist, then trashed my camp 😖
---
At the time was you wanted?
---
Well.. that's stupid. Thanks for the info
---
Tall camps are harder to move successfully. You can help yourself out by storing anything that isn't inside the house. It helps a ton when relocating.
---
Nope, I was crafting at my weapons bench
---
Was the player wanted?
---
Your second point seems a little contradictory.
---
its 1.5% for each, see:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fancy_pump_action_shotgun
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fancy_single_action_revolver
---
I just don't want to have to play Bloodied all the time. I have the perk loadouts (with the mod) and the gear for it already, but I really like the Instigating build and took a long time making it work.
---
The new events having the whole "Sneak is not a possible thing anymore" rule just kills it all the way for me. I don't even care about losing a build, rebuilding isn't that bad, it's that playing with sneak has a unique tension that I enjoy a lot. In Daily Ops I feel like a boring rank and file soldier instead of the assassin feel I enjoy.
---
With the new nerf and events I have to play Bloodied to deal relevant damage and I have to abandon my main source of fun in the game (that tension while sneaking).  It's not going to be good for me, no matter how you spin it.
---
Chall the moo-moo will remember that when giving out your meat week rewards
---
No.  Has worked every time so far🤞
---
Some of the surrounding trenches would be fun as well.
---
Yesterday it was just me and one other person. I donated 15 Prime Meats and we still failed. 😞
---
&gt; some players like myself built camps nearby for others. 
---
.
---
&gt;And tents/camps break the primal cuts events
---
I wish Rose and Abby survived. My two favorite characters in the game...and we never even actually get to meet either of them.
---
Might've been a slight exaggeration, it was a couple hundred of pretty much everything except flux and titanium, thought the titanium was near a hundred, I get that you're attempting sarcasm but this game runs like potato when you leave the vault~
---
I've gone through the stash and removed all holo and notes, mulled down the stash as much as I can, I even carry 6-7 guns that I like so they don't take up space in the stash. I might just be playing the game 'wrong' by thinking I can hoard everything I can flip and for the most part that's the playstyle that got me into the hundreds, it's been manageable when I can manage it but things like this aren't in my control~
---
Should have specified that I mean camps around the cookout. Primal cuts shouldn’t have either
---
Instigating combat shotgun. Just using it. Doesn't matter if you're shooting directly or using vats. I'll get the blood animation and the hit sound. Health bar will either not move at all or it'll go down and then right back to full.  It was irritating before, but after the last update that added the meat week event I can't really use it now.  It's probably 30-40% of the time. No joke. Sometimes I'll have a solid 15 seconds that it won't work at all.  Have a hardwired xbox,  it's on a ssd, 13 MS ping and gigabit internet. No lag.  No packet loss.  I've even tried a fresh install.
---
&gt; running from the moonshiners shed is a pain. 
---
easier to use the free 76 FT point and run down the hill rather than up
---
I am glad to have my space magic brethren backing us up!
---
I was at the one in the Savage Divide last night, and then I noticed it was going to fail because there was a mob under the map. So, I teleported to the event in the Mire. It was the best decision I made all night, there were four legendaries at that event and enough people to actually complete the event.  If you're at an event, and you start to see that it's going to fail, leave it and FT to another one.
---
Unyielding armor/bloodied weapons. 
---
Or junkies.
---
No kidding.
---
When he smacked me yeah .. it says if I put on pacifist a player can still murder me .. but then I can't even try to defend myself 😧
---
I'd be pissed. I have rare gear - rare because most think the slayer's items are scrip fodder - and it took 2000 hours just to get or buy them by chance.
---
Also with 1 wasteland, I think you still get sub-max level legendary mobs so the gear would be sub-optimal again.
---
I hope it can take more than a few missiles unlike the last guys
---
For efficiency Bloodied explosive rate and vats crit fill and for dps Bloodied Faster Firerate faster reloadspeed
---
Edit: based on my opinion
---
It’s more about the legendary effects complementing your build. Fast Fire Rate weapons generally give the most damage per second. So I use a bloodied fast fire rate fixer. My build with all commando perks, nerd rage, adrenaline, adrenal reaction mutation, low health, etc. are what make the weapon the strongest. You can do optimal damage with many weapons if your build is right.
---
That tooltip is old and doesn't apply anymore. Get rid of Electrically Charged and/or Unstable Isotope Mutations. They are weak and will cause issues like this.
---
Around the time you posted this I was doing a mest cook with six other people. All afk but none of them on the drums or spits.
---
XB1 🐄 moo gang
---
If you’re holding them when the event ends they disappear but if you pick them up the moment you see you received some caps you can keep them you have maybe 1-2 seconds to do this but I was able to stash some which remained after several events, displayed one but it didn’t have a model, put one in my vendor for people to see and drop one at primal cuts
---
That literally happened to me for the first time yesterday.  Had like 240 something shells in the clip.  That one didn't bother me though. Lol
---
No brahim is safe. We must stand together brother!
---
That was in the real game. The footage he used was PTS
---
Well i don't know about you, but my 50cal is alot more accurate than my minigun, that and with the spin up of the mini, I end up spraying the scenery as well.
---
I dont have enough kidneys left to sell to feed an LMG for more than 7 seconds.
---
Remember two years ago when the stash was only at 400? Now that was a nightmare.
---
I see it Happen most often in the bog and forest..
---
I think the ash heap is the best spot to avoid this happening..
---
It can take alot of damage
---
You didn't get everything. The prime beasts begin to spawn much further out from the drum and it's best to split the party so you don't waste time running back and forth.
---
With bullets? Ah the American way.
---
It depends entirely on build. Bloodied Weapons deal the most damage if you spec for it. Junkies is widely regarded as best damage for full health. Melee weapons typically deal more damage per hit. You should think about your preferred play style and lean in to a build that suits it and find weapons to fit the build. I play Bloodied like a lot of players cause I like trading HP for DPS but there is no overall 'Best' weapon or 'Best' armor. A handful of people like Bloodied/Junkies + FasterFire/Explosive + reducedVATS/weight
---
I have adrenal, grounded, marsupial, scaly, speed &amp; twisted. 
---
So how does the pacifist mode work now?
---
And a Moo fan 🐄
---
So no Unstable or Electrically Charged?  Okay back to point one. Put on Pacifist and Don't Attack anyone at your camp.
---
Maybe they meant someone dropped/gifted 3* legendary item at the cookout. (I tend to drop the junk legos at the event.)
---
I'm pretty sure I remember that post from yesterday, and if it is that one, then they were refering to primal cuts, not the cook out.
---
Were you on a team? Sometimes you can be dragged into hostilities because of a teammate.
---
I would rather earn them with each individual toon..
---
wild how people have different opinions of the same thing...
---
TIL they aren't listed as "Aid"
---
The battles were epic, and Fallout takes place right after those wars.
---
Not worth the risk, to me.
---
I’m also seeing this issue over the past few days on Xbox game pass for PC. It lets me join a friends server, but then doesn’t allow us to team-up!
---
Thats a lot of damage!
---
Bandolier is an absolute necessity. Two ranks give you 90% reduction in ammo.
---
Nope, just those I listed .. like I said, I didn't attack him, I was crafting at my bench .. I've put pacifist on, but other players can still attack me wtf lol
---
Thank you for telling me that's the first time I ever knew about I'm not being sarcastic it finally worked
---
Nope, solo m8
---
Targeting hud is as close as you get...
---
I’m on console so when I’ve got a player inside my reticule lines and i squeeze LT, for a split second I’m aimed right at their head. It doesn’t track but it’s great for crits in a close fight.
---
It won't.  Being online and able to update games is the best and worst thing to happen to them.  Now it doesn't have to be fully tested and polished. You can fix it in post.
---
Build is ok to start, but I’d recommend testing and optimizing it. A lot of unnecessary crit perks that doesn’t help much. Glass cannon now that they fixed the bonus HP bug is hard to run. Adrenaline 5 is good, but I find it hard to get 5 stacks on a fight (except for earl, now I can see it’s value)
---
Other questions have been answered already
---
Here the thing though...all of you who have worked so hard to get the perfect weapons, the perfect armor, the perfect build...now what?
---
I mean you are as good, as strong, as perfect as you are going to get.  Now, what do you plan to do with all that gear/power?  Events you have already done a million times?  Grind for loot, exp, ammo, etc. that you simply no longer need?
---
For a game like this to survive, the players need to be constantly growing, striving...grinding I suppose.  And of course there has be a steady stream of new content, higher level/bigger mobs, more terrible bosses, more complex dungeons, etc. for players to match themselves against.
---
I mean if not, you eventually perfect your character and...sit on your porch in a rocking chair?
---
Yeah, I have this problem. I used to keep my stash around 200. But then the wastelanders update came so I couldnt play for a few weeks. And here I am, full stash and carry weight again. I somewhat blame my build though, im going for a tanky build, so yeah. Hope we can all fix the weight problems...
---
Mines still broken - all friends now appear offline and can’t team-up :(
---
Thats not exactly right bud.
---
I like this version of Todd.
---
(XB1) Same, lost about 8 3\* armor pieces trying to transfer between characters.  First time I've lost stuff, even though I get unable to connect messages sometimes when switching characters and trying to reconnect.  Most of the time I try again and it reconnects without losing stuff.  This has definitely been happening a lot more recently.
---
If your calling the Scout stuff a massive grind you gunna learn today. Lol
---
They are. That's where your down votes are coming from. Hundreds if not thousands of dupers were unbanned with their full duped stashes. I know a few with four fully loaded mules. Everyone asks then where are all of them, why aren't they all over the place in vendors? That question was already answered. Caps are useless to end gamers. If I some how run low on caps I can ask another player I play nightly and sell them 20,000+ caps worth of flux but I don't. No point in having max caps. I have no need to buy anything. I float around 10,000. Buy gold then work back up to 10,000 by the next weekend. That's why they won't remove the cap limit. Some people could make some crazy cap. Most the dupers are waiting for everyone to forget or enough new players that don't know how bad ALL weapons and rare plans were duped. Then roll them back out to sell online. That's why you are not seeing them sold or traded in game. Bring on the down votes ya duping bitches. ( they hate it when you talk about it. )
---
No Pacifist stops you tagging for pvp. If you are not carrying a "tag back" mutation. Then the only way you opened yourself for pvp was by attacking the player. Either tagging or trying to claim the bounty. Without those mutations the player had no way of bringing you into pvp to attack your camp. As he did you must of attacked back or hold one of the tag mutations.
---
My Xbox One S handled it just fine, so it better.
---
Oh, so you didn’t delete your own post?  And now your own comment?
---
Sure thing.
---
my issue is that i’ll have to craft more ammo. which i know isn’t very difficult but it adds more unnecessary game time.
---
Untrue the team tagging was removed a short while ago. Only within the confines of a workshop can a team be tagged but it requires certain parameters to be checked.
---
Do the Colossus event. Don't leave at the end just kill and loot the wendigos. I walk out with 100-200 screws each event.
---
That’s just a legacy explosive flamer.
---
The explosive effect used to drop on energy weapons, and it’d turn their projectiles into explosive bullets like you saw.
---
at least Julie keep us entertained during 10 minutes long events of nothing
---
One Thing they also could look at. Make mobs immune to certain types og damage, or give Them bloodied build also. Then you also Will have fun killing those mobs.
---
E.g. You encounter a mob that are immune to energy damage you need to pill out ur billet firing Gun to down that enemy. Because it is immune to ur plasma/laser pew pew
---
If your getting less than 500 lead ore from lucky mine your missing alot
---
Oh ok that makes sense.
---
That is good news. It always made me hesitant to accept rando invites before public teams were a thing.
---
Makes sense. Going to grind out a few levels and revamp her perk sets. See if I can increase her stats a bit. Thanks for the info. 👍
---
You could make that in a weekend with the right crew. Ever heard of "The Tree"? ;)
---
I feel this post in my soul.
---
I've been told that setting up a scarecrow attracts the enemy first, but I'm in full agreement with you. There are more times than not that I return to my base to see my turrets being taken out by a molerat or ghoul and none of them firing.
---
Typically the way it works is that they raise the level caps and the first new items are better than the rarest/most expensive of the old ones right off the bat.  Of course the challenges are so great that you need those weapons.  And when you reach the new level cap with plain/vanilla weapons, well, you farm up some new resource that will replace the old gold/ultracite and you do it all again.  And typically again.  If it's all successful, it can literally run for decades.
---
For both teams?
---
Hahaha, no.
---
Even if you include a please, you're still demanding people move their entire camp for some shitty once in a while event.. not happening.
---
It means, "You are so right."
---
After he slapped me I stabbed back .. I was shocked &amp; it was kind of a reflex lol ... but in no way did I invite him to PvP .. I just tried (miserably) to defend myself .. after which, I'm dead &amp; he's trashing my camp .. my point is, I'm a low lvl &amp; he was way higher than me .. how does the sad little man get off on that!?
---
It's very variable, isn't it?   I had three this morning that ended practically that fast too.   Makes a big difference if you have people there who know the event or not.  I hope it's that and not just AFK'ers.
---
Kill things
---
Basically if you and your teammate are within a workshop zone and an attacker starts the claim. The owner is tagged for pvp. However the if the owner is killed or leaves the zone and the bar stays frozen. Your teammate is blocking the claim from going through. To the attacker the teammate will still be white however the attacker can start pvp with the teammate and turn them red without needing a tag back to remove them from blocking the claim.
---
Yes; scrap them.
---
Quite sad that this guy is getting off on trashing low lvl players &amp; their camps
---
I usually put away the valuable stuff like lead and flux first but during the cycle of loot-craft-stash-sell repeat there's only so much that can fit, and unless I'm going to play 20 minutes in a sitting or only play the 'shoot things' way then junk just piles on, this is only the second time I've lost large quantities of junk, the first being some rando who just happened to fly by when the lightning struck and that's cool, he can make use of it instead~ not even mad 
---
This was a different can of worms though, I was confident I retrieved my loot, I saw it in my inventory but somewhere between the death and 4-5 minutes until I disconnected the game just forgot I was there, xp was the same bc I leveled up during the feral slaps and I could confirm bc when I got back into the server the second scorchbeast I killed was definitely still dead, it remembered my bullets but didn't remember me~ 
---
Again, it doesn't matter, the immediate response from everyone was "well, don't do that" which yeah, I guess is warranted but how else should I play? Just shoot things and not pick up stuff until I really need them? I might be trying to do too much, IDK~
---
Leave the LMG at 7.62. Introduce a SAW at 5.56 or .277 Fury.
---
There you go "I stabbed back" that was you inviting pvp. 
---
No griefing you accepted pvp at your camp. Turn on Pacifist and DONT attack anyone at your camp.
---
I nuke so that it hits the mine and the train station
---
Which isn’t what I am asking for.
---
OP attacked the guy back so it was pvp not griefing haha
---
I prefer Christmas because you get overwhelmed with legendary gear.
---
thanks ill def try and report back
---
That dream was doomed from the start. The neons only come in blue.
---
Easiest way to tell would be carry weight. If her strength increases, then her carry weight should increase. Check that before and after equipping class freak and see what happens. The effects tab has had visual glitches for a while and is not to be trusted.
---
You have 5 minutes to join Colossal Problem from the moment the nuke drops. After that it's not possible to join it anymore. So you either need to do SBQ and melt her with magic under 5 minutes, or do Colossal Problem first and hope SBQ will be still alive, because you can join Scorched Earth as long as SBQ is alive, so 30 minutes from the nuke drop,
---
Unfortunately, by attacking him in turn you invited him to PVP, by the game's rules.  Anyone can attack you but they do greatly reduced damage.  Unless you return fire, either directly or by a "tag back" effect of some kind, they will continue to do minimal damage.
---
Pacifist mode doesn't make you immune to PVP, it basically makes other players immune to you.  The point of that being, you can't accidentally start PVP by shooting someone by mistake and you can't accidentally fight back when you didn't mean/want to.
---
The correct response in this case would have been to ignore his attacks and calmly quit the server and then block the player so that they couldn't follow you to your next server.
---
At least that's my understanding of it.
---
They look purple to me. My poor, color-blind dream.
---
The risk is just playing the game if we have no clue on what is causing it. Your tip is as useful as throwing explosive bait at the Queen.
---
I'm fucking sick of it. Shame on you Bethesda.
---
It happened to a friend a couple of weeks ago. Not sure what caused it. Hasn't happened since and no one else in our usual group has had it happen.
---
But I just tried to defend myself .. he attacked me .. my point still stands .. how does a high lvl player get off on attacking low lvl players .. that's sad af!
---
I'll take "things that didn't happen" for $400 Alex
---
There are some in purple the are framed and a little smaller. They were an atom shop item sometime last year.
---
Throw them.
---
Comments about the primal cuts issue keep getting downvoted by Bethesda devotees and if this doesn't get to the top of this forum they(Bethesda) will ignore this problem so I'm upvoting to this 20th post about this subject. Since I can't tell others to upvote I'm just going ask you to follow your ❤ emoji. Not your angry face that I keep seeing at these events.
---
I have too - was only added when they did the map overhaul. Hasn’t been here forever.
---
Lol
---
For the herd! ✊
---
Scrap them by and large.  Most plans are scopes.
---
There's absolutely no precedent for this.  I've stayed on during the roll over the majority of the time and never been hit with it.  I've also stayed off and haven't been hit with it.
---
Wrong. By attacking him back you started pvp at your own camp. If you had risen above it and ignored them nothing would of happened. Camp would be fine you would of been fine you can only be hurt and therefore need to defend yourself in pvp. Either by tagging or a workshop. By giving in and attacking back you opened yourself to be attacked. However due to you not having a tag mutation and willingly attacking back it was fair pvp not griefing. 
---
The other players goal is shady yes but by just ignoring players like this instead of squaring up keeps them from doing this. Put on Pacifist and don't attack people at your camp.
---
You know you won’t get the achievement if you join someone else right?
---
Thanks for explaining that m8 .. I had no idea .. pacifist mode is on now .. in future I'll do what you suggested &amp; quit the server 👍
---
Craft and scrap is always the best way to accumulate mods.
---
I play a Raider character and I wanted to look the part. I try to collect all the Raider gear I can find.
---
The answer is 42.
---
OP attacked player back so it was pvp not griefing. They omitted the tag back originally.
---
Bright light mod works really good for me. Maybe it’s your tv.
---
They act like a grenade as a throwable.
---
It's not great for me either, my DCG went from 2456 damage to &lt;500. But something needed fixing.
---
There's a reason it's on the testing server though, they might revert it in the end.
---
Oh, my mistake, sorry for misunderstanding.
---
1. Get fallout 1st. No more junk problems.
---
2. Get rid of any non-legendary weapons and scrip any lower level or useless to your build legendaries.
---
3. Get the high capacity backpack and the ammo, stims, and weapon perk cards for reducing weight.
---
4. Don’t carry more than 100 of anything. Stimpacks, water, radaway.
---
5. Enjoy playing the game because you no longer have a weight problem. (Bonus tip. Use all your gunpowder and only craft more when you need it. Very heavy stuff)
---
Apparently not.
---
this pussies only coming for low level players 😂 such a losers
---
K .. I had no idea that's how it worked .. pacifist is now on &amp; in future I'll just quit the server .. Ty 👍
---
Yeah, just keep scraping combat rifles and handmades you find. You’ll eventually get the mods you’re looking for. I found that combat rifles were easier to find in the wastes then handmades when I was below level 50. So I crafted a few low level handmades when I had enough screws, and scrapped them to learn the mods.
---
I heard that was possible that's not the case?
---
So basically(based on rarity) you ripped him off. Nice.
---
Agreed .. so sad!
---
This can't be right. The countdown will start when the first person goes in. If noone does the event will stay until someone joins surely
---
Yeah, I don't get why people say bloodied or unyielding is so op.  It's not fun to die every other second.
---
What are her base STR and INT numbers?  IIRC, the (-) X indicates the number shown is lower than the number of perk points in that category.
---
EG, if her STR perk is 15, but a mutation lowers it by 2, then the pipboy will read   “(-) 13”.  
---
Class freak would offset one of those points, so STR would read (-) 14.
---
Oh it is?? I remember reading about this before somewhere but it must have been a while ago. Was it a rule that was always applied?
---
AA is roughly +28.8% damage, granted your target is armored. In this case I would say the Mutants with +40% swing speed is more desirable.
---
Hundreds?
---
100% necessary. Big gunners need 10k+ ammo at least at all times. I'm carrying 50k atm lol.
---
Im assuming you are on PC because consoles have no mods and must rely on the game itself.  It isn’t my TV
---
I agree. I’m close to finishing legendary run. By next week I’ll have enough notes stacked so all I have to do is login once a day to get bullion for a week or two. I’m trying so hard to vacation from this game, that’s good right? *super mutant voice* So BOring
---
Level 85 is max rank xD theoretically no difference between an 85 and a level 1000.
---
this is not the first MEAT Week
---
As far as I know you won’t get progress on quests that have Instanced interiors when you are not the team leader so I’m pretty sure you can’t get the achievement for finishing the vault with the opposite side on a character I’m guessing you allready finished with the Settlers
---
Also pretty sure getting the achievement requires you to actually finish the quest of doing the vault which has different names depending on which side you did the vault for
---
WAIT.  Don't buy what people are telling you to.  Wait until you have your build sorted out past level 50, then come back and figure out what you want.
---
I've never been on for daily reset.
---
I've lost 2 sets of weeklies, 14 sets of dailies, and 2 sets of Double Score dailies.
---
I've never done anything that people have been saying could be the cause of it.
---
I turn my 20 in every dat
---
To be honest I never saw Colossal Problem where nobody joined for so long, for me everyone joins asap.
---
It's not a bad idea. 
---
As long as it took you across the map in real time for less than it costs to fast travel, and you couldn't skip it (to avoid FT costs).
---
You describe a bug while avoiding to answer .)
---
Was team tagging removed from both, private and public teams?
---
 [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR\_El8/edit#gid=2043760311](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=2043760311)
---
Have fun grinding for nothing of substance for as long as you want.  Woo hoo.
---
more time in a game? better weapons? can switch between builds? At level 80 I had way way way worse legendaries than now
---
Both as per patch notes. My response just stated teammate as in "a teammate" Public or private. Both are teammates.
---
Yep finished with the settlers and trying to get the Raiders vault quest done. That sucks that you have to have an entirely different character for the achievo if that's the case
---
No, there isn't.  It's Bethesda.  What do you expect?  Content or something?
---
Yeah as far as I know that is the case
---
This i full agree. My mule account base happens to b near the event. So i just let my mule share a perk card n that account just keep get meat, scrips n treasury notes
---
The bright light is one of the light options you can find in the wasteland. It isnt a "mod" that you download.
---
Thanks for letting me know. Guess that'll be the only one I don't get lol
---
What and where can I farm the drops from these? I think scorched for combat rifle. Maybe mutants for handmade?
---
But using the level as a guide/excuse doesn't work unless one of the players involved is sub 50. I can go on my main and transfer all gear to a level 50. Now to people I'm low level but EXACTLY the same as my high level. Same perks, same gear. You can only play one character at a time so level after 50 means nothing.
---
All of it?  No choices, no "moral" dilemmas.  No meaning... no point.
---
Handmades are hard to come by.  Farm screws and craft them (get plans in harpers ferry as I recall).  Combat rifles are pretty common from mire and bog scorched.
---
Yeet them at the scorch queen to do 21-25 damage
---
It’s messed up
---
Probably because they think Serums are listed under Aid... Because that's how they appear on the vending machine when you are loading them into the vending machine.
---
They probably assume the OP is wrong without checking for themselves first.  Personally I didn't know that this happened but I'd believe it from the same company the thought the Ammo Converter was a good implementation in either version.  The converter is not worth the time and effort it takes to use it.
---
Just curious, why can they give us limitless scrap space but not limitless stash space. I mean from a technical level. Like if they could, they would be selling it already so what keeps them from selling more stash space when they were able to implement the scrap box.
---
I used to love this game but I stopped playing only because of this reason. I didn't care about any bugs, glitches, crashes or anything like that. The one thing that I couldn't stand was the overencumbered system, I spent more time managing my storage than actually playing the game, and even in the storage container in your house you have a limit for what you can put and it is a very low limit. Whenever I play fallout 4 the first mod that I install is the one that adds 10000 weight. 
---
The overencumbered system ruined this game for me.
---
First or second week of September if I remember correctly.
---
Edit: Sept 10-14th. Just checked the events page.
---
Baby bro...gimme some?
---
Nope. I’m talking about the headlamp mod slot.
---
this option doesn't exist for me on PC
---
I would rather earn them through time gated daily and weekly. .
---
Nah fuck it, what the first guy said......
---
If (when) we meet the Fortifying Atlas event for donating leather in a couple weeks we will get a 50% sale.
---
Too true. The tents or camps aren't causing the spawns to race away from the barrel as fast as they can, which I keep running into. I chased a rad toad so far my raider daily quest popped up, and I've chased things down that ran out of the event zone several times before and after that one. No tents or camps near by. I don't mind the chasing if I can at least finish the event successfully, but for it to also fail is just poor game design.
---
When the mine is dead center, my camp is close enough to be used as a fast travel point and there are a few irradiated plants outside the zone.  Also have an open workshop for scrapping and repairs
---
I dump those nasty 1 and 1.5 pound stimpaks at the overseers camp every chance I get or I straight toss them onto the ground. (Garbage)
---
The Brahmin grill was the first thing I got. I've only done 3 so far and now have a second plan for it! RNG etc. etc.
---
It does for me, I think I can coach you:
---
M for map.
---
Move to any objective on your map.
---
Click on the option to “show in Pipboy”.
---
It has a similar colour scheme to the Communist PA (dark green with some red bands on it), but it doesn't really stick out or anything.
---
i do play a lot. and everyday i transfer some stuff. might be a little bit of ammo or aid or legendaries. maybe 50-100 stash weight. but that once a week is when i move stuff i've had in my vendor and every single thing i don't need. 
---
They need to give us a small bank for transfering items. Even a 100 weight would be nice. And also let us buy character slots. I'd gladly pay 800 atoms for another slot. I think many people would.
---
Swing speed will be better for dps and if you’ve  been maxing  ur melee ( mutations, perks, right armor legendaries ) the damage will still be high but now u can swing faster. U won’t wanna go back to non swing speed melees lol
---
Well aren't you lucky. Want a cookie? Seriously though, that is great. I keep getting meat week flags, something I got last year.
---
The only useful legendary i got so far is a Furious C bow. Witch is not too bad. I run a rifle/ bow and gun build.
---
It's true.  I've tried to find a reason to log into the game... and I can't.  There's just nothing to do.
---
I don't even bother with turrets anymore because of this shit right here. It's quicker to deal with it myself and removing them freed up sooooo much budget.
---
Definitely needs to be reworked though I agree. What the hell is the point in having turrets stay at lower levels, and why the fuck do they seem to develop cataracts and go blind??
---
This has never ever happend to me in the almost 2000 hrs I’ve played this game. I’ll take that cookie
---
Building camps on the spawn point is what breaks the events -.-
---
Ash Heap and Cranberry Bog failures because spawns glitched underground. Therefore unable to hit anything! :(
---
The rule you are looking for is Rule #34.
---
Most of the time that’s not a case, you can’t deny the fact that mostly level 300+ players have better weapons, armor, skill than someone below level 100
---
The tender plan is elusive as fuck for me. I have all the others.
---
Lol, my excavator with the mods for carry weight + some perks give about 550+ carry weight, but I kid you not you deal close to 0 damage, I had to spend 300+- .50 mm ammo in order to kill a single level 50 deathclaw, not even a crowned or legendary one...
---
I just like how this game will make you suffer anyway, either you get a nice build and destroy everything with a few bullet, or you can actually get a lot of carry weight, but no damage, and sometimes close to no armor, definitely the experience you expect from apocalypse(no sarcasm, really).
---
You could kinda make one with a garage door, and create turrets either side. You’ve given me an idea now..
---
Sept 10 through 14th
---
StoryLINE yes because one fetch quest lead to another with absolutely no choices, thanks Bethesda for this great rpg.
---
Rule 34?
---
Oh really it they all completed when I was there 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Yes! And wreak havoc on Whitespring!
---
Hell yes thanks Sleepz
---
no matter what level is, Camp griefers are the worst
---
Youre soo coool brewster! Wait is this the wrong reference
---
The time limit needs to increase exponentially because sometimes the spawns in this site are separated and a long distance away from each other. Many failures here because there wasn't enough time to reach each spawns.
---
LOL Way to really get into the spirit of the event!
---
we earned it already
---
Awesome! Thanks for the number run down, super helpful
---
...from your mouth to Todd's ear....
---
Meh, either I show up and it fails right away or it finishes right away.
---
Thanks, this will be helpful
---
Personally, I would be okay with explosive not doing much damage to the SBQ, BUT it should cripple her wings.  She doesn't land enough and when she does she often flies away far too quickly.
---
The explosives and shots to her wing should make her land.  When she regenerates, she should fly again, and be brought back down again.
---
Bethesda has nerfed an entire play style since day 1 by making her spend so much time in the sky.
---
Nah like I said that sounds awesome. Good RNG for players and hearing about it makes looking through reddit a good experience for me. Gives hope. Also, what kind of cookie?
---
Worthwhile contribution, we all appreciate your insight.
---
It wasn't that I omitted the tag back .. I wasn't aware that was a thing .. I did tell you that! Smh
---
google for "fallout 76 rule 34"
---
This ain’t oblivion bro
---
Haha ya jerk
---
Cool.
---
Thanks.  But what I said is true.  There's no reason to assume staying on will make you have the bug.
---
Don't worry, I'm sure Auntie Beth has a cash-shop solution on the way for the whales...
---
We did not. We earned the bonus challenge and bonus score. Purveyor and Second helping of meat week are gonna be rewards for the Fortifying Atlas Bravo event.
---
M8 .. if you're justifying a high lvl player attacking low lvl players then you're just as bad as him!
---
I think because there are a relatively small number of different items that go in the scrap box. You can't put normal junk in there, only the broken down materials, so like, what? Maybe 40 different things? And the amount of each thing is just a simple number to keep track of. 50,000 steel strains the system no more than 1 steel, I would think. 
---
This isn't the case with the stash box.
---
The cultists at Lucky Hole Mine seem to drop a few handmades every time I go through.
---
Where is the grief? OP admitted "eventually" that they attacked the player back. Opening pvp at there camp. 
---
Again I've mentioned players like the guy OP encountered are shady but by simply just ignoring them nothing happens to you or your camp. 
---
It's another post that started as "I'm innocent" but when publicly questioned because they decided to complain publicly the truth that it wasn't quite what they said comes out and both parties are to blame.
---
Yep. And it doesn’t even start till the 3rd lol. It’s in the bag
---
Guess it's a good thing I acknowledge that in the post.
---
You are right.  Wait what is the bonus challenge weekend? More score challensgs?
---
I am partially colorblind as well. Apex Legends has a colorblind mode and it has really spoiled me, so I'm right here with you.
---
You can spell the word time only 50% of the tine! Lol.
---
I did? He had like 3 of them!
---
Then do a quick google search or some research somehow about pvp. How did you think pvp starts. Surely two people attacking each other should of been your first thought to start pvp smh
---
Magic damage needs fire rate of 200 or close to it. I've never used a plasma caster, but I'm guessing it doesn't have the required fire rate.
---
It's honestly the reason I stopped playing. I love the world and gameplay but everytime I get on I remember "oh yeah, I can't do shit or move"
---
Drop rate is around 10% I believe for everything. Have multiples of the outfits and grill etc. No tenderiser yet tho
---
This, I personally scrap them as well
---
I’ve gotten the Chally outfit, both chef hats, the bloodied chef, the flag, the backpack, the meat clever, the Tenderizer, and the Salty mid god it so far. Multiples of backpack and meatclever plan. 
---
So I guess I’m doing good.
---
As a side note: listen to science, guys.  There are people way smarter and way more knowledgeable then you that didn't waste decades of their life to be told they're wrong by a mom that "did her research."
---
That's the point I was trying to make m8 .. I'm new to the game &amp; the guy that attached me was clearly a high lvl well equipped player, whereas I have low lvl skills, weapons, armour. knowledge ect... Just think it's kinda sad &amp; unbalanced
---
I got the whole bundle and I really like the bunker, but I'll explain the issues you mentioned.
---
Firstly, the floating. It seems that the actual mesh of the bunker's floor seems to be a bit higher than the texture. Thus, anything that comes into contact with the floor appears to be floating slightly. I've more or less remedied this by just placing rugs down over the floor (looks kinda nice anyway, as an alternative to bare concrete).
---
Secondly, the door sound. I haven't noticed any real issues with this, and it seems like it would be a pretty minor detail unless you're opening and closing the door a lot.
---
Lastly, the gun ports. Basically, while they appear on the outside, the inside is just one continuous smooth surface. I don't actually mind this. In a way it makes sense, if you assume that they were instead for automated turrets that were built into the wall or something.
---
Another couple of things is that they're quite shallow (if you build them on a hill, they'll be floating out quite noticeably) and they have a vent in the roof with a fan (just a detail you might not like, I would've preferred that it was sealed off).
---
Overall, I quite like both the fences and the bunker and I've used them both quite a lot in my CAMP.
---
I'm on xbox and have been following a few PTS players listening in, from what I see all builds are still viable some obviously more stronger. Also its a PTS so nothing is set in stone, if I was you I'd keep your build but try not to swap to much around until the official update. I had the same concerns but I'm not doing anything until the update is released, if anything just collect different weapon and armor types, some may get a buff some may not, but atleast you'll have the gear to build towards, if that makes sense.
---
But I’m already a 1st member.
---
Because, despite the unlimited headaches, I severely Stan Bethesda. ):
---
I am not sure. I would say more challenges each day but I don't think it has been stated anywhere. Someone correct me if I am wrong.
---
Also, yes, I am poor.
---
feelsbadman
---
That's Primal Cuts, not the Meat-Cook.
---
That’s why he needs rule 34....
---
Incisor makes AA useless if you are running it.
---
Honestly its why I broke down and pay for first every few months. My stash was full of junk, paid it yesterday, went from 785 to 130!!!! I was so annoyed.
---
Ehh.. I feel hurt irl now
---
Truth, beckets fetch and kill seemed more appropriate where the commanders seemed to obviously gameplay mechanic locked. Also I really didn't like the whole guy who had been hiding near by for god knows how long
---
Hadn’t even considered a bloodied build for PA. I always considered them to be mutually exclusive since so many non-PA bloodied builds involve perk cards that are non-PA exclusive. Thanks!
---
Alright, thanks!
---
Throw them at people and have a big cleaver fight.
---
I do have 1st.
---
Still overencumbered with a full stash.
---
feelsbadman.
---
The point I was making has clearly flown miles above your head .. I give up! Bye now! 👍
---
Stop hoarding, begin cleaning.
---
Again to those confused about this. Any player SUB 50 is a low level as they cannot have max specials. Anyone OVER 50 are the same level. Same Specials, Same Max Cap on Weapons and Gear and if built correctly Exactly the same Perk Cards. 
---
Regardless of current level. 
---
For example. I could take ALL my gear from a high level character and move them onto a level 50 that I've given exactly the same specials and perks. 
---
Now would the excuse of you being a low level at 85 still stand. If the same situation played out with a level 50. 35 Below?
---
Level 85 is 35 above max giving 35 respec points. 
---
The correct term should be "High Geared Players vs Low Geared Players" Level after 50 means nothing due to Alts, knowledge, transfers and gear.
---
I know! I never do more than tap the trigger unless it’s a sbq but then my LMG is an aae ffr fr. 
---
I’d rather have to do steel/lead runs or trade for them than not use her though, she’s so fun.
---
I have everything but the salty tenderizer plan
---
Couldn’t agree more. 
---
I wanted so much to blast Rose in the face when I was done with her stupid quests.
---
I did shoot Rosalynn’s corpse when I found it. At least I got to shoot David in the face and kill him.
---
I keep getting dropped from the server
---
We get double score points from dailies.
---
UHGGG I get that, I usually unload everything I dont keep Armour or weapons of no use to me. I only seem to sell plans and ammo
---
Not good business if it turns the player base against you.
---
It's given me nothing but meat cleavers.
---
I'll probably end up buying everything like I did with Fasnacht. Because the game hates me.
---
But don’t you know I need all these legendaries that I don’t know what to do with?
---
I just throw them around, they make oddly satisfying sound.
---
I don’t mind people on the spit or drums but for everyone to stay on it and one person only do the running! That’s what I don’t like and server hop.
---
repair didn't fix it, but after I finally emptied the mag, it went back to 20 again.
---
So many ppl losing beloved pets lately... Sorry for your loss Buddy.
---
Glad you got something cool to help ease the pain. 
---
Blessed be.
---
Not the double SCORE weekend going on now.  Im talking about next week Wednesday.  The last reward for Atlas.  Bonud challenges.
---
The way she kept taunting you as she sent you on those dumb quests. 
---
Like bitch, do you know who you’re talking to? You’re a stupid nanny bot with a terrible personality. You think you take me? Go ahead on.
---
It's not a bug, it's premium content. Pay us monthly and we'll give you more.
---
It’s a week long. That’s why it’s meat WEEK.
---
That’s nice
---
Yeah thats really weird I’m not too sure what happened there! That’s fair enough, I have the survival tent and scrap box and don’t know what I’d do without it
---
I think they are just adding more than the usual daily and weekly score challenges, I don't think they have stated how many extra yet though.
---
Just be glad its only in the game, that paper cutter, ouch!
---
Hey, all. What's a perk coin? Level 114 n00b here. Thanks.
---
That's why we are here ! To help😀
---
What’s nicer is just doing a search for an answer.
---
In your Post and when it was mentioned several times to "Not attack anyone at your camp" and even stated by yourself "I didn't attack him". 
---
Then later on you changed it to "I stabbed back" 
---
So it seems it was omitted. At anytime you could of stated you attacked them by stabbing them. If you honestly don't think stabbing someone is considered attacking someone then hope is lost smh
---
ok.  that makes sense now
---
You didn’t need to reply but here you are like a loser
---
Bridges Of all sizes would be rad. Been thinking about this too lately. I want a little walking bridge for me camp. Sign me up.
---
Legendary needs that to and of course if we can have the level of the player add to his green vending marker...  
---
But guess what? Who cares when we have so much better list elements like stimpacks, explosives or drinks... Clever...
---
I'm just liking the treasury notes that are being given out with it, getting me a nice stockpile built up.
---
100% a meat cookie... Otherwise known as a burger :D
---
Instigating given that choice.. Furious if I could cherry pick
---
2S accuracy is ass.. leaves much to be desired
---
Yeah, I'm thinking maybe I'll just continue holding on to the like 15 level points I'm sitting on. At least that way, if my bow becomes useless, I can drop plenty of cards into one of the other decent weapons I have. 
---
I know bloodied is still going to be meta, but honestly I don't ever want to go back to that just to do some damage. I personally found it very boring.
---
It would appear that the minigun's only job in this game is one thing and one thing only
---

EDIT: Instead of selling your kidneys, use someone/thing else's organs? (SBQ or Gulpers)
---
If all the spits and drum full then the event is almost complete. If you go on the drums too while it’s counting down then you’ll only have to put a few critters in.
---
FAILOUT
---
"Hey you, you're finally awake."
---
Sure, stand still and close your eyes. 
---
It'll only sting for a moment
---
It failed almost immediately for me last night after wasting all the prime cuts on the fire.  The prime cuts event to not work well anymore.  They have really screwed this whole event up.
---
Nice! Trying for a Responder theme and didn't want obvious commie stuff. It should work!!
---
Instigating hands down. Two Shot absolutely kills your accuracy
---
They are listening to playerbase. They recently increased the amount of coins you get from each card (or rank) by one. It's 2 coins/perk now. And yesterday they lowered the amount of coins you need to upgrade legendary perks:
---
* Rank 2 reduced from 100 to 50 Perk Coins
---
* Rank 3 reduced from 150 to 100 Perk Coins
---
* Rank 4 reduced from 250 to 150 Perk Coins
---
People need to remember that PTS is PTS. Anything can change. It's a testing realm.
---
&gt;I don't have any alts/mule characters, nor am I subscribed to Fo1st. I think I'm typical of a lot of players
---
&gt;And it seems another instance where the game developers managed to overlook how people really play the game.
---
I do have alts, I have an Unarmed Build that switches to Power Armor/Heavy.  I have a high Charisma Character who runs shotguns.  I have a stealthy full health sniper.  I have a stealthy, bloodied, commando. I have a High Luck/High Agi Pistols.  
---
Maybe among all the players, there’s a lot more leveled alts than you expect.  All of my characters have extra perk packs and extra cards they can scrap.
---
And no, I’m not some basement dweller living with my parents, this is what I’ve built up with a few hours of play ever day (with a few marathons during vacations or weekends).  
---
You can’t take how you play and assume it’s the typical. You can’t even take the reddit user base as anything since that’s very different than the total player base (some of which avoid reddit since they find the people here frankly too toxic).  On the recent Quakecon stream they even asked the question on more character slots, and people don’t want them just for alts, some amount of players (could be few, could be many) enjoy playing different builds with different characters.
---
I meant I didn't attack him first, we clearly had crossed wires
---
I’ve been blowing it even tho after spending it I regret it when I get pipe pistols or berserkers. Never will get my lucky 3 rolls in a row from her again.
---
Instigating!!
---
You would think just importing the same event as before would work correctly since there is nothing different about it. The only thing I can think of that broke it was the addition of treasury notes.
---
Lol! Whatever. You’re lazy and think people should give you answers. And here you sit getting all bent over this. Lol. I think it’s you that’s the loser.
---
It depends if you have multiple mobs next to each other, or there are more people tagging enemies. Againts bosses, if you cant oneshot them, use TS. Agains SBQ, none, because explosive
---
I’d personally consider it one of the best overall builds in the game- you aren’t reliant on anything, you are just fucking terminator. Stealth? Who cares. VATS? Please. Melee range? Hah!
---
And the PTS changes are actually fantastic for it. Power armor reboot? 40% chance for a health restore if you would have been dropped below 1hp.
---
50 poison resist for rank 1
---
50 fire resist for rank 1 (generally “eh”, but Earl fight has some nasty fire damage).
---
And the current Daily Ops mutations are pretty “whatever”. Chameleon? So what, you already just ADS and annihilation everything. Freezing touch? Haha, let’s see who dies first shall we? Resilient? Eh, so I have to gun bash you to finish you off, make me work a little. 
---
Earl? Tank him with a 1000rd vampire Gatling laser; clear adds with a bloodied auto grenade (bonus points if you’re a bloodied hw/EXPLOSIVE build with Fireproof)
---
see.. this is why I was saying.. other than the currency rewards.. perk packs are the best reward in legendary run
---
also people need to keep in mind.. Legendary perks arent a regular thing.. they are supposed to be expensive.. they are supposed to be rare perks for attaining high levels..
---
its not something youre supposed to get in totality easily right off the bat as it seems many people are treating them
---
Yea i get what you’re saying but it’s never full, haven’t done a single one where it’s all full, usually 2 on drums one on spit or the opposite, i hope i get to experience that to see how it works!
---
Definitely, would love to have a black/red UI to match the Blackbird paint
---
I have gotten all outfits back pack twice and grill. I am in search of the tenderizer and I will be satisfied. Anyone on Xbox I’ll trade back pack for tenderizer
---
It pays to try to have your back to  the nearest wall. A fight with mechanics and hazards is definitely a move in the right direction for this game.
---
big fucking no from me
---
If you are on PC, you can find a mod called Perk Loadout Manager. Works a charm with the quick switch!
---
when i started and planned my build, i thought about doing it also like this. but as time goes, i accepted to be be a glass canon and swap only for crafting. tbh, im really looking forward to the legendary perks to get rid of all these "crap cards" i picked once or got from a card pack. will be great to have a much shorter way to super duper.
---
I like to think that insult bot is classier than Your Mom jokes
---
Sadly no I’m on PS4 😢
---
Hoarder.   Time to purge.
---
Sometimes the serve is laggy and the legendary rewards pop out late. 
---
For example (and this has happened plenty of times to me) let’s say I killed a 3 star ghoul. And instead of the weapon appearing on my screen, it decides not to. Or I went in my pip boy. It cancels out your availability to see your reward. But obviously you’ll have the weapon and you can see it in your inventory. 
---
Then when I go and do the cookout, the second I receive the legendary reward, instead of showing me that one, it will show me the previous one that didn’t load. 
---
So maybe that person lied since the cookout ONLY rewards you 1 star. 
---
Or the same thing happened to him. Where he previously got the 3 star, but it didn’t appear on his screen until he got another legendary.
---
maybe get some more fallout 1st subs then, or are you poor? ;)
---
do you still hear in-game sounds? i would love to play Grognak while waiting for a nuke announcement
---
feels bad man
---
F
---
Better get a free rehab if you get to the 7600h, it's years of work...
---
I have the grill. I just want that tenderizer!
---
I knew better too! I was going to log but then I got caught up in 20 minutes of PvP and lost track of time. So yeah. F.
---
I've considered the purchase but it always feels like I would be feeding paranoia, kinda like buying condoms, if my source material is safe and reliable then I'd rather spend it on food~
---
I am fine with the nerf, however..I want the combat bugs to be gone for good as well, especially gauss weapon specific bugs. More types of weapons being viable would be amazing too. Oh, and for the love of Todd... don't make shotguns shit after fixing "Magic" attributes.
---
Craaaap. Like others have said.... Loadouts are Coming! Hang in there!
---
double F weekend
---
Were you at a workshop or your actual CAMP?
---
Also, if ya red, ya dead. We will obliterate everything in our path. 😇
---
Oh crap I never thought of that.
---
That’s less money I can spend on mothman atomic items though.
---
So you think it’s worth keeping the TS anyway? Would it sell for much?
---
That doesn't matter. Okay some info here for you. 
---
If two players "tag" each other either with a weapon, melee or even unarmed. They enter pvp. 
---
If only one tags, the invite to pvp gets sent to the player that was attacked. 
---
If the player who was attacked walks away. Nothing happens. 
---
If the player that was attacked attacks back. Pvp starts. 
---
Until pvp starts neither player can damage each other legitimately. 
---
Now with wanted players. The player who is Wanted is tagged for pvp automatically from anyone else. 
---
If another player decides to try to claim the bounty by attacking the wanted player. The wanted player has every right to defend themselves. Now both players are in pvp. 
---
So in your scenario you met both requirements for pvp the moment you attacked back. Both that he hit you first and you tried to attack a wanted player. 
---
Doing so out you into agreed pvp. Therefore although the player had motives to take down your camp. Because he didn't use any bugs or glitches to force your pvp. It was fair game. 
---
I've just been trying to state that if you don't completely understand the pvp don't go around attacking people. 
---
As for the omitting part. You constantly stated you didn't attack him. But changed it to that you stabbed him. I won't lie I'm confused how you thought "stabbing" someone wasn't seen as attacking them haha
---
God speed. I actually have plans for two of the mods, just not for the weapon itself.
---
At least I’m a hoarder in-game and not IRL. ;)
---
“People would play this game more per day without these limits.”
---
Yes and no. Even with those limits, a lot of people, myself included still play almost everyday. I agree it should be increased, not arguing there. 
---
However it doesn’t matter what they increase it to, there’s a lot of people that will still empty out the script in one day, and will come to reddit to complain that it’s not enough. 
---
The only way to keep people happy is to make it limitless on how many caps/script/gold you can get or spend per day. Obviously Bethesda doesn’t want that because they want us to grind, spend time playing the game, etc.
---
I wonder if anyone ever reads the description of events on official website before posting something like this.. It was said before that this event is going to be instanced, so that means 8 players can join per instance, if you're 9th and further you'll be put in another one. Unfortunately you were too late or not fast enough to join the first instance and nobody joined yours. It's not a bug, it's not a broken event it's the way they designed it. Not saying it's designed well tho, still think this instanced thing isn't necessary but that's the way it it is.
---
Yeah I’ve noticed that! Okay great, instigating seems to be the one! Thanks everyone.
---
Im hoping to get it too so I can drop the tenderizers I have in my stash from previous MEAT Weeks.. lol
---
It's made of bits of real panther.  50% of the time it works every time.
---
Play the patrol duty event at the regional penitentiary. The event starts whenever you fast travel there. It rewards you with a random weapon plan. Took me a bit of grinding but I got the handmade schematic and made/scrapped a bunch for schematics.
---
Nope, that's the Grocer Mod.
---
Unless you meant does it reduce the Carry Weight the backpack normally gives you, to which it does.  Drops it from 60 to 30.  Worth it IMO though, if you use food buffs a lot.
---
Is that really one the best weapon?
---
Yeah I got a a spicy mod plan and accident read it now we must get the plan 😅😅😅 got the outfit and 2 backpack plans
---
it works ok with the grenade launcher
---
It would be worse. Often people join worlds where their friends are. If you find your camp spot is often taken then move.
---
And just make that bad boy whenever hun
---
Its happened to me too. I shouldnt stayed in the game.
---
Up until now, I’ve never had any of my challenges auto completed. 
---
There’s been days where I log in after the challenge reset, and other times where I’ve been playing before and during the challenge reset and everything was fine. 
---
There’s no specific reason on why the auto complete happens. And no way to prevent it either. 
---
My gf always waited to log in after I told her the challenges changed and twice she had it auto complete. 
---
My friend on the other hand, played before the challenge reset, and then when the timer went down and we got the new challenges she noticed they auto completed.
---
"And I've run out of Bufftats!"
---
Definitely need an emote for "Can anyone lend me a chem to boost STR?"
---
Maybe it's pointless saying this, but have you double checked you have the plan, and if you don't, that you can't already build it?
---
Oh damn good to know!
---
I had this happen yesterday, especially if you fast travel into the event before it shows on the screen
---
If you happen to be bloodied and have on Unyielding Armor...that comes right off in PA and your carry weight drops.
---
Good luck! All I really need from the event now is the salty mod and the grill master hat!
---
Ill keep that in mind when someone makes a grenade launcher thread.. thanks
---
Bethesda [supports trap bases](https://twitter.com/fallout/status/1292124710562562049) which is something I've garnered [somewhat of a reputation for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnoZSsVyO58&amp;list=PLd9ZJI1zOOMM6fckdpUZ2UlLa9mA4F5dy) (for better or worse). They're one of the few player created interactive elements in the game and often because they're the only thing you can build that can "do something" they tend to be the most interesting (though their interest and humour varies widely by how they're used and their context).
---
I actually agree that they should initiate pvp or that being killed by a trap item should at least give the camp owner some kind of bounty. The state we're in right now is kind of the unintentional side effect of them removing slap damage and the ability to destroy camp objects at the cost of a bounty (this was a long time ago). It used to be possible to shoot your way out if you were willing to become wanted which at least gave you some recourse. Right now the game sides with the trap owner because they can kill without risk or consequence. The answer is somewhere in the middle... trap bases are still very interesting (especially when made into games/puzzles) but they are a bit one-sided a lot of the time.
---
And now I've missed out on at least 3 because of a server crash.
---
I don't think the t65 has one yet, might be the problem. Although night vision or just a big rack of lights would be pretty cool.
---
You were hit with the delightful Autocomplete Bug. Unfortunately, you are out that SCORE for today. This is common and very well know and HELLA FRUSTRATING especially during these weekends.
---
Make sure you guys put out the fire. That’s a really easy way to lose the event. Also clean up the skeleton remains on the ground. 
---
Honestly as long as there are people on the fire pit and playing the drums, That helps so the progress bar doesn’t go back too much. 
---
Ever single cookout I’ve done so far has been successful. Most of them being done within 30-40 seconds.
---
Yeah just posted bout this I got the same thing idk what happened
---
Good thing I'm not a Beth programmer
---
Sorry for you this haven't happened to me yet
---
Throw them at Archery Targets and try to get a bullseye.
---
I have explosive bait on standby now. Won’t be that much of an issue anymore and actually probably quite satisfying
---
Known bug and unfortunately can not be fixed or undone and you are out the SCORE for the day. Sorry :(
---
It started two patches ago with the objects being loose in the world. If you go to the purveyor, you'll notice the two cars and that skeleton always \*thump\* down. Gravity is what's keeping the pixels in the place here, clearly. 
---
Now every time I load in, I understand the junk crinkly noises I hear are \*me\* falling into place.
---
That's without any other armor pen though. If op is using incisor for 75% armour Pierce then it's a very sever diminishing return
---
Man, sometimes I can't even exit to main menu! I once died during an event right when it was ending and I was just watching on my corpse for several minutes through rotating camera and couldn't do anything, not respawn nor even quit.. I was ready to force shut down my game and it magically respawned me there, but it was just once, other times wasn't so lucky.
---
Any chance we can get an update on this u/ladydevann ?
---
It’s really killing me here nearly two weeks later.
---
Was the last Meat Week pre-Wastelanders DLC? That may be it too. A lot has changed in the last year.
---
Near the water by Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm
---
I've bought the 120w+ Backpack plan at 10000 caps, my purse have place now.
---
I just PD'd the mods of the community, but yeah this just happened to me, too. I can only play 3 days a week so not being able to do my dailies today ruins my chances to complete the legendary run.
---
While not a horrible idea, why are you asking Bethesda to program and manage an even more complicated system while they have yet to prove they can effectively run the current one?  If you think the bugs and glitches are bad now....
---
Fix the current bugs, THEN request new things.
---
God I might just swap out bloodied for junkie and just be an addict running around addicted to STR chems. 
---
I’m already a cannibalistic irradiated cultist grandmother in-game roleplayer.
---
If you're using the incisor perk card use the mutants with ss
---
Darn
---
If they were not allowed within the event perimeter they would not cause an issue and all would be fine. 
---
Considering you can fast travel to them for free I do not see any reason they need to be smack dab in the middle of an event, except to be an jerk.
---
Thank you!!
---
You should have received it (and the display case if you did not from Fasnacht) as a plan. You would have gotten both the first time you did the Meat Cook. Check plans and build menus. If you have already leaned both (and seems like you may have!) they will not drop again. [Rewards List.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eO6GDNSlQYbnFZcyBVSP02RtSwygKcEQFH_NQi_chos/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;pru=AAABdDE7hK4*WKNf9w8WP9xi95VqNI8FEQ)
---
All the new pa's font have headlamp mods. Ultracite/sh, excavator, and t65
---
yeah, always have this bug there, other events and deaths work fine for me at least. oh about 2 months ago it was bugged after a high lvl killed me too.
---
Much appreciated!
---
where exactly does this event start? same as all the primal cuts?
---
Way worse. I don't care if my spot is taken, I always get into the world, regardless of CAMP and Nukes. Ever since they made grinding XP a daily requirement, if I need a CAMP I just hop to a Team mate's. I rarely sell anything anyway since basically the whole 800 lbs of my stash are all devoted to junk stashing.
---
I understand why people don't even want to be asked the question, and just be loaded where their camp can spawn though. So I think Beth should put an option in the mode choice screen like the Nuclear Winter Team autofill, so everyone is happy.
---
Is there a certain way it can happen or be triggered?
---
Oof. That was a good one. Wife asked me why I'm chuckling over here.
---
Both are nice weapons, but yes, i would carry both. Remember that explosive efect damage mobs near to your target, so Instigating would not affect that mobs when you shoot them. TS it's small boost dmg, but apply always (use VATS since accuracy it's not good)
---
Wow this is extremely common today that sucks me and another guy got the same thing
---
Was just gonna say. Damn, my poor caps.
---
I read on this sub that there isn't.  
---
Meat Week isn't all that exciting either. My main is a Stealth Sniper and no rewards to benefit it. I've got the most costmetics out of any game form 76 and I don't really like them.  
---
I haven't heard of anything alternative.
---
Happens if you log out while someone is using your vendor.
---
I usually make camp where there’s junk piles, there’s a lot along the River on the left side
---
Dude go away now idc
---
IDK. I know they released a plan for summer and fall regarding things and that had dates.
---
I like the two-shot extras, and the slayers too. I'm a big fan of the kludginess of the pipe weapons, or weapons in general, in the Fallout universe... and that pushes it further.
---
Well, i have loged on and challenge timer has been reset but not the chellanges. I still see yesterday completed challenges. No new ones and wrong scores rewards for them (not x2 event reward).
---
Were you online during the score reset?
---
Same here
---
I've seen Ricochet be used in lieu of Serendipity for Bloodied PA builds.  Less chance to proc (18% vs 45%) but it's still better than nothing.
---
Instigating all the way
---
First time its happened to me in over a month. I knew it was too good to be true lol
---
The score challenges reset at 12 pm est.  dont play around that time ans it helps resuce the risk of this happening.  But it still can happen.
---
Yeah same happened to me. Wasn’t paying attention to the time and there goes all of that exp down the drain...
---
WOW this is happening alot today sorry About your points
---
Yes it was long but it was fun, hearing music, killing things 
---
And then getting a guaranteed 3* at the end
---
Me to, Ps4, I'm off for today 😩
---
Interesting, no tenderizer for me either. Piles of Chally's outfits and hats. Guess I'll have a look at the drop rates because I'm confused. :)
---
Yep, I usually avoid it, but got caught up in Grahm's Cookout and forgot to log out.
---
Lol you care! You like me! You want to kiss me!
---
But I’m taken! Sorry to break your heart!
---
Good luck. You know Glitchthesda.
---
Even with all my ammo on my big guns char, I don't run it. I have to use wandering pharma since I end up with 500 of radx, radaway stim and super stim. I try to sell them but I always end up with more
---
Happened once to me and I was really confused as to what we did wrong. Find out after watching a video stating that the events are very much bugged. It's ok though I've ran out of stash space and reached my scrip limit. Damn those legendary heavy weapon drops..
---
I’m going to have try it!
---
I think overall caps and scrip limits are fine, it's the daily that are most annoying and well, limiting. You don't really need to hold more than 30k caps or 1k scrip, whats the point of hoarding? Prices would only go higher and you'll want more caps again. I'd rather they remove daily limit OR at least arrange a barter system like it was in all Fallout games before, you buy something expensive you replenish the vendor's caps and thus can sell again. it's logical, the way it works now is kinda stupid.. I buy something for 1k and the vendor has like 200 more caps?
---
I'd use both
---
I was rocking my Excavator power armor and I hopped out and I weighed like 345, turns out I had like 250 stimpaks lol.  I 100% agree with that slogan.  I also, went through my inventory for the first time in forever and got rid of so much ammo and so many crap legendaries that I felt the need to keep when I was a low level.
---
Is that in normal gameplay or via a special action of some description?
---
True but at least this time the afk people can contribute. I think that's a good idea. People are going to afk anyway might as well give them a job to do.
---
A bridge set would be a nice addition to camp building. Lots of possibilities!
---
Exactly that, I've got a Bloodied commando and it is boring tbh. Also got a Junkies commando and a bloodied heavy but I'm gonna wait the update and build something around that. At the moment in just grinding levels across all characters so I've got some room to play with.
---
Was your last login on nuclear winter? If so then you should make sure you log into adventure mode for a few minutes before the dailies reset the next day.
---
Hard to find participants on Xbox, half the lobby are new Gamepass players with anything but meat week on their minds. I've played 5 events today, 4 failed as we had 3 or less players turn up.
---
Oh. That sucks. Thanks though.
---
And when the mission/event fails for no explicable reason, he just repeats 
---
"It's a bug, It's a feature..."  over and over until you leave the area.
---
When you approach any elevated landscape, he chimes in with
---
"See that mountain?  You can climb it!"
---
When the game kicks you out of your server or you can't join properly, Todd lovingly says
---
"Great games are played, not made."
---
Oh, Todd.  How we worship thee.
---
I used to do this, junk piles to level 50 or so then lead.. on my last 2 characters I didn’t bother the collectron gets me enough junk along with what I loot.. BUT not being tied to deposits really frees up the game for you.. there are a lot of great location  you can use.
---
There's better effects insofar as combat related that you could go for with Legendary Armor, but I have all mine with FDCWR.  Frees up two 3* perk cards by doing so.  Grilled Mirelurk Fillets as well as Deathclaw Steaks help as well (especially if you're using the Carnivore mutation).
---
My guess would be that the Atomic Shop can't tell the difference between PTS and live.  It sees the same Bethesda account accessing two copies of Fallout 76, only one has its Atomic Shop locked down, so it probably defaults to un-equipping everything.
---
Technically yeah, adrenal rush is basically a lighter version of bloodied that applies to all weapons
---
Welcome. Sorry.
---
The only reason I don’t do that is because running out of the mine while the entire things is exploding and collapsing around you is F*CKING AWESOME
---
But would it be worth it? Is there a YouTube video out there?
---
It's kinda dumb tbh.
---
Prime meats don't move the bar at all, so that's why.
---
 You can do this event solo, just make sure you're picking up every single rotting pile ASAP as they drain progress and save all of the Greens and Critter parts to donate in a lump sum. You get way more progress for a huge dump all at once. I don't add critter parts unless I have at LEAST 10 of them, and if you're trying solo save up for 20 or 30 even.
---
It should be Grahm saying that line in a mocking voice.
---
Its the whole point of Mischief Night, a seasonal Halloweeny event! Cause as much chaos and destruction at certain points at the Whitespring. Its a jolly good time!
---
o7
---
Imo it is. The negative side effect is that nerfs stims, but that can be countered with those one perks that increase their effectiveness
---
Hot.
---
Got me too and to add insult to injury, my game locked up at Primal Cuts right after the Meat Cook. I'm out for the day.
---
2 out 9 for me so far. fk this.
---
Correct.  I've seen a lot of people spreading false information about improving their odds with getting fixers, bear arms, etc by saying "don't read weapon plans".  Sure, maybe it would increase your odds some to get a Tenderizer on a toon that doesn't know any of the other special Melee weapon plans, like the Sheepsquatch club, staff, shepherd's crook etc, but by what?  1%?
---
Ok ok I gotcha that makes sense thanks. I’ll go give it a shot
---
That's why it's odd to me. In your inventory and vending machine it's classified as aid. But on the player camp vending screen there is no "AID" option; you have food, meds or stimpaks specifically and serums aren't classed as any of those.
---
It’s also useless in PvP as well - it’s been coded to not work against players.
---
It's almost meditative how it repeats, right? ;)
---
I don't know how it's connected, but I never had any autocompleted challenges because I always saw posts on Reddit about it and decided to not risk it and log off like 20 mins before and come back 30 mins after reset. Just one time I forgot about the time because I was too focused on rebuilding my camp in and bam, half of challenges are done.. I submitted a ticket just to remind them this problem still exists, ofc all I got like "we're unable to award score points blah blah blah we're investigating blah blah blah".. like the run is soon over and a lot of people lost more than I did and they're still "investigating"..
---
Yeah, just do a bloodied build, plus get addicted to some drugs and occasionally fill your health and use a junkies weapon. Junkie’s doesn’t really require anything special beyond the legendary weapon. If you’re using Unyielding armor, that should counteract the SPECIAL losses from your addictions enough that they’re unnoticeable.
---
I bought four ranks and finished a few days ago.  FO life is better without that grind.  100 ranks was too much.
---
My brother got hit by it too. Woulda been his last day as well.
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
I think dodgy is the go to considering most PA builds are not VAT heavy.
---
Ok that’s what I was also gonna ask about the armor. What chems do you recommend
---
They'd need to move a good chunk of standard perks to legendary perks for that. Way too many op perks that let you avoid mechanics
---
- Starched Genes
---
- Adamantium Skeleton 3
---
- Aquaboy
---
PVCT? My minds gone blank.
---
I've already explained that I meant I didn't initially attack them .. he attacked me while I was crafting .. I came out of my crafting station &amp; he stood in front of me .. I watched him swap weapon to a huge melee fist thing &amp; then smack me with it .. my reflex was a quick single stab back .. it was just that, a shocked reflex! He then killed me &amp; trashed my camp .. man I'm so bored of this now .. thanks for your explanation of PvP .. I think we're done here 👍
---
Drop rates are RNG. Based on drop rates posted, all the rare rewards have the same chance of dropping. Yet 25+ events done and I’ve gotten everything multiple times except tenderizer plan not even once. So drop rates are wrong or RNG is shit 🤷‍♂️
---
Or at least be listed under aid.
---
Fucking same. It actually blows my mind that Bethesda can't figure out something as simple as daily challenges.
---
Two shot is doo-doo
---
You could always get the chemist mod to reduce the weight
---
because we are cursed my friend *cries in meat flag plan*
---
I think they don't Wana that we are finish the run. 😂
---
10x the detail!!
---
It never left
---
I’m not a rifle build at all. But I’ve noticed people who use the fixer are usually a sneak/stealth build. 
---
Most of them rely on the sneak damage you get from the perk covert operative. They usually use the commando perks, not rifleman.
---
I was at my camp crafting at my weapons bench .. sorry I don't follow you "if ya red ya dead" ??
---
So no luck for you either? Are they actually in the loot pool??
---
f
---
I have all the mods from last year, and this year I was lucky enough to get the plan for the weapon itself. If you’re on PS4 (or anybody else reading this) I can mod them for you. 
---
You just have to bring me the salt/pepper/spices and I can modify them for you.
---
Thanks. I added some commando but it did nothing. I'll try covert op.
---
Yeah, it's just so frustrating. You hear a lot of bad things about this game with all the bugs, lack of communication and anti consumer practices from Bethesda.
---
I really wanted to like this game. But how can I shine it in a positive light when things like this and such keep happening, I tell you even with all the bugs I was still determined to try and enjoy the game I had purchased but things like this, bring you down man. The legendary run was not the best feature, I legit had more fun without it.
---
You right
---
No, but honestly every time it feels like a lottery. I once crashed like 2 mins after I picked up stuff on my toon, expensive valuable stuff. so now I'm kinda paranoid, but so far it works.
---
Sam here man, almost at that SS Ghillie i wanted too :(
---
Sad
---
Adrenal Reaction mutation will help if your health goes down (it gives you a damage benefit like a Bloodied weapon would).  It also helps to be be a “sneak” build and use cards like Covert Operative and Mister Sandman.
---
actually yes, I got the peppered mod, but thats it. had hoped it would be a bit more uplifting than that with the amount of events I've done.
---
When Dr. Zorbo's ship reaches the end of the map. im guessing it is like 20ish days or so?
---
Count how many spaces the bad guy has left on the atomic run. He advances 1 space per day.
---
💯
---
Same here.  Got the full chally outfit 3 times and the backpack twice now
---
Yeah there was a couple moments where I thought: “hmm I could blast you sky high right now”.
---
If you are careful on which legendary perks you select and upgrade and consider how many perks are actually just bad it is not asking too much when you consider how many levels you really need to sink into getting new perks and moving SPECIAL points.
---
I know I'm going to rank up Ammo Factory and Legenday Intelligence (while spending up to 5 levels moving 5 points from Int. to End. As I rank it up) because I will never have a build that doesn't want 6 Int. From here no matter how the meta shifts it won't affect me too greatly and given I already am running a junkie's heavy gunner PA build l, I don't see that becoming unviable. Maybe they nerf junkie's out of existence, I either find a perk card to replace chem resistant or move the points out of End. for something else.
---
I’m a pretty slow attacking build in melee, so I’ll use those to initiate pvp so I can immediately follow up triggering the fight with a power attack. Usually works pretty great.
---
Just got the plan.  Keep trying boss
---
With going to work I dont have much time to play the event
---
Can sell that for a tidy profit to the handmade users
---
Hey, here is a mod for that: [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/99](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/99)
---
This is the second day in a row for me with challenges autocompleting. It’s so frustrating especially since it’s a double score weekend.
---
Pay me 90% of what you farm in fallout and I will protect you
---
It felt like we just couldn’t get the bar to move. 
---
Even today with about 8 people there (2 afk at the barrels playing) we could barely get the bar moving. I was donating wood, putting out fires, cleaning trash and even donated chally feed. It took about 4:30 minutes to complete when previously it was over in under 1:30. I honestly think it was bugged because Grahm was no where the entire time. He wasn’t there before, during or after the event.
---
That's a shame... I'd recommend trading with players all you can after the event, that's the only reason I've got so far tbh. I just got lucky with the Tenderiser plan on my second run 😅
---
I have literally multiples of everything but not even one mod. I’m a completionist so I just want them for the collection. When is this thing over??
---
Much better Bethesda!
---
Were you playing when the challenges reset?
---
oh yeah, I died once because he scared me right onto the drill xD Good thing it was at the beginning of the fight, so I had time to come back. Was kinda funny, because I really didn't notice them, I was like since when does his fear take hp?! then I got it but it was too late xD
---
When I get off tonight I dont plan on sleeping
---
The 26th
---
Thanks but I don’t even plan on using the thing, just trying to complete the collection!
---
Yes. You basically get all the perks and mutations for bloodied and either have emergency protocols in PA or Unyielding or Bosltering Armor. Then you get addicted to five chems and get some junkies and bloodied weapons. When you you need to do more damage like on queen fights, drop your rads to nerd rage level and when you are just hopping around doing events and whatnot increase your health and just use your junkies weapons. I like playing this way because I can be tanky for the everyday stuff but I can go into stealth and do lots of damage if I need to as well.
---
The biggest downside is armor. You won't get the full benefits of Unyielding unless you are low health. Personally I use a mixed set, but you may also want to carry around a full set of Unyielding for when you do go bloodied. Without that you'll never do max bloodied damage, but there's really not anything in the game that requires that kind of damage.
---
What a 🔔🔚
---
Oh dear 😅😂😂
---
came onto the reddit to see if this happens to anyone else. im past zorbo and this shit is happening. we need a fix or rewards
---
I was so excited to finally save up the Pure Violet Flux to craft Calibrated Shocks for my Excavator armour. Then I realized that nothing actually changed about the armour except that now I can actually sprint in it.
---
I just use a mining helmet with the bright headlamp. There aren’t really many options for decent lighting. The secret service helmet has a solid light as well, but that’s quite a price tag on what is essentially cosmetic.
---
I believe that captainoob has done junkie below nerd rage threshold. You may want to check out his YouTube.
---
Ah, got it. Thanks!
---
It's kind of pathetic that we have to dedicate like 20 total perk points just for weight reduction though.
---
Finally, I can play wastelad while waiting for the meat cook to start again.
---
From a damage perspective, two shot isn't that great compared to something like bloodied or junkies... 
---
That being said, if you are wanting to completely max out damage you'll want rank 3 of all applicable rifleman/commando perks, tank killer, nerd rage, adrenaline, covert operative, Mr sandman, bloodied mess, better criticals, and tenderizer. Additionally you'll want to get adrenal reactions mutation and be at below 20% health so that nerd rage kicks in. If you're doing commando maxing concentrated fire also helps, but not by that much and you CAN get away with it at level 1 instead of 3.
---
Hopefully I didn't miss anything, but that's pretty much the meta perks for a glass cannon/max-damage rifle build.
---
I’m guessing you don’t visit this page often to read about the 100+ people making a post about the exact same problem you have. 
---
It’s a bug in the game. Happens to some people. Where you log in and your challenges are already done. And you get no credit for it whatsoever. 
---
Nothing Bethesda can do. It’s been going on for a long time and nothing has been done about it. 
---
There’s no specific reason on why it happens. Or how you can prevent it. 
---
Some people say it happens because you log in and play before the challenges reset. 
---
Some people say it’s because you log in after the challenges resets. 
---
Some people say it happens simply for turning the game on. You got screwed basically. Just hope it doesn’t happen to you again.
---
oooh I never understood it like that. makes a lot of sense tho. thanks man!
---
Im 87/100 and this has happened 3 times in the last week
---
Worse.....
---
Im in a 2 resource node spot and it takes several tries to log on.  Just the nature of having good places with resources.  
---
Loading into a world that doesn’t allow you to build a CAMP would also have player vendors that you wouldn’t see for that session.
---
This makes me think of the beginning of World of Warcraft. Everyone started to have a least one level 60 Rogue, to gank other players, or switch to when it happened to them.  
---
We would joke that Blizzard was giving away a free level 60 Rogue with the game.
---
Good! Long live Foundation
---
I just now found out he jumps one space per day lol. I feel dumb haha. Thanks for your answer!
---
I do, is that it??
---
Depending on where you are in the world, they reset at dumb times.
---
I think they reset at 18.00 BST (17.00 UCT)
---
Same happened to me...... I checked the SCORE right at 1201 PM, which might have triggered it for me. Sucks.
---
But I’m 100% sure my friend has healing factor as well, although he he’s not a bloodied build so maybe it’s the combo?
---
yes, not giving up that easy. 
---
funny how it goes
---
Mischief Night: got everything. 
---
Fasnacht: no rare shit at all (in the drops anyways)
---
Meat Week: we'll see how it goes
---
I was running a spit at the Graham's Meat Cook event.
---
Had this happen to a friend in our group couple days ago and while the person was fighting my friend with his crew I nuked there bases lmfao. One couldn’t repair it at all. This is an issue I can’t see being fixed because it’s purpose is to get team mates but you will always have people who find a loophole and ruin it.
---
Explosive in itself isn’t that useful on semi autos.  I have a mutants/explosive and it doesn’t feel that “great” when compared to an instigating.   50% limb damage is also a nice perk to look for if you hip fire the lever like I do
---
Lol .. you sound just like my uncle when he's at work 😂
---
Thanks! Very helpful.
---
This bug happens *mainly* from being online when challenge reset goes through.  Make sure you go to the main menu and you should be fine.
---
Yes it 0 S.C.O.R.E weekend event in reward for all that cork they soooo needed. I am not entertained by this. F Bethesda.
---
Got hit w the bug too, even more annoying being double score weekend
---
I wish suppressing fire was a thing in games.
---
I mean obviously it could be in games like battlefield or cod, but people just run out like suicide bombers.
---
And thats a good shout, but wouldn't doing that make me a raider?
---
Tenderizer plans have a lower chance of dropping, between (2.27% for full completion), while other items have higher chance (around 10%).
---
PA big guns build on main :(. Working on it for my melee char atm.
---
Even if it does hurt a few things I have faith that a change this unique and drastic will be prone to future changes. Until then I'll deal with it the best I can if it turns out badly.
---
Did not know that, thanks. Going to swing by and pick one up.
---
I can sound like your uncle in a few different ways
---
Guessing not as many battle pass tiers have been sold as they would like.
---
I think It just happened to me!!  ArrgH!
---
I got a stack of chef hats. I want Bethesda to let me wear a hat on my hat on my hat on my hat.
---
Thanks for the catch.
---
I see, normally they would be reset by now
---
Yeah ......... that just sounds kinda creepy now ... NOT like my uncle at all 😧
---
Meat week.
---
How did I lose the SCORE? It's part of the auto-completing challenges bug that seems to hitting quite a few people today.
---
Yeah I'm good lol
---
Server is bad in its current state, don't want to add anymore issues.
---
Same here, lost score yesterday and today. So frustrating I’m going to have to end up buying the rest at this rate!
---
And allies.
---
I run high capacity and I did just fine before I even got full SS buttressed set. I say pick whichever suits your playstyle. I'm not bloodied and I have speed demon mutation, so I carry a lot of food and chems with me, I'm also a heavy gunner with several different weapons, power armor and ammo because I like diversity in the way I delete enemies. I like that I can carry up to 410 with some food buffs. I would feel too limited with any other different backpack and I also vacuum junk in every location I see, because I like to craft stuff and rebuild my camp a lot. So if you don't need all that take whatever else you like.
---
True.
---
Oh ok, I guess that makes me feel better... a little.
---
It has hit me the last 2 days as well.  I figure it is due to the x2 SCORE week somehow.
---
Get in the van and tie yourself up, if you make me do it you won't be happy
---
I was engaged in 3v1 pvp for like a half hour so I lost track of time.
---
Here you go, the list of the event drops: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eO6GDNSlQYbnFZcyBVSP02RtSwygKcEQFH_NQi_chos/htmlview?pru=AAABdDsf4pc*s38ijPFuP4oCwGHOkHLesA#gid=0
---
What if find weird. Every day, just after the challenge reset, you see a whole bunch of these posts. Like out of the 5 I looked at the profile, 4 of them were that persons first post. They had no other posting history.
---
The 5th only had a few posts.
---
unfortunately with that mentality we would never get new content, there are bugs that already been in game for years and as hard as it might be we gotta realize this will never be a perfect game, this will always be a buggy game to his flawed foundation  
---
And I'm asking this not only due to the new legendary system, although it would be even more beneficial with it, considering how many times they already delayed legendary perks, there's almost no chance they will change how the perk coin system works as well, but even base perk cards and their management could be a lot better if this existed.  
---
of course I'm not a game developer and I don't know how hard it is to implement it, but I don't see anything bad in this that I am only suggesting
---
in most cases workshops are not even really worth the effort IMO, only ones worth taking are the power plants for their fusion core processors and maybe the ammo factory
---
And I didnt want to miss the Meat Week Event
---
Staying on during the reset can trigger an autocomplete.
---
Yeah man i dont think big goverment lizard men are trying to present fake news about challenges
---
Or is it your first meat week, wink wink.
---
Yeah, I am sure, tomorrow I will be hitted by the bug, second time :)
---
They always are ;)
---
M8 .. this is Reddit, not Randonautica 😬
---
I have never once been overencumbered after I took packrat and ammo and energy and medical weight reduction perks.
---
There is Daily Ops Team coming, wouldn't mind  a Nuke event team also, Queen/Earle
---
Damn, I wasted all my luck on stupid Tato Salad!!
---
My first character walked everywhere.  My worry was being too heavy to move at all, lol.  1500?  Later toons were better in that regard.
---
Haha
---
Totally agree. I enjoyed Beckett's story even tho it was kinda predictable it wasn't boring at all. I really disliked Sofia's story, I was making myself do it just to be finally done with it to get the achievement. She's also one of the most  annoying characters in the game, jeez..
---
As a player that played the beta but quit before I got to see events like Fasnatch and meat week, I really really adore these events. Everything about them is just laid back and fun and for meat week in particular it literally just feels like the entire server coming together as one to host a party. And the unique plans, outfits, unique weapons, etc don't hurt either. The fact that we get dirty versions of atom shop items is freaking fantastic and gives me a huge incentive to participate.
---
(Also thank you for the beer stein of this event, I was hoping that future events would have them cause I am a sucker for collectable sets.)
---
you can message me if you want and I will mod your handmade and combat rifle for you, i crafted and scrapped hundreds to get all the mods for them
---
The currencies, and on use items are character locked, and only one character can obtain them. The camp items and skins are account bound.
---
there is already a nuke emote. it is called " Let's Nuke!" and was offered for free in the atom shop. it is another variant of the original group up emote
---
I think if you're willing to do some minor hacking you can change stuff in an ini file to change the UI color. I could be wrong though, might only be the pip boy.
---
Same thing, in any case add Ign Nekrosias to get griefed
---
healing factor ...is the problem ..it intensifies if you are a bloody character
---
Lost 3k+ score today.
---
I heard rumors that it's coming out in the next update but not in this one
---
Not yet. I think on the PTS they can be purchased for bullion.
---
Should be in next major patch
---
It happens if you have the game running when the challenges update, even if your in the main menu.
---
You need to have the game completely shut down or you lose you score.
---
It’s almost like an addiction.
---
it definitely is healing factor ...or some kind of healing over time from food or if you do guided meditation event (which gives you a healing buff)
---
I think that's a slightly different bug, I actually respawn but I can't do anything
---
Thats was the problem sadly :(
---
Same here. Big ole F.
---
Im a fan of the junkyard too, damned if i get ran up on every 10 min tho.
---
As an old Fallout games fan I disagree. I hated fallout 4, but this game has a lot of interesting stories, notes, encounters, some of them have good old fallout jokes from original games. I'd say they put a lot of effort in SOME things, the game is poorly maintained tho. That I agree.
---
Ah ok thanks for the info. Does that mean they'll eventually be rolling out these features for the main game? Cause despite the flaws, like I said, I have waaaay too many perk cards. 
---
Also, to whoever down voted my question: people are allowed to not know things. These communities exist to share information. Please chill.
---
Same here, today. In fact made my own post about it.
---
This is one of my fave spots. Every time i made a new character i headed there straight away.
---
To OP, Just south of pleasant valley station is a popular spot. Nice central location. Kinda quiet. Tranquil. Has some flat land and water.
---
Same. Big F.
---
Really
---
could be, I think my bug was related to the event timer. but one time a player killed me and I couldn't even respawn at my camp or anywhere else. my map just wouldn't load and I was falling through textures..
---
I got hit by it today too. That's a lot of S.C.O.R.E ... Didn't they say that this had been fixed in the last patch?
---
Long live the Raiders and Mothman Cultists!
---
I have been doing this and people keep seeing me thinking I’m going afk and try to hit me or give me a thumbs down. They don’t realise that it gives the meter a nice little boost when it actually starts ☺️
---
Edit: want to add I don’t just stay at the spit lol
---
I got it.
---
The only folks I go after are wanted ones. Still have that atom challenge to finish.
---
Thanks m8 .. but think I'll give it a miss .. stay crispy bud 👍
---
I’d rather get a camp trophy, possibly a golden beer stein to display with a diamond encrusted 76 logo.
---
The shirt is funny, though.
---
Good info. Thanks
---
Continue being salty on reddit
---
I suspected as much, but wanted to make sure
---
Run NW if you are into PvP?
---
I ended up trading for the tenderizer plan, but I do wish you the best of luck!
---
This has happened a few times to me recently so I can sympathize. Hopefully Bethesda sets up some catch up mechanics for the last few weeks of the legendary run. Probably the easiest way to handle people bugging out and losing on SCORE + allows for people who started the season to catch up.
---
I will be sure to keep this in mind, I've been saving up key cards for this event but honestly bunkers fucking scare me. As a bloodied build, the turrets and gutsys with automatic weapons make my damage mitigation very negligible and if I'm not on high alert with good stim timings I will die very quickly. I wish there was an emote or some sort of signal to ask people to help you with a bunker raid.
---
I'll do my best not to let u down 😁👍
---
I wish I could have hoarder perks AND damage perks.
---
Meh - I'd rather new content took a break and we held Bethesda accountable for cleaning up their game first.  I don't think that is a bad type of 'mentality'.  It is a responsible one.  If you let them constantly get away with poor quality, where's their incentive to improve.  But whatever - we can have different opinions about it.  As long as we all know I'm right.
---
;)
---
Raiders do have an emote, it's called raider salute or something, I use it everyday.
---
A two shot fixer can kill most enemies in the game, give great use to 38 ammo, tag, get loot from the Queen, etc.
---
Correct
---
I didn’t like Fallout 4 as much as I liked Fallout 3, and I’m undecided on wether I liked New Vegas more than 3. I did like the player character having a voice actor though. Although while I liked Fallout 4, there is absolutely no reason the Railroad should even exist - I found them without even knowing what the hell I was doing. My first password guess was Railroad. I didn’t follow the Freedom Trail, and my understanding of people and their motives is poor at best, and there were so many holes in the logic that it drove me crazy until I learnt to put it aside.
---
I took off thru-hiker when I got the grocer's backpack. It compensated most of the lost weight. The extra AGI allowed me to max out adrenaline.
---
Think the event lasted for 4 days.
---
Wow thanks my man looks like it was just my unlucky day =(
---
It’s an MMO style storyline, so you won’t see progression until the next expansion.
---
Pulled one today and curious about this as well.
---
I think I read 9.09% Chace to get the plan or weapon. What console are you on?
---
Search meatweek droprates datamined. There is a topic about it
---
You can fix this by fast travelling with a loading screen.
---
ps4
---
Looks like all the items have high drop rates, I only did it maybe handful of times, got the costume set, tenderizer plan and backpack plan already.
---
Thats what I figured, its a fairly slow rate of fire but works well with the furious effect at least.
---
A solution! Thank you.
---
2.27% for a perfect cook off. It's the same percent for any specific mod as well.

---
Well, Combat, Marine and Scout armors having auto-stimpack with a cooldown is still stretchable, it is a pre-war armor and could have such a capability integrated as an option, Metal and Wood? Yeah that's too far
---
Some people have shit to do
---
It seems nobody knows about this. Usually I'm the only one doing it and the rest is just waiting there and does nothing.
---
But today there were a lot of people there before the event started, so all 3 drums and 3 spits were manned for the whole 2 minutes. When the event then finally started we had already over 85% progress and could complete the event in 15 seconds.
---
That was definitly the fastest I ever experienced.
---
Bummer. Nobody knows?
---
I hear you pain man and the limits on scrips, caps what's up with that.
---
And me.
---
Heartwarming and Heartbreaking! May she rest in peace, and the enemies of the Wasteland rest in pieces, as you shall now blow them all to smithereens!   
---
Cheers buddy!
---
Not really, the only worthy perk cards are SPECIAL since you're getting a lot more flexibility for your perks from them, and there's not really anything that wow's your damage, especially explosive perks, they are plain lame
---
What are you smoking?
---
i just want the meat cleaver plans. I've gotten tato salad nearly exclusively. But i did get tenderizer plans so thats lit
---
It would be worse. I know it can be frustrating, but it’s not an “Everyone” problem. Making it more complex wouldn’t end well, don’t forget that this is a game where players routinely fail to follow basic instructions at events. Too many options for logging in or too many conditions will only lead to frustration.
---
2.27%

Honestly, everyone talking about builds is disheartening, I just want to play a character with somewhat realistic perks, I don't want to have to deal with a level 15 instant killing me as a level 130 because he decided to make an overpowered build and fhe second I fight back every higher level tries to jump on me.  I'm sick of the whole meta and honestly wish they could just through out half the fallout 4 perks and weapons.  I just want perks that have indirect support in a firefight or they unlock certain paths for the main story, I also wish they could get rid of the new Legendary weapons, go back to fallout 3 or 4 Uniques and that is it, keep some of the customisation, but get rid of bloodied, mutant, and the others
---
But what killed the game for me was wastelands, I end out hope that it would expand the pre existing factions with new characters, but no, just through in daidsrs (this was ok) and some little shits who just stroll in saying its theirs now.  And don't get me started on the old high level player nerf either, I didn't play 76 again until they fixed it
---
Go look for yourself
---
I wouldn't use atoms for that. Hard to earn them now: you'll be paying dollars later or missing atom shop stuff.
---
You have a 9% chance to get a weapon plan, but that could also include plans for the flamer, shishkebab and a tenderizer itself (not the plan).
---
What do see Earl, Bugs just Bugs.
---
That's about what I was figuring, but that's certainly clearer than it was in my head.
---
Ignore the haters. 
---
It’s better to have some afk people on the drums than a failed event. 
---
But fuck those guys who are afk hiding without doing anything.
---
How about "Help I'm maxed out on caps and need to buy a recall card before my vending machines go to waste."
---
So the new Boss stuff refunds ammo and I'm sure other content will too. Also with the new ammo crafting perk, there's gonna be a lot of ammo in the ecosystem
---
I have had my camp in the same spot since fo76 debuted. The first Meat Week seemed to have no problem with it. It is only this particular event that seems to be a problem.
---
Yes you have a 9% chance to get something from that pool of items
---
It varies depending on your completion level but if you max out the meat week bar you have a 9% chance to get a weapon plan or weapon including the possible tenderizer or tenderizer plan which works out at just over a 2% chance for each.
---
Funny to me how this is always posted around the time of reset. It’s almost as if being in game when the dailies reset causes them to auto-complete...
---
I really wish they'd take the int off of unyielding. That exp competitiveness is so painful for non bloodied builds.
---
Also good news. Legendary perks are now 50 coins flat per level as of last pts build
---
They do but I hope they don’t lol
---
I'm on now and can help you out with whatever you need if you can bring steel and adhesive. I'm short on both. No need for caps, just need enough materials to be able to do the mods
---
Best you can do is not be online during switchover but even that isn’t a guarantee.
---
im sure theirs a auto downvote add on for firefox lol
---
I wish I could sell repair kits, I never use them.  They just take up inventory space
---
Nerfs and even taxes are needed.
---
Oof.
---
Thanks for the gold. I'll save it for someone very deserving.
---
These posts are made every day at the same time, within an hour or so of daily reset. It seems to only affect people who play around this time. Seems to only way to be safe is to not play around that time.
---
You mean 'feature'. 😆  
---
Which one?
---
There are dozens of us! *DOZENS!*
---
Seriously though, the reason I got into 76 was because I was hoping it'd be an open-world Destiny. Unfortunately 76 is so much less than that, but the potential is there. Tighten up the gunplay, add proper endgame chase, make PvP not suck, replace the godawful legendary system with proper endgame itemization and curated rolls actually worth grinding for, leave the CAMP building system as is, add Clan support and maybe expand the CAMP system to allow for clan fortresses, and you'll basically have my dream game.
---
HARD SAME. Swapped back to junkies and man I missed being a tank.
---
get rid of your healing factor , or regenerating armor , or stop eating food that heals hp over time , or doing guided meditation event ..aka HP regen causes this bug
---
F although I have regretted finishing the season too early as I'm one of those sick sons of bitches that actually really enjoyed the grind. September the 8th can't come fast enough. Edit: I only used 300 atoms on it.
---
as someone who is pushing 1.5k hours for the 6 months i have played i think the t-shirt should say something like " help me " or " i have no life anymore " lol
---
It really depends how your specific build is put together. The change isn’t a nerf to base damage, or to damage from one specific effect, it’s a change to how multiple damage buffs stack together. Outside of a few odd (and likely bugged) exceptions, it takes the top off the most powerful builds that rely on multiple damage stacks. 
---
In my experience, general farming/mobbing doesn’t really feel much different, if at all. Big bosses are where I really feel it, which kind of makes sense. Some of these combos were a little ridiculous. 
---
If you’re a bloodied stealth archer, relying on Bloodied, Adrenal Reaction, Nerd Rage and 9 Archer damage perk cards, you’ll feel it a lot against really tanky enemies, not much against general stuff. If you’re a full health stealth archer, just relying on damage perks and a single legendary effect, you likely won’t feel much of a difference at all.
---
Half of the events I did had some of the enemies just run in the opposite direction of us. Even when we were shooting it, also I fucking hate the one in the bog. Fog crawlers are not fun
---
Yes they are.  And if it’s explosive like you’re saying it is a legacy.

had that happen during the first double score weekend, made me so mad, I cancelled my first. Thankfully im done with the run now.
---
All gauss have built in explosive, they are energy &amp; ballistic but the rifle scales off rifleman I believe.  Shotgun off of shotgunner and are effected by demo expert.  No they are not legacy, it would have to have separate perk for that.  These are not tradable and will not have a chance for a bullet explodes roll.
---
Fallout76Custom.ini
---
I MISS POWER ARMOR
---
I know that. I'm trying to figure out why 5 of them are stuck in my Camp now, and I never bought it. Also, I can't scrap them or move them.
---
That’s a bug related to nukes I think.
---
FFFFFFFF.   Me too. I needed 3 challenges to finish the Run.
---
I would like to add to their slogan "and I can only get so many caps"
---
maybe bethesda can sell ww2 and ww1 artillery pieces from different countries manned by mr-gusty/assaultron themed of various wars  pulled by camp pets even appearing in fallout first camps as well better aiding players
---
like mobile field artillery
---
if this idea picks up 
---
I want free fallout first membership for life for my ideas
---
Mine auto completed and I was off-line.  :(
---
If Beth can block my camp/tent from loading because someone else has their tent close to the spot my stuff was using, they can't bloody well do it for event sites if they wanted to. They don't. You have a problem, not the player whose camp placement you disagree with. Server hop or go to one of the other Primal Cut event sites.
---
You can still do the weekly repeatable, it's not much but either doing lone in the sand or glassed cavern glitch will fill it out quick
---
Perhaps then you'll start playing it as it was intended, from full health you are getting more damage and your own damage increases as well. Not really their fault you're hurting yourself by using it in unexpected way
---
Wait.... What? When
---
You can scrap unwanted perk card in exchange for perk points you can invest in legendary perks which are a new kind of advanced account wide perks that are actually kind of awesome. They are not officially in the game yet only on the Puplic Test Server.
---
Thanks!
---
Is it still up?
---
Yeah yeah makes sense I should have to get rid of all 7 of my mutations and then regain them so I can fast travel because of a Bethesda issue. No thanks
---
Uh. That bloodbug icon perk is insane sneak attack damage.
---
Why is that’s a thing
---
True, but I need 13 of those. I had hoped that a few easy dailies would do the trick.
---
They will be also in the next patch (there are on the PTS)
---
This is the fix for now. It’s not even that great a mutation anyway
---
 i got you it sucks and it's a bug that shouldnt exist ...but this will solve your problem , so either take that advice or just deal with it till they fix it
---
I'm on 77, I think I don't can finish this run with this bugs.
---
It’s been glitched out since wastelanders. I use to sink them all the time.
---
Saves me stims in theory allowing me to make more money
---
Ultracite has higher fire rate than normal laser versions.
---
Dont have do all of it, just play like you usually do, pop mentats or any int boosting items, doing your dailies will fill the bar out, like for Roxy etc
---
I went to the pioneer scouts to get that backpack as soon as I found out about it
---
There is a daily challenge to take a workshop so..,
---
Players did complain about having too many leftover perk cards... Or maybe it's to limit the usefulness of a perk load out manager forcing people between having access to too many options or having legendary perks.
---
Are stims actually hard to come by though?
---
The Prime Cut event in the Bog is great for hitting the weekly repeatable goal as "bonus" Score points. Hopefully no more bugs for you and you can make up some ground!
---
Not in the live game yet. Only on PTS.
---
It’s all junk and flux for me, I’d rather not pay 13 dollars a month for a scrap box
---
Stash your junk.
---
You know they are not in the live game yet? They are currently being tested on the PTS
---
Im greedy back off
---
Legacy laser weapons are useless on the queen or colossus.
---
Is there any reason to do anything but show up near the end and get the reward? I noticed all the level 400 ish guys are AFK. I have only been able to deposit prime meat once, it never lets me so without the script reward I just wait to pick up chally's poo and the garbage piles so I can help. Honestly I don't know if that is even important.  Maybe I don't get it but I have done it several times and I don't seem to do anything. I kill the critters and nothing, I hit the wood pile and nothing. Oh I turned the spot once but you just look at yourself and it didn't seem to do anything.  I think if I keep going I am going to just stand on the shelter at least I can watch everyone so it won't be so boring.
---
I’ve been 500 pounds overencumbered for like the past 3 months straight. I physically have to walk everywhere because I can’t fast travel, meaning if I wanna join events I have to walk from across the map to get to them. Todd help me.
---
They haven't been implemented they are only on the PTS \^\_\^
---
It still performs much worse than a regular laser, which should not be the case. it either needs a damage buff, or a fire rate and durability buff so that it's performance is greater than normal lasers as is the case with the gatling laser varieties.
---
They are classified as energy weapons, and the ammo is affected by “batteries included”
---
Patch 22
---
I hope soon.  The rewards aren’t really interesting
---
I'm just using 9 cards in archery, on an instigating bow. With like 3? I think, in stealth perks. So then I should ultimately be doing roughly the same damage on mobs? 
---
For bosses I use vamp/furious autos, with only 1 perk. Not godly, but they do a fair share. 
---
Thank you for your input. :)
---
I just wanted to correct you and say that adrenal reaction lowers your max HP by 50 before class freak. The mutation you're thinking of is healing factor, which lowers effectiveness of chems including stims.
---
No because the gauss shotgun is new. It was never around when the explosive energy weapons were dropping. However the gauss mini, shotgun, and pistol do have an area damage effect.
---
September 8th at noon ET marks the end of the tenth week. It is highly unlikely Bethesda would end the last week early, so you should have a full seven days from Tuesday September 1 to compete your weeklies.
---
For commando you need to put on an auto reciever
---
I know. I like PvP.
---
Same the constant 1* star drop is demotivating me
---
You can roll explosive still, a guy I play with on pc rolled tse gauss mini
---
I haven’t tested Instigating myself, but it won’t be as drastic a difference as Bloodied. You’ll probably see smaller numbers, but I imagine it’ll still be good enough for the way you’re using it.
---
Yeah, but how long I have to grind when the auto bug hit again ang again? The have to activate more taskt to have a chance to finish it.
---
Exactly.  It’s just taking up inventory space waiting to scrip it because I hit my limit real quick daily.  So I’m just sitting on a pile of garbage lol
---
If you're on xbox i can give you a pretty good bloodied commando weapon later
---
Yea
---
3000 Thursday and 4500 today. F F F F F.
---
I don't agree with you at all. They're fine. If anything, they should just be more effective specifically against scorchbeasts.
---
Thank you so much. Very helpful. 
---
I think you might be right.
---
Without question your one star bloodied handmade/fixer will out DPS a TSE variant. Explosive adds 20% damage. Two shot adds 25% to base damage. Even if it were a full damage increase that is 45% additional damage.
---
I think bloodied does like 80-100% more damage at below 20% health. When this stacks with nerd rage 20% add damage, stealth with covert operative 135% more damage, gun fu/adrenaline, and adrenal reaction a bloodied fixer will hit a level 68s supermutant at about 1,200 - 1,600 damage per shot. If I were to guess, a fixer probably fires 6-9 shots a second. 
---
My point is while explosive and ffr only add to the devastation, it’s totally overkill most of the time. I would rather have a one star bloodied variant of anything over any other combination of effects of a different legendary effect.
---
Awesome. I really hope so. I've wanted bows in fallout forever, and finally getting them has been so much fun for me. I'd hate to see them become useless.
---
What does a Raider emote have to do with a Raider event?
---
I felt this post in my soul
---
No, despite having asked many times about getting ways to reroll our characters and artificially create situations to test specific stuff via things like a cheat terminal, we've been constantly ignored.
---
Basically, if you want to test anything in the test server, you have to not only find out yourself what actually changed, since outside of a summarised descriprion of the "new features to try", we don't get any actual patch note to start the PTS, AND we also have to spend our own time and take it away from the main game to grind on characters that will be deleted, for a one-off chance to test stuff and be most likely ignored on the forums.
---
That's the way it is, sadly. It makes the ability of us testers to actually test the patch extremely limited, and we still get blamed by the rest of the community once the patch inevitably releases broken. "What's the purpose of the PTS if they don't test shit?" I've seen this kind of comment way too many times.
---
Um... they have not been implemented yet
---
Well I don't think the main story was bad in FO76, it's a matter of preference I guess, I enjoyed it, I enjoyed the choices. In my opinion in Fallout 3 your choices make little impact overall unlike it was in New Vegas. I won't even mention Fallout 1 and 2. You can literally ruin your future possible quests with certain NPCs by choosing a wrong thing to say or for example you get a lot of different endings or your choice in the beginning of the game affected the end and those low intelligence dialogue choices were priceless. We lack most of that in modern fallout games ever since 3. New Vegas was the best to me because it had so much freedom and impact and you weren't a fancy vault dweller destined to save the world, they also saved some old Fallout mechanics. But FO76 apart from game breaking bugs has (had?) a lot of potential.
---
Yeah. I hear Ching Ching meat week progress sounds.
---
Sorry I read the post wrong.  Didn’t see the shotgun part
---
That’s got to be a massive bug or hacked. Energy weapons haven’t dropped explosive since I want to say month 2 of the game. They do come with a built in effect but the gauss shotgun pistol and mini came out with wastelanders and have never dropped actually with the explosive perk.
---
A g r e e
---
Would you believe if everytime I saw event, I just read it as emote lmao. Somethings wrong with me.
---
No freaking thank you.
---
What about Shadowed mods for it?
---
Not sure what to say but I believe you though
---
That's strange because I'm told instigating rifles are good for most mobs on the PTS
---
There’s not enough people built on water that has hills on either side for them to ever add this, would be a waste of time when they could design something a lot of people could buy. And how would it work? Would you be able to make it longer or shorter to adjust it? And even then, the camp circle isn’t even big enough to make a drawbridge that even makes sense. If the lake is that small, no boats would ever have to go through the draw bridge because there’s no reason they would be on the lake/pond
---
Damage is not changing for me personally, only enemies becoming same level, which should have been the case to begin with since they can't just expand map to create new higher level areas, that doesn't scale =)
---
With super duper 3 you can make endless amounts of assaultron heads and scrapping. It’s basically steel —&gt; screws
---
They actually dont take up that much space, I have 200 or so
---
It funnels the populace and ostriches the rest from using specific perk cards they use while playing with normal players, such as rad sponge
---
If you guys do have explosive ones screen shots please cause that would be crazy. I mean just because it doesn’t drop like that doesn’t mean Bethesda hasn’t messed something up and you’re the first to see a new bug.
---
Also you said one stars aren’t good on their own that’s the reason for my comment. I don’t want noobs thinking that if they see this and script a bloodied handmade when in reality it will serve them just fine.
---
Sorry but the whole use around ultracite weapons is that they are experimental weapons infused with ultracite to perform better than their normal counterparts. With gatling laser this is 100% true, an ultracite gatling laser is a clear improvement over a regular one, with lasers however this is simply not the case and should be balanced accordingly. Indicative of its max lvl and rarity to obtain/ mod, ultracite lasers are treated as end game weapons but are immediately outperformed by normal ones.
---
Yeah, it was a bit frustrating, a lot actually. Starting from vendors sinking into the floor to lost carpets inside of the nest xD
---
I shall ask him and let you know!
---
Smh it makes no sense to release a event like this and give us a cap at the same time
---
So if I was to post a pic of a gauss shotgun that was rolled this morning it would not have explosive on it
---
If they would just increase the freaking cap allowance on vendors this would solve the majority of my problem. I collect scrap like it's my job so how the hell I'm supposed to offload hundreds of scraps of the non-bulking items for only 1400 caps a day, I have no clue.
---
No, the whole idea behind ultracite is so it is a developed weapon to fight the scorchbeast menace, that is literally the lore behind their use. Hence why we also have ultracite ammo.
---
You mind providing a video becouse I'm confused how a garage door becomes a draw bridge
---
If it does this is very exciting
---
It doesn’t, but you can have a bridge with a doors that opens and shuts upwards
---
300 perk coins equates to 150 perk cards, you get 9 perk cards for every 5 levels, that's 83,3 levels to max out 1 legendary perk, or 500 levels to rank up 6 of them.
---
p.s. By level 100 you'll have around 150 perk coins.
---
Fans too
---
That's true but it's an outlier. It also can't be silenced. :(
---
F f f f f f f f f f f f f f f ff f f f ff f f f f f f f ff f f f f f f f ff f f f f f f f. Ff f f f. F f f f f f ff f f f f f ff f f
---
You save the progress of the previous level. You rank up to the next level so if you're half way to the next one and buy a rank up you'll be half way to the next lvl.
---
There’s no meaningful consequences in 76 either - the one real consequence was missing out on the free radicals mask which was legendary. Not anymore. If enough people whinge and bitch about not making the right choice, we learned the hard way Bethesda will always take something away, no matter what you traded for it or if you earnt it.
---
Heh, no worries!  I was wracking my brain tryin for figure out if there was a Raider event that earned you an emote or something. 
---
***Now drop your weapons, Raider scum!***
---
Wasn't this already added?
---
This happened to me twice this week, once on the first day of double score and again just now on reset. 9k score lost all because the dumb ass developers can't fix their own game!
---
I had 8/9 auto completed (don't bother with NW), I think it might be based on how many challenges you completed the previous day, can anyone else confirm?
---
PA displays are coming in the next patch
---
It's coming dude relax 😎
---
It was 500 (100 + 150 + 250).
---
What I don't get is that there isn't even a reward for 760 hours. It just goes straight from 76 to 7600.
---
Yay!
---
You know the level-up bubblegum works for that? Just save your perk bubblegum when you get it and pop one to complete the challenge when you need it.
---
Well I can't really say what it was like before, i only play for like 3 months and while I understand it's a damn broken grindy game I still like it. I completely support people complaining about bugs, maybe daily limits but I also see a lot of complaining and bitching over nothing or completely insignificant things. So in some ways it's a messed up game for a messed up mass of players. Some enjoy it, some don't.
---
Whatever you say it's still undeniable they are rarer to obtain, cap at lvl 50 unlike lasers 45, and are much harder to mod, only to much less effective than a regular laser. Explain to me why the ultracite gatling laser is such a clear improvement when the ultracite laser is not. And why ultracite lasers should remain less effective than a normal laser?
---
The ultimate culmination of damage is a bloodied build, but it comes with trade offs. 
---
But vs a completely perk less/no legendary build, a bloodied gun build will do approx. 10x as much BASE damage, without even factoring in the effects of higher damage in terms of armor penetration etc. , or sneak damage, criticals, headshots, etc. 
---
Melee can get even more absurd due to strength scaling and mutations.
---
I think they always say they are looking at it or some other nonsense answer.
---
Thankfully it's much less now.
---
What’s the weight on each?
---
So he attacked you and you attacked back. The game doesn't care about reflexes haha you attacked back. So triggered pvp. What's so hard to understand. 
---
Again original point. 
---
Put Pacifist ON and DONT ATTACK anyone at your camp.
---
I like the raider underarmor, it's got perception, agility and luck
---
True, only 300 (50 + 100 + 150), which makes legendary perks upgradable even at early levels and you won't need 833,3 levels to rank them all up, 500 seems like a reasonable amount of levels needed for maxing out legendary perk cards while playing the game without too much pressure to get there
---
They only seem to fail for me when someone has their tent in the area. Have had about 25% fail. All the others (with no tents) have finished.
---
did not know that either, thanks! i hardly see anyone nuke WS anymore for some reason so i didn‘t even think of that. :D

Well done!  I’m 6 behind you and missed 5 days straight.  Double bubble weekends help.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I do like 76. But in my opinion, it’s for the hardcore Fallout fans. I wouldn’t play any other game from any other series if it was as broken as 76.
---
It will be pretty much same as before, they will add double the amount of dailies to obtain score throughout the weekend. (No weekly)
---
If you're on pc I could give some for free, I don't need them as it always drops stuff i don't need or want so they're just laying in my pocket.
---
5 minutes? where‘d you got that info from? i killed the SBQ in more time than that and i still got to join in an instance? hm.
---
Seems like a bug... @bethdev?
---
What a bellend for tagging up for pvp and agreeing to it at your OWN camp then coming onto Reddit to lie about the situation for sympathy haha 
---
This entire thing should of been. 
---
TLDR I attacked a Wanted player at my camp and he owned me. Now give me sympathy because I don't understand pvp. Haha
---
.1 I believe, so 200 is 20 lbs
---
You reminded me I gotta claim some Items.
---
It's low level loot though?
---
Raider Leathers I think.
---
I'm 5 behind Zorbo (started really late and missed days), but I've been closing the gap. I think I should still have it done if I don't miss any more days and if I do some NW.
---
That’s a good take
---
Ok thanks, and how do I get shielded lining for raider armor? I just checked and the strongest one I have is resistant lining
---
edit: ty
---
&gt;!it will cost 100 gold bullions and is sold by faction vendors!&lt;
---
I also want to deconstruct ranked up cards entirely. I currently have a (maxed) Rank 3 card, and another Rank 2 which is animated. I want to  rank up the animated one to rank 3, but it won't let me because I already have a (non-animated) Rank 3. Sucks!
---
I hit Lv. 76 last night.  Got a while to go till I get there.
---
I lose sneak as soon as the prime beasts spawn. I just assumed it was a mechanic of the event.
---
Yeah, true. Sometimes I wonder why I even play it but it's oddly addictive. I wouldn't name myself a hardcore fan, I'd probably never play it at launch (and I didn't because I hated 4th and I thought this one would be worse). I just wish it was maintained better.
---
That wasn’t the point lol, yeah no shit ‘if u don’t like it MOVE!!’ Lol just wanted to generate some convo
---
Lol my mom one of those cars...first thing that went out on it was that computer that controlled everything lol
---
Yup, and by default, the main event is failing when nobody shows up for it because they're dinking around with primal cuts that isn't going to complete half the time.  After I get the tenderizer plan, I'm done with this, as that's all I have left to get.
---
Also Cannibal perk should receive some kind of positive meat effect
---
Oh wow I was going to ask if she still had it rip I read they were common for that problem to arise
---
I should probably get Fallout and Fallout 2, if I can find them. They seem like they’re good games, but I don’t like turn based games.
---
Htd pieces don’t stack FYI
---
I’ve been farming it pretty hard so I havent been able to check in SBQ or Encrypted for comparison.
---
Is there rest of game working just fine for you?
---
It's a tse gauss rifle, I must have misheard him lol
---
Make sure your Pipboy light is off.    
---
It's hard to tell it's on in the daytime and anything can spot you. In Fallout 4 an icon shows up when it's on. If it ain't broke Bethesda.....
---
Making damage buffs additive instead of multiplicative without doesn't balance anything, it affects all weapons and builds.  Low health bloodied builds will be more important than ever with low damage builds becoming even weaker and more reasourse intensive. The OP legacy weapons in the game are still OP. SBQ will still be killed in seconds by legacy and bugged weapons. What will change is the grind time for casual players to make ammo. Most enemies don't drop ammo. I feel that BGS is really only after increasing play hours. I don't feel this has anything to do with balance, just not pissing off the player base who has OP weapons while getting console players to play longer.  Welcome to the new Farming 76.
---
It's the weekend so probably first thing Monday
---
You should've tried them when they were new back in the day xD If you missed that time it might be very difficult to adjust to that old fashioned kind of game but if you'll be able to, you won't regret it!
---
I just want them to fix the lunchbox position on the Thanksgiving display...
---
I thought they stacked up to 3? Like Powered
---
Oh most definitely you still got some time, bro
---

---
I just switched to PC and have been looking in camps all week for serums... I've been going to everyone that has "AID" stocked up... Lol thanks for this
---
It nust works..... after a hot fix....
---
The double score should help you a lot with catching up, good luck!!
---
Yeah man, light is off... thanks for the reminder
---
Lol I had the past 6 levels to claim xD so I feel that
---
So, which character gets the reward if you accept it from the log in screen?
---
They are on Steam if you have a pc and they're adjusted to newer systems like Windows 10.
---
Yes, and it even works if you are alone in the group
---
No idea on the second question
---
Thanks! And I hope so! Meat Week is also helping a big. No shortage of Tasty Squirrel stew.
---
They'll update the atom shop on Thursday, but not the console.
---
Yeah, no. I barely understand everything that goes on now, and there’s probably a lot that I’m missing. I’m only 19 and I’m autistic as well XD
---
That is a legacy. But yeah those are around
---
This is why punctuation is important.
---
Seems to be happening more often also. At first it was uncommon, now its turning into more fails than successes.
---
Really? Awesome thanks for that on herd mentality, empath question is a harder one i know!
---
No PC unfortunately. If I recall correctly, you get them on the Xbox 360? I ain’t sure. I know for certain I played 3 and NV on a 360 that’s gotta be 8 years old. Probably older.
---
I noticed that too. I also noticed that, if you fail, as soon as the event ends I start getting sneak attack messages again.
---
It’s still 40 scrip and a useless drops level doesn’t matter if no one wants it
---
Nope. Captainoob has video showing it doesn’t stack at all
---
The one you played with last
---
worked!! thank you!
---
Yeah I knew it was lol, I've got a fe flamer and fe gat laser
---
Oh hell yes
---
It's a very simple game actually xD it just has some riddles and it doesn't tell you where to go and what to do, you'll have to think a little. old fashioned yeah, but far more interesting than most modern games with their markers in every quest lol. but it's just my opinion tho :p
---
It's a mechanic on the prime events. Also, for a chance to escape artist to work you need to break line of sight first, it has always been this way.
---
Cool idea but I would settle for a junk gate to go with the junk walls
---
I don't have a console so I cant really help with that, only got pc for now.
---
single shot weapons are hit significantly with the nerf.
---
There's a real spark between Rose and him
---
The Daily Ops team is in the PTS right now. Should be making its way to the live server soon^^(tm).
---
Ok good to know.
---
Yeah escape artist is not working even after enemy is dead... the event finished and it takes a while to get out of caution.
---
Melee build here, stash is always full of junk, legendaries to exchange and ammo
---
I’m guessing maybe Tuesday with an update
---
It was probably patched in the latest PTS update to have the cap increased to 50. I can't confirm this as I bought Fallout 76 on Steam and can't access the PTS :(
---
I like quest markers that tell you roughly where it is, you know how 76 gives you an area marker? I don’t mind those quest markers but unless it’s for something like a mole rat or radscorpion I’m not a fan of the diamond/square markers.
---
The funny thing is that season 2 Will almost certanly release regardless if they fix it or not... Rediciolus!
---
Wow...can’t wait to be the smart guy in my group today

Fast travel to the Moonshiner’s shack and walk.
---
We (me and the crew) were just talking about this the other day, and, I'm at around 2500 hours (been playing since launch) and I honestly dont see me even MAKING IT to 7600 hours.. a shirt wouldn't be enough in my opinion
---
You ain't missing nothing. Other than pissing away 5k ammo of your choice on an (awqwardly) walking bullet sponge for a 1-star lead pipe reward.
---
You're FAR better off hitting the meat week events.
---
What a disappointment
---
Just take my money already!
---
Doesn't deep-pocketed net you more carry weight than ultralight saves?
---
Ok , really hoping for reasons to visit Forest again and other places thats low lvl now 😁
---
May the FFFFFFFF autocomplete bug stay far away.
---
I don't think stealth works in Primal Cuts just like when the Mole Miner Supervisor comes out in Uranium Fever.
---
I have crashed out more than times completed and times failed combined. The piles of radscorpion eggs lying around is absurd.
---
I haven't gotten it yet surprisingly.
---
I believe you need another player on the team for empath to work, 99% on that. The big buffs from it come from strength in numbers. Effectively works better than lone wanderer.
---
Well in first Fallout you have like a diary if I remember correctly, not even a quest log. You're given a task, you're sent to the Wasteland and that's it, then you do whatever and go wherever the hell you want with a task, just like irl you make friends or enemies who may or may not help you with your quest. No areas or markers, just Wasteland xD
---
Can’t say I really did much of it last year and I had no idea it was even Meat Weak until I played 2 days ago but it’s been pretty fun. I can never find Fog Crawlers so it’s nice there’s an event where I can fight a ton of them as well as other creatures. Hell, I’ve seen more Super Mutant Behemoths the last 2 days than I have the last year and a half lol.
---
I got the Chally suit so just need the head piece, are they super rare and hard to get?
---
At least he is legendary unlike these mongrels and molerats
---
Better yet, let me hide the markers. So annoying.
---
I only need the tenderizer plan and one mod at this point. I had like 8 grills and 2 backpack plans and they sold quick
---
I'm carrying about 50k of 5mm as it has zero weight on my build but I keep picking up 500 of it every time I kill super mutants with mini guns... Not sure if I have enough yet. 45, 38 and 44 are also weightless and have about 30k amongst them.... I can't stash it so just slowly convert it when I run low on ammo I actually use.
---
What do you mean? There's plenty of Raider-themed photomode frames.
---
Or, or! I have a better idea, why don't they make the UI actually function so people don't need to use these shitty alternative methods just to get the game to "work"?
---
Alright thanks. Really unfortunate.
---
It’s a hop, skip and a jump....
---
Lots of people get the auto complete everyday. Why do so many feel the need to make a new thread about it each time?
---
That’s great, as long as you have a map so you have a rough idea where you’re going and where you are. I mean, I’d keep a map in real life...
---
Later this year
---
It’s the CAMP’s with lots of ‘misc’ that I go to. But it’s the Treasure Maps that I look for. I used to sell lots of serums but lately, sales have been pretty flat. In fact I’m pulling the majority of plans and armor that I have in the vendors and dumping it so that can make room for more bulk junk that I can not keep in stock
---
There is no point playing for me. Out of the 8 or so I did and didn't fail me for no reason, I only had a bloody chess hat and a stein plan. Most of the time I get the respawn bug on prime cuts as there is only ever me doin them and that kills my mojo to play the game at all.
---
Happy to hear some people are having great luck though as that means I can buy stuff instead of being fucked over by the game mechanics and RNG.
---
Same. Safe is boring, and there’s going to be a bunker in the next season. So I just got the fence.
---
Yeah you have a map, what I miss is random encounters as you travel. Can be an enemy, can be a trader or a story teller. Oh yeah, it's also has this queue system, so beware xD
---
Sounds like you haven't learned how to craft a normal Jetpack on your X-01 Armor.
---
You can only craft the CC Jetpack if you know how to craft the normal Jetpack for that Armor.
---
u/valseek &amp; u/ladydevann
---
This is how you loose 2 customers in one fell swoop. Might be time to clean house with CS?
---
.45 is loaded to a MUCH lower pressure. Standard 230 grain .45 flies at 830 fps with 356ft/lbs of energy. Aka slow and fat.
---
5.56 standard 62 grain m855 flies at 3020 fps and has a muzzle energy of 1,323 ft/lbs of energy
---
.45 should ALWAYS do less damage than 5.56
---
Definitely agree this is a dick move. Had this happen to me once and I was like wtf. I didn't bother with PvP because I don't find that very fun and I didn't care about the workshop, but damn man, just why.
---
ITS BECAUSE OF THE TENTS AND CAMPS PLACED IN THE AREAS WHERE THE WAVES SPAWN!
---
I hope not
---
But as long as there is another player (even without empath) then you get the benefit? that was my understanding but wanted to check that was accurate and stil the case
---
They said next tuesday
---
What you talking about man it's by far one of the most rewarding event yet. People gonna complain over literally everything
---
I have yet for this to happen to me on PS4 and I have played every day of the season.  I wonder what factors influence this.
---
Third times a charm for me, I did walk through and open doors. I did not drop down intonthe hole on the ground to get to the basement.
---
Some People suck!
---
Ah, that might be it. I never learned the plan, I just bought the mod for the jet pack. Thank you. Now I have to server hop and try to find the plan.
---
These prime beast have more awareness than the SBQ. I can crouch right in front of her blind as a bat face.
---
It wouldn't hurt to have but im sure there are better legendary perks which would benefit you more.
---
Well drop rate you did even trade. But with the tenderizer having a plan it's going to be saturated in the market soon
---
250/500 is normal
---
I dealt with three separate people. How can they justify quickly giving people refunds on the very same bundle that is broken, and give me problems when even my son swears he saw me click purchase. I have NEVER asked for a refund on any of the broken bundles before because personally I felt like they would eventually be fixed and I would get what I paid for.
---
I've made that mistake too often. It makes sense but that icon should be there.
---
The Primal Cuts enemies will always put you in [DANGER]. They ignore the sneak mechanics entirely. This is intended functionality.
---
Also, HTD sneak doesn't stack - you only benefit from one.
---
Why?
---
I’ve played since launch and enjoy it. Personal decision obviously but I think it is good. It has issues here and there but much more stable these days.
---
take that with a grain of salt now, one commenter said it‘s only 5 minutes.
---
Pip boy light has no impact on detection.
---
Platform?
---
The fun part of grinding through defending 6 workshops, and these Challenges get completed but forget to redeem the Items.
---
That's not the point.
---
Of course I could just do that but why should I have to? Why can't they just make a map that isn't a piece of shit?
---
If it is they’ll fix it and break something else in the process
---
Well, either way it does'nt really matter! This is a confermed bug and The more attention it gets the better.
---
Haha I feel you 😅
---
Yep
---
If you abandoned ship that early then yea the game is in a much better shape then it was before. 
---
The wastelanders update will surly make you enjoy the game longer.
---
Don’t force yorself if your getting tired of playing the game like a moble game. You can always put it down and come back later. The only things you’ll be missing out is cosmetic stuff.
---
There’s quite a bit in this game now that makes it worth its initial price tag.
---
It does matter if people are lying and making false posts. Sounds like your one of the people behind these bogus posts.
---
Nope. Finished events fine with both in the area. Failed with neither in the area.
---
ultra-light is about bonus AP and stealth bonus (less armor weight/noise)
---
I wish they did not need to nuke the mines to active a Colossal Problem.
---
It was me. Looks like I declared war.
---
BlackClock69#660, bullet count 64.
---
Please, feel free to buy my ammo to kill me with!
---
Personally I think being able to share either Reverent, Team Medic, or Mysterious Stranger are top tier perk cards to share. If not just Reverent while hoping someone on your team has 9 CHA that can share a lvl 3 Mysterious Stranger and then things start getting whacky.
---
I'm on level 97 and I can taste the end....  Tuesday latest.  Then a break from the game.
---
It doesn't. I've had them spawn far without and without camps and tents and fail with and without camps/tents.
---
Amazing how people are fine with the game being unpolished because 
---
"Duhhh but it's so close to this other location xDDD"
---
Alright, understood, thanks
---
Gauss shotgun is not energy, but the other gauss weapons are.
---
Why would it be false because it's their first post?
---
I’m trying to do the math and see how much lvls we need to max all 5 slots 
---
With the 300 perk coin for rank5 that a total of 1500 perk coins we’ll need to max out 5 cards? If my math right that lvl300 to max everything out is that right
---
Understandable
---
Zoom the map in...
---
mole rats are the issue at primal cuts ...thats why they are at all the events they break your stealth instantly
---
It's a nice idea, but if everything was viewable at a distance or at least guessable, then people wouldn't take the chance of visiting that camp, I like it the way it is myself, yeah it costs caps to travel but caps are piss easy to make, yesterday I picked up Red Menace form a random camp for 199 caps which I would most prob would never have visited if I had too much info.
---
I run a junkies/bloodied hybrid. Works very well! Not far from only bloodied
---
I want some chicken tendies
---
I have noticed a shinier sheen on some items. The best comparison I think is the industrial water purifier look at it real close obviously low resolution and dumpsters then look at stealth suit when wet ideally but does have way better texture than purifiers. Much shinier I do think that at some stage they increased some of the resolutions of certain items when they ironed some issue out. Also newer items particularly ones not from fallout 4 have nicer textures. My graphics card is unchanged from beta.
---
The fact that shortly after the reset, within minutes you have multiple posts from newish accounts with only 1 post to them?
---
Were you online during the reset time? They reset at 9am Pacific time; if you’re online during that time, they can bug out and not reset/show as complete. I set an alarm for myself at this point- 8:50 and I stop events, get ready to log off and don’t log back on until at least 9:05
---
I have both and with same sneak build instigating does more damage. I even put 5 star demo expert perk card on and while it increased the TSE lever damage it wasnt as good as the instigating one. I repair the instigating rifle i would guess maybe after 150+ shots. TSE breaks after about 20.
---
I am at whitesprings. My turrets are constantly killing ghouls and I always get loot from them. Even if I wasn’t at camp when they killed them. I am on Xbox one.
---
This still happens 10 years in the future? Dah fuck.
---
Yeah I was but that was almost 2.5 hrs ago and I turned the system off watched a movie and still haven’t test
---
Todd:  
---
Verbal reaction from the hotfix aftermath - “Flawless”
---
Yea that sucks and takes out the will to grind it if u want everything
---
Pro-tip: Don't sink a lot of points into packrat or strong back. They seem appealing early on, but out of all of the carry weight perks, they're some of the least useful. Ultimately, you're going to be breaking down all of your scrap and storing it away in your stash box or scrap box as quickly as you can; having a perk which reduces the weight of items you don't want to have on you for very long is a wasted slot. It's always better to devote those slots to things which reduce the weight of items you DO want to have on you all the time, like bandolier for ammo or walking pharmacy for medicines.
---
Amen to that, that's why I don't connect there anymore.
---
It's a useless joke this "testing".
---
IGN?
---
You count as your own teammate no matter the team size. That being said herd mentality says "when on a team" and empath says "teammates". Due to wording herd mentality just needs you to be on a team, regardless of size, empath requires another player to have teammates then you count as one of the teammates and get the buffs to DR
---
They shouldn't have buffed automatic weapons in the first place
---
They've added a lot of things that people had asked for since launch (NPCs most notably). However you'll still find some bugs/crashes/server crashes they annoy you. I absolutely love the game and have played it since launch but refrain from flying in with expectations that it's this polished game suddenly.
---
Foundation: *"Yay it's slippy out!"*
---
If you know that your having issues. Why not travel to v76 or the moonshiners shack, and walk there a few minutes before it starts
---
Yeah, they redid some graphics stuff with the Wastelanders update, and under certain circumstances with certain cards, everything looks glossy (seems to be mostly from rain, when using AMD)
---
500/1000 is double.
---
X-01 for me mainly because it looks intimidating, I also use the excavator with a raider skin
---
“Make PvP not suck”
---
Lol this guy.
---
I agree. Stop hoarding radaways and stimpacks in your box as well. I know guys who keep 500-1000 stims in their box. Like why? You get dozens per an event sell them or drop them. And you don’t need to keep 15k of .38 rounds to sell in your vendor. NOBODY USES THAT
---
I’ll take those items off your hands if you’re worried about it! But I’ll reiterate what was already said, as long as you don’t have duplicates of god roll items then you will be just fine.
---
I use toxic goo from West Tek to bring them down fast and then if I have time I fast travel to my base and scoop up water if I need to replenish my supply or if not I use the radiation barrels to add some rads.
---
Yeah there's literally no reason not be below 20% hp on any build
---
It weighs like 27 pounds with one of the mods. It's mental.
---
You've missed a lot of changes
---
every now and then. And it's usually at something like scorched earth
---
Still tho I LOST SO MANY CARDS FROM OPENING PACKS
---
Ah. Fair. Wasn't thinking about it that way. Thanks.
---
They were buffed?
---
How longs left?
---
Are you sure they didn't reset? It's possible they did and got auto-completed.
---
Don't use Strong Back, it is by far the weakest carry weight perk in the game. 40lbs is nothing.
---
When you kill the critters, loot the critter chunks and go turn them into the shopping cart. Same for the weird looking green plants - there's a cooler beside the shopping cart. 
---
Also cleaning up the poo and garbage piles as well as turning the spits helps keep the meter from dropping back - so it is important.
---
In other words - Everything you do helps even if it isn't obvious. So keep doing what you're doing. But standing around doing nothing wont.
---
My cousin called my aunt's Regal the space shuttle.
---
You can finde the nuka cola Skin in the game
---
Far worse. If the first world doesn’t let you place your camp and/or tent, then there should be both the option to stay, or the option for the game to find a world where those can be placed.
---
It’s the repeated ‘can’t place your camp/tent’ that gets annoying.
---
Thirded
---
You have to be all in on two handed melee swinging a non RW L.T.
---
Can you explain this a bit further please? 
---
Much appreciated
---
Watch your compass and run to the prime enemies as soon as they spawn. Check your map for more as soon as the compass markers are gone.
---
No they only last longer.
---
If only there was a free fast travel point right next to it...
---
Yep autocompleted and no credit... anyway to fit it?
---
There are two different meat week events: a cookout and a prime hunt. Do both.
---
Fourthed
---
Monagah power plant if I need a lot of
---
Rads. If I’m around 30-40% health I either dip my toe in a nuke zone or use a rad barrel. Rad barrel is the only way I know to get like exactly 19%
---
I joined in April so why not?
---
Something about changes never happening due to war or in war. Idk.
---
Gauss weapons are super weird and apparently the Wastelanders ones aren’t consistent, so I’m only going to talk about the weapons I know.
---
Gauss rifle does physical damage, but Grounded reduces it’s damage and it’s ammo is affected by Batteries Included.
---
Gauss Mini is the same afaik, although I haven’t confirmed if Grounded affects it.
---
I’d ASSUME the pistol and shotgun are the same, but I’ve heard that the shotgun is... special.
---
So they should fire all their customer service because they are doing their job, sounds logical, you sircareca genius.
---
I think it ends September when Update 22 releases
---
With 1 rank of butchers bounty I got from a perk pack, super duper3 and hard bargain I've been able to cook up enough meat to juice a vendor for all 1400 caps for the day without having to run uranium fever at all, that's been a nice change of pace, one upside.
---
Yeah, when people say they get lag bacause of the "Ash"- and meatpiles, its actually this. The Tesla gun is (also) the cause of the blocky graphics you can sometimes see in such areas, since it messes with the engine's [tile-based lighting](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/deferredshading-111121230216-phpapp02/95/deferred-shading-70-728.jpg?cb=1321917476) somehow.
---
I was not aware it's only the auto-mod causing this, I simply figured they broke it with the changes to with the Tesla in the last update.
---
If you can’t refund for the bunker get a refund for the other. Say you accidentally bought it because blah blah. They’ll ask you for the date of the purchase and what you bought.
---
Owning a bundle/atom item is like having a receipt. If you enter the store without one trying to get a refund they can’t help you.
---
This is the first time I’ve ever heard someone not owning an item after they bought something in the atom store while still losing atoms.
---
a similar effect can be found when using rev up weapons, and other charging weapons. like the Gauss Pistol and Gatling Laser. you can bash with the gun to stop any charge and spinup on the spot without having to put your gun away
---
"Toooooomorrow, Tomorrow, Todd'll love you, Tomorrow, You're oooonly a daaaay aaa-way!"
---
(I apologize for my musical outburst)
---
The one down by Watoga last night was showing 2 spawns by the abandoned train yard on the map. If you chased them down, you exit the event. WTF?
---
Also make sure you consider the weapon mods. Hardened receiver or Powerful Automatic, depending on build
---
Yeah but have you seen the mods? All 3 only add a seasoning shaker to the side of it. There's absolutely no reason why one of them should increase the weight to 27 pounds.
---
Your ARMAs and your Rising Storm games do really well with things like suppressing fire.
---
I'm really not sure
---
Yeah just reading though the posts September 1st seems to be the general consensus

---
There's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and junkies for big fights
---
T51b is the strongest pa outside of t65 or strangler heart (the difference really isn't much at all
---
Pa skins go on sale occasionally, but grind some nw out and you can get some cool free ones. There are also skins for the t51b (nuka cola) , xo1(nuka cola quantum) , and t60 (bos) in game you can get for free, or have some on paint it for you
---
Edit, you can get the crafting plans for the x01 after finishing the enclave quest line. And you get a full set of ultracite pa and the plans for it when you complete the brother hood quest line. All other pa plans (but t60) can be found commonly enough from the duped xmass presents.
---
Yeah, that's what I'm guessing
---
I shoot myself with a gamma gun. These guns are lightweight.
---
Yea it's worth it I stopped for a while and got back in just before wastelanders. Its a lot better now
---
It's bugged, it does say that you no longer auto cure diseases on the serum, but it doesn't work. It even said they fixed it to work in a patch a while back, but alas, still borked.
---
I see what you mean. But i don't think there is a big conspiracy going on tho. And don't sit there accusing me of doing stuff you have no idea about. I was looking to have a discussion. Dick
---
Yup. I find it super ironic that Wastelanders added a bunch of SPECIAL checks in dialog...
---
And broke one of the VERY few that existed in the base game.
---
Man if only the game actually just, worked, you know? Fancy that.  
---
Bethesda shills will just keep being apologists I guess.
---
I don’t have 1st, how do the tents work? Why wouldn’t you be able to place it?
---
Unfortunately, no
---
If they remove penalties there’s no reason to have it anymore. What they should do is double to spoilage time and make fridges keep them indefinitely.
---
Ugh. I haven’t modded one yet. Every single one I get is getting scripped until I get a decent one with RW.
---
You can?!  Where?  How?  You rock!
---
You can also get rad barrel plan from Radiation Rumble for your camp. 30 rads per use. In a pinch shoot or search the petrified corpses. They arent fast, but they produce rads.
---
It’s a constant issue for me, I can’t reload, sprint or use a Stimpak shortcut until I bash or holster my weapon. If it wasn’t for the high damage and freakish VATS accuracy I wouldn’t put up with it
---
Yeah everything else is good. Looks like a lot of other people have confirmed that it's designed in the event. Good to know, since I was just making a guess.
---
Exactly.
---
Don't confuse acting like an adult with being a Bethesda shill
---
This is actually nice to hear, as I've been getting blamed for making it fail because I camped across the pond from the site SE of top o the world. Not my fault!
---
I heard a group of tech stealing deserters is on its way. We are in Desperate times.
---
Wastelanders is an absolutely dramatic improvement in my opinion. I was the same as you and just game back after wastelanders. I went from level 1-60 when it released just to finish the story and what not. I’ve gone from 60 to 250 since wastelanders AND I made a new character who’s level 75. I enjoy the game much much more now.
---
That isn’t to say there are dramatically less bugs lol. There’s just more heart.
---
Exactly! Fast travel... What's that?
---
Logic is not your forté.
---
Read the OP. There is only one way to spend atoms in the game. The amounts deducted fit to what OP says, so they should have either refunded the atoms or given the set.
---
For crying out loud, they have access to the transaction history, and they can see that there was only a deduction of atoms and no item granted.
---
I've seen this a few times. It's like awesome..
---
No. I think it’s one person or a couple people. 
---
How about this. Why not use your brain and look at the whole picture and investigate yourself before jumping down on people for pointing out FACTS?
---
Use your brain.
---
It's worth it for at least a month. You can fill your scrap box with enough junk to fuel you for a long time.
---
Look on YouTube there are many Videos about it. Its a little bit complicated
---
 I use the salvaged assaultron head
---
It just works!
---
Because I joined late? I was finishing a primal cuts that  had started at the same time.  
---
I fast traveled to the vault and tried walking over there but it ended when i was halfway there.  
---
How about we stop defending the horrid UI?
---
Does it have unique rewards like SBQ has prime receivers and serums? Well serums are all SB.
---
Yes and no.
---
If you already own the game jump back in and enjoy the wadtelanders update.
---
Do not join back in if you want anything to do with the atomic shop or any events. Stuff is still broken as all hell.
---
You used more forceful language. People just don't like being pushed around.
---
Wait what is that? I was online during the reset in fact I finished the last goal literally 15sec before and I'm pretty sure I got it all.
---
T51B is a great starting PA for endgame. Once you get to know how things work, you can literally wear any PA you like (though I don't recommend Excavator for combat).
---
I wear T60 with BoS paints because I build and mod power armor. It's cheap to repair and still takes weeks before I have to worry about it  ... it's always the legs that get damaged fastest.
---
There are marginally better PAs available as you gain levels and complete the main storyline, like Ultracite and X01.
---
They are listed as meds.
---
I may have to go on a scrap grind
---
I've been wearing the Chally mask and pink pant suit. Business Chally.
---
I use ionized meat, really filling.
---
All depends on how you play, the stash box and camp were worth it alone for me. The atoms each month were a nice bonus.
---
Yeah, they never explained why this one of all events has to have a respawn timer that goes up to a full minute, despite the problems with being dead when Earle dies.
---
It's been reported countless times in the PTS and we've tried to ask if the 60 seconds cooldown was intended or a bug, and we've never received any answer. They still shipped the event bugged, and even made livestreams of it with the bug at the Quakecon panel with the devs playing and LadyDevann recording.
---
 It's really absurd the lenghts Bethesda will go to just not communicate with the community.
---
While I fully agree bethesdas social media team out hard for anyone critical of bethesda recently so you will be downvoted super hard. Their UI should work. It doesnt. You have a valid complaint. 
---
The fix is simple layering and could probably be done "easily". I don't know bethesdas programming but I did go to school for computers...so I have some experience.
---
Not arguing whether its a horrible UI or not
---
But if you know you have an issue, you should take steps to mitigate it
---
Thanks for making my fam look at me weird for laughing out of the blue...
---
I want this too!
---
Bloodied power armor makes this event a cake walk if you're willing to buy a bloodied heavy Gatling laser. Same for daily ops on the PTS, so it might be a good idea to get an off kit ready for those since stealth doesn't work in them.
---
Man dude guy, I know the feeling.
---
I’m only doing the event for the xp
---
I’ll have to try that.
---
I've always seen it as the fundamental failure of this game, but not in the way you think.
---
This is a collecting game, like many others.  However, it fails critically on one very important bit: creation.
---
You can't really do much with the things you collect.  Resources are limitless, but your ability to use them is miniscule.  It's disproportionate, and as I view it, this is shortsightedness by the developing leads.  It was also a strange lack of awareness of two other elements: the huge popularity of world building in FO4 and the pre-existing and very popular and heavily used mod community.  Has anyone not played any other FO game without 100 mods running?
---
So what happened?  FO76 transitioned from single player to multiplayer with the addition of multiple game worlds (multiverse?) and group play.  It kept the building mechanics from FO4.  It added more resource gathering and crafting.  It specifically built a story around rebuilding the world.  Then, it didn't do anything with any of it.  You have some light survival elements and more crafting.  There were better options in mods previously.  You have some light world building, but none of it is persistent or meaningful and tied to your local camp only.  Worse yet, you don't matter in the world, at all.  In FO4, you built up the world, created settlements, trading, and evolved the region.  In FO76, you don't.  You get less.  Bethesda started with vastly more opportunity and gave the player less to do and less importance in what they do.
---
The greatest tragedy of FO76 is the lack of use of persistence, lack of being able to build anywhere, and not taking advantage of the multiverse that was available.  We could have reclaimed the wasteland, built settlements, built cities.  We could have unique servers each representing a tangent universe path, each a unique world and life.  With work on social elements, this could have become quite a bit of a city builder with shops, trade, factions, and economy.  With work on player versus environment, they could have developed creep spawns, creep encampments, creep agro systems based on player actions, again faction systems and trading systems, as well as small fight events and large scale world map battle events.  They could have embraced the multiverse element and even created means to travel and trade in-game between servers, a bit Rick and Morty esque.  They could have given players Fallout Minecraft or Fallout Terria or Fallout Warcraft, all extremely popular, long lasting franchises, and they are this way specifically because they embraced both social and world elements and understood the mechanics and people well.
---
The sad part in all of this is Bethesda leadership in this game didn't really see the potential in any of this, and the focus was on fast money and predatory income.  That was the knee-jerk reaction both at Beta and with the addition of game modes, even manipulation of the Atom shop.  It's all fast cash stuff.  It's immature from a business perspective.  But, they were sitting on a goldmine and never knew it.  You look at games like LOL raked in 1.5 BILLION dollars last year literally on skins and hero purchases.  The Fallout franchise is far bigger and more diverse.  All they ever had to do in order to make money hand over fist was make a simple world builder and then just make items and skins for that world (armor, weapons, building parts and skins, holiday stuff, and some new items and kits here and there).  That's it.  Let people go into the world and create.  Support them with some solid social and environment mechanics.  Then just sit back and watch the sales.  And this could have lasted for a decade easy.  FO76 could have been a 10 BILLION revenue game, easy, instead of just $150 million from sales and whatever the atom shop trickles in.
---
All this falls back to what FO76 actually is.  It's now a decent story game (especially with settlers), has some okish minigames/events, and is otherwise a resource gathering game with nowhere to really put resources.  It's not a building game.  You're not really reclaiming the wasteland.  Worse, what you do in the world doesn't persist, and you effectively mean nothing within that space.  In many ways, FO4 was better in many regards, and the mod community lets you really shape it to something greater...or weirder.  I keep looking back and asking what did FO76 really give me over the predecessor?  The only thing I've ever really considered better was the map.  The developers working on the landscape did an outstanding job, and that's a big jump from previous games in look and feel of the space, and the real world elements shared makes it feel more real.  But the rest...the rest didn't really do much of anything.  Many elements went backwards.  And the unique components of online, multiplayer play were not really utilized to any appreciable way.  And then you step back to resource gathering and the grind.  Time and time again, you just drop huge piles of stuff on the ground and let it disappear into oblivion because there's nothing to do with it.  I've even started new builds where I specifically don't pick up 90% of the resources because I can't make use of them and am trying to play lean and with an as-needed approach.  Even then, it's a game of just tossing piles and piles of things on the ground.  That feels so stupid.
---
I said don’t drop the nuke over the center of the mine-it activates like the queen. Then all I had to deal with was dOnT tElL mE wHaT tO dO wItH mY nUkE
---
Same reason your camp couldn’t be placed; someone or something is in the way of it loading in.
---
I dont spend much time at my C.a.m.p. I'm always doing raider shit in the liberty prime armor. I might get it for the scrap box
---
I haven't been able to complete it at any location today tried twice at each
---
Weapons are a different category, at max it is only 9% to get something at all from it and 2% to get that plan.
---
It already is better.....
---
Not all supporters have a sticker thing.
---
Ah yes, such an adult not caring when the game you paid 60 dollars for doesn't work.
---
Serum recipies modus vendor...21000 caps. Do they also drop from SBQ?? Never gotten one there.
---
I planned on playing public once I hit 50 and get more of the map and stuff unlocked. I am still having a ton of fun playing solo atm just discovering stuff. Thanks for the tips.
---
It really is crazy how fast this event is over with 6 people at the spits and drums from the start, anyone who wants to go afk should be encouraged to jump on a station, it’s a major contribution to this event.
---
No it's not.
---
We must stand together, support our fellow members and we will prevail. Worry not
---
Toxic water or toxic goo
---
Cool down timer has always been a max of 60 seconds for constantly dying at a event.
---
Warning: egroegy is launching a nuke!
---
"Please check your area"
---
BoS- "fuuuuuuck"
---
You can place one by clicking on your name and clicking the add flair option member
---
If I'm understanding you right, you're saying have like a 200 lb limit strictly for the vendors only? I'd think that would be an ok compromise instead of an increase in stash limit. Although, everyone would still rather just have the stash raised. Plus, I'm guessing implementing that would be easier said than done. Nonetheless, I don't hate your idea. 👍
---
That's the thing I don't want to readjust my bloody Gauss pistol build with secret service armor. It's too fun for me.
---
If you're on PC and it can handle two games running at once then a second account is better value since you can then vendor hop rare outfits solo, get double rewards from meat week/faschnact and enough space for a lot of scrap.
---
It's a hoax.  People seem to think the bug happens if you're on during the reset.  There's no precedent for this.
---
Happens to me as well. You can either holster/redraw the weapon, or do a quick bash. Either seems to reset it.
---
Thank you good sir
---
Oh man that’s like my favorite gun
---
Oh I thought you could just put them anywhere haha
---
Nice try, only LittleWhiteClocks would do this type of thing.
---
Rose is the best. I want more.
---
No they didn't tenderizer 2% and outfit 9% at full bar.
---
Every other event maxes at 20 seconds.
---
I know. Certain events it's asinine though. Events that have high probability of frame drops/lag punish the player without it being their fault entirely
---
Not that I know of.
---
I’m ditching my bloody builds. Die too easily, do most damage to the bosses and end up with the same one star lead pipe evey single time, really not worth it especially with all the respawn bugs and loss of fluxes after SBQ. Now they’re nerfing it so what’s the point. I’ll play full health for a bit and if ammo crafting becomes a boring grind I’ll just move to other games. Really stupid of them to think they can keep people play longer by blanket nerfing everything.
---
Now it's in my head all day. Thanks!  ;)
---
It already is higher damage unless you have something with a low ammo capacity. Most weapons don't benefit enough from running demo expert for it to be worth the points so fire rate is usually better.
---
What a beautiful sight, good luck to you in the wastes
---
Well, that's a bit unfortunate now that I sank all this time into the character with the idea of it being a part of his theme.
---
Thanks for lettin' me know.
---
Yeah before the vendor had them the queen would drop them at a really low rate and regular ones did to but lower even so. Back when they made it so the vendors had everything is when they were added in to venders.
---
I’ve got all three after doing 4 or 5 events and than the taro salad recipe so yes but then it started only being bloody chefs hats
---
And they wonder why the PvP community doesn't like it.
---
I've had random dead enemies fall out of the sky for a few weeks. I feel like I'm back in Skyrim!
---
Introducing Fallout Second, unlimited weapons and armor Storage with the Weapon Box.
---
^(I'm just kidding but people would probably subscribe to it)
---
I wouldn't say not to increase the stash limit as well, I was just concerned with balancing the vendor stash.
---
I haven't upgraded my PC to run any games since 2016 I just gave up and got a console
---
It really doesn't matter what pa you use because of the 42% damage reduction, which is why excavator is best.
---
I start on drums then after it procs 2 or 3 times I jump off and turn in my meat and chally feed.. 
---
after I tunr in my initial offerings I will grab whatever greens are left around.. add some wood to the fire, clean up any chally poop or rotting leftovers I see 
---
Ill jump on a spit or drum to close things out since its usually close by that time.. or ill go after critters if its not
---
in general I spend more time jumping around preening in my cosmetics [waiting for the event to start] than actually doing the event most of the time
---
Yeah by a big amount at the early stage of the game
---
Don't confuse not working with not working the way you want it to.
---
They don't drop anymore. It's been like over an year since they stopped dropping
---
Not happening
---
I'll believe this when I see it.
---
Valseek is just the middleman whom the devs have chose too many times to ignore.
---
Then the back should say "please show mercy and kill me"
---
Salt
---
Just try not dying then 😉
---
# F
---
Adds burning damage to those wounds
---
PC, but thAnks for the offer!
---
I hardly die with my bloody melee. That sucks for you :( sorry to hear that
---
Not in my experience at least - previously I could oneshot most things below a mirelurk king (so good for scorched and ghouls) now it takes 3-4 shots for a lv 68 ghoul at whitespring.
---
Almost seems like there's a group of people out there who just have an axe to grind with beth and just make shit up about the game to make them look bad. Granted there may be bugs that they've since fixed but I've seen videos of fo76 "bugs" that I've never ever experienced and really seem like someone made themselves. What is that motivation. 
---
 I literally watched my score goals reset one by one and there was no issue.
---
As you please, you're the one paying for repairs. 
---
*jetpacks away to polish his collection of every PA available in game*
---
Make easy to complete the daily tomorrow.
---
Why tho? I don't wanna be a troll lol
---
They are doing a job, just like you most likely do just like I do and so many others, just because he did not get the desired results, which it sucks his atoms werent refunded, but customer service can only do what is within their abilities, should you or I or anyone else lose their jobs because they are doing what the company tells them, no, it sucks his atoms were not refunded but it does not mean customer service is to blame, they can only do what is within their abilities, and like op stated I they could not go over the transactions due to it being a privacy issue, there is a thing called pci in customer service that prevents private info being provided.
---
I await the Brotherhood with a full complement of supplies, guns, ammo and Power Armor. Not for them to use of course..
---
Awesome, now to hunt down empath serum :)
---
Yeah just found that out sucks to cuz I haven’t bought any thinking they were still in the queen drops to would have been nice to keep it that way
---
I decided to give it a shot during a free weekend in May and have been hooked ever since. A little buggy like all bethesda games are but a fun time.
---
Sorry can't help you. Ps4
---
Because collecting enough ore gives you more rewards, and a better chance at rare rewards the the Emmett Mountain hazmat suit and the rad barrel plan
---
This one exists, but people seem hellbent on finding a specific reason where none seemingly exist.
---
Sad how many people think they’re actually in the enclave and modus isn’t just using them
---
Me and several of my friends had this happen because we logged in during or near the reset of the daily and/or weekly challenges resetting.
---
We have all been giving an hour buffer between when we log out/in and when the challenges reset (so normally 11am-1pm) since that happened.
---
We have not had SCORE challenges auto complete since we started doing this.
---
Are you perhaps salty about the weight increase?
---
A salt shaker doesn't weigh 11 pounds.
---
Not even close to all those loot and xp from enemies you kill if you don't collect those ores
---
The scrap box is amazing, since i got it i just pick up junk like a madman, filling up the box.
---
I had over 700 weight in junk and that problem is gone finally. The survival tent is really useful.
---
The extra atoms are nice and being able to play in private worlds is really nice too.
---
No more missing out on legendary enemies bc one shotting players.
---
EDIT: for me its 17.90 so that is a lot. Pretty expensive for a month.
---
i ask a genuine question and get no response i instead get dislikes what is wrong with you people
---
Actually the sbq is.  But I never have to repair it anyway, it's so durable.
---
Says you. I can make salt weight anything I want as long I have enough.
---
I'm sure someone who uses melee will be.
---
the amassed salt from everyone mad about the dmg update
---
That's so anecdotal.  Painfully anecdotal.
---
PbCl2
---
I'm usually 500 over encumbered for that event when I'm gathering ore. If you don't get 40 don't bother because that won't incentivise people to try.
---
you use perks for what you have issues with. have issues with inventory? use hoarder perks. issues with hoarding and damage? bruh you're doing something wrong with your build XD
---
I'm probably gonna get it, for the atoms and scrap box. I like playing with other people
---
There's not enough space inside that salt shaker to fill it with 11 pounds worth of salt though.
---
I have 100 38. in my vendor for this. When you buy from someone like this you complete their daily as well. Handy.
---
Advanced alien compression. Grahm gets his stuff from everywhere.
---
so do i, i only do maybe 3 hours in the game per day
---
I run two accounts simultaneously. One only plays drums because old OG Xbox One can’t handle *anything* else.
---
Don’t judge me too harshly, I’ve only been playing a month and I just got informed my build is trash a few days ago and we’re working on fixing it, but unfortunately I was super close to lvl 50 already when we realized it. We’ve still got 20 or so levels to go on fixing it. I was struggling to kill anything prior.
---
You can have up to 8 players in private worlds, perfect for twaming up with friends.
---
MODUS is a tool.....and tools are meant to be used.
---
Cause in NW, anyone can get the gauss shotgun if he's lucky. In adventure mode tho, pvpers are the only one rocking good weapons and armors. They want situations to remain in their favor so they trash NW and praise adventure/survival mode pvp
---
Use last laugh
---
That's a good answer. I'll just assume that's what they were intending, even though I doubt it is lol.
---
If nobody complains, Bethesda won't treat it as a priority.  Why do people feel the need to comment on the comments?
---
Why can't 1 * drop 1*?  2* drop 2*?  3* drop 3*?  I'm tired of busting ass to kill a 3* and I get a 1* item!
---
Scorched earth is 60 last I remembered an that was Dec 2019 when I died that much to get it above 30 seconds.
---
I'd love to see some support from President Eden! These betrayers with stolen army equipment are on their way to seize all the government installations. We wont let that happen!
---
Fallout 76: Sorry, I can't play till the Vendor/Legendary cash resets.
---
Yes it will still be the best
---
I’m pretty sure they’re saying they’re not getting loot *at workshops*. Your camp at whitesprings isn’t a workshop.
---
I'm 98 and a half right now. 
---
I've done every challenge except two NW challenges.
---
Yeah! Super excited to try it out. Sucks PC got it first. Console hopefully soon.
---
I mean once you get out of the event.... Just fast travel. Just be happy someone spawned the event. Or wear your Chinese stealth armor or a rad suit walking out. Really not a big deal.
---
Yup. You are right. I miss read that thanks for the clarification.
---
But it was OP's own info..? And it just seems like customer service didn't get what OP was saying, not that it was outside of their abilities to fix.
---
As far as I understood the mutation it was the stacking poison cloud based on however many diseases you had, and the downside was having to deal with those diseases penalties (parasites and dysentery, ugh) but you'd still recover normally. Kinda like you being a carrier until you recover. I've run plague walker for gods know how long, and I've always had the recovery time end the disease
---
This is my experience, too.
---
Probably why we can't pick up and place physics objects any more. If you go into Fallout 4 and spam the Striker sufficiently enough(to the tune of ~200 bowling balls) you can force the game to crash 100% consistently. Likely what's happening here, just too many 100s of physics objects overloading what is basically Fallout 4 multiplayer.
---
Why not use the existing interface to fast travel to them?
---
Do note that I'm giving constructive criticism, not trying to bring you down.
---
Your title:
---
 &gt;"PLEASE NOTE: do NOT drop the nuke directly over the mine."
---
is unnecessarily passive-aggressive. The word "please" just doesn't appear genuinely polite to the reader when you type in caps. 
---
And yet, your post was still upvoted by the majority. You only got a single response saying "don't tell me how to play" and you replied with "You never responded to my dm about those trade offers." Again, passive-aggressive.
---
It’s a thing that started happening with Wastelanders. If you kill an enemy and and don’t loot them then come back later, their items from their inventory will be on the ground as world items. As for it being a bug or a feature, I can’t say... But I always liked it.
---
I always thought it was neat when it happened, it was cool to see how the glow maps change between world models and the pip boy menu. Like glowing meat, looks like normal meat in the pop boy, in the world though it’s really glowing.
---
Although, this same thing is happening during primal cuts, players are killing the hundreds of creatures during these events and not bothering to loot every animal, so in turn when they come back to do the event an hour from now all the items are on the ground from all those mobs, which is lagging the servers quite a bit. 
---
(I hope Bethesda doesn’t patch this neat little feature out because of meat week, I always thought it was cool. Plus I’ve even found a few legendary weapons and armor laying on the ground at the primal cuts sites. Nothing super amazing but still neat none the less.)
---
Once a fallout first always a fallout first.
---
That stash box makes you dependent on it like drugs. Don’t get tempted.
---
That’s what he wants you to think
---
No, they're not. You can see in the screenshot I included that my camp has 52 miscellaneous items listed for sale; these are serums.
---
Yeah ikr it's so annoying and it only happens during events for me,
---
I completed it a week ago without using atoms. I really enjoy grinding as well, and this grind was fun thanks to the rewards.
---
I'm happy to have a break from it though before the next. I can't imagine many would want to go from one grind to the next so quickly, but many will have to if they don't complete early. Bethesda needs to plan a cool down period between the seasons to give people a chance to do other stuff. A lot of other things get neglected during the grind. I've used this "downtime" to move my camp and finish up a bunch of side quests and other world challenges while I wait for season 2.
---
What I don't understand is why Bethesda keeps the SCORE challenges for people who finish season 1 early. If their whole business model is to keep people logging in daily and staying logged in, I have almost no incentive to login between now and season 2 beyond my scrip and gold daily quests.
---
All they'd have to do is convert that repeatable weekly to give me atoms (even 5 per would be worth it) or caps and I'd still be into grinding a little while I wait for season 2.
---
I don't understand their decisions most of the time, but this seems like a slam dunk. Why would they want all the most hardcore grinders to stop their grind once they finish a season early? I swear nobody over there understands their community and/or the different player types in their game.
---
it can be hard to tell broken dumb shit from ironic commentary dumb shit in a Bethesda game but I do like it
---
How good is the tenderizer compared to a supersledge anyways?
---
I was going to say this if no one else did. Bravo!
---
Literally this.  Couldn't join colossus event either because of this.
---
Seeing as junk consistently takes up most of my stash space, I dont even feel like this is exaggerating
---
I've had this same thought.  Apparently the fertilizer grenades count as weapons also.  It's disappointing to think you have tons of weapons to choose from and find out it's a lvl 20 pipe with a ton of fertilizer.
---
When I look at the numbers for crafting a level 50 of each the Super Sledge is 390 damage and the Tenderizer is 344.
---
I was on for the reset on two different accounts.  One got the bug (still needed score) the other didn't (completed it weeks ago).  There are more factors.  This might or might not be one, but you can't take one effect and assign any cause you want to it.
---
Gauss weapons although are classified as energy weapons, they fire ballistic rounds. This is why you can get Gauss weapons with the explosive legendary effect. I have a Gauss rifle with the explosive effect that I received about a month ago from a legendary drop. 
---
  The weapon uses electro-magnetic fields to accelerate the ballistic rounds. This is why, all Gauss weapons, are classified as energy. The ballistic 2mm EM rounds are the reason these weapons may have the explosive effect. Also, Gauss weapons naturally have explosive rounds, so this effect stacks nicely with the legendary effect.
---
Dang and I am still grinding for the plans. Just because lol.
---
Yesss! My friend has it and uses it all of the time haha! Any alcohol!
---
Indeed it is. However I've heard this from many different sources and players.
---
Precedent is made up of many anecdotal occurrences revealing a pattern or repeatable process.
---
At the very least, what we have done has kept all of the people I play with from losing SCORE after the first occurrence. We all adhere to this and all have not had SCORE challenges auto complete since.
---
We all also don't play any NW.
---
No, it's class freak, but both are good.
---
Psa you can play the drums and turn the spit during the 2 minutes of the start up and it does count towards the event. 6 people doing so will make the first award before the event actually starts.
---
I'm *hoping* that this is an attempt to simplify the damage equations.  There are so many bugs in the game, more bugs that not really, that affect our damage.  I welcome any change that makes it easier on hamster coders they hire.  This would naturally be followed by a rebalance of weapons, but I think we all know that won't happen for months, if at all.  I've played on the PTS and I don't think it's bad, but I don't play stealth melee.
---
Choosing between the Enclave and the Brotherhood is like choosing between two different flavors of shit.
---
The raider events are mostly in the savage divide. Uranium fever is in the Blackwater bandit hideout, distinguished guests at the gourmands, one violent night is considered a raider event, despite the sons of dane being a small outfit.
---
As for new content, I'd love to have roadblock robberies for raiders, or backing up the settlers (either option for rep with faction) if we're going sickly sweet, have a quest from grahm to gather flowers for Gail. 
---
Me personally, I want ghoul content. Let us turn the burrows and the mire into ghoul territory, they're the most likely to have leftover old world resentment and side with the free states movement (despite the actions of some grief stricken members) 
---
White spring needs a makeover too. Modus should take the presence of multiple hostile powers (brotherhood returning, raiders returning, settlers that don't recognize the US government) as reason to secure the perimeter. Make white spring hostile territory and move the player shopping hub to top of the world in the mezzanine..
---
Just my rambling ideas
---
Its CsCl, still a salt and weighs ~3x as much

He peppers rants all around

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
If your dying too much then it’s you. Use food that increases max hp or other external factors. 
---
Increasing timer when dying is a form of punishment to make you use your brain. Zerg rushing your problems won’t make problems go away.
---
I never have a problem dying and I’m a bloodied build with 450 max hp.
---
I was in an event with 6/6 occupied to start and we were about 80% complete at start.

It says they do not cure themselves.
---
If your selling them for 500 or more you won't get many sales. There's 2 types of buyers:
---
* people who just hit level 40ish and want them now that they have starched genes. More often than not they're not loaded with caps, but they might buy 1 or 2 at 500.
---
* people that buy them and flip them at the vendor bots for easy profit. The most you can get from the robots is 500/ea,so unless you give them some room to profit they won't buy.
---
The sweet spot seems to be around 250-300.
---
Okay, well I do play NW and play during roll over.  I also haven't had any problems.  But I do refrain from petting my cat.  Correlation doesn't equal causation.
---
I think there are visual bugs at play here. I have bought serums from players with no miscellaneous items listed. They did have meds listed. In fact, I have been using the med listing to find serums for friends and it has been quite accurate. This is weird.
---
Would be Nice but i dont think bethesda can change it just like that IF its not for all People at The same time. Even if they could i fear it would break something.
---
😂 “That doesn’t make sense”.
---
Yeah me to, two accounts, one bangs the drums the other works. It's funny how people get upset with my character as she is banging drums, the amount of people who come up and use explosive guns on the drum while they standing next to the drum and then killing themselves has been hilarious.
---
it happens everywhere for me
---
thanks for the fix
---
even though it don't save it works &lt;3
---
They're treating them like that because the cards are hardly spectacular, even the SPECIAL cards are only as good as the normal cards you slot in with them
---
Honey and basically everything you make with it is really useful and works regardless of being an Herbivore or Carnivore. I think the quest is more less to keep you stocked up on honey since it's so practically useful in this game.
---
I play on PS4, if that matters.
---
There may be multiple factors that effect it. But every occurrence of challenges auto completing on my account or people I play with happened when they logged in at or  around when the daily and/or weekly challenges reset.
---
We never login now around the reset and have not seen the issue since the first couple weeks.
---
Not saying it's the only cause, there may be other factors that influence it, but avoiding playing for the hour on each side of the reset has allowed everyone I play with to avoid losing any more SCORE since the beginning of the season.
---
Lol nah, I started pvping with a simple tse handmade and no legendary heavy combat armor. Most ppl don't like iy bc it's ass, if I wanted to play a battle Royale I'd play one that gets more than 30fps
---
It’s true there is clearly a problem, but nerfing is not the answer and never is. There are always people who defend character or damage nerfs in every mmo as a great good for the “over easy” end game or something that’s out of balance. It means you see the problem, but agreeing with the nerf means you agree with them taking the laziest approach to fix it.
---
Nerfing is a knee jerk reaction to quickly fix balance. However, the  problem isn’t our gun damage, the problem is the content and how non-challenging the content is overall. There is very little that mentally challenges or tests your skills in this game at all. 
---
“End game” boss fights should not be this dumbed down, it feels like just another mob who is  more bullet spongey. This new Colossus does add some mechanics that make you become aware of your surroundings, like the falling debris and the floor if wendigos and such (which is a better direction, but there are still issues with that boss fight mechanics that need tons of work to be on point.)
---
Good mmos use interesting fight mechanics to add challenge, not nerf your weapons or make the bosses feel even more like damage sponges. Turning a boring 2 minute fight into a boring 10-15 minute fight is not interesting or challenging, it’s just tedious busy work.
---
The same could go for trash mobs. About the only mobs that really “surprise” me in anyway in fo76 are those zombies that sprint at high speed around corners at you. Think about mob mechanics in games like Dark Souls. Each one has a little pattern to learn, it makes you learn to move around more cautiously and always on guard and it makes the overall game much more challenging during engaging.
---
Then if you add lots of harder combat mechanics to the game, which makes all fights longer and harder, the rewards need to go up since you will kill way less.  Harder the fights the better the rewards...I’m sure them nerfing weapon damage will be making boss fights last way longer, I hope they address the reward pool and give us more for our invested ammo and time.
---
Nerfing weapon damage is the laziest way at attempting to wash your hands of your balance mistakes in a game. It’s basic common denominator knee jerk reaction to people plowing through mobs and bosses to easy.
---
I have not seen that. But I love the jerks who use explody guns on the critters scattering them to the four ends. Like use a knife WTF.
---
That's what we want outsiders to think.
---
With all of the exp buffs it's entirely possibly to get nearly 400%, not including double XP weekend.
---
This. Event icons get larger as you zoom, player dots do not.
---
Blue cheese or ranch?
---
They're pretty rare. You can server hop since he's staying in one place all week.
---
The new melee weapons that’s coming in the daily ops would probably make it even more obsolete.
---
" The idea is that if this game is to last long term; the developers have planned for this in advance, and that with the resources available at the time combined with the knowledge of potential flaws, to leave room &amp; time to play out. "
---
From what I have seen so far, over the last two years, you would have difficulty convincing me that the developers had a plan for lunch, much less that they have a long term plan for this game.
---
While it sounds awesome, and it does dont get me wrong. But its too niche of a item to spend development time on right now. 
---
The amount of rivers or cliffs wide enough to make use of a drawbridge is too small, and the camp size would mean that any decent drawbridge would take up about half of it.
---
lol yeah noticed that as well. Next time I will take a video of them killing themselves, I just chuckle, of course they don't come back because they embarrassed .. others throw up, it's funny what people get upset over. No need really if there are lots of players, only so many things you can kill and pick up anyway
---
I’ve bought the plan of him
---
Use a private server.
---
Neither.
---
People who does this fucking suck. Stop doing it.
---
I love going for the ore. And maybe it is just confirmation bias, but I think there are more legendary ennemies with non-ghouls mobs.
---
My life is but fuel to continue the Righteous vision of the Enclave, MODUS may be in charge now but the food chain continues above
---
There are lots of post about how buggy it is and how it has been delayed to next week.
---
So they do show up in his cookout inventory? I’m just at the mercy of RNJesus? Thank you I’ll check out different servers
---
Member, the BoS litters Appalachia with their corpses already, whatever is on the way here is of no consequence to us.
---
I dont have PSN so i cant do it at all so far.
---
Good good, I was thinking I was kinda screwed, thank you I’ll server hop for a bit
---
*it's
---
For me it's usually after I kill the final wave, giant creature and all. But nothing happens afterwards.
---
Are you on console?
---
Stand in water and drink/collect it.
---
Shooting a gamma gun at the ground is the easiest way in my opinion. Or just dirty water.
---
It's not out on console yet.
---
Well I guess we should just both keep our mouths shut and not discuss our experiences unless we have definitive scientifically backed, peer reviewed  proof of something based on direct knowledge of the code and inner workings of the back end systems at play here.
---
I'm sure a lot will get done in the community with regards to fixing this issue or avoiding it by doing that. 😂
---
Or we could, you know, swap stories and situations on an internet forum and try to figure out a way to work around a broken system together.
---
Have a nice day. 💛
---
The talk was that you would get bonuses instead of penalties.
---
I can’t imaging getting mad at someone keeping the meter running on an event. 
---
*Drummers are a necessary evil.*
---
This totally defines my character and I just have a month playing this fallout. I have almost all the perks to reduce chems, ammo, armor, heavy weapons, grenades, science weapons, food and junk weight plus some of my armor reduce weapons, junk and ammo by another 20%, have the tadpole backpack and atm I have 347/350 pounds and my stash is completely full. Can't sell legendary weapons because I hit the 1000 scripts limit a while ago and can't buy more because I can't store them. 
---
Now I can see why there's so much people paying for fallout shit-first (and that's only for unlimited junk), but I don't want to pay $100 a year for something that should've been included in the game since day 1, or at least since Wastelanders. 
---
We need more space in stash and camp budget!
---
The Enclave is the Equivalent of Monolith in STALKER. Brain dead Zealots being manipulated by an inanimate object, scared of change and anything different than them.
---
The event has been around long enough where a lot of people already have the rare rewards...so they're just doing the event to farm XP and maybe some legendaries.
---
Never, it is unacceptable to have these important installations to go into strange hands.
---
Kinda. Watch angry turtles videos on stealth.
---
I just finished doing it and only one other player showed up.  I had to really push Earl since we only had two participants, so I ended up dying more than usual.  Probably 4-5 times.  We killed him with plenty of time to spare, but the damn respawn timer kept getting longer and longer.  The last death I think I had to wait like 45 seconds to respawn.  Stupid.
---
The "4 star machete" has already been patched out, until they actually increase the legendary star limits. It was achieved by using a machete, a Chinese officers sword, and one or two others, with 3 legendary prefixes, and adding the top mods to them (sacrificial blade, serrated electrified, etc) would add that 4th star. 
---
Then there's the pc weapon issues, like the hacked weapons, that are a while other ball of wax
---
Will do thanks!
---
Yao guai party!   I guess they didnt get the memo on social distancing.
---
I’m having this exact experience
---
And the raiders are lawless barbarians bred from chem fueled bloodlusts. Disorganized, and only prepared to rot away like the junkies they are.
---
Thanks a lot man, Yes im on ps4 and I should have known this. I feel like a dummy now.
---
Yeah we've been suggesting that since the beginning....shows how much they listen lol.
---
Does anyone know the math? I started late so I'm only at 52 and want to know if I can make the end. I want that PA dark variant.
---
In another post from this morning someone said they got them yesterday. So he should have them at some point if you’re lucky.
---
97 1/2 right now, can’t do dailies till I get home around 8 but definitely shouldn’t be much longer till I’m done.
---
The Enclave has seen fit to outfit me with the top of the line energy technology, this... Brotherhood... Will not stand a chance
---
No, class freak lowers the negative effects of the mutation. Strange in Numbers with other mutated members in the party is what severely buffs it. But your right, I definitely should have mentioned class freak 😉
---
im such an idiot. Thanks man.
---
Yeah it's ass but they stick to it only because they are winning so there's that
---
No worries....I just want my SS mods.
---
I appreciate that, I could never find the time to catch him on the road anytime soon from how much I work
---
Let's give them double score but don't fix the auto complete bug...just leave that be lol.
---
i also bought them yesterday. Seen them twice in like 20 cookouts.
---
I prefer anti armor myself when not junkie or bloodied. Add faster swing and bingo, crushed enemies.
---
How do you edit existing wires?
---
Yet Raiders outlive the Enclave in canon... weird how life turns out
---
Yep, level 50, was surprised too.
---
Came across level 100 mole miners as well..
---
That'd be cool, I'd love that man
---
Two weeks from now you can get it in the Atomic Shop for only 20000 atoms! What an  amazing deal!
---
People on your server must have loled their asses off
---
As per angry turtle's video, strange in numbers doesn't work in this circumstance.
---
He had 2 of those plans this morning so I bought them. Just keep looking :)
---
I wish they would bring this back as well as the aim around the corner mechanic.
---
Hopefully with some server hoping you should be able to find them easier. Good luck.
---
I’m so relieved to hear they show up, I just need to get the caps together again for them, how much were they?
---
As a hoarder... how the hell do you carry anything?!
---
The game has been teaching me to not hoard, but I still end up doing it while asking myself constantly "Why did I pick that up?".
---
Anything that major and it'd just be a laundry list of people who bot their accounts or something stupid in order to keep their active hours going non-stop for months on end until they got the achievement, unfortunately.
---
Then we'd have a world full of statues and lore of shitty people.
---
You can place them in a lot of areas. What I mean is that if the last place you dropped it is occupied, it won’t load, just like a camp.
---
I have noticed animals spawning underground. This is a problem with defending workshops as well.
---
Yes because the raiders are not one faction, you are cells, disorganized only clinging to life based on others success. Worse than the Legion of the Mojave, you have no kinship but with your small groups
---
I’ll definitely stick it out then. Thank you, take care!
---
These are builds optimised for their purposes, weight reduction perks have to go. 800lbs in my stash and 450lbs on me is more than adequate for my hoarding. I also had three more characters designed to carry everything but junk. That’s what the Scrapbox is for.
---
I couldn't even kill him, he just went down and stayed down.
---
I understand what you're saying, but hearsay and needless conjecture really don't help.
---
Yeah that's how mmo PvP works, whoever works the hardest to get gear wins. Also if u r ever interested in PvP them don't go to the people who set up events at wss, they aren't a good starting point. Just start pvping at workshops, it's much less cheesey
---
Not if you're using animals!
---
pretty sure they were cheap. I'd like to say they were like 280 or something. but i could be wrong. 
---
are you on xbone?
---
Yeah I am, GT is the same as my name on Reddit
---
Stings the nostrils
---
No I didn’t know that yet I haven’t played in almost 6 months haven’t kept up with the news but thanks for the update
---
The salt doesn't weigh 11 pounds, the tungsten carbide salt shaker does.
---
IF you have an extra hundred bucks I think the year sub could be worth it.  You'll get atoms each month, cosmetics, the super useful scrap box and tent... Plus if you have alts you can use the private server to transfer loot between them.  I kind of got it on a whim and I'm pleased enough, infinite junk storage is great.
---
Hey remember when some disorganized tribals nuked your oil rig and brought you to your knees?
---
That was pretty cool
---
Legendary Perks are aimed at players who already has all the perk cards they want unlocked. You're not "missing out" on anything by keeping the cards you want as there is no cap on levels, and they are implementing more and more ways to get more exp. You even get level 1 of the Legendary Perks without scrapping anything. I tested the PTS for the first time today and managed to max out two +5 special point Perks which made me able to sneak in an additional sneak build with close to +15 in STR, PER, AGI and LCK. I'm hyped and can't wait for release
---
🤷🏻‍♀️ I didn’t know ? Just came back after not playing after awhile I did not keep up with the news about it.
---
Romance options with Rose pls
---
i'll give you the plan. GT: rammadeus. i'll inv you.
---
I don't mind wss. I used to pvp religiously back in the day. Kinda lost interest after finding out most of my buddies were using aimbots and my opponents were doing that too. But completely gave up after they started duping hacked weapons. Hached weapons+ aimbots is a literal nuke drop. No such thing as working hard. It's all about who cheats the most period.
---
No problem, the patch that should include them is aimed for mid september at the moment
---
Awesome 👌
---
My favorite is where the final spawn of the final wave doesn't show up, and the event fails. THEN, within seconds, suddenly the last few creatures stumble into view.
---
You’re a saint. Thank you so much. I’ll be on in a sec.
---
I say this every time I see this post. Play that event based on your own motivations. Don't expect others to play it for yours. If you're there for xp get xp. If you want drops do the ore. This way you're doing the event for what makes you happy. Three people can make this event a success. You only need 75 ore and one survivor to get the max benefits of the event.
---
We have safe's as stash boxes, they should re-purpose them as a an actual safe to store caps. But having said that, you could store thousands of caps &amp; someone comes to pick the lock &amp; steals 30k from you, then they get a 5 caps bounty on their head.
---
Oh wow lol
---
And what of the fortifications at evergreen mills? Or the civilization if the Pitt, should I begins to mention the feeble raider groups and tribes slaughtered and repurposed for Caesar's legion? Your deaths are unending and countless
---
Why you gotta be so toxic...
---
The people on this sub are the ones actually doing the events correctly.
---
im in a build team and my camp is near top of the world
---
Yeah I've heard PvP is basically dead on pc
---
Even the bags from Costco don't weigh 11 lbs.
---
I may be in PA but I'm bloodied so I wouldn't last long in there at all.
---
You have to max out perks and armor/clothing bonuses and it stops being a problem. That and tossing things out you don't need. I was hoarding everything in the beginning, but once I started bulking and selling the junk I never used, and getting rid of weapons that I was saving, it stopped being an issue entirely. I only ever used 3-4 weapons, and the ones I was holding on to never got equipped, so there was no point in keeping them. Its the same thing with armor, aid, etc. If you dont use it within several play sessions, you will probably never use it.
---
All that said, it is a seemingly useless and arbitrary limitation. The insanity of it is that you can carry an entire suit of power armor on your person somehow (and it weighs less than the pieces that make it up), but you can't store some guns at your camp.
---
There was a player on my PS4 server who did this a few hours ago. Might've been OP. Whoever it was, I did laugh my ass off.
---
*F
---
If it's a bug, it's pervasive. It's been this way for me across at least 15 different servers, and it appears the same to my boyfriend and others on my friends list as well.
---
What I posted is not hearsay. I recounted direct experiences from mine and friend's/family's accounts. 
---
You can choose to not believe what I'm telling you, that's fine. But this is what we've experienced and done in response to avoid the issue and it has worked 100% for us (YMMV, obviously). I play with enough people regularly that someone would have encountered the issue again if what we were doing wasn't working, considering we all lost at least one set of daily challenges in the early days of season 1. Many lost a set of weekly's as well before avoiding playing around the refresh.
---
But hey, the moment it stops working I'll likely be posting about it here so everyone can benefit from my experiences and hopefully avoid some of Bethesda's pitfalls themselves at my expense.
---
I have no idea what yall doing to get the auto complete I have never had it happen. I have been online during rest, offline during reset, I have been at the main menu, I have stopped playing after nuclear winter without returning to Adventure, I have gone to the atom shop before starting. I have done so many things to try and make it proc but I have never seen it. I am on XB1.
---
Most likely they spawned, half a mile away, and behind a tree or Rock. They then get stuck there, and refuse to move... Even when you shoot them in the face. It also means they will not come after you matter how much you Bang the Drum. And if you don't find that rock, you don't find that mob, it fails. I have seen this happen many many times
---
Also, it plays less hell when you swap to PA on your carry weight.
---
Also stores in the stash lighter.
---
I can't stand Ra-Ra. She's irritating to the extreme, and does nothing by make me fight a bunch of bullet sponge robots all at once. Low rent discount diet version of Tiny Tina.
---
It’s because of people’s tents and camps being too close to event areas.
---
The Difference is that the only mod currently for a Super Sledge just adds a tiny amount of Energy damage, whereas a Tenderizer with the Peppered Mod will out-damage a Modded Super Sledge.
---
And they don't like NW only because they don't win there. They always whine about hackers and weapons not being balanced and rng and stuff. Yeah talk about hacks and balances pff
---
Nope, just random luck. Try ghram or the town in the bog and swamp
---
The gall of these PA users.
---
Good job brother, I’m really close to finishing my scoreboard too
---
Those too would be nice
---
My odds have a been a little  better. About 76%
---
What is that I skipped it yesterday
---
But I haven't encountered it at all.  Who's to say you've not just gotten lucky since then?  You can't prove what you're doing is causing the bug not to happen, it may just not be happening.
---
Should be 2 days bro
---
I think you are referring to the cookout, not primal cuts.
---
Same, what a fucking joke.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i6sj3o/here_is_why_lost_home_is_the_bomb_yo/

Wait W H A T 
---
You mean to tell me that this event isn't just an xp farm???? 👀
---
I thought we were protecting while those hazmat dweebs were collecting 😒
---
Don't tell me what to do.
---
I don’t think it makes sense for challenges during the season itself. You did your challenges faster (repeatable) than intended and get rewards before the end. That was your choice and your reward is getting all that stuff early. 
---
I do however hope they revert to atoms in the two week break between seasons.
---
None of which the Enclave can take credit for, unfortunately. No, your crowning achievement is a failed resurgence of faux democracy that was thrust upon the wasteland and promptly rejected by everyone but yourselves. After which the remnants of your tech fall into our grubby little disorganized raider hands to do with as we see fit.
---
We need these drums in our camps
---
Yeah... that felt like an ad. No thanks. I'm good dude, I already paid.
---
Time to cash out and see if someone's willing to trade legacies for the plans
---
I've got 4 chally's heads, 3 grillmaster hats, one tenderizer mod.  No outfit or backpack.  It just keeps giving me the same things over and over.
---
It’s a 2% drop chance for the tenderizer plan I believe.
---
I'm a heavy weapons build so the damage model will make heavy weapons too wimpy again
---
You’ll be able to sell those for good money
---
If bethesda knows the game have issues, they should take steps to actually fix them
---
bad boys, bad boys, what you gonna, what you gonna moo.
---
Until that happens, we will keep operating on the premise that it is working. There is no other course of action that would make sense for us to pursue.
---
The moment it stops holding true, I'll post an update.
---
But really, for anyone experiencing the issue... It can't hurt to try. Especially if it's happening consistently to someone throughout the season. What do they have to lose at that point? Only more SCORE.
---
Yeah. And Sofia's was bugged for a while so you had a small chance of getting something that wasn't on the loot table i.e. Explosive gauss shotgun
---
I got it from scrapping them.
---
I don’t. I keep trying for rare plans but have hit 100 twice ever.
---
That’s really a you decision.
---
I'm talking any plans, not just that one. No backpack, no meat cleavers, no grill, etc. Just chef hats and cow outfits.
---
Logging out for no reason.  You shouldn't assume something works because you have no evidence, you should assume something doesn't work until you have evidence.
---
Will pay atom for chemical barrel drum plans
---
We had both events up on my private server once, Colossal Problem is only "active" for 5 minutes, then disappears from the map.
---
This alone is frustrating. Makes me wonder what the point of animated cards is even to supposed to be.
---
I’ve scrapped hundreds by now it seems. I’m level 150 already and I run uranium fever daily.
---
Side note they also need to make it so that the whole stack doesn’t spoil at the same time. Needs to be 1 at a time spoils.
---
Don’t know. I’ve only done a handful of events and got the backpack and grill. It’s just luck

Really depends on you and your play style. If you see yourself playing for many months to come than it could be a worthy investment for scrap storage, private servers to do things solo or with just your friends, and the atoms you get each month for stuff you may want to by. I went for the full year and while it's a fine purchase, I think I will let it expire after those 12 months because I know I will move onto other games
---
didn't you guys like create the scorch plague and slaughter congress?
---
Pain. Pain is in that shaker.
---
The rad emitters? A little mine like object you can attach to surfaces that emit radiation, I was looking for them for RP purposes
---
All building set plans can be found at the whitespring station vendor.
---
I'm not aware of them being level locked, but this is not the first time I read this on the sub. it's been so long since I was under lv 50. If you don't find them they either are level locked or somebody bought them already. Try jumping servers a few times, if they are never there then yes, you need to level up some more.
---
That's... Neither here nor there
---
Well I will be damned amd corrected. It says they did in the patch notes from 9/2019. I guess I just had it ingrained to avoid energy weapons and never tested it out. Thanks for setting me straight!
---
Yup makes for big time bugs in NW. Can't reload, use stims, switch guns, run, etc.
---
And its not like I could have made something out of it by collecting nuked flora or high rad fluids and masses, There is literally nothing around Monongah. I only seen 2 mole miners and a very small amount of bomb berrys.
---
You can delete any wires that need to be edited, move the power connectors, then reconnect the wires
---
Same here. F
---
Np
---
I played 6 rumbles in a row, always getting the ore and only one other person on one round helped.  At that point I decided I would ore every other round and XP the other.  Keep in mind others may do the same and don't judge.
---
I get overencumbered in my stealth suit too since I lose my unyielding. If I see radiation rumble pop up, I make sure I dump stuff first so I can still manage. It irks me when people don't collect ore, but it's a public event right? Not my choice how others play.
---
Ah, so I'm not the only one. I didn't know If something in AMD's software changed it with a forced setting or not.
---
I think wastelanders improved it a lot, but it really depends on why exactly you left. You say you were “grossly offended”, but I have no idea what you mean.
---
Good to know I'm not alone and tripping out! lol
---
If you're using chem backpack, grab some glowing blood. No risk of disease and if you take 4 you already in nerd rage. You can farm those at radiation rumble.
---
Same. F
---
Damn, your right. I was referencing that video too but I hadn’t seen it in a while and mixed up class freak and strange in numbers. It’s so hard keeping track of what works or doesn’t work in this game 🙄
---
Within 30 minutes of this post going live I secured plans for Rad emitters and a lot of useful knowledge. Huge thanks to u/Rammadeus and to the rest of this amazing community, you’re what keeps me coming back despite the game’s shortcomings. Happy Meat Week!
---
Just finished today and i think i need a break from 76. Also wondering if S.C.O.R.E carries over to season 2...
---
Other then the tenderizer plan, and a meat week beer stein I don't think the are any other plans.
---
I have the backpack and flag, and I've only completed 8 of them I think. Sorry, RNGesus just not on your side it seems. Apologies, it's usually me. Lol
---
I wish this game was consistent in any way besides consistently terrible.
---
This is why I don't have vendors up on my new character. No ones going to hurt my moo moo
---
Oh really? Is the grill not a plan?
---
What's the glassed cavern one?
---
Prob the collective salt feom the entire player base. In which case, id say that the weight of the weapon is forgiving.
---
Forgot about that.
---
You gotta build up that tolerance. Your momma didn’t give you enough toy cars and wood blocks when you were young.
---
*shrugs*
---
To each their own. If someone is experiencing the bug and it's still worth the gamble to play through the refresh each day, then by all means. People can do what they want. Again I can only provide mine and about a dozen others experiences with this and what we've done to avoid losing more SCORE, anecdotal or not.
---
Sure, maybe we have just gotten "lucky". But we are all on different PCs, in wildly different geographic locations, with different lengths of play time, different creation date and level accounts, different builds, different login methods (Beth.net vs. Steam) etc. It's a fairly representative pool of players I'm recounting.
---
Nothing will get figured out if people don't post their experiences for others to learn from, though.
---
Or we could all just wait for Bethesda to fix it.........................
---
Interested to know this as well
---
Thank you for the info! Obviously still learning everything on my end, just trying to expand my knowledge before I reach anywhere near endgame so I know what’s going on!
---
I think you're correct. And I find it funny when people complain, especially since most are complaining that they have to get ore and others aren't. 
---
I want to complete the event, so I collect ore. Only problem is I can't collect enough on my own to get max rewards. But, if no one else is collecting, I stop at 25 and farm xp too.
---
The only complaint I really have about others just shooting ghouls, is when there are several doing it, but they still let the scavengers die. We'll all get way more xp if the event runs the full time rather than just a minute or so.
---
The stash needs to be like 2000. It’s unreal. I’m not even being unreasonable when I say that. Sometimes we switch builds and don’t want to script the weapons we might change. It’s rhetorical if we don’t. It’s nice to have options when you’re level 300 and play all the time. It really keeps the game somewhat fresh for us.
---
I have mine off and when I try to put down a waypoint, it's either by accident or other reasons.
---
Couldn't you travel to vault 76 and run to the event? Besides looking for an excuse not to do the event, just say you don't want to do the event
---
He died in the middle of the road, that's on you.
---
Sounds like tough luck. I get plans every 2 or 3 runs. If you’re getting the cow costume you can probably find someone willing to trade though. Plenty of people that are getting duplicates of the same item and willing to trade for the plans/items they haven’t gotten!
---
I'm in X0-1 getting more ore than we need because I suck at combat and I want to be of some use.
---
Thanks!! And good luck to you!
---
Same here, on PS4 (non-Pro). Now that I've finished the SCORE run, I'm trying to get the autocomplete to proc each reset using a different one of the suggested triggers. No luck so far. It might have to do with slow or otherwise compromised internet connectivity, though, I'm not diligent enough to test that factor.
---
OMG.. I am.. I guess that just shows how disconnected I am to these two events .. both just don't seem to work for me.. I do play late night west coast when servers are emptying/dying and it is always been buggy and harder to play than when most people do. I hope it works better for the rest of the player base because yawn .. it sucks late night PST 🙂
---
I've just been dropping the clothing when I get it. And just now...got a bloody chef hat. Garbage.
---
You apparently don't realize that you can collect ore and farm the enemies. Simply don't place the ore into the container until close to the end of the event.
---
Bruh if you do that you deserve all that s#it irl man
---
Congrats! Yeap, it's kinda exhausting :( It definitely doesn't carry over to season 2, it's the point of all seasonal mechanics — to keep you playin'
---
They exist. I put a suppressor on my B combat rifle, with a .38 receiver. It’s a good scrub buster.
---
Do you know if the patch will fix the problem with the ounce of prevention quest as well ?
---
It even helps if theres is 3 on drums 3 on roasting the event starts real close to the end goal
---
Do you still need the flag?
---
No, but the best concrete farming spots are in high lvl areas like Abandoned Bog Town. You may have a hard time until you level up or obtain the Chinese Stealth Armor.
---
Yeah I noticed when I jump severs I end up back at the one I started on after 5 or 6 times. That will tell u about how many people actually still play this game. It can’t keep putting you into different active servers if there aren’t any.
---
If I'm looking to get loot and xp in the first place, why waste time running around collecting ores? I can kill at least 50 more ghouls for not giving a damn about them ores
---
Much easier to check on YouTube but it deals with the two Ultracite nodes at the start of the mine
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
I’d prefer a “nuke whoever dares steal your spot” option...
---
Didn't have a way to test it, however isn't there a method how to avoid it? Like the order in which you add the t fuze and the sample?
---
but moo moo likes new people :(
---
I believe it's something to do with changing modes as the server updates the challenges combined with being outside of the US. 5pm is when they change over in the UK, and at 5.01 I managed to log into Adventure after having just completed the last of the previous day's challenges on Nuclear Winter. Half of my challenges were complete and the 5 Mole Miners I'd killed since booting the game earlier in the day had counted towards the Kill 10 Mole Miners challenge. I'd levelled up earlier and that was complete. My weekly challenge for claiming workshops had counted all the ones I'd done that morning. Can't be a coincidence that everything I'd done that day counted towards the next days challenges and that the time zones were different.
---
I tried looting the critters and if I can get the box to pop up it's empty. The loot box only popped up once in 10 ish trys. Then I just stopped trying.  I will try again. Thank you.
---
Good to know the spit thing helps .. I feel less dumb .. I thought it was a troll.
---
nice! how long did it take you?
---
Find a server with AFK people on the drums and spits when the event is not active and stay there, you're almost guaranteed that it will be successful.
---
I sometimes find it difficult to even make my camp look lived-in, let alone looking like a mess. Unlike FO4, I can't just place objects everywhere. I often have used existing structures partly because at least they'll have some stuff strewn around the space...
---
Exactly! So tired of these events failing because people are standing around doing nothing. I'd much rather have 6 afk farmers on these then no one at all doing it.
---
I did the xp grind for this event as I worked toward 100 legendary board game. I have all of the drops from radiation rumble so xp was my drive. Now that I've hit 100 I do ore again because idc about xp unless it's toward score. I make sure those I play with are set up for xp and I run the ore for them. Often times someone will see me running ore and will also grab some. Rarely do I get below 75 if I run ore.
---
I understand complaining about uranium fever and not getting a tag on legendary. Or doing SBQ and someone melts her face. But radiation rumble is one of the few and amazing events that allows one to do exactly what they want with little lose.
---
Shit the insurance companies are onto me!
---
Also repair the turrets and protect the NPCs. Every time I've done this event there are 4-5 others running around all chaotic for each instance of action instead of taking a defensive strategy by holding a strategic vantage point and shoot what comes at you; before it can even get to the center room. I think I've only successfully completed this event with all 4 NPCs alive twice.
---
It's great how fascists put a nice, big target on their back like that!
---
All that would have to do be done in the mean time would be to make the map radius smaller and start the game with fewer players. They used to do this then all the AFK players complained.
---
You have bad priorities. The loot you get from enemies is useless, I rarely if ever loot dead bodies anymore. Especially ghouls.
---
How do you know whether to add your mod entry into the archuve2list or the indexfilelist?
---
Didn't you guys all get wiped out by the scorched, then run away and wait for it to be safe before slinking back? As far as I can tell from the lore you guys were dismantled by the Enclave you so despise.
---
I actually only go into the tunnels with CSA. I'll try to hit the tunnels super quick that way I can farm exp without guilt.
---
Truth.  Also I’m not farming I’m playing Nuka Tapper 🤣
---
You have to tag the critters to loot them. Just like killing other mobs.
---
It's an easy 5-10 min event. Worth farming it.
---
What are the daily ops?
---
I shoot the ground at my feet with the Gamma Gun for big adjustments, and use the Radiation Barrel (rare plan from Radiation Rumble) for finer ones.
---
Sometimes I'll stand on an ash corpse if I don't have a Rad Barrel nearby.
---
We just painted over it. Now I have to peel my window frames like a peasant!
---
This works.  I get there and get on the spit, then when the event starts I go turn in my prime meat, collect all the greens and whatever else. The meter is usually close to the first mark when the event actually starts.
---
I'm definitely staying on one if I find one like that. Or becoming one of the "afk" people myself. Does way more good then a lot of the people running around without a clue ;)
---
naw. it's only certain weapons. Everything else is already in the pool
---
bear arm, fixer, tenderizer. those 3 need to be learned for them to enter the pool. same with the bullion stuff.
---
EDIT: i tested this theory myself by leaning no plans except fixer and handmade on an alt and then spending scrip.
---
I have learned to show up a couple minutes early and start banging the drums or turn the splits. It counts for the event and it can start at the first level.
---
I will take a hit to damage if they start buffing other weapons and perks.
---
I won't mind seeing some new builds come out of it.
---
Some people don't care about camp items or a hazmat suit that you can't even repair
---
Certainly the +50 legendary mobs only show up when the ores deposited. I always hold my ore until the end because fuck the XP grinders.
---
I have never had frame drops while using mine, and it's a Two Shot automatic. 
---
I try not to use it though since other people are having issues. Which is unfortunate because it is one of my favorites.
---
You only need to know the plans for the Bear Arm, Fixer, bullion weapons/armor and now the Tenderizer. Everything else is fair game right from the start.
---
Its not only about the weapons , perks are equally as important...
---
oh and aren't all your former members dead in a bin behind whitespring?
---
Most items don’t need the plans to drop but things like the fixer do need the plans
---
I think it only gives a 1 star for the 5k candy.
---
Sheepsquatch club and staff too.
---
The bullion stuff can be dropped by her too
---
Well, I'm on PC, so maybe it's different for us. Just insanely frustrating.
---
I started the new character about 3 -4 weeks ago, initially just used it to level up and mess around with all the mutations (level 2 17 mutations is fun) started to really enjoy it so focused on it. 
---
My build is basically strength for shotguns, int for leveling and luck 
---
When I reached level 100 I was just entering Abbies bunker .. so a bit behind on the main questline :)
---
I dont know whether it affects yourself when you use it, but definitely happens to others
---
Any of the "dlc" items. Bear arm, fixer, all the sheepsquatch weapons, any bullion bought weapon.
---
Bruh that’s like Currie in fallout 4
---
I'm still amazed how many don't know or don't bother to do this. Last few I'm spamming emotes shooting at the barrels etc just trying to get people to notice and get on them. No luck and then bam failed.
---
Agree with this post a lot.
---
Hmm i see videos from a year ago about farming ultracite ore, probably not what I'm looking for right?
---
It took forever for me ti get the cow.and mask suit, hang in there.
---
Yeah I know, some people are stupid. 
---
We can't all be winners
---
Understood.
---
Just saying pending you goal, the targeting hud may be a viable option;  although it does not assist seeing terrain and obstacles as true night vision would, it does highlight enemies without the need to use the PA headlamp.
---
Yes! Thank you, please spread the word so the fails can stop ;)
---
This.
---
I do it just to hear Grahm sing.
---
MB, the whole thing is 20lbs. All of it is ghoulish overkill. Even the mods.
---
That's why I said "a lot" and not all or everybody.
---
Public server's can be frustrating because not everybody has the same goal as you. If you're trying to farm an event for a specific reward, you'll likely have better luck looking for a group on discord.  That way you know everyone is on the same page.
---
Then it's worth the grind for me. Thanks.
---
I’ve heard a lot about the fixer how do you get the plan for that?
---
Yeah, switch to Junkies. Easy mode + more than enough dmg for 99,9 of this games content
---
Most people dont play that event to win it. They play it to farm XP. So if youre going to go into a blind fit of rage over this perhaps its YOU that should go after the ore if thats what you care about.
---
I can tell
---
I guess you’re lucky. It’s always happened to me when I’ve been online during the reset, including in nuclear winter. Not when at the main menu though. At times I’ve watched the reset happen and watched it auto complete. Other times I’ve watched it and been fine. It just seems so random. I think some unlucky people have had it happen to them while they’ve been offline for hours. Bethesda say they can’t give you score, or give atoms to buy levels that you’ve missed, so anyone it happens to is shit out of luck. At least when you got atoms for dailies they would give you the atoms.
---
I personally like seeing low level modded weapons like lever rifles, handmades and fixers on sale for cheap. It's meant for low level players.
---
I see ya point dawg 👍
---
I agree it is insanely frustrating for yall. I am not down playing it all. I wonder if there is a matrix for PC vs Console hits. Also I wonder if it is hitting more on PC due to modded ini files. Not that I am saying you did I am not on PC so I don't care...if there was some of those map and organization mods on console I would be using them!
---
The unmodded one I have only weighs 16 pounds, but that's still pretty heavy.
---
Based on your replies so far, no you can't lol
---
Sure I agree with you but I’m not that social.
---
I'm ready to shoot Graham in the face and turn that cow into hamburger lol
---
I've seen that but thought it was two nukes launched at the same time lol.
---
I see them selling for about 9k, the plans.
---
I'm pretty sure it'll drop from sbq but I'm not one hundred on that
---
I see, thanks for the information. Here I thought I might be on to something only to have my hopes and dreams squashed.... lol
---
What do you mean? I'm looking at one right here lol
---
I don't know about Explosive resistance but at present his resistance shows as BR 256, ER 400, RR Immune, PR 100. As per the Awareness Perk
---
This bug is game breaking and needs to be fixed asap. Causing extreme fps drops to those around you ruins the experience for those players. The environment becomes grainy and pixelated where the auto tesla rifle shot.
---
The one I got from the event was 20!!
---
In a table. You can see it from the outside.
---
And...... hot patch coming right up, ty.
---
Which room?
---
Yeah, that's what I hate about this game, Beth created a problem, then sell the solution for just $13 a month (well, partial solution).  The biggest problems with this game are his limitations, caps limit, scripts limit, gold limit, stash limit, score limit.
---
How is this possible I've got both weapons plans  2 backpack plans all the outfits and some mods the flag plan and 3 bbq grill plans
---
He does.
---
After you clear out and leave the large open area where you can reach the overseer's office from it's inside a locked room down the next hallway on the left. Make sure she gets the prototype steel mill T-51b helmet later on, too. It's low level but you learn the plan for it as well and can make a level 50 version which has better ER than the normal T-51b helmet.
---
And it’s gonna be low res
---
Wishful thinking lol...
---
You tell me how it's possible.
---
From the encrypted event. It’s a random event reward. Semi- rare
---
Also what the fuck is in that tea!?
---
I got addicted to it and suffered bad withdrawal for a good while because I'm stupid and didn't have nay addictal.
---
What do you mean fail? Ive never had a cook where we don't pass it in less than a 2-3 minutes. What droolers are you playing with where failing is remotely an option?
---
Tbh if you know how fissures work it's not a bug.
---
Press Q (on PC) while looking thought them. 2 levels, IIRC.
---
When people are saying Two Shot accuracy is awful, is that in VATS or free aim? 
---
I have a TS Lever and it's easy to land shots with a scope + holding breath. Get to watch ghoul's heads pop off.
---
Low res?! No of course not! Only the highest quality products for our paying players! Glorious 144p photographs for you! They're not low quality, they're vintage! And they sink into walls so you can't see them anyway! Just like the legendary run game board!
---
Thanks I’ll keep an eye out for that one.
---
They know about it. They have sent out posts that they are not doing anything about it. If you loose your score points it is basically sorry Charlie. If you send a ticket to support they tell you they cannot help. How many ways do they have to say we don’t give a 💩and are not fixing it this season. This is also why they have done double xp and score weekends. Yet people post over and over again that they lost points. By this point in the season who the duck hasn’t? Just move on and try again tomorrow. 
---
Also, you realize you just commented on my comment ? Lmao.
---
It just weighs!  I'll show myself out...
---
Just keep trying every hour on the hour. Get there early please and bang the drums or turn the spits to ensure it doesn't fail!
---
It scales with your level until you hit level 50, then it’s a flat rate. Same thing with moving your camp.
---
Turns out one of my SS armor pieces has weapon weight reduction on it and I didn't realize. 20 pounds is insane.
---
Check player vendors too. It’s expensive usually but a lot of ppl sell them.
---
It’s the GSync monitor you’re using. Unlock your frame rate by doing this:
---
**Navigate to the Fallout76Prefs.ini file. You can find that in the Documents/My Games/Fallout 76 folder in the account of the username you logged into Windows with; it’s not located in the main Fallout 76 install directory.**
---
**Once you’re there, search for the “iPresentInterval” setting and change the value from 1 to 0. Save the file.**
---
You should be good from that point on. This happens on my Nvidia system, but not my AMD system with freesync on, so it seems to solely be related to GSync.
---
I'm heavy weapons too.    I can do commando.....   I don't plan on cashing in any of my 3* weapon perk sets.   You never know what they're going to nerf next or introduce a weapon that turns out to be amazing that you wouldn't normally use.
---
You  can zoom in your map.
---
I use diluted Rad-away for those times when i need to move from deaths door to  his front gate.
---
It counts as booze for the drink booze daily’s.  I’m guessing alcohol is the answer.
---
Multiple times I have joined a public server where either people just stood around or never even showed. It isn't very often but it happens. Count yourself lucky because it is so frustrating when it does happen.
---
Am I the only sadist in the room? I actually enjoy the challenge of juggling stash vs storage capicty... that said I have flirted with the idea of Fallout 1st for that coveted bottomless storage 😅
---
Bet he's a real joy IRL too. /s
---
When I tried to loot there was nothing so I quit trying.. this to know there is supposed to be loot in the critters.
---
I think I have been horribly unlucky and my meat week experience has been overly buggy.
---
I am guessing that the cow outfit is not the only reward or most either, to be fair I got the head once the other 9 ish was the cow.  I seem to be getting them on an impossible metric if the Reddit and YTers are reporting the drops accurately.
---
Hes got them. Server hop.
---
Oh, thanks. Never knew that.
---
Yea I feel like I never can save them even when I kill the blood eagles as fast as possible
---
I think this last attempt was it for me. It's a waste of time when the rng decides I ONLY need clothing I'll never use and nothing else.
---
This. Only the top smart option for 5000 candies gives a legendary and it always gives a one star the ghouls on the other hand will sometimes come in 1-3 star varieties but they won't drop a legendary dragon, only the smart machine does that.
---
Why are you staring at a mirror?
---
Are u on xbox?
---
12 perception with herb and strange...
---
That tea is broken in the best way.
---
Which you disagreed on me with. Either way, resorting to name calling isn't needed.
---
They've had a while to get the issues fixed. Not saying they can't, but not really holding my breath.
---
FO1st is a decent value. Never argued it wasn't. I just want them to deliver on that promise, which in the end would increase sales for FO1st. They can be transparent about it, but they're not very good about that.
---
Pleasant Valley Claim Tickets.
---
Yep. In the recipe you get from doing the daily once, it uses bourbon.
---
Thank you so much, that finally worked after everything I did for it
---
Can u get a leg ripper from this too?
---
Didn’t they say about the ability to move perk levels up and down once you max a perk?
---
X1 here. I have almost everything. People have definetly learned how to do it right and the succes rate has been almost 100%. It's pretty important to kill those drums during the 2 previous minutes
---
The meat clever plan flag plan
---
Vendors already add to your storage limit for the camp, and each can only hold 30 separate items, so why not have each of them with their own storage weights.
---
While we're at it. I wouldn't mind an ammo box that actually holds the ammo rather than being a conduit to the stash. At least give it a bookmark to the ammo page with these things.
---
All you need is 1 person going into 3 of the tunnels for just enough ore for stage 1, But everyone ignores it and just wants the exp.
---
(And just because of that it can be fun to do it with a second person and collect all 4 tunnel sides and hand in to instant complete it as fast as possible. Pisses them off quite nicely.)
---
Very frustrating bug. Doesnt happen in third person view (at least in my experience). Third person also has a faster fire, but still anoying to have to do it.
---
I would like to have them
---
What would help is if displayed items didn't take up stash space...seriously. Same for vending machine items.
---
But yeah I got to experience the pure rage this brings once again. I've been playing on an alt character to grind the legendary run BS (thank god I finished it last night!), and she's level 70. My main is...170+? Well on my main I've been playing since day one pretty much...my main's stash is full...and their inventory is full pretty much as well. I had forgotten the issues I had with my stash since I was playing on the alt character who had tons of room in their stash...
---
Going back to my main and getting overencumbered only to realize my stash was full was...a bitch. It really made me want to just close the game right there.
---
Preach.
---
I can see our enemies fear us very much :) Interesting how people don't realize the Enclave that created the scorched got wiped out by MODUS, ready to be built anew. I guess they fear what they don't understand.
---
ONE person can't get enough ore to complete it.  At most they can get 50 in the time alloted.
---
That makes sense :) what system are you on? If your on Xbox I have some of the extra plans.
---
I'm on PC.
---
Yes, I've experienced that bug on PS4 &amp; it was not because I hadn't factored in weight reduction of my non-PA armor or etc. It behaved as though calibrated shocks wasn't there even though the mod was in place and had been working fine.
---
I wish I could say I found a fix but that would be a lie. After a few days it magically resolved itself.
---
Swing speed is still in the game
---
I did one in the cranberry bog today. one of the mob spawned in the flooded train yard. No way to get to it.
---
I think it be fun to hear the Toddfather say “it just works” when things like this happen: I die panic running into the drill in Colossal Problem and then respawn at my last fast travel point instead of the event and consequently miss out on all of the rewards.
---
It's why I stopped using my magic god rolled Gauss shotty
---
Ha you're one to talk about dead members
---
Gotta have 2 or more accounts at the event. The more accounts running, the greater the odds
---
Secondary thing, whenever I use the ammo points thing I phase through the ground and can’t do anything
---
Thank you, but can you still find it with the bloodied effect?
---
You guys are milking the puns a bit much.
---
Yes u can
---
I did one yesterday with all drums and spits manned before it started, when even started we were already almost half way to the goal
---
I saved myself a lot of torturous ini editing by downloading the quick configuration tool on the nexus and launching the game through that once i figured out the settings that worked for me
---
Thank you, appreciate it
---
Your welcome
---
After so much complaining on this subreddits 
---
I will collect ore if the event is under 2min and has less then 25 ore collected ... other then that I’m farming exp
---
Almost everytime but i found a quick fix,you just need to use the bash button and it fixes for some reason.Btw i have question.Was it intentional that they made the gauss shot gun be able to kill in long distance?I hope it was because its really useful sometimes.
---
What system do you play on
---
If you're on PC I sell them for 500 caps on my vendor. Not legendary though.
---
Ps4 and u?
---
Im on xbox
---
Cumulative with all aid weight reduction with a cap of -90%
---
Shakira's hips
---
It's between cranberry glade and the cranberry bog meat week event
---
Ah okay, sorry dude I can't help you there. I believe the raider vendor in Whitesprings, Crater, and at top of the world may have some of those, might need to server hop a few times to see if anything in their inventory changes. Other then that, id say post on LFG or whatever it's called on PC to see if people have extras. Hope that helps.
---
I'm sure you are aware that costumes go over armor so if you have raider costumes they will look much better then the actual raider armor but that's just my opinion. Best of luck, hope you find those before December :)
---
2 people need to do the ore.  
---
You wait with your last haul until the event is nearly over, so the xp gain is at the absolut maximum.
---
Don't worry, my moo moo has a coolectron friend to keep them company :D
---
they are yes, and everything has been nerfed, not just bloodied.
---
Ps4. I have a BSS ski sword anda war drum, not sure what build you use. But if you could use one LMK, you can have it
---
Uncooked meat for 15 rads at a time
---
FFR: 25% faster damage, which equals 25% damage increase (under circumstances where that actually works- boss fights) but 25% more ammo usage/durability loss.
---
Explosive: 20% of weapon damage done as an AoE explosive effect. Boostable to 32% with 5 perks in Demo Expert; radius boostable with Grenadier. Does not benefit from Sneak, Crits, or Weak Spots. Seems to be affected by armor separately? Not sure about that one. No extra ammo usage, but it’s been reported (I have not personally verified) that explosive causes weapon degradation per target hit by the explosion, including the primary target (so 1 shot hitting a target will cause 2 degradation, one from bullet, one from explosion). 
---
SBQ is immune to explosives. 
---
Things to consider: FFR may be less valuable than Explosive on weaker enemies if Explosive allows you to 1shot them. 
---
FFR is pointless on 1shot weapons (edge cases, but stuff like black powder weapons, bows)
---
Current PTS changes don’t seem to change either of these; the 20% explosive effect seems to still be off the current total weapon damage (and this should absolutely be the case) and of course FFR doesn’t change.
---
Maybe make the bounty proportional to the amount stolen. Also make various boxes hold various amounts max and maybe different difficulty to pick. Like the little money box, maybe it can hold 10k and it’s level 1 to pick but cheap to make. The safe can be level 3 and hold 30k, maybe they make a high security safe with a key pad instead that holds 50k but it takes flux or another new rare material to build. Key pads are not uncrackable it just takes a while.
---
I jumped on last night to do a mod for someone. Was only in game a few minutes, but the event started as i finished up the mods. Told the guy to forget the caps and get to the drums instead. Spent maybe 4 minutes total time there but was able to complete the event easy enough from the 10 or so people.
---
The weight on that thing is odd anyway, it shows only 8 but its actually 20.
---
Hey man I would really appreciate it, I can trade for it
---
Camp companions are cool but rather useless aside from the cosmetic appeal. We should be able to use them as a clerk and excess caps from vendor go to their inventory to be collected. Even if they had a max of 10,000 or something and they took a cut for payment similar to the existing tax I think it would help a lot.
---
Ideally it could even be expanded upon with a new quest to find and hire a dedicated vendor clerk. Stats like charisma could even effect the negotiation of the cut they would take.
---
I listened to the Lev and Rocco's plan holotape but never went to any boat house. Ain't nobody got time for that.
---
Nope. There's no explosion resist on either.
---
They just reduce that small damage by 70%/80% to the single digits before the DR reduces it further.
---
Yes! Then it's usually completed in a minute or two after the initial countdown timer is over. Quick easy no chance of failing. Trying to spread the word so no one else feels the frustration 😂
---
Wow ok, guess it might happen to me then. Most cooks I go to most of the server turns out so even if 50% of people do absolutely nothing we still pass it pretty quick. If I'm not there before the event starts it's normally over by the time Ive fast travelled there and I miss out.
---
No trade needed all yours ,been sitting on a mule forever, rather them get some use
---
Psn is MidRoad-
---
Also just looked have a bss polehook aswell
---
Hopefully this re-balance is the first step.. afterwards they will start working on the equipment and weapon
---
Blood is is number 1 simply because of Unyelding legendary effect. It matches perfectly with bloodie
---
all adds to 90% : exceptions to said rule is if an item has weight reduction.  So you get the 90% and then another 90%.
---
Personal choice for myself is 4 weapon weight and 1 chem/aid/food and on take 2 stars in thru hiker as I have the chem backpack from the raiders.  
---
Edit: Also it does not stack with perks.
---
This is the optimal way to complete it .
---
Type in glassed cavern exp gltich
---
I've not had a single problem with it so far, is it the same area or different ones?
---
Hahaha... I enjoyed the deer slaughter, then things went sideways. You handled it with aplomb!
---
Found it! Seems like they changed up camp placement a bit, had to work to find a spot that would include the bus not not be too close to the glade
---
you aren't my dad. 
---
anyone at the event has access to a hazmat suit, power armor or likely chinese stealth armor.
---
get into those tunnels yourself,  if it's such a big deal.  i am gonna snipe ghouls.
---
And the drugs.. that money baby!
---
Ah, I misunderstood the question, my apologies. Have you been on a team recently? Perhaps someone built them for you?
---
Thanks man I'll make sure to add you
---
I bought It today. What is It for?

do the encryptid event and get lucky
---
or buy it for 6-10k
---
What new melee weapon? I've only heard of a new outfit from daily ops.
---
You should have gotten the stein display and beer stein plans first time, those are guaranteed.
---
Only thing I want from the enclave is a matte black skin for my scout armor so I can stop using the atomic skin.
---
Apparently you hit the VATS button:  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bc1v9y/pearly_peepers_zoom_function/
---
Tysm dude
---
Bethesda games are really hoarding sims with other features.
---
Not in your stash :)
---
Shut up and take my money!
---
Actually the goal of the event is to both collect more and protect the scavengers, so killing ghouls is technically playing the goal...
---
I just carry around 4-5 glowing blood and/or ionized meat all the time. Glowing meat if all else fails. If I use some, I make sure to grab some more from enemies ASAP. 
---
They’re common everywhere, and the first two don’t expire.
---
Diluted rad-away to recover if my rads get too  low; the Healing Factor mutation actually helps here, because without Class Freak, healing factor reduces the rad recover to like 10%. So just pop a rad-away if you get below 10%, you’re back up under 20%. Of course if you use class freak it won’t be quite that nice... I have a perk Loadout (PC- perk Loadout manager) that swaps in the rad removal during sunlight perk, it works 50% of the time.
---
Yeah I'm not counting the stein as a rng drop because it's guaranteed. The display I got from fasnacht.
---
I run a Vamps heavy build and do lots of SBQ runs. I use X01 top half for the higher Radiation protection and T51b Legs for the higher DR. It seems to help more with the leg breaking.  I hardly ever have to fix the top half
---
Ok, just wanted to be sure it wasnt like an actual bug that no plans dropped. If I get some extras, ill pass them to you. I cant play now, but will be shortly.
---
🙂🤗 A hug to whoever down voted a question.. I am sure when they created Reddit they thought hey.. information is not for everyone.. lol .. seriously a warm hug bro.. I think you need it!
---
Getting the ore while everyone else stays up top is a total Chad move
---
I have the full chally set for my moo moo conservation. Hoping for a tenderizer to 'educate' those who pray on our poor defenseless brahmin buddies.
---
I hope Bethesda will make endgame stuff a little bit easier to get, especially with Gold Bullion. But overall, I agree with everything your saying here and I hope to see huge improvements in the future from Bethesda.
---
Do you have a specific build?
---
I have hundreds of gameplay in Fallout 3 and newer as do thousands of others that would say otherwise. I've tested it myself.  
---
I don't switch perks unless I'm crafting or selling. Light on......detected more often. Light off.....I can sneak up on 99% of enemies, shoot them in the face, crotch, pinky toe, tentacle, etc. and they do nothing.
---
Hell, I'll gladly settle for not having to do the rep challenges every time I log in; sorry Roxy but I've got better things to do than hunt down deserters, what's that Wren... you need somebody to fetch you vacuum tubes, pfffft. Warren, get up off your miserable sorry arse and get back that osmosis kit yourself! I swear Davenport, if I have to take another picture of Page I'm going to dismantle you piece by piece! XP be damned! I estimate that I'm 4/5 days from reaching max rank with the raiders, after which I'm dropping the mic and walking off into the sunset!
---
But yeah, granting atoms is a nice idea.
---
Free States or Die
---
That is a work of art....damn if your on xbox I would love to contract you!
---
My friends ask me all the time because on ps4 they can see me playing everyday for the last 7-8 months. I played only in short stints prior to that.
---
I always tell them the same thing, the game has much more content than a year ago and updates come faster as of the last 4-5 months but it’s every bit as broken as it was before. 
---
So when they ask “is it good now?” my answer is an unwavering “No”
---
I still play almost everyday, but if I’m completely honest, I have never recommended this game to anyone.
---
How many more times is this going to be posted lol
---
Now now, where's the freedom in that?
---
To be fair the business end is a keg of beer.
---
How much time did you take .anyways nice job
---
Thanks so much - Sorry man PC
---
Enjoy 🙂
---
So disappointed with the second push back  T.T
---
MOM! MOM, THE MEATLOAF! Fuck!
---
I’m calling we won’t find out it’s been delayed until Tuesday
---
Started it this morning so about 7/8 Hours on and off - Thanks
---
I'd rather take one a level 91 Deathclaw than a level 46 Assaultron. They've got my number big time.
---
Does it snap to anything at all?
---
at least they died fighting the scorched plague, your members died fighting a robot and ended up in a bin
---
As far as bullion I purchased ss armor.its dope .most of the guns I have are through trading.scout masks still drop very low rate but eventually you will find good gear.are you on xbox?
---
If you're referring to moving the device while in build mode, you should be good. I've never had (nor heard of) any issues doing this. The only thing is, when you move the device, it will change where you spawn in. So you could potentially load into something that prevents you from moving around. Also, if you have a pet, they'll load in where your device is located. So if it's inside, your pet could get crushed from items loading in.
---
I feel that.  I miss being able to place random objects, I spent a disturbing amount of time doing that in 4, making things just right.   Hundreds of hours, at least.
---
And hopefully with less genocide this time.
---
Build?
---
That looks really neat, short of Art Deco design
---
The game warns you.
---
Is there a way to purchase one?
---
May your tenderize their minds so they worship the moo moo
---
Just put a sign out front, "gravity bunker"
---
Just other fence pieces.
---
you have a time limit. if everyone is too busy fucking off on top of a tent, certain mobs won't come near you. I watched a team of 3 camp on a tent and fail the event, and as soon as they touched the ground the radscorpians they were supposed to kill finally came out. Stop camping on top of structures and actually fight instead of going afk.
---
Cool.it seems like you can find some really strange things on p.c
---
but they are so amoosing
---
That happens after nuking that area
---
I needed the rad emitters for RP purposes, they put out a certain amount of radiation
---
It's bigger on the inside.
---
Go here and put in your build:  
---
 [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) 
---
Then post your build here so we can see what you got.  While your weapon is important your build it just as important.  You really have to give up your QoL perks to get your damage up in this game.
---
Once we can help you with your build your best bet is to earn caps and buy a weapon from a player to meet your build.
---
Agreed on uranium fever and sbq. Its not like the mole miners can hurt most players at the moment, so why not let everyone get some script.
---
The only way I'm OK with someone absolutely destroying the sbq is when it's down to the last couple minutes. But when there are still 27 minutes on the clock, then there is no reason to.
---
I should complete the legendary run this weekend, and then I'll probably slow down a but on some things. I didn't mind the grind, but it did change the way I played sometimes.
---
It just works...
---
I have been getting blasted with trade requests from every low level I see this week,  Kids be thirsty! You only need to make the trade emote once buddy, everyone in the neighborhood can see you, don't worry.
---
So they can be used by a Bloodied Build?
---
How people keep missing this is surprising.
---
Hop over to the trade forum and swap the clothes for plans? It's how I got all the rest.
---
i finished a week ago so all my score made now is lost. i didnt spend any atoms on it
---
So true 🤣
---
When you reach a mission that says “siding with crater/siding with foundation”
---
Once that missions appears on your pip boy, that means you’ve done every available mission for each faction. 
---
And now choose which faction you want to raid the vault with.
---
So my TS fat man will be useless and my BE .50 will be the equivalent of a 1* bloodied .50?
---
you can server hop to find a server where the quest has not been completed yet or join someone's private. If you're on PS4 I can help.
---
Nah I'm not looking to trade in this game.
---
I wonder if PS4 and PS5 players can play together.
---
Atom shop bundles with spooky themes. The skeleton outfit does not have a matching backpack however there is a coffin shaped one that may be in the atom shop again this year. Gloves are part of your outfit so if the outfit doesn’t have gloves then you don’t have gloves.
---
I've been planning to nuke white spring, just don't feel like running around and collecting the code pieces to do it. Lol
---
To be honest, I often get that same reaction when talking to women IRL as well...
---
Is that what this is this has never happened to me before. I just considered it punishment for going AFK while the challenges updated. I was at the cookout event for 3 hours turning a crank AFK and when I came back there was some dumb server connect nonsense and now I can't get this stupid Captain Cosmos suit bundle today. Anyway almost everything that happens with this game is a disappointment so it just solidifies my decision to not care about season 2 and take another 8 month break. What a shitty company. Who wants to take part in something that's always broken?
---
Thank you man :)
---
It is far too cryptic
---
Foodbuilds just should have been banned... there is no good reason for u to stick around besides u spend some money at the atomic shop.
---
Just play mindcraft...
---
Hard mode = anything except Bloody/Junky
---
This game isn't for you it appears. Best of luck in another :)
---
Last 2 events we started at lv 2, and completed one of them in 30 sec. Was an awesome server.
---
Welcome to the grind. All you can do now is hope that luck is on your side when fighting legendary enemies, and they drop worthwhile gear. Start concentrating on a build that suits your playstyle, are you likely to be up close causing chaos, or parked up high carefully picking off targets?
---
Check player's vending machines for gear and an idea of how to price stuff you want to sell yourself.
---
Look through the subreddits that are a market for fo76 as well.
---
Also DON'T ARRIVE AT THE EVENT AND START TRADING WITH GRAHM
---
Aye 👍
---
So do you have to buy the outfit in the atom shop to get gloves?
---
who even does that when there‘s [NukaCrypt](https://nukacrypt.com/) lol
---
Even the most simple task is to much for u foodbuilds...
---
Originally, it didn’t matter what level you were. A level 200 and a level 2 would have to pay the same amount of caps to travel from one place to the other. 
---
Obviously if you equip the perk card “travel agent” under charisma, it gives you a small discount. 
---
However when Wastelanders came out. I’m going to assume you didn’t read much about the patch notes or the info that comes along with the updates, they mentioned that in order to help out the low level players, you’d get a significant discount when it came to fast traveling. Because low levels obviously don’t have that many caps, and the low level events and missions don’t reward that much. 
---
I’m not sure at what level that discount stops. But they definitely pay less than we do.
---
They don't lie.
---
I just dislike those little robot critters
---
Yes I realised this also. The pixellation gets really bad sometimes
---
One thing that helped me is knowing they always unburrow in the opposite direction you are moving. So I just slowly walk backwards looking at the ground and they always appear right in my crosshairs.
---
Pretty much sums up my experience every time I play.
---
I actually always raise weight limit really high in the single player Fallout/Elder Scrolls games with console command cuz carry weight just wastes my time in them, nor is it immersive cuz no ones carrying 200-400lbs of stuff realistically anyways.
---
This game frustrates me with having absolutly no way to permanently raise the limits. Like Path of Exile for example lets me buy permanent stash boxes, and all of Warframe and Guild Wars 2 inventory expansions are permanent as well and even gained with currency earned in-game. The most this game does is let you "Rent" a scrap stash, which is lame.
---
No. If an outfit has gloves then they are part of the outfit. There’s no option to equip or unequip gloves as they are not in the game, with the except of them just being part of the outfit texture.
---
Ahahah best title of this sub in ages
---
Whats in that salt shaker you ask? The salty tears of every fallout 76 gamer that has come before you. Bethesda saves them to use later.
---
It would be cool if we could just stomp them (and other little enemies like radroaches) while in PA...
---
Something similar to this:
---
[https://youtu.be/yi7ul0GtllE?t=9](https://youtu.be/yi7ul0GtllE?t=9)
---
I've got 130k ammo 190 plasma cores and 50 fusion cores on my character at the moment 😅 when I take all my weight reduction perks off I weigh 1750 pounds
---
So we don't need to have the pieces, just the keycards?  For whatever reason I thought you had to have the pieces. Lol
---
Oh damn it. Can you buy gloves separately or no?
---
For there is much work to be done, and the Enclave never rests. Never.
---
Well, the only time it's happened to me in the last 3 weeks or so is when I was online at the reset time.  It could be a coincidence but I don't buy that.
---
No gloves are not in the game. They are part of the outfit textures
---
Isnt 50 ore level 2? Thats good enough to complete it.
---
first few weeks of public teams it was jumping. but most of the time everyone stayed in the one area. 
---
now it's back to being a ghost town
---
I think the max is 5000 at once
---
I've only seen the event fail if the timer runs out.  There are a large number of unessential ads during the rounds so it's vital to run to the marked prime animals to kill them immediately.  All of the Primal Cuts that I've seen fail was because too many people got caught up killing the wolves or mole rats and were ignoring the honey beasts, snallygasters, or cave crickets.
---
Damn that's unfortunate. Sorry for all the questions. You're a giant help! Does the event usually start at the beginning or end of the month?
---
Cool, thanks a lot!
---
+place those wiry plants on top of the bunkers. Who's got time to manscape in the wasteland?
---
Same tbh
---
I think last year it started in September
---
With 6 people going at the start and one challys feed we finished it in under 30 seconds.
---
I hate all animal enemies that just attack my feet and then randomly jump and i just miss shot after shot
---
Damn do you remember if it started at like the middle or end?
---
No, mathematically there’s no way it could. Bloodied can give you +80% damage while Berserker is only +50%. 
---
Though a Berserker build that utilizes adrenal reaction, nerd rage, etc will still dish out a crap ton of damage. Though at that point you might as well go bloodied for the full benefit. 
---
Berserkers is really fun though. I have a rifleman Berserker character that is a great change of pace
---
I believe you unlock all the t65 helmet mods when you learn the t65 helmet plan.
---
No. You need the plan
---
When are we gonna fix the water filter in the bunker?
---
Every time I use the water fountain I get dysentery...
---
And I'm tired of filling out requisition forms.
---
Well that sucks why award me the weapon (non legendary)
---
Couldn’t agree more. Adding a trigger for this, song with things that are already there, like SBQ &amp; Encryptid, and now new stuff like Colossal Problem and Daily Ops would make for a really solid loop of endgame activities.
---
Does radiation resistance count against beserkers?
---
The alien blaster and nuka ones??
---
There have been a few mentions of this in past posts, but they normally also say they were taken care of by customer service. I'll admit it is rare that I see them, especially recently. As I mentioned in my edit it's possible they gave me the wrong bundle even because of some bug, which if they gave me my transactions would clear that up quickly. I know what I saw on my screen though watching my atoms go down when I clicked purchase as well as them still being said amount when I purchased my next bundle before going to build. Something is wrong and personally I feel like I shouldn't have to resort to claims on something else to make up for this mistake is all, because either way my Fallout 1st is remaining canceled. I have no issue with anybody else who asks for refunds on other broken items and such, more power to them. Their decisions on what issues to help with and what not to help with just make little sense. It's a virtual currency that people spend money on. If somebody has never sent in a ticket before and has been paying for Atoms for quite some time, then logic would dictate they're trying to solve a legitimate issue and they are not trying to screw you over so take care of them. If somebody does it a bunch then yeah, say no to them.

---
Do the blood sample  first then t-fuse It will work that way i had the same issue
---
What's in 7?
---
This was my first time all season. Was pretty upset over it, especially being a double day, but I'm almost done anyway so I know I can get it back.
---
Radscorpians. Mole rats but actually a little dangerous. I had one chase me when I was level 30 from that cabin near the war cemetery all the way to foundation.
---
Certain melee weapons only drop with swing speed from the purveryor. They don’t drop from enemies. I can’t remember which ones though. I think it’s mainly unarmed weapons though.
---
Could you name a few events with guaranteed legendary enemies? I havent done enough events to know this yet.
---
Still a cool weapon nonetheless, it can hold its own pretty well and if you dont get the plan at least you have a weapon to show for your participation lol
---
Well duh. We're Raiders, not white knights. Although if memory serves, The Enclave presence was confined to the Whitesprings Bunker after the initial Scorched emergence because y'all were also found wanting. Had to bolster your ranks with green as grass vault dwellers. We were here before the Enclave, and we'll be here after your many sad defeats throughout Fallouts History. We're like roaches.
---
They’re a camp item so I don’t think coming back and forth just to get irradiated is the most viable, plus there’s more faster ways to irradiate yourself, but if you don’t mind all that then sure, it could work with bloodied
---
I run Ultracite exclusively, but that’s because I’ve got the now-legacy jetpack on the arm. 
---
It’s also very tough all-around protection. And I’ve got several atom shop skins that switch up the look (plus a few paints at this point, tho there’s not many for Ultracite)
---
Is that a new change where it might drop a legendary dragon, or has it always been that way? I think I'm sitting at around 2400 candy in the machine, might have to start doing that event again - for science.
---
Yes, 5000 total.
---
Loool scrapped it already
---
Yet still no laughing emote, that's all I want.
---
Effectively. I think Fatman will punch through, the TS only splits the on hit damage (1) - both explosions deal max damage. It just won't be as big as it is on paper
---
I know people are gonna scream “nO iT wOuLdN’t bE SpEcIaL aNyMoRe!!1!”
---
But I’d love it if these special events would happen on the weekend. Fasnacht on Fridays, Meat Cook on Saturdays, and the Treasure Hunter event on Sunday. 76 lacks content outside of these yearly events and this would give players something to look forward to on the weekend.
---
(Not saying give us seasonal events like the Halloween and Xmas ones often, but I can see Grahm having a cookout on the weekends, Mole miners trying to move their goods on sundays, and the robots having Fasnacht every Saturday. Hell a holotape in the robot shed in Helvetia says the robots are programmed to decide on their own how often they celebrate Fasnacht... It should be popping up randomly year long. Least that would make sense given the lore.)
---
Unfortunately theres no benefit to that. Personally i would put it in my vendor for like 3k
---
I'm having this issue with my handmades, honestly.
---
I fast travelled to a team member at the event, which worked. I spawned way out in nowhere, but sure, I'll take it. However, entering the event area didn't start the event for me. So I get your 'solution', but it didn't work for me.
---
I don't really get how complaining about the technical state of the game seems to be off-limits. Everyone who has played this game for many hours has to admit there are some weird technical problems on display in this game. Don't get me wrong, I really like the game and have enjoyed it immensely. But come on, every update the game is hanging more and more by a thread. Be reasonable.
---
Weapon is secondary. Your damage mainly comes from your build. Example. I run a bloodied commando....doesn’t everyone....and B2525 fixer. I can swap the fixer out for a plain modded non legendary and still 1 shot everything and obliterate scorchbeasts in a few seconds.
---
Mid I think. If I remember correctly they did something like most stores do and put the Christmas stuff in the atom shop in October. You’d have to scroll through old Inside the Vault articles to find that information.
---
Alright that’s good for the fat man. I really love my BE .50 and it kills most enemies within 2 seconds. I’m now very disappointed and idk what I’m gonna use against him
---
Liberators are definitely annoying.
---
mirelurk spawns
---
fuck those little shrimps
---
I believe, according to dataminers, it has a separate drop pool and never had the dragon or ripper removed like the other drop pools do, so it's the only place to get legendaries of them any more except by trade.  But considering you can get any weapon and it takes 5000 candies it's gonna be a pretty small chance you'll get one. Still it's one of the best events to grind high level ghouls since they nerfed One Violent Night so it can't hurt to grind plus some players sell the candies in vendors. I personally do it nearly every time it comes up.
---
My taste for weapons changes a lot and yeah I've noticed that its also for the handmade which got me killed a lot of times when it would reload after like 6 shots
---
Trading is how I got most of my good shit.
---
How many times has it happened?
---
Totally agree. Plus the area has great loot. I notice no one ever even goes when it pops. BUT if I go, others show up.
---
I'm sorry, but it has never affected detection. There was a huge obstacle getting mods to address it in Fallout 4, but nobody got it to work. Sneak is very fickle and there are 3 different sneak stats. Sneak skill, sound events and visual detection. Only the cell lighting affects visual detections, and Shadowed mods or stealth boy, chameleon aid you against it.
---
Ok awesome! Thank you very much for taking the time out of your day to answer all my questions, I truly appreciate it!
---
Never mind the first and second effects on the tenderizer, 90% reduced weight is the only effect on it that matters... Such a neat weapon but I don’t wanna carry around this 20 pound POS just for fun.
---
(I’d love to get one with Bloodied, Power Attack Damage, and reduced weight though...)
---
No problem
---
This game causes a lot of salt so I'd imagine it'd be pretty heavy at this point.
---
Daily faction quests and events marked with a (!) give treasury notes which go in your misc. tab.
---
Treasury notes convert to gold.
---
You can hand in 20 notes per day for 200 gold at one of the vending machines at foundation or crater.
---
Didn't work for me, there were too many player icons on the event icon. It doesn't help that team member icons are larger as well. I just don't understand why player icons have more priority than the event icon. You can't get a clear picture of players there anyway, because you keep hovering over the same players.
---
My hand made likes to reload when I have 9 shots left
---
Early on it hit me two or three times.  Then I heard that being online at reset is one of the things that can cause it.  So I made sure to log out before reset.  It didnt' happen again, until earlier this week, when I lost track of time and at 1 or 2 minutes after reset I suddenly realised I was still online, I checked my challenges, and sure enough, they had all auto-completed except the NW one.
---
I'm not saying it's the only thing that causes it, lots of people say it's happened at other times too.  And it *could* be coincidence, like I said.  But it's definitely consistent with it being one of the causes.
---
Edit: In a few days I'll be rank 100, so I fully intend to be online at reset regularly just out of curiosity.
---
You can also buy 300 gold a week for 6K caps upstairs at the wayward.
---
HOLD UP! What is the Tenderizer?
---
Thank you for the information!
---
Do you know if I could get legendary versions of the secret service armor? If so, can it drop in unyielding and can it be modded with deep pocketed?
---
I think you need to learn the plan first from what I was told
---
In my experience there's definitely three blood eagles there.I always kill the first two and then frantically Vats for the last one. I have yet to kill the last one before the hostages die. 😭
---
Yeah I’m on team Mirelurk Spawn as being the worst.
---
Thanks, so that and doing events + daily faction quests for treasury notes are the only two methods of obtaining gold?
---
I have T65 with one legacy ultrasight jet pack arm, I love the look of the T45 though and miss using it in complete red paint but my T65 I guess is endgame &amp; better suited to my needs.
---
Just as I suspected.  You are all over the place and you have a lot of QoL perks that you are going to have to ditch.
---
You are losing a lot of damage with your points spread across so many stats.
---
Here is my old stealth/rifleman build:

---
First you need to pick a play style.  Do you want Melee, Heave weapons, Rifles, etc...  Once you pick how you want to fight we can go from there.
---
Those &lt;insert favorite expletive here&gt; floaters, especially the flame ones, Just lob fireball after fireball as if I were its own prime meat cook-out. I seriously hate those things. They SUCK!
---
Come on man, not another post telling people how to play. I appreciate your frustration, and it feels good to vent to like-minded people, but if your playing with strangers it's always going to be a gamble.
---
The event is just good for XP the rewards that are worth getting are so rare that I'd rather test out my weapons while in my best gear then almost die 170 by radiation only to get nothing good in return.
---
If they gave better rewards to those who got the ore then I would collect it.
---
Just tried this. Both events did pop up but after killing the Queen the Colossal problem event wasn’t there anymore :( Think it took a little over 5 minutes to kill her though so I guess whoever said you got to kill her under 5 minutes to do it was right.
---
You can edit the ui colors my power armor ui is red
---
A beer keg attached to a sign post with bits sticking out. It's the weapon grahm uses that you can get the plans for during the event.
---
Indeed
---
Watched one "tunnel" up to the monorail car by the bog primal cuts. Like a rocket right through the stairs platforms.😂
---
That is how the other weapons work (Like the fixer) so that makes sense.
---
Done the event like 12 times ar this point, still dont have it :(
---
It’s fun and challenging to collect them and decipher the code the first time but after that all I’ve ever used was nukacrypt.
---
I was the only person getting ore last time I played and stealth suit &gt; weight. There were 8 spawned snallies down there, just chillin. No way any of those hosers would come down and stim me. I was slow af but I was alive lol
---
Members.
---
I find myself doing sort of everything nearly every time regardless of how many people are there. I collect ore, heal the scavengers, and murder as many enemies as possible. Does no one else use friendly fire? I can't be the only one right? Of course so much of that would be easier if I didn't have to literally beat scavengers with a shiskebab or flamer to heal them. One day I do hope they fix it so the flames of the Flamer actually heal like its supposed to.
---
Yes you do, i learnt the plan yesterday, and just got a drop today
---
Yeah it is always legendary but the number of stars and type is random when you craft it. 
---
You need legendary modules from the purveyor to craft them (50 scrip each). 
---
I have a full set of unyielding SS.
---
Nah Modus is going to lead us to Great future.
---
Agreed, little bastards 🤣
---
And raiders aren't used? All glory to the mighty mothman who doesn't care that you exist!
---
It's almost multiple people suffer a problem for the first time, go looking for help on how to solve it, and find this place. They then post about that problem in the hopes that a solution they've not seen will be provided to them.
---
I see people going crazy for them right now In market subs you sir are lucky and also the mods for it
---
I had no issues taking on both of the deathclaws to get to the blackwell bunker. Didn’t even need a stimpack. I disliked facing assaultrons in FO4 and it’s worse now
---
Yuup
---
 It's a 2 percent drop rare along with the mods for it.
---
If you can, afk on a drum or spit while you sleep. If you have an Xbox plug the controller into the console and but a rubber band around the sticks. 
---
Not sure if it works with PS4.
---
Wow, this is a weird random encounter I have never heard of before.
---
He selects the best stuff and gives you the rest back
---
But really who cares, less work next day
---
Heres hoping i get a decent one to drop haha
---
Most annoying mole rats, most dangerous Mirelurk Kings.
---
Commie.
---
Mine does as well. Swapping weapons tends to put the remaining core charge back into the GL (though its a pain in the middle of a fight).   :(
---
It means that the station is in a position that the character cannot enter it.
---
Re-orient the power armor station so it can show the animation where the character can get into it and start working.
---
Yea you’ll need to pray to mama purveyor for that
---
Radscorpion
---
I’ve level 542...Power Armor is for wussies.
---
No, I have not placed it yet, Will have to do it.
---
You know what would actually help? Frickin' text chat! I'd like to coordinate with people at this event, but I can't even communicate with them.
---
That is creepy AF and I do not mean the glitch! WTF Bethesda????
---
Buying + faction quests + events marked with (!)
---
The game seems to be fine when I use it. If its affecting others though I suppose I will have to switch out till fixed or unless I'm soloing. That is a shame since its good for handling multiple enemies swarming on you.
---
It seems to be linked to things you've done before the changeover to the next days challenges. For example, I killed 5 mole miners and took three workshops before this week changed over and those challenges were half complete when they started, with a lot of the complete ones corresponding to other things I'd done that day but before the challenges swapped over.
---
I'd like that as well, even popping on a headset doesn't do it since most have that sound option off or group only etc.
---
Cocaine
---
No. Can't see them.
---
That's what I thought. He was saying how I was gonna die and stuff. It's like no I use vampires in the collosus I will usually live
---
I got the impression this was a scripted event. Has anyone ever saved them?
---
I HATE kings!
---
I solo Encryptid every day, without PA....it’s the build, not the armor.
---
Awesome, thank you
---
theres both a salt and pepper Mod for it.  both drops from the event.
---
Mighty mothman? Tell that to my .50 cal that’s killed dozens of them
---
So true. It's about the friends we made along the way.
---
Dude. I need video.
---
Oh so you can’t spend more modules to guarantee a 3*? Also can you trade it or scrip it?
---
And damn that’s awesome, I bet it’s really grindy to get the full set
---
Oooof, well that sucks :/, Thanks!
---
Yeah my build will dodge most damage. I just use vampires in collosus currently as I haven't got the stray for surviving without it. When I know how to use unarmed and not die ill be good
---
after purchasing the 5,000 cap plan for T-45, T-51, T-60, and X-01, I can confirm, none alter the appearance of the power armor...not sure about secret service PA it could be different I have def seen people with the tesla coils visible on their power armor just don't know how they got it
---
Servers are suffering through all the extra graphical rendering. Fast travelled to a primal and could not fire my weapon for about 45 sec., Fast travel bug hitting hard, ect..
---
Needs more and tastier rewards
---
Wait, people who uses reddit don't read the patch notes? No way.
---
In 76, my main char is a Stealth Sniper. A max level Fixer and a 3 Star Combat Rifle are my two main weapons and both have Supressors on them. It has Sneak maxed out and one armor piece has the Chameleon and "Harder to detec while sneaking " effect on it.  
---
There might be a somewhat malleable variable in the game. Light on causes more problems for me while Light off rarely gets me noticed by an enemy.
---
I do want that Grillmaster Hat
---
i keep getting Chally Outfits an Tato Salad
---
I know right!  heckin bamboozled
---
armor costs 1 legendary module and can award 1 star, 2 star, or 3 star completely random, no you can not drop or trade or sell secret service armor, but yes you can scrip it with legendary machine
---
I’ve failed 3 times, all the mobs appeared and the prime beast were killed but still failed the event.
---
Unlikely but, it's possible that there are so many people doing it they finish it super fast. The past few times I've done it it's been finished within a couple minutes. It could also be server lag, as you log it it may have finished a minute or two just before, so it says its still going even though it's not.
---
Who on gods green earth is still playing this failed alpha game?
---
Took me so long to realize this as well.
---
No trades, but they can be turned in for scrip.
---
Really how do you do that?
---
You only killed it's baby's the great Mothman will emerge when we need him the most.
---
Main reason I quit: the game became a over encumbering math assignment.
---
Thanks for elaborating my footnote.
---
Had that happen to me today.  It didn’t register I was there, so got no Rewards.    
---
thought it might be like some of the other events,where you don’t see a notification,but rewards still go to your inventory.
---
 No new weapons or armor, no additional t notes, and the complete event While in a group counter did not increment.
---
I think this might be a visual glitch. Happens to me when I empty a clip it seems to stop/jump back up to6 ammo left. However Im sure that I am firing a full mag as I would notice a difference in time firing each clip.
---
Do you realize what sub you're on or are you just stupid?
---
TOO MANY FUCKING TIMES it's failed at 98. I ran ore the ENTIRE FUCKING TIME. ***I can only run so fast, and the ore doesn't respawn fast enough.***
---
There are better ways to farm XP and scrip. You can both complete the event and farm it just by holding on to the ore until the end.
---
You only need ***three*** people to comfortably reach the end. Forty ore can be found per person on their first run The ores do respawn *slowly*, so two people can potentially reach the goal if they do literally nothing but run for ores, assuming the ores respawn fast enough.
---
And please don't fucking start it when there's only two people there. Fuck.
---
It's at the point that I wish Bethesda would remove the on kill XP and legendary enemies from this event.
---
You're right, only roaches can survive a direct nuclear blast. The Enclave you're talking about ended when MODUS wiped them out. We're the new improved Enclave 2.0 :) Also how can there be history when we're not finished writing it yet
---
yes my gat laser is doing this. i thought it had something to do with the power user perk since i just started using it but i dunno.
---
I just...love you.
---
Does it only cost one module or is that on top of crafting materials? And do you have the ability to craft it as much as you like as long as you have the materials or is there a limit?
---
I apologize for asking too many questions, I just want to get everything right lol
---
This right here!
---
I only put on power armor for that fight cause I keep forgetting about that drop into the mine. Pretty embarrassing to die from the fall before the fight really starts lol.
---
Yeah, it happens with my auto laser. If you melee you can shoot the last of it
---
I bought a year sub back in January. The pet month savings over the monthly rate made it worthwhile for price. I don't use private servers much, unless I'm completing a "take workshop" challenge or wanting to farm legendaries, etc. The Stash box and tent are def worth it. Having a second, free FT point that I can establish anywhere I want is great.
---
I've been drumming for 3 hours strate
---
No, melee and you can shoot those last shots. I wish it was just visual
---
Ive gotten secret service armour for completing scorched earth since the last update, so fingers crossed ill get a tenderizer at some point
---
You use one module at a time, which will randomly give a 1-3 star. No way to guarantee 3 star unfortunately. It doesn't pop up on screen what you've crafted so you have to check your inv. after every craft to see what you got. 
---
Yeah the grind is bad depending on rng. Be prepared to waste a LOT of legendary modules :)
---
You can scrip but not trade.
---
“Oh man all this free stuff is so stressful” 
---
Seriously? If it stresses you out, dont fucking do it. Its all completely bonus, free shit, nothing is forcing you to do anything other than an egotistical need to stay up to speed with all the other whiners on this sub, so you can burn through SBQ in 12 seconds and then come back and cry that your build is getting nerfed along with the other 0.05% of players that thought, for some ungodly reason, that you needed to finish all this shit 19 months before everyone else.
---
It’s a game. If you can’t learn to enjoy it, or even the free shit it gives you, why the fuck are you playing. There isn’t a competitive scene to even drive this level of neurosis, it’s all completely in your head.
---
You mind giving a little more direction? Can’t seem to find any there.
---
There's platforms to stop you dying. There is also a jetpack :)
---
There's nothing wrong on your side, forget that troll.
---
If you're on Xbox, I can mod it for you.
---
I’ve given up too. I’ve never had problems in the other meat weeks but I’ve only been able to finish 2 of 8 I’ve gone to.
---
Power armour is good for 3 things;
---
Nuke zones/radiation rumble (rads)
---
Heavy weapons (stabalised perk)
---
Being casual (can fall off cliffs, limbs never break)
---
Apart from those, 3* normal armour is better
---
Burrowing ability should be nerfed to be used only once.
---
We now return to the lair of the mischievous, evil Todd Howard as he prepares his latest weapon. The Salty Tenderizer. Harvested from the tears and anger of the Fallout community
---
Sounds like you're a little salty about it
---
A trigger would probably bring it back to being a top tier event. *If* (and it's a big if) people show up, it's a crazy xp grind, it's actually interactive, it has both unique (bear arm) and useful (arktos backpack) rewards, not to mention a legendary if you can keep an animal alive that long (and even if it does die after that, it's not like the legendary leaves). 
---
But having to wait for it to decide to come online means, more often than not, people are busy with other events (more than once someone had already started Encryptid so the timer ran down and Project Paradise auto-failed. It's not even worth it to try and solo, there's too much at once to even try filling a trough solo, let alone protect the friendlies.
---
(Not to mention the bear arm plan never seems to drop, with how infrequent Project Paradise is, the chances of getting it keep getting lower and lower)
---
Hey! I run a heavy, bloodied... Lol.
---
I don't wear power armour because when I put It on it over encumbers me massively. Then it gives me way less defence than my current armour
---
Got a mutants +40% power attack one from purveyor yesterday
---
Mt favorite weapon in the game is a explosive level action rifle and I've had a lot of nice weapons. If you got some stealth perks, you can absolutely wreck enemies on that first shot. I keep other weapons for when I need to throw a lot of bullets but the Lever Action is the day to day work horse.
---
So tired of people just looking at you thumbing down while you play the drums thinking you are AFKing. Also what if? I am doing more than you right now.
---
I thought it did, then realized I was using the wrong one smh. Mine works as of last night
---
Only shitty asshole players make trap camps. Get nuked noob.
---
Module + materials. Craft as many as you want.
---
Then if your heavy build is on point I know what I’m saying. The weapons add more but it’s the build that gives u the majority of your damage
---
Lv 62 Charred Feral Ghouls. Inordinate amount of health, high damage resistance, big damage (*with* rads on top of it), their limbs never want to break, and they're *never* alone.
---
yes the new weapons like gauss shotgun, gauss minigun, plasma caster cost 2 modules to craft, in addition to regular crafting supplies, secret service armor costs 1 module plus regular junk to craft it, and you can craft as many as you want, just need enough legendary modules I usually save up and craft 10 at a time trying to get unyielding pieces
---
I’m using the flamethrower to destroy parts of my roof to make a completely enclosed round camp...
---
Thank you! You helped me out a ton dude I really appreciate it
---
Just the hydro it takes to power a gaming system &amp; TV for the time required to achieve that, costs more than the game itself.
---
You can't argue about the game being garbage in every way?
---
Awesome thanks for the clarification
---
Dont forget freezing and crashing in the ash heap.
---
No one ever wants to try and keep all three friendly beasts alive. They all hang around one. The worst I saw was when they had two alive then everyone swarmed the sheepsquatch and the friendlies died event failed. All for a chance to get a one star nocturnal tire iron.
---
No prob mate.
---
Ha as soon as the dubble score started I finished it so I miss out
---
You literally are history. Brush up on your Fallout lore.
---
It's safe to assume there will be balance changes in the future. Don't assume you know what those changes will be.
---
I always thought a public test server was to test for bugs and get them out before the release
---
Absolutely, I keep a vamps .50 for tanking, still gets the job done, just eats a few more bullets.
---
The amount of weight I am carrying. None of it was broken. It sorted itself out though after I logged out and back in.
---
The idea is to make YOU salty and it seems to work pretty well 😁 Just kidding... it makes no sense.
---
ROCK “salt”
---
Thanks anyways, I'll do some research
---
I think you need brush up actually, this game takes place 200 years before any of the other ones. Also I was talking through RP terms so..yea none of that has happened yet. MODUS wiped out Eckhart and Co, then started recruiting Vault 76ers. I find it funny that you think they are green and helpless, considering they are supposed to be the best of the best to rebuild Appalachia. I really urge you to go brush up on Fallout 76 lore.
---
War Glaive, it has a bunch of gold bullion mods so I assume you buy it from Regs, the plasma blade sounds pretty cool.
---
Strip all the storaged weapons to default, make armors also ultra-light do helps, it should be quite easy to mod it when you wants to use it
---
Well, it was what I thoughts anyway, the fact is it helped a little then new things got inside lol
---
I also have so many random plans that I kinda wants to hang for 30ish caps at once but due to the 0.25lb/piece I just can't fit them in :&lt;
---
I just got this to drop I was so excited.  it's one if my fav head pieces
---
People make assumptions, and there are folks who think this event is "too hard". You're probably best off without them (probably expect you to do all the heavy lifting too).
---
That, or they were trying to provoke a gang war. 
---
- brought to you by the Excavator Gang
---
Yeah I noticed a few people doing that. Clueless people who should be running over to the spits to see if there is a spot and actually contribute imho! 
---
Hopefully these threads will spread the info. I'll take a server with some fully afk people on those 6 spots then one without anyone on them. Or people thinking it makes them look "lazy or afk" so they stand around then all rush to do the same thing.
---
Nice I’ve just got a good secret service chest after 20 try’s crafting them but I haven’t got them form the queen drop yet but I’ve gotten a good meat hook out of the queen
---
I carry excavator for litterally no reason
---
Look at the sub, its a lot of people talking about how garbage it is. And you said that no one plays it, not that its trash
---
That looks so cute!! 😆
---
The end even has part of one of those floating naval mines on it.
---
Mole rats with the bombs attached.
---
Just have to find one f-ing grenade 😖
---
I’ve seen them multiple times. Also seen the letter and signs twice but mirror ball once. Which I’m glad I grab when I did
---
Meh, I have a t-65 set (so the best radiation wise) and the tunnels would still kill me in a minute.
---
I do get what you're saying for the CSS, but even the best power armour doesn't properly shield you in thoses tunnels.
---
Oh nice! Id hold on to that for now
---
level 62 charred feral ghouls and their insta radworm face raping.
---
It does stack with perks. But only to 90% combined. So if U got 5 pieces forget the perks. If u have 2 u mint need a perky boost lol.
---
Thanks for not giving me time to hand in 15 prime meat, bastards. lol
---
Lost 7500 on Thursday between daily and weekly. Happened the day prior to my teammate. Only thing in common it seems is that we were transitioning on the map while reset occurred. Anecdotal but irritating.
---
For meat week im just using it to wallop squirrels anyway
---
Spit &gt; drums, but still do both.
---
OTOH, I’m in excavator, (Otherwise overencumbered), thus comparatively relatively low RR.
---
  What I do have is a FSS ghoul slayer switchblade that one hits any ghoul under L50, and generally 2 hits anything else.  
---
I make it my role to pick a worker and make sure he does not die, as the event also fails if all the workers are dead....
---
Name dropping and shit is insta suspension.
---
Have fun.
---
This is going to be removed by mods because you named names brah.
---
Oh, uh yeah... rp... uh well you're entire rp faction will be rp history in 200 rp years
---
Edit: I can rp see in the future from all the chems I do cuz I'm an rp raider
---
Breaking the rules. No witch-hunting
---
The range on this "shotgun" is idiotic. It is already an "explosive" energy weapon, does it really need the range of scoped lever action?
---
There's a rule in this subreddit about no witch hunting.
---
Also lol, fucking foodie complaining on reddit about trap camps and an item he's too broke to obtain. Typical.
---
Didn't know that, thanks for the info going to head for those then they seem to get neglected more often.
---
The defense stat doesn't take into account PA's innate damage resist which is 48% on top of it's displayed  DR. It's likely you would take less damage in PA really.
---
Now I wouldn't discriminate, unarmed builds are great and I have 2 characters who don't use PA ever as their theme.
---
Just correcting a falsehood.
---
Try a Troubleshooters weapon.  Great results against bots. And power armor will help you a lot, too.
---
AA is second choice for bots.
---
I want to add those two now just cause they sound pretty cool.
---
You sure they weren't molerats that simply dug away? Can't be sure with all those drugs around.
---
They were in FO2 if I remember. I hope not, they were tough as heck...
---
They are eliminating all duplicate cards eg if you have four lvl 1 gunslingers you lose 3.
---
The only part about this comment I don't agree with is:
---
" Nothing Bethesda can do. It’s been going on for a long time and nothing has been done about it. "
---
Yes, they can. They may not know where the problem is or how the problem is caused, but they can most definitely investigate and fix it. They have not done this. There are bugs that modders fixed in previous titles that Beth never fixed.
---
More enemy variety the better in my opinion
---
This should be allowed, he isn't accusing them of doing anything against any rules. Just a psa about raiders in the wasteland.
---
 There's always at least 1 person afk on them in the servers I'm in on Xbox. I afk when I'm asleep.
---
Only gotten one of those so far but I got recipe: tato salad and grills for days.
---
Wonder what I need to do to get the plan to drop. Pray to the meat god? Just getting the cow costume and chef costume on repeat.
---
I have all of those but the problem is that even at 90% reduction you're still carrying about 100% since you can't/shouldn't put it in your stash.
---
I got the plan, what makes it so good as a wep?
---
Probably by the third season lmao.
---
Wait it's failing for people, I barely have time to turn in meat before it finishes
---
Where do I make the downpayment on this fine property? :)
---
"It's for you".
---
I'm going to try that tonight, hopefully the server doesn't die out. It helps so much no one should even bat an eye at any afkers on this event.
---
Hey I was actually having fun with our back and forth at first, I don't know why you had to get so salty and start attacking me. I kinda figured people would think this is an RP thread since yknow..there's no such thing as Enclave in real life and I'm not a part of it. I know what I'm talking about, I'm a big Fallout fan and I'm sure you are too but you are just incorrect. Have a great day
---
Pretty much unfortunately, im sure there a 2nd meat week planned as an atlas reward, so you'll get another chance this year if you dont get it this week
---
This dude reeks of foodbuild
---
The Daily Ops are new repeatable Dailies planned for the next patch which tie into the arrival of the BoS.  Basically, it picks a random location (from a list), a random type of enemy, and gives those enemies some kind of gameplay twist.  Like being cloaked except when attacking, having infinite Perception so you can't sneak, only being vulnerable to melee, etc.  And you have to complete a small objective.  The faster you do it, the better the reward you'll get.
---
One combination, for example, is fighting robots in Valley Galleria who have infinite Perception and who require melee to destroy.
---
These encounters are also capped off with a unique boss NPC.  For example, there's a heavily-armored Assaultron that has the Sentry Bot's gun arms.
---
It's pretty fun stuff, but difficult.
---
I had time to feed chally, add wood, turn in 15 prime and gather two greens.  And I was one of the six on the drums/spits. I might start with the prime meat. But 30 second completion is awesome.
---
Quite correct, but the relevant is that they were engineered to die out by no later than 2247, so they supposedly can’t appear in games taking place in later years, but that is not a problem for FO76:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wanamingo
---
I've had at least 3 fail because I was the only one on the drums / spit during timer and then very few people even showed. Very frustrating trying to do it all as the meter slowly dwindles away.
---
I should have clarified better.  I keep forgetting some people are simple and can not extrapolate information so I should really spell it all out for them. So thank you for your input.
---
Cazadores too?
---
Go into the game settings, it will be an option under display
---
I'll check it out thanks
---
Haha :)
---
Basically, the spits make you lose points if left unattended.
---
It crashed my X at first, but not the OG. So I reduced the resolution on the x and vola, no more crashes.
---
RAIDERS?! IN A FALLOUT GAME? REALLY?
---
but seriously he broke no witch hunting rules.
---
Hopefully I’ll spot your camp, am on PC as well
---
Like other dude said, you can move it fine.
---
That said, your spawn point in camp is always north of the device, random area and maybe 20 feet away. Use that knowledge to find a good way to spawn the place you want
---
My suggestion on both of your issues - Tesla rifle. It’ll jump to hit them, so no aim required.
---
Does empath require you to be next to your other teammate or does just being in a team with others work?
---
PA is about flair, big mech suit flair. And rad resist
---
I have a 3\* L50 AA fixer.  I think a lot of How well it performs is how you use it.
---
For example, L40 Glowing mole miners.  IIRC, it takes about 1k damage to kill one. 
---
If I hip fire when detected, I might get about 90 damage.  Thats with tank killer3, glowsight3, and 1 each of the 3 auto/semiauto rifle perks.
---
But if I am not detected, use the scope, and head shot them, it becomes a 1 shot, 1 kill weapon. 
---
Undetected and scoped, torso shots will hit for around 500.
---
*Welcome the return of democracy, the return of the Enclave* 
---
which one is it you're welcoming? those two are mutually exclusive.
---
Are they only eliminating level 1s? Cause I have a lvl3 of one, but I also have a lvl2 I now use..
---
They don’t even have to hit you sometimes. Just radiation damage is enough (looking at you, glowing ones and scorchbeats).
---
It should be 1000 at least, but probably more like 1200. And the level cap for SPECIAL points should be 60.
---
Mirelurk queen/king but honestly anything with poison. It's got no Dr and eats me.
---
Nice one! ign same as reddit
---
When I trigger Encryptid, I don’t care who shows up...I will solo because I can.
---
https://odealo.com/articles/how-to-build-characters-in-fallout-76-best-builds-included
---
For instance I am a junkie/bloody build. A lot of people play as bloodied. When you see people with little health and high rads, that's a good indication they are bloodied. If you look at the stats of each legendary, it'll kind of tell you what to do. Bloodied weapons get extreme amounts of damage the lower your health. So you could have high health and no rads and be using a bloodied weapon and it doesn't do crap. The second your health starts going down, the stronger that weapon gets. I have a bloodied shotgun that does about 400 damage because my health is low. I have a high sneak and usually one shot in sneak while bloodied does the trick.
---
I enjoy the increased mobility outside of PA.
---
And if you are gonna trade with Grahm after the event buy or sell and get the F out. So annoying when people do their inventory management/weapon inspection etc on a vendor and not in their pip.
---
Johnny 5 is alive.
---
It really fucking sucks when everyone's sneaking. I have to tank all the spawns and bosses at the same time. Help the tank out ffs. Get a power armor and take some hits or pull some aggro or kill those spawns. Nobody's doing that they just go for bosses
---
I agree if you are hip firing.
---
using a scope is much better for TSE’s
---
Try using it while not in Power Armor.
---
Hm. Durability damage per hit.. No wonder my shotgun breaks so fast.
---
Need input! More input!
---
If you melee while reloading it cancels. Helps keep me from getting a dozen of differently charged cores
---
Makes sense, like the brush fires and random piles. Thanks again! Hopefully lots of people see all of this info and spread the word :)
---
Seems like a lot think every event is too hard. Imagine playing a game where you actually have to research the boss fight before you play. I'm an ex WoW junkie.
---
Without having testing it, I don’t think anyone would know. Hell, I didn’t realize it and I make and sell serums daily. They’re just downvoting because they think you’re wrong.
---
Okay so 1. 
---
Fallout 76 isn't Canon
---
And 2. 
---
Even if it was, it doesn't somehow undo the Enclaves inevitable demise.
---
And 3 
---
Nice edit without tagging it. I can tell you REALLY care about how you appear on this sub
---
Its hard carrying 30k of Ultracite 2mm. But I need it for my gauss minigun. Even batteries included isn’t enough. The weight of ammo needs to be reduced or something like man. Either that or decrease the weight of junk in our stash.
---
My main is AFK on drums all day while im at work😁
---
You're supposed to find a diseased mirelurk spawn
---
No that would add another thing to the list and then it would look bad besides not everyone uses serums
---
Hol up
---
You can't be wearing pants.
---
Yup, I read an article once about it, it's that rare.
---
Bro they were.
---
Don't forget class freak and strange in numbers.
---
Someone that's not only still playing fallout 76 but playing it enough to complain about other players, just told me, get this, that I'm stupid.  Imagine that shit.
---
I was naked.
---
Can't wait for them to pop out of the ground and nibble on my ankles and give me a disease.
---
Like I went through so many stims just sitting there naked waiting.
---
Don't wear power armor at the ammo converter.
---
This. Radscorpions are the assholes of the wasteland
---
Radscorps for sure
---
It was 😂. I was nervous it was taken the wrong way and I don't like doing /s.
---
Huh okay will make an edit. I personally haven't played them but know the plots and most of the lore. I have tried playing the first one but the game play weren't for me.
---
I came back to the only locked door in my camp unlocked and open with the lock gone. I assume it was picked and not a glitch/bug since it was left open by whoever picked it. I suppose it could've bug disappeared first and then been opened by a passerby but it's an empty greenhouse dome you can see there's nothing inside of and no one ever wasted time going in before I put the lock on the door.
---
That's ah funny way of spelling floaters there fella.
---
If you learn the plan it gives you the chance to roll a legendary from the purveyor as well as event rewards but even a normal non legendary hits pretty hard.. i had my basic one pushing nearly 1k damage, to me thats pretttyyy good.. and its just a cool unique weapon in general in my opinion
---
I've finished the legendary run on both my accounts now so I go and pick the ore. I wait til the last min to put the ore in though because the moment deathclaws, floaters and crickets show up, everyone panics and then all the named scabs insta die.
---
Right. I was just curious because I was under the assumption that if someone picks a lock in your camp you would be alerted.
---
Show this to my wife (not a gamer) and she said "WOW! That looks real". All I can say is awesome job bud
---
The communist handmade skin is pretty close to the Chinese assault rifle. I think it’s type 93 model according to the fallout wiki page.
---
The communist pack is back in the atomic shop this week too. Not sure if you can get the weapon skin by itself or not though. Look under the skins menu
---
You don't have room behind the station. Move it out from the wall a bit, you'll be fine
---
Edit: ah, somebody got there first.
---
Thanks very much!
---
Yeah I learned it asap, just haven't gotten one. Looking guard to it. Thanks
---
I used to grab all 3 on my bloodied and burn through my stimpacks but I stopped for the same reasons you said, why should I go through all the effort if others want all the reward with no effort. Now I only grab 1 once or twice to see if others are willing to help unless I see the host trying in which case I'll help them, its a bit depressing sometimes to see pylons then go untouched sometimes and all these high level characters throwing no emotes like they are entitled to it, these scrubs are usually the ones in sneak who quite clearly have an abundance of healing items
---
Yeah, there are just too many players AFKing during the event. I saw a player run in and take a seat next to the critter chunk cart.
---
Like seriously, if you want to AFK, do it right, get on the Drums and Spits. That's all. I don't care if you AFK the entire day, just Drum or Spin the Spits. That's all anyone could ask for.
---
People really suck at this event. I've learned to run it solo although my bloodied build is not the best for it
---
If they removed XP and legendaries you'd be doing that event by yourself every time because no one else would show up.
---
XP is why the vast majority of people do that event. It's not the players fault there are so few places and events that have that many things to kill.
---
Same here. I have a crappy set of Troubleshooter armor and a decent Vampire handmade and just manage it alone whenever I can.
---
Looks really badass
---
I'd run a B25 LMG on my heavy gunner
---
Just tried a level 35 Instigating double barrel, killed everything in Charleston Building in 1 shot a piece in VATS. So Instigating is still magic I guess.
---
Radscorpion. 
---
Shot
---
Dip
---
Off radar
---
Up 
---
If you aren't in a nuke zone, running heavy guns or mining ore the regular armor is usually better. I've got 1 character that runs PA for heavy weapons and the rest armor normal armor. The guy just had his head up his ass.
---
Try giving yourself as many endurance penalties as possible and being in water if possible.    Even then, you’d have better odds getting elder PA paint to drop from forbidden knowledge than you do catching the woopsies.
---
Taken from your link:
---
„Wanamingos appear in Fallout 2 and are to appear in the Fallout 76 content update One Wasteland For All.“
---
I can't wait to see some crazy rolls hit the market! Exciting. Enjoy
---
I have 2 endurance by default lmao
---
That’s just insane dude
---
I never said I was sneaking. Im unarmed so more often then not I'll run up and hit it
---
97 now. I will have it this double weekend!
---
You're not nearly at max sneak with that loadout. Also missing Escape Artist so you make a ton of noise while sneaking
---
While I agree, that will never happen because that will require Bethesda to think about us first and business second.
---
This just happened to me today. The drums and spits were full before the event started. I managed to pick up 2 piles and the event was finished just like that.
---
Somebody said months ago that being super irradiated helps, but I don’t see how it would.   I only know two people who’ve managed to catch it.
---
There were eyebots there for me a couple of times before, no nukes involved.
---
Your probably thinking about the liberty prime skin. Which makes it look like they have Tesla coils but they don't function aside from looking cool.
---
I had eyebots. trying to grind some sweet ghoul xp and got a bunch of level 1 eyebots smh
---
What about low food and water though?
---
Can you just stop? You're commenting on a post in a subreddit full of people playing Fallout 76 enough to complain about whatever they want about the game. You're just being dumb and toxic.
---
I believe it, done the event 20 times still no tenderiser  or costume just a stack of hats, grill and backpack plans
---
Let your food and hydration run right down. I think one of those gives you some disease immunity. Basically you need to unequip/negate anything that gives you disease immunity including perks and armor. Reduce it further with the Radaway. I did it by Ohio River Adventures with just one diseased mirelurk spawn and it didnt take tooo long
---
I’ve been selling serums pretty well at 350. Treasure maps at 30. Junk also just flies. Bulk for 5-10 caps. Scrap mostly 1 cap. Can’t keep stuff in stock. But if I raise it at all... Nothing.
---
I have never gotten an alert telling me a player is picking a lock, stealing from me or anything else I don't think at either a camp or workshop. I'm not even sure I've gotten an alert about someone contesting my workshop unless I'm currently on site.
---
That being said this game is imperfect. I've looked at my map and seen events going on (including seasonal) that I didn't get an alert about when I usually do. Dunno if that's a bug or just a "you don't get an engraved invitation to every event". Also I'm super casual and have ADD so it's also always possible I just miss things, but the likelihood I've missed every single one of only that type of alert seems unlikely, but do always take anything I say with a big ol grain of salt.
---
Right? lol.  The first one I fast traveled to it completed as soon as  I arrived.
---
That may help.   Might also try assigning raw food to your quickwheel and eating it while being attacked by diseased mirelurk spawn.   Any roll the game makes for disease is a chance.
---
Don't tell someone how to play the game. His priorities are his and yours are yours and you should respect that.
---
Tell me about it. Why should people be rewarded for going so fast, whether properly or improperly? 
---
I’m sure we will see them 100s if times, just like the “darn autocomplete hit me today”? 🙄
---
After the last 3 times I've done it and every single person has just stayed up top killing mobs with me being the only one running to get ore it starting to get frustrating. They need to make the ore respawn quicker once you collect it all
---
These are really bad at lower levels, but you will learn running right at them as you shoot pretty much destroys them and they miss most of their shots. Just be sure and backup before they explode. 
---
It is even better if you come across a shotgun. Almost all can be 1 shotted with all levels of those.
---
Yes the gauss shitgun is way overpowered. It really needs to be nerf. To console players its equivalent to hackers in a pc game. We have no kind of defense from it or any other explosives. We have marine armor that helps protect u from bullets but not for the gauss shitguns and v.a.t.s.grenades. These will all one shot u.  I'm am lvl 378 and pretty much stopped playing because of all of the explosives.
---
I’ll have to take a rad x for that one I have carnivore as a mutation lol
---
Well the idea behind a Public Test Server is that they are testing features and fine tuning them before they hit live. So most likely, they will hit live in /some/ form.  How much they morph before then is always up in the air, and once in awhile a feature proves untenable and gets tossed.  The Legendary Perks though, I don't see that getting scrapped.
---
First time you get both of the Crater Dailies.  After that you only get that one or the one from Wren.  Not both.
---
I hope that answers your question.
---
&gt; If you want drops do the ore
---
The problem is if you're the only one doing ore then you're not going to get to rank 3 for the rewards
---
I was around level 300 before I ever got it 😂
---
Yes. Buff the deathclaws while they're at at. And some one bring me my God damn Centaur. Snallygasters ain't freaky enough.
---
I believe you need rank 3 for the rewards
---
block of rock salt
---
No. 70s-80s monochrome fixed width font terminals in general. Green was a popular colour though those at my first job were orange - much easier on the eye.
---
I didn't say it was off-limits, but that really wasn't a complaint about the technical issues of the game, that was more "I can't be bothered to spend an extra 30 seconds to walk over from vault 76"
---
You telling me people actually manage to fail that?
---
So you run this with full health I’m assuming? What kind of armor? Vanguard or?
---
Do you know the formula for determining the cost?
---
Where can I pick up the plans for those vertical bars?
---
damn they really changed it? i used to be able to complete both when i was doing the raiders
---
With meat week I'm sitting with about 200 honey in my inventory. Never have to collect honey again for that daily.
---
thanks for the response i appreciate it
---
I didn't know I was supposed to do the event for you. PS4? My apologies.
---
I thought mine sold for like more than the vendor even has?
---
I do this every time now, it's been spread well. Still haven't got the chally outfit only the mask 6 times...
---
Don't tell someone how to treat others. 
---
And I didnt tell them *how* to play the game, i simply stated the priorities they have are bad. 
---
Also don't assume gender.
---
Not sure they're plans? Check the bottom of the stair section
---
Man that sounds awesome. Thanks for the overview!
---
But if there aren't 8 players all running around looking for that last squirrelwhile running past the decomposed piles and greens, it's destined to fail! /s
---
Go gather dirty water.   Drink toxic goo.   Shoot my feet with a gamma gun.   Use a radiation barrel.   I usually just ignore it.   It falls back into that range easily enough on its own if you're out and about in the Wasteland.
---
The sound they make is annoying. 
---
If you use explosives, specially if you're bloodied, you can die trying to kill the demon bastards.
---
Don’t deposit until you do all 4 tunnels either
---
Yep. I think if someone sees a high level there, they are more likely to go
---
I just get into the water.
---
Take my upvote
---
Cave crickets... but at least they drop acid.
---
Least we don't have a mountaintop grenade shot everywhere
---
Week of meat
---
Oh so I’m not crazy that actually does count before it starts.
---
Could not agree more! The people who want to afk the right way are a huge help on this event, not a major hindrance like they were on Fasnacht. I'm to the point now if I don't see a few afk on those spots I get worried of another pointless fail :(
---
Can confirm.   That’s why I put tesla coils on my liberty prime PA.   Got tired of seeing them do nothing.
---
Trust me you're lucky to have not encountered it yet, it is beyond frustrating!
---
Don't get me wrong I love both games and I recently have been grinding on both games with the meat week event and curated gnawing hunger. Really love content added to both games
---
Too many chickenshits who either don’t know what to do or just don’t want to contribute. Won’t waste my ammunition or stimpaks
---
Still can't get the chally outfit 😂😂 got the mask 6 times
---
Why does he need tea in the first place? He can’t drink it.
---
Go for it!
---
More like a straight jacket. :)
---
What?
---
not the lvl 76 ones. I zoidberg the f away from them, even in power armor.
---
This is a bug but this is a good thing.
---
Bear with me. If you carry around spoiled veggies around you can spawn them till you catch parasites which just reduce your hunger...but then you can just keep eating your spoiled veggies.
---
Fun fact that after catching a disease, you become immune to catching new ones for 30min and the same one for 45. So you basically become immune to the nastier stuff.
---
Unfortunately, this means that stacking 4 diseases is almost impossible. However, even at max damage you're only doing 32 damage per second. Which is almost nothing.
---
However! This means that you're automatically tagging nearby enemy's every second FOR FREE.
---
You'll passively increase your loot and exp while being immune to diseases. All you have to do is carry around spoiled veggies.
---
If that event is on, I put on my stealth suit, crouch and grab all three of the pylons. I use med ex and a load of stim packs plus the first aid perk card to keep me alive but nothing attacks me because of the stealth. I let the others deal with the imposter which means I miss out on the legendary but at least get the event to complete and have those rewards.
---
I do this because if I don't grab all 3 pylons, nobody else does and the event fails. If I grab all 3, the event has always been a success, even with half the people standing around at least 1 person will fight it.
---
I still think most people have no idea how to run the event so after dying a few times hug the outskirts hoping someone else will do it.
---
I N D E E D
---
Good ol RNG! There are quite a few traders on the market sub that would swap outfit for mask. Good time to get acquainted with it and raise some sub karma in the process as well. Only place I trade in this game and if done right extremely safe.
---
Yes thanks OP. I was in the same boat.
---
Yeah I gotta see if I can get a B25 .50 or LMG. ACP is amazing for us heavy gunner builds since we can sustain our ammo
---
my pump action 40% bash damage seems to still be working on PS4
---
Since you can easily hit level 50 in less than a week Id say go for it if you enjoy the game.
---
I think the ammo counter is bugged with certain weapons. Handmade, fixer, and the gatling laser seem to do it often.
---
Nope. With max charisma and/or hard bargain you can get 500 each from the robots. I pass off tons of them to my mules and sell them every day.
---
At this point i think its a myth. I will not believe the tales of this fabled "event" any further. Speak your lies elsewhere BETHESDA; if that is your real name!
---
Thank you meaty fish
---
Meat. Week.
---
A lot of players seem to thing it’s a music event or a shooting event instead of each person doing something different. When it’s done right it completes quickly. I’ve learned to wait before putting my meat on the grill. Lost too many hard earned meats
---
I will trade you the grill plan for the backpack
---
A B Plasma Caster prints ammo
---
Finally melee are gonna get some love too.
---
Well, I'm ticked off.  
---
And no. Bethesda has yet to address these issues.  And I don't think they care.
---
Lady dev said that they recently put someone to work on fixing broken challenges like this. Couple days ago someone was complaining about this as well when someone linked her there.
---
Cant test it personally, but there was a pretty popular post that was posted sometime this week. He said something upon the lines of Bloodied only be 2x - 1.5x as strong 
---
No idea if that was just an example, an exaggeration, or a lie. But this might be more useful than no answer
---
Wym prints?
---
Interesting. Depending on what things look like post-patch i might have to try this out for sure. I just hope they start taking in feedback now &amp; slightly buffing things BEFORE they release it to the public. I feel like it’ll be a situation where they say now with addititive damage they can make balances easier but balances never come &amp; we just get stuck with a huge nerf
---
Huh. Funny how all the psycho cultists refer to these “baby” mothmen as the real thing
---
2 shots to kill Wendigo spawn, get 26 back
---
That's what I thought with Fasnacht. But holy shit did it go down, slowly but still went down.
---
They probably aren’t fixing it so they can make more money off of people buying atoms if they fix them they lose atom sales because you’ll be able to get them for free
---
They're usually three same ones who complain there's no challenging end game content.
---
Rubber band and controller plugged into power source so the camera rotates. Walk away for hours and collect the rewards. Unless the server crashes but that never happens...
---
Pretty sure they are under aid.
---
Wait so how does the game calculate ammo to give back?
---
Or just make scrapping cards speed things up. So you'd get 1 every level then your cards also give you one. Effectively the same thing but a happy medium.
---
 I've got an anti armor work bashing damage.  I through on a piece of damage resist while blocking as well.
---
I only had a minute to try it.  I wanted to check before i spent too much time trying to make something happen.
---
Maybe he's embracing the stereotype British shit they programmed him with.
---
Despite contrary belief, I'm British and ain't that fucking obsessed for tea.
---
Full set of unyielding and kill shit
---
Who gonna eat the meat? Grahm
---
Or random "maintenance" timer in the middle of the night on a weekend. I always get a laugh out of those.
---
Seems about right.  The last few I’ve been at, I was the conduit for all 3 pylons.
---
I don't care what you do in this event as long as you don't nope out in the middle to go collect prime meat.
---
By foundation there’s a pond go there kill everything but the mirelurk spawns and sit there while a diseased one hits you takes about 5 minutes but sludge lung seems to be glitched for some people
---
isn't unyielding a legendary perk?
---
It runs a Leveled list based on your ammo type. Conveniently, the plasma list is based on the regular plasma gun.w
---
Would be an interesting addition. They were underground creatures in FO2 and there’s certainly plenty of underground places in 76. Their lore/origins were pretty gray, so it seems doable. I’m all for a new enemy, especially if they’re as tough as they were in FO2.
---
Floaters are the absolute worst!!
---
It's been proven that Beth' CS has permission and the ability to refund atoms, heck, even if the the plaintiff has requested a refund several times and it's obvious a scam, CS has granted the refund.
---
And yet here, where the evidence is plain, they refuse?
---
Also concerning PCI... this is to protect the customer's data to be handed out to a third party, not to the customer himself.
---
Just imagine you asking a local vendor what you bought last week and he tells you that he can't answer that, citing the same shit CS did here.
---
Ive played the primal cuts near flatwoods 3 times and it did not finish all others have though.
---
I would like an LOL emote.  Some people do really funny things in the game and I don’t have a mic, so it’s hard to express
---
Ok so how much would .50 be?
---
And somehow find a way to clip into whatever you hooked it to or not fully seat on the edge of whatever connected to or have some other major graphical error.  But yeah this is a pretty sweet idea
---
I much prefer it on PC. More stable &amp; higher frame rates &amp; stability in my experience. Both my ps4 &amp; pc have the game installed on SSD but the pc seems to load faster.
---
You'll see posts talking about how hacking &amp; whacky weapons are rampant but in nearing 1000 hours I've yet to see any of this happening blatantly in adventure. I don't play NW however so can't speak to that.
---
This. I actually enjoy doing stuff when it’s something like fashnacht or meat week
---
Oh my gosh 👀 I saw the same thing. A bunch of radscorpion eggs and sheepsquatch hide just fell out of nowhere. I was like wtf happened here 🤕
---
a fixer =0 It's a combat rifle but better
---
hunting rifle is nice if there's 1 or 2 enemies.
---
If you're on xbone i can make you one.

Event team is better when you just afk for events. I just sit at meetweek area. 2x exp is much better then a couple more Int.
---
Right on! Wanna play?
---
I thought salt was NaCl. I must be missing a joke here or something. Lol.
---
Ah that would also be a good one.
---
Different strokes for different folks
---
Joking aside: not everyone plays at peak efficiency. Yes Building team is the best, then switching to event near the end of whatever event is peak XP efficiency. 
---
But who cares? Let people play how they want
---
Since I finished the Legendary Run I don’t really care about XP and I’m not farming it. I’ve been starting events teams because when I jump on I’m really just doing Meat Week stuff and the occasional Earle murder. I figure it tells people what I’m doing.
---
Agree with all worst enemies mentioned already. Will just add that Mirelurk Kings and Yogi bears in groups are the worst when they pin ya (thinking of you vault 94) or bounce ya around like a pinata and ya can't reload your weapon quick enough
---
I used to only grab one pylon but I’ve seen more people just not do the event other than kill stuff so I started just going full tank and grab all of them at once and just lead the assaultron around to let ppl kill it it seems to make people actually participate
---
Been having a hard time coaxing myself on lately, I think the legendary run has me burnt out : /
---
If I do get around to it I'll send you a DM on here though!
---
Events boost for the bbq is arguably better. Then switch to building after.
---
You’re right, it used to be pretty useful in some older Battlefields. I play BF5 now and I get suppression assists a lot but I was just thinking the other day that I’m not sure what it’s doing to players since I don’t seem to notice suppression effects on myself.  I recall in BF4 it would blur my screen enough for me to stop what I was doing and hide until it stopped, but there’s not much of that going on in 5.
---
after months of searching and watching every YouTube video I could find, you sir are the only one who appears to know this
---
I’ll take a handmade and submachine gun over a gauss any day.
---
They should try playing the unfinished but, awesome game Bright Memory or Hellblade. I felt like Hellblades auto adjusting combat system actually worked pretty well. It even felt to adjust just right when I was having a bad day and, playing terribly. The puzzles did seem a bit easy though.
---
the people on xbox are completely braindead lol. all they do is sit around to kill critters
---
If you only logged into complete the season, it seems like you don’t like the actual game and should play something else.
---
Those challenges are broken for nearly 2 years now, every time it comes up I try to get valseek and ladydevann into the thread.
---
This week has been iirc the 5. or 6. time one of them said they'll inform the devs.
---
It's not that I don't believe they are forwarding the issue, I've just come to the conclusion that the devs are ignoring them.
---
Meat week?!?!
---
A fixer huh?  I haven't seen that one yet.  Guessing from your comment that it's a crafted variant.  Thanks for the offer but I'm on PC, (xbox game pass)
---
This seems to be a problem with pretty much every popular event I can't even get the event icon to highlight.  No I'm not trying to add everybody there as a friend I'm trying to join the event.
---
I like this.
---
I wear power armor because it's one of the iconic things about fallout, and I have good build for it and too many fusion cores.
---
I love my thumps
---
Marsupial is a life saver- the number of times I've been able to jump up on a roof or something... Marsupial will save your bacon.
---
Certain builds go very well with PA like heavy gunner but certain builds like stealth commando don’t do well with it because PA is loud and hard to stealth in. That one dude sounded extremely dumb because I would take a unarmed build or a stealth commando build any day in my team because the dmg output even tho it’s hard to stealth with PA HG builds in your team because they attract everything and are loud
---
Yeah a good idea. Maybe the trigger could be power up two nuclear power plants? Then it could be a team effort where a group of 4 divided i 2 to speed up the grind.
---
But the down side with this that we also have encrypted and nuclear trigger. Yesterday I launched a nuke to start the colossal problem. But 10 seconds before the blast one started encrypted and on top of that we have there were prime meat and a meat cook. All the stuff went on at the same time. And the whole map was at the prime meat and meat cook.
---
I hope the lvl 250 something soloed the encrypted he started because I soloed the colossal problem but it's more fun to have people around 🤣
---
Ya each wave of scorched nets me like 2k+ exp if I hit them all.
---
👍🏻
---
I have a room where they can stay already setup.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/GwcjZYm.png](https://i.imgur.com/GwcjZYm.png)
---
Mine does this too. Had 50+ Ultracite fusion cores with under 100 rounds in each last week. Was annoying
---
I'd rather it be like that than waste up to 20 minutes on something that nobody else cares about completing. Ending it early would be a mercy.
---
The question is how high a priority is the social aspect?
---
Friendlist on the PC is not working, and there is no surrounding framework to text or chat with someone not in the game.
---
Some things should just be unlimited
---
sweat meat treat
---
God I love being an ore whore
---
One of the things I've never wrap my head around in the fallout series is how we can have lots of tec meaning like robots, fusion generators synths, you name it but for some reason no one has constructed a working vehicle of any kind.  The closest we had was the monorail in New Vegas which if you zoomed out was really just a hat on an NPC.
---
I recommend the professional drinker perk (I think that’s what it’s called?). You can drink all you want without becoming addicted. So the Sweetwater’s Special Blend basically becomes my water lol.
---
Neat! [https://i.imgur.com/13qM61m.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/13qM61m.jpg)
---
Then don't go at all? No reason to want to ruin it for other people. They are enjoying it. You aren't. So don't go.
---
Use VATS
---
And a Spicy Mod
---
Say whaaaaaaa....
---
Teach me, master.
---
You run through your ammo normally. It partially reloads your gun as soon as you run out and it starts the animation. It's been a bug for the past two or three updates
---
Np save some atoms when they pop back into the atom shop.
---
Love Grahm's dulcet tones
---
It’s a visual glitch you will empty your core and it will sometimes go to a random number but your core is empty
---
That’s it?
---
Put on the extra carry leg mods. Perfect for loading up and waddling out.
---
This! During fascnat it was annoying seeing afk people at least this event they can help. Playing the instruments during the parade did nothing
---
Gorgeous!  I love the white outer walls!
---
https://youtu.be/HTZMHMd1wBs
---
Watch and learn....
---
Oh man. Thank you so much. Why the fuck would they be under stairs? I never even thought to look.
---
Interestingly, they leave huge gaps between floor sections, and don't play well with concrete foundations at all. Still happy to have them though, thanks man.
---
This reminds me of the novels I read where the MC says something then people around him acts like theres some great wisdom in the words and decipher them. Lol
---
We will get in and it just won’t have any enemies or something stupid
---
I am not a PA build and that’s one of the things that draws me in every now and then.
---
Please no, I beg you
---
You could try an exorcism on your console...
---
I am a pack rat, and I am usually in excavator armor on my heavy gunner. I absolutely melt from radiation in those tunnels in excavator armor. Anyone else have this issue, is my armor bugged? Or, am I missing something. I know it is not the best for radiation, but damn I melt fast.
---
Yeah but the second I put it on I get more over encumbered
---
3-7, for both standard and ultracite. Based off Hunting rifle, it seems
---
CS sent me an evaluation survey. Just thought I'd share my offer of how they should be responding to customers instead of taking 8 emails each way not properly reading what I am writing and being kind of rude/non sensical. I told them they could have easily kept me as a customer had they simply treated me better and responded in a manner such as this:  
---
"Hello! Thank you for contacting us about your issue. We have taken the time to look into it and have noted we have listed as your past few purchases as X, Y, and Z. Unfortunately it does not look like your purchase of the Bunker Bundle went through properly despite what showed up on your client's side and for that we apologize. We would like to assure you though that that your Atom values match before and after each of the previously mentioned purchases so you were not charged the Atoms for the Bunker Bundle. Your current Atom value of XXXX is indeed correct. Thank you once again for contacting us so we could look into this matter for you to make sure that everything was correct. If there is anything else we can do for you do not be afraid to ask. We hope you have a great day and continue to enjoy your experiences in Fallout 76!"  
---
^This says my past few purchases. It says they compared my Atom values before and after to ensure everything was correct (so it didnt go from say 5500 to 5000 one purchase then 4000 to 3500 the next, which would show an obvious gap in Atoms.) It recognizes that what the customer saw may have indeed taken place and doesn't accuse them of lying, but assures them that their current Atom value is correct. Most of all, by listing their past few purchases it allows the person to see if they were charged for the WRONG bundle instead, which they can then respond to and remedy the issue. No matter what in the situation you treat the customer with respect. They're a customer who keeps your game going.
---
I ALWAYS go on the drums anyway. And not because im AFK. Just cus, i dunno, I figure its the most boring thing, so I better do it in case nobody else does. Im happy too. I enjoy watching the event as I bang the drums.
---
Is the guass rifle worth staying with and if so, what should I focus on?
---
This happened to me yesterday. Do not play around when the dailies reset. So disappointing.
---
Fuck me for trying to play the event the way it was intended?
---
It's ability to effortlessly land shots and still do more damage than precision weapons is insane. You could cut it's damage in half and it would still be overpowered. They should cut all explosive damage in half except frag mines.
---
Those mirelurk hatchlings when doing SBQ also suck equally as bad.   I can't see them unless I use VATS.
---
My first outfit with it was drifter rags and,  ushanka. Not a good replica of being a plague doctor but, I like the look. Recent put it with the fashionable raider outfit.
---
Oh cool
---
Playing on PC but thanks. Is it really just a matter of using VATS?
---
I had my stealth up so high that I could stand toe to toe with an enemy and duck and they would instantly lose sight of me and I'd go into caution. Even then I still couldn't lose a fucking molerat. Those things are relentless.
---
Happens with my .50 pretty frequently too
---
Yeah fuck those people for having fun doing something. They should do it your way or not all right?
---
I agree. Outside of Scorched Earth I think its the best event in the game.
---
It blows my mind why people wont turn up to it, yet they will go to uranium fever in there droves. 
---
You can almost guarantee at least 4 legendaries in the event, plus one of them is level 100, and tons more xp. And a more fun time no? I think it is anyway. I do it solo all the time.
---
Trick to use is after placing a foundation build a metal bar on the side and another on top (two high) then blueprint them - That way it will let you place them anywhere without them snapping
---
Double PSA, Chinese armor is a rad suit but better.
---
We were 1 piece of Ore away from level 4 today...
---
I'm one away from the end on main, then I'll do some catch on on my second just for fun.
---
You must have crap luck.
---
Haven't failed a single one.
---
Llamafromhell38 if you'd like to join.
---
Agree 100%!  But there's always that one time that you can't jump away easily, and i ask Bethesda "why can't I jump up into a tree with Marsupial?"  LOL
---
That worked for my alt. Thanks for linking it!
---
Did they say how much gold it would cost per item?
---
Thanks for this!  It worked for me!
---
um... you should tho. If you can't tank much damage you should do damage at least. Unarmed excels at that
---
99 Ore only got us 3/4.
---
Exactly. Can you imagine the uproar if someone who "has no life" was able to grind through the legendary run and get atoms and someone who "has a kid and a job and a life" couldn't?
---
It's like playing a sport but instead of going for the goal, you just sit on the field twiddling your thumbs. Might be having fun, but it's not the way the game is played.
---
[yet another one ](https://youtu.be/0OwKtOKRIeY)
---
For those wondering, season 1 began on June 30 and the 10th week would end on September 7th, so there’s little more than 2 weeks left.
---
Most likely season 2, Armor Ace, will begin around September 29th:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_Ace_%28season%29
---
Gunna end up fucking snapping . I get one shot and I don’t know why ?
---
Thats been happening to me for as long as I've been playing 76.  Found not long ago when reload initiates either quick swap or store the weapon.  Pull it backnout and fire the remaining rounds
---
They took all the complaints from this sub and put them in there
---
It's almost as if you don't read the posts about others failing due to... Oh I dunno... The creatures not spawning at all?
---
If 10 people are running around and expanding outwards looking for creatures that don't exist and the timer fails.
---
Sorry if whining about the game having bugs annoys you. LOL
---
 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
As much as I'd like to have more time to get some of the rewards, if they made it a monthly event people wouldn't run it much and the event would fail more.
---
I don't know for sure, but it sure seems my shotty does more damage in vats
---
My understanding is you will keep one of each
---
You should complete it tomorrow then.
---
Im grateful for the double score weekend, it shaved off a couple of days for me!
---
Says you. This isn't a sport. It's a video game. This isn't competitive. There is no wrong way to have fun. 
---
Technically killing shit is half the event. They are playing the half they want to. If you want to do the other part have at it. Just don't be upset if other people don't want to do that part of the event.
---
Oh yea I forgot that one!
---
thx for the reminder :)
---
Unlimited scrap box. Junk no longer takes up stash room. Private world= ammo workshop damn near unlimited ammo. Tent. Need someplace to fast travel to without costing 30 to 40 caps? Drop your tent there and you're set.
---
I've only seen the barrel on rank 4,if only rank 3 is needed rank 4 is still a better chance of it dropping!
---
Early on the hunting rifle is your best bet for damage.
---
i am literally a potion seller.
---
I make sure my vendor is always stocked with serums so people can jump around like kangaroos. 
---
maybe set a goal to collect every plan in the game. it'll take a lot of time and caps.
---
Rad rats suck ass
---
Also, Turtle says 3 drums is better than a combo of 3 drums or spits.
---
You just have to get all then server hop and it will be there again. Sorry I didn’t finish reading the last part
---
I didn't even know this was why. I keep FT'ng to them and end up with a bunch of high level players just camping out and not doing the drums in the beginning or contributing to kills. Annoying, stahb be lazy plz.
---
Edit: This is about primal cut events, it's been happening at those too
---
Why the fuck aren’t these MENTIONED IN THE TIMER INSTRUCTIONS?
---
you need to know the plan for them to drop. it does better base damage than a combt rifle and also improves sneaky sneaky
---
Like several people mentioned, I’m also there for the XP. I don’t care about the rewards, but the ore goal is still important because higher level enemies spawning = more XP. So I will grab some ore a couple of times to help reach that goal since 5 top level deathclaws spawning are good XP. 
---
It just depends though, if there’s only 2 or 3 of us in there it’s gonna be goul xp farming almost 100% of the time so I don’t bother with ore. If there’s a good amount of people it’s worth grabbing some ore to encourage others to also do at least 1 or 2 ore runs. If no one else grabs any after that it’s back to gouls.
---
Never feed in Ore until you've gathered from all 4 tunnels!
---
No snallygasters to worry about then.
---
I just use Primal Cuts for fast travel points.
---
Gear
---
2 perk coins per perk card
---
So a level 3 card is worth 6, a level 5 is worth 10, etc.
---
Left arm right arm left leg right leg and chest
---
shhhhhhhh, keep it secret, keep it safe ;)
---
Chinese stealth suit gives you more rad resistance! With that you might need 4 radaway if you're bloodied, but in power armor you will be chugging radaway whilst running the tunnels.
---
Thanks. I was afraid it would be just 2 perk coins no matter it's level.
---
Get a shishkebab, you can ensure that worker never dies unless you so first!
---
oh I know. forgot to mention that I crashed on both events like 30 times in the past 24 hours. I love the game and event but.... but..
---
Trying to perfect builds, finding hidden secrets among perks... Finish off sets of armor...
---
Locating rare apparel and/or plans, basically just little things to tick off.. While I await new content... 
---
Easter eggs of course... 
---
And levelling, for some reason I find levelling addictive. Plus I'm pushing hard to have as many perk points available for all 3 characters I have, for when the new update drops with legendary perks... 
---
That's about it, dailies, queen runs, the imposter..
---
Thats bs.
---
Trapped! https://i.imgur.com/Bfp73mK.png
---
Almost 5k is alot of score.they need to get a handle on this
---
It is, unless you use heavy guns/auto which overwhelm it.
---
I'll nope out for the cookout but not prime meat!
---
I should be done Tuesday I think! Can’t wait to be done.
---
was the hat a atom shop thing? i dont remember seeing it
---
Brand New game, and just getting out of the vault. You make your first camp. After completing an event you get a plan to make a basic bed. You lay down in the bed, and suddenly you are greeted with the lovers embrace perk. 
---
Todd Howard appears beside you at you home in real life. He wraps his arms around you and brings you in close.
---
He whispers in your ear...
---
*It just works*
---
Not very well hahaha
---
Ushanka hat is best hat.
---
Use a radiation suit or a Chinese stealth suit, if in power armor, even the rad resistance ones you will be chugging the radaway like a lush at a boozer!
---
Just how big is that salt shaker?

Free States scorchbeast hunter and Cranberry Bog tour guide.

Seems to be off-season for the guided tours, but the SB kills are racking up nicely.

between the time I launching a nuke and when wastelanders came out, I went back and completed questlines I hadn’t done up to that point.  Did events I hadn’t made it to - for the overencumbered, timing is another RNG roll unto itself :)

Finally got a good set of armor (for my play style) about the time I made L180.

A milk me emote ;-)
---
I would enjoy it if my game would stop freezing every time i try to load in the moonshiner shack couple minutes in advance next to the event, or directly to the event when it begins, both forcing me to close and restart the game. 
---
I missed it 5 times already because of it and its completed in less than 3 or 4mins before i get the game to finally let me reload or switch servers.
---
It was an issue with fasnacht too but at least the event itself was long enough that i could still get it reload and have the event not be completed yet. Here however if your game freeze its over for this hour. I want to add this was never a problem last year when the event was there for the first time around.
---
Recently I'd argue radscorpions. Meat week has shown me they are like mole rats but when you get 4+ prime ones attacking you at once they hit like a truck.
---
Is fixer a low level gun?thought it was 25.if it is hell I'll throw one to my level 15 alt
---
We should have an auto doc for the camp and charge 1 flux that corresponds to the mutation to remove it.
---
What
---
PLEASE
---
Great stuff, thanks
---
Bethesda is the absolute worst when it comes to in game explanations of anything. That is the main reason the Reddit sub is so popular imo!
---
Sounds like deaths were scripted (i.e. not preventable). Just like what's his faces death by decapitation in Skyrim.
---
I also have a Bloodied faster swing speed, +1 strength war drum lying around...
---
They can go for 5k its a collectors item and not soo many people have a tenderizer.
---
PSA: These posts are entirely pointless and fall on deaf ears. Your intended audience is casuals who are never going to come here and see this post. People who go through the effort of finding a place like this to talk about the game are aware of how to read
---
Seriously? I thought the hunting rifle used .308 rounds
---
I’ve had it where primal cuts is only filled with high levels who one shot all the enemies and legendaries then they go to the cookout and afk
---
Love it, I put my BOS standard behind a dumpster hopefully the message comes across
---
Cave crickets. They have a high damage output, are fast, and hard to hit
---
Have you seen the Brotherhood bunker we get in season 2? That's also right out of Fallout 2. I've wanted 76 to play with the setting it's in much more than it did at release so it's great to see Bethesda actually doing it. All I want next are talking Deathclaws and Nightkin.
---
VATS them.  If they don't say "diseased" kill them in VATS.  If no diseased ones spawn, move to a different nest (I think there are several now above and below the rafting place with Blackeye and company.)
---
And take off your armor so it's not getting damaged while you're getting nibbled.
---
Honestly I run like 30-35%, knuckles still hit for over 600. That's enough to 1 or 2 shot most things and if they hit you it knocks you to 15 and need rage procs.
---
What unique items can you earn?
---
Has anyone actually gotten that reward yet? I figured there is some way to keep track of it. I played a bunch, and just maybe break 400 hours if I play all of tonight and tomorrow night.
---
He’s a wordsmith
---
They were diseased I checked. At least 4 of them were.
---
A hunter is a hunter even in a dream
---
There is that, but I don’t have the right perk card :(
---
i've played with people using explosive GPs and they still absolutely shred everything, cheese lords are still fine :D
---
Double XP I was getting 11-12k per wave with boosted INT and food buffs
---
Happens to me during internet hiccups, the game can't verify you actually own it and kicks you out
---
Havent seen or done any of the quest yet, so probably a really dumb question, but is the inside of the mine nuked?  I.E. My full Unyeilding set is useless?
---
Charred Feral Ghouls....F*CK those A holes!!
---
Now those are the numbers I need!
---
In power armor? No you'd need to chug 40 radaway, in a radiation suit or Chinese stealth suit? Only 4 radaway is needed!
---
You can track it in the character tab of your challenges, I think the hours could have been played by now, but you'd have needed to have been playing nothing but 76 since launch.
---
It's terrible for anyone to afk during those. It just makes more enemies and makes it tougher over all. The people afk on the drums/spits contributes to the Grahm event greatly! I encourage more afkers on that one, the prime cuts ones no one should ever afk on that :(
---
Yup! I had this idea awhile back too. They should def add this. Probably a little tricky but it’d be awesome.
---
Depends on the playstyle. I have a few power armor, a lot of regular armor and 1 stealth suit. I like to have different toons for every occasion, so I have 10 of them. Lol
---
🌟🌟In a few weeks time The Brotherhood Of Steel shall have their foothold in Appalachia. In this time we shall purge this land of the Enclave and their supporters. We will get this land back up and running. we will “make Appalachia great again” We will not fail! FOR THE BROTHERHOOD!! 🌟🌟
---
Also if you're be AFK for the event, don't be a dipshit and please follow this guide. The only time I've been in something that failed we had a jackass standing dead in the middle, doing nothing while the few that had gathered just failed from being overwhelmed.
---
I'd like to fucking pass just to get the Rad Barrel plan! Somebody was generous to craft one for me but I'm always scared I'll accidentally scrap it someday...
---
3 level ups should net it for you.
---
That’s beneath us soldier!
---
Wait, I’m on PC. Would you be willing to help me with my camp and some events? I’m level 52, been running a stealth rifle build.
---
I can make you one if you want a lvl 20 is still better than a lvl 30 combat rifle so it'll last you until you find something better and it uses combat rifle mods so is easy to get them.
---
100% agree.
---
They should also do away with the Perk Coins garbage. We're getting Perk Loadouts at the end of the year, so why should we have to throw away all of our Perks when that's in the pipeline?
---
You should unlock a Legendary Perk every 50 Levels, and they shouldn't have Ranks; Legendary Perks should be a one-off bonus that doesn't need to be "upgraded."
---
Yeah, I am missing 3 fireflies killed to complete a challenge. I do the mothman event anytime I see it pop up.  And kill around 20 or so. Still my challenge is sitting at 0/3
---
I just had to google what this was, and the small frog that your rockin on the ground in that photo looks nothing like the god awful, SCP, Trevor Henderson looking creature I just layed my eyes upon on Fallouts Wiki.
---
I saw him with the neon lettering yesterday but I didn’t have any caps for it.  It was also at the ski resort vendor bot.  Well now I have caps for it and no vendor had it.  I hopped around all over the place
---
Basic, Shrouded Wood Armour all the way. Combined with a basic cultists dagger and an Instigating Deathclaw Gauntlet.
---
I live my digital life free of legendary and rare item desires, because even when not bloodied, melee is so OP.
---
And they can teleport to you instantly. Usually, whole you're reloading.
---
Interesting, so it seems to already be confirmed...?
---
Lead meaning it's super heavy.... Got it. I'm slow
---
They're annoying but I'll always say Assaultrons and their auto-kill laser are the absolute worst!
---
I’ve never had it fail and I’ve done it around 15 times already
---
Who not gonna eat the meat?
---
This is only for the once per hour Grahm Meat event not Prime Cuts, no one should ever afk on that one! That's horrible people are doing that. 
---
It'll fail way more often and then no one gets the prime meats.
---
I think you're forgetting the radrat. Somehow able to tank EXPLOSIVE rounds and THE STRAFE!!!
---
So wastelanders unfortunately reintroduced this, bulldozer features supposedly will be returned "soon" but no real specifics.
---
yao guai are definately fuckers, they hit hard and every hit is a stagger, im quite often caught in a stagger loop so they just kill me outright because i cant do anything after the first hit
---
Mirelurk Kings. Bullet spongy, low profile, and stagger you from a mile away.
---
No. NO! Fuck those! Fuck those goddamned things straight back to every single Hell. Fucking Cazadores!
---
How does this post have so few likes? You see ATX prefabs clustered together have hundreds of likes. This is an amazing camp build!
---
20, 30, 40 and 50
---
PS4 Thanks for the offer though
---
God I hope so. Haven't moved in months but I love my spot aside from the grass. Grrr
---
It should give you a little bundle of goodies you can plop down in your camp and wear, so passersby's can phone the local authorities and ask them to check in on your mental state.
---
I know you can track it individually, but like on a global scale across all players, if anyone else has ever achieved it.
---
I'm a big min/maxer and trying to perfect my builds and create other builds outside of your standard metas everyone runs. I have 10 toons currently, and I'm currently about to have them all finished... so I started another account and started designing my next build. Lol. Its an addiction, but character building in this game allows for a lot of diversity and endless content.
---
I still think worst is the scorchbeasts simply because even though they were patched ages ago, sometimes they still soaz out and spam the blinding deafening sonic attack, which altgough isnt really dangerous to me is just plain annoying when its a constant stream of bright blue slapping me in the eyes
---
From what I understand they will still be ok but you might as well use a regular handmade, lever rifle, ect or stop sneaking to get the full 2x damage
---
Oh yeah that would be neat
---
Ah it was part of that atom bundle thing awhile ago that gave you the minutemen general uniform and hat if you bought atoms. Fortunately though the pirate hat looks pretty similar and is still obtainable.
---
Yeah the grass thing has been a pet peeve of mine since 4 and I was very glad to see it finally resolved... Then it came back.
---
I carry Chinese Stealth Armor for blast zones and am working on my SS set for everyday life in the wasteland.
---
For me it's the fact that they are super loud and often often startle me out of nowhere. Their "dig" mechanic is really just teleporting, as they move impossible distances extremely fast. (locking onto them with VATS easily reveals how broken their "dig" ability is) sometimes their digging even shows them rocketing through their air like furry missiles and they seem to gain a strange damage resistance while in the animation.
---
Combine all this with their stupid aggression they are easily the biggest pest in the game.
---
They need to use their dig ability less often, with at least some kind of cool-down between uses, and when underground they need to move at a far more reasonable speed, preferably the same speed as they run or slightly slower. Then give them a max aggro range.
---
At least, that's my two cents.
---
I use my bloodied explosive gatling gun on with max grenadier on uranium fever. With that perk on it doubles the explosive radius and I just shoot at the ground. Works great.
---
It was supposed to be a survival game but the fan base wanted more casual game play. I miss survival mode I just with they didn't mark you on the map.
---
Relax, work on my camp, join every event i can to gain gold
---
After I dump my prime the spot is straight where I go
---
Great!  When I tried the first time, I didn't think to kill the ones that weren't diseased so I had to use more stimpaks or eat more food to keep my health up.  It wasn't until the second try (a scorchbeast flew overhead and one yell killed all the mirelurk spawn...RIP) that I realized that if I VATS-killed all the non-diseased ones that my life would be ever so much simpler.  :)
---
100%, this. I'm level 100, I have all the perks I want, I'm not interested in legendaries. If I see RP, Hunting or Exploring groups, I'll join to be in something other than Building, tbh.
---
Count yourself lucky! It's possibly more wide spread with XB1 with influx of GamePass people. No telling for sure but it is so infuriating and an hour wasted.
---
Ha ha ha my first thought before Plague Doctor was Bloodborne.
---
Mule build lol
---
The same size as the ones you can find in game as junk.
---
Yeeeaaa but it was a good way for me to get rid of unwanted stims to lol
---
Well, at first there wasn't enough salt... So I just adding more and more salt!
---
I went heavy weapons on my 2nd char so went for PA, not having to grind for a set of unyielding was so nice.
---
That read like yin yang, something bad but something good to balance it
---
Make brain fungus soup or cranberry cobblers.  Join a public building team.
---
The last I heard they are account-wide. All your characters will get them. That was from angry turtle maybe a couple weeks ago.
---
I mean, in fallout 2 the chosen one had a car... soo..... but the closest thing to vehicles in Bethesda's fallout was that one guy in fallout 4 who apparently mimicked the sounds of a motorcycle...
---
Sucks for my character who isn't a power armour build. I do try snipe them though at a range with my guass rifle
---
Depending on what you’re special is at, it can give you 15 INT. Full Unyielding Armor gives you 15 INT (Can be an additional +5 INT if your major perk is +1 INT). Building Team gives you 4 INT. Scorchbeast Brains gives you 7.5 INT. Tasty Squirrel Stew gives you 25% XP. Berry Mentats gives you 5 Intel. Egghead and Herd Mentality serums give you an additional 11 INT. Strange in Numbers give you a boost to your mutations. Need Class Freak LVL 3 to nerf your negative effects on mutations. 
---
I don’t personally use these added boosts. Inspirational can give you another 15%. Casual shielded linings can give you another 3 INT.
---
Or he's a scammer...
---
For the first time in ages, Line in the Sand happened normally for me today, and I enjoyed it far more than when it's bugged. I'll be so glad when they patch it.
---
Wouldn't happen. Unfortunately. Bethesda would not give you atoms to buy ranks the next season. They want you to buy them with dollars.
---
i don’t even play this pos game anymore and i’m getting tilted just reading this, so many stupid fucking design decisions. the absolute worst
---
Wolves and floaters also do that atleast to me
---
been getting respawn bugged on pc during this event too, add it too the list of frustrating things.
---
Long story short, intelligence increases the XP earned and Charisma increases the XP earned from event. Lone Vault Wanderer has a good video on how to earn XP. There are foods you can eat, chems you can take, and certain quests you can do to increase your XP. It's long and convoluted and I'm not sure what level you are or what you can do. Just off the top of my head feed the people gives you can beef stew that gives you extra XP.
---
You'd be able to grind them extremely fast leveling a low level character to scrap the cards, that's not the same as having a lvl 700+ character. They don't want people to have them maxed the first week.
---
He's just a duper, takes a while for him to find the next YouTube video exploit.
---
Can I upvote this more than once
---
How does it get bugged?
---
They also appear to be immune to micronukes, no it wasn't burrowing at the time!
---
That’s what I thought too. But I could be wrong. Was it that the cards are account wide, or the amount of slots?
---
Melee build.
---
  Shielded SS underarmor + 3x bolstering WR deep pocketed metal, 1x Unyielding WR deep pocketed  metal + 1 Chameleon WR deep pocketed raider - all pieces are 3\*. One piece adds poison resistant, others add points to various specials DR; At about 330, still squishier than I like, so (self induced weight issues put me in) Excavator in high level zones.
---
200% repair on everything, so no particular issues with durability/frequency of repair.
---
Grahm is the best NPC in the game bar none.
---
Shoot the legs off. They can't charge you then. Just do it from a range though with a silenced gun so they don't swarm you. Also stand on top of a building or car as well just a secondary to avoiding them.
---
CSA = Chinese Stealth Armor
---
It's something to do with a Fallout First player placing a tent near a spawn, I think.
---
You wouldn't be able to scrap any of the cards until level 50, which I presume is when the legendary perks are unlocked? Or am I wrong? Even so, I'm not saying perk coins should be account-wide, just the perks themselves.
---
They should rename Line in the sand to Scorch in a barrel
---
Yeah, am just saying get out of power armor, then put it back on for the fighting.
---
ALL HAIL THE REPUBLIC OF DAVE
---
Like, you literally only need to make sure one person is on drums, one on spit and one handling fires and it should be done within a minute.
---
But nooooooo, everyone is too busy trying to kill critters as if that will make a huge difference.
---
I think it depends on the playstyle of people, personally i use the solar armor with Vanguard and  full health, also a lot of perks to get more damage resistance while not in power armor so i can be healing tank to my friends.
---
Are you doing the tent trick too?
---
Low enough! Ty
---
Obviously?
---
Being a Speed Demon I find that Mole Rats are my worst enemies. Especially cause they give Parasites quite often and I rarely have a Disease Cure or Antibiotics
---
I’ve gotten the event to the final bar if 6 people are on drums and spits the whole countdown, it’s awesome
---
soon
---
The rights to say "y so salty?" When you beat them in pvp with it
---
I know! I’ve seen a lot of high level player just standing where they spawn not contributing anything ¡GO TO THE DRUMS OR SPIN THE MEAT! It’s so annoying watching them get their rewards and doing nothing and then they get mad because the event failed
---
Mole Rats piss me off more than any enemy in the game. They’re just annoying
---
Yeah. I've never seen anybody sit out for Prime Cuts. The only time it fails is when there's only two dudes there and my slow butt is one of them. 😰
---
Also it's eerily quiet in the Wayward... Dead silent, everybody just just sitting around with blank expressions. Bethesda really needs to add some ambient noise in there.
---
Honest question, why not?
---
Badges - possum and tadpole
---
So thats a nice way of saying we don't have a date huh -.-?
---
Of course you get spoiled with that trick it’s awesome.
---
I’m not going to lie this is the only event when I don’t feel some sort of remorse when I solo kill a legendary.  It’s not like anyone ever calls me over to get a shot in on one when I’m collecting ore, so why not?
---
I've never noticed that until right this second
---
Just wait for Bethesda to retcon Cazadors into Appalachia in a future update.
---
Does anyone know if there is a fix for the future tech camp skin? Mine is still not showing up on the map and I really don't want to have to move it and rebuild everything - my camp is built into a rock cliff. Uhh!
---
Slots are account wide, individual cards are unlocked - at current. It could change but very unlikely. 
---
At least they heavily reduced how long it will take to max them.
---
Da, hammer is best with sickle
---
Yes please.
---
Cave cricket piercers
---
It's almost as if...
---
Being inconsiderate and only caring about xp from killing ghouls instead of helping complete event
---
All the perk slots unlock for all characters at level 300, you can scrap cards at any level also. They'd have to do a massive rework of the system to do anything different, the current system is likely what they'll go with but tweaked along the way as it's due in just over a month.
---
The true mystery of the Wendigo is why it crashes servers so much.
---
How often does this cookout spawn? I've done numerous prime events and only saw two cookout events..also because I'm curious. How much scrip is each meat worth?
---
Loading times are more likely to be effected by hard drive than your isp.
---
It just auto-fails when you join.
---
Lol glad that reference wasn’t lost
---
It really needs to be disabled for nw until they fix it. Everytime someone shoots at me with the gauss shitgun in nw, it causes my game to suffer from severe frame drops. I'll freeze in place one sec then dead the next due to them spamming the trigger
---
I’m already at 100 on the leg run so I use event right now for meat week and prime cuts. But sometimes I use exploring for the extra endurance for my bloodied character.
---
How is that not helping. Imagine if no one killed the ghouls
---
And when they do hit you its usually when your up in the air and they've somehow made contact.
---
Are you playing over wifi, by any chance?
---
Nice way of saying you've missed a lot of posts about it already
---
Ever since the last update im constantly crashing too.
---
2 per point on the card, 3 point cards give 6 coins
---
Because its not real! You've taken too many mutation serums and have started hallucinating. It's all in your head poor traveler of the wastelands.
---
The Savage Divide version seems to bug out 70% of the time for me. Toxic Valley seems to be the most consistently successful, I can easily solo that one as there isn't even a boss.
---
I sell toxic goo cheap just for customers who need the rads.
---
I came back for the Wastelanders release and still haven't finished it. I told myself I'd finally find Ra-Ra last night. She's still in those vents. 
---
I also still need to finish the main quest. 
---
I bought this game on launch too. 
---
What do I do? I adventure, scavenge, and build. Build. Build.
---
I literally scrolled for about 20 mins , before asking the question. Your snarky remark was unwarranted
---
Thats a very nice build man! Great job :D
---
Allot of the time people wait for the big monster at the end, only to find it isn’t that big not that worthy. Keep banging the drums and spinning those wheels, as they do more faster. 😉👍🏼
---
Fantastic, thank you, now I can really figure out how absolutely far away I am to getting the legendary perks I want!
---
are you running gunsmith for the weapon durability buff? do you find that your items break often enough that you need to assign 1-5 special points towards it?
---
I’ll trade you one I have two extra if you got a tenderizer plan
---
The blue x01 power armor nuca Cola paint
---
If we do get more missions with Rose, I hope it’s one where we can destroy her and shut her up for good.
---
Once per hour on the hour. Near 76
---
Yea do it while u can. Beth prob on to us at this point lol
---
Or run over from the Moonshiner's Shack.  lol
---
&gt;They'd have to do a massive rework of the system to do anything different, the current system is likely what they'll go with but tweaked along the way as it's due in just over a month.
---
They'd have to do a rework for sure. To say how massive of a rework it would be, is a little bit beyond you and I, as we have no idea what the inner-guts of the code look like and how they store all that information. Regardless, this is something that I believe Bethesda should take a look at, as it adds a "legacy" system to a game where players can benefit by having more than one character. Having the level-up progress of a Legendary Perk Card carry from one character to the next would be that benefit. Otherwise, players can *and will* be disincentivized to start new characters, which in the long-term of this game, is a very bad thing, I'm sure you would agree.
---
Relaxing while working on/just chilling in your camp is so underrated. I spend about 50% of my time at my camp just rearranging furniture.
---
This little fight will be the least of both of your worries once the brotherhood gets a foothold
---
That's what I was trying to say. They're down voting because they assume they know how it works by assumption versus someone who has actually had to deal with it.
---
I certainly didn't know until you pointed it out.
---
Well, best not think about it now. Wait until its released and you are ready.
---
The ice ones are so immersive that the whole game freezes right along with your character, I haven’t had a single encounter with them where my game didn’t freeze as I was being gang raped by a horde of colorful testicles.
---
Customer support doesn't care and won't do anything but lock your request for help, but keep trying we need to drown them in our complaints!
---
 All I need is the damn mods and I'm set. 
---
I'll probably get them in trades a hell of a lot sooner than from the event.
---
Yea you gotta put the tent on the street where they spawn. Idk if u need two or just one will do it. Idc either way. Best regular public event imo.
---
We do not fear you in the slightest
---
There's a trunk? T.T
---
Sorry, just hard to understand how people haven't heard yet
---
I look forward to a worthy opponent
---
Seems to be the common feeling, relief.
---
You will in time
---
Assaultrons suck though. By far the enemy I hate the most. I have a post about them
---
I was told it takes about bout a month once you reach the last level.
---
Care to explain the tent trick?
---
I feel for you my friend... revenge must be taken. I searched a week for my beautiful Brahmin lass, Guendalen. She died 3 minutes after making it to my camp. :'(
---
Cave crickets and rad roaches during the SBQ get me more times than the larger enemies
---
Is there a way to reskin without moving? I didn't see any obvious one so I just assumed if have to wait til I move.
---
2 coins per star on the card. some perks like Professional drinker while taking 3 points to use, only have 1 star and only give 2 coins
---
Ethernet
---
Just don't do the Prime Cut event at the top of the hour.  Easy peasy.
---
You can't drop more than 15 prime meat at a time anyway so there's no need to try to do all 4 Prime Cut events just to get more prime meat that will eventually spoil.  The main event can be finished in less than two minutes anyway (especially if 6 people fill the drums/spits while waiting for the timer to finish counting down) and then you can fast travel to one of the Prime Cut events right after.
---
Oh cut the bullshit.  People complaining that it's too easy to finish a season with weeks to spare don't need to buy fucking ranks in the first place.
---
Yeah but they all are doing bloody builds and would hate to lose an once of their min max damage so they'll just let the few full health power armor builds like me go to all 4 sections then complain when I don't get enough by myself to get the full reward or if I finish the event too quick
---
As do I.
---
Really? I see them in vendors for cheap all the time even before the return of meat week, I figured they were fairly common with the event being back. I already have 5 lol
---
I was trying to build for heavy auto weapons but now I might not... It’s too bad explosives are both heavy and terrible damage wise
---
Thank you! Since when did these fuckers get Death Star laser attached to their heads!
---
Bonus fact
---
If you go to that house and loot all the text books, even if you then shit them out on the floor, you've just reset your "loot counter" so you can get good loot in other places.
---
We shall see.
---
I learned very quickly to give up my hording habits that I developed in previous games.
---

---
I am guilty of this... Gotta get me that meat! Apologies to all I've left in the middle of events!
---
Yes. It’s all controlled via their Social club.
---
C H A L L Y
---
Especially on power armor or bloodied builds, power armor just gives you no resistance to poison damage, and with bloodied if you dont instantly pop a stim you're dead
---
Y'all get mad at everything
---
If I didnt like the game I wouldnt be here. Hence my suggestion.
---
Those are the worst. Nothing better then lighting the sbq to dying from a hatching.
---
That's the main reason i quit. Choosing between semi reasonable carry weight or doing slightly more than tickle damage is not fun
---
The Treeminders from Fallout 3? Lol 
---
Harold: please kill me 
---
Treeminders: his pleas for death are a test of my will and strength to resist temptations
---
Thank you! So how would I go about adding them as a friend of something like that, if you  don't mind answering?
---
Death Star lasers haha! Pretty accurate way to describe them, good one!
---
As a Commie I fully support the enclave! There managing to destroy America faster then we did, and we dropped SO many nukes!
---
Sure, you just add their name to the friends list and voila.
---
You finished early.  it's not that you're not  getting shit for the following weeks, it's that you've already  gotten everything you should have but did so sooner than expected.
---
A major reason they switched to this model is because they were handing out too many free atoms in the first place, that's why they switched to giving away fewer atoms and making up the difference with "free" ATX items.  I know I can't speak for everyone but I'm currently sitting on over 29000 atoms and I didn't even care about the old atom challenges for almost a half a year after the game started.
---
Bethesda needs to make money off of this game and atom sales were supposed to be driving force behind that, if they keep giving people free atoms there's no incentive for people to buy any.
---
Thank you so much!
---
The challenge lasts for 100 days doesn't it? And started at 30th June? So that means it finishes 5th October? The table finishes at day 70. So it is missing 30 days? I think I am missing something. My logic says take what today is out of the 100, (so 55 today,) use that as a percentage, (55%) then compare to your run level on the first 4 columns. So as 55% is done, if you are level 68 or more you are ahead. Is that logic correct please?
---
In the game there's a social tab with the option to add a friend. 
---
Your name is at the top. Adding friends is kinda wonky though so it might take a bit of time.
---
I feel like what I see most is a stratification by level chunks. 
---
* Really low levels: no PA
---
* As soon as qualify for PA - until you're ~ 200: PA
---
* ~200-~350: 3* (no PA)
---
* 350+  50/50
---
I have a better runner-up: floaters. Enough said.
---
You’re welcome, happy hunting fellow vault dweller.
---
Primal Cuts fails 50% of the time for me. We kill everything, including the prime beast that should complete the event, but the timer keeps going and we fail. The meat cook however...lucky if it lasts a minute 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Simple fix, build underground. No trees or grass in my house. And surprisingly, very little dirt.
---
I was with you for one today and yes you can. Thanks again for your help.
---
To my knowledge that one just happens randomly while playing nuclear winter! And that persists until I shut down the game!
---
Mole rats at a workshop defend event are beyond annoying. Searching for them, getting stuck in the dig loop. Only to have to fight 3 more waves
---
Sounds about right to me.
---
I sure hope so, because the current implementation on the PTS leaves a lot to be desired.
---
Must have misread something. Thought you wrote something about the game being empty now. Weird
---
Pretty sure you need the Lying Lowe quest completed first before it will drop as a reward. Step 1: quest. Step 2: Fixer plan. Step 3: legendary Fixers can now drop as reward.
---
Yesterday I had 3 afkers on the drums in my server for about 10 hours, and everyone gave them offerings of beer and rotten meat.
---
Run the main quests, sleep for extra XP every hour, make cobbler, easy and should be easy to find the recipe. Keep eat/making/join a events team. Do meat week every hour.
---
There is no real fix to the rubber banding because its an issue with the game everyone has experienced for a while and Bethesda has not patched. 
---
Vats does help but you will still get the same issue.
---
The fact that they can nibble on my ankles through power armor capable of preventing radiation getting to my body makes me hate them more
---
Yeah, can be pretty toxic. Praise the full health builds who can tank all 3 pylons.
---
I understood them to being account wide also
---
For real though, I'll move things around just to put it back haha
---
I can never pull myself to constantly move my camp but i love to work on it
---
The drawbridge for a lake is one idea. You could have a multi floor structure that connects to another structure from accessing a drawbridge.Is it a waste of time? You can make that argument about a lot of things in the atom shop. Depends what   Your willing to apply it to.
---
They could use the exact same track from Biv’s bar even and it would feel lively
---
First time it’s happened to me. My bug was weird in it just carried over my daily from yesterday and let me finish the ones I didn’t complete.
---
That still doesnt explain how they're 5 of them, you can only place one collection per camp
---
Ok that's enough internet for me today :-|
---
End of season closeout?
---
My 15 extra INT does not hurt you in any way.
---
Around 10k total for me I had to pay to catch up.
---
I'll deal with the rats, assaultrons are the worst
---
Radscorpions = Spicy Mole Rats
---
If they do I would hope more effort would go into their design... unless it's a placeholder that plushie is essentially a frog with a mohawk so that's not exactly promising if it's representative of how the actual enemy would look, especially considering that the original was more of a crossbreed between a langolier a velociraptor and tentacle hentai.
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Pneumatic](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Pneumatic)
---
Mole rats, radscorps, and ghouls are the reason my wife cant play fallout. She's easily frightened and has a bug/insect phobia. The ghouls leaping at her and insects busting out of the ground damn near give her a heart attack. I had to mod out the spiders for her so she could play Skyrim.
---
Yes!!! This really works!! Tell everyone, it makes a big difference and can make finishing this event easy!
---
There are some really fun inventory bugs going on right now
---
If you look into bloodied heavy weapons, with the right set up in power armor you can be at 20% health, deal big damage and tank everything.
---
Especially when you jump away and clearly are out out range and then the stun happens
---
You can rename items, so everything for text chat is in the game...
---
everyone with underground bases should have molerat player icons
---
