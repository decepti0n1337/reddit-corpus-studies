I agree with more atoms, but I feel like an additional reward would be beneficial to incentivize. Maybe a random ‚Äúgoodie bag‚Äù of things like chems or food. Like a workshop event reward.

I think we are going to be fighting the Interloper in the upcoming content. While we don't get a very good look at  the new monster (the one at the very end of the Wild Appalachia trailer), it looks *a lot* like the effigies to me.
---
There might be some visual bugs going on too with that as I freaked out as all my fermented stuff from yesterday was showing my camp box at 50% decay, but when I pulled them out, they were all at 80% 
---
And a nod to Revenge of the Nerds by naming the main nerd Lewis. 
---
Try sliding one of the small signs next to and slightly under the section that sticks out then do the long press selection.
---

---
With a bit of luck it might group the objects and allow you to move them.
---
A few examples of the weapons:
---
Anti-Armor: .50 Cal, Double Barrel Shotgun, Fatman, Gatling Laser, Power Fist, Dragon, Ultracite Laser Pistol, Western Revolver
---
Bloodied: BP Rifle, Combat Shotgun, DCG, Lever Action, Meat Hook, Mr Handy Buzz Blade, Shishkebab, Sledgehammer
---
Furious: 10mm Submachine Gun, Automatic Combat Rifle, Deathclaw Gauntlet, Gatling Gun, Guass Rifle, Radium Rifle
---
Instigating: BP Pistol, BP Rifle, Gamma Gun, Guass Rifle, Super Sledge, Tesla Rifle
---
Medics: Flamer FFR, LMG FFR
---
Quad: Harpoon Gun, Hunting Rifle, Tesla Rifle
---
Two-Shot: Gatling Laser, Guass, Lever Action
---
Vampires: Handmade, Minigun

It turns out their fix was just erasing the fact that I knew the plan. I've been building up a second set of known civil war plans to try and sell as a set and I noticed the the confederate hat wasn't in my stash but it turns out it was, with the plans I hadn't learned yet.  I learned the plan (for the second time) and it is now craftable.  kind of crummy way to fix it, but it works now.
---
I don't mind the SBs so much, but this is a very long quest and resetting the whole thing if you quit is bullshit. I got a family, sometimes I have to stop playing.
---
Anyone notice that while the power connectors are no longer sparking, its harder to connect them?  Instead, I wind up jumping around like an idiot for a good couple of seconds, if I drop the connector and try to attach from the other item, it seems to work find the 2nd time
---
The guy has the wet suit and arms plans I'd get the enclave armor plans if you have them 
---
yep its know about, seems like someone forgot to finish/remove it before the update
---
Agreed.  I engaged him and he then started following my bf so he killed the bot.
---
if you havent already done it, go to the building across the bridge to the west of Flatwoods. you'll find a holotape inside from the Overseer. this will start a quest that brings you all over the western areas of Appalachia, but you don't have to fight anything difficult. good quest to get familiar with the low-level areas, and you may come across some event quests you can do, too.
---
Good point!
---
I built my camp right next to that barn, on the oil well there, and haven't had a chance to log in yet since the patch. I wonder if I'll need to move my CAMP.
---
I have a locked room, but not turret guarding it. One could pick lock, activate beacon and fast travel away. I think it would be better and safer to just store the beacon.
---
If you don‚Äôt mind me asking what do you think of the nuka shine damage potential ‚Äúpossibly‚Äù being over powered straight out the gate?
---
Non game performance atom shop paid content would be fine and it would help Bethesda have an ongoing income for this game.  Plus if people got in the habit of buying stuff from the atom shop, they might buy more.
---
Basically, as compared to already in-game content:  if it doesn't significantly affect your damage output, help you gain caps, doesn't affect your damage protection, or any other viable "active playtime stat" then it is fair game for caps.   Giving someone a larger camp for pay as long as the base camp is way more than enough to get all the benefits of the items we can create, go for it.   Giving someone a way to put stuff indoors that would normally be outdoors, sure that's fine.  I'd pay atoms for that.    There is a line that shouldn't be crossed, but it is not where you think it is.  By moving the line a bit closer to Bethesda for their benefit means that we all benefit in the way of long term game development and free content that is paid for by the cosmetic and non-performance related enhancements.
---
Or a legendary item roll?! That would be sweet. 
---
your camp must be moved because it's in a place where future content will be placed. if you're on pc, the falling is because of an issue with mods.
---
Remove any custom ini changes if you are on PC.
---
Dude seriously these posts are ridiculous now.
---
Logic says you have two choices: fight at your risk,or leave the server.
---
You chose to fight and fought till you had no caps. What in the f were you thinking?i bet you also reported them.
---
Thanks üòÑ but yea it is a bit crazy. Worse on the Bethesda.net forums though
---
Yes, it has been very hard to craft! I do habe speed demon with level 2 class freak. 
---
I have an idea, just give us all the items from Fallout 4. They literally stripped everything from the item shop, just to resell it to us. Go figures. 
---
The words spoken by the Liberators are Chinese mandarin short exclamations, but are difficult to understand due to the high amount of audio distortion. Many of them are motivational, like "We must not stop", "Revolution is a must". [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Liberator\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Liberator_(Fallout_76))
---
I agree completely, and think it's kind of silly that I'm flagged for PVP for a whole group because of one person. You can't defend yourself when that happens, no matter how good your build.
---
At level 230 you‚Äôd think caps wouldn‚Äôt be a problem
---
I'm having the same problem on PC.  All required materials in my inventory.
---
Did you make sure to get your toothbrush and 4 caps from the body?
---
Seriously, the Flatwoods Monster is 100% not worth *any* effort to take out.
---
Ok dude. I added you.
---
Pretty sure it is still really rare unless someone can confirm otherwise and seen it going for $25K

Yes please!!! This absolutely needs to be a thing!
---
What are all the vendors I can hit in one run?
---
Did they at least fix those V Fast Melee Weapons yet or do you still need to repair them past 100%?
---
Not having what other mmo's have is what makes me love fallout 76 so much. Don't go that route, compete to get your camp in an opportune spot and be the first to log onto the server with a well placed camp and get the sales... This is the wasteland, and you need to plan accordingly... Not having MMO mechanics keeps this feeling like that great singleplayer journey we all love and admire;
---
I'm not even sure how to do the new vending system. I'm a noob lol 
---
Bad game mechanics. Changes to the original game mechanics have made it unappealing to those playing solo, of low level, and uninterested in pvp. In fact, the changes give huge advantages to the challenger. The fact that someone can put their big toe in the area of the workshop and take it over before they are even in range of any defenses is a real problem. This renders locks, turrets, traps, and workbench protection useless and in fact immediately turns them against the owner, making it a liability to ever build up a workshop.
---
With the right perk, you can tame one. It's to ne one spawned by an event.
---
Responders, Raiders, Free States, White Springs, Enclave Bunker, Watoga Train Station (includes traveling vendors caps stash with this one) and BOS Vendor.
---
I  take a power plant about once a week and i leave the fusion core generator open for everyone.  I have only twice been hit.  I dont care that much and it is usally my sign to leave the game for a while.  I had the second guy get upset i left and could hear it as i was logging off.  
---
It‚Äôs extreme, but the crafting costs make it necessarily rare (it requires nuke quantum to craft). I do agree that it is overpowered if there isn‚Äôt a similar damage boosting alcohol for other types of attacks though- ranged and melee.
---
There definitely needs to be an option to walk away.
---
This one went for $16K it looks like.
---
On another post i had a few people offer it to me for around 2k. Didn‚Äôt have the caps then but yeah anyone paying 25k caps for it is retarded 
---
No, Grahm also shares his cap pool with Watoga
---
That‚Äôd be awesome! They could make it so you can transfer items between characters boxes on the same account from within the app too!
---
I love the mod that made their heads actually bobble
---
"someone is attacking your workshop!"
---
-Defend
---
-&gt;Fuck it, let them have it
---
True. That i could see happening. 
---
I've heard it supposed to be a 1% chance of proc (so on average, it'll trigger once per one hundred projectiles, which is why it seems to be really effective for shotguns and full automatics) and 25%/50%/75% per level. 
---
I will say that since respeccing my build to have less luck 9--&gt;6, it seems to proc less often. So maybe total luck figures in as well?
---
I occasionally have this same issue when I have a poor internet connection, might that have anything to do with it?
---
I've had people attack my workshops just to pick a fight, then leave when I didn't fight.
---
Try this one [https://youtu.be/MFM98KfKWcM](https://youtu.be/MFM98KfKWcM)
---
The update kicked me from my beautiful spot next door to the Moonshiners Shack.  Rebuilt across the bridge from Overseers camp and got kicked this morning.  Frig.  
---
I can understand. Wish I can help more. ATM I don't have access to a PC or the game. I hope you get it fixed
---
add all up
---
Nice point! I dont want to spoil other 2 keys but you get cool stuff. that means it's up to 3 key now ?
---
And while you are at it, why don‚Äôt you tell them to reply to my support ticket.. its been weeks with nothing!  I can‚Äôt even play.  I‚Äôm missing out on all this new content, not to mention the deals in the atomic shop I actually might have bought.
---
It's all good. I'll update you when I get a chance to check.
---
It doesn't go bad on the vine, at least I don't think so.   Just leave it there until you're ready.
---
Someone attempted this. Did not work out well.
---
Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôve opened the other two, but yeah it now requires tnt some 7 and I couldn‚Äôt find anything about it online
---
A) They were destroying stuff and we were repairing it for about 30 minutes, though by how "experienced" they were at the game I woudnt have been suprised if it took them to the minutes.
---
B) Yes you can bub, clearly you arent aware of this exploit as it hasnt happened to you and you cant counter it they were trash players who cant even aim they were literally exploiting some system in the game that lets them deal max damage to someone without us actually attacking thrm or taking revenge.
---
C) We owned workshops so we do have something to lose they ended up taking said workshops after they were done harassing us for about an hour.
---
D) Back in day one shit like this didnt happen since nobody had perfect rolled gear and "crying bout it" will make the devs aware of problems in the game "mechanics" which I somehow doubt being able to one shot someone who isnt engaging in pvp is part of what they had planned and mentioned in their interviews. Hell even in the beta this didnt happen.
---
Animations on rocketed melee weapons (such as bats) seem to be broken or otherwise stuck on one frame for both the player and anyone who sees their character
---
from what I here they are working on this but I have not heard of a release date
---
\&gt; logs in
---
\&gt; can't aim gun
---
\&gt; moves 10 feet forward, falls through the world
---
And things were going so well.
---
Except I didn't fight. 
---
u can make a scorchbeast stew ..which i think provides the highest HP benefit..but the fact that you need every piece of a scorchbeast..i wouldnt even try
---
Well I've still got another week of this conference to attend. Then I'll be able to log in and take ya on a tour
---
I'm having a ton of trouble moving since the update. My camp has 2x1 foot print but i have yet to successfully move post update without having to store blueprint and completely rebuild every time. I made my camp small and mobile specifically for ease of moving to trade move costs for fast travel costs.  But i don't want to pay to move and spend half an hour rebuilding all the time so instead of that ill play a different character until they get their shit together and fix the things they broke with their update.
---
People know, they just don't like it. They just want the plans or the workshop defense events. We have more than one type of player trying to coexist in this game, and on workshops they definitely don't see eye to eye.
---
Not alone, got a mad photo of my brother behind the driver wheel of a truck with me standing on the bonnet aiming a gun. Truck was just not appearing on his screen he just clipped right through
---
I left in December and did everything. Made a goal to hit 100 and I did. This update is good but the small drops in content are not enough to keep me.
---
I hope you made him a cup of tea. 
---
The lighted pillars are awesome, once I get the light box decor I'll be doing that up. :-D
---
Console?
---
Im almost sure ive seen a level 60 something wendigo
---
Census Violence is more broken than ever, I have chased it down for nothing, 6 times in a row, to find nothing in the area and a quest that will not trigger.
---
I feel like if Bethesda did this and made sure there was no bugs or glitches and thoroughly tested it and released it then it would be good
---
PC
---
Tons of camp issues all around. Public test server anyone? 
---
Sometimes when one this gets fixed, another inadvertently gets broken. I don't think some of these new bugs were intentional. I haven't even gotten a chance to play the game post patch but I've seen quite a few claims at bugs already. 
---
Food decaying faster, also food heals less.
---
Speed demon is apparently now broken.
---
A lot of vault dwellers are having difficulty with camp location upon login. 
---
The ridiculously long timer for nukes.
---
I'm not complaining at all, I'm just listing the bugs that I've read about thus far. 
---
Why walk when you can ride Outlander!? http://dulfy.net/2018/12/02/fallout-76-treasure-maps-guide/
---
I was a bit disappointed because there wasn't a few quests trying some other drinks and drugs waking up in strange places. I would like it to be like Far Cry 4.
---
+karma Thanks dude I forgot what dealing with a reasonable person was like .lmao!!! I posted the 300% damage rant and it was attack central ,it seriously gets old.

The video source in my opinion was reputable and his claims valid . it  had me thinking , great another potential damage exploit .

Thankfully I stick to a diet of cram, blamco mac and cheese, and fancy lads snack cakes.
---
Same happens with power cores
---
I guess I‚Äôm just lucky for playing at a slower pace. I was level 67, but recently made a new character. Bug even my original character had about 30% of the map still to see. I would have burnt myself out of the game too if I played that much. 
---
Yeah those pillars while simple to do bring it all together. 
---
Would hold on to them- I just crashed out of the game and lost a full set of T60 and Ultracite power armor; not dropped, just gone after restarting the game. Can't even access Bethesda "support" (though I expect the usual "start a new character" response). 
---
I've heard of that but that's the updated string that works for some mods, but not all, but many are still working I thought?
---
Also, the bag glow never worked, even before this patch.
---
If you also have Rad Worms you have a party. 
---
They are not in yet. the update is coming out in waves check out the road map it has the dates each part is being released. 
---
that's still not structurally sound...  the single foundation camp is a workaround not a solution
---
I can see you‚Äôre a glass half full kind of person. 
---
I used to be a glass half full kind of guy too. 
---
Until I realized the glass was half full of vomit. 
---
There seems to be some kind of exploit in the game where they can deal full damage to someone even if they dont engage in pvp. It may have something to do with being wanted or attacking camp stuff because some of them were wanted or attacking stuff and were able to do full damage. And we owned workshops so we would be losing on ammo and resources since we hadnt looked at them in a while because we did a SQB.
---

"His arms wide" not sure the general age group in this subreddit or how many will catch the reference.
---
I had no idea it was random where you woke up from your blackout.  I woke up in a giant unmarked tree house!
---
I laughed so hard when I woke up at the had/boardgames table in the forest. Blackouts? What are they gonna do, make my screen go black for a few seconds? That would suck. Ooooooh. That's definitely a blackout lol.
---
Still there?
---
Yup
---
Too bad, I one shotted him. Next time I‚Äôll try to power attack with my gun or something to get an insult
---
I dropped em pray for me 
---
are you talking about the latest patch? i reapplied it after the previous patch..still wouldnt work while i had strange in numbers on
---
I played at a slow pace. Levelling was so easy so that made things to easy and took challenging things away.  
---
  
---
The hardest issue I came across was the BoS quest heading into the glass cavern.  
---
Heck I even have the Marine wetsuit, all in game suits of PA including nuka cola and one of the harder masks to find.
---
Yep - I won't be claiming any workshops in the near future.
---
I‚Äôd love to see primes allow the use of standard rounds and the ultracite rounds. Minus the scorch damage on standard rounds in prime receiver. 
---
Maybe slow the durability per round fired. 
---
Even changing the ammo of said gun. Like the combat rifle from .45 to 5.56x45
---
I‚Äôm using one of the gts from down below. Hopefully they‚Äôre in the same server. 
---
Send me a message on Xbox and I‚Äôll invite you
---
That‚Äôs true, exp was dished out crazy when the game was first out. I‚Äôm kinda glad I didn‚Äôt play a lot then. Well I hope you find some gaming joy again soon man. But I think it will until late April or May before there is any real substantial content for you.
---
Ah bummer, I just assumed everything they showed in the trailer would be out at the same time. I knew they had to push something back but I thought it was only another day
---
Can you send an invite to joeysalamander 
---
Hey yall this is some of the most cryptic shit have a nice day
---
Ok
---
Ive gotten a recipe and a drink, didnt get any frat letter plans
---
It wouldn't be so bad if they actually gave us a craftable fridge or freezer we've been asking for to store food.  Instead they gave us faster spoiling food ugh!
---
Logic says you have 2 options: fight and die or dont fight and die. We tried to fight them and stopped as we were losing too much caps so we stopped then they were somehow able to kill us after even if we didnt seek revenge. And what else can we do, seems like they are exploiting some kind of bug.
---
Spaghett!!!
---
Definitely had it proc for stable flux in the past, regularly.
---
Yeah, first time i though i needed addictol, but it healed it self after some time.
---
?
---
I'd be okay with that if then the player was constantly on wanted state, cause you know, you're a ghoul :)
---
Obviously would be on Adventure server only.
---
Yes cause u are actually putting it in your stash at the same time 
---
I had to make a new character for the full release because when it came out i was already level 25. I didn‚Äôt even have the achievement for leaving the vault until i did it with a new character.
---
I‚Äôm asking for balance. This game is not hard, hence the folks, critics, and former players asking for more end game content. Right now, the weapons have a huge variance in their max DPS; balance them, perhaps by accounting for RoF in the crit frequency mechanics, then tweak the damage per shot up or down to calibrate for what difficulty the developers want to offer. Make sense?
---
It‚Äôs just to make combat less biased for a few niche weapons, so anyone can compete with the right perks. The proposed crit system, if you check, has an exponentiated ratio in its calculation, so high RoF weapons are not actually penalized that much, just 20%. The moderate rate of fire weapons‚Äô DPS is unchanged.
---
Do you think it‚Äôs fair that a 50 cal can currently out DPS a semi auto handmade by around 11k DPS, or a full auto handmade by 7k? This is just one step towards balancing weapon types, and it seemed clever when I stumbled upon it.
---
Awesome. I have 3 pieces of Unyielding Sentinel, one piece bolstering Sentinel, and a nocturnal AP refresh Sentinel. The ultimate goal being a complete Uny/sent set. I just wanted to make sure I was getting the most out of Sentinel‚Äîas a rifleman build, have to stay disciplined and hold ground to get effect once you lose the element or surprise. Thank you. 
---
sorry responded to the wrong thing that is an interesting idea 
---
Thanks
---
What ‚Äúdlcs‚Äù? They‚Äôve not announced ANY dlc for Fallout 76 so how would anyone know if there are or aren‚Äôt trophies for dlc that does not exist yet?
---
Tbh ive been debating the unyielding sentinel, only because I dont want to invest too much in intelligence to have both demolition and nerd rage, as a rifleman build how much damage do you do with unyielding if you dont mind me asking?
---
Eso has two tiers of expansions. Giant world size ones every 3 years and zone size ones every 6 months. The former sell for almost full game price, the latter free. There is so much content that its an incredibly rare achievment that can take years to finish all the quests.
---
So far what content has 76 had? Its coming up to 6 months now.
---
Haven‚Äôt played in a while, must have missed the patch notes. Darn. Thanks for letting me know, though!
---
Yeah, Bethesda should have put the dates in the trailer. But the roadmap that they released before that contains all the dates for the releases.
---
I also use it, I wish it was more effective. It‚Äôs not a huge deal but that card is just another in a long list of convenience cards of which we have to go into our perk section constantly to equip/unequip. Maybe if the UI/pipboy was snappier, faster, it wouldnt be so annoying constantly having to rotate perks in and out. 
---
Same here. Through random encounters with strangers and this forum, I have made more friends than I ever had on my ps4 before 76. Most people are friendly.
---
Agreed. I play 90% solo and I‚Äôd love to have a companion to talk to. Real people rip me out of the gaming fantasy world faster than anything, but it does get lonely.
---
No. I don't think that's correct. The daily reset timer is just unreliable. I just did it on my main and alts. My main had to wait 20 hours to get his daily while my alt just need to wait for 10 hours since they interacted with BIV (completed the nukashine main quest)
---
Is your stash full?
---
I've never used a prime but I'm about to. If I add the prime receiver to my TSE I can take it off again right?
---
No, it's the same mechanic as the Stashes
---
Yeah i mean you can only have 4 alts right? So yeah these low level legendaries are useful for a short period of time during leveling on each alt. 
---
But at least it's not exploding randomly, right? YAAAAAY TEAM WE DID IT!
---
Hahaha. Small steps I suppose. -_-
---
You should have tried to ride it :D
---
Only backpack is the civil war one but only is decoration
---
Where can I find this dlc everyone keep going on about? I checked the store and I only see fallout 76 and buy atoms.

I can clearly see that your glass is half full of salt. 
---
Player vending from a workshop is asking for pvp imo
---
You might be the first to spot the change. Any info around the door ? owner ?
---
Amen to that had some asshole do that shit to me trying to goad me into a fight so his low level friend could try and kill me. I didn't fall for it just sat back and watched him raise his bounty

Might wanna read thr post again, bub.
---
Ok it‚Äôs near the 3rd door on the same side of the road
---
I did! It was a little before my time, but I loved that movie lol.

Me and all my friends are tired of it. We just want to decorate our camps in peace. I don‚Äôt mind the occasional enemy attack from a wave of scorched, but when I‚Äôm level 30 and some jackass in power armor who‚Äôs level 200 comes in and levels all my work in minutes, it gets annoying. It‚Äôs forced me to build my camp far away in the middle of nowhere just to get away from these attacks. They‚Äôve gone up more recently as well. I‚Äôm hearing stories from other servers of people getting absolutely demolished 
---
Tacocatracecar in a nutshell when he griefs people and our squad shows up to mess him up and he just leaves.
---
Nope. We just ran through 2 silos at the same time. One was 165 hours, one was 191 hours.
---
At level 125 we have literally nothing to do besides launch nukes. Now we cant even do that. Right before the weekend too. Thanks Bethesda!
---
Remove any mods that you were using if on PC. Remove any customer.ini files also if in PC.
---
Shut down launcher. Clean files again . Verify and repair install. Reboot game should fix
---
Assuming you‚Äôre in pc? Restore stock ini file buddy
---
No and no.  Tried it and found no increase to unarmed. You can,however, have a friend shoot you with karma, though you will get the debuff after a minute.
---
Someone just dropped one in my room!
---
Did you use the Fermentor on your main alt? There's a bug going around where if you leave whatever drinks in there and you server hop and your house doesn't spawn, your drinks will end up in your stash box. If you were to ever touch them from the stash box. It will result in what's happening to you now. There is no fix currently.

LOL. 
---
You're welcome bro! I too didn't know that until somebody told me. 
---
Thanks you just saved me from wasting a perk.
---
It‚Äôs honestly really annoying. Like if you don‚Äôt people attacking you, then don‚Äôt get a bounty.
---
I think it‚Äôs been broke a while. I stopped doing those a few weeks back after I got burned a few times in s row. 
---
May I ask what you are playing on, please? The game is currently down to $40.00 for digital copy on [Microsoft.com](https://Microsoft.com). I have an XBox One S. Curious if the game is stable enough now to finally warrant a look.
---
I and several other folks have posted about these Daily issues for months.  I've even replied to Community Managers and had nothing.  I've sent tickets and got the usual 'scan, reinstall, etc.' response.  I finally have an active ticket running about this that is more of a dialogue.  But now since the patch Dailies aren't popping at all (even the ones that used to work) so...gg I guess?
---
I figured it out. Some guy snuck up on me and killed me. He (and I) were really cool about it. He let me have my stuff back, and he gave me a couple things as well
---
clipping through the world after this patch may be due to mods you have installed or custom ini file. remove both or update mods if any.
---
Xbox One, classic edition. It runs great for me, most of the time the game only stops cuz my wifi isn't great. You'll probably have an even better experience than I

Regardless of special points you can change your cards whenever you want, changing a high STR character from a melee specialist to a big guns specialist. There. That disputes your original argument that being able to use picklock skills without changing cards will create "master of all trades" characters. You can change whenever. You know this. It doesn't have to be a drastic change, but the SPECIAL skills cover so much that you can change a lot in an instant making specific, semi-permanent builds unrealistic
---
Is that the place with the house in the front and the boats in the back? My homestead is just up the cliff! Amazing view!
---
I couldn't, but my teammate could! So random..
---
Are u on ps4?
---
Well no emails of that nature, but thanks to LinkedIn's logging of who looks at your profile I know BGS's did peak at me a while back, though likely just to see if I was blowing hot air.
---
Every time he gets stuck I walk up and click X (I‚Äôm on PS4) and he always corrects his path and continues. 
---
Me neither at first had to look up the lyrics myself, didn't realise it was called Uranium initially so thought the hook was 'you ring me up, you ring me up' lol
---
Nukes in this game are awesome. Yeah, they could probably be improved in some ways, but just the fact that they exist, and there's this whole  process involved in launching them, and you can actually see the missile, and you can hear the explosion anywhere on the map is just awesome.
---
I miss Piper.
---
[removed]
---
Thanks, gonna take down the post not to cause drama then
---
Everyone already told it's the workshop mechanic that allows pvp at distance.
---
It may not be perfect but it's what it is now. 
---
Ummmm that's insane considering the difficulty to get the plan, I'd think that falls under bugs
---
His name was Jalad! 
---
I say we brute force it. Grab a couple people, section them off some numbers from 000000 to 999999 and then report back.
---
I truly want this game to succeed, but refused to look at it until "fixed." The new content release seems to like the devs feel the game is in a good enough place to start adding stuff on. Just feel the game needed another couple months to bake before being released.
---
Thank you, kind soul
---
I had to do that stuff too I was probably around 25 too. That‚Äôs what I made my scrub character for. But now that I think about it, I got the achievement for picking locks and I 100% picked locks during the beta. 
---
Just keep hacking them!I got mine done at like 56 hacks.
---
It doesn't now,  but it should.  Don't give up on this perk.   The + 6 strength from whiskey is awesome. 
---
I hope you find nothing but enjoyment from your experience my friend
---
Good call. Pitchforkers will dive in any chance they get to bash Bethesda but this issue isn‚Äôt really their fault. They don‚Äôt officially support mods or custom ini files so they don‚Äôt exactly test their builds with mods to see what happens. 
---
Gotcha thanks 
---
Just now seeing this. Fuuuuuuuck yeah!
---
Is this 20-minute recipe mission the entire "questline" or did I miss something?
---
Awesome! I was checking out that location just a few days ago...
---
Haha! Thank you, again!
---
Only problem now is Division 2 launches tomorrow! Been waiting for that one for a all year!
---
yes except for the 50 cal.
---
Oof I feel that
---
All i had budget for. 4 points of stability feels just real enough
---
Yes that should tell you cool down for each silo. Not sure if it or what if anything other than trying to tells you your character's cool down. 
---
He‚Äôs supposed to become a daily (not sure how long tho) and reward new recipes. 
---
Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

---
*Flesh* it out... teehee.
---
Yeah i got some achievements after the full release for things i did in the beta but not everything i did.
---
A buddy and I did this last week. I didn't get a drop and he got, well.... The often sought after legendary wood left leg. üò≤ 
---
I buy them to support the game.  No money means no game.  
---
Staying there when you had all the power to leave is nonsense.
---
Just a text bug, unfortunately
---
thks its a really fun area to build in but it can take some trial and error
---
I've gotten plans in the last 2 days from a 65. I kill 20-30 a day farming fissures. All are 2-4 shots with an instigating gauss. I think they are fine. Otherwise everyone would be farming them. 
---
Yeah they are releasing it in waves to be able to handle bugs better all the content is being  released in one week intervals. This week was heavy weapons balance and brewing next week is pvp servers or the parade event. I don‚Äôt remember which maybe both? I‚Äôd have to look at the road map to be sure. definitely check it out on their website though. 
---
Not sure how you got away with that. The glitch was actually bad. It allowed you to put multiple in but would eat everything beyond the 1 it needed. Kinda like feed the people eating peoples gear 
---
That works along the path most times, but I've tried in in these recent instances and it doesnt work. In the clips you'll see me mashing the A (xbox) button on him and he doesnt correct it 
---
x-01 quantum
---
&gt; a modder fixed it
---
Its almost like the devs could just go on Nexus and see what the players want in their game.
---
Or they could just ignore that and do whatever.
---
Ok that makes me feel better. Cause as I was thinking about it, I got the achievement for picking locks and there‚Äôs no chance that I didn‚Äôt pick a lock during the beta. I pick almost every one I see. So logically if the lock one worked this one has to too. 
---
No, PC. I forgot to mention that in the post..
---
This is an old issue, but it is still a frustrating one.
---
Take this with you it will keep you safe:
---
F
---
I'll look forward to that.  I'm on pc.
---
Damn, I mean I appreciate them trying to avoid bugs but you‚Äôd think they should be able to release most of it at once
---
Or a legendary drill !!!
---
Typo, now corrected :D
---
The order of mysteries is a good one for earlier on. 
---
Dang. I can't help u if I do have it. I know that's where I got it. Godluck and good speed!
---
Real nice reading what great gamers you all are, and it sounds like fun, but what about those of us who are afraid to even wander lol because we KNOW we can hardly kill a thing. PLEASE add an EASY MODE to make combat a lot easier for those of us who love scavenging, building, just hanging about in a more relaxing way, etc., instead of always having to kill and worry about being killed. I think we "Easy Mode" peeps are an untapped well.
---
 One thing I see as being woefully neglected about the altar in Helvetia is the fact that they are using *fusion cores* as candles. Thanks *can't* be safe.
---
Depending what system you are on, the system achievements list them in the order they should technically be done in. If you follow this you should level up as you go and be the appropriate level to complete each one in the order listed. These are not the in game challenges, but the system achievements. 
---
That‚Äôs ok :) 
---
My base is surrounded by firecracker berries now. For some reason.
---
It's just hearsay, nobody has real footage of the elusive Sheepsquatch. üòâ
---
I got a recipe for a honey moonshine thing, a friend got two different champagne recipes
---
I actually got him to his destination and my reward was thanks. No payout. Definitely broken quest.
---
When I'm on the train to work I often stare at the buildings I pass by and try to imagine how I will scale the buildings with marsupial mutation.
---
Pretty sure they said they will be doing this in a future patch. 
---
I can't either. 196 hours. I haven't launched since Saturday evening. Teammate is 200 some, he launched Monday night. 
---
Fusion cores found in suits in the wild are all 25% or lower now. That certainly wasn't in the patch notes.
---
Lmao so you want to be a bitch?
---
Player abusing the way pvp works to repeatedly kill you over and over? Leave the server and lose all your shit!
---
Who cares about reporting the terrible pvp mechanics and voicing your opinion. Put up with the unbalanced bullshit
---
Probably also to keep players coming back week after week. It also lines up with the release of new content on the atom shop so I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs not a coincidence. 
---
Get this past 3 weeks
---
Someone just did in my room but of course it crashed 
---
You're right, they're not. 
---
And I think crops are maturing much faster now.
---
Oh cool as, i never really knew or could be stuffed learning how to use mods
---
The fact we spend Caps to travel at all is pretty fucking stupid. Who are we paying?
---
Have to be at a certain level or something? 
---
Not to mention any bottle of alcohol will fill your thirst by about 50% (pre patch) 
---
Just give it time it will load but try 10 15 mi a haha so shit
---
I run all rifleman perks, bloody mess, Adrenal Reaction, demolition, covert (2.5x), and nerd rage. At 20% health my Bloodied Explosive Lever Action does just over 700. At 10% it‚Äôs over 1000. At 20% you can one shot just about everything aside from scorchbeast (about 4-5 shots), players (2-3 shots full health). Base SPECIAL is something like 1-15-6-4-8-14-7... with Unyielding and mutations perception and agility go up to 28-31 range.
---
My biggest surprise was that you couldn‚Äôt make robot companions 
---
Yep, I even did the queen today without disconnecting, having her fly off the map or having her corpse disappear!
---
Initiating PVP with a team should affect the whole team.
---
Combat loggers will thrive until an adjustment is made there. &amp; Yes, I think a great many of us are tired of it.
---
Ran across one of these events today, Mr. Messenger was halfway in the ground, and the part i needed to fix him was so far submerged I couldn't grab it.
---
For those affected:
---
Is it not in wall decor? Maybe in misc, but those two places are the only places I would think it is.
---
Nobody tell him about the TNT domes . . .
---
Picard and Dathon... at El-Adrel
---
Look on the forums there are no capacitors that do more damage for some dumb reason.
---
Wow, are you that single minded?
---
1. Not everyone with a bounty leaves because your after them and they are cowards. Not everyone can play 8-9 hours a day and have real life issues to deal with like home, work, children. So maybe they logged off and didnt run away from your elite uberness.
---
2. Many players have accidentally got bounties, Ive had two where I wasnt paying attention and lockpicked at a held workshop. My mate has got a couple from accidentally shooting another players camp.
---
Take the blinkers off and take a moment to realise the world doesnt revolve around your assumptions.  
---
Earbuds generally only register as a speaker with pc‚Äôs. If you want to make sure, make sure theyre plugged in before you start the game. Then turn your audio settings to area. If you dont see a speaker thing with your name in the bottom left of the game then they won‚Äôt work. Generally you need a head set
---
We werent notified of workshops being taken, all of them were there at one point and they could atill do it, sounds like something else bub.
---
Thank you, literally as soon as I got in game a few moments ago, I plugged them in. Asked someone if they could hear me and then I saw my speaker icon at the bottom.
---
In the pools behind the Vault-tec Agricultural Research center in Flatwoods.  Don't forget to equip the green thumb perk card.
---
QA is bad bananas. Have you ever considered working in IT? You could go far with that analytical mind. 
---
Is your mother in law named Lily Bowens?
---
I blew myself up with my explosive shotgun. But my boyfriend ended up on top of a billboard.  
---
Now the funning thing is many years ago in the Midrealm (SCA thing) he was a fighter and they were off to a war. The king of the Midrealm told all his fighter ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take the Meridies flag‚Äù  it wasn‚Äôt  the smartest thing during his reign to show a bright shinny Burton to a bunch of drunk testosterone high men and then tell them, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt push it!‚Äù 
---
Well a few...dozen drinks later that flag was looking pretty sweet. So my boyfriend grabs the flag and takes off across the battle field with the whole Meridies army on his heels, and half the Midrealm. He out runs them then goes across the interstate and climbs up a billboard and hung the flag from the top.  And kissed his chance if ever being a knight goodby. 
---
He has never lived this down. 
---
So there really couldn‚Äôt have been a better place for the nunkashine to take him. 
---
Do you suppose they did that so you can't nuke the new DLC area?  Otherwise low level people without power armor would never be able to run that quest.
---
Martial artist is a melee perk. It should have never affected anything besides melee. 
---
Your new mission is to start trying 4 digit numbers,  start with 1111 and get back to us when you find it üòÖ
---
Also travelled to a few events only to have them not activate and disappear. Kind of annoying if you've fast travelled from far away to find the area pretty much empty
---
Because he was severely hungover and the brain wasn‚Äôt working yet
---
Yeah I mean me personally am not going to comeback for tiny updates every week, if anything I‚Äôll play when they‚Äôre all out, but hey that‚Äôs just me 
---
It‚Äôs got a 0.02% drop rate from Mire events and dailes I‚Äôm pretty sure.
---
Hhmmm maybe the third item was a drink. I didn‚Äôt look in the aid tab for anything. I was stoked on the letter plans. I‚Äôm sure if you do it a couple more times you will get everything I‚Äôm sure
---
Animal House is timeless.  Just like Monty Python and the Holy Grail. 
---
Or fast travel and hide all over.  Like I'm not gonna spend 300 caps chasing you...  Personally I don't think yous should be able to FT with a bounty
---
I‚Äôve had that happen also. I believe there working on a timer for that one. 
---
Lemonade stand is still going. But I‚Äôm about to give up for the night due to someone in the community trolling with death laws and the like. Add me in the next 10-15 mins if you still need recipes as I‚Äôm shutting down afterwards. This is ridiculous someone goes to such lengths to troll... Massive thanks to u/UND00MED for taking care of business when they won‚Äôt leave. Besides that hiccup, come on down for fresh lemonade and recipes before we‚Äôre closed!
---
Considering his jumpsuit is found in the Capitol Wasteland it seems a bit unlikely he could get that far by himself
---
100% agree. They simply need to allow all items to be sunk partly into the world floor when required.
---
Yea that‚Äôs the real question, how long it will last. I myself plan on doing it everyday if I can! I planted corn and razor wheat at my camp for brewing purposes. 
---
I got it to work at about 90 terminals across 2 characters - it went off on my second character
---
Happened to me last night.  Destroyed about half my camp before I could log off.  Two guys over 150 against me at level 21..
---
Someone dropped a nuke on the server I was on an hour ago.
---
&gt;Vending machines should really be put in the whitesprings vendor hallway. Add free fast travel inside the building and you are set!
---
i wish we could tag all the bethesda employees so they will make it happen for sure
---
What? You took down a Queen? What did you use?
---
.02? That seems excessively low 
---
The hunger thing? Hasn't that been the case since forever?
---
a little bit softer now
---
Sorry last question, but do more unyielding pieces increase the damage of rifles? I thought that only helped with melee? Outside of perk cards, does a perception bonus do more damage? I appreciate the help
---
Hilarious, I was using it today and thought, was the stash box here always?? 
---
Do we have a list of all craftable brews yet?
---
Nope is new, wasn't there last update. 
---
Can confirm. It needs to be dialled back a good amount.
---
As a hold-over I can recommend using the butcher's bounty perk in perception, and obviously water is easy with just boiling some collected from a stream.
---
Lol how can you be on this sub and miss the biggest update in a month wtf. 
---
Still have any left or nah
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that it doesn‚Äôt increase rifle damage. 
---
Yea but then the Scorched blaming the robots for taking their jobs are gonna start complaining about the mariachi bands and you know where that ends up.
---
That's always been the negative side of it. 
---
Maybe it was broken and they fixed it but I swear that's always been the case
---
Happened every time I tried to place a wire anywhere, until I used some Rad-X to suppress mutations.  Then I could connect things.  Maybe some incompatibility with Marsupial?
---
It‚Äôs been there from. While which is why I stopped using it 
---
SBs are annoying enough already without having them "mutate" mid-fight and heal like other legendaries.
---
Allright look i told you how things are right now with workshops. Your post, like the ones that pop up twice everyday,won't be considered because whiny posts are not constructive. I don't have much else to say so  i'm just gonna move on.bye
---
What system you on?
---
Yea it‚Äôs just visible now
---
Why do I get the uneasy feeling this was another stealth nerf?
---
Shit I‚Äôm close to 100 and I still don‚Äôt know everything but I‚Äôve found I know more than most. I‚Äôve destroyed people way over my level and they‚Äôre just like how tf did you get this way
---
Make CAMPing great again
---
My only complaint with frat house is all the red cups. The fraternity must've been a bunch of commies.
---
I felt the exact opposite. To each their own I suppose!
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm not saying it shouldn‚Äôt. But I‚Äôve repeatedly had *other* players initiate PvP with me and then their goon squad jumps out from behind the bushes and 3 or 4v1 me, I‚Äôm simply asking for a flag of some sort that lets me know, hey this guy has a team that may or may not be close by.
---
Yeah it's also got a lot of containers  around it as well a bit E from vault 76
---
Im pretty sure the brewing daily is permenent. Its the faschnaut festival that will be limited time.
---
There's always been a downside to speed demon. It's not that hard to keep up with the food and water needs.
---
then take a fucking walk, dont be lazy smh
---
Cardio my dude.
---
CAR DEE O
---
Exactly! I want lower risk higher reward, not high risk low reward. I have killed S.B's solo and found nothing but crap. Then repair and resupply for hours. 
---
It‚Äôs not even a companion. Just NPCs would be nice. 
---
god howard
---
u/Ladydevann help! üòî
---
Speed demon always made you 50% more Hungry/thirsty. The previous patch changed it so it only affects while moving. I thought that was a fair compromise. 
---
it's really frustrating, I've come to terms with the fact that i'll likely never get to complete overseers journey but if I can't do dailies on top of that I'm pretty limited in what I can do in game on most days. 
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I did.
---
Well,  minus the server hopping,  technically.   I logged out to run errands,  logged in to play with friends,  saw the ‚Äúvintage nukashine‚Äù in my stash and took it.
---
How was this not tested?   This is a serious fucking bug.  Literally game breaking.
---
Dude thank you. I was trying to farm him for hours read about the double spawn... first try he spawned.
---
You state they were inexperienced while you admit to repairing damaged items while under attack or threat of attack. How experienced does that make you look? Sure there are exploits but I doubt that‚Äôs what you and your friend the crybaby experienced. He most likely fell into their trap and attacked them opening himself up to PvP and then got his face smashed in and immediately went Pew pew on a reddit post crying life is unfair. The devs are fully aware of the PvP mechanics and crying on Reddit ain‚Äôt gonna change anything. Want to help bust exploiters? then get proof to Beth of what they were doing. As of right now you‚Äôre just a couple of bitches clogging up my 76 feed who don‚Äôt like the way the game is currently designed. I‚Äôve been playing since beta as well and yes getting killed by better players with better gear did happen back in the day. Don‚Äôt want to engage in PvP  then limit your exposure and run or hide when trouble comes knocking like the sheep you are and don‚Äôt take workshops. That‚Äôs just how the game is setup. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt even take a full 50cal clip to kill a lvl 50 scorched beast... I feel like they are more of a nuisance than anything. Just kill them so they stop screaming so loud in my ears. Too easy to kill SB would be my complaint, so yes make them legendary. Just not ALL of them, I still want to kill the SBQ without getting constantly being recked.
---
You said ‚Äú...for their Instigating, explosive, antiarmor deathclaw penis‚Äù and that is my new must-have weapon.
---
Also, if we‚Äôre talking economy here, why isn‚Äôt the rarest in game item (perfectly preserved pie) worth more at vendors?
---
Probably server hopping the various events in Morgantown, but tbh it feels like the best way to get XP in the early gane is to just do a bunch of the main quests
---
Thanks dude. First time reading this he showed up.
---
Awwww the one change I did NOT want to see was Unstacking Foundations..
---
Exactly. What's prime receiver? I haven't seen one and  I've been playing the game since it came out. 
---
I don't think it was working before then, because as of this update I am loosing hunger and food a lot faster and this is the only change on my character.... unless they doubled how dangerous parasites are. 
---
then it must have broke because before now It wasn't draining as fast as it is. 
---
Ok, I think it was broken before because it wasn't draining as fast as it is... the only other thing it could be is if they doubled the parasites drain rate. 
---
I wasn‚Äôt even trying to mention bugs,  those are a given. The food decay rates may qualify as a bug, I‚Äôll give you that. But the others I listed? No, those can‚Äôt be bugs, bugs don‚Äôt work that way. Those are deliberate changes. 
---
It is, but I think it wasn't working before the patch. 
---
Unlike other outfits the description says "unlocks a vanity outfit crafting plan for all characters" so I checked my pip boy and bench but didn't find anything.  I'm going to check again when I log back in. 
---
The game has been stuttering a lot on PS4 since the update for me, too.
---
Then it hasn't been working because I have noticed a noticable bump in how often I need to eat and drink. 
---
Yup, that may be an intentional change, but it could just be a bug too... I wasn‚Äôt even trying to mention bugs, those happen all the time. I‚Äôm pointing out the clearly deliberate, intentional changes. Like milking Brahmin now, too.
---
I‚Äôve been saving every single bobble head I‚Äôve ever collected since beta in my stash just for this. Praise the lord and pass the ammunition!
---
As an active member i think that is hilarious! I can say I've been sober for many a 24hrs, but my character drinks often, especially when over encumbered.
---
Thanks man. You said inside of the pools and I was like I dont see anything.(it was night) Got closer and they blend in so well! Lol 
---
Sounds cool
---
Ooh yes like I said I love right across from there it‚Äôs a very nice place to collect loot
---
That‚Äôs fine too. I like the small updates gives me something to play every weekend for a few hrs rather than over loading me with so much stuff that I couldn‚Äôt complete in the time I have available to play. 
---
Yeah why did they have the camps get destroyed by players, I understand by enemys, but why players the only thing that comes from that is harassment .
---
LOL
---
Still need them? Sorry I had to get off till now
---
I‚Äôm confused what‚Äôs good about Morgantown?? 
---
Just to fuck low levels or is there a point. All my good flux/grinding spots are south. 
---
Good Vid.
---
Ah didn't know it was a joke. Sound like a cool option for those who don't want to drunk want to find a use for the fermentation station. Thanks for the heads up. 
---
Edited topic to note it is my bad on the speed demon. 
---
I helped get all this info for them btw XD I got a bunch more to help with as well
---
My feet are 0.1 inches off the ground
---
Fermenter can use up to 10 pounds of your stash. 
---
yeah, you sound pretty offended
---
That‚Äôs fair enough, idk I‚Äôve kinda given up on it a little bit. I don‚Äôt have anyone to play with so I‚Äôve kinda drifted from it, but idk maybe I‚Äôll get back into it at some point 
---
Found the quitter.
---
I want the nuka lamp
---
Great a new wave of griefers!  Exactly what this game needs...
---
Have you tried brewing a beer and drinking it before it ferments? That's what it sounds like to me but I haven't had that one yet so it's just a guess.
---
Todd says you‚Äôre holding it wrong.
---
Seriously! I was so excited to rebuild my camp but the gitches make it so bad i cant fully finish it
---
At my Camp I often spawn INSIDE a cliff. Very funny view of the world from in there
---
So, you owning a workshop was how they were able to PVP you. 
---
Let me preface this by saying I don‚Äôt agree with this design, but currently if you own a workshop, that workshop can be contested by a player, and then that player or anyone on his team can attack you in full PVP anywhere on the map. It‚Äôs not an exploit, per se, but a very poor design.
---
The other one that is more of a bug than an exploit is that a Wanted player attacking you can put you in full PVP (even if you are in pacifist!) if you have certain reactive damage features. I‚Äôve specifically tested Electrically Charged and it happens with it, I‚Äôve also tested Reactive Plates and it does NOT happen with it. I haven‚Äôt tested Unstable Isotope, Welded Rebar, or damage-on-block legendaries (although those are pretty irrelevant)
---
Oh, yes, because a player with a 60 cap bounty just has such a hard life with so many responsibilities. That they just have to log off right when you‚Äôre attacking them. In fact, they are so busy they‚Äôve clumsily ranked up a 60 cap bounty by accident. By the way, I‚Äôm not talking about players with 5, 10, or 15 cap bounties. I‚Äôm referring to wanted players with 60+ cap bounties. Get off your high horse, mate. 
---
Where did that lore come from? There is 0 lore attached to this vault at all. The only thing I found was a fan written article. 
---
Well, I usually carry two rifles with me but I am more of a crit/sneak build. They doubled the stash size from 400 to 800 so I don't see why you would be overencumbered unless you are carrying a ton of weapons, ammo and meds without weight reduction perks.
---
There‚Äôs also a few spawns around in the water in the Southeast Cranberry Bog
---
+karma 
---
Dang, too soon.
---
Doubtful. The friends of mine that got banned were dupers. I warned them against it before the ban wave hit. I told them that they will eventually crack down on it, and they laughed at me. I had the last laugh when they got the e-mail lol. They hardly PvP'd but my friends could be different from the vast majority of people.
---
I'll check it out, maybe I'll find higher framerates.
---
Has anyone found the legendary shop yet?
---
This is vault 65. There is 0 mention of it anywhere in any fallout material so we will end up getting information about it eventually. There is also a door for vault 51 in the data file which also has no lore attached to it
---
The bug is you having an EXTRA 100lbs on login. If they ever fix it, you‚Äôll just have 350 always. 
---
I misinterpreted the original post. I'll still leave the comment though, it was a good write.
---
Its hard to tell what was and wasn't intentional. Some small change can cause a chain reaction in code. 
---
OK thanks for the help
---
I would love wallpaper for the brick building set tbh
---
Then welcome back.
---
What loot? You mean junk that you can literally find anywhere....
---
People just take my workshops and leave after nuking my base with orbital strikes and explosive mini guns and they just have to stand still and poof they can‚Äôt die
---
Then welcome back, and please don't destroy my camp when bored.
---
That would be good because eventually you will get every recipe and potential plans
---
Thank u
---
It was fun, yes, but the way they marketed it as a ‚Äúquest line‚Äù seems a bit of a stretch. 5 or 6 missions that are easy to do wasn‚Äôt much of a challenge. But it definitely is a move in the right direction from Bethesda. 
---
There is so mutch more to it than that I don't know where to begin. They as already are balanced by weapon weight, vats, accuracy, range, different specials and legondaries. There is alot more to it than raw dps.....if dps was the only factor yes everyone would be a heavy gunner with a 50. If you just want auto crits that's one thing, but the other changes your suggesting are game breaking not balance.
---
Me too. I checked everything and cannot find it. I just went to graft on station though and got it lol
---
Player vending machines are going to be able to be seen on the map 
---
Lol, I never duped. In fact, I never used any glitch. It takes the challenge away ;) Also, I don't destroy CAMPs myself and I barely run into people that do. Maybe you just have bad luck?
---
This point exactly.  
---
Heart of the Enemy and Queen of the Hunt. Two, let's call them 'endgame' dailies that I'd like to do.  I love playing and want to really love playing even more but the things to do have been pretty slim with 3/4 of the Dailies not working.  Only ones I can count on are Ecol. Balance, 1 Camden Park per day, the occasional Trick Or Treat, rarely Buried With Honor, Cop A Squatter (which itself may not complete about 1/4 of the time)...and that's it.  Rest is hoping for certain events.
---
I actually started leveling an alt character so I can see if I have the same issue or if it's tied to my main.
---
I mostly used a bunch of guys standing with me shooting heavy weapons. And we were able to pull  her out of the edge of nuke zone where the bloodied builds did major damage. 
---
I‚Äôm a vats crits sniper in a stealthboy X01 with ultracite TSE rifles and then a SS wardrum when she‚Äôs on the ground (with just Incisor/MA and still Vats crits)  
---
Happened last night.  Still salty.  Mostly awesome people who want to help.  And a few jerks.
---
I think I did it 2 maybe 3 times on my main before it vanished.  It definitely wasn't just once.
---
What about the lemonade stand!? Do you know where that spawns exactly?
---
Loots from a level 50, 4 kills in this evening.Loots https://imgur.com/a/p4iODJt
---
Use class freak to remove most of the negative effects? 
---
Yeah, I suppose... But I'd kinda like to see the new interiors with that junk placed there as it was intended by the devs, and see any new item models added with the DLC. Not a completely empty shell of an interior.
---
This is either master bait or a very sad, misguided post. If this is your first Fallout game, that's also sad. Who _starts_ with a spin-off?
---
Wait, there are vending machines now?
---
You probably shouldn't post about blatant exploit of a bug
---
Wallace should always sell the plan.
---
I never used it in 4, so i don't know
---
I am having a similar issue with Bourbon and Agility. I have to drink fresh bourbon and land a sneak attack. I have drank a few bourbons and landed a few attacks but nothing ticks off my quest. It only changes when the bourbon wears off and it wants me to drink another one.  
---
I fall in the "people who help" category. I always leave my plans in registers at vendors and by the vault lol. Once Survival Mode hits, though, that may change since that encourages open PvP with the leaderboard system and all
---
Not true. I have 2 characters: one has speed demon, the other doesn't. I can't go 5-10 minutes without eating or drinking w/ speed demon otherwise my ap is drastically cut. Without speed demon I can go 30-40 minutes without eating before it becomes a problem. These time frames are approximate, but there is a noticeable difference in the time it takes for food/water to drain. 
---
Nah, not a big fan of alcohol, I prefer Nukaweed.
---
But I really like baseball grenades 
---
Sorry I dont, looks to be along roadways though from pics Ive seen from people.
---
"but the place you died and all markers are gone"
---
That's what happens when you die overencumbered haha
---
Can't work out if it's just that all the mutations I have are finally working or yeah.. they've changed something because I'm going through food and drink so much I'm going to have to change yet more perk cards around or the game is going to be 60% grinding for food
---
Misread this as a recipe for one cup of Nuka Cola and was immediately confused as to how one glass would use 3 cups of sugar.
---
I believe patch 6 added a standard receiver for the 50cal, although I haven‚Äôt verified that myself
---
1. PC
---
2. OgyJoe
---
3. Screenshot/video would not show the issue.
---
4. Weapon aim/zoom is not working. The issue began with Patch 7. I have tried multiple characters and weapons. I have verified the control settings to make sure I am using the right button. Google has not yielded any results for this issue.
---
dlc is free it was the last patch, and all info I found of upcoming events and dates was on their twitter page  https://twitter.com/fallout 
---
Supposedly outside of watoga but I ran around everywhere. It is a random encounter tho I guess
---
Damn, I was just one overweight. Ok thanks.
---
Should be ‚Äúgit‚Äù ain‚Äôt it?
---
There's a mod for it
---
It like a tiny bench but religious.
---
Thanks you are probably right. But a few things I wonder like, should I be collecting junk similar to FO4 where things like screw drivers are not good but duct tape is? Also, is melee viable in this game without power armor? I like to do sneak builds in FO4.
---
They are intended as anti-Scorched mods. As-is they still typically do more damage vs everything
---
 They do a ton more damage vs Scorched. I‚Äôve heard 30% and I‚Äôve heard 50% more. 
---
They‚Äôre fine. 
---
On pc? Perk loadout manager
---
Yeah the systems dumb 
---
It was patched with patch 6
---
If you scrap damaged crops it creates one of the crop and one fertilizer. 
---
So, scrap your damaged crops.  Then use your CAMP to repair all fully damaged structures, then replant your crops.  
---
I off have a whole server at my trading post. Not to brag or anything really, I just love it when something manages to bring a whole server together and everyone can have fun and talk, team up, be silly, and just enjoy some down time in the wastelands. Truly doing our best to rebuild
---
Nuka-heads*
---
Depends on your level and perks, I use Camden park to level up my alt's .. but the scorch there are 6-32, so it can be rough there in the beginning. If you low level, hit the Nuke Cola plant and the Lewis and Son's next door and a little down there road to the graveyard, there a bunch of enemies there, once you ready head back to Camden Park.
---
Also Summerville isn't a bad place with low level supers, also there some low levels in the creek in the same area, you get caps from the super's .. also Helvetia isn't a bad place with low level scorch.
---
Thanks! Almost bought something I would use
---
You wanna see crazy?! I'm replying to a 14-hour hold comment!
---
H E H A S A S C E N D E D
---
Had one guy hide at the bottom of the lake beside Thunder Mountain.  Was pretty entertaining trying to take him out. 
---
Yeah I can get up to around 5 or so through the airport, but those other five levels on my first alternate account took like 5 hours. I just don't wanna have that dumb grinding period where I struggle to get around because I don't have a bunch of mobility perks. 
---
You're HOA material, Muchacho!  
---
Tell us more about this trading post. Discount for items being given away as prizes on a Wasteland game show? :)
---
&gt; As of right now you‚Äôre just a couple of bitches clogging up my 76 feed
---
You are reaching max autism
---
This is good, thanks
---
Log in early in the morning. That is what I do when I am looking for something particular
---
I saw a few people on fo76 market and here loitering near it so people could join in. If all else fails, take a look through posts.
---
I agree as well. Although, it will be nice playing with my buddies again. Hopefully they learned their lesson lol
---
I used the nuka plant on my main once or twice and it was very lucrative! Camden certainly scares me a bit, but it's s good idea! Thanks :) 
---
If I could just get a dog üò≠
---
Maybe i want to use said broken items? We were minding our own business and we were attacked and one hit without being in pvp bub, cant do shit to prevent it theres no showing experience in being killed due to an exploit in the system. And i will be getting evidence of these exploits theres no need to tell me twice I want to enjoy this game including the pvp but this isnt exactly fair since im not engaging. Maybe if the game didnt have these exploits and shit you woudnt be seeing these threads bub. Well in this case its more than just gear, bub.
---
I checked earlier and it doesn‚Äôt say anything about done 7
---
You really only need to travel to one if you know what spawns where. 
---
They were always broken for me
---
If you claim a workshop your only in PVP when somebody starts contesting it. Until then, you're just like everyone else. That's the deal. It's what you agree to. You're not immediately in the mode. I take it as an agreement to die once per workshop owned. 'Tis the price for those sweet plans and resources. 
---
&gt;How do you make ultracite ammo?
---
Normal ammo materials plus stable flux. 
---
I have 20k steel after today. I'm on Xbox. You want some?
---
I personally pick up everything and scrap it all into base components. Make sure to stash your junk often because when you die you drop everything in your junk tab and it is used for EVERYTHING. 
---
Melee is super op, it's the only build that has damage scaling based on special stat.
---
Sneak builds are also super awesome but require specific perk investment. If you get your sneak high enough you can follow enemies like a shadow, it's rather hilarious to be honest. 
---
My alt was able to launch twice this morning. First was a successful SBQ run. The second was for another go at her. It crashed the server evidently as my entire team was disconnected. 
---
My high level teammate who has launched countless nukes was unable to launch due to the cooldown timer. These were my alt's first launches solo. I'm sure my main would be afflicted by the bug. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôve figured out a few of the event spawns but not all. 
---
I got a recipe for a leaded champagne belini. It increases your fall speed
---
LOL, I don't see any T-51B PA.
---
Some are additive to the critical Multiplier, some are additive to base weapon damage on Critical, others are only additive to critical on VATS critical strike which does not list the multiplier.
---
Understandable, but what I dont get is how do you lose caps by teleporting to areas?
---
No it's not lmao probably when you're like level 200 they were 321
---
Wow...I have more than 500 hours and I didn't know that...
---
April 9
---
I've seen the lemonade stand across from the Overseer's camp, southwest of the old truck on the road. Also, if you cross the bridge from the Overseer's camp and turn north into the woods, there is another random spawn location not far away where he can also appear.
---
Player vending will be visible on the map
---
I've been reduced to just server hopping in the hopes of some events to do, finally broke down and bought the outfit I wanted as without the dailies my chances for it were pretty slim. 
---
I saw a robobrain mr gutsy the other day. 
---
I suppose it's under camp resources - brahmin pen.
---
&gt;Your words -  Like if you don‚Äôt want people attacking you, then don‚Äôt get a bounty. 
---
You lump EVERYONE with a bounty in the same basket. When I get a bounty I dont hide I wait for someone to kill me, I fucked up I accept the consequences.
---
A CryoLater, if you will
---
Same.
---
Not a bad idea, could allow for some decent jumpscares if some of the petrified corpses could suddenly attack
---
I always thought the Bog should have had post-Brotherhood Scorched decked out in power armour. 
---
Ooh! I hadn‚Äôt even thought of a typewriter on my desk‚Äîgood idea!
---
Perfect.  Thanks
---
Sorry that this is late but why consumer cigarettes when harvesting honey
---
This is very reasonable. I would settle for a five minute cool down. Too much in the contestor's favor already. 
---
That's what the outhouse is for. üòâ
---
I thought the constructor armor was designed to give a extra 100lbs of weight. That‚Äôs what the horn people made it for but also I thought just power suits gave some of a boost to that anyway. 
---
Blitz is OP, if it's like FO4, people with guns don't stand a chance against melee.
---
it was.   i reduced some crap out of there and it worked!  thank you

This is true

We're having a Nukashine cocktail party tomorrow night (Friday the 15th) at 4pm EST usa. ON PC, at the WS bar. We're going to actually play "Nukashine roulette". BYONukashine 
---
yeah i logged off and back in and the "fermented" portion of the beer was gone and it was just labled "beer" now.    drank it and it worked fine after that.  
---
Yeah, it's terrible.
---
i logged off and then back on again and it seemed to change my beer from "Fermented" to just a regular beer.    it might work for you i'm not sure though.

Cheating on unmodded consoles is totally a thing. I dont want to share anything more detailed. But the capability of using usb devices with consoles dont require a modded console anymore. 
---
sometimes I don't get why some melee players only have 1 weapon in their inventory. You gotta be flexible! Here's a Bruce Lee quote for ya "Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless ‚Äî like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend."
---
You're the kind of person that duped the most lmao 
---
those random resource nodes can be pretty handy for sure.
---
What about when you've developed a nukashine addiction?
---
Asking for a friend.
---
Kill it and rebuild for more milk :)
---
&gt;I can‚Äôt really kill a scorch beast. I‚Äôm doing something wrong apparent. 
---
I can kill a level 80 in like 5 hits once they land, but otherwise I just stand there taking sonic blasts to the face and plinking away with my back up rifle. It's one of the only encounters in the game where it sucks to be a melee player. 
---
What does brahim milk do? I have never looked.
---
Is it used for recipes?
---
I'd still play 76 just like I still occasionally play 3, New Vegas, and 4. I'm not even finished my first play through, yet, after over a hundred hours, and I find CAMP building, the main story and exploring to be rewarding and enjoyable experiences. It feels now more than ever that I have full control over my character. I can scavenge through shops and buildings for scrap without thinking "I'm the most important person in the Wasteland, I'm above this &gt;:(". It's a fun, day-to-day survival game with enough to keep me coming back, just like every other game has enough to keep me coming back.
---
I can't understand why the most people,  not you,  can't separate mods and real cheating anymore.
---
Did you ever get them? I have some that I would trade off to ya.
---
and now the game froze while in my camp and trying to get into power armor. Log out, log in and power armor has disappeared.  apparently Bethesda has never heard of regression testing. 
---
Nice
---
OP, thanks for taking these. I'm on PC, don't use mods. Two issues so far:
---
1. Disease timers are not reliable; diseases run longer than the timer. Picked up Glowing Pustules, believe the duration is 1 hour. An hour later I still had it. Thought that was odd but maybe I'm wrong and it hadn't been an hour. Logged out for dinner (\~ 40 mins), logged back in. Still have it, didn't look at the timer. 10 mins later I got The Blight, also an hour duration. Logged out \~ 30 mins later with GP at 18 mins left and TB at 27 mins left. Upon login both were changed to 29 mins left. 
---
2. Fix it Good is not repairing my Handmade to 200%. First time I repaired today I thought maybe its my bad, could have used the wrong card. Second time I repaired with the same result, and I made sure 100% no foolin' that the max rank Fix It Good card was equipped. Hope this is just me and no one else is having the issue; unlike diseases there's no workaround til solved.
---
It's raider torso with buttressed mod? It's not the best tier one, but the one before it. My buddy modified his recently and it lost the "hood" when he maxed it. I don't remember the name exactly, there are 4 tiers I think and it's the 3rd.
---
Interacting with a Brahmin gives you milk. Try it in Flatwoods
---
Camden is pretty rough from 1-10, but after 10, it's not bad especially if you in PA, it's a lot of enemies, lots of loot, plus 1-3 fusion cores, I spend a lot of time here. I set up my camp just outside of Camden on the water, so I have water purifiers, crops and a camp going, so I can spawn there. Also dailies for your daily challenges, love the spot for me personally. Once you get Raider PA, it's a pretty easy, plus a vendor for daily selling.
---
Poor thing, though:(
---
Fallout 76 anti cheat flags accounts for  tools they running with fo76 and takes screenshots if Smth seems fishy. 
---
I'm tired of having my damn corn shot down by my super mutant neigbors and spending more corn repairing it than I get from harvesting, lol
---
Dumb da dumb dumb duuuummmmbbbb
---
Bun bub bub bub bub bub. Sure let me use my camp items while under attacked great idea bub. You and your friend are clueless. 
---
I agree, went to a farm, Farmed up a bunch of stuff took it to my camp started putting it all out and it spoiled before I could set it all out. 
---
What does the milk give you? Does it just quench your thrust?
---
I tried with purchased and crafted bourbon. And nothing worked. I just restarted my game on xbox and gonna give it a try on a new server. 
---
Removes 25 rads and makes you lose food and water slower
---
This must be bugged. It‚Äôs not in the mothman menu either. I‚Äôve swept through every possible build menu / submenu and it‚Äôs simply not there. Checked all the crafting stations to be sure it wasn‚Äôt under any of the quest craft tabs.
---
Well myself and a couple friends who also act as Vendors set up a trading post by the Wixton Homestead on xbox. We usually run it from 8:30a to 1:30p (Eastern) but it always seems runs over into the night lol
---
We originally were set up in New Gad by the anchor which is where we got our name "Old Anchor Trading Co." We ended up moving to due to a few trolls nuking us. We decided on Wixton Homestead as it was in the "nuke safe" area and as it would be easier for low levels to access.
---
We are set up with 10 "booths" for other vendors to come and sell and buy out of. A few of us regularly make low level armor and weapons as well as some ammo to give to new players free of charge to help get them started, we are also having happy to answer any questions they may have. We also provide free water for anyone that needs it.
---
It's not uncommon for us to have 5 to 10 people waiting to get in to the world as the server is often full. 
---
It's always fun and there is always a good laugh or two or more. 
---
I'm personally hoping that we can expand to multiple servers as well as platforms. 
---
Did you get an email also what console are you on?
---
It seems like it‚Äôs probably a bug for you. I completely it last night, literally just drank a bottle of vodka and killed something with my lever action. Sorry dude :\
---
Where is Simon Cowell? This ain't a talent show without him. Go make a character that looks like him!!
---
It doesn‚Äôt look like that in 3rd person unfortunately but... WAKANDA FOREVER
---
Are you still on?? I‚Äôve been looking!!
---
Sounds delicious. I'll have to farm a ton. Thanks!
---
Use the subreddit feature,*search* to look for your keyword *falling* within the fo76 subreddit. 
---
So it‚Äôs the buttressed mod that adds the ‚Äúhood‚Äù 
---
Well thanks for the response! Maybe relogging will help! Thank you for confirming that it was as easy as that too. ;;
---
Somewhat related, but I sometimes get plans that \*I know\* I learned a long while back. And yet here I am learning them again. Your comment about CW hats has me thinking its time to start documenting the plans I know w/screenshots. 
---
That would be interesting, imagine a hybrid of the 2 ideas:
---
Scorched trapped within power armour suits, Crystals jetting out of the sides while they lay motionless, in pain, on the ground.
---
What's the point of displaying weapons? Most people just lock their fucking doors with level 3 locks anyway!
---
That's happened to me before too. Yet they give me a legendary here for failing it lol 
---
DAMN!
---
I am around level 52 or something and have well over 100 hours in the game and have only been attacked one time. in my experience most of the people are pretty cool and will drop you some stuff if they have extra. Probably just a couple of asshole people who were bored. 
---
Ps4 no email. Will enquire ad to lack of communication but can't complain
---
I duped nothing. Now, I was at the point where I would have duped nuka so I could afford mutations due to the ones that were bugged preventing me from just acquiring them naturally. But I only learned about the easy method after it got patched. I've gotten to a point in my life where I understand what people say when they say you are cheating yourself. I doubt you are the 'kind of person' who gets that though.
---
Dude! I love how this is so much like an actual show! I'm definitely looking forward to Future installments! Excellent work!
---
Oh. Ok lol I should read those inside the vault patches and road map with more thought from now on :D
---
Lol that was my recipe as well. Then I got a mixed drink called a high voltage hefe. Improves energy weapon damage 15% but increases the condition cost by the same for 15 minutes. 
---
Yep!  Friend me and join the server I'm on.  Riomaki.
---
I saw another post yesterday, dude jumped through the ground. But I dont know what became of it
---
/u/Ladydevann just giving you a tag here in case this isn't well known 
---
Exactly my point that you missed. When and where did I say anything about master of all trades, you are getting this conversation confused. Now that YOU have mentioned a master of all trades build, yes you can have flexibility with that type of build, although you wont be doing any one type of damage all that high. 
---
I fucking knew it
---
New server and it worked like a charm for me on Xbox. 
---
Yes was curios others were saying they were unsuspended but me and the fiancee on Xbox just checked still couldn't log on both accounts. 
---
No he never responded. But if your on Xbox and you can trade tomorrow around 4pm est, I‚Äôve got a wide variety of things I could probably give in return
---
They should show the character name.
---
I don't see why we can't upgrade all legendary equipment like we can with the stuff from the Mistress of Mystery.
---
Whoa! Thought I was just suddenly unlucky.
---
It's not in there. It's from data mining and looking through game files :P. 
---
Nuka Cola World is dlc. This is a patch. Very different things.
---
I love that line.
---
Interesting 
---
You don‚Äôt happen to have an item sorting mod installed do you?
---
I'd camp the fissures all day.
---
How do you guys actually kill him? If I shoot once or even get close, he just vanishes... I can't one shot &gt;.&lt;
---
just got mine 
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 as well and this just happened to me after finally deciding I found a good spot to hole up. I changed servers more than a few times and my camp stayed put, but this time I got the same message. It is right on top of a junk pile, which is meant to be camped near, so I‚Äôm leaning towards this being a bug.
---
Hopefully it stored all the pieces and items I had.. I‚Äôm low on resources.
---
Awesome that sounds great. I always wondered how sneak would work since I assume blitz isn't around anymore.
---
Damn! Thanks for the insight then :)
---
some amount hunger and thurst, both. And -25 rads. Pretty handy
---
I'm pst. I can be on later your time tomorrow, or here in a bit. Before I goto bed.
---
Lemme know!
---
Gt SkippyBoJangles
---
Np! 
---
Do you have a specific location for the one below lake eloise 
---
It's both in the game and a neat-o puzzle.  There's a new plan in there, I don't want to spoil it though.  But if it comes down to it, I can post a hint or two if people want.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/Vnmmnjj](https://imgur.com/a/Vnmmnjj)
---
Yeah it DEFINITELY is too low
---
If you have mutations that activate when meleed, then they could be using this as a way to get around this. It will count as if you are retaliating if they are damaged by it.
---
Awesome!! Just added you 
---
Did you get the message that the area was a newly blocked from building area? I got that .. moved my CAMP a few steps awaya nd rebuilt. Loading in just fine. 
---
I guess we are going to have to eat spoiled meat and vegetables from now on...
---
Union merchants, check em out.
---
I played less than 10 minutes tonight because someone decided to attack me. I play pacifist mode because I'm not interested in accidentally harming others or their camps. In spite of ignoring the individuals, they followed me and continued attacking until I logged out. This happens far more often lately and it seems I have no recourse other than ignoring them and either quitting the game or jumping servers, which means no fun for me. 
---
I also noticed a huge performance drop, especially in CAMP going from 60 to around 30, and down to about 45 walking around Flatwoods when it was smooth 60 before.
---
I‚Äôm on an RTX 2080 ... 
---
Check out facebook and join a role playing group. I did and now i play with people all the time!
---
Do you have the grounded mutation? That‚Äôll reduce it by about 50%
---
Btw what kind of stuff do you wanna trade for it? I can probably do a mix of caps and items
---
Ugh sucks they get ya like that. I‚Äôm about level 60 and never had anything like that happen so far. I try to drop extra chems when I see low levels and leave my camp open for others to use. Always wave to people and step in if someone is getting their butt kicked by a mob. I think the vast majority of players are like that. There are occasionally assholes around but it‚Äôs not overly common at least for me so far since beta. If your PC and need some stuff to rebuild or want some extra weapons I can get you some stuff. 
---
You did it again Todd!
---
I logged in after the patch to find over 100 spoiled items of different types, which surprised me as I‚Äôm always selling soon-to-spoil items and had done so the day before the patch dropped.
---
Buildup a workshop at your own risk.
---
The main thing most players don't realize is that you can tag a workshop and attack that player anywhere on the map. This extends to teammates. So one teammate can scout out the workshop owner while the other teammate tags the workshop. The team is then free to attack the workshop owner (and vice versa) wherever they are on the map. 
---
I'll take a look. Plans that I don't know, mats, who know lol
---
Alright
---
I don't know all the names of the armor mods for raider torso, but yea you just need to keep dismantling raider torso to acquire the mod.
---
Ok that's a very interesting idea; get positive mutations in exchange for permanent wanted status.
---
I did that too but after about 7 reloads got the same message again üòû
---
Damn! That looks great! There are so many different facets to it. It‚Äôs funny, when you opened the door to the warehouse build part, the fusion generator sounded like someone was running a vacuum in the next room. 
---
Same issue - on 9600K/GTX 1070 on QHD. Before patch I could do 45 fps on ultra settings, now I can't handle anything. What's going on?
---
very intriguing!
---
could you just tell us where to start, please?
---
Pick up a lot of items that give screws and gears, they will be very useful.
---
Increasing traffic in the Whitesprings area would only further reduce the area‚Äôs playability for lower level players, despite having lower-level quests directing them there.
---
Infinite storage space in player vending machines would defeat the purpose of limited stash storage space.  Perhaps this could be countered by making the player vending machines deposit only for the owner (what you put in, you cannot take out, but others could buy).  Obviously not what you want.
---
where do we/I start?
---
I found that if your building a second story, the wall faces the same way as the wall beneath it. So take out the bottom wall, flip it and try again.
---
I see it also says you can build an invite in your camp. I "bought" it (free) from the Atomic Shop, but can't find it. Any ideas? Didnt show up in Wall Deco for me.
---
Yes. Agility directly affects sneak and ap regen, it's a good stat to invest into early on. VATS is weird at first, but you get used to it and learn to love it. 
---
Just added you - sorry about that, for some reason I didn't realize I had to accept the friend request, because it just says "Friend Added." üòÇ
---
Ok thanks 
---
Yes! I want it tooooo...
---
You can also decline an item by pressing square and can even give a reason why.
---
Wait wait wait .. you got the cant build here msg .. it let you place camp a ways away and rebuild and it says you are in a no build area AGAIN ?
---
Stay on the upper left of the map (near the vault) for a while until you have good gear and armor. 
---
Don't rush it. 
---
If you're on xbone, might tag is "piallator", I can hand you few welcome goodies. 
---
I've been hearing is caused by mods being enabled, so if you are using inventory management mods, shut them off.
---
Not too much really, the explosive effect on the tesla rifle defeats the purpose of the weapon, which is to chain the lightning across a lot of mobs. The explosive aoe doesnt compare to that. I could see it being worth more to a collector of some sort though 
---
No worries! The social/friend‚Äôs tab is sort of confusing. I really appreciate it! 
---
If you‚Äôre ever griefed and are on console, make sure to block the griefer and hop servers to make sure they don‚Äôt just follow you
---
Maybe too little of power? 
---
Did you have duped items? If so are they still in your inventory? 
---
Going to be recording all my play sessions from now on to protect myself tbh
---
That may be it.
---
Also what console are you on?
---
Yes, this just started for me after the patch
---
Yeah. Moved it away, relogged a couple million times to make sure I wasn‚Äôt gonna get the message again, started rebuilding, took a dinner break and came back to that error message AGAIN. 
---
It‚Äôs also taking away my walls and roof pieces each time I get the error message. I‚Äôm down to half the original amount I had. 
---
Hopefully he's there.  He was here, then I slipped off to Flatwoods, and when I came back, he was a pair of legs in the ground.  I can still see the legs and loot them.
---
Yes I going to play on Xbox 
---
I am on Xbox
---
Im PS4 but I really appreciate the offer. Thank you.
---
It just started happening to me
---
First thing I thought would be the air-date and or season &amp; play number for that episode. Doubtful, I know, but I'm a low-effort guy
---
Checking my inventories now. Will let you know. Most of the "dirty" items I had were wiped well before the ban anyway.
---
Anything floating bugs the shit out of me. I‚Äôm glade I don‚Äôt plant a garden anymore I spent to many hours trying to get my garden to look right. I‚Äôm also one of them people that obsess over every item I place. 
---
You can find your first gun right after you leave the vault if you immediately look to your right after exiting. It's on a corpse with some bullets too. Some Chinese liberates are down the hill to test it out on as well. üòâ
---
Thanks 
---
Omg... grahams technically a female!!
---
Can confirm 2 of my PC accounts were unsuspended today.
---
Oh darn well I hope you have better luck going forward. I kind of notice a trend of the assholes being on PS and Xbox more than PC ü§î just my own silent tally seeing these posts. 
---
Scrap your junk every time you see a workbench, saves so much inventory and stash space.
---
He‚Äôs totally here! Got myself a confederate hat plan. :)
---
Perhaps?
---
I think the vaguest hint I could get is check out the strangled plane crash.  That's enough to start pointing you in some directions, I believe there's two clues there.
---
Ok I keep that in mind 
---
Relogging fixed it but shuffled the criteria, I got Rum and buying an item from a Vendor now
---
What should I know this?
---
In a weird way, you hit on exactly why I love this game so much. Been playing Bethesda‚Äôs RPG‚Äôs since Morrowind, and I‚Äôm always much more wrapped up in my head-canon than what‚Äôs going on in-game. In previous games, there was always a trade-off with doing my own thing and having to do story missions/quests. FO76 practically encourages self-indulgence since like you said, we‚Äôve already lost. 
---
Power armor has massive pvp potential
---
I hate that. It's not like people can steal your shit, and if they want to damage your camp they don't need to be inside to do it. All it does is make me sad I can't see your house 
---
Did 2 today and killed the queen both times. On ps4. Worked fine for us
---
Try bigger generators or just use a fusion and be done with it. 
---
Sure let me attack these guys and get 1 shot or better yet not attack them and still get 1 shot. Its a lose/lose situation bub so we tried to ignore them but it didnt work. Think you might have to lay off the jet bub, you're the clueless one here.
---
Give non-PA users a way to fly!
---
Then they should have had a cap in the first place, or made it clear to people they had to "Cut Weight" vs forced destruction, it's not like they couldn't tell us, or that the market has already been damaged by the dupers
---
Really? I would imagine Bethesda would post an announcement about unsuspending folks ü§î
---
Will do
---
My and the fiancee still suspended on Xbox just checked both accounts will be checking periodically, thanks.
---
My junker is still let's call it "extremely overweight". Legit all the junk I had before. Should be fun figuring this one out lol
---
If /u/yongyeah sees this, he's gonna have a field day. 
---
I get that this is one of those un-foreseeable bugs, with such a random sequence of events to produce a negative outcome... but the optics on this look really, really bad when you factor in everything else thats happened. Had this happened to me, I'd have just quit... I mean its pretty unlikely that I would have encountered it, but still.
---
So good on you OP for reporting this, submitting a ticket, and going through the rigamarole. You've got more patience than most of us at this point!
---
(I love this game, but please hire full-time testers to pre-break things for you, like every other game studio in existence.)
---
It can just not right now 
---
Good!
---
At this point I eat more often in this game than I do in real life. It hurts the realism of the game, noone needs to eat/drink that often.
---
No point. Bans come swiftly and they take a month to review if they ever do.
---
I'm no raider but seriously man they're just raiders and they aren't common. It's not "too late" to play this game. Those 100+ players only had 50 levels worth of special points like everyone else at 50 or higher.

Yea but atleast I can irrifutably prove my innocence. Especially now players can directly report in game

Ahhhhh! I knew I saw them there too
---
Bird bones mutation does this slightly. 
---
+1
---
you are second person i have heard this from, it must have been added in the patch , it had been data-mined in the game from the beginning but not available
---
you're splitting hairs and trying to invalidate the core point though that.  
---
Regardless of where it falls the 1,500 cap is artificial, targeting the wrong group.
---
You brew your own, you can't have mine. 
---
Good Lord it never ends 
---
Not like that. Do t know and in or out of map glitch‚Äôs 
---
No glitch since the patch. 
---
We had a short cut jumping the floor via PowerSuit placement before the patch. But nothing game breaking basically skipped the reactor repair middle part. 
---
Found out about it a few days before the patch.
---
But that was fixed in the patch. We were actually impressed how fast it was fixed.  
---
FIRST NUKE. site alpha. sometime in the evening 
---
Last night we did launch a nuke normally but there were some problems....:
---
First thing, up to launching the nuke, the game was running quite well for our team. Better sound and everything. 
---
But then.... started the silo run and when we hit the reactor and repaired it. Nothing happens and we fail. So we try to do it again....... terminal won‚Äôt work for any of our 4. Then it‚Äôs does after waiting 15-20min picking shit up around the area. The progress bar is all over the place, and we almost failed the second attempt because it just would not show the repaired pipes. 
---
Last room was clean everything was working properly. 
---
Only one of us got kicked from server fighting the queen.  
---
So pretty much a regular run. 
---
SECOND NUKE. Site alpha. About 1 pm est +-
---
Today just two of us were on,and started the run.  The Game had a hell of a time with keeping up with us throughout the biometric scanning process. No icons unless I Aimed a gun and my heath bars all other info on the bottom of the screen would then become visible until I stopped aiming.  Same shit repairing reactor the progress bar just isn‚Äôt in sync with the actual repairs being done. 
---
Completed the last roof with no problem. Ther terminal took the nuke card no prob. Then nothin. Wouldn‚Äôt let us type in passcode. When going up to the center terminal a long refresh time was displayed on the top of my screen. 177 hr and whatever min. My team mates was a different number 200hr. 
---
Best part. the guy a ran with today was the guy kicked last night at the queen. He‚Äôs like lvl 200 and literally goes around setting up new low levels. Said he wasn‚Äôt logging back on :( good by brother. 
---
Sorry for the story but figured more info is better 
---
And I know I write like a child. Sorry
---
I didn't realize they always spawn in specific locations and would do the same.  For example, super mutant horde. Options are west tec, wendigo cave, robco, hunters shack. You know they can only spawn at west tec.

I tried to find a new place to throw my blueprinted base down but I got the usual slew of errors, including the new ‚ÄúEntrance to furniture blocked.‚Äù 
---
I spent like 300 caps moving my camp around trying to place it, but because I am a glutton for punishment I ended up back across the street from White Springs Station. I stored my blueprint and built it back up from scratch.  
---
I've built my camp on top of a waterfall (but placed specifically so there's plenty of dry ground either side), and I run into this water issue all the time. There's huge sections of my camp that are entirely unusable in what would otherwise be a perfect location.

I have one leg and one arm, so they're in the game.

Thanks for the help!

Any way to do that and reload it without exiting my current server?

---
You gotta destroy a lot of C.A.M.P. items to generate a worthwhile bounty.
---
The game rewards being good at PvP. Caps and junk. I can understand players not wanting to engage in PvP, and that is fine. But the game also wasn't designed for players to be safe from raiding players. The tension of a potential raid at any moment was an intentional part of the game. Block for session and server hopping are always options. 
---
It‚Äôs frustrating for sure. 
---
I haven‚Äôt really messed around with moving a blueprinted base till today, because it was so god awful broken at launch. 
---
The ones I did have success with, I had to blueprint everything but the foundation, and then build the foundation to snap it to. 
---
You got downvoted voted for this?  Amazing 
---
I punched him and received a note giving information about him. Then he proceeded to attack me without saying anything.
---
If you log out in the excavator armor and the log back in you get an extra 100 pounds of carrying capacity. As soon as you hop out you lose it. It's a bug but it's pretty beneficial so people don't usually bring it up.
---
Where do they spawn? 
---
Been said before, but I'll say it again here.... Second floor of top of the world.
---
I gave it to my level 16 friend in the mire and he woke up at the Tyler fair grounds
---
That destroys your immersion but you‚Äôre fine with people walking around with 25k bottlecaps in their pockets like it‚Äôs nothing? Because in real life it‚Äôs about 200 bottle caps per pound. 
---
Don't be afraid of very high level players. Many are very nice and will give you the shirts off their backs.... literally.
---
There's one way this happens: People expect the game to highlight the item under their mouse but the game will instead choose the item above it. So if you've got your mouse positioned over the item you want to scrap the game will outright ignore that at times and select the one above it.
---
The devs sorely need a way to lock items or prevent them from being scrapped if they're equipped or favorited. It's partially user error, yeah, but it's also bad UI design, too. This was a big issue in ESO as well.
---
Thanks again! I‚Äôll be on for a little bit at least if you want to start a new character to grab another plan or two. Let me know!
---
Submitted, thanks again for the Info!

Glad it worked out!

I have a new thing to want!

(Plus an outfit! üòç)

They may have just 50 levels worth of points but the have grinded for hundreds of hours to get god roll weapons and armor you cant put a level fifty and a level 100 and expect the level fifty to wim
---
There has been a glitch for a while, when you log out IN your Excavator PA, when you log back in, there is a bonus 100 carry weight, when you exit the PA it stays until log out. 
---
Good call, I only did a 30 minute side by side test, but the character without Speed Demon seem to spoil slower.
---
Yes, known issue.
---
When was the last time you launched a nuke? The reason I ask is if its recent then its only affecting those players, if you havent done it for a long time or never then its a bug that may affect everyone.
---
Thank you! Shame my last two rewards aren't useable x\~x since they're mixed drinks and I don't have the base drink component.
---
Thank you everyone! The suggestion of the 50 cal sniper solved my issue! Just made 400 50 cal easy lol 
---
Dang, i guess i will keep on the hunt. And they are 3 * lvl 30 combat uyielding sentinel?
---
Isnt that just a normal stair platform? My house has been cautiously balanced on one of those for months
---
Vault 76 is free travel into the NW area of the map so I keep my camp in the SW and in walking distance to Whitesprings which is everyone‚Äôs second home. 
---
thank you very much It took a lot of time and experimenting to get it all perfect also your so very right about it sounding like a vacuum 
---
Happening to me right now, are we supposed to report this or is it something that time will fix?
---
The sad thing is, a lot of instruments are already in the game as objects. I know I've found banjos, the guitar sword, the war drum, I feel like I have found others. 
---
I was kinda shocked when I did that quest and realized NONE of those items are available in the atom shop... I mean it seems like a money making no-brainer. 
---
My simple, dumb redditor solution: Physically move all the people working on atom shop into the same room as the main dev team. Boom. Synergy. Now one hand can talk to the other, give them ideas, etc. I'd rather pay atoms for that kickass lamp than I would a dumb sweater...
---
Most people have. Random spawn.
---
So it‚Äôs a actually a buff bug and it‚Äôs really only supposed to be 355???
---
Yes, I‚Äôm very aware. When I get into it, I usually hop servers so the weight capacity increases. 
---
I think it has to do with The Overencombored penalty, which is a timed temporary nerf that gets wiped when you leave the server. 
---
This is why I always try to close my session while wearing Excavator PA, as you won‚Äôt get that high carry weight buff if you just put it on. 
---
Up until this most recent patch, there was a super annoying bug with joining a session in Power Armor and when you clocked pip Boy, it would basically freeze. You‚Äôd have to leave the lobby to fix it. So I got very used to not using the Pip Boy for at least 5-6 minutes after spawning I‚Äôm so it wouldn‚Äôt be bugged. 
---
thanks! i'll try to find something)

If there was a code tuesday night then probably tuesday. Otherwise sunday forsure.

Everything about Fallout defies set physics, which is why it shouldn't be a survival game. If it truly wanted to be a survival game, we could only carry a couple of guns and ammo with us. The more weight, the more exhaustion one can experience. Caps would weigh something and and drinking/eating/injecting meds would take up time and show an animation.
---
OMG yes! I thought it was maybe a server thing or something, but since the patch I've been chugging water and dog food like crazy! On a new character, I was going to wait a couple more levels to get the fusion generator, but based on projected purified water consumption, I had to do 'Powering Up Poseidon' it immediately so I could power my large water purifiers.
---
As for food going bad, this has got to be legit, because I found I had food spoiling I didn't even know I had...and that's with rank 1 'Good with Salt.' I've played well over 400 hours. I'm very much aware of what spoils and what doesn't. I always prioritize food that spoils over canned goods that do not.
---
This is a major reason I didn't care for survival in FO4. The constant food/drink consumption is annoying, similar to constant ads while you're trying to watch a video online. At some point, it's not much different then watching a TV show--40 minutes of show, 20 minutes of commercials.

Level 50. Right arm with +1 luck, left leg with +1 strength. The arm was my drop, and the leg was my boyfriend's. Both dropped since patch 6.

i got one today and immediately flipped it for 5k

In the frat house on the second floor and in the room on the very right side. It should be on the nightstand next to the bunk bed.
---
You might have to server hop a couple of times in order to find them, since only one spawns per server.
---
Opps, didn't respond in line. See my reply to self above.
---
I have to drink fresh shrum and then buy something off of a vendor but I've bought like 10 different f****** things and it still hasn't given me the go-ahead.
---
Atom shop things are hidden from trade, it‚Äôs not too far of a stretch to say they just have to make it an option since they clearly can do it.
---
I'm pretty sure its gonna be the underground areas featured in the trailer, a precursor to the high level vault raids, sorta like a demo?
---
A house I pass by a lot has these hanging silver bell decorations that look a lot like those strings of cans set up as alarms. I had to stop myself from ripping one off their porch for thag sweet sweet aluminum

Stop making me consume 25 alcohol for dailies! I am not an alcoholic.
---
I‚Äôm level 26 and have been shot down twice and base leveled one more.
---
 the approach I have now is after it‚Äôs a confirmed griefer, I rapidly power off the Xbox and go do something else for five minutes before I log back in to play. Not worth my ammo or armor repairs. I‚Äôve had about 3 of those, and its nice to mix a drink and not be in a rush. 
---
I‚Äôll definitely try SOME of them out, seeing that it was fixed plus some. If you want some even better performance and higher quality textures, try some of this that doesn‚Äôt cut your textures down to much (to keep the textures higher ofc) then delete your INI files, run 76, put medium preset on then adjust the texture quality‚Äôs to your liking and performance. Keep shadow distance on low, you can modify them a bit or put a reshade over the game to your liking but keeping them on low in your settings specifically helps. Put your FOV to 80 or less, and enjoy. That fixed it for me but thanks for linking me to this, I‚Äôm gonna try this out so I can up my textures seeing it‚Äôs on ultra with water and lighting on medium. Again a reshade would add better lighting and water with little FPS loss. Also for another suggestion which I did is overclocking your GPU. I run an older R9 390 Shappire Nitro 8gb and it comes OCed already but I adjusted until unstable to find my max and upped it by 120MHz and about 1000MHz on my memory (using AMD gpu tweak 2) and upping power input to max. This sealed the deal for me but why not add some more right. Thanks my friend !
---
So it tells you this is a non buildable area but it then lets you place the camp down and the stored items aren't accurate ? I am now dreading turning the game back on. I rebuilt. If I get that message again, I'm not rebuilding. I'm done. If I can't build there, I shouldn't be allowed to place fucking camp. I will lose my shit. 
---
It has to be rum you loot or buy, go to Tannin at whitesprings. Buy the rum, drink it, then buy another drink.
---
Thanks, Reported and added
---
Looks to be the same pattern but darker.
---
Thanks, actually been in IT since 1998, currently a Systems Administrator. ;)
---
Wow. So really max weight would be 355 with excavator PA. . I‚Äôd have to get rid of sooooooo many weapons to play that weight and still have room to scavenge. Yikes! 
---
Just Whitesprings it. Molitov a group of high level ghouls, high tail it for the robot guards. Make sure pacifist mode is on.
---
I‚Äôm optimized for PVE right now. Chamelon and cloaking gear, full stealth perks, healing factor, twisted muscles, talons, speed demon, marsupial, bird bones, goat legs, dense armor, anti armor,  vampiric fist weapon. If I have to do ranged, TSE hunting rifle (or two shot dragon for scorchies).
---
It‚Äôs extremely rare to have any problems going one on one with any single creature or bot, and if I get in a pinch I can literally disappear, fly away, or run INTO explosions and sneak back in for round 2.
---
The only reason I keep power Armor on hand is in case I end up in a nuke zone and need the extra rad protection.
---
I sometimes swoop in to rescue low to mid levels from gutsys and such and I know they think I am cheating somehow because they are barely making a dent with full PA and heavy weapons and suddenly some goofball girl and a swimsuit and sun hat goes all ‚Äúone punch‚Äù on everything, leaps on a nearby roof and disappears.
---
But having said that, this build depends on stealth melee doing boatloads of Damage quickly and doing dodgy hidey stuff to prep for the next opponent or get out of range for a quick heal. If I have a swarm of creatures or a confined space where I can‚Äôt get clear area to get out of damage range, I am pretty much boned.
---
Up to you how you want to build out. You can definitely have an effective counter for almost every type of gear / perk set out there, but maybe don‚Äôt get too much invested in specific builds until adventure and survival gets sorted soon.
---
oh yeah more spread out
---
Yeah I definitely got it sorted lol, and a a lot more then I thought. I have three very good changes I can let you in on if your looking to up performance and textures.
---
How about they actually charge the right amount for moving camps. I move around every week or so and I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve been charged 100 caps more than it says.   Just tonight I moved back to my favorite spot in Morgantown just south of Momma Dolce‚Äôs on a corner lot, it said 40 caps but charged be 160.  To top it off while I was building two events popped up on my camp which I completed then the game crashed and when I reloaded I got the new message about camps not being able to be placed there anymore.
---
Can't tell if this is joke or not :p
---
Plot twist: somebody died there and you stole their junk.
---
Either way, Gratz mate- that's freaking awesome. 
---
I dont usually get any fun random spawns except this one time I saw the one where that rats are following that one robot that's whistling. That was probably my favorite unexpected thing I've seen in the game
---
Also used in making white russians which just fyi suck.....
---
Yea, they don't do anything.  Sooo boring 
---
Yeah that's the conclusion I'm coming to haha. I'll probably get somebody to help me server hop it 
---
Fought and killed about 70+ Queens, The problem lies with lower leveled players joining the fight and buffing her HP, but not adding to the damage pool.
---
Seems to be the case. A few high sales on them listed but seems like a 2-4k item. Thanks for commenting.
---
Shhhhh!
---
It was fun smashing them at least
---
Literally can play it though...
---
It doesn‚Äôt let me place the blueprint as all of my blueprints are ‚Äúfloating‚Äù for no reason when I try to put them down. So I delete blueprint, and items are missing that were definitely in the blueprint. 
---
Problem was it took me I think 7 reloads after rebuilding the camp to get the error message again. For me anyway, seems to be a random occurrence to get the message and have the camp deleted. Im taking a break until this gets addressed, can‚Äôt really play without a camp. 
---
Yes it's fun too. I just think it would be nice to glide out mountains
---
Don‚Äôt build camp near golf clubhouse at Whitesprings. It can cause a consistent nerf of all ghouls if you are at your camp, as WS levels to the geographical players. And whatever you do, don‚Äôt put turrets facing the buildings. 
---
What the other member said about high level players is spot on. This isn‚Äôt GTA, the community is largely friendly and mature. Having said that, if a high level helps you, be sure to say thank you. You won‚Äôt have ‚Äúgifts‚Äù that can equate to them so just common friendly courtesies go a long way. 
---
Fallout 76 is what you make of it. I‚Äôm level 182 and just launched my first nuke yesterday. I enjoyed other aspects of the game before diving into quests and main story line. 
---
Having said that, the weapon rewards you receive from certain quests are also leveled to you. So technically, you will get a better weapon if you wait to do  some better missions and quests until you‚Äôre higher level, like 40, 45, or 50. 
---
50 is highest weapon rank. 
---
Though Bunker Buster comes early, wait to do Mayor for a Day in Watoga until you‚Äôre at least level 45. The reward is a phenomenal melee Weapon that can be ranked as low as 30 and as high as 45 or 50. and you want the highest possible for longevity and value. 
---
Good luck. Enjoy yourself. Ignore the hate and come up with your own opinion. :)

I never had any trouble building elaborate structures exactly the way I wanted for all of the Fallout 4 settlements. I don't know why they had to introduce all kinds of limitations and restrictions that can require so much trial and error to find a workaround. I'm so disappointed with CAMP building.

Confirmed more or less, seeing multiple reports of this.
---
I joined 2 queen fights today, one with my Bloodied HW/PA character, there were probably 6-7 other players there, we downed her in about 15 minutes.
---
The second one was my bloodied stealth vats sniper, super low turnout, it was only like me and one other guy for a couple minutes, we were up to 4 by the end.... did not succeed. Got her down past the first reset, but she still had about 70% health left. 
---
That‚Äôs my first failed Queen in quite a while.
---
Hi I'm Shadow and welcome to Jackass

Thanks, adding the info in
---
once you have it blueprinted there is an option to break down the blueprint into individual items that will show up under stored tab.
---
I saw that killer chess set in the frat house.  I was thinking the same thing
---
I've drank rum from my stash, box I've used rum that I've bought, only other thing I could do is make my own goddamn rum! I've bought from multiple vendors armor, weapons, plans, alcohol, everything and I don't know what the f*** I'm doing wrong here.
---
They could add so much more realism if we got those armored transports running. Even if they just were parked next to us after fast travel and we never got to drive one in game. 
---
Nothing i like more than a lawful use of deadly force on Uncle Sam's dime
---
Probably to do with the online nature of the game. Persevere though! There's still plenty of potential.
---
Asshole! That was my shit and you stole it
---
Sounds like satire. There is already an old meme that essentially says the same thing. 
---
It was a joke... sadly...
---
I learned because I couldn't resist jumping in
---
What is this, the Onion?
---
You must be bugged - though I was worried at first too, after I drank the rum it said buy an item from a vendor - that‚Äôs it- easy peasy
---
It‚Äôs a game reviewer who‚Äôs trying to get attention by shutting on 76 and saying New Vegas is best
---
It perfectly highlights why game journalism is a joke and you should just stop listening to them
---
Did you open a ticket for that?? If not, you definitely should!
---
Having a working fridge/cooler type system in      C.A.M.P would be great
---
Of course you can be injured, the game is intended to be a survival-lite game. But you won‚Äôt take more than slap damage (5hp/sec) unless you engage them in return. 
---
There are some exceptions, though. Currently if you have a workshop, they can use that to fully engage PVP with you anywhere on the map. Also, if you have reactive damage mutations, Wanted players can get you into PVP if your mutation hits them. 
---
Haha I think it is satire, it's describing New Vegas. 
---
Its not in the game yet. It might end up being an atom shop cosmetic but not sure. If youre referring to the one that can be seen on dead bodies like im assuming you are
---
You ran out of power. Place more generators or just use a fusion one. There‚Äôs so much power needed at my base that I have 2. Generators does not provide unlimited power
---
I do the same.
---
My camp is up by McClintock where I have quick access to 2 stations and cheap fast travel to Whitesprings
---
Ok cool
---
Yeah, blackouts do not bring back good memories for me. 
---
You ain't seen nothing yet. :)
---
But thank you, very much. I wish I could tell you guys the true story of this, but, 4th wall, HOA, and all that jazz. 
---
Point is, this is our thing. We want this to work. We want to be YOUR HOA. :)
---
Great PSA, thank you
---
This update no, this roadmap yes. The reason you are getting downvoted is because you are asking about reinstalling, which no one cares if you did uninstall and rather not hear.
---
I‚Äôll have to agree with this. I wasn‚Äôt too low of a level when I did my first SB event, BUT I didn‚Äôt have very good weapons. Now, at 134 I do. And I pull my weight and do a lot of damage to her. Now I‚Äôm certain I have a chance at fully killing her (with the help of others with powerful weapons) 
---
No email, unsuspended, nothing missing from inventory ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèª
---
I tried to fight the sbq tonight, I was there on my own for the first few minutes the one other player joined,, we were briefly joined by a third player but after a few minutes I was on my own again.
---
I got through thousands of rounds of ammunition, and for what? Absolutely bugger all! I‚Äôm level 93 .
---
Im a console couch potatoe now a days for most games, kb+m feels weird to me while on a couch for some reason.
---
I hope we start seeing more official support for the ds4 on PC, than i'd have the best of both without the hassle.
---
And I should care about what other people want to hear? I don‚Äôt care if people don‚Äôt like it. The game is horrible compared to almost any other game except possibly Anthem. That game is on its own collision course. That‚Äôs said I appreciate your straightforward response
---
That's exactly what I was thinking too!! And take all the work out of it. Haha. 
---
I just logged in again and I had 185 spoiled vegetables?? That cant be right.
---
I got a recipe for a beer and the Greek letters plan on today‚Äôs quest 
---
Dude stfu
---
Patch or update? I haven‚Äôt been on for about a month but I heard they released an update a day or two ago. So did they break it again so it required an immediate patch or are you referring to the dlc update?
---
Im glad you asked and apologize for the long reply. Fallout 4 was great but its single player and has a finite amount of quests so the end game is just sort of the end of the game. I logged around 900 hrs. Before that was GTAO mostly, which was sort of my intro to coop/pvp other than racing games. 
---
The thing that GTA made me realize is that there are games out there that you can play for huge amounts of time. Before that I would just play/beat games between 50 to 100 hrs. F76 is the same style and F4 being one of may favorite games next to GTAO left me wishing for more. It has a lot to do with repayable quests, other people being there and most of all the grind.
---
Just get an Elytra
---
So you start a thread, asking the game community that you hate whether or not the game is worth reinstalling...and then almost instantly revert to insulting it after admitting that you haven't played it in months, and forming your own conclusion that it isn't after listening to virtually zero responses about whether it's worth reinstalling. Stunning. Really stunnning. 
---
Who confirmed that?
---
Starting a new character after the patch, my god, everyone on the map is over lv. 50, or some have moved to Survival mode. It's lonely n the Forest.
---
Gonna be a real interesting way to get around in survival mode
---
Found you
---
Wait... the daily quest from BIV didn't disappear from your quest log when you switched server?
---
This most recent update has made some of these issues worse, like items sitting halfway through tables, yet our CAMP items floating well above ground.
---
But they did at least make the door fit better in the doorway! So we have that going for us, which is nice.
---
You probably can but mine crashes after I load into the game
---
I have not beat the queen yet. However, I'm prepared. Syringer with endangerol. Cryolater to freeze her, bloodied rocket launcher and strong melee weapons. Plus I plan on launching the nuke so the fissure prime is in the top left of the launch zone so we can fight her with no radiation (she leaves the nuke zone to fight)
---
my bad, PC
---
I just want to plant on a hill without my corn/etc floating. I cant plant it on concrete, but fuck all if the corner of the patch of grain is touching dirt we are good to go?!
---
Shhh its a habit
---
Any overclocked systems? After reduce the base clock speed of my processor from 5ghz to 4.5ghz I managed to play at least a bit without crash after putting my graphic card to silent mode (means low clock speed). Also, if you overclocked your memory, the creation engine totally hate that. The lower your system is boosted the more stable it get, at least on my Intel nvidia system. Idk about amd radeon.
---
Let's divide and conquer here. I'll take codes 0000-0050. Good luck out there vault dwellers 
---
Won't be on tonight. Sorry. But i'll add you. PM me to coordinate for the weekend.
---
Happy cake day :) 
---
So you ignore everything I just said and threw in your opinion for what? I should care? The vast majority of people dislike the game. Sorry but I can‚Äôt sugar coat it for you honey. The game was a cash grab that had as little effort as possible thrown into it. Even before a content update I had played it when it was literally all the game had. It wasn‚Äôt fun then. Unless this update added a ton of new shit I wouldn‚Äôt suddenly find the same repetitive tasks fun now. 10/10 on your part good sir
---
The robots are nice enough when they‚Äôre not killing me; but I miss Codsworth.
---
Only random one I found is the prize bot. He gave me nothing so I smashed him.
---
If it's just the chest piece you're varying then that 5.5% ballistic reduction is probably close. You'd need to quote both total DRs for an accurate calculation, not just that piece.
---
Sentinel is flat damage reduction, although there are some unknowns: Whether it's applied before or after the damage resistance calculation (before would be stronger), and how it stacks with other pieces of Sentinel or other sources of damage reduction.
---
Lol your so wrong..I‚Äôm lvl 150 and have had lvl 70s have dropped me 
---
Thanks, submitted and added
---
Thank you for the confirmation.
---
Thx
---
Lol
---
Learn where the horde boss is located. After doing those quests a few times, you should remember where the enemy types are located.
---
inb4; I'm Ron BUrgandy
---
Crits bypass everything. If you're an opportunist, have a couple perks, and have a half decent weapon, you can kill almost anyone with a well-timed crit head shot.
---
You can report anyone, main reason report option exist in games it's to make players feel better.
---
Ive tried with overclock and no overclock on my processor, also overclock and no overclock on the GPU, also SLI and no SLI on GPU. Tried all sorts of combinations and no luck. Took second card completely out and nothing, switched cards and nothing.
---
Have deleted and reinstalled on SSD and regular HDD and M.2, still the same problem. 
---
Scanning and repair doesn't have any effect.
---
Ryzen 2700x player here.  I have had the dreaded freeze near Poseidon Energy through the release and all the patches.  Had to jump through hoops and rub a rabbits foot to get it to unfreeze.  Finally the new patch fixed the freeze.  Can finally run around in that area without fear of freezing!
---
Im not wrong im level 246 and its the weapons that people carry that make them strong or weak 
---
Lol no, I wasn't joking. At first I thought they would actually do announcement about this, but in retrospect maybe that wouldn't be the best idea üòÖ
---
Hipster 
---
well you didnt ever say if you did any damage to the 3* , if they killed it you wouldnt have gotten anything
---
I‚Äôll give you a free try to come up with something better than that. This isn‚Äôt the early 2000s
---
Only if we get the outfits to go with it
---
The enemies are mostly unchanged, although scorchbeasts don't get stuck in sonic spam mode anymore and the SB queen is tougher. Two-shot and Explosive got nerfed hard a couple of patches back. Heavy weapons got a substantial buff in the last patch.
---
It felt that way lol
---
Also spawns in the first house ( pi house? ) in the pledge room on the ironing board.
---
I did look around a bit but not in depth, I‚Äôll have to go back!
---
PART of every day.
---
I tested perk cards, and it is modified by gunslinger, so it's a non-automatic pistol. 
---
I had my camp in a spot I loved since launch. What a buzzkill - readjusting all of that stuff is not something I want to do again. It's almost like moving in real life which is the worst. 
---
*boots up Division 2*
---
I‚Äôve been on during every patch before this update if only for roughly 5 minutes to see how it feels. As my posts states my last REAL play session was months ago. But if all of that is the same then more than likely I‚Äôll just sit it out a bit longer. Thanks for the info
---
&gt;What are all the vendors I can hit in one run?
---
Responder, raider, Whitesprings, Enclave bunker, Harper's Ferry, Watoga station, and Phoenix at the Watoga Super Duper mart. 
---
Yep ..just did it to me .. FUCKING DONE. UNACCEPTABLE BETH. I absoultely loath whoever fucked this. 
---
The release dates are list in the pictures released on the road map.
---
Can we get a 4th strike option!?
---
How am I the only person that cares about this? :(
---
Thank you I just brought it 
---
I am here to observe the actual side effect this game will do to your brain 
---
Thank you I just got it 
---
What makes the game so new after the patch? 
---
Submitted and included, thanks for the pics!
---
Be quiet, dammit!
---
April 9th
---
I've been falling through the ground and popping back up when I spawn into a world......not the same issue but similar.
---
Most likely it was a bloodied build they are the meta build that every one runs to one shot. 
---
I can't stand looking at my crops all over the place different heights so I just stopped planting. Plus all the floating crops. 
---
There is no lore for Vault 65 currently. And as you can see in OP's post, there's even a spelling error. Here's a list of known vaults with sources attached: https://fallout.gamepedia.com/List_of_known_Vaults
---
I think your base looks great...but if you want to get the most out of you turrets then you should find a way where all of them can attack at a single target at the same time.  As it stands right now, only 2 or 3 can hit something at a time.  Its tricky but it can be done.
---
No sli, Bethesda will not tested that if they even tryed anything.
---
Oc memory? All drivers up to date? Also, deactivate any overlays and other 3rd party software which could interact in any way with the game. Also shut down all other programs you don't need. I had problems with geforce fps counter in division 2 and hdr aswell, not particular in fallout but who knows. Try to block everything that could force fallout to crash, since Bethesda won't do any quality control we have to deal with that ourself. 
---
I too enjoyed that.
---
Yeah planting needs a lot of work for sure, I hope that they get to it.
---
Lol you're the one who meeds the help, so just add me on psn and message me when you're on ;)
---
I have bought very, very little from the shop.  This, I would buy.
---
Ah, good spot.
---
I blow up your camp. I get a bounty. 
---
You shoot me. 
---
You just initiated PvP...
---
You guys don‚Äôt know when people are joking huh
---
My character has been constantly addicted for about 20 lvls now. üòÅ I just boil water to craft other food.
---
Gl
---
I know floating crops drive me nuts. 
---
When you initiate a claim on an owned workshop, you can engage the workshop owner in PvP anywhere on the map (and vice versa). This PvP engagement extends to teammates as well. One teammate scouts the owner, and the other teammate tags the workbench. And Bada bing! Caps and junk all over your nice ivy league suit.
---
Unfortunately these daily quests have been broken for a while now. Still waiting for the day we can do all theses dailies... Daily. 
---
I did. It's in the game files.
---
Nice story, but getting to level isn‚Äôt completing the game. 
---
The holo tape is for the silo reconstruction. Not the personal launch cool down. Silo reconstuction is per server. Launch cooldown is personal per silo. 
---
Lol it also takes tact so yeah you are wrong
---
Any number of variables, but it‚Äôs likely related to melee / radiation perk card selection, followed by the attributes of the particular sledge, (anti-armor, bloodied, etc), and his chemical use / strength enhancing foods or armor that were in use at the time you received the fatal swing.  Nothing fancy - just his ‚Äúbuild‚Äù... and one that you can also replicate.
---
Ah alrighty, I'll look for some build on it thanks üëç
---
Genius! Guaranteed camp deletion! 
---
You can but it won‚Äôt do anything. It‚Äôs a pvp game and the ability to attack other players is a game mechanic.  Just block them on that session and move on. 
---
Hi level 78 here, r u on xbox?? Me and some buddies of mine love taking out assholesüòà at a certain level people start to get bored and nothing better to do then pick on the little guys
---
Came here to say exactly this. I can down a SB with about 5 .45 rounds through my 1* bloody lever rifle. I always kill them for the odd prime plans. It‚Äôd be cool if they dropped a few screws but guaranteed legendaries feels like a bit much.
---
I want instruments that you can actually play. Like how in Rust you could play the guitar, I want a mechanic like that
---
By "vulnerable" I was referring to possibly becoming wanted for accidentally attacking other players. I was responding to the suggestion that "anyone who turns Pacifist mode on shouldn't be able to attack any Wanted player for 24 hours after turning it off".  That would completely bar anyone who's normally in pacifist mode from collecting a bounty.
---
I couldn't care less if someone destroys my camp, because it costs zero materials to repair by moving your camp.  It's only happened to me a handful of times in over 400 hours of gameplay, and my camp is usually in areas with lots of foot traffic.  
---
If you don't like the idea of pacifist mode making you invulnerable to raiders... well, survival mode will always be an option.
---
Quest is bugged for many after newest patch 
---
Actually, yes.  If it was one or the other, I could deal.  But it's constant and I have to eat an entire freaking herd of radstag and drink three gallons of water just to keep up.  Needs fixing...
---
Wait, it's actually supposed to be a fun part of the game grinding through reddit and trying to work out what the correct answers are?
---
I'm sorry about your dad. I'm glad you enjoyed the game.
---
Was able to replicate once.. seems really touchy
---
I believe rifle gaming just put out a bloodied build not to long ago that‚Äôs pretty op and with the new nuke shine giving 100 percent unarmed damage. Al we are going to see is bloodied deathclaw gauntlets being used to kill you then the nukashine teleporting them away in the middle of battle before you can fight back or seek revenge
---
Thanks, people have been talking about this and i didn't yet it was confirmed.
---
I want to pick them up. Imagine all the plastic!
---
You dog!
---
And the fact that he used the phrase ‚Äúliterally unplayable‚Äù unironically is the icing on the cake 
---
Yeah, I think that needs to change as well. 
---
I‚Äôve been able to do them daily on my alts for a long time. Haven‚Äôt checked since this patch thouhg
---
They could totally implement something like the Robot Workbench to make your own robot companions.
---
Someone else found a protectron with a Mr. Gutsy flame. 
---
Even more in the back room that you have to swim underwater to get to. 
---
Oh... I was so set on upgrading my amor and stuff to level 40 i fogot about the daily. Thanks.
---
If you were a chems trader you could call it Vaulter Vhites :D
---
Radioactive waste produced by hydrogen fusion is extremely short lived(and is in fact used as fuel in the fusion process)
---
Furthermore, the radioactive waste produced(tritium) is a beta-emitter, so it's very weak: It literally cannot penetrate the skin.
---
I was driving home and a shadow passed over my car. My first thought was ‚ÄúOh crap, a scorchbeast‚Äù 
---
Watch the sky its bat country!
---
Yes!
---
Also, more plants especially with all the recipes new and old for variety!
---
Implementing planters would also be fantastic as you could then potentially grow things other than just dirt based plants.  Like cranberry, blood leaf, ect.
---
Let's just go full on awesome and make a hydroponics dlc... 
---
I wouldn't have posted had I not killed it. I wasn't running a video capture, so obviously no proof. Also, had I not killed it, I wouldn't have been given the reward for the event. 
---
This was in an old data mine and it‚Äôs just taking forever :(
---
This!
---
see, this game fucked up your brain so badly you cannot comprehend your own action 
---
damn. thx
---
Now this is insane I appreciate you taking the time to tell me all the variables that go into what it takes to do this, thanks 
---
Can't get online at the moment to try it, but give 450472 a shot. That's the stardate of that particular episode in the series lore. Good luck!
---
I got the same rewards but the third item I got was ‚ÄúHigh Voltage Hefe‚Äù it‚Äôs under aid. It‚Äôs a special beer that; Improves energy weapon damage by 15%, but increases condition cost 15% for 5 mins.
---
Likely a bloodied/low health build, but it‚Äôs not required for those results. Two things to understand- melee gets 75% armor piercing with the Incisor perk, which turns your ~400 armor Excavator suit into 100 armor. And a super sledge, even not a bloodied build, can run into several hundred damage pretty easily. Add in a power attack, and he‚Äôs easily hitting you for 3-400 damage. Against 100 armor, you‚Äôll still take 2-300 damage. And that‚Äôs on the ‚Äúlow effort‚Äù side of things. I can get up to 1000 damage with my bloodied super sledge, even in power armor. 
---
agreed lvl 10 is crap when your max. but your lvl 230 is irrelevant. player maxes out at about 50. anything after that is point swapping and choosing cards.
---
Is this a real thing
---
lol those instant downvotes are amazing 
---
I think this originally popped up after Patch 6, but seems to have gotten worse, added, submitted and credited 
---
Just block them. 
---
I've been getting tokens every morning with my coffee since launch...now i don't know what to do with my life
---
Can people steal from your vending machine? If not this would be great!
---
It‚Äôs true though i dont run away from the fuckin things because i cant take one down, its that i use hundreds of bullets sometimes and I get like nothing back! ive been able to do that takedown shit single handedly with rifleman and tank killer right around lvl 40ish(im sure theres a lvl 1 out there that has died millions of times just to say they killed one with a lvl 1) but like, just yes to this. Add in Lvl 40 scorchbeasts, that are SMALLER and then reconfigure the 50-65‚Äôs and the 80‚Äôs to 1&amp;2 star legendaries, but also make the SBQ levels 100-120 after 10-15 nuke launches per ‚Äòcharacter‚Äô (that lil aspect i‚Äôd just enjoy to scale the combat up, down the line for high level players/servers!)
---
I have been in a blackout loop for over 20 minutes. I'm not sure what happened to my vintage nukashine but this is crazy.  I have loaded into the server several times to a blurry screen for maybe 10 seconds before it blacks out again.  This has happened at least a dozen times so far.  But it's getting worse. The most recent jump is going on 10 minutes by itself.  
---
The shit you say doesn‚Äôt even make sense. You speak random bullshit with no basis. Your brain is fucked up. 
---
There aren‚Äôt any energy-specific perks for damage. Weight reduction (batteries included), and crafting (Science! Perks).
---
But energy weapons still are sub-par because armor piercing effects still don‚Äôt work on energy resistance. 
---
yeah not really sure why they thought getting to a point where you don't gain special points is "completing" it. there are achievements and quests to do beyond that point.
---
Why check our accounts? That's just a common bug alot of ppl had since release. Just relogg till the message is gone and you can play, no reason to freak out and stress other for no reason.
---
OMG CHECK YOUR INVENTORY ALL MY FOOD IS GONE AND TURNED INTO SPOILED STUFF!!!!!!!!
---
Ive been getting tokens every morning with coffee since launch...now i don't know what to do with my life
---
"Rule #1 ‚Äì Cardio, poor fat bastard"
---
You just have to have the correct items and be able to survive the instance to get to launch.  
---
When you can't figure out what all that mystery weight is, check your gunpowder supply... Find the cat house for plastic, maybe a town party in Ash Heap also... Mostly just have fun
---
yes insult bot was a new "random encounter" added to the game  , ran into him yesterday and he didnt do much and was not legendary. i will have the video link soon
---
I block and report anyone who interferes with my gameplay on xb1, doesn't do anything but makes me feel better.
---
dayum i just paid 12k for an AAE laser rifle
---
I logged in on PS4 for the first time since January today. It crashed before I even loaded into the server. I just literally laughed out loud. I went ahead and logged back in and did the Nukashine quest but I exited afterwards. I‚Äôll be back when they put more stuff in the game. 
---
try giving your specs. we don't know what you're running with.
---
That‚Äôs what it is!!! I didn‚Äôt look under aid until someone said something about a drink. Did you read what it does!? No thanks!! Lol
---
There really is no endgame
---
I didn‚Äôt know that. Thanks for the info.
---
No problemo. I also found that on console(at least). 
---
If you try sprinting while in your workshop with an item selected, it will turn invisible and wont be allowed to be placed. It can be fixed by entering and exiting the workshop. 
---
Probably just a conflict with the left stick also toggling craftable items.
---
Thanks I'm about to check out the video and that's crazy +100% extra unarmed dmg for nuka shine
---
Sounds like it's much harder with low player counts then. I did a ton of low player count queens between patch 5 and 6. Not even good builds or weapons, and average kill time was about four minutes. When more players showed up it usually took longer, maybe 10min.
---
I‚Äôd take Top of the World over Whitesprings any day if we‚Äôre talking ease of access for lower players. 
---
This makes me so angry.
---
I haven't seen anything about this bug on this sub. Can you point me to more information about it?
---
Sounds like a perfect job for you. When we actually have a judged contest, you're going to be our Simon. Failure to do so will result in an HOA violation.
---
For me it takes several minutes after turning on to even start playing. I guess it‚Äôs loading? And I have to turn it on every time I go to my camp. Unlike the jukebox which stays on for example so that I can come home to music already playing. Very disappointing 
---
Took the words right out of my mouth bro, this is exactly how I would describe you, but in a more friendly tone perhaps, I care the disabled.
---
Rage and hate? 
---
Ok stop playing video games. That was scary to read all that anger over nothing.
---
I agree with you about mats and bases. I've had my base destroyed a number of times and could care less. Junk flows easy if you know where to look, and the contractor perk helps.
---
I'm excited for survival mode. My point with pacifist mode is that the game wasn't originally intended for people to be able to avoid raiders, mule around thousands of pounds of junk at no risk, hold workshops at no risk, have player interactions with no risk, etc. I understand this vision has changed, largely in part to player feedback. 
---
Roof melons!

Floating corn!

Low level god rolls can sell for around triple their high level versions in some of the trade subs
---
Minecraft has a Fallout mashup pack. You can build anyplace on that map in creative mode.
---
Yea I got pretty unlucky with mine, this is actually a pretty interesting concept. You might get a good drink, maybe not! I‚Äôm going to try and collect as many as I can lol
---
i am pretty sure it was an assassin's chopstick, an unarmed weapon, like knuckles.  must have critical hit you in the eye.
---
It‚Äôs listed under receivers for your weapon, together with other types such as vicious, hardened, hair triggers, automatic, etc, basically it allows you to use ultracite ammo which deals more damage to the scorched, including the queen. To other creatures the ultracite ammo is the same as the hardened receiver (which is also the highest damage you can get). 
---
Ive always felt thats what your teammates camps/roaming friends are for.

Right?!?

How about that game show discount? :)
---
Just did the Mirelurk Horde: Cranberry Bog got a level 25 wooden chameleon chest off a  3* Glowing Mirelurk King. So yeah let me hear your offers people 
---
I can't wait!! Me and my friend don't use turrets to protect our camps. We both use tamed death claws. I can tell you we live in constant fear of some power tripping brats attacking our camps and killing our pets. The rules behind taming makes it hard to find, tame, and keep our pets.  The other day I got my account temporarily restricted because some moron ran into a workshop we took, one shot killed us, AND stole our bags and left. He didn't even want the workshop. It almost made me quit playing altogether. I get that PVP is a game option but don't force it on me AND don't make taking my stuff and caps a reward for such behavior...

your stash full of stuff to sell too?  i am just dying here waiting for player vending.  got about 150 plans and recipes stockpiled.
---
well then go read their own post(s) this is the first of many free dlc, and how was it implemented, dun dun dunnnn, through a patch
---
Darmok and jalad at tanagra! 
---
The code might be the episode and season number!
---
While I agree, it was a chore getting all 24 on the server, it's still a doable thing w/ friends list, but as soon as private servers hit, your HOA is runnin' this!
---
On a side note, you sound very in tune w/ gaming culture. Permission to ask you questions as they arise?
---
This was suppose to be a fun time. A hobby. Instead it's aggravating AF.  People like you don't help either. 
---
yeah, if i server hop, i have to go turn it back on.  :-(
---
You give the Wasteland Estates HOA your attention, we'll keep throwing content into the Wasteland. :)
---
Sadness. I wonder if my blueprints will still work...
---
Serums can not be removed for 1 hour. After that it's fair game
---
Joining!
---
Oh for sure! I‚Äôm going back every day! Lol. I‚Äôve made 4 or 5 vintage nukashines but I haven‚Äôt drank them because I don‚Äôt want to end up on the opposite side of the map!! Lol
---
Yes, serums will be cured with radaway unless you have Starched Genes.
---
Can you also do something about CAMP resource collectors spawning enemies indoors? 
---
I like to build my CAMP directly over nodes to protect them but enemies will spawn in the half inch of space around the collector and destroy it regularly. 
---
Maybe make it a full tile or allow us to make indoor collectors? 
---
Yeah, I feel like Bethesda actually spent time on him. Pretty good character
---
Depends on who you ask, I‚Äôve had friends get their accounts suspended for trading over 150k+ ultracite ammo in 30 days, lots of people wanna act like that can‚Äôt possibly happen but it does and I wouldn‚Äôt risk it if I were you. 
---
There‚Äôs a statement from Bethesda saying they only flag accounts with 500k + ultracite ammo, but sometimes it can be 150k+. So they don‚Äôt even make it clear in their statement really what the cutoff is. All they‚Äôve said is they don‚Äôt believe players can reach these amounts through ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù means, seems like they‚Äôre a little out of touch with their own game imo. 
---
Nah, it‚Äôs a reference to Fallout 3, where Moira Brown‚Äôs rad cure was made of radaway, Milk, and magnets
---
Yeah I‚Äôm ready to dump my stuff into a vending machine and hope some noob decides to buy.
---
bomber jacket probably 500-750, you might get 1k but there‚Äôs not a high chance. hunters long coat 750-1.5k, its harder to sell because of duping and how many people have bought it already 
---
Because in real life bee farming, the hives are "smoked" to put the bees in a docile state for harvesting.

Once you level up the game becomes easy and you can one hit the scorched. Game is only hard because you‚Äôre level 4
---
I thought we crossed the line at murder and cannibalism a long long time ago. Why stop now?!
---
That's crazy hundreds of dmg with just one perk, looks like I got to find a bloodied melee weapon. I appreciate you taking your time to help me out thank you 
---
I didn‚Äôt read all the replies but ‚ÄúAmen‚Äù scorchbeasts are such a waste of time, ammo and stimpacks and you get nothing in return!! Make them worth our time to kill and make some legendary Scorchbeasts that drop 3 tier items only or stimpacks and ammo at least !!! 
---
Thanks üíñ
---
Me being stupid does make the most sense. Sorry boys
---
??? Where‚Äôs the queen?
---
Whatever. You‚Äôre the one whose literally saying your life is terrible.
---
Over a video game that you can stop playing and play a different one.
---
And don‚Äôt say your life isn‚Äôt terrible if your filled with rage and hate. 
---
He spawned at my camp and he didn't say anything except for, "Stop" and, "Come back here!" So I killed him.
---
Theory: the TNT went off, blowing a hole on the ground that a broken water pipe is flowing into. This hole is the entrance to a cave or bunker or metro or whatever was shown in the Wild Appalachia trailer  
---
Yes, he does. I found him and the Lemonade stand at the same place and time this evening.
---
Why didn‚Äôt you wait til you had the video link before you posted lol
---
It was a long read, but I really love all of these ideas.  It's quite ambitious, and unlikely we will see much of it, but you definitely have my support.
---
Thank you. I will try it. Have to get ultracite receiver and rounds. 
---
Could be you occupied the campsite from one of them. If there is an deposite site nearby and you won't set an extractor ppl get mad that your camp is wasting their resources and they want you to leave the server. At least me and my teammates are handling it that way.
---
If you were a while on the server you might had a workshop claimed, that will make other to force you into pvp no matter if you enabled pussymode (aka pacifist) or not. Afik it is only possible with hacks to kill someone without being in a duel quickly, since you only loose 1hp each attack no matter how much dmg they deal, even full bloodied builds or anti armor, melee or anything else should get you killed quickly without engaging the duell.
---
https://xboxclips.com/TANAAS/ce8933ba-78eb-441a-86e2-6ead6d24f718
---
he is killable BTW
---
Exactly. I try to avoid PvP because I am pretty useless at it and my build is around scaving, crafting and PvE. But if I take a workshop I know I am opening myself up for PvP.
---
That's why I have high level friends who carry big guns and will chase you to the ends of the earth if you mess with me. 
---
I can't find Biv listed so I'm guessing none of the usual sources have been updated yet.  [Here is what IMDB has listed as of today](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8495446/fullcredits)
---
Holy sht was that a dear john letter?
---
Check. ;)
---
üòÇ has to be ot was to fast I couldn't even see it 
---
This is old information....
---
WTF then what‚Äôs the point of the serum 
---
Good tip 
---
I've killed it twice.  First time was in the early days and it was glitched, wouldn't do anything but sit there.  Second one was recently and it disappeared when I shot but reappeared and started shooting me.  It kept blipping around so took awhile to kill.
---
cause it takes forever to upload from xbox
---
To give you a mutation...
---
Cool. Thank you.
---
Best xp is still whitespring, just way less now. 
---
i did include a pic so at least wasnt a tease
---
Well you can report them. However nothing‚Äôs going to happen because that is literally part of the games design and idea.
---
Respond to me with the link when it uploads please. 
---
yea he gave me a real zinger the clip is posted now
---
I was mashing on that pic trying to get it to play because the link said Xbox clips lol. What did he say to you?
---
its posted 
---
Cool base! Is the dartboard an atomic shop item or can it be found in game?
---
its posted
---
Added both and submitted, thanks!
---
Build camp by water. You get water purifier eventually.
---
I just picked that up. You want it?
---
What? Just go to the forest and cook about 50 soup..problem solved
---
I put my camp wherever I'm questing allows me to fast travel easily
---
Season five, episode two, aired 1991.
---
050291
---
&gt;have it spoil in a few ~~hours~~  *minutes*
---
FTFY.  New bug has stuff spoiling at an extremely accelerated rate.  But yes, I agree, i was just talking to a buddy about this yesterday, actually.  Gimme a fridge!
---
Yep. All crops are spoiling way too fast. 
---
Where‚Äôs the link? I only see the link for the pic
---
Dude. He burned you bad.
---
What did he drop? üíß 
---
The answer is no. I logged in for the first time since January today and it crashed before loading into the server. I went ahead of jumped back in and did the only new quest they added. There were a number of positive QOL changes like challenge tracking, a stash increase to 800, and a camp budget increase. The camp budget was nearly doubled as far as I could tell. The game is pretty much the same as far as content is concerned. The new quest was pretty good but nothing to write home about. 
---
cool. excuse me while i empty my inventory of everything but canned dog food.
---
a 3 star lvl 50 leather left arm  nocturnal +1 agil reduce falling damage so not terrible i guess
---
Oh cool, I just saw it :)
---
Maybe try 748250? Just a wild guess :)
---
Thanks for the info. As far as stash it is double from what it was for the first month or so after beta
---
Glad to see it's not just me.
---
I'm running an i7 7700k at 4ghz with my 1080ti at 4K and the lag is very real after this update. It never stuttered like this before.
---
And then there are the random crashes to desktop...
---
There weren't any controversies lol
---
What system are you on?  If on PC, I'll tag along and team up with you to help you out.  I'm level 130 something now.  I can help you get some levels and complete some quests so you don't have to feel so timid.
---
Ok, come on.
---
What in the world does that even have to do with the idea?
---
I mean nothing affected me.. at all..playing since day 1 over 400 hours 
---
Your issue is common with pc users that have run mods or edited files. Do a search in the fo76 sub to find the resolution. 
---
I ended up in someone‚Äôs camp
---
Oh because the good with salt perk is broken now?
---
Excavator PA is one of the worst in the game and T-51 is only like 50-70 less protection than X-01 or Ultracite
---
It shouldn't only chems
---
Its clear that the developers intended forcing PvP via CAMP destruction as a fun little *feature*.  See the wrecking ball PERK card. 
---
Bethesda commented commented on reversing that decision by making changes to the pacifist setting. Pacifist may soon mean you cannot be harmed &amp; your CAMP cannot be damaged. 
---
Becoming WANTED to attract bounty hunters was something intended by Bethesda. You need a high bounty to make the trip worth a bounty hunters time. The only way to rack up a worth while bounty is to wreck an entire CAMP.
---
Changes will be made. PvP players will  be segregated. Unwanted PvP is going to be even scarcer than it is now
---
But is it really greifing? Maybe its not about you... Maybe the CAMP wrecking crew is seeking out PvP... By design. As advertised by Bethesda.   
---
PvP players are stuck with you until survival drops. Just like you are stuck with them. Its not fun to be lectured after I smash your base, take your junk, and farm you for caps. Im just playing the game i was sold. I want to be attacking PvP willing players. Its boring attacking people that just log out or get salty. 
---
The point is... Bethesda knows you want a true pacifist mode. They also sold me a PvP survival game. They cant give you true Pacifist mode until after they launch survival mode. Otherwise they would just be removing PvP entirely. 
---
Just give it a month or 2 and its going to change. I dont consider it greifing unless its personal or the attacker is chasing you across servers. 
---
TLDR: Its by design but its getting changed. 
---
Yeah they‚Äôre gone for good. Same thing happened to me too. But they‚Äôre all still on the PS4 itself under the pictures. Just gone from the photo album in the game. Not sure how it works on Xbox. And no there is no way to get them back into the games photo album (at least on consoles).
---
How does one ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù Fallout 76 and where do I learn this power
---
No. 
---
Atomic ship.  It's pretty cheap if I remember correctly.
---
Ppl always team up at whitespring 
---
Yeah I can see that sucking. But I‚Äôve been impressed by watching you melee guys wasting enemies in front of me over in Whitesprings 
---
added
---
Nice lucky u all i ever get is junk cant use.
---
I also got some kind of beer that‚Äôs boosts damage on animals. Drank it while doing leader of the pack 
---
I wish he would fight me back lol
---
I don't think any vendor does. I've gotten it several times from claiming workshops, though. Here's a list of vendor CAMP plans:
---
[http://www.falloutsearch.com/features/Fallout-76-Vendor-Levelled-Lists-for-Plans/](http://www.falloutsearch.com/features/Fallout-76-Vendor-Levelled-Lists-for-Plans/)
---
You can take creatures that will then return to and stay in your camp, and they fixed it to where they don't disappear when you move it.
---
Sounds like he's a little salty himself. üòè
---
I‚Äôve only fought him once in my total of 188 hours played, so you‚Äôll probably fight it someday...
---
It helps.
---
And by helps, I mean that your food will last about 3 minutes longer - so lets say, ten minutes.
---
Sounds like Vault 65 is a bunch of Raiders. What is backstory of Raiders, could they have emerged from a vault?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs been discussed. Salt Perk is broken and the incredibly high thirst thing has been around for a while even before this Patch.
---
Oh damn that‚Äôs a good one! 
---
We need a way to make them land for melee players. I think the flaregun should do that. They could explain it as "The bright lights annoy the scorchbeast's sensitive eyes."
---
Incorrect interpretataion based on what, their harasser's interpretation of what harassment is?  
---
No based on my logic if you log in 28 times over a 30 day period and have 32 unique harassment reports(41 counting the reports from friends-of-reporters who reported you) you deserve whatever punishment might be given.  Doesn't matter that you dont think you did anything wrong.
---
Pretty sure most of these reporting systems only allow one complain per person.  If I report you for harassment 8 times inside of an hour the only report that shows up is the most recent one I sent.  Not sure exactly what the cooldown would be but if the same person has multiple harassment reports against you it's because you harassed them multiple times over several days.
---
\#1 I can't replicate.
---
\#2 is an ongoing issue, I will report it on a C.A.M.P. Page I'll make soon.
---
\#3 Reported by another user and logged 
---
\#4 Solid, replicated it, and also can do it with SuperDuper!
---
Not cho bro guy
---
I would love a travel magazine that let me travel for free for a period of time
---
Time to become a cannibal. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
Ahhh I was wondering if it just wasn‚Äôt sold.
---
Reported by a couple, seems to have cropped in at Patch #6, but got worse with patch #7
---
The kidneys actually would not shut down. How long irl is a 24 hour cycle in game? I think its an hour. The average person drinks between .5 and 1 gallon of liquid per day. People that live in higher elevations such as the mountains of West Virginia tend to drink a little more due to elevation. Tack on the elevation of Appalachia, the liquids we are drinking have diseases and are irradiated even if boiled to get rid of disease. So this probably adds in to us needing more fluids. We run around with anywhere between 100 pounds and 300 pounds without being overburdened. That would add to how much we need to drink and eat. There are plenty of other factors such as running, humidity in areas, higher heat in others. So yes in a 24 hour game cycle having to eat like 3 to 7 meals a day and drinking 2 to 4 gallons to stay hydrated is plausible. 
---
I know I used to drink between 1.5 and 2.5 gallons of water a day when I lived in Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. All of those areas were fairly dry, only Phoenix was extremely hot, so heat wasn't a factor unless I was running, hiking, climbing or fishing on my boat with the sun reflecting off of lake navajo. I live in Illinois and I still drink close to a gallon of water, soda, coffee a day. 2 cups of coffee, 1 soda about 24 ounces and the rest is water. 
---
I pray the Legendary re-level benefits are perk card related to make swapping for QOL perks go away. 
---
Flatwoods monster should drop alien-related loot, and mothman should drop cultist's stuff.
---
HELL NO!
---
Seen several reports of this.  
---
Question:  
---
Did you have a camp built using one of the "Floating" tricks?  
---
A specific mutation
---
Some combination of relogging and joining the same server and taking off the party girl perk did the trick for me.
---
Good idea! Will consider this.
---
Ohkay
---
Haven't tried it but maybe trade lots of mats to the new alt and after getting well rested, full of cranberry something, and in a group with Inspiration or w/e that charisma card is just start crafting like mad. Ask people for all they're glowing meat after WS runs. Maybe do it at a workshop to get the Defend missions and have your buddies jump any pvp'er who wants to slow production. There might be other +XP opportunities I'm forgetting but you got the idea.  
---
No waiting on spawns or having to stop and repair stuff. No dealing with the annoying respawn bugs. Just on your phone or something, tapping a button till you hit 50 and can enjoy the game. Put on homebody and you don't even have to eat or drink hardly. 
---
You have to use Starched Genes for the rest of forever. 
---
When I found him he said something about being off duty and told me to have a nice day, I was like "what a ripoff" 
---
That is weird, never saw it before patch 7?
---
I've scrapped 20 guns today and haven't learned a single mod.
---
I wish fast traveling was free unless you were in pvp mode or wanted
---
Randomly, yes, but from all reports it's happening immediately.
---
When testing today  I found (4) and all of them instantly blew up.
---
Great info, this confirms what I've heard from a few friends
---
Love this idea! Make it require some decent materials to craft, too. Conan did it decently well with their Preservation Box, something similar I feel would work great for this game.
---
The trend I realize is that people who build their camps near train stations always lock their doors, those in less traffic areas usually don't lock their doors..
---
With Cannibal I never get hungry. With water purifier I have plenty of water. 
---
Just had someone do this to me again, minding my own business afk in my base and some asshole comes in and starts wrecking my stuff. I moved all the way out in the Mire, just leave me TF alone.
---
I guess? I had concrete foundation 1x3 stairwell as my first floor and then the second floor was a larger area. But I don‚Äôt even know if I can scrap my previous build and start over to get that budget back?
---
Rad worms were big in the 80's
---
Woah there.  He's just trying to deduce how you got killed so easy.  Yes you were a victim, yes they were dicks, but now so are you
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a nice change. I think for now they are just stabilizing the platform and trying to lay a solid foundation to place new content onto. It will be winter before they add anything substantial. 
---
Yeah he‚Äôs saying that since most of the playerbase has quit, you can essentially log on and play by yourself sometimes as if it‚Äôs single player. He‚Äôs not lying. One time I was in a server all by myself. It was awesome I activated all the fusion core generators because I knew no one would be there to take them. At this point I could care less if anyone else plays since I haven‚Äôt heard anyone speak in months and when people were still around the kept having my camp attacked. Plus who wants someone coming along and looting every ate before you get there.
---
You're thinking of Chemist. Super Duper works on petty much everything but only has a 30% chance. I use it when I make ammo and weapons and food all the time.
---
Good emergency thirst source
---
Yeah, well..you know...that's just, like, your opinion, man.
---
I just got my achievement earlier. It was my 58th terminal hacked.
---
LOLOL edit
---
The smaller razorgrain is slightly better about staying earthbound than the large patch...
---
But yeah my space garden gets me sometimes lol 
---
I've only gone after someone's camp once and it was because they were xp/legendary farming the Whitesprings Golf Course, we kept at it until they left the server. I like the idea of a PvE server but I know it would devolve into people doing stuff like that
---
Ha, I always wonder if others find niche parts of a game fun, too. Robot workshop was really fun.
---
That's great, really.  But it doesn't solve the bug that multiple people have pointed out is there.
---
I did, and just got around to reading the patch notes. Thanks I'll try moving it a little and see what happens.
---
\*nod\*  
---
Not new to Patch 7, and I have them on last Months Armor Roundup, will drop another set this week.
---
I'm so lazy I buy ammo on market subs here
---
Plus they literally just added a new vault that appears to be quest related rather than a raid.
---
This game is built for people like that. In two or three years people like us might be able to play it, but for now just go play something else. 
---

Could you outline the Mods you have on the Rifle so I can try and Replicate?

Since I'm always overencumbered, this might be the fast travel I can afford

You asked for it.

They will sometimes do that, the Protectrons however appear to all be blowing up instantly.
---
Yup, just got attacked by Tacocatracecar.  He/she/it showed up in a beehive hairdo and dress, talking in falsetto voice, asking how I was doing, then started destroying my CAMP.   Immediately logged to Main Menu, blocked him, AND reported him for harassment.  I suggest everyone getting harassed by him do the same now we can report people.  :)
---
It happened to me the first time.  Reloaded. problem solved
---
How was it gotten for free?  
---
Discount?  
---
Tried in and out of Power Armor&gt;?
---
Try the power substation just north of Watoga, there's always 3 or 4 ants but you have to be quick as they are usually fighting a deathclaw and won't last.
---
The antique place near watoga.

A couple spawn in the parking lot.

How do I get a backpack? Have they been released yet?
---
hey that's a grea...
---
*corpse immediately vanishes*
---
well, poop.
---
Were you in pacifist mode? This could have been why you weren't able to target them.
---
This made me laugh harder than it should have. 
---
\*nod\* Strange is Numbers is still erratic as hell.  
---
The Watoga Bots (especially Legendary ones) could always explode, but the Legendary Protectrons seem to always explode now, nearly instantly..
---
Whoa I have an inside joke with a dev now!
---
Spot on!
---
I get that. I used to mock the NPC's in Fallout - their silly speeches, etc..., but they really added some depth to the storylines. It's fun to say "hi" to a human player going by in 76, but the NPC's conversation would help layer an unfolding mystery as the story was being laid out.
---
I was surprised to miss them, too.
---
Tbf apart from the latest update, the past few have only been around 3gb.
---
Nah, not yet.  I think they just meant the stuff on their person.
---
The tricentennial edition has a hat on it like uncle sam,(i have it so i can see the differences) so they are different. Anyone buy it yet and find out?
---
Compare the Fallout76.ini found in the X:\\Program Files (x86)\\[Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) Launcher\\games\\Fallout76 (X=Installed Drive) with your Fallout76Custom.ini  
---
Copy over the BA2's section and add your mods to the end of the list.
---
The behavior is rewarded because its by design. That "behavior" is the PvP survival side of the game working as intended. 
---
Im sure those players were just farming players for caps and junk. Its a PvP workshop after all. I never claim them either. Just kill the owner until it doesnt let me anymore then move on.
---
I only claim the one next to my CAMP because i want people to PvP @ my camp. 
---
This would actually be really cool and totally fitting for post-apocalyptia.
---
&gt; ...in my pack,...
---
Yeah it was added with the dlc it's an ingredient in one of the unknown recipes from the brewing table too.
---
\*nod\*   
---
Logged above, really hope it's not because we asked for the same function in player trading ;)
---
Are you on PC?  
---
This is happening if you have "Better Inventory" as it's not compatible with Patch 7 (as of last night)
---
Nope, nothing like that at all!
---
I like it. To be released April 20th 2020 
---
Few reports of Power Connector issues this patch, not gotten to test yet.
---
Confirmed, great info.
---
Nice! Why didn‚Äôt they put that in the notes, it‚Äôs a good thing to know about. Well, I guess it‚Äôs gonna be simple enough to figure out. Lol
---
Lmao that last bit was pretty funny. Good to know; if the were catchable by my face I am definitely the one that would.
---
No, I‚Äôm on console. PS4. I cannot install any mods.
---
Gotta fight outside the radiation. When you nuke place the circle south of Drop site V9. Without my PA on we would have won

I am drinking water as much as I reload my gun, which is saying something. Lucky I usually carry about 50 purified water around. Using so much food and water, makes the Rejuvenated Perk almost useless, it is just not worth it to keep well fed and well hydrated for such a short time benefit.
---
Plus after a fast travel had razorgrain and corn disappear out of my inventory, and no spoiled food in inventory, which was strange.
---
Do they balance this while having all the maxed out perk cards for food and water equipped?
---
Is it the main new patch for brewing, or a hotfix?  Because if it's a hotfix, I want to shut the game down and install it to see if it fixes some of the bugs I've been enountering...
---
Be sure to report him now we have the tool!  :)
---
This is the first time they have had to deal with the "elitist" online group and their constant bitching and moaning, so they deserve to hear from those of us who have been fans of theirs for over a decade that they are actually doing a good job despite what the angry teenagers say.
---
I'd love to be able to stock my Nuka fridge with some ice cold Nuka Cola. 
---
Don't forget to use the new Report tool in game too!
---
Yeah it‚Äôs way longer now. Plus every time I load in I watch someone else‚Äôs base disappear piece by piece in front of me then I watch my base start to form piece by piece in its place. Then the water slowly loads (I built on a lake)
---
I couldn't find it either. I know I've seen the poster in the wild on the new tattoo parlor location, and I'm sue there are other places it spawns. 
---
No I just seen where it was unlocked. 
---
Exactly. I was being facetious.
---
We used to get 3 hits per click/crit with autoweapons back in FO4, so it seemed like this was their way to 'translate' that feature to new VATS. Bit harsh to call it a exploit tho, guess they expected us to not hold down the fire button with a automatic weapon?
---
Thanks for correcting me!
---
You mean you don‚Äôt drink 6 bottles of water every 20 mins in real life? 
---
I just found on the vendor SE of the Sylvan Logging Camp. He is right outside the tent area, you can see the balloons.
---
No
---
I mean, there is a bit of a story in terms of what the people around the speakeasy were dealing with, and the actual inventor of Nukashine being really shady with ties to General Atomics. Not the most complex quest ever, but it has its moments. 
---
I just found on the vendor SE of the Sylvie &amp; Sons Logging Camp. He is right outside the tent area, you can see the balloons.
---
Not sure if his pattern is locked down or not yet.
---
I thought you were saying the opposite so sorry for the redundancy.
---
Well they didn‚Äôt add any new trophies having to do with this nukashine quest so I would say no to the other new stuff as well
---
Are you talking about the DLC that dropped yesterday?
---
When the game was first announced, they said we'd get mods and private servers "likely" a year after release. So, probably, but definitely not anytime soon.
---
Maybe at some point, but we haven't heard anything yet.
---
No offense, but theres the same post on here every 20 mins. You gotta delete all mods and fix your ini file, its a problem with the new update and mods thats making you fall through the floor! Some have also put the proper ini file 
---
Very clever. Only not really... 
---
Ive had it with friends in other servers. 
---
"Did they give up when the Russians invaded Anchorage?!"
---
"But that's not what--"
---
"Don't worry, he's on a roll."
---
You should follow the official Bethesda accounts. They‚Äôve talked about this happening.

Ask a level 200 to bring you to WesTek Research to level up. It's a thing now..

Added and submitted

I think it‚Äôs glitched if you get it from the atom store
---
How did you get it to go away? 
---
I'm on PC, thanks tho, usually keep around 300 steel unless I'm making 5mm for my Gatling guns. Then I run around hunting anything that carries a weapon so I can scrap them and after the update I don't have to do as much of that.
---
I love them. I think they were trying to do improv
---
What OP mentions isnt a reportable offense. What you are suggesting is. This is harrassment.
---
Targeting a specific player, chasing them into a server is the bad part. Youre allowed to attack people... You cant target them. Its in the terms. 
---
The irony ia that they are PvPers. People like me. We are happy to fight you and your friends. They would *enjoy* it. Thats why they play. They wouldnt report you or even realize you had an agenda.
---
Are you on PC? I do "bad" stuff all the time. Wanna fight me and my gang instead? I can kill some innocent campers and break their stuff first to prove im legit!  
---
I have 1 selling it for 1750c message if interested 
---
Shhhhhhhh
---
Lol :) I like your thinking but I would rather be a bit nice even if most of the people who try to trade with me aren‚Äôt :) and I‚Äôm 100% supporting the call for a middle finger emote, I really need one when they try to kill me and my friends because we WONT accept a trade request ! 
---
It's a 10% increase, that's phenomenal. What, did you think they would buff them to the point of being so OP that they broke the game?
---
Placing items in the fermenter still takes space in your normal stash, I feel lile if implemented they should allow a new collective storage amount seperate from camp stash for items like the fermenter and a fridge or other items like that for the camp. 
---
I was so disappointed to learn that the craftable cooler wasn't actually a...you know, cooler. It was just a stash. :( 
---
Finally got around to trying a 1* two-shot ultracite laser with splitter. I stuck with the reflex sight and didn't bother with VATS for this one (I have other non-two-shot lasers that I'll try with VATS). If I can get fairly close, this thing can beat up level 68 Super Mutants. Definitely much better than before.
---
Still breaks pretty easily from 200% but I think I should expect that with a two-shot splitter.
---
Your explosive laser must be wrecking things.
---
Who the hell cooks food? Guys here's a little hint Don't, by all means collect every type of meat and plants / veggies. Let all that food SPOIL, add in the perk Iron Stomach rank 3, and eating spoiled food you'll have a 0.05% chance of getting a disease. That's right you'll never go hungry and never get diseased from eating spoiled food. While you do get some rads in can be combated via chems and/ or perks. Get the weight reduction perk for food and drink in the Agility tree and you're all set. While I don't eat canned dog food I still collect it because aside from caps it a good barging item.
---
I can't milk Brahmin cause my Plague Walker mutation aggros the Brahmin even if I don't have any diseases :(
---
Thanks, I'll try that. I did scan down the page before posting , but didn't notice any posts about it. 
---
I hope there solo equivalents...
---
1. Diseases can be renewed, which can skew the timer, especially true for example of "Glowing Pustuls" when fighting Ghouls.  The 2 minute discrepancy could have been server lag.  I'll try to replicate.
---
2.  I tested in game and got a 200% repaired Handmade.  Are you using any mods (seriously), wondering if it's related to a UI update and PLM isn't working right.
---
For real though. I received a two shot pipe rifle last night. Not even TSE, just TS. Like thanks rng Gods
---
Yeah. That's my favorite. I ran into a handy being attacked by mongrels so o shot them. When the handy passed by he was whistling for them. He was axtually walking them. Next time I had seen them I left the dogs alone but when they got closer, they attacked me. The rats don't do that. 
---
Damn. And that's not even fully repaired. 
---
Trick I always do with meat. I'm usually farming when on, so I end up with a lot of glowing meat. When the current batch gets low condition. I drop it, cook a new one, look at it in the inventory and it should be 100% (I dunno why you have to do this, but it just works xD). Pick up the dropped meat, they'll all be 100%.
---
I get why you're being downvoted.  But it's wrong that you are.  I *hate* PVP.  I'm not good enough at the game to be able to survive in PVP.  I would like to never be forced into it...
---
BUT you *are right.*  It is partly a PVP game.  You are doing what you are allowed, by the rules of the game, to do!  It isn't griefing.  Pacifist players who take a worshop and ignore that little notification that other players may attack them, ignore it at their own risk- that's why they're able to be attacked in pacifist mode.  You're playing the game in a way that was absolutely intended, but poorly implemented, and people need to realise that.
---
BUT....IT'S.....Alright.
---
They already receive buffs from rifleman/gunslinger/commando/guerilla depending on what you have them kidded into. 
---
They shouldn't make anything brokenly over powered. I personally think they should make some legendary effects exclusive, such as two shot and explosive, or explosive on shotguns.
---
With starched genes you don't lose it. Mutants basically have to use min 5 in luck. 2* starched genes, 3* class freak.
---
NP, I replicated it, once... seems very touchy timing wise!
---
I haven't seen this one mentioned yet. Sorry if I missed it. On xbox one Taking a shot With a hunting rifle, which leads to the bolt action/reload animation causes sights to be stuck in hipfire mode after bolt is pulled. sometimes takes multiple press/squeeze of the aiming button/trigger to get back into sighted mode. 
---
Something like 17 GB.  It‚Äôs going to take more than an hour and a half to download, so I‚Äôm putting the PS4 on rest mode and giving up.  Seems like 25% of the times I attempt to play this game, another huge download derails my plans. Most other games you can play without the fancy new patch but not this one.
---
Im not 100% it has gone away, might just be because they're all off line. 
---
Its Todds fault! He set me up and now you all hate me! üò≠üò≠
---
Easiest way to get downvoted on gaming subs on reddit is to call Fallout 76 an MMO. Even though I agree, I just keep it to myself now 
---
Question(s):  
---
\-What Guns?  
---
\-Do you already have a good number of mods unlocked for those weapons?  
---
As you unlocked new mods, it gets increasingly difficult generally speaking, and a few weapons are super hard.
---
I made a comment in another thread, get the rank 3 iron stomach perk, let all food Spoil, you do get some rads however at 0.05% chance of getting a disease, which I never have, you save worrying about food altogether.
---
Someone put together a great guide!

There are so many of us... a few hours here, a few hours there... before the next actual life event.
---
What is your platform?
---
Combat Shotgun, Pump Action Shotgun, Assault Rifle.
---
I have a few for the Combat and Assault Rifle. I'd say less than half of the available ones. Much less for the pump.
---
Seeing allot of reports about this, and it all seems linked to the "Floating" Camps.  
---
They kind of mentioned it in the Patch notes, but didn't detail it would be this Draconian..
---
Yeah even that dog in the game. I didn't have a disease but hear the sound and he jumped off the cliff =\\
---
it's showing up in game now as an option with the, "click to buy" button, but when you click it, you get an error.
---
As long as you're careful you don't need Starched Genes. I rarely equip Starched Genes and have 12 mutations. There are several ways to remove rads without Rad-Away or diluted. 
---
If you are up for it I would love if you could paint my armour
---
If you force your camp to be stored, you'll be able to rebuild it that way.
---
For a while I did hate pvp'ers as a group, because I got griefed something awful, but time and perspective helped me get my head out of my ass.  It's a wasteland.  All the "legit" raiders are dead.  Somebody has to be bad and brave enough to fill in the gap!  So go you, raid away.  üëç
---
Yes 100% add a player market to sell/buy items 24/7! Id list tons of items on that marketplace if it existed.
---
Thanks, will try to replicate it.
---
The one thing I would love for 76 to copy from RS is the trading system. Item for item, confirmation screen, and all that. It would be perfect for 76
---
Thanks, will use one of my alts and try to replicate, see if they messed with the Curve tables.
---
I will have to do some experimenting.
---
No but you don‚Äôt get it. I REALLY want it
---
How did you get 433 damage, on an automatic receiver no less?  My best weapon, a tse action lever, I can get to 433.  But that's after Adrenaline buff.  I'm using Adrenal Reaction.  How do you get the damage that high?  Do you have a ton of buff?  
---
Seriously, I don't know what I'm doing so different.  
---
What's the difference in joining your friends sever to play with vs joining another person's sever because they did u wrong back when u were fresh meat?? Higher up player need to be put in their place just as much as anyone else. Just because yall get bored and want to ruin other peoples experience that dont do pvp just makes you a asshole period 
---
Happened to me too. You can break down the blueprint for storage though, find a new place to build and test it out.
---
Yeah man my camp budget was full last night and when I played today before work it was only slightly over half full. I can fit so much more stuff that I‚Äôve had to sacrifice
---
Where is that poster? I cant find it
---
Not mentioned and don't worry if it was, this post is a massive wall of text!    
---
Question(s):   
---
\-Mind giving me the Mods on your rifle (names I mean) so I can try and replicate?  
---
\-Were you in VATS when the reload triggered?
---
I'm glad the LMG went from probably one of the worst weapons in the game barring the drill/flamer to extremely good even without legendary effects. It's still an ammo whore but at least you don't feel bad using ammo now because you actually get results.
---
Food has benefits like +str or +agil or +carry
---
I've gotten it post patch.  It's pretty sweet. Similar to Initiate paint just darker. 
---
These downvotes are real stupid lmao. This is not a negative post
---
man I've  been waiting for s relaxing aspect to the game and I think brewing has given me a little hope. Fishing would be so much fun as right now I'm gonna roleplay as a crazy moonshiner and just make, well, alcohol. It would be a great thing to sell in game and everything is simply farmable.
---
Yeah my food is definitely spoiling MUCH faster. I lost more food stuffs in a 3 hour session tonight than I have in previous marathon sessions on weekends.
---
What platform are you on? I have a bunch of plans I already know that I am happy to give away.
---
**My tips**
---
Take your time and dont rush the game - there are so many hidden things in this game - lots of unmarked locations, and random events if you walk between locations (rather than fast travel).
---
Purified water can be a gold mine early in the game, when sold to vendors. Vendors reset every 20 hrs, and each main faction have 200 caps per 20 hrs. 
---
* [Vendor Map](http://dulfy.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fallout-76-vendor-map-3.jpg)
---
Take over workshops - even if you have no plan to keep them. Each time you take one over you have a chance to be be awarded a plan. Do this often and you will quickly find yourself having a lot of building options in game
---
* [What does that plan unlock](https://imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl) 
---
Above all just have fun!
---
I didn't think you could get them. Try checking the shops.
---
Horde events are the worst. 
---
Loving it. Have a nice distiling club on the top of my shack now
---
It was one of the free items they started with, supposedly it's one free item each week. 
---
Last week was the nixie alarm clock, the week before was DB Tech Varsity Jacket and the first free item was looking to the future pose. It don't work at all, it's just gone from photomode. 
---
I've had this happen quite a bit on PS4. It seems to be when someone is talking when you log off. I had four "voices" all from other servers build up the other day.
---
They don't seem to clear out until you completely close and restart the game either.
---
I reported it, so we'll see.
---
So much space for activities!
---
I‚Äôll try to on the next one.
---
Desk fans are your friend!
---
[T60 Knight Paint ](https://imgur.com/J0EHFVH) 
---
Yeah i'm starting to wonder the same... and i check all thevendors more frequently than daily since i'm looking for t-51 mods too. Thank GOD for Travelling Agent.
---
If the game is continuously downloading patches might want to look at your console.
---
I'm not sure who is voicing him but it sounds a lot like John DiMaggio (Bender's VA), which I figure is very intentional. 
---
I‚Äôll honestly be happy if I‚Äôm a future update they do more with them. 
---
Teammate got a nuke silo full of lvl 5 scorched yesterday.
---
Maybe the enemy's thought it would be funny to swap homes for a day?
---
I liked the way the hillbilly robot used to introduce the lucky mucker. Now there's a lot less innuendo, I don't like it! I always used to laugh, now it's just a weird robot.
---
This tip should be like on the cover of the game box instead of the fallout logo lol. No lower level players know this and neither did I until someone showed me this. So much wasted time 
---
Time to get my shotgun out of my stash and start ignoring trade requests again. Well at least until this stops I‚Äôve had four blow up instantly was definitely a surprise the first time.
---
I can't think of any online games that let you play without up-to-date patches. And since the DLC dropped yesterday, I'm not sure what you're really complaining about. The last "patch" was weeks ago. 
---
They are fixing it can you not be patient 
---
How much in caps
---
Almost got her if this was the same group I was in
---
Yes, pumpkin grenading fish sounds good.
---
I tend to get them from super mutants in fact most explosive plans I‚Äôve gotten from the jolly green bois 
---
Follow anyone higher than you, get 1 hit on the mob their killing, reap the reward. It's cheesy way of levelling however once you attain a few levels just go and discover sites, earn Xp that way, if mobs come at you run away lol. Once you're at a level you're comfortable with go back to the main story, get a few levels, then go and sight see again. Think of the game as a game of hide and seek your hiding and the mobs are seeking you to eat you lol. Turn the game into something fun, example, the scorched are attacking you and you see a bunch of supermutants run over to them, aggro them, run away in a different direction and hope the two groups battle it out. I do this all the time, because it's fun.
---
You‚Äôre welcome. Also from what I can tell it happens on PC without mods as well. Earlier today I was watching a YouTuber who plays unmodded on PC having the same issue. Check Captainoob‚Äôs latest video for proof.
---
I already tried restarting, sadly it did nothing. Keep me in the loop about what happens with the report if you can
---
Lol yup. Got a full band set up and a garden to grow my ingredients for alcohol! Plus, my CAMP is on a little pond that always spawns Brahmin, so now I can milk them and have a steady supply of milk
---
I have 400lbs of plans. I wish I knew how much you could load into the machine lol.
---
I believe that's exactly what I said ;)
---
I've seen him on stage several times (I can't recommend Outtake-o-Rama highly enough) and of course numerous VA roles. It's GOT to be the original drunken party robot!
---
This is the one and only reason I play the game. Guess I'll take a few days off. When I get back if not fixed. You might get lucky and find a bag in the ws station. Yay for you! 
---
They seem to drop plenty of grenades themselves but can't remember getting any plans except maybe the MIRV, will start focusing west-tek more then, thanks!
---
It survived at least one log-out and log-in. We'll see!
---
If you're PS4 I can sell you the nuka quantum grenade plan
---
You sound like an insufferable child. 
---
I do like the buffs. But I aim for 1 hr foods with good buffs that I can farm easily. I have +3 in most attributes and good boosts to damage, carry weight, resistances, HPs, AP and AP refresh. (It can be a lot to manage sometimes. I have my small backyard farm but I travel to Flatwoods for silt beans and Ribeyes. 
---
&gt;Yeah I can see that sucking. But I‚Äôve been impressed by watching you melee guys wasting enemies in front of me over in Whitesprings 
---
If they're one shotting the ghouls, they're assholes, plain and simple. Ending gets XP and loot as long as you tag a mob, so why be a dick about it?
---
When other people are around I switch to my Mr handy blade and just run around crippling the ghouls. 
---
This would piss me off. 
---
Im just saying this is the dumbest thing you can do they wantes to put a small cool down timer to stop people from nuking the dlc zone but made it to long and i dont think nuke launching should be the one and only reason you play the game its gonna be less rewarding untill more contents out 
---
I meant all games, not specifically online games. So like Fallout 3, NV, 4, Skyrim, etc.  I play maybe one evening per two or three weeks. Just don‚Äôt have enough time for this game - it‚Äôs not really suitable for throwing on for half an hour or 45 minutes so I only get a chance when I have a bigger block of time.
---
Oooh my bloodied LMG is finally going to see some action 
---
Nope, only mutation active is the adrenal reaction
---
I know that in prep for future DLC quests events, the amount of no build areas have increased. So maybe your in 1 of those when you weren't previously
---
You got me
---
Because your exact statement is breaking with maturity üòÇ
---
UGH I WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS...well for now, I'll stand for it....but MAYBE IN A FEW DAYS I WON'T STAND FOR IT
---
8k caps?
---
Would be good if you could pacify him and have him in your camp.
---
Sounds like the typical bar-tending course ...
---
Not only that but there‚Äôs also a mouth harp you can play now 
---
Maybe people just didn't find it funny. Because it isn't. Shocking, huh? 
---
Sure ign is promitheusaudio.
---
I got a bottle of tick tequila and no recipe :(
---
lol breathing underwater wtf 
---
The "logic" of some of the legendaries is hilarious. 
---
Fix-it-Good repairs Armour to 200%
---
Weapon Artisan is what you need to repair weapons to 200%... And it is working fine.
---
Aah bugger sadly i'm on PC :(. I'm desperate to a point where i could give like 3-4k for each (for me at least that's a lot). Thanks though.
---
How about a player in pacifist takes no damage, cant have their structures damaged, but can't contest an owned workshop.  Still free to cap an unowned one without leaving pacifist.   If someone tries to take it from you, even if you're standing right next to them, the capture bar operates as though you were on the other side of the map.
---
I used about 100 stringers on her tonight and it didn't seem to help very much. Did get her to regen though but after that it was over. 
---
In excavator PA, you're around 400 defense. 200 damage will be reduced to ~78, after defense. If they've got AA weapon, it'll be ~92.
---
With max incisor (no AA perk): ~119.
---
200 is pretty low for any pvp build. (I can unload ~1.5 rounds/sec at over 200dmg per shot.) And I'm not even setup for pvp.
---
Five to ten minutes irl. Just hang out at your camp while it happens. Doesn't take too long. 
---
If it was a new no build area then I wouldn't be able to rebuild my camp there I would think.
---
Go back to the left of the map, explore a bit, don't rush it. 
---
Well, this is an online game. That changes every week. Of course you're going to need updates. Most of the weekly updates are really small, too. This DLC is the largest one in quite a while.  
---
And I'm on satellite, it takes me longer to download things than most, and it's not even that bad. Doesn't your console download updates when you're not playing?
---
Would making a group, then have one person join another server so both could solo work?
---
Man, you must be a great guy to be around at parties. Who knew you had an outstanding personality
---
‚ÄúOnce upon a time, there was a brain in a jar... and they lived happily ever after. The end‚Äù 
---
Awww, too bad.  I usually sell the plan for 300-400 caps ... but that probably not helping, lol.  Good luck out there in the wasteland.
---
Yea u should be fine.
---
If you actually closed the app and restarted and they came back, that's worse than mine. Leaving servers didn't clear them and I left my PS4 go into power save mode and one was there the next day, bit closing the app completely and restarting it always gets rid of them for me.
---
If I hear anything I'll share but you should definitely report yours as it sounds much more annoying.
---
Thanks! :D

If you look closely, you can spot the invisible scuba mask

Can Do 3, do a lap around whitesprings and look in all the trash cans. Even in the enclave. One lap and youll have enough food for the day easily. I have 5 purifiers at my house. I fill up before i log off and whenever im home. Always have at least 24 purified water on me. Plenty. Food is PLENTIFUL if you just look for it. Mole Rats with the food perk, berries and stuff with the perk  craft all food with Super Duper 3. 
---
This all takes little time. Its a habit. The effects of some mutations far outweigh the minor inconveniences of food and water.
---
Also, if people don't lock their purifiers and I'm out, yes. I will take all your water hahahaha. But I'll ALWAYS leave a bag of something for you on your porch. Maybe farmed legendaries, flux, something as payment for your volunteered kindness.
---
Here come Leeroy...
---
If you left week one then you don‚Äôt need any new content since you‚Äôve still got the entire base game to finish 
---
Yup this is it, shame there isn't anything good in there really
---
They have already done a cool down on players. Once I launch a nuke there is a 3hr cool down per silo, per player. So what's the reasoning behind this new bs!? I drop nukes &amp; farm legendaries. That's my thing. Even legendary creatures are not spawning. I'm not saying this is they main reason. But every single time they have released and update they have broken the things the "most" people enjoyed the game for. They are by far they most horrible code writing company I have ever encountered. This is the first and last fall out I will ever play. Good luck to ya though, keep buying their games and make them think their doing a great job. 
---
Some sort of magical thing attached to your leglungs.
---
I think todd will be inviting you round his place after he reads this achievement. You'd be level if you hadn't  kept switching 
---
I really like this idea, it really adds to the RPG factor of the game.  It'd also be neat if the fridge stuff when spoiled turned into a different type of spoiled food, like an antibiotic, or "New Life" where it's mutated moldy food with special properties.
---
Pretty sure a few times I‚Äôve seen the plan rotate threw the free state vendor. Try checking on him every so often
---
First lets put this lie to bed:
---
"Just because yall get bored and want to ruin other peoples experience that dont do pvp just makes you a asshole period"
---
Getting a high bounty to attract high level PvP is a legit tactic advertised by Bethsda. Its a PvP game. The only way to do that is to wreck an entire base. I wreck the first base i come across to get my bounty. Its not about the owner. It's about baiting the high level bounty hunters. I dont want to upset anyone.
---
So you are starting your argument from a false pretense. We are not trying to make you upset. We bought a pvp game. We are pvping within the rules. 
---
We are PvPing and having fun. You are on a personal vendetta to do something that you view is harrassment. Its in the terms. If you target someone with the intent to cause greif your breaking the rules. Im not targetting anyone specifically because of who they are &amp; im not motivated by causing greif. You are targetting people with the intent to cause greif. 
---
It makes you a bully. Lol. "Greifers" would enjoy the pvp anyways so it doesnt matter.
---
Its clear that the developers intended forcing PvP via CAMP destruction as a fun little *feature*. See the wrecking ball PERK card.
---
Bethesda commented on reversing that decision by making changes to the pacifist setting. Pacifist may soon mean you cannot be harmed &amp; your CAMP cannot be damaged.
---
Changes will be made. PvP players will be segregated. Unwanted PvP is going to be even scarcer than it is now
---
But is it really greifing? Maybe its not about you... Maybe the CAMP wrecking crew is seeking out PvP... By design. As advertised by Bethesda.
---
PvP players are stuck with you until survival drops. Just like you are stuck with them. Its not fun to be lectured after I smash your base, take your junk, and farm you for caps. Im just playing the game i was sold. I want to be attacking PvP willing players. Its boring attacking people that just log out or get salty.
---
The point is... Bethesda knows you want a true pacifist mode. They also sold me a PvP survival game. They cant give you true Pacifist mode until after they launch survival mode. Otherwise they would just be removing PvP entirely.
---
Just give it a month or 2 and its going to change. I dont consider it greifing unless its personal or the attacker is chasing you across servers... In your case: its personal &amp; you are chasing people into different servers or stalking.  
---
Imagine if i chased people into servers or kept a list of targets... Jeez. Would you defend that?
---
This would be absolutely AWESOME for a south of the border Fallout portraying how other countries dealt with the war
---
No i just joined the server and walked to my cottage. They arrived about ten minutes later and just killed me repeatedly and tea bagged my body. I don‚Äôt know anything about workshops or even anything because I didn‚Äôt get much of a chance.
---
I heard nerd rage is not giving a damage bonus 
---
Sorry to burst you're bubble but as soon as I left Vault 76, I beat the game. After that it was just about wondering around the country side avoiding all you lunatics that were in the Vault to begin with.
---
Thank gosh I'm not the only person having this issue. I've been speaking to bethesda support and not one of the things has helped me fix this issue. I've done about 10 different things now. I also don't have mods either.
---
748250
---
You are something for sure yelling at me for actually enjoying the game and saying im spending my money wrong when you also own the game that doesn't make a whole lotta sence and you sounds dumb as hell thinking that leaving the game will suddenly change everything just scream louder someone will hear but no one will care 
---
Think of it as enchanted
---
What a champ am i right 
---
I‚Äôve always had a minor headcanon that the cult somehow started the War. They released a darkness into the world that grew And eventually culminated in the nuclear war.
---
Oh alright, i'l check that one more often! Thanks :)
---
Good luck hope you find it soon.  Great fun grenade to play with
---
That would be rad.

It‚Äôs not just one perk- I said bloodied weapon but it‚Äôs multiple things that all kick in at low health/high rads. 5 str from Radicool, ~60% damage from Adrenal Reaction, 15% from nerd rage, 15% more from bloody mess.. plus 9/9 Slugger perks. And whatever I get from my baseline 15 strength, obviously.
---
Found it n Xbox. I was hoping the difference was more distinct 
---
I had been holding off on doing the missions until I had ran out of regular stuff to do... but now I'm 1/2 way to a Mr. Fuzzy head and this has been heart breaking! I know your feels. 
---
REPOSTING this daily is toxic.
---
America... Fuck yeah
---
Well the Mysterious Stranger knows me by name and shows up all the time. I never feel lonely. I feel loved.
---
Maybe eventually when Paladin paint drops it will be super dark.
---
I noticed when I stashed my PA tonight that it had 2 cores in it. 
---
I'm on ps4. Did you snag it at Grafton?

I started a new character, lone-wolf explorer. I stick to the areas that match my character and ignore the main &amp; side missions. Explore, kill, scavenge, when I hit an appropriate level I plan on doing the main mission.
---
I have a 2 shot lmg and an instigating explosive lmg that have been collecting dust. Ill have to take them for a spin, and use up all my 308 in 15 minutes.
---
Is there any update on this?  It still happens to me.  Are we to assume that it is in fact working as intended and VATS user in PA just get punished?
---
First of all you took time out of your precious game play to comment on my post. If you don't like what I have to say then take ya ass on somewhere. Go hang out with Todd. Sure you 2 would make a great couple.  ‚úåüèº
---
Also I am on PS4 count me in
---
Not in vats.
---
 lvl 50, Severe receiver, stabilized long barrel, aligned stock, piercing mag, reflex sight (circle), suppressor, standard paint.

I tried to get a video of it happening just now, and it wouldn't happen. lol

---
HERE IS A LIST OF ALL THE PETTY STUFF:
---
Bethesda needs to hire new people.
---
We should have a Fusion Core regenerator plan
---
Anyone feel like FO/76 would have been considerably better as co-op only and not PVP?
---
Graham is proof that this game would benefit from more NPCs.
---
Idk if this has been said already, but is there a reason purified water isn't treated as boiled water?
---
Passive mode should make it to where other players can‚Äôt kill you, destroy your base, or interfere with your gameplay at all.
---
Legendary effects should be craftable
---
Can we get a roof piece to make bigger warehouses roofs more consistent?
---
[Console] - Can we get the ability to store more than 50 photos?
---
I‚Äôm quite tired of having to constantly have weight reduction perk cards taking up special points just to be able to manage my carry weight
---
A machinist shop capturable workshop where you can take steel and convert it into a choice of gears, springs, or screws would be cool.
---
Please let screws be one of the materials gained from scrapping weapons, like in FO4.
---
Free Fast Travel between stations?
---
All Bulked Items Should ‚ÄúWeigh‚Äù Less than the Sum of Their Components. 
---
Travel Agent perk-lvl2 move your camp for free or at a reduced price. Lvl3 fast travel while over encumbered(free or pay caps)
---
Instead of expanding the storage limit, how about craftable Stash boxes with weight reducing properties? 
---
Give. Me. A. Fridge. 
---
For the love of god make VATS stop targeting friendlies if i'm in passive mode. 
---
The studio's enthusiasm needs to match the player community or we won't have the stamina to last until changes are made
---
Bethesda please give us the ability to either sell or scrap ammunition 
---
My one wish from Bethesda is more stash space
---
Now that all the duped items are gone, can we get an increase on vendor cap limits?
---
Let technical data stack, and give us a bigger reward for more data.
---
Let us keep learned plans across our different characters
---
New stashbox to trade between your other characters
---
I did a reinstall I think it may work now 
---
I saw that as well...I'm just waiting for the Scorchbeast/Death law.
---
I wish people would realize this because I've been trying to sell an Anti Armor LMG all day! lol
---
His cake day is Pi Day? That's the crustiest thing I've ever heard
---
is it cosmetic only?
---
I drink your tears; delicious salt. You're so toxic and literal that you deserve it.
---
I'm in the save boat.  I don't carry many cores because I rarely use Power Armor.  But when there's a SB Queen fight I go in PA.  You put it perfectly...I feel like I'm punished for using VATS in PA, like it's a penalty or something.  OP-God Power, Bloodied Nerd Rage builds literally get all the perks and VATS users have to pay the price.  Unacceptable.  BALANCE.  THE .  GAME!!!!
---
Yea, like all PA paints.
---
Not really, your kinda of a dumbass. Plus you can tell from your post you have trash stuff and try to pawn it off on people for caps. You should definitely be at ws when I do quit. Maybe then you'll have nice stuff to sell. 
---
Same for me. Locked out without touching alcohol. Simply stayed on server while c.a.m.p. couldn't be placed so I could check out the interfering c.a.m.p. This happened three login attempts in a row before getting stuck with the disconnect message on login attempt
---
wendigos themself can be scorched right (like when the SBQ spawns) so maybe thats why.
---
You _don't_ breathe through your arms?
---
Pft, weirdo
---
Show up, wreck someone's place, stumble away drunk. Repeat
---
You're in your camp. Repairing your armor when suddenly the sky turns to static like a miss tuned television. The sound of the world around you drops in and out. You hear a faint robot voice in the distance as your vision snaps to a single pinpoint of light. "Pow...eeeerrrr faillllling. Simmmmulatttioooon deeeeeactivaaaating." Suddenly your eyes see again. A blurred fog is lifted and you see a clear canopy infront of you. You begin to convulse and gag as you feel a tube snaked into your stomach. You slowly rip it out of your throat and gasp for air. You begin to take in your surroundings. A sign on the wall reads EPA research facility. A man stands in front of you. He looks you into the eyes and says "Hi. I'm the chosen one. Have you seen any GECKS around here?" Roll credits.
---
Which parade event?
---
Grafton?
---
It starts automatically if the event is not in cooldown. Find the monster and murder it‚Äôs shit
---
Complete
---
Parade event doesn‚Äôt start until Monday and will be available for a week according to what they released
---
The Fasnacht event hasn't been released yet
---
Look for addiction. They aren't too hard to come by. 
---
What console are you on?
---
I dont think your grasping the point your being a fucking idiot over a timer and whats the point of selling high tier gear all the time i use the stuff i dont use the outfits 
---
uwu I‚Äôm on Xbox and just scrapped mine. do you still have it? ;~;
---
I'm the type who would risk a bounty and pick the lock just to turn on your beacons lol 
---
Why is everyone at my camp? Son of a ..
---
You can solo this game, but it'd probably be easier/funner if you made some friends. 
---
Solo, though...Explore the Forest area first, it's the lower level area. Most things in that area are level 10 and under, I generally see level 3 mobs there. A good spot to hang out is Flatwoods. The only thing you lose when you die is your junk, and you can reclaim it if you get back to it in time (and another player hasn't stolen it...). But there's a Red Rocket with a stash where you can leave your junk, so you don't have to worry about it as much. Scrap your junk before you put it away, it weighs less that way. There's a daily event there, so that's good EXP. Plus lots of robots and some scorched, and the occasional radroach of course.   
---
If you want to get some "fast" exp you can go to the Whitesprings. It's going to have higher level mobs, but if you can find a spot where you can shot things, and they can't get to you, it's practically free exp. Just wait for a higher level player to make a run through, and "tag" the kills with a bullet before they kill it. In the basement of the Whitesprings itself is a handy shopping mall, with a workshop area and more stash boxes.   
---
Hey bud you play the game the way you see fit and I will do the same. This post wasnt about how the pvp works. This person was trying to play his way and somebody came in a messed it up. That's messed up. So yes their are people like me that help low level players out and will not tolerate people coming in to ruin their game. I'm not here to argue.  Have fun in the wasteland 
---
yeah...20's are tough, get to about 333-35 and it all becomes much easier to handle. I spent my 20's getting workshops and just exploring the left side of the map. 
---
I killed a level 275 with a 400 cap bounty the other day. 
---
Way to funny 
---
I was expecting it too and it didn't. I was just going to try and pick it up again if I had lost it. 
---
did you get an email or anything? i dont really want to download the update until I know for sure that im unsuspended.
---
I had an audience of RadStags when I came to. Must have been a fan of the show.
---
My friends are -- They are great. 'Specially that lovely little brick over there. How you doin', Bricky?!
---
I uninstalled from the launcher, then deleted the FO76 game folder. Good to know.
---
Does anyone skim postings before they rant anymore?  Seems like no. If you want to see what people did to fix, check for previous postings
---
I have 3 weapons and 1 set of armor I use. Sell everything else. You must not know the good spots, you have to get out of the forest lil buddy. Put the big boy/girl pants on and go drop some nukes and get ya legendary farm on. Maybe then you'll understand wtf I'm talking about. Anyways it's been real, have fun. ‚úåüèº

---
Oh this was before the nerf
---
Dude what i think nukes are boring as hell i used to farm white springs all the time and force spawn the ghouls all the time but its just boring its not the best time waster any more but hopfully you can sell that leather arm and minigun thats some god tier gear only the gods would use such a thing 
---
I think you can go to the Charleston fire dept and buy another from the vendor there. Saw one before on xb1
---
I do make fart noises with my arm pits does that count.
---
rofl that serves me right for only reading the subject line before replying!
---
Just uninstall it now, apparently it could take a couple weeks to fix because it‚Äôs bugged and linked to some vault content that‚Äôs coming later.
---
You potentially make alcohol and fish at the same time if they added it into the game. Just need your camp need a water source. 
---
As it would be in the Fallout universe. 
---
Get rid of your mods.
---
I think as long as you don't pick up any holotapes you're probably safe. 
---
Damn! That‚Äôs a tough break. I guess tomorrow is a new day! You will get those plans sooner or later
---
Couple weeks huh well i guess we wont be missing our freind here 
---
Thank you!!!
---
No, my boyfriend can't play, either. That's why I'm angry.
---
I never miss an opportunity to tell my one and only Chemistry joke.
---
Two Atoms are at a bar. One suddenly grabs the other and says, "DONT MOVE! I JUST LOST A PROTON!!"
---
Other Atom looks around but doesnt see it. "are you sure?"
---
"IM POSITIVE!"
---
I'm dying to get my hands on these paints. That and bos combat armor.  Whenever that gets readded 
---
And let us put a code on it so we can crack open a Cold one with the boys. 
---
My camp was south from Watoga.
---
First login after the update - was invaded by lvl50 Scorchbeast - sorted it out with help from turrets - got decent 1* legendary weapon from it (unlike it was before patch).
---
(and, unlike before patch, it didn't ruined my house - not completely, at least)
---
It's satisfying.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs probably what I will end up doing. Thanks 
---
They replied about most of them on Reddit. Check the Bethesda replied bot
---
And no pics or videos?

I deleted old custom fallout76custom.ini, runned this script from Nexus. It created new file and found all mods, but still not worked.
---
I copied sResourceArchive2List from fallout76.ini and added manually mods that I use and then it worked.
---
Don't know is this is still right, but not me and and other stuff don't fall underground and outside game area.
---
Seems legit. Personally i've always been a fan of the whole, CEO of vault tec started the war due to being an insane zealot theory. Insane cultist would fit there too, tho. \^\^ 
---
worst case Ontario right there.
---
Not in my opinion.  I still play but it's not very exciting . For me at least.  Plus it broke nukes so I can't do that now either.  Which I normally do everyday 
---
They broke the nukes again?
---
Sadly no. At first it didn't occur to me I was someplace unreleased (who would immediately think that?) and then as I realized what was happening, I got excited and forgot. 
---
How are there mods for the game if the creation kit doesn't work with 76?
---
Mods, forget which one was the culprit.
---
The problem is the main mission skip almost two full biomes. What you feel is a decebt pace is actually skipping about 20 lvls. I restarted and took my time doing Toxic Valley and Ash Heap so when I got to Savage Divide I was at least around 30-40ish. I also tried to stay away from high levels so the mobs didnt spawn in too high. But like everyone is saying, just take your time. :)
---
:'(
---
STO reference or just ironic? The public need to know! 
---
Oh... I'm sorry.
---
The better inventory one? I use it to see the weight of all the combined items
---
Seems like you have something against us Russians, but yeah, private servers would be great, even if we couldn't use workshops!
---
This is so amazing!! Wish you had a vod!!
---
LOL! nice
---
I legitimately think all the game needs is private servers similar to ark were you can control certain aspects of the game. Just imagine being able to PERMANENTLY hold wade airport. The settlements that could be built there with other players or the RP with trade caravans going from the ammo factory to the industrial farm. 
---
So while I'm glad for wild Appalachia and the other stuff on the road map i think private servers would make the wait much more bearable.
---
You can.
---
Even at rather low levels.
---
Use your C.A.M.P.
---
2 (two) upgraded machinegun turrets, if repaired repeatedly, can shred lvl50 scorchbeasts just fine - looks like automatic heavies buff affected them as well, which is NICE.
---
Lvl80 may require more turrets - but since we can have up to 10 at once it's way less of a problem.
---
You don't plan to use all that Junk in your stash anyway, don't you? Why not converting it into dead scorchbeasts :)
---
Missing the point of the topic completely. The title is the point the reasoning for it is minor to the suggestion. 
---
I think of this non stop while playing 
---
I have this bug without taking alcohol out of my stash. I had alcohol in the fermenter and was server hopping farming robots in watoga. Logged out to cook dinner and dad for a bit then put the kids to bed. Tried to log back in and disconnected every time. Opened a support ticket and got the run around before being escalated to a ‚Äúspecialist‚Äù waiting to hear from them.
---
You should've gotten it in the overseer stash there.
---
Time to start grinding nukashine to find unreleased DLC üôè
---
Most of the stuff you trigger when exploring are events. You can always open your map and click the event marker and stop following to not participate. Main quest stuff requires you to follow it and do specific things so you can‚Äôt really trigger them on accident. You can also stop tracking all quests in the pip boy and just explore away. 
---
Awesome be right there
---
Omw where you at?
---
Ha......ha...ha..................ha
---
Easier and cheaper fast travel 
---
By Appalachian Antiques
---
I would agree.  Hold onto the item unless a it‚Äôs reasonable deal.
---
Maybe duping is still going on.
---
One YouTuber was telling everyone to use this perk for 300% dmg unfortunately it's not true... Not so overpowered it doesn't even give you this 100% from description.
---
I mean I did, haven‚Äôt played much for years, but the new item gets rid of radiation, but the card to keep mutations only mentions radaway.
---
One spawns in a crate on the side of the Whitesprings resort facing the station, it's near the cars by the dumpsters and fusion generators at the Service Entrance.
---
Your good, don‚Äôt worry about it.
---
I was just saying that cause the milk in minecraft cured all buffs/debuffs
---
An innovation like that would save so much time!
---
Probably a later update
---
I got what you meant.
---
Thanks ! That‚Äôs a thought ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Thanks so much
---
Check morgantown airport overseer's cache.
---
This bug has been acknowledged by the devs, there a post on the front page talking about this, according to what one of the community managers said, there's a hotfix commeon
---
I was really hoping to stack party boy and nuka nut but neither works. Its probably for the best tho. Without any buffs aside from 10 strength, adrenaline perks and adrenal reaction I was able to get my bloodied deathclaw gauntlet to do 556 damage. I drank the nukashine and it went up to 900 something.
---
Complaining about wealth? Sounds like communism to me!
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs tough. Some duping exploit still exists (as of recently, not sure anymore) and those that are savvy enough to use the various discords/reddit market places have acquired most of what they want/need at discounted (duped) prices.  
---
That being said, I think the market will pick up as the game releases more content and newer players continue to join the game and if/when they fix the exploits. So good gear and even tier 2 gear will gain in value it will just take time.  
---
Also, the legendary purveyor could wildly shake the market up so there‚Äôs that too.
---
Cheers, big ears
---
That's depend what you are selling, i have no problem selling items for 5-10k and o bought a gun for 40k
---
Loooool
---
Noticed this too. Even though i have Speed Demon mutation the rate of hunger/thirst seem a bit too much than before the patch. Been using bubblegum to take the edge off and not have to eat/drink everything in sight.
---
they‚Äôre gonna release the items weekly. The backpack releases in May I believe 
---
wade airport has too much clutter from my point of view. The country race track is much cleaner and nicer while offering both aluminum as well as junk and silver nodes (silver junk can be sold directly to vendors with no need to make giant chunks of it so its quite handy for the daily touring around all the vendors) and steel for those who need it in case of excessive ammo crafting. It has a nice form to it as well as an open source of water nearby so you dont have to use the hellishly slow manual water pump to get some non-purified water for cooking&amp;brewing purposes.
---
Due to that I think its superior to wade airport but thats just my own opinion.
---
The point is : yes being able to hold workshops permanently would be awesome, especially when i always have to invest the first 30 minutes of my fallout sessions to build the workshop base as the blueprint system is not capable of saving even half of all the stuff you can build sadly. Nonetheless, this would all be for naught if you still get people onto the server you could not even communicate with so thats why I would like a server list.
---
Im only speaking out of experience (in this game and from Dota 2 as well) but yes, for me it has almost always been russians that are ruining games.
---
Yeah, he‚Äôs even got unfinished quests showing in his images. Not only that, there are some perks that aren‚Äôt available until that point anyway. 
---
I‚Äôve gotten all the achievements, but I wouldn‚Äôt say ice completed the game. There are several public events I haven‚Äôt participated in and I‚Äôm still missing a ton of recipes. 
---
This right here is actually why I kinda hope they don't protect camps or make behind the club house a no camp zone
---
These parties you speak of. Do they consist of Fallout memes? Because if so, no, I probably wouldn't be fun to be around at them. As nothing would be funny about them. 
---
What do you get with comparable guns now?  Just curious.
---
Multiple blueprints? Load the tiny one for selling on the road and then plant home when you get home.
---
If it's anything like this newest update it will definitely shake things up. Everybody wants wants unyielding sentinel armor to farm the queen now lol. But yeah I think I can manage the space and hold onto the stuff for now. Thank you!
---
I know this is months old but I also have a anti armor and zealots 50 Cal and wanted to know what one is better anti armor or zealots
---
I don't go full bloodied. About 50% health gives me about 230 dmg
---
From what? You don‚Äôt actually get any money from playing the game like a normal person because the vendors are ghetto poor and nothing drops money. The only way I‚Äôve seen to actually make money is running around looting cash stashes which is retarded and not worth my time. I think my character is like 120 and I have 7k caps and have only bought a few blueprints. Terrible design. Enemies should drop money, loot should be sellable to vendors for a lot more, and they should have unlimited caps.
---
Don't be so quick to trash talk the Game. You're falling through the world because you're using mods which - as of current - are an unintended feature.
---
This has been happening to me a TON
---
You can check the roadmap to be sure, but I am pretty sure that it is coming out in late May
---
Unyielding cavalier armor, all kinds of rare bloodied weapons, explosives, op melee. Not standard stuff
---
People unpack the BAK files, mess around with them, and then repack them.
---
Headed there, now! I quit the main story line real early. Thanks for the heads up!
---
This  just happened to me. I suspect shenanigans as well because a lv 51 should not be immune to a 2SE direct shot to the head and take almost no damage and then kill me (lv  117) in 2 shots. He and his friends leveled my base, which I'll have to scrounge to rebuild. 
---
I am not paying to play this game to have assholes like this ruin it and get no recourse. Ban griefers, at least temporarily. Fucking fix this shit.
---
Well im sure they'd add more removable junk at wade if they did private. 
---
That's the beauty of private servers and places like reddit you can find one were people would be able to communicate 
---
Thank you so kindly! I strayed from the main quest line early. I should‚Äôve realized. Thank you!
---
For example, all sound for the game would be in the Sound BAK archive. People unpack that archive, change the files, then repack the archive.
---
Being able to inspect legendaries at vendors.
---
This is information I wish I knew when I started.
---
Some mods are broken. But the fallout76custom.ini is where your problem is. Go to Nexus and check for updates. Also Perk Loadout Manager has an updated .ini you can use to rebuild your old one. Not sure if Better Inventory has been fixed yet.
---
I dont think Bethesda made you do a single one of those things.
---
yep. Can only agree on this. My CAMP is now also transferred from right next to the dirt track race workshop where i had my self made river house to the middle of nowhere in the forest with no landmark nearby. Just so i dont get griefed.
---
Now the problem is of course the insane travelling cost and that when i claim a workshop in a region that i need to travel often to bring down my costs that it only ends in some asshole starting to claim it from me, fast-travel to my location while it is being claimed so he can kill me even though im in pacifist mode because it counts as legal pvp as long as the workshop is being "contested" (despite being half the world away from it)
---
Before the game came out, everyone wanted to be an ‚Äúnpc‚Äù then they realized there are not enough people in a server and thats just not how the game functions
---
My gamertag is Shanathan9489, feel free to message me, I'll shoot you a message when I'm on tomorrow and I could do it for you. 
---
The greenhouse build and use mechanics in ark survival evolved is amazing and I would love to see something like it in FO76 
---
"I don' have a drinkin' problem! &lt;hic&gt; I'm on a QUEST!"
---
Just played for two and a half hours. I had about twenty items, rather newly cooked, spoil in that time. No I do not have Good With Salt, but this rate of decay is noticeably greater. Thinking of just switching to dog food for a while. I'm not even fast traveling much. Everything expires waaaaay too fast right now. It's very noticeable. 
---
Watoga legendary bots exploding on death and ending up who knows where.  No loot. 
---
I 2nd the inspecting weapons/armor from vendors, buying blind.
---
Something I haven't seen brought up and not from the last patch; but can we set the screen size in a setting within the game?  I have a cheap 39 inch tv that displays as a 40.  A lot of games let you set the borders. I can't be the only one, it would improve the experience quite a bit.  Still playable, but it's minorly annoying and seems like an easy option to add.
---
Cap is at 800 which is pretty reasonable
---
It's 800 now!
---
800 pounds 
---
btw, a question.  
---
Did zealot legendary opt increase on scorched beast queen?
---
Cool down time to launch a nuke
---
Do you have adrenal mutation? I think it can be additive with this bonus and that's why there is less then double dmg i need to test it with suppressed mutations
---
Awesome.that makes me want to come back on now, I managed to fill my storage with junk so I could build stuff and some.ammo would fill it as well 
---
Happened to me both site alpha and site bravo 
---
Thanks for sharing this, not gonna sit here and list accolades but I have done a lot on my main and was worried they were lost forever. Hopefully they come up with a hotfix, but I'll put in a ticket as well.
---
It actually works pretty well. I wish I could show you a 3d view but I copied kind of how I set up turrets in Ark survival evolved. Its my fallout version of a turret tower. 
---
They could even add a freezer to make ice cold nuka colas with add bonuses
---
I do exactly the same thing
---
New quest is at Morgantown, and good place to nuke for flora and farming hydration fluids from low level mobs 
---
The Capital Wasteland isn‚Äôt far from WV in real life, and seeing as some people like Deacon and Kellogg have been able to travel from the West Coast to the Commonwealth in a few years alone the Puppet man should be able to travel to the Capital from WV easily.
---
i hope you prepare enough ammo for this. :D
---
Just found these ID readers today... None of my cards work either. Very mysterious!!
---
Thank you!
---
Is this straight damage? No buffs? No perks? If so then that's impressive. 
---
Today was the first time I played in months. I log in and 3 lvl 80 scorchbeasts attacked my shack. The garbage they drop isn‚Äôt even worth the ammo it took to kill them... but they would have demolished my camp so what can you do. 
---
Right? I already tried searching the hornwright estate and found nothing. No mention of the readers. Might try the Industrial building next but that place is HUGE. Might just be for an upcoming quest that's not out yet?
---
Where does this come from?
---
We already have guitars at our bases.
---
...ohhh...BASS guitars...
---
Nah, tuba's got you covered, bro.
---
They've also increased camp build limit. So you can build bigger camps also if that's your thing
---
Yeah adrenal mutation is what I was talking about when I said adrenal reaction. I want to do more test but I dont have much quantum and I dont really know a good place to farm aside from the factory which has been picked clean last couple times I visited.
---
being able to remove more junk and clutter from workshops is also a part of my wishlist but its not on the important end. I would love to have a cleaned up version of Spruce Knob but that can wait. Most important is not staying any longer on servers full of people that one can only detest.
---
I had a standard camp and all 15 power armours I found and someone walked in and stole all of them xD so I stopped worrying about camps after that
---
It's either bug going on for everyone or they disabled nukes for the faschnact event and nukashine for the high traffic of players that this is attracting
---
These are a rolling release (all the future updates are gonna be like this- sprinkled over many weeks, not stopped all at once). [Check here for details](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019) 
---
Yes this is why I‚Äôm on here looking right now not same situation but my wife is not able to access her main character just keeps saying disconnected from server as soon as she try‚Äôs to join a word but her other characters are fine just her main on PS4.
---
Serums remove the negative side effects for 1 hour
---
Better to make Morgantown a greenzone to prevent nukes rather than doing this. My daily queen hunt has been ruined and wasted some nuclear key cards trying to see if it fixed itself.
---
3 star bloodied weapon are selling great, are you selling for caps?
---
This happened to me too,  it's INCREDIBLY distressing to seemingly lose your main character.
---
When I tried to log in Thursday night I got hit with this bug and legitimatley lost the will to keep playing the game.
---
Did you kill them immediately to keep your secrets?  "You saw nothing, antler-heads!"
---
Perks and legendary, without them I think it sits around 50 or at least that was what it was when I was in power armor. Small bursts will murder most enemies in half a second, it's brutal. 
---
Sorry to hear that. Man this sucks.
---
its griefing you toxic player scum, go play fortnite or some other shit you belong there, not here.
---
Welcome... To Vault MISSING TEXTURE.
---
My 50. Maschine gun being unloaded every time i log in.
---
There are locations around the map that spawn random events. One of the places is east of Watoga on the road out to the Bog workshop. There are several others, Grahm, the Responder Bot, the dead Trick or Treater, the dead Civil War reenacter, sometimes it's robots talking with each other. With the Nukashine content out, you can also add a new Lemonade Stand to the list. A lot of the random events drop plans, some of them are less interesting or obvious, and are random unit spawns. Outside of Robco, I took a picture of a deathclaw fighting a gulper that spawns near there. Deathclaws don't really spawn near there, like ever. It was a fun random event.
---
That's what I expect from a light machine gun. Now only if 50 cal bullets did that but better lol 
---
Thought I had just seen one in Harper's.
---
I‚Äôm having issues picking anything up in general right now. I keep mashing x but it doesn‚Äôt pick it up. Servers seem steady but lag on actions 
---
Just buy from vendors, that's what I'm doing, you need to spend those caps on something
---
How did that cause your account to be restricted?
---
At the vendor there? Or around the area?
---
Will backpacks increase carry weight?
---
but whitespring golf club camps are deserved to be destroyed
---
I may have lost my temper and sent him a bad message... :(
---
overseer become SBQ
---
Also, i would like the effects of my armor to stay when entering Power armor. I wanna keep my +50 carry weight.
---
The game is more stable since they been rolling put bug fixes and QoL. Some issues like the Scorchbeast spam, high turret and light budget and low stash limit have been fixed with the stash limit 800 now and the turret budget reduced. Also  the first DLC series for the game has just started and the roadmap for the year has been released with the Nukashine quest added to the game allowing alcohol crafting, more DLC content is going to be released on April 9th
---
The snapshot reads: ‚ÄúIncrease your inventory with new customizable backpacks‚Äù I remembered the trailer differently, but maybe we will be able to actually craft these (hopefully)
---
It's definitely not affecting everyone. I've fought the SBQ and seen 3 other nuke zones since the update. 
---
Ehh I guess I could do that but I dont really want to unless... how much do you think people would pay for vintage nukashine if its enough to cover the cost of nuka quantum plus a little profit then I might be able to net me some caps from the impatient unarmed pshyco
---
You don't have to pick them after the first time lol I
---
The old ones still work!
---
Ended up in the Ash Heap, near Site Kittery after my blackout.  The nearby molemen were very confused. 
---
It's probably tough to determine since it's new, and most of the veteran players have the map thoroughly covered by now anyway, but has anyone ended up nowhere near anywhere they'd traveled before?  Like in a completely new region, or gotten a new fast travel point from it?  The roulette group might want to collect some data on it.
---
The vendor there usually has it
---
I always get murdered when I hold Hemlock Holes. But I want that acid for my smelting! 
---
So much fun getting killed in .5 seconds by a generic Bloodied  build PKer while I‚Äôm killing Gulpers or radscorpions. I‚Äôm not against PvP at all but I‚Äôd like a contest. Or at least, if I‚Äôm getting surprise murdered, I‚Äôd like to keep the workshop I just sank playtime into instead of getting repeated grief killed as many times as he can. It‚Äôs not even a contest *for* the workshop which I understand. Its using the contesting mechanic to grief players with a likely unfair contest between two very different kinds of players. 
---
I wouldn't even mind if it was a nerf, I just want the info so I can plan &amp; build accordingly
---
I‚Äôll give it a try, the quest doesn‚Äôt update until I pick them up...hope your right, at least I can stop adding to *the horror*
---
Okay awesome! Thank you!!
---
I found the spot, not that hard.
---
\[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/s2o2FsZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/s2o2FsZ.png))
---
Yea, what I usually do is just open the door with the two keycards and then kill the bots, click the button. Hope I helped!
---
What were you originally suspended for?  Were you over maximum weight and had to destroy stuff?
---
Not out yet 
---
Wait until May 23rd, then go to him!
---
If I am running workshops, I accept that I am not protected by passive mode. That is part of the game that should not be changed. If you want to maintain a workshop, then guess what, you are essentially saying I am a pvper and open to attack. 
---
I agree that I hate it when assholes appear out of nowhere and attack my camp. I just quickly leave the server and move to another. So far that has worked 100% of the time. I also hate the freaking slap damage. If I am running in pacifist mode and currently not running any workshops, then I should not be able to be attacked. Especially if the only way for me to retaliate is to go through 2 menus to turn off pacifist mode. By that time I would be dead. That is just beyond stupid. I accidentally hit people all the time with my 2 shot explosive handmade, then I get the measage that I am in pacifist mode and not causing any damage to the other players. Good, I know this, but they don't and turn around and start attacking me. Great now I have to leave the server because someone thinks I am attacking them and retaliate to kill me by slap damage and dozens of ghouls at white Springs. 
---
I noticed that, too.  I picked the melons and blackberries at my CAMP, and when I fast traveled back half an hour or so later to cut some caps off my journey, it was already regrown.  I wonder if they set food to respawn faster to help with the new quests and it also accidentally sped up the spoil rate.
---
nuke timer. I have 194 hours to wait.
---
What platform are you on I think I have an extra one I could sell
---
Ditto for me on AWOL. The final boss spawned in as a Crown enemy but then after a second upgraded itself to legendary. I killed it letting it mutate and got Crown enemy loot.
---
Don't know, most likely everyone want to brew something themselves but it can change when pvp servers will open.
---
You can still get them, even better there are bloodied two shot variants dropping for legendaries. 
---
No, but it is equally as impressive!
---
Nobody can steal your power armor.
---
Nah, I'm all good now &lt;3
---
Besides, I'm on Xbox so your offer wouldn't help. Thank you, though :)
---
Well my anti armor mini gun with stabilized is already doing the thing where the game can't even process the damage and resets them back to full health. So I can only image what the .50 does, but the poor hunting rifle is doomed to mediocre damage with the .50, must be a very small fat .50 round.
---
If you jump in to another power armour and drop the one you aren't wearing any more they can steal 
---
Good one :)
---
It's specifically been blocked from benefiting from Super Duper perk.
---
Bless you kind sir or madam...I can avoid adding to the mess, now if I can just find a sympathetic Dev to do a bit of a purge for me ü§™
---
We need doggos. Plz Bethesda, bring back the constant thing that has been in every Fallout since at least 3. Dogs. 
---
That's not stealing lol that's like dropping an item in a paper bag. You're throwing away power armor. 
---
It‚Äôs been that way for the entire game. Since launch. I can run through Whitesprings and know for a fact that I killed multiple 3* legendaries but check my loot and have only 1* weapons and armor. They just don‚Äôt drop 3* loot. Maybe 5% of the time MAX.
---
You said "South of the Border" and my mind went to the cheesy Mexican-themed theme park on the North Carolina/South Carolina border.  Which, to be fair, would also make a great DLC... you embark on a great journey from West Virginia to find fortune in Mexico, only to end up in Dillon, South Carolina thanks to a miscommunication.
---
It was in my house they stole it lol
---
I've had this with protectrons in glassed cavern. I'm pretty sure it was after 3 consecutive nukes on prime. I went inside to dodge fast travel away and got protectrons. The final scorchbeast was still there though. 
---
I'd love to use a 50 cal sniper rifle but the lever action is better... for whatever reason... oh well. I'm just gonna enjoy the game, and give bethesda time to sort out our sandbox
---
Ahh and he reported you, what dickwad move. I have been lucky so far that the few bad messages I may or may not have sent went unreported. I feel ya though.
---
 I had to leave one of the selling subs because I said someone was asking way too much for something and I got a temp restriction from a mod or admin, anyway I laid into him or her about what I thought about their &amp;%$#ing rules and what they could do with them and left. 
---
Where is he?
---
What about the underground areas?
---
I would recommend taking a look at the roadmap that was provided. It lays it all out.
---
Nope. Stop dropping frames. Place them. You log out or DC after dropping a frame it's gone forever. Place it. Select it like you're going to equip a piece of armor. No one can steal your power armor, but you can throw it away, which you've been doing
---
My character will need it but she doesn‚Äôt want to give up nukashine. And rum of course! Only so I can be obnoxious and run around asking, ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the rum?!‚Äù
---
Hm I mean we want a hub since the game was released.
---
November 14th is not yesterday I hope we get one but it's like the "Berliner Flughafen" we all know it won't happen 
---
How do you get that
---
Yep. And this is my problem with the changes of contesting  a workshop from anywhere. They can move into position, stealth, contest the workshop... and before you have a chance to respond they can snipe you for stealth damage. And if they have an instigating weapon the chances of them wiping you instantly before you can react are pretty high.
---
They gave all the benefits to the attacker and none to the defender.
---
I did something coz I could move them around lol either way they're gone good thing I know where to farm a few lol
---
Not in the game lol Does everyone just ignore the roadmap now?
---
I love the idea and all the work you put into. You should fix the echo issue and maybe try a better mic for yourself but it's a great concept!
---
Still happening to me :(
---
Some hours after that, it's spawned for me near the Overseer's camp :
---
https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/lechattricote/screenshot/11734129
---
What a surprise!
---
Gotta love that Colorado weather.
---
Lol all I told him was it wasn't the fact that he PVP'd...it was that he took my stuff. I get that it's part of the gams but I shouldn't be forced into participating. 
---
I'm in :3
---
Properly placed power armor return to your inventory automatically after 1 minute. They are named power armor chassis. Inspecting them shows an empty frame. Although if you drop a chassis with atom store paints on it, it'll destroy it. No one can steal your power armor. 
---
Gotta remember the economy in the fallout universe is crazy. Coffee at Slocum's Joe costs $28. There's a note you can find at the Slocum's Joe saying it's cost. 
---
The 2 shot not dropping anymore refers to laser and plasma weapons not dropping with two shot or explosive prefixes anymore 
---
No. Pros and cons of power armor.
---
Any/all legendary robots can explode on death, not just in Watoga. Although, I have noticed an issue with the bodies disappearing, especially if the protection recently just exited one of those pods. Something happens which causes the body to port back inside of the pod if they're not far away enough away from it.
---
May be it was the chassis lol 
---
Just had this happen at white springs, every enemy in the clubhouse was lvl 1 eyebots. It‚Äôs happened once before aswell but almost 2 months ago now. 
---
Yes please!  But then I want fishing in every game and there have been a few games that fishing sold me on them (looking at you far cry 5 and red dead redemption 2). 
---
Could be a banwve coming again.
---
Only joking but you never know 
---
Prime ammo creates more per craft than regular ammo. In a whitesprings nuke getting 15+ fluoro flux is easy. You craft twice the amount of shotgun ammo using the same materials if you make prime shells. 
---
Did you try to accces it again through the manhole you came out of? 
---
HELL NO. NO FREAKING MARIACHIS ALLOWED IN WEST VIRGINIA. 
---
For almost 10 years, I lived across the street from a family that had a party every 2 to 4 weeks on fridays or Saturdays that would go from like noon until 1 or 2 am with a live mariachi band. Its sad too, I grew up loving mariachi music. 
---
heavily bothers me, wish there where planters just to fix it. OR that bethesda would make a new model for it which is extended into the ground so it wouldn't visually float. 
---
I just want to have a bass to fry up or mount on the wall. 
---
That can be solved with a no build zone around that point. Atleast sense the update they can't have the 20 turret camps anymore. 
---
There's a small version? Let me know how to get it!
---
Billy bass playing a bass in our base; I can dig it.
---
You're calling him a dumbass, and yet you're the one selling "zealots" weapons as "SBQ killers."
---
You do realize that the queen isn't a scorched creature and that those shit guns don't do extra damage, right? 
---
Hahahaha I laughed way to hard. 
---
Looks like it to me, I'm getting about 15-20 mins of play before getting disconnected. 
---
Even my sweet Preston Garvey would be welcome here...i would love him to have my back. I wouldn't even mind (for awhile anyway) if he kept repeating, "Well, at least it's not raining!" PLEASE BETHESDA, GIVE US NPC'S OF OUR OWN...and oh yeah, an "Easy Mode." üò¢
---
I more than understand. Good luck going forward. 
---
That's exactly who I thought this was a reference too. 
---
Loved Deezer great character 
---
Yeah, it sucks because up until recently I wasn't having many issues, just lag, but now the server was so unstable I got fed up and just stopped for the night, I don't think I've stopped from server instability in like 2-3 months now, up until tonight.
---
Could you be anymore condescending?
---
That health damage bug seems to affect any weapon, and it feels like it's only getting worse as time goes on. It's not as bad as it was, but I notice it more and more on a daily basis even with my handmade.
---
go take a workshop and get griefed by douches who are beyond lvl 200 and have nothing better to do than kill anyone below lvl 100 who doesnt have duped insta-kill invisible gear. Thats the "community" here.
---
Thanks! Now I just worry about Fluffy getting killed. They can have my junk but don't come killing my animals. 
---

---
Timing is broke. 
---
I got the Brahmin milk White Russian. So I guess it's just a random drink recipe then?
---
I'm lost, I thought in the update trailer they said you could make backpacks to increase inventory? How do I even get that, I don't even see them listed in the patch notes, but it's on the video... 
---
They keep making bad mistakes.    
---
However, the more 'things' in a game to keep you playing then they've done right.
---
I've got several quantum plans. Mostly looted from super mutants. I hate to be the bearer of bad news but I think quantum grenades are bugged. The explosion radius is about as large as a mole miners body. It's extraordinarily hard to kill stuff with them. 
---
they are not in the game as everyone mentioned. The trailer lied, ok not really. But some one in marketing screwed up. 
---
I mean, I definitely could. But I thought I was being helpful by pointing out the single best repository for answers to his questions. I guess I could have copy and pasted it. But if it was me, and there was a great resource to answer my questions out there, I would hope someone would point me toward it.
---
It‚Äôs not like I said ‚Äúgoogle it, idiot‚Äù 
---
If you aren‚Äôt able to find one at the department I may have my old one. I‚Äôll have to check my stash when I get back on.
---
Yea, i get that.
---
I grew up in Stu Hart‚Äôs basement. 
---
I could play without a single crash
---
I must have missed that. Looking forward to it.
---
Oh my god are you on PC? It's sad to know they're bugged but i would buy a plan anyway from you!
---
Also well tuned/rested seems to fade too. It's seemingly not on every login but it's very often. 
---
Seems crashier.
---
Really?  What do you play on?
---
Well that‚Äôs just like, your opinion man. Why do you have to be such a D-bag? Who hurt you?
---
No.  I've been here the whole time. Not much has changed which affects enjoyment levels. It's still a boring budget and health-focused grind. 
---
I have the same issue. PS4 also. I sent in a request ticket. Seems the glitch may be with the game determining if you have your camp in the same spot as someone else, but it loads the kill camp switch as if you are in a no build zone. Really a bummer because the first time it happened I had just finished a camp I was working on for a few days. After that got deleted I wandered for hours and found a new spot. Spent a good 3-4 hours yesterday and a couple more today fine tuning it just to have it deleted again after a few more log ins. I‚Äôm about to build a tiny shack that‚Äôs easily placeable until this is resolved. 
---
I was having the same camp placement issue. I figure it's probably something along the lines of player camp proximity. Allowing you to build close, but when logging in and checking if you can place your camp it has a larger no build zone. I gave up on my original spot and moved, but my spot didn't have anything particularly special.
---
If the dwellers are supposed to be "the best and the brightest," well then why aren't we at least colonizing, building towns, etc. The players that love killing all the crazy beast things could continue being warriors and others could be doing other things. Isn't that kind of what was "advertised?" And oh Lordy, I want a NPC to have my back.
---
I had the same thing happen to me. Before the last update it would give me a warning. 
---
The trailer is for the whole road map thing I thought.. Didn't it show everything that's coming in the trailer? 
---
There was no one else near it either, I checked for that too. I THINK it's because of how close it is to the border of the map maybe? Still unsure
---
Man.  That would be awesome.  If we could form a society, with basic services and a justice system...
---
Heh, I can't see the game engine being able to cater for that, though.
---
HORDE EVENTS ARE GARBAGE 
---
You chase down enemies and then either someone snipes the last boss and steals the kill, or the boss is level 10 or 15, or the boss is glitched or you run into another random legendary and it glitches out the quest. 
---
It's a time and resource waster and it doesn't even gaurantee a leveled drop. 
---
There is definately something off with legendary enemies. Some heal some don't I can't figure out any patern.
---
I couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself.....well done ‚úÖ 
---
No, what I mean is that the borders for new nobuild zones might be acting like camp borders. If you and a friend build camps they can place a camp as close as possible to you, then when logging back in your camp will block their camp placement. Perhaps the new area issues is acting like this, a grey zone where you can place while online, but upon login the new area is blocking the camp placement
---
Completing the game would in my opinion more or less be getting all the achievements in the game. Just getting to level 50 isn‚Äôt special at all, that‚Äôs just when it will finally be fun with no level restrictions on guns and armor. But FULLY completing the game would literally mean doing everything.
---
According to the roadmap, the backpack will be the reward for completing the "Ever Upwards" questline. That will revolve around the Pioneer Scouts
---
Actually broken. But that‚Äôs not all the teleport away after is great for when they demolish your base and poof they are gone. Every thing about it is just broken there is zero balance. And worst yet it‚Äôs for an already over powered build/ play style.
---
I‚Äôve literally never had anything like that happen to me. It sucks it has happened to you but it‚Äôs not common enough to where I‚Äôve experienced it. Then again if someone takes a workshop I‚Äôve taken I usually just let them have it.
---
They've vastly lowered the budget turrets take, though.
---
Ya I watched the video doing more than 4k dmg it's absolute insane I didn't even know this was possible looks like I'll have to make a new character 
---
I can kill a SM with a normal Semi-auto handmade with less than 5 shots.  
---
Have you gotten four leaf clover to work since the last patch? I just started a new stealth/vats character and only have rank 1 so far. I've spent about 1000 rounds and only got it to refill once, I think. I'd hate to waste anymore points to rank it up all the way if it's broken.
---
A main part of my feedback to inside the vault jan 1 - This whole Suggestion hash tag / category
---
Containers
---
\- items to add utility and aesthetic to the inventory mechanics. 
---
I hoping the backpack illustrates a container for these purposes!
---
(Example of an item in the game that illustrates container purpose - the power armor frame or the existing suitcases / overseer caches / Drop item bag)
---
I want a dumpster to keep stuff so ppl could dive my discarded loot for useful finds.
---
I want a treasure chest to hide in a cool player's camp, to ensure what i am giving them gets to them
---
Many players have suggested letting us write notes and leave them. mario maker sort of has this function with both audio and basic text. this could be a container style situation, like we can make them but they are only viewed in the context of interacting with the container
---
Ah I see.   Don't team up much cept with RL friends.  I guess they dont want stealth builds to be in groups?
---
They showed snips of most things that are coming out, we know of atleast 3 weapons do to data mining and that melee was not one of them.   
---
The trailer also forgot the dates as this is s staggered release event. 
---
T51B has higher DR and equal ER to x01. 
---
Drives my OCD fucking crazy.
---
yeah, and camp visitors can get the beverage. making this contianer has a benefit of help distribute the good stuff. have a portable version we can set down for team endeavors. support build.
---
You on xbox by chance?
---
Sounds like lag to me. 
---
i did a fresh install, after uninstalling the entire game, and deleting all mods. New install, new folder, totally fresh. im still just falling through the ground over and over. I only came back to try the new content, but now i remember why i gave up on this game.
---
I get this all the time in Watoga, both on my alt and main. Alt has not finished mayor quest. They sometime spawn a 3*. I love fighting them. They can actually kill me. Game needs more scary stuff.
---
I need this to complete my nuka cola nut persona
---
No. PS4
---
There's tons of posts like the OP's, people are just to damn lazy and ask instead of taking 2 minutes to search. It's his own fault if he gets condescending responses. 
---
If anything the queen needs to be buffed. It is the "final boss", it should be hard. As others have pointed out the problem is noobs showing up not carrying their own weight.
---
If not there, the train station at watoga has them too. 
---
Yeah, those are not scrap mods. They used to be available at vendors occasionally, but not since patch 5. I've found a couple of ultra-light leather plans in world spawns recently, so that one might not be that uncommon. It's in the Savage Divide lists at least. Not sure about shadowed leather.
---
Any time you find an armor workbench, check nearby benches/boxes/tables for plans. In the Savage Divide there's one outside Blackwater mine, one inside (up top, where you get the key fragment), at least three around Pleasant Valley and one in the basement of Sunnytop Ski Resort. Unfortunately you won't see them if someone else got there first, so you may need to check a few times.
---
I can only imagine it will be nerfed so use it while you can lol
---
&gt; Then again if someone takes a workshop I‚Äôve taken I usually just let them have it.
---
You think im trying to contest them ? No, I never really use workshops, for me they only exist to reduce travel expenses. The problem is that someone can begin "contesting" it then fast travel to your location which is now marked as you are now a "legitimate pvp enemy" and kill you with his OP duped gear of shotguns that shoot 2 rounds at the same time of which all do area dmg which just one hits you no matter what. It breaks pacifism mode even if turned on and it doesnt matter if you are outside a workshop. In 2 days i had this happen 6 times to me. The alternative is not taking workshops but then i lose even more caps than from being griefed as the travel costs are insanely high, even with the perk that reduces them a bit. And dont propose putting down a CAMP on a spot in a region that i visit often. Had that once, due to those regions being visited by others as well it only ends in someone using an orbital strike on your house just to fuck with you because while pacifism mode protects you, it does not protect your house.
---
lol
---
Will do thanks 
---
I was laughing at a number of them. Even the statue reminded me of John Belushi's character. I was only 3 when it first came out, but I watched it on hbo or video for the first time about 85 or 86. It was about the first time I saw Porky's. 
---
Steel has always produced steel scrap.
---
Come on man, you know the complexity of those two things are radically different!  If we could make pots and plant flowers before the war, you know everyone would be happy and we would not be in the state its currently in!   
---
That's an odd numbr to pick. What's it in reference to?
---
In the game file, it seems  you will be able to craft a refrigerator backpack. Not sure what is its purpose, but it's possibly for food.
---
A house is just a PLace to keep your Stuff

---
I think this is a glitch but spawns in the white spring nuke zone seem to be jacked up I just nuked whitespring went into the golf club immediately no ghouls I‚Äôm still waiting for them to spawn in there gone in and out several times, enemy‚Äôs are spawning everywhere else besides the radroach in the basement of the golf club. I have had several people going in and out around me meanwhile, this happened to me earlier today as well except eventually they spawned, after a long time, confusing.... so I figured I would report this, I‚Äôm on ps4.
---
Can't you speed it up like in the quest, or was that a one time only thing to make the quest go by faster?
---
I noticed both behaviours myself.
---
The CTDs really caught me off-guard; in my experience the game stability had consistently improved since patch 5, more so since patch 6.
---
The ludicrously long render times for CAMPs, this is a new one. Near distance LOD also seemed to be suffering.
---
All in all the general 'responsiveness' of the server felt pre-patch 5.
---
The server did go on maintenance towards the end of my playing session so I thought nothing of it until popping in reddit this morning where reports of previously unseen behaviour related to 'timing' and returning instability seem to be cropping up.
---
'Dailies' also were unusually 'standoffish' for me. I managed to trigger one that I had not done for a while: Target Rich Environment but that was it.
---
Timing in general, eating and drinking like crazy now, nuke wait timer, daily quests not triggering all that fun stuff.
---
I‚Äôd get rid of the three points for solar powered and add it to luck for max rank one gun army. you will need max stager chance for optimal pvp if you get hit once your dead your only hope is to stun lock them 
---
The latest patch introduced a little content but must have doubled the bug count.   
---
Also, why did Bethesda take out item preview during transactions?
---
Showing locked plans would be great even if it did nothing to specify how to get them. It'd be nice to know you've learned every mod for a specific gun or armor. To know what all the possible mods are. 
---
Had what seemed like a complete server crash on PS4 yesterday. Launched on prime, killed the SBQ. Launched on prime again. Before the nuke landed all three on my team were disconnected simultaneously. 
---
Wow real nice. Dude just got a new job, everything was lookin up, and you murdered him. 
---
lol nice
---
Yes PLEASE! I made a beautiful new base with all this nice vanity and stuff and I cant even save it all! It bummed me out a lot.
---
I've no yet figured out how to get the mission to launch again. Supposedly a daily, where you can get more recipes, but darned if I can figure out how. Talk to biv, he just rambles drunkenly. Poke at a poster? No effect.  
---
I did the FIRST quest, to create Nukashine, but since then? Nothing seems to trigger a new one.  
---
Hrm.
---
WOW....I was looking forward to grinding out the new paintjob.  Now that I've seen the difference is a couple red pixels I'll save myself the misery.  Thanks.
---
Ah! I've noticed all the descriptions are  inconsistent anyway, so that probably doesn't indicate anything
---
The event tea time at the giant teapot is good, a couple usually spawn in that.
---
Run a connector switch to a power pylon, then run connections from there. Worked for me.
---
Vault \[Redacted\]
---
I had the same issue when I did that the last time. I solved it by selecting one of the power connectors and putting it back down. After that it worked.
---
Geez, I thought it was just me. Noticed yesterday and today my food and water going down WAAAAYYY too fast. :/
---
Thanks!
---
Huh. Maybe. I had the problem before the patch too though. We'll see what Bethesda has to say, I haven't received a reaponse yet. I have faith in them.
---
It sounds like him, but its not listed on imdb yet. 
---
Me too lol
---
Yeah- maybe like an environmental effect from eating it, kinda like nukashine :). But with sparkles &amp; fireworks
---
Maybe l'll flll my camp with radios and annoy the hell out of my mole rats.
---
Hahaha hahaha you're funny
---
I already grew up in Al-Ateen with an alcoholic father, so I'll pass. 
---
I never equipped "Can DO" or any food perks.  Just grow corn.
---
Can make corn soup all day long.  Restores thirst and food.  Then just carry around waters for the extra thirst.
---
XB1 here. Found it in a duffle bag, pleasant valley ski resort. 
---
I thought the survival mode on FO4 worked well.
---
Thanks man!
---
That's that. I need to make an alt character then.  I want that costume.
---
It always comes on whenever I fast travel to Lewisberg.
---
I‚Äôd love to get that whole ‚Äògrass rustling in the wind‚Äô aesthetic in my Camp, but it works out looking hideous most of the time. 
---
We NEED this!!
---
A semi automatic handmade that I have does 82 damage compared to my Legendary Furious Laser Rifles 61.
---
Both of them share the same perks, but the difference is on top of a higher base DPS, the handmade also has perks that let them pierce through enemy resistances, has ballistics perks that more universally translate to more reliable weaponry, and doesn't turn mobs you kill into ash piles that you can't loot.
---
You could almost double the damage from most of the energy weapons and they still wouldn't be particularly overpowered. My plasma rifle with all rifle damage perks does like 40 damage for both ballistics and energy, and then when you run that through damage resistances most enemies have, I get better damage output with a unmodded regular lead pipe.
---
Thanks. This seems to have jump started the power box lol
---
Yes.  It bothers me.  I try to plant in in weedy terrain so it's not as noticeable.
---
I was able to it at harpers ferry, thank you tho!! I'll keep that in mind for when my buddies want one
---
You people are the worst.  Wanting imortality in a SURVIVAL game.  Go back to single player if you can't handle human behavior.  
---
It's for making white russians. 
---
A few others have suggested this and I really want it in the game, a general exchange would dramatically improve my game-play experience. Other players recommended putting it in Whitesprings as currently its where most of the players are naturally buying and selling items between the two factions. Also its "sorta" in the center of the map. I love the idea of Vault 76 as its a free fast travel location and "returning to the vault" to buy/sell on the exchange would be a great place to meet and help new or returning players.
---
What kind of build are you going for on your PA? I‚Äôd get reactive plates for sure. So if they do get a hit on you they kill themselves but that only works on melee. I think that will be the most popular anyways though.  I‚Äôd rock t51b for the highest DR also. And sensory relay for your helmet to mark enemies. As it will mark them with a blip even if they crouch or use a stealth boy
---
I used to run the excavator, but i feels like wearing rice-paper compared to the t51b I have now. 
---
I‚Äôm on PC and I‚Äôm fairly certain I have quantum plans.
---
I‚Äôm not sure plasma grenade plans actually exist.
---
Yep, most areas I visit are covered when I do this, and I rarely need to go to the SW or NE corners, so it doesn't take heaps to do.
---
That's a waste of 3 endurance points for very little benefit. 
---
But only if you get it from the Port-a-Diner.
---
Also at a second look I‚Äôd try and get bullet shield every last bit of DR helps. You will be in pvp mode so no point in carrying a lot of stuff that will just drop anyways chems junk food ect. So any weight reduce perk id get rid up for more damage and more defense as that‚Äôs the sole purpose of PvP 
---
I agree, it does need more "Flavor".
---
* finger guns *
---
I've picked up a few in the last couple days, since patch 7 even. 2 shot is rare, but not that rare. 
---
Looks like it is mislabeled. It is actually ‚ÄúElectric signal carrier antennae‚Äù: Hold fire to charge additional electrical damage. Adds 42 electric damage for me, no pistol perks. 
---
The game crashed 4X yesterday and about 3x today. Usually doing something simple like picking a lock.
---
So to me it is less stable than previous patch. I'm not expecting good results the next SBQ event I do. I'm PC.
---
The map's in the right ballpark but a bit off. The most obvious part is that Whitesprings is unlimited, and probably part of the Savage Divide section. Also the area around Monongah, although hardly anyone goes there anyway.
---
There's also an unlimited area around the Rusty Pick and the Firebreathers final exam for some reason.
---
Was after patch, now 4 dc in 1h 
---
Happened to me yesterday. Killed a 3*; no loot. 
---
Batteries included.
---
That's about as far as anything good specifically for energy weapons go.
---
Use energy weapons for role play, otherwise as I'm sure you've found, you'd be actually better off hitting enemies with your bare hands.
---
Idk if you did it for the screenshot but running the game in windowed mode caps your fps to like 35
---
Man, it is hard to decide on PA build, prolly X-01 
---
    -Head: Targeting Hud - Visor highlights living targets.
---
    -Torso: Jetpack, or Reactive plates, or Stealth boy, or Medic pump 
---
    -Arms: Doesn't really matter, but iI guess Hydraulic Bracers for a quick counter on Melee 
---
    -Legs: Explosive Vent, or Calibrated Shocks, or Overdrive servos
---
Where are you trying to build?
---
Hardly a waste when I always have food ready to eat at any given time. How many times do you scrounge for food? Also my build caters for max strength max Agility 11 endurance. Sitting at 500 resists although rad resist is low, however I survive the SBQ ok.
---
I love Biv and he instantly reminded me of a ‚Äúsober‚Äù Bender but unfortunately it‚Äôs not John DiMaggio voicing him. They asked Bethesda Austin who voiced Biv on the livestream today. [You can check that out here. ](https://m.twitch.tv/videos/395430233) They ask at about 33:45. Sounds like someone named Theo Caplin (?) voiced Biv. He def slayed it tho. I love Biv and hearing all his crazy dialogue, lol. 
---
Yes. There's a farm that starts with an A northish of the vault. like arnholt or something. 
---
No, it's the annual April fools thing that Game Informer does, and OP is an idiot. 
---
This post is awesome.  Great lore connection.
---
You did, with your tired references. 
---
I've had a little lag and one crash since Tuesday. But besides that, all good. Hate that others are having issues.
---
Update version (no QOS): https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f394a5a&amp;d=s32sr2sq2pe2er1eo2c72ic4lu2lt2l20ls2a04eh2eu0ip2ih1sg2s82&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
Are you sure they're not in your stored tab? Crops and purifiers don't get blueprinted but get stored instead, as placing them is terrain dependent. 
---
Same here. I was happy that someone launched a nuke for SBQ. Went to my CAMP, getting ready for a long fight, fixing my stuffs, and... the bomb countdown dropped....... DISCONNECTED from server. lol tbh I feel so bad to the guy who launched the nuke.
---
&gt; what do you mean it‚Äôs not his thing? 
---
What's there to mean by simple thing like that. Other players don't judge if someone cheats or not. They may suspect. They may think someone does. They can be absolutely certain.
---
They DON'T make the call.
---
&gt;If the player was lower lvl I might understand your point but not with the amount of hours it takes to get to lvl 127.
---
What you had or didn't, is irrelevant. Are you claiming, ooh, you got assassin sentinel therefore you can't cheat? Bullshit.
---
Look, the player reporting doesn't work with assuming that players are experts on knowing who is cheating or not.
---
Sorry I should have added that I want as far from the vault as possible, but I'll keep the Arnholdt place in mind thanks man
---
That would also be a neat way of making drinks more effective by cooling them.
---
Yeah it's nice there. Got a power armor spawn, loot, other veggies in the area, a junk node. It's nice. I feel the decent ones are near the vault. The only other that comes to mind is near overseer camp. 
---
Good luck! 
---
The bugs are the buggiest
---
The crashes are the crashiest
---
Way back home
---
slow clap
---
Do you know what locations it spawns at?
---
Happened to ne last night but the issue fixed itself after two hours.
---
Seeing as useful guides for info tend to get ignored, yes.
---
Vintage Nukashine gives Agi. I knew that.
---
Ok then so I need to do Biv quests.
---
I cannot see the Pi (Œ†) in your photo? It should be after the Œümicron (O). ...M,N,Œû,Œü,Œ†,Œ°,Œ£,Œ§...
---
I agree this must be annoying (never personally experienced it though, in 220 hours)... But what about when some dick sets up a turret base behind Whitespring then goes pacifist? The no build zone there needs increasing before this can happen. 
---
Got CTD lockpicking as well.
---
Bro i feel you its the same situation for me too. I really enjoy playing the game but it gets difficult and boring playing solo I wish I had a team or even an NPC companion
---
In any game you'll see a "shock" to the economy after an update. It'll even out over time as prices set in and behavior adjusts to the updates. It's human behavior really. 
---
A friend has the issue. Ran the whole silo and couldn't launch. My alt waltzed down, put in a card and code, then dropped it on Prime. Shortly thereafter I was able to run Alpha and launch again with my alt. 
---
My guess is the bug is targeting characters who launch frequently.  These were my first two with that character.  Didn't try on my main. 
---
Fun quest. Glad WVU got some attention, especially with the whole frat row. 
---
The air left my nose faster than usual. Take my updoot.
---
Fishing poles, lines, and hooks would have to be expensive so you can't just get infinite fish.
---
Thank you for the heads-up! It is much appreciated when someone does this and potentially saves people a lot of grief!
---
tried multiple weapons - I dont think its weapon specific - even mob dropped ones
---
anyway

---
Whoa are you me? I just made a post about this. There's a few good ones in the Forest, but really you could try any area marked homestead. I'm just looking for some tilled land for crop rows. In the Bog there is at least two farms though they spawn enemies. Maybe in the Mire too but that land seems too broken up
---
Oh and it does work in 3rd person mode not 1st person mode just found that out
---
Happened to me last night on PS4. Tried server hopping, but no go. Weird.
---
Can you explain a bit?
---
Does regular nukashine have blackout properties as well, or is it just vintage?
---
&gt;This would be an EXCELLENT spot to nuke.
---
Would that even work if it's underground?
---
His dialogue is pretty hysterical.  The voice actor did some top notch work, especially with the constant hiccups.
---
I would still avoid them, I don't hardly pick up 1s and 2s anymore. Guess it would be good for lower level people? I definitely agree Scorchbeasts should be able to spawn as legends, even 3s
---
No. I checked. Everything was in the stored tab except of the items I mentioned above.
---
ya got me
---
For what it's worth, the party seems lame. No one invited me anyways. 
---
PS: I'm funny. 
---
Real, live West Virginian and WVU grad here! Frat Row is a real location where most of the big fraternities have their houses. We used to be consistently be rated the "#1 party school in the U.S." during the time I was a student there. It has been heavily policed in the past few years and that title has been pretty much been destroyed, but I remember it in it's heyday. It was a thing of beauty, like Mardi Gras every weekend. I like the nod to a forgotten yet glorious era. Bethesda, you took me back!
---
Gamma is affected by pistol perks, cryolator by heavy perks, and others by rifle perks. 
---
Same. Just swing again. 
---
I want to Fishing, please.
---
Lots.  I want to fishing, lots.
---
Please.
---
Irl I just mastered the art of vodka in a soda stream. So I'm with it. 
---
I moved my camp since every alcohol takes 2 or 3 boiled water.  Now I'm on a pond, and I wish I could Fishing off my dock.
---
Dragons over Scorchbeast any day!! 
---
This puzzle is pretty well done.
---
Happy to hunt around for clues to this vs doing the brew quest.
---
How much do you want to know to proceed?  I don't really know how much to tell you w/o spoiling the surprise.
---
I got a daily for the recipes after I was disconnected once.  I went back into the building, talked to Biv, and he just gave me a quest to make Tick Blood Tequila.  Haven't been able to reproduce the effect, but I've only re-logged a handful of times trying.
---
The only modifiers that can‚Äôt spawn on certain items are secondary and third effects on wood armor, and the explosive modifier on energy guns, which stopped spawning after the TSE nerf.
---
Falling through floor..
---
Should I come back..
---
Is xyz released yet? 
---
Whitespring fake etiquette
---
Something something workshop pvp..
---
Legendaries don't drop as much
---
What's wrong with nuking?
---
Is mno released 
---

---
Condition doesn't effect damage on ranged weapons. 
---
You gotta shot em in the head!
---
Saw them last night in the Ash Heap. Chuckled at Vlad's thinly veiled attempts at flirting with Mia and Mia replying with her intent to kill everyone. 
---
&lt;shrug&gt; Its a PVP location.   I quit doing them long ago because you can get 1 shot when away from it.
---
I mean jeah if I remember correct that's exactly what they wrote in the patch notes a couple weeks ago.
---
Nothing special 
---
This. You can go farm them by hanging out in high rad areas, but you're likely to get one you don't want on top of the ones you do. 
---
I second that emotion.
---
It could be the supervisor's miner gear itself that the system identifies, not the person inside it. I think it's unlikely that they are babies but that would make them sooo much creepier. I mean, how would babies survive on their own in the ash heap
---
Lol I laughed when I smashed Mia and Vlad just went wild and charged at me
---
I noticed that armor seems pointless in pvp. I had z lvl 23 nearly kill me with two shots. And i am lvl 156
---
It‚Äôs not a bad spot 
---
That was probably a griefer duo, they use the low level as bait and a high level kills you, as when you attack the low level the high level is in PvP with you as they are on the same team.
---
Lol. Melee has been OP since beta. If they're gonna nerf it, I think they'd have done it by now. 
---
Everything seems to be ant armor. Thanks for making me feel less like a complete toss pot for dieing so fast
---
PC.
---
When i looked back at last week(weekend included) I experienced 2 crashed in 5 hours of play and that was pre-patch.
---
Since the new update I did not experience any crashes so far.
---
The prizebot literally comes at the worst time while I'm getting attacked and close to be being over the weight limit and always puts me over it. I think it's a troll bot 
---
Yeah doesnt matter how much armor perks you have it seems pointless
---
Yeah wtf you don't smash other people's girlfriends of course they'll get mad.
---
But unless they've fixed it, buffs to damage on the Gamma Gun only effect the ballistic damage component, not the rad damage. 
---
I also have the same mutation! I could definitely see how the two are correlated. 
---
Fertile soil Event in Flatwoods - I've been forced to play from the scratch and yesterday I've started new character - done the quest twice and got 2 ultralight leather plans (chest and limbs I think, but not 100% sure).
---
I do not know why but Bethesda has an issue with working fridges.
---
The last working fridge that a player could use in the Fallout series was in FO3.
---
The working fridges in FO4 come from mods.
---
But yeah i would be pretty cool to get some ice cold nuka cola
---
Yep. Had it happen with a 3* hermit crab over in the mire. 
---
Just trying to find a nice farm üòÅ l saw a video about a nice spot in the forrest but cant find it anymore
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
so can i not do it yet? 
---
Predicting it before watching, Skyrim memes
---
I didnt see a ring on that finger. He was fine after, I smashed him next, he couldn't walk after that ;)
---
Ah... Roger that
---
Only perks are extra carry weight.. Added strength (me thinks) and environmental protection along with PA mods
---
i know ive seen it between watoga and fort defiance, and ive seen it across the street from the overseers. 
---
my is asking me to drink fresh bourbon and then craft something but whatever i craft nothing happening ;/
---
On the side of the street or kinda in the middle of  nowhere?
---
Very high DR, mods like the jetpack as well as fall damage immunity. Carry weight legs mods. Double ore harvesting with excavator set is nice also. Those are what make me sit in in 24/7. The other things mentioned are nice as well, like the environmental protection and hud mods are super convenient
---
nah like literally across the street, like if youre at the overseers, looking at the bridge over the creek, itll be a little to the left. i have a picture at that location haha
---
Hmm...change to instigating DC gauntlet or moleman gauntlet, you get to one shot super mutants.
---
they reworked energy weapons, maybe the gauss was affected for some reason?
---
Power armor makes you incredibly tanky, vastly ups your carry weight (especially if you have calibrated shocks), but you move slower and you're far easier to detect by enemies. Great for melee builds, and there's perk cards available to enhance builds for heavy weapons.
---
Non-power armor builds make you more vulnerable (depending on your armor), but greatly increase your stealthiness, allowing for better crits and high chances for sneak attack damage. Plus you get the benefits of legendary armor mods which power armor does not afford.
---
So it really depends on the kind of build you want to play. Melee and heavy weapons? Power armor is the way to go. Ranged, stealthy commando, and sniper types? You don't need power armor.
---
Same thing goes for my bloodied melees. Lost around 200 dmg as well. 
---
Build a 1x3 or 2x3 first floor, with 2 door ways and the rest walled off. Add some stairs and make a second floor however large you want.  Then go to the ground floor and build walls going down from the second floor.  You can place a door(locked) leading to the walled off ground, or you can leave it doorless.
---
This is what I do when farming crops and water for one character.  Also, if you build turrets don't.  The only mob to attack any of my camps in the weeks since I stopped using turrets, was a Super Mutant that chased another player to my camp, from a nearby location.
---
I thought so at first , but I thought the patch stated energy weapons were getting a damage buff , not nerf lol
---
Adrenal Reaction‚Äôs damage increase tops out at 20% health now and they shaved 15% damage off the top of the 20% health Adrenal bonus. Hope that helps!
---
I got this [combat rifle](https://imgur.com/7cXTTsp) completing a mirelurk horde in the mire, inside Camp Venture.  Not that I'm complaining, it's just that the area doesn't necessarily mean you'll get top level gear.
---
How do blackouts work? You can just get one whilst drinking it and teleport somewhere random?
---
I thought these drinks were going to be buffs against scorchbeast but this would make it seem otherwise
---
Oh okay thank you ! That makes sense now ! 
---
I can't see how is it too much? It's finally usable and not so op, 50cal and handmade are stronger.
---
I had this problem in the February patch along with getting diseases any time I came in contact with an enemy. 
---
I spent hours building my CAMP and had the Slow Metabolizer and Thirst Quencher perks to bump up food and water benefits, Vaccinated and in PA to prevent getting diseases, and the Happy Camper perk that slows down hunger and thirst in a CAMP. 
---
Every enemy I fought in a 4 hour period around my CAMP was diseased and had a 100% infection rate. I caught 10 diseases and used all 10 of my antibiotics. 
---
I also had to eat every 8-10 minutes which was the baseline, had to drink even more when I took antibiotics. I usually have tons of extra water and sell it off to vendors but suddenly barely had enough to get by since I needed to drink water pretty much every 5 minutes. 
---
I haven‚Äôt really played the new update because an hour into building my new CAMP I had a bug screw up my base building and had to restart. 
---
Our builds are still great but I did the same thing when I logged in. Freaked me out. I re logged a bunch and ran the numbers on a few characters to make sure that was correct.
---
It's still not an exploit. A duplication glitch is an exploit, a way to get out of the playable area is an exploit, things that are not working the way they should, and people taking advantage of them is an exploit.
---
Someone finding a broken a overpowered build isn't an exploit, it's bad balancing. Yes, it should be patched, I'm not arguing it shouldn't be, my arguement is about semantics, and you're using the word exploit wrong and it is therefore misinformation.
---
I have the medic pump mod on my torso which gives me a stimpack at low health, it‚Äôs handy because then you don‚Äôt need born survivor perk and can spend the points on something else
---
Sounds like the next whitesprings
---
Thanks. One reason I've avoided using power armour is playing in the view from within the armour. I much prefer the normal view.
---
I felt like that for the first 10 hours or so. However once you start to level up, and actually start engaging in the story a bit, coming across more enemies too, that feeling of loneliness goes away to a large extent.
---
I still get it from time to time, I‚Äôm only level 20 and have only just made it to whitesprings. But listening to the tapes has really brought the world to life like I didn‚Äôt expect it to.
---
What level are you out of interest?
---
Just sucks though cause I loved that crazy damage output for queen killing ! I might switch back to melee now lol
---
You might appreciate a very good lowbie weapon when legendary prestige happens.  Even something like this [meat hook](https://imgur.com/IxQgCv3) is going to be very nice to have at lvl 5.
---
Instructions misunderstood. Ugly "HD" texture implemented with bikini mods. 
---
I still can't believe it
---
This whole game sucks. Eadily the worst ive ever played. Especially a fallout game from a die hard fallout fan.  How can 40 level one shot 120 plus level in power armor. I was set up to farm. Still no way should i be anle to b one shotted from such a low level and i was on passive so never expected it. I can go on all day about how ctappy this game is and less than 30 seconds with anything good starting with this pre order bullshit to get your money for a product still not ready for release.  Its been enough to break me from gaming and im from way before pong lol. Destiny 2 now this crap. It ll take a miracle game to bring me bavk and that includes the vr i expected more games for in shooter style. It just keeps getting worse instead of better. People we buy the products. We do have some control on how we let this continue to play out.
---
Happened to me too! I thought I was going insane!
---
I was mostly a power armor user until late game, then switched over. I find myself enjoying the game far more, doing far more damage over time now that I've gone a stealthier route. It's a lot easier to manage if you have the deep-pocketed armor mods (or know someone who does)I save my power armor for nuke zones, and swap out my cards to heavy weapons for the queen.
---
They didnt block before last batch at all.Now its allmost annoying
---
It seems to always be some maniac dressed in a clown suit or swimsuit with a power fist for me these days.  When I try to defend, they just one-shot me in VATS.  It's depressing.  Lately I've been preemptively server hopping if I see anyone on the map with a bounty over 10 caps.  I don't want to have to go through the agony of repairing crops, bringing my brahmin back to life and using flux to repair my rad shower.
---
the goofy theme that we get now is only for the new crafting and limited quest event next week.
---
I think we are far away from an Borderlands style game.
---
Those wacky things were always in the fallout games. Look at FO3 at a certain point of the main quest you enter an virtual neighborhood with some wacky music. 
---
You have them in new vegas and in FO4.
---
Nothing unusual :)
---
I'd really like the Dumpster change for my Cannibal; it'd add some flavor to the character by letting me store human bones in the Dumpster.
---
Some of the missions are way too wacky/silly. 
---
The one at Bolton Greens, which was super bugged and couldn‚Äôt be completed, was about throwing a party for a bunch of kids. 
---
Or Rosie who is kinda just Claptrap for Fallout.  
---
A lot of the darkness from the previous games has been replaced and it‚Äôs sad. 
---
I *think* I get what you're saying, but...  Let's be real. Fallout has *always* been quirky.

These alone are just from Fallout (1).
---
I could go on.  Tranquility Lane, Harold, pretty much *all* of Big MT, Andale, the Those! quest, any dialogue in previous games with a really low INT stat...  Quirky, goofy, black humor fun has always had a place in Fallout.
---
yup, and if you notice, people smoking cigs irl tend to repel bugs when doing so, it's because the nicotine infused smoke is actually lethal to most small insects at those levels so the insect go 'hang on, I still need to procreate so I can't die yet'
---
I was about to create a post for the same reason. All the 3 daily quests for getting Fuzzy tokens in Camden Park are gone. I can't trigger them since last patch. Me too I used to get there daily to get tokens for the costume. I know I could buy it off from someone, but that's the easy way. I want to work for it.
---
Well thanks dude, I do expand this slightly every now and then when ideas hit, but yeah.
---
I know most of this likely won't be implimented outside modding, but an overhaul on farming, is honestly needed in my opinion
---
Doesn‚Äôt even trigger when I fast travel to Camden park, since the update.
---
I stopped playing after cheaters killed me took my junk and leveled my camp for the 3rd time. Too much grinding
---
Would be better with the "Why Are You Closed!!!!" Guy yelling
---
I'm lvl 25. Don't have a group but I'll roll with you

Oh nice, send me a pm if you can sell one to me! :)
---
Mariachis use bass guitars?  The ones I've met use normal (spanish type) aucustic guitar or [guitarrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitarr%C3%B3n_mexicano).
---
Also the tuba is not strident enough to pierce your eardrums while you are trying to eat until you give them $10 to go away.
---
I'm on PC. Had several CTDs last night which I haven't seen for for a while. Also after loading into a server there's a weird delay where everything isn't full loaded. The map is empty and I can't go inside any interior buildings.
---
You made me curious so after I commented I went out to mine it at workshops to see how it would go. 
---
3 oil resources and 3 acid resources running at once at Beckley Mine and Hemlock Holes got me about 400 ammo (with 3*SuperDuper and 2*Ammosmith) in a ... while maybe a few hours trying not to forget to harvest them. 
---
It‚Äôs was time consuming. The cyrolator ammo crafts 25 per unit, fuel seems like it should be similar, not 5. 
---
Well, I picked up a lvl50 vampire flamer by luck so maybe I‚Äôll see how far 2100 fuel goes. 
---
Not far I expect, and I‚Äôve been saving all of it I‚Äôve found for several months. 
---
No npc's no real story.  Not complaining but you need to make the game interesting somehow.
---
friend of mine has encountered this bot
---
If you're on PC, I'm on a lot and don't mind tagging along on your quests to help keep you alive.  Yeah, I'm a pretty high level, but as long as you can tag the mobs with a gun, I can flatten them for you and you'll get the exp you need to get out of your 20's and upwards to better things.
---
no
---
Who told these Vaulties to use caps as money? These are the mysteries of the Wasteland. 
---
[This](http://imgur.com/gallery/9HlYXwV) is the album I made when I found it yesterday. The inside is completely empty, unlike the other vaults which are semi usable.
---
ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
The max damage bonus used to be 50% @ 20% health prior to P6.  Are you saying it's 35% now?  Because SeventySix.esm doesn't agree with that.
---
before last patch they fixed, wasn't getting any disconnections even after 7-8 hrs in the same server. After patch, well, it seems we are back to the beginning. Very unstable for me.
---
Lots of players reported unaccessible characters, they get disconnected as soon as they jump in a new world. In my opinion, there's big issues with camps, especially on camps which have been moved after patch (forced by the game).
---
Me, for example, had to move my camp. But I wasn't able to place my blueprint. SO I had to rebuild from zero. That's when i started having disconnections. Funny thing is that it took me 2hrs to build, got disconnected only once, then it was okay. as soon as I finished and started using my workbenches everything crashed. Server disconnections after 30 sec after logging in. 
---
Yesterday night instead, it was a bit better. I've been able to play for 1h straight with no disconnections.
---
Not only that but the guitar by the stairs was a nice touch.
---
Maybe they visited some frats for....um......research. üòú
---
Another location is in the water channels under the giant pink trees in the Cranberry bog.
---
Hooks could have a durability so after a certain amount of casts, they break and need to be replaced. Fish could be used for new recipes too.
---
Has anyone been able to get Biv to give a daily?
---
I ran into this guy yesterday! I accidentally hit him while I was in a firefight so I never got to be insulted but I can't wait to find it again. Reminds me of Prize Bot. I might be alone in this but I love the robot NPCs. People are overrated.
---
Cheaper my ass, quantum is scarce, and brewing takes time and resources, I'm selling my shine for 50 caps a pop, with everything else being a reasonable 5 caps a beer, 10 for wine, and 15 for any other hard liquors. 
---
Yep. Inflation is a real bitch. 
---
$1 In 1961 (58 years ago) would be worth roughly $8.50 now accounting for inflation.  By 2077 (58 years from now) a $3 cup of coffee, following this historical trend, would be $25.50. 
---
This ignores the fact that inflation would have taken off like crazy towards the end days as war loomed and resources became scarce. 
---
I enjoyed my experience, but I'm left wondering if I'll ever be able to take psychedelics.
---
Only thing is that, Nuka Cola has no expiration date. 
---
Same here just no longer works!
---
not true..since the update im killing lvl.68 scorched with one shot with my tse laser rifle
---
I ran my own numbers bud. I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. I lost 150 dmg at 20% with everything being the same as before the patch. After crunching the numbers, I lost 15% of my damage and Adrenal seems to be the only rebalance that would effect the bloodied build. 
---
When did you last check the esm? Can you find what was changed to make my max damage and everyone else‚Äôs reduce by roughly 15%?
---
You can do that with upcoming vendors machines. Fill it up with 0 or 1 caps and you got it.
---
According to the note you get off him, he's supposed to observe you for awhile before insulting you.  If I see him again, I'll see if he'll insult me after waiting, if not, he's probably broken.
---
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a reference but it will open the door. 
---
I check the ESM after every patch.  The damage curve is back to what it was pre-P6.  20% health is 50% damage bonus.  It's possible there's some other damage cap that Bethesda has applied and not told us, but Adrenal Reaction itself isn't capped.
---
yes I did bitch
---
Well i gotta wait till a patch i guess... Hopegully soon!!!
---
Maybe in addition to a bounty, they should reduce carrying capacity due to the crushing weight of their guilt.  That would be a more meaningful repercussion for this sort of behaviour. 
---
but it's not rare. 
---
The timing in the game seems to be broken in general. 
---
Not only does food spoil way too fast there are also issues with daily quests not firing at all and cleared locations not respawning the mobs for an unusual long time. I usually run Whitespring, Generals Steakhouse and West-Tek. By the time I would return to the Whitespring the mobs would respawn. This is no longer the case. I fast travelled around for a bit and went to previously cleared places, none had respawned. 
---
This is most likely also the reason why nukes have triple digit cooldowns now.
---
Glad your back.  Happy hunting :)
---
My friend had no problems launching a nuke a couple hours ago on PS4
---
I put my plants on fire. 3 of them a time. I can even plant them inside a buildig this way. It just works. 
---
I've only played 20 minutes since the patch, but i ran to an Event which didn't trigger too. I had to view the map and actually click on the Event to Join it. Pretty sure that change isn't what Bethesda intended to do.
---
Yea that was their reason but I'm only carrying like 400 pounds of items XD
---
What‚Äôs your friends level? 
---
I live on top of an ore deposit. I have the extractor in my basement.
---
I have signs on my camp though inviting people in though so they will get 10 acid instead of 2 or 3 when they come by.
---
another thing: stop the possibility to farm caps from workshop-pvp
---
\[PC\] There is possibility that they are hidden for you. I looked like crazy in all known locations and didn't see any. Then randomly looking at ground in Cranberry Bog it prompted me dialog, while there was nothing on the ground.
---
All I‚Äôm saying is if you‚Äôre beat in PvP then your first response shouldn‚Äôt be to report someone. The time it takes you to report you could do a google search for OP builds in fallout 76 and learn about Assasins sentinel gear. He did some damage to me so it‚Äôs not like my health was 100% the whole time.
---
I never lobbied against reporting, just don‚Äôt want people to abuse it. I honestly don‚Äôt know any way to cheat in this game besides duping so I don‚Äôt even know what you‚Äôre going on about. I think this is a discussion worth having, and I‚Äôm glad some people contributed knowledge about how the reporting system works instead of just being confrontational like you right off the bat.
---
This is my first MMORPG and it‚Äôs not always easy to find info on how Bethesda does things. Thanks to the people who contributed and let me know certain things instead of having your attitude. 
---
I planted in the spare patch of ground next to my camp last night now we've got the brewing. The corn looks fine but the razorgrain looks terrible.
---
I may have overdone it though as I've run out of budget now and I still have to decorate my camp. Took me ages to get the conduits right but I'm seriously considering downsizing the main building a bit.
---
Have fun playing again! Hope you wont get banned again oh and also filthy liar 
---
Yeah the cop robot hasn't given me a quest since the update.
---
That can 100% be solved just by extending the no camp zone there 
---
Try game's release date.
---
Still hoping for enemies in Power Armour.
---
Dont ever again compare that filthy raider slut to mah boy claptrap 
---
Thanks! 
---
Holy crap no one cares.... Seriously. We can't prove if you really did and you can't prove you didn't. What's the point of this kind of post ??
---
I had 3 of these pieces and my AA handmade drop, I traded other godroll melee weapons for the other 2 pieces. They‚Äôre all mismatched armor and none of them are marine armor which I know were the most duped Ass/Sent set. 
---
It sucks they didn‚Äôt design the game to where each item had an identifier so they could‚Äôve just wiped all the duped ones. I can‚Äôt say for certain 2 of my Ass/Sent pieces aren‚Äôt duped, I doubt it tho tbh because I got them from people I know and trust irl. 
---
At the end of the day I worked hard for my build and Idc if I get reported just wanted to discuss it with others and see what their experience has been thus far. Thanks for reading!
---
Crops with appearance variants can be scrolled through by moving right while having them selected. 
---
It's really just that they made a bunch of bad decisions about pvp. Yes there are perks that encourage wrecking camps, but that doesn't get around the fact there's still no purpose to doing it in the first place, aside from harassment. So basically all camp wrecking is griefing. 
---
Oh good, I‚Äôll be able to sleep again tonight. 
---
Going to downvote just because Fallout 76 is know for losing half of FPS because of non-fullscreen mode since day 1 and you managed to fail at checking this at the first place.. -.- this topic is as pointles as discussion around it.
---
Can confirm, got the same issue on my main now...
---
Support replied with this:
---
"We are investigating an issue where some characters may become inaccessible if you remove fermenting items from your stash box after relocating your C.A.M.P"
---
I did not relocate my camp, and did not move any booze out my stash, so it looks like i have the same source of the problem you had. No ETA on fix.
---
/u/Ladydevann ticket #190315-000304
---
If on PS4, there were some individuals yesterday who were going around with their PVP builds and contesting every workshop, destroying everything they could before they claimed it, then jumping servers.  They aren't even doing it for resources and they are mainly targeting low level players.
---
Thank you! 
---
They should do it yeah, but I don't think it should be a hard block to fixing camp griefers. 
---
Yes that is exactly what I thought. Nice stretch though.
---
It's annoying but you can just store the rad shower when you aren't using it, so it won't get wrecked 
---
174, give or take
---
Same here. Thought it was just my game.
---
to tell people to check to see if they can play? Bethesda havent sent out emails.
---
Nukashine is different. It buffs unarmed attacks, until you black out 5 minutes later. When you "come to" you're at some random spot on the map; not too random though, I blacked out twice, watched Oxhorn in a live stream, and rifle gaming each do it, and both times I did it, I wound up the same places as they did
---
I think much of this is unsubstantiated. The nuke cool down thing is attributed wrong. A friend of mine had a cool down of 270 hours, so I went into the silo and launched for him. If it's a matter of whether that server was launched on, then why could I launch?
---
In any case, I feel like we're trying to see a pattern where there may not be one. Every patch it seems like people complain about how fast thirst/hunger accumulates, or carry weight, or some other mechanic. None of these claims are substantiated and it's really hard to determine what the real problems are
---
What area was the event in that triggered your little adventure?
---
Yes. A serum is just a mutation that you can buy. Mutations can be cured/taken away with Rad Away. 
---
There was a "challenge" for trading an item with a players. 20 atoms. Gj denying.
---
Gouls inside fort defience are bad ab that spawns them where they were laying down at and makes them inaccessible. Id come accross 1 or 2 legendaries there, itd drive me nuts when they just disappear as im looting them
---
Yeah. I've seen the loot window literally vanish while I'm looting gear before, and wanted to scream.
---
Because people who had "internet pseudocelebrity" standing for five minutes tend to be attention seeking assholes? The clickbait title was proof enough that this was more substanceless noise
---
Yeah just checked it out, definitely a little bit of a different scenario but the same outcome. You were geared better and have an optimized build and unfortunately it‚Äôs just a byproduct of having PvP and PvE players coexist on the same servers.  
---
From what I‚Äôve been informed BGS reviews these reports manually and it shouldn‚Äôt effect those of us who are legit and just better geared and have better strategies. Thanks for taking the time to read my post!
---
I would wait 6 or 12 month, the game is still in an early access state. 
---
It's because there was a lowbie near the leader when it spawned and scaled it to their level.
---
Don't tell me you've never been to top of the world and found all the raider towns are full of level 20 mobs... 
---
At that point I think they‚Äôd need video proof but I do understand your concern, it seems easier to fake video and audio nowadays and hopefully BGS has tools to counteract this. 
---
Just don't participate in horde events in the forest then.
---
It's like it's trying to communicate with us, I swear. 
---
i must have missed those posts its all good now thanks  
---
thanks its fixed now 
---
Yup, power armor is useless in PVP because there are no legendary armor pieces, and PVP armor is useless in nuke zones because the rads will just fry you in seconds. 
---
what about cryolators?
---
I think i once got inside too.i joined a hirde event and was trapped in a underwater mine tunnel ,and if i remember correctly it was called barrow too. With all the water tho,the only thing i could do was warp away so i did.
---
Nope, fast travel is only free to your CAMP, Vault 76, and any owned workshop.
---
Build your base by a junk pile as soon as possible, the junk you gather from it while leveling to 25 to get the excavator power armor will save you a lot of time in gathering the materials needed to make it, I just got done spending 3 days trying to build it 
---
If you drink another nukashine before the first one wears off does it restart the teleport timer? Or is it always 90seconds from when you drink the first one?
---
You will be banned soon, duper.
---
There's really nothing stopping people from taking workshops just to deny others. People effectively do the same thing by turret farming behind whitesprings. Contesting is probably an important mechanic. 
---
Secondly, evil has always been a playstyle choice available to all players in fallout. You could blow up megaton, you could join cesar's legion, and you could invade the commonwealth as the overboss. 
---
what about cryolators and gamma? btw i got a 2 shot laser the other day. think its only the explosive prefix got removed
---
Good question, I don't know as i run out of nukashines üòÇ
---
There's legendary armor that does this too though
---
I'm being affected by the 200hours+nuke cooldown...that sucks.
---
Carrying 400lbs NOW...
---
How dare you lie üòÇ but seriously you've got some levels to make up from your time away.
---
The fact that they didn‚Äôt delete any of your ammo says a lot imo. Seems other people who have gotten unbanned also didn‚Äôt have anything deleted.
---
Obviously this is going off the OP and other posters word but I tend to believe you just based on people I know irl getting banned that didn‚Äôt dupe. 
---
Now we know the limits as to what amount of ‚Äúrare‚Äù items one should have and players can stay within those parameters. Hope the wasteland treats you well! 
---
I got a 2 shot laser rifle the other day from a dead legendary 
---
It's a known issue that this particular event has been bugged for quite a while 
---
Yes. Really unhappy about being able to place my camp in a no build zone. If I can't build there, maybe don't let me put my goddamn camp there in the first place. Freezing when I eat or pick locks... but hey, I walked passed Riverside without freezing today so there's that. 
---
Ever got the one at the power plant in the Mire that's just blank? "Your workshop has been overrun/attacked by" with no enemy name. It's usually rad toads.
---
Have you gotten the robot to give you another recipe yet? I got one that first day, he had me a ferment an old possum and that's it so far. 
---
I wonder when the RP community is gonna build an AA house and hold meetings for Nukashine addicts üòÇ I‚Äôm more of a hoppy hunter myself!
---
Thanks for doing that research tho, I wasn‚Äôt sure what perks impacted the effects and a lot of people were saying Party boy would make it 300% damage buff. Glad that‚Äôs not the case. 
---
Can we have an area, sanctuary where pvp cannot occur and players can build their camp there? Neighbourly like.  Just make that place more prone to be attack by hordes of creatures every few days or whatever.
---
Carry weight, fall damage, DR and... It's just cool to walk in a power armor :) I like the mechanical sounds and how it behaves. It's fun and that's the biggest reason for me. That's why I play the game. 
---
T51b has the highest damage resistance of all PA and the mods will be easier to come by and the bonus nuka cola paint job. 
---
Benefits to PA?  Well you can go into nuke zones without giving up your DR/ER, you can get more carryweight with mods and you have access to Stabalized if using Heavy Weapons.  They are also used as ammo for Gattling Lasers.
---
I am. Glorf12 you can add me. I just got my account back so I'm sorting through my inventory. Add me and you can come have it for free
---
I believe Flatwoods is a no CAMP zone now, my buddy had a base there but was told it was ‚Äúmoved because of new content‚Äù 
---
üòÇ
---
I like the blocker that‚Äôs a good add looks pretty decent with the addition of nukashine dodgy in the agility might be great pickup. Drink the shine kill them and then teleport away you wouldn‚Äôt be using the damage boost but the ap regen will be great for dodgy it‚Äôs all about having more sustain than your opponent since PvP servers you can only respawn at your camp so you only get one shot.
---
You only need the Excavator Arms for double ore harvesting.  Full set gives +100 lbs. to carry weight.
---
Which daily gave it to you? Was it an actual plan that you had to read or did it just unlock?
---
The legedary effect can only trigger once per minute.  Not sure on Medic Pump.  Born Survivor is once per 20 seconds and works best with 1 point in it.
---
My sniper has a community oriented, hotel style camp across the tracks from the Whitesprings Station, modeled after Schrute Farms from the American version of The Office.  (Dwayne Schruter proprietor and regional manager)  I just don't feel like the place is complete with a bespoke rad shower.
---
Of course it's a huge target for griefers, but I'd say that 99.9% of the players that visit my house really appreciate the full range of amenities, especially the three guest rooms and music studio.  It's not uncommon for me to came back home to find 3-4 players jamming out on my piano, upright bass, snare drum and lap steel.  It actually sounds pretty good.
---
I did put the shower in storage for a long time before the TSE nerf, then brought it back out.  Now it seems like the insane clown with a power fist and fastnacht mask is the new griefing PvP meta.  I may store it until PvP servers go live.
---
My sledge/PA alt (Rod Swanson) lives way out in the middle of nowhere and I always store my rad shower until I need to use it with his camp.  I've only been griefed once there, AFK and asleep in bed and having half my house destroyed when I came back, but there wasn't anything difficult to repair.  Again, some weirdo with a power fist wearing a clown suit and tinfoil hat.
---
I don't even bother to plant any crops at the Swanson homestead, because there's 2-3 naturally spawning silt beans, at least a dozen firecracker and blackberries, plus a little outcropping with a static dead radstag and yao-guai within a short stroll around my camp.  That's easily enough to keep me going for most of my daily play session.
---
Just checked the Cryptid Wiki and the most recent sighting was in Appalachia, 2015 and is an interesting read.  Seems even the Sheepsquatch is afraid of something.  I'm now going to see if I can't find any videos talking about it.
---
Man this is weird a fudge imma try again 
---
I love when people think they are being elite but are actually flaunting their unusually high retardation levels.
---
Pick up EVERYTHING. Get to know where the crafting stations and stash boxes are. that scrap will be really valuable when you start to build your camp and craft things.
---
Bullets are hard to come by, make sure to carry a good melee for the lower level enemies so you don't waste bullets. 
---
In three months when all thats left to do is grind caps to buy stuff off reddit because bloody deathclaw gauntlets and anti armor shotguns dont exist in your world, you‚Äôll get bored.
---
Yeah but that‚Äôs why the OP says ‚Äúseems to be‚Äù. It‚Äôs only human to draw inferences based on what you know, hopefully BGS can fix it soon tho I miss fighting the queen. 
---
On a side note I haven‚Äôt noticed my food degrading any quicker but I can‚Äôt say conclusively it doesn‚Äôt.
---
I definitely get your point about there being complaining posts every time a new patch comes out, but I think letting BGS know what seem to be bugs only helps them put out hot fixes sooner. 
---
It seems like they took bender and Finn into consideration.
---
I feel the same. We need players (like you) who play the game. We don't need people who say "76 bad. Make good or me no play". The game certainly does have issues, but it can be fun, really fun.
---
Survive the instance? What‚Äôs that mean? I haven‚Äôt played fallout in awhile. But I used to do nukes alone all the time? Things changed? Is there patch notes explaining this. 
---
All three - unfermented, fermented, and vintage. 
---
Wee, unique items.
---
So by your reasoning Bethesda should count two different duped legendaries both in amount of 400, as equal to 5 nuka colas and 3 coals.
---
Yep, I can really see how it makes so much more sense. Number of unique items is the..uuhhm..problem.
---
Problem of what exactly? Problem to whom, and how?
---
It's only clear you have no problems because you were smart ahead. You are just overly sympathetic to some other people to whom these artificial limits implemented in wrong way, are a problem. And yet it's kinda funny, or odd. Why Bethesda goes about to create problems to probably so few players? Strange. I do know sadism, but a company being sadist?
---
Considering buying a copy of the game, is it any good? Please write out your thoughts in detail because I forgot how use the search bar.
---
Just build your own! Fertilizer is pretty easy to come by, planting blackberries was my first source of caps when I started playing. 
---
Since we're here. How do you make vintage beverages?
---
I‚Äôd take a look at the roadmap online and see if anything interest you on there. Then buy the game around that time and maybe it‚Äôll be a totally different experience for you. Not much has changed so far but I have high hopes for the future DLC. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt worry about the price of this game going up either, if anything it‚Äôll get cheaper over time.
---
I've done this twice so far.  1st time, I had to make him a Tick Blood Tequila, so I got learned the recipe for that and made one.  Reward was 1 Rad Ant Lager.  2nd time, I had to make him a High Voltage Hefe, so I got learned the recipe for that and made one.  Reward was, again, 1 Rad And Lager.
---
I don't know the software either. But I can imagine a code to convert objects into build-able objects is doable. But I guess we have to wait and see.
---
Wasn't this a thing in Fallout 3? Iirc, you could put nuka cola in a chiller thing at your house and before too long it would be cold...provided extra benefits i believe.
---
I knew exactly what it was the moment i saw the title, still laughed! take my upvote \^\^  
---
PS. We need more memes in this subreddit.
---
Pretty sure that was a feature in Fallout 3.
---
I'm on xbox and get it regularly too
---
I saw it at the bos vendor in watoga and at whitesprings bunker (enclave vendor) you can also get it by claiming/defending workshops
---
Once i glitched out of the map and the first thing i thought was "I must take some screenshots".!!!
---
is it the vault in the trailer?  at 01:36

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIZ-LGaRB6M&amp;t=18s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIZ-LGaRB6M&amp;t=18s)
---
Dun dun dunnn at no point is it referred to as dlc
---
&gt; It‚Äôs not even a contest for the workshop which I understand.
---
This is the heart of the issue right here.  The people who actually want to use the workshop are at the mercy of PvPers that only want to disengage the slap damage system.  You try to fight them? you're giving them the PvP they want and there is no reason for them to not keep fighting.  This is without factoring in the completely lack of balance in PvP or the rampant duping that allowed everyone who was remotely interested to get the best gear in the game for a handful of caps.
---
Yup, and the reloading is slower too! 
---
I have no issues on pc with my headphones. Try going into settings in the game and adjust the volume mix
---
You ought to just try being social. This evening I had a four-man group I was playing as a part of, and we adventured around for a couple of hours, having a good time. Let me tell you about them. 
---
Blokeon I met when we were doing the Powering Up Monongah event. We both happened to be inside the plant, and I extended him a team invite on a whim so we could coordinate our efforts. He accepted and we got to chatting. He was something like level 30 at the time and had at that time never teamed up with anyone in the game. Since then, we've teamed up a dozen or more times. 
---
Shadow is someone who my brother met in-game the same way, more or less, and after a few times that I and my brother teamed up where Shadow happened to be around and part of the group too, I added Shadow to my friends list. We now frequently play and chat together as well. 
---
KD gave me a random team invite when we both happened to be in the same part of the world as one another and I was higher level than him, so he wanted some powerful backup. Toward the end of our first adventure, I visited his CAMP and helped decorate it for him, which he was pleased and delighted by. This was our second time adventuring together. 
---
I happened to see all three of them playing at the same time, each solo-style. I started a party on my PS4, invited all three of them into it, and then suggested they all hop to my server, team up with me, and we'd get some stuff done. They all happily agreed, and we had a great time rampaging around. None of them know each other except through me, but it didn't prevent them from getting along well and helping each other out with shared resources, perk cards and such. 
---
About an hour into it, we were all having a great time and enthusiastically agreed that THIS was the way the game was meant to be played. This is precisely what Bethesda had in mind for our experience in this game. 
---
You ought to give it a whirl. It doesn't take much, and it's so worthwhile. 
---
Managed to grab a fire axe from a ghoul so I'll stick to that for now and stock up on ammo thanks :D
---
Aren‚Äôt you getting ahead of yourself when no dlc has even been announced?
---
Today was the first time I logged in after the update and I got the same message. But I could still place my CAMP module in the same spot (it was green). I didn‚Äôt place it though because I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a bug and maybe my CAMP will reappear later. 
---
Fallout 1 followed the template you described more - gritty post apocalyptic rpg with touches of gallows humor and goofiness only in Easter eggs. 
---
But I think fallout 2 was more like it is today. The story telling was 50-50 tongue in cheek, with non easter egg pop culture references (hub church) and much goofiness (and even more crazy Easter eggs).
---
I believe the real problem is that what made the fallout universe so interesting was our imagination taking off from the base material and as the game world gets more fleshed out it becomes less fantastic in our heads , less mysterious. That they troll out the same factions and in-game settings and companies despite vastly changing world locations doesn't help. 
---
Yeah the axes are pretty good early on. As far as the perk cards go, don't sleep on the ones that help with speed and ap regen, you're gonna be running around alot :)
---
Or are lots of people coming back to try it, taxing the servers?
---
Very much, yes.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt limit yourself to specifically single player , I did to start with but then bumped in to some people by whitesprings and made some friends I play with daily months later still. If your on Xbox I‚Äôm happy to tag along and help out üòã 
---
The bugs and stability have gone from the level of a crippling migraine to a dull headache and game content has improved with added content and gameplay fixes. 
---
Worth trying again but experiences are highly subjective.
---
Ya i know , just wanted it for the real farm look üòÅ
---
Dont forget to go back everday for a new quest from biv to learn new recipes
---
As long as it's an actual thought out mini-game and not that dumb MMO AFK fishing crap that I'm tired of seeing.
---
He's my new friend in all of Appyda- Appy- Appstay- Appalachia, because he could really use a hand and I got more than just the one. Plus he's got plenty more recipes to try ooout...
---
1000000 combos (times)
---
10 seconds per try (divided by)  
---
60 seconds per minute (divided by)  
---
60 minutes per hour (divided by)  
---
24 hours per day  
---
115.74 days to punch in all those combinations for 1 person. So I suggest getting more than a couple of people.
---
Ps4 unfortunately :P
---
Not got many friends that play ps4 so maybe I'll end up teaming up with people eventually :D
---
Imo levels 20-30 are the hardest trying to beat supermutants most of the time so hopefully you‚Äôll find some teammates around then 
---
Out of curiosity did you brute force this? Or did you happen to find the clues that start in the Nuka Cola plant? I didn't find the other half, just that once I saw the mentioned of Tanagra Town that the keypad would finally be powered. 
---
I'd address this to u/OneGeekTravelling as well. 
---
When our characters emerge from the vaults, Appalachia is currently ground zero of a threat which is potentially even more apocalyptic than the bombs themselves: The infection of the scorchbeasts has already wiped out everyone who has attempted to rebuild here, and if they're not stopped here and now, before they can breed and spread, they will do so to the entire world. There will be no rebuilding. There will be no hope for the future. They have to be stopped here and now in order to save the rest of the world from what's happened here. 
---
So, u/OneGeekTravelling, you see, you're saving everyone outside of Appalachia from what's already happened here. And /u/hipgypsie13, the reason why nobody is rebuilding here is because until the threat of the scorchbeasts has been dealt with, there's no point in rebuilding for fear of whatever you build befalling a fate worse than death. 
---
Which brings us to the upcoming autumn DLC, "Wastelanders." It's been advertised as a new main quest, with genuine choices and consequences. My sense is that this is, like "one year later, after the Scorchbeast Queen is dead," when people begin to return to Appalachia and start to rebuild, and your characters taking a hand in how that's going to go down. 
---
I literally got a level 1 1 star wood arm from the forest scorched horde yesterday. 
---
aren't fish extinct in the fallout universe?
---
The last one I did in the cranberry Bog was level 20. 
---
If you're always looking for plastic or shotgun ammo, I suggest somewhere close to a school or mole miner hotspot.
---
Morgantown High is a terrific spot for plastic, as is Watoga High.
---
It's probably more efficient to just gather the ammo pre-made without having to craft it.  In that respect, I'd suggest a camp somewhere around Welch.  Server hopping a few times and respawning the guaranteed mole miner mobs around Welch should net you a good deal of shells.  Let's say you kill the dozen or so in town with one shot each, and they each drop at least a half dozen shells, that's a good net profit.  They also drop a lot of black titanium, which is saleable to vendors in raw form for 1cap each.  (doesn't sound like much, but when you have hundreds it adds up)  I believe Welch and Lewisburg both have ammo vending machines, so you can use those caps from the extra titanium to buy even more ammo.  (Hard Bargain perk, grape mentats and most alcohol decreases the price, as does using a full set of unyielding armor with low health while vendoring at various spots.  I just bought signs and letters plan for less than 7k) 
---
Mole miners aren't terribly difficult to kill since they're level capped at 40, so swapping out Bloody Mess or Class Freak (assuming you run with mutations) with rank 3 Scrounger (Luck perks) will help with the ammo containers around town.  Mt. Blair Trainyard is another mole miner hotspot, and very close.  All of the Abandoned Mine Shaft locales tend to have mole miners more often than not, but you're guaranteed to fight a lot of them in Welch and the trainyard, and they're usually armed with shotguns.
---
Depending on how you like to play, making some regular friends and team-mates is a great idea.  My friend uses .308 ammo, I use .45 and we save what we find while on our own and trade when we link up.  We normally trade a few hundred rounds to each other initially, and drop bags of a couple dozen rounds periodically as we run around together.  I haven't needed to craft .45 in weeks.

Yes you can. https://imgur.com/a/XXLFm7B

So much spam that it becomes useless.

VATS is pivotal for lower levels to gain an advantage over higher level players. 
---
It‚Äôs the only thing that keeps me competitive. I‚Äôm level 56 and Iv owned numerous higher level bullies because of it. 
---
A lot of people don‚Äôt actually know how to build their character around PvP maybe? 
---
Aw man really? I can‚Äôt find any anywhere haha, I guess I‚Äôm not a lucky drunk.
---
Xbox!
---
Sorely tempted!
---
I most certainly did not - I found it in the game files after checking the door to see if it was powered. I just learned about the new Nuka Cola "treasure trail" and didn't know that this was apart of it. Which is great because I spent way too long trying to find the in-game source of the code or any context for it all.
---
This is already being done by some players. There are a few weekly flee markets. The flat woods fleemarket typically has a theme and an event in addition to trading. The issue is and always will be that on a 25 person server, the best you can usually do is around 10 people to your event.

Cant engage with the tinker workstation in either 1st person or 3 person mode to Craft

The animation starts for about 3 frames then just quits - have tried the one in my hut, tried moving it, tried one in the wilderness
---
Scrap items does work.
---
This ideas are great and all but isn‚Äôt it getting to be a bit ridiculous? Let‚Äôs hope they iron out the game so it performs better before introducing 1000 ideas to add shit that‚Äôs just going to throw in another bug. This idea has been posted at least 20 times. Why not add a working toilet? Enough. 
---
Any chance you're selling that thing?? 
---
Workshops are Area you pay caps to occupy until you leave the serve or until another player takes it from you, there are quite a few in the game and they let you harvest resources from multiple resource nodes at once, each workshop specializes in a resource, meaning some workshops will yield a greater supply of a certain resource than others and will have more nodes of a specific resource to mine from, the only workshop unique resources are ammo and fusion cores, which means you won‚Äôt find a fusion core processor anywhere else but a power plant, and you won‚Äôt find an ammunition processor anywhere else but the ammunition plant, you can encounter some of these resource nodes outside of workshops which you can build your base near and harvest, but you might not find more than one in an area unlike a workshop, and people can steal from them
---
Ability to place small ashtrays, cigarettes and alcohol on tables in CAMP would be nice. Also please make cigars and cigarettes as headwear (as in smoking) option, like bandanas
---
I think by DLC, they mean extra content, like today‚Äôs patch. And the future ones for the vaults and stuff
---
I can give you some nuke cards
---
Seems like people are being unsuspended in waves, it was posted here too
---
Who said there wasn‚Äôt NPCs in this game?
---
If you use a melee in vats it‚Äôs basically cheating lol I was messing around with pvp.(he tried to kill my small charecter so o switched to my big charecter) and vats teleports you behind someone and swings it doesn‚Äôt hit them up front
---
I have only drinken Nukashine twice and both times it took me to the tight rope. I always feel compelled to cross it, but my hands are shaky and my balance is bad. I pray I never wind up there again, lest I risk a long drop...
---
That's an excellent point, and probably one of the main lines of thought behind it. 
---
But it makes me wonder how much of a threat those higher level plays would be if they also were not using V.A.T.S. hitting moving targets is difficult for anyone. And without V.A.T.S. critical, fights would last longer and seem more like competitions.
---
It‚Äôs sort of a big difference. You have the symbols n stuff and the paint is much darker. A big game changer would be them having paladin.
---
I like it but it would be so much better if we had refrigerators. 
---
Fireproof perk with armour build with dense mods to avoid explosive/fire damage, paired with assassins/cavalier/sentinel armour to reduce Player damage and damage whilst sprinting and/or standing still, also possibly paired with Dodgy. Evasive, serendipity.
---
Outside of power armour you can have upto 500 DR still with the exception of damage resisting percentages, something PA can‚Äôt do unless you have emergency protocols and are below 30% health.
---
I agree though, right now PvP, defense and penetration values are WAY off.
---
You can‚Äôr PvP in a game where everyone is running around 1 hitting each other, it‚Äôs not feasible and things NEED to change.
---
I thought they didn't delete anything so people would have to use the destroy option instead of moving their stuff around/paper bagging it
---
I thought so too...
---
Scorchbeasts already drop plans for prime receivers and some armor mods plans including dense mods. I'm not saying the rewards are common enough or th fight easy for everyone.  But if Bethesda makes the SB legendary imagine the bog. Any player close to a fissure always spawns a SB. That seems vulnerable to exploits.
---
Heck I can give you a method I thought of just reading this. Surface to air event in the bog (west of the steakhouse). When doing the event SB keep spawning from the fissure. Every time one dies the next spawns. I've killed em before the were able to get out the fissure before. Killed around 20 or more of them during the event back to back.
---
I just have the herbivore mutation. Whenever I‚Äôm hungry, I just grab a plant or two off the ground and I‚Äôm good to go

Thanks but i traded for 50 before the update i‚Äôm not desperate for cards tbh but, something needs to give here man.
---
I hate that the fan base is so split on the comedy, because that's why Obsidian put in Wild Wasteland. We could have had even more funny bits in that game

Same here. Same ign aslo

I‚Äôll be on in an hour or two. I can help you out. Message me your psn
---
for the thirst I just drink alcohol, it's easy to find and I have the perk that makes you not get addicted to alcohol (can't remember the name)

Ya I found some ammo ONE TIME

I think VATS should be removed against other players. There are a few reasons for it; headshots are supposed to be harder to pull off, and they do significantly more damage (I think armor is reduced when hitting the head, but don't quote me on that). Hitting extremities should be a little bit harder than hitting the torso, because you can cripple them and gain a big advantage over your ejemy this way - but with VATS and Concentrated fire, both headshots and crippling limbs are easy task. 
---
What this does is it makes the fights way too short and boring ("boring" is my opinion, of course). Literally the only thing one has to do is hide until the enemy appears, toggle VATS, select the head, smash the fire button. I should know, I run a Guerrilla build and I win most of my fights in two or three seconds.
---
Short fights lead to boredom for the winner, and frustration for the defeated - and that's when appears what we have seen around here many times: people complaining about others "one-shotting" them, this guy is a cheater because he killed me too fast, people are using exploits to kill me in two seconds... (I have received my own messages on PSN, too). 
---
Of course, this doesn't mean that there are other things, which are extremely OP in PvP, that can one-shot you without VATS (*cough* bloodied melee *cough*). But there's a problem with melee and VATS too, a pretty big one, and it's teleportation. A melee player using VATS on you is basically teleporting a few meters to your location. At that point, if you are aiming manually, you've lost.
---
Hmmm... maybe I will make my own post about this, since there's a PvP mode coming.
---
THAT explains why I didn't get my Camden Park daily.
---
No fuzzy tokens for me.  :(
---
My friend had no problems launching a nuke at White springs a couple hours ago on PS4
---
Nice use of the environment. Love it  keep up the good work.
---
 I agree on the tents also
---
That would be awesome; fridge for the poor!
---
That other guy is trying to bait you into an argument with a simple no but it's because Bloodied and Two Shot are on the same legendary effect roll. Bloodied explosive and two shot explosive for example are possible. Explosive is what was removed from energy weapons, so I don't even know what OP is talking about
---
It‚Äôs only certain accounts on certain platforms.
---
It‚Äôs literally 50/50 on who is able to launch right now, across all platforms, multiple threads posted over the last 2 days.
---
Use stealth boys in PvP, they disable VATS.
---
Party boy actually increases the amount of blackouts. Have fun haha
---
I killed a 3* ghoul and got a drill
---
That's fine but it still takes from your same build limit. Also the blueprint system isn't flawless yet. And a lot of people build complicated Camps that aren't easy to blueprint and transport. Mine is built into other objects, if I had to start it again there is zero chance it would all pop down again 
---
Why do people here ask if things have changed, instead of looking for themselves?
---
I'm just trying to understand the reasoning behind this behaviour...

Hey, he was on private property. He actually walked in my shop and just kept saying, "Stop"
---
I wasn't home so it was just easier to post on Reddit to find out quicker

That has been playing over and over in my head since this started xD
---
I am very much not this stupid.
---
This is why I will be keeping a 30 day video log of my gameplay ;-) if anything happens I'll have proof
---
I unfortunately started this quest last night and when I blacked out I just got the loading screen forever and had to kill the game.  When I logged back in I was at a launch site.  Cool mechanic but would prefer the game not put me in endless loading screen.  Kind of like that bug we had on logging out of the game for awhile...
---
You should definitely be max capped in three months
---
Mine too, since I read your post.  
---
Sounds like some kind of bug that needs reported via ticket,if you haven‚Äôt already.  I would also delete any ‚Äústored‚Äù items and maybe blueprints to clean it up.   
---
Yes please.  It‚Äôs one thing to be able to block and mute troublesome people, but it doesn‚Äôt help when they fat-man my camp!  Blocking them for the session should make them unable to damage my camp or me. 
---
Some weirdos came up to me and demanded caps because I had set up my camp in ‚Äútheir territory‚Äù.  They were a group of 4 , all level 100+ and I‚Äôm level 30.  I told them no and they ripped through my camp. Then I fast traveled across the map and tried rebuilding. It was obnoxious and it‚Äôs not the first time something like this happened.  I would really appreciate a better system being put in place for camp protection against aggressive players like that.  
---
Hang around player packed areas or try to participate in events where other players are. Often if I see the same person or someone pulling some funny crap we talk or even add to team. There are a lot of people who want to play together or just want to play solo but have friendly people around em. 
---
Also if you run into some people that are up to no good those friendly strangers will probably love to help you out. (some people always look for a reason to pvp w/o ruining others game )
---
Radiation mostly.
---
I am unable to play atm, (in a conference). But reading all these post about this issue. I have a suggestion.
---
1. Upon receaving cannot place message.. stay on the same server. Do not place your camp. Fast travel to vault 76 or the nearest train station 
---
Interact with a static container ( dead body, luggage ect).
---
 Log out of the server. Close the game completely.
---
Log back into server.  If you receive the message again move camp to another location ( one not near the original location at all. Do NOT build just place camp
---
Log our close game log back in. 
---
This will determine if it's the camp that's causing the issue or if it's the camps building that is causing the issue
---
I would test but do not have access to the game
---
 And sorry for bad formatting, I'm on mobile
---
First of all, [You Are Special](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=) is the best resource ever.  Play around with different perks, build different characters at will...it's just great.
---
I don't want to give you too much advice, but one thing that I feel is important is to choose a type of weapon you like and just dig fully into the related perks.  I see so many players not investing in a specialty, and they wind up suffering.  You're going to deal a hell of a lot more damage and save yourself a lot of resources by choosing a profession, so to speak.  I tend to see a lot of people "generalizing" with low hanging perks and only using one rank of weapon related perks, but I think this isn't a very good idea for two major reasons....
---
one, you're carrying around all kinds of extra weight.  Having a rifle, a shotgun, a grenade launcher and a sledgehammer isn't helping at all.  I often trade with players that are carrying 20+ weapons and they're asking me to slow down because they're overencumbered.  I carry two rifles, one with a scope modded for recoil to get long range targets, and one with a reflex sight modded for a combo of hipfire and recoil accuracy for CQC and charging enemies.  As backup, I carry two grenades and a combat knife.  My normal walkaround gear weighs less than 90 lb.  I might have to repair my rifles once every couple days, and I carry only two types of ammunition.  The perk investment is substantial, but I usually need 1 headshot to take down a normal enemy.  Maybe 4-5 for a deathclaw or yao-guai. 
---
two, if you're not specced in to a weapon style (rifles/shotguns/two handed melee/etc) you're going to be burning up way more ammo than you need to, and repairing your weapons constantly.  Plinking away at a swarm of high level enemies is not fun.  You're wasting tons of valuable resources in ammo, aid items, scrap and play time.  Go fully into shotguns, for example, and that swarm of a dozen ghouls is going to be dead in less than a minute.  Dead enemies can't hurt you, so you can save up on stimpaks and sell extra.
---
If you like playing with a variety of different stuff, make multiple characters.  I have a stealth rifleman and a power armor sledgehammer guy.  Completely opposite, but I have fun playing both.  
---
This happened to me! I was making healing salve and all my blood leafs I had just harvested within the last 30 min spoiled.  I was so pissed!!
---
Check your gfx settings, mine were turned up to ultra when I first logged in after patch. My pc is not ultra :)

---
I keep seeing complaints about this but isn‚Äôt a constantly recurring quest that awards you (a few caps in this case) something we all want? I wish every minor quest was infinitely repeatable like the wendigo clown quest!
---
Tried it with a fresh  character same problem
---
It's happening to a lot of people since the update.

Luuuuuuuuucky lol had the same shit happen to me clearing out the golf clubhouse, all low lvl junk
---
The song that plays on the jukebox in the new speakeasy is a fucking banger. I wish we had more options for our CAMP as well.
---
Reminds me a bit of kingdom come deliverance, which was always fun to experience with the blackouts
---
I use instigating fast knives on them. They cant block if you death circle them and keep stabbing them in the side and back.
---
High strength 5 charisma 5 perception
---
Once you hit level 50 you are even with everyone 50 and over. So it doesn't matter if you are level 50 or 450.
---
I only really bring my workbenches and fusion generator with me, since I can't really spare the screws :) It would be a shame if I had to scrap them, but if it comes to it...
---
Absolutely agree they all should at minimum be 1* legendary. I don't think I've seen a legendary scorchbeast in 230 hours besides the queen
---
I bought it at Charleston Station and see it very often at vendors. I sold a spare I stumbled across to another player for about 20~ caps. 
---
If your looking for a junk pile the one just north of the east mountain lookout is where i have my camp. By using vault 76 as a free travel spot and 6 charisma and travel agent I can hit all vendors for 11 caps or less either from my base or 76. Morgantown High and watoga high are close to vendors so its cheap to travel and get plastic. Morgantown high usually drops tons of shotgun shells also, especially if you go in and melee them down to save ammo. 
---
Yeah it was just for the screen shot :) 
---
Nope, it‚Äôs level 60. 
---
I got a 1 star boxing glove off the scorch beast queen. Worth it. 
---
1 cap. Once. Praise Atom! 
---
I was wondering about that. How many people are running around getting loaded with beer hats on in game.  Man all the atom quests are about getting  drunk and doing things. I've been skipping the beer hat quests until now. Now it's a way of life and I'm all out of addictol. Funny for a week but after that it'll be a bit much. Story of my life.
---
Wrong. Why would you think 60? Who gave you this false information? As long as you perked your person correctly and don't have to make any changes, you are just as powerful at 50 as you are at 51 or 1000.
---
I've had that happen after a patch. Sounds basic but do the built-in scan and repair in the launcher if you haven't already. Sorry if obvious and you've already done it.
---
At this point this game is going to turn into Minecraft. With mutants, lasers, and power armor
---
I think that I use to get stuff during beta. Now I ignore them. I got a quantum once though! 
---
Now that I think about it they should rework the corpses to do something more.
---
I have the same problem with the mole miners that block with their gauntlets.  It‚Äôs annoying to waste the time swinging at them and it does literally nothing. :/
---
I've seen them in game near my camp there is a tower where a park Ranger apparently lived and there they are on the steps to the top. You can harvest from them too so the programming is in the game. Hope that helps. I bet this gets in eventually.
---
I played the first week of launch, got out of the vault. Killed a radstag stuck in the air and then it crashed...came back after a couple weeks and i havent stopped playing when i have time thanks to swing shift, theres plenty of things that need fixed sure but i throughly enjoy it. That bein said tho none of my friends even want to try it so if anyone on xbox is in the same boat feel free to add me, my gt is the same as my name on here
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; But faster spoiling will suck for the next 'Make Mentats' challenge, as I haven't found a place that has all three ingredients (firecap, brain fungus, and carrot flower) in one spot yet.
---
That one was already kind of a nightmare even before this patch, given how far and wide you'd have to travel to get some of the ingredients! I'm glad to hear that making grape mentats completes it. That'll save me a lot of aggravation next time. 
---
Cryo kills AP and renders vats users useless.

Many times over. To buy things from reddit for 10-20k caps...

If you‚Äôre on PC and are using mods, that‚Äôs the issue. One or more need updating.

Cool.... So back to the gun topic..
---
I'm a low health bloodied melee build but can change a few cards for shotgun/heavy weapons etc... I've lost around 200 dmg across the board and I just can't figure out where it is coming from. I've been rechecking and rechecking my perk cards like I have OCD just incase I left off nerd rage or something but nothing lol, it's really pissed me off. 
---
Are only initiate and knight available?
---
Nobody else is is still getting kicked off servers? 
---
Odds are you not perking your person correctly because of the perk cards. I wasn‚Äôt able too, I was nowhere near as competitive as I was at level 55+. 
---
The 10 levels in between allows you to finalize your perk build so you are on equal playing field against other finished builds. 
---
I‚Äôm level 57 and nearly finished my build. 
---
Duper shedding evidence = you win!!

The ability to get loot when killing three stars at least let's me wander the world again. I'm not big on farming single locations.

Same here. If it's a limb it cripples.

True

I run into the same. I think it¬¥s, if you lose the connection. the game try to reconnect but the server got still your old login and handle it as a secondary login trail. may some bybass would help,

So maybe you should have resisted the urge to tell us what is in an area we are not meant to know about (yet) and just leave.

Not reading the bulk of your post because it shouldn't exist.

I've only found caps on petrified corpses.

Yes same! I here there is an ini file to fix. I‚Äôll have to try that

I've had a couple of caps, but mostly just collect rads from them.

I now have a lot of duplicate plans, semi thinking of setting a base price of 150 for all of them.

Fallout 76 is a PvE game with PvP elements and destroying a CAMP just to get your kicks is, frankly a dick move. I can't believe I'm agreeing with the guy above you.
---
I can't tell if your reply was satire or not, since you made a lot of genuinely good points. I wouldn't call it griefing, but it _does_ make you an asshole. At least in my subjective opinion.
---
I believe Wrecking Ball was intended for workshops, or meant to be used when already in combat. Not to ruin another person's hard work and force them to use their scrap to repair it just because you want PvP. This isn't Fallout: Battle Royale and was never advertised as such.
---
Again, if this was satire, I missed it, if not, don't let my opinion spoil your day. I am, after all, a stranger on the internet. What I think of you shouldn't matter.

It may be a connection issue. Server stability has improved in leaps and bounds barring a hiccup the other day.
---
Sounds like a tainted batch! 
---
I haven't had a single daily pop up since the update. In none of the regions. No fuzzy tokens. No biv. Nothing. 
---
I gotcha, thanks and... LOL at me for using Fix It Good. Lets just say that's down me using Dayquil. The disease thing though, could be a refresh issue but I've never seen two diseases obtained far apart refresh like this.
---
I was give a whiskey quest (drink fresh whiskey and melee an enemy) and just used a scavenged whiskey from my inventory. Didn't craft it and it accepted it as completed. Just a FYI to save you time next time
---
I've had 5 blackouts so far. For some reason each time I end up at a different picnic area with dead bodies in the wasteland.
---
thats a new feature
---
Thanks Enigma... I'm uh, on Dayquil :-0 And uh, yeah. Ahem. Weapon Artisan of course.. of course. Thanks!
---
That's the mindset I had too when I was asking. Even though I don't PvP, watching two players bounce around using the environment as cover to gain an advantage over their opponents would be much entertaining than the current few hits and dead approach.  
---
Nothing is gone from my account. I still have like 10k ultracite rounds and all my other pieces. Nothing was touched
---
Lmao, new meta build. THE MILK SNIPER.
---
I have played that, that is just a funny quest though and you just dress up as the silver shroud. It is not an actual order of "super heroes" that have an undeground "batman" cave.
---
The day after....I'm really surprised we managed to keep it to only one dick joke in the decorations....
---
I think that there's definitely something going on because no daily quests have started for me since Tuesday. I have no problem getting the quest from the tattoo parlor for more booze but everything else seems to be off for some reason. Oh well at least events are still working and they seem more frequent for some reason.
---
You don‚Äôt need to make them, I just got mine from the bar protectron at whitesprings 
---
The new nukashine quest is a daily you can go back each day and try to learn new recipes as well as get this plan. I got it today also! 
---
Maybe I didn't have the temp high enough.. 
---
Hell yeah have a merchant bot named Fisho that talks about moving to New Vegas and changing his name.
---
Yeah fun police this comment right here ^
---
I learned this the hard way... Lol. Shooting legendary robots in Watoga with my Adrenal Reaction build, the thing detonate a nuclear bomb the instant the bullet hits them, you'd better hope you are far away xd
---
Beverage? Anyways it sounds like retardation instead of intoxication 
---
only if you don't fall off the map
---
They also disable sights on firearms . It's a good point though, and is definitely useful in a variety of situations.
---
It's bugged for any combo.  I got rum, perception and ranged yesterday.  Made some rum, shot a few ghouls, then a radstag, then some super mutants, rum wore off and I'm asked to drink more rum.
---
I'm not about to turn down a good time, but I do a quick search on my phone "fallout 76 tipsy test broken" and try out the suggestions.  I drank rum, killed an enemy, picked up their weapon, equipped it, tried killing other enemies, still no luck.  Tried shotguns, hunting rifles, a 10mm pistol and even a crossbow in and out of stealth with iron sights, hip fire and scoped kills.  Still not completing.
---
I went back to camp, logged out, grabbed the Capt Morgan out of my basement along with a liter of Pepsi and here I am.  (\*hic)  Love U Bricky!  (kiss fingers and point at the sky)
---
OK that definitely explains something because I'm experiencing the same thing. My cooked food is fine and seems to be OK but my uncooked food spoils super fast. For example I killed a few wolves in the cranberry bog got some Wolf meat and ran through emergency services only to get back to my camp and find out that I had a bunch of spoiled meat
---
when it comes time to prestige the low level gear will be worth holding onto, or if you start a new character
---
Bunch of topics for the same thing, disable your mods and custom .ini they are incompatible with the new patch.
---
Depression, Depression never ends!  
---
(Unless you have the right meds!)
---
Not for caps.  Possibly for a good trade.
---
Anything missing from your character? Haven‚Äôt had a chance to check mine, hoping I can login too.
---
That's cool. Never seen the actual launch and prob never will. Props for showing us. 
---
That explains that lol was in my camp ran down stairs thinking someone was inside..... their is a building up the hill that has a tink bench in it someone most of been there.... they need to fix that as the building is just viewable no way someone would hear that sound through walls or even from that distance.
---
nothing. Good luck.
---
I went there and saw nothing. I probably missed it somehow... You mean the dried up river behind it or  are there literal pools? I ended up following the stream  Northside of watoga and collected like 20 spots. But if there's a handful closer to flatwoods I'm all for it. 
---
A singular cap.
---
Thanks Mate
---
Disappears or is damaged? 
---
so thats why im getting bombarded with notifications that i got the same piece over and over again
---
So,  [**u/MuForceShoelace**](https://www.reddit.com/user/MuForceShoelace) ? What say you now?
---
He‚Äôs discount bender lol.
---
I stand corrected. But the blunderbluss is impossible to get mods on right?
---
Stash boxes preserve food tho
---
Can I just say, it's shitty this stuff still happens but that actually makes me appreciate how many individually placed scene objects there are in the world of 76
---
gone. I can even place another turret on same place. But i lost 2 turrets this way
---
Now it‚Äôs just gambling when you buy. I‚Äôm terrible at it, just bought a three star ghoul slayer assault rifle and found out the other two features are ‚Äòbash damage‚Äô and ‚Äò90% reduced weight‚Äô, even though the thing still weighs 11 lbs. Buhdezduh needs to hire some highschoolers to help them with math. 
---
Lay off the jet bub, ita not good for you.
---
I didn't read the other comments do if someone else said this then I'm sorry. But Ooooohhhhhh hell no. Melee builds already can ignore 75% of armor with just perks, give them some cavalier gear and a stealth boy and how do you think this will go? No no no no. I'll accept them being hard to fight and agile but this is too far. Hell damn near anything that isn't rapid fire is mostly ineffective unless you can vats. So that is every sniper build that would be thrown out. Why? If you don't like being hit with vats then lose whatever you have against stealth boys and use them until they are eventually patched because if one thing in online games that never changes, It's people complaining until something is patched to give them an advantage.
---
OP none of my aggression in this comment was aimed at you and if you feel that I did so I apologize. But anyone who has fought against a melee ninja stealth boy build can tell you that they are tough as hell already. Removing vats only helps those builds not the others.
---
I have wondered why this isn't in the game for awhile now, seems odd to me that they made the C.A.M.P. peice's in 76 such a minimized set compared to FO4. The greenhouse set was the first thing I looked for, I like glass houses.
---
Im getting 580 dmg with a aae shotty ( combat ) , 20% hp , all the shotgun perks , nerd rage and adrenal mutation . With a bloodied explosive shotty , I‚Äôm getting 831 dmg . 
---
I would set up the "Tag for Search" as soon as you can.  Pick which materials you want to always pickup.. for example screws and for me lead (for ammo) amongst others. There's a cool materials graph out there that advises which materials you should get a lot of, I'll send it to you if you want (just pm me if interested). Also the perk Ammosmith if you have a shooter build for +80% bullets when crafting.  Perks for the particular type of weapon damage you want to use (pistols, non-auto rifles, auto rifles, melee, etc.)
---
I saw a load of duct tape and fans in my local Lidls' a few weeks back and almost emptied the shelves.
---
This time play fair and don‚Äôt whine if you get caught not playing fair. Your last temper tantrum came to the detriment of the game and community.
---
First welcome back, depending on how long you've been gone a lot may have changed. But if you want plastic, Morgantown high school or west tek. The former being the easier of the two. Hope you stick around and enjoy the blackouts from Nuka Shine.
---
No worries. I'm not offended. I'm just curious about people's take on it.
---
Diluted, Everything seems to be fine now, probably just a minor ‚Äúpost update algorithm conflict.‚Äù
---
Can't tell if this is a serious post or not...
---
walk?
---
So what's wrong with keeping unreleased content hidden until release?  
---
If it's found by mistake, leave the area/location and keep it to yourself, FFS some people can't keep their mouths closed.  
---
I care not if you don't understand my point.
---
I had this happen in my camp. Luckily they were on something i had built so when i stored that piece (foundation block) it also stored the turrets that were on it that had disappeared.  It looks like that method wouldn‚Äôt work with how you have them but i have heard you can place things on small placemats/welcome mats and it may be worth trying that and next time they disappear. You could try storing the mats that are under them and maybe it would store the turrets like it did for me.
---
Think of it as the cost of supplies (ammo,chems,ect) to get from where you're at to where you are trying to go.
---
Fuck yourself, Mr "I work for a living". I work all day, cook dinner for my family, then do the activities I described in twenty minutes. Most workshops have four resource collectors, I've got two (lead and fertilizer). You're the one that's missing the point. 
---
If you stopped being a whiny bitch demanding something you're too stupid to understand the game already provides, you'd be better off.
---
Nobody listens to me when I say that since dropping turrets from my build I never get attacked. I had them at first but was getting attacked multiple times a session then I took them down to make my camp bigger and have only had a handful of attacks in the months since.
---
Is the fasnacht man mask worth anything ?
---
They wanted to discourage farming as a playstyle because it is objectively unfun and everybody who does it only does it for some twisted ideal about gaining social status in a video game.
---
Where did you find the access code? I found the note about the armory but no access code 
---
Can‚Äôt you use the same argument for all the 1 hit melee builds?
---
Thanks and good to know.  My alt is stealth rifleman, but I‚Äôll add shotgun perks as a backup.
---
Don‚Äôt use an all rise, it‚Äôs far too clunky to be effective against Mutants. Use a 40% faster swing speed weapon or a knife of some type and spin circles. They have bad turn speed, so if you spam attacks and walk in a circle around them, they fall over.
---
Conversely, you could just use an Instigating melee and finish the job in one hit.
---
#1 tip: don't ask on this board. 
---
Nice list of what the patch add/fixed. Is there a bug list of all the things Bathesda broke in this patch? Are all mutations working corectly? Do Bobby Pins weight 0.1 again?
---
I don't remember if it was a thing in 3 or not, but I know it was in 4. I want to say it was double HP and AP over normal Nuka Cola. 
---
I'm not unhappy with the $60 I paid for it, or the fact that I pre-orderd it. I got 200+ hours so far into the game, and still playing
---
in 700 hours of play..searching at least one every session..i got 1 cap
---
Yep, also in FO4 there was a robot you could give nuka cola too and get ice cold nuka cola back as well.
---
In Fallout 4, ice cold nuka had extra benefit compared to normal. 
---
Or just get every mutation, the sun kissed and photosynthesis perks and say goodbye to radiation for most of the say/night cycle
---
\*spoler\* i didn't see the note about the armory?  the access code is in a suitcase below the plane, tangled up in the red vine
---
Y‚Äôall ever got the legendary syringer from a 3 star enemy? It‚Äôs so legendary there‚Äôs no stars on it
---
Bethesda: Oh what's that? You want us to actually fix problems in our game? We're sorry to hear that! Here have an in game hat... that you have to pay for... that will probably cost more than the hat would in real life... did that fix it?
---
Yes that sucked. Gat is not a full auto machine gun, you crank it to fire it, it should definitely benefit from Martial Artist. They simply nerfed it that‚Äôs all. 
---
I know it's unpopular to say, but. This game from the start has seemed geared towards wanting players to kill each other, even though the premise of the game is we are meant to work together to fix Appalachia and rebuild a working world. This is a game that should have been a co-operative MMO, not a PvP arena. They could have quite easily had a better way to let players take each other on in events and contests with rewards that make it worth doing. Instead we have griefers who are so bored they just kill at random for almost nothing in return and then whine if anything is done to limit that ability.
---
25k is the max, where are you storing the remaining 1k?
---
I would say to take a pole of types of builds used. I'm willing to bet currently (at least on ps4) the must are bloodied melee. Just an hour ago my friends and I fought the girl (character) that had sentinel assassin gear and knew how to use it. At level 60. Option A said alt and B said no other logical answer. Then this person switched to assassin's cavalier gear. This relevant because I like to think that my friends and I are good players. I'm level 227 and my usual running mate is 259 and neither of us have a full set of either sentinel assassin's or Cavalier. They cost too much. So the only way we can keep up with people with this gear is, game knowledge, coordination and adaptability. What does it matter if you can vats someone or not if they can stand in one spot and not die? Want to balance the game and pvp? Turn sentinel and cavalier down from 15% damage reduction to 5%. But now I'm curious are period on other consoles having more difficulty with crit builds? Because damn, I would be a terror over there.
---
1. It‚Äôs in the games files and is Bethesda‚Äôs fault if it can be accidentally accessed.
---
2. It was an accident he didn‚Äôt abuse any glitches or use the terminal to get in.
---
3. He‚Äôs excited to share something he discovered with the community. It barely spoiled anything.
---
Chill out 
---
There's also various sacrificial alters dotted around the map, like this one
---
https://imgur.com/a/Qp37nay
---
I think they could easily do this through the pipboy. 
---
PETA, People Eating Tasty Animals
---
The spoiler flag exists for a reason.
---
It can spawn near Crevasse dam, same place you can get the witch costume plan
---
It's the best CAMP wrecking weapon in the game, you can try it out behind the golf Club, there always seems to be a CAMP there.
---
My alt is 58 and still hasn't finished the whitesprings ghoul quest. But getting inside was never a problem you just can't hang out around the edges. If they cleared out the ghouls from there as some over time change content . Then we could rent and use those private hotel rooms as stores since they are all the same size they could load you into your spot as the server fills up or register for caps like a workshop.
---
Please don't message me for this. I don't own Fallout 76 nor do I know u/levi447. I think his friend has the same name as me but in all-caps.  
---
Noted
---
Grahm's been more than milking Chally before you ever got there, should check yourself for super mutant STDs.
---
Post literally said "spoiler"  Perhaps next time you should heed the warning.
---
It‚Äôs on one of the drums in the first frat you visit. First floor in the living room
---
I can confirm seeing it on the side of the road near the Overseer's camp at the random spawn point next to the red truck.  
---
I was approaching from Flatwoods if that makes any difference. 
---
At least you found a Horde, most of the events I have travelled to recently won't trigger, or all enemies drop dead when I get there and I get the Quest completed notice, but no rewards, and nothing Lootable.
---
Same here
---
Someone's colkecting caps....
---
Of course, and that's what I said; that there other things that are extremely OP in PvP, like bloodied melee, that should be balanced.
---
Shine for 50 caps? You on Xbox by chance?
---
While at it, could you ask for haystacks/tractors to be bulldozable ?
---
I am in love with Aaronholt's garden but that tractor is slowly driving me insane.
---
The whole place is awesome but hardly usable because the haystacks and the tractor blocks the potential.
---
Pleaaaaaase *kitty eyes*
---
I have a level 27 ish  alt that is pvp only. He is very tanky and all the perks are for damage increase. I have killed several players that 2,3,4 x his level.
---
I can‚Äôt tell you what game mechanics allow that to happen. I can guess that Quality of Life perks and PVE perks take up a big chunk of some players builds. 
---
Typically a player can be vulnerable to radiation, explosive/fire damage. Anti armor perks help. As do stats on legendary items. 
---
Some players also use PVE tactics in PVP encounters. Melee will often rush with something like a super sledge thinking they are going go one shot a level 25 ish player. That is unlikely if the level 25 is instigating pvp. I can mitigate a lot of damage and avoid damage with passive perks.
---
Not only that but those used to pvp encounters can time other players attacks. It is not that hard to circle someone and avoid a super sledge while hitting them with a much faster and higher dps melee weapon.
---
Wait I think I‚Äôm at the wrong plane. Did you find the code in horizons rest?
---
I feel your pain. I‚Äôve adopted a ‚Äòshoot first as fast as possible‚Äô strategy any time anyone else shows up to an event (uranium fever). I‚Äôll switch weapons so I‚Äôm. It doing my max damage but I make sure that I get in there first. Some people don‚Äôt realize, some people don‚Äôt care but I gotta look out for me. 
---
Literal pools. They are tiny. Like 6ft square. 
---
If you did the scrap all option it still breaks down  bulk into its component factions, wasting your plastic
---
Agreed. I don‚Äôt play a lot of different games and my wife would certainly say I‚Äôve gotten more than enough time out of this one. 
---
Welcome back!
---
Waiting for the reditor chally to show up here. 
---
Get a life , it is our obligation to let others know what we have found in the game, even areas that aren't open yet. You really don't understand video games if you think this is bad. Every game has this sort of posting, if there is hidden content found it always get posted so players can speculate on whats to come.
---
Agreed. Favorite character by far. It reminds me of how good all the other fallout games were and makes me sad that it took them 5 months after launch to actually put some effort into giving us 1 decent NPC.
---
Make a couple good in-game friends that are like-minded and play in a team.  Horde events are one of our favorites.  I think I've gotten all of my best loot from hordes, not from nukes.  They happen a lot, and the boss is always 3 star.  With prestige levels on the horizon, were all looking out for our preferred gear, no matter what level.  The other day, I gave my friend a lvl 25 instigating/vats acc coach gun because she has a Calamity Jane shotgun alt.  We're also saving light-ish 3-star loot of any kind for the legendary vendor.  Ultralight mods on armor is pretty great.
---
We usually send one person to start the horde event, whoever is closest, then when the locations pop up we each go to a different spot until one of us finds the boss, then they kite it around until we all travel in and get our loot.  If a 3 star would actually drop 3 star loot all the time, that would be great.  Nothing in 76 is more of a letdown than getting wooden armor.
---
On a side note, doing a whitespring nuke in a team is 10000x better.  One person sharing squad maneuvers, one person sharing rad sponge, another sharing inspirational and the fourth sharing strange in numbers is pretty epic business.
---
Jesus Bethesda. Do you not play test any of this shit before you push it live?
---
I don't know about the test but for Biv you actually have to go talk to him
---
Not much of a spoiler either. Underground location, expected. Ghouls, expected. Quest tapes, expected.
---
It's literally just saying there is an accessible, mostly populated, unreleased part of the map. Fairly expected. It is surprising it is populated but... Meh.
---
It's cool the OP found it first. Hope they enjoyed themselves. 
---
Yeh them too 
---
Why wouldn't it be?   
---
Comment above also is false: "**DO NOT USE ANYTHING OTHER THEN FULLSCREEN!** Other modes are currently broken."  
---
None other mode ever worked before as well and suffered FPS drops. This is nothing new and posting 'old news' are never a good idea.
---
I saw on Twitter it spawned at the crevasse fast travel point... Trying to farm that now... 
---
like he said, it looks like a bug. If he hasn't played in months he wasn't logged in for the caps cap that was applied.
---
Medium and faster swing speeds are better for melee against blocking opponents. I regularly use a mole miner gauntlet and a powerfist and it's pretty easy to spam attack them until they stop blocking.
---
Sneak used to be mostly broken. It was supposed to get fixed but I havent played my Sneak-Sniper for awhile. I am interested in hearing about how it is now
---
Nukashine is starting to show me where "he" hid all the bodys in the woods.
---
I experienced this inside whitesprings. I was running around the whole place wondering "where the hell is this noise coming from"?
---
It was some loud mother f-er banging away on the tinkerers workbench down in artisans corner.
---
Nope
---
Can I ask a favor? Go into a team and check to see if your damage goes down with strange in numbers equipped. I too run the bloodied gauss and have lost about 100 damage from just the nerf. I understand why but that doesn't mean I like it.
---
Lol. I find SBs that are marked white instead of red and do not attack me. SB bros if you will. 
---
I had 3 of them flying over me in the bog a while back. I wasn't hidden btw.
---
I have a video of 3 non-hostile SBs but I'm too damn lazy to export from console, link, etc. 
---
There's a workbench just outside the uranium fever event, in the smaller room after the first set of double doors, so you can immediately scrap everything after the event finishes. 
---
I have been. Every time I log in, he's the last stop on my daily vendor run now. But when I would do my daily vendor run, I'd get dailies everywhere but the mire (I run watoga medical while vendor clearing). Now I get zero. 
---
This explains why I was constantly thirsty 
---
Sorry harry but I KOS your only friend. He is worth more dead than alive.
---
It‚Äôs been 25 years since the fridges had a Freon charge, no way they would still be functional.
---
where are you playing? i'm on xbox, made a couple of friends in the game, we could definetely play together if you are down for it!
---
Go play Fallout 4...,
---
You should have been better prepared to get a shot off knowing that may happen. Just because someone is low level does not mean they are a new player. I would have no qualms about taking the kill. Not from intentionally being an A-hole, just not going to wait for someone else to have their stuff together
---
So remove vats and your only way to get crits w/o the most random rng. Crits are what you need if you want to beat some of the higher tier armor/card effects. For those who don't know crits go trough effects like sentinel/cavalier. 
---
Without vats crits the sentinel assassins or cavalier will be the end all gear. With a a game that has so much rng in loot drops do you really want progress/power to be this one sided linear. Far less people will stand a chance vs "raiders" or grieving.
---
Fallout has mechanics that reward you without much input or effort. Stuff like vats or just legendary weapons/armor. With mechanics like these you will never have a experience w/o the occasional feeling of getting robbed/cheated. I'm not saying those mechanics are bad for this game persee. It just works strangely in pvp sometimes. It isn't as much of a issue because this isn't a competitive fps. It has some rock paper scissor mechanics that you can use/abuse at times (even vs vats users, sentinel, stealthboy).
---
tldr: it would make a lot of stuff irrelevent because it removes a counterplay.
---
39.99 at release. 
---
Yeah same. I switch to a 10mm which only does 40 or 50 damage and it feels like blowing peas through a straw at an enemy, but it's quick and fast enough to get a shot or 2 in just for these occasions. Obviously if i'm on my own then the good guns or Deathclaw gauntlet come out. 
---
I saw it just south of Appalachian Antiques near watoga, just server hopped a half dozen times at the antique shop and ran south to the random spawn point til i saw the balloons!
---
Extremely Sad, but thank you 
---
I find it funny that people still have issues with this game, like look, I get you don't get griefers, but come on, it's a online, live MMORPG in which the Devs for one reason or another made PvP a thing, that their is enough to tell anyone who has played such titles in the past 15+ years that there can and will be griefers.
---
Now destroying camps may be a pain in the ass and personally I don't partake in those types of shenanigans, however think of it from their perspective, most of the players who PvP or grief as you claim are not only doing what the Devs intended but are almost forced into doing it.
---
Now don't bite my head of and let me explain that statement, first off, think of how many hours these players have spent on some of their characters, then think of how bored they must be after clearing the same series of quests for the nth time.  Now take into consideration that unlike when the game first launched, less and less players are actually willing to engage in PvP simply because they don't want to waste the ammo and materials to fix their shit, want to chill solo or with their lower level friends and help them out or simply want to kill time until something else pops up.
---
Now when we look at twitch and YouTube streamers we see PvP quite a lot, but that only indicates that players are seeking them out specifically to get online attention and that's about it, so currently for players who wish to have a bit of PvP fun they are forced into attacking or as you so eloquently put it 'griefing' other players because they are no longer able to enjoy a feature that the Devs intended for us to make use of.
---
Now I'm not saying that's the case for every such player as we know their are some special snowflake few who do it because they enjoy pissing other players off because they were not hugged enough as a kid or had a slightly too friendly uncle, but the point is that just because you don't like it doesn't make it griefing, and look Bethesda are planning to change it because y'all bitched about this and that and I'm pretty sure that the new survival servers will be dead as hell because not enough people are willing to man/woman up and play the games entire content.
---
You guys can give me shit for this and be the players you claim to hate, you can take what I say with a grain of salt, but in the end, it's a fucking game, so go out, play the damm content and stop causing issues that will eventually lead to Bethesda just making the game worse.
---
The definition of "fun" is objectively subjective. After surfing weird corners of the internet enough, someone, somewhere will find something "fun", even if it's destructive. Farming in a game can be fun for A LOT of people. Hell some popular games are NOTHING but Excel formulas with graphics. Don't be this close minded.
---
"The effects of alcohol are doubled"
---
Those madlads were planning this from the start!
---
Tell me if that works out for you.
---
I DM'd
---
I am fine with it. They shouldn't just hand out the good stuff. At least now when you kill things it has chance at being something notable. It's been two days and I already upgraded three pieces of my newer toons gear. My main barely has anything good. Most people that did or do had bought it on eBay or had a friend that duped it. 
---
Sorry. Only just seen this message. Thanks for the offer, but Patch 7 fixed it!
---
Patch 7 fixed it!
---
I'm into that, except that there's like a million different magazines, only a dozen of which are slightly useful for an hour of gameplay.  The covers of Backwoodsman always make me laugh, because my Dad grew up in the 60's and had piles of pulp mags geared towards teen boys with similar garbage, and I collected Wacky Packages as a kid.
---
My wife‚Äôs main character did this last night now when she try‚Äôs to log in it just says disconnected from server and her her other characters are fine. This is on PS4
---
Do you remember the Smurfs? Little blue cartoon creatures. Well in online games they refer to a high level player who is playing on a low level character, usually for the express purpose of pvp. You saw the low number and underestimated your opponent who while under leveled probably has great gear and only perks that he needs. Add in vats crits and how stupidly cheap assassin's sentinel armor is and yep it sounds like you got smurfed. It happens to the best of us, don't beat yourself up about it. Hell it happened to be last night.
---
You're being disingenuous. How many first time players build their first character totally min/maxed from level one? 
---
The majority of (if not all) people need more than 50 levels to fill out perk cards and shift points.
---
Well, it wasn‚Äôt the Bloodied Legendary effect because my AA shotty was also reduced by 15%, and my Super Sledge, etc. 
---
Maybe it was just how Adrenal was scaling previously. Idk, but I‚Äôm missing 15% of my damage somwhere. Lol
---
yea, I ran across that too. I think they are 30s regardless of whos been around, so I skipped the mole miner location until I was 25-30...Be aware the shops area just beside TOTW has lots of mutants.
---
Approach top of the world from the north or west and you should be OK unless a high level has been around.  
---
Yes that is a peeve of mine too.  Hope that gets fixed soon!
---
I‚Äôm trying that now, is that south from the door or on the overall map.?
---
I do feel you need eat/drink more overall. Now it's just chug water, eat whatever if it's roasted (plenty of wood anywhere) and you are done. Don't feel survival at all. And it must be casual, than why we even have this? But what really bogs... too much stupid management with every 10 mins break for a food, none doing that in real life, even with day cycles running faster, it's too interruptive. I feel like we need much bigger buffer of "food hp".
---
Well you know that you yourself can indeed block the scorchbeast queen right? Totally shut down her lunge attack. Sure she still moved but doesn't hurt anyone and the tank still didn't lose aggro.
---
why would that fix it?
---
40%faster anti mutant deathclaw hand baby :D
---
I needed screws for a project at work, saw a fan on someones desk...
---
There is one that always spawns on top of west tek. Always. Just a novelty sorry.
---
Yup if you have it unlocked you should be able to scroll sideways for it, like you would furniture etc. 
---
A few plants have multiple models, corn and razorgrain being the two that stick out to me most. 
---
But you can just go farm then 
---
no i haven't checked,  w my luck 15 and two shots to fill the crit Gage since i run critical saavy i decided it was a waste either way. If i remember i will check later tonight. I have max rank. Reapers sprint however is working.  Just no animation and no audio.  
---
I would have killed them both, and if they seek revenge, or get lucky and kill me, then I will find their CAMP &amp; return the favor. Myself and a few friends keep a list of griefer crews (the ones that travel in groups because they can't handle 1 vs 1), when we spot one of them on our server we check on what they're doing, and if they're up to no good. we make them server hop.
---
I never wanted PvP in multiplayer Fallout, but I won't let it deter me from having fun.
---
Had a camp in the same area. Was fine after the patch but then yesterday I got the same message. "Moved" my camp to the exact same spot. Logged out and logged back in and got the message again. I decided to try someplace new. Spent 4 hours rebuilding my camp in a whole new location. Logged out and logged back in and got the same message again.
---
Every time I log out, the game refuses to rebuild my camp. It doesnt matter where I put it. What the actual fuck.
---
I play as a sneak sniper build. I was fortunate to find a piece of chameleon armor early in the game. I still wear my level 10 chameleon left arm even though I am level 55 because when I am crouched and still (not moving), I am invisible. I have a level 3 sneak card and an escape artist card (I think that is what it is called), too. I have had enemies walk right past me or right up next to me and not see me, including a scorch beast. My understanding is that with the mutation and weightless armor you become visible when you shoot. With chameleon armor you do not. Finally, it seems the bug where you were in ‚Äúcaution‚Äù even with no enemies around was fixed with the latest patch. So, I find chameleon armor and sneak very useful for my build. 
---
Also how far south?
---
I paid 60$ dollary doos I‚Äôm happy with that 
---
Read the roadmap 
---
Awesome, good to hear!
---
It's not in the game yet - planned update that'll introduce him is scheduled on may.
---
seems like the end of any game balance, since you could collect and craft all the best food trivially easily and have whatever buffs you want without having to worry about any restrictions for collecting things. 
---
I paid $40 shortly after release.  Happy with my investment
---
Does he launch frequently?
---
It is probably related to the new fermenting mechanic. Alcohol ferments as the condition bar drops (just like how food decays)
---
They probably sped it up so alcohol wouldnt take too long to make. And inadvertantly sped up decay in the process.
---
  I have a (non-mutant) cloaking chest piece - good DR and I go invisible for x seconds if hit.  Works when standing, so it helps a bit in melee as I can move away without the enemy knowing which way I moved.
---
The chameleon arm provides invisbility when I crouch, which is good for sniping.
---
I have a 1\* mutant cloaking piece, but it is low DR, and I'm rarely mutated, so that one doesn't do me much good.  Since it is a legendary, cant scrap it, nor can I sell it to a vendor.
---
Not saying it doesn‚Äôt happen on PC, but are all of these posts above camps getting griefed on console? Because I‚Äôve never experienced a griefer on PC, whether at my camp or out and about. My camp is r
---
I'm level 30 and have played almost entirely solo. Even though I've read about the tagging method a myriad of times, I worry that in the panic of facing a wendigo, I might've done the same thing. Tagging is a team without a team mindset that I fully want to participate in sometime, but I'm staying away from it until I'm much higher level and I'm the one letting the newbies get there tags in.
---
Pretty sure the whiteknights are the same teenagers that said fo4 was the perfect fallout game. 
---
I got it for really cheap my local stores had to many copies. 
---
Yes.
---
Yea that works. Instigating or Furious or Bloodied works better, but that‚Äôs honestly good there.
---
Well in my experience (ps4) everyone wants top tier weapons and gear. Or they are SEVERELY misinformed about what the best is. I still have people messaging me daily for TSE weapons. I used to put prices with everything but nowadays I just post what I have and ask for offers. If they ask for a price then I don't answer. But nearly everything is on alts just to carry the weight and if it doesn't sell, oh well. The legendary vendor will be here in two months and I'm patient enough to wait.
---
Its not illegal in the us so he can't be sued only banned
---
I would make it but, who the hell has cardamom pods and star anise?
---
Made Quantum though, that was delicious. 
---
That could work but of course it would need a cool down once swapped off. Though most of us who are passive just want our own servers. 
---
how fucking brain dead dumb do you have to be to defend a game because it lags in a certain resolution mode. 
---
Fair enough mate 
---
I ended up in that Mire treehouse on my last one. Good times.
---
You will have to wait until next month for that.
---
You earn my upvote with "and one rad rat". Thanks for the chuckle.
---
Disagree. Patch broke my wiring setup, and now it no longer works at all. 
---
It's kind of sad honestly that they let people like you play again. Should have banned you forever because you cheated. 
---
Yep sucks
---
Im still on the fence on whether to buy it or not, but that last sentence is the whole reason why it seems like a great game imo. A super accurate apocalypse experience 
---
Or because they have a rifle build and need a decent rifle to play with and not a stalkers pool cue with barbed wire glued to it.
---
Funny that you say that because for the last 4 months the only 2 ways in the game to get level 50 gear has been by nuking fissure prime and the Whitespring. Next to the original 'loot cave' in Destiny.......I can't thinking of anything closer to endless farming than hacking away at weak ass bloated ones for hours at a time.
---
Let's discourage farming because we don't want people with a twisted ideal about gaining social status in a video game............. let's make the end game a bunch of ghouls who ate so easy to kill that you actually have to try not to kill them so that everyone else can get a hit on them.
---
This patch broke a shitload of things regarding camps. The powered keypad door opens without power and never closes.
---
My camp gives me an error saying that an update has prevented my camp from being placed - everywhere. No matter where I place my camp, as soon as I log out it is gone forever.
---
I'm pretty sure I got mine from sunny top station. I looked for this plan for awhile too.

Here it is:

This vendor is a random spawn now at most likely all the "field" spawn points (I was able to get it at the overseers camp in a few hops). I haven't seen if he spawns at the road spawn points yet.
---
Paid 80 EUR for the tricential edition and would do it again. More than worth the money so far. And I am still getting new content üòÅ
---
Spoiler is right in the subject line, thanks!
---
Well, in 22 minutes when you're done with quests, that'll change.
---
I am having the same issue. Tried 5 different locations last night and every time I log out and log back in a get the same message. I literally cannot place my camp anywhere without it disappearing the next time I log in.
---
This is incredibly frustrating. Beth needs to get their shit together.
---
Super weird because mine is going super slow now. I was able to play for a good long while before needing to drink, and I only ate when first loaded in. I was really excited because I thought they were finally realizing how dumb and time consuming food and water are.
---
I found it while exploring, I know its South of Lake Eloise and West of the camp with the dead body catapults. It looks like it may be Vault 96.
---
I think the exploit they mentioned was infinite crits you got by activating crit in VATS then back out then go back in VATS and use crit shot without losing crit meter. Repeat and you had infinite critical shots.
---
Or maybe don‚Äôt be a dick.
---
Thanks dad!
---
The legendary Vendor is still at home, hoping his job interview went well, waiting for the call to come in.
---
Jesus Christ. Y‚Äôknow, I wanted to support Bethesda and all, but fuck this. They haven‚Äôt fixed even the most simple shit since launch all those months ago. Now I can‚Äôt even enjoy the one thing left in this game that I enjoyed doing because they took something that mostly worked and broke it more. To hell with them, I‚Äôm getting a refund. 
---
I have tried 5 different locations and I get that message every time I log out and back in. There is literally nowhere I can place my camp now. It is completely broken.
---
I paid 30 bucks a pop on Black Friday for 2 xbox physical copies for my wife and I. 
---
Upgraded my install to the Tricentenial for $20 after 100 hours played.
---
Now sitting at 400 hours played and would have paid twice that for all the fun I have had in this game.
---
Your mistake is believing that "level 50 gear" or "MUH BUILD" is relevant. It's not. Everyone else hates you people.
---
If it is fun why do you all complain about it incessantly?

Your momma!

He doesn't have his own caps and is tied to another faction, I'm not sure which because I had already done my cap run for the day. I can tell you he does give back a fraction of your when you buy from him.

Due south of Spruce Knob, 2/3 as the crows flies to them little hills by the bear. Jest follow 103 south past R&amp;G station, and when the road runs out, ask Molly. She'll get you there.
---
You're suggesting reporting other players for attacking your camp? This was an intended aspect of the game. You don't have to like it, but reporting them is just dumb.
---
&gt;  it's shitty this stuff still happens
---
I mean, it's no fault of Bethesda's...
---
Remeber that camos are destructible to stop people being trapped inside them by other players
---
Dude this is what I'm saying. I've never had my camp attacked in over 200 hours of play time either. How are people acting like they cant play without getting thier camp leveled? 
---
Its not satire. I genuinely wreck camps, kill people, all day. Thats all i do in this game. I look for PvP. Its not greifing. Imo people like you dont underatand the game you are playing and its your fault your upset about your camp.
---
When did i say anything about doing it for kicks? Its very profitable, killing players is challenging and fun. Im at the cap limit, i have more junk than you can imagine. Its all from Survival PvP. Because i bought a PvP survival game, so thats how i play it.
---
Imo you guys are in the wrong and its Bethesdas fault for rolling the game out without a seperate PvP server.
---
Its not about you or making you salty. I could care less.  i enjoy this engine, fallout and most of all PvP . 
---
I do not think ive ever greifed anyone. Theres a certain willful arrogance to playing this game and ignoring the fact that it was advertised as a cops n robbers sandbox. Im just raiding! 
---
Honestly it might be a good idea to create Pacifist only servers like everquest did before. You can start all new players off as pacifist only. and in order to be PVP you would have two conditions:
---
1. You would have to opt into PVP, once done, it cannot be undone for that character.
---
2. There would be PVP areas where when you enter the area you become PVP, even if you haven't opted for PVP. that way people can still agree to duel without becoming PVP entirely. I can't say how to implement an arena type area lore wise without involving raider factions like Nuka World but I think this is the best solution for FO76
---
Finally got it to work after drinking vintage lead champagne 
---
Not too far (30 sec sprint) due south from the map marker, it is in a swampy area, you will see a variation of enemies in that spot, a really small island looking piece of land with shallow water around.
---
Found the code but not the terminal to use it in...where is it ?
---
Ok so basically chameleon armor is better than the chameleon mutation. I wonder if the mutation is viable at all for any situation 
---
I do it only when your home. Its a way to get you to want to attack me or raise a bounty so someone else attacks me. 
---
That initates PvP. I made 6000 caps last night PvPing. Theres your purpose right there: PvP survival &amp; profit!
---
I mean I thought so, but there are carcasses of fish in fallout 4 200 years after the bombs fell which should be decomposed by 200 years so they must have been from recently in the timeline, and Appalachia‚Äôs forests aren‚Äôt that damaged so perhaps they could be Alive and thriving in West Virginia.

Damm it‚Äôd be nice to have a list like that.

I don‚Äôt get camp Grieved as I‚Äôm in a central but remote location so it generally isn‚Äôt a problem for me.  
---
Should just be able to server hop to launch one straight away. Not sure of what the time is for launching one back to back from the same silo in a server. 
---
The "Scrap All Junk" option currently scraps Bulk Junk.
---
Bethesda is working on a system to make this not happen, but it is currently needed so that Mods are not consumed while Crafting/Repairing, and Bulk is Consumed while Crafting/Repairing.  It was introduced about 2 patches ago when they made loose Mods no longer get consumed while Crafting/Repairing (Cause loosing that X01 Jetpack or Calibrated Shock in your Stash because you repaired your Camp walls or something really sucked).
---
Currently the only option is to make sure you do not carry Bulk Junk around with you.  Place it in your Stash.
---
That would not be in Bethesda's best interests.  To keep you playing, they added the grind of build-scrap-learn.  If you knew when to stop, you **would** stop.  Collector and completionist players would quickly lose interest in the game once they find everything. 
---
Ban people for doing what the game encourages them do? We dont have to like it, but cmon. 
---
what mod is it exactly 
---
It‚Äôs your mods. Rename your customini to get rid of them until the creators can update. I don‚Äôt know which one it is that does it. 
---
What about dogmeat? lol

He's on Vacation to Virginia, should be back in state sometime in April.

Is it the island with a crashed satellite on it?

Point of order! Some base locations get attacked daily without turrets. I'm south of Harpers Ferry (it's 2 caps to FT) and my base without turrets or any kind of defense got attacked by a combination of Super Mutants and Scorched, DAILY!! Two days ago I built me some missile turrets on my roof and I was still getting base damage from them. Added a spotlight on the ground and now my turrets are killing machines. No more base damage.
---
already updated one wich is better inventory but thanks i will try to see wich ones it are
---
My Tipsy Agility test is also broken :(
---
Any of them really.  There are numerous threads on how to fix it via modifications to the cutsom ini file.
---
The inventory management and sorting mods also need to be removed or updated because they cause a lot of problems with the new update due to changes in the inventory system.
---
The guy states that new characters are able to get the daily quests as normal.
---
thanks i must have missed others posting about this issue 
---
Some of my lights don't work anymore, I have a hell of a time placing wires onto power connectors, and I cant place new power connectors. 
---
They said this like 2 weeks after the game was released lol
---
As much hate as the game got and continues to get, I do enjoy it in the times that I do play it. I have even bought the PS4 and PC versions of the game. I only play the PC version now. 
---
I can't say I get really far into the game (highest was only about level 15) and I hate pvp with a passion, so stayed always in Pacifist mode. But I did enjoy it. 
---
I only really stopped playing the PS4 version because I was getting bored of playing it solo as I didn't have any friends that I could adventure with. 
---
ye already updated better inventory
---
This isn't a bug.  Legendary Robots in Watoga blow up almost always.  Anywhere from instantly to about 10 seconds after death.
---
I farm Legendaries in Watoga often, and always stay away from them until they blow up, or until 15 seconds have passed.
---
  I think its cool Bethesda chose to display someones CAMP in the opening screen.  
---
 Look at the horizon - it is level.
---
So the odd angle is the camera position relative to the topograpy where that camp is located.    
---
If the camera were positioned more to the left when the shot was taken, then the CAMP would be square with the screen
---
Why have i not come up with this idea myself. I like it.

I saw a video where they confirmed it nukes surrounding caves so probably

‚ÄãI am currently unable to access my level 199 character. I have invested over 400 hours into my save file. I have read on reddit that it can be a problem with the fermentation machine. Please fix Bethesda. I dont wanna quit but i cant find it in myself to restart.....
---
Was there some type of foliage addition that came with this update ? I've had my camp at the same spot for months now with a tree in front of my  base that had a bare limb.....now  that bare limb has branches and leafs on it destroying the inside of my base....this is disheartening to say the least...I've had to rebuild my base multiple times because of quirks or bugs that this game has produced since launch and it's to the point where I give up....its little shit like this.....awww fuck it I was going to say some more but does it fucking matter smh........
---
Really? I've never noticed it before. They have always exploded a few seconds after death, which is normal. But never instantly each and every time... 
---
I think you may have misunderstood stood, look at the top right corner where the wild Wasteland logo should be üòã
---
Why must Bethesda do everything? Would this not be solved by server jumping? Not trying to be a dick, but it seems this board expects help with ever little thing when some things can easily be solved on our own.
---
Brownouts, brownouts never change...
---
You are drawing more power than you are making.  Add more generators or upgrade them.  The fusion generator will power your entire camp no matter what because it puts out 100 (the same amount of power as 10 large or 20 small generators).
---
It's a short (length) church pew
---
I've only killed a few since the update since I have been busy doing other stuff.  Yesterday I had one blow up instantly behind Phoenix.  Then the tube spawned another one right away and I killed it, seem to recall it taking a few seconds to blow up even though the first took off right away.
---
I guess if you are going thru and seeing EVERY single legendary blow up instantly upon death maybe something is up?  But I didn't notice every one of the three or so I killed in the last two days doing it.
---
Nah he's talking about legendary bots exploding instantly after getting killed. I noticed the change as well. Before patch it was anywhere between 1 to 10 seconds as you mentioned, but now, it's insta

Title is cringey af and misleading as there is no actual question in your post. 
---
try terminal in the crashed plane's cabin. where did you get code?
---
If someone adds you as a friend (even though you don‚Äôt add them back) they can follow you on other servers and just constantly attack you. The issue is that they get into large groups to do it, so you can never block them all

no one knows at the moment apart from maybe maduin81
---
He wanted to know why he got a bounty for killing a player when he didnt initiate the attack. Which rewarded the higher level hostile player with caps when he took the bounty
---
Oh!  Yea, I was appreciating the overall shot, so didn't notice the pixellation in the inset.
---
No problem!
---
That reads as rhetorical and it‚Äôs also sandwiched in the end of the post with you answering your own rhetoric
---
Bulk will still break down if it is in your stash 
---
Try the blackberries again, but start with the rug on dirt outside, then move the rug indoors.  If that doesn't work, try putting it on a potted plant - they seem to help with the plants that go deep into the dirt.
---
I just eat spoiled food without the lead belly perk. Disease cures are plentiful.
---
I don't know if they've perhaps widened the 'No Build Zone' around all structures and marked locations but forgotten to not actually let you place your C.A.M.P. there or if this is a wider camp location problem :/ Very frustrating though, as you say.
---
\*Watoga
---
No it will not.  If you choose "Scrap All Junk" it only scraps junk in your Inventory, not your Stash.
---
Bulk in your Stash WILL be consumed by repairing and crafting.  But this is by design.  It will NOT be consumed by Scrapping all Junk if you keep it in your Stash.
---
Oh okay, yeah, it's happening on every legendary robot I've come across so far. 
---
My camp is in the middle of nowhere and since I made this move several weeks ago it hasn‚Äôt been attacked once albeit by a roving scorchbeast from time to time. 
---
When at Flatwoods or Whitespring people would constantly mess with me and my camp and at that time I was probably lvl 80 so not like I couldn‚Äôt defend myself. 
---
I‚Äôve resigned myself to the fact it‚Äôs part of the game.  Just this morning I got jumped twice on two separate occasions and servers while farming ghouls at WS.   The first time around I didn‚Äôt see him or her coming and basically got ganked.  The second time around I did see it coming and I really didn‚Äôt want to throw down so I bounced.  It‚Äôs the choices you have to make and I‚Äôm now lvl 138 so it‚Äôs not just lower level players that people want to mess with. 
---
There are times PVP can be fun especially when it‚Äôs not someone lurking or hiding or if multiple players are involved.  But hiding out or cloaking and then one shotting from a distance is pretty lame.   Even worse are the tools that try to pretend they want to trade and then start blasting.  No thanks 
---
Pretty much most games have a form of alcohol in them at this point. Especially RPGs. Cant not make content because other people decided to further themselves in a poor choice.

I‚Äôve been plying since beta and I can tell you that a lot (not all) of the issues that plagued the game at the beginning have been resolved.  Stuff always pops up but I won‚Äôt spend 300+ hours on a game that I hate. If the idea of fallout with friends is appealing to you, buy it today. 
---
It was scrapping my stored bulk before I figured out the change. It won't scrap stored junk, but it was definitely scrapping my stored bulk.
---
You can only build 1 fermenter per camp. Don't know about what you'd have to do after it fermented, I threw some Fermentable Nukashine and Fermentable Beer in there yesterday and then closed the game. I'll see how it comes out tomorrow.

Taming critters is pretty cool.  I‚Äôve not done it but I‚Äôve seen other players including one camp with a deathclaw lol

Was this written by a 12 year old?

A rhetorical...question.

So there was a question.

Care to answer it?

Purposely written to antognise the person incase they are on here.

Mutated Spiked puffer fish granades similar to pumpkin granades but they stick to what ever they are thrown at 
---
When I continually said I'm not interested and asked them to move on over area chat, offered no PvP engagement and gave no and angry emotes, yet they continued to smash up my camp, yeah I reported them.
---
If I engaged after they punched me 20 times or got a bounty from smashing my stuff, no problem.  That's within the rules.  When I speak in area chat and emote that I'm not interested, how hard is it to move on and find someone else to bait?  When they get mad that I don't want to play their game and start smashing my rad shower out of spite/frustration, which is obviously instigating behavior, after me using all the available options to signal no, I just reported them for harassment.
---
It's like my daughter saying "no" on a date.  Just move on and there's no harm and no foul.  I was a teen once, and I'm no fool as to what she and her boyfriend are up to.  Luckily, he's a good kid with a generous heart.  If my daughter ever said no and wasn't acknowledged, you can bet that I'd deal out a hell of a lot more than a harassment warning.
---
Just be respectful, even if you're looking for PvP.  Don't intentionally fuck with players that are clearly not interested.  Maybe I worked a 14 hour shift and just want to put some new signs up in my camp and vendor before eating dinner at 10pm and falling asleep while watching sportscenter.  I don't need some disgusting clown punching me at the end of a long day.

I'm having this same issue. Can't scope, unsure why. I do have mods, but you don't, so I'm assuming that's not the issue.

What about the ability to have extra perks, the longer in game time to get better equipment?
---
You are saying there is no difference between a play with the hours to get to 60 and the hours to get to 170?
---
Fair one if that's what you think.
---
No, it does not.  I keep all my Bulk in my Stash, bulking it up and selling it once I run out of excess Aid and Legendaries.  I have had 80 Bulk Plastic and 60 Bulk Rubber in my Stash for the last 3 weeks and it remains untouched.  I build up a full days 1400 caps worth of Bulk junk in my stash and keep it there for days on end.
---
Only Bulk in your Inventory is scrapped with Scrap all Junk.  It won't scrap ANY junk, bulk or otherwise, in your Stash.  It only scraps Junk in your inventory.
---
Cheers dude.
---
I've noticed that my charactor gets thirsty quicker, I haven't noticed any issues with food spoiling, I also have good with salt.

ive had the same problem, just putting bulk in my stash via the add all junk to stash button breaks it down. Maybe it needs to be done individually.

Id get in on this...and post when i nuke. 
---
That shouldn't be the case since players are already paying caps for the fast travel, it should be one or the other, not both.
---
Ture, but I never asked myself this question concerning the drugs in the game. Maybe because they don't have names like the drugs we know in our real world, despite the similarities with psychopharmaca, tranquilizers and so on.
---
Ok so really you just came here to vent frustration because someone likely recently just stole your purified water.

So much vitriol in your initial post that I doubt any of that happened.

Also the definition of rhetorical is to ask a question to make a point not to get an answer.
---
You want attention and people to give you virtual high fives for a likely fake story.  
---
I just called you out on it. 
---
/shrug
---
Good, good. Now it's time for them to git gud.
---
That terminal in the crashed plane is for the safe onboard
---
It happens.  Like I said earlier in this thread it‚Äôs fight or flight.  
---
I don‚Äôt care for the 3-4 player griefing teams because more often than not they will prevail against a single player regardless of what level you are.  I‚Äôm always leery when I see a group together outside of a nuke zone because chances are they might be up to no good and planning to gank.  
---
cool, so I just have to capture every workshop then go stand in a closet somewhere and walk away from my computer and I can just lock down everything forever? 
---
You did in beta, I got a one star shoulder.
---
Well I killed him twice and stole his stuff.
---
Soooooo...not frustrated? Smug really.
---
I want an answer, that's why I asked a question,, that's why I repeated it and why I asked you to answer it.
---
Would you like to wade in on if you think I should have been charged caps for retaliating and killing someone?
---
Sc...scorched mariachi bands? 
---
That was not my intent, sorry for that. 
---
It was also not my intention to criticize Bethesda, or saying things like this shouldn't be in video games.
---
So edgy.
---
It worked for me. I can confirm. Work up, saw the post on Twitter, tried it myself, and got it to spawn about 7 server hops minimum 
---
It bothers me sooooo much.. glad its not just me. 
---
Like the sweet low level modded ski sword that killed the aggressive person!
---
&gt; Maybe because they don't have names like the drugs we know in our real world
---
Of course.  Real names.  I know my college days were filled with blackout nights caused by Nukashine!  So traumatizing to relive that in a video game.
---
Don't care what you did or didn't do. If you were banned or not. Could care less about your opinions.
---
Fick off
---
ESAD
---
Your writing style is so 14 year old neck beard
---
I know. I'm saying I wish it was free. It makes getting to places a lot slower when fast traveling has no disadvantages to other players if I'm not interacting with anyone. 
---
Exactly like that. 
---
100% on purpose. I'm glad I nailed it.
---
I have a tamed deathclaw and I call him Fluffy....lol 
---
Most builds have their necessary perks around 50-58, especially if you use the build planner. As for equipment, there's always the dozens of trading groups that are available, so it wouldnt be surprising if a level 55 can kill a 200+ player
---
Whoop!
---
No troll, lifted suspensions started this morning apparently.
---
Here is a novel idea Bethesda.
---
You built your base and another player destroys it, it‚Äôs free to fix.
---
You built it and an npc destroys it, you have to pay to fix it double what it is currently. That way you actually are forced to use strategy building your base.
---
Really? Even though they have had more time to access the dozens of trade groups? Time to refine there style and their perks?
---
I have never used a build planner, any good ones?
---
Was all this before or after you got up to take a pee? 
---
It‚Äôs hard to get back into the same dream state once you wake up. 
---
*weigh in on
---
I see your activity on men‚Äôs rights. I feel bad for snooping but I think it may be more than just an act. 
---
Sucks dude. 
---
I dont know I think everybody clapping woke me up, so maybe it was a dream!
---
saw another post on reddit and a user shared an image of his inventory which contains dome key 7.
---
He hinted that you have to start at the tangled crashed plane.  I have found a note on a chair and an access code in a suitcase at the site, but can't figure out where to go next.
---
Yup, I had to rebuild my entire base since the blueprints the made only covered half of my buildings.
---
Yeah, I'm with you, I haven't noticed a difference in food meters or food spoilage. Seems the same as it's been for at least a few weeks. I think it has changed at some point since the game was first released but I don't think this patch changed anything.
---
Haha well just have a read of my other posts, it's not snopping, see if my writing style is the same.
---
I'm genuinely chuffed you got what I was trying to put across. 
---
I'd be pleased with a canine companion like most of the previous games. 
---
Now to get him and Rose to communicate.
---
Huh that‚Äôs weird, I haven‚Äôt found anything but I bet they did break stuff
---
And that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre all here.
---
Really sorry about your bubble kid
---
Great post!
---
where does the quest start?
---
I think we're starting to see the potential with the new distilling workstation.
---
You can drop items in it to ferment, and they're still in your stash while also being visible in the actual workbench.
---
So it seems logical they could follow up by having specific item-type containers that do things like keep food from spoiling, or turn a drink into a chilled variant of it, while still using stash space.
---
What bubble is that mister?
---
If you have a mic, use it.
---
Actually, gathering everything without scrapping will lead to overencumbrance very quickly, at which point the AP regen cards will be very useful.
---
Alway check the overseers cache and the suitcases at train stations.  Higher levels will leave stuff there.
---
Scrap whatever you gather - it'll reduce weight, guve you mods to weapons, garner some XP, and provide materials for armor and weapon repair.
---
When you start finding them, you only need to collect 1 power armor frame for now.  Given you can't used PA until level 15 - and if you arent high enough level, you cannot leave the pieces on the frame, you have to store them separately, they'll add weight very quickly.  Do take the fusion cores :)  
---
Until you get a couple specific perks, PA will eat them very quickly.
---
Melee weapons are good - fireaxe, machete, barbed baseball bat were my favorites.
---
When you die, any junk you are carrying (which is most of what you pick up),  is dropped into a paperbag.  You'll have to go back and find the bag, which is not always clearly marked, especially if you die again before picking it up.
---
If you find screws, keep them.  They are limited quantity drops, and you'll need a lot of them later.
---
That would be the only reason my brother would even touch fallout lol. He is obsessed with fishing
---
It happened to me very recently.  A lvl 70ish basically 2 shotted me and I‚Äôm maxed out on shotgun build and I hit him 3-4 times and his damage barely moved.  My T60 has all the mods and basically did nothing. 
---
I‚Äôm assuming the other person was running an assasin/sentinel build because I can decimate most things in 1-2 shots.  Had a known I could have switched over to my modded anti armor 50 cal or prime Gauss rifle but too little to late. 
---
I know people don‚Äôt like to hear it but some of the armor builds are still out of balance. 
---
The one that popped when your story fell through
---
I‚Äôll check in about 10 hours (just starting my workday)
---
Well its nice to see that the bans are lifting at least. Ill check mine when i get home. Does this mean they finally patched the dupe glitch, god i hope so. Lol. Was pissing me off, was still seeing people with duped items as of last week. 
---
Its 100% a true story.
---
I think it was you.....
---
Honestly though, care to answer my question?
---
Same. I've done this 4 times now and nothing happens....
---
I didn't even remember hearing it when I used it.
---
GF was using my workbench in my house while I was planting outside and I thought some sort of new robotic creature was sneaking up on us in the dark. 
---
You can already tame animals and creatures but they just stay and defend your camp. 
---
just put the fishing from animal crossing in. 
---
I got this outside of whitesprings on the cliff edge, I just server hopped and all was good, no issue.
---
They should just split servers between PVE and PVP. On the PVE servers we only need to add a system to workshops. I suggest that we have a system where someone can bid to take your workshop from you, and if you want to keep it you have to place a higher bid within a certain time limit. I'd love to play without worrying about dicks ruining my fun.
---
Your right I forgot about that lol
---
Sounds more like a feature than a bug to me!
---
Thank you, amongst all that cheesy waffle was a question, glad you spotted it.
---
Do you know what that happened?
---
All I can tell you is it took over 600 hours before I ran into one and managed to kill it. It showed up while I was doing the Trick or Treat quest at The Pumpkin House. Others have said you just need to wander the map and pay attention, he doesn't attack just pops in near you and watches. Hope this is some help.
---
Odd, I was testing that *for just a bit* last night, and none of the legendaries I fought insta-popped like that for me (with or without stars).  Some didn't explode at all, though that's what I experienced before the patch.  Seemed exactly the same as before.
---
This is ranged though, I don't *think* that being in melee makes a difference, but it is certainly possible.
---
Maybe they've changed it last patch, but last time it was random - some allowed me to get to the body, loot it and go away and some didn't even exploded. I've never found one which would exploded immediately upon death. 
---
Emergency protocols mod reduces incoming damage by 50% while under 20% health it works really well with my bloodied heavy weapons build 
---
No because I don‚Äôt believe your story.
---
Hopefully by the time you are out of middle school you can write better.
---
Much luckier than me haha
---
Satellite, vertibird, deathclaws,
---
No vendor yet
---
Game has changed a lot since I had the issue.  But back in Nov/Dec I setup my player home a little North of the Northern most savage divide Train Station.
---
Had at least 3 encounters with it in my yard during my dump&amp;resupply runs.
---
Because it's subjective and the vocal minority (exteme minority) is ALWAYS the ones that complain ?
---
They'll fuck up again give it time
---
100% confirmed.
---
I killed you and your sad!
---
Pretend you think the story did happen...hypothetically...Why would I be charged for killing an aggressive player?
---
It shows a lot of gamer angst and that‚Äôs usually an effort to placate players who feel wronged somehow.
---
Even if you say it‚Äôs true there‚Äôs just zero reason to have faith in you.
---
Go to a train station and look for a frat house party poster and read it.
---
I guess I just am getting lucky then, I've had a few dozen bases and the only attacks I've had were when I had turrets. Just lucky, now if I could make that luck work for the last X-01 calibrated shock I need. Lol
---
Thank you for the communication!  We all appreciate you keeping us in touch.
---
Hmm.. read about a place the other day that had a new dual card reader, cant find the link at the moment, maybe this is what leads up to the key for the new TNT dom 7 ? :)
---
Okay, if you wann scold me because I never got the idea to ask this before, fine. 
---
Mea culpa!
---
I wasnt saying you made me think of it like a bad thing just that it's truly never been a thought in my mind Haha that was in my early teens and I'm just starting to Crest my early/late 20s I'm long past those things :)
---
Well I'm glad they're getting another chance to enjoy the game they paid for.  And before some of you vote me all down into oblivion; remember that we don't all get our cars taken away permanently after our first speeding tickets.
---
kek
---
The medic pump seems to trigger repeatedly with no cooldown when your getting mobbed, not sure if it‚Äôs meant to have a cool down or not but it‚Äôs very handy and I can just concentrate mon swinging my axe lol
---
Oh I'm not a gamer. I am a fully grown married man with a job that plays games for fun.
---
Having a bit if a laugh on a Friday while my sons at school.
---
Not really big on exclusionary labels.
---
Sorry you read to much into and felt offended as a "gamer within the community"
---
Final chance to prove your absolute mastery of this game and all its secrets...
---
Why did I get a bounty for retaliating against an attack?
---
I'm very happy with my price of nothing for it. Xbox one stopped working bought the new xbox 1x and it came with it. I'm not super hard core but have around 250 hours so was well worth the price.
---
I would love this so much. I may not like fishing in RL but in video games it is my true addiction. Put this in and I‚Äôm hooked for life.
---
I guess that's what we get for Bethesda choosing an inexperienced dev team for 76
---
What platform? 
---
That's because the condition bar didn't properly update while you were playing not because it's spoiling while you're offline.
---
I have noticed food degrade insanely fast.  
---
I guess it‚Äôs back to Salisbury steaks and canned dog food  for me. 
---
Dear Devs,
---
Upon loading a character give us two options to pick from:  PvE or PvP.  The selection will determine which group of worlds to route the character to.  That is all.
---
[You aren't actually milking it, it's attacking you!!!!](https://youtu.be/1IPBkUtziMg?t=123)
---
  Rad resistance in a nuke zone, non-toxic air in the ash heap and toxic valley,  (although the gas mask does that), DR when fighting a horde of higher level enemies, more carry weight.
---
One of the weight reduction perks drops them from 3# each to 0.3# each, although not sure if that applies to just what you are carrying, or your stash as well.
---
I am near a spawn point but for teh first few weeks they wouldn't wonder over, then a few weeks ago they started to.
---
Related and oddly enough I'm 99% sure I have a X-01 Calibrated Shock mod. I'm at work, and it'll be 8 hours before I can get home and check, but if I have it, I would sell it to you.
---
no number, that's interesting. Could we be getting a Vault 88 type DLC, I would love to build a vault as a workshop.
---
Ok I will just wander around for 300 more hours then
---
Yep! Im clean for 12 years. I neck booze in this like fish, but I have never thought about consuming alchohol because of a game. 
---
I have to agree. Nothing is worse than coming home from from a long day of exploring the wastes, when you health is low and your rads are high, only to find a leveled CAMP.  
---
It may be the diabetes. Damn you Nuka Cola!
---
It‚Äôs been added in the update we think. No one knows for sure but I think it‚Äôs related to the underground locations teased in the trailer. One of them looked like a vault interior. 
---
Agreed pre-ordered/$60 about 500 hours in not at all upset about what I paid for it. 
---
They have said they are looking into having pacifist mode protect your camp from damage. 
---
Oh your not a gamer? 
---
Oh.  My bad.  I assumed you played video games.
---
Big truth here.  Why are you here if you don‚Äôt play games? 
---
Lol exclusionary labels.  
---
You are exactly what I said you are.  Digging in deeper doesn‚Äôt obfuscate that.  
---
Go on.  I bet you single handedly killed a scorched queen with a pipe pistol too.
---
Hero!
---
The ongoing hate for this game is not justified. Fallout 76 has become the Nickelback/Justin Bieber of video games. You'd think from the public commentary that it was truly a dumpster fire. People hate it because people hate it. They aren't even playing the game. Youtubers hate monger the game for subscriptions and views. They've been steadfastly fixing bugs and adding new content. Despite claims that nobody is playing there are [at least a couple million](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6OWNNxTBMAsMmIwGOs8U8/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-november-27-2018) actively playing the game. This game has a future.
---
&gt; I am playing solo and have yet to build a base 
---
This is one of the best parts, you should definitely get around to doing this eventually.
---
Yay?!
---
Don't you just love the twang when the guitar sword connects ?  :)
---
Same. I hammered a Legendary in Watoga last night and he instantly exploded on me. 
---
A normal person would just make the fucking correction using EDIT. 
---
Tesla chest is nice for tagging in white springs without killing everything to share the wealth. 
---
It's weird, I have that perk, crafted 3 soups yesterday at login, and after a few hours playing they haven't even spoiled enough to see it on the bar.  I have the speed demon mutation, I've heard that may be an issue (though I thought it was making things spoil faster).
---
&lt;s&gt;Yeah brewing, fermenting, and consuming alcohol in a post apocalyptic world is over the line. &lt;/s&gt;
---
Pardon me while I get high on Psycho, decapitate another player, then eat his body, in preparation for launching a nuclear weapon.
---
A blanket separation of reality from fiction is recommended when partaking in entertainment.  Whether the medium is video games, movies, or even books.  If you are unable to do so, then the question is where do you draw the line for offensive content.  The recent article regarding STEAM and Rape Day is a pretty good example in my opinion.
---
Personally I equate acceptable content with the MPAA Ratings system (that's the Movies folks), PG-13 content is pretty standard fare, R Content is main stream enough to still release in all major movie theaters and get a large audience.  Violence, Language, Substance abuse all fall under those two categories, Fallout is clearly targeted at the R audience level.  Aforementioned Rape Day would be X Rated, extremely limited market and not something most businesses want to be associated with.
---
I would imagine since you can still take damage,
---
Unless they invincible flag it for players, some melee pure build could just walk up and koolaid man the walls
---
Got him right now if you want to join on PS4 though 
---
Look for patch notes that is what helped me. 
---
I think this argument is as false as the argument that video games cause violence.
---
Yeah that seems cheap.  
---
to buy a quantum from the vendor it‚Äôs almost 60 caps alone.   Thankfully I‚Äôve been hoarding quantum‚Äôs ( collecting not buying)  since beta.  I had just over a hundred by the time brewing started. 
---
Is this even as big of a problem as people make it seem? I have almost 600 hours played and have never had my camp attacked 
---
It would be nice to have some use for the bodies of water in this game. The game would feel more alive with radioactive marine life swimming around (not just mirelurks outside the water). It would definitely make the harpoon more useful.
---
I understand the plot, but because of the nature of the game it doesn't translate very well.
---
&gt; When our characters emerge from the vaults, Appalachia is currently ground zero of a threat which is potentially even more apocalyptic than the bombs themselves: The infection of the scorchbeasts has already wiped out everyone who has attempted to rebuild here, and if they're not stopped here and now, before they can breed and spread, they will do so to the entire world. There will be no rebuilding. There will be no hope for the future. They have to be stopped here and now in order to save the rest of the world from what's happened here. 
---
But that's just it--as you play the game, you don't actually stop anything.  The scorchbeasts are still there, people let off nukes like party poppers and nothing changes.  You're basically told, "Excellent, you've saved humanity!" and that's it.  It's the nature of the game itself.  There is literally no endgame because it's a multiplayer game.
---
So yeah, the Wastelanders DLC promises a new main quest--but I don't see how that would change anything.  The Scorchbeast Queen will *still* keep being killed.  The scorched plague will *still* be there.  Unless they actually get rid of the old content (and I'm doubtful that would happen, though it might), it's business as usual.
---
If there are meaningful choices and consequences, that'd be fantastic!  I'd love to have more actual RP in this RPG lol.  A living story would be good, but I'm sceptical Bethesda will deliver on that--the game engine, the size of the team and what's come before makes it doubtful.
---
So close yet so far...
---
Well, I played all day yesterday and didn‚Äôt put together the odd things I saw until I read these posts on Reddit. I even bought three perks of Salty because my food was spoiling and nearly died to an instant exploding robot legendary in Watoga. 
---
This idea has been around for a while... no shame there, great minds think alike and all that! üòÇ
---
BTW, If you're on PC, there is a mod on Nexus that will do this for you.
---
I never saw that, the times that i server hopped and the vendor wasn‚Äôt there, there were super mutants, bloatflies, glowing radstag, once just a suitcase, and a couple tents another time
---
The real price of nukashine. 
---
How much is it worth on the market ?  
---
It cost almost 60 caps to buy the quantum alone from the vendor. How much are black outs worth to you? 
---
that would be great, I'm generally on all day as I'm trying to find work right now. I'm on PC, name is Trillian69, and  I would happily give you up to 10k for it. Right now wearing my X-01 PA drops my carry weight. I do use a mic and am usually streaming. I also have some harder to get plans I'll throw your way if you need them.
---
i want my park coins! I missed the daily 2 days in a row now! that's 6 coins! =/
---
I‚Äôm thinking about farming the area and buying lots of plans but selling them for cheap for the player vending..anyways this vendor was easier for me than the Charleston Vendor bot.. 
---
My guess would be one of the underground quests that the advertised in the wild appalachia. There's been other locations such as vaults that have been found too. 
---
Top floor as in roof? 
---
It used to be 1 second to never lol. 
---
So you guy know...
---
[https://ibb.co/WfHHY3B](https://ibb.co/WfHHY3B)
---
If its an indoor area you cant nuke it btw. 
---
Dude the trailer showed the legendary vendor so I was confused calm down
---
It's very cool indeed 
---
I wish I could grow enough facial hair for a neckbeard, but I wouldn't have it as a neckbeard.
---
I just heard that the high ropes course near the bridge has a high chance of spawning one in the trees if you attempt the course a few times. Really just seems like you have to constantly be looking around for that purple bugger as you travel.
---
Thanks for being polite unlike some people on this forum :(
---
&gt; Lily Bowen
---
omg! i almost forgot about her and Tabitha!  thanks for the trip down irradiated memory lane!
---
Free fast travel
---
It cut my thumb when scrolling on my phone.
---
Why delete the picture? Did a mod ask you to?
---
That's WAY too much. I'd sell for like 2 or 3K. Might be more interested in some of your plans. I've been trying to get all the serum recipes. I have 13 of the 19. Just need: Eagle Eyes, Egg Head, Electrically Charged, Empath, Plague Walker, and Unstable Isotope.
---
I don't have any issues with people playing like that. I just don't like people leveling my camp when I'm half a map away. I keep my doors unlocked to help people out. I'm cool if you attack my camp when I'm in it though. Had some moron break out a fatman to destroy my wooden shack once lol. Frag grenades would've worked  just fine dude 
---
Ah ok. Thanks for the reply! I wonder what it'll do... Maybe just there for shits and giggles since it's in the middle of no where near the edge of the map.
---
Theres some free stimpacks and an exercise bike you can't ride in the truck, btw :) and a ton of kickballs. o.o I'll be watching it for changes I suppose!
---
Next time I will simply put "that's got to be a typo" instead of being slightly sarcastic. 
---
Plus, this being an online game and as such it won't even start if it isn't on the most up to date version, the cap would be applied on next login and any excess stored would be lost to the void.
---
I'll add you when I get home, my IGN: jims1973
---
Hes got a shop set up at the bottom of Fissure Site Prime. You have to have a lot of weight on you to make it to the bottom though, so make sure you have as much junk on you as possible. /s
---
I got "drink fresh whiskey" and "score a critical hit". After I figured out that fresh whiskey is just whiskey, I scored a ton of crits, but the quest won't complete.
---
/u/ladydevann, /u/lonevaultwanderer are you guys aware of this? Quite a few posts about the daily not completing. 
---
That‚Äôs awesome.  I have to imagine most players would crap their pants spotting one at a camp.  Forget the turrets let me introduce you to fluffy. 
---
This is such an easy random encounter spot... And got a 3* armor from a deathclaw haha
---
experiencing exactly this myself
---
For some reason even after pumping the volume up WAY high, I can still barely hear him 
---
SAD
---
Yeah it‚Äôs lame. One guy told me he can‚Äôt place his camp at all now. 
---
That would be pretty nifty. I do like base building but I worry if the system can handle how large players will probably want them to be.
---
And maybe we can experiment on test subjects.... You know....
---
For science.
---
Only if we get grenade fishing as well
---
On my way! Gotta fire up the game
---
Daily resets are a previously existing issue, I haven't been able to trigger any daily quests in the mire for weeks now. 
---
This game is the most played games i ever have,  i mean the longest one is Insurgency  with 260 hours+ but it took 1 year to have all those hours, and Fallout 76 is probably the 2nd with around 83 hours within 3 weeks. I was really excited when the game first announced and i really wanted to buy it, but im just a normal student, im not going to pay 60 dollars for a game plus all the negative review when the game released. I decided NOT to buy the game, but i really like the gameplay (Survival is my kind of game) and i dont think bugs will break my gameplay, so i bought the game in the beginning of February for only 15$ (I dont know how or why the seller would give me that price). And well, the first time i joined the world it was really laggy, and the bugs is just over what i expected, but i didnt stop there i still played the game for hours and find out the game is really fun! The world is more alive than most Survival Open World game, a lot of quest, simple but advanced base building, and the lore is very interesting. For the storyline, yes, you need to listen holotapes and read notes, but it is better than time consuming dialogue that you skip everytime.
---
So the conclusion is you will enjoy the game if you like the type of the game.
---
High ropes course?
---
Is this post the one you are referring to?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0wjct/i_found_a_pair_of_card_readers_in_the_basement_of
---
Which is what my point is, for all you know they may be doing it purely just to get other people to attack them, almost nobody actively goes out of their way to PvP anymore because there isn't any value in it.
---
Personally I believe Bethesda should either give players an option to make their base invulnerable by paying a set cost, either materials or caps to make it immune for say a 24 hour period when online and only counts down when you are online
---
That last sentence punched me in the feels
---
Hahaha like I got the margarita recipe that require tequila lol
---
I was not making an argument, and I was most definately not saying alcoholh consumation in video games cause alcoholsim.
---
I was simply curious and was hoping for someone to share his first hand experience.
---
Eating and drinking a couple of times per in-game day would be fine, but it's pretty silly even when it isn't bugged out. It's really tedious inventory management.
---
I still like gram and challie more but bib is hilarious.
---
I actually think it‚Äôs become a ‚Äúthing‚Äù now for thugs and griefers to fast travel into WS to gank people.  Chances are if you are farming ghouls you are accumulating a lot of loot and that‚Äôs appealing to those folks.  They need a stash box at the golf club for this very reason!  
---
I oh play games, I'm not a gamer.
---
I play football, I'm not a footballer.
---
Why am I here.....to...ask...a...question!
---
Someone else much brighter than you managed to work out what I wanted.
---
No ability to answer it?
---
If somebody isn't interested in pvp, *maybe don't effing force the issue*?  Non-pvp players are playing the same game you are, paid fdor it just like you, and their experience is being diminished if you are forcing them into pvp for you entertainment.  Pvp is absolutely a part of the game, but if the other party obviously isn't interested, *move on*.  If pvp is really your thing, then being able to one shot your chosen opponent shouldn't be something you're looking for anyway... unless you're exactly like the people you're complaining about and just want every thing to be easy for *you*.

I personally find him a bit obnoxious, but that's because it's good character design,

I would be happy to dispose of that for 1 cap per lb of weight.
---
YES! I can't place plants, water taps, lightbulbs, or the new radio (ive tried so far)
---
Blueprints/stored items were deleted and I still cannot craft a new item to place down.
---
Lol it's just a shame I get scared when people come to my camp. Oddly he doesn't attack my female friend (who also has a deathclaw) but he tries to attack our male friend. He can't hurt anyone on a team but it makes my house rumble. Lol 
---
Awesome!
---
Strong agreement. Every single time I Fast travel, I have to change my perks. Every time I engage in combat, I change my perks. There are two  setups  that I use over and over again that really never change. Having a preset option (like a blueprint for workshops) would be awesome and save so much time. 
---
good for you i guess?  thanks for sharing?
---
The crashed satellite is one of the other random spawns, so yeah it should be the same place!
---
They only blow up when you hit them like a bitch ;)
---
joking aside might wanna submit a but report with that video link
---
Why? I made a mistake.
---
You pointed it out because for some reason it was important to you.
---
Trivial mistakes on reddit posts dont mean fiddly shit to me.
---
It's not like people couldn't work out where I was.
---
You have the issue with the miss spelling.
---
You corrected.
---
I said thanks.
---
Getting upset that someone didn't correct it is t really normal in my opinion.
---
But hey ho, each to their own.
---
Jesus Christ it is
---
Only the hundredth time I‚Äôve seen a similar post. Search before you post knucklehead. 
---
Yeah the last time I was here I heard about the Halloween Witch costume. So tried it out and got it on first try
---
I'm going to raid your fridge.
---
same but on pc. from eu to..
---
u/ladydevann
---
Is it possible that you or the devs can give us a list or map picture of locations we cannot build? 
---
Ooh, lookit Mr "I work for a living". Know who else works for a living and has a family? Me. I work all day, do the grocery shopping, and cook dinner for my family. After the kids are in bed I log in and perform the activities listed above in 20 minutes before exploring. You're the one that's missing the point. You ask for mini-workshops; most workshops have 4 resource collectors; I've got 2 (lead and fertilizer), which qualifies as "mini". 
---
I've noticed that while the "I work for a living" crowd are smart enough to recognize that they're not as good at a game as other people, they don't take that extra step to understand it's a personal failing, not some unfair advantage others have that needs to be overcome by a special gift to people not smart enough to understand the system. Play smarter, not longer.
---
Having a working fermenter that doesn't break the game I hope is the current priority as many of us are still waiting on the pending hotifix so we can access our main characters again...   
---
**So far for some of us our experience with the latest update has been:**
---
1: Hey updates out great! Installing now\~  
---
2: Well that quest line was quick, but hey its cool I can make some unique drinks - Let me craft some up!  
---
3: Going to farm for a little bit then get smashed!  
---
4: 'Your current world is going under maintenance, please change worlds!'      
---
5: "Sure thing, no problem"  /Join new World = 'Error - Disconnected From Server'  
---
6: Repeat step 5 25 times, trouble shoot your internet connection and other system settings...  
---
7: Give up and begin to play the Bethesda Support email tag game: 'Unplug and plug your system back in'   
---
8: "\*#@$&amp;#&amp;\*&amp;\*#@&amp;#&amp;\*&amp;\*$%"  
---
9: /Create new character, get bored, log off, check forums and support pages for any info on when they will fix what they epicly broke.  
---
However yes, once they fix what they broke a fridge would be a nice addition considering food now spoils in what feels like instantly....  
---
I tell you the same, waht I just told someone else:
---
&gt;I was not making an argument, and I was most definately not saying alcohol consumation in video games cause alcoholsim.
---
In addition to that I repeat: I was not making a statement of any kind. I have no problem separating a virutal world from the real world. 
---
I you would have read my post, you could have saved youself a lot of triggered typing.
---
I was asking, if people who are struggling with addiction have a different view on this. Because I do not know the answer to that question. 
---
Sorry man. You are right, they should have put the dates in the trailer. But between that question being asked a million times already and Bethesda already previously releasing the dates I just had a little mental meltdown. Hope you have a great day.üåù
---
I found the quote.  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aztefe/discussion_as_survival_mode_approaches_how_many/ei9zaz3/?context=1
---
i can go take a pick of the place if you want
---
Did you just get disconnected as well?
---
Hope you were able to get to that world, server just disconnected me
---
that's the one, pretty sure this is connected :D
---
Well no. 
---
You are, by your own logic, a nobody.
---
At this point you just want my attention.
---
So I guess I‚Äôll give you one letter at a time if you reply  :)
---
I‚Äôm benevolent you could say :)
---
same here, since the update every time I've logged on. I've had a server disconnect at least once per session and I've played both days since the update. 
---
I also experienced a really long time out for the fire breathers physical exam, I failed the first time and then had to server hop as I couldn't reset and start the exam again. 
---
And every time I've started a session I find that my equiped weapon is empty. now that could be me but I made sure my weapons were fully loaded when I logged off last night so I'm going to see if this happens again when I log back on today or tomorrow.  
---
Had to dig out my map but it's just west of New River Gorge Resort, across the highway.
---
Sounds Lagendary XD
---
exactly my first recipe requires tick blood tequila
---
I‚Äôm not sure survival mode will create a mass exodus.  Some ‚Äúraiders‚Äù are chickenshits with duped builds and weapons or they purposely hide out so they aren‚Äôt looking for a fair fight.  There are times I‚Äôm down for a rumble but make the other person aware and give them a chance to respond.  Sneaking up and/or sniping from a distance is weak.  You want to fight?  Cool let‚Äôs dance.  
---
hmmm maybe just stop and think about your statement.  obviously you just read the many many posts about people who HAVE had their camps destroyed.   We are all so super happy you have never been grieved.  but maybe stop a second and think about what you just said.
---
its like saying, "I'VE never starved, i always have food in my fridge.. so how many people in 3rd world nations are acting like they are starving? They cant possibly be that hungry"
---
Got our selves a bad boi ova here 
---
I like my my healing factor mutation. Discourages such things when you can just ignore and heal instantly.
---
interesting idea I'm one of those stone age gamers, been around since Dos. I find it pointless and very disturbing that any player can destroy anything that belongs to another player. This transcends the pail. I had just finished defending the old arms factory and received the reward. It was very hard at level 38. Suddenly without provocation three players showed up and basically gang raped me. Is this a message we want to send about our love for gaming? I loved pvp games in the past but this is just sick..
---
I got my first daily from him yesterday, and it was _two_ quests.  One was drink an Oak Haller Lager, then do a sneak attack.  The second was to craft an Oak Haller Lager and give it to him.  I was suprised he gave me two at once.
---
Finding Thistle was a pain in the ass though.  Found one plant in Toxic Valley, luckily I had Green Thumb and got two thistles.
---
Good thing for me collecting recipes was, the Oak Haller one just gave me the recipe right away, and doing the Test earned me a Cranberry Moonshine recipe.
---
Giving him a second Oak Haller earned me the Greek Letters plan as a reward, so I was happy.
---
And of course, interacting with Biv is a reward in and of itself.  I bet the fluid in this brain jar is booze...
---
Ok, I'll engage. How SHOULD we be playing? You've done an excellent job describing how people shouldn't play, going as far as invoking hatred. 
---
around "Abby's Bunker" That's where i have found 2, and the third that I just found is at an unmarked location small fenced with a crashed truck just north of Abby's Bunker.
---
Do the hats fetch anything or the mask found in the asylum?
---
I want an answer to the question you weren't smart enough to see.
---
I will take that answer one letter at a time, if you have the ability to provide it.
---
So knock yourself out.
---
I will thank you when you have finished.
---
One letter at a time.
---
Yup... Hahahaha fuck me... 
---
Q
---
I know. I like my way
---
I‚Äôve been trying to get healing factor for a while, it would be really good for this 
---
I have a feeling Bethesda doesn‚Äôt like this idea, as it encourages excessive server hopping, which I‚Äôm guessing can throw off the game balancing from world to world. 
---
Having said that, I know that when I‚Äôm in the mood to fight the SBQ, or even just battle some ghouls or harvest flux, I often wish there was some sort of discord or online bulletin board that has current nuke launching worlds so players that want to participate can join that server. I‚Äôm actually a bit surprised this doesn‚Äôt already exist on Reddit or some similar site. 
---
That would be very nice :)
---
I‚Äôm also doing this because you want the last word.
---
It‚Äôs another incel thing that you guys do.
---
Weird but it‚Äôs fun to take that away from angry man children lolol
---
Which location were you at?
---
Just cut out the middleman and be a cannibal...by cutting out the middles of men...
---
What can you get off them?
---
Just because it isn't interesting to you doesn't mean it isn't interesting
---
Amazing... this is definitely a feature
---
In that case, I'll definitely be making a youtube video going over how I do it and hopefully BGS sees it.
---
Shows you're a lazy fuck who'd rather "thank" someone for pointing out a mistake like a bratty little bitch than just owning up to it and fixing it.
---
yeah, same here. I've been going to Camdem Park to do the token daily but it hasn't popped up since the new patch.
---
There's a secret spot in the southern Savage Divide that has an optimal (with travel agent) 10 cap Fast Travel to 6 of the 7 stationary vendors. Then use the vault to get to either Morgantown or Flatwoods for responders. And... there are several farming spots reasonable near for screws, springs, and other junk.
---
They could partially fix this by taking caps from an account rather than the current character and having bounties collected by friends or teammates go to the server. People who mule their caps so they can get a bounty would disappear along with those that just get them back from their friends.
---
Full disclosure... I pretty much just grind mats and PVP these days so my base gets destroyed often by salty players. You can move it and then move it back for a few caps and it "automagically" is repaired. The only real cost for me is the flux for my decontamination shower.
---
p.s. I know that doesn't work for everyone (my base has to be rebuilt) but it might help a few of you.
---
Hey with a toilet at least we cold take a dump, while the game dumps on us. The circle of life\~!
---
Levels don't actually make much of a difference past 50 besides optimizing cards. But if the dude was totally naked you didn't "own" anything. Looks like he was bored and looking to die.  At least you tried tho?
---
This just happened to me. I logged out, logged back in, drank my bourbon and it completed upon my first successful sneak attack.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs because your female friend also has a pet deathclaw?  Too funny.  I want a pet Colonel Gutsy.  Who wants to get their ass handed to them! 
---
Saying thanks is owning up to it.
---
Saying it was a mistake is owning up to it.
---
It takes more effort to reply with thanks than to edit a letter.
---
I am thankful he cared enough to point out a typo.
---
I dont give a flying fuck about them however, unless they alter what was intended.
---
Perk cards 
---
Yes, i have it too, but sometimes it didnt work so you need to keep using stimpaks.
---
Oh, just a hint as to where I need to go! I am pretty stumped at the moment :P
---
Will it be equal to pa? Or better?
---
I have a child lol
---
You know how children are made....right?
---
Really starting to think it was you I bitch slapped!
---
I see you are not replying 1 letter at a time?
---
Sad you have no integrity.
---
lol! 
---
I will do that, but you're talking about the Bethesda site, right? Like opening a ticket?
---
So the next time you chug some nuka shine and we find your ass waking up we can be like this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4--JU134BxU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4--JU134BxU)
---
Does healing factor kick in when they are slap happy?  Ie, does the system consider a slapper a threat? I like the mutation, but it seems like something is always tracking me (threat) and it just doesn‚Äôt kick in.
---
A lot
---
You spelled "Feature" wrong. 
---
It will at least cure your radiation when they hit you
---
Yes please! That would be greatly appreaciated.
---
most people are complaining because the farming has been pretty inconsistent - luckily now Beth has fixed it so all legendary enemies will have a drop, but it is still pretty sad to kill a 3\* enemy and get a 1\* wood leg. That's all people are saying
---
Lol or as he said last night...."Kill them all and let God sort them out."  As far as I know you can hack them (it's equivalent to pacifying them) but its only temporary.
---
From what I can tell so far, the knight paint doesn't seem to suffer from the bright silver texture thing that occurs with the initiate and default paint schemes in bright sunlight
---
The hats are fairly common. The mask could go for about 50C'ish. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è just depends it fluctuates so much.
---
Just cheat them right back!

---
I had my camp leveled once in 700+ hours of play, that being said it did leave a bad taste in my mouth and has since led me to making cheap/compact bases.
---
I like the change. Given that they're going to introduce some system for melting down useless legendary items into more valuable ones, they either had to take out the helpless legendary robot targets in Watoga altogether or do something like this. Otherwise you'd end up with crowds of people farming the city constantly.
---
I'm glad they picked the more creative solution.
---
How do you feel about spoilers?
---
You know you have a post history right?
---
Yah. Point made mate.
---
And ya I would but then I realized this particular sub is bitch slapping you all over

Would be remiss to leave out any extra you add with each reply you give.

You are like a walking indignity that just keeps spewing.

Trust me I‚Äôm an irreverent shit myself but I don‚Äôt stray off the path of logic and I‚Äôm not a pig head incel either.  You are my fun.

When I‚Äôm done with you I‚Äôll ignore you.

I was in watoga yesterday and only saw one legendary, and it gave me about 3 seconds after death to loot it. 
---
I wonder what the conditions are that you experienced instant explosions every time. 
---
I did however encounter a different glitch since the patch. The tube made its spawning noise for the next robot and when the door opened the robot instantly died. I never touched it. I've never seen that before. 
---
Well we can but try my internet friend.
---
My Camp is near the relay Tower/ mountains by Flatwoods. And it's on a cliff. I've been in the spot for about a month now, and have seen him three times.
---
I dont know, maybe it got nerfed?
---
 I am lvl 119, and dont get slapped too often anymore. 
---
But I had wanted personalized, delicate answers to cater to my very specific thoughts and emotions in my knucklehead brain...
---
Sorry though, I thought I had scanned the page and didn't see anything out right. Maybe I'm just blind (it is allergy season), or a little curious about the whole thing and jumped the proverbial shark.
---
But really tho - should I move? I believe people have had to move camps from other DLC areas, if I'm not automatically prompted now could it be far enough out of range?
---
When you drink it it will make you powerful. Double melee. But after a couple minutes it will wear off. Your character will appear somewhere else on the map.. possibly naked.(unconfirmed) it's pretty funny where you'll end up sometimes. But when it starts to wear off if you don't grab everything off the bodies you've left in your drunken wake. The loot is lost 
---
I thought that might be the case, and it wasn't meant as a criticism to you. Anyone that is multilingual is a step above most Americans. I had a few years of German in high school, and I could probably get by there as a tourist if no one spoke English, but I'm far from being as fluent as you are in English. 
---
I suppose the point we were making was just that, although what you wrote was fine, it definitely shouldn't be upheld as a shining example of great writing. I also never would have said anything if others weren't praising it. The sad truth is, you write better than many adults do in America for whom English is their native language. 
---
I run the coils on both my main armors {X-01 and Excavator) just because the shock allows me to tag enemies just by walking (or sprinting) past them.  Very useful to 
---
* make sure to share the wealth in enemy dense areas with other players and
---
* make sure I can tag stuff when some melee one shotter is being greedy in the aforementioned enemy dense areas, killing them before anyone else can get a tag.
---
Tagging is basically all the coils on the torso is good for; high level enemies don't take more than a slow sliver of damage at a time from it.  I haven't used the bracers, I have the ones that make power attacks cost less instead.
---
*Yeeeeaaah*
---
Aw man, I wanna be insulted!
---
I quit drinking 8 months ago because I didn't like the way it made me feel anymore.  Drinking graduated from "a way to unwind", to "just to get through the day".  I was literally drinking "like there's  no tomorrow" for me. It was a very low point in my life.  Alcohol consumption in game for my character, I never used it or the drugs because your character could become addicted and it had negative consequences, just like real life. Now that I have the perk card that makes me immune to addiction, she drinks like a fish. A Vault Tech U. chemistry-major fish. It doesn't really trigger me to drink again, because I lack that particular perk IRL, but I do empathize with people who struggle with the craving and situational triggers.  
---
Squat to sneak. It didnt show as danger before...
---
Better yet, camp in southeast and take over a workshop in northeast. Those two plus Vault 76  get you a free travel hub within 7 caps of just about anyplace on the map(with Travel Agent still). Heck, take over more workshops and get to within reasonable running distance of everything.
---
Yeah one that mentions my kid multiple times lol
---
So tell me again how I am an incel? Yah.Point made mate.
---
I'd rather not have to use a mutation because some dickweed with a death claw gauntlet won't stop harassing me.  I like this guy's idea. 
---
you misunderstand. they're suggesting an option to give it up immediately instead of being expected to travel to it and defend it.
---
Wonder around the woods east of the top of the world, seen him twice now at night 
---
Just imagine you are paying the Valut-Tec teleportation company.  :-)
---
Lots of small QOL improvements. Even just the challenge tracker in the map helped, I do some of the daily's now. Just came back from anthem myself.
---
I would really love this or other food preservation methods because it'd make collecting the ingredients for hard to make recipes so much more worth it.
---
Like, it'd be nice to be able to actually *have* my Mirelurk Cakes with Bloodleaf Aioli without half the ingredients rotting while I collect the other half.
---
Every game that has fishing is the worst. It always become some grand scheme for crappy dailies or some special end game buff. I'm not a fan of this idea when they could spend their time making something worth while. 
---
It just seems like that's the case. People get there base hit once and immediately go to reddit calling for them to change the game. I know that it happens but I dont think it's as big a problem as people make it seem. 
---
"So it's like a squirt gun."
---
"I'm listening."
---
"But it only works with milk."
---
"Interesting..."
---
"And it works backwards. You shoot someone who has milk, and it fills up with milk."
---
"Get out."
---
"I also have a pie tin that grabs pies off of other peoples' faces..."
---
"GET. OUT."
---
How many do you have to drink before you blackout?
---
Mostly great, though it looks like a very light breeze would be its undoing
---
I haven't got to log in this week. Did this stop idiots from building behind the clubhouse in whitesprings? If so....Bravo!!
---
\+1  
---
I see what you mean, but they could make it a very small amount of storage space so it cannot be abused.  Just enough space for a few helpings of that scorch beast meat the lucky level 5 acquired or a small helping of radstag meat for when you are not in radstag populated zone and would like the ability to have that buff when you need it.   
---
 At low levels it would be very helpful and harder to create, but  for end gamers pretty pointless as we get so much materials and food that neither is (or should be) an issue at all.  Depending on the crafting cost to create it wouldnt be a big issue for huge abuse for the low levels considering actual new accounts/players have much less materials horded away and if they decided to waste those started mats on such an item, at least thats one aspect of the game they have some leeway with.    
---
However they have much more pressing fixes and items that they need to work on before such a novelty item has dev time spent working on.
---
I wish you the best with your new family! Children are definitely not for me. The girlfriend part sounds alright, though I haven't dated in quite a while and the whole thing just seems like a lot of trouble to go to when all of my friends in relationships seem to be miserable lol.
---
well played.

---
Maybe it‚Äôs just the moon cycle but my experience is the active/pushy PvPs have picked up the pace in the last two weeks.  
---
It used to be (out of respect) someone would fire a warning shot or two to determine if the PvP feelings were mutual.  Now it‚Äôs just hide out and gank with little or no notice and then server hop to avoid an actual confrontation.  
---
I don‚Äôt get the camp wrecking myself unless it‚Äôs someone that set up shop behind the golf club.  Then you are absolutely fair game. 
---
There are THREE lights!
---
Bad suggestion is bad 
---
Nah not really. .50 cal is really light. Even without bandolier perk I can carry 30K around. With weight reduction perks and gear the amount of ammo you can carry just becomes insane. I'd say millions of rounds would be possible.
---
The story missions are so short lived. I'm level 70 and more than half of those are from the boring grind of farming Whitesprings over and over.
---
I had done the majority of available non-daily quests by level 25. I have basically played the whole time solo. 
---
There isn't enough content to keep me interested. I log in, see what event quests are going on, maybe look for a nuke zone with someone actually playing it. Most of the time there aren't even enough players on the server to do a nuke zone. 
---
It feels lonely mainly because there's not enough story or questing imo. Nothing to keep me interested. The new content is cool, but the same problem exists. 
---
I paid 80 for the tri-centennial Best Buy Edition. And I have 300 hours logged and I don't regret it at all.
---
The coveted tree outfit!
---
When you zone(fast travel or join a server) anything with CND takes a tick. I claimed a bunch of workshops and another buddy did as well. we fast travel between them and our food spoils faster then not fast traveling. 
---
You can gather flux and server hop to sell it (while looking for stuff to buy) and it will decay really fast compared to not jumping around the map. 
---
 When you would fast travel in new vegas your hunger/thirst and all that would go up because time passes when you fast travel. 
---
Pretty sure they have some stupid mechanic going on here
---
Yes, but there was no manhole in the street. I marked the spot and looked around but nothing going in.
---
It‚Äôs just the only cryptid I havent seen. I just want to complete the challenge 
---
You shouldn't be forced into participating in the game that you purchased? 
---
Were you at some point told that this wasn't going to be a multiplayer game where basically all the characters (even the raiders) would be other players?
---
Side note, can we kill Evan yet?
---
Didn‚Äôt the devs acknowledge that the community wants it.
---
It was definitely NOT a vault. More like a giant sewer raider base. 
---
&gt; *The map is absolutely beautiful, and has such a huge amount of detail and variety poured into it, and I can only hope they keep adding more content regularly to expand on this already pretty enjoyable experience.* 
---
This is why I thoroughly enjoy the game. And yes, they have just added content to explore, with more on the way. FO76 did get off to a shaky start, there is no denying it, but Bethesda are trying to improve the game, and it does show (even with setbacks like newly introduced bugs). Enjoy your journey!
---
it did surprise me too. All I did was try to convey in the best possible way that I wasn't meaning to be passive-aggressive or condescending.
---
However it was definitely not Hemingway let me put it that way ;)
---
On the subject of criticism, constructive criticism is always welcome, even when it stings. I may pull a face when it happens because stoic I am not but I still welcome it.
---
Super Mutant Horde (in the Mire I think)
---
I didn't like 76 at all when it released. I thought Anthem would be so much better and make me forget how bummed out I was over 76. Totally not the case. Anthem was just as disappointing.
---
I gave 76 another shot over the weekend and actually liked it this time. I think 76 is better than Anthem at this point.
---
Not the point...if I wanted straight PVP I would play COD. 
---
I got the hotdog eating one to pop up but I feel like in General the daily quests aren‚Äôt even daily. They pop up when they feel like it lol
---
gona try the new key card i ve found in tanagra town (its the paired key card 02)
---
I'm going to Camden park every day to get the token. But the daily quest hasn't triggered for me since the latest update (3 days in a row now) I've been trying to fast travel, walk from all direction to Camden Park. Nothing triggers the quest.
---
I experienced an infinitely loading loot bag after the update, but I didn't die beforehand and it wasn't my bag.  Someone left this bag at the Whitespring train station beside the vendor.  I imagine it must've been filled with every item I could've ever wanted.
---
I didn't realize that crits went through certain legendary effects, so I can definitely see that causing issues. Those are good points. 
---
Some random fraternity in West Virginia gets their hands on the most advanced secret robotics technology in the US. I guess they took a drunken road trip to Boston and broke into the giant underground facility somehow.
---
And, of course, Robobrains all turn psychotic so its good that its intoxicated all the time, I guess.
---
KoS lists are pretty necessary in games like this imo. Gotta know who your enemies are.
---
How do you build so tall? I can never get above two stories.

Umm..

Hate to break it to you but having a child doesn‚Äôt insulate you from having low opinions of women that don‚Äôt sleep with you.

Your post history belies what you say here.
---
Hopefully they all found new games to cheat at
---
It's not the moon cycle.  It's people running out of stuff to do.  They've done the quests, collected/ground for/bought their best gear, and have nothing left of base game content to entertain them.  They've grown bored and all that's really left to them is pvp.  I actually understand this now, because I'm in the same boat; I'm out of in game content to do.But in my case, I've started actively seeking out other players to group with and help with quests, etc, for stuff to do.  Now that I've gone through all the content solo and gotten my levels up there and build somewhat viable, I'm ready to be social, so that's what I do.
---
Sounds good.
---
Yep, there was a lot of water that I fell into several times. I thought for a while that I was in the sewers under Dyer Chemical (I think).
---
Warframe is definitely better than Anthem
---
&gt; So yeah, the Wastelanders DLC promises a new main quest--but I don't see how that would change anything. The Scorchbeast Queen will still keep being killed. The scorched plague will still be there. Unless they actually get rid of the old content (and I'm doubtful that would happen, though it might), it's business as usual.
---
Here's my theory. When "Wastelanders" launches, it will be a new option on the main menu. You'll have, like "Adventure Mode," "Survival Mode," "Nuclear Winter" and "Wastelanders," and the latter option will give us a world where the Scorchbeast Queen is dead and the timeline is advanced by some time, presenting new threats and new opportunities. Meanwhile, if you select "adventure mode," you'll get the game more or less as it presently exists (plus whatever DLC additions have been added in that time). It's the most sensible way to go about it. 
---
Same for me. 
---
Your point is valid but folks just aren't going to understand the difference between PvP and Grief, if you destroyed camps and then hunted to person who's stuff you wrecked there's the issue, gamer tags on turrets allow this. 
---
I was murdered and robbed like this last nite by a team of experts in being a dipshit. I didn't come to complain about it, just some mechanics need a serious fix from Bethesda concerning the rules of engagement and penalties for piss poor behaviour considering that "time" is valuable to all players. 
---
They should create a loadout system and/or just let certain cards be passive abilities once you pick them. I'm at level 160 and have a ton of cards I can swap around depending on the situation.  It doesn't seem like my character is very unique. Kinda miss the old Fallout perk system tbh.
---
oh god yes please 
---
Ok, I will keep you updated. 
---
I don't post a lot but this is the best reply I've ever gotten
---
Hmm ok well I look into it. Thanks for this information!
---
I see what you did there.
---
Yeah, but currently I'm doing the main quest line so there's a lot of fast traveling to the same area so it helps a lot 
---
Yeah, it really sucks for people like me who dont use stimpacks but rely on soups and drinks we craft
---
Incel means involuntary celibate.
---
I'm married,with a child.
---
I have proven literally, through the miracle of conception, that even if I had at some point t, chosen to be celibate, I didn't start that way.
---
Now you cant get mad at me for using gamer in a none literal way, if you are foing to use incel non literally.
---
Can you now?
---
One. It's good shit. Two minutes of rainbow vision, then things get blurry.
---
Then you're in a treehouse clear across the map picking pubes out of your teeth.
---
LOOK AT THE FUCKING ROAD MAP.! There have been way too many post about this. The vendor doesn‚Äôt come out until a month, or two. 
---
Yes, but it‚Äôll let you rebuild there no problem. And it‚Äôs hit or miss if it‚Äôll give you the same prompt again at login. 
---
Do you have the link to the post
---
Thank you.
---
I think if you are in pacifist mode your camp should be invincible.  None of the other structures in the game are breakable.
---
But you lied about A lame story to get attention and that backfired.
---
I don‚Äôt believe you are married to anyone.
---
Plus if you have a child what a terrible thing to have done.
---
Cruelty abounds that you would ever sow your seed anywhere.
---
Yeah people don't play GTA then try pressing triangle to steal a car. Even reformed thieves. There's a clear boundary between video gaming in real life. This question is a akin to ask someone if watching a movie which has heavy drinking it will cause them to relapse.
---
Ice cold Nukashine!
---
Who doesn't want to RP as Groot? LOL!
---
I joined late compared to most here as well and aside from a few issues I've been on the front line with like right now being locked out of my main character due to the game breaking glitch me and a few others discovered in this latest update which has caused us to be unable to load our characters, my experience has been good overall as well. I was even surprised how few in game trolls i encountered.  I played A LOT of GTA5 and expected that level of trolling here as well lol, I was pleasantly surprised how most people in game were friendly and looking to work together. Obviously with a few exceptions.  
---
After watching the hate train on youtube and elsewhere I decided to roll the dice and see for myself how the game was as logging over 4,000 hours on both F03,FNV, and F04 themselves my fallout fix was wanting, and I definitively have had plenty of fun so far.  Granted I was not here for the day 1 days and can only imagine how it was.   
---
As I wait to gain access to my main character, how long this takes Bethesda to fix will pretty much highlight to me if all the hate has been justified or simply a glorified band wagon hate train over blowing the game and developers faults/incompitance for sensationalism and youtube ad revenue...  
---
I have not checked the latest .esm yet but in all previous iterations of the game the scout armor records were incomplete.
---
A very important keyword was missing thus making it impossible to attach any mods to the armor.
---
Unless that has been fixed being able to purchase the mods would just be another source of frustration.
---
I've had some CAMP building problems as well. Sometimes if you exit the build mode and go right back into it, it'll let me place something in the exact same spot that it complained about before. Annoying for sure and I don't know if it'll help you, but worth a try. 
---
use a floormat an put them on a floor tile
---
Followed your reply thread a couple of days ago in a post dealing with this subject and had a comment all prepared and decided not to hit that REPLY tab.  I was conflicted about that you seemed to be wanting others to vindicate your personal definition of harassment ( I honestly don't think that's what you were asking), but the thread of the conversation had morphed a bit from what was originally being discussed imo, so I just didn't say anything.  I am replying now because even though my play style is non PVP of any sort for this game, I agree with what you just said 100%. This game was designed to accommodate several different play choices and destroying peoples camps, as much as I hate it, is actually encouraged by the devs.  I have stated in other posts that, IMO, Bethesda underestimated their hardcore fans affinity for PVP.  No other Fallout has been PVP and their pregame launch advertising was very weak in emphasizing the PVP aspect.  They focused on  "Brothers in Arms, all cooperating together to rid the wasteland of evil" sort of campaign.  A lot of Fallout players never imagined such a poorly designed PVP system that encourages and favors "griefers" or at least does next to nothing to punish it.  The Fallout community backlash has been overwhelming in condemning what they feel is bad behavior and while some of it truly is, they have not provided properly designed opt out features for non PVP players and now you have a large group who would rather quit the game than tolerate or participate in it.  Bethesda cannot afford to alienate these folks, so we will see no damage options to players and camp sooner rather than later as you stated.  You play this game however you want.  Everybody should.  So for the time being, I"ll deal with it, like I always have. Or take my toys and go play somewhere else.
---
i use two combat pieces with Shadowed and one of them has the ‚Äúharder to detect‚Äù attrib, then i have sneak 1 and 2 perks. with 1 equipped im quite stealthy and with 2 im basically not detected until PvE stumbles over me. it‚Äôs still broken in the player‚Äôs favor.
---
Magic reverse milk snipe (airhorns)
---
Well, you get a howling wind on the roof and vertibots attacked yesterday and were flying BELOW me and clipping through the building, so I think it'll stay up. ;)
---
I had it on metal stilts but it didn't look solid enough from a distance so I added the central tower.
---
Yes, I'm having the same issue. I have tried three locations so far and none of them were suitable.  
---
Maybe someone from the Team could confirm if boundaries around ALL locations have been increased to exclude C.A.M.P. placement?
---
In a future update
---
I like it. Kinda like the *stop doing that it's not in the rules* free parking rule in Monopoly.
---
As someone else suggested you should be able to just advertise your C.A.M.P. in general... definitely a shame right now that we can't use our C.A.M.P.s for more intentional player interactions.
---
How do you do spoiler tags please? 
---
its funny no one from Bethsoft has replied to this yet, ive seen several posts about it since the patch dropped
---
paging /u/Ladydevann 
---
while he doesn't sell PLANS for the scout mods; he does sell the mods themselves in the command section (where you get the x01 mods).  Be forewarned thought that it appears only the mods that require a perk to apply are available to apply to the armor. At least that's how it did prior to this weeks patch. I'm not sure if that changed. But I know they did NOT fix the DR/ER of the urban left arm.
---
You can build 4.5 floors above and below wherever you place your camp device.  I placed mine 4 floors up in a tree.
---
You can usually figure out where the boss is based on the locations. like if its in the savage divide and its a super mutant horde, the boss will always be at west tek (if west tek is an option sometimes they're at the satellite array) Just gotta think where that type of mob spawns the most and you should only have to fats travel once.
---
Haha except I didn't lie. You think I did, that's fine.
---
The hilarious thing is I know I didn't, so everytime you perpetuate your mistake, you look increasingly silly to the only person that knows the truth.
---
So everytime you try (and fail) to sound smart based on an incorrect assumption, you make me laugh more and more.
---
So thanks for that! 
---
Yes a wealthy man with a good job and a home bring a loved child into a world where I can provide for him and give him all he wants.
---
Sounds terrible to me.
---
Stop capturing workshops if you don't want this to happen.  It's an issue right now.  There's much better ways to get resources.  So if you capture one, expect someone to attack you currently.  Be surprised when they don't.
---
I see what you're saying about Bethesda's feelings towards it, and I agree. I just wish there was more opportunity for players that don't necessarily have more friends playing. Maybe even an end game matchmaking service or difficult event matchmaking service. More difficult events would be nice as well. 
---
tech support is currently trying to tell me my Xeon 1603 (which has a few hundred play hrs of fo76 and maybe 20-30 crashes ) does not meet their minimum processor specs for the same issue (listed by op) and refusing to work with me or even tell me that their is a known issue with the fermenter causing the problem im describing).
---
When are we going to start rebuilding America anyway? It's the theme of the game but it's not in the game.
---
Since they're making new PVP servers they should just give players the choice of PVP or PVE. Even better if we can choose to play solo.
---
Was it a cell? When you exited, did you get a load screen like entering/leaving Whitespring? or is it part of the world that's just walled off?  Also, Raiders, or Free States?  
---
Says the guy who got downvoted to oblivion for his attempt at a wild hero story.
---
You are such a goof.
---
Does Assassin's increase just primary damage or secondary effects as well. It maybe the only way to increase rad damage.
---
At least you can access your avatar to DO the daily!     
---
/still waiting bethesda\~
---
Ok well its nice to know others are experiencing the same thing. Was getting so frustrated with the game caz i thought it might have been my pc or the recent windows updates messing with the performance. 
---
Lol @ wealthy man.
---
You are exactly what I think you are
---
I'm with  you... I'm now closer to 50 than 40, and been gaming since the 70s.
---
I enjoy competition in games, I enjoy PvP when done well.
---
There's a middle ground in this shit, though... and the gaming world seems to skew *really* hard to those players that find fun in making sure others don't have fun.
---
I miss Buddy.  And his jokes.
---
Thank you guys 
---
Noooo....
---
Surely not....
---
Not...
---
No it cant be...
---
Say it ain't so...
---
Downvotes!
---
People disagreeing with me on the internet? 
---
Oh the humanity. 
---
Won't somebody think of the children!
---
I‚Äôm experiencing the same thing, and this has fixed it every time so far.
---
This is the sort of thing they should've realised before the game came out. I'd quite like to be able to 'recycle' shit cards that I'm never going to use, too.
---
So?
---
I am not a recovering addict, if I wanna know about this, I would have to ask. What I just did. It's what you do, when you want to educate yourself.
---
I know a few recovering alcoholics, no of them play video games, or I would have asked them. Two of them are very open about it, the third I know doesn't like to talk about it. One of the two who do talk about it, he didn't like watchning Mad Men. It didn't want to make him relapse, but it made him uneasy seeing the drinking especially in the office at day time, as this is what he used to do with his colleagues. The would find the tiniest things to declare it to a victory that has to be celebrated.
---
I had this issue last night, but with rum/agility/score a sneak attack. Tried everything, nothing worked until I relogged, you still have the daily quest, and it finally worked.
---
That‚Äôs what happens when you make shit up.
---
Rational people call you out.
---
The wave of logic and common sense washed over your indignant ass in droves.
---
I love it.
---
Posturing to try and act like it doesn‚Äôt affect you.
---
It‚Äôs like a pig in shit lololol.
---
Yes, you are not alone. Its generally not a big deal, but when you get anything over a single \* item, there is no way to tell what the other properties are until you buy it.
---
I never used to get harassed at Hemlock Holes -- it was like no one knew it was there -- and then bam, murdered twice in a row.
---
I need that acid, man! Just let me harvest it in peace!
---
No,  you don't, and some drivers learn. But they should be taken away from some drivers after the first infraction, because they never change.
---
If they add fishing, they have to add fish......
---
Slaughterfish all over again :( 
---
Then why ask what other people think if you‚Äôre just going to say that?
---
When this idea was put out by many others many months ago, I thought yeah that would be great. A radio that you can broadcast from your camp.
---
Even where you could broadcast a message about being open for business, crafts g or selling.
---
Then overtime I realized, the pipboy can do that and everyone has a pipboy. They already receive radio signals, data and such. 
---
I think usable radios in camps is a good idea. But they should be connected to the pipboy?
---
I think it was increases fall speed?
---
its disappointing that nukashine spoils.
---
Didn‚Äôt know that, thank you.
---
nah the key is that you can apply mods that require perks.  I was able to apply polymer to my whole set (required armorer I believe), dense to the chest (required demo expert) and ultra light to the limbs, which I think also required armoror.  Any of the mods that don't require perk won't even show up in the available mod list when in inventory.  (weighted on the arms would have been sweet)
---
That sucks. I‚Äôve not noticed if the actual cost deducted is 40, or more. Should watch closet next time I move. 
---
My gut says the interplayer dynamic is about to change in game, for the worse... as salty angry players with a chip on their shoulder seek "revenge".
---
Anyway I know you want the last word but I gotta go to work so I‚Äôm gonna block you now.
---
It‚Äôs been fun chief.
---
I like this solution as well, and it's probably easier to implement than what I've outlined.
---
I'd take either, but personally I'd prefer planters. FO4 You could fit two planters with 3 corn stalks each into the equivalent of a square, compared to the standalone in dirt corn in this game which has an invisible radius that appears to stretch into Pennsylvania and Kentucky.
---
Hahaha once again.
---
It did happen.
---
Another laugh because you think your smart.
---
Thanks again!
---
It really doesn't, one Iota.
---
That's for the normal Sledgehammer, not the Super one :) 
---
1800 caps!
---
I was kind of in-between Fred's BBQ shack, and Site Alpha, but maybe more north, and neither were within viewing distance.
---
Last word
---
I hear that. Also, there's a challenge about building your base in something liek 76 different locations. I wish I knew that before I built a place I really like.
---
I have tried that too :( no luck at all, but thank you for offering the input &lt;3   
---
For some reason, another issue I have is I cannot choose a height for foundations to sit at.. they either want to sit right on top of the ground (and turn red because then theyre floating) or they want to sink right down into the ground :/ I use to be able to adjust their heigh by increments.  Did you have this issue too?
---
I'd like to hear more about this obligation. While I don't care if info is released either way, as long as courtesy of a spoiler alert is used, but there's an obligation to tell others? Apparently in my 40 years of video gaming, I missed a by-law. Do tell. 
---
&gt;  Plus, the whole canvas bag and rum affair didn't help Bethesda's image and the game suffered for it even if gameplay wasn't affected by those issues.
---
Makes no sense at all.  You might mean that your perception of the game suffered, which tells us more about you than about the game.
---
I'm not sure how I feel about it. The griefers are a real feel bad experience, but I'd much rather have meaningful defenses. Currently turrets are weak as hell, and the limited building ability makes defensive structures worthless unless on flat ground, and even then are circumvented by marsupial. I like the idea of raiders, but 1 raider shouldn't be able to breeze past 4+ missile turrets.
---
scouts mods arent compatible with urban armor for whatever reason. maybe what @Tradey76 mentioned above is responsible
---
Very interesting I'd like to know this as it would be nice to have a powerful deterrent from bloodied/cars crit grief teams. 
---
Because people would rather see the game sanitized than fight back or server hop.  My character is more built for crafting, but I still saved caps to buy a good enough arsenal to fight back.  If you play like a victim, people will mess with you.  But if you bring the pain, would be griefers back off.  
---
Yes. 
---
 My going rate is the suggested value, ill buy your quantum for 30 a piece
---
This way those 10 years old player with a deathclaw may stop to keep slapping you.
---
I've modded my whole set of urban, (plus my forest left arm)
---
Or get there and there‚Äôs 2 minutes remaining in the event and you can‚Äôt even compete. It would be nice if the map showed remaining time in an event before traveling to it. 
---
My guess last night was they sped stuff up the first night so that fermenting wouldn't seem to take as long. It may have been my imagination, but food seemed to be spoiling less quickly this morning.
---
Seems like a trend on this sub
---
Ps4. Looking for good quantum deals, else ill be sold out of vintage quick
---
Yeah, there was a loading screen when I went out the manhole ladder. It's part of the world already, its just that they haven't opened the entrances/exits yet. While I was down there (which was a while), creatures were spawning, loot items were there. It looked completely finished except for no sound on the holotape. It looked like a raider camp, but from Maude's journal, it appeared to be a group of survivors that had made their own clan. She talked about "The Burrow Boys" so maybe its a new faction/clan? 
---
Remember the Far Harbor fishermen? Or the mutant dolphin carcasses found on the fishing boats in the Commonwealth still relatively fresh? 
---
make them from bobby pins.
---
Working. As. Intended.
---
Wild Appalachia II - Milkman Cometh
---
Good idea! I will try this!
---
Vintage nukashine also gives 100% unarmed melee damage.
---
Curse these features designed to remove caps from the economy for removing caps from the economy!
---
This is just the cherry on the icecream ‚Äûwild apallachia‚Äú
---
I'm certain this is satire because you seen ignorant of how your actions actually affect other players. I think PvP was shown... _once_ in the marketing of the game. "Raiding" is about the least effective cap making method in the game, it certainly worked for you, but I imagine it would have been faster in other ways.
---
Destroying somebody's base _just_ to initiate PvP with somebody other than the person in that base may not be griefing, but it causes grief and great irritation, all so you can be an asshole on the internet and attempt to justify it. In no way was it advertised as a PvP game. A selling point was how easy it was to AVOID PvP. "Cops and robbers my ass. 
---
I understand the game I'm playing. You think you're playing Fortnite, while I'm playing Fallout. Raiders steal stuff, they trash houses but rarely destroy them to their base foundations in order to actually TRY and get killed.
---
You're a dick who tries to justify his behavior by being condescending online and trying to pretend you misunderstand the game when it's obvious you don't.
---
Either that or it's satire.
---
Thanks for the advise! Will considder this
---
I've been wanting this, too. I love how natural camo actually has an effect in-game. Like in Planetside, I can put on camo armor paint and snipe people from a bush for hours.
---
Maybe they could at least add wallpaper with existing textures.
---
Yeah why not make melee even better in PvP. Great idea
---
Bethesda, there have been many suggestions for fishing. This feature would fit in well with ‚ÄúWild Appalachia‚Äù as well. 
---
I would just need the fishing nets from far harbor to decorate my camp with ;)
---
This happened to me last night and I‚Äôm just a wee bit frustrated. Finally decided to relocate the camp I placed last year and settled on a nice spot out of the way overlooking Blackwater Mine and Whitesprings. I popped my CAMP carefully and just on the edge of an area that I wasn‚Äôt allowed to build in due to an existing structure.
---
After an hour or so of getting the foundations inch perfect with a cliff edge, a guy running a bloodied melee build started trying to grief me and initiate PvP as I was still building my CAMP. He destroyed a fusion generator and wouldn‚Äôt stop trying to slap me, but he wasn‚Äôt worth the hassle so I did a quick server hop. Came back to a message stating something like ‚ÄòFallout 76 update has added content that interferes with your CAMP placement. Here‚Äôs one free CAMP placement.‚Äô
---
The griefer pretty much stopped me from putting far more time into building my camp up, only to then find out that it was an ineligible location on my next log-in. 10/10, would be griefed again.
---
Thank you for the insight.
---
can't you see fish swimming when you walk underwater? or am I having a blackout drunk and remembering skyrim?
---
Yeah...this has been happening to me since the last patch. Switing into or out of my power armor does it too
---
As you post click on a part called tags and choose spoiler 
---
I noticed that last night.  Thought I'd had too much nukashine.
---
Yeah but the whole "Hell yeah I can build a fuckin base!" Factor made me go to any area and build so now I just move that around until I can live in the cranberry bog and put in next to a lead deposit
---
Something must have changed for the better then :)
---
When we checked the ARMO record was missing the 'ma' keyword which would have made the behaviour you describe impossible.
---
Why not both? Would be nice to have both. 
---
Worked for me. Did you drink the vodka? Hop servers might help
---
I dunno, still looks like an accident waiting to happen to me. Impressive, nonetheless.
---
I would love this, drink some beer and go fishing in west virginia... it fits!
---
If it's underground, doubt a nuke will affect it.
---
Ya.  Been a bug since the previous patch.  When they added the system that makes you automatically change weapons when your main breaks.  It messed up the quick change to last weapon feature. 
---
Tl;dr legendary 50 cal is still best? (Have a Furious one)
---
It's high voltage hefe for me but yeah, i drank one before every shot even tho it lasts 5 min.
---
I had the same keypad issue. Removing and replacing it seemed to fix it. There was a bit of lag in the door opening or closing, but I think that had to do with the amount of people on the server after the patch.
---
It depends.  You can get blocker, which helps mitigate melee damage.  Then there's ironclad, which adds defense when not in PA, Barbarian adds DR for every point in strength, evasive helps you avoid attacks altogether, moving target is similar,  and junk shield, if you're a hoarder, gives you more defense for junk carried.  
---
If you run a high health build, try to get a full set of even one start Vanguard armor; I use that sometimes and when I do, I have almost as much DR/ER as with my power armor, all that takes a hit is my rad resist.  There are also mutations that will add DR?ER.  Scaly skin is +50 to both, and Grounded is +100 to ER.
---
Yeah, I've toyed with trying to build a lookout-tower in the past and trying to keep the whole thing proportionate is difficult.  The most you can probably get away with is 2x2, but that's an awfully dinky space to put stuff (especially since one of those will be the stairway coming up).  I think you're on to something with having part of the base exist on the ground.
---
I love the idea and I think your right on the right track. I think its definitely worth a try and I do agree that all fissures must be closed in order to end the scortchbeasts/scortched. Just think it isn't feisable at this time in the game. I got a feeling Bethesda has a future dlc in store for all of us that have completed the main questline. Remember...there are hand scanners at the club housing area of Whitespring as well as the huge conference area inside the resort. "Presidential Bunker" ???. Only the President has access to that area as well as the ability to declare Devcon 1. Does this mean all those voting machines will be used to elect a president? Hmmm. The "POTUS" would also have access to all silos at once from his secure bunker. Back story mentions 3 spacestations that rained nukes down. One we know crashed that also has an inaccessible area at this time. I would think only a POTUS would be granted access to all silos as well as the remaining 2 satellite spacestations at one time. This would enable us to nuke multiple fissure locations simultaneously in order to seal them all for good.
---
If you can't place your CAMP it will always be free to move. The highest price I've ever experienced was 43 caps, but it's plausible that the price increased after the patch.

On PC i think VATS shouldn't exist in PVP. When dealing with armor, 2nd affix can be "Increases action point refresh speed", what means VATS player is getting VATS points faster, means it is boosting her DPS. Meanwhile non-vats has no 2nd affix that could boost your ranged damage. Same is with weapons, take 3rd affix-" 25% less VATS Action Point cost"," Your VATS critical meter fills 15% faster". Yes we can get 15% faster reload, but unlike VATS, that is active all the shooting time, we only get that 15% reload when we reload.
---
No because if rad-away does what it's called, people would throw it at other players using adrenal reaction and bloodied. It would be a troll tool.
---
Another user reported that their particular brew had a Vintage version that once they let it fully ferment to it worked.  Any chance maybe your high voltage can ferment one step further?
---
I've had my base leveled twice at Seneca Rocks, and twice in the Forest, and once south of the Nuka Cola Factory. I now have it in a secluded area that's hard to access without a jet-pack.
---
Yeah, probably. That would be a waste off hundreds of ghouls just dying to become Glowies.... 
---
With the amount of times that this has been suggested, I'd be surprised if a refrigeration system isn't implemented into the game eventually.
---
And by again, I mean I haven‚Äôt even launched one in the past week lok

Yeah and if you open a car pack and already have one of the cards maxed, you'd get the item associated with that card. 
---
Get a GunSmith Card you already have maxed? Here is a random gun that's scaled to your level. 
---
Get the Hard Bargain Perk Card after having it maxed, here is 50 Caps! 
---
Wow good idea that would be awsome to use on ghouls and even team mates.looks like u were creative today after all lol
---
10k. 
---
This will sound bad but I never even thought to destroy someone‚Äôs camp before these crybaby posts in a PvP survival game starting filling reddit. Now I like absolutely love just leveling people‚Äôs camps in the hopes it adds to the salty manbaby tears in this subreddit. Like it‚Äôs a video game guys, first world problems much?
---
Nope, if it would there would be "Ages into Vintage High Voltage Hefe" text in the description
---
Biv has a new quest everyday for more recipes. 
---
I'm on xbox!? Maybe that matters. Regardless you can find ultra light or dense or polymer mods and buy one to try it out. They're relatively cheap, just hard to roll for when you just want that 4th ultra light limb mod and every ultra light mod you buy ends up being for chest. 
---
holy shit just stop
---
so if it doesnt happen to you, it doesnt happen huh?   
---
man the internet is a cesspool somnetimes
---
My first  (non traded) TSE was like this.  In front of white spring golf club, post nuke and a ghoul drops.  I was freaking out cuz he was 3 star but his inventory was empty.  I must have checked him 7 times as the others ran downstairs.  
---
Eventually I hit the button to open the full transfer menu and after another minute or so there it was. Two shot explosive assault rifle with reload speed.  I saved the gameplay clip instantly, I figured no one would ever believe me. 
---
Game is weird man. 
---
Well.
---
First, try making a few vintage nukashine.
---
Then, RP a drunk fucktard. Every time you plan to log out, drink a nukashine, and on your next log in, play from wherever you wake up.
---
Try it without fast travel obv.
---
Also, try to get your various recipes. It will take some time.
---
Look at this guy, finding people who will trade end game items to him for caps... everyone I know wants trade for trade only.
---
The weird rag-doll seems to be a built in "quirk" of the engine. Every game since FO3 has some crazy physics in it.
---
This is interesting to know, because I ended up moving just a bit north of where I was out of an abundance of caution, but the game did appear willing to let me place the CAMP right back where it was.  Sweeping the old location with my CAMP object, I didn't see any "red" space, even though the area is now disqualified from building.
---
I see... do guns equipped make a difference? Silenced vs let‚Äôs say... a dragon rifle lol
---
I will definitely check it once I am home :)
---
Thanks for the heads up either way :)
---
That was the most pathetic thing I‚Äôve ever read
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying, the fish look new 
---
Tbh I kinda forgot about far harbor but they definitely aren‚Äôt extinct, and I doubt freshwater fish would be extinct in Appalachia‚Äôs rivers since half the map is barely irradiated.
---
So the manhole can't be entered from the outside?
---
Many more not responding messages followed by disconnect. Happened to me on PC three time in three hours of play this AM.
---
yes please 
---
Dm me the location please. 
---
I'd assume so - I think that's what Paladin Danse had on in FO4, and it looked badass.
---
Probably a place that WILL be no-build zone in a few weeks.
---
They're warning you ahead of time.
---
Hope to run across your camp soon ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Dogmeat sucked. He got me spotted and set off traps all the time. Wish I could have Heather from the FO4 mod 
---
After I did the initial nukashine quest I get no response from biv at all. He jabbers when I'm in the area but gives no quests or anything else.
---
In PVP does stealthboy make you untargetable for VATS? or cancel target if target activates stealthboy? If it does, stealthboy becomes "Must have" item for PVP.
---
There's many factors to come up with best, but you should be good.  That Furious 50 cal you have is what I would term as top tier.  From a legendary effects perspective I'd lean personally towards AAE for maximum damage output, but you'll get debate about that from the TSE club.
---
TL;DR - 50 cal and Gatling Plasma are top tier choices.
---
I‚Äôve got errands. I can party from, like, 2-4. 
---
So, you fast traveled to an open world event in the Mire, and "materialized" inside a cell? I wonder how often this happens. I've fast traveled and glitched into caves and stuff (set your camp in Harpers Ferry radioactive train tunnel, and you'll spawn in the rock wall part of the time) but I've never fast traveled to Sugar Grove and ended up inside Sugar Grove, even fast travelling to a teammate. 
---
Just to present a friendly but differing opinion... I am having great fun with a 3 pc mobile camp. Sleeping bag, cast iron cookpot, and a stash box (which will become a cooler as soon as I find the plans, to better fit with the "feel"). 
---
It fits with my "build", and frees up so much time, caps and resources for me to do other stuff.
---
I‚Äôm not talking about workshops I‚Äôm talking about camps. I enjoy the idea that you can attack workshops and it makes sense
---
explain why
---
I never said that. Why so hostile?  I am literally asking for people to share there thoughts.  
---
nope, there are still WS turret bases :(
---
Check the "Missile Silo Holotape" that you get when joining the Enclave before doing any silo runs.  It says how much time before they open (and it is showing these hundreds-of-hours times).  If you lost it or dropped it without knowing you had it, no worries - you can buy a new one from the production terminals in the Enclave bunker.  Don't try silo runs without it!
---
I have a couple hundred hours in, I've only had my base leveled once and haven't really been griefed otherwise. I've always wondered how some people seem to be such easy marks because honestly I usually went full play sessions without ever even seeing another person, let alone being griefed. 
---
yes. guns without suppression will decrease stealth when you fire. there is an audible element, not just line of sight.
---
Must‚Äôve had too much Skoo... I mean Nukashine...
---
I have replied on OP's thread with spoiler tags :)

‚ÄúWhy buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?‚Äù You‚Äôre not allowed to milk a cow that you don‚Äôt own. That‚Äôs not even a situation. Was that a problem at one point? Like, in the dairy community? Was that happening a hundred years ago in some village? Some Dutch prick was sneaking in at night being like, ‚ÄúAh-ha-ha, I take your milk.‚Äù And the farmer was like, ‚ÄúWell, then, this is your cow now.‚Äù And he was like, ‚ÄúNo, no proof of purchase.‚Äù And he ran off into the night.¬†
---
Also congratulations on your video buddy! I build traps and my friend tames things (he got a house cat haha amazing) and it NEVER crossed our minds to do that! Great job :) 
---
I don't know how you guys figure this stuff out so quickly but I love the fact that you do!  Thanks for the guide! 
---
What system?
---
Sorry, misread. That's what I get for posting when I've just woken up. :/
---
Do you think people in popular areas are more likely to be hit?
---
Sometimes there's a delay. It's a nightmare to find where the bloody thing lands so you can loot the \*level 5 hunter's pipe pistol that it drops. I got killed once when I waited for one to explode and it didn't happen for ages... right up until I approached it of course.
---
right on
---
Hope you get a piece of your own medicine soon üñïüíã
---
What is the deal with the underground locations?  They are part of Wild Appalachia, but is there a specific point mentioning them?  We know that Vault 94 is accounted for as being part of the "High Level Vault Raids."  I assume the "underground" is one aspect of those, and it involves more than Vault 94?
---
Crevasse dam.
---
Server hop that fast travel point and he'll be just up the road to the right...
---
yup with new pvp servers no excuse not to make the old PvE only everyone is happy
---
literally no drawback
---
Oh geez
---
Ok but just holding them will not affect visibility I am assuming?
---
Holy shiet
---
I owe you nothing. 
---
I'd really like to see this, I remember you mentioning something about pressure plates working under beds
---
Nope. It was missing after I popped out of it. I looked around for another entrance (it was on the road by the church SE part of Harper's Ferry). If you go directly to the road from the church (down the little hill with the barricades) its at the closest spot in the road next to an abandoned car.
---
You say that likes it's a bad thing.
---
I drank nuka shine and woke up to see three garden gnomes and a dead body
---
I‚Äôve had mine wiped a few times, but then I played the game some, and used my imaginary materials that required no real hard investment to procure to build a new one, cause that‚Äôs like 80% of this games gameplay loop currently. Wait a sec and I‚Äôll go make a whine post about it! 
---
I know.  But they're why your getting openly attacked.  Unless you're just really unlucky, people are targeting players that own workshops.
---
Damn that‚Äôs a good one!!!! The dude!
---
Whoa, new treasure trail?
---
correct. yet, moving with them drawn is ‚Äúlouder‚Äù than holstered.
---
other players can hear u draw (and reload) your weapon and at times i have thought PvE enemies can too!
---
Yes that's exactly what happened. I did a Rad-rat horde shortly afterward, and showed up inside Uncanny Caverns. I don't remember anything like that happening before. 
---
The hero we need. Thanks man. At least now I don't have to sit at 9% HP on SBQ. That was seriously suicidal.
---
I fully admit that the only reason I found it was due to datamining the games files.
---
There are 2 notes you can find, one inside the Nuka cola factory, and one near the crashed plane, that are supposed to lead you to all these locations. Though some of the locations arent mentioned in the notes so it still would take some guessing.
---
There have been many topics on this in the last couple of days.
---
Bruh, can't a man just make some ammo? üò¢
---
Sweet PA! And thanks for finding this out and making a vid.
---
I've seen "glowie bois" which I think is cute, but not seen many refer to them as glowies.  Glowies is cute too, I say go for it, keep calling them that.
---
I hope this gets noticed, this affects a lot of players.
---
No patch notes
---
Oh-oh
---
me_irl
---
People are heavily misunderstanding your post. It‚Äôs an interesting question and one I had pondered before myself. 
---
"Fun is subjective", I think that's what you're missing, mate
---
The part on the ground is solely to protect the junk extractor from the super mutants and scorched.  It was built into a hill, so the downhill side has stacked foundation pieces (1.5 floors) so there is no way to rebuild it anymore.  Also, the bunker is skewed about 30 degrees because there are two trees that it has to miss (by inches).  I've been camped out here since December.  In earlier versions I had the ability to drop down the center column to go collect the junk, but I stopped because I found that I always collect it when I arrive, not when I leave.
---
No changes at my camp, except when I stored and replaced my porch stairs the grass clipping through disappeared. Good news with the foundation pieces though, it seems they will place reliably over boulders without needing the campfire exploit. I placed one in a spot where I know it previously refused to allow it.
---
I wonder the same thing but apparently that makes me an asshole to some. I know it happens to people but I am genuinely curious as to the circumstance and what not. I would have no problem with bases being immune to player damage but it seems like 90% of the post about bases being destroyed are one time things. I'm probably wrong but people make it seem that way. "Oh no someone destroyed my base I must jump on reddit and demand they make bases indestructible" 
---
Another good point to the different perk cards and certain armors is that you can carry just as much if not more than what you can carry in certain PAs. I can carry around 350 without PA. 
---
&gt; I think that's the main issue with all the disappointed people lamenting that there are no (human) NPC
---
Bethesda: "we're making a game with no living human NPCs".
---
Sensible people who want human NPCs: "Ok, I'll play another game then".
---
Sensible people with can live without human NPCs: "That's an interesting artistic decision".
---
Whiners: "Whine".
---
This is awesome! Thanks for sharing, will definitely be following this guide later today! 
---
I completed the Tipsey Test: Whisky and Strength by just using one of the many Whisky I scavenged so don't bother crafting one if you already have one. Saves time. I didn't have any problems with completing the task of killing an enemy with melee while under the influence of Whisky. Just went outside and killed some ghouls and reported to Biv as normal. 
---
Might be a bug that happens from time to time. So far I haven't experienced it.
---
The die hards. There is always die hards for every franchise. 
---
Guys it's part of the game, I don't know what to tell you. Workshops make you vulnerable to attack but honestly you really don't even need them. They are just a shadow of what they were at launch in terms of utility. Thanks to the changes they've made to fusion cores, it might actually be necessary to farm those on occasion but otherwise you're better off just scavving for materials. 
---
I love PvP games but my Xbox hard drive is full of games that do it way, way better than 76 ever will so I don't mess with it on here. 76 is for PvE. 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b1fe6k/fallout_76_secret_nuka_cola_quantum_power_armor/
---
Cool that makes sense lol
---
If Nukashine was the only quest or content added in Wild Appalachia then yes I'd be totally underwhelmed.
---
But as the starter update of more and varied content coming it was a fine introduction.
---
I preferred them to start a bit on the small side when doing the content updates and hone their process well before getting bigger things. 
---
Yes, I recall seeing something like that...and i think there was standard "we'll look into it" answer. 
---
I actually do think this will go into the base game at some point though because if you're on a PC and you use the mod, you are at a distinct advantage over all console players... and most PC players for that matter. That'll drive BSG to level the playing field i think sooner rather than later. Complete speculation on my part though, YMMV!
---
no, you literally just said you are minimizing the experience of others because you dont believe its a problem as it hasnt happened to you.
---
We are all happy for you that you havent had your base destroyed.
---
but to accuse others of lying or whatever... you know what, forget it.   you are not worth it.  You do you. Have a beautiful day.
---
ill do ya one better ;) https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b1fe6k/fallout_76_secret_nuka_cola_quantum_power_armor/
---
No that's not my point, I'm just wondering where the fan base is, I see very little discussion on other forums like /v/ and it's not popular on Twitch. I'm wondering how the hell Bethesda is making enough to keep the servers up and constantly updating.
---
Hotfix incoming

[https://bethesda.net/community/topic/328556/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-march-15-2019?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/328556/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-march-15-2019?language%5B%5D=en)
---
Are you on PC or console? If on PC, are you using mods?
---
Sounds like Tesla Chest piece is a bad idea if using an Instigating Melee weapon.
---
If need be just change how the crafting perks work where they're not necessary to do certain things but they help, example: Without lockpicking perks you can't pick locks, what if the perks were changed so you could still pick the locks without them, but the perks just give a bigger radius, and hacking, the perks give you less decoys/more guesses 
---
You can craft your own ammo at a much greater rate, especially if you have the Super Duper luck perk, than you'd get from the ammo factory. That's the good news
---
Xbox
---
Thanks man
---
People watching a Twitch Stream does not give a good metric to how many people play the game.
---
I watch a lot of streams of games I don't play. 
---
So what you are missing is that not every player watches Twitch, and not every person watching Twitch plays the game they are watching.
---
&gt; Their way of wanting to experience the game doesn't outweigh yours, no. But yours doesn't outweigh theirs either.
---
So... it's not harassment because that's how they want to experience the game, even if you don't want to engage in PvP with them?
---
It is the point. 
---
You are playing a game where the rules are that if you are killed (not even necessarily play a player) than your junk can be stolen. 
---
If you know those rules and play the game, then you can't bitch about how you are being forced to participate. 
---
We need evil characters for drama. 
---
Its built into the game. It's the apocalypse. Do you think every person you see, you should just automatically assume they are friendly? YAWN!
---
Also, in a game where everyone says the AI is too easy, we need opponents with free thought, actual tactics, and even footing on gear and such in order to present a challenge. 
---
Is it too hard for you?
---
Besides, why do you ever ever ever have that much junk on you at any given time? You dont empty out before a Whitesprings run or when you are sitting at CAMP? What do you get at Whitesprings for example? Not much in the way of junk really. The worst you should lose on dying is a handful of plastic or a few springs or gears. Everything else is safe. Like 100%, can't touch if you tried safe. 
---
And I say this as someone who doesn't ever jack anybody or start fights. It's not at all my thing. 
---
But you do have to be ready for it at all times. 
---
If you mess with me I will go out of my way to fight you. What is there to lose? A half dozen pieces of steel scrap and a few caps. 
---
I like it.
---
I hope they aren't stealth nerfing things and they fix the hunger/thirst/spoilage rate bugs while they're at it.  Sick of spending 99% of my time eating/drinking instead of exploring and having actual fun.
---
I paid \~$35 for it.
---
Given that I'm past 300 hours, I'd say I got my money's worth, but I'd be willing to pay more if there was more interesting stuff in the Atom Shop.  It's a bit like Cities Skylines in that regard - a cheap initial price, but fun enough that you could probably ding me for $10-$15 DLC twice a year.
---
Lol np

RACIST!

You're doing God's work, don't diminish it ;)  I wouldn't likely have ever gone back to these locations if it weren't for your guide.

At least make the camps unable to enter (or tougher) with certain upgrades.   When almost every guy can avoid your locked door by hopping into with marsupial or jetpack, it kind of defeats the purpose of home security.  
---
My friend said he locked his front door once and someone determined to get in, just whaled on it for a bit and broke it down.
---
I get it's the wasteland, but, at leaat give us better ways to either avoid entirely or defend ourselves against level 250+ marauders
---
&gt;  I feel like I'm missing something obvious.
---
That the actual player count is most likely a lot higher than just those watching Twitch streams.
---
Twitch views isn't the same as game popularity.  There's overlap, sure, but it's not a 1:1 comparison.
---
FO76 isn't a *bad* game to stream exactly, but it's not a story-based or linear game.  There's a lot of grinding, and repeating activities that doesn't translate well into viewer engagement.  The same reason you don't see many Minesweeper casts - millions of people play it, but no one wants to watch people play it.
---
Probably fixing some of the issues that sprung up, like Nuke Cool down timers being way off.
---
Haha, thanks... undeserved fame to be sure. Just think the whole thing is hilarious. I'm currently in my 15th minute now. Looking forward to a comfortable return to obscurity where my builds will just be shitposts to Reddit again.
---
lol I don't get Triggered.
---
The concept of your OP is simply ridiculous in my view.  
---
Westek Developed Sapient Pearwood shortly before the bombs fell but were only able to implement a limited production run due to resource scarcity. 
---
I haven't got the High Voltage recipe yet.  Doesn't have a CND bar once you initially make it?
---
Just FYI, here's the topic I was referring to:  https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b1e77y/tipsy_taste_test_luck_bugged/
---
Just seemed the quest steps are not very clear about it being Vintage versions or not you are supposed to brew, and it seemed that the newer alcohols added (not Whiskey/Wine/existing ones) were able to be fermented further.
---
I agree, now I look for quiet out of the place areas that people do not frequent. Well except that I built a welcoming camp at the new vault entrance XD
---
Interesting, I got him to follow me into the camp, locked him in a room but when I came back later he was gone.
---
Same situation, but if you search in the Nuka Cola bottling centre, you find a note saying the Marketing director left to go on vacation in Watoga, maybe the marketing terminal in which you insert the holotape is there ? but it must be an unmarked location
---
Oh that's good to know. Thanks.
---
Use good with salt perk?
---
&gt;I'm just wondering where the fan base is
---
Probably playing the game rather than watching it. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 
---
I was clearing out west tek and lobbed a few grenades only to see a high level player run past me get hit by the explosion then came back to kill me. However at the speed he was moving and he didn't appear on the map had me convinced he was hacking. 
---
I think it‚Äôs a thing. I call them glowies. 
---
That may be more complicated than it seems.  I haven't had any issues with any of that (though I know people are widely reporting it).  There may be a specific combination of cards/perks/mutations that are either causing it or preventing it that will take a bit to figure out.
---
And i cant mod that chest given as Q reward from Enclave.
---
I fully agree with OP.
---
1. Fallout 1's Special Encounters aren't canon and basically trigger only with a high luck stat. These events occur so seldom that I don't see how they could possibly make the overall game "funny". They're part of the game, sure, but the depressing and bleak atmosphere outweighs these encounters by a long shot. The dark humor had been carefully balanced to NOT interfere with the tone of the game.
---
2. There's an enormous difference between having a selected few easter eggs or movie references on the one hand and building a game whose narrative and storytelling is deliberately designed to be silly on the other hand.
---
3. The silliness as a deliberate design choice was kicked into full overdrive when Bethesda acquired the franchise and released Fallout 3. It was certainly NOT the intention of the creators of the original Fallout to fling mini nukes at enemies, blow up cars for fun, tame Deathclaws or get irradiated on purpose in order to be able to run faster or jump higher.
---
4. Here are some examples taken from the first Fallout and the first *Bethesda* Fallout:
---
- F1: radiation is a serious and lingering mortal danger „Ää„Äã F3: getting irradiated for Moira's Survival Guide is a funny wacky quest experience and you're healed/rewarded afterwards.
---
- F1: The upbeat oldies music is only used in the intro and outro for the sole purpose of storytelling „Ää„Äã F3: casually fighting enemies while oldies are blaring from the Pip Boy and Three Dog is making his ridiculous announcements.
---
- F1: makes almost no references to patriotic nationalism, because the game was primarily about portraying a dead nation „Ää„Äã F3: corny references to bad communism vs glorious capitalism and its crazy implications are everywhere and a big part of the game... hillarity ensues.
---
5. New Vegas, albeit not developed by Bethesda, HAD to be built upon Fallout 3 and HAD to address Bethesda's newly introduced changes to the franchise or else it would've been too big of a break with the former title. The tone of New Vegas HAD to match Bethesda's "vision" for the future of the series.
---
6. Fallout 4 greatly amplifies rather than rebalances most of the quirkiness deliberately introduced in Fallout 3: radios playing oldies music everywhere, skeletons in ridiculous postures everywhere, references to the corrupt US government and corporations everywhere with entire quests dealing with the crazy consequences, running around wearing crazy outfits and wielding crazy weapons, exploring crazy locations with crazy backstories, ...
---
6. And Fallout 76, boy oh boy, is the absolute PINNACLE of CRAZY - having almost nothing in common with the tone, design and narrative of Fallout 1 + 2.
---
Conclusion / tldr: it was Bethesda who took the original source material and deliberately changed the Fallout formula. Fallout started out as a revolutionary and balanced mix of occasional pitch-black humor and an overwhelming sense of desolation in a post-nuclear world. 
---
Since then, the franchise has gotten progressively crazier, wackier and over-the-top with each new installment‚Ä¶ and if this trend continues unabated, the series is bound to fully spin out of control.
---
Fallout is no longer "Fallout". 
---
That's not necessarily a bad thing and that doesn't mean that 76 is a bad gaming experience. Being over-the-top is fun. Exploring crazy locations is fun. The new world is fun to be in. 
---
But 76 is no longer a "Fallout" game.
---
Hotfix coming today
---
I think only if you have a full set of weightless armor
---
&gt; There will be no patch notes following today's hotfix.
---
They need to stop this. MMOs need to be as transparent as possible to create community trust and accountability. No one asks for perfection, just for the why's
---
What happens when we speak out about how much we love the game? Labeled crazy for liking something so ‚Äúuniversally hated‚Äù. It‚Äôs more than the sum of its parts and hard to explain what makes it so appealing to many of us. I for one love it and am about 500hrs in. Not for lack of other games to play. And I‚Äôm not a die hard fan. It‚Äôs just a fun, peaceful experience returning to Appalachia and my camp every day. The player base is there, just intentionally way more silent than with other games 
---
It doesn't have a CND bar after i turn it to High Voltage Hefe
---
Without knowing the exact statistics, we can't just assume that the player base is small. 
---
There is some quests/event stuff in game files that describe an event where players race to collect votes to become president... So that may be a possibility ;) 
---
President of Fallout 76 at least!

Hang on to yours meat bag...
---
My biggest complaint with 76 isn't that there is PvP. I think that's awesome. It's that there's PvP with legendary weapons and armor that have what can only be described as magical properties, insane buffs from consumables that can be stacked, and the ability to spam healing that can mitigate damage down to nothing. Utter garbage. 
---
76 PvP could really be a lot of fun if they'd ditch that garbage but Bethesda wanted to make a loot grinder so that's what we've got. 
---
Is it glitched for everyone or just random?
---
Whats the cut off in this regards?
---
Bethesda needs to work on coordinating with their CMs so important stuff like this is announced through an official channel rather than someone (or Youtuber...??) relaying that information from another official channel they just happened to come across.
---
Is it really that hard to have these notices ready to go on all official communication channels before clicking the submit buttons?
---
&gt;Becoming WANTED to attract bounty hunters was something intended by Bethesda. You need a high bounty to make the trip worth a bounty hunters time. The only way to rack up a worth while bounty is to wreck an entire CAMP.
---
This whole sentence made me think of the WoW episode of South park
---
What are you hoping to catch in those irradiated septic tanks?! Holy hell... look at the rads you get from just WADING in that stuff, now imagine eating some bottom filter feeder that lives in it!!

I have my current base for my alt on a popular junk pile and am waiting for someone to attack it. If it happens I'll just move. Thanks for not verbally attacking me tho. Some people here seem pretty hostile about this subject

From what I gather it's everyone.  Hotfix today is supposed to address that and fermenter issues.

I ended up leaving him alone for a few hours while I went and made more nukashine, came back and he gave me the 2 repeatable quests. 
---
On a side note, damn that nukeshine is good. But after like 3 hours of play and chugging booze like a fish, my character is an alcoholic now. Lol. I guess I won‚Äôt be seeking adictol anymore. 
---
3x3 would look good as well and you could make a spiraling staircase with landings.  You can't viably get stairs to work in a 2x2 because if you use 1/2 size ends, people fall off as they round the stairs.  I don't mean they fall off the outside edge, but they fall between the stairs or next to the stairs.  I had the same issue here, so I have some strategically placed stash boxes to funnel the players to the stairs.  The height is enough to kill anyone without 100% fall damage or power armor.
---
You can make a 2x3, and even enclose it, but it doesn't look that good.  Stacked stairs are a horror so stay away from them (if the stacked beam placement exploit still works) - it's too easy to mess up and have to destroy your entire camp to fix it.
---
The real trick to Shotguns, imo, is the Enforcer perk.  Almost every weapon has its own version of the "chance to cripple" perk card, but Enforcer's happens to have a 30% chance at its maximum rank.  That means that if you fire toward the legs or the head, you're basically *going* to cripple before the next reload, no matter how much damage you're actually doing.  This neutralizes pretty much every enemy, short of the SBQ, allowing you to finish them off with a more efficient weapon.
---
The reason i like my idea better is it gives more utility to peoples camps. You definitely over reacted to my statement. 
---
Obviously it can be done in the pip-boy or even better, the main game start menu. My point was simply to have a creative solution we can upgrade in base. Maybe even allowing people to go to your radio desk and it will list your best raid times.
---
The upcoming pacifist update should solve all your issues. Its supposed to make it so players are unable to damage your base while your in pacifist, and make it harder to flag for pvp.
---
I was. I loved that feature and appliance in my apartment. Tied the house together.
---
The point is it was pretty recently killed and cooked right before signing off. I expect the status of everything to be the same when I sign back in.
---
Yes it was in fallout 3 you could get a nukachiller at the megaton settler home. 
---
Yeah, I had to find Aster I think for mine, and it took a little while.
---
I really really wish we could plant everything, or even like some kind of mini herb garden that'd let you plant just one of each type of plant or something.
---
Battle Royale games are an entirely different beast in regards to viewers. I hate playing Battle Royale games, but love watching them.
---
"press A to cast, press A to reel in, repeat until RNG gives you the rare fish you need for your achievement, and then never fish again!"

Those farms won't be fair game if this gets implemented. Expect turret farms to become the norm if you can't do anything about it.
---
There is a note which says that the head of marketing will be departing for vacation in watoga. i think his house will have a marketing terminal to unlock with that access code, but the house is gonna be an unmarked location i think
---
And? THAT SOUNDS AMAZING.
---
If there's a client update someone will post patch notes in the form of a datamine.  I don't think they can change skills/perks/mutations without a client update, right?
---
but theres no numbers to go off of so its not like theres any point to it. and the ammo is way too expensive for a little upgrade on a specific mob.
---
Haha! And with a video too.
---
Thanks :)
---
omg i cannot upvote this enough, i actually laughed out loud at work
---
This.
---
I disconnected during my first quest, and it switched the alcohol I was supposed to drink when I rejoined.  My first quest initially said "Beer".  Then I disconnected (random server crash) and ended up getting the same quest but with "Oak Haller Lager" instead.
---
Curious if you disconnect does it update your alcohol to a different option as well?  Maybe reseting and giving a new chance for it to be one that works properly?
---
God I hope so. There's a lot I don't like, but the only thing I really hate is being harassed by pricks. I reckon a lot of players are afraid to start new characters because a well-equipped level 142 character doesn't have to worry as much.
---
I love making new characters. I'm on my 5th or 6th.
---
It would be cooler if they were interactive like the bobble head displays. 
---
Wouldn‚Äôt that just be a false sense of security? They can still stealth stuff in or out.
---
&gt; I am out here building really crazy things for one person to see haha
---
This is one of the main reasons I built in Flatwoods because it was close enough to be visible. There are other areas that get a lot of foot traffic though, like the Charleston station and the road north of Flatwoods (everyone starting the game goes down this road). Whitesprings gets a lot of foot traffic as well. 
---
I do a lot of server hopping and checking the map to see who "might" wander by and then hang around there for a while. Especially in Flatwoods you can almost be sure someone will come through from the Northern part of the map.  
---
Right now the area south of the tattoo parlor is getting a lot of traffic because of the Nukashine quest so that's a good spot at the moment as well.
---
I need an editor lulz. I‚Äôm so terrible at sitting down to make a video, I have hours of raw footage but do almost nothing with it, maybe one day haha. I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre on Xbox? So much easier if you could just come there. 
---
I‚Äôll get some photos with the bed on and off and post it sometime soon. You need to use a conduit extension piece to lift the bed a couple inches to hide the wire but the plate fits np :) 
---
Older demographic would be my guess. My 13 year old nephew plays fortnight and watches streams of others playing games. None of my friends watch other people play games.
---
They can be, but I am not. It's tiring to go find a puddle after going to a nukezone or someone using radsponge, which this grenade would most definitely be used to troll people with lots of rads.
---
Nah, hooks and rods should be durable... line though... where the hell you gonna find a roll of monofilament in the wasteland, and what do you when it breaks?

Build that wall!  Vault 76 will pay for it!  Make Appalachia Great Again!
---
Yeah I think you're right. I will say though I can kind of relate. When my base got leveled I was about as angry as I've ever been over a video game LOL don't think I bitched about it on here but I may have in a Facebook group. 
---
Oh it sometimes occurs with non robot things as well even non legendary.  Had two level 68 Super Mutants explode just last night.  But yes you are correct with the legendary robots. The combat ones with tracks (forget what they are called) which drop fusion cores , also explode legendary or not.
---
Not everyone I saw a nuke 2 hours ago
---
I call them something that will probably get me banned if I commented it
---
Since when do Twitch viewers determine whos actually playing  a game? 
---
Also, you cannot compare Free Games to games people have to buy.  There is a really obvious gap there.
---
Roadmap says the vault raids aren‚Äôt until the Nuclear Winter update. I think whatever this is, its something different. 
---
Yeah good point, that's probably it!
---
Would be nice but highly unlikely they will  ever do that since this game is basically massively PVP focused and a hell of a lot less PVE focused (like they been claiming)...so unless they step up they‚Äôre A game they will lose a shit ton of players quicker then they can say ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù...maybe once their new Surival PVP strictly mode comes out griefing assholes will focus their tactics on other PVP players and not on players who simply want to play without PVP tuning the game for them my friends and I have been having these issues (except they never fully destroy our camps) but they do one shoot us with explosive billets even after their ‚Äúso called‚Äù perks being nurfed they still manage to kill us and they farm us for caps or junk I had a level 6 kill me with explosive bullets that a level 6 can‚Äôt get so I‚Äôm assuming some are moding illegally and cheating (because it‚Äôs a multiplayer game and on console which is an auto ban for anyone found cheating aka moding so they get an unfair advantage over others like high levels using shit and buffing it with mods just to kill low levels for caps and junk I mean seriously now it‚Äôs getting way out of hand I have almost quit due to this shite)...hoping Bethesda takes their customers seriously and start listening and fixing the game and making it better for non PVP players I mean I don‚Äôt want this to be come another PUB, Apex, Fortnite, etc etc this game needs to be like Fallout 4 quest and exploration focused for crying out loud...so yes you are not alone in this...
---
Would be swell if they fix the vendor screen, as it no longer allows players to inspect multi-star items yo check on secondary perks.  
---
Also, the "inspect" screen in pipboy is broken.
---
Radaway is technically used with an IV to flush your system so not sure how it would work as a grenade but it's an interesting idea
---
I don't think the pvp servers are going to work how you think.  For example, I plan on bouncing in to fight some and regrouping in adventure.  I'm thinking it as more of a deathmatch style game mode than a permanent one.  Adventure will probably be where everyone stays mainly.  
---
Yeah I keep trying to get the Buried With Honor daily to pop up. I‚Äôve only done it probably 4 times my whole play through  
---
Preaching to the choir, buddy. I can't imagine any player objecting to having both options available. Simply stating a preference.
---
Hah, I can see it now... "I got something!" (cue mirelurk running out of the water with a  hook in it's mouth)
---
BTW, anyone else wish the mirelurks had more of the "man in a bug rubber suit" look of the earlier Bethesda FO games? I felt they fit way better with the "50s sci-fi gone bad" feel of OG Fallout.
---
i think he is the guy that died in the plane crash? went on "vacation" (they were after him) but the plane crashed.  Well watoga/cranberry bog had something to do with the nuka paint quest line so it could be there?
---
My luck perk slots are used for other things in my build, A, and B, it doesn't much mitigate the issue.
---
Wow thanks a bunch! I'm Combuster007 by the way.
---
i've come across 3 in the mire, twice while doing the daily cryptid hunt
---
I don't edit hardly at all so most of my videos are pretty shitty. The videos are downloaded from xbox and the only thing I do is trim them using the built-in windows editor (don't even know what it's called)... dumped them in Windows movie maker and stuck an mp3 in the background. Done. Truly garbage quality.
---
I hunt other players Lvl. 50 and up. 
---
Why care about a games popularity?
---
Why does what other people are playing matter to you?
---
You enjoy it or you don't.
---
As for metrics, look at the sidebar there are 3000 active in this subreddit. That's more than the main fallout. Given that the Player to Redditor ratio would probably be similar I'd suspect more are playing this game at the moment than previous Fallouts. I'd look at the active redditor count bounce it against the active steam count and get a decent swag of a number.
---
There is some overlap for sure but it would inside of an order of magnitude if I had to guess.
---
How would it differ from gathering Mutfruit, or killing chickens for meat? It's just another form of harvesting?
---
The game was worth the $70.00 I paid on day 1.  I've got over 600 hours in game, did/does it have it's issues? Yes, did they release it too soon (unfinished) yes.  But, like I said, it's an amazing game that through patches gets better and better.  
---
I'd check it out. 
---
having fish attack you would definitely make you think twice about swimming. And would give me someplace to throw all these grenades I have LOL
---
This has always happened it‚Äôs nothing new. Legendary robots have been exploding for a long time.
---
This concerns me. When folks intentionally glitched into the dev room, people got banned. If you can teleport into cells simply fast travelling, how do I not get banned if I end up somewhere I shouldn't? Have you notified Bethesda, either ticket or a community manager like u/Ladydevann ?
---
Well, the new design is certainly an improvement.
---
I had my base attacked once because a friend started a fight in a nuke zone and stupidly FT to my base so they followed him. When I saw the message I just moved it. No big deal for me. I understand how it would suck having to move if you spent hours building a base which I did and was unable to place it back down because of the stupid way camp blueprints work but it wasnt a huge deal for me.
---
I mean, let's be honest, some parts of this game are so fucking boring I don't even want to watch myself play. I just got to the bunker last night on my second character and MODUS talks so goddamn fucking slow that I put my controller down and took a piss and got a snack and the fuck face was still talking with long winded gaps in between each word.
---
Was this new or been in the game? So sick. How could someone randomly complete this without data mining? It almost seems like a troll by bethesda because how in the world is someone supposed to know how to complete this? Is it possible this is from future quest or just an easter egg?
---
That's more of an incentive! lol  
---
I use adrenal reaction and personally if someone used a grenade as a deterrent for it that would be a great fight!
---
Eh, if we're going to go the "Healing effects can just be sprayed on people" route having more options for team healing would make more sense.
---
Ehhh dense mod ‚Äúshrugs‚Äù
---
Locked bathroom in nukacola plant
---
Thanks, but it is 24 wall sections just for the tower. My poor budget.  lol
---
Oh it was some lvl 49 that drop it so dk if he got that much knowledge lol
---
This is what I do. I scroll through and compare stats of the mods.
---
&gt;One of the two who do talk about it, he didn't like watchning Mad Men. It didn't want to make him relapse,
---
You already had your answer. The same logic would apply to this game. Some people may be triggered by the consumption of alcohol in an fictional environment. Some won't everyone is different.
---
I wish your friends the best and hope they never relapse into addiction.
---
If you don't know about sometihng you ask a question. Thats one way of educating yourself and thats what I did.
---
Every question you have forms in your head with an idea. You have to find out, if that idea is viable or not. 
---
What I find ridiculous is when you form an opinion and never try to verify or falsify it.
---
Call me ridiculous all day long, I don't have a problem with that.
---
They said in the update it's a repeatable "Daily" quest. So my best guess is that it's 20 hours like the daily vendor reset and other stuff.
---
That seems to be a good way to deal with it. I would say I only feel bad for the people who are actually being grieved by someone multiple times but they can just block them and leave server
---
Maybe that‚Äôs the way forward then, get data miners to do the patch notes except for server patching of course :D
---
More along the lines of PvP isn't better than PvE and PvE isn't better than PvP. I just don't think the two camps are going to get along any time soon so it'd be better to have open-PvP servers and closed-PvP servers rather than what we have now which lumps two very dissimilar play styles in the same place.
---
That's great news. Except I can't use my main now. Patch 7 broke it and I cannot even connect to a server. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0ytb6/comment/eija0oz
---
I didn't submit a ticket. They seem to have their hands full. Apparently someone glitched a month ago into Vault 63, submitted a ticket, and they said something like "Glad you made it out safely!" (cool response)... so if it happens by accident then I'm sure its not big deal. If we tried to exploit our way in (now that we know where it is) that would be f'ed up and should be banned. I felt bad enough that I posted some info about it but when something totally random happens (and its a very cool spot to get people excited about) then its hard not to yell from the rooftops about cool upcoming content! 
---
I'm not saying I condone actual griefer behaviour (IE; slapping someone and following them around until they relog/retaliate and you one shot them), but I do absolutely understand why people have turned to it.  People are, well, people, and unpredictable.  How they react can't be counted upon like npcs or robots.  It can be entertaining to torment someone when you have nothing else to do-- but it doesn't really make it okay.
---
that‚Äôs hot
---
I don't have it set up for automatic updates.
---
I still think you could have PVP in workshops on PVE only servers, if you allowed the owner of the workshop to disengage and concede the workshop. Also only allow pvp within the boundaries of the contested workshop and only by the person contesting the workshop not other members of their team. However instead of killing them they would be knocked out and then the workshop would belong to the victor.    
---
Nope. Gathering mutfruit is a click. Killing a chicken is 2 clicks. Most games that add fishing (like world of warcraft or stardew valley) do it wrong. Make it this mundane task that's needed to progress some type of benifit or cool loot, but at the cost of being dreadfully boring. Once they add it, they'll feel the need to make quests, or some other mechanic to follow it so it feels fleshed out.
---
I'd much rather them add something more fun. Why spend time learning how to make a fishing minigame when they can build raids or new locations.
---
Shoot just to it like skyrim and add a fish in the water you click to capture. Theres your fishing mini game. 
---
Hope they don't fix the lights showing the nuka cola, I kind of like it in my camp lol
---
Going through your comments it is VERY clear how negative a person you are. Try being less of an asshole to everyone. 
---
where exactly at silva are the razor grains?
---
The good ol‚Äô milk and kill.
---
yes, but now its instantly blowing up
---
Read the roadmap
---
Not an MMO. 
---
Some fixes have zero to do with players.  Maybe they need to do something to prep for the parade next week.  Maybe they need to upgrade software on the servers.  You do not need to know everything a company does. 
---
After reading some one else say he got one after spamming interact with Biv me and my friend tried that and it worked. Sadly for me he gave me a recipe that requires flux and I‚Äôm nowhere near being able to get that. Least not in one day. 
---
OMFG no screenshots?!?
---
Fast traveling solves this. Slap damage does close to 0 damage. Server hopping solves this. 
---
Annoying? Maybe. 
---
Easy to outheal? Definetly.
---
Hotel? Trivago
---
I don't think it makes it okay either but you're right, people are people. 
---
nipple tickle across the room ftw
---
Search the reddit or read the road map... So many people have already asked this! 
---
Fishing in video games... I never understood the appeal. 
---
Those sound typical of duper incidents.
---
Thankfully they're starting to really die off with stuff being deleted and weight limits keeping them from continuing. It might be a few days before they're weeded out.
---
As mentioned above there are 2 notes, one in the nuka cola power plant located in a small room only really accessible from the roof(level 3 lockpick) Which tells you to check Tanagra and ["that place where i put the thing that time"](https://imgur.com/a/5En5OKi).
---
The other note is located near the plane crash but I couldn't find it. All it says is that whoever had that access code at the plane crash is fired effective immediately from Nuka Cola Corp and some other stuff. No mention of any locations.
---
So is this In game? Jsut really hard to get?
---
Nope. I'm an idiot, got excited and completely forgot. 
---
Lol. Not selling. I‚Äôve collected  ( not bought) over 100 since game start.  
---
I have less now that I‚Äôve used fine to make vintage nukashine. . 
---
Yeah. Heard it in Watoga from quite a distance last night.
---
Well damn.
---
Regardless, the actor they got absolutely NAILED it and I'm loving his work!
---
I was instantly blown up by a legendary Watoga bot last night after hitting it with a Deathclaw Gauntlet.
---
im on PC, thx tho. 
---
i think i will get a mod for myself and check again
---
I've been hearing more from people that got banned in the February ban wave that they're getting lifted. I know for a guaranteed, 100% fact that this ban wave suspended innocent players. I don't know about previous ban waves.
---
I do daily challenges and save up atoms.  Sell crap, grind events for rare outfits.  Play around with different weapons/mods and perks.  Sometimes I'll go on a legendary grind fest, but not often these days.  
---
I don't play as much as when I first started for sure, but treat it more casually.  
---
Pve servers would make this game a million times more fun to me, and I'd actually try to interact with other players outside of people I know instead of leaving areas when I see them.
---
I build a new elaborate camp almost every other day, getting more and more familiar with the building mechanics. [This design](https://imgur.com/gallery/eyJaePc) I‚Äôve been working on only took about half an hour to set up last night! 
---
Ehhhhh, its hard to find. Once you know the locations for all the steps its easy to get :)
---
Yeah
---
Dailies now only happen daily ? Before a quick server hop would trigger a daily not anymore am I right ?
---
Ya.  Sucks that we can‚Äôt plant every plant.  Would be nice to get a few things like snap tails, tar berry, etc. 
---
He's so Legendary he hasn't spawned yet.
---
Thx. I'm actually using brick &amp; metal Walls, and have 2 Windows. Making power armor unable to pass through walls during placement doesn't seem that complex.
---
I'm close to that with my main character.
---
My camp is a sleeping bag, a stash box, a cook station, and a campfire. I move it every night to my current location. I don't use a foundation, I seek out a decent location and just drop stuff on the ground. (I wish the game had a 1x1 groundsheet)
---
Crafting is done as I find benches, where I find them. 
---
I carry a hunting rifle, a .44, and a camp axe. That's it. 
---
I only wear underarmour, no outfits, and stick to light gear... I've worn heavy steel armour before, there's no way anyone is pounding through the bush all day in that stuff.
---
I have a bunch of other "house rules" I apply to myself to make the game more "fun" (to me). It's slow going, but I love it. 
---
I was actually pleasantly surprised with it, and it took me closer to 30-40 mins. I really enjoy Biv(more than Grahm even), and the history of the two fraternities as well. 
---
I noticed this as well on PC.  He's very quiet compared to other NPCs.  Strangely, he actually seems louder as you are exploring the building than he does when you're standing right next to him.
---
How do the notes work? Is it hints or something?
---
Maybe they accidentally unbanned some people and are patching that.
---
Please point out to me where it was advertised as a survival pvp game. I had a logical argument, barring the insults. And me calling you a dick is not nearly as bad as levelling somebody's base. It takes a lot less time to shrug off an insult than to farm scrap.
---
It seems to be _you_ who can't empathize. "I'm not destroying everything you worked hard to build to make you feel bad, so don't whine lmao you're the one playing this like Fallout when it's clearly Rust". You're willfully and purposefully doing things that you _know_ make people feel bad just to partake in a part of the game that is marketed as optional.
---
This. Is not. A survival. PvP. Game. 
---
It's not.
---
It's not been advertised as such.
---
It doesn't function as such.
---
You are making other people feel bad so you can have fun.
---
Idk man, sounds pretty awful. Certainly worse than a few bad words, imo
---
I got a zelots board yesterday
---
/sigh
---
except that lvl 6 scorched with the shotgun is doing a lot of damage and staggering me every 3 seconds.
---
All armor mods are available in the military wing once you're a general with the Enclave.
---
They're random though, and poorly named. Like the name/weight/cost/etc for Pocketed (Chest) and Pocketed (Limbs) are 100% identical, so you can't tell them apart and have to just keep buying hoping you get the right ones.
---
Plus half of them don't work at all on either set of armor. There are two types of limb mods, and some of them are generic "any limb" like Pocketed or Ultra-Light, and some are limb specific. The limb specific ones don't work at all.
---
I have a full set of polymer ultra-light scout armor, and I had to waste a lot of money on duplicate mods until I get the full set.
---
Omg a Quick fix from bethesda ü§© i like the style they‚Äôre adopting
---
I don't know what your DR/ER is at, but my non power armor main sits at around 445/503. 3 vanguard pieces, Dodgy, Evasive, Ironclad. The only place I feel weak is nuke zones, where I'm restricted to just my prototype hazmat suit.
---
Right, but we've all been there in one game.  Just because 1 person is a prick doesn't mean everyone is.  Nor should the game be fundamentally altered because a few people had a bad experience.   Fallout caters to multiple game play styles.  This is why I say pve only servers won't work.  However, pacifist is a great deterrent.  At the end of the day, I think a lot of people didn't realize what type of game they were getting into and Bethesda did a terrible job setting expectations.
---
...fucks sake
---
What do you mean "exploit"?  
---
Because my absolute most favorite thing to do is to find a way to get somewhere that the devs didn't want you to go, or a via a route that they had not intended.  
---
Such as using the "Gravity Gun" to collect way more things, boxes, etc. than the devs imagined I would bother to do, to stack them up and go over a fence (that they didn't intend for players to go over) etc. etc.  
---
It is for this reason that one of the things I hate most of all in life, is "invisible walls" in games.  If anything should be banned, it's those.
---
There is no skeleton near the note though, i think he's dead in the Dome 7
---
Those cheating scum should‚Äôve been banned forever
---
same here
---
I hope they fix the remote brahmin milking, the game is unplayable with this bug :-p
---

---
Seriously though, I hope they are fixing this, as that looks like a really nasty bug.[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0ytb6/game\_breaking\_fermenter\_bug\_do\_not\_do\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0ytb6/game_breaking_fermenter_bug_do_not_do_this/)
---
Wow, I figured it would be the same for all gauntlets. Maybe the power fist is the only exception. 
---
The mods aren't named properly, so there's a good chance you've got a "Limb" mod not the "Chest" one.
---
For example, I have a full set of polymer ultra-light scout armor. But for both of those mods I had to repeatedly buy all the ones he had listed to figure out which one was the chest piece and which one was the limb piece.
---
76 is an MMO, raids are being added shortly.
---
The hotfix is for bugs introduced since the last update, not to prep for new content.
---
And yes the community needs to know more. Like I said, we don't ask for perfection, MMOs are complicated beasts, we do ask for the change set to player visible things. Nukes not working correctly overly accelerated foid spoilage. Etc... 
---
We don't need to know things like: Had to change a certificate on servers, or update server OS etc... Those are not game changing things. 
---
I don't know if they've fixed this yet - I mean I HOPE they would've fixed it by now - but there used to be a bug where you could unintentionally jack up the price of placing your camp.
---
For example, let's say the cost of moving your camp is 40 caps.  Fine.  You pick a good spot, you open your camp, you go to place it but you decide you need it just a few paces away.  You keep the "camp placing" interface open.  You take one step, that's another 40 caps.  You take a second step, now you're in for 80 extra caps.  You place your camp and your 40-cap charge costs you 120 caps since it was counted as three "moves."
---
The first note is the only real hint, but yeah, they are supposed to be how you solve this puzzle. Despite not being very good hints.
---
Ignore him.  He's a WingDing
---
This is why I don't pay outrageous prices for equipment. Gives me something to do.
---
I got a level 25 executioner's bat with swing speed. Dropped it to a guy levelling in the ash heap. He was pretty happy to see it.
---
I like the idea, because I like finding new plans. And the name is great.
---
But I hate the notion of another card, like lockpicking or hacking, that I have to remember to swap in and out for a brief window of time. Until they implement always-on passive perks in some fashion, I'd rather not increase that set.
---
God can‚Äôt wait to get this paint job once I level up to wear x01 power armor 
---
This is a terrible idea. There is a confirmation screen asking if you would like to upgrade the card. Being able to downgrade a card destroys permanence in choices. Did you even play the other Fallout games? You had to choose your perks wisely as you couldn't get every perk. 
---
If anything, let us TRADE cards to other players. This would be a lot better of a system. Some people may want to try to get every animated card. Some may have picked a card they thought was useful, but it turned out was useless to them.  Some may specifically rank up certain sought after cards to trade with other players. Make it a value for value trade. 
---
Every report feature will always be abused. It sucks but true
---
Is it better for a man to have chosen evil than to have good imposed upon him? 
---
I'll admit I have a weird play style.  I do the 'solo lone wanderer stealth' type build in exactly the same way I play Fallout 3/4/NV.  However, I actively avoid other players....so I crouch a lot more.   It works well for me.   You are correct in that high level players walking around kind of breaks immersion for me.  They often want to 'give me things'...but I don't want 'em.  I want to discover the game for myself!   
---
loot is instanced to the looter. No reason it should not scale to the looter as well.
---
Nice find ! Going to look for this even thou i dont use power armor much outside nuke zones
---
I don‚Äôt see how its ok for an npc to destroy your base but not a player. It literally results in the same thing, im not even a griefer but I think you should just accept them as a part of the game people are gonna be nice some people are gonna not be nice its the wasteland. It would be boring if nothing bad could happen to you. I know thats not a popular opinion but thats my 2 cents you can even log off if you really dont want to deal with a griefer.
---
Multiplayer fallout sounds amazing to me. I remember being super hyped for it before release then I heard all the bad stuff and started reconsidering the purchase. Sadly, most of my friends probably won‚Äôt buy the game because if the bad impressions. 
---
OK, well, I won't downvote you - because it's not like you're doing a bad thing telling us about something you saw, you can't go back and take pictures since you left, so, too bad.
---
You do know that first M stands for Massive.
---
24 players on a server is NOT massive.
---
Also, you sure the raids are going to be just like MMO raids?
---
1. I can‚Äôt search reddit on my phones reddit app (tried)
---
2. I looked at the road (allegedly it was supposed to come in this update)
---
3. If that‚Äôs the case I googled it (and nothing came up imagine that üòí)
---
&gt; btw: standing still in combat is dumb
---
What if you are role playing as an elderly Vault Dweller with a bad hip condition?
---
I don't know but it worked.
---
"Dreafully boring"... to *you*.
---
Yet here we are with a thread full of people who love fishing in video games.
---
So "why add it?"... because a lot of players would love it. 
---
[Detailed breakdown](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ad7fxu/enclavescout_armor_all_you_need_to_know_about_it/)
---
It's a long read, but it'll save you some undue stress. Or at least let you know all that you're in for.
---
I get it.  I don't know if this correlates, but there was a certain game I would always play while messed up, and playing it sober just really triggers me to get into it.  I almost think I will quit the game because of it.  I would suggest you do the same.  If a game is making you mad or irritated, it isn't worth your time anymore.
---
In today's episode we're going spend half an hour hiking back to camp because we can't fast travel with all this loot. It's going to be so exciting! 
---
(Bonus feature: Fifteen minutes of inventory management as we try to stuff two more legendary guns into our stash.)
---
My first thought was guess I‚Äôll get reported every time I don‚Äôt trade my tse shotgun 
---
I adventure. Like... I literally pack some ‚Äúsnacks‚Äù and beverages, few meds, equip perks to roam for long periods of time and just explore. The little spots that are not marked on the map are fun to find. If I‚Äôve been playing a couple hours and find a new place I sit down (if there‚Äôs a chair) and then IRL I have a smoke or a vape, sip some coffee and just take it in. 
---
If I come across other players I may watch them for a bit or just go to their camp and wave hello, maybe drop them some free drugs and stims.
---
As I find new places I take a pic with my phone and add some text ie. ‚Äúlead deposit‚Äù. If the place is interesting enough then I take an in-game photo that I will see during load screens.
---
Cool thing is animals are encountered so I collect their meat to make recipes because those offer great SPECIAL boosts. Im not thrilled with killing cats but that AGL 2 bonus is great.
---
Random spawns make this fun too because when I come across an area I have been to multiple times the random spawns keep it a little fresh.
---
There‚Äôs too much to be had in this game, doing quests from point A to B is really the ‚Äúfiller‚Äù in my opinion. The exploration is tremendous and in the nearly 600 hours I have played I haven‚Äôt seen too much because it takes a lot of time to traverse every inch of the map.
---
Already did (allegedly it was to come with this new update)...
---
love spoilers, lol
---
theres canes in game for a reason! 
---
What you probably want is flat damage reduction % provided by legendary armor effects. There are several primary effects l ike assassins (reduced damage from players), hunters (reduced damage from animals) that can be stacked (5 pieces of assassins armor provide -40% damage from players) and also work with secondary armor effects like sentinel (-15% damage when not moving\[note:shooting is not moving\]).
---
There are also some perk cards with similar effects (blocker, fireproof, lone wanderer) that also add up to your damage mitigation.
---
These effects in combination are far supperior to damage/energy resistance.
---
I want locking perks. Screw this current "wait while I completely change my build" stuff. Make a choice, live with it until you're able to respect at some point.
---
Oh come on I was so excited to play fallout 76 for the first time why Bethesda why üò≠
---
Sounds like it's ideal for farming the golf club. 
---
I think someone will probably cheat to get there or go into the files or something.
---
I buy bulk ammo. Shot gun and 556. 10k for 3k caps turboteabagger
---
I figured but the not appearing in the map while running? 
---
I believe it will be balanced out when more traditional content comes around, like Wastelanders.
---
People tend to overlook how even though 76 can be superficially silly, the actual plot is pretty dark, whether it's the Hornwrights, President Eckhart, the Mistress of Mystery, etc.  It's a much more cynical game than Fallout 4.
---
I agree.  They literally have a perk that increases damage to camp structures.  Thinks seem to be how they intended.  
---
Well first I got the platinum and now I just try to do challenges
---
Holy crap, good point, explains why I'm not one shotting through Watoga now.  
---
Me thick.
---
As of right now, 142 people are not a lot of people. If you took a pole and asked add fishing or add a new undisclosed crafting system, what do you think the popular choice would be?
---
I only killed one since the patch, so I cannot lend any kind of repeatable evidence.  Just one time, one death.  Maybe I can try that later.
---
Oh my god that paint is gorgeous. 
---
Looks great on X-01! Can you apply it to any other power armor?
---
im not sure about this but i also think the further away you place your camp from its original spot the more caps it is
---
I like to explore everywhere and try to collect as many plans as possible. I enjoy player vending and working on the challenges.
---
Start hitting then with rads.  They'll move ;)
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps
---
Funny... If you look at the article theres a picture that actually has dates of when the updates for wild appalachia are released! 
---
Stop sexualizing them, you should seek help!
---
Just one correction: The Charleston traveling vendor shares his caps stash with the responders.
---
Might as well as " can we please not grief other players?"
---
You're preaching to the choir... those of us who don't abuse the systems as presented to us are in 100% agreement, and never would.
---
Those who WOULD? Will, despite any appeals to the contrary.
---
The vending machines are suppose to release the 19th and I‚Äôm pretty sure the legendary vendor was suppose to release at a later date
---
It's not like one report and they ban you. It will flag your file for review by a human. If people report you consistently and you're not a cheater or hacker you're going to be fine. 
---
Your metric is flawed. A game's popularity on Twitch or how much it's talked about on /v/ isn't always a good indicator of a game's popularity.
---
As an example, as of this post, on Twitch Skyrim SE has 523 viewers vs 3.9k viewers. Steam last 24 hr peak for both games are 12.1k and 11.2k respectively. 11.6k vs 9.2k average players over the last 30 days. 
---
By your metrics, Skyrim SE is a dead game, even though the steam stats shows it to be the more played game.
---
There are a ton of reasons that could explain it that doesn't require much thinking. Maybe there's a massive stigma towards Fallout 76 that deters people from streaming it more or viewers from watching it. Maybe it's less interesting to watch than it is to play.
---
Rigging up a working fridge isnt as simple as youd think.  Its not as simple as just plugging in a fusion generator.
---
Best armour so far,  thanks!
---
I had high hopes for the radium rifle but it doesn't deal much rads
---
Not sure! I dont have any power armor sets and had to borrow one for the video! I think its only for X01 sadly because it was explicitly titled that way in the recipe name.
---
M does stand for Massive, it does not mandate all players exist on one server instance. Not everything is EVE Online. 
---
And yes the Raids will be raids, everyone is referencing them as such. Higher level, tougher enemies, team up required.
---
The question is if they did them in such a way as to require varied builds tank/support/dpm etc... or is it a brute force thing.
---
well now that we found the combination now we need to learn why 748250.
---
A video game is much more immersive than a tv show. The same guy for example has no problems sitting at a bbq in the summer and watch everyone drinking beer and wine and liquor. 
---
Your're right, everyone is different. Thats was one reason why I aksed here for some personal views.
---
Thanks for the good wishes. Time to get in contact with one guy I haven't talked to in some time, I guess.
---
This is exactly how people found themselves accidentally inside some of the other vaults. They all described fast traveling to an event but were loaded into the vault instead.
---
You didn‚Äôt read it right....
---
I got Hoppy Hunter IPA and on my alt i was given the Tequila Tick blood
---
Exactly! who wants to watch that? I don't and I'm the one playing. I especially don't want to watch others play something I could just be doing and most likely will be doing when I get home. I'll watch them play a game like Apex or Overwatch because I am horseshit at those games so it is nice to watch others be good at them.
---
You Scorched get off my lawn!!!
---
Alright was just wondering! I love x-01 armor so I'm definitely getting this 
---
till the server crashes  :-)
---
I had been making complex camps. I stopped because of this. 
---
Now it is just an easy to place box-on-stairs build with workbenches and stash that I can drop when and where I need it.
---
And the trailer didn't. Not everyone reads everything Bethesda posts on Bethesda.net or social media. The trailer was slightly misleading, so this confusion is acceptable.
---
bookmarking this for when you are fighting them to unban you. 
---
That's why I laugh when people say it's a fallout MMO.  It's not, it's a fallout survival game.  And as far as survival games go, it's relatively tame in terms of griefing and PVP.  Look at Ark or Rust by comparison.  In those games, someone destroys your base it's truly devastating.
---
I'm glad thier fixing it asap. I logged out to eat last night and when I went to log back in it would say world found and then I would get a message saying disconnected from server before I could even get in happened over and over. I submitted a ticket and they said it was due to a glitch that occurred if you have anything in the fermenter.
---
No, it wasn't. It comes May 23
---
Sometimes it's hard to find a fight. I won't contest a workshop unless the owner is at least half my level (currently 166). I don't see the point in blowing up bases or harassing someone to PVP who doesn't want to. I'm actually considering creating a low level Raider so I can attack workshops owned by people under level 80 and not feel like a douche. 
---
&gt;Maybe this should have benn handled like they did Elder Scrolls Online. Everybody went into that game knowing full well that it was an MMO first and foremost with an ES theme. Nobody (or at least not very many) played it thinking it was Skyrim Online and 5 years later it seems to be doing well.
---
I will say this game feels far more like Fallout than ESO ever felt like Elder Scrolls
---
Early-ish game (just before respec) I was running shawdowed, pocketed, scout armor.
---
Awesome find! Thank you!
---
Also wondered.   That's good to know.   Thanks. 
---
I ended up there too one time. Took a drunken step off the edge onto a mega sloth. Fun stuff. 
---
Your HOA has heard your suggestions, and is happy to tell you the tech is all being worked out right now. It won't be long until all our broadcasts are Beta Max quality, MINIMUM!
---
Feels like launch again!
---
Who is everyone?  Speculators? Or folks from Bethesda.  Because I haven't seen anything from Bethesda saying they will be MMO style raids.
---
It's intermittent. I farm that area regularly. I've had periods where EVERY SINGLE LEGENDARY explodes immediately. As well as hours of no explosions at all. 
---
As well as the usual "delayed explosion" and periods where it was all mixed up with some instant, some delayed, some not at all.
---
No idea what makes it happen.
---
That's a transcendental bug...
---
If you took a poll and asked people if they wanted a pair of new boots or a tank full of gas, which would it be.
---
Or... are they separate things, and why not both?
---
You, like many, don't like fishing in games... got it. But many others do... let people enjoy shit. The addition of fishing to the game doesn't mean you have to participate.
---
I'm collecting a set of each power armor type. Planning on modding each set, even if i'm never going to use them. This takes quite a bit of resources...
---
Trying to get all plans/recipes. This requires me to join lots of events. I also want the lemonade recipes.
---
Trying to get good legendary items.
---
Planning on finishing all quests.
---
Planning on getting the Nuka Cola skins for PA.
---
My camp is always improving, i'm sadly at the cap already with no turrets and stuff like that. Anyway i enjoy redecorating, redesigning the powerlines, trying to make things more efficient.
---
When i get all of this i want a good set of legendary marine armor, i quite liked the looks of it. 
---
Anyway, i found it more satisfying to complete made-up challenges (ie. collect all types of PA) than to complete SBQ fights and things that the game tells you to.
---
By chance, since I saw you do some digging in code, has anyone figured out the weather tracker things all over apalachia?
---
if they followed you on a server hop, report them for harrassment. you can do that now.
---
Yep, happens to me a lot. Usually mid fight...
---
that was never confirmed to be a vault, nor does it really look like one anyway.
---
According to [this](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/3WheBXLAEMvTMFH70ejA9x/c38119dfaf0c67a3434df05b7d76d2c6/Fallout76_RoadMap_1920x1080_WildAppalachia-05-EN.png), May 23rd.
---
I've got mine at one star and food is spoiling extremely fast. I ran from Morgantown down to the overseers camp and all my fresh ingredients I had just picked up were half spoiled. My cans of food from doing Feed the People spoiled in 90 minutes of play time. 
---
Can somebody confirm, that the time period for this lock is actually 292 hours total?
---
Thanks. I know how it may look, but I'm actually not talking about myself in code here. I'm not a heavy drinker (as I used to be 20 years ago).
---
My location doesn't have enough room for that sadly, and I really like my cliffside spot, LOL. I just have to deal with it and only grow when I need stuff, or scavenge.
---
Right.  This game could be way worse 
---
I havent personally looked into them, but ill put it on my todo list!
---
That editing comment is gold haha. 
---
I think I‚Äôll probably just stay in reddit obscurity, but look you‚Äôre famous and know who I am lulz ;)
---
Also I‚Äôd love to find one of Jug‚Äôs camps, that‚Äôs the best PS4 random encounter, he is on a whole different level. In the future I just hope a lot of people build cool stuff to find and get trapped in, bonus points if you trick me into doing it to myself :) 
---
It sure doesnt! But it also means taking away from developer time to make things that more than 100 people want! 
---
Yeah, I can see why that'd be a problem.  That's the real reason I think they need to get on the PVP servers ASAP, to make it easier for likeminded players to find each other and happily throw down, rather than *just* to make life easier for the 'care bears'.  
---
Yup.
---
https://youtu.be/5YqoKkqZyrk
---
cool now can you get me a 2SE handmade please? oh and about 5000 ultracite ammo should keep me going for a bit, thanks
---
you should keep something in there and see if it travels with you. if it does, congrats, you just got the backpack DLC early lol
---
I have zero turrets and still get attacked. I took em out because I heard that would stop the attacks. They're SLIGHTLY less, but they're still there.
---
Are gamma guns affected by pistol perks?? Worth looking into as well. 
---
Heh - just insta blew them with a power fist.  More than 1 too.
---
Exactly. Don't make a human review a harassment claim based on the fact you got killed. If you read what I wrote, it's for the benefit of the people who review, not pvp characters. I know no ones getting banned from pvp.
---
Or you know, buffs to other weapons and armor. 
---
No, you're right. The official presence on here and regular communication in this sub, past announcement made in this sub as well are poor indicators of this being one of the numerous official communication channels, right?
---
I did it says we get it in the Spring 2019 Wild Appalachia so I apparently did read it right so yeah thanks for showing my friends and I already read 
---
This is one of the reasons why I gravitated into one-handed and unarmed instead of two-handed.  The thing about Super Sledges is that while they do a ton of damage, you're putting all your eggs into a single basket.  There's a reason why that weapon is classified as "Slow."  If that swing gets blocked, you'll be stuck doing nothing for a second or two.
---
On the other hand, stabby knives?  Block all you want.  I've got more where that came from.  In fact, if you have a Vampire knife, please, feel free to block away... you only make me stronger.
---
I find I use my Vampire's Combat Knife the most with Super Mutants for that reason.  I'm not dropping them in one hit or anything, but I'm basically leaving a battle with the same amount of HP I had when I came in, turning their bullet sponginess against them.
---
Hopefully this is in relation to the character loss bugs people where reporting yesterday. 
---
your welcome ;)
---
I found unnecessary rads. Great drop rate! About 100%
---
See also: Jeff Kaplan's appeal to the Overwatch community about toxicity, only to implement a report feature later. Community still toxic. 
---
It's a nice foil for the bloodied guys.  Could use a nice gamma gun too.  
---
its random to me. and the explosion radius seems insane now. im shooting them at range with shotgun and it still kills me. sometimes they explode somtimes not.
---
Fair enough. Although I think reason will prevail. 
---
Lol no that's a glitch at the other end of the spectrum. Some quests won't start while others will restart everytime you log on. Same as the wendigo/clown issue I think.
---
I agree and many of those Care Bears will eventually come to Survival when they get bored. It stops a lot of griefing and adds some high level content.
---
Glad to see stability as an issue listed. Since the last patch I have had 2 freezes and a disconnect on PC. Before the patch I hadn't had an issue for good 30+ hours of game play.
---
IMO. Absolutely.
---
I paid less than that for my copy (bought code from a friend who bought the bundle), and right now, I'm at $0.30 per hour played, and dropping fast. To me, that's fantastic value for price paid.
---
I've barely even scratched the surface of the game. I'm having a ton of fun. What more can you ask for in a game?
---
Just play fallout 4 if you want a single player game.. tons of mods
---
This, this is it 100%. 
---
It's actually legit to ask why you wanted to know what other people thought, if you're reply is going to be dismiss anything with, I like my idea better. And like I said, others have suggested this long time ago. So, hardly your idea, it's lots of peoples ideas. 
---
Being connected to the pipboy, allows people that don't have a camp, or a radio set up, to still be able to access whatever it is people are using to announce. 
---
So I think the person overreacting is you. I think you didn't like having it pointed out that your idea isn't new or yours. 
---
Perks related to brewing and fermenting would be nice too.  I don't think super duper working with brewing, I've tried :/
---
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING WHEN SERVERS COME BACK ONLINE.
---
Is it only for X01 though?
---
Except the point of what I said was wanting to interact with others, without being harassed.
---
It was a typo, it's actually Samsquanches led by Steve French.
---
IMMEDIATELY now. Not after a couple seconds. Not after they've dropped to the ground. The instant the killing blow lands.
---
There are still ways to exploit attempting to deter people from using this new functionality will not help, I'm sure folks who abuse the new report system will generate a special flag of their own.
---
I'm just going to say it's not fallout 4, do not collect everything, just what you need.
---
I think if someone is going to hit a camp, they're going to hit a camp. Best defence is to hide it. Had zero trouble out of my new spot. Been there a while too. Only visitors i get are friends/teammates.
---
It's a bug.
---
Dont know about that sheepmonster but when I went cleaning whitesprings golf club there was only million of eyebots instead of ghouls.
---
of course they are all mutated, called giga something... the game is now inventing new ways to bug out
---
Its almost like its a lawlees world aftet a nuclear war not animal crossing. 
---
that would make the entire mode totally pointless
---
since as people have pointed out you can already run around and treat the game as deathmatch
---
Love that game. Refuse to play competitive. Quickplay only, thankyou very much.
---
The door in probably isnt added yet. See the nukashine door or the new unnumbered vault door that was just added.
---
nuka cola plant! left side of the map along the river. Knew i was forgetting to show something in the video.
---
When I first started playing (December) I got a daily quest to collect the holotapes from random weather trackers around the Forest area.
---
I haven't gotten it since, cause I don't remember what area it was that triggered the daily.  But I was pretty sure all those sample devices that say "Busy collecting" when you try to extract the holo tape are just for that daily.
---
emergency patch today. lets hope this is included.
---
Play animal crossing then
---
Just going back to 76 after some hiatus and was going to get some time in on my day off. Any idea when things will be up and running again?
---
Looks like it is only for X01 due to the recipe saying X01 in the name. Not 100% sure though, I dont have the other armors to check for myself.
---
These events are how people got into the vaults early too, myself included. They seem to pick any spot without a care if its actually been released yet or not.
---
Wait was one of those notes from someone who took ingredients from the plant? If so I might be stumbling upon it myself.
---
\#metoo
---
Not really, Slap damage does a lot of damage if the guy is a bloodied overpowered build, i got it on a video last night and send to @Bethesda
---
* A fair amount of it has been leveling in order to change my build as I found out a few areas of improper planning. Getting perks like adrenaline, nerd rage, etc. Basically once I decided to stick with melee I had all these extra points I could move around that come in handy.
---
* Then I've been farming legendaries, initially to get better weapons for my main character, but also now that the legendary vendor is a month out - to stock up for that.
---
* I also have found some great legendary drops that would be really good for other types of builds, so I'm leveling a new character for to make use of that. Plus it's always nice to have variety for max level play styles.
---
* Finally, I'm exploring, gathering collectibles, etc. Just usual Fallout stuff. Plenty of areas I haven't been yet and scenes/stories I haven't found yet. Only yesterday did I finally get the Nuka-Cola T-51 paint. So now I might go collect a suit of that so I can paint it.
---
No the stupid neon letters also don‚Äôt place properly either 10k for a plan that doesn‚Äôt always work üòÇ 
---
Plane crash note is on a chair in the plane. Hard to see lol.
---
I've never gotten that daily, perhaps I wasnt in the right places at the right times. I thought dailies auto triggered entering areas though. So strange I havnt ran into one. 
---
I had my sound completely cut out back on Wednesday.
---
I agree that stability has been poor lately, but they are taking the servers down this morning to apply a hotfix that involves stability fixes, so we'll see.  Hopefully it's something straightforward.
---
Gotcha. I have a set of T51b, so when I get the paint later I'll see if I can put it on anything else and report back here!
---
This is the paint I‚Äôve been waiting for! I loved the one from fallout 4
---
I‚Äôll have to check if I still have it, send me a message when you‚Äôre on and I‚Äôll let you know! GT Xwolfpackleader 
---
When I saw the leaderboard, I thought about that.  Since you can bounce in with existing characters, I'm willing to bet majority of survival players will bounce in and out.  Some may stay permanently.
---
Dense torso and Fireproof negates pretty much all the explosion damage ;)
---
Out of curiosity, how did you feel about kids before you had yours? I don't mean this to be disrespectful to anyone that has kids, but for me, if I had to make a list of the top 10 worst things that could happen to me, somewhere in that top 10 list would be 'having children'. And it's not that I necessarily dislike kids (I have a few nieces and nephews that are OK, and the older they get, the more I can relate to them), I just don't want the responsibility / burden. The stress of worrying about a child 24/7 just seems awful. And if something ever happened and it was even remotely my fault... I don't know if I could live with myself, and I certainly couldn't face the rest of my family. On top of that, I love my life right now. I don't ever want to give up my weekends and "stay-cations". When Fallout 4 came out I took 2 weeks of vacation time that I had saved up and just played for 10-12 hours per day for 14 days straight. It was ... amazing. I never wanted it to end. Some people dream of travel, but I just wanted to visit the Commonwealth in FO4 lol. I feel that I would resent children if I had them, for taking my free time away. Maybe that's something that you don't care about when you have them, but I just can't see myself changing that way. I think I'm too selfish to be a good parent, and faking selflessness just seems exhausting. I'm not painting myself in a good light here, but I've always thought it was better to admit how I am and not try to fake it and wind up miserable.
---
Sorry, long off topic thing here as well lol, just curious if you were similar, or if you thought you wouldn't mind kids someday, or how you felt before / after.
---
Wow not that's being mobile. I want to do that for Survival mode and make it easier for myself. I like your concept.
---
Dude I call the little paper bags people leave "player droppings"
---
My man! I have the regular Nuka Cola one and I love it, but this is the bee's knees. I want to try to figure it out myself based on the notes before I spoil it, but I 'preciate you.
---
So no you're fine.
---
After the last season I had.... You might be onto something. 
---
I just fisted three this morning, and none of them insta-blew for me. Killing one with a spear was instant death though. 
---
I'd really like to know what the triggers are. I had a convoluted "stuck in power armor" bug once that turned out to be caused by wearing a specific hat, so it could be anything.
---
i don't even play the game because of always on PvP
---
I JUST got the nuka cola paint job yesterday. Decided I'm going to collect several sets of each suit of armor. I'm hoping some day we can actually have permanent suit displays, so I can put together a little power armor museum kinda thing.
---
I was hoping to find a broken acoustic guitar on the stairwell.
---
I think thats related to the orgininal Nuka cola power armor paint(the red one).
---
AWOL armaments Gutsie insta-sploded, and I killed him with a rifle.  
---
I spent three hours in the Nuka Cola plant looking for that goddamn note and didnt check the roof access because my lockpick is level 2. Rip.
---
PS4 and it feels like we've gone back in time. Stability had really improved then yesterday I had servers due on me a good few times. 
---
HA! YES! My friend keeps saying, "I pooped a bag..."!!!
---
just to be safe you should give me half of that ultracite ammo...
---
Good luck to ya! The key cards are a bit hard to spot!
---
To my knowledge just the ballistic part is adjusted by perks wich is kind of useless. I was wondering about legendary effects really. 
---
I am starting a new guy currently and I think the game doesn't get fun until about level 50 imo. You can be doing quests that you have and run into a random pile of level 62 ghouls or super mutants that will fuck your day up and it is discouraging. I find that if you run into that problem the best solution is to log out and log back in and hope that the server you joined has lower level spawns. When you get to level 50 you at least have all your special points, and can make a build that can at least contest with the high level mobs. unfortunately until then, you will just be putting a clip or two into an enemy for it to die.
---
You'll never see it at the usual farming locations, or fast traveling. Go out and walk places. 
---
To be fair, i Can see you point of view, from a PVP side of things, where the assassin sentinel is really good. But for PVE, to quite frank - the amount of either time or money and energy you need to invest in order to get a full sentinel set, is simply not that good compared to PA builds. You can stay alive way more consistently in PA and they‚Äôre easy as HELL to get a hold of. I have a full set of unyielding/sentinel heavy combat BOS armor, and let me tell you, I die way more from unforeseen sources of damage than I ever do in my power armor. There‚Äôre certain perks and benefits that come with the unyielding sentinel set, which there should be, cause hell it wasn‚Äôt easy getting it.. meanwhile I got the best PA available the moment I hit 50. And PA makes the game so much easier when it comes to combat
---
I was soo wanting to buy this :(
---
Upvoted for impressive smart-assery
---
I have brick walls so this makes me sad
---
You *can* jump from inside if you sprint jump from the railing of the broken platform. I dont have rank 3 lock picking either.
---
At this point I've got a large camp I've spent a lot of time arranging so if something were to happen to it I'd drop server as quick as I could. I won't try to compete with the people who go looking for PvP by antagonizing others, I'll just bounce and play something else for a while. Save myself a lot of aggravation.
---
This has happened before I don‚Äôt know what the fuss is about. Is it 100 percent chance?
---
On PC?
---
I no longer have the old .esm files to double check but this should not have been possible.
---
You need the relevant 'ma' keyword to be present in the ARMO record if you have specified one in the OMOD record, otherwise it will not even show up, let alone attach.
---
And in this case you have to specify one or more in the OMOD or it will show up as an option for any armor with the relevant attach point which is... Well, all of them.
---
Peculiar...
---
Will definitely check when I get home what is going on with this.
---
I am as well, I'll be on after maintenance today.  My IGN is same as here.
---
I didnt even know you could milk animals at all wtf
---
Xbox1
---
I rock the brick+metal too, its a good look but it feel like all walls have the same condition amount.
---
They do need to fix the wall clip with PA and crafting stations, would keep people out of places they arent suppsed to be in.
---
It's a fun challenge.  Find somewhere that people wont think to look
---
Good to know! Thank you!
---
I've only triggered it once.  I believe it tells you to go collect holotapes from a handful of those environmental data units.  Randomly selected.  And you cannot use them unless you are on the quest.
---
I hope this is one thing thier fixing 
---
I logged out to eat last night and when I went to log back in it would say world found and then I would get a message saying disconnected from server before I could even get in happened over and over. I submitted a ticket and they said it was due to a glitch that occurred if you have anything in the fermenter.
---
Maybe if they fix the blueprint placement problem having large bases wont be such a gamble 
---
tried it on the SBQ, didn't end well  :(
---
Interested, but out if town until next next Monday.  Will check with you when J get home and see if you still have it.  Price is ok.
---
I'm not saying you can permanently downgrade cards, I'm just saying why do I need 6 of the same card to get First Aid Rank 1, First Aid Rank 2 and First Aid rank 3, and why do they all take up different slots in the Perk screen? 
---
I understand this isn't for everyone but before FO76 you could Max SPECIAL stats and pick the perks you wanted and IIRC you didn't need special perks to hack/lockpick or make your own Armor/Weapons did you? It's been a while since I played FO:NV or FO4. 
---
The Card Packs are part of the issue where 3 packs so far have given me the same card which I already have maxed. If the game already detects if you have a Perk already if there is no upgrade for the card (Like Professional Drinker) where you can't buy/get it from a pack after you've got it once. 
---
Come to think of it, we could use a Children of Atom-type enemy in this game.  The type of enemy that specializes in dealing a lot of radiation damage.
---
I mean, Glowing Ones can do it, but the CoA in Fallout 4 were a force to be reckoned with.
---
If memory serves Tygart Water Treatment south of Horizons Rest is the trigger location for that daily, but I've not been there in a while.
---
Sorry it's already spoken for - it's all going to the Scorchbeast Queen, at very high speeds =)
---
Happened to me as well but fixed itself in a couple of hours.
---
im sure they already regret it. 
---
Wut. This blows my mind. Outside of data mining, how long would this have gone unsolved/undiscovered I wonder?
---
The VTU jacket and jeans?
---
Where did you get that information about pacifist mode?
---
Whitesprings respawns.
---
I saw someone comment they spammed interact with BIV to get something to pop.  That also worked for me.  Although it popped up as a Repeatable and not a Daily or Event. So they obviously added some new type of classification. My money is that messed  everything up.
---
This is really peculiar.
---
If you ever have a chance could you please test is you can attach linings to the upper limbs of the robot armor?
---
You know, brawler, stabilised etc...
---
I travelled accross to map tfor what was labeled a sheepsquash horde only to find it was just ghouls
---
Lmao bullshit. 
---
Source: Am bloodied build with always over 1k damage and i do Jack shit
---
I hope I get that lucky I have been trying since last night with no luck.
---
Depends on if it's separate cell or not. But they could nuke attached cells, however I don't know why they haven't yet would have made nuking sites like whitesprings annoying for people in whitesprings. Could just say that location is lead-lined.
---
But could be fun and make you run from the location you are squatting in.
---
I absolutely guarantee this will be the case, except for maybe some specific, particularly nasty activities.
---
This studio is small, and already have their hands more than full with what they've got going on.  Unless they plan to outsource report monitoring (and I see no reason to think that will happen), they won't have time to review every single report that comes in.  
---
Hell, I'd be surprised if any action is taken on anything but the most prolific cheaters and griefers (again, barring particularly egregious activities).
---
I jumped in the watoga civic center and found myself walking around above the place. Marsupial + jump over debris in a corridor. Never even considered pics. I walked around trying to figure out how to get back down.
---
People are much softer in the post apocalyptic wasteland than I thought they would be.
---
Ok sounds good 
---
But even if it WILL be a no-build zone, why does it allow me to place my C.A.M.P. in the same location?
---
I will say, though, that when I "moved"my camp (to the same area), it seemed a lot more strict on where I could drop the device--but it still let me drop it. I feel like if it's a no-build zone I shouldn't be able to place it at all.
---
My Tambo and the Watoga bot made a boom boom!
---
i havent experienced that problem either, although i am having to refill my water bar about 3 times as often as my food bar.  dont recall if thats normal.  I am never over encumbered and i dont use speed demon
---
earlier this morning people had found the second key card legit and had tied it to the id reader in the basement.
---
Another group had found the crashed plane info.
---
So i suppose not too much longer once it all got tied together.
---
lol. You know what I mean though. I'm not worried of anyone getting banned. I'm worried they won't take areal harassment seriously after a flood of wolf cries.
---
No mods is the issue but somehow it affects me anyway. Something to do with my files being read only
---
I dropped one yesterday no problem (first one I dropped since patch) but after I dropped it then it told me wait a week 
---
We shouldn't be discouraging the use of the reporting feature, we should be encouraging it.
---
It's on BGS to sort out the actual reportable issues from ones that aren't. What you personally think is or isn't griefing is irrelevant. If a sizable percentage report it as such, it's important feedback to BGS, perhaps on the perception of what griefing is or just their audiences tolerance for such activity.
---
Don't be on the side of arseholes. Just because the game allows for it, doesn't mean that you should. It's why we see so many posts praising how awesome and generous the 76 community is and fewer posts (if any) praising how awesome the experience was when someone used the "bug/exploit" of contesting a workshop to get around slap when you were nowhere near the workshop.
---
I'd love to see some COA stuff added.  Enemies and a new faction quest line would be pretty sweet. 
---
I only have polished unlocked for robot limbs, I found an unyeilding cav arm and have been scrapping like crazy trying to get more with no luck. 
---
What are the stats of high voltage hefe and the ingredients?
---
 That challenge came out yesterday , players have been using this trick to see people‚Äôs inventories since the game came out.
---
What are you talking about the silo yeeted the missle 
---
Can someone cut/paste the details here? I can't see Bethesda's site at work.
---
This ship might have already sailed for you, but my suggestion is to not ruin your own experience. Don't look up how to do a quest, where a good camp spot is, "the best way to___". This game isn't about racing to the end. Its about enjoying the route to the end. I wanted to move my camp off a lead deposit near to of the world that i had  become quite fond of,  but was onlu willing to move to a junk pile near water that was still somewhat centrally located.  Took me three days but when i found it i was thrilled. Different character i wanted to find some quick steel for early game crafting, looked up resource deposit locations and in 15 minutes had my spot. No satisfaction. Youtube ruins alot of people's experience
---
It would be sweet to repeat any side quests. I really wanted to get that flaming smg at a lvl 45... üò≠
---
I like this analogy XD 
---
Did you OHK them?  Mine was from sneak, insta kaboom on 2!
---
They have them in the enclave bunkers now. 
---
I thought nukes where disabled ?
---
Though I do not believe that everybody was "cheating scum" I would like to say happy cake day to you!
---
They are two chatbots that are responding to each other.  Think of the old Eliza program.
---
Whats that Lassie? Timmys in the well?
---
So, the obvious thing you're probably missing? ***It's not fun to watch, and has no big names to push it.*** Twitch is not a community, it's a herd. Viewers are funneled into popular channels and games by design, and 76 is neither of those things, and never will be (unless their planned PvP mode is far more epic than anyone expects). Note that I am not begrudging the idea. I have no objection to a million people watching PUBG or Fortnite. But I in no way expected Fallout 76 to be on Twitch at any capacity, never mind in large numbers, because it's not a game built for viewing.
---
Further, with the absolute trashing it got on release, who the hell would stream the game now that the furor has calmed? Don't forget that Twitch is a popularity contest that sometimes pays money when you're popular enough*.* The goal is to *get them clicks.* And now that the furor of "10 Reasons Bethesda will Eat your Babies!!!!" has ended, nobody's going to deviate from their current, popular content to go back to the game they shat upon for literal months.
---
Sentry Bots? They explode now immediately? 
---
A brother from another mother. You can often find me jumping and hopping from crack and crag along cliff walls like a mountain goat.
---
Having a mic is all well and good, but one thing you're forgetting (and Bethesda did as well) is that on EU servers you do run into players that don't speak any English. This game needs something to compensate for that. In the other MMO games you are able to use text chat then copypasta it into Google translator and that was good enough.
---
I made terrible perk choices and have neither of these options, lol. Really wish we could get a full respec. At least one. 
---
The lonely feeling was the point. It's one of the things this game actually does well. 
---
Why do so many want to change that?
---
It will be the new hotfix patch 
---
Same. Although recently r/Fallout has started warming up to 76 a bit, but the place is still full of assholes. They might as well rename themselves to r/NewVegasCirclejerk.
---
They announced that they were taking the servers down for a hotfix
---
Polised etc is materials. Those work fine on PC too.
---
I mean linings:
---
Aerodynamic
---
Braced
---
Brawling
---
Stabilized
---
Weighted
---
Well, it's not just you *NOW.*
---
Wow, glad to see they're reacting fast to weird bugs with hot fixes now. Kudos 
---
&gt; I just fisted three this morning, and none of them insta-blew for me
---
/r/nocontext
---
With how fast food has been decaying lately even with good with salt perk up, something at our camp to further preserve it would be nice to utilize for the new brewing system
---
I‚Äôve said this since the TSE nerf but they need to just eliminate all duped weapons and armor.  Bethesda blew it in that regard.  
---
do u actually go to Biv to get the new quest daily? i server hopped last nite and kept going up to him but nothing triggered.
---
The one I took on last night did and also got stuck in shooting missiles continually even after dying/exploding, though only in the direction it was facing.
---
Yeah, I've tried a couple more after the video and it has happened each time. 
---
Fall speed increase 100 rad resist 
---
I fucking grinded far cry 5 fishing
---
fuck last night I was THIS close to getting my first SBQ kill, but we "failed" the event with a SLIVER of health left on her and she just flew away
---
It's such an odd thing. Oh well - maybe the hotfix they are putting in now will fix/break something and it will all work again :)
---
Great suggestion, hopefully Bethesda will do something about that.  
---
Hear hear! Couldn't agree more. I nearly went insane trying to make a sign. The letters could use less budget too.
---
They moved some to a cycle and removed a few dailies people rarely did. 
---
Hehe. Doesn't help that I'm not a big fan of New Vegas either but I realise that's simply a taste thing. But they ran around with that whole "people who like this are not real Fallout fans" that I just got permanent turn off of that place
---
that's what Al-Anon is for, people with alcoholics in their lives that aren't themselves alcoholics...
---
No, I understood, I just dont have them unlocked. 
---
I 100% agree with ya! Servers are going down for maintenance in a couple mins so I've just been hanging out with him and hearing all he's got to say. Love it lol
---
Wait, how can you know that there is an update and not know why there's an update? Anywhere I've seen mention of the update and servers going offline, it's stated why they're doing it.
---
I have this problem too, with Wine. Came here for answers. I don't think the wine I drank had a condition bar, so maybe it wasn't fresh. Will go back to test.
---
Out of curiosity... why didn't the condition change on automatic energy weapons? I was excited after reading the notes (apparently not clearly enough) and tried out my automatic AA laser rifle and it broke in 3 magazines.
---
Are you building onto an existing camp that utilizes foundation exploits, or stacked stairs?
---
I know just the place you mean and it's a really nice little camp :)  
---
You actually have plans for every extractor, but they only appear in the build menu if there is an extraction node within the limits of your camp.
---
Good thing I only eat ionized meat. Mmmmmm... ionized meat.
---
Pretty sure canned food doesn't spoil. At least not the common canned foods like Pork'n'nBeans, Dog Food, etc...
---
Or melee weapons 
---
I knew those voting machines that can be interacted with would come into play in a future update!
---
Yeah, but really though, even if someone does level it... It's just a matter of moving it to a new location. Which, in itself, gives me at least a few hours more gameplay while getting it situated. 
---
I would like to add to this by saying the "Idea" of being hunted and killed by a fellow waste lander adds a bit of fun and mystery to the game. I also agree that your base being attacked was always gonna be part of the plan. Since they are already working on a passive mode that will prevent dmg to both you and your base, this point is probably moot,  But I think a cool down should have taken place if you were killed and chose not to seek revenge , and if your base was attack. Like an hour cool down where the base and you could not be harmed.  I have not minded when someone killed me .. or attacked my base, however I do care when its over and over and over again to the point I have to swap servers.  
---
I want some of those rick blood recipes! I have a lot of tick blood saved up for stimpak crafting.
---
Because it is there Twitter feed, controlled by an employee of BGS.
---
Did they create this sub? Are employees the only Mods?
---
Hey that's a cool setup!
---
Seconded, my first TSE did that too, I got into the habit of opening full trade window each time a legendary dosn't drop proper loot. So far, I think one actual legendary has dropped nothing for me, some time ago.
---
I'm always moving my base anyways so it would be a huge deal
---
you are talking to the guy that dug into the files to find this, that is what this whole post is about...  did you just comment on a reply without reading the post?
---
I'm really hoping that's what they're patching. I saw that pop up yesterday and it got me making sure I don't leave anything in the Fermenter if I log out. :o
---
So these Burrow Boys, I wonder if they will have leather jackets with a bad ass mole on the back?
---
Tunnel Snakes --&gt; Atom Cats --&gt; Burrow Boys
---
It stated it on the game but did not state why 
---
yeah, so thats the reason,seems your build is a bit weak,  My bloodied build toon do almost 3k dmg, somethimes a bit more.
---
Also i already see some other builds doing over 4k.
---
Enjoy it it‚Äôs pretty good 
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 and looking for a friend dm me only level 10 so it won‚Äôt make your game ridiculously easy
---
Gotta, say, I kind of wish people didn't put up spoilers and how to, about something they datamined to find out how. 
---
I mean, you basically ruined the work the people making the game put in for people to discover for themselves. 
---
I can only imagine why is because you found the art for the armor, and wanted to be the first to tell everyone how it's done. 
---
I mean, people crap on the game about not having enough content, and then others do this. 
---
Cheaters?
---
Better be stealth adding a custom spawn point to welcome mats
---
ESP?
---
Yes. You have to interact with him in person to start the quest.
---
https://youtu.be/FV63b6empgM
---
PvP advertised since launch...
---
How could you be so certain of my motives? I am motivated by challenging PvP engagements and gaining caps and resources via PvP.  Yeah i rob, kill and steal... But its by design and its part of the game. PvP is extremely profitable. The game doesnt even let you get 6k caps in a few hours without PvP due to vendor cap limits. 
---
It was never about the salt, for me at least.  My favorite people to PvP are other PvPers.
---
Im sorry your so heated on this subject, but frankly i disagree and believe you are wrong. I stand by that. I have never greifed anyone. These things are not greifing. Its the game, its by design, and you guys refuse to acknowledge it. 
---
It will change soon enough. Player killing, camp smashing, workshop ganking... These are not greifing. Im sorry your having such a rough time, but its not my problem. 
---
Try to understand the game you are playing a little better please. The things i do are incentivised. Its all part of fo76. 
---
OMFG a Hackers reference!!
---
I disagree my man. Because the game allows it, you absolutely should, if you want to. Like I said, I don't really care for that type of shenanigans, but it's not, and shouldn't be, a bannable offense like some people are saying. That would be ludicrous to think you could buy a game that features, and encourages pvp, and then got reported for it and banned for it. And to reiterate, it's not a bug to contest a workshop and kill someone. It might suck, it literally happened to me yesterday and I lost about 70 lbs of useful junk items, but its the way they made the game.
---
You could do that before the patch, too.
---
Milk came out a little red, tho'.
---
thank you. now i know i just got a bug lol
---
I was running the game in borderless mode pre-March patch with no issues, so my comment isn‚Äôt incorrect.
---
Would appreciate hearing from more people.
---
I've also had a ton of issues on xbox. 2x1 footprint camp can never be placed. Is always floating or "furniture entry is blocked" which I've only started seeing after the update.
---
The robots would only explode if they were on fire before death, and legendary. I haven't tested the new patch
---
Ahh...
---
You know that BGS don't own Twitter right? That the equivalent of your "Because it is there Twitter feed, controlled by an employee of BGS." applies to the BethesdaGamesStudio account, as well as I think like 5-6 CMs that are all BGS employees.
---
Yeah, I did a stealth single hit with a power fist. He dropped, I looted, and then I backed out of blast radius.
---
Water bar always seemed to deplete faster for me, too, that may be normal.
---
Why should that be a but? Should other players miki nukes also be muted? 
---
I appreciate the change.
---
I just found this post by searching for Sheepsquatch.. I just missed one too apparently! GRR! I looked on my map and saw an event near Morgantown, very close to me, that said something about Sheepsquatch.. I had just enough time to get super excited, before it vanished off the map! I ran over there anyway, but of course found nothing. And now I'm getting a Shutdown Imminent message.. didn't know they were doing something else today.. oh well, it's apparently not my day! Haha..
---
Could you take a screenshot of (to the best of your abilities) the exact spot you exited? Want to know so I have some vague idea of how likely my main's base is to end up in a new no build zone.
---
Did you nuke Morgantown by chance? On PC?
---
Well I'm hoping they will fix more than that. I can't do any daily only a few events. So no point in playing the game really.
---
Dayum .. This simple but important fact had escaped my thoughts this whole time. very good point.
---
Lol he fisted three and got insta-blown
---
Thanks! I might move to PC from PS4. Are there any hackers?
---
Store your junk often in your stash box. Don't be afraid to die. Die a lot don't waste time on stimpacks. I spent too much time worrying about dying, then i realized there really is no repercussion to dying except losing your junk and junk is easy to get.
---
So it‚Äôs definitely an issue since the patch. I‚Äôve been disconnected again and it glitched out while I was in the middle of an event. I was chatting to someone in game who has been experiencing the same thing and he got chucked from the server twice in the time we were conversing ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è we‚Äôre now down for maintenance so let‚Äôs see what happens 
---
On PlayStation updated download without any idea what the notes are.
---
It was in a Beths reply to a post monday or tuesday maybe, ill see if I can find it again.
---
One advantage ive noticed no one has pointed out is when you need to run somewhere you may not have discovered yet. Theres a mod that you can put on the legs which lets you reduce sprinting AP cost (and a mod that lets you sprint faster at higher AP cost though I suspect its less efficient in long distance travel). Put this on with the marathon and squad perks and youll be going really far very fast. You can also run speed demon with that combo but I would wait until next update as speed demon currently drains your hunger and thirst at an absurd rate
---
That's a really nice build!
---
Looks like they slightly changed the way the coloring looks? I don't remember the purple edges on the Fallout 4 one.
---
I on Xbox I just got the game 
---
Try /r/fo76bazaar or /r/fo76marketplace, but get more results there. Don't forget to mention your platform as well.
---
where is the first note located if we were following the clues?
---
I read it. I meant how someone can probably somehow get really deeeeeepppp into the files or cheat to somehow get there. Idk or maybe it‚Äôs not even in the game yet?
---
I was wave 1. I wouldn‚Äôt call mine innocent, just stupid. Nobody believes what you say anyway. Never duped or used an exploit but did pick up a big bag of booty a guy dropped and logged out. 
---
I figured I‚Äôd be fine after they deleted stacks but no luck yet. All it does is keep me paying for another account. 
---
"Good. Bad. I'm the guy with the gun."
---
Moderately Multiplayer Online game?  Hells I dunno...
---
Log in took over munition factory pays 100 caps , countdown for server shut down starts fml
---
I didn't know you knew exactly how BGS operates.  I am impressed that you are on here Todd.
---
I highly doubt that. I can reach 4k aswell with adrenaline perk active and stuff. Was just pointing out that without any chems and adrenaline stuff i always do over 1k damage. You're just spreading lies rn if you try to tell me you always do 3k damage at any point or that slap damage is too much. 
---
Agreed 100%,  with at said, I'm wondering if the items we're able to display in our camp in the future patch will count toward our camp budget?  Has it been said?   
---
There's nothing wrong with hearing other players interact with the world, it's just very immersion breaking to hear the sounds clear as a bell in your own ears when the player is literally hundreds of feet away. 
---
Same! Although I relogged involuntarily by crashing out of the server but whatever.
---
Update - 11:00 a.m. EDT:
---
Maintenance has begun, and we've brought Fallout 76 offline across all platforms in order to apply a hotfix for the issues mentioned below. During this time you will be unable to log into or play Fallout 76, and we'll let you know as soon as we've brought the game back online.
---
Hi all,
---
Fallout 76 will be temporarily offline for all platforms today, starting at 11:00 a.m. EDT,¬†while we perform a hotfix to address an issue with the Fermenter, an issue with nuke silo codes, and make some stability improvements. During this time you will be unable to log in to Fallout 76. We‚Äôll keep you updated in this forum thread with any news and will let you know¬†as soon as you‚Äôre able to access the game.
---
Please also note:¬†There will be no patch notes following today's hotfix.
---
Thank you for your patience!
---
Had some fun with this in a group last night. Had someone drink it, then we all fast traveled to them blind the moment they disappeared.
---
which should have been a no brainer.. 
---
Yes absolutely. I'll do it when I log on this afternoon. As I said in an earlier comment, if you're at the church in SE of Harper's Ferry and you jump down toward the nearest spot on the road, there's an abandoned car and its literally right next to that (less than a meter away). 
---
Man, I'd never leave my base camp if they added this!
---
Scrap every weapon and armor piece you aren't using so you'll get mods
---
When leveling up, you don't have to take a perk in the SPECIAL stat you're increasing.  You can change the filter afterwards 
---
You can now milk brahmin, which gives you a nice little aid item.  
---
Yeah same issue I just figured you couldn't log out with it 
---
llol!
---
Well I certainly hope so! 
---
So can we get that now?!
---
Guys stay calm, it will be only a maintain maybe a hot fix AND a predownload for the next REAL Update!
---
there are no statements from beth that today will be a UPDATE, thats standart words for the Maintain! Cool down \^\^
---
My Brahmin isn't for killing, it's the only thing keeping me company
---
Servers were (are?) shut down temporarily as of ~15 minutes ago to fix issues with the nuke silo reset timer. 
---
Bad timing for you, but it should work better in the long run.  If you‚Äôre on PC I can launch a nuke for you when the servers are back. 
---
Yes. This happens whenever you get a loading screen or enter/exit PA. 
---
The people who were banned for accessing the dev room were accessing a room that can't be fast traveled to normally, ever. They used "cheat" programs to get there. Lots of people have ended up in vaults due to error, and they were not banned.
---
That's fair. 
---
Never underestimate the best and brightest of America unleashed in the post apocalyptic wasteland while wasted on Nukashine. 
---
Fortunately? I can‚Äôt play my melee character. I just can‚Äôt login so.....I guess that‚Äôs good?
---
Now just wait for it to freeze over.  Ice fishing!
---
I complained about this about a month ago here.   My argument was that cranberry bog/ Watoga  is a late game area and level 25 legendary enemies shouldn't even be spawning there and all enemies should be at least level 50.
---
The answer I got was "the level of players effect the level of enemies spawning, maybe a low level player was there shortly before you." 
---
If a low- level player goes to cranberry bog by himself, he should be getting shredded by level 68 enemies, they shouldn't scale to his level.

They were never ‚Äúdisabled.‚Äù  There was a bug with the silo timers that they are currently hotpatching. 
---
I do see what you are saying but if I remember correctly, terminals in the former west-tek research facility located in "The Glow" of Fallout 1 detail the development process. I agree that the lore regarding where the exact moment that development of FEV began is lacking. But we can't know what we dont know. Ya know? 
---
This is especially common in Whitesprings, but I've had this happen elsewhere as well. Even if the thing has other loot, sometimes it seems like it takes a minute or two to "generate" the legendary weapon.
---
Not to say it's ALWAYS going to pop in later, but yeah, sometimes a little patience goes a long way.
---
I've been on water for months!  Even have brahmin that hang out nearby!  Feels like the wisdom of my CAMP placement is reinforced every patch...
---
Not really.  There are griefers, sure, but they're not as common as you think.  And if one does show up, all you lose is junk and a little caps.  (You'd only lose 20 or so, I'd lose 130 something).  If you do move to PC, let me know.  I'm on every day and more than happy to play bodyguard/doctor for you!
---
Nah, Steve's just a big, stoned, horny kitty with the munchies. Sam Losco's the one that hangs out with samsquanches.
---
Cool, thanks! That would be a nice addition. Had a player try and smash my base the other day
---
I thought it was weird I had to eat like 15 soups in 45 min of playing....
---
Doesn't matter. You have the same amount of points at 50 as you do at 1000. That is the point.
---
Happened to my freind who had bought 10 from a guy for 45 caps
---
My bad, reading comprehension is not my forte these days.
---
I am just wondering if the .esm for xb is different...
---
Either way you have given me food for thought, thanks! 
---
You can only get one quest from him per day.
---
Thanks. I found the setting called 16:9 Overscan in the advanced menu in my Panasonic Viera LCD TV and it fixed it.
---
Ok, I have to take it back. This time is different. I can usually get multiple days of play out of any food I've cooked. Not anymore. Last night I spawned in at Morgantown station, picked everything in the nearby field then did Feed the People and got the 5 cans of stew. Then I went and talked to Biv and got a quest to make a beer I already had in inventory so I just gave it to him. Then I took off and ran down to the overseers camp. Maybe a half hour total. All my picked ingredients were already half spoiled. Ran down to Flatwoods and cooked everything. Ran down to Charleston and made a loop around the random encounter spawn points and the rest of my 'fresh' ingredients I hadn't cooked (coulnd't find enough wood to cook them all) were starting to spoil so I sold them off to the vendor. Ran up to Sutton Station, then ran over to Whitespring. By then, the cans of meat stew were over half spoiled. Made the rounds though the vendors in the main building and the bunker. Now my meat stew just had a small sliver left and all the food I had just cooked was at about 75% condition left. This was all in about 90 minutes of real time play. 
---
I have one-star in the Good with Salt perk and have never had food go bad this fast. And I didn't fast travel or log out a single time during all this. I've had raw flux last longer than this in the past. One day I was able to farm flux at a nuke zone at Aaronholt Homestead for an hour. Then I walked to Grafton and stabilized what I could and sold some. Still overencumbered, I walked to Sutton Station, sold some more raw flux. Then walked to Whitespring and sold the rest of it and it still had 50% condition left. That's half-way across the map on the diagonal. It was probably close to 4 hours of play time in total.
---
Something's definitely off and needs fixed. Otherwise, this just turned into a farming and cooking simulator.
---
They need to up his volume. I can hardly hear him compared to any other speaking robot in the game. 
---
I've got lead and junk on my property, really helps ease junk needs greatly.
---
Yes, that's the one.
---
i wish he was as cool as mr. rodriguez 
---
Dude!  That's almost literally what I was hoping for out of this game...Minecraft + Fallout...
---
Aster can be found along the outer edge of the big flower bed in front of the whitesprings resort.
---
That‚Äôs awesome. No changes at my camp, either.
---
They spoil 
---
Could not agree more. Every Survival game does this same shit: make food and water necessary...then provide so much of it, that the necessity is just a chore, but never represents a real risk.
---
It's just a stupid inventory management mini game now.
---
Aah snap i joined you and suddently the server maintenance countdown started! I'l try to find you as soon as servers go live if i'm around that time, and let me know if you need anything at all (ammo or anything)
---
Took me only 5 minutes to go over budget 
---
Totally agree. I've spent the last 2 days on a new camp, and having literally just completed it, I'm also extraordinarily thankful for the budget increase. Its QoL stuff like this that Bethesda doesn't get enough credit for. 
---
I'd be fine with loadouts as well. Maybe make it a changing room at camp or something.
---
Nah.  The bait will be the thing...
---
Try red dead redemption 2, fishing feels even more real. 
---
I wonder if the missing code was pertaining to legendary effects? 
---
You have the same points ar 50 as you do at 100. And with all the help you can find online you ahould not need that extra 10 levels to perfect your load out. 
---
I‚Äôm reluctant to even accept trade invites anymore and I used to enjoy it most people just wanted stims or ammo but I recently had a guy request literally every weapon I carried. I have a 80% weight reduction from my Armor so he requested a lot. 
---
LOL, a glowing version of Sam Losco would destroy the server from the smell alone.  He's the true end game.
---
an official text chat would be amazing
---
I envy your brother.  There are worse obsessions.
---
Though the quest was short I did like it.    
---
I had no problem building/placing the fermenter but didn't have the materials for the brewery. How long does it take to speed it up?
---
yeah that gives access to the locked area in the enclave bunker which also gives you presidential seals and even a presidential paint job  
---
I'm sure they have a filter for spam like this or are at least making a database with the spam they may be getting.
---
Even if it's just a bug, I think Bethesda should claim it's a deliberate ploy to gin up unsubstantiated sheepsquatch sightings before he ever shows his horns in the game.
---
Adrenal, Bloodie deathclaw, unyelding armor, iron fist lv1, it was my first toon so the build its a mess (waiting for the re-spec), No chems.
---
BTW a quick search on YT you can find a lot of great strong builds.
---
They've always spoiled fairly quickly compared to other food, but now even more so since the last patch. All mine spoiled in 90 minutes from when I got them.
---
Yeah I looked it up after because I figured there was an easier way.
---
I ended up getting it from the temple up along the border of the savage divide and the toxic valley. There's a ton around that thing.
---
Dont think so either. But normal lemonade is to my knowledge. You need them for hard lemonade.
---
&gt; "that place where i put that thing that time"
---
HACK THE PLANET!!!!
---
Good lord, yeah I don‚Äôt either I‚Äôm too worried they‚Äôre gonna get mad I won‚Äôt trade them my best/go to weapons and grief me because of it 
---
From Bethesda‚Äôs website..
---
&gt; Hi all,
---
Fallout 76 will be temporarily offline for all platforms today, starting at 11:00 a.m. EDT, while we perform a hotfix to address an issue with the Fermenter, an issue with nuke silo codes, and make some stability improvements. During this time you will be unable to log in to Fallout 76. We‚Äôll keep you updated in this forum thread with any news and will let you know as soon as you‚Äôre able to access the game.
---
Please also note: There will be no patch notes following today's hotfix.
---
I SOLVED IT!!![here‚Äôs a pic!](http://imgur.com/bZuJDZz) 
---
Ohhhhhh! Well the more you know. Only a level 30 something here so not too experienced
---
I just assumed any random location you can pop up after a nukashine became nonbuildable areas.
---
I had my base over by v-9 to make it handy to repair and scrap after the scorchbeast queen fight. Haven't had the heart to rebuild from scratch
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/328556/fallout-76-maintenance-march-15-2019/2?language%5B%5D=en
---
Oh cool, well I'll figure this out without spoiling it. Thanks.
---
This would be hilarious for people with mutations. And by hilarious I mean a salt factory hahaha
---
Semi high level but happy to help out with anything after the servers are back up, GT: KnowledgeHound 
---
But disliking Nickelback is justified
---
Yeah I had the same and not only that but when it removed my camp it did store all my items and of course the items it did store was my decontamination arch, fusion generator, large water purifier and all my crafting tables. And yes I bout and placed them there all myself.
---
I solved it!! [Here](http://imgur.com/bZuJDZz)  is a pic of one of the rewards!
---
I wonder if they goofed up the time scaling? That can wreck survival mechanics. 
---
Scrap junk before storing it. There are free to use stashes at red rocket and railroad stations. No one can access you stash except you, even one you place in your camp. Strength is your best friend, so upgrade it often for increase in carry weight (you probably knew that but still). NEVER attack Whitesprings robots! They are friendly but hit one and you will feel their wrath.
---
Its a great spot, water, acid, brahmin, firecaps, iron and aluminium nodes near by, and centrally located. The only downside is that a lot of people think so, I'd guess 2 in 5 log ins I need to re-load to get my spot.
---
r/fo76guudes
---
Oh hi Todd!
---
I lived there for a while!  That little hollow with the rotting dock and boat, I had a campfire, chairs, and guitar.  My house was on the cliff above it.  I loved that spot, but once i got an excess of acid, it was time to move because my buddy camps there too, and we were constantly conflicting lmao. Now I live near WS under sa giant power pylon.  Scorchbeasts come by to level my camp once in a while when unwary players kite them past, but otherwise it's a good spot for me.
---
No resources though, sadly!
---
That I can loot a level 25 bat off the Queen says your position is bull pucky.
---
He'd be a great NPC, though. Follow the trail of rotten hotdogs, and when you find him in his burrow, he'll stitch up your wounds. Then try to shoot you. Getting his mother's ashes from the safe in his office could be  a quest item.
---
Radicool. Nerd rage level 3. Iron Fist level 3. Bloody mess. Twisted muscles / talons / adrenaline mutation. 15 BASE str (reach 31+). Have the underarmor with +3 str. Full unyielding / Sentinel set with multiple +1 str stats. Bloodied swing speed Powerfist with +1 str.
---
 I can go on as long as you want me to, but you just showed me you're talking shit.
---
Cool, will you add this to your list because I‚Äôve been swapping cards in and out for 300 hours now and am ready for something different.....
---
You'd be amazed at how quickly crowd sourced puzzle solving can function. Black Ops Zombies has some mind boggling "wtf who would even think to do that" Easter Eggs and those are usually solved within a few days. 
---
Found Todd Howard.
---
i wish they would do the paint jobs for all types of power armor. I use t-60 mainly myself and i'm a bit bummed I dont use the nuka paints yet.
---
That is just for the crazy amount of stuff they have. A patch or two ago deleted all rare gear but 1. So if they didn't have any of their wepons or gear deleted or ammo, it probably means they weren't duping and Bethesda made a mistake.
---
GT aGraciousGod
---
And yet here you are spending time to reply? You must care at least a little.
---
I'm primarily a pve player. I enjoy the community and the new friends I've made through this game.  But... if I'm not interested in pvp and two players try to get me to pvp by destroying my camp while I'm standing there, it gets frustrating, especially after I tell them I dont pvp.  They then call me some choice names and leave. I fix my camp, thinking it's the end. Nope... they come back while I'm off in the wasteland and level my camp. Then proceeded to follow me and still try to get me to pvp.
---
This is not cool. They were being dicks. If I had the option to report,  hell yes I would have.
---
Do i think this function will be abused, yes. But someone would really have to test my patience before i would use it, and these aholes did.
---
As a really casual player who has barely made it out of the forest, I clearly underestimate the free time of my fellow players. Ah, to be young again.
---
Biv will give you daily for new brew recipes
---
Nope, those OMODS are handled differently.
---
They do not require a "ma" keyword, only an attach point - well, five in FO76 - and they are discriminated only by weapon or armor categories which is why you can get absurd things like a Stalker melee weapon or a Ghoul Slayer Gamma Gun (the latter is brilliant for trolling though :P) 
---
No, there's a secret quest added, to get a paint job for the X01 armor. 
---
If your are over encumbered you cant fast travel and would be forced to drop things in this persons base to get out, so it could be used to steal items from over encumbered people
---
No they don‚Äôt.
---
Just because you prefer to play that way doesn't mean you "aren't good enough at the game". To me being good means you know enjoy the experience without pissing other people off.
---
i made this same post months ago.  we got a long wait.
---
I hope they make \* legendarys creatures drop legendary items.... had a 3 star ghoul in watoga medical just meat pile immediately from an instigating weapon so no regen..
---
off topic lost 2 \* robots to immediate explosions
---
I'm willing to bet that the daily biv quest mechanic is identical to the vendors 200 cap 20 hour replenish timer. 
---
For me, if I use my old wiring setup, the keypad legit does nada. The switch flips, but my doors remain closed. Only the switch that I keep inside that would normally be used for exiting seems to affect the doors. 
---
Nice quick delete, but I saw that asshole. 
---
I'll just sit here and hold my breath LOL any day now, I'm sure. 
---
They didn't increase the budget, they reduced the budget used by defenses and light sources.
---
Haha yeah, I use a gamma to heal ghouls in whitesprings when im feeling "hilarious"
---
It just WORKS
---
Not play this like every other fallout , use a more diablo approach to it 
---
Right? We're all frustrated that we can't play, but some developers don't fix their games until DLC. *cough* CA *cough*
---
I restrict the amount of ammo/supplies I bring when going anywhere. I try not to fast travel (makes me enjoy the views). I run absolutely 0 carryweight enhancing perks/armor mods. Running a Bloodied build with high rads and constantly having to actually preserve my ammo (currently a * bloodied plasma rifle) adds the challenge. I got bored with the BE Handmade and Lever.
---
True. Can't wait for the Horsemen of the Apocalypse skins to get dropped into the Atomic Shop. I want to ride around in style~
---
Aren‚Äôt servers down right now for a hot fix? If so I doubt anyone got your stuff :(
---
There's also a spot just slightly south of there with a junk pile.
---
Also, FYI, there are no plans for extractors. You can automatically build whatever extractors match the resource nodes that are in your camp. Same at workshops.
---
Scenario - Guy A completely destroys my base and get s 450 cap Bounty. Okay So For his fun he will now be killed and it will cost him 450 caps for doing so.  Problem is GUY a has a Friend Guy B who just kills him for the Cap bounty trades the cap bounty back to Guy A for 1 bullet. Rinse and repeat.   I don't think all these "manbaby tears" would be dominate in these post is there were some sort of real world repercussions to the Attackers. As it is now just a joke. 
---
I just watched another You tube video where they are completely destroying this guys base while the guy is in a silo dropping a nuke.  Once they destroyed everything .. the guy A says it loud and clear .."okay dude take me out and remove my bounty so no one can get me"  This is the flaw in Bethesda's System.. The system is broken .. and people have a right to file their grievances and since Bethesda has routinely responded to post here... this appears to be a valid place to cry these "man baby tears"  
---
The Topic here is about PVP , or as some would say "I'm role-playing a raider" Well I said it once and will say it again, Raiders kill so they can raid things from you .. You get nothing from me by destroying my base once or 5 times, and you get nothing from me once you have killed me the first time. You got my junk the first kill... to continue to follow me and ruin my game experience is just plain stupid. 
---
Welcome to free released content üòú
---
Yep
---
The server is down right now for maintenance...
---
i am a farmer on my main, i use soups instead of stimpacks, i have been doing this for months, every day I make tons of food/drinks for my clan of 7 people
---
so believe me, food/drinks ARE expiring at a much faster rate
---
Maybe it's limited to melee sneak attack for completion?
---
My bad. Either way, I can build way more stuff than I used to be able to and for that I‚Äôm thankful. 
---
Did they change the Nuka Cola paint that was in there  with the last patch then? 
---
I was suiting up...excited to see what you'd done. 
---
Bummer. 
---
Hey what platform is this on?
---
Thank you. People are just so fast to blame bloodied builds for anything lol
---
This is pure speculation:
---
The fermenter basically just accelerates "decay" of items in it. It could be a glitch causing that acceleration to act globally not just inside the fermenter. At least that is the impression I get of it. It does seem that items that are used as ingredients (corn, razorgrain etc) are the most prone to premature spoilage. 
---
Looking at the last hotfix they did, they will fix what they mentioned and most likely that is all. Any other fixes would be a bonus.
---
&gt;  issue with the Fermenter, an issue with nuke silo codes, and make some stability improvements.  
---
Next real update that you can only do one time. Really looking forward to that. NOT¬°!??!!!!!!!
---
You could go to recent players and join through their profile. Well at least that‚Äôs what I do on XboxOne 
---
Certain things in my CAMP give me the "A Fallout 76 update has meant that your camp could not be place" message. I carefully blueprinted each block but when the servers kicks me sometimes I get the message not knowing which bit I added did it.
---
I think the CAMP object itself being on a floor rather than the grass is the first thing. Pissing me off to the point I'm considering uninstalling.
---
Someone just found out the domme has the xo1 nuka quantum skin inside and the keys are scattered in game
---
I'm on Xbox
---
If I can play after the hot fix I‚Äôll be pumped
---
im afraid it is because the dupers which were banned are now unbanned, and back to heir old tricks

Some cards tailored to my weapon such as the Demo expert for the exploding gat gun, I like the Instigating 2 handers as they can pretty much 1 shot the vast majority of mobs. (Useless against the queen btw) .

If you are on PC, then I would strongly suggest looking into getting the Perk Load Out mod -
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124)
---
Its insanely useful, and should be baked into the game.
---
Good luck out there!
---
Very interesting! I assumed the passage was a tip of the hat from Chris Avallone to the long-time fanbase, but what you say here is possible. 
---
I agree that we dont know if West-Tek created FEV directly, only that they developed it as part of the PIVP. However, I have not seen any evidence of where it would otherwise have originated, so I've always considered it a West-Tek original. 
---
I agree that it is, hypothetically, possible that they were not the original creators. Until more evidence surfaces though, I'm forced to assume that West-tek was the only one involved. 
---
Please upvote this 1 bazillion times.

Gee, it's as if contrary to a lot of the salt you see online, they listen to players and care about providing a positive experience.

I found mine in the wall decorations section. Right next to the Mothman Poster marked with an atomic shop logo
---
Mules weren't the reason people were banned; duping shit was or having a ton of shit that was duped. Correlation is not causation.
---
The reason why most of the people banned had mules was because they had so much shit they didn't know what to do with so they made mules. I play with a group of friends and we all have mules, none of us got banned and we never duped or bought duped stuff on masse.
---
ok, I'm on PS4
---
It's still a non-direct increase either way! We're all happy C.A.M.P.ers!
---
*sigh* I hear you. There's something in your blueprints that the update doesn't like. It is tedious but you can work it out. Too many stacked items (stash boxes 20-odd high) or the CAMP object being placed on anything other than the bare ground are two things I have identified.
---
Bethesda: DON'T LET US BUILD THINGS THAT WON'T STICK AROUND!
---
I just got dirty looks from coworkers after I laughed out loud, too out loud, at this. 
---
While I can technically agree, it is not Institute teleportation technology we are using, our characters actually travel safely across large areas of land and during this time hunger and thirst kicks in, fresh goods spoil and time passes.
---
Is it fun? No. Is it realistic? Yes.
---
are you serious?  the dude went in the files, found the paint and how to get it, went in game and got it, simple as that, what the actual fuck are you talking about?
---
76 is not an MMO. It literally fails to even meet the three words that make up the term 'MMO'. 
---
It's multiplayer, it's online, but it's not by any stretch massively.
---
Please leave it in, my passive camp Brahmin always runs away from me, cuz my mutations hurt him.  This makes it so much easier. 
---
If you want low- level crap for your low-level alt, then maybe you should farm with your alt in low level areas and events.  
---
For those of us farming for our high level characters, it's infuriating and a terrible game design.
---
It didn‚Äôt give me that option I‚Äôm sure it used to but yeah not this time 
---
It‚Äôs been a couple hours since it happened 
---
Yeah I heard about the potential glitch of logging out with items in the fermenter before I started the mission sequence so I thought "I'll just make sure it's empty before quitting" but whenever I emptied the damn thing and then opened it back up,  there was another vintage NukaShine in it. Wouldn't stack with each other though,  every time id grab the new one and out it in inventory, either the dupe or the original would disappear. 
---
-help other players 
---
-find new areas to set up cool camps
---
-farm 3* for upcoming purveyor 
---
-explore areas I know for a fact I haven't checked out thoroughly. Heck, even just finding little funny things to appreciate, like to trying to find how many "OD'd" corpses are lying around Whitespring. Also, drink Nukashine and see where it teleports you.
---
My first and secon recipe were Nuka cola dark and old possum 
---
Good thinking, certainly a plausible idea.
---
I don't have the fermenter (haven't run the quests yet at all), but it was corn that I was using (corn soup), so that might fit in with what you're suggesting.  It's certainly worth a test, assuming the next patch doestn't fix the issue altogether.
---
I've got a few days off coming up, I will certainly be getting the fermenter, I'll see if I can't do a comparison.
---
Mods please remove this post for witchhunting. 
---
I feel ya. I'm a filthy casual myself :)
---
Every 20 hours you can get the quest, and Biv is...uncooperative with giving/completing the quest. I had to try 7 times to interact with Biv before it let me finish the daily yesterday. Thinking maybe it's a bug.
---
The perk systems in previous games were a LOT less forgiving. You couldnt even use a heavy gun unless you invested into strength. In FO3 you had to pick up a perk to even use power armor. You had to have a specific level of perception to unlock the ability to choose the lockpick skill. These are just few examples to show you that fo76 is easy mode. I think the current card system is very flexible. Especially having the lockpick skills separated, this way if your buddy doesn't have lockpick 3 and he stumbles across a level 3 safe, you can share that perk with him so he can use it. 
---
If you keep pacifist on and don't take workshops you're fine. You can heal and fast travel away. Server hop and block. Ignore and go your merry way.
---
I know, I hear ya .. but then server hop ?  I am in agreement with you. was just throwing that out there 
---
Thanks, I'll check again once servers are back up! Idk if it bugged out or I kept skimming past it
---
I just made that up so he‚Äôd uninstall and go away. I have no idea what the details of the glitch are hahaha.
---
Why can't you sell it to a vendor?
---
Do the new recipes do anything worthwhile?
---
Oh, thank you, I appreciate the reassurance, but I know I'm no good at PVP. I would like to be, to protect my friends from griefers, but I am just, admittedly, kind of mediocre at the game.  I had to redo my build and tag along with a bunch of triple digit leveled players for a while to become less squishy than a jellyfish, but with their help I'm much happier, survive better, and have more fun.  Yeah, I guess me not being PVP focused doesn't necessarily make me bad at it, but PVP stresses me the hell out, too.
---
My only real PVP experience was my friend minding his own business, afk at his camp, and I was on the map looking at something when I notice another player near him, and his health rapidly declining.  I fast traveled there and tried to save him, but as soon as I attacked this person, they one shotted me.  My friend comes back to see he's needing to respawn, does so, grabs his junk, and leaves the server.  I didn't immediately follow him.  Instead, I hid where his  camp had been, using my chameleon mutation, and waited.  That person was heading back this way to presumably attack him/his camp again, and I was waiting: when I saw them (low health, obv a bloody build) I one shot sniped them from stealth, no VATS, headshot.
---
I had no armor at all on, because I didn't have weightless yet, so I was very nervous and knew if they spotted me, I was dead.  They respawned and freaked out, jumping all around, and looking for me, until they spied another camp nearby and must have assumed that player had shot them, they went to bother *them* and that guy was having none of it; I watched him one punch the griefer.  Lmao.  I got revenge on the griefer for killing my friend, but it was a hate/exhilaration sorta deal.  I got the satisfaction of revenge, but was rattled/stressed the fuck out from adrenaline too, so...
---
Sure thing. PM me.
---
That one varies sometimes, I accompanied a friend while he did the quest to get his ID, so I could cover him while he was dealing with the Bots, and someone nuked the place as soon as we got there.
---
We survived the Blast inside the DMV, but the Ghouls that were spawning were many more than I remembered when I did the quest, and more than half were Bloated Glowing ones,
---
I've nuked Charleston twice myself, and on one occasion there were Glowing ones in the DMV &amp; Capital building, but on the other one there were none, and very few around Charleston in general.
---
Mine is bugged. I dont have a mothman poster and no party poster either though I did grab it in the shop. 
---
Disagree. No nerf needed. 
---
Im a top teir PvP build... I dont use any Sentinals.
---
Sentinals is easy to kill if you know how...
---
I tried four times to rebuild a camp that wouldn't get bounced at Solomon Pond before I finally gave up.  Definitely lost my fusion generator and maybe other items between server crashes and other issues.  New location isn't as good but it will work.  I did submit a bug report though - if the UI shows I can build there, let me build there and don't make me lose hours of work.
---
In my country it cost me around 4000, which is roughly 60 USD. I got it from Amazon, and I've never seen the price of the PC version go down by more than a few cents there (idk why bother even), and it's about the same price range as most AAA games in my country, possibly a bit less. To be fair I would be really happy with a price of around $50 but this is ok, because even just about 65 hours in, and having barely seen the map, I feel like the playtime to cost ratio will be very high later on, and that's a profit. That and the concept of DLC being free attracted me a lot.
---
My wife and I play Don't Starve and the food collection/spoilage is really similar but that game has a craftable fridge. So thank you for making this post because my wife taunts me with her fridge and slow spoiling food. Come on Bethesda! Help a home boy out, cuz I have a fusion generator and her house is made of grass, but she gets a fridge? Lol
---
Ah cool, not online but saw a tweet a little while ago
---
It‚Äôs only been 2 days. The sample size is kind of small right now. 
---
Yeah maybe im talking shit as i dont focus on it, so congrats for your build, now lets back to the subject that is the Slap damage and not your build.
---
Thats funny at least he deleted the post so he wont be getting notified of us here what a guy he for sure had some vinegar in him
---
Yeah I know there are ways around it, but I think they actually said at E3 that that is the reason why CAMPs are destructible, so people could imprison other players
---
Launch a nuke a kill the Scorchbeast queen = 300 caps
---
Have you ever burned a couch? Do it and you‚Äôll understand 
---

---
Laugh yeah,  he was really wound up.  Like dude, cool, I think uninstalling is best for you and all of us.
---
Also looking for new players to game with if you need junk maybe a fusion generator building or rad shower id be happy to help anyone who needs it. My GT is ApologiseMeow
---
You literally brought it up yourself. You just tried to devalidate my comment by acting as if i didn't do enough damage and i don't know how to build my character. 
---
Slap damage is capped. End of discussion.
---
Kill people. I get like 2-6k caps a day 
---
Could I get the chameleon heavy combat chest with rad res for 3k piece when the game comes back?
---
The thing about fallout is that you gotta create the end game fun for yourself. Collect every type of armor, perfect your build, explore and don‚Äôt skip over the lore
---
Sigh... Two months is so long. Lol.
---
It really is a preference thing. I really enjoy the direction they took with the game but I can def see where some can't stand it.
---
Between beta and up to a couple weeks ago I almost always found myself playing solo. I joined in with a casual group and now seem to regularly play every evening with a small subset that play about as frequently as I do. (Same background, friends don't play the game, used to always play solo, enjoy the social interaction) Sometimes the xbox chat gets so hectic we break off into smaller groups and split teams based on character builds (rad sponge is no friend to bloodied builds). Half the time I'm not even in a group but joined in on chat. Two full groups of four, all hanging out at a player's base and picking up an instrument for a group picture was a lot of fun.
---
What platform are you on? 
---
Hack the planet!!!
---
They're for scorched earth events only, not every day use. You prime up your biggest baddest gun and use it on the queen. That's how it's intended to be used. 
---
Nah, it‚Äôs just hidden amongst other posters. Scroll over from the mothman poster and it should be there. 
---
Thats why I live off a healthy diet of canned dog food and anything liquid
---
You won the lottery
---
We are rebuilding America... you're just doing it my way. ;)
---
HACK THE PLANET!!!
---
So I decided to check this place out, and found a nice ledge to build on. Right above the train station and billboard, I can even snipe the moleminers in Blackwater Mine for fun. However, as I've been building I keep getting attacked by a Scorchbeast. I'm about to give up on this location, and I've worked so hard on it!
---
Yeah I noticed that I couldnt inspect things from vendors anymore, I saw a 3 star harpoon gun in a vendor but wanted to see what the other effects were before I brought it, couldnt inspect so I decided someone must have sold it cus it was trash
---
I have neither, but this happened. And it happened with a basic launcher too the second time in the video. 
---
Fishing in Arch Age was the best.  Boat out, Chum the water, Hook a Marlin, Fight it, get it on your boat, try to make it back to port to sell before pirates (other players) raid you and steal your fish.  
---
Were the live missiles or artifacts? 
---
it was short but I decided to have some fun with it. I went back to the speakeasy in my tan suit and fedora and played piano for people doing the quests. I got quite a bit of enjoyment from people loving me adding to the background of the speakeasy. Some even joined on the other instruments and played with me for awhile. 
---
I did get a kick out of using the nukashine though, I ended up in the damn swamp with a scorchbeast sonic blasting me. I never spammed stimpaks so hard while trying to hop into power armor to save my ass.
---
How long will this last?
---
I really think Bethesda should focus on these sort of things, especially in the aspect of game loop.
---
So essentially
---
\- do a special quest to get the plans for a device.  
---
\- the pay off makes life simple in the wasteland. 
---
Like for example we should have a recipe for something that fills thirst exceptionally well. But it requires special plants that you can't grow in a normal farm.
---
\- so one quest line to get that recipe
---
Then we need a special farming system to grow these rarer plants.  Like an indoor hydroponics system.
---
\- another quest line to get that.
---
Maybe we need a fridge to store some ingredients for this recipe, like perhaps it requires brahmin meat.  
---
\- another quest line so that we can get the fridge. 
---
Now with all of these three items, we're good to make this special recipe in a somewhat easy manner.  We can go out and kill 5-6 brahmins and keep that food in useable condition for long enough.
---
And this way we are now exploring and doing multiple quests with an end goal.  
---
My speculation is based off of meat that I've had for a few IRL days being fine, but corn and razorgrain harvested post patch spoiling very quickly. I do run "good with salt" but only one point of it. 
---
On the other hand, from a tech side, it doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense. When you craft something, it *should* delete the ingredients from your inventory and give you the finished product. The corn and razorgrain stop being vegetables and become the drink.
---
Again, this is all guess work and could very easily be wrong. 
---
i Hope it can be caped as 20% or 30%
---
Maxed out my turrets, then I built a tiny moonshine shack.
---
Nope. Idiot. I solo only
---
What kind of mutations do you have? I thought they didn't hurt passive creatures
---
Thank you for investigating this! Looks great, I'll try to get it today!
---
MMMmmm, multiplayer online
---
&gt; That would be ludicrous to think you could buy a game that features, and encourages pvp, and then got reported for it and banned for it.
---
It depends on the situation. If it was one or two times, that's one thing (totally ignoring people's perceptions of it). If you're constantly doing it to ruin someone's day, no amount of "well the game allows for it" excuses such actions. Harassment and griefing aren't game mechanics and if a person feels that way, they should be encouraged to report it as such. 
---
As I said, what you feel is or isn't griefing (and I should also add what I think/feel to the same regard) is irrelevant. What matters is the nature of the reports. If one person is receiving a ton of reports, doesn't matter how much "the game allows for it", they at the very least should be a person of interest, maybe one to ban, maybe just one to give a warning to. Same too with someone spamming reports, maybe you ignore, maybe you warn/ban for abusing the reporting system. Both outcomes can be gleaned from the nature of the incoming reports.
---
&gt;And to reiterate, it's not a bug to contest a workshop and kill someone. 
---
See, if you were within proximity of the workshop, sure, no arguments here. When you're across the other side of the map, nowhere near the workshop...? 
---
Either case, it's in quotes for a reason because that may indeed be an intended feature that's never going to change, even though it just feels wrong to me and I'm sure a bunch of other people.
---
It's more of a rule of thumb, but I am also a gamer of 40+ years and have always seen people post stuff that was unknown at the time in games. All the way back to the days of BBS's. Even for Arcade games.
---
Spam the interact button at Biv. Took me 2 minutes. Maybe this will be fixed in the hotfix.
---
hate thread thinly veiled as a question. 
---
Yawn
---
Thanks for this info. I was wondering how the snaptail decayed so quick. It's kind of annoying how far resources are to scavange and the distance to get to biv after brewing the alcohol
---
Its been good having some support no one likes unistall posts 
---
Your character will still have them if you didnt leave it in the World by dropping or transferring it to an object.

There are a ton of new recipes, you just have to complete the daily quests.

Same here and mine was leveled for the first time yesterday and it was in theory my fault. I took a workshop from 3 people, killed them all a couple times and they leveled my base and server hopped. I repaired it and moved on. I'm sure it will happen again.
---
I was simply spooning a dead feral ghoul, I don‚Äôt what‚Äôs worse 
---
Some of my perk loadouts, which assume explosive weapons.  If you're not doing those, that frees up plenty of points to focus on more damage / QoL elsewhere!  Some of my perk choices are based on what cards I have so far, so not necessarily optimal.  Happy to discuss the build and how I play it. 
---
I tend to cripple legs without using vats and have a trail of mobs slowly chasing me that I can lead to other players to share XP/loot with them - or if no one is around I switch to explosive rounds or melee depending on how many shells I have.
---
My primary weapons are: 1 - vampire s-sledge, 2 - instigating sledge, 3- vampire shotgun, 4- mediocre explosive shotgun  (looking for a better explosive shotgun!)

Noticed relatively large portion of player base are from non english speaking background and they utilize google translate when they post on subreddit. 
---
I transferred to a suitcase. The intention was to rejoin the server my friend was in and his power went out.
---
I see a party girl meta in the future of my build...
---
It gets a bit empty without the humans but the game is still enjoyable 
---
Is a good plan, but you may want to consider doing the exact opposite. Specifically, do quests hard when playing solo and then use your party-time to do harder combat farther eastwards on the map. I rolled an alt for the same reason you described, but once we got going, reading terminals and listening to holotapes actually hindered the fun.
---
Having said that, I rolled a crafting alt and played solo for a long time, avoiding all quests so I didnt mess up getting a level 50 variant of quest reward equipment. Was easy to lvel up past 30 in the Forest region and completely safely. I got some early Legendaries by doing the Wolf hunting event up by Tyler Dirt Track. Faltwoods river has so many Soot Flowers and Blood Leafs that you can craft hundreds of Healing Salves. Milk the Raider Bot in Sutton railroad station and Charleston/Flatwoods Responder bots.  Run Poseidon Repair to get your generator plans. A few levels in make the Dailies quests in Camden Park a routine visit to get ticket for the Sonic the Hedgehog costume. Google the  Top Hat semi-rare encounter and run past the spots it spawns in your travels. Avoid Grafton so you dont mistakenly get low level equipment as quest rewards - I was running through Grafton and the Protest popped and someone finished it while I was close enough, I didnt want anything done!
---
And good luck - the forest is an awesome place once you know it well.
---
I have noticed things spoiling very quickly, and every time I fast travel, I'm Hungry &amp; Thirsty when I re-spawn, even though I had just topped off.
---
Every patch seems to introduce a few new bugs, hopefully they are working on a Hot fix already.
---
It would be nice if Bethesda would communicate more to let us at least know that they're aware of the problems.
---
For a different perspective, I'm glad people do this. I hate going and clearing locations multiple times unless I'm farming junk or legendaries in that location. And if they are adding new items to existing locations, it kind of necessitates doing that. The title of the post was descriptive enough that if someone wants to find this on their own, they can choose not to read the post. To each their own.
---
You can have five characters max.
---
How you gonna like it when all  your five characters and all of your friends  are level 50 and above and you are still finding level 20 ghoul slaying batons at Horde events in the Cranberry bog?
---
The "give it to my alt and/ or my friends" argument  runs out of steam at some point.
---
And you aren't even sure who's pubes they are...
---
If the underground is expansive enough, I hope we can build camps there. All the bunkers, basements, tunnels, and caves have made me really want an underground hq of my own.
---
That is not much of a challenge. Workstations are almost everywhere, stash in each train station.
---
Hahaha, only lvl 39 but I move camp a _LOT_ :D
---
But while this is a fallout game, it's a online one and not single player. 
---
It's like comparing Skyrim and Elder Scrolls Online, both need different systems as one is online and one is single player. 
---
I understand that many people want a true fallout online game, but innovation is a thing and I feel that because the Perks are so flexible in FO76 but also badly designed that you can get duplicates of the same perk card it's a flawed system for higher levels. 
---
One of my level 100 friends won't level up anymore in fear of getting more duplications meaning he has to scroll through many duplicate cards just to equip locking to open a safe, then spend a minute resetting it back to how it was. 
---
I think we should just agree to disagree as we both have valid opinions and neither one of us is wrong, we just have a different idea of what we want with the Perk cards. 
---
Any chance at a pm? Would like to make some nuka dark or grape in mass quantites but not noticeable ones
---
Huh?  You find no npc's interesting?
---
Your comment makes no sense at all.  Never said the game wasn't interesting.
---
Wow
---
My hunger/thirst have been about the same, but my food isn't spoiling hardly at all (newly crafted soup showed little or no decay after several hours and multiple server hops).
---
It's been suggested that the fermenter may have something to do with it, and as I haven't done the quests yet, that sounds plausible.  I'm planning on checking that as best I can tonight.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I was thinking, cause the kill switch is soooo random
---
Dang I'm on ps4. I have 12 just chilling in my stash. I main a junkie build so I never use them.
---
Was hoping to pass them to you! Oh well
---
"This definitely isn't a job for someone with terminal lumbago."

Rifle Gaming nukes places so you don't have to, doesn't matter if there is a load screen, the interior will also get nuked
---
No one is forcing anyone to read about how to do it. 
---
Train stations have them posted too. Just pop into the nearest one and check the walls.
---
I'm nowhere near high level (just hit 84 before work) but I like to try new stuff. I'm based out of the Southern Savage Divide, but now I'm doing the Biv quests limiting myself to walking roads (no cross country). Come across more random encounters that way - got hit by the insult bot twice, bought some lemonade recipes, and found a bunch of other fun encounters I hadn't seen before. Also got the Civil War Top Hat plan, so I'm basically done with the scavenging for stuff to sell game. Or I'll go out with no armor, chems, food, or water, and just a combat knife (I'm a sniper build with basically no melee perks), see if I can make it from one corner of the map to the other. There are ways to make the game challenging and different if you seek them out.
---
This scared the crap out of me while I was doing an aluminum run in Fort Defiance
---
That option doesn't even show up on PC as far as I've been able to see, I tried to get back on servers that way many times and the join option just isn't there for anyone that isn't on my friends list

I'm on the top of the mountain next to the stone arch, great for sunrises. No extractors, but I have a little brewery farm.....

I found the one to the east side of the water park entrance.  But compared to pretty much everything else it was so rare.
---
Then I fast travelled to Billings/Silvia Homestead and walked away with 200 Corn and 200 Razorgrain, cause my teammates had picked my CAMP farm clean.  I was actually worried that my Thistle would spoil before I got back to brew my Hollar x.x
---
No they don't. So far all the thing I have gotten have only SPECIAL -x, +y, + z effect. Probably only few got vintage effect.
---
&gt; you need to make the game interesting somehow
---
&gt;Never said the game wasn't interesting.
---
If you say so. Also, if you're too dumb to understand the story, that's on you.
---
I‚Äôm sure some people do like this. I don‚Äôt mind game walk through and I‚Äôve looked up stuff when stumped.
---
It‚Äôs the whole, I data mined and didn‚Äôt actually figure this out. Not really how they intended this to be figured out.
---
Great job
---
Salty gamers are usually a lot like anti-vaxxers.  Lots of arguments that don't hold water for most people, sprinkled with *just* a few outright lies.
---
Of course there will be some cases of abuse of the reporting system, in exactly the same way I expect some people to abuse PvP. It's on BGS to sort out legitimate reports from frivolous ones. However, whatever the situation, people should be encouraged to report if they feel that it's warranted.
---
I feel like the people trying to slap damage pacifists to death at train stations, or team contest workshops they have no interest in to wreck CAMPs and jump questing lowbies and teabag them are just as likely to abuse features. 
---
A guy was hassling me yesterday trying to slap me to death, then wanted to trade, then kept throwing grenades on me, then wanted to team up, then kept shooting me and so on and kept following me around doing it while I was clearly uninterested. That didn't strike me as reportable, just obnoxious.
---
I can't even log on at this point. Everytime I try and hop on the game it says loading world and as soon as the countdown gets to zero the screen goes black and I get a server disconnect message. I'm hoping the hotfix today fixes this.
---
My two favorite spots to wake up. 1. The tea party with hats everywhere. 2. The locked red door to nowhere.

SEriously the more people you have on a team the more likely one small change will break something unrelated as another person stupidly put the back bone of their part with a 1 to always be a 1 in a location when it can easily be changed to a 0 and shouldn't be the backbone to anything.

Otherwise, I‚Äôve seen plenty of people on at any time.  Just ask someone to do a quest with you from time to time.
---
I never said I was, lighten up Francis.  
---
No one forced you to thread my opinion. 
---
At the end of the railroad tracks is some little camp thing and a deflated boat... This would make a lot of sense. 
---
So like, not saying I do, but if I waaanted to, what is the most profitable way to do this?
---
What LVL are you?  Your SB is a gift that keeps on giving. 
---
Man it would be awesome if you can have portable instruments to play while walking from point A to point B. Maybe a backpack where you can plop down a stool and start playing? shinannigin potentials are endless.
---
Even better if it was an aggro tool to draw the attention of enemies nearby. Only negative is if someone finds a base, jumps/flys onto a roof, drawing in enemies from relative safety..  
---
Do you have a reliable location to pick up lots of it? I pick up every can I find to keep 'just in case' and I've only collected about 200 cans since the beta and haven't used any yet.
---
Try some of the higher turrets.  Heavy Laser I think is level 25?  Missile, Shotgun, etc.
---
You are COMPLETELY correct on the bounty system, it‚Äôs absolutely garbage, and needs to be addressed because yes that exchange and no repercussions is bad for the health of the game. For the record after I accrue a massive bounty I just play normal and paranoid until someone inevitably comes to collect, but yea there‚Äôs a lot of shitheads who are afraid of dying to a random who still like to pretend they are raiders.
---
Hard lemonade is a ap buff.
---
Definately a nice spot.
---
Oh hell yeah, this is even better then the Flame paint, Thank You with extreme enthusiasm for this info. You are truly a good person for sharing the vital info.
---
Not massively disagreeing with you but I would say what if in the game 'Psycho' was named 'Heroin'?
---
Beer, Whiskey, Rum all very harmful substances that some people might have a painful history with. Being drunk is 'funny' but nodding out with a needle in your arm isn't. Weird innit?
---
Stay in the forest (left of the map) for some time, level up, explore, have fun. 
---
If another player approach you, three things might happen:
---
They wave and go by. 
---
They will murder you for fun (rarely).
---
They will drop a paper bag: look inside, there is a gift for you. 
---
Spendthrift. I'm closing in on $.02 per hour.

https://twitter.com/bethesdasupport/status/1106570762423541761?s=21 here you go
---
... this is the thread about the hot fix.
---
thanks for the tips!
---
Again, you‚Äôre making a claim counter to your first claim (‚Äúthere‚Äôs no numbers to go off of‚Äù... ‚Äúa little upgrade‚Äù).
---
There‚Äôs plenty of things in this game that don‚Äôt have listed numbers. People figure it out anyway. Explosive doesn‚Äôt have its numbers listed, but we know it‚Äôs 20%. Bloodied doesn‚Äôt have its formula listed; I don‚Äôt even know what it is but I like the results (I‚Äôve heard 60% damage cap). 
---
For caps, the easiest way for me is assault/combat rifles and chems. Just go through a few super mutant locations, grab their weapons, and you‚Äôll be able to get a few hundred caps. And I don‚Äôt use chems except for the occasional buffout, so...yeah, just grab every one you can in a location and you‚Äôll be good to go. And then raw asbestos from cigarettes. Every other week I have way too much, like in the 300-500 range, and those can see for 1 cap each. 
---
Interesting. I wonder if the hundred percent exploding instantly vs the people who say they are not exploding instantly on them all the time is perhaps specific to a console? Or perhaps a bug that wants it occurs causes the person to always have instant explosions? I experienced this playing with a friend who had both explosive and bloody mess which is why I asked about those. We are playing on PS4.
---
I'm running on the assumption that the people who say it's not happening all the time after the patch and your experience that it is happening all the time are both true, therefore something is causing the difference.
---
No I'm not a Bethesda employee or anything but I did game testing many years ago and I love playing with theories.
---
i didn't even know you could mod fo76 yet! hell's bells there are some useful ones on the nexus.
---
In general, if you aren't executing 3rd party code to get there, the devs wont give a shit. Every game has glitches and spots you are "supposed" to be able to go. Then there are isolated places like the "dev room" that is only accessible via a mod. Using mods to get to places you aren't supposed to be is what will get the ban hammer dropped on you. 
---
I think it would be a nice system.  Work similar to the Fermenter system.
---
Whats the highest level turrets? 
---
I retract my statement.  Just realized this is for bunker 7, not bunker 3.
---
Apparently they‚Äôve added an option to toggle whether or not you see Atom Shop items in the build menu. I‚Äôd check to see if you got those hidden. The party poster is in the same section as the Mothman poster in the Wall Decor category; it‚Äôs a variant of the Mothman poster. Took me a minute to find it ok cuz my TV cuts the edges of the screen and I didn‚Äôt see the variant arrow on the left side of the Mothman poster lol. 
---
It'll probably start again now that I got rid of that damned 6 pound shovel in my stash.
---
This might explain why we were able to run through Mama Dolce‚Äôs twice in like a 30 minute span last night.
---
Fwiw, I had the rum challenge and it competed just fine for me, so it's not broken for everyone.
---
I got a bottle of Ballistic Bock and the recipe for cranberry moonshine as rewards. 
---
 I think the main thing you are missing in your use of Twitch as a metric is that the majority of people playing this game have never watched a twitch stream and have no desire to because we are adults. I only know what Twitch is because of Critical Role. 
---
Does your camp have stacked foundations? 
---
Anybody have a clue how much damage  a legendary robot explosion does? I remember in Fallout 4 even having like 400-500 life, I'd still die from the explosion if I got careless, and it seems pretty powerful even in 76.
---
Before someone redoes this and claims it as there own.... Thank You for posting this. 
---
Building a fusion generator isn't simple IRL, either, but I'll suspend my disbelief for better game play. 
---
Ask people if they want to pvp, take workshops or going up to people and punch them once and see if they are flagged. Some people will fight you back but some will ignore you. 
---
I have a lot of replies, I don't always see which thread I'm replying to, lol. I thought it was the thread *I* had posted yesterday about the hunger/thirst increasing way too fast.
---
Also, it's early where I am and I've only had half my pot of coffee necessary to function...
---
I don‚Äôt know, but I sure as hell hope not. 
---
"traded a lot (got 50k+ caps), achieved lv192 and had a lot of fun, really good gear, most rare outfits and looked forward for more. Unfortunatelly, I bought the account from one ass...., who sold it to other people too (I didn't knew about it untill today) and hour ago someone who bought the account entered the game, deleted all the characters, spend some atoms in shop and destroyed my entire progress. "
---
How is that even possible? I'm really confused what you mean. Whoever has access to the account, has access to all the characters too right? If several people have access to an account they must see it's some kind of shared thing?
---
Yup, &lt;enter completely unrelated item here.&gt;
---
This is actually a fallout 4 feature; legendary robots explode. Legendary sentry bots used to explode twice, not sure if they still do in 76. 
---
I think the Heavy Laser is the highest level.  But not sure how they perform damage wise on all levels.
---
I stopped using them until this most recent patch because they took too much budget.
---
Now I just have 9 level 15 Heavy Machine Guns lining the top of my house, overlooking all sides of my CAMP.  But I have yet to be attacked since the update, so I don't know how well they perform yet.
---
Gave ya an up vote to counteract the down votes you're getting.
---
That would be great too. Or even BlakThumb's idea of locking perks.
---
For features like this, I really want things to be either Impossible or Painless. What we have now is Possible-but-Tedious, which is just terrible. It's as if you had to stop and type "I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN THIS DOOR NOW PLEASE" every time you wanted to open a door. There's just no point to it.
---
Neither does Super Duper, and people don‚Äôt complain about it. 
---
Level 31 would be happy to play if you are GT: TuskedCargo99
---
weird, it had been over 20 hours for me. def will try again tonite
---
Sounds like a good idea. But it's gonna have to require coal
---
~3 hours or so is the norm for downed servers.  You can watch this thread for when they go back up.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/328556/fallout-76-maintenance-march-15-2019
---
Thanks. I appreciate it. Not to upset when it happens. I knew I led be getting downvoting for expressing anything that is about respecting the makers of any game and not spoiling and kind of cheating. 
---
I just like being able to make Whiskeys to be able to craft Grape Mentats without having to scour the world trying to find a Whiskey.
---
That is what I meant by new effects. Also, Firecracker whiskey, for example, causes your bullets to ignite enemies, as far as I remember, etc.
---
Yes, I got a Vintage Tickblood Tequila which makes your Melee attacks sap health from your enemies and heal you but at the chance of getting diseases with each hit.
---
Awesome! Thanks!
---
...I would like to see that changed on the intro screen, though...if they'd just change "@Fallout" to "@Bethesdasupport" and it would be perfect. Seems like an easy fix.
---
wow that place is huge!!! love the look of it
---
Re: " it's the way the game was set up "
---
This is what we are actually complaining about. We do not want this to be the way the (Adventure server) game is set up. We want these PvP/griefing mechanics ***gone***. Kaput. Removed completely (excepting workshops...I suppose) from the PvE version of the game.
---
Every time I see "b-b-but it's in the game" as an excuse for non-consensual hostilities I just think of EA. Nothing that is in the game has to stay in the game. Especially not things that sour the game experience for peaceful players.
---
My pad and western side porch in the toxic valley are there for just this purpose. sunsets and glowing pools at night 
---
MODUS was the worst, but once you're done, you're done for that character. Biv is pissing me off after two days.

Walk into speakeasy, spam "Interact" for 30 seconds. Step away for smoke. Come back, maybe you've been assigned a daily...

&gt;Fallout 76 will be **temporarily offline** for all platforms today, starting at 11:00 a.m. EDT, while we perform a **hotfix**
---
THAT'S NOT HOW [HOTFIXES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotfix) WORK! GOOD NIGHT!
---
Seriously. If you take your product offline to apply the fix, it's just a regular old ***patch***; if you apply the fix while the product is running (or "hot"), it's a ***hotfix***.
---
Get it right.
---
wow, this one of the coolest screenshots ive seen yet, i've also noticed when the sun is low it makes those great rays of light, they look particularly cool coming in through the trees

https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Plague+walker
---
^ pretty sure that's the culprit    
---
Currently have all mutations (except herbavore).
---
Look up cap stash routes online and collect them with cap collector 3, kill graffton monsters (14-19 caps each), go on a super mutant killing spree (1-5 caps each), behemoths drop caps too, clear enemies from workshops (you don‚Äôt need to take the workshop just clear them (20-40 caps) sell excess chems and junk to vendors plus high value clothing (ranger outfit straight jackets etc) for 1400 caps per day as there‚Äôs 7 vendor factions with a pool of 200 caps each, use hard bargain 3 and grape mentats for better prices, pharma pharma perk will get you extra chems to sell, try not to fast travel when possible and equip travel agent for when you have to fast travel as this will save caps overtime, pick up and turn in technical data at camp venture for 25 caps, I do this between visiting the Harper‚Äôs ferry vendor and watoga vendors as it‚Äôs on the way, check every bin, dumpster, newsstand, etc as even if they only have 1-5 caps it mounts up over time, between vendors, cap stashes, clearing workshops, graffton monsters and super mutants and doing events etc I earn around 2000 caps per day on a good day
---
Oooh good point, an actual use for coal, since no one uses the purified water recipe when it's 100x easier to build a bunch of large water purifiers.
---
The workshop up by the waterpark produces acid. It's faster than grinding Snallys. 
---
Smelting as its own crafting thing does have some potential though. 
---
did you unequip animal friend and try again?
---
Usually ~3 hours or so.  You can watch this thread to see when the servers go back up (just refresh the page every half hour or so).
---
None of the new alcohols are affected by Party Boy/Girl or Cola Nut (For Nukashine)
---
He's not accusing anyone of lying, he's saying that the problem is oversaturated because it doesn't happen that often, but there are a LOT of users, hence people thinking it's a much bigger issue than it is.
---
FWIW, I actually DO think people are whining over nothing, and that this is either a really rare occurrence that people say happened to them because it's yet another thing to bitch about, or they're Whitespring Turret bases, which people are gonna destroy because, let's face it, fuck people who do that.
---
There's also the possibility of it being children in the console versions, because that usually is the case.
---
I was walking around near the golf course on the road and saw a bunch of white springs robots fighting something as well as a death claw. They were teaming up on it. Got in and finished it off. About 300 hrs in I think. 
---
No, 76 is down for maintenance.
---
I‚Äôd recommend just joining up with some random players if you are open to playing with others. I agree that it does feel lonely without npcs, but a lot of people I‚Äôve come across are very welcome to joining my party.
---
I'd suspect that it's online current player count meets or exceeds Rust and the rest. 
---
yo ill help you out after classes. dm me your gt
---
And this is why I fucking love reddit 
---
Sweet thanks.
---
No problem.
---
Sweet! Thank you for this. X-01 only, or T-45 through X-01?
---
I use missile turrets because they are strong and don't require too many perk cards. 
---
They must achieve their dreams of being satellites posthumously!
---
This would be amazing. If anything it'll let us know where we could build
---
Yepper, that's the ban message.  Check your email associated with your Bethesda account (and check the spam).
---
Oh I understand, I was saying my vice vaguely because I am paranoid about stuff being traced back to me.
---
Burr they are for the regular booze, right?
---
That's actually neat! You can only do one Biz quest a day?
---
im refering to little upgrade to no visible diffrence thats worth the annoyance to craft the ammo
---
The game is currently sold for about 15 euros on key sites. On December it was maybe 10 euros. You get a code and you register it to your own created Bethesda account. 
---
I don't see 6 dollars particularly suspicious. At release or prior to it I would have, but around Black Friday is was super cheap everwhere.
---
Same. Had all but 3 explode immediately upon death. most went rag-dolling into the air.  1 that didnt explode got caught in the spawn thing. One disappeared while in it. The last just died normally (exploded 6ish sec later)   
---
Wasnt counting, but there seemed to be a higher than average number of legendaries  
---
Didnt think to take a SS. was pretty funny though.
---
The same guy that instantly teleports you from one side of the map to the other instantly teleports his fee out of your pocket.
---
&gt; There's a hotfix dropping today that may address it,
---
But probably won't as it isn't mentioned:
---
&gt; a hotfix to address an issue with the Fermenter, an issue with nuke silo codes, and make some stability improvements
---
The pop up tells you it's maintenance;-)
---
Yes, please!  I just want people to spawn face-to-teeth with my deathclaw statue when they fast travel to my base.  :D
---
I will agree with you on those points. What about a compromise of simply being able to *hide* duplicate cards or ones that you don't want to use or see? This actually sounds like it wouldn't be hard to do.
---
And as far as perk packs go, it's all RNG. 
---
Most of the time they retweet it but this they didn‚Äôt 
---
mmmmm..... Grape Mentats....
---
I have to log on now and snatch this!!!
---
Any idea on if this works for 'Prototype X-01 armor'?
---
Pretty much yes. I only have Tickblood Tequila and Nukashine to go off of. There maybe some others that ARE effected but I doubt it. If Nukashine was  affected it'd be OP.
---
Hemlock Holes isn't faster, and when you take into account the time you spend taking it, setting it up, retaking or defending it after it's attacked by NPCs... it's not even worth grabbing unless you're going to have it for 3-4 hours, and even then... going back there every 30 minutes to grab 30 acid just isn't worth it.
---
You can kill the snallygasters twice with server hops and get 30-40 acid in 5 minutes. Thing is, I can go through 300-400 acid in a day producing ammo, so that could mean an hour or two of grinding them. That just doesn't seem like a fun way to play or what Bethesda intended. You could make an argument that workshops need a buff to what they produce (and I would agree with you), but that's another discussion.
---
Ok thank I have to finish my classes too
---
Hey. No I didn‚Äôt, I‚Äôm fairly new so I don‚Äôt know any exploits. The house was on a 2x2 concrete foundation, wood walls and a bed, and 2 crafting stations 
---
To be fair, they would do us all a favor and make it a no-build zone in advance, since they're removing our camps from that location upon login anyway
---
You're not removing that Nukashine bottle and then storing it in your Stash are you? Because the Fermenter and your Stash box share inventory... I said the same thing you did before I realized I was moving the same Nukashine bottle back and forth. LOL!
---
Does anybody else find it scary that the posts seem to be coming from a vengeful mothman?  Want to go into VATS and start shooting.
---
7 years ago I cut alcohol out of my life. The fo76 alcohol usage has not influenced me to want a hard lmaonade irl. I do want to buy lemons to enjoy iced lmaonade or arnold palmers though irl. I hope bethesda plans to bring espresso brewing to fo76. Please

Is part of a much bigger problem timing in the game in general is broken.

I was able to log in today and lo and behold I wasn't missing a single item from my inventory and everything as it was the day I initially was banned. I hope everyone else is able to get into their account and is able to carry on as if nothing happened. See yall in the wasteland.
---
Oh sorry.  For a minute I thought you didnt know how to read.  It's just the comprehension part.  
---
Again saying you need to make the game interesting somehow doesnt mean the game isn't interesting.  
---
Never said I didnt understand the story.  There is a major lack of purpose compared to other Bethesda games.  Very shallow in comparison.
---
Go on...
---
Do the missile turrets damage the camp from the  explosions or no? 
---
Oh-- okay. Cool. I'd never checked before, and was confused.
---
Actually, if another redditor's theory is true, then what they do to fix the nuke silo issue may fix hunger/thirst/spoilage too: time.  The way in game time passes is messed up, that's why people are getting the ridiculous 8967435798 hour cool downs on silos.  I think that redditor was right and it's what's affecting hunger/thirst/spoiilage, too.
---
As far as I can tell. I DID do two dailies yesterday but that was 1 before work, then 1 8 hours later after work. lol. Idk if that was intentional on their part though.
---
Well darn 
---
If I had a dollar for every time I thought "damn text chat would be great right now" I wouldn't be at work. 
---
Yep and they have a massive radius. Every time. I do the Watauga run I end up Killing myself. 
---
I don‚Äôt get the point of the post. People are playing it. Does that offend you? The things that you are assuming are measurements of a games player base are not. 
---
Twitch measures a games popularity like top40 radio stations play the ‚Äúactual‚Äù best music. 
---
Aye hiding cards would also work, or letting me favourite cards would be a good idea too so they show up before unfavourited Cards. 
---
And perk packs are random but are taken from a pool of cards that removes ones you already own (but only works for ones that you can only get once, like Green Thumb, Professional Drinker, Woodchuck, ect) 
---
Oh yes, I would farm so hard for a working coffee maker in the game. Drip, steamed, filtered with old socks, I don't even care.
---
Valid points. The responses here only reinforce that fact that people who haven't struggled with an addition don't understand those that do. Different people have different triggers. If someone's able to disassociate the fantasy of drinking a 'Blackwater Brew' from the reality of drinking a 'Bud Light' or whatever their drink of choice was, then they might not have issues. But if they glorify their days of wild college parties and the quest line triggers those thoughts and they think about the sensation of drinking, the taste, the feeling, the buzz, etc, it could cause problems. 
---
People will laugh but I've been addicted to pop my whole life. Mt Dew specifically. I could put down a 2-liter a day. I've finally kicked the habit and have lost a ton of weight just cutting that. But the other day, a co-worker was talking about how much she loved Coca-Cola and wanted one and my mouth honestly started watering and I had an intense craving for Mt Dew. It was a struggle not to just go down to the gas station for a cold fountain pop. Had to do stuff to get my mind off it. Because right there, that's the only thing I wanted and could think about. And that's a very mild addiction. I can't imagine those that were addicted to drugs that have strong mental and physical modes of addiction. Don't even get me started on meth and heroin.
---
It tells you in the right corner when you go to log in that the servers are down. 
---
Wotoga usually has a fair bit on the tables on the side by the river by the pheonix vendor
---
I did that last night and got 5 milks, but it spoiled in less than 10 minutes
---
VATS should absolutely not be removed. 
---
 - VATS are the counter to the sentinal /assasin PvP meta armor. 
---
 - Talke a stealthboy and you cannot be targeted in VATS. So there's your answer. Use secret agent.
---
This game is supposed to play like an RPG not a FPS. Vats are a staple for crit builds, melee and getting through some of the better armor. Every build should be using VATS in PvP occasionally. 
---
Lol yeah, I think it's amusing tbh.
---
I do the same thing I did in 4 after beating it. I just wander around. In 4 I had the whole Minuteman to NCR mod going on with FCOM, so I‚Äôd ‚Äúpatrol‚Äù the Commonwealth. Make up missions that my ‚Äúcommander‚Äù gave me to do, protect merchants, occasionally wander in the Glowing Sea. 
---
In 76 I still wander around. I get my day‚Äôs worth of caps first, but then I‚Äôll try to help low level players. I can‚Äôt sell anything else but I have a legendary weapon that‚Äôs just the right level for somebody in the Ash Heap? Go over to them and drop it off. There‚Äôs a group of 3 or 4 in an area that might be too challenging for them? Turn on pacifist and go help them out. 
---
Or alternatively, since I have a TSE hunting rifle and a chameleon piece, I‚Äôll just find somebody and shoot around them for fun. I won‚Äôt actually hit them, and even if I do by accident I‚Äôll be too high up for them to find me. Or they‚Äôll run right into me, move out of the way from the physics, and keep going....and I have a mini heart attack because of playing Spy in TF2. 
---
Anyway, I‚Äôm rambling. The main thing is, make up your own fun. Do whatever the hell you want. Try to tame that deathclaw for your camp. Max out as many perk cards as you can. Experiment with different builds, help people, be a raider, whatever. Just do what makes the game fun in your eyes. 
---
If you still had it open from last time the message might still show the Atom shop blurb. 
---
At least that's what happened to me. 
---
It's not so awesome. It still bugs out and gets stuck on 0 quite a bit and won't let you swing. It also can't swap to targets behind you, so often you end up dropping out of VATS.
---
Don‚Äôt use a shit ton of weapons, try to narrow down to 2-3 weapons so you don‚Äôt waste carry weight 
---
I'm curious what guns you're using that you're going through that much ammo? Are you using 100% heavy even on little stuff? Or are you selling? 
---
Yeah. All food seems to be spoiling quicker too, or is that just my imagination?
---
It shouldn't be too long, it's already been one hour.
---
Why, if they have Starched Genes?
---
Not at my comp, so best I can give is semi vague advice.
---
Live I was taking damage till I moved away and looted from the rear.
---
True but not all players know. Seasoned players who beat the quest will know more. 
---
But it's the other items like purifiers and such that are not at those locations.
---
You also have to use caps to fast travel unless you choose not to use fast traveling to make it harder.
---
What does Twitch have to do with this game? We're playing the game, not watching twitch. You must be interested in the game as well, otherwise you wouldn't be here. 
---
Wrong. Repaired above 100% melee weapons do more damage. 
---
really? I didn‚Äôt think I was playing for honor that long 
---
Or perk card trading like an ingame trading card game.
---
Or simply being able to *hide* cards that you don't want to see.
---
I've seen quite a few posts along these lines with some ideas and suggestions being much better than others. 
---
Not everyone uses starched genes
---
First day off in 9 days, and get the nukashine quest done, and bam, off line.
---
FML.. ;)
---
Not trying to be a dick but everything in this post has been said a thousand times and another one will pop up every day with near identical responses.
---
I have my base in the same place... happened to see the same thing you described....they did something else there too...looks like they added some branches on the trees that weren't in the game before....now I have these branches sticking through my base
---
Why am I not surprised there's weirdness 
---
Yeah , And Now I wonder it is at all Possible to Make no damage bases? whats to prevent them from boxing in a visitor with walls. 
---
Yep it a situational piece.  I like it, will need to update one of my suits to use it.
---
Yeah the robots now immediately explode every time, I know they used to be on a random timer but now its deadboom with no delay
---
Just like a real drunk. As annoying as it might be I hope it's deliberate.
---
Yes! I saw him there in the beta and had a second encounter with him there when I showed a friend the course.
---
Calm down jeez. And he didn‚Äôt explain where it is or how to get it. He said how there was a hint in there factory but not a falsely good one. That picture on his post are in the files. 
---
I have a new purpose in this game and it is to get every new player I meet drunk off of Nukashine

If you wanted no griefing. Play fall out 4

can you message me how to solve please?

I've not had any personal issues with any substance but I was raised around alcoholics and it does in general bother me that in general alcoholism is acceptable for casual humour.

Fallout specifically I feel like I can disassociate enough to use chems, eat meat (vegie irl) and now I drink purely for the stat bonuses. It's just numbers and pixels.
---
Wait we have player vendors now? How do you obtain them?
---
*not a very good hint. And also only thing he did was prove its existence in the game.
---
Get rid of the double and we have a deal, it shouldn‚Äôt take two crop to fix one crop
---
Lots of things make your thirst increase faster; chems, over encumbrance (you don't have), speed demon (you don't have), diseases, and, the one that kills me the most, sprinting.  Sprinting makes you thirstier faster.  Logical!  But annoying for a zippy lunatic like me that likes sprinting *everywhere*.
---
One of the unlisted changes was they added a new animation to the Tinker's workbench.  I haven't actually seen anybody mention anything related to it until now.  Previously, the workbench shared the same animation as the chemistry station, where you'd just shake around a test tube.  Now you actually interact with the reloading press mounted on the bench.
---
But I didn't notice anybody else using it around the game, so I had no idea the sound was loud.  I'm guessing what happened is Bethesda somehow made the sound global, and it always sounds the same volume regardless of your distance from the sound source.  
---
Something similar occurs with firecracker berries too.  If a firecracker berry bush pops, the popping sound can be heard from some distance away.  You might have encountered it while you're walking around the Savage Divide and you hear a bush popping, but you can't figure out where it happened.
---
Cant check currently. Id take that lever action, but cant remember what my caps are at.
---
Good thing I do t take workshops, I‚Äôd never be able to afford bidding for a workshop
---
So you just ran up to 12 dudes minding their own business and said, "fuck it,  I'm going to attack you for no reason other than I MIGHT HAVE FUN?"
---
Glad you left when they said they didn't want to pvp though.  That's a breath of fresh air. 
---
Me too
---
It has Nuka Cola Quantum X-01 Power Armor plans inside 
---
Both! I use Gatling Gun (5mm) for easy stuff that I can one shot wherever I can, because it's so much more ammo efficient in terms of damage per shot, but for bigger stuff and SBQ I always pull out the .50 Cal. I can go through 2-5K .50 Cal ammo on a queen fight, depending on how many people are there and not contributing. Sad fact but a lot of people show up, tag the queen, then hide for the rest of the fight. But if I get over a certain amount I'll sell / trade it. I also just really enjoy going out in the world and gathering and crafting. I'll definitely be opening up a one stop guns &amp; ammo shop when the player vendor system goes live. Already have thousands (in some cases 10K+) stocked of most ammo!
---
No idea, I would say probably not, however, if they allowed you to "fast travel" to yourself weather or not you were over encoumbered or not it would hopefully solve the issue by moving you a little bit from where you currently are, also when you get stuck in places like behind walls and stuff in the base game you could get out without dropping stuff, so 2 birds 1 stone
---
I don't think it matters, I'm not at home this weekend so I can't try.
---
Just throwing out there that you can buy the Nuka Cola Clock off the wandering responder bot for like, 110 caps or so after max level hard bargain...1k is WAY over priced
---
Nope. They also don‚Äôt damage you. When ever I get to my camp I go around also clear out the glowing radtoads while everything explodes around me
---
I always set my CAMP up in the mountains, I've never even seen another player anywhere near my camp. It can be a little hard to place my blueprint but it's secure and the views are always lovely
---
Yep, servers went down little over an hour ago.  Soon!
---
Dupers
---
#PvP
---
Learn how to counter them ffs....
---
This is correct, I do it daily. 
---
I‚Äôll continue playing for honor till then, they‚Äôve got an event going on right now
---
I was in the middle of a Biv quest when the servers went down, hope it doesn't disappear like every other daily when I log back in. I lost my Camden Park and Pumpkin House dailies so many times because of crashes lately it's become annoying.
---
You can position things vertically. On an Xbox controller hold a and hit the buttons (above the triggers). To move it closer or farther hold a and use the left stick
---
Glorious explosions!
---
Let the Ultramarine invasion begin!
---
Came back to my (what was) 100% budget camp to have another 15% or so build space, added some new decoration + the new crafting station and fermentor, back up to 100% again, time to start complaining again I suppose /s
---
Not imaginary, I had to modify my harvesting pattern, after completing a 15-20 minute harvesting run, I returned to my CAMP to prepare things and a lot of stuff had spoiled already.
---
At the same time, at least, plants seem to be replenishing faster as well.
---
I only ask because the only time you get interaction options when aiming is when you have wasteland whisperer, robotics expert, or animal friend equipped
---
That‚Äôs is amazing
---
That would be nice and free fast travel to my store so I can have an incentive to finally put my camp on a cliff for a nice view away from the main routes of travel.
---
50 caps it is then. 
---
That dress is worth 20k+ caps, not 2k
---
That's what I've been told. Haven't really been able to test it out thoroughly myself, but on the Bass, the riffs did sound different to me between the Forest and the Savage Divide
---
ok, someone already solved it (by datamining) and uploaded all path to youtube - so, if you dont want spoilers - do not google videos about it. But if you want - its available
---
Hmmmm wonder if this hotfix will fix this..
---
nice!
---
Oh shut up for God's sake. They're fixing bugs and this is what you decided to complain about?
---
Or have the barrel spin up (and keep spinning) when I hold the "aim" button down.
---
I got offered that last week but wasn't sure it's rarity or price, thus the reason for the high price but I appreciate the input. 
---
I was out looking for PvP like I always am. Its part of the game by design.
---
Think about how many caps I made killing a group of 12...
---
Thats reason enough to seek out PvP, yeah?
---
I disconnected while on my Biv Daily last night.  When I rejoined it started up the Biv Dailies again.  So you may be in luck.
---
(Though, my Taste Test one did change what alcohol I had to drink.  For the better in my case, to an easier one I was already working on).
---
*Thank you* for adding that last part.
---
This game doesn't have enough content to render half the map irrelevant to high level players. 
---
They really need to add high level only servers where the regions aren't arbitrarily level capped. 
---
Dear god no, I still have nightmares from fishing in EQ and later WoW.  
---
The only thing close to this I have reported someone for is abusing the workshop PvP system, so getting a friend to start claiming the workshop while they are around us when we are not near it so that they can immediately 1 shot us, they did this several times and even after we blocked them, a few days later it happened again from the same (still blocked) player
---
That daily quest is Ecological Balance. Check the terminal in the trailer at the water treatment plant
---
yeah i think the server instability that re-surfaced recetnly might be due to the unbanned dupers back to their old tricks
---
&gt;only thing he did was prove its existence in the game 
---
which you seemed entirely confused about, I can't quote you because you keep deleting your comments but you literally questioned whether or not it was even in the game, then admit he proved it is...
---
I only have 4K caps so would u take 3000 caps for the shotgun?
---
happy cake day!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I never said he explained where it was, just how he figured it out, which you seemed confused on in your now deleted comment
---
I did two dailies last night for Biv at the same time.  One where I had to create and give him a certain one, and another where I had to drink and perform an action.  (Sneak attack in my case).  Not sure if it bugged and gave me two at the same time, or if it just works that way.
---
Very true my friend, I acquired a furious Gauss rifle and it doesnt take much time at all to send those asshats straight to hell, ESPECIALLY if she decides to land, then the pummeling intensifies.  
---
But think about when you were level 55-75 and you were probanly using a one star or your best vanilla weapons. Before they fixed the sonic ambush on the schorchbeats, after all the spent material, shes finally dead, you run up all excited to your proverbial loot pinat and  you get brains, a small amount of Ultracite and a leather right arm.  
---
Tell me you werent like "whaaaaa???"
---
Not sure this is new but the tinkerers workbench has a levitating round now.
---
I've got the same ign also.
---
It does matter. At 50 you're not going to have all of the same card loadouts you'll have at even 51+. Unless you're trying to say that perks don't matter towards your build, which is equally false.
---
Agreed, I would settle for a toggle function on the map to highlight where there are "no build zones." Similar to how Flatwoods has a safety zone when we are launching nukes.
---
*OR* have turrets scale to the area that the CAMP is in. This was a feature in Fo4. The turrets would be mk1 near Sanctuary, the turrets would scale up to mk7 the further away you got from Vault 111. There was a bug to change the model of turret but I'm not talking about that in this example.
---
Also.... What's up with the explosive turrets in the Harper's Ferry armory??!! WANT. 
---
Read the terminal in Judy's room for info on the robobrain (for those interested)
---
Yeah, but they *really* screwed up the vibe with the total lack of communication when the game was released in its alpha state.  
---
They should have run an actual beta for a month or so to get the worst game breaking stuff fixed. It would have drastically improved the reviews.
---
I like that I can see the nukes hit Watoga or whitespring now
---
Hi Gary, this is Gary.
---
The game is so cheap now I'm suprised more people are not picking it up.  They are really missing out.  I guess they are swayed by all the dbags who gave it 0/10. "Worst game ever made" reviews.
---
Billing Homestead on the west side of the map.   With the Green Thumb perk you can easily pick up 50-60 razorgrain.   There's an entire field.
---
There's really no reason to lock.your doors.  All anyone can do Is break stuff.  And it's easy to repair.  I've been playing since beta and have never locked my doors , I usually keep them wide open so others can use my stuff.  Ive never had my base destroyed.  
---
I REALLY want to respond to ‚Äòlighten up Francis‚Äô, but the response to that could be misconstrued as a threat lol. 
---
I‚Äôm not upset by what you said, I just don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs an issue. One of my regular teammates in-game specifically avoids this subreddit because he likes to find this stuff on his own. But there are a lot of people that just want stuff that looks cool in game and need to know where to find that stuff. To each their own, as far as I‚Äôm concerned. 
---
But my point was, no one has to look up anything they don‚Äôt want to, but if you‚Äôre on this subreddit, you‚Äôre bound to run into things you might not want to know about. It‚Äôs a minefield of information here, so if you want to keep some stuff secret, you have to watch your step. 
---
No. You're being a douche by running up to people minding their own business. 
---
"I'm a raider,  it's what I do.  I made 6k caps the other night. "
---
Yeah....by pissing off other people. If you were RP as a raider you would be using basic gear like all raiders in every other game.
---
"free"
---
Thanks a lot for the spoilers
---
My god, I can't believe I forgot to mention Gary as an example of the zaniness.  Doi!
---
Gotta say I love your name üòÇ made me laugh out loud. I'm not a PvP fan, and is nice you left when they asked you. But still that name üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Battered clipboards, and all plastic is more valuable than you realize
---
Damn, I hope I at least get to keep the Tick Blood Tequila recipe I got for the taste test today if it changes which recipe, be nice to double down on the recipe if it does though.
---
i fast traveled to a horde event in the mire, and i spawned deep inside of the nuke silo in one of the corridors between the reactor room and the first area where you make the ids. i couldn't progress either way so i had to kill all the bots and fast travel out. it was the only time something like that happened to me. 
---
That is not true. Some event locations don‚Äôt get higher level spawns either. Nuked Morgantown, and did feed the people. None of the spawns for the even were a higher level then in a non nuked zone. 
---
And it makes sense that interior locations don‚Äôt get affected by nukes. They are an entirely different cell. 
---
Payed $60, was disappointed at launch but I think the game has drastically improved since then 
---
117 bugs in the code
---
take one down
---
patch it a round
---
213 bugs in the coooode!
---
I set up shop near the overseers camp so I can cheaply sell nukashine and weapons to new players and watch them black out to different locations on the map.
---
the real thing that made fallout not fallout, is the removal of the actual RPG mechanics
---
i mean , FO4 reduced our protagonist from having any real say in replying to people, it was like 4 choices to say the same thing
---
I had this issue with the robots last night and found that once I left the area for a few minutes and came back the body was where I killed it.
---
Look, if you were a professional meteorologist and people kept referring to graupel as snow, at some point you'd point out that they're using the language of your chosen profession wrong and thereby making your job harder.
---
yeah but that was stage 1 of 7, so and this looks like it was going to be the probably the smallest of the 7, with the last 2 looking like the biggest most [fleshed out ones](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/3WheBXLAEMvTMFH70ejA9x/c38119dfaf0c67a3434df05b7d76d2c6/Fallout76_RoadMap_1920x1080_WildAppalachia-05-EN.png)
---
Its clearly an intended part of the game...
---
Im not doing anything that isnt allowed. Heck im not doing anything that isnt incentivised by the developers...
---
Yes. All x01.
---
Vintage Lead champagne increases fall speed and gives 15 damage resist and 100 rad resist
---
Nah I cleared it out once and got a 2* ghoul slayers missile launcher with extra damage while aiming.
---
ahh thanks for clarifying 
---
I play a melee build, and can confirm it happens instantly most of the time now since about 2 updates ago. When I farm Watabots, I use a deathclaw gauntlet with no explosive or fire producing effects. I can one-hit sneak-kill normal legendaries, with each successive star requiring another hit. All the ones I can one-hit kill have exploded instantly (no delay), killing me. The ones with stars still appear to delay 1-10 sec or not explode at all.
---
Thanks a lot. When the servers are back up I will check it. Cool find. 
---
I watched the video I think I'm still gonna struggle
---
Its been a very hotly debated topic almost since this game came out and there have been a plethora of ideas about how to fix it from the player base.  Some of us accept the game as it is and cope, others can't and won't ever, no matter what Bethesda does.  I think the salient point is that they are trying and eventually will get a game that the majority of players can accept and have fun with.  The only real question is:Will there still be a majority of players left out there by the time they do?  
---
was about to say exactly this, I would agree with your theory, the sped up distillation process might be bleeding over to all spoilage.
---
Anytime friend 
---
Fallout 76 is NOT a strict PVP game. If I am sitting in MY camp minding my own business I should NOT have to worry about getting attacked. There are plenty of other players more than happy to PVP with you. All I ask is to leave me alone. That's no reason to be getting all "don't play the game" on me people. That's why Bethesda gave you the option to turn pacifist feature on/off. 
---
So a group of 12 people got together in game to enjoy an event together, and you felt like you needed to orbital strike their base. Because *your* gameplay is soooo much more important than 12 other people.
---
With a chance of accidentally triggering an attack from a Giant Radsquid!
---
You‚Äôre probably too lazy to do all the legwork to get it anyway. So cry me a fuckin river. You‚Äôre not entitled. I can say what I want homie. 
---
I feel like they did this one first so that the other content can tie in with the brewing and distilling
---
dude, what are you talking about, Rifle has two videos where he nukes an interior cell...  the wendigo cave and Charlestown, in both videos the nuke affects the interior cell there, and I literally *never* said anything about event locations and how/if they are affected
---
TS or Anti-Armor
---
Shoot, thanks anyways for the offer and information. Much appreciated. 
---
&gt;  aside from a few issues I've been on the front line with like right now being locked out of my main character due to the game breaking glitch me and a few others discovered in this latest update
---
Which is possibly being fixed at this very moment.  Fingers crossed.
---
I'd take that shotgun off your hands for the list price. I'll either be able to meet you in game tonight or not until Wednesday next week, depending on the weather where I am.
---
They certainly will. If placing items from stash didn't, people could effectively quadruple their current build budget, which would negatively affect server performance.
---
Be prepared for each of those items to have about as much budget cost as your typical furniture/decorative piece does now.
---
You could use the barn red walls to separate your room and place your mirror on it. I think it looks pretty good.  
---
Counters or not, 90% damage reduction for something as easy as standing still is ridiculous
---
I understand that it's allowed by the game. So was duping for awhile.
---
See why your argument is bad? Just because the game allows it doesn't make it fun for everyone. 
---
I hope when pvp servers are added that they disable pvp (except for workshops) in regular servers.
---
There are a ton of bugs after the patch.   More than before.  My game was finally running smooth before but now it's all jacked up. 
---
remember, Atom store is supposed to be for cosmetic changes only
---
COFFEEE
---
Yeah definitely, I think its the sudden influx of people playing again after the first DLC so the servers suddenly got strained again
---
Idk when they changed it but joining events can now place you in an interior cell. Joining Uranium Fever places me directly inside when I go there now. 
---
Where is everyone getting Sentinel from? Not seen it once in my +/- 400 hours.. not a single piece.
---
You're definitely not wrong that they fubared the release. I'm late to the game (got it a month ago) so I'm one of the lucky few who's only had a positive experience. From my admittedly limited perspective, the lingering "why do you morons even play this" posts seem increasingly out of touch.
---
It sounds like you need to set up your camp at an acid node.
---
Also, use your excavator armor at Lucky hole mine.  You can EASILY pull out 400-600+ lead ore in one run.
---
Farm supermutants for their guns, ammo and gunpowder.  Use scrapper to get more out of their guns when you scrap them.
---
Simple, pack half a pound of ball bearings in each radaway grenade, ensuring the chem can get into bloodstream without an IV.  
---
Rads won't be a problem any more.
---
A coffee pot is a coffee mug if you just don't care!
---
Well, my first quest was "beer" so I already had the recipe.  And after the disconnect it gave me "oak haller lager" instead.  But I also had a second quest from him that had already given me the Oak Haller.
---
So I don't know if you get to keep the recipes it gives you each time?  Actually if it does, that seems like the potential to just server hop til you get a bunch...
---
Unless it's different if you just disconnect vs log out with the quest active.
---
No it's the mirror that's bugged....happened to me a couple of times trying to place on wall...just store foundation and the mirror should be stored too
---
3000 to low, I paid 4500 for it. It's one of the best guns in the game, believe me. It's a street sweeper... You can clear WS in a hazmat suit with it provided your aim is good. It's worth more than my asking price dude. I sound like a douche lol but its worth it's weight in gold.
---
Plus I'll throw in 1000 rounds for free. 
---
I'll also mod the weapon to your liking. 
---
Would have loved if that statuette was actually full size.
---
Instigating is good too. Have a look at the list yourself, it‚Äôs fun to try and decide on your own. 
---
Lol comparing duping to pvp. BGS didn't put duping in as game design
---
My camp is on an acid node for this reason. Only problem is, the extractor only holds a max of **10** acid at a time.
---
I still don't understand why it has to be so low.
---
My only complaint is he needs to be louder. I tested it on a few different computers and his voice is abnormally softer than every other robots voice. I find my self turning up the volume when I'm interacting with him and turning it back down afterwards.
---
What‚Äôs your gamer tag? I‚Äôm looking for an explosive, two shot shotgun. I don‚Äôt have a lot of caps atm but I will msg you when I do have caps..,provided you have what I need of course..
---
Agreed.  It's the selfishness this game invites. I love this game and have a lot of fun playing it but HATE pvp is Fallout.  Why can't me and my friends get together at my bar and chill without the theater of getting attacked by other players?
---
Create servers for people who care about pvp and get them the hell out of adventure mode Beth please. 
---
You linked to a Wikipedia article that has a whole section named "vendor-specific definitions" for a hotfix. Could you please use another completely unrelated profession to explain that one away? Use plumbing this time.
---
They were mass duplicated by unscrupulous types who took pleasure in ruining the game for everyone. Now you can get it for a few days worth of vendor caps from other players. 
---
So you griefed them?  Seriously?  
---
It's a good start, but not yet where it needs to be. Keep in mind that you likely received such a high impact from the change due to heavy use of things like lights or turrets. A lot of builders like myself are only getting about 10-15% free budget space from this change because we already optimized our builds by reducing the expensive items used.
---
For now it's a great improvement. But when the ability to place items from stash comes out in a few weeks, it's not going to feel nearly as nice. :-p   It will still be quite difficult to make this small budget work with the level of detail many folks will want to achieve.
---
So I say great work, but keep it comin, Bethesda. :-)
---
I'd love to see some in-depth tests on this. In the meantime, I found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VZk_TFozwI) video that seems to achieve what I want for now. He uses a full set of chameleon armor, full sneak, escape artist, and 15 agility to be pretty much undetectable to all enemies. He even jumps on them and they don't see him. He also runs a bloodied build for that extreme damage, but it makes him quite fragile.
---
I'd love to see how this compares to the mutation+weightless wood armor with the shrouded mods. Or 3\* chameleon armor with +1 agility and the harder to detect effect, but that would be a god roll to find even one piece of that. I'd love to have a full set of that so I can use my perk points somewhere other than agility, like luck, to get some VATS critical goodness.
---
&gt; Also.... What's up with the explosive turrets in the Harper's Ferry armory??!! WANT. 
---
Incendiary rounds.  That individual was really good as protecting themselves in that maze to their lab :).  Must have had Rank 10 Home Defense Perk...
---
Yeah I've been pouring over it...the problem is I think some sound cooler than they end up being in practice. Both Furious and Vampire sound great to me, but don't see as many people using that as Two-Shot. Vampire especially seems like it would be fantastic. 
---
It seems you have to be pretty much right under the missile to get it.  Not just in the death zone of the blast.
---
It is indeed. I'll throw in 1000 rounds to. 
---
It can be found at Raider Vendors. I got mine at Sunnytop Station. I did have to server hop to get it to show up. It seems you only get the option to buy one stash plan at a time.
---
I would rather a rad x dart for the seringer.  Hit someone and suppress there mutations lol
---
It was mass duped and just as OP as TSEs were
---
That sucks man. That is why I dont leave them in the suitcase. I use the suitcase to facilitate the trade into their inventory, so you dont have to deal with the quantity and cost sliders, then we use the suitcase to trade it back on the new toon. 
---
Wasn't expecting an in-depth quest at all, it's just the launch point for a daily and a new crafting system. 
---
The meat of Wild Appalachia is gonna take time, and will manifest in a bunch of ways but primarily in Survival mode, for those who enjoy PVP. 
---
that's freaking hard though, i'm going to have to launch one in the middle of an empty field and sit there i guess.
---
76 is an online multiplayer RPG.
---
Elder Scrolls Online is an MMO.
---
Biv's daily quests are here to stay, so you've got all the time in the world. :)
---
They even made raiding camps an aspect of the game if u saw the trailers. Its made to mimic fall out 4 raiders attacking your camps
---
Let the nuke hit you pretty much. Worked for me and some friends that were having trouble getting it until I suggested that and it worked every time. 
---
It's been a while since I played 76. Has this been in the game since the start or in the new update?
---
Good job either way, gives me something to do!
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:
---
This is a bot providing a service. If you have any questions, please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffo76).[](#AUTOGEN_TSBREPLIEDBOT)
---
Depends on the rifle. Hunting rifle? Not so much. Handmade or combat? Could be good. Depending on if you want to maximize damage or have a little QOL by using less stimpacks. 
---
I got it by getting to White Springs pre nuke, and standing relatively dead center of the red nuke circle. Popped very 1st try.
---
I would hope that's part of today's hotfix, I also switched a Nuka dark out of the fermentor into my stash a few times before I realized it was the same one.
---
Yeah I really don't get this. I'd take every workshop if they just upped the max that they can hold to like 100.
---
Awesome! (I'm low on shells lol) Gamer tag is LowlightND
---
Ah ok, don‚Äôt buy stuff from people, so that‚Äôll explain that.
---
This is what searching from cryptids should be like -- many rumours that turn out to be wrong, leading to disappointment, then... what was that!

()*)W@#E## NO CARRIER
---
Sometimes they look like gummy sweets from afar 
---
Doesn't mean PVP is all the game is about. 
---
&gt;Could you please use another completely unrelated profession to explain that one away? Use plumbing this time.
---
Can do!
---
Look, if you were a professional plumber and people kept referring to a PEX repipe as a copper repipe, at some point you'd point out that they're getting a key part of your chosen profession wrong and thereby making your job harder.
---
$5
---
Gotta catch it with your face. 
---
Okay, so it wasn't just me. It's nice to have confirmation that it wasn't just some random hiccup on my end. I have already filed a help ticket and hopefully, today's hot fix fixed it.
---
No. My argument is not bad. Please read my edit above to the OP. I explain in detail why camp pvp is not greifing.
---
Engery weapon that fires ballistic energy class ammo that does ballistic damage and benefits from rifle perks.
---
This won't delete your structures will it? I can move the C.A.M.P. slightly without having to restart?
---
I'm not sure if Furious is good for a Rifle (unless you are using an automatic).
---
The idea would be to increase your first hit damage.  Two Shot, Instigating, Explosive would probably be top of the list for effects.
---
I'm running with an Instigating Lever Action and an AA Handmade with Vats Crit boost.  Max Rifle perks.
---
The AA/Vats Crit Handmade actually just tears thru Scorchbeats like they are nothing.  Ever since I was lucky enough to get that thing from a Legendary in the Emergency Services in Watoga, SBs have been no threat.
---
Happened to me last night.
---
Xbox One
---
Put the signal thingy in the satellite dish (spawns the robots) as part of Rose's (Top of the World) quest line, Level 38 Legendary Protecton and other lesser bots spawn,  beat the bots with a baseball bat, BOOM! Dead, all bot bodies gone, no loot.  
---
They are hotpatching some issues right now so the servers are down. 
---
Makes sense, since these are the unique paint jobs seen in the Nuka-World DLC!
---
  So simple, no? :)
---
I waited, and let him shoot. Took a few stims while I was taking the pictures. Got some nice shots. Plus...he was backed to the edge of a cliff. May have cut off his escape route. I killed him with a western revolver. Maybe he would have reacted differently with melee?

---
I see this suggestion every now and then on here, that would be too OP, there is a reason for the limit to how many perk cards you can use.  the system was never meant for hot swapping loadouts.
---
Oh god, what's the treasure trail for then? I assumed it might be the source of the nuka cola dark rum recipe. But it seems none of the new alchohol recipes have ingame source spots. You just get them from Biv behind the daily time game which is frankly awful.
---
All I read here was "two assholes decided to grief a group of 12 players who were just minding their business, and destroyed a camp for no reason other than to be an asshole"
---
&gt; Thanks to the people who contributed and let me know certain things instead of having your attitude.
---
Yeah I'm sorry I couldn't be helpful. Complains about trivial things doesn't bring out the best in me. 
---
I've enjoyed playing arty on WoT and AW, I've done my fair share of lurming on MWO ect. so I've heard all the usual die into cancer, reported for existing and whatever. I was highly impressed on MWO when I had low tier alt and I killed someone very fast from behind, and he said I was cheating, because as average player that's more or less the first and only time I hear anyone say something like that.
---
I can't fully understand how could someone be so totally new to online games they've not heard that kind of stuff before.
---
No.
---
Love yoir content @juicehead76!
---
I‚Äôm Team Grafton‚Äôs Mayor myself. 
---
I'd actually had it solved yesterday evening, though yeah there's a total break in the hints when it comes to the access code, I had to break down and look at the access code in FO76Edit to find where to go for that one.  Was providing hints to anyone that wanted them, as I thought it was a pretty cool puzzle, but I guess that's not an issue now. :P
---
Proof for anyone that cares - [https://imgur.com/a/Vnmmnjj](https://imgur.com/a/Vnmmnjj)
---
You are right about the technical term of "Hotfix", it should be done by a rolling server shutdown but then all their servers are on the same rack, just separated by platform it seems.
---
It's a ballistic weapon (shoots bullets), Also looks badass (especially with the suppressor) and IMO one of the best rifles in the game. 
---
There is usually one at the acid pits near grafton station. It wanders outside of the workshop boundaries, but I usually see it everytime I go there. 
---
THIS:  cavaliers 
---
Hope you didn't spend to much on it, there is a reason you never see this drop in the game, it's all duped, and i can promise you it will be nerfed , banned or delete very soon by Bethesda.
---
When that happens i hope they will force your character to be running around in dirty dippers and just holding a rolling pin for at least 6 month, lol
---
Yup, you are right, i really hate to be forced by "censored" in to pvp....
---
You wont be able to convince the folks. This sub doesnt know that raiders are part of the game, you'll be downvoted to hell if you attack someone and/or their camp and say it here, there's even a perk for increased damage to camps. Everyone here wants to hold hands in the wasteland, it's borderline pathetic and childish. Raiders were an integral part of the lore of fallout and being one was something this game allowed but the people here are too sensitive and go "waah, bethesda he's so mean to my character, why is this allowed, why cant we all suck each other." News flash, fallout is meant to be dark, raiders/griefers no difference, there are no rules in the wasteland.
---
They have finally nerfed melee, just not how we expected lol.
---
I like your work you put into this. Can you please clarify Final Damage and how it is calculated? I am curious how the charging barrel affects the galting laser. Thanks 
---
Counts as an Energy and ballistic weapons for perks as far as I can tell. And it can do some heavy damage when used right. 
---
I prefer "Fuckers".
---
\*narrows eyes\*
---
most daily quest end if you log off, but i had to log twice during BIVs quest yesterday and it always was there when i came back.
---
I hear you, it‚Äôs just a question of scaling.... 
---
Btw, Furious on a Gauss is just about the worst legendary combo for Rifles. It could only be worse on a black powder rifle :-/
---
Anti-armor, instigating, or if you are a low health build, Bloodied(if you are a low health build, bloodied is basically always the answer!).
---
Best would be Instigating, but anti armor isn‚Äôt bad. I‚Äôm not a fan of two-shot after the nerf. DPS might beat out anti-armor, but the trade offs aren‚Äôt worth it for me :-/ 
---
Were in the wrong sub!!
---
Ah, so it was a different thing they patched. I guess my issue is an unfortunate side effect.
---
I dont think it would be dumb to be a team with Medic empath who uses sentinel. 
---
There is a new way. Not to spoil but it contains Nuka Cola Quantum X-01 Power Armor. But it looks different than it‚Äôs Fallout 4 counterparts.
---
I'm not a PvPer, I have shot 1 person and they were wanted and naked and asking to be shot.
---
That being said, the game is actually written to *allow* PvP, with some controls (albeit meager ones) to *not* PvP when you don't want to.  If  you're not opting out of it, PvP is a game mechanic that's there on purpose.  Shaming people for using *intended* mechanics of the game is silly and not at all comparable to duping.
---
I get that you don't want PvP to be something you have to deal with (and I'm on your side there), and I too hope PvP will be largely relegated to the PvP servers, but your argument is a bit flawed.
---
 I concur, at level 88 I looted a Furious Gauss, and it is my Schorchbeast Blaster, but it is a kind of vexing weapon, because of a the boxes it checks in its existence.
---
All depends on which rifle you are using. A hard hitter like the hunting rifle or lever will be good with instigating. Two shot and explosive is basically flat damage and always golden. The Two shot has some serious accuracy issues and troublesome in VATS.
---
Vampire is great on shotguns. Never tried on a rifle, but I would expect it to be decent on a handmade or combat as you will be landing many shots fast. 
---
Furious I believe to be bugged and very random to say the least. 
---
Executioners should be good as well, as its flat damage beyond a point. 
---
Could not agree more on the bloodied aversion, btw :-)
---
You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink. You have all of the tools to have fun but the problem most people have with getting burned out is thatbl they follow in the footsteps of other Players. Nuke Whitespring, collect Legendary, max Caps, God build. What next? Become less dependant on the 'meta' and just play the Game. Explore, adventure, aspire, create, help others. What I'm saying is - for anyone feeling burned out - reading this, take the road less travelled.
---
Good way to lose your client base. 
---
The thing is, right now the meta that a lot of players are doing are pretty identical. It‚Äôs boring. It‚Äôs mostly Bethesda‚Äôs fault for not knowing how to do a pvp game like this. Personally I am having more fun by going for a build that I chose and I enjoy. I‚Äôm sure by the time I‚Äôm done optimizing it, it will be pretty close to what a lot of people here do. But it‚Äôs more fun getting there by myself. 
---
Bad as for an answer. Something like vampirism may be better for something with a higher rate of fire for more frequent healing. Instigating is really good for a semi-Auto rifleman because those shots pack more punch per shot, and it only effects the first shot. 
---
Yes ..banned
---
.
---
jk I have no clue
---
Not gonna say yer wrong but im partial to my t51 armor. Its my go to for every thing
---
Ok it‚Äôs good, don‚Äôt have the caps anyway
---
ooh nuka cola dark. With nuka nut it gives you +3 strength, good for a little extra oomph to your melee build 
---
I would love to have that
---
No I put them in my character ivintory and I cant log in at all due to the glitch since last night.
---
I agree with everything you say. And i find it hilarious people are so butt hurt by "being griefed" that they have jumped all over this post....effectively griefing you. Hypocrites.
---
That's good feedback. Hadn't even thought about AA as an option.
---
I died so many times in there I almost rage quit but couldn't let those damn turrets get the best of me. I'm sure my team was ready to mute me by the time I even got halfway through there. 
---
If I remember have to within 50 meters of the center best bet is have a buddy nuke your camp directly
---
they made the same kind of mistake with targeting HUD, the spell applies to everyone in range instead of just you
---
It bothers me most that applying passive mode makes the victim vulnerable and requires either taking the bullying/abuse and hope you get your junk stored in time, or changing servers.
---
The burden is on the victim, and the bully is being given the upper hand. How does anyone think this is logical?
---
How not?  You ran up on players unprovoked and bombed their base.  They were obviously 3 teams and some of them tried to defend themselves so they all came into PVP with you.  After you killed them all, they told you to go away and that they weren't interested in PVP (and probably never had been).  Some of them may have even been in pacifist mode.
---
That's the definition of griefing.  
---
The only reason they didn't server hop is because it's hard to get 12 friends onto the same server.
---
Sorry dude, you're part of the problem.
---
Yeah it's pretty telling that these days I'll see a max of maybe 2 workshops owned by someone in any server I'm on. They just aren't worth the effort anymore since the original nerf. 
---
These people would have cried at some of the drop rates for shit in old school WoW
---
Or on a cliff face, laying beside a bunch of empty liquor bottles and staring out at a mushroom cloud.
---
If you are 2-shoting mobs, then instigating is probably best as this will make you one shot things more. 
---
TS and AA are probably equal in value as they net you a roughly 27-28% increase in damage (if you use TS correctly).
---
Furious works best of rapid fire weapons that do less damage per round as this lets you get the max benefit before the mob dies.
---
I have a Furious Lever Action, as long as you can get consecutive hits on mobs, the stacking damage is good for SB's and queens. Most regular mobs die before I can get the damage stacked high enough to make a difference, so an instigating or TS may be better in that case. 
---
I only *hope* to come across an AA Lever Action.
---
Great idea! I'd like to see more living off the land, like in unreal world. Scavenging is a good way to get started, but eventually any survivor would move to self sufficiency.
---
The dailies I lost were not of my choosing, disconnected from server was the cause of them and that's frustrating at best when your trying for certain things that take months to collect enough tokens for. If a quest is in my list it should stay there regardless of whether I log out or get disconnected.
---
i want coffee and doughnut crafting back now!!!!
---
What‚Äôs quite about the place?  Is it quite quiet?
---
So the gatling plasma is in theory the best?
---
Mostly corrections about the translations into other languages... so nothing special for the english speaking players. sry bro.
---
Pretty sure this gun counts as a rifle and therefore benefits from rifle perks. 
---
Interesting point, may be an exploit in there.
---
I place a couple pieces of wood floors down and put the big canopy tent down and chill in certain spots
---
Do you have blueprints or anything in your "Stored" tab? If that's full your budget will be full
---
Did you check the Stored tab, or Blueprints? If there's anything in those, scrap it all. Otherwise I have no idea, sorry. 
---
&gt;Counts as an Energy and ballistic weapon
---
Yup, a  Energy and ballistic weapon, but did not get a re buff of 10% in the new energy fix in patch 7, to bad, they nerfe'd it to much :/
---
Keyword is "paired".  That means you need another keycard.
---
bad spelling on my part will fix.
---
Well first, who says I watched the video? 
---
Second, the argument you are using against me, You don't have too...also applies to the OP. He didn't have to do this. Only I was a lot more dipolatic, in that I didn't tell the OP he was wrong, or whatever. I said, I wish people wouldn't do this, when they basically datamined the answer. So I'm being very specific about the method, and more so, that I don't like it. There's no judgment about what kind of person they are. 
---
So if you are going to the "You don't have too" then it applies just as equally to the OP. 
---
The way he did it was like looking over the DM's screen when the DM goes to the bathroom and reading his notes. You can make all kinds of arguments about how the DM should have taken better care not to have his adventure spoiled. But it's not unreasonable to think that he should be able to go to the bathroom without a player cheating. 
---
If you were a DM, I'm sure you would be upset that someone basically spoiled your hard work. 
---
Or giving spoilers to entertainment, like shows, movies and books. Just about everyone freaks out over spoilers. 
---
Here's another thing. You don't have to understand why it was an issue. But for me, I work in a creative field. I work in sci-fi/fantasy publishing as an artist. I get access to a lot of things before they go public. I also make my own things, stories, comics, and books. 
---
I know that part of the joy of creating, is seeing the audience experience and discover things for themselves. That feeling is something most creators have as part of the reason we create. So I sympathize for any person or company that has things told, in this manner. He didn't work it out for himself. 
---
I don't know if that's something you might get from my explanation, because as a creator, it's part thought, part feeling, part empathy, so it's not something that is definable just in words alone. 
---
Every heavy weapon work like that. Minigun, gatling laser, gatling plasma, they all have to wind up before firing
---
Nope. Please read my edit where i explain why my playstyle is not greifing and you are incorrect. 
---
Im happy to challenge the incorrect notion this community has for the definition of greifing. 
---
it's also like 5 feet long lmao
---
What game is CA? 
---
Maybe because I haven't played since last year, but I played all day yesterday. It still had a couple of hiccups here and there but compared to release it's a much more enjoyable experience.
---
Flagging both the attacker and defender for PVP when a workshop is contested made sense back when workshops could only be contested from within a tiny area around the control panel, but now that workshops can be contested from anywhere within the entire workshop area, the mechanics completely favor the attacker.
---
But addressing this doesn't require more complicated rules. Just change it so that contesting the workshop only flags the attacker for PVP‚Äîthe equivalent of slapping the defender. The defender could choose to slap back to defend their workshop, or ignore and allow the attacker to take over the workshop. This would allow all PVP to follow the same, consistent set of rules, instead of having another, completely different set of rules for workshops.

Start looking for clues in the Mire where something that should have been aloft has now been quite grounded.
---
Bonus: search everywhere around it.
---
Yup, was a 3 pot a day drinker till I found out the damage it did to my heart, had to bite the bullet and drop to one cup a day if I wanted to see a birthday past 50. So far so good, 50 is only a few months away and I'm used to just one a day now.
---
There's Beckwith Farm just up the hill from Pleasant Valley Station. I seem to remember there being some crop rows there but it's been a few months since I've been there.
---
There are upright basses already.
---
Yeah and if you kill them once to defend yourself they will report you and get you banned
---
It‚Äôs continually been getting better. Though waiting a bit longer might not be a bad idea. Maybe until they put out a bit more content. The Nukashine content is cool but it‚Äôs a very short quest. 
---
I do wonder if the 'Wastelanders' content will introduce some human NPCs? Either way, I don't mind that the game doesn't have them right now, its always been billed as a game that will grow over time, and I do think we will see them and perhaps even dialogue choices as time goes on.
---
Robbing a bank is illegal. PvP is not.
---
I can one shot level 91 deathclaws with it, so I don't think it was nerfed that much. Though I am a sniper build. 
---
Here hoping fellow wastelander, it would be nice to know that I actually saved someone and not find them dead.
---
The difference between right and wrong is not a legality. It is a question of morals
---
Stubborn. Wait until PVE servers come out in a year
---
if you are talking about yesterday's daily objective, it was about landing vats critical hit. not a sneak attack
---
Since the new update I've pretty much solely relied on alcohol for water.  Just like real life.  
---
Yeah after I made this post I went around to all of the marked farms. I'm thinking either there, one of the Toxic Valley farms, or Mac's Farm in Cranberry Bog even though it doesn't have any tilled spots.
---
Don't have any of those in stock..
---
Part of the problem? What problem, there are raiders in fallout, you can roleplay as one, there's even a perk card for camp destruction and legendary rolls for killing players. People like you are the problem, always wanting their hands to be held in a game that has PvP. Go cry more to Bethesda because someone hurt you in a game with a mechanic that was already intended
---
Sounds well thought out. I like that it also takes a bit of crafting so its not just heres a pole catch fish forever. Be cool to see variations of actual native fish from WV and have certain ones in specific water spots. Could have a quest along with it to tour various fishing spots across the map to catch specific types of fish
---
I like the warden too
---
Why do you get all the fun? I just ended up underneath a house in the forest. I WANT MY TEETH PUBES!
---
  Really? I kind of thought with the amount of damage the Gauss does, I'm a rifle build anyway, that the furious works great! Sure the shots are slow coming, but I can honestly take a level 80 scorch down in roughly 25 to 30 shots. 
---
  Now mindful this is THE ONLY THING I USE THE GAUSS RIFLE FOR... I'm lvl 103 and I, hand to God, havent come across a SINGLE bloodied drop.  Any 3 star weapons I've acquired, even remotely worth their salt, have been given to me by lol 200+ players who just enjoy my company, lol...
---
  I feel stupid now....
---
Yea they're kind of meh, I was disappointed when I found them. They should be at least twice the size imo, which should also make them easier to move around.
---
All good points. And yeah, in the few times that I have PvP, I did use V.A.T.S. at least partially. I just wish it didn't give me motion sickness. I might use it more then. Also, stealth boys make the sights invisible if you ADS, which just causes more reliance on V.A.T.S. 
---
Whenever they are done. We honestly
---
Don‚Äôt know
---
Note to self, need to rename my gauss rifle "Reason".
---
To bad the glass is so frosted over
---
We've all been told, but it came with a message not to tell you. 
---
There are tons of FO4 databases already. FO76 uses a lot of the same numbers and stats. Try searching for what you're looking for that way. 
---
Well considering vampiric only works when you hit things with it, yes
---
Creative Assembly, they're behind the Total War series. Total War Warhammer, in particular, has had many glitches and still does, some even being game breaking. The only time those are fixed is when new factions/Legendary Lords are released. The only problem is that those patches bring in new bugs and glitches that won't get fixed until the next DLC drop. It's a never-ending cycle of unfixed problems.
---
I had two instant explode, and two did not explode at all.  I use a stimpack before the final hit, then walk away in slow motion like im in a movie
---
Vampire is good for high rate of fire weapons, it'll help make you tanky.

If you're on PC, also install the text chat mod.

Well, unless they want to anger an entire culture they have to include donuts in Fasnacht, it's the main part of the feast each year and the doughnut is even named [Fasnacht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasnacht_\(doughnut\))

It's a hotfix, give it a few hours.
---
Corn/carrot soups
---
I grow them in my CAMP.
---
Corn = +AP regen, amd Carrot = +PER. Quick and easy bonuses that give food and water.
---
Or just do what I do now....Block the douche who wants to pick a fight on someone way lower than them....and server hop. 
---
Hey! with vampire effect you heal when you hit something, so yes, it'll work in combat. :)
---
Shhh you're not suppose to tell him that either.

According to date stamps in the game file, the keycards appear to have been there since Jan, but the secret door was put there just this past patch.

---
My username is Kennymj
---
i agree, i started only  2 months ago about and ive had nothing but positive stuff to say, the real problems i had were when the dupers were making the servers unstable, but since the purge ive had no disconnects for a long time, until this last patch
---
unfortunately since the last patch i have noticed more server instability
---
damn man, no need for personal attacks. is something wrong with your life?but again thanks for just straight dropping a spoiler and ruining the mystery
---
I‚Äôm on corn soup. Easy to grow lots of corn. Love the ap regen....
---
Are you on ps4 ?
---
because the servers are down right now, silly.
---
Anything I might be interested in, maybe a good 2/3* two handed melee weapon?
---
You do understand that you were the only one having fun, right?  The others weren't and not because they lost.  You ruined their night.
---
Let's leave it at that, but forcing PVP against those who do not wish it is griefing, even if it is an allowable game mechanic.
---
Marsupial was how I found it, I didn't even know about the roof access until I was in the room.  But you can hop around the wall on the I-beams jutting out which is a bit easier probably.
---
nope, it's pretty much a rail gun that shoots bullets (2mm bullets) no energy involved other than speeding up the bullet through the coils
---
PM‚Äôd ign. Will come to you when the game is back.
---
I did and the said it was a known I issue. Here's hoping for the best that the hot fix fixes it lol.
---
Should i consider it morraly wrong to kill people in other videogames too?
---
Games that allow me to do so and incentivise it with mechanics that reward me for doing so. 
---
I guess im going to hell for all those years playing mortal kombat... 
---
This really is just a cosmetic change
---
Yes
---
They're cold fixing their game they broke a little bit with the latest patch because quality has died in BGS for quantity.  Failure to do a basic spell check on most of their officially released statements including patch notes would be a good indicator that they'll probably also use incorrect terminology ('exploit' instead of 'bug') at some point down the road.
---
This is one of them.
---
If you work in IT and your boss tells you to perform a hotfix on a server error that shouldn't be there, chances are if you shut down that server, you're going to get reprimanded if not terminated for disrupting services.  You hotfix because you can't shut it down for various reasons.
---
So this guy is legitimately correct, this isn't a hotfix unless it was a quick server reboot resulting in less than a few minutes of downtime.  If the hardware is cool by the time it's brought back online, it isn't a hotfix as a general rule of thumb.
---
But who cares about proper usage of vocabulary terminology or professional jargon when you can just say whatever sounds good...
---
That is an amazing tutorial and build Idea, I like Jug just as much as Paul on Skooled Zone for the great tips on building. Would give up a nut to see them do a collaboration video.
---
yeah, for normal play it's good, i can't 1 shot a lv91 DC, but maybe 2-3 shots, it's now for me at max with 504 / 554 dmg, used to be 1600-1700.
---
I only use it as a end game weapon (SBQ) and in my opinion and meany others it's to weak now.
---
For normal gameplay i use a Handmade, really fun gun, lol
---
Purified Water.

Canned Dog Food.  Good Doggy + Rank 2 Food Perk. Gives about 45%? per 1 dog food can.  Rank 3 Can Do occasionally for trash can digging to get a stock of dog food, or a quick jog around Watoga to find a bunch of dog food on the tables.

A lot of those are at white spring furniture vendor. 
---
You need to be right at the centre of the blast, pretty much.
---
I got it when I saw someone was about to nuke Morgantown. Figuring they'd aim it at Morgantown itself, I clicked the Morgantown icon and fast travelled there. And stayed in the vicinity of my spawn until I got obliterated. (While you cannot fast travel into a blast zone once the nuke has dropped, you can when it is on the countdown).
---
If you have a friend who is dropping a nuke then maybe coordinate with them exactly where they are going to target, you then fast travel to that icon and wait.
---
I'm assuming you aim a nuke at a map marker - I've not launched one yet.
---
Reported, submitted and posted, Thanks!
---
Agreed but it's still pretty scummy to do so and it is very much something one would do if they want to bully the other person. So I would say it is bullying (you are actively doing it to make the other person miserable).
---
&gt;They just aren't worth the effort anymore since the original nerf.
---
I think the 2/19 patch made them even more worthless. Workshops can now be contested from anywhere without having to interact with the bench. 
---
This just makes them impossible to defend against griefers. 
---
They never really produced much to begin with.   The were really just an added bonus to whatever you were able to scavenge out in the world. 
---
But  frequent attacks by NPC enemies alone make them  real pain in the ass already.  Adding in  attacks by other players who are heavily spec'd into PVP builds makes them basically worthless.

Thank you kind sir.

Was looking for post with this perfect news.
---
Play on bruh
---
I think the plane crash is technically supposed to be the first stop.  Though you could make the argument of Lewis from frat = Nuka Cola = "Hey, what's going on there?"  There's even a tidbit about him there if you look hard enough.
---
Yay!!

---
If the servers have to go down it's not a hotfix. 
---
That‚Äôs a nice change.  Before they only exploded when I thought they were actually not going to explode so I went over to look.
---
You could make a 5 minute fail video of me being tricked by legendary bot explosions.  Gets my impatient ass every time.
---
I can offer a second pair of eyes through share play and see if I can help ?
---
It's so fun to black out and wake up as part of a crazy scene, not knowing where I am or what I did to get there.
---
I think they did a great job with that part 
---
Jug is on PS4 not to many big builders on there unfortunately.
---
Good 
---
Wasn't able to replicate, if you manage to grab a video of it let me know!
---
damn that was fast, well back to streaming.
---
Bloodied can be played at a health greater than 10-20% of max. you get a 5% damage boost for every 5% hp loss. Thus bloodied breaks even with TS and AA at around 70% of max health. I am not sure about you but I can end up running around at that level quite a lot.
---
If you want the feel of bloodied without feeling the need to alter your play style, you can grab Adrenal Reaction mutation. This will give you an extra boost of damage when your in an oh shit moment without making you feel like you HAVE to play with low health.

Either they caught you for duping, or the server is offline for a hotfix. You may not have noticed it, but there was also a message stating that the server is offline for a hotfix. 
---
Can confirm though not 100% consistent, some bodies legitimately flew into orbit I'm guessing lol
---
Oh you guys 
---
Are you still getting "LOOKUP FAILED!" errors?
---
It's well played by Bethesda. If they hadn't and they added the brewing stations forcing people with full budgets to eliminate parts of their camp to accommodate the new stuff, it would have been a problem. Nice to see them getting in front of this.  
---
Magazine Rack can show up (randomly) at Phoenix.  Both the wooden peg board looking one, and the spinning wire rack.
---
Quite a number of CAMP plans are still on a rotating/rng appearance at vendors.
---
All those elegant and fancy looking things are sold by the furniture vendor inside Whitespring.  Elegant and Resort options.  I think all of the Resort plans are pricey.  About 930 caps each with 3 Chr, Grape Mentats, and Hard Bargain 3.
---
I have a vampire gatling laser I can take on 6 or so gutsy at once (till reload)
---
Carnivore mutation and carrying 100+ Boiled Water with Thru-Hiker perk.
---
I used to hate how Mole Rats. Now I see them as Fast food that comes to me! And Glowing Mole Rats are like the Large Size Meal!
---
Players have both the tools and intelligence to level a base multiple times over in a fraction of the time it would take an NPC to do it. 
---
It‚Äôs one thing to know a legendary death claw wandered into your domain and just did what deathclaws do, and took at a few of your walls a purifier and some defenses before dying to your turrets out of its reach or you.
---
It‚Äôs another to know a player, an actual person, with malicious intent, went to your camp, dropped a mininuke on it and then left leaving you with literally nothing, or prioritized your most expensive equipment to repair (like rad showers) and is currently waiting for you to come back, and put it together so they can tear it apart again, for no other reason to get under your skin and waste your resources and time when you are just trying to casually enjoy the game.  
---
Update: the hot fix DID fix my character!!!!!
---
This is my go-to as well.  8 corn and 8 carrot plants keep me going a long time (with green thumb and super duper, even longer).
---
Watch spoilage though, there may be a bug with fermenters that increases spoilage rates, though I haven't seen it yet.
---
Do you have any serums?? 
---
The poster is there, if you bought it. Scroll through all available posters. 
---
I think it was probably solely intended to make room for people to add the new stations, maybe some crops for brewing, rather than a real QOL budget increase. In either event, it's fine I think. 
---
This is Madness. I know what I'm doing when I get off work.
---
because NPC follow set game rules
---
players do everything in their power to break said rules and to make the encounter as unfair as possible
---
a better way of looking at it would be to have a debuff randomly appear on your character that instakills you and your camp and the only escape is to log off 
---
Can get upto 2k damage stacking damage bonuses.... that and I have an instigating one so my first shot is 516 damage x2.30 for stealth. and can stack weakpoint hits. Like headshots for another 2x. OR a vats weak point hit to add more. 
---
&gt; Whats the difference between raiders and griefers? 
---
"Raiders" are just what Griefers want to call themselves when trolling others.  :)
---
I don't need my hand held because there is literally nothing you can do to hurt me.  If you manage to destroy my camp, I'll simply rebuild it and have some room in my stash box.  You won't get any caps off me because you can't kill me and if you did you wouldn't get any junk.
---
I don't need to cry to Bethesda because I'll just server hop, but they likely couldn't because you can't find 12 slots on one world easily.
---
The dropping Dead is a old bug, still one of those weird ones, as for the respawns some of us think they did a hard core "Stealth Nerf" to the Club House and a few other spots.  
---
Only way I could force respawns was to have everyone leave the Cell (all of WhiteSprings) and then Fast Travel in.
---
I hope so I'm specd all the way in on rifle so...  Thats why I became curious.  Plus I'm too lazy to expiriment with swapping cards and writing down damage output. Pssssshttt, I'll ask reddit.
---
I've mentioned this before but I'll say it again because it's so good.
---
If you use the carnivore mutation with the cannibal perk then you don't get disease from your "dinner". If you also use lead belly 3 then you eliminate rads from food and water. When you use this 4 END combo then you don't even need to carry food or water. 
---
Stay north / northwest / west on map.  
---
Servers are up, on PC at least.
---
Top of the world is in savage divide which is the third highest level region. I‚Äôd suggest leveling more. SW is the highest level region so don‚Äôt go there. 
---
Raider = roleplay
---
Griefer = someone who enjoys using game mechanics to harass
---
I don't think Raiders screamed obscenities about another peoples mom into a microphone. That is the only thing I can think of. 
---
iv had a few pieces of cavalier dropped by legendaries. just sayin..and i dont see any reason why bethesda would nerf or delete it..cavalier is not that great..neither is sentinel..i have a full set of sentinel and still get my ass handed to me in pvp
---
I was thinking if you go into the menu and turn pacifist off while another player is trying to take a workshop than pacifist greys out until the workshop dispute has ended.  I think if the defending team commits to defending the workshop they shouldnt be able to turn invulnerability back on when the battle starts to not go their way.  Though, I dont want to create the scenario where "raiders" know once someone disengages pacifist they've got a solid 10min to grief that someone and/or destroy their CAMP.
---
I recommend staying in the forest, maybe go down to Ash Heap(Firebreather quest will take you there) and after that Toxic Valley(A few quests there) before you venture into the savage divide. 
---
Ban message is 4:8:2000. This is different, it's for server outage.
---
No. The game was planned to always be adding and continuing the story past collecting nuke codes fighting the SQB.
---
That was said before the game came out, its been said since. And in the road map they even said how they plan to continue the story to the main story line.
---
So objectively, a game that is designed, from the start, to build on and grow and have the story continue, doesn‚Äôt really have an endgame. 
---
r/nocontext
---
Datamining is the ultimate form of spoiler. The person that legit figures this out in game just had their thunder stolen
---
Yes. I was going to mention wild wasteland. Personally I really enjoyed it, but I know there are others that despised it.
---
u/chally
---
It for sure will. This is a game with a player population that howled like they'd been stabbed in the gut when Bethesda tried to limit them to a mere 1500 lbs of excess weight. Imagine if those bizarre hoarders could place whatever they wanted around their camp with no limit. The servers would collapse into black holes. 
---
You can also just go past the frat house and the quest will trigger. 
---
I had been in the mire and was headed toward grafton and just happened to pass near it. 
---
yup, the x 2.5 is nice, but a bit hard to do in a SBQ fight :/
---
It never kicks in...
---
 Normally I could craft enough at once for a couple sessions, but they completely decayed after 3 hours last night. I'll just have to hop back to my base more frequently.
---
&gt;This account has been suspended
---
Oh..
---
To be honest, I don't think there's any indication where that terminal is, so here's some progressive hints to flat out location.
---
Low: &gt;!It's a map location, icon is a big house.!&lt;
---
Mediumish: &gt;!It's nearish the frat house.!&lt;
---
SUPER-HIGH(It's here):&gt;!Ingram's Mansion!&lt;
---
Oh I like this idea :)
---
Or maybe you could, like, use your brain?  12 people.  They aren't there to PVP.  They're there to do something else.
---
And how would a raider roleplay in this game in your opinion? What did you think raiders in fallout lore did?
---
I'm not silly. None of it matters if the servers are down. I want to know why selling to a vendor is not possible in game.
---
Np, I know some people do that if you hit them a few times they‚Äôll fight back, but if they continue to run or something they aren‚Äôt interested.
---
One of the things I like about 76 is that there are these very real elements that are outside of my control... it makes the wasteland experience more 'real' and visceral to me.  I loved every fallout game, but for the most part you could 'control' the environment very easily...for me unwanted griefing is more realistic to what would actually happen and although it can be frustrating I think it would be a huge shame if it was ever removed... 
---
Two randoms hopped in my discord channel, asked if we knew anything, and mentioned "some guy on reddit giving the bear minimum clues". I was salty for an hour until I realized how much fun I was having hunting for clues.
---
Thanks for making my night just a little bit better.
---
I really hope they adjusted the spoil rates.  10 minutes time, no fast travelling, and freshly harvested Corn, Berries, and Razorgrain was at almost 60% CND.
---
Yes they do. The few Games a Service im currently playing do this.
---
What's your IGN?   
---
&lt;Zipppppp&gt;
---
Servers are back online
---
yeah, sorry, my answer was a bit misleading, but what i meant was that when you meat a group of 2-4 players in a team ant they all have the same "best" armor, and the all are running low health.. lol
---
Certain quests do have level requirements. Eg. Miner Miracles needs you to be level 25.
---
I found a vampires explosive minigun for sale at whitesprings the other day, i was wondering why the hell anyone would sell it just days before the heavy weapon patch too
---
Very likely you have everything in your stored tab.  It's built, but not deployed.  
---
chameleon +full weightless wood armor with the stealth mods. You can't be detected so it kicks in for every shot. 
---
Note to self, rename my gauss rifle 'Treason'. &lt;-&lt;
---
Hope you bought it
---
I have 12 people at my camp sometimes...
---
My PvP gang. We love it when another gang raids us at my camp.. Its a treat!
---
Maintenance is finished!
---
I was on for more than 3 hours last night and saw 0 (or nearly 0) decay on my corn soup.  Had lots of server hops as well.
---
I've heard 1) speed demon might be affecting it (though not sure which way), 2) Good with Salt may be making more of a difference than before, and 3) fermenters are spoiling food somehow.  Other things are possible too I suppose.
---
After thought somebody trying to move gear between toons
---
I did buy it immediatly yes
---
Caps? What costs caps?
---
Right?
---
Raiders attack a workshop to get the resources, griefers one shot workshop owners then server hop without even claiming it when the owner blocks them for session. 
---
This game needs fishing so bad
---
Yeah I get that people were breaking the existing system by making it physically impossible to reach the workbench, but they went way too far with that "fix." It's now completely pointless to build any defenses at all, and the only incentive to do workshops is if you actually Want to do PvP. 
---
Change all your walls surrounding the stairs into doors. It'll let you delete the staircase.
---
Sure you do, champ.  
---
Before we had the choice of either a functional OR fun camp. Now we can both. This is fantastic :)
---
I was willing to give flat out spoilers if anyone didn't want to do the puzzle and asked, nobody bothered asking though, lol.
---
The issue is that the clues themselves do not provide a "legit" way of solving this other than sheer luck.
---
Clue 1 provides the location of 2 key cards. 
---
From those 2 key cards you have no hints to take you to Clue 2, so your immediately stopped after the 2 key cards unless you just stumble upon the second clue which is at a completely different area of the map.
---
yes i agree that a lot of it is duped.
---
Well its mine now so whoever sold that gun to a vendor for a pittence, im sorry for your loss, although knowing this game that was probably someones trash gun that they wanted to get rid of 
---
Ok thank you you just made my day 
---
Don't fast travel unless you have to in order to participate in an event. You'll enjoy the game much more if you explore and discover all the stuff that the folks who are only interested in caps and server hopping miss. 
---
Ant meat beer gives +50 carry weight. Pretty decent if not very situational
---
I haven't rebuilt my base in a while, but if you make an attached platform and a second set of stairs to it, sometimes you can get the first one to scrap. Just make sure to remove them in the exact opposite order of how you placed them after.
---
Also, I never use the stairs with the attached platform, that seemed to bug out everytime.
---
Someone complained because that was the only way to get the alien blaster, once. WHAT KIND OF WEAPON IS THE ALIEN BLASTER? Seems like it's the silly kind, ha
---
Mistress of mysteries rewards can only be used at level 25
---
Gauss Rifle...
---
* is an energy weapon (crafting cost is affected by Science Expert 2 perk; damage is reduced by Grounded mutation)
---
* uses energy ammo (2mm EC is affected by Batteries Included perk)
---
* deals normal (ballistic) damage (damage is affected by damage resistance, not energy resistance)
---
* is a non-automatic rifle (damage is affected by Rifleman perks)
---
+karma
---
There's a perk card that makes you swing faster. I use slow melee and can usually ignore their block and get a quick hit before the next one. I think it's called martial artist. It's in my most crowded skill tree, strength. I probably wouldn't use it if it didn't make melee weapons weigh less
---
Not enough rads and impurities to make it taste good :)
---
Yeah. Nice find though
---
Yeaaaahhhh!!! While this topic is here, the idea of ANY fallout game, somehow actually considering a boxing glove, modded or nah, A LETHAL WEAPON, is absurd... 
---
hmmm..
---
I might be doing it wrong, i love my heavy combat bos armor, so i run it with 2 pices of cameleon bit's and 2 vanguard legs and dens bos chest.
---
so, that is not a good mix ? what can i do to make it better, without having to switch from heavy combat? :)
---
Agreed. I would like to role play a character as a raider eventually, but I don't want to be labeled as a griefer. I don't want people to report me because they think I'm harassing them. I don't want witch hunts because someone got mad they died. 
---
Lol this is intended and Bethesdas crappy solution for preventing flying camps.
---
It's a real pain in the ass and disables many cool camp building ideas.
---
Hope they will improve this mess anytime.
---
raiders dont run a bloodied unyielding sentinel assassin cavalier etc etc build..they wear raider armor lol
---
Thanks I'll test the  long recon scope tonight when I get a chance
---
Besides take advantage of bitter young girls who have mommy issues?
---
"Griefer" can mean different things to different people.  Commonly it seems that anyone attempting to PvP gets labeled a griefer. 
---
Raiders don't give a fuck what you call them. 
---
What do you think raiders are? They're scum in the lore.. Being a scummy raider is an option in this game, there are no rules in the wasteland, not everyone is your friend
---
Yikes.
---
If only they let you use purified water with different salts for the water chemistry, along with different crops for different flavors. I'd love to make a mutfruit sour. 
---
Get a friend to launch one at a specific marked location while you sit on the roof of that location
---
I would just like Workshop PVP to be constrained to the workshop area itself.  If you aren't there to defend it, you lose it.  But the person shouldn't be able to just hunt you down on the other side of the map while you are in some cave.  Once the person is no longer in the workshop area they cannot PVP you penalty free (and vice versa).
---
Oof, I deeply regret your loss, but I'm glad your change in lifestyle has been positive for you!  I'm still pretty young (only almost 30) so I'll keep drinking way too much until it becomes a pressing concern, lol.
---
I'm not having issues but I harvest 20 corn, and make 20 soup as soon as I log on every day. Lasts me a few hours
---
There are some maps out there that show the level range things spawn at. I find it pretty useful. I can also give you some tips on leveling up if you want. 
---
Does repainting power armor remove mods?
---
But store all the hard to replace junk like ballistic fiber, screws, adhesive, ultracite, and so on. 
---
Basically, expect that someone will take your junk when you die, so store any junk that you'd miss. 
---
Heavy combat is the worst armor for stealth. the lower the weight the better the armor is for stealth as armor weight makes it harder. for every 10 LB of armor you are effectively loosing around 5% of your stealth ability.  
---
Leather, wood, and ultralight marine are all pretty good for stealth. Wood is the best for pure stealth, leather is the best midground, and marine the best for protection.  
---
All of those require weightless though but wood is the best over all. When going for stealth your objective is to not get hit at all which means your armor is a last resort so you don't need the heavy stuff. 
---
It's like everyone wants to hold hands in the wasteland. Raiders did some of the most fucked up shit, the perks and legendary rolls are their for raiding so Bethesda expected them to be roleplayed by players. 
---
Heya! Thanks for the report. We're looking into this and will work to address it in a future update. 
---
No. Just cause you can, doesn't mean you should. But I'm not here to change your mind, only here to inform
---
Documented and submitted, also PM'ed a Community manager to see if we can get an answer on it
---
 Is it lonely up there on your pedestal? Lol j/k, are you perhaps in the market for a sweet used lvl 35 wood right arm? No?!?   What if I told you it was LIFE SAVING?!?!  HUH?!?! 
---
... I'll be gathering my things and going now...
---
I don't understand why this flags you for pvp across the map like that. It should only be pvp within the workshop area. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
Fo sho...how dare you dupe!
---
Hmmm.... might need to do some re thinking, thanks for the very nice tips :)
---
If I go play Black Ops 4 and get upset for being killed when all I really want to do is stand in the corner and wear cool outfirs, is it griefing?
---
I agree with everything you said and struggle to understand why people get so heated about this sort of thing. The game was designed with player interactions AND combat in mind so I'm honestly amazed at how civil people are in game. I personally have never felt "griefed" in this game and, while I understand that it's totally subjective, I often find myself feeling apathetic about players being griefed because someone followed them for 30 seconds and were clearly a trying to use the trade exploit, for example. 
---
Perhaps it's because this game drew a large crowd that aren't used to multiplayer sandbox-style games? Again, I'm honestly amazed how friendly and civil everyone is in this game. 
---
I mean, the game mechanics are there, why cant you be a scummy raider and fuck up wastelanders? Not everyone is your friend
---

Oh, you!

I'm that power armor guy you just described lol. It always cracks me up when I see someone playing a stealth build, being super careful and sneaky, and here I come, sprinting past them with speed demon, dead man sprinting, and , running and gunning through everything. I usually at least wave if I see the other person (can't see name tags if they're stealthed, and I've definitely ran past people and not known it before). I almost never seek out pvp, but if someone tags me, I'm more than happy to pull out my bloody explosive harpoon gun and one shot them.
---
I only get wooden leg and stalkers walking cane from AWOL now, valued at less than 20 caps. Round trip cost me 40+. Essentially no rewards from events no matter how many ‚Äòstars‚Äô the boss‚Äô tag shows. So I only farm ghouls at ws now. Thank you Bethesda for making it easy for us. 
---
It shouldn't be costing any caps.
---
I think he was trying to move around his camp.
---
The Alien Blaster gained a whopping 3 damage points, woo... ... ...
---
Fix it already! &gt;:(
---
I've found that you have to delete stuff in a specific order.
---
I'm going all in on this. I just need to level up my 3 lead belly cards and it's done. 
---
Do you know if you have to cook the meat to get the stat and carry weight buffs?
---
good bot
---
I was sort of annoyed that the new locations were put on the compass as undiscovered locations... I was like "Wait, I missed places in Morgantown?" and went to check them before the quest, so the little riddle you're supposed to follow was entirely pointless.
---
Yeah - that was a little harsher than I thought it would be. Maybe a spoiler tag....
---
It could be timing related, regarding respawns some of us think it's a Stealth nerf.  
---
With Extensive Testing the only way we could get some locations to respawn is when it was completely empty (WhiteSprings entirely) and then have a new player fast travel in.
---
No, once you‚Äôve placed down the C.A.M.P. through the Pip-Boy the green field is locked in place along with anything you build inside of it. You can move the physical C.A.M.P. Object anyway inside that space.
---
I dont run those except assassin's, i get killed a lot when i get wanted but it's part of the game, fucking up people and being fucked up are thrilling experiences. 
---
The stairs with a floor have issues.  When you build one it cannot be scrapped unless nothing is touching the sides.  If you attach a floor to it, that floor is supported, but weakly, so if you snap another stair anywhere along the floor, that new stair becomes the support.  The stair can't be deleted until the original stairs and then the floor are deleted, but remember what I said about not being able to delete the stairs if they touch anything?  So you need to support the floor further out and then delete the one that touches the 1x2 stair.  THEN you can delete the 1x2 stair and get rid of the rest.
---
great idea
---
Yeah I hope so. Also they need to turn his volume up. 
---
Yes this worked.  Not sure why I didnt think of this...
---
There would have to be some sort of "hysteresis" setup.  Once inside the boarder and initiated, you have to travel farther away from the workshop than just the boarder to "leave" the PVP.  This would stop players from exploiting a boarder to step in/out of and avoid damage.
---
Something like... Run 100+ Feet away from the boarder, it turns off, but you have to go all the way back into the workshop boarder and recontest to be back in PVP mode.  And both players have to be inside of the workshop boarder to initiate it at the start.
---
Where did you find the plan for neon letters?
---
As far as I can tell from the holotapes, they mostly ended up murdering each other. Would be nice.
---
I still disagree. Nothing wrong with what i do.
---
Especially since you can just server hop. You are opting out of intended game features therefor the burden is on you to leave the server.
---
Hahaha!!!
---
I do actually, and I curse the stacking god rays soon after/before that blind me from seeing five meters in front of me lol
---
I heard Nuka-Cola Dark benefits from both party boy and cola nut. If you have both maxed out that‚Äôs +6 strength and endurance. I wouldn‚Äôt call that pointless. 
---
I would think that if they had starched genes it would not remove mutation - but if they didn't it would have the same chance as any other radaway dose :-)  
---
When my camp was beside the river west of the forest, when I would log in to the game, waiting for assets to render during those first 1-2 seconds I distinctly remember a fish swimming around. It looked like it was flying as the water hadn't rendered in. As soon as the water popped they were then very difficult to see because of the reflections on the water surface.
---
Fish already in game: check!
---
Fishing rods already in game: check!
---
Fishing mechanic: (how difficult would this be?)
---
Legendary knives work great against ONE opponent. Get one with improved swing speed and it just sort of locks them in place. And the various Rippers/Buzz Blades/Drills/Chainsaws work in similar fashion. Where it falls apart a bit is when you are facing several melee opponents (i.e. lots of Glowing Ghouls or 3+ level 68 mutants with hammers) That's where the big two handed axes come into their own. (and the instigating legendary if possible). I don't even spec into melee (HW Build), but with Adrenaline \*\*\*\*\* + Bloody mess \*\*\* + Tenderizer \*\*\* I'm still one or two shotting most high level mobs with my axe. Particularly if I drop a couple of their buddies on the way in with a Gatling first. (Adrenaline rules). 
---
One tip I think may help with two handed weapons against mutants is to time your swing a bit farther away from them than normal as you move forward. Seems to catch them off guard, whereas standing toe to toe they block more often. Use the edges of the melee range.
---
So it isnt greifing then!
---
The formula is this...
---
((Base Damage/Resistance) ^ 0.366)*0.5 = Reduction Multiplier
---
Base Damage * Reduction Multiplier = Final Damage
---
If you can get me the Base Damage (remove all Heavy Gunner, Bloody Mess and no Adrenal Reaction/Bloodied) and ROF with Charging Barrels for a max level gatling laser, I can calculate how the mod affects it.  No change to mag size (rounds you can fire per core) right?
---
The main thing I do is hunt other players.  The game mechanics are such that I usually won't sit there and keep hitting a player if they aren't interested in fighting,  it's a waste of time that could be spent killing more willing adversaries.
---
My "griefing " usually consists of breaking down a door or wall in order to access a player to hit them and attempt to start a fight.  
---
If they don't reciprocate  I'm just going to move on,  since it's not profitable to completely destroy someone's CAMP. 
---
It's a post-apocalyptic wasteland and I enjoy killing and being killed by other players. 
---
1 cap twice and 1 rad-x once, but it's so rare that it could also have been a delayed notification.

---
I don't know if you noticed, but most Raiders end up with a bullet in their head. At best, their equipment is comparable to yours, but is most likely inferior.
---
Griefers have no interest in an actual fight or challenge, which is why they almost uniformly roll around in the exploit-du-jour build that they know most players won't have a specific counter for.
---
It‚Äôs what, 40 caps to move?
---
Wait it's not? 
---
Like if I have a workshop,  someone can just kill me anytime? 
---
I've never really encountered an issue with people trying to kill me so I'm honestly oblivious.
---
I thought PVP only opened up when you were claiming it and or contesting
---
Okay they need to hurry the fuck up and fix the fermenter bug because I want this paint!
---
Right,  the people who don't use starched genes would be salty. I use Starched Genes but it would be maddening to the ones who choose not to Haha
---
I'm sure you'll be fine, so many people report people for pvping 
---
On PC? Want to meet us?
---
Must‚Äôve slipped my mind. Thanks for updating!
---
Raiders = part of the game.  Bethesda wanted possible confrontation between players.
---
Example:  Someone who randomly tries to take over your work shop or destroy your base.  Someone who tries to shoot and kill you to steal your junk.
---
Griefers =  Somebody who purposely goes out of their way to ruin somebody else's fun.  In other words harassment.
---
Example:  Somebody who tries to kill you over and over again without you retaliating. Someone who chases you around the map shooting mobs that you are trying to shoot.  Basically someone who tries to ruin your enjoyment of the game.
---
It was to them.  They couldn't server hop and apparently they were not running pacifist and fireproof and the like.  The fact that they said they didn't want to PVP (and were probably screaming it all along) should clue you in.
---
Also when you use any work benches or pick any lock, the animation shows you stand up. Does that mean you expose your location? Lock-picking can definitely be done while sneaking no? 
---
if they dont hit back leave them alone.
---
This is a ridiculous idea. Your character lives in a post apocalyptic world full of danger and someone attacking your camp is not instantly a griefer.
---
There are things you can do, like building far off the beaten path to minimize your risk, like you would if you actually were under threat of getting raided.
---
The second Bethesda investigates will surely show your not doing anything wrong
---
Sure go ahead, troll.
---
Ik I'm just going after workshop. Who ever thought the report feature was a good idea was pretty stupid
---
Sad, most people here are pussies who cant handle it when someone is shooting at them. Most of them wants to be friends, hold hands, kill deathclaws together. 
---
Ah, well, in that case maybe it works for your usage. I don‚Äôt know the mechanics of Furious completely, but I‚Äôve heard it stacks damage, 5% per shot, to a cap of 30%, and resets if you hit a different target. What I don‚Äôt know is how long the stacks last for (5 seconds since last hit? 2? 20?). What that means is Furious works best with high ROF, low damage weapons. For slower firing, harder hitting weapons like BPR and Gauss, typically you want to make each hit as powerful as possible, ideal getting to 1-shot territory (not realistic against SB, but still). Instigating is best for this, usually beating out most other 1st tier prefixes until you‚Äôve sent 4-5 shots down the line (a bloodied build is the exception; by shot 2 a bloodied weapon is comparable or beating out Instigating).
---
Don‚Äôt feel stupid though. The number of people I see chasing after/selling high things like Furious Super Sledges is hilarious. 
---

ERROR I'M DRUNK AND INFECTED NOW
---
Getting attacked in a post apoc game is not harrassment
---
No I go to there work shop and start claim and kill the super fast
---
Well at least its useful for people with venomous aura since they can't go near there own Brahmin without hurting it.
---
No not at all 
---
I'll add Small Letters. Picked it up at least three times from workshops.
---
You got me by the short hairs
---
So many snowflakes
---
lol..yeh im not really into.pvp but the odd occasion when i do pvp it can be a lot of fun..not when im getting constantly one shot but when its  a fair exchange it can be fun
---
Inform? Should?
---
Sounds like your lecturing me on something very subjective and you are pretending you are absolutle and correct. 
---
I firmly believe that what I do is not griefing. 
---
Heres an absolute fact: this game is designed to include my playstyle. It was absolutly intended by BGS. 
---
Think I could get that lever action for 4500caps and marsupial serum
---
Submitted and Reported, I think you have a good point, there are hundreds of reports of "Timer" related issues
---
Raiders aren‚Äôt homophobic. 
---
Shh
---
And note that you want to harass someone who has specifically stated that they are not interested in PVP and would not fight back is the epitome of griefing.  It is not "raiding".
---
I don't know what you mean. I was referring to a cannibal build. 
---
Fucking yes, i leave people alone when they keep running but my mates and i will continuously kill (and be killed) contesting workshops, hunting players make the game more fun. It's just a game with a built in mechanic that can enable that.
---
I ran into the same issue. Just following along with the story and then BAM suddenly realised I can't follow the story anymore and have to just explore the West side of the map a bit more...
---
There are some quests in those areas to follow too.
---
Also other issue is if someone higher than you is in the area first - all the mobs will be their level, so watch out for that too..
---
Which would make it all the sweeter to find organically. Instead the mystery was datamined out of the game. 
---
The fact that it was a difficult challenge was the point.
---
It is related, but not as bad. No need to be rude.
---
Yes, Vampire grants a fixed amount of HP on every successful  stab, no matter what.
---
Sounds like you have mods.
---
I absolutely agree. I'm currently *not* a raider, but I have the gears turning for my ultimate raider build. 
---
I like to do something similar on a much smaller scale. I usually look for groups of three people, high level, with one low level dude. I shoot the low level dude until his high level friends retaliate. When they do, I try to drop all of them as long as they want to go. Even people who do not like PVP will engage into it if they feel they have the advantage.
---
Last night I did this, only got 300 or so caps before they got me. After I respawned, I gave the lowest level dude a super dupered extra healing factor mutation I had lying around.
---
Who are you talking about? Why are you bullying me?
---
Saw two low level guys attacking a robot happily, taking their turns and time to make sure everyone get multiple hits on the robot to maximize their chance, very smart. After the robot collapsed the two walked over to collect their loot and stood their chatting, probably got something worthwhile. Then kaboom a massive blow and the two lied there motionlessly lol. 
---
I have never - level 200, 400ish hours of play - had this happen to me. Once, months ago, I had a pair of guys show up to my CAMP in the Bog, NNW of Watoga, one with his sledge out, the other calling them the code inspectors. Said I didn't pass because I lacked a cat poster. Searched my build menu, found a vaguely cat-like poster. Inspection passed, sledgehammer put away. Never had an encounter at CAMP since.
---
Pro tip: buy it anyway. That legendary vendor is coming soon. They said spring some time, could be months, but still. I'm saving up every 3 star I get.
---
&lt;-&lt;
---
Legit thought you were trying to be funny, I see now you're dead serious.  Dead seriously impossible to find!
---
You should play nuka world quests in FO4 üòâ
---
just read it again, my comment stands. fight or flight. The choice is yours.
---
L2P
---
Exactly
---
You know publicising a glitch is against terms of service right? Just put in a bug report 
---
Now you are just splitting hairs. Of course they plan expansion, but the base game endgame as planned was nuke zones. That was the hamster wheel we were supposed to keep turning until they added more content
---
Dog food and purified water, both hotkeyed. 
---
If no purified, then boiled. And I like sweet tato stew. I do a run by the Ag building and get firecaps, glowing mushrooms, and snaptails (for sugar). I grow tatos, corn, mutfruit, and razirgrain. I can make disease cures, radaway,  and stew. The stew gives 18% food and water.

---
Doubtful. Can‚Äôt punish you for playing how they intended. 
---
You won‚Äôt get reported for using an in game feature. 
---
It's kill or be killed in the wasteland, my good sir and everything has a counter, usually a gamma gun
---
I am blunt and direct. You on the other hand lied and blamed. Still lying btw. 
---
Various steaks, canned dog food, and corn soup, more or less in that order based on whatever I have excess of.
---
Good Doggy plus one rank of Slow Metabolizer refills about half the food meter.  I only have END 3 though, so it's a bit annoying to switch out Radicool and Vaccinated whenever I want to eat. 
---
There are a million posts here about mods messing things up. All I‚Äôm saying is do a search and see if that fixes it. It‚Äôs probably your mods. They were never officially supported anyway. 
---
Maybe Rust should be your game of choice.....
---
Despite not being at all into PVP, I can respect that. At most you're doing a couple steel and a few scraps of wood's worth of damage they can fix with the click of a button. If they don't want to fight, you move on to someone who wants the thrill of a life-or-death struggle. If that's griefing, it's definitely griefing with a small "g". You're way closer to [u/Lausee-'s definition of a raider](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b1h7c0/whats_the_difference_between_raiders_and_griefers/eiln795/).
---
Isn‚Äôt there a fight or PVP emote?  
---
I've done extensive testing on this, and am one of the people who not only ran the issue down but reported it to Bethesda in the first place, shortly after Launch.  
---
With Specific combinations I could force crash servers on demand, repeatable, I know exactly what can cause the lag and instability.  
---
You can make light of the issue or Mock it, thats fine and your choice, but I've got data to back up my point, just like the hard numbers in the post about the specifics of the perks and legendary effects reducing weight.  
---
Explaining to the community at large that X is the issue and not Y, from a technical perspective is tough, and they are choosing to address it through draconian weight limitations, which I find a little off center and would like to get addressed.
---
Maybe implement a system to mark people who abuse the report system and make their reports low priority or something.
---
Someone can just contest it, but not take it.  Then go hunt you down and kill you.  It doesn‚Äôt happen often but can be done.  
---
Not just raiders.. Look at Ceasars Legion. Slavers. Trappers. The Black Powder Gang. They were all "not nice people", it's in the lore. People need to suck it up sometimes and accept a small loss of caps and/or junk. 
---
I‚Äôve tried to find a map that does that, but I have been completely unsuccessful in finding one. I always come across ones that divide the map into regions with little to no information about what‚Äôs what, or interactive ones that don‚Äôt seem useful for me at this point. 
---
From what I have read, crafting/scraping really help leveling up. I‚Äôd like to explore the area, without getting completely annihilated by everything around me. Any tips would be awesome!!
---
A good way to differentiate them, thanks!
---
Oh okay. I thought it meant that as long as I had a workshop I can just get killed at any time for no reason.
---
&gt;HUNGER/THIRST 
---
seriously if you have speed demon and sprint it will go from 100% to 0 in about 2 minutes, worse if you have parasites impossible to keep up with.
---
Ahhh, yeah I thought I was going crazy with how much food I was going through.
---
That is really weird, first report I've seen and I bulked a ton of stuff earlier...  
---
Any Mods?  
---
Sometimes when there are changes, believe it or not the old INI edits or mods themselves can conflict.
---
There is a large difference between difficult and nearly unsolvable.
---
There is noting wrong with destroying other players camps. This is one of the the game mechanics. Anybody who doesn't want that can just uninstall the game.
---
Are they ever gonna reduce the weight of Stimpacks? I don‚Äôt think a syringe is 1 pound.
---
Gave an easy solution. Didn't state anything negative and got rated down? What a bitchfest.
---
Hah, just saw that! But thanks anyway.
---
Confusingly enough Sal's Grinder in the Ash Heap sort of references this.
---
Apparently irradiated ingredients make food taste better.
---
Wow, with some of the bullshit nitpick comments on this thread, it's no wonder Bethesda chooses it's responses carefully.  
---
Nothing demotivating like being attacked, even when making sense.  
---
Nitpick away!  
---
Signed, SMH. 
---
You don‚Äôt really get to call this an ‚Äúexpansion‚Äù. This is a single quest line and two dailies with a new craft option. 
---
I mean honestly this was supposed to be an MMO, yet you lack basic MMO-needed items and options. And to call this an ‚Äúexpansion‚Äù is misleading... fuck I‚Äôd even pay for a decent expansion, but this is nothing more than like when other MMOs launch a seasonal quest for free. 
---
And yes, I know it‚Äôs free and y‚Äôall will jump on the ‚Äústop complaining for free stuff‚Äù bandwagon but this game has been flawed from day 1 and I‚Äôve been waiting and holding out for them to fix even basic things that go untreated (but I‚Äôm so glad we finally have use for acid, cause that was SOOO the problem *sarcasm*). 
---
Come on Big B, I expect better of you. 
---
Update:  
---
I actually put in a Global / Player timer report in, and up..  
---
There is enough related reports that there might be something to this, thanks again for the info.
---
No need to be a dick. Lol.
---
They shot first lol. 
---
I break the camp i cant force pvp until im attacked.
---
its 40 caps to move the first time  but the second time its 160 caps if on the same server
---
it's not splitting hairs, when they have said all along, the SBQ is not the end of the story. I mean, that more like a whole head of hair. 
---
So many other games have done expansions that went beyond the original high end content, making that new stuff the "endgame".
---
But FO76 is going to try and be more than just running content with other players. How that shakes out, is something we have to wait and see. 
---
It's an every evolving, new stuff all the time, the SBQ will be replaced with something new a harder. 
---
Maybe how you play games is grinding for gear. Things are changing in the kind of players getting more into video games. They aren't interested in the grind. They are interested in the fun. When it's like that, the endgame is when you get bored, not because you've gotten the best. 
---
He has two outfits on him when he spawns, so you have to get multiple spawns or dashboard with a buddy to get through to some good stuff. Also be aware if you sneeze on him he dies. Mole rat got him one time I was there. Not sure if those two are events based or vendors. Have not seen them on the vendor. 
---
I had Vodka and Crit shot... didn't complete for me last night, but I was in a hurry. I'm trying again tonight. 
---
I didn't get an update on ps4? I assume this is something that would need to be download/updated like any other update? What am I missing here?
---
Agreed, I logged on last night to find the same message. Checked to see if I could put my CAMP down and could. Rebuilt it, logged in and out several times, worked great. Played for a few hours after including a couple server hops. Logged on this morning and low and behold.... A 76 update has blocked the building of your CAMP.  
---
Sigh....
---
I run a similar setup, though I more frequently melee than gatling my non-queen fights these days.
---
Just this morning, I started taking her on by myself, with my pair of TSE .50 cals, fresh off the patch buff. I put a dent in her before anyone else showed up. Everyone else who eventually showed up were all &lt;100, including the levels 43 and 85 who had launched the nuke.
---
They put in a valid effort, but it was definitely about 7K of ultracite .50 coming out of my TSEs that got the job done - but at what cost?
---
You can still eat meat for food and benefits. The lead belly 3 makes it so you can drink from any puddle, sink, or toilet. You still risk water related disease but it can be combatted with keeping hunger and immunities up first, *then* drinking. 
---
They shot first?  Or they shot back?
---
Or they shot after you attacked their base?
---
&gt;ER I ACCEPT ILL HOLD SAID ITEM(S) FOR YOU. ALSO LEAVE YOUR GAMERTAG. I'll mark sold items in the thread with persons gamertag if offer is good.
---
I'll sell you some shells.
---
Yeah. We all know that. Just pulling his leg. 
---
:-)
---
Just like there is a large difference between datamining information to solve something and actually doing it in game.
---
Man someone told me there was one there. I spent a lot of time looking! Its marked on the map with a flower correct?
---
I can launch now (at the silo) yay triple nuke time!
---
Hey there! Nothing new so far... Been playing only 76, but haven't found anything! =]]]
---
It was just near a small pond. Nothing special  at all. It's not the first time or the first place this has happened.  May not rebuild this time seems to be a waste of time. 
---
It's close to there. There's a small rowboat in the pond. 
---
Start with the stickied post [here.](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124?tab=posts) That fix addresses most issues (atom shop textures, can't use scopes, and falling through the world). And side note, the dev behind Better Inventories said to disable that mod until an update is available. Can't drop anything and food values/weapon stats can't be seen with that mod equipped.
---
Never.  We are doomed to be the little school bus that could,  forever. 
---
Mine bugged out on me, I got the whole way to the part where you enter the cabin and enter your randomly generated code, and it told me my code was incorrect, even though I know it wasn‚Äôt because I wrote it down. :/ Now I have to go get the key cards again since they‚Äôre single use...
---
Have you checked all the frames in Watoga?  They will spawn frequently there. 
---
Sounds like you are their spokesperson. Tell us how you came to this knowledge of what these 'pussies' feel?
---
I own the mire. It's mine. I live in the trees like a gulper. I sneak up on the wendigos, not the other way around. I pacify the hermit crabs and sloths so I don't have to kill them cause they're my friends. I eat rad toad omelets for breakfast and mirelurk queen steaks for dinner. 
---
Exactly. You could even go as far to say that the best items in borderlands 2 had drop rates for the best of the best that would make people cry. 
---
Im with you on this one. This could have been a fantastic community effort to piece together all the steps. :(
---
You are not wrong. I was going crazy yesterday with all these posts. I just think people could save themselves getting their hopes up if they actually read things. I know the trailer didn‚Äôt have the release dates. But I was even seeing a bunch of posts from people who had ‚Äúread‚Äù the roadmap and still didn‚Äôt get that it wasn‚Äôt supposed to be released yet. It literally says May 23rd.
---
This only goes so far. I've been on a vent nearly two months, still run short periodically, even gathering it constantly.
---
Neato burrito, I just looked at the roadmap text which was ambiguous and said spring.
---
Can anyone help me understand what happened with bloodied/adrenal builds? My damage got halved :(
---
nothing, just people trying to use it as an excuse to be assholes to other people..  other games you hit a role play server, it was just not speaking out of character, and traveling, questing as such, not a licence to ruin everyone elses game.  take it to the pvp server and have a blast.
---
It is? Il remove the post, but isnt Bethesda's Bug report system busted rn
---
iv seen the hunters long coat...the clean spacesuit  and helmer.civil war era apparel..and skiing oufits.so far..but yeh he got killed when a  mole rat looked at him
---
I know that row boat.... I will have to look again!
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Nevaar, your blue balls of doom shall never again hurt anything but level 1 wild animals!!
---
That Alien Blaster should be called the Nuka Blaster cause it hits like a toy lol
---
I think Plasma Weapons are supposed to be balanced via their dual types of damage of ballistic and energy.  Its just that without any kind of armor penetration they hit a bit soft for a supposed highly advanced piece of technology.  The BoS stole this technology from people, they should've just been mass producing Handmade rifles...
---
I have a diving board off that cliff
---
all daily events are broken?
---
all but one ...
---
... i still have to kill a wendigo ...
---
Probably not long, since data mining revealed that they do exist as future Atom Shop updates.
---
They shot me after i orbital stiked their base. 
---
Either way it isnt greifing. 
---
The new mission is "looking failed" for me is not playable. 
---
Also Sentinel helps for up close melee.
---
It's back up üòäüòäüòä
---
The loot from the corpse is going to be tied to the level of the mob, but the event reward will be tied to your level, so you might get a good item.
---
Which is fine, there's nothing wrong with the mechanic at all.
---
People are going to report and complain about pvp, just how it is. Personally I don't pvp much but it someone wants a workshop I have I just wave them over to the bench and let them take it. I just take them for the plans lol.
---
I added some extra lights, railings on a couple of my decks and a lvl 2 turret all with space to spare. Heavenly.
---
Haha it's like in Fallout 4 when you used to be able to remotely hack robots by aiming at them. Made Automatron much easier in survival mode. 
---
I've never successfully traded with someone, the interface makes no sense. 
---
After reading this post, I'm even more confused lol.
---
Do you understand that endgame activities do not indicate the end of a story or development?
---
In an MMO the endgame is just the activities that ate available at the end when you have exhausted all else. In this game the end game is nuke zones and gear until such a time that they add something else. 
---
That video trailer had a lot of misleading information in it. Sometimes it's easier for everyone if you leave a simple explainiation and leave it at that rather than demean people who ask simple questions. 
---
"There are no stupid questions. Only stupid answers." -Anon

It's hard to find the acid as it's underwater.

It's alright but I prefer the Quantum recipe. Only issue is mine has to be Crimson Flux Red since I can't find blue fruit punch in my area
---
Really?  Is that new?
---
I've killed a mega shitload of robots and they only blow up if they are sentry bots or you cripple multiple arms, or a leg.  
---
Great!
---
No and there is a perk to help with that.
---
Mods 
---
There he is!
---
Bethesda‚Äôs stance to new players is either you die and lose caps or GTFO. Making pacifists killable basically means player-on-player violence is highly encouraged. Shooting a piece of wall can get your loss capped at 5, very smart system in place to protect the aggressors. 
---
That's probably because you're smelting steel.  The yields from scrapping weapons have just gone up, so honestly, there's no need to collect iron ore anymore. I think if you stick to supermutants for steel and gunpowder and farm the lead from Lucky Hole, you will probably not run out.
---
I had the same thing happen to me last night. I spent about 400 plastic bulking stuff with super duper on. I stopped and immediately went to my stash to put most of it away. I had no bulked items. However, I did have way more junk than I started with so super duper was working.
---
At no point did I scrap all junk. I'm going to try again tonight.
---
I really don't understand why we need to open the map to access settings. I never seen someting like that before...
---
Go for it. I've played only casually since late December (~120 hours and only at levels 54 and 22 on two characters) and feel like there's a ton of content I haven't played yet. I'm almost to the end of the main questline, but for the most part have bypassed many side quests, dailies, and events. 
---
Food rots too fast, i hope it's a bug.
---
Her bottomless pipboy of holding of course!
---
let me guess. In a clown costume. 
---
Just because its unsolvable for one person doesnt mean we couldn't have figured it out as a community. Some puzzles are meant to be something for whole communities to participate in. 
---
Everyone shares what they've found and we collectively comb through the game looking for the next step.  
---
Datamining just robbed us of a possibly very cool community experience. :/
---
Being a prick is not necessarily a violation of the terms of service.  
---
Sorry to hear; the pacifists are some of the most toxic people on this forum. Constantly whining to mommy Beth about every tiny little thing.
---
I would say no unless you did it continuously to the same person for no real reason other than to annoy them. 
---
Yep.  That's what I thought.  You attacked a bunch of people minding their own business.
---
Because everyone knows that griefers with massive bounties *never* hard disconnect rather than die. XD
---
I do
---
Then send it to one of the community managers via PM. They'll get it passed on, and it'll stay out of the public eye.
---
Yup many many times and when I do find T60 it's lvl 45 :(
---
Yeah just figured this out actually :)
---
I smelt far more lead than iron, though yes, I am looking forward to the steel buff playing in here positively. And then there's gunpowder. And then there's the crystal and other random ores I smelt that I pick up, often while mining lead, or just along the way.
---
Oh! I‚Äôm actually quite jealous haha I have not found a single one! I probably found loads before I got addicted and didn‚Äôt realise....,
---
Thanks though :-)
---
The feature is a good idea. The problem is that some people don't understand what open PvP means.
---
You know this mod has been broken since patch 6 right?
---
How do you unlock these? 
---
What kind of recipes can you learn with what bonuses?
---
Yeah but they did just destroy what could have been any amazing community effort to figure out how to get this. :/

I've found that I disconnect more when I take a workshop and it's pretty consistent, usually after 4 hours or so. If I don't take a workshop, my session rarely disconnects? 
---
Well Wish I saw this post before posting my own.

Which is a legit tactic supported by the Bethesda... I want them to attack me. Or at lease have a bounty hunter loom for me. 
---
I gotta get that bounty somehow. I prefer to attack camps with players on them:
---
 - So they can see me do it and have a chance to server hop
---
 - so the can have a chance to defend their camp. 
---
Would you prefer i attack CAMPS without players on them?
---
Where does it spawn? I did the new quest. It didn‚Äôt see the set. 
---
There‚Äôs literally a perk card to help you more efficiently destroy someone else‚Äôs camp. 
---
This
---
No absolutely not worth it I have played 850 hours and have had not fun just a shitstorm of a game
---
Dude, you have been away for a while. A dense armor mod for the chest makes you immune to scorchbeast screams. I can get hollered at all day long at 10% health. Scorchbeasts are playthings for me.
---
I mean, you aren't wrong about being a glass cannon. But its more of a issue for groups. 1 on 1 with any creature in the game usually ends badly, for them.
---
IT'S BEEN 3 HOURS SINCE WE HAD A POST ABOUT PERK CARDS WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b1esd7/will_we_ever_get_perk_card_presets/
---
Unpopular opinion here, but I've liked it ever since launch, regardless of the bugs and flaws. And it's only going to get better and better
---
Why the downvote? I wouldn't phrase it like he did,but reporting nothing for the sake of angrily smashing a button, is indeed pretty stupod.
---
&gt; banned for no reason
---
Hmmm.
---
Spawns inside of the frat house, either in the bedroom all the way to right upstairs or the laundry room in the basement. If you're on Xbox I'm selling this one!
---
Bad title 
---
When the main quest directs you to the Top of the World and you're below level 25, you should hold on to it and do some side quests around the Forest and Toxic Valley areas, as the mobs in those areas don't scale up past level 15.
---
In this case I disagree. When the answer is right in front of you literally spelled out in English it‚Äôs a bit of a stupid question. I‚Äôm aware my answer was stupid too though. 
---
The roadmap was very heavily publicized, especially on this sub. It was also included in the notes of the last big update. I was just baffled by how many people didn‚Äôt read it.
---
Where is this from ? And is this correct or just a troll ?
---
Yeet yeet
---
I won‚Äôt be on until tonight, but thanks! I‚Äôll keep checking the frat house with the daily quests. I‚Äôll get it sometime :)
---
Agreed with the point you are getting at
---
Sounds like an argument for a simpler build.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you didnt program anything but feedback does help.  If you‚Äôre patient, they will get it where it needs to be.
---
here‚Äôs what I recommend: travel to the workshop you want to get stuff from. server hop until u find one setup that is unlocked. enjoy free loot.
---
At this point, since the X-01 Quantum had no logical sense nor order to the things that had to be done, I guess it‚Äôll get data mined as well...
---
It didnt need to datamined though. We could have found it organically and THEN posted a step by step.  By dataming hes robbed us of a cool community puzzle...
---
In a word: imagination. We role play. Or grind, which is boring.
---
That ok it your opinion no going to judge 
---
Is Marsupial required? I can't seem to get up there in Tanagra Town.
---
I‚Äôd love to wake up next to a beautiful lady like in real life but I know I‚Äôll be looking at a Yaoguai instead.

---
I know 
---
I‚Äôm just getting into pvp, I totally would!
---
&gt;Dont let Bethesda ban you for no reason
---
Whatever you say, cheater
---
Sure, if you want to open yourself up to credit card fraud charges. You violated the terms of the TOS and were banned because of it. Berhesda isn't at fault, you are.
---
Plus, if you purchased the game through Steam/Xbox/Sony, they will ban you from their services, because you paid **them**, and **not** Bethesda.
---
If you‚Äôre role playing as a raider, should you dress, wear the same armor, use the same weapons as a raider? Or just say you‚Äôre a raider and do pvp stuff? 
---
Yes. I use a mic tho. Ill talk to you during a battle.
---
And as I pointed out before, why did it not occur to you that 12 people together can't just server hop without ruining their evening?
---
And I do not believe what you are saying because of what you said elsewhere in this thread.  I believe you attacked them simply to get caps and the base was ancillary to that.
---
That‚Äôs been around forever! But I have no idea how it was figured out without a guide
---
Yeah, I wouldn't recommend this, doing a chargeback on your credit card for such an illegitimate reason is a form of fraud and may come back to bite you in the ass. You do not have grounds for a refund if you broke the terms and conditions so I hope you're confident in being "banned for no reason" because you may well be on the receiving end of someone having to prove whether that was true.
---
That is true for everything 
---
IT'S NOT YOUR IDEA YOU PEOPLE REPOST THIS HOURLY
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b1en42/sort_out_perk_cards_please/
---
Pure damage output without considering legendary effects yes, but once again I hesitate to call anything out as best.  It has its drawbacks and advantages vs. the 50 cal...  the spin up is one of the drawbacks.  The 50 cal has potential to do better - Anti-Armor is pointless on energy weapons.  The 50 cal prime receiver provides more of a damage increase, so I believe it will exceed the gatling plasma when both are primed versions.
---
With lots of people trying different things and sharing info with each other on forums. Thats the sort of puzzle that was spoiled. 
---
Maybe one of these new Vaults is related to the new campaign we‚Äôre getting this winter called Wastelanders if you look at the thumbnail its a vault pouring out gold and a vault boy and girl running out 
---
WASTELANDERS
---
RELEASE: FALL 2019
---
Embark on a tale with true choice and consequences in Wastelanders ‚Äì our biggest and most ambitious update for 76. Wastelanders will include a new main questline, new factions, new events, new features and even more surprises.
---
It would be cool if the new plot involved a Sierra Madre style heist or something maybe even the addition of npcs since its supposed to be the biggest and most ambitious update 
---
[Bethesda.net article featuring the dlc roadmap for 2019](https://bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019) 
---
I think there‚Äôs been some sort of miscommunication here. I never said you were wrong, or didn‚Äôt intend to anyway. If it came off that way, I apologize. 
---
Having read your last post, and rereading your initial post, I understand now where you are coming from. I can see how it would be frustrating to have your story told through no in-game effort. I think I must have interpreted your first post the wrong way. 
---
I still don‚Äôt have a problem with the way they datamined the info, but I can appreciate where you‚Äôre coming from, and why you don‚Äôt like it. 
---
On another note, have you had any of your work published? Is there a link to find some of the stuff you‚Äôve worked on?
---
I have to agree that a mic is eaiser but to be honest as I guy that plays in a team that mostly uses discord I often forget to change my audio settings back. I also wish in game text was a thing.
---
&gt;To close this I'll just reiterate #1
---
But... they're ALL #1
---
Good guide though :) 
---
I will probably launch later (like 7-ish Eastern) as well as this weekend, feel free to add me PSN: Skizzunky
---
Yes and it makes me sad we got this one ruined :(
---
Great work for this! I‚Äôm excited to get this for myself. I couldn‚Äôt imagine someone doing this all on their own.
---
If you bought a digital copy on ps4 atleast ik sony will ban your account for a chargeback
---
YOU'RE LYING THIS WAS LAST POSTED 13 HOURS AGO WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE 
---
Yeah I can help you man, been wanting to switch to T51 anyways. I forget which mods I have on them but let‚Äôs call it 400 caps?
---
I see all my other atom shop items just fine. Is the mothman poster a base game object? Because I dont have that at all. And if it's an atom shop item I never purchased it. 
---
Yah.... not a recovering alcoholic, but I am super uncomfortable about it and all the content revolving around it and sorta glamorization of it?  I appreciate the post and raising the topic tho. It is worth talking about and hearing from others imho.
---
Aargh. Also check the vendors. People have been stripping and selling the armor 
---
Meh, a lot of people (myself included) will see one thing and not look into it too much. That's why we ask questions like that. It's totally fine to ask a question you don't know the answer to. Especially if it's on a forum that is considered to be a community resource. I get it's frustrating to see people ask the same questions when the answer is easily accessible, but if it bothered you that much why put in the effort to respond?
---
Don't use mods online. 
---
I‚Äôve got a fast unarmed character. High str, end, and agility. Barbarian, evasive, serendipity, incisor, marathoner, action boy/girl and white knight are musts. I went with speed over pure damage so I took mostly passive DR and AP refresh perks, that plus an AA death tambo with extra swing speed and speed demon and it‚Äôs a blast. Cut through enemies like butter. Probably not great for pvp tho. 
---
It should show up even if you haven‚Äôt purchased it. 
---
I can see credit cards doing a refund.....but I would be surprised if Bethesda is paying for it.  Most credit card companies/banks will wave something or take a charge off as a one time courtesy to keep you as a customer.  If he got a refund, my guess is that this is the reason why.
---
And THAT ladies and gentlemen, is a prime example of a point missed by a distance measured only in stellar units.
---
Listen, friend, at no point did I say I agreed with underlevelled bosses in high level areas. Your imagination conjured that part up. Did you seriously interpret my comment as DEFENDING the way it is?
---
FWIW, at level 200, I would LOVE more places or events to get max level legendaries. West-Tek gets really really OLD after a while.
---
Oh, and this isn't relevant, but I have 2 accounts. So 10 chars. Thanks ;)
---
Yes it could have been a great community experience. The issue I still have with this is that the clues themselves do not lead you to the answer. There are 3 steps that all come together with 0 clues to actually tie them together. Had the clues been well done, there would be no need to resort to datamining. Its when your banging your head against the wall because there ISNT a clue that you wonder what the point is trying to solve it legitimately.
---
Generally when there is puzzle like this, the clues that you find actually tie one step to the next, making it a reasonable experience. 
---
Randomly roaming around hoping to find the answer is not a well designed puzzle.
---
So you didn't need to mine and ruin it for everyone now did you? You could have just waited untill it was solved. :p
---
You sly devil
---
They patched the foundation stacking if that's what you were saving for .. :(
---
I guess you could kill it. 
---
what kinda of animal was it?
---
Once you reach the top where I went left into the house go right instead, there will be a cave entrance you can navigate through to bring you to the top. Beware of the many cave crickets inside though.
---
No I couldn‚Äôt 
---
It wasn't clear to me that you only cannibalize since you have the carnivore. nm
---
Oh yeah they don't care about your sexual orientation when they're murdering you and selling your 5 year old daughter into slavery
---
I don't think that matters in 76, because melee is always locked to a single opponent. It's not like Fallout 4 where certain perks allowed the Super Sledge to clobber everything in the radius of the swing. 
---
As for as dropping enemies ASAP, I have an Instigating Combat Knife and Furious Mole Miner Gauntlet for that, along with Radicool, Talons, and Twisted Muscles.  It's a matter of choice. Fast with a need to heal, or slow and come out ahead.
---
Ground Zero is the detonation point, not anywhere within the blast radius.
---
So your example, I saw Lewisburg Station was the center of a fresh incoming nuke.  I fast traveled there and recorded the bomb basically dropping on my head, died, got the trophy.
---
What you describing is what I'm talking about. I've not reach that point in the game, even though having over 470 hours of gameplay.
---
So endgame is subjective. Which means its a useless term when applied to MMO's, since they are, as you have stated, always adding. 
---
Call me cheater all you want.
---
By the way, if you griefed cheaters and stole their bags, you also get banned.
---
Calling someone a cheater is easy, I know. But banning someone and not taking responsibility because you have a fucked up game, is easier.
---
An hour ago you said you just got the game yesterday. Don't pull a hammie hopping on that bandwagon
---
Or log out and switch servers. I tend not to stick around when someone's messing with my stuff. Or when 3 scorchbeasts started the buzzard circle over my camp the other day.... 
---
Having Perk Card Decks have been posted many times, and I didn't see this one post. 
---
Also mine isn't a Deck or Blueprint, it's for when you change one single perk card and to stop duplicate cards. 
---
Not your teeth??
---
I know not everyone enjoys playing bloodied builds, but with my current setup, I can reach \~650 damage on my 1 star bloodied .50 cal. After you factor in the extra damage from Tenderizer and Glowsight, that's a ton of DPS to the queen! My TSE .50 cal, all things equal, does like 1/2 or less. When I lay into her after I revive with revenant and all the other multipliers active... her health melts. Still, it takes a good 2k at least, and if everyone shows up and on one else is helping (some people do help, but bless their souls, they just aren't really optimized the way I am), it can turn into a slugfest that takes 4-5K.
---
Nice! I was the og guy that tracked all the steps to the red paint nuka cola job for the T-51, but I had to do it all in game!
---
Yeah bro sure my GT is jeanzyy 
---
So much awesome! Thanks dude!
---
I have T60 Mods looking to sell PS4
---
Jokes aside some day I want to try a beserker‚Äôs build just to say I gave that useless legendary effect a shot.
---
Too many decent 2 and 3 star rolls ruined by that effect. Can‚Äôt use em. Nobody buys em. They all just ended up dumped to vendors.
---
I‚Äôd love to someday see stats on most vs least used legendary effect. I bet it‚Äôd be bottom 3 if not last
---
Destroying, no
---
But it does make you an asshole.
---
However repeatedly destroying the base and abusing workshop pvp in it's current state which allows you to travel to their camp and destroy their shit with no reprecussion should be disallowed.
---
I found 13 bags at the bog town workshop on the 2nd floor.
---
Your posting history sure looks like someone who was duping. 
---
I'm Xbox bro
---
I wonder what all they optimized?
---
My budget was at 95% before the patch, and is at a slim, svelte 95% after the patch.
---
The patch was a big problem for me as it deleted most of my progress. However, I managed to make some little changes to adapt my design to the new ‚Äúfoundation rules.‚Äù
---
Its not greifing. 
---
The burden ia ALWAYS on the pacifist to server hop. You are choosing to opt out of fo76 features. You have to leave, not me.
---
Yes, i was out hunting players for caps. Thats something i like to do. It isnt greifing. Baiting via ccamp destruction is a legit tactic to entice pvp. Supported by bethesda. 
---
Your "greif" is a product of your ignorance and denial about the games features. Its not a product of my actions in the game. Im playing the game as it was intended. 
---
Your basically greifing yourself. You need a come to jesus moment where you realize this is a survival pvp enabled game.
---
Have someone nuke a train station, pretty easy to get to one of those within 3 minutes~
---
I am 100% with you. But the people who think they are somehow immune to the pvp aspects of the game are going to abuse the hell out of it.
---
Thanks /u/Valseek, glad to know you guys are on it. 
---
I was with ya there on that one, we got all the way to the point were everything pointed to watoga but couldnt find the answer! Then you revealed it the next day. Mad props!
---
He didn't get a refund. He got the money put back on his card because that's the standard S.O.P. when you file a charge back. When his CC company audits the transaction OP is going to lose his/her card.
---
Thank you for the reasonable discussion. Glad you can at least see my point. I wasn't looking to change anyone or shame anyone. Just pointing out, these kind of ways of doing things do ruin it for some people.
---
Since this is the internet, and people use the safety of the internet to be mean and vindictive, I prefer not to give such information out publicly.
---
But yes, my work has been published. I work with both book publishers, individuals, and gaming companies. 
---
Bethesda introduced some no build zones with the last update....your camp must have been in one of those zones
---
Depending on where you are trying to build your camp, Bethesda has added no build zones. Where are you trying to build?
---
Game is literally unplayable ,for me, without Perk loadout manager.
---
But it use to be so much better, because you were able to save changes on the fly. Bethesda did something in patch 6 that changed that, and now you have to pre-set loadouts on nukes and dragons.
---
But if they were to include this feature in the game,  there would be no reason for me to even use mods.
---
They announced that if your camp is where they‚Äôre planning to release new content that you will have to place your camp somewhere else. 
---
Not true. I killed a mule who had around 10 million lbs of weight in junk, took it all, and still here I am.
---
Yeah lol. No I will "mock" your ability to be spesific.
---
You go deeper into obscurity, of the majestic TEH PROBLEM, without never saying what is TEH problem. Even when directly asked to.
---
Smell that? I do. It smells like me. Mee mee mee.
---
&gt;Dev Note: As part of our ongoing quest to improve the game‚Äôs overall economy, performance, and address items created as a result of exploit abuse
---
I'm disabling comment replies, because you had a chance to tell me about teh problem, and you choose not to.
---
Come back later and let us know how the nukes go please. I'm curious and can't play until tomorrow üôÅ
---
Lights and turrets from what I‚Äôve read. I had a lot of lights and neon letters, no turrets, and it decreased by 33%
---
If you log out and come back is it still there? 
---
Do you mean there's a new glitch that allows you build crazy stuff, or that you achieved what you wanted without the glitches?
---
Shoot me a pm.. Im not dumb enough to post my ign here. Ill friend you on PC.
---
I run a discord also.
---
I did it but when i got to the end the plans were not there for me to pick up 
---
The burden is on the pacifist to server hop because Bethesda did not envision grievers.  Soon it will no longer be necessary. Buh-Bye
---
From what I've gauged is that if you just have all the damage increasing perks, the plasma is better. But once you add a prime receiver and stabilised perk, the 50 cal out shines the plasma, right?
---
I was initially disappointed but tried to keep in mind that with online services, you generally get 3 kinds of content. Events, smaller dlc, and then the big game over hauls. 
---
Nuclear winter and especially Wastlander (new main quest line etc) seems like they will be the latter. 
---
Where March/April is more of a mash up of events/smaller DLC +Survival Mode. 
---
I did it but when i got to the end in the bunker the plans were not there for me. They arent there.... wow
---
Im not trying to build, my camp was already there. But it was near the top of the world train station on the road, beside the water there 
---
I was wondering the same thing.
---
Bethesda did not envision *carebears*
---
Bethesda doesnt think what i donis greifing either.
---
Lol.. Banned cheater talking about someone else not taking responsibility for their actions.
---
Its not required just run and jump. What is required are the plans to show up at the end. They did not show up for me 
---
I guess it just grinds my gears. All the answers are at our fingertips these days. People cared enough to be excited, but not enough to legitimately inform themselves. 
---
Self discovery and the ability to read and comprehend information are important real life skills I want you all to have. 
---
Yes. Me and my friend also.
---
My scorched radtoad *looked and sounded* like he was attacking the base, but did no damage. Still traded that noisy jerk in on a cuddly yao guai.
---
The new features tab also shows the vault boy with a sentry bot it would be cool if we got back the features from automatron in 76 and could have robot allies the assets already exists in game it just need to be reworked to play nice with the new multiplayer environments and perks id assume but if thats the case I also want pet companions similar to dogmeat or even a pack brahmin for trader or merchant characters I know they mentioned robot vendors for our camps but now with Wild Appalachia we‚Äôre getting camp vending so it would be pointless to just get vending machines again just reskined as robots im hope for an AI companion system similar to old fallout games 
---
Name confirmed, griefer trollin'...
---
Well we decided on flight and still die.
---
I think since they allow you to capture workshops from anywhere now people don‚Äôt realize you can stealthboy or sneak in line up your shot then click capture and in the same second vats crit them in the back of the head.  Probably think you cheated or 1 shot them with slap damage.  
---
Thats where my camp is, works fine still....
---
Question, does your camp have stacked floors/foundations? 
---
GT: BekBekk94 
---
I found a nuka grape in the bunker but no plans
---
I‚Äôm level 150 and had my first drop just a couple days ago. And it was level 30. 
---
Mote ripped content from nuka world? Its cool and all but id like to see more new stuff that isn't sent straight to the atomic shop.
---
No it doesn't
---
Ya that's what I do 
---
Some guy data mined it
---
Stabilized is factored into all the numbers you see there for ballistic heavy guns.  Yes, considering the prime receiver for the gatling plasma only providing a very token increase in damage, the 50 cal surpassed it when primed.  I'll add primed versions of both, plus the gatling to the main table soon.
---
I‚Äôm only doing it if I can catch the three-eyed fish from The Simpson‚Äôs, Mr. Blinky
---
In the patch notes it specifies that many new places have a no-build zone. The game will give you one free move. You will need to move your camp.
---
I hope you have better luck placing it than I did. I did some tricks to get my brick walls facing inwards, and that apparently meant that I had "floating" objects in my automatically generated blueprint. I had to start from scratch. And even though I could still rotate the walls during build, any time I logged back in, they game flipped them around.
---
Given the fact that the group that found the crashed plane had data mined it, it still would have been solved with data mining regardless. It just comes down to who was releasing first.
---
And you can help share that information rather than make people feel bad about themselves! That's all I'm trying to say. You could've posted a link to the roadmap and it would have been much more kind and helpful. Let's spread kindness *and* informational awareness!
---
Fair enough, the quantum one had no logical order anyway so...
---
Agreed. 
---
I don't actually mind the way they are dropping these. 
---
Events and smaller doc leading up to major quest driven DLC. 
---
I'm not in a rush for a whole new questline, because despite what this sub thinks MOST players are not level 212 with 7364553 hours played and have done 665 SBQ runs.
---
Ok, you're a cheater. 
---
Can confirm. 
---
My melee character swung by (bu-dump-pish) the golf course club house last night.  Pulled ghouls out front door and smashy, smashy.  Legendary did not drop anything.
---
Went down stairs to mop up, and when I double checked the looted bare ghoul meat piles, suddenly there were a host of legendary drops.
---
Saw that last night too. It showed at camp venture 
---
I haven't rebuilt my CAMP in months. Logged on yesterday and saw that my 75% used budget was now about 40%. I think I might have to rebuild and expand lol. 
---
&gt;  Killing you and wrecking your CAMP isn't harassment, it's the way the  game was set up. Please stop calling for people to be banned 
---
yeah good luck with that a lot of people are idiots and dont read the big ass warning that says "take a workshop opens you to pvp"
---
Hey, that reminds me! Have you seen any posts about perk loadoits, or swapping?
---
I think that would be a rad idea.
---
Maybe I shoukd make a post about it?
---
Fuckit, have my upvote
---
The nuked flora look so much better post-patch! We can finally track down bright purple flash ferns.
---

Thank you

It‚Äôs a gamble you just need to take some chances. Bought a three star assault rifle yesterday that had bash damage and reduced weight (still weighs 11 lbs lmao), bought a legendary zealot Thompson in the morning and found out it has explosive bullets and extra damage to zealots. 
---
They are still quite expensive.  
---
Just to let you know that because of the popularity, this will take ages to actually get. The TNT keys are a one time server spawn. The keycards are one time use, so if you open the doors, and the TNT keys aren't there, you'll have to go collect the keycards again at the new server.  Not only that, but the generate one time server code works for the whole server, so if you try to enter the code after someone else tries to generate a code, your code will no longer work, and you won't know their new code.  And you won't know the code won't work until you use the keycards.  On top of all that, the paint is a single spawn inside the dome for the whole server.  
---
Get used to jumping up Tanagra Town... I've done it 3 times already
---
Have carebears somehow been turned into a pejorative by the high school crowd?  
---
At any rate you've admitted that you stalked them out simply for the caps so I'm going to stop feeding the troll now.  
---
Look up this phrase and understand that I will not read any of your replies (so you will NOT get the last word).

Wandering Events? Maybe it's a new feature! üòú
---
Not in this context. It is a word used in gaming circles to describe the typicalyl expected end game activities.
---
It is mostly used in this context in MMOs and is absolutely useful when speaking to other gamers. For instance "What is the end game like?" Is a common question among gamers when discussing a prospective game.
---
6-7 bags behind the R&amp;G workshop

I had this earlier, it appeared to spawn at my current location (overseers camp at that time).
---
Tbh I wish daily quests and repeatables would just reset when the daily challeneges reset every day. It becomes a pain trying to work around their internal timers based on when I last could play a quest and when I have free time.
---
Relocating your camp costs caps. Which I had to do several times until I got the house placed right. 
---
But you still could've been kind about it! If you would've posted the link to the roadmap it would've been much more kind and helpful to the OP. That's all I'm trying to say.
---

---
Untrue I have 2 pieces and have never duped or even bought anything off another player.

They both dropped in same day on same server a few weeks ago
---
Sentinel and Cavalier are not uncommon - but must be a 3* drop.   Parring the with Assassins or unyielding becomes much more rare.  
---
Sigh. The it‚Äôs a term used in niche groups as a short hand and not actually a universal term with defined meaning.

I understand not giving out information completely. If you‚Äôre on XB1, my GT is TexasAtari, feel free to find me in game and maybe you can pass along some of that info. 
---
And thank you as well for being reasonable. This sub has had so much hate spewed on it since it was created, I like that we can have differing opinions and still walk away at peace with each other. 
---
Second key card is never there. I changed about 28 servers and couldn't find it. What's happening?
---
Your welcome.
---
Have some God Damn Faith, man!
---
Don't know but I was working on it the fair way, guess that fucking sucks for me.
---
It‚Äôs not Fallout then
---
You don‚Äôt even really need to sneak, you can just walk in, wave hi use the benches ect and then wait until they turn around then capture vats crit them. 
---
Omg yes. Like destiny. Destiny has plenty of its own problems, but at least you KNOW when you can replay everything. 
---
The one for Quantum is randomly generated and if someone generates a key after you, then yours is useless so you have to hurry once you get your unique key
---
Two wrongs dont make a right. We would have found it without the dataminers. :/ 
---
Hopefully beth learns from this so the puzzle isnt ruined again.
---
Did you know that there's a gravel pit right next to Poseidon? All the concrete you can mine.
---
I didn't downvote you, and the people that did are whiners, yeah, but your comment was kind of ignoring the point of my post entirely.
---
Does the paint job respawn? Cause when I unlocked the dome everything was there except the paint job so I think someone took it before me
---
Has this been confirmed by anyone else ?
---
I read it. Must be a new feature.  How do I tag the devs?
---
I had done that on the first 10 posts asking the same thing. And then they commented to say they had already read that but they still didn‚Äôt understand why bethesda ‚Äúlied again and didn‚Äôt release content.‚Äù 
---
It was a long day. Lol. 
---
They're lying too, then. 
---
Nice, thanks for that.
---
Can't speak for every game... But every time Final Fantasy XIV applies hotfixes, the servers are down.
---
Wow! This is new? Things like this is why this game can only get better and better!... If i have money i would Goldyou... THANKS!
---
Go fix the Poseidon Power Plant (or any power plan) a few times until you learn all the plans. You get a guaranteed plan at the end and it will be one that you don't know.

Your welcome

Wait they are that effective in annoying trespassers I'm about to do this so people will leave my base alone 
---
Okay
---
Damn! That makes so much sense! 
---
I always wonder what the siren does....
---
Lol I get ya. I was snappy yesterday too. Mostly because I have brochitis and I was run around trying to get my scripts, but just be aware that sometimes it's easy to forget that even if you've seen the same question over and over again you don't always have to respond with frustration, or at all!

"*If you* can't *say* somethin' *nice*, *don't say* nothin' at all." -Thumper

All this time.  I thought that was the milk of human kindness on the moo moos chin.

Man.  The wasteland is one messed up place.
---
Did you check the BOS outposts like firebase major and alpha? 
---
I'll upvote you because there's nothing wrong with adding your opinion to this debate.  There is never anything wrong with expecting and asking people to behave rationally.  Actually believing they will listen and alter their conduct is a whole other story.  This feature will be abused because it can be abused, much the same way the PVP system in this game can and will be abused.  People can and have called 911 to report a pizza parlor for refusing to deliver them pizza. The important thing is that I believe the devs. are trying and this is just one more tool to help honestly bullied and harassed players to cope with this game.  Note I said "honestly" there.  There's always going to be salty players who just can't possibly image that someone else was able to beat them without cheating somehow. So until these types of players actually develop a little skin and maybe the ability to separate fantasy from reality, then I guarantee the 911 calls will come in.   
---
Oh! It's blue! I want it!
---
I'm looking into this one, will let you know what I find out!
---
Looking into this, will let you know what I find out. Thanks for the report!
---
Holy fuck yes YES ***YES!***
---
&gt;Is this just me?

Seems to be

Edited my post to point to this comment, thats kind of a big deal!

Also brahmin pen.

I feel like they only come out at night too
---
Nope but it does make you a asshole 
---
Note their names, log to Main menu, then block them AND report them for griefing.  You'll get an email later for more details, remember names, location, time and details of it for the email.
---
Oh hell yes, thank you
---
I like the aesthetic of your camp. I grew up on a farm in Vermont so it brings back memories. 
---
I meant that the steps to solve the Easter Egg had no logical succession nor where they connected in any way. How do i know to go to that mansion and that there is a room in the back, nothing was pointing at that to begin with
---
I‚Äôd be over the moon if you helped me with a rad shower. :)
---
I dunno what exactly the deal with the legendary vendor will be but a free fast travel to him might be a good idea - rather than have to potentially trawl your way across the map each time.
---
Damn got all the way up to getting the TNT dome 7 key, opened it and no plans :( Currently server hopping and opening domes to see if I can get one.
---
K thx

&gt;Looking at the "Kill Enemy with Energy Weapons while intoxicated with High Voltage Hefe"
---
It doesn't give you the recipe when it tells you to do it?
---
Mine was a "after drinking Oak Hollar Lager".  And then it appeared in my recipe list after getting the quest, so I could craft it.
---
Imposter Chally!
---
Your welcome 
---
\*nuzzles\*
---
Hadn‚Äôt really thought of that way, but yeah, I guess they have. 
---
You sell 4k ammo for 1k? Damn son hmu
---
I am a new player and I keep seeing that stash is like 800 lbs but mine says 160. How do you increase it? Thanks
---
Yup, same here on the lever action. Its either empty or left with 1 or 2.
---
"Wipe my shiny, metal ASS!...wait, do I even have a ass?"
---
Please don't. They are annoying, but will end up with your base being destroyed.
---
I know that I would have destroyed that base if I couldn't turn off the sirens
---
dev's? Problem 
---
Random tidbit, Recipe\_Backpack\_Effect\_Refrigerated is in the game files.
---
I've seen about 10 posts about it.
---
I have a 2* TSE harpoon gun if you are interested
---
99 bottles of beer on the wall
---
99 bottles of beer
---
Take one down, pass it around...
---
...84 bottles of beer on the war
---
Oh really? Awesome! The budget requirement for that was WAY too much 
---
Squeaky wheel so they say...
---
We'll never know if it was well designed because it wasn't given a chance to be solved.
---
The thing with puzzles like this is they have to be vague as all get out or they'll get solved in an hour by one guy. These are meant to take the entire community trying random shit.  If you can figure it out on your own without working with a bunch of others to find the next step then its not a community puzzle.  :/
---
You sir just posited a GRAND idea!
---
I don‚Äôt have any sneak peeks equipped and use one piece of chameleon armor. Last night while doing uranium fever I had mole miners running past me on that little bridge after I had tagged them once (with the exception of the legendaries, they saw me immediately).  Definitely wasn‚Äôt happening like that before. 
---
Don‚Äôt know if they over compensated sneaking or if it‚Äôs because mole miners can‚Äôt see anything. 
---
The garage with the Power Armor inside Nuka Cola factory has at least 3 Quantum spawns.  Accessible from the catwalks above.
---
May require a Jumping Puzzle (climbing up a piece of heavy equipment then hopping onto the catwalk).  Or a Jet Pack or Level 3 lock picking from the roof for the other.  I was able to get to it via jet pack.
---
Just a suggestion.
---
Your compass will display a Radiation Warning symbol when you are in the prospective blast zone. Just head towards it like any other quest marker.
---
It's seemingly random when you can get the quest for crafting a new type of alcohol for Biv. And it's also random which new alcohol has to be crafted. So you are not even close to be guarenteed to get the High Voltage Hefe in less than 24h even if you played every single second of tge day.
---
There's a new one too. Dome 7, I believe.
---
If I find one I‚Äôll give it to you for free.  All you have to do is tell me why the hell would you pay 100 caps? Lol 
---
kay
---
Will check next time 
---
There is a vendor upstairs at Whitesprings that sells all Nuka Cola flavors. Grape is my favorite
---
They cheat. OP evans says so.
---
Vangaurd what though? You have to scrap the same type of armor to get mods for it. If your vangaurd armor is marine and your making and scrapping a bunch of leather you won't unlock any mods but leather armor mods 
---
I paid 5k... If you can go 5... That would be great.
---
Completely agree. I assume this is the case for tamed animals as well.
---
[https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/)
---
you are welcome
---
Hopefully they fixed the nuke thing
---
Somehow the player base hates killing other players for caps more than duplicating items, damaging server stability, and inflating the legendary item trading market.
---
Don't they cost less than that from the white springs vendor?
---
I can't find one for the life of me and I have so many caps it isn't really a big deal.
---
 I used to have steps up to a tiny platform with all the crafting stations and 3 turrets and be at max budget. When I came back after hearing about this update I logged in to see what was max budget is now like 20%. Now I have something to do and a reason to collect blueprints. Got the brick wall set last night and started building a real camp.
---
Wait what vendor
---
This was useful. Thanks both of you. 
---
How about a way to trade in perk cards? I have  6 lockpicking cards and 8 hacker cads when all you will ever need or use is 3.
---
That would be pretty cool for encouraging player trading too, just by putting people in convenient proximity to one another at a time when they are already in a buying / selling mood.
---
I disagree wholeheartedly. I've played both ways. My style of play is to have a permanent base of operations which evolves and grows over time. 
---
I get the simple , pick it up and go, style of camp too. That's how I spent my first chunk of game time. Bit I've got an extractor, and a farm, and water, and people who roll through for impromptu concerts, or a jump off the diving board. 
---
Simple is great, but I don't get to play a whole lot and like having a home. 
---
someone just droooed a nukr on whiyesprings here
---
Mods?
---
known issue, search 
---
I mean, it's the answer to your question.
---
I really hate that the Fermenter works like this. Just let us have multiple inventories in CAMP. -\_-
---
I believe grahm has them
---
I think he's talking about challenges, not quests. If you get a quest, then you will get a recipe. But the daily challenges aren't tied to what you know or can do. This has always been the case. A new player can get a daily challenge to kill a scorch beast which isn't going to happen.
---
Not true if you use unyielding AND sentinel. i can still easy solo 3 scorchbeast at once under 20% health
---
That‚Äôs fair, sadly I needed inventory space so I drank 2 last night.  
---
Oooh, I never would have thought of that! Thanks for the help!
---
Soda fountain upstairs and top the right of the main entrance. 
---
What dropped them?
---
You also need to have at least 1* Armor perk in INT
---
Nice. hell yeah I didn't even know this existed
---
Big oof man. I did the same thing with a stack of iodized meat before noticing I ran out of Rad Away
---
Thanks brother

Im using 3 armorer.

Data mining
---
Calling someone stupid is usually a good enough reason to get a few downvotes.  Even if they are.  Plus, OP is (arguably) wrong, which doesn't help any.
---
Subjectively speaking: Yes, it is a lot of fun especially if you have friends to play with. This game gave me a way to reconnect with a couple friends who ended up being long distance friends after I moved for work, and has yielded a couple of my most fun and "oh wow!" moments in gaming.
---
Objectively speaking:
---
At the absolutley lowest price a movie ticket where I live is $5.50. 
---
The average movie is 2 hours-ish. 
---
That is $2.25 per hour for entertainment, not including snacks and drinks which I could pass on.
---
At this rate, you would need to get ~17.78 hours of enjoyment out of the game to break even with the cost of a $5.50 movie ticket. 
---
If you were paying the full price for the movie ticket of $11 that would of course cut that time down to just shy of 9 hours. 
---
You can't even get close to level 50 (soft cap) in less than 18 hours so I will make the assumption that you have not yet reached the max level gear grind portion of the game, are still working through quests, and still enjoying the game 18 hours in. 
---
So objectively, if you get at least 18 hours of enjoyment out of the game, yes, it is worth it.
---
If you have the key for the tnt dome, go there
---
&gt;Reply
---
no thanks, if they'd double the level to 100 maybe or went back to a skills system for stuff like hacking or lockpicking . but 50 is way too low to be stuck with a build.
---
just an example....you know...ratios...
---
That Nuke Cola lamp was to die for!
---
I'm playing Bloodied / Explosive Heavy guns (.50 cal, gatling Gun) with sentinel + unyielding armor and a bloodied/crit build unmatched in PVP and PVE. Anti-armor/explosive are 2nd in my opinion
---
Yup, dome 7 shows needing a key now. Unknown if the key is actually in game yet though
---
Come on, it's not even on the first page of posts, I looked.    
---
It should be pinned for Christ's sake!  Don't need to be an asshole and downvote me like that.
---
Otried for 30 min jump in that building on top floor to pick up second card and i cant! Any tips? Am I missing something?
---
It's unfortunate. I think power counters \*STILL\* do not work. If you search "power counters" on this reddit, you'll see that it has been an issue since launch. 
---
It‚Äôs hard out there, I‚Äôll add you if I find one today I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs one at West Tek.  
---
That‚Äôs the main issue, there is no pen at all. Energy Weapons only deal in energy damage so they don‚Äôt gain benefit to perks that offer armor pen. A popular idea is to add energy resist pen. However, I think it just needs a flat value for pen to be added for both.
---
Gotcha. Would be a great deal tho
---
It's Vanguard leather legs. And I'm crafting level 1 leather legs.

Right next to hunters and zealots id guess.

Idk what the tnt dome is. I swear I explored every where and then findout about ths stuff.
---
The nuka drinks work with the nuka perks I forgot what it was callwsv
---
That is an excellent photo.
---
Literally been posted like 50 times a day since update. Look before you post. Stop using mods
---
search nuka cola tnt dome on youtube
---
The mods you unlock from scrapping pieces don't necessarily correspond to the body part the armor covers. So all those legs you're scrapping, you're also unlocking mods for the torso and arms. And some mods, like pocketed or studded, are unlocked separately for arms/legs/chest. 
---
How do you get the walls to be angled like that?? It looks so good!
---
Update: after trying and not seeing the plans i server hopped 1 time and got them with the key :) i thought i would have to do it all over again but you dont since you have the key üîë 
---
Entered my code, turned around a player took my key.  Great.  Trying to find a new set of key cards.  Tried multiple times, no second card.  WTF am I supposed to do, play server roulette?  
---
Did same thingg after readingg your post and i got it on my first try üôÇ
---
I've been running bloody-able with adrenal and a bloodied super sledge with swing speed - I run mostly full health while grinding, bloody during queen fights if I'm going melee. Been looking for a BE .50 cal to replace one of my TSEs.
---
Yes this was crucial, this is another aspect of a game inside the game, I spend hours and hours building my base &amp; tinkering with things, not just for me but for other players in the server to use as well. If you see me online try and find my base ‚ÄúSkywalk‚Äù it‚Äôs a beast with a nice defence and setup for everyone to use before going into site alpha(hint) &amp; My own personal wing as well which is locked up for me and my team of course. 
---
Also it would be cool if they made more holotape games and had rare rewards or loot for completing and /or collecting them. trading would boost as well, which is another aspect of the game I love.
---
You can milk anything with nipples. 
---
I lived exactly like you did before kids/ partner. I once took 3 months off work (i depleted my bank account, but had a blast), to play fo4 and screw and do drugs and fuck around. It was a blast for a while but I eventually needed work to keep me stimulated mentally (I'm a chef). I ended up getting super depressed when I couldn't get fucked up and game all day and I had to really wean myself back into real life. 
---
It took a lot of time and focus but I eventually got back to some normalcy (alcogcolic here, so  normalcy was 2 beers a night instead of a Mickey of liquor. ) and met my partner and life trucked on and I pulled myself out of a pit of depression and addictions. 
---
This doesn't answer your question but before I had my daughter we weren't planning on having her but are stable, tidy, I intelligent people with super loving families so we k we we could do it. Prior to meeting my gf I was depressed and had very little self worth so when she was super interested in 'the cute cook in the back', my life kinda did a 180. 
---
This is mostly anecdotal. Just do you, is my ending statement. I have an addictive personality, but I think the main thing is not getting so invested in the virtual world that you start to decline from the real one. 
---
And don't have kids. It's a nightmare ;)

I googled your exact title and found the answer in 3 seconds. That's why the downvotes

If you capture workshops you can fast travel anywhere in the map for free. They already do have the quest. It‚Äôs the workshops

Im trying to cut down on wieght at the minute, ive just about reached the oint I can walk around without power armour now so Im trying to trim it down a little more, thanks anyway though
---
Thanks! Was the first time I ever saw Grahm. &lt;3
---
Was just released with the latest patch this week
---
That's so lame. :(
---
How did you get the gun?
---
Don't think it's available on Steam, but other than that, spot on.
---
If you bought a car, and totaled it a week later, you still owe the money.  If Bethesda (or whoever) disputed the chargeback with a decent reason, you'll at the very least still owe the money.  I'm not sure this climbs to the level of fraud, but it's certainly a possibility.
---
2 months isnt that long to wait anyway so hopefully it'll be good
---
I think this is an upcoming feature 
---
My son was in the hospital for a condition very similar to Rhabdomyolysis (virally induced).  I was switching between sleeping at the ER and presenting at a work conference and ended up going for about two days on water and hospital soup crackers.  At the end of the episode I discovered I had actually ended up going cold-turkey on coffee without realizing it.
---
So essentially I could be unlocking mods for the Torso?
---
Just wondering, anyone encounter issues using the junk workbench? All of them worked for me except that one.  My toon just stood there doing nothing and no dialogue popped up and after a few seconds stepped away from the bench again. 
---
I agree; it's a pain in the bollocks when that happens.
---
Saw it this morning. Spawned event on my camp location while I was there.
---
A buddy gave it to me
---
yeah same, the could easily have just dropped all of this in that patch, but then after what, a few days a week? it'd all be done and we'd have to wait until summer for the next one
---
I can confirm it happens when shooting them with shotguns aswell. 
---
Going to wait a while for this to die down some I don't feel like server hopping a dozen times look for a one time server spawn key.
---
ü•≥
---
You know I had the app on my iPad but did not realise you could register and make notes and mark locations. Cheers.
---
yup, I got the Pneumatic torso mod from scrapping legs just yesterday
---
No problem. Your post made it sound like you wanted a harpoon gun . I understand the weight issues. That's why I'm looking to sell this beast even though it one shots almost everything short of scorchbeasts. Lol
---
As you are facing the Posiedon plant, the right side driveway...unranium deposit in the front between the gun emplacements, concrete at the other end of the same driveway.
---
I would love to see more veriaty in the seringer. Maybe a tracker dart that makes your target have the berry mentats effect for 60 seconds or a stim dart for healing allies but it has a 30 second cooldown befor you can heal them again to prevent it being to good. Have diseases darts that give sertant diseases. Obviously they would only work if both parties are flagged for pvp to prevent people just messing with people
---
Wow ...just entered the last building and the plans were not there...after 41 server hops...
---
&gt; Stop using mods
---
A better solution is to learn how they work and understand what you need to do when an update is released. It's not complicated.
---
That might draw people to attack it though too.
---
Great camp! I love the farm look.
---
ps, you want to buy Wind-Brahmin?
---
Wtf why have I never gone up there?! I want to make quantum grenades.
---
I love how, instead of anyone trying to make 100 caps, everyone is helping each other find one in game. &lt;3
---
...OK, *that* is kind of a dealkiller.
---
I‚Äôll be on in roughly an hour or so if your ready to trade then
---
Nah I just remember seeing it for sale at a vendor
---
I know right. I love this community.
---
This is a very good point I made the video this morning before the update and still had to jump a server to find it. Probably really hard to find now.
---
But at least you know how to get and and can get the key in the meantime. The key stays with you forever
---
Okay I'll keep at it then. Thanks a lot
---
Just dropped join up!
---
What you mean with "abusing"? If anyone in a group of players claims a Workshop, the entire group will get the owner and his squad flagged for PvP.  
---
There's nothing to report, it's how workshops are meant to be, it's not a bug, a glitch or something like that.  
---
I mean yeah but I don‚Äôt use mods in this game and I‚Äôm not on pc so I can‚Äôt give huge input on how to fix the mods. But yeah I‚Äôm not being a total dick cause i can see people are downvoting. This has been posted many times with solutions this entire subreddit has been filled with the same post 
---
I'm on PS4. 
---
Nice! I keep forgetting you can fiddle with color settings.

I sold about 32 of them to a vendor a month ago.. who knew they'd actually be useful

If you‚Äôre talking about Nuka Dark, that existed previously and Party Boy/Girl stacks with Nuka Nut on that one I believe.

I don‚Äôt run Nuka Nut but I‚Äôve heard that it has no impact on Nukashine. Thank goodness considering the bonus granted by Vintage Nukashine.

Coming!
---
Can confirm, I died twice in Watoga last night from melee on insta-bomb Legendary bots. 
---
Also since the 3/14 patch, has anyone else noticed that all the robots flagged as legendary, even when not showing stars, seem to move away from you rather than attack? The regular bots attack as normal, the legendary all seem to turn away and flee.
---
Weird.
---
Ya, was mentioned in the Patch 5 Known Issues sticky topic (long since buried).
---
Issue is Time is not the only aspect of whether or not an event will fail.  Could see 13 minutes left on a timer, travel there, and then find out it was 1% away from being a failed event anyway and it fails when you load in.
---
I haven't had much in the way of issues since the patch.  Loading times are certainly longer, but not by a whole lot.
---
IMO that camp may be part of the issue, I don't know how you got all that under budget (mine tend to be simpler, that thing looks nuts!).  Is your stability better when you're far, far away from that monstrosity?
---
(Seriously, I love the camp.  I can't imagine waiting for all that to load though).
---
Where did you find him?
---
That perk in FO4 was funny. It was awesome for groups of baddies, but horrible when there was anything friendly in the same area.  I used to not take it all the way to the "hit everything" level just to avoid accidentally making NPCs hostile... ;)  I bet it would work better in 76 though, less friendlies to aggro + pacifist mode. 
---
I saw a post about this earlier today! I haven't decided if I want to start playing again yet. New content is great but new bugs are not.
---
What about the 30 eyed squirrel?
---
just hop on to another server until you find the schematics
---
Likely only if you keep hitting the same camp.
---
I‚Äôve heard it does. I‚Äôm a melee build but haven‚Äôt been able to play since update so I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm right or wrong. Just stuff I‚Äôve heard. So I‚Äôve been looking into it. Maybe try and if it does work let me know lol
---
Is quantum paint the new "Kill Evan" ? lol. 
---
If someone else have picked them before you, you won't find them, they need time to respawn 
---
I would consider harassment to be verbal over the mic or sending them some kind of text message. Not sure about in-game features.
---
man if you had the PC version i would take it in a heartbeat. Im looking for any way to get this game atm, But alas, i only have a pc.

to whoever gets this code. Good luck in the wasteland and have fun!

Just got there 
---
how did you get the sweet armor? What is it called? 
---
Asking for my noob friend. 
---
I have some lvl50 t51, helmet, torso and the elusive left arm if you are interested. I will be on at 3am eastern standard time then after 10am saturday for most of the day. player name rb1955. I also have Nuka-Cola paint if you are interested. can repair to 200% also. can get the paint plans if they are there.
---
They werent taking the workshop, they were touching it just to initiate PvP amd show off theyre 1 shot kill weapons, then theyd do it again, and again, and again, you cant not retaliate because you still own the workshop since they arent taking it, they are simply abusing the system in place to force initiate PvP
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Nuka-Cola_Quantum_(Fallout_76)
---
And that's barely the tip of the iceberg, they're literally all over (though random, so that's really not much help).
---
Which, I don't have a problem with if someone worked it out, and then made a walk through. Because I think that's part of community. Helping people figure things out, that you have figured out or learned.   
---
But no one even got a chance to say, Hey, I found this weird thing in the bathroom...wait, let me rephrase that.
---
Hey I cant seem to send pm's on the app but id love to get that code so I can play with my best friend. He lives quite far away and I dont have the funds to buy the game at the moment so id love to play with him. 
---
How much did they increase it by? (Like by like 2 turrets or under 1 turret?)
---
I got killed by one yesterday, they wern't completely broken, just for some people.
---
In server joining now.
---
Wil he be my buddy to??

Killing players for caps is part of game bethesda designed. Period.

God I hope it worked.  I really would like to play on my main again.

I saw one pick up a minigun once. He was holding it with one hand like a gangsta rapper.

Yeah. The chance to detonate is not 100% but if they detonate it‚Äôs on death. Found that out the hard way one shoting one with melee out of PA. 
---
They‚Äôre probably unhappy about the weekly challenge. 
---
I like stealth and I crouch a lot of the time.  Partly because I like the "hidden/caution/danger" message.  Between it and VATS, very few thing take me by surprise.
---
Also, I like moving slow because I like exploring.  I like to take in all the details and find out the hidden little things that you can usually find in Bethesda's games.
---
I suppose when I roll my next character and the world is not brand new to me I'l do more "sprint here the go there" in order to level up.
---
A bit early for me, but so nice to see they have fixed the cool down bug :)
---
&gt;he second attempt I had successfully found the keys and opens the dome only to find that there were no schematics!?
---
Someone else took them before you.  Same thing can/does happen with the T51b paint.
---
Once you have the key to the dome you can just server hop until you find a server that hasn't been taken.
---
Nothing to "fix".  It happens with every world spawn item.
---
I've always kept them for healing. Was nice to have 25 of them when quest dropped. 
---
Definitely down with number 6! Good stuff man! :)
---
I ended up on a stage in the Toxic Valley in front of a microphone and chairs
---
I just moved my camp last night too, but before I never got a message like that, I was camped on the junk pile near top of the world, I hope I don‚Äôt get that message when I log on 
---
Im not trolling. Ive seen a shift in what the community considered "greifing" in posts regarding what is a reportable offense. 
---
Wanted to see how a post like this would fair, now that the community is starting to unserstand that PvP is not and never was greifing. 
---
Even when i initiate pvp at your camp
---
Even when i bait you with a bounty
---
Even when i gank you across the map because you own a workshop somewhere.
---
None of this is greifing and it never was!
---
I had them for healing too, then ended up wanting to conserve weight.. I kept the nuka cherries instead, due to them being everywhere.. stupid me!
---
Interesting, they did say backpacks would be customisable, I just thought that it would be a visual thing and maybe larger capacities but perhaps we're in for some other effects too. 
---
Whats the this quantum paint for 
---
True dat
---
One of the best things I did was move ‚Äúoff the grid‚Äù near the mountains yet still relatively central enough to fast travel in a reasonable distance to most locations. 
---
It made a big difference as I would constantly get bothered or griefed before.  You don‚Äôt want people messing with you then don‚Äôt build in areas that have a lot of traffic. 
---
Mine was an instigating sniper rifle.
---
Found that Legendaries with no star don't always explode.
---
Legendaries with one star did not always explode.
---
Two and three star legendaries...instant explosion.
---
We eat radroaches. 
---
This really grinds my gears, "In vats you will have a 95% hit probability but miss every shot until you leave vats and return". Talk about a waste of bullets. And sometimes because of server lag you're not sure if it's just not working, or if it's lag.
---
You on pc?
---
I‚Äôll build you T-60 calibrated shocks and a T-60 jetpack if you bring me the flux
---
To be fair, many people reading online wouldn't be actively playing and able to actually perform a trade before the user would be able to get one themselves based on the quick suggestions.
---
It seems the TNT Dome Key requires server hopping. I got the code but the door was already open and the key gone. Feels bad.
---
vendors will also have stuff that other people sell to them. 
---
Shit wait, PS4. Nvm
---
Just means they should do it.
---
No mods should I delete my ini files? 
---
Take the venom from a cobra and your left with belt. 
---
Basically let give everyone everything they want and never have a need to grind again?
---
It‚Äôs a blind drive forward. Didn‚Äôt get you want now? Keep going. 
---
If you are considered to be in stealth for any reason, you will not appear on the map. I've found myself bugged into a stealth state relatively often, myself. I don't choose to exploit it, but it does happen.
---
OwO whats this 
---
Adrenal bloodied builds are usually a troll tool. Through kill hoarding, or base breaking.
---
Damage is 39, ROF is 30. No change to mag size. 
---
Then after 60 seconds of chasing someone around to try to hit them you end up in a random location somewhere on the map.
---
It's relaxing. And a good "collect them all" thing. 
---
That's an interesting addition to the mix. Herr Starr legendaries drop better items so I could almost see that being on purpose making them more difficult. Or it could be one hell of a bug.
---
Just head over to the bunkers now the door was wide open and the plans were sitting there. That's how I stumbled onto this post. Was going to congratulate whoever found it but now I know they cheated. 
---
So you lied to get a chargeback under false pretenses and in Doug so may have exposed yourself to criminal liability, and want us to upvote your hare brained scheme so other people do it too? 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm gonna go with a no to that.
---
Reality can be whatever i want
---
Personal opinion, but I think BE is very over rated, I'm looking for a bloody fire rate myself. For queen especially - she just doesn't take much explosive damage.
---
unfortunately yes :( 
---
I gotta wait another 5 hours until I get off work so I can‚Äôt imagine how much worse it‚Äôs gonna be then on a Friday night 
---
Jeez, a bloodied handmade only doing 249? My TSE one does 446...
---
Exactly. Gotta experience the crusine of the post apocalypse. 
---
Very well said, sir or madam or Apache Attack Helicopter.
---
Tell me about it.  You just give up trying to defend Graygarden, cause you'll kill half the Mr. Handy gardeners in the process. XD
---
Yeah but at least if you get one of those with explosive it‚Äôs still okay. Beserker‚Äôs ruins any good 2nd or 3rd effects by crushing your damage unless you‚Äôre okay with 0 DR
---
X01 Power Armor.
---
Don't worry. You wouldn't have to do it. Although, I wouldn't be surprised if Bethesda make it an event. 
---
I‚Äôd imagine iodized meat would protect you from radiation, while ionized meat would subject you to radiation. üòâ
---
Yeah i agree ive put just over 100 hours in and still have so much to do im enjoying it 
---
I would be keen for that encounter at first. 
---
Oof. The science man is in fact right.
---
They added a report feature? Oh god, 5000 reports of ‚Äúhe beated me in pvps!‚Äù and three of actual offenses.
---
I hope they hired more than one person to go through those.
---
Fishing *in real life* is relaxing. Wasting time trying to "collect them all" in a pointless video game misc quest is... well, I'd rather have the dev team continue to work on QOL fixes, but and glitch patches. There's never been fishing in any of the modern fallout games, why people want it now seems like you're trying to shove even more bloated, pointless content in. 
---
That's what I meant.  The canvas and rum affairs where crappy deals by Bethesda and it wasn't helped by their initial response ("we don't plan on doing anything about it, have 500 atoms").
---
Critics and Youtubers, some of which were already latched onto these affairs as yet another demostration of Bethesda trying to screw over customers possibly driving people away from even trying the game.  Gameplay might not have suffered but the negative exposure affected the game.
---
I did everything, got into the Dome and the plan isn't there. :(
---
The risk of blackout justifies it being pretty OP in my opinion.
---
Rick is that you?
---
but you have the holotape and key you picked up? Picture of that?
---
How do i get it i assume its a fancy bew paint from the dlc 
---
Try bloodied melee. I have a bloodied SS deathclaw gauntlet with unyielding armor, talons, bloody mess, iron fist, 15 STR, and adrenal reaction. I run 15% health most of the time. Damage when adrenal reaction was positively bugged was 4k+, now I get about 2200. Bloodied is the way to go for insane damage.
---
On top of the monorail elevator are 5 bags
---
I honestly had no idea this was such a commonly asked feature, I joined this sub recently after a very long break from 76. Had I known, I wouldn't have brought it up.
---
Its going to be UGLY with that low of a ROF - sounds like the devs failed to look at mods when they made these changes.  I'll add them in a minute.
---
reported
---
Similar to the old 51b Nuka paint.  A series of key and unlock finds ending in a key for the TNT Dome 7 where it is hidden. 
---
Rifle gaming 
---
The idea is to make alcohol more readily available and craftable for actual use and not roaming the map hoping to find some. It makes growing crops even more necessary then before. I‚Äôll be crafting a ton of the red ant for +50 carry weight for fast traveling
---
would wreck peoples bloodied builds in pvp ;)
---
It‚Äôs usually how I get my best shots! A bit of colorization/desaturation goes a long way. 
---
Sweet I made a post on this and could find the key
---
Glowing meat for that thicc melee damage boost. For water, I rely on 8 small water purifiers
---
The hunger/thirst bullshit is still going, too.  :/
---
My buddy's X-01 armor disappeared from his inventory after he switched to his Excavator. Hope that was maybe something fixed.
---
Glass cannon they gotta be able to dish it out in nuke zones
---
I will always upvote fishing threads. Hell the game gives has 3 or 4 fishing outfits available. There's fishing rods lying around everywhere. Let me waste even more time in Appalachia by giving me the ability to go fishing. At least until next month when fishing season starts IRL :-p
---
Man i hacent even got the t51 paint cause i thought it woupd take to long guess i gotta actually try this ome out 
---
Combine it with a stimpack syringer to wreck bloodied builds in pvp... by healing them :0
---
This is really cool. Guess I need to find a place to get some calibrated shocks for my X-01.
---
How peoeple "datamine"? can you share a screenshot on how it looks?
---
Ive been TOLD i was reported over 10 times already. 
---
Jeez. Im just PvPing!
---
I walked up to a camp. I have a 200 cap bounty.
---
 Guy says "OH NO! ITS YOOOOUUU" apperently i wrecked his base sometime before. (I asked how he knew me)
---
Guy shoots me. I kill him and take his stuff. 
---
The  he says hes reporting me for forcing PvP!
---
I DIDNT PULL THE TRIGGER FOR YOU! LOL
---
Deleting custom .ini fixed problem!
---
I don't intitiate PvP as a rule, but if a former vault-dweller becomes wanted, I am absolutely going to put that mad dog down humanely, from a distance. No time for the do-si-do. Keep your junk, just make better choices next time. Your mileage may vary!
---
It's usually the first thing I do if I'm going into a long game session. Between my C.A.M.P "central location" Vault 76, and the 2-3 work shops I take I rarely pay more that 10-15 caps to get anywhere. That's without travel agent.
---
My biggest fear is backpacks won't work with power armor
---
1000 rad resist still wont be usable in red zone... most will be like the vox syringe, you play it once, novelty, and never again
---
Well yours is very detailed. 
---
Bloodied. My bloodied explosive DR lever does a thicc 750
---
Did you end up getting it?
---
Dude... it stopped being "Fallout" the day Beth took over, and The Brotherhood became an easy-to-join clubhouse, and, and, and...
---
FO76 is so far from what Fallout was, it's not even funny. Roll with it.
---
Enjoy the ban, OP.
---
You're going to Bethesda jail D:&lt;
---
Though given Bethesda's track record, there's a 60% chance they botch your ban and you're given more unreleased content.
---
yep!
---
I don't know why you are having trouble. Are they low balling you based on what you believe the gear is worth or by what the standard price is on the trading subs?
---
Either way if you have an aae or ie combat shotgun or pump let me know and I'll try to make you a fair offer.
---
So, respect at 50 then. Then... respect every 50 levels afterwards.
---
But I HATE this "change it on the fly" stuff. Flies in the face of what a role playing game is, to me.
---
How do u get that enclave tag
---
Just scored mine, thanks pal! It looks AMAZING. I only wear X-01 when I have to wear PA at all so I'm stoked.
---
Run and jump
---
I'm not sure they will.  But there is a high capacity and insulated mod as well as quite a few colors/designs.
---
Also options for catching an aggressive creature like a legendary Angler, something like that...
---
Slocum's Joe Buzzbites for instant AP regen! I'd make a million of those things.
---
i think they fixrd strange in numberd
---
I won‚Äôt claim I am a god at ranged weapons but I also have a TSE Handmade and using it, demo 5, bloodied mess, nerd rage, and adrenal, I dont get close to 446. Are you using bobbleheads or anything?
---
3 out of 4 encounters in the Mire, 1 in the Toxic Valley by the lake in Clarksburg.  Very rare, good luck!  Look out for glowing pink enemies as he is using mind control on them and they will attack.  Also listen for some Weird, kind of spooky science fiction music that will come up when one is near
---
This entire community has been wrong about what constitutes greifing for a very long time...
---
Chargeback fraud is a real, and chargeable crime. It's unlikely that Bethesda would pursue criminal charges, but they will definately permaban your account from the platform.
---
Do you have link? Cause if that's the case it's stupid because there's not enough dailies in the first place.
---
I don‚Äôt subscribe to that kind of thinking
---
Yep been happening to me too on ps4
---
The Nuka one didn't take that long.
---
It‚Äôs not bloated and pointless if a lot of people genuinely want it and enjoy it.
---
Plus, it has the advantage of making the world feel a bit more alive.  There is a precedent for this in the game itself‚Äîcritters like opossums, foxes, squirrels, and chickens add very little gameplay value and yet they‚Äôre there and it *really* helps make those areas between marked and unmarked locations feel alive.
---
Fishing would be one step further since there‚Äôd be that element of an additional mini-game to play as well.
---
Yeah.. hopefully, Beth gets better at hiding things from data miners. It doesn't help their games are all based on an engine that is so open.  I have a feeling they'll need to do some major reworking to get things to a place where it's faster for the community to solve something then to data mine it.  They aren't used to having to hide things.
---
Under Create post on the right side is a dropdown called community options.  In there you can set your flair
---
I got the paint! THANKS SO MUCH. it looks amazing!
---
First time I saw it was at my base at Cranberryborg. I was just there processing the nuked flora I collected, and suddenly heard this faint machine noise, came out and saw this little guy with a purple blob head and the facial expression of a scared child üò±. Very cute actually and I didn‚Äôt even want to shoot it until it attacked me repeatedly. 
---
If it‚Äôs something you really want and don‚Äôt want to wait for, sure. But IIRC all plans can be earned from events or founds.
---
Not the same... fish (bottom feeders especially) tend to accumulate pollutants in their flesh. It's why mercury levels are often high in freshwater fish, it'd be a constant circle of life of irradiated stuff being eaten by irradiated stuff, which dies in the the same irradiated swamp, to be eaten by stuff in that irradiated swamp... and on and on... l
---
Its just the thought and i didnt like skin really
---
Yeah you have to, you can't find everything, most are affordable anyway .. so find some, buy some, trade some
---
Legendaries still drop drills and syringes lol. This is dealt with according to patch notes...
---
You just wanna make sure that guy/girl you are talking to is as cute as their voice makes them sound. 
---
I‚Äôm on pc and people are very friendly that I‚Äôve encountered, are you on console?
---
That's not a daily 
---
But, can you drop em?
---
But... you just did... like... two posts ago!
---
You set an arbitrary definition of what Fallout "is"... so you... do... subscribe to that kind of thinking.
---
Ah that's good to know, thanks!
---
Yeah, but it's great for a water farm.
---
Everything was spoiling quicker, I made 2 Cranberry Relish as soon as I logged on, and 15 minutes later they were both spoiled, they usually last 3+ hours
---
Or it dies from another mob lol
---
Looks like I'll be off to the station, thanks!
---
A Scorchsquid appears out of nowhere, spams you non-stop with doughnuts of black ink, takes forever to kill, and then drops nothing but a tentacle when you do kill it.
---
I have many nuke cards collected but I‚Äôm not gonna launch another one until they improve stability on PS4. Half of the time I get disconnected in nuked zones within the first five minutes it‚Äôs just frustrating and the effort it takes to launch is not worth it. 
---
I got inspiration from Jug‚Äôs video last month on how to build round buildings. It takes some getting used to. Here‚Äôs that video in case you missed it: https://youtu.be/VpzPUmfv960
---
Definitely.  Otherwise you are spending months trying to get specific plans to spawn in locations.  Which are very rare.
---
The cause lies in the open world. A new character in the vault soesn‚Äôt crash. But as soon as I want to exit the vault my game crashes.
---
Why don't you just drop them?
---
I think there are some plans out there that would never be event rewards.  Things like camp decor, and power armor upgrades either never drop as loot, or are so rare you'll never get them. 
---
I just think of the times that games dropped in a fishing mini game that was just annoying to do for competion's sake. Fishing silver keys in the Fable series, Dark Cloud had a fishing mini- and none of them are any fun whatsoever. They're more annoying than anything else. 
---
Damn. That sounds strong af. 
---
Forge at camps, maybe. 
---
Forge at the Steel WorkShop, yes please.
---
Except you didn‚Äôt only say that.
---
I'm going into specifics to avoid replication of what can cause instability...  
---
It's like not explaining how to dupe something if you know how to, it's a no brainier.
---
Got up to the part where there's the card for TNT dome but the card was gone. No big deal. Server hop and collect the 1st key card again but the second key card isn't showing up. I've triple checked it's the right spot.
---
A black out would be devastating during SBQ.
---
Not taking sides, but this sounds like the whole "Fallout isn't a RPG because RPG isn't defined as a Role Playing Game" argument.
---
So, to give an example.. the VTU static spawn in the frat house was just released this week... I had to server hop nearly an hour and almost 25 hops to finally catch one that wasn‚Äôt already claimed. 
---
Remain vigilant friend.
---
Did that, and Fallout76.ini to get the most current one. 
---
Update: I have some Atom Shop stuff reappearing but I'm still falling through the floor. Bleh. I'll try deleting the whole game file then redownloading
---
It is. There are already a couple posts and video guides floating around.
---
Lost a 3 star legendary liberator that way
---
Not the stash of your character but the blue box labelled "vault Tec" where you store things. 
---
If you want to increase your inventory limit, you can mod your armor with "pocketed" or "large pocketed"
---
Also check out the white spring vendor, lots of camp plans and most reasonably priced.
---
I'd rename it, add a "_old.ini" at the end, then verify file, will rebuild it for you, check for a custom INI under your documents/my games/Fallout76 and do the same 
---
You‚Äôre the best! Thank you so much. 
---
I got locked in the room where u punch in your code and couldn't get out to get the tnt dome key... Couldn't fast travel because of enemies nearby and had to leave server lost all the progress....
---
Adrenal reaction is the big one. It‚Äôs a mutation that makes your damage increase the lower you get your health(15% for me). Other than that, I have rifleman 9, demo 5, bloodied mess 3, and nerd rage.
---
I have seen some other posts about this, but your writing style approaches this serious topic differently and definitely will  encourage more mature, in depth responses than the others I've read.  Thanks for asking about it in this manner.  Thumbs up to you.
---
If you play xbox add my tag Wildestknight18 for gameing
---
Was this base at Whitespring? Not right behind the clubhouse, but off to the side?
---
Nice, appreciate the help!
---
I thought about suggesting this, but given how anti pvp players on this forum are... I decided not to. I'd love it.
---
Just search meat bags at Super Mutant camps for insect parts - a lot of them produce acid when scrapped. Always pic up Bloatfly gland, Bloodbug proboscis, and Ichor sac from the meat bags.
---
Then why the hell would you stay on the same server 
---
I know, i grew up with a recovering alcoholic. It was because of growing up going to al ateen/al anon and some AA meetings as a kid and teenager that I am not a full on alcoholic or addict today. 
---
Thanks, it's really ugly. I was wanting to get an idea of total damage per fusion core and it appears to be about 50% more. Am I looking at it correctly? 
---
No offense taken from your post.  I'm just trying to add my voice to the chorus if such exists.
---
Plenty of the big name content creators on Youtube keep the FO76 negativity as a sort of punchline ("banned after 900 hours, maybe Bethesda is doing him a favor by not letting him play") and to be fair to them many of them did their review when the game was a glitchy mess and didn't bother with it again but will happily report any new negative that comes along and Bethesda doesn't when they do apparently rookie mistakes (reintroducing bugs because they used an old build for a patch?)
---
The only positive videos I find are from creators that are already Fallout fans and sometimes they are just shouted down as shills.
---
Reviewers time is limited and first impressions count.  Bethesda should have released this game in November as a sort of early access / beta test even if they charged for it and then done the official release once they got the issues fixed.  Again, their fault.
---
But this doesn't change the fact that the game is fun (if you like this sort of game) and not enough people who might like it are giving it a chance because of the controversy.
---
It's often cheaper to buy or trade them with players. I would try making a post for plans you are looking for on here. A lot of high level players give plenty away or sell them cheap.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Lol it won't let me. I can't use the bugged canned dog food or drop them and that goes for the Phantom Device device as well. 
---
If there are no other Bethesda games that OP cares about, banning has no real effect.
---
Fraud has specific requirements to be met, and while I agree that this likely would meet those requirements, OP does have an arguable defense that might make it tough to get a conviction.  He would certainly owe the money, but it's debatable if it could be **proven to reach actual fraud.
---
Sorry, I spend too much time in /r/legaladvice :P
---
That's a great idea, thanks for the help!
---
Very. When I go in power armor, I switch my unarmed to two hand, and get about 1.4k on my baseball bat. (bloodied, ss, all star, spiked rocket, etc)
---
Haha üòÇ
---
I can't drop or use them. I'm not sure if it takes weight or if it's just a phantom bugged items. 
---
Lol it won't let me. I can't use the bugged canned dog food or drop them and that goes for the Phantom Device device as well.
---
I just assumed some interiors were instanced, then the patch dropped and I entered a very crowded BIV's house...ughghgh...I feel like you'd have to put more work into that compared to just instancing it.
---
What size Creek are you talking about?
---
Because I just built a new camp along the creek north of Greg's mine supply. My house backs up to the creek on one side, and I made a bridge across the creek using two foundations where my farm is. 
---
So basically my entire camp is built within 2 foundation-widths on both sides.
---
It is a pretty narrow and shallow creek though.
---
No you‚Äôre fine. It‚Äôs juts RNG and armor especially has a low chance of teaching you a mod. I think some mods are unavailable to learn and have to be either learned by plans or acquired as a mod separately, like bought from a vendor.
---
What mods are you after?
---
He's waiting...till you let your guard down.
---
Just wait....
---
Seriously though, that's good news.
---
I strictly avoid PvP, and workshops open me up to that more. Also you have reacquire them, so they aren't permanent. Finally, they don't contribute to non-hostile interaction, which is what I want. Basically, workshops don't address what I'm looking for at all. I do appreciate the reply though. 
---
It's part of the game, especially because of wrecking ball perk.  This is an unforgiving wasteland, and with raiders, it's lore friendly.  This is a survival game.  No matter how much people cry about it, it's allowed.  Who cares if people think you're an asshole, the wasteland needs villains.  Otherwise we're all just playing fallout minecraft.
---
I think they are going to implement this!
---
Until then, here is a quick solution! Some guy was leveling me camp, and I didn't feel like engaging in pvp, so I just left the server. He destroyed like three walls and thankfully didn't get my decontamination shower. It was quick and easy. Swallow your pride, just hop servers real quick. It isn't accepting defeat because no one cares and nothing really matters
---
Have you logged out/in since they appeared?   Sometimes random visual bugs happen and they just go away after relogging.  
---
I think it would fit in pretty well with fo76 though, since there‚Äôs a base building mini game and a survival aspect built into the core gameplay.
---
You can decorate your house to have a pier for fishing (again, those assets are already in the game), and it would give another survival advantage for those people who build their CAMPs near water.
---
Currently the only benefit of doing so is for the industrial purifiers (pretty sure they removed the glitch in fo4 where you could move an industrial water purifier onto land).
---
I don‚Äôt think the mini game needs to be tough; for me, I find that something like this would be useful because I rely almost exclusively on scavenging for food rather than planting crops (no build budget left).  I‚Äôd hunt if I could but despite having my house in the middle of the forest I haven‚Äôt seen a single animal anywhere, so something like this would actually be incredibly useful for me.
---
One thing I will agree with though is that this could potentially be a lot of work, eg adding all those spawn points for fish in the world, and the work needed to make the AI for the gameplay to function and be fun.  They already have a fair bit of work on their plate so something like this would be a distraction from finishing the work they already have on time.
---
Does this work on Ultracite power armor?
---
3-5 minutes per fish is too much make it like 30 seconds 
---
I‚Äôm not in the know, but there are certain events that give a certain category of plans too. Workshops give a lot of camp plans. Power plants give generator plans, ect.
---
Fallout lore. Some cities and place never got built. 
---
I think Zenimax Online built ESO from the ground up as an MMO.  It doesn't even use the same engine as Skyrim and I don't see reused assets.
---
I had to remove my "Better Inventory" mod files.  Working fine now.
---
It's pretty narrow and shallow. I first figured it out because I just wanted to a chair near the water. I can place a foundation in the area but I still can not place an object (chair, etc) on that foundation.
---
my biggest fear is that they'll make my traveling leather coat look stupid while wearing it since it's got a built in backpack ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
---
Elder Scrolls online is a mmorpg. That's why it's won multiple mmorpg awards in the last couple of years.
---
76 is just an mmo survival game at the moment the rpg stuff should be added in the fall/winter. 
---
I haven't tried that yet. This is my first log in since last night. I'll give that a shot. What about the detection glitch. Do you know any work around to that issue?
---
The line is thin indeed, but in the lore you only die once. In the game you die and I can still come after you after that death... if I was going to grief you, I would do so near a respawn just to do it again.
---
If you're basing off final damage its 80% more total damage done per core.  But you're basically noodling enemies very very slowly to death.
---
I. drink. your. MILKSHAKE!
---
&gt; **Legendary Creatures:** Now always drop a legendary item on death. 
---
Not true. I just did Uranium Fever and the second legendary that spawned, a 2 star, dropped all the normal junk but no legendary.
---
Future content at some time???
---
Yeah I have no interest in server hopping constantly to hopefully find a key or the plans later. 
---
Ha shit! I was just jokin friend. 
---
LMAO, Savage but true
---
Turn down some of the graphics, see if that helps.  It might help smooth things out until the actual issue gets resolved.
---
I don't know what IPs are used for the servers, but I read that they're using amazon web services, so try to see if you can figure out an IP or domain that they're using, and run a tracert to it to see where the packet losses are.  If they're somewhere between you and the AWS servers, neither you nor Amazon will be able to fix it locally...it depends entirely on where the issue is (if that's even the issue).
---
Hopefully someone with a bit more experience (and time) can help you with those details, I'm not able to do a lot of research on it right now.
---
I hope so.
---
Happened to me this morning, scanned both key cards and the door never opened. 
---
Lol I'm glad you said something, I was about to do that. üòÇ
---
Yeah, I know. It's the classic way to farm people for caps and junk.
---
But still, it's how the workshops system works.
---
There has to be a way for people to contest workshops again and again if they fail the first, or the second time, I don't think that the Devs can find another solution to this problem.
---
Just change server.
---
I was able to place a fire barrel and the two new brewing stations on my foundations directly over water, with a porta-john and a power pylon right next to it, almost in the water. 
---
It must be specific to certain areas/situations
---
huh. I guess I haven't been staying current on the exploits, the guy I saw get into the vault replaced the doors with different textures/objects, and walked thru. I've seen the frame glitch get people on the top of cells, like the silos, but you had to be in the cell first. 
---
Has anyone tested fast travelling to a team mate inside a cell? Cause that would actually be useful.
---
Can the Handmade plans be found anytime now, or are they still level-locked?
---
No, it was by the lake at Site Alpha
---
Please Bethesda
---
The speed of the fishing should take influence from Far Cry 5‚Äôs fishing mechanic. 5 minutes per fish is unreasonably slow compared to the speed at which you can do anything else. 
---
That's my plan. Stopped last year at about 100 hours in so I could catch up on some other games. I'll probably pick it up again at their next content update. Division 2 and Sekiro will keep me occupied until then, i'm sure.
---
My game crashed right as i was about to pick up the key.... After about 4 server rotations
---
I actually want to fucking die
---
Also check the common dump locations, where people leave leftover loot that they don't need (suitcases/trash cans/cash registers near any of the vendor bot locations, particularly in Whitespring and Watoga).  I've picked up quite a few plans and recipes that way, and have left quite a few for others as well.
---
one of the people i was playing with wanted to try that route but I flat out refused. I'm here for the hunt. Definitely going to find the hint that leads to the terminal tonight when I get off of work.
---
&gt;I'm going to guess most of these companies will only bother looking into something if they get repeated reports of similar behavior from one person (that's how I'd do it cause I know people are going to be salty but if multiple people are complaining about the same thing then there usually is something there).
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure that's how it works. No one would take it literal about how Bethesda says they will look each report, unless their defination of looking is looking at a number.
---
Xbox add me Wildestknight18 
---
I'm really hoping he will be a static spawn wherever he is.  And invulnerable like Graham so he doesn't keel over on me (looking at you, Charleston responder bot).
---
I'm not even a pvper, more built for crafting.  But I've played survival games before.  I know the risk involved.  Gotta be ready to defend yourself.  Dealing with other players is half the game.
---
The people above me suggested that Fallout + Minecraft would be awesome, I expressed that *that* isn‚Äôt Fallout.
---
They weren't blowing up for me last night, but I'm not sure what the trigger is for them blowing up.  I knocked of several 3-stars and didn't see an explosion, but I'm ranged so that may make a difference.
---
SHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Joining 
---
I do get where you're coming from, and like I said if they would adjust the game a bit i'd be fine with permanent character creation.  i'd even be ok with them going back to the old way and letting bobbleheads and magazines be a permanent one time boost and not the temporary one it is now.  but as the game is now there just aren't enough possible points to be 100% set in stone. 
---
It is highly unfortunate considering what a simple thing it is.
---
Snitches get stitches
---
It was an intro quest, to an entirely new side of fallout 76. Intro quest gets you the basic recipes, returning daily gets you new recipes to brew new items that were never in the game before. 
---
on that note tho, i went back for day2 and was told to drink wine and test the agility, then asked to land a sneak attack. no matter how many sneak attacks i did it never registered nor gave me a new recipe for completing the daily... bummer
---
Easily 40, Which is what I paid for my copy, recently the only 60 dollar game I‚Äôve bought and not regretted is RDR2, in my opinion an online only game should not be worth 60
---
I should have added, after 475 hrs of playing, the first 3* weapon I found. And I‚Äôve taken down many 3*.
---
How
---
Have you clicked on the poster since then they are at the train stations
---
I'm in favor of both. I'd like certain perks like lock picking, hacking, scrapper, etc., to just be passive. But I'd also like to be able to swap things out on the fly. My build for example can easily double as a melee build or heavy guns build, depending on perk cards.
---
The fact it uses the tnt 7 key card even if the plans were taken already it messed up. 
---
It is funny to imagine OP explaining to his cellmate that he got charged for credit card fraud for NO REASON.
---
Everyone in the comments. "MuH RoLepLay, Y aRE You uSiNg GAme MecHANics!!!!1111!!!!
---
I just got it thank you so much! 
---
ok so i read the post you send and tbh none of them had the faction idea in them and tbh i did not check if there were any post similar to this but i would still say that even if i reused the idea i reused it to find a way to implement the factions system and tbh it would also be a great way to add the karma system because also in my opinion just replacing bounty with karma would be a sad way to implement karma since it would be cool if karma would actually do something and actually fit well in the factions in fallout new vegas would have been cool if you had bad karma that you would not be able to join the ncr
---
Deal with it. üòé quit complaining 
---
It's not jist camo nets, there are all kinds of lottle things, like simple wood planks that we could shift around to hide gaps that would be great for more natural camp designs. 
---
I really respect what you are doing and also try to make my camp blend in a bit, mostly by not using foundations for anything.
---
Evan said so?! But he's dead! Him and those lovely arms!
---
Where's wheeling? It was wv first state capital. Where's Parkersburg? Where is the Eastern panhandle? Some of the Eastern panhandle is in the DC metropolitan area we should be able to see the capital wasteland! Give us the northern panhandle so we can see the Pitt! Lol... 
---
Awesome! No prob
---
Im not saying anything should be brought against the players I know they just wanted PvP, but reporting for abusing a game system highlights it to the devs that the current system can be used this way and it brings grievances to players, especially when the solution, like you said was to change server (lose every workshop you own) and block them, but then the same people found us days later on a different server and did the same thing again, we were trading with Grahm then suddenly 3 of us were dead
---
Wrong thread maybe? I'm PS4 anyway.
---
Is it a limited time thing or can I wait until everyone calms down 
---
My character is ugly enough as it is.
---
Just got one after today's hot fix.
---
I would much rather be saying it‚Äôs time to dive back in. I‚Äôve been playing almost daily since the beta and feel like Nukashine made it worse. I‚Äôm not saying the quest and additional items are bad by any means. It‚Äôs just that there hasn‚Äôt been anything new for so long and it just seemed paltry. I have been spending a ton of time hoping to get lucky and find an XO1 jet pack mod to no avail. So the new content was a nice break. Until the next day and it was back to not getting that jet pack mod as my current activity. Made the constant server jumping seem all the more brutal. 
---
Yeah I have this issue too.  Had to watch a video review of the DLC to hear Biv properly.
---
He sounds a lot like Bender, actually.
---
Scrapping a Chassis won‚Äôt scrap the items inside.  They will just get transferred to your inventory.  
---
Dropping the chassis on the other hand...
---
Just found out the hard way
---
What detection glitch?
---
I was told otherwise. Apparently the devs put out a memo telling everyone not to? Im just going by hear say.
---
Jesus christ, they'll get here when they get here.
---
my camp didn't increase that much since it was really huge, maybe a 5% but ey! i could put the brewers and some radio now
---
Now this is an idea that has a good amount of potential. I'd love to see this implemented with a variety of different species of fish of varying rarity that each offer their own buffs when cooked and consumed. Besides the normal radfish, you could have a chance to catch something rarer such as a glowing fish, albino fish or even a two-headed variety.
---
You don't post them you report them with the ticket system 
---
The point of manually catching fish is to get that buff. Otherwise there is the floating net. 
---
Where it shows danger when no enemies are around. 
---
Not sure I want strangers that close to my camp.
---
I‚Äôm an idiot, thanks!
---
There is also one at the tattoo shop

Third day playing, I just entered the mire and found a watch tower. That's when the combat musc played and I noticed a green floating alien basted through the bush. I hade my friend tp to me and I took some screen shots. That same game session I came across a purple one. Didn't know they were that rare though. 
---
What platform? I‚Äôm interested if it‚Äôs a level 50. 
---
*You contracted Fornication Excreted Virus (FEV)_
---
Just trying to understand the basics:
---
1) The paired keycards are available to anyone
---
2) The code is server-wide and can change without your knowledge
---
3) The TNT key is 1/server
---
4) The Dome doors are either open or shut on a server - once opened, they stay open
---
5) The plans are *not* 1/server, so they can respawn
---
Is that right?
---
I never said endgame lmao you did 
---
I was told to post them on the reddit by other players. OK, I'll do that then. Does Bethesda really receive them? I know they do not reply. 
---
shhhhhhhhhhhhhh  this isn't new :P
---
Nice tip!!! But I have 1500 steel scraps!!!
---
He popped up on me in the woods near the pleasant valley station
---
Some of us consider it a feature. I like to think they added the weight capacity for mining purposes.
---
Just the other day my teammate accidentally scrapped his excavator power armor chassis during a junk run.  He then had all of his Excavator pieces in his inventory making him overencumbered and unable to fast travel.  I had to hold his armor pieces temporarily while he went to get a new empty chassis.
---
The issue is when people were just disposing of the chassis, since scrapping them is worthless (no items gained) people would drop them and move on.
---
i lost my camp 3 times since the update on wed. pretty rough when we spend hours fine tuning then have all of it deleted a few log ins later. i sent in a official bug report and made a small 3x4 shack that can be easily placed until the issue is resolved. this has to be related to the "find new server or stay on this without your camp" option, but somehow flags as being in a no build zone and it gets deleted instead with the 76 update has blocked the building of your camp at this location feature they just added.
---
A better option would be to stop having players show up on the map.
---
I'll be waiting for you on the other side.
---
Have you tried mining? It is pretty lucrative.
---
What do you mean by mining?
---
A villain is a villain.  They're out to make your life hell.  Semantics don't matter.  If they aren't cheating, then it's fair game.  Cheating meaning infinite health, flying, etc.  No because they outgunned you or you didn't see them kill you.  Just learn to fight back.  I realized all the pvpers we're using tse ( before the nerf ), so I bought one to deal with them.
---
I see them to buy from Harper's Ferry vendor a lot!
---
Yep, sort of the idea. I hinted at glowing and gold in the idea post. But didn't put them down as fleshed out to allow people to think of their own concepts for those. 
---
Your post history mentions your problems where the console beeps then shuts off.  I understand you play more intensive games but I still believe it is your xbox that is at fault.  Developers cannot code stuff that invokes that part of the xbox.  And seeing as how this doesn't happen to anyone else really, makes me believe this is your console at fault.  
---
Ok, then i was mistaken. DONT DROP IT!
---
Ironically these people are also the ones killing roleplay!
---
If they were doing it before, then this patch isn't responsible.
---
Likely it's just lag (which the last patch certainly made worse somehow).  They were dead before you got there, but it took the game a minute to realize it.  I've been seeing that for a while now.
---
Thanks again for all the great work. 
---
Tatteredfield jacket is like 2.5 k right? I don't think he has that..I kno if ur lucky u may get the longcoat 
---
Been this way since the start.
---
The manual catch on the chair is slow because it is there for a buff. The rod and net are how you would catch fish when you need them. the Net holding X amount and the rod costing bait.
---
I still have yet to find the plans for these letters. Any suggestions on where they can be found?
---
Same here if you walk in to the camp and see the key missing trough the wall ( will be open ) don‚Äôt slide 
---
i had some trouble with the greek letters as well.  The one that looks like a lower case N, when i tried to put it on my wall beside another letter, it would end up on top and floating about a bodies width away from the wall.
---
MUST. HAVE. NAU.
---
You're late to the party its been discovered since the new patch released.
---
snallygasters count?
---
Ah, news to me, I don't keep super up to date.
---
Rust is also not an MMO. Total player count is irrelevant, it's about how many of those players are all lumped in the same world. 
---
Or do you think we should count Fortnite and Battlefield as MMOs aswell? They're multiplayer, online and Battlefield at least has a much larger player count on a map than FO76.
---
Why have trumpets when you have the GOAT brass instrument, the tuba?
---
Doesn't that include a donut toss game like horseshoes, where you toss them towards the phallic iterations of the Fasnacht masks, hoping to get a ringer?
---
Your xbox or your router settings such as the ports. 
---
I get that... and I am saying that Fallout + Oblivion, at the time, "Wasn't Fallout" either.
---
Shit changes, man. You're literally playing "Fallout + RUST/ARK/Conan Exiles/etc", so we're Waaaaaaay past staying "true to what Fallout was".
---
Yes, I know I do not have to play it, but when they put ultra rare paint schemes, clothing, etc in the loot table, yeah. have to do it.
---
It doesn't matter.  People want to pick and choose what they want with this game.  It was built for multiple play styles including PVP, so they need to live with it or play something else.  I don't PVP but I understand the importance of it.  Fallout universe has always been harsh, it's all about perseverance.
---
I know, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. It‚Äôs not even remotely like an ES game, while FO76 is at least somewhat a Fallout game. 
---
[I guess so](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQZyuQGXc_8MAEV30Hgjqzr0hjGNIMcr7fSwWFcT2MBSJz5tE6Z)... although we have squirrels and the snallygaster.... so why not both?
---
That's hilarious in a morbid way. 
---
*WHACK WHACK WHACK!*
---
"He's already dead Jim!"
---
*WHACK WHACK WHACK*
---
"But he didn't give me my loot yet."
---
Because u can u purified water to make chems..s it would kind of mess up all of the other recipes..I kno sounds backwards
---
Reminds me a bit of the old iPod silhouettes 
---
Definitely a great idea man, one that I'm surprised wasn't implemented when the game first came out. I was just thinking about this the other day when I was swimming through a river and came upon a fish that I disappointingly couldn't collect or interact with in any meaningful way.
---
Yep, lost loot to a 3 star legendary protectron last night due to this. 
---
I uninstalled fallout 76 the day it came out and hadnt played it til i read that article. I redownloaded it all excited then realized I'm a male paris hilton. Fuck game stop and game informer
---
Inert was also made worthless and unsellable.   But the weight was reduced. 
---
Same thing here
---
Always thought more than 10 caps for an unstable flux was too much. I mean, stable flux sells for half the price right?
---
Some issues with being locked out of nukes for some people. 
---
It‚Äôs a guaranteed buy in Harper‚Äôs Ferry
---
It has to be so annoying to try an optimize a game for players like that. They should cap it at 600 and let those people whine. 
---
I was in the middle of a mirelurk breeding ground quest when it just suddenly ended while I was halfway through it. Kinda annoying. 
---
Good call.  Weird i get down voted on this,  lol
---
It was the closest thing to a 30 eyed anything. The squirrels are more like the rats with a different head. 
---
Don't worry, beginner mistake it happens :)
---
What system? 
---
how do u kno? Were u trying to join ur friends and couldn't?
---
Trying to invite pvp via Camp destruction, bounty baiting, workshop pvp from long distance.
---
None of these things are greifing. They never were.
---
"Clicking ‚ÄúReport Player‚Äù will open a reporting menu that features several reporting options, including: Cheating/Exploiting, Harassment, Offensive Name, and Real-World Threat.
---
Some reportable behaviors may fall under one of these categories. For example, offensive language can be reported using the Harassment category, and scamming or using bots can be reported as Cheating/Exploiting."
---
I understand your point, but if you are reporting players for killing you through workshops, in fact you are abusing the report system.
---
Apologies, PS4.
---
Critical information missing: What platform?
---
Haha okay I will delete this
---
Back to Mothman Omelettes for me....
---
It's in the capital wasteland.  Find a way there and it's yours!
---
XB1z just launched he nuke 
---
That was part of the adjustment, stable sells for way more now. 
---
I tried Nukashine for the first time last night when I came across a level 91 Legendary Death Claw (I'm 77). I put on my Death Claw Gauntlet and went to town. Woke up on a cliff next to a skeleton in a lawn chair surround by empty bottles. It was awesome.
---
I got you fam. I'm at work right now but can hop on for a few minutes later tonight around 10pm EST and give you one. 
---
Psn name: Colossernaut
---
I had similar lag yesterday on PC. Seems fine now.
---
From what I've seen the tattered field jacket is one of the rarest outfits. The traveling leather coat has been duped at some point so there are a few.
---
Here's a build I came up with: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f6365ba&amp;d=sd2sg2so2sp2p02eh2ck0c72a72a00a80a12as2lt2la2l71su2ic4pc2lu1&amp;w=&amp;n=Shotgunner
---
S: Max shotgun damage boosts, fast reload speed, and reduced damage from blocker are a must. Lighter shotguns are nice to have, letting you carry two or more shotguns for different situations.
---
P: Concentrated Fire and Skeet Shooter help your shots hit their mark, especially in VATS.
---
E: Not a lot of good picks here, but Fireproof is a great way to reduce damage from a source that usually hits hard. 
---
C: Lone Wanderer and Field Surgeon help your survivability, and the faster AP regen is useful too. 
---
I: Gun mods and slower breakage rates, must haves. 
---
A: More AP for VATS, damage from Adrenaline when you're fighting multiple enemies, and defense from Dodgy and Born Survivor. Enforcer helps survivability too by staggering your targets. 
---
L: Bloody Mess for more damage. Serendipity helps survivability greatly when you need it most. Starched Genes and Class Freak make your mutations manageable and better. 
---
Your SPECIAL stats come out to 15/6/3/6/5/11/10, which also gives you enough stats to equip useful cards for lockpicking, hacking, and crafting when needed. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt work. 
---
Cool, I'll FR right now. If I receive one before then I'll let you know.
---
It's all about stacking everything together, since all damage modifiers are multiplicative.
---
Here's roughly how it breaks down for my Bloodied .50 Cal, and why I do so much damage:
---
Base Damage: 46
---
Heavy weapons perks: 60% 73.6
---
Psychobuff (or similar): 25% 92
---
Adrenal Reaction: 65%?  152
---
Nerd Rage: 20% 182
---
Bloodied: 65%? 301
---
Bloody Mess: 15% 345
---
Adrenaline: 60% 552
---
Revenant: 50% 828
---
Tenderizer: 5% 869
---
\***I'm not sure about the multipliers of adrenal / bloodied. May have gotten a slight nerf with latest patch.**
---
And that's how it should be. 
---
Did I say they were?
---
Lost of people have posted about it since last update
---
Was a joke. 
---
Sounds good.  If you need anything else let me know. 
---
I've only heard of the bot having the longcoat..i def get those other two coats mixed up..but I do kno that I eventually want both..I have the longcoat already
---
Comparing those to Huntington is just false equivalence, flat out. They're important to the state's history, and very well should be locales, but quite frankly aren't as prominent. Huntington's nearly twice the size of Wheeling, and only a few years younger, and asides from a historical context, the impact Huntington's had on the state, and currently has in the modern day... is far more significant than the other two.
---
"Where is the Eastern panhandle? Some of the Eastern panhandle is in the DC metropolitan area we should be able to see the capital wasteland! Give us the northern panhandle so we can see the Pitt! Lol... "
---
This parts just downright condescending, and I ask for no such thing. Stop being ridiculous and putting words in my mouth.
---
Kudos to the man with the Big Brain!
---
Indeed, OP should have taken the three minutes needed to search for a solution instead of posting this.
---
My xbox is rather new, it is the minecraft limited edition from last year, my original got water damage last year. It hasnt got much use until 76 came out, and the ps4 went into hibernation and I started 76, rdr2, and forza. 
---
It's a rare plan drop from sbq
---
Go read the roadmap. The trailer didn‚Äôt have the dates on it but the roadmap that was release before that outlines the dates that the updates come out. 
---
After server-hopping, I eventually got my sneak attack challenge to work. I went to Watoga, and since the robots no longer attack me, I can get right behind Protectrons and still remain Hidden. I killed it with a powered melee attack and it satisfied to challenge. 
---
Worlds full
---
Most definitely! I can feel the hoarder in me already itching, so I'm sure I'll have a feel questions for ya as well.
---
Sell it to players? Craft it into stable and sell to players?
---
But unstable shouldn‚Äôt be 2 measly caps, this is my point. If stable is going to sell for ~50 each unstable should sell for 5. 
---
If it‚Äôs not crashing most other peoples Xbox I think it‚Äôs safe to say it‚Äôs not their fault.
---
Oof! You can use acid to smelt iron ore and craft steel. There is a spot by Hornwright site 3 that has tons of ore. The excavator armor quadruples ore yields and the Super Duper perk gives you a chance to double your yield.
---
Who cares?
---
Bunch of posts since the last update with people being unable to launch nukes, supposedly fixed with the hotfix released earlier today.
---
Is Inert flux good for anything?
---
I believe the timers for daily quests reset every 23.5 hours. So if you finished it last night you just wouldn‚Äôt be able to get a new one yet.
---
No, this ii a an older but that's resurfaced. I was standing just inside the door, and watched it happen.
---
I think May 7. Check the road map to know for sure.
---
This was the first update in a series of updates under the banner of 'Wild Appalachia' which will continue over the next 2-1/2 months.
---
This first update brought distilling and brewing. Next week is the Faschnact update. The week after that adds survival mode. In April you've got the Shear Terror event, Player Vending and Camera additions. Then in May they add the Ever Upwards Pioneer Scouts event -- this adds the backpack you're looking for. And then at the end of May there's the final Wild Appalachia update that adds the mysterious Legendary Vendor (Ooh. Aah.). [Here's a handy guide for reference.](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/3WheBXLAEMvTMFH70ejA9x/c38119dfaf0c67a3434df05b7d76d2c6/Fallout76_RoadMap_1920x1080_WildAppalachia-05-EN.png)
---
What are the stats of cranberry moonshine vintage?
---
It should be 2 measly caps. Enter a nuke zone and they are like everywhere. What makes it so special that something so easy to get should sell for that much?
---
&gt;I'm assuming you aim a nuke at a map marker - I've not launched one yet.
---
You don't have to pick a specific marker, you just pick a pint on the map and it will show the blast radius. If it's not exactly where you want it you can deselect it and move it around. There's a decent chunk of area surrounding v76 and Flatwoods that's off-limits, but otherwise you can drop one anywhere you want. 
---
It wasnt clear to me.
---
 I found your comment hard to understand. I just wanted to reinforce the message that "greifing" has been misused and misunderstood for a long time in this community. 
---
People are finally seeing the light as survival mode approaches. You can tell by OPs upvotes.
---
XB1
---
Let's also not forget those who are mute or deaf. Seriously I know 508 compliance  isn't exactly required in gaming but this is the first Fallout that makes it harder to interact if you have either of these disabilities. 
---
I like shooting stuff tho
---
I'm glad jukeboxes can be turned off
---
You know I thought this the other nights also. But I just reminded myself of everything else that's in the works and how thankful I am for this game. I go home every night now after a shit day at the office and it's the highlight of my day. I can't even imagine, with my limited dev experience, how long and how much work this whole world took to put together. 
---
I'll take it. I have a friend who wants in, but can't justify the cost.
---
Not surprised bro sooooo many people at SBQ 
---
Honestly, it baffles me. I can‚Äôt understand how these players don‚Äôt realise that this is pretty much how all developers handle levelling up in MMO games that run for years.
---
I mean, we‚Äôre all aware that our current level 50 legendaries will likely become obsolete in the coming years after new content drops too, right?
---
&gt;A mic, this one thing will make most of your trading experiences go near flawless
---
I got kids, and y'all got dirty mouths.
---
It being newer doesn't mean too much.
---
How did the previous get water damage? 
---
lol...not this seller.  
---
I thought most fished died out in the fallout universe?
---
Is the sheepsquatch perhaps unique to west virginia? As opposed to the Sasquatch being known/sighted all over north America? The common theme of the folklore monsters is they are all unique to west virginia.
---
Na man, Todd needs to personally go to his house and fix it, he is a lifelong fan after all.
---
I don't think so. I've been playing Bethesda games since TES Morrowind, and I love the company and their vision as a whole. I'm pretty sure the White Knights are the older fans like me that are tired of seeing everyone expect this to be a typical MMO or installment in the series. It was never sold as an MMO, and it's something they've  never tried before in this series.
---
that was meant for a different reply, but it went to your comment for some reason, when i replied on my phone.

Glad i dont play this fucked off game anymore. 
---
If one game crashes a system, and only that one game, you wouldn't suspect the game?
---
u/valseek
---
i got fifty eight wood left legs from a nuke zone at whitespring yesterday
---
I believe after trying 3 times it was somehow fixed during the patch 
---
Any idea why the first secret door in the Overlook cabin might not open? I did keycard 1, then keycard 2, and the door didn't open. 
---
They cant do that until they launch survival mode. 
---
Some of us paid for a pvp survival game.
---
30% water. That's about it
---
ONLY if we can also buy a cheap-ass looking Sasquatch costume in the Atomic Store... so we can stomp around and cause bullshit "sightings".
---
Not sure yet. I finished the quest shortly before calling it a night, so it needs a couple more hours (I assume) to finish fermenting. If I'm on later I'll try to remember to update. 
---
The Wendigo? NOT unique to West Virginia.
---
now all that is missing is the Vim paint jobs
---
No. It seemed like the quest started when I found the frat house and I got a marker to investigate. 
---
:)
---
When I moved my trunk was left open overnight in the rain. Bit of stupidity due to my mine and my wifes laptops being in the same box.
---
And the others?
---
There's a tattoo shop?
---
Can I see the green one?
---
Thanks asshole.
---
no I literally just tried it twice in a row after the hotfix, spent over 200  caps fast traveling and I need to get the paired keycards again...
---
thanks!
---
Thank you. I chased this down today. 
---
&gt;only happens with melee, 
---
Nope. Had it with gun too.  Though I think I saw it like once, but that was recently on current patch. Another thing is many times they don't explode at all. I really hate that because sometimes I wait a bit, it doesn't explode, I go to loot it and then gaboom. And I die. That's been around like months.
---
Even had yesterday this nasty thing, I saw some guy near Watoga transit, then continue forward towards the river where is some APCs on that bridge,  a frigging 3 star pops out of it's spawning box. I try to shoot the guy from afar, no reaction. I get closer to him while the bot is shooting me and I notice his kinda AFK. I try to spray him more on my explosive full auto figuring he might hear the impact on his character and wake up. Nope. Then I gave up, come around the bus behind which I was trying to hide from the bot. Somewhat oddly when the bot lost track of me , it had started to walk back to his corner, intead of noticing the other guy, who was standing there in open, while I couldn't loose the bot even when sneaking behind the bus.
---
I can see the bot and it's 3 stars still on my sight and I'm getting close so I can fire it well without only 20% of shots hitting(as full auto isn't the most accurate thing around),  then it completely vanishes while it was right under my sights.
---
I scoured the area but it was completely gone. I had of course tagged it in case someone else came along and quickly killed it, but there's nothing. No explosion, no body or it alive anywhere, I checked it's spawn, all around nearby spawns. 
---
Granted normally I just kill all bots I see, but it being 3 star and that other guy was so close there I thought I could be friendly but somehow it managed to backfire while the guy did literally nothing.
---
And besides these, I would assume everyone has seen how the bots instadie when their spawning box opens. Sometimes when you see it happening around, you might be lucky to tag them prior, but they mostly die the moment the box opens so it's rather difficult. So legendary bots like to more or less instantly explode when they die from their spawning box.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs impossible to get the tangled town ones now... server hopped 10 times and only found it once and the server crashed, second actually though but the first time someone caused an enemy respawn and trapped me in the keypad room by closing the wall 
---
1 cap once, I think it was when I played the beta
---
But if it‚Äôs the game, why isn‚Äôt it crashing other peoples systems at the same rate? Correlation =/= causation. 
---
The game files and data is the same for everyone. 
---
The biggest variables come from your system and your network.
---
A video?
---
Understood.  I still wager it is your xbox. This isn't happening to anyone else and they all have the same hardware as you. 
---
 No time for videos pal. 
---
It is, West Virginia is certainly unique in its utterly bizarre urban legends and folklore. But WV definitely also has its own extensive bigfoot lore like all other southern states do.
---
Don't hit me, because these will probably be lame suggestions, given that you usually get 55-60fps:
---
\- Update Windows 10 if that's what your OS is (MS had an issue with a previous update causing lag).
---
\- The really lame one: Make sure your in fullscreen mode and not borderless window mode.
---
I bought this game about a month ago. The way this game is publicly portrayed and how it actually is as a game is so vastly different it's mind boggling. $40 for this, with free content? Best money I've ever spent. 
---
I just finished it. So, someone was there before me. If no keys, server hope. Go and get a new passcode. Then try again. It should work, but you will need a fresh code everytime you hop servers.
---
Near vault tech university and frat row. Big Al's Tattoo 
---
I git in ty fir the invite, didn‚Äôt register my hits on the queen for some reason so no loot but still got event rewards. Everyone was frozen on my screen for like 2 min before I could see the queen.
---
Good luck.  This one will be frustrating until the hype dies down.
---
This isn't convincing enough.  Have you tried gittin' gud and then playing again? 
---
The assumption is 20 hours
---
Lmk if you still need
---
I was just pointing out that the cryptids in FO76 have no "unique to West Virginia" requirement... one exception destroys the rule.
---
Same here but 3 times currently on my 4 time but this time I‚Äôm going inside the mansion If i see the door open I‚Äôm not sliding and waiting for answers lol 
---
There was 10-15 people bro, was quite laggy.
---
Dropping another nuke on her now 
---
Not to be a negative Nancy or anything, but killing stuff and scrapping the weapons is kinda like, the easiest way to get steel. 
---
We got her. Was afraid it wasn‚Äôt going to work because of the cool down but the hotfix seems to me working nice . Been using a Furious explosive 50 cal and TSE Gatling plasma üëå they last way longer now with the update  
---
&gt;Also, I like moving slow because I like exploring.  I like to take in all the details and find out the hidden little things that you can usually find in Bethesda's games.
---
Nailed it
---
Maybe you weren't trying, but that was definitely a sick move.
---
Big bend tunnel has a large concentration of easy enemies close together though.
---
There are now more places where camps can't be placed. Some of the places don't seem to make much sense. You're just going to have to keep looking until you find a spot.
---
I have the key but everytime I get to the dome the plans are gone. looks like it's going to be pretty impossible to find these things anytime soon.
---
I can't make the jump in Tanagara please help!?
---
I found an unmarked vault yesterday. The area was a bit glitchy, like floating in air like I was on an invisible structure glitchy.
---
So I deleted the ini files, then the launcher wouldnt launch the program. I found the exe file on my hardrive and ran it as administrator its fixed all of the problems. I am not sure what change but I can no craft and aim. Thanks for your help.
---
This glitch happens after a loading screen correct ?
---
Ain't nobody got time for pal, buddy.
---
I have a vampiric ripper and went up against a vampiric bloodbug. I was healing, it was healing, we weren‚Äôt doing any obvious damage to each other. Had to switch weapons so yes it works well on fast weapons. 
---
Yes I've had it happen a few times and it always seems to be tied to aid items...
---
I‚Äôve even tried going in, clicking ok on the message, backing out right awa, and going back in. I still get the same bug. 
---
Im having trouble also
---
No, it just happens randomly.
---
The last time I was in a nuke zone and I just went to use Radaway and it locked up.  I had been in the Pipboy looooadddsss of times and done exactly the same thing and it was fine, then randomly, boom... it locks up.
---
Lmao definitely, and it has to look just like Patty
---
Oh sweet. Same here. Yeah I‚Äôll buy it 
---
Another option is to unpack and use Baka for it all.
---
Never had to touch my ini from any updates..
---
I think people who already have the key or just continuously server hopping and taking the plans at this point to sell them.
---
Waiting for the same thing.  Held out hoping it'll come back cheaper or part of a bundle. 
---
I normally hit up Point Pleasant, myself. To each their own, I suppose. 
---
Vendor in grafton sells them as well. 
---
I don‚Äôt think you read the part where it says *recommended*
---
Besides it‚Äôs not like they have to be your friends , chances are if you launch a nuke at FSP you‚Äôll get 8 or so players turn up anyway.
---
The point of the Scorchbeast Queen is that everyone in the server takes it down together. And it's not necessary to actually kill the Queen to finish the main story. The last quest finishes when you launch the nuke.
---
Also check the fair grounds in the ash heap. Gratz :)
---
My goal is to limit the time I spend vulnerable and not make it obvious when I‚Äôm there. Also, if the PvP player has to make a longer time commitment stalking me than I spend working on the workshop, I feel better about my own wasted time. 
---
I stay stealth the whole time that I can. I have my defense tower with generator and turrets all blueprinted and ready to go. When the defense mission spawns again, I just let it go to ‚Äúretake‚Äù and show up sneaking and try to make it quick to kill and repair.
---
Yesterday I died during the initial ‚Äúdefend‚Äù event. But I hadn‚Äôt put in much time and I don‚Äôt keep any junk on me so I just shrugged it off. 
---
Thank god for that, I thought it might be something with specific installation :P.
---
Out of interest, do you have any mods installed and if so, which?
---
Biking Fissure Prime, thus spawning the SBQ, is an optional step of the final mission. 
---
I highkey wanna see a fallout take place in Charlotte NC or Charleston SC lmao that'd be a fucking trip to play on
---
The bot in grafton also sells excavator plans and mod. the one in the city not at the station. 
---
And in fairness, it does say "new features!" over the Nukashine picture, while it has "new quests!" for the last two entries. 
---
Hey I just got the game a month ago, level 30. Add me - have the same experience/feelings as you.
---
GT is NotBestButOk
---
It doesn't matter if you click and exit, if the game has decided that's not a spot it will allow a camp, you're going to have to move. 
---
They do that sometimes.  Just last night I watched them all die and have fresh ones rebuilt in the pods
---
I am in the same boat as a solo player level 52.. Stuck on the last brotherhood quest... I haven't even gone to enclave yet.. So i spend my time doing events and taking over workshops... I spend the last two days looking for the nuka cola armor plan... And i dont even use power armour!!!
---
Wow. Nerve struck.
---
I started a month ago. Only teamed once for 15 minutes because a dude really wanted me to open a safe in the workshop I owned at the time and I didn't have high enough lockpick skill. Didn't pay attention to build, grabbed whatever perks looked good at the time. Probably how I ended up with two different Can Do perk cards, one at 3, one at one. Last Sunday I did my first Nuke run. Solo. Didn't watch any videos (although I did read articles on how to decode the nuke keys). Did it myself brute force without looking it up on NukaCrypt. 
---
Then I nuked Whitespring. Why? Because it was close to my base, and taking on the SBQ is an *Optional* part of the quest. I completed the main line quest with none of the things you claim are necessary. Heck, even fighting the SBQ doesn't require "PAST 100 REALISTICALLY". Servers only accommodate 24 players. And even though the Optional part says 8 friends, server hop and start your nuke run if you see a bunch of high-level players. Last night server I was on once the Death from Above was announced and highlighted Fissure Prime, pretty much all level 60+ players on the server Fast Traveled to Dropsite 9 because they all wanted a piece of the queen.
---
Harsh I guess everyone's jumping on the quest right now. The quest just came out Wednesday so everyone is excited to get it 
---
It only happens to me on some occasions , but it‚Äôs only happened after loading into the game or after fast traveling ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Likely. Seems to be the default for much stuff.
---
Sweet. I‚Äôll buy it. What‚Äôs is your gamer tag?
---
Are u tellin me you think the sbq is possible without more than 8? I jumped in on an event where there were 15+ level 100+'s and me. And we only got it half health before we reached 5 minutes and then the server crashed.
---
Best way to start a Friday night :)
---
This is all starting to make even more sense when combined with the oddball nuke timer and food spoilage. It sounds like they *did* bork something in the way time passes in game. Things that should take a few seconds happening instantly and things that should take hours happening in minutes. It adds up. 
---
i got it at 1st try god bless
---
Yeah. I wish i knew how trash all future offerings were gonna be. I wouldn't have passed the first time
---
Hmm interesting.
---
Do you have any mods installed?
---
listen out for the
---
**wubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwubwub**
---
I was at Mumford and Sons in Pittsburgh last night so was unable to confirm myself.
---
No, I'm not using any mods, it seems to be random. The last time was Harper's Ferry and I was attempting to drink a  purified water. 
---
The first M in MMO stands for Massively. 24 max per server is not massively. 
---
Jesus you need some empathy lessons 
---
Yeah, I used my keycards and the door didn't open. UGH. Still sitting in the basement hoping that maybe someone else will wander in with keycards lol.
---
Rad Ant Lager +50 carry weight without the perk and lasts for about 1 minute
---
With the perk however (3x the effect cuz its maxed out), ...also +50 carry weight and lasts for about 1 minute
---
I love her she‚Äôs got some great videos of fun spots to camp. The antidote to screaming drama filled YouTubers. 
---
Exactly. Yet I‚Äôm being chewed up by assholes saying I‚Äôm being entitled 
---
Excellent post! Ive been enjoying her videos for awhile now, and she does need more exposure. Her vids are highly recommended, especially if you are into building. Always finds the coolest spots to camp!
---
Reporting someone is bullshit unless they're hacking. 
---
The whole game end game is a real mess.
---
You don't have a f***ing copyright to discussions on Reddit. Are you serious right now? Screw this guy. Post it 50 times an hour until Bethesda adds it. Nobody gets originality points here on something RPGs have been doing for years. 
---
Translation: Just because 10 people on the server show up to kill the queen doesn't mean you're not playing solo. You still have not joined a group.
---
They definitely reply. I have submitted tickets with issues and have gotten replies within the hour. Make sure you submit a bug report ticket and not a feedback ticket. They do reply, although it may not be a helpful reply all the time, in which case you can update your ticket and continue the conversation. 
---
Two shot is really bad for a VATS user and overrated in general. Anti-armor or Instigating is the way to go.
---
I think it's like the saying "I could care less."  While it should be "I couldn't care less", people have gotten it wrong so often that the incorrect version becomes the norm as is generally accepted as correct.  In the end, we know both versions mean that you do not care.  So hotfix has been misused often enough that it's generally accepted as meaning the same thing as a patch/update/fix regardless if the server is "hot" or not.  Not saying it's good practice, but possibly explaining why.
---
This does not cost steel to get steel. You just need acid and cloth.
---
Party boy did nothing for my Rad Ant Lager - gives +50 carry weight for about a minute with and without the perk
---
Okay thanks.
---
I have a couple of "quality of life" mods installed that make managing inventory a bit easier, so was thinking it could be that but it clearly isn't.  I asked the author of the mods whether this could be caused by their mod and they said highly unlikely. 
---
Thanks for responding!
---
I'm not complaining that it's here, but I don't enjoy it at all. It's not a good mental place to be in.
---
I'm also hoping it comes back, but am pretty sure its going to be expensive -- although I bet the horsemen (if they're in the shop) will be even more expensive.
---
I was also in a fight nearly identical last night and as soon as we started shooting it crashed the servers. And I have no idea how you pulled of a solo nuke in 1 month (sounds fake) but some people have lives they have to take care of as well.
---
I'm realizing that's dumb, of course no one else on this server will have keycards, I just grabbed them. lol @ self.
---
Can you please acknowledge the broken camp issue after the latest patch and let us know if anything is being done to fix it and when? The "A Fallout 76 update has prevented your camp from being placed" pop up happens every couple log ins, no matter where i place it. Very frustrating as we need our camps, love our camps, spend HOURS fine tuning camps, then it gets deleted with the above 76 update message. Then I go move it, start rebuilding it again, spend HOURS fine tuning it, then it gets deleted when I log back in. 2 days in a row and HOURS wasted ;(
---
I did submit an official report/ticket thru the bethesda website, but if you play how much a lot of us play you know how important camps are to us. Thank you
---
Valid point.
---
Ohhhh ok that makes more sense I was confused lol my bad 
---
I like slapping the shit out of stuff with my DCG that does 2200
---
I found a way. Instead of running towards it go a little back of the building to the right. There is a tree on the left going up. Climb it.
---
I get that but all the build up is to it. It wouldn't be the same without doing it.
---
It's pretty common, Grafton and Camden have sold them for quite some time.
---
I'm stuck on the red ant lager quest, where is a good place to find ants
---
Cry harder, I‚Äôm almost there 
---
Are you saying you've tried 3 times and it hasn't worked? How do you tag Bethesda staff lol. 
---
\*raises finger\*  
---
Yes. Yes I do!
---
Appalachian Antiques, luck Hole Mine, that power electrical place outside of Watoga. Use butcher's bounty too 
---
I haven't been active on reddit or 76 on PS4 since November L:
---
Then I guess you do not need a lot of steel.
---
The perfect setting mixed with the perfect filter.
---
This is really good dude!
---
I know but it doesn't always go that way. If you launch the nuke and no one shows or the server crashes (I've seen both) you need to re do the whole stupid process.
---
Server hop to the bunker if the door is already unlocked your plans might be there
---
Embrace it
---
BY going to AAA meetings.
---
I wish they could change it so instead of putting up one letter at a time, instead just type out the word then put that up
---
PVP is great and all, but lore wise you'd be a psychopath you left the vault to rebuild and renew (american) society after the bombs.
---
So yeah, you'd legit be a raider which is cool and all but don't get defensive when people aren't cool with getting raided. If peeps are salty its prolly cause they've been fucked over by peeps similar to you and what you do. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Ah crap, that was my best way to make cheap caps. :(
---
&gt;Yao guai
---
I know this is an old thread but there are always Yao guai  near Dolly Sods look out.. (Might help someone else).
---
but i also like shooting stuff with my bloodied explosive lever that puts 750 on the table
---
At what point does it crash? If you can load into a and then it crashes, it could be a corrupted file. All you can do then is restart a character. That would suck, but you also can‚Äôt expect bethesda to be able to find and fix a rogue corruption in one guys game. 
---
I guess me not seeing them is a result of getting in a grind rut. Hit the hot spots for xp and materials and never return to some other places... I dont recall him selling that stuff the last time i was here. Grafton i go!
---
I'm going to drop a FAT nuke on your base if you siren spam.
---
They need a "hide from trade window" option we can tag our stuff we don't wanna sell
---
Honestly die and addictions are lost
---
That seems to be fixed. I have successfully used sneak many times today and I can go and stay in [HIDDEN] now.
---
They reworked some of the clipping on foundations and second story floors in order to prevent other glitches. Short of breaking apart your camp and replacing pieces/blueprints individually it's unlikely there is another fix. Use it as an opportunity to make it more aesthetically pleasing!
---
It was useful until MapQuest came out.
---
Tried four times now lol now the difference I didn‚Äôt slide the cards when I spotted the door open 
---
Do you really think that an opposing viewpoint that disagrees with yours is an empathy fail? Should they agree with you or be jerks if not? I hope that's not your position. It would be hard to...have empathy for that.
---
Try the trade subs
---
Stock up on addicitol 
---
Bigshotsasse. You don't want to discuss price?
---
While the game is intense on the consoles, I‚Äôd wager the water damage may have made a component in the Xbox that helps ensure a game doesn‚Äôt nuke the hardware much more sensitive. Something similar happened to my old iPhone after I dropped it in the sink, when I‚Äôd open a lot of heavy applications it would heat up then shut off
---
Ahhh, the Ole Shameless plug Routine ... 
---
 "For the last few days I've had my Trading Shop "Ticturd Trading" up and running and just wanted to give a few suggestions." 
---
I see what you did there ....you Ticturd You... 
---
Maybe I'm in the wrong website then. Feedback is the only feasible option on the website I'm on. Can you send me the url to the correct website?
---
I had the same thing, I couldn‚Äôt kill it but my friend could
---
They can be, but I use it so I can do *some* damage. Everything I have is sub par.
---
r/woosh 
---
I need some stimpaks I just started the game too lol 
---
It‚Äôs about a combination of weapons, perks, tactics, chems, and prioritizing targets. I find that when dealing with the queen it‚Äôs easier to neutralize other enemies as they will do a decent amount of damage themselves. 
---
I dont think u give anything. U just talk to him
---
Don't drink.. :)
---
I'm not your buddy, guy
---
Maybe you should just try it and see what happens. The entire server runs down there to take it out. Shotgun isn't totally useless either. When she lands is when she takes the most damage. Blast her face with the shotgun, get crits along the way, you will have significantly helped to take her down.
---
&gt;I'm not in a rush for a whole new questline, because despite what this sub thinks MOST players are not level 212 with 7364553 hours played and have done 665 SBQ runs.
---
Yeah, the subs dedicated to specific games seem to be bad about this. If you only read r/DtG and didn't play it, you would think that most players already have Thorn and are already 700LL. 
---
Just [here](https://i.imgur.com/YRtsg6I.jpg) :)
---
Level 110 here, I‚Äôll help ya out with whatever you need and build you some good shit
---
That seems incorrect but I don't actually have evidence to prove you wrong.
---
I haven't played in a few days since I was shipping ny PS4. Also love camp building. I can't wait to see how much budget I get back!
---
Don't ever stop drinking. you get no penalty as long as you are intoxicated. That's how you overcome addiction
---
Ohhh, thanks so much.
---
Ok, I just know that people were saying that they disappeared after level 45(?) I believe it was.
---
Just dumb luck.  They existed before this patch, and since.  Just rare.
---
I bought both of mine after Patch 6.  First one after 12 server hops specifically for them.  The second just randomly one day last week when doing my vendor sale run.
---
Yeah, I agree. I thought it was pretty clear the main draw for the latest update was the *ability* to make alcohol, not the quest that introduces it. 
---
I'm sure dozens of people trying at the same time isn't messing it up at all.... 
---
Just wait a week for the hype to die down or just keep server hopping and trying again
---
Did you update your mod? It works fine for me after the update.
---
Its why a junkie build is pointless it ya die all addictions are removed. If you get downed though and revived they stay.
---
When ppl see a nuke about to be dropped on fissure site prime the majority of the players on the server will flock there..u don't need to be on a team
---
But in the beta i didn't know about the end as no on reached it. So my perks were all crafting/some shotgun stuff. It is unfair that you need to basically build 1 of 2 specific character archetypes to kill thr SBQ. Especially when I never knew I had to. I cant kill a flying SBQ with my shotgun. And I can't take damage in a nuke zone without PA.
---
Damm - pro-tip!
---
what are the fallout 76 called.  i seen one called fo76 markets before but cant find it again.
---
Lol, I fall this bug into the "funny bug" category. It's not as bad as that loud banging noise bug that used to happen but it's funny enough to confuse those that don't know what it is
---
I hopped over 500 times and no luck from. January patch till now. Still need one more though. 
---
I‚Äôve been playing wasteland and fallout since you were either in diapers or didn‚Äôt exist yet
---
Or you work in a group. What platform are you on?
---
I'm a guy, but not yours, sis.
---
Sometimes yes but it doesn't change the other stuff (which is more important)
---
Playas gonna play... RNG gonna RNG.
---
I'm on ps4.
---
Nope I play on console
---
I've actually found SBQ to be significantly harder (well, spongier) with more than 4 people. I run a watered down/un-fixed crit rifle build and I was able to solo SBQ (I burned through a LOT of ammo, stims and radaways) so it IS doable alone.
---
Also, melee/shotguns are amazing at SBQ.. my fastest SBQ was me, a melee and a shotgunner.. she was dead in like 2 minutes. She only came down twice but that was all we needed.
---
What level? Low fifties, mid sixties?
---
I thought this actually was a fix. The Robots explosion timers were somewhat random anyway. I'd never search a legendary robot before I finished a count of 15. I can see how this would suck for melee characters though.
---
I've seen about 12 SBQ fights, been in 3, all either got 1 or 2 players or failed.
---
I have one I'll sell you for 3k caps, if youre on pc
---
I'd rather have them falling down dying then to have 4 billion of them everywhere lol I couldn't even get to the doors not to long ago, this was outside..
---
I think I had to look up David's info on a terminal or something. The holotape on the counter by Rose maybe? Fred's BBQ is his hangout.
---
I'm 55 or something.
---
Not even an MMO dude
---
Professional Drinker, if you don't mind using 3 perk points. 
---
&gt;And does leaving a beverage in the fermenter longer increase the effects?
---
Once it's fermented, it's done.
---
That said, a few of them do have more than one stage of Fermentation.  Like the Nukashine can be fermented further to "Vintage".  You should be able to tell by whether or not a CND bar exists.  If it does, it can be fermented further.
---
I dunno. I was told I was addicted... but literally nothing changed for me. 
---
Just keep drinking.

---
The fact that there were 15+ level 100s is irrelevant , the more people that are there the higher health the SBQ has , its health scales with the responding players basically.
---
So your build is set up for shotgunning and the like? Any perks for meds or chems?
---
I'm just seeing what leg mods are for the leather legs and then my Trapper arm. Have a couple good Cavalier and Sentinel pieces so I wanted to try to upgrade them as much as possible

The reporting system is not an automated system. Reports will be looked into and evaluated by our Customer Support team. I hope that alleviates some worry about being falsely reported, they can tell if its a bogus report just to report.

Sigh ... post-hotfix, one of the key parts of the puzzle is glitching out, not letting people proceed.

Very true

Ooooooh. Maybe that's why I never see effects. One of my characters "house rules' is that, when thirsty, at least one bottle of booze has to be downed before any water. 
---
That would explain doors already being open, but not my issue of the door not opening after sliding the keycards.
---
How do you even get fresh wine the only thing I get out of it is the base wine
---
I just hopped a couple times, no open door. Le sigh.
---
What lvl?
---
Yeah, it took 3 tries of press the talk button to both trigger the quest and finish it. I suggest to press the talk button, let him finish his line, rinse and repeat until it triggers

Hi all, we're seeing your reports on food spoiling quickly following patch 7 and we're looking actively looking into this. Thanks for bringing it to our attention!
---
Im really shocked they didnt port over the Fallout 4 dirt plots you can make. 
---
Camden is the name of the fairgrounds.
---
ok cool thanks!
---
Seems to be anywhere from 2 hours to never getting it ever again from what I've been seeing lol. But there doesnt seem to be a sure answer, probably the amount of time it takes for a vendor to reset. 
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
It's a windows issue.  Something is stealing focus from the game and forcing it to minimize.  Unfortunately due to the nature of PCs, it's very difficult to tell what program/application is doing so.
---
You can start by shutting down and disabling background processes until it stops occuring.
---
Thanks for the reports on this! We're investigating to see what might be going on here.
---
np :)
---
a dragon? Really?
---
So I've spent about 500 caps so far travelling to and from the various locations, only to have the code given from Ingram manor denied every time at the Outlook Cabin... Anyone else experiencing this?
---
I'm guessing most players have an adventuring loadout and a crafting loadout. Honestly, I think some perks should just be passive to alleviate this problem. Ideally I don't even want to think about changing perk cards :P
---
Nothing but that perk that makes them heal 80 percent ir whatever. I had no way to see the perks so my build is a mess if 1 or 2 star perks and irregular special stats. Totally useless. I hardly even explore anymore because my perks for damage mean it takes almost 50 shells to kill a high level super mutant.
---
I had no way to plan it because you can't see perks from the start and don't know what they will be.
---
As I said you have to run the repair.  
---
Fallout 76 "page"  --&gt; Game Options --&gt; Scan and Repair
---
Yesssssss
---
Thanks for the reports on this, we're investigating!
---
They really need to improve the burn effect as well. It does no dmg.
---
Try nukes and dragons, the let you test a build and show you how much of each special you need. Figure that out and then see what you need to reallocate in perks
---
Naw.
---
Appalachian Alcoholics Anonymous.
---
Nukes and dragons will help look it up
---
Probably related to the new bug of food spoiling quickly/hunger and thirst going down quickly. They probably sped up the timescale of the game, maybe for purposes of fermenting drinks
---
We're looking into this one, thanks for the reports everyone. Will let you know what investigation turns up.
---
Wdym nukes? Also are dragons considered shotguns?
---
Honestly best way is this. I think this why they made the distillery honestly, gives you a high enough quantity of drinks to keep buffs up and debuffs off. The challanges are just more insentive to leave it on give a drunky build a go.
---
Nice..always check the vendors to see what some players might have just sold to them
---
Yes it is new...apparently it is vault 65 according to datamined info
---
Since Patch 5 or so, Mid January?  The big vendor plan change.
---
No it‚Äôs a website that lets you make a build and shows you perks and what special points you need for the build
---
After level fifty you can re select a special point in lieu of a perk card, so you may have to grind for a bit before you get the perks you want
---
I actually had a guy run past me into my house up my stairs to my workbench. He worked on something, at this point I am turning on my headset to say hi. I here a woman in the background oh you shouldnt and a grown man laughing as he put a tse shotgun round into my nuclear generator. This house is in the middle of the map not even on an area that has a junk pile or lead or anything. Yeah I have had a wave of grief on ps4.
---
Just a spa it takes 45 minutes real time to respawn it so server hopping is not needed... i went up there on a whim to get scrap and it was there 
---
I have soloed the queen on a dead server before without even bothering to gear up heavy beforehand. She scales by the number of players so frankly ive found she is easiest to solo or duo if your server is empty 
---
Commenting for later
---
Isn't this a mod, not a standard feature?
---
Have you tried recently? There are more high level players that join in now. Maybe try launching one on a server you know is full. I'm sorry that has been your experience, but it hasn't been my experience all. I've managed to kill the queen with maybe 8 other players all chipping in 5 times now. 
---
Good luck!
---
I got one on PS4 today too.  X-01 mods complete!
---
And powered doors
---
This would be GD fantastic.
---
My only addition to this is I would prefer some sort of fishing minigame over just sitting there and getting fish. It's always a fun thing to do to kill some time in games like this. 
---
* glowing fungus soup
---
* silt bean soup
---
* carrot flower nectar
---
* glowing fungus pur√©e 
---
* deathclaw steak
---
* soft shell mirelurk
---
* glowing meat steak
---
* yao guai ribs
---
Sorry for your run in with that. 
---
I can definitely help you there, add me on psn, my username is the same on here and there
---
Wait until every single player isn't trying to do it, so that you don't have to worry about people beating you to the punch.
---
Grab the poster for free in the Atomic Shop, hang it in your camp, activate it, and do the quest proper. It involves a speakeasy, a drunken bartender bot, a secret recipe, and testing its boozy produce. 
---
Drat PS4 here I had a extra one
---
It's in the forest, it triggers for me literally every time I go near the overseer's camp.
---
Kept looking for this and finally found it - already have it learned probably from a perk pack.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve never seen that feature. 
---
Westek, roboco, the over look by sugar grove as well as sugar grove 
---
I am udderly shocked at how amoosed I am at this.
---
I got it at front of the resort and I died while getting the trophy 
---
Desk fans, hot plates, toys, all great sources. Scrapper perk. Sugar grove has lots of fans and springs. 
---
That doesn't sound right,  but I don't know enough about substance abuse to disprove it. 
---
Its a completely new quest
---
Adding now.
---
The problem is people taking the key, etc. before you.  It's a world spawn item it seems, not instanced to each player.  So if someone took it before you, it's not there until it respawns again sometime later.
---
Like the weights in the Flatwood Gym, only if it was locked behind a key and two cards.  :)
---
Nice colors!!
---
Something similar happened to me as well.  A bunch of players wearing hazmat suits inside Whitespring wanted to trade.  I finally accepted trade from the lowest level guy, and he wanted every weapon and piece of armor I had.  I could see that he had at at a couple of TSE weapons already, so he really shouldn't have a need for a .50 cal hunting rifle he's not even a high enough level to use.
---
As I exited the trade and went about my business, the whole gang of them started hitting me with slap damage.  No matter where I went, they followed, so I had no choice to jump servers.
---
I think sugar grove is good been awhile since I farmed for them tho. I know for sure lots of springs there.
---
Thanks for the guide
---
My concern isnt false bans. It's you guys having to sort through hundreds of false claims.
---
I hope you mean to climax because I just reached it and am riding it out now!

Oh boy, now i feel extra stupid for never seeing it!
---
I do still need it, I fell asleep lol 
---
I used to run cannibal/carnivore as well. Really makes life easy. But I dropped it for other endurance perks so I needed a new food source.
---
Still a running joke that all of us in the Bowler hat gang are secretly cannibals.  But we all found other stuff.  One guy is practically living off yao gui meat.

&gt;**Events**

&gt;  
---
&gt;**STATUS:** We are assessing different options as the suggested approach of adding the event timer to the map will not provide accurate feedback about the actual status of the event. Each event has different event failure criteria that correspond to the specific gameplay challenges in the event in addition to the overall timer which is the maximum amount of time players have to complete the event objectives successfully. For example, in a defense objective, the object(s) being protected could be nearly destroyed but there could still be 15 minutes left on the overall timer. While we explore options, we hope you continue to provide your thoughts and feedback on our Events.¬†

Leave out thru the first door you entered and then go up to the left around the side, you can just walk up to the jump bit
---
This reminds me in skyrim I would always set the time to the early morning hours 
---
Thanks! Loved the filter and it really brought out the green veins! &lt;3
---
This would be cool because Fallout76 is what I'm using to stitch my heart back together over Red Dead Online.
---
I will still their heads off
---
Also of note is that if there's a Drill or Syringer, that's the "legendary" loot. 
---
Stay drunk ma brother stay drunk üëç
---
It's just a new introductory quest that gives you new things daily, it's just a small taste of what coming
---
Are you a leader or a follower? Play the game and judge it yourself 
---
Real reason is due to how the engine works 
---
Does scrapper perk get you screws?
---
Fixed now 
---
I may be wrong, but I don't think there is a Nuka Quantum paint job for the X01 in Fallout 76. And the NukaCola paint is specifically for the T51. 
---
No worries my GT ATXlien so just shoot me a message on there and we‚Äôll link up whenever 
---
I‚Äôll take that too
---
You can always start a new character without losing your old one, but I was 60+ when some of my friends started, 100+ before they hit 40-50 ranges and they nor I have ever had a bad time with co-op, until I felt like I had completed too much. I‚Äôm just coming back after a few months because they‚Äôve added more content.
---
That's still not harassment
---
Man I can't wait to have a TSE story like this
---
The group is very unsuccessful seeing as Biv is everyone's sponsor
---
Nice! I just got the tick blood recipe to make today so I‚Äôm stoked!
---
screenshots? sounds like a serious error, lol
---
That does make sense, I'll be looking into that. Thanks.
---
And party every day?
---
&gt;  Some of us didn‚Äôt buy this game just so some jackass with a two shot explosive to come into our camps and level it, wait for us to repair, and do it again.  
---
This is pretty garbage logic. Your intentions when buying a game don't equal what the game is designed to do. It's irrelevant that you don't like player interaction, that's a core game mechanic.  
---
Also just server hop man. This isn't rocket science. You're playing the victim while allowing yourself to be victimized. Its kind of pathetic.
---
&gt; It‚Äôs honestly ruining the game for me 
---
You must be doing something pretty wrong for this to happen often enough that you get this upset, which is bizarre. Either your camp is right beside white-springs golf course, in which case too fucking bad, or you're putting it somewhere else where players feel the need to destroy it. 
---
I'm not even arguing that they shouldn't make pacifist extend to the players cap, or that the bounty system isn't broken atm (Cap condoms being the biggest problem imo), I just cannot stand this sort of entitled victim-hood that a small vocal minority of the player base embodies. It's a multiplayer survival game where other players are meant to be raiders, and your constant insistence that you shouldn't have to interact with them is getting old.  
---
You aren't the victim here, your a stubborn child who's upset other people exist.
---
The original Nuka Paint is 51b
---
There was a new Nuka Quantum Paint added in the patch this week, it appears to be for X01 only.
---
Define explosive guns
---
I may have misunderstood from the notes I read. Hoping you can clear something up for me.
---
If I find, say a "Bottle of Whisky" at some random place in the game.  Will putting that in the fermenter give it increased buffs?  If yes, how long will that take?  I think I have 14 hours and nothing I've put in there (Beer, New River Red Ale, Vodka and Whiskey) haven't changed.  Did I totally misundetstand?
---
How do you mean? They work fine now, but the damage was nerfed to a fixed %increase in damage rather than it being amplified by the demolition expert perk which made it OP. Still powerful just not overkill one-shotting scorchbeasts and stuff
---
Then ignore the better alternative, whatever.
---
Ages? Literally 30 minutes of my life. Got it all on the first try.
---
Ah ok, didn't notice it before. Thank you!
---
Must‚Äôve been a bad server. That happened to me a lot when the game first came out, but it has drastically improved. Haven‚Äôt had a crash on a Queen for a couple months honestly. 
---
Solo nukes are super easy when you know what you‚Äôre doing. I can run through a silo by myself in 15-20 minutes. It‚Äôs actually way easier solo, because less enemies spawn. 
---
Yeah, i had no turrets pre-patch, budget stayed the same for me, now i have four small turret. Will need to turn them into missile turrets someday.
---
Dude just wait a week. Right now it's the hot new thing to get. I probably won't even try until a week or so from now. I've done my share of server hopping looking for X-01 mods I ain't doing that shit no more.
---
One sec, it‚Äôs pretty bad, ALL I WANT TO DO IS HAVE A NATURE WALK AND SEE A MOTH MAN! Is that too mush to ask Bethesda?
---
I‚Äôve got him right in front of me, telling me to stop‚Ä¶ even though I‚Äôm already standing still. 
---
I learned the hard way :D 
---
I have about 6500 atoms saved up now waiting for it to come back. 
---
I can do both paints
---
they see do be featuring a lot of "secret doors" in these quests, i really hope they let us craft them 
---
Ok I‚Äôm on rn
---
If you switch to a Borderless Window mode (can cause performance issues for some machines) it can eliminate the minimizing and instead just cause the window to go inactive until you click again.
---
Could also help you identify things popping in/out of your taskbar or system tray as borderless window tends to switch between focuses much faster than a full screen mode does.
---
Where the wouldn‚Äôt do any damage.
---
It made only melee viable.
---
Couldn‚Äôt kill anything.
---
Guns with the explosive affix.
---
I watched a Lvl 128 player hiding outside Dome 7 waiting for someone to open the door. I waited and watched instead of opening it. A Lvl 92 showed up, and when the door opened, L128 rushed inside and stole the plans...I server hopped until I got them. Probably 10+ times until they were there...once you have the Dome key, you keep it. 
---
I wish it will come back some day but doubt it. It's an exclusive and we might never see it again ;-;
---
The damage bug is fixed yes, they just also nurfed the actual damage they do.
---
Have another drink yo.
---
That's fixed, no worries
---
That's what I did. Saw this post and I've been meaning to get over and finally get the standard Nuka paint so I just popped over to check out 7 and the door was wide open with the plan just sitting there. 
---
Was her scaling adjusted in the last patch, or did you just have a good build team?
---
wendigos do have amazing loot drops
---
I was very pleased with the light cost reduction (and surprised at how expensive they apparently were), I finally had enough budget to build that bathroom my camp so desperately needed :D
---
I think I know what OP is refering to. You mean the bug where enemies would regen their HP if you did too much damage? That's been fixed. However, Two-Shot and explosive weapons were nerfed to only be a 25% and 20% damage increase, respectively. That said, explosive is still one of the best effects you can get on the 2nd legendary effect slot, and is only really outshined by 25% fire rate, and then only on single target.
---
thanks for doing the beta test
---
I'm glad you're having a good experience, I decided to try it again for the first time since release, walked out of the vault and fell through the floor and died.
---
do you read the patch notes???????????????????????????????
---
I just signed in. Friend request sent. When you accept I can join and FT to you. 
---
I think they have made some adjustments but not sure lol. There was 10+ people there both times, most of them level 150+
---
It took 10 minutes to kill her 
---
and the cast iron stove should be lit from the inside.
---
Try to look under Technical or In-game support. Look for which one most closely matches your issue. You may not get an exact match, in which case, choose something similar to start a conversation and then you can directly communicate and detail the issue.
---
&gt;Picture link: https://imgur.com/a/L5FOaMM
---
Pretty sure that is from the Tricentennial (Collectors) edition.  I can craft it, have been able to since day one. 
---
If you're doing quests together, as a team, the quest will only complete for the Team Leader. So if you've already done some quests alone, you can team up with her later, make her the team leader, and re-do them no problem!
---
I swap between Party Boy + Travel Agent and Hard Bargain depending on what I'm doing. Basically drink when I'm not selling stuff haha
---
Rock all night and part of every day
---
Yes, with a speakeasy in the basement hidden behind a secret wall. 
---
It's only available to Tricentennial Edition players.
---
My lord, this is fantastic.
---
Look there‚Äôs not even a mission to get the key. It‚Äôs all random. How did I spoil something that has no directions. It‚Äôs not like you or anyone else would randomly solve the puzzle on your own. That‚Äôs why Bethesda made this randomness. So people talk about it. Fuckin duh 
---
Thanks for letting me know. As long as I can actually damage enemies, I‚Äôm happy.
---
Fuck this game lol
---
Thanks, looks like I‚Äôm reinstalling.
---
r/fallout is the other direction for needless, unreasonable bitching.
---
When were they bugged?
---
It may have nothing to do with weapons. I‚Äôve killed about 20 legendary robots in Watoga since the patch and had only two explode in my face. Most that exploded waited like pre-patch. 
---
Clarksburg should be directly south about 40 miles from Morgantown, but instead it's to the northwest. I grew up in Fairmont, which is between the two and home to Prickett's Fort, but the city itself isn't even in the game, and the fort is way further north, above the Golden Palace, which my memory places closer to Wheeling, which also isn't featured. Granted, in-game explains that version of the fort is a reconstruction.
---
Anyway, my point is that the game really doesn't get things right in quite a few ways. It would have been nice to see I-79, but that was built after the timeline split in WWII, so it makes sense that it isn't there. 
---
Swiped my cards and THEN realized the door for the keys (not for the keypad, that door didn't open) was already open and the keys gone. :(
---
It's available only to games made with Steamworks toolkit.
---
I think it does when you break down weapons and stuff at the benches. Low level scorched and hunting rifles are great for steel and screws!
---
At first I thought u meant the parade masks
---
Not a bug! It's a feature!
---
I would say, if both players are past Lv. 50, it doesn't really matter. But the disparity between Lv. 50 and Lv. 10 could be frustrating, since enemy levels are always skewed toward the player with the highest level.
---
On the other hand, if you do scout ahead, you will acquire plans and low-level Legendaries that could give them an edge early on.  Craft stuff for them that they wouldn't normally find at their level. 
---
You could submit a ticket with screenshots / video to Bethesda. 
---
I have won two Corvegas (cars) from prize bot so far. Eventually I will find my rightful prizes and claim them.
---
How does the team-leader system work? is it based on who invites / who hosts or can you just swap out the leader on the fly?
---
She is so thirsty!!! No, I mean when she records videos her character is always in the red, thirsty.
---
Hard to swallow pills
---
Fast traveling to 76 triggers it. You know thays a free trip and can save caps going to the northwest of the map tight?
---
Atlas used AWS too and the latency there was ridiculous. More than 100 people on a tile = unplayable lag.
---
This is the only place i can currently trade due to the other sub reddits requiring i have a account of 2 days or more(had to wait a day just to post here) i tryed three different trade subs so if anyone has xo1 shocks for sale please send me a message. ( just started this account to  get the shocks and I'm almost ready to quit due to 1000 rules and restrictions on every sub reddit) 
---
I just got my hands on my first one.  Explosive shotgun and it does wonders 
---
They should add in like a 1% or lower chance after drink # 100 that your character just randomly explodes, ala Bloody Mess... :)   
---
(this would translate to your character exploding like 9 times before you found an X-01 Calibrated Shock)
---
Thanks for the break down, there are a few things I am missing here!
---
not really a spoiler when its in the open world accessible to everyone.
---
Strange. I saw thirst going down slower today. It was much higher before.
---
My friends hate how I don't have a mic lolol
---
Food/drink/hunger/thirst was sped up after the WA update. Just an fyi
---
From launch until the blackbird paint drop.
---
I remember getting that before quitting. I think they had just dropped the patch so people would stop losing their camps.
---
Not sure when they fixed it. But that‚Äôs the period of time that I played and it was consistently bugged.
---
Haha glad you enjoyed it! Will be dropping another one on her in a hour or so! Feel free to add me as a friend and just join or keep your eye out for another post on here 
---
The Scorchbeast Queen exploded on death and killed me last night. I thought it had evolved some new, arcane power. 
---
I don't think much of the core fanbase wanted a MMO or this MMO lite. Most people wanted a real Co op game with real choice, dialogue, and roleplaying. Not some cheaply made on rails story that's tagged on to a game that's made about grinding. 
---
He's a random spawn.
---
I mean, what was broken with it?
---
You can promote someone to leader at any time.
---
I‚Äôll go and do that, as soon a si figure that out
---
Nukes are going great üòä
---
k so i would but your sunny indifference, kind personality, and fan boy mentality have really got me attached to you. I couldn't bring myself to leave you.
---
I just rebuilt it from scratch a while ago and I got the same error when I moved camp 
---
Noice.  üéÇüéÇüéÇ
---
Cheers anytime . I spoiled a random non mission for you. You would have never figured it out on your own anyway. So why you mad bro?
---
I think these could be attributed to reports I‚Äôve seen in various games including fallout 76 that occasionally a patch can fix an issue for some users but create that issue for others who didn‚Äôt experience the issue pre-patch
---
I just want to jump in the water and catch fish with my bare hands, Skyrim style.
---
You're seeing blast zones? Since the patch, I have not seen a single one.
---
Me too it must have been a bigger fish to fry kinda deal. But at this point I think those fish have been fried. 
---
Thanks man. I took a breather and I feel bad that people think I hate the game. I really do enjoy most of my time but grinding for so long just to be hit with this feeling that I was being punished for being around since the start really got me going.
---
Ok seems that if the door behind the keys is open don‚Äôt slide the keys since the key has been taken already save yourself the fast travel cost and painful load times lol 
---
Dropped 2 nukes on the scorchqueen and she was dead with in 10 mins both times üëåüèº also dropped at whitesprings and it‚Äôs working as normal lol
---
I‚Äôm just talking in general. Haven‚Äôt played today after the update. Just wanted to know how to farm them, basically to keep the enemies respawning.
---
Oh
---
Pure luck, I got the jetpack today, still need shocks though
---
One guy, speaking on behalf of everyone, and less than one minute after the post was made.  That's not an answer, it's a smart-ass retort.
---
Is the key consumed when you open the TNT doors?
---
My camp is in the same general area as Vault 76.  So I‚Äôm good there.
---
I agree with this, and I actually think there are minimum levels in areas, but they probably are a bit too lenient. I can't imagine getting to Cranberry bog before level 60+. Even ignoring side quests you'll sill be 50+.
---
I submitted the ticket. Hopefully I get a reply.
---
Thanks you! 
---
It is from the Tricentennial edition.
---
Source: Don't have it but been here since day 1 of B.E.T.A
---
Nice build
---
Yeah, and yet Snally gastesr and Wendigo are some seriously strong enemies. Same goes for Assaultrons (tankiest regular mob in the game and they're only level 42 max...)
---
They would glitch enemy healthbars and make it so no firearms would deal damage, you had to relog and it was only a matter of minutes till it glitched again, or melee everything. Either way. It wasn‚Äôt fun.
---
I'm gonna post here something similar to what I said in a different thread. 
---
There has never been a fun fishing mini game in any game in the history of gaming. 
---
The devs should focus on fixing the current game, not add your ridiculous fishing pipe dream. 
---
If they got to the point where we *didn't* have problems with existing quests and every other new thing they're working on came out problem free, then maybe I could see it. But the state of the game now, this is a worthless endeavour. 
---
Go play a fishing game if you want fishing. 
---
with the new budget I think Im going to make a legit CAMP, like 6 6x4 buildings + general store. I think it will work
---
That's your opinion; imho I think it's great. I think the story is EXACTLY what it should be 25 years after the bombs fell, and the "NPCs" are all scorched and ghouls right now. If you pay attention to their clothing you can see that they are all the residents that left the notes and holotape behind. I love the dynamic, and the fact that even if you're playing solo you'll still run in to other vault dwellers because those are supposed to be the only other people around.
---
It was always going to be something different, and they said that. It's an excellent prequel to the series, and I for one am excited to see what happens.
---
Does anyone have any solid How to C.A.M.P videos?   
---
Really in depth stuff. I am trying to learn some advance C.A.M.P building ways.
---
Lol it's hilarious, they will pick up the highest damage weapon they can find, but they don't have attack animations for them, so they will just hold their gatling laser / fat man / missile launcher with one hand awkwardly and grunt at you while strafing.
---
Oh, yeah it was fixed. Then they nerfed it because they were unbelievably OP
---
For example, when you're exploring Greg's Mining Supply, and you get upstairs and see the ONE ghoul in the whole place dressed like a mechanic. That's Greg. That happens all over. The airport is filled with Scorched in Responder attire, the camp grounds and watchtowers have ghouls dressed as rangers, the Poseidon energy plant has Scorched in Poseidon attire. It was always obvious to me what the implied message was.
---
Here's a link. You're on your own from here.
---
Rejoin the same game by having a friend stay there.
---
These things may cause enemies to not respawn:
---
* Not all enemies cleared in the area.
---
* Players standing in the spawn area.
---
* Goo / Ash piles can prevent the spawn of the specific enemy spawn that they are linked to.
---
* Server really laggy.
---
This is exactly what I needed. Thank you very much.
---
Fresh isn‚Äôt a thing.  Once it is vodka it‚Äôs done.  Just use that. 
---
Calmy explain that what im doing is an intended feature in the game. Im farming caps and resources... It isnt greifing at all. People need to underatand they are playing a pvp enabled survival game.
---
This is clearly a different vault...
---
HOLY FUCK THANK YOU
---
What really? Then why does it say "Fresh Vodka" in the daily quest? Damnit.
---
Ok, fine, you called it, after it was already known. Good job? Do you want a medal?
---
Wouldn't accomplish anything since scrap isn't needed and character would still be overweight from the 25 or so weapons dropped as well.  Might as well dump them to mule to sell (what I was doing)
---
I'm level 98 and would be happy to come trash! Wait im on ps4 if so GT: Fromager1nMN
---
When I try to generate an access code, the terminal says ‚Äòaccess denied‚Äô. I‚Äôve got the two key cards. What should I do?
---
People hoarding them lol 
---
None of my daily quests are triggering. I've gone back many times and gotten nothing so far. Kinda shitty having the daily challenge be something pretty much unobtainable. Should at least have the boozebot sell the damn drink required to get it done. 
---
Game is all fucked up for me. Freezing and crashing way way way too much. I'm killing robots in Flatwoods a little bit ago and guess what they are dropping? Halloween candy. Some serious problems and not being able to get the damn new recipes to even trigger is not cool. 
---
I'm on PC so I don't have that option. Thank you though, I have noticed building seems easier on the consoles.
---
People still play this thing?
---
Wow good one. Still doesn‚Äôt change the fact you‚Äôre a douche bag
---
 I just kill the sucker. Two steel, is a prize I can use. ;)
---
Equip Endurance Perk card \*professional drinker\* when doing the challenges. or... stock up on addictol. I used to vendor it down to 15 of them all the time unil the new update. Now I've held it in reserve cuz you never know when someone in your group might need it.
---
This can be crafted? hmm.. Beth should have a page of masks for sale in the A$..
---
Well, guess im Drunk Sock :)
---
So basically griefing people until they attack you. I think that's what I said. 
---
Use my 3\*Furious Grog w/ 40% + swing speed or my Vamp Grog w/same buffs  if I have a stand off shooter in a mob and circle if possible, but I have learned to start my swing earlier also and I hardly get any blocks either anymore
---
Sup, I'm Hungry Turtle
---
Just so you know you. You don't have to brew anything. You can buy or find whatever biv wants you to drink and it will progress the quest. If it says to  brew it or ferment it in the quest log you will have to brew it. 
---
You ever think some people just want to talk about the game? On the subreddit for said game? Not everyone is a reddit addict and sees the same posts. Sorry you are
---
I'm assuming to differentiate it between vodka found on the ground or one previously made.
---
Wasn't too hard for me to get on Xbox. I did have to get the key cards twice because I didn't notice that the TNT card room was already open when I swiped. But I found both key cards again on the first try and got the TNT key on the same run. Then I only had to server hop three times to find an unopened TNT dome door with plans inside.
---
Just started playing again today. Now I can't play because the ground decides to completely disappear and I'm stuck in an endless loop of falling to my death until the game crashes. I'm not exaggerating when I say literally unplayable.
---
That is jsut your personal opinion. I Have had a lot of fun with fishing mini games and so have many other players by the looks of it.   
---
Please do not spew your personal opinions as if they where facts. 
---
Lol yeah that happened to me last night,  left me with a sliver of health. I thought it was intentional and kinda cool.
---
How about vendors who don't use a mic? Ran into 2 of them in the same day. I rarely see vendors on xb though.
---
We killed SBQ last night on the server I was on. 
---
I like this a lot.
---
I only approve as long as their are Trash Bees. you know? those really angry mf‚Äôers.
---
aaaaaaaaaand nevermind, changed worlds and got all my quests back
---
That was a couple pastiches ago 
---
The game really isn't that hard, you don't NEED to min-max shit to "get a decent build", you can easily with a FEW banked levels, make any reasonable build.  
---
And if you're doing scorch beast fights, you don't NEED to move away from shotguns anyway. Get a GOOD shotgun, or get a GOOD melee weapon (seriously, bloodied builds are fucking OP in this game, and high str, which you need for shotgun builds are also needed for melee builds) and go to town when the bitch lands. 
---
Seriously, the issue isn't the game, in this instance. The game is fine. You need to adjust your playstyle to use what you've done. 
---
Realize you have to many points in int (which it sounds like you do?) You can re-spec down to five there. 
---
And here's a general tip if you DO decide to re-spec...bank levels. Hold onto all the levels until you can make a shift that brings a balance point to your re-spec. Don't just move a point from int to perception or whatever, have two points so you can move the point, and then you can get a point in rifleman. 
---
What platform are you on?  
---
I guess there probably isn‚Äôt an answer, but if you can clarify: why isn‚Äôt it supposed to end up in the game? It‚Äôs one of the coolest helmets out there, it would suck if we never see it.

Did you do the quest?

Isn‚Äôt there a set in the overseers house in Sutton?

So you can just skip everything and it might spawn to pick up?

I found a screw on the ground and my first reaction was ‚ÄúHey, I need that to fix my gun.‚Äù

Pc 
---
From personal experience, in the house is a regular letterman jacket and jeans
---
Oh geez man, that's what everyone does. Don't act like I'm some insulting jerk because you don't like my opinion^fishingminigamesblow
---
No matter what anyone thinks of opinions, it doesn't change the fact that the devs *Need to fix the game first*. 
---
I really wish people would calm down on their grandiose quest ideas sometimes. 
---
You know you can just walk up to your CAMP placement item and repair everything.
---
Honestly this is one of the most annoying things 
---
It's not just a rock.
---
It's a boulder.
---
Commenting so I can look at this later, thank you kind sir
---
Ok I shall show you a video of what I mean, I will show you that what they were doing was not what is intended of the workshop contesting mode, what this falls under is both harassment and exploiting, as they are harassing 3 people by constantly initiating PvP despite us showing that we have no interest, and exploiting a game feature to allow this.

I think this is a glitch but spawns in the white spring nuke zone seem to be jacked up I just nuked whitespring went into the golf club immediately no ghouls I‚Äôm still waiting for them to spawn in there gone in and out several times, enemy‚Äôs are spawning everywhere else besides the radroach in the basement of the golf club. I have had several people going in and out around me meanwhile, this happened to me earlier today as well except eventually they spawned, after a long time, confusing.... so I figured I would report this, I‚Äôm on ps4. Oh and btw have seen glowing ghouls in this same period around nuke zone just drop dead without anything attacking them. never had this happen before and has happened 2 out of 2 times since patch iv gone to nuked whitespring i believe this is related to this here patch Respawn: Approaching the corpse of an enemy that was killed at long distance no longer occasionally causes the corpse to disappear and the enemy to immediately respawn.

Princess Hammer is comin' for you!
---
So happy I'm not the only one seeing it like that. üòÇüòÇ
---
ah so apparently the hotfix broke the dome key quest
---
This happens to me every time I move my camp if I don't manually tear it down first, I suspect this is an intentional move done to "fix" the duped purifier bug from early release. 
---
I‚Äôm on PC too and you definitely have the option, I just don‚Äôt know the key mappings. The A button selects the current thing. Like I press x to scrap or store an object and then press x to store, a to scrap or y to swap textures.   The button to go up is the move right through the build objects menus (like from floors to walls) and the button to go down is the one to move right
---
Haha sorry ;)
---
Dear Bethesda developers, 
---
could you please FIX this?

It happens when world succesfully loaded.

I've tried to teleport to my Camp and saw that if I jump (with mutation) and fall to ground my character starts to falling down trough textures and dies.
---
I have russian localization.
---
Regards.
---
Commenting to come back to when I get home. Cheers mate. Solid find. 
---
I also had this last night but not in that area and a different quest. It was Census Violence and in The Forest, I went to it but nothing happened. Weird bug
---
Ad victoriam, sister. 
---
Bashful Bittercup here to serve!!
---
Yeah, but that requires you to be present. Sometimes I'm away from my CAMP for extended periods and when I come back, anything that got wrecked and produces a resource has stopped doing so.
---
Lonely crybaby. Life and soul of all the parties 
---
I did the quantum power armor quest after the hotfix
---
My character is Captain Cool so that makes him Mutant Mister Handy. Captain Cool approves of this. Though I'm bummed he's not a Princess
---
Not a good argument 
---
Yes, I do have the controls to do so but they don't work the same way as what yours do- they're not working the way they intended is what Im saying.
---
Either the item wants to sit low or sit heigh and it jumps between the two options if I try to use the height adjust feature.
---
hell yer i agree and if you could move items into and from your stash with the app that would be so handy

Start off at the Nation Radio Research thingy. Then go to the radio astronomy place. After that meander over to Sugar Grove. All 3 within a few minutes walk of each other. Lots of springs and screws. Rinse and repeat as needed. 
---
They probably left that there because of people getting into the other vaults. 
---
Lol. It was probably a furious rolling pin anyway. I don't think I've ever seen a legendary liberator.
---
My boyfriend was level 30 when I first started and now I‚Äôm level 86 and he‚Äôs level 80. It‚Äôs easy to catch up if you put the graft in :)
---
Huh? Oh I think I posted in the wrong thread. What is that -12 thing by my name?
---
Nice. :)
---
Looks like the "unmarked" vault people have been posting about but with 69 photoshopped on (badly). I doubt they would ever actually put 69 or 68 in game. Considering they were both populated with exclusively one sex with the exception of 1 member of the opposite sex. 
---
Where is biv? I just redownloaded today so I‚Äôve been out of the loop.
---
Civil war top hat. I'm telling ya.

No you‚Äôre thinking about the situation with mule characters 
---
I'm a Thirsty Sniper...... this just got too real....

What bug do you refer to? What is "broken"?
---
I couldn't activate the trap either after paying caps to travel to the event. I just watched the timer count down helplessly. I was at Cliff Watch.
---
You need to go to a train station and join the frat party quest. You'll find him a little ways in.

Great thank you :)

Thank God that actually worked for me...

....Im Mutant Turtle , I know one person sleeping on the couch tonight !
---
I'd love to see some screenshots. 
---
Lol I know this was a salt response but it's all the same weight
---
Cool, will check it out
---
Yeah it‚Äôs finicky. That‚Äôs why I said to build a set of stairs or three and a platform. 
---
The worst part about them? I don't go to that part of Harper's Ferry often and I forget those aren't like usual turrets. 
---
So, report it.
---
Id say start playing next week, if only for the limited Fastnacht mask mission rewards, can only get them next week, though I bet this could be a yearly thing since it‚Äôs tied to a real world festival in WV
---
Shout when you do!
---
I started trying to build my new camp  post update.. but I found I'm now constantly getting "this item is floating", "intersects with an existing object" or the floor piece/foundation/stairs and sometimes even walls won't snap when there is no reason for them not to - eg they show as green, there is nothing in their way or around them preventing it.
---
Here is an example - this piece is able to be placed in this spot if it's on its own - same height etc, it can be placed.. but if I'm snapping it to another piece to get it in this spot, it reads as floating and can't be placed. Likewise if I do place it on its own and then attempt to snap to it, then the piece being attached to it reads as floating even though it is well and truly in the ground. [https://m.imgur.com/a/2i29CkR](https://m.imgur.com/a/2i29CkR) 
---
I'm also having difficulty now with the feature that adjusts the height position of a foundation being placed - it either wants to sit right on top of the ground (and then reads as red when I try to place it) or it wants to sink very low into the ground - there is no in between. I use to be able to adjust the height between both min and max but, now it seems to only want to go to one of these these two positions. 
---
I also noticed that grass continues to stick through my foundation pieces - it's not clearing as the above patch notes mention.  
---
Sadly of the above errors are now making building quite frustrating.   
---
Seems kinda funny they have a sure fire Atom spender that almost everyone wants, and they wont put it back in the shop.
---
part of the feedback category for streamlining player item interaction - greater addressed with the broad feedback category for containers, items to solve inventory utility and exchange situations. a barter container / surface is the better solution, the functionality model for this is bartering with npcs in fallout 1. only things you tag as barter available and then if you decide manually while in the barter container interface to show it to the barter prompt
---
It seems to be a glitch related to the initial flagging of your camp as in an invalid location. I've seen several people running into this problem, hopefully they just patch it soon. 
---
I really dislike the floating camp look but thank you.
---
Not quite , I thought at first the same , but after 4 hours of trial and error , get card keys first , then go to crash site and grab the one keg generator , once you‚Äôre here get to the cabin and verify the door ( where the key spawns ) it‚Äôs closed , if so go and get one time key and then get to the cabin again and use cards , the one time code and door with key should open , repeat if you see pillar beforehand with no key do not generate key do not use your keys if all of those are applicable , it will open and show the key , now for the plans you might want to server hop for that , I did take me 5 tries but along those I saw 2 guys server hopping one of them with the power armor paint on so I‚Äôm assuming hoarding it‚Äôs advised
---
For some reason I feel like you had a hard time deciding which tip should be #1.
---
Actually that was the reason... Adrenal reaction apparently gives a bonus starting from 90% health... I thought it only did on low health... What a great mutation üëç
---
Got a biv quest as well , I‚Äôm assuming he has the same timer as the vendors ?
---
Well for one there is the fact that, you are complaining that they need to fix the game when they have been doing just that for FIVE MONTHS!. For two fix the game is not feed back as it isn't saying what is wrong. For three being a passive agressive asshole is never a good thing.  
---
hence why I am just being an agressive asshole to people like you. 
---
And finally this isn't even a grand quest idea, this is literally a minor mechanic idea. 
---
Wh
---
FO76 certainly isn't an MMO like ESO, Guild Wars 2, etc....Likewise, FO76 isn't a 'battle royale' game either ( Unfortunately, some seem to play it that way ).
---
FO76 is in a fairly unique category.  I'd go so far as to say that it is a 'solo exploration game with online elements'.  Frankly, it really isn't all that fun to play the game in 'explore' mode with others since I like to take my time and explore, read the terminals, etc... In a multiplayer situation it isn't nearly as easy to play that way ( others can get bored really fast ).
---
I don't think I've ever seen an SBQ that didn't have a bunch of people on it. You see that red circle light up you go over there. You don't need to be in the launching party to kill it. 
---
And lol what melee is OP right now, they have the best chance of hitting her lol. 
---
Every 20 hours
---
More concerned about what‚Äôs going on at White Power Winter Sports.
---
Didn‚Äôt realize Nazis love skiing. 
---
No I mean just build it temporarily to get you to the right height to place your camp. You just have to get 30 or 40 feet in the air. When you place your camp it will vanish. 
---
No, seen it before. Wondered too. 
---
Thats not how it works. Its also not greifing.
---
I get the bounty. Once people attack me, i am allowed to kill them and i am rewarded their lvl in caps. 
---
How can intended game mechanics be "greifing"?
---
What do you mean by ‚Äúit‚Äôs all the same weight‚Äù? 
---
I was just informing you that the scenario you mentioned is different than this.
---
Launching the nuke is the End Game. Killing the SBQ is the icing on the cake. 
---
Went into my camp the other night and saw I had nearly double the build budget.
---
Started laughing maniacally on my open mic, my buddy (who only has a foundation with a stash box on it) was concerned
---
I think the problem was that the marker was on the wrong spot on the map. 
---
If anyone cant get the plans and are on PC send me a PM and I will paint them for ye.
---
It's not an exploit to be better at killing than you are. 
---
Future content.
---
Likely relevant to ATLAS.
---
My conspiracy theory hashed out with little exposition: We're still in the vault in an incomplete simulation. When we get out, we'll be equipped with generated gear from our life in the sim (restricted to 1:1 copying of items for mental health continuity and replicator resource conservation) and set loose upon a much more hostile Appalachia (Nuclear Winter DLC). Think like a Light/Dark world in Zelda or something. We'll emerge from the Vault with an inspired and focused mission to rebuild Appalachia for real now that we've created emotional attachments to the area and know what the problems are. With the land likely still a hellscape, the only solution for dealing with the environment is to brute force alter it. ATLAS is weather altering technology with near God-like potential that was suddenly "shut down" by the suits up top the moment it became viable tech. We'll have to fill in the gaps to truly save Appalachia and get the land livable. 
---
Enter in Wastelanders DLC, where the land is finally habitable to a degree. We're settling for real now, and NPCs are introduced.
---
All thoughts I've made in posts months back, all oddly fit quite well with the roadmap. Nothing can kill my hype.
---
Not quite sure I understand.. how does being 30 ft in the air help you place something at ground level? Is it more tolerant of being adjusted from that height?
---
Will do bro. GT: Kingsmokeyyy
---
Skinhead, skihead there‚Äôs a difference there
---
Just wanted to add, there is a daily quest that can be taken at I believe it's called the huntsman's lodge, it's by the lake on the north side of the map, you talk to the computer and it gives you 3 beasts to hunt, and a rough location where they will spawn within a reasonable walking distance. Some you may run into before the spawn point, like a radstag, but others I've not seen yet in this game like a stingwing, which was killed by something else, I think a snallygast when I got there and couldn't claim it the one day I tried to do it. So it has its flaws, but it was a bit of fun. Idk what the reward is.
---
Love the vampire and medic weapons, I keep everyone i find, my go to is the vampire power fist and assault rifle. 
---
But have a ripper, cultist blade, pipe pistol and a medic Gatling gun for group fun 
---
What's the exploit?
---
Right! Your suggestion makes perfect sense to me.
---
If the mechanics are stupid design choices, which is what I said in the first place. 
---
I've only done it once, but it wasn't rainbow vision. It was all blue indigo violet. You know... Biv?
---
Must not be, a level 13 kept two-shotting me last night at my camp. I got so mad but remembered we all play differently so I just bounced servers. He didn't have to blow up my fusion generator though. That's just mean!
---
Today I was holding the ammunition factory and hanging outside to short things out in my inventory. I noticed a lvl 90 guy sneaking in chameleon next to me. Then he stood up close to me, waved at me me and then initiated pvp by claiming workshop and started shooting at me. Little did he know that I had full set of assasins sentinel armor so his explosive something weapon did like 1 dmg per shot. I stimpacked, pointed him with my BE shotgun and mouse1'd him to oblivion. He started yelling "I will report you in the voice chat" and went off. Later I stumbled on his workshop at the lake and decided to contest it and kill him. I succeeded and again he yelled to report me. I got atleast two report from that session and both are in my opinion false reports. All I did is grind my ass off for those weapons and armors and played the game as it was intended. I bet that 95% of the reports will be angry kids that lose in pvp situations or dont get what they want in other ways. It should be so that people who report everyone all the time have their reports impact decreased or something like that.
---
aws is cheaper.
---
Now I know what I‚Äôm doing tonight! Thanks!
---
It‚Äôs almost like my expectation was to be able to solo the game with little interference while in pacifist mode. For a series that has always been built upon single player narratives, I find it frustrating that ass holes go out of their way to spend their time harassing me.  I know the series and the game I‚Äôm playing, doesn‚Äôt mean I want what limited free time I have to be taken up dealing with morons in-game.
---
There's a developer room under White Power Winter Sports?
---
I did Nazi that coming.
---
Encountered this dude in WS and all he did was say "Stop" and just followed me everywhere making a racket lol.  Interact did nothing and he got accidently dinged by an exploding car and turned red and just came at me like a zombie..."Stop"  so I figured he was just trying to say "Stop ...me before I kill again..."  so I ended him hehehe
---
The key isn't in that room for me 
---
How have your gatling plasma been treating you post patch? I'm betting they will be top tier now. I got a ts and a furious 1 star if you wanna carry 8 around..lol
---
It's definitely a great thing. More variation, more content? Sign me up!!!!
---
I've found 3 jetpack. I just wish they would confirm or deny the problem with the shocks and the bos armor plans. Would save a bunch of us many, many hours of server hopping. 
---
Congrats, you saw right through my ruse. Those are actually neon letters I placed on it...
---
Suspended players who were overweight had to delete stuff when they logged back in before they could do anything with it. If they weren't overweight there wasn't a problem though
---
No one rips on Fallout NV for reusing assets from Fallout 3
---
Perks are not randomly given. They are level gated like 4. Only perk card packs give random cards.
---
You can choose a SPECIAL to increase, then choose the Filter buttons to go to a different SPECIAL's perks (LB/RB for the XBOX controller).
---
Why not fix the bug. It's not like I had the option to tear it down. I want my mats back bethesda!
---
Theres one per server
---
69!! 
---
The gatling plasma is supposed to have been fixed in the most recent patch. I'm wondering how the durability is now. In my limited heavy usage the plasma was definitely the strongest dps wise for me. 
---
I've got several plans. IGN Tazier
---
I wonder if that's related to people falling through the earth if they're using some common mods, like the Better Inventory one. I died about a dozen times after logging in for the first time after the patch, until some Googling turned up the cause of it. I know next to nothing about the Developer Room, but if as you're saying it's physically located under the ground, that would seem to be one way to get there.
---
Ok. You think they are stupid. That doesnt change them.
---
Things that are not greifing include:
---
 - Wrecking a player camp
---
 - Using a bounty to bait PvP
---
 - SLAP damage baiting
---
 - Using the workshop to initiate PvP anywhere on a map. 
---
Your perception and intelligence skills must be a lot higher than mine IRL. Great catch.
---
I am very interested in this üçª
---
Not the bug I was referencing. But I hope they fixed the balancing. A different reason I quick is because a level 22 one hit me with a combat knife when I was trying to help them out. 
---
I was around level 120
---
On that toon at that time.
---
Really frustrating.
---
.... Weeping Sored Filled Bittercup
---
Well, doesn't that just sound gross
---
Yeah I know that, that‚Äôs why I said you‚Äôre thinking about the mule character situation, not players with too many ‚Äùrare‚Äù items being suspended. Maybe those 2 things overlapped for some but it doesn‚Äôt apply to this scenario. 
---
I was just pointing that out since it seemed like you were replying to the wrong thread with your initial comment. 
---
Thank you, it‚Äôs two work you‚Äôre doing for the community. Appreciate it!
---
Nazis need winter hats too.
---
I‚Äôve heard of it. Where can I get the plans? 
---
Oh god...I had a guy with a knife kept one stabbing me AND my teammate over and over and he was at least 30 levels below us both. I just don't understand Bethesda logic.
---
It's hilarious how much people here will defend a mechanic because "it's in the game", and at the same time bitch and moan to the devs to change all the things they don't like.
---
Acting shitty to other players to antagonize them is griefing, whether it's supposed to be in the game or not. Bethesda just made seriously bad choices about how they implemented pvp. 
---
Yeah in their infinite wisdom they decided to make it spawn only one per server instead of having it instanced to the player.
---
Ah wow, just seen this lol showing my girlfriend the lovely people of this community. Thanks pal nice to see one nice person out there
---
Horrifying 
---
and I got yesterday a TS Cyrolator. So they are not included as well.
---
Unreal

---
When you could one shot someone with slap damage it was absolutely greifing especially if you kill the same player more than once. 
---
I thought the excavator paints were coming in this latest patch? I didn't see them..
---
I have the Dome 7 key and the blueprints aren't there, even when the door itself is locked and I use the key to unlock it.
---
I server hop dozens of times, open the door, and the crafting prints are not on the table.
---
No, fermentable drinks will have a condition, like spoilage for foods and raw ingredients.  Once that hits 0 instead of spoiled food you get the vintage or aged version.  Normal whisky doesn't have that, though craftable "fermantable whisky" does.  Another thing you don't need to fermenter to get the aged drink, it ages on its own.  The fermenter just speeds up the process.
---
It got me earlier as well and then I found out my cards were used and I'd have to start over. Needless to say I'm just gonna wait for it to calm down or Bethesda to change something.
---
Can confirm this code works.
---
btw. are you on ps4 and interested in a TS cyro?
---
üëå
---
It's working today without any changes except the update
---
Everyone but the toxic tryhard circlejerk brigade stopped posting in this shithole a long time ago.
---
The burden is on the pacifist to server hop. They are opting out of portions of the game. If they stay in my server i can assume they are enjoying thr challenge of PvP. Killing them more than once is fine. 
---
Chasing them to a new server is greifing.
---
You really need a Brotherhood Power armor paintjob
---
I figured we‚Äôd haggle in person. What are you hoping to get for it? 
---
When I went for mine it took me 3 server hops before I found the dome still locked with everything inside.
---
They did, they just didn't want to show up [their Fuhrer](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CY20T13WEAAeO7j.jpg), who also peed sitting down. 
---
I get that. But I‚Äôm saying they probably chose the sheepsquatch over sasquatch because it is exclusive to west virginia as opposed to the mainstream sasquatch.

How is it acting shitty?  Its player vs player not coop. 
---
Is it acting shitty to kill someone in call of duty too?
---
I'm not here to hold your hand kiddo. Sorry if my opinions trigger you.
---
I think I have them, I'll check soon and let you know. I've got a bunch of plans I'd love to sell because the weight is too much...
---
I used to get stuff every 4-5 I searched but not had anything in ages and enjoy popping them
---
I pmed but i havent received a reply so im unsure maybe he sent it to someone else before me already :) 
---
It'd be nice if you took your toxicity back to your liberal Reddit where it belongs.
---
Canned Dog Food, Purified water. I found that when you use combination foods, it only fills up either the food or drink meter with the philatropist perk up. I usually call my group mates together for a hug, use two dog food, three purified waters, and drop a super stim and they're up to full. 
---
If they're super radiated, then I usually switch to sharing the sunkissed perk and then just eat what other perishable food I've got lying around to drop it down.
---
Whoops sorry. Wrong thread. I was replying to someone trying to place his camp in a tree so he can build 8 stories tall. 
---
This is my camp. 
---
I got mine! Only took about three hours!!!
---
It's almost like a lady was convinced to do this to deal with a threat to the survivors of an actual world ending thing
---
I think we both need to look deeper into this. Unless the new update brought changes, screws and springs are not a result of scrapping, even with the cards.
---
Yeah. Here you go. I thought I took screenshots of the green one but im now remembering my friend shot at it before I could do anything. I have this purple one though. Sorry for the bad angle, any closer and it would've ran.

Yeah, but that's because the Quantum Paint job was something Unique to Nuka world.

As far as placing, Ive had the same problem too. I found that the fix was to get out of build mode and then get back in. 
---
Ahh all good *lol* no wonder I was confused.
---
Neat camp :)
---
Oddly, I was just thinking I hardly ever venture up north, tried to make myself but didn't because I couldn't think of a good reason to go.  
---
So yeah, I agree 
---
Sadly hasnt worked for me :(
---
Next time I get a chance, Ill try relogging when I get the issue.
---
Lol. They need Russian hats. 
---
Frick is not a bad word.. censoring it baffles me.
---
Does the auto stim armor stack?
---
I've got a perfect 3 piece raider set with AP refresh. Of course it wouldn't have been Unyielding.
---
I can hear him from the tattoo parlour talking to himself so I'd say he's the opposite 
---
Not triggered, but find it interesting when asked to expand on that opinion, you deflect and run. Have a good weekend.
---
Sell it to someone leveling their alts? 
---
Tbh I've seen high quality low level weapons go for a much as or more than high level versions.
---
Anyone 50+ can farm high level legendaries all day. There's very few ways to repeatedly obtain low level weapons once you're out of that level range.
---
I didn‚Äôt have to relog , just exit camp mode. 
---
I'm getting this error with small letters. I'm trying move my door with a welcome sign made from small letters but get this message when I try. Cant highlight the letters on it so I'm stuck with what I got unless I move  I guess.
---

F‚Äôn Decent
---
Would be good to have a use for all the .38 ammo I pick up üòÖ
---
So as I just found out, if someone else is doing this and you generate a one time code, if they enter their old code, the room where you enter the passcode will lock you inside. At this point, even if you use your own pairing cards, the door wont re-open, so I messaged them my code which opened the key room but not the passcode room, so I cleared the enemies so they could fast travel back for the key.
---
After a quick chat they surprisingly let me have the key and mentioned they'd be fine with server hoping again, so I hope they manage to get the paint without issue!
---
The one boy problem I have is vertibots flying below me and clipping through the building. 
---
I want to see Zetan hoard events at the crashed space station
---
If you didn't know, you can take pics in photo mode they'll be used as loading screens. 
---
I just wanna be a gunslinger with a revolver. x.x
---
Just did it, and it wouldn't let me input the key code. then I was scared someone would take the key so I went back out to check before I tried the keypad again and the wall closed. -_- 
---
I censored it as a inside joke. I cuss alot actually. 
---
Brutal. Collected the cards, got the one time code, and the key did not spawn. I know it is is just because this must be popular but FML what a waste of time. :(
---
Is this still happening after the hotfix?
---
It's probably only rock behind because that particular door will probably be  load door that loads you into and interior cell. You click enter on it and that'll be it. No moving animation to it. 
---
LOL you look like an air traffic tower- that might be why theyre confused.
---
Great idea I‚Äôll add that. With credit 
---
I had to server jump since the key wasn't in the room.
---
Once on the new server, I tried the two key card readers again, too bad the previous ones removed mine from the inventory for some reason so I have to re-find them again...
---
Thank you, and while I appreciate the complement I just happen to catch patterns easily. Was a useful skill growing up, I can't tell you how many teachers I had that put the answers to multiple choice questions in patterns.
---
As long it‚Äôs not Skyrim‚Äôs grabbing salmon with your hands mechanic 
---
My dude i never said your were griefing, just that peeps can be salty if they want especially with rando attacks üëÄüëÄüëÄ
---
lol. I feed on your hatred. Give it to me bb.
---
just lol :D
---
Same here. Took like 30-40 hops but finally ran into it. 
---
Somehow despite using chems and alcohol constantly I've never once been addicted. And I don't even take any perks that would affect addiction! 
---
If they aren‚Äôt coming after you and you are hunting them down after the first time you‚Äôre greifing. 
---
I kind of feel like you aren't even listening to me. I've explained my point pretty well already. 
---
That's true. Like you can repair armor and weapons before they break.
---
Think it took me 11 times. Lots trying to get extra and sale em. üòÇ
---
Yeah. After the update I got it too. 
---
It's damn near useless unstable. It should have never been worth that much to begin with. 
---
I‚Äôll play with you PSN is the same as my Reddit 
---
Launching nuke in 5 mins bro 
---
I logged out yesterday before finishing and he just gave me a completely new quest when I went back to him. 
---
Word, I hear ya. I get that they can only do so much at a time but it would be nice to get a fix for some longstanding issues.   
---
I'd noticed that Rose's super mutant quest can be pretty specific on which mutant camp you raid, and also that if you log out before finishing it the location will change upon logging back in. I had initially had leading me to the Crevasse Dam, was slowly making my way there, logged out for a bit, came back and the location had changed; it wanted me to raid SM's just north of Whitesprings instead. And as u/PatsBard said David Thorpe is at Fred's BBQ, it's like a little south-east-ish from Top of the World. I used to have a camp on an iron deposit right next to it and freakin' David was CONSTANTLY trampling through my farm, lol. 
---
Any word on the daily‚Äôs getting fixed? I haven‚Äôt had one pop up since the patch! :(
---
Bingo. This. 
---
I hate PVP and I never engage. I'm a perk card sharing swiss army knife medic build that isn't built for damage. It only takes one yahoo in party that's not in passive to tag someone to be at risk of being straight up murdered.
---
Free the Temp Ban Players!!!
---
I‚Äôll join 
---
Ouch. Good to know, thanks.
---
Launching nuke right now dude 
---
People beat you to it.  Good luck.  
---
[This guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b1fe6k/fallout_76_secret_nuka_cola_quantum_power_armor/eilr422/) figured out how to take advantage of the plans' popularity. Everyone's looking for it now. Key is one per server, but plans are instanced per player. So just server hop until you find one with TNT Dome 7 unlocked by another player, waltz in, and grab your copy.
---
Yeah it's old news but I do appreciate you sharing it. Others users might not have known about it either. :)
---
Not according to my judge.
---
I'm so glad I got everything in my first attempt.
---
Ok just collecting from my workshop before I Join 
---
Someone might have got there just before you on that server the key response every 45 minutes
---
 Head of nail ... meet hammer. ;)
---
those arent mutations I trained daily in the vault to jump higher and run faster you just never saw me training because you slept in late all the time !!
---
Please do. If I can't get them from a vendor, I don't mind buying them from a player
---
Exactly what I did. 
---
Dern Nukashine! What did I do last time I played?
---
Plans are one person server also. Had to hop 11x to get them.
---
Cool, thanks for the info, I will give it a shot.
---
Actually behind that rock there's a vault door ramp/walkway kinda thing but there's nothing beyond that. Some dude glitched into the wall ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è[https://m.imgur.com/lqENdeR](https://m.imgur.com/lqENdeR) 
---
Yeah but you are *wrong*
---
Wrecking camps is not greifing. Its an activity encouraged by the developers of game. 
---
Some of your comments about the "bad pvp system" are opinions and ypu can hold them. Im not arguing them. Im arguing the way you coin everything as greifing. 
---
Its literally not greifing... Its PvP.
---
I would assume so. Don‚Äôt see how the effects would cancel each other. Guess it‚Äôs worth a try. 
---
Cool, I'll hit it up a few times, thanks!!
---
You mean like when you go inside a, building that you see through the walls? 
---
Had to do the whole thing 4 times till I got my key. Will it spawn more than 1 plan per player? 
---
so there are 3 different for tech data? Gonna need more power armor üòÇ
---
GT: Rehrune - Mid level too! Would be cool to team up, also going to be filming for YouTube or streaming it! 
---
Chat should function like an invite. The recipient needs to approve the chat to begin. This would stop would be spammers. I think this would be a welcome addition on PC.
---
Running in fullscreen or windowed mode?
---
Fullscreen sounds to be the better fps mode.
---
If not, I talked with a dude yesterday that the fullscreen fix wasnt solving his issue, and they found another way to fix it, I can link you to that thread if you want.
---
no thnx im selling an AA cryo actually
---
You can probably walk into gamestop and they'll give you 3 copies for free./s
---
Jokes aside I don't know either of your financial situations but the game is $25 on amazon
---
Nope. Its not greifing.
---
I dont bring my feelings into video games. I expect the same from others playing a rated MA pvp enabled survival game. 
---
So i dont need to consider their feelings at all. Thats not part of the game.
---
They can always block and server hop. Thats what they *should* do. Thats what bethesda gave you as a tool to avoid pvp. Use it. 
---
Otherwise i will farm you for caps. 
---
Yeah it's rough in one hop a dude was there waiting and teabagged around me. He must of just gotten the plan üòÇ 
---
Might be interesting with a low health build with a ton of diluted stimpaks. It'd be hard to get me to hang up my Unyielding set.
---
Because you cant cook with a bottle of water.
---
If you wanted to make some noodles you need boiling hot water, if you pour some room temp water on them you're gonna be crunching a lot.
---
Antifa soyboy. I'm not surprised.
---
WAIT YOU CAN MILK DA MOO MOOS?!
---
Normally I stick to resource gathering sell runs and knocking out any easy atom point challenge quests. Had some fun playing around with the camp building which can become a time sink if you're trying for challenging builds like incorporating existing structures or making a less boxy circular building. 
---
Putting together a sustainable alcohol generating base where you don't have to travel for ingredients is likely the next challenge.
---
There's other people I know that look to do events on the map to collect outfits or unlearned plans.
---
Thanks mate
---
ok, just thought maybe, because you were so curious about them
---
I fixed the problem before I could get some screen shots, sorry
---
Ah, I got you confused with the original guy I was replying to. What are you arguing for again? That low level players under level 50 can't _really_ change their build _that_ much because their Special might not be perfect for every build at once, but that they mostly can? Great stuff, thanks for that
---
Look at the upvote ratio, you're in the minority here,  your post is a net negative for everyone. There's nothing wrong with constructive critizism, but your post doesn't offer that, just you complaining you didn't build your character the way you wanted. Ironically, You're also 100% wrong about your builds viability for SBQ (specifically shotguns), because again, you're not contributing, your just being butthurt. 
---
You asked what i can do: 
---
I can calmy explain... (See above)
---
I meant thats what i do when people get upset. Explain to them that i dont think im greifing them lol. It never works out tho!
---
I was unaware of smelting ores until level 80 or so. I've been good on acid for the most part due to that
---
Always there. Can't catch 'em though.
---
You can since the new update, decreases your thirst and rads. I was told that you can also use it in some recipes but I haven't found them myself.
---
I am trying to build a 3 piece Bolstering/2 Piece Vanguard set as a run around town armor. I have a Zealots set I use at the queen. Helps with everything but the carpet bomb spray. 
---
apparently I don't have a copy, not sure if I read my only one or already got rid of it. I dumped a bunch in a suitcase at train station before I realized some of them are worth selling...
---
I‚Äôm here!
---
To take it to the next level, not ever using the stash box would up the ante
---
....man I hope I don't have to bunk with you in the frat house 
---
You can find one in the ditch/river in between Charleston station and Charleston trainyard
---
I actually thought this was a troll at first, that is amazing 
---
No that seems to be just a glitch I've seen several people say after the patch they have a radstag but yes pets can still die
---
Yeah I had to mutant hounds explode on me a couple days ago.
---
Didn't make much sense.
---
I think this is one of the low-key great ideas in 76, something I wouldn't mind seeing in more games.
---
I see. Thanks. I may aim my nuke at my camp then (once I'm fed up with it and want to rebuild).
---
My game froze halfway through doing his daily quest, and that didn't affect it at all.
---
Ha! You should build a CAMP there and parade around with your new fancy paint job.
---
Meanwhile, here I am at server hop 32 and no luck.
---
Fresh vodka is literally just vodka.
---
If you take the game offline it's not a hotfix! 
---
I will try that! I don‚Äôt do many events since I‚Äôm a solo player. I will look into it though
---
If only because I have an unusually high amount of space on my Favorites Wheel dedicated to various RadAway and Stimpack options...
---
Maybe they'll finally fucking listen if its posted enough. Until then there is Perk Load Out manager on PC.
---
I'll just wait a few days to get. No need to rush for it.
---
Vintage kind?
---
bump
---
Hmmm thats funny because I didn't read past the first sentence of your comment and I do not fucking care already. You can act like mister Reddit police all you want. My post is fallout related. It's my complaint. It's here. You don't have to be.
---
I might just do that üòÇ don't have a stable set camp location since last update it made me move it 
---
Same thing here, there's also side quests (killing a wendigo while wearing a clown costume) that come back and is completable every single time I log in
---
1st time I did the quest ended up at the Sickleman house. Freaked out for a second 
---
I'd be for making that some kind of Mutation... call it Radioactive Affinity or something like that, where you can see radiation in ways that other players don't. 
---
MegaSloth
---
I attack the whitesprings sentry bots for fusion cores and a quick 350xp. Manage to get them down in 2 hits and they have been exploding upon death since the patch. Used to wait -10 seconds.
---
My camp was in the absolute middle of nowhere and I still got the message. :(
---
I've got a mutant slayer, a ghoul slayer, and a troubleshooters set but I get tired of carrying it all around or checking in at stash boxes to change... especially without the carry weight benefit I get from Unyielding.
---
Typical methods mentioned in this thread seem broken after the patch. I can't get anything to respawn at whitesprings anymore. Waiting on someone to come up with a work around.
---
It‚Äôs the same for me on and a lot of others.  I‚Äôve looked everywhere here and on Bethesda.net for any info on the issue.  If it‚Äôs a bug I haven‚Äôt seen it acknowledged directly.  I would be happy with one daily per region per day with the 20 hour reset and it would go a long way in end game content.  
---
They are a random encounter that spawns all over the map. If you have ever ran into a fresh grave, a lone black suitcase, a dead responder, a crashed veribot, a crashed satellite, or a tent full of scorched, (I feel like I am forgetting some) then you have probably found one of the spawn points for the dead civil war reeanactor. He has a small chance to spawn. And then he has one plan on him, it varies what kind. The plans are all pretty decent, but the top hat plan is the best. It allows you, with one cloth, to craft a top hat that can sell to vendors for 25 to 25 caps depending on your stats. For 40 cloth I can clear out all the vendors. And cloth is everywhere. I have a camp on the junk pile on the river next to sunshine Meadows. If you start there and walk north along the road, about halfway to point pleasant, you will run into one of the spawn points. Or if you are on ps4 I can just sell you a plan.
---
 Okay so bare with me here. First off, I recommend reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqtokr/fallout_76_pc_version_graphic_presets_explanation/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), the OP is an absolute hero, who has worked with this engine modding and ect. since skyrim, and fallout 4 as well.
---
For a TDLR, delete your current preset files from config (under my games fallout 76 generally) with the game turned off. Then boot up the game, Select Full-screen, and the Medium graphics preset. Then from there you can change some settings like textures, however make sure shadow distance is set to low, and DO NOT TOUCH ANY FADE SLIDERS.
---
Once you've done that, if your getting solid frame-rates and want a graphical improvement, go ahead and check out [this reshade](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/234) by the same guy. I found that I actually got less stuttering in general with this, however my righ might slightly outclass yours, in which case just stick with the setting changes. If you're in game and your GPU still has around 30-40% usage left, that's when I'd recommend using this reshade.
---
Basically, the presets for High and Ultra aren't meant for 60fps gaming, they're there for cinematography and ect. The OP of that post I linked explains how the medium preset for fallout 76 actually sets values higher than ultra fallout 4, to put it in perspective. So when you're using the medium preset, then for instance upping texture quality to ultra, you're getting the same visual experience as running it on the ultra preset, except ultra runs in general 15-30 fps slower ESPECIALLY in places like harper's ferry.
---
Hope this helps man, I've dropped the same knowledge bomb like 5 times in 3 days, thinkin' this stuff needs to be in a sticky thread.
---
reposted from earlier this week
---
Yeah. It sucks.
---
No you need empathy lessons because you‚Äôre being a self righteous asshole about it. No one likes a contrarian. It was completely unnecessary to come onto my post and shit all over it how you did. There‚Äôs a way to disagree with someone, and that‚Äôs not how you do it. 
---
Yes, there is so no fermenter at whitesprings but a brewing Station. Fermenter is also limeted to one per Camp and you can only access yours so no access at a friends camp
---
I'd turn it off immediately if they added it.
---
I have a stupid idea, you could give a health boost to the protected object in this example for every player joining the event, but keep the timer.
---
Top notch seller. Great prices. Thanks again. 
---
Why...
---
Yea, just too bad its a Karma sink hole for you since most people think you're being a whiny wittle baby. 
---
You're definitely not the only one. 
---
Thankfully, I've been able to get the Camden Park daily almost every day, but the ones in the Mire showed up a couple times and then stopped. 
---
Fucking same
---
&gt;  And I have no idea how you pulled of a solo nuke in 1 month (sounds fake)
---
Wow you're really an irredeemable asshole eh? buddy trys to be constructive and you just can't resist saying he's lying. SMH.
---
&gt; but some people have lives they have to take care of as well. 
---
Implying u/code_monkey_001 doesnt? Why make threads if all you're going to do is shit on people who aren't even being mean to you. Get a grip kid.
---
Hmm funny because if you couldn't tell this is a website, therefore Karma doesn't actually matter that much to me.
---
Yep. Happened to me last night. I saw a legendary protectron. Hardly tapped him with my hammer. And his explosion actually killed me...which was odd.
---
A do push the wrong one in a panic half the time 
---
How did you find out about it? :thinking:
---
Don't you have something better to do?
---
I'm afraid I do not know about your main issue, I only ever got to do one daily so far. However, Strangler Bloom can sometimes be found from strangler pods that glow at night a little southwest of Dyer Chemical.
---
I have troubleshooter too. I laugh at Colonel Gutsy 
---
I didn‚Äôt read it right and thought you were talking about the red one but when I saw he pic I was surprised. Thanks your amazing
---
Hungry Crybaby.
---
...how did you know?
---
the budget increase was great, until my camp got deleted because "a fallout 76 update prevented camp from being placed". then moved it, spent hours rebuilding it, then it got deleted again. having a functional camp is a big part of playing the game. it getting deleted a couple times a day is unacceptable. 
---
Been noticing this on PS4. Watoga was making me feel sick yesterday.
---
r/woosh
---
Thanks for the video!  I had to repeatedly the steps a few times though....one servvler the key was gone, and on another server the first door didn't open.  Third time was the charm though.
---
You're an idiot
---
Don't you?
---
That's a fair point, but I still think a timer obviously solves 90% of the problem. There's no perfect way to do it, but a timer would drastically help.
---
It sounds like the scenario they're worried about is someone joining an event where another player is close to completing it, but you can see players on the map. If a defense event already has a player in it, you can still show a timer, but any curious player will put 2 and 2 together and figure out that the event is already being played by someone, and use that to weigh whether or not to go to it.
---
But if that's not enough, you could also add other info for those types of events, and it would be pretty minimal. Instead of just saying "15:00 left" you could say "15:00 left. Wave: 1 of 3" or something like that. Again, there is no perfect solution, but this is a huge QoL improvement people have been requesting since beta and I think it's about time a decision is made about how to handle it in the game.
---
I'd like to add a hint of cranberry to beer etc like cranberry beer melon beer etc lol
---
How the fuck. U didn't woosh me you just said something stupid and got a response.
---
I'm literally just taking a shit responding to comments because I've had food poisoning all day. So no. I don't.
---
Welcome back
---
That was a bit easy! Thanks and good work üí™
---
I think it could be easy to make a recipee to convert purified water to boilled by adding something to it, but what do i know...
---
I just found out what I'm doing this weekend
---
If you had food poisoning you'd need hospitalization fam. You just eat junk food.
---
Holy Christ, this things like the jet pack. Good luck!
---
Wait until they are available.
---
Imagine how the brahmin feels.
---
Never heard of them. Is a new alcohol recipe asking for them?
---
Wtf
---
A. That's not how that works and B. I'm doing keto right now to support a friend. It's done in 2 weeks.
---
Why not total game interruptions and an announcer Hunger Games style?
---
Game pauses, a panel appears in the middle of the screen with the defunct player's icon... cue dramatic music... announcer says a few words... game resumes.
---
I don't always advocate for obnoxious, immersion breaking UI elements but when I do I go all in.
---
  Man where are you guys getting this gear, I swear to god if I see another wood armor or PvP 40 metal auto stim, I'm gonna puke!
---
Boiled is a word at the past tense and not the same as boilling. Boiled can return at room temperature and still be boilled.
---
Read the actual roadmap that case in the patch notes. And the roadmap that was released weeks before that. It‚Äôs not out yet. 
---
Hell yeah bud 
---
Some drink effects are so fucking OP and ridiculous, and we're still discovering them. Tick Taquila blood crazy shit that completely changes the way you play the game - rifle buffs, tank buffs, I'm hesitant to even Google the different drinks because I'm having so much fun finding them on my own.
---
Definitely a bug for you.. mine is fine. Xbox
---
Does it change the actual effects of the perk? Are you on PC with mods? 
---
If it's just a text bug, might be an issue with your strings. If a mod edits the strings files and the game updates, the game will still look at the old modded strings file which is missing the new content, and weird issues can arise. Usually that just reads a "lookup failed", though, I have no idea what could cause this or if I'm even on the right track.
---
Yea, I've just never seen them before lol.
---
Another month or so
---
On roses.

I have the same problem. I did have a custom in file for a mod that never worked (inventory management). I have full out uninstalled FO76 and the bethesda.net laucher, downloaded new ones started a new character and...it keeps happening.
---
If I need to fix the (new) ini file somehow, how?
---
Just finished that the day before the update. Was my last day in camden for a while.
---
Whoa, pls dont do that again Satan!
---
I can't tell if you're being serious, also haven't seen roses.
---
It limits it by the total SPECIAL point distribution, so if you select too many perks you‚Äôll run out of points to use. Think of each card having a numerical value, the base for each card being one, the max being the maximum rank of the card. You can put at most fifteen into one attribute, and a grand total of 56. Just tap next to the attributes, look for perks you like, and play around with it until you find something you think would be good. I tend to be a heavy weapons power armor build because big guns are fun. 
---
I'm kidding friend. Mutated roses would be romantic though. 
---
I had a ski blade mod that said adds 25 armour earlier on PS4, when transfered to stash and back changed to 2 steel and 1 weight... hope it‚Äôs just txt as other guy says... üëçüèª
---
Another nuke dropping on her in 10 mins dude 
---
always. i swam thru ever river from end to end looking for hidden stuff one day. lots of fish, not many hidden items worth hiding down there.
---
Hell Yeah best online game I ever played 
---
A big part was my lifestyle and work at the time, I was a bicycle courier and a hard drinker, it adds up.
---
Punctuation goes a long way in communication. It's why they invented it.
---
I left a couple yesterday.  Wish I could see the new players drink it and wake up in the middle of nowhere
---
Thanks again dude, you really made my day today.
---
Well, whaddya get? Dont let us down OP! 
---
Yes that would and the thing is with the player dying, they would lose all the junk items. I have two ideas with that...
---
They lose some items they got within that area.
---
Or
---
They lose some items within a certain time frame.
---
I like your idea and we could have stash boxes removed completely for that player or that server.
---
Destroying  camps was in the trailer. This isnt animal crossing. Its not being an asshole. They are raiders. 
---
I wish there was one for PS4 (Perk Load Out Manager).. My luck is stuck on a max of 4 and don't know how to raise it. I have all these cards I got I can't use.
---
Can you inspect the card to see what all the other effects are. Also this may have somehing to do with the prestige system coming out in the coming months
---
My pleasure! It was great chatting with you!!
---
Ask for even the nicest of people to orbital strike your base.
---
Animal crossing is great for the elderly
---
They were too dark previously so BGS made them brighter as an improvement.  I think halfway between what they were and what they are might be about right.
---
Did he still have a red health bar? Like agressive?
---
I feel the same way. Personally I'm hoping Bethesda brings the photomode and player loading screens into their next single player games as well
---
Do why it happened did yes me or slug
---
Go must off in log but system enter in off log
---
game out start in re but cap log bad lose go did why it happened
---
Exterminator's Rolling Pin. 
---
No you are right. Missing/wrong text strings is a symptom of mod interference.
---
A condition timer in boiled water could justify the thought process then
---
FUMING. This is HORRIFYING. UNREAL. You'll never find it with that attitude. 
---

I'm running the following:
---
* Latest Win 10 Pro
---
* AMD Threadripper 1900X

* Samsung 970 Pro

* Comcast measured at 60/12 down/up @12ms latency
---
The game is wildly inconsistent.  I play all day without a crash, or I can get ten crashes in ten minutes.
---
The nature of the crashes is what's killing me.  I suffer two types, first being the usual CTD, but that's rare for me.  What's happening way more often is that the game will lock up, the sound will continue with some sounds stuck on loop, but I'll be able to communicate with my team the whole time.  Sometimes it hangs like that for a couple seconds and recovers.  Sometimes it does that and never recovers.  Turns out I can die in this state, and drop all my (significant amount of) scrapped junk.  Had that happen once, losing a bunch of stable flux (THANKS BETH).
---
I'm in communication with CS currently, but their suggestions have been boneheaded obvious, for the most part.  And not helpful.
---
What I've been hearing from them consistently is "it's probably connection issues".  Which bugs the shit out of me, because why should a game lock up (says "not responding" in the task manager), if the connection is wonky?  Just DC makes sense, not CDT or hanging.
---
FYI, I have not bluescreened like you.  I suspect driver/hardware/system issues if you're getting a BSOD.  What code does it throw?
---
Yeah, and make it available for the Apple Watch this time too! That would be seriously EPIC! üòÇüòÇ
---
i saw this yesterday. after joining/fast traveling it put me at the actual spot. there seems to be a bug where events pop up on the map at the wrong locations.
---
Yeah. You can see them swimming in the green outline of your base if it intersects water.
---
I believe this was also in Fallout 4.
---
The quest with the vox rifle is marked as a daily quest but I‚Äôve never been able to repeat it. 
---
I go to the house where it‚Äôs supposed to start every time I get on because it was my favorite quest so far. 
---
Daily quests don‚Äôt seem to actually be daily. 
---
Excuse me there, Super Mutant, hold that swing while I eat the bowl of soup, unless you want to become a Soupier Mutant.   
---
So, there's a place called whitespring right at the edge of savage divide (it's a white building on the map). There are a couple areas there where you can attack ghouls without them being to reach you. I find it tends to exhaust my ammo pretty well. 
---
If you want a really grindy tactic, the food plants scrap into the same components to craft them, so you could get free xp that way. It is super grindy though and extremely boring. 
---
Also, see if you can get the marsupial mutation. It allows you to jump on top of things and get out of range of melee creatures. Deathclaws are nothing to me now as long as I can climb on top of something. 
---
If you want (and schedules line up) I'd be happy to help you out a little (even though I'm only level 32, I figure it will help)
---
Well, this was an easy one!
---
Welcome back EVIL DUPER!
---
I don't think it can be measured like that, but I would say for me it was like 4 to 6 old turrets. And I had no turrets before the update, so it was just what i got back from my lights.
---
I FORGOT I POSTED THIS
---
Lol. Not a duper. 
---
There seems to be an awful lot of turds like that playing this game sometimes. 
---
I can see why they haven't done that yet. It would open up a whole new bag of bugs and possible exploits to dupe items. Also with the security they have now I'd imagine it's not impossible for someone other than you to use that app to mess with you.
---
Haha, I'm glad you're still around to see your request achieve fruition! :)
---
I have my perks and special chosen but I'm not getting the 2-50 roadmap.
---
I did search first and have the same problem, except, I'm played on a new download. Both 76 and the launcher freshly installed. Does the ini file at issue live somewhere outside the game files? (And if so WTF?)
---
Huzzah! No more splody! I've had too many of those bastards explode in my face. I always laugh but it gets old when all you're trying to do is loot them.
---
Similar here too. I want to do waste not and it never starts for me. 
---
As a melee build that PvPs everyday,  I have to tell you I get killed every day almost by good ranged players.   Adapt and overcome,  don't expect the world to reduce itself for you.
---
Currently running around in my Quantum PA :D haha
---
Skyrim, the new Rick-Roll . . . 
---
I know bud,  just messing with you lol. 
---
When I first did this quest on my first character it was automatically given on the map. But since then, my other characters don't have it.
---
Fresh and base count as the same.  St least, that's what worked for me with the bourbon challenge 
---
So glad my hundreds of hours werent flushed fown the toilet.
---
Me too. The game needs its veteran players as much as possible. 
---
mine was working fine yesterday. i'll try again when i get off work but i had no issues the last 2 days with drinking toxic goo
---
What we need is an event app like Destiny
---
It was found through data mining. The original post was made here on Reddit this morning I believe.
---
üôÑ
---
Easy Fix, report them and they are removed from game, and banned! I am getting tired of the assholes in this game. It has become a in game virus now a day's!  I remember in the beginning every one seemed to get along fine, game prices dropped low enough, and that's where the problem started. 1000 hrs in, I  have seen the transition from good to bad too ugly, with in the last month. Maybe Bethesda needs to monitor players activity? I don't know, it's getting worse by the day. Had 10 players destroy my camp again last night, murder me, and spit in my face, I wish I could teleport in game and kick the living shit out of them in real time, now that how I roll. 
---
Cool cheers, do report. Maybe something going on with my game then
---
Again, you just aren't listening. Griefing is griefing, it's not dependent on what the game decides is allowable. It's shitty that someone can just walk in, trash my camp in 30 seconds and then leave. And if I'm dumb enough to engage them, I'll likely just get murdered, robbed, and lose a bunch of caps. There's no provocation and I lose no matter what. That's a shitty designed game. 
---
You keep defending the pvp in this game just because they have done it that way, and I keep telling you that the way they have done it is just stupid and wrong. And all your arguments are just to defend your griefer style of play and rationalize you acting badly to other people. 
---
That's on your speakers and has nothing to do with you talking to someone for a trade, as a father I do agree that this game is NSFW but still has more kids talking trash then adults. In ten years of Minecraft online and CoD it has been my experience that most players over 20ish don't really swear that often but every teen and under seems to say a swear every second word.
---
Lol so clueless. Some of the best pvprs i know use power armor. 
---
That happens if you hit enter too many times while making a numbered bullet list. OP just needs to remove the extra newlines and it'll fix itself.
---
They should just make pacifist servers. PvP damage is disabled entirely. Easy solution. 
---
April 7 with the Pioneer Scout "Ever Upwards" update my fren
---
What about my classes lol? Also he restarted numerous times. Hes gonna try to get a support ticket to get help on this situation
---
If I could have about 20% more it would be perfect. 
---
My base is complete, but could do with a bit more. 
---
Still, really appreciate the increase!
---
Once they land you can keep them down by using enforcer level 3. It will cripple them and keep them on the ground even the queen
---
Sir that just doesn‚Äôt make sense nothing against you but like ik it‚Äôs tedious and all but come on how much alcohol are you making?
---
For the super mutant part of that quest, when it didn't appear, after I went to the normal radio tower I checked online and it said it could be in 2 other spots so I went there. Did not work, so I had to relog. The quest ending up being in Summersville and since I looted the chest the first time I went there it didn't have anything for me to pick up for quest. Lucky I had a bright idea to put my weapon in there and take it back out which worked.
---
You sir are a magnificent bastard.
---
This worked for me also. I was having the same issue and got the quest completed. Thanks.
---
You arent going to be strong right off the bat but it doesnt take as much as you think to get there. Your tude sucks tbh
---
I still don‚Äôt know what tse stands for and at this point I‚Äôm too scared to ask. 
---
I avoid PVP in this game at almost every occasion. People much higher level than me, or with crazy effect weapons will run out my stimpacks by hitting or shooting at me until I‚Äôm forced to fight back, and that‚Äôs about the point I get one shotted. 
---
Unless you were in a server with only people within 5 or 10 levels of you, it‚Äôs really hard to have a fair fight 1v1. Until you get past level 100 or so and I feel like everyone at that point is pretty OP. 
---
I‚Äôll partake in fights if they seem fun and fair with people similar strength to me, and I‚Äôm fine dying then. But more often than not it‚Äôs someone that wants to come slaughter me for resources and caps like a cow, and when they‚Äôve got the power to actually do it, I can‚Äôt help but become very frustrated with that mechanic. 
---
There's a spot by arctos pharma in the center of the woodlands that has a pretty flat spot of land for a camp. It's good location for a low leveled player, and there's a power armor spawn point nearby in the second floor. I have a full set of t60 power armor from it. 
---
I would kinda like to see dim flash lights and really bright like a spectrum of flags lights and head lamps you can make 
---
What didn‚Äôt make sense exactly... that fact that in IRL you can boil bottled water? 
---
Mate, this fan base likes to look at themselves in power armor and pretend they're bad asses, then when it comes times to defend themselves they come here and post about how much they know about balance and what makes a game good for everyone.  
---
You had me at drink, and drugs, and have!
---
I found an X01 jet pack on a caps run yesterday, can sell it to you if you want. (PS4)
---
Be positive
---
Oh i know, Im the one that made the post. Just being a bit petty to see if he would admit it, rather than pass it off as finding it on his own. As he alluded to in one of his other comments.
---
I thought he was the only one.
---
I believe this is part of the constant nerfing trend, being implemented by devs to add longevity to the game. I've also noticed cap stashes not spawning, perks not proccing and downright useless drops from high lvl legendary enemies, as well as the above. Shame really, upsetting the long term players is not how to maintain interest in an online service. 
---
I was thinking about making a running class that would specialize in pistols only. With all of the running perks, speed demon, and high END/AGI I will be like sanic, gatta go fast. 
---
Nice, I already got it üòÄ 
---
Seen a text post of the steps on how to get the key cards and keys today so I decided to make a video showing how it's done.
---
Always do the wise mothman quest you can get a ton of acid from the fire flys
---
With little effort 
---
Glad to see I'm not the only one. I also left some really nice level 5 and 10 weapons.
---
It already does... god yall are completely braindead. Pvp for many hours before making these thoughts. The tactics in this game are very important. Power armor has many useful aspect. Rad resist built in for example. Yes radiation resist matters in PVP. So does pain train when a sentinel is standing still (assuming youre not using a .50 cal mach that will wipe them with ease). Study the perks more, i've seen PA do some great things.

The old foundation stacking doesn't work anymore tho, and some of the rug stuff.
---
Check out this nerd studying a science.
---
Next thing you know he'll be a mod.
---
That quest with the vox syringer is supposed to be daily, but I‚Äôve never been able to repeat it. It is my favorite quest that I‚Äôve done so far so I was really glad there was more to it, Disappointing that I haven‚Äôt been able to find out what though. I hope this issue is addressed. 
---
I put in a support ticket about this, I had no pets and then patch 7 dropped and suddenly had a Radstag. It is definitely a bug and an annoying one at that, I don't want a pet taking up budget in my camp.
---
I would recommend just to swap servers 
---
stealth/crit/sniper builds are typically low health/glass cannon if you want the numbers you are thinking about. you kind of have to sacrifice defense to gain crit and stealth perks. my build is like 60/40 bloodied melee/rifle and my rifle still does around 600dmg as my secondary weapon.
---
Bethesda sure loves to make us server hop.
---
It's a shame they had to add in this kind of 'difficulty' for mods and other crap. 
---
Didn't see your post but thanks
---
Recipe suggestion: beer battered fish 'n tato chips
---
Congrats on becoming a parent!
---
If you're open in a few hours when I'm on I just might! Maybe start a virtual bar brawl or two!
---
If we can use water with no rads then yeast could more readily make dough rise. Milk some brahmin and get that fermenting.  We already have spices, glowing fungus and squirrel bits. 
---
Now we‚Äôre missing t‚ÄôMato and we could make flatwoods pizza. 
---
double the ingredients and and bake in a frying pan, you got a stuffed Watoga pizza. 
---
I just wanted to make sure you got some credit because that was some pretty grade A sleuthing you did there.  I‚Äôm really enjoying my new paint job thanks to you.
---
Can it remotely kick you if you try to milk it too much?
---
Making some bomb honey, using that honey to make some bomb tea or food 
---
/golfclap
---
Perks, weapon, buffs. Not cheating. 
---
So fish and chips+beer 
---
That makes me think of Animatrix for some reason. 
---
Thankfully no it stays in your inventory like the other TNT keys do.
---
Actually, it's the opinion of the majority of the core fanbase. There was a lot of backlash against this game for people who liked FO1/2/NV and even 3.
---
Ain't no one's got time for that. 
---
I love every bit of what you just said. 
---
Xbox. As far as I know the only place to find it is the armory vendor in the white springs bunker. So that must have been extremely lucky. Even for it to be at the bunker is extremely rare. 
---
Your the dad pay child support
---
sounds like 10mm's are OP and nEED TO BE BANNED!!1
---
j/k... That's just how PvP is in this game. The first person to do damage is the winner, generally. 
---
I think they are contesting your workshop. Sounds like you are not equipped to defend it.
---
Tried 050291.  No dice.
---
so anyone you can't kill is a cheater lol. stop pvp'ing if you dont like the mechanics. it aint rocket science.
---
It seems I got extremely lucky then, I did a stream this morning right after the update and got the plans in one shot, you have my condolences and sympathy if your having to server hop dozens of times for them. They really should be player instanced and 1 per customer so no one can make them rare on a platform and drive the price up, it never even occurred to me to try for more then the 1 set.
---
That's right - this isn't our universe
---
I think orbital strike beacons are the only items you can craft with raw. Anybody know of any else?
---
Making a thing available to everyone actually lowers its value and undermines the whole concept of exclusive and limited offer. 
---
So I hope tjis and the other one-time exclusives wull not be republished ever.
---
I'd with Beth came up with other paint schemes as cool as that one was. Like the Atom Cats one)) 
---
This! And I have the 30% perk card to slow that down even...Stuff just seems to be rotting at an more accelerated speed than before. 
---
It took me about 30 server hops for the plans to be there.  It's popular right now and I suspect people can also loot more than one.
---
I noticed it switches from being a glowing one to a non-glowing one.  The glowing one tries to attack my camp walls but never does any damage lol
---
Welp, I'm doing this regularly from now on. 
---
Almost silent when kids are sleeping..
---
World or Appalachia radio when alone.
---
Are you within the character weight limit or do you need to delete items?
---
It‚Äôs almost due west of where it looks like it should be
---
That‚Äôs twice as much as a regular flower or plant 
---
Since you want to try and bait me for something I'm not even claiming where did I say I figured this whole thing out my self ? 
---
Considering I didn't see your post I seen someone else's post this morning listing out step by step and my video was made by 10am this morning you might not be the only hacker to figure it out. 
---
I‚Äôve been hopping for ages now and still no luck, if a PC player has one to offer I‚Äòd gladly take it off your hands.
---
Isn't this par for the course though? Bethesa game needing people to break it to make it fun? (ie modding, etc)
---
well said.  everything on your list is non combat so having to swap perks for these tasks is annoying.  
---
If "balance" is a problem then only let it work when there are no enemies nearby or similar like fast travel.
---
Same as far as I know. And its yellowcake the most overly abundant of the fluxes. Lol
---
I believe there is an ini file in c/users/user/documents/my games (not sure if that is exactly right, but hopefully close) did you delete those too?
---
Frick or fick? I usually use fick.
---
Haha, I don't mean to be rude, but you were a bike courier and an alcoholic yet you are 100% sure it was the *coffee* that's killing you? Mmkay!
---
Does tank killer not provide armor pen? Or does that only work with ballistic rifles?
---
Fist weapons are extremely cheese-able, but actually-unarmed combat is not really viable.
---
OMG yes! 
---
Literally everyone over level 100 on here taking about looking for things to do ü§î. If you don't think it sounds fun, fine.  But plenty of people have time...
---
Do you launch from the Bethesda launcher?
---
So if I get a power fist for higher levels and brass knuckles for lower levels, I can just ORA ORA ORA my way through anything?
---
I only take them if they're unclaimed. I usually just use them to get plans and for fast travel.
---
I wish there was more fresh music, mix of new and rehashed from other games
---
Anyways appalachia, cept one day i did classical... mutant went flying on a crescendo* and it was glorious
---
*cant spell, could be correct
---
I‚Äôve never been able to pick up a daily twice, and I just stopped by after 20+ hours since I completed Bivs last daily, and the pattern continues. 
---
No more recipes for me, it seems. 
---
They key wasn‚Äôt the issue for me I‚Äôve been hopping for the past hour just trying to get actual plans.
---
Always.  Never had this issue before.  
---
Bobble head. 
---
Got the plan luckily without the key. Willing to paint some PA if people would like. Only on xb1 tho. All I ask is for a donation of whatever stuff you don't want; bullets, junk, food, etc
---

I'm like lvl 85, having no problems murdering everything with a lvl 35 vampire power fist.
---
Very much appreciated, been trying to get up there for a minute.
---
Two words: milk it.
---
I'm never going to get the head.
---
My goal since beta was to get this costume. I played them all the first time, then they all stopped working until they fixed it so the "chow line" couldn't be done more than once a day. It had only ever worked once for me. But after that update they all worked fine. 
---
Then after update 6 chow line auto failed every third day, so I haven't played it since update 6.
---
And now none of them even trigger.
---
*Nice*
---
Also,
---
*ORA ORA ORA*
---
Well, I looked at the top page of /r/fo76 and didn't see it and it *should* have been *there*.
---
Not trying to start an argument here, I even admitted that I was being petty. 
---
And correct, you never outright admitted that you figured it out, but you allude to it "I'll try and get another video out as soon as I find more stuff like this." Which kinda leads the reader to believe you found the paint job yourself.
---
Regardless of where you found it, you should always credit if you were not the one to originally find it.
---
Ohhh, I didn't know that!
---
That seems to have fixed the problem!
---
Thank you so much!
---
Whatever that means.
---
Now begins my attemp to get my friends to give enough of a crap to reinstall and check.... Sigh
---
Why was it exclusive?
---
Yes, thanks - I just deleted my custom.ini for now and it's working.
---
I'll redo the mods later.
---
Do you plan on doing more runs?
---
Whenever Jotaro punches anything in the show, he says Ora repeatedly 
---
It was only in the atom shop for 1 day I believe 
---
Is there a desirable PvP weapon to combat this? I'm a rifleman build.
---
I get all the time on ps4
---
I got as far as the top of Tanagra, but couldn't make the jump across to get to the 2nd Key Card without Marsupial.
---
Same. And i only had like 230lbs of items when i got banned.

---
It only applies to ballistic rifles at the moment. 
---
I really think you have a strange definition of "empathy." If someone thinks you're wrong...and says so, they have no empathy? In my humble, fallable opinion, you need to grow up emotionally, and learn that because someone disagrees with you, and says so, doesn't make them an asshole. That's what empathy means. The ability to put yourself in the other person's shoes. It doesn't mean you have to agree with them.
---
I had unkillable enemies with melee and had to shoot them! I think it was a borked server 
---
Well I wouldnt say best online game, but its definitely very fun. The game doesn't teach you much, and you learn as you go, but it's part of the fun
---
No, it makes him look stupid, and you even stupider to defend him.
---
Ha! I don't even own a Windows computer. I play on ps4. I just have a lot of down time at work, so I browse this subreddit alot.
---
I'll stop using mods once they let us toggle nude mode in the game.
---
It's simply *WAY* too much fun to run around naked, or have a spell that makes NPCs naked to give it up.
---
IMO every game like this should have things like nudity, sex, peeing, etc.  Not turned on by default, but at least as an OPTION!
---
Lol 
---
And perhaps cooking oil instead of boiled water. 
---
Absolutely gorgeous stuff! I love it!
---
Yep. Shotgun with enforcer gets her on the ground and keeps her there where the melee guys can wail on her.  
---
My now level 60 alt can also make noticeable hits on her with a bloodied Gauss from sneak as it's damage per hit, from sneak, is almost on par with bloodied melee builds. 
---
It's more One Punch than JoJo, but more-or-less, yes.
---
There *should* be that many posts - hopefully it'd push them to give better support to the modding community!
---
I see, thanks! 
---
I'll do 5.5k for the shotty if you can hold until sunday. I work out of town until 10p EST Saturday :(
---
I'm a level 200+ and I have plenty to do. Waking up and trying to find my gear for a weird invincibility mode seems silly and is not going to add anything to the game in a significant way for higher levels or lower. 
---
Also imagine going to get your loot and getting disconnected because your internet goes out. I'm sure they could make some failsafe but who's going to trust that.  
---
Haha. Well your downtime is much appreciated today!
---
Maybe scan and repair?
---
Please!!!! I want to fish in this game. 
---
I haven't even been able to do a single daily from Biv. I finished the initial quest and went back to him yesterday and today and nothing. I'm stuck with the base alcohols and Nukashine, and can't get the weekly challenges now. It was actually the reason I made the post, since I was super excited for the brewing content and now I don't get to experience it.
---
Never had this issue until yesterday, happened 6 or 7 times I‚Äôd say. Load screens have suddenly gotten a whole lot longer for me too.
---
Only if you‚Äôre judgmental. You downvoted me and I upvoted you man. Grammar is important, but the dudes just excited to play the game and wants to meet others who are. Let him be
---
You must be fun at parties. You do birthdays? I'd pay top dollar someone who writes their own songs.
---
Most "salt" I see is from sanctimonious posts like this that continue to blanket blame all who were banned as cheaters
---
They seem to have increased the visibility of some nuked flora.  Ferns have glowy flowers now

Haven‚Äôt gotten a single Camden park daily since new update , Xbox here I‚Äôm only missing 300 more tokens so whoever wants to give me some for free : GT manny sandov
---
Sonic cannon could work. 
---

---
Nice man i can see it now:   
---
lvl 1 winds up on the roof of the building outside glassed caverns :P
---
As an avid fisherman, who wanders the wasteland in my fisherman outfit. I would love this!
---
Census violence has done this to me a few times in the bog 
---
Tried to tame a level 1 house cat and he ran away 
---
sadly yes
---
Yeah that was the last daily to go for me. So no more daily except the new one. It's a joke
---
That's the bee's knees
---
You‚Äôre offline. 
---
Keep trying there‚Äôs people out there hoarding those plans for profit keep hoping 
---
Xbox use UnrulySpoon9279 
---
Jet pack is worse as I‚Äôve only purchased one in my entire playtime yet the plan for the paint was found after only 3 hops 
---
Nuked the bog for crimson this morning
---
Yeah, you'd like a puncturing powerfist.  One of the best unarmed weapons in the game.
---
This looks like the next DLC 
---
Fallout: Footloose
---
by me saying "I'll try to get a video out when I find more stuff like this" is really just that, I found a post telling me how to do it. any time I see something interested in the game I'm going to make a video to show my subscribers and Friends same as somebody sharing a screenshot same as somebody making a post telling people about it. I make videos of everything I find in Fallout lately for people my video I made two days ago was how to do The stills and have a start that mission because people apparently couldn't figure that out. 
---
I didn't give credit because I didn't get the information from you I also made the video myself so I didn't feel I needed to give credit anywhere considering its in-game content and hundreds of people will eventually have figured it out like if I did a video right now for the original nuka paint job I definitely wouldn't be citing anybody wear I got the information from as it's all over the Internet and hundreds of guides on it.
---
Also there isn't information on how to complete the quest but there is information on the notes and where to find them to start the nuka cola Quantum paint job quest in the official guide book. My friend has a copy he paid $170 for. So Im sure someone would have figured it out within the next couple days if you and other people didn't data-mine my friend was already working on it. 
---
you're right I'll admit I'm not the very first person to ever do this or figure it out. But I did make a video to inform people on it and the only thing I've been doing is saying thank you whenever people thank me for it. There's no reason to get mad or worked up over it. 
---
Like I said in the last comment if it was you that figured it out first thanks. I'm going to continue to spread the knowledge and not take credit for it like I have been. Only thing I take credit for is making the video. Oh and for actually completing the task to get it.
---
Oh nice and convenient to everything else important to do in game past level 10ish lol. Oh and after paying to travel there I have to pay you for drinks or in other words completely irrelevant shit in the game which I can craft myself after doing a few dailies. OMFG save me a seat ILL BE RIGHT THERE!!!!!!!!!!!
---
You could have had the whole server there, but if everyone's gear is mid tier at best, you're guaranteed to fail. 
---
Her difficulty scales with the number of players in the event (this is why is high levels get pissed about low levels tagging then hiding and waiting for the event to end). If everyone has mediocre weapons or half-hearted builds, she'll be quite difficult to kill. Meanwhile, just one or two min-max types can have her dead long before the timer runs out, regardless of how many other show up. 
---
Tips:  
---
- Cripple her so melee guys can get in the action   
---
- Keep her crippled so she doesn't take off.   
---
- Control the spawns so they don't stagger or kill the heavy hitters.    
---
- Place the epicenter towards the south east of FSP so the fight can take place outside of the nuke zone.  As long as FSP is inside the circle, she will spawn.    
---
- If you're using ballistic weapons, Prime receivers help give you an extra boost against the SBQ (and Scorched in general)     
---
- If you're using Melee, armor piercing perks and mods are a necessity.  Her DR's are very high.   
---
I‚Äôm over here like... who TF wouldn‚Äôt want that water??
---
Has everybody gone CRAZY?!?!!
---
Off topic, but Is the phrase as victoriam used by the bos at this point 
---
Oooooooonnnneeee puuuuuuunch!!!!!
---
guilty as charged. i feel like i spend a lot of time burning down while my character and I enjoy some clifftop views. 
---
Did you try to just Sprint across? In the video I just Sprint across the Gap to the other side where the key card is. I'm not sure if you can get up to the second floor without marsupial the ones up there you should be able to run right across the gap. 
---
Wait I also have birdbones on that might help with the running across. 
---
I will add that to the description in the video that you should have marsupial to get the second key card. Thanks for pointing that up
---
Black powder pistol + legendary 25 reload speed + exploding ammo +stranger in number + speed demon , this only the base  you could add 5 point on demolition 9 point on gun damage ( 45%) plus base damage + 3 bloody mes ( 15 % ) plus base damage , etc...
---
Same here I got it after patch , before patch I never got anything other then ammo and once I got a jacket with fur like a bomber jacket 
---
Sorry for the long explanation lol
---
What system ? Pc Xbox or ps4?
---
Time to design some wind powered elevators lol (You can use the blades to carry you up a little, but it's pretty slow).
---
There are Ash Roses in game... Not saying it's the right answer.
---
You could get legendary knuckles that have increased swing speed.
---
Because if it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs fermentable 
---
I was always overflowing with fluorescent. 
---
They barely let those who were banned know they were. 
---
Does anyone wanna group up and chug nuka together and see if we land in the same spots (ps4)
---
Prob stealth sniper (idk if snipers are considered rifles, as I am heavy ballistic/energy weapons)
---
World full. Darn, i've been waiting on a SBQ fight.
---
Embrace it , use junkie weapons , if crafting correctly you should have 10 of each drink and at least another 10 of the mixed variants , I‚Äôm full of booze , white russians, tequila sunrise :)
---
I‚Äôve just done 4-5 in a row.. calling it a night now, will be back on tomorrow and will post when launching! 
---
I wasted so much time looking for Clarksburg between Morgantown and Flatwoods only to be aggravated when I found out where it was. 
---
Fallout diverges from our history after WW2. Huntington (and Marshall University) were well established long before then. 
---
How about the West Virginia paint ?
---
Is making the game way easier what this game needs? Stuff rots to limit what you can hoard, if they give ways to bypass that it becomes way easier to always have the best buffs any time you need them
---
Wait. This isn‚Äôt Skyrim?
---
Duper
---
I just want to thank you for the guide, got it first try
---
They did! Where?
---
I assume it's "rare" right now since a lot of people are currently doing the quest. I was able to get it back to back on a server hop so I could give one to my friend. I went back a few times later on to try to get one for another friend but there's usually a few people doing the quest so it wasn't there. 
---
Apparently my milkshake only brings the boys within 300' of the yard.
---
Duper 
---
That give me an idea. Purified water could become dirty water over time.
---
Did you previously have an animal you pacified? 
---
What time are you doing them tomorrow?
---
VATs with any weapon. In PvE vats is a choice. In PvP it's mandatory. Headshot crits in vats ignore damage reduction so it's how you, as a rifleman, take down anyone in assassin sentinel armor. Grab a piece of chameleon armor so you are harder to find and possibly get sneak attacks stacked on top of the vats crit headshot. Auto rifles also have an advantage over semi as the perk concentrated fire basically gives auto guns free 95% hit chance after a couple of shots. Hope that helps and happy to answer any questions. I PvP a fair bit with a variety of builds.
---
This guy hacked the dev room 
---
I‚Äôm in the UK.. be pretty much all day lol
---
very sure, went through a ton of testing and specialist doctors, they all agreed that the coffee combined with the high level of exercise was the issue. After 10 years my heart has regained it's fat layer and I am back to being able to ride to the mountains to camp. The drinking wasn't destroying the fat around my heart, the dehydration that the coffee created was. Still, the drinking wasn't exactly a inconsequential part of the problem and had to stop as well.
---
I found one in the military wing, across from the vendor there. 
---
"I stoods enough! I won't stands no more!"
---
So it's a new item then?
---
I‚Äôm boutta stay up late until like 2:30am (pacific time) and just do it then there‚Äôs no reason to waste my time with it now 
---
I'm all for waking up from a blackout with new stuff on me and maybe even some randomly generated notes describing my time that I drunkenly wrote down cause I realized I was black out drunk.
---
I'm not cool with it stealing all my stuff and randomly depositing it somewhere.  If I'm so shitfaced drunk that I literally striped naked and threw all my everything into some random place, I should be dead from a million different things that could kill me in the wasteland, an alcoholic beverage making me invincible is...  Uncanny.  And what do I do when I need to defend a workshop and lo' n' behold I still can't fast travel!
---
However!  Your idea is totally on the right track and it isn't a bad idea, I just wouldn't trust Bethesda.  I can see the posts now 'HELP LOST ALL MY STUFF FROM TEKILLYA BLACKOUT AND THEN DISCONNECTING AND NOW IT'S ALL LITERALLY COMPLETELY GONE'.  I literally would uninstall permanently if that was allowed to happen inadvertently or otherwise to me.
---
I think they could get away with something similar though, maybe just unequiping all your stuff and giving you a few minutes of being 'hungover' so you can't re-equip anything until you drink some water?
---
I'unno but consider what can go wrong cause chances are things will go wrong for someone somewhere.
---
That happened to me yesterday but just once 
---
There was like 4 last time I was in there.
---
I'm still missimg plan for that one. But since i got the fusion one, i stoped using the others.
---
ƒ∞t was
---
I think you‚Äôre seeing inside of your skull there. Might be an issue with your apparel or screen settings  
---
I thought they fixed that today?
---
Nah I'm good. Purified water is one of the few things you can depend on and that's not realistic. Water isnt gonna just spoil or get dirty by been in a bottle.
---
That's literally the definition of harassment.
---
A ton of people have the same issue including me. I've tried 3 times now all different servers and different days.   It sucks bad.   I even had a friend try once i reached the end and he also couldn't.  Lots of wasted ammo and time. .   On PC btw 
---
Move windmill on the roof; they just made it possible.
---
I‚Äôm gonna kill the person who stole my plans, and killed me. I swear to god I‚Äôll find you.
---
Did for me 
---
I‚Äôm quietly devastated. My fianc√©e and I did the daily at the same time last night and I just watched her pick it up and complete it whilst Biv told me over and over that I‚Äôm his best friend and he‚Äôs definitely not lonely. 
---
Hoping this brings a bit more attention to this bug, since the daily was one of the key features, and it definitely isn‚Äôt just affecting us. 
---
I think we will be seeing future quest lines taking place in the toxic valley as well as new locations and dungeons in there
---
Unfortunately move speed is capped at 20% from all sources so once you have speed demon nothing else will increase your speed further. Not gun runner, not sleek mods, not the team running perk in charisma, none of it will do anything under any circumstances.
---
Rad goes through anything.
---
I'm not mad. It's nice to actually get an out for a quest instead of CONSTANTLY doing one and getting bupkis!! Lol
---
When was the last time you were there? I tend to go there often, and I always complain to my friend about there not being a stash. 
---
Even with all of my apparel off it's still there. I haven't messed with my screen settings either, as I'm not sure how to do that on console. 
---
I love this idea. They could import it, more or less, from Skyrim.
---
Touche. 
---
Still a no from dawg.
---
Lemonade guy ?
---
The divergent happens several times over the games history. 
---
The ww2 one simply could have been the closest one we‚Äôve seen. 
---
Did they ? I just got home from work and haven't seen anything.  If that's right then I am very happy.  I'll give it a 4th attempt in a minute lol 
---
The game crashed on me. When I went back.. it was still there. 
---
