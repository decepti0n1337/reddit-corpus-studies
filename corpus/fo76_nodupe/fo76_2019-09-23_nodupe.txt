So I started a new toon just to play with the 1 Wasteland tweaks and the beginning game is ridiculously difficult.  You dont have the "builds" and the gear and there is nowhere you can go to just farm yourself up. 
---

---
 I kept running out of ammo and couldnt make more so went to melee and every thing takes a minimum of 3 wacks with level correct weapons.  If you are after more than 2 enemies you keep dying.
---
If they want any new people they need to make enemies a proportion of your level and mix it up.  Every enemy at your level is a nonstarter under level 50.
---
---
---
Same but on xbox
---
I'll allow it. You're level 50. two of these people were 150+ another was about 110 and another was like 78 or something. 
---
basically you activate a thingy which then gives you two targets to activate. one person should approach the uplink and activate it. Don't go near them as it can stop the activation. once activated you need to stay in the area. Top right has a boost and a number. if there's 2 people you want it to say x2. f it's says 1 someone is out of the area. Soon as 1 is done move on to the next. Rinse and repeat. And then once both are done you head to an area. Kill a few mobs and a boss spawns. Kill boss. Loot corpses. Get rewards. Simples.
---
Oh and each day there's a different faction and they have a mutation which makes the op "hard" they can freeze you when they attack or be invisible until they attack you or you need to melee them to finish them off plus others.
---
It's hit and miss for me, sometimes I like to grind XP, with a team, and sometimes I just solo, for the fun of it. I am at the same level as you and I played solo for the first year and a half, mind you I also played for over 3800+ hours to achieve this level. So I think it a personal preference, XP isn't everything, neither are the legendary cards in my eyes, I was able to level up all 5 of my cards minus 1 point for intelligence, and I was able to add 2 points to my 6 card. And I am happy ethier way. I understand that it sucks trying to establish a team, but I gave up on that last week with try to get people to do the special ops event. I think it because we have such a diverse community in whole. 
---
Nonetheless I do wish you all the best!🙂
---
If a level 50 is obtainable, I must have this for my pistol packin' mama.
---
Angry Turtle said in his meat week guide video that it’s best if everyone is on the same item (drums or spit) to max out its bonus. I haven’t tested it myself but generally he tests his claims so I follow that pattern
---
The only stuff i wan is a fancy shotgun. Got 1, but need 1 more
---
Yeah thanks already have it posted I'm my camp
---
Also I don't care if you don't fight, just follow me to the objective and stim, I'll kill the scary creatures for you!
---
You’re also a looney wtf is up with the thread? Got your back OP good suggestion! And even if it wasn’t it’s good most of us don’t feel the need to write nasty shit to you about it fkn lol
---
They definitely should be showing up under Floor Decorations, to the right of the regular pink unlit ones. They do have yellow christmas lights, though; are you sure you’re missing them?
---
I'm currently in love with manhunt. Easy caps and xp and I get to hear the sweet voices of Mad Dog Malone and the warden. It's a dream come true
---
No problem. I actually just got it last night I think I have another don’t remember but I got that one last night. So glad I didn’t have drop it.
---
Oh that does sound nice! But I was just trying to think of lore friendly weapons from the BoS. And not gonna lie im a little bias for heavy weapons.
---
Hi #Microsoft, can you help look into this?
---
The Savage divide primal cuts seems to still be bugged, killing the boss in this version fails the event early!
---
Before it just refused to end till a time out!
---
OP, you’d best watch yourself, they’re wanted rodents. The have the death sentence in five regions.
---
It’s not a glitch. It’s a high level boss. That’s what he does.
---
No shit and aren’t you glad you don’t have to do that now?? Helloooooo? Are you ok
---
I am.
---
Well, see, I kind of know what you meant. Don't worry, I got the sarcasm. But I used to stretch out One Violent Night when the game still let you do it for 20 minutes or so, farming those Legendaries. Pointless now, the way Legendaries are thrown at us and since the sub-timer for that event has been shortened to 10 minutes. (Reminds me, I still have crap on me I should scrip.)
---
Maybe it's because Earle usually spawns right after a Queen if both zones are nuked and I just want to get it over with after that long ~~loading time~~ prep time, heh.
---
Edit: prep time, not loading time.
---
It’s a glitch from using collectrons so ppl get it but can’t get level 50.
---
Someone dressed in a Mr. Pebbles costume.
---
He definitely gets a cut he’s way too suss
---
I out of stash spacenfor legendary items. Glad that I have Bear Arm Perk, that way heavy weapons weigh just 1 pound.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c74858b&amp;d=ss2sg2se2sn0sm0s40p00pg0ph0pi0eu0c62cr0cu0ce0la2l71lu2lt2a72ao0a12eo2a00cd1pp2ii0iq0if0ir0ib0x03xp3xb0xj0
---
This is what I would do for a build that can use any weapon type (without using any legendary perks). Just swap out melee perks for shotgun/heavy guns, or swap commando for rifleman if needed. Lots of room to play with. If you are focusing on the "strength" classes (melee, shotgun, heavy guns), take less perception, or if you are focusing on commando/rifleman, take less strength. The rest is all pretty much the same.
---
You really don't need to take level 3 of all 3 damage perks for a weapon type. The diminishing returns just aren't worth 9 perk points. I just get the first rank of each.
---
Just hit level 100. I feel this on a different level
---
It’s not really for me to say what’s what. 
---
For all we know, they could have intended to fix it, then decided they wanted to try something else instead. So rather than fix it, they built something new.
---
I'm just in it for the tenderizer but I know I'll get it eventually.(hopefully) xP Just gotta keep on trying c:
---
Oh man I wish I had this problem, I’m usually terrified we won’t make it in time, I’ve never finished him faster than &lt;10 min left. I guess there’s not many legacy/magic users in Asia Pacific time zone on Xbox...
---
Dealt with a bad eagle captain with a auto Grenade launcher yesterday in the burning mine...welcome to lv 100 boss mode! It’s fun af!
---
I’m not really sure what you’re saying. But I’m also ok with my confusion.
---
Some hk g11s from old school fallout would be cool :)
---
I cant tell you how many times this has happened to me, since I like to play mostly in 3rd person, just someone runs in front of me or a random object gets thrown across my screen. Its infuriating
---
While it’s not exactly a service rifle, there is the Screaming Eagle skin which is pretty much an AR-10.
---
The supermutant in the burrows boss? Same thing here. Splash my way through, solo, no biggie, then spent about 4min killing this bastard. After the first few deaths, I realized I didn't have fireproof in(oops) but even with it, I was having trouble reloading because of his stuns. With teammates, not too bad, but still that shit is wild.
---
I can't enter other power armor because It wont let me leave the power armor im currently in. Even if I hold in A to confirm to like sit or enter another set of power armor.
---
Where is it at PV?
---
Yea I think it’s pretty epic
---
They trained under a master in Mortal Kombat.
---
They provide very little resources compared to a established farming route and if they removed PVP from workshops griefing elsewhere would be more commonplace. 
---
Besides how would ownership of pacifist worksops even work. Any resource can be found easily and there are plenty of online guides showing where to farm most anything. The muh resources excuse is a dead horse.
---
I shoot him and insult bot before they can even speak.lol.
---
By the way you can pre war money everywhere.
---
Really? I’m routinely in servers with 2 or 3 nukes within an hour. I almost never get on without a nuke going off at some point, and I’m never in for more than an hour or two.
---
This!
---
Just finished looking into that weapon and will say it would be an awesome addition. Looks cool and from the wiki it sounds badass.
---
So glad. But player vending made it so I never feel like I have to grind the vendors. Which I also like. 
---
There’s also caps in containers other than cap stashes. Even creatures.
---
Fireproof, problem solved. Boss really wasn't difficult at all. Just 2 of us.
---
I knew TONS of people that hated ESO when it came out. I assume like FO76 it got moderately better over time.

Some heroic lv 27 today followed close, took shots when he could and was a real mad lad in being able to take a super sledge to the face! Thanks to his quick to heel following we easily got a 5 minute 16 seconds win! Shame he left immediately, I would have handed him my duplicate rare reward.

This is the way.
---
They downvoted cause of the idiotic comments this persons posted on this sub to other people lol
---
I've played on public teams since its inception and have never ran into anyone wanting to destroy my camp or grief me. Even in public workshops, no one cared enough to take it.
---
Never met an authoritative know it all either. In fact, only time i've been commanded to go a certain area was another player signalling a legendary so others can tag it for the drop. That's optional too. Only time i've met griefers was nuke griefers in Nuclear Winter.
---
So really, you're just sounding like an overly introverted bitch trying to normalize your insecurities lmao. Maybe stop being a snowflake, or you know, miss out on xp like OP is saying. Choice is yours in the end lol, but to make the community sound worse than it actually is? Bitch ass move.
---
I second this, I set up there temporarily during the Rose-related story quests and haven’t left. I wish I could move but it’s just too convenient for fast travelling, water, and the station for selling. I have to server hop at least once a session though because it’s so popular though. (It totally sucks having a primal cuts spawn point next door though, they always come into my camp....)
---
No idea then. Maybe support can help more.
---
Play the game how you want these assholes writing stuff like play it right are exactly that, assholes. Have fun in the wasteland everyone.
---
Hoping for the war glaive like, looks v cool. I don't even run melee weapons but I'm willing to make some compromises for the glaive is just looks so cool

I fuckin love greenside it's not all meet tho I got a flag plan
---
All junk.literally crap you don't need or will ever use and you can find all of this stuff anywhere.
---
I would always avoid those areas because there was no xp there. Now I'm excited to go there. You can still go to the forest for a lvl 50 max and slaughter fools.
---
Dumb question but what do you mean by “rubber band” your controller.
---
I got it from something spitting on me.
---
Forgot was is a snally or that salamander that walks on it's hind legs
---
You still get to do your own quests in a public team. Wtf are you on about? No one bothers to join you on a solo quest. People join you on public quests, but that's a fuckin public quest lmao come the fuck on now
---
Same, had a use for the endless .38 I hadn't turned into ammo points with my Q or TS 2 star fixers. Still not too bad but have to make em all .45 now lol
---
I'm just logging on for the armor Ace and that's about it now. I'm trying to be there for more but sometimes it's hard.

One of the more subtle drawbacks from one wasteland, is that a lvl 10 medics 10mm pistol is a fun gift for a new player. No one wants a lvl 50 one star legendary. Gotten to the point where I'll drop a heavy 3 star weapon with some metal armor and a BOS recon rifle for newbies, and send them a message to grind it at a train station.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That said, I think a big problem is that the scrip also feeds itself. I get my 120-150 from the machine. I get some from random dailies. By the of two days I've generally got 400 scrip saved, and then I buy 4 weapons, turn around and scrip 3 of them, and am now nearly at the cap for that day already. Having the option of larger scrip sinks would help this. I'd happily pay 150 scrip for the ability to exempt a specific modifier from each perk slot before the roll happened. Or 150 to specifically roll a "Ranged-Ballistic" or "One handed melee" weapon. Or give us the option to trade 100 scrip for an extra 25 bullion.
---
Right now, the fact that MOST items get scrip'd means that if you spend your 150 scrip from the day, you're liable to get 40% of it back as scrip, meaning the real cap is functionally 90 scrip, since 60 of it goes into the machine, across the room to mumbles, and then right back into the machine and into my pockets.
---
VATS is broken right now, it's just about worthless for then next 6 or so months
---
Word-my life is weight-to-scrip ratios
---
I think everyone knows that prewar money is everywhere. The point of the post was to share my appreciation for this random encounter that helped me complete a weekly challenge.
---
Thanks. Mostly I’m saying I’m not passing judgement on it because I literally don’t have any real info on why. 
---
But I also didn’t do last years. So have nothing to judge it on.
---
I'm really, really hating One Wasteland.
---
This really, really sucks.  If I want a challenge I'll do a Daily Op, but my Forest house doesn't need to be constantly wrecked by Scorched and Mole Miners, and I shouldn't need to spam Stimpacks when fighting Liberators.
---
I'm partial to the bozar, but I dread how it would devour 5.56 ammo.
---
I do think they might need something *big* like youre suggesting though.
---
Other day i cleared out Daggers Den blood eagles, and these raiders were rocking plasma gatlings and plasma rifles.
---
That's not your average Viper (who use like poison darts or something) that the west coast BoS are used to.
---
Initiate Dodge is right. These guys gonna get slaughtered unless they have an ace up sleeve, some help, or really really big guns.
---
Fingers crossed!
---
In Project Paradise you can get like tons of them to spawn, they're great xp, die instantly and the leveled up xp is good.
---
Awesome post and great info. for someone who had no clue like me. TY!!
---
All I'm asking is a cosmetic outfit provide a perk. It will make it more fun and beneficial for different outfits and help identify certain builds... ie: the letterman jacket adding strength for a tank... Hell throw in a bonus for unarmed damage like they have for power armor mods.
---
Dropped Connection Enclave quests give lots of pre-war money as well
---
The basement area with the raider cache Rose sends you to get in [Key to the Past](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Key_to_the_Past). You have to have done that quest to access the area. Take the stairwell down past the raider vendor to get there.
---
&gt;/.&gt; uhh yeah, that's why i said "thank god for fireproof"
---
There was something oddly soothing reading that whole exchange. Had a flow in how I read it. Rhythm even.
---
Well, I’ll be god-damned.
---
Fasnacht is _NOT_ going to be fun next time around with everything at level 50.
---
They're killing me in Primal Cuts.  I used to be able to solo them, but the Level 100s eat up so much damn time.
---
Yeah I thought bozar too and yeah ammo would burn away!
---
I should have mentioned that. I'm aware of the Daily Ops change. This is in normal PVE.
---
Yep, saw that. Not sure why you had such a hard time. Same behavior in my ops, no stagger whatsoever.
---
Nice
---
But half the dps, sadly
---
Those random encouters will become rather annoying after the millionth time...trust me.lol
---
can just get levels for the syringer so it can friggin SCALE?
---
nothing like doing 3 dps on a level 100 enemy
---
Thanks I finally found it
---
It’s ok because you’re joking. I mean, I *hope* you’re joking.
---
Wait... did he just delete his account??
---
u/beefytrout , u/itscmillertime , anyone, can you come look for me?  Did he really delete his account?
---
No
---
Thanks for the clarification and retagging.
---
Hah that's awesome! I helped some settlers fight raiders last night,  but they  were level 75 and one had a minigun.  I was really just there for moral support.
---
He was much easier to deal with than this mutant, lol. Blood Eagle i can literally face tank with Fireproof 3.
---
Glad to help!!
---
I know I found mine in a searchable mirror over a sink in the Cranberry Bog. I’ve read there’s several mirrors that have a chance of having it.
---
Well whatever they bring i can't wait and hope for some big guns!
---
At least one that removes the rust.
---
This is the most crowded place to do it, not the most efficient xp wise though unless everyone rushes out to take advantage of that.
---
Best results ive gotten after trying various setups is just critical savvy and the rest doesn't matter. 14 or 15 base luck,  under armour with luck bonus.  
---
If you use a shotgun or weapon with multiple projectiles like beam splitter 4 leaf clover is amazing.
---
You should crit every 3rd shot unless your weapons have the vats crit legendary in which case it's every other shot. 
---
High agi for a big ap pool, high per for better acurracy in vats. Concentrated fire perk even just rank 1 is fine imo. 
---
Burst fire till you start hitting then let er rip, everyone who complains about vats being broken is just blasting away despite missing.
---
A lot of players fail to even understand the PVP consent when claiming a workshop. Your idea might work for some players. Likely it would lead to mass  complaints about being attacked in a pacifist workshop and such.
---
Yet more knee-jerk downvotes. Camp building *is* so frustrating, people. Unless you’re building a massive cube. I can’t see how even people who exclusively camp build could argue otherwise.
---
NP.
---
I didn’t realize it was really that heavy until another reditor pointed it out to me :)
---
I see them semi-frequently I feel.
---
The intelligence bonus is fantastic, each point of intelligence is around 2% extra xp so it works out to roughly a 12% bonus. That goes a long way when combined with other xp boosting items
---
First time I met this boss, I pulled out my Furious Minigun and owned that ass.
---
Good to know it might've just been a jump in difficulty though, it was getting easy to just bee-line and get sub 7 minute runs lol
---
Gotten two Gutter plans so far.  Was not amused.
---
There’s a site called Fed76.info which is a great reference. It’s data is based on PC data but even if you’re on console it’s a useful guide. It only applies to weapons and armor though. I’m not aware of anything similar that covers stuff like plans, outfits etc.
---
at 800 rads I like to think brain just melted at that stage hence the -intelligence hahaha
---
*That’s too hard...*
---
Basically you want an Instigating or Junkie's prefix on your weapon (Stalker's too but meh) with a high fire rate (about 150-200, like a Laser Gat). Or, instead of those prefixes, a secondary effect of 33% VATS crits, 50% limb damage or bashing damage. Or, since it shoots pellets which all count individually for damage, a shotty, preferably a Combat Shotgun (maybe Dual) and keep aiming at the same body part in VATS with that.
---
Or, something quite different, make any fast fire rate weapon magic by wearing an armor piece that has 15% damage resistance while blocking. 
---
Not really an exploit, but it should probably be fixed in the long term as it is kind of glitchy. There's more pressing matters like hacked weapons and hackers in NW though.
---
Presents suck
---
I've never seen the Fancy weapon and I've turned in probably 75-100 tickets since they were introduced.
---
I thought magic shotguns no longer worked.
---
Check the sass, Miss Thing! 👑🦇
---
The freezing enemies sure do make it a challenge to go "fast" at least, today. A little challenge at least. Volatile enemies are my favorite so far I think.
---
Like... A fuck ton. I normally try to keep around 8k 50. cal rounds, about 4k 5mm and 20+ fusion cores. That's minimums, I often have more. It gets heavy hahaha
---
Votes dun give U happy meals at macdonalds, doesnt matter really.
---
Absolutely. Was using Bloodied mini myself.
---
Yeah but to be fair it equals out to about 450k from the presents, also I like them for shits and gigs

There’s been at least,,, 10 players at each one on the servers Ive been on tonight (PS4)
---
Pardon me, but what does this have to do with Fallout 76?
---
Right, the only confusion I'm having here is how damn fast he was shooting, lol. Seeing others' comments here it seems I might've just gotten a surprise during my solo run, which is perfectly fine. I was just reaching out to see if anyone was getting a different boss somehow.
---
&gt; I really really really wish this game could be played offline. 
---
For real, I want my fucking console commands back lol.
---
All high level bosses have weapons that we don’t have. SBQ’ sonic rings, Imposter’s laser zap and Earle’s acid pukes, to name a few. Rockets are too conventional.
---
Thank
---
I said I already dropped it. Went to wayward and dropped it then quit the game.
---
Gimme that which I desire
---
The raider one I guess ?
---
Somehow those mole rats were deadlier than the rad scorpions, dealing much more damage to me than the scorps, and teleporting faster too!
---
I have a camp near lakeside and I farm that every chance I get.
---
Yes you have to use that one and another one but to spend time to get a level 5 gun is useless
---
I'm right there with you.  Gunsmith 4 currently, using regular combat shotgun.  Repaired before doing an event. First event Leader of the pack, gun broken before I'm even finished.  This is the 3rd event I've tried and broken every time.
---
Alright listen dumbass; you're mad that you're wrong, but that doesn't make it OK to spread misinformation.
---
I thought the outfit was like in the nuka cola ads all over the map with hair inside the helmet instead of what we have which is kind of ugly
---
it just works... except it doesn't
---
Apparently
---
&gt; You don't see a problem with the fact that bugs "wouldnt have been found otherwise"?
---
No, because it's impossible to find some bugs without looking at the data. 
---
&gt; *"He is being equally rude, and all based on the assumption that I'm blaming one cog in the machine, rather than the machine in itself."*
---
I only see him defending the innocent CMs against your petty mockery, and someone else who decided to chime in and insult his intelligence. 
---
You claim that your comment wasn't directed at the CMs, but I think that if you met them in person, I sincerely doubt you'd be mocking them like that. And the trigger point was missing out on [a free, ugly hat](https://i.imgur.com/aliuNk6.png)? That's honestly pretty sad. 
---
&gt; *"I'd rather go without his contributions than bow my head and bite my tongue for someone who thinks they can pull rank just because they tell us what is inside our Christmas presents before we unwrap them.."*
---
He "pulled rank" (as you call it) because someone was condescendingly assuming he was a new player with very little knowledge of the game, not because he needs to prove himself to you or make you "bow your head". He was simply stating that he knows a lot more about the state of the game than most people would ever want to. Nobody cares if you want to dismiss everything he does for the community. We do what we do because it's interesting and it's nice to help people, not to get validation and internet points from snotty chuckleheads.
---
I've got about 10,000 .50 cal, 10,000 5mm, 5,000 2mm, 3,000 ultracite .308, 3,000 plasma rounds, and 25 ultracite plasma cores. I have a hard on for heavy weapons.
---
Usually, I don’t mind this so much as the atomic shop version often looks lazily reskinned. Take the Fasnacht Deathclaw mask, or Brahmin grill, as examples. This time, though, it’s the seasons version that looks like the lazy reskin. Hopefully not a sign of things to come.

Literally put A Rubber band around the controller joystick so your console thinks there is input (so it does not go to sleep)
---
You contribute to the event by playing music (to turning the spit), get the rewards if the event ends successfully) all while you are AFK.
---
I don't know, I was going through the main quest and I thought the game said something about not being able to progress your own story if you're doing the quests together. I didn't ever really want to join a group anyway so I probably just misread it and didn't bother to clarify it for myself. I don't really do any public / daily quests because they are just repeatable missions and I find that pretty boring and they remind me too much of MMOs that want to force you to login everyday or else you won't get your day's worth of xp
---
Exactly, it's not like I died from the guy but the constant stagger on top of the slowing from the Op Mod made taking him out within time limit a little annoying. A welcome hurdle, but a hurdle nonetheless. Ha
---
Oh God I didn't think about that
---
Thats the story of all the ops I’ve done so far(all three of them), I don’t I don’t know the layout well enough yet, so I just look for the most confident player once it starts and shadow them for run. It’s only failed me once and I followed someone the wrong way
---
Escape artist card doesn't mention noise at all. Just sneak to lose enemies and running does effect stealth.
---
Yeah I got another person let’s do it GT OOPSALLFRAGS we rush and try to get under 6 every time but haven’t yet only like 6:05 lol
---
You'll need to build it back up so that it's not floating any more. Place a foundation, add some walls, and hope that they line up enough that the floating pieces are supported. 
---
It happens a lot when you take advantage of building quirks, like the how some doorframes can float and then be swapped back to walls without breaking. Actually, convert walls to doors and then try to remove. That may also help.
---
Edit: Also, wait, what? Bungie?
---
Perfect! I’ll join your game now!
---
I try but surely not the only one.
---
Yeah I catch myself having to be the one to do the op myself without dying which is somewhat of a task at level 25.
---
Thanks!
---
What’s ur gt im offline mode
---
No worries. It was a bit gliched, but a real blast running around like a fool, just letting loose, it kind of brought back silly childhood memories. Lol. And to be honest  I had just as much fun chasing people around with a flaming chainsaw, and dropping loot bags with candy and weapons inside. So you can still make something of it, I just really loved the event in its self that's all. I guess I kind of had my hopes up, this year. Well we will have to wait and see.

99% of the time the other members of a public team are just fast travel points that walk around.
---
It’s Blakedw420!
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Paying for the game twice so you can run it twice and play twice as many characters.
---
You can still get one stars!
---
okay, anakin.
---
The laser and plasma gatlings don’t seem to have an option for skins. At least, there’s no ‘appearance’ section for them in the modding menu, as far as I recall.
---
It happened to me the other day. I fully exited and closed down the game and it stopped doing it. It was very annoying lol.
---
Bandolier + ammo WR armor + batteries included.
---
I carry as much as I can collect.
---
Static objects (including petrified scorched, cars with health bars, Fasnacht balloons) can work for general testing but they do sometimes display misleading damage in some (rather specific) situations.
---
Example: I’ve done a half dozen tests (including another today coincidentally) on a variety of 40% bash damage miniguns. Against a whitesprings car or petrified scorched, my nocturnal’s bash/shred damage changes depending on time of day. However, against real enemies, nocturnal actually has zero effect on bash or ammoless shredder damage whatsoever. 
---
Again, this is a suuuuper specific instance and likely not on anyone else would ever encounter normally, but just wanted to mention it. I’ve seen other strange things too but I don’t want to write an essay lol for most “normal” gun/effect combos, these objects get the job done if you just want to see the raw damage.
---
Seconding the Mire. It's pretty much the only disease that I get if I forget to equip a mask there.
---
with a cat in it
---
Joining now! Just need to make food at my camp and I’m ready will take 1 min
---
Very very hard
---
Gulpers? I love those guys. They hang from trees by their tails.
---
I can only imagine but I will likely find out how it feels before I get an Ops Suit 🤣
---
Well damn. That escalated further than I expected.
---
Very true.  I love gatling plasmas personally.  Great dps extremely cheap ammo.
---
And why tf would I want to look at it from their broken perspective? We live in a fucking society.
---
Psychologists have families to feed too. Let's stop normalizing extreme introversion and anti social behaviors and get that shit sorted.
---
Objectively speaking, people CAN'T survive alone by themselves. One way or another a person WILL need help from another at least once in their miserable lives.
---
Don't get me wrong, i'm OK with "playing your way", but when a dickhead is trying to normalize their antisocial fuckery is when it triggers tf outta me.
---
I read a story a while ago about a derranged bitch that wouldn't even let her husband touch her. Intercourse was awkward as fuck. Bitch was obviously delusional, but tried to normalize that shit. Fuck that.
---
I got plans for a rare gun. I doubt it's worth using but it will look cool on the wall.
---
It's red and yellow and looks pretty bad ass
---
It's a very boring event. My friends and I have no interest this go around. 
---
If you're on the meat "spits" along with the drums during the prestart, it counts as progress towards the event at it's actual start. So, with enough people on spits and drums, the event starts almost completed. 
---
If you have the plans from the previous event, it's not attractive. But, if it's your first go, try to be on site before the event is advertised to the world. Frustrating to show up when it's completed in 3 minutes time.
---
Marsupial is too good. I don't know how people play without it, hell I don't even know how I got by before it.
---
My stealth archer still one shots the hell outta that area. Unless the mole rats show up... then I run.
---
I could be wrong, but I think this happens when you're on a Daily Ops public team.  I'm not able to get on to confirm this though.
---
Thats a good point. Probably an oversight is my guess.
---
The other thing to do would be to get perks to reduce weight and use them while in power armor.
---
In that case you bring your own disease cure. Shits are easy to make anyway.
---
Well if your argument is basically “there are better ways to farm for resources than workshops”, I could come back with “there are better ways to do PvP” as well. The whole “bUT iTs A Pvp ZoNe!1!11!!” excuse is just as old.
---
Thats pretty cool.
---
They should reward testers.
---
I don’t like scavengers level 100 they kill me in one shoot even with my 500 damage resistant armor
---
I have tried that and I even tried building up around it and I’m worried that the only option I have left is to completely destroy my camp and that’s the last thing I want to do and a follow up to your edit I commonly confuse Bungie and Bethesda because both companies have the ability to piss me off
---
If you can call this an actual reward.
---
Only time i used my heavies, strolling thru the forest with an lmg was so much fun.
---
I understand this is just for fun, but I'm not specced for rifles.  There's no way the majority of people would consistently be able to do this.
---
Which shotgun? Instigating? Two-shot? Explosive? My two-shot used to one-shot everything, now after 1 Wasteland it 2 or 3-shots everything. Still OP af.
---
He's the super mutant boss.  I deal with him no problem.  Kill him in a few seconds.
---
Sorry chief. I hadn't messed with the forest in forever due to the fact I outleveled it extremely fast and it was never worth it to go there. Now I can explore it and at least get some decent xp out of it even though the enemies are still pretty easy to kill. Its not like the forest is a challenge now, because it really isn't. Level 50 enemies drop pretty fast.

My re view
---
I saw it again
---
I’ve gotten this thing four damn times in a row now.
---
Calibrated shocks?
---
I dont carry any as of now i cant figure out what ammo type my sledge hammer takes
---
It came out quite some months ago with the gardening bundle, only been up once.
---
This is what I use, you can use some legendary perk slots to increase STR or Endurance, etc and put  the other perks you may need in
---
Most enemies in this game die in like 3 shots of any decent non auto weapon.
---
Also make sure you run Reflex sights on your weapons, makes VATS more accurate
---
All more reason for Grafton Steel and doing Uranium Fever. Those give you more than enough steel.
---
Personally i prefer the rabbit death sound effect
---
i'm a heavy gunner myself so I feel you on that but I think because it's random every week it makes it fun. I did not even have an Assault Rifle so I went with the whistle in the dark
---
It's should be unlimited scrip but limited spend at purveyor a day that would work the best.
---
High AP armour, mutations and perks that increase your sprinting. Plus knowing the map.
---
Maybe they need to bring people on as a 'Community *Feelings* Manager' so we avoid these deep wounds on our fragile feelings from "petty mockery", hey? I'm sure they could add some shining white armor as an in-game reward, too! But it would be invisible, uncraftable, acknowledged as a bug, and unfixed for 5+ months..
---
I carry around 100k u .50 and some 5mm that I get from my Armco ammo creator and about 10 ultracite plasma cores from my Gatling plasma I love to be prepared for anything in this game
---
how do i join his discord?
---
Oh haha it was literal! Lol.  Well.... guess I’ll hafta find a rubber band tonight.... that is probably the one item in my house I have never seen.... it’s very rare... 3* E rubber band
---
No, I was saying that.  I was waiting in the staging area for at least 5 minutes without starting the timer.
---
Yes, so we could get every reward item there is even faster than we do now, and grow bored even faster with that place.
---
You are going to be running the place for weeks and weeks for challanges/score, there is no hurry with the rewards. You will eventually get all of them. It's more rewarding when you finally get a reward with some % chance, than it is if you have a 100% guarantee.
---
It has kind of taken the fun out of beating them to death with my furious shovel. 
---
BONG BONG BONG
---
Why not my gt is kneetaker4898
---
Scorched pets have anger issues
---
I have never seen more legendary molerats in my life
---
today 3 people joined at me finally after waiting and calling people. It was sooooooooooooo much easier. 6 mins and its done.
---
I had to move my camp from because the lvl 22 scorched that were already getting through my missile turrets from time to time started shredding them when they became lvl 50 instead.
---
I think mutations take the place of outfit bonuses (invisible) precisely because of that: the PvP element and the surprise of not knowing other people's builds. 
---
But it would be fun for outfits to have random effects, like, +1 perception -10% carry weight.
---
Also "Text Chat" is very useful.
---
+karma Thank you for your help! Appreciate you guys!
---
I support this message.. bastards, all of dem!!
---
Thats not enough information for me to help but you'll want to perk some for a primary weapon, at least 5 points. 
---
If you drop a nukesdragon link to your build I could give you some proper advice.
---
Bro the entire map is full of resources. I didnt say that players not looking to PVP should stay out of workshops. I'm simply implying that if you take a workshop you should be prepared for a fight or to hide. 
---
Coming onto reddit and complaining about being killed inside a known PVP area is akin to complaining that your wet from going out in the rain.
---
Fuck those fuckers
---
That is why I'll never pay for atoms. I'm not giving the a dime. The game itself barely functions as is, so I'm not surprised the cosmetics don't work. Yesterday and today I had multiple crashes and at least 5 disconnected from servers. Like 5 today and 5 yesterday. Its becoming unbearable and I really want to keep playing but days like these make it feel so easy to quit. It makes me wanna put my head through a wall lol
---
Clever. Enjoy meat week
---
I wish I could trade my level ups for treasury notes
---
It might take a number of attempts to get everything close enough to being supported. It doesn't need to be precise, but it does need to be fairly close. Start removing from the top and work your way down in order to avoid additional problems. 
---
A move might be the last resort. The good news is that you can turn your base into a series of blueprints. Make them relatively small rather than doing the whole CAMP; it is frustratingly difficult -- if not impossible -- to perfectly get an entire camp structure built again from a single blueprint. Try to avoid putting g foundations in those blueprints unless it's a small structure (no more than maybe 2x2 foundations).
---
Good luck to you!
---
Edit: One of my recommendations is to keep a foundation somewhere in your CAMP that aligns on the grid with floating pieces. It doesn't have to be part of your main structure (I usually build a small 2x1 covered structure for vendors), but you'll appreciate it later. 
---
That way, you can toss down foundations until you're under floating pieces at the correct height to easily remove them. No guesswork.
---
I did
---
They went from low to high, from the perspective of your character. Not your wall's or pet's perspective necessarily.
---
I am in the forest, seems the spawns have increased and seeing scorched libs molerats etc regularly. With 2-3 hours of play per day to review and my companion / pet combination take care of business without issues. No traps/turrets whatsoever.
---
Lol your used to getting the participation trophy aren’t you?
---
I doubt any of that will have an effect on it.There was no negative effect for picking one over the other originally except a slight temporary rep loss.If they did not do it then I doubt they would bother making it a factor now.
---
If you want to know where a bot is manually, yes. You can kinda get by just finding them in the wild normally though.
---
They will have zero effect.  They both love me after all.
---
Yes! Same with the grocer BP
---
it's not quite the same, but i've switched to a legendary vampire pump shotgun.  it drops lvl 75 ghouls and scortched with one shot if you're in vats.
---
And let's not forget what they did to poor Lucy. Those evil Bastards.
---
I think he has it under each video i'm not sure how to link it, that's how I joined
---
Ok cool.  Once my build is complete and I have my perk points moved around again, I’ll mess with it to see which mod is best.  Thanks!
---
They seriously could do a better job of selling stuff on the store. So many things have cool sounds or animations but they just take a static image of the object and leave it.
---
Thanks, I’ve been rocking head shots with commando and concentrated fire, it works, but I feel I could do better. The luck thing I’ll look into..
---
When one part of the machine isn't working you don't blame the whole machine. you blame THAT ONE PART. in this case you are trying to rationalize your statements attacking the cms for what they are supposed to be doing. the part of this machine that needs fixing is always ignored because the blame gets placed on the devs or the CMs which is not where it belongs. Your comments help propogate that btw. Blame the management who decide the scope and what to be worked on, don't blame the people who are just here for us to talk to and report things to. They do the best that they actually can with what they have.
---
I'm okay with getting grenades as long as they're useful, which not a single floater grenade is.
---
Excavator armor with Calibrated shocks help and also weight reduced perks help too especially when they added the new legendary perks I can put some QOL perks now since I couldn't before
---
Why is herbivore better for guns? I've not paid enough attention to food in this game, is there a ranged buff from veggies?
---
Being the village idiot is my name AND profession :)
---
Cool, thanks!
---
QuickTip:  In the crafting benches, look in the top right for numbers in brackets, like [3/6]. That tells you how many mods for that item you’ve unlocked and how many total there are.
---
Really!
---
Yeah man the more people to speed up that timer the better it is
---
Np man
---
Just solo them, tbh
---
I need to figure out how to use it as a underground base entrance.
---
I'm 104. Mole rats show up as 50 for me.
---
If you join Prime Cuts next to the monorail on the Cranberry Bog (red part of the map) you get constantly attacked by fog crawlers, which happen to be glowing even when they don't glow.
---
Hahaha you and me both. I was trying to speak from a different view than “Raise scrip limits so I can play more RNG roulette.” It’s actually to the point where it’s only hurting new players and slowing them down.
---
I disagree.  I mean, I agree that there's no hurry to get them all, but that's not the same as completing a challenge and not getting a reward.  It a simple matter of the anticipation build on that final screen, that dopamine hit of expectation, and then seeing "Rewards: None".  That's bad UX design, and so is time gating things, plain and simple.  Easy fix, just award a plan 100% of the time.  Doesn't have to be the rare plan 100% of the time, but 1 of them should always drop once per day.
---
I find that it's usually the other way around.  With enemies scaled now, it takes a lot more firepower to take them down.  I can go in with six plasma cores, 1000k+ .50 and come out with well less than half that.  And that's just going for the objectives and dilly dalling around like other people do.
---
'calibrated shocks only get you so far, unfortunately. I think i topped out at the middle of 300 with it?
---
About 1000 5.56 and 200 2mmEC.
---
I truly don’t know where these posts come from; my excavator PA still offered MORE than enough protection, my shotgun 2-3 shots things instead of 1 shot, and I’ve died one or two times to mobs that overwhelmed me. I even have a very flexible, versatile build that’s not really invested into any one skill too much. 
---
This game is so much more enjoyable with a level of challenge to it; I give a true thank you to Bethesda for finally making me earn my caps like a true wastelander!
---
Ok, so someone suggested to ( pacify ) then leave the server .
---
I did pacify .
---
Logged out for 5 minutes and it is fixed 
---
He’s no longer attacking any thing
---
Yeah, the problem is that excavator armor isn't good compared to say...ultracite armor, which is what i'm wearing.
---
It takes FOREVER to turn in a bunch of these. Seriously everyone do yourself a favor and try to turn these often. Otherwise listening to the bot and spamming the button is so annoying.
---
I carry a shotgun and Enforcer. Four or five shots and every limb is crippled. Let the low levels feast on her.
---
But I like playing the drums - I think I make a great musician :(
---
Someone suggested ( pacify )
---
I pacified it and left the server . Waited 5 minutes and logged back in.
---
He’s fixed has been for 3-5 hours now
---
I don't remember having any issues with it really, but the developers gave that as their excuse for not doing it this year.
---
Same been unlucky lately and got the symptomatic and war glaive plan
---
Solely on their behalf: no u!
---
Also, sorry that they hurt you. I feel your pain, though I still love 'em.
---
Molerat soup
---
Legitimately had no idea about this until your post.
---
My guass shotgun is terrible for hit detection and missing in vats and it's so underpowered now my normal shotguns out perform it.
---
Maybe they're skipping Fright Night because they playtested it and realized everyone would get absolutely _slaughtered_.
---
U don’t have too but it is a guaranteed way to get it
---
Yep, it's quite strange that players hate being better. There is no reason not the be on a team.
---
i only get vault 94 jumpsuits
---
On pc it can be spawned at max level if you have the dummy plans.
---
Oh yeah good catch!
---
I just went to farm some locations with multiple safes, but I also wanted the Technical Data that can drop there.
---
Yeah, based on your example I figured it gets you most of the way and roughly equal to you pre-PA capacity. 
---
The rest comes from all the stimpacks and food/water that you might have to drop some of since it's obvious you use chemist or grocers, or take perks to compensate :/
---
I find if I keep to less than 50 stims or so, I can bear the weight on my heavy. Maybe something to consider.
---
If you run emergency protocols on it shouldn't be a problem anymore as pa has a hidden DR and with perks like Nerd Rage it can tank fairly well with a vampire weapon but if you're not running a bloody build then I don't recommend it as much
---
Also STAY GROUPED NEAR THE SIGNAL and book it to the next point once it's done.
---
People said that about battlefield V and when people started to leave they dropped the game
---
Unfat? 🤔
---
It's still super easy.
---
I truly don't know where these replies come from. They're having a problem that you're not having; what's the point of saying so when it doesn't fix their problem? Then thanking Bethesda in their face is an extra dickish touch.
---
^ Primal cuts has really been pissing me off
---
Where did you get them
---
I can and do on my main. My alt isn't quite there yet. Needs better guns.
---
Anytime you need help I got you!
---
I run T-60 power armor and I can easily say it provides good protection.
---
My BFFR 50 Cal shreads most enemies and isn't even primed.
---
I think it might just be a problem with you.
---
But for full health excavator you would need a AP regen mod for it(forgot the name atm) while running dodgy and Richochet and tank with full health also
---
This is a great haul, thank you!
---
My favorite is when I accidentally take rad x and realize how caca doodoo I am without mutations.
---
I HATE THEM!
---
I gave my bloodied godrolls to my mules but I am still wearing the same full set of Unyielding Marine.
---
Unyielding benefits still apply, Mutations still work. See it as a chance of trying new perks and legendary effects on your weapons. 
---
But yeah, I miss checking my screen and seeing the crazy numbers my unarmed ninja was capable of.
---
You can still buy your way through the season... Though I guess it would be more expensive to buy a whole seasons worth of ranks than buying a bundle or two.
---
Already found from a current exploit, one of the possible items. Supposedly it's going to be a quest/event reward from the BoS, but the fact that it's already in game proves that they added the bull barrel back into the live version of the game, since early last year datamines showed it was incomplete and missing meshes etc
---
You are getting up to two legendaries (1 guaranteed per run, one additional once a day). And up to 3 plans/day depending on your luck. That's plenty.
---
Ah, I see.
---
We makin bank gentleman
---
Depends on your region
---
Pocket sand!
---
Definitely chemist &gt; grocers. You don't need to carry as much food and water as it's a linear decay. I wouldn't even put pts in through hiker.
---
When you need stimpacks, sometimes until you're using them you don't know how many you will need. Chemist saves you 3 perk pts for that :)
---
Idk.  As it is now, daily ops is kinda boring.
---
They were being rewarded back in the PTS
---
I agree my pa heavy gunner was by far the least effected by the nerf. And emergency protocols is no joke as far as dr goes.
---
I still only have the glaive and stash box.  3 stash box plans, one glaive, the rest.....NONE
---
Don't forgot up to 100 script as well as you have a chance for 2 currencies your first run and they can be the same one.
---
You described why I dont like the beach
---
Liberators demolished a camp of scorched earlier today for me in one of the cranberry glades
---
The worst of all imo is bloodbugs. Wiry ass skeleton hitbox, they regen health when they damage you, they're always in big swarms, and they're way tougher than they have any right to be
---
But what about like splash dmg frm explosions or does the explosion only could once. Ie to say, if i shot 1x ghoul with my tse vs shooting 3 ghouls. Honestly i would test all these myself if we have a dps dummy like the one in terraria :/ i mean they could jus spawn one of em immortal floating super mutants
---
I would be fine with yao guai or any of those other melee mobs because my turrets always catch them (perhaps it is because I have spotlights and turrets set up incircling my base up high enough that only ranged mobs or teleporters could attack them). My problem comes from the ranged mobs who seem to be able to snipe the base from miles away where my turrets can not even hit them and my ally just sitting on his @$$ watching it happen. I do not have any resource collectors (unless you count water purifiers or Collectron robots). It happened before but recently it has been happening more often. Do not get me wrong I do not mind a challenge but turrets and allies main job is to protect the base and so if I have max turrets at my base setting 4 spotlight turrets (1 in each corner) then making the other 6 missile turrets (10 turrets is maximum) sit along the sides (spaced so everything should be covered). most if not all turrets have a view of the locked gate/door which is used to gain access to the base (yep its a tower base) and the allies bar is sitting outside (figured that might make him more willing to do his job but it does not seem to matter). Oddly my friends base never gets attacked at all despite the fact they have no turrets or defenses setup making them an easy target. Makes me wonder if the system is broken and only attacking players with defenses (the higher your defenses the more they attack) which should be the opposite.
---
I usually use splodeys out in the open. In dungeons I use my vampire guns. 
---
#teamedward
---
Last time I ended up putting those big concrete walls to try and stop them coming in, now I’ve got communist fences which can’t be targeted so should do a better job. Hopefully that solves the issue lol
---
Yup I’m having the same issue.
---
Ops will be getting updated. There was an article posted earlier in the week where someone on the development team was discussing them. Apparently while this round is titled "Uplink" the next lot will centre around stealth. The idea behind them will be a continuing mix of objectives, dungeons and enemies so all kinds of playstyles can get something out of it
---
EDIT [found the article](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iuqcr5/psa_2nd_mode_of_daily_ops_will_be_stealth/)
---
Really? I’ve been having a lot of fun with it.
---
What’s been causing it to be boring for you?
---
Zooming in on the map fixes it
---
molerats ultimate form
---
They should make Legendaries scale to the wielder.  If you're level 5, it acts like a level 5 gun.  If you're level 70, it acts like a level 50 gun.  And so on.
---
Skins also work with it. Blue Camo works as shown in the Atom Shop, American makes it fade from the red base of the barrel to black on the end, and Golden turns the barrel black. Not sure if that's how it's supposed to be but odd choice if it is.
---
I can’t with these comments 😂
---
Right now I'm specced commando, but recently found a magic shotgun that one shots most mobs, so I currently have 9k .45 and 4k shotgun shells. Everything else gets sold at 1 cap. :D
---
Normally its once a year
---
True, just gotta get that far in the scoreboard
---
Is Fright Night the Halloween event in the Whitespring where you can get costumes and those pumpkin displays? I never played it but is it that difficult?
---
At least lower their health, right? Why does a level 100 radstag eat three bullets from an end game build?
---
Sounds like the regular level 100 boss
---
I understand what you are saying. I do. But if i blame *any* individual part of the machine, then someone other than you would come in to *their* defence instead saying "it's not the devs!" or "it's not the management!" but they operate under the same banner. That banner is their face, and their reputation. Pointing the finger at that banner, even if using specific examples of some of the minor cogs operating under it, means that not only the face but also the reputation of the banner is at risk. Because I am not paid to fix the machine, I don't need to lose myself in the details of which individual part is to blame. It isn't *my* machine. I assume there is someone on their payroll to figure out where exactly the blame belongs, and it will inevitably he weighed against the pros and cons, profits and loss, and time constraints/throughput. A threat to their face and reputation is a threat to their profit, and if normal circumstances deem the problem in question as negligible then it is probably the last chance we have at getting it fixed or the reporting/actioning process being revised.
---
So while you are correct in saying that blaming the entire machine isn't right, I'd counter by saying that if it isn't *my* machine then it is the more **constructive** path to take and the most likely to get results. If i trust them to do anything, it is allocating blame and protecting profits/reputation.
---
Define "decent weapon", please.  :)
---
I think you completely missed my point. No one is complaining about being killed. I actually do enjoy the thrill of anticipation while visiting my workshop or the sound of the notification it’s being attacked. The problem is how some PvP diehards do it on that very first encounter. I’ve been killed too many times while in build mode without even being aware my workshop is being contested. It’s even worse for low levels. I’m not mad about getting wet in the rain, but the dick flying his brand new truck through a huge puddle right next to me on purpose is still a f*cking dick.
---
As to your “the map is full of resources” comment, I think you should try the majestic nature of passive resource collection. I’ve never had to actively farm for resources. Claim a few workshops and go do your shit while occasionally emptying the extractors and collectrons. No need for a brain numbing grind and never in shortage of junk. It’s glorious.
---
Be nice if they did some daily leaderboards as well.
---
Off topic.. I take it you didn't play games 15-20 years ago :D
---
No you don't, there are options with Microsoft.
---
You can build a pc, you can stream to a tablet or online, or buy one of the consoles.
---
Or you could start a petition to any
---
Sony to allow game pass on ps5 😜
---
The same enemies as everywhere else on the map accept the one final boss.  No new distinct areas.  All you do is sprint to the point, kill some enemies, sprint to the next point, etc.  Very very samey.
---
I wish I would've been able to experience that myself lol
---
Gonna go with an anniversary type thing that might pop up on the Atom shop if the decide to re-release.
---
Ahoy! it's Captain Feathersword 
---
Haven't heard that one since my oldest was a young fella, and I  used to watch the Wiggles with him.... man I  feel old now
---
Long barrel, sights, extra large mag, speedy receiver, prime receiver, bayonet, comfort grip. The only one I would not recommend is the sights unless you're using vats or using a skin, because it actually obscures your aiming pretty badly.
---
I got it but it didn't count towards the achievement.
---
Question,
---
If I join a team, will I automatically be thrown into the daily ops with them if a member starts it or how does it work? I’ve only soloed it thus far.
---
Seeing level 50/100 mole rats is the stuff of nightmares. Little fuckers got the hitbox of Yoda and ferocity of a Yao Guai.
---
Nice. Glad to hear that.
---
I'd be fine with getting 'None' as a reward, if you could try again immediately. Who knows, maybe you'll get 'None' again, and then again after that. So to anyone who retorts "BuT ThE GrInD Is nEeDeD", there would still potentially be a grind. It just wouldn't be so frustrating as it is right now.
---
Being denied a reward, and then having to wait a full 24 hours before you can try again, is not good game design. It's shitty time-gating.
---
It’s happened to me. Think I’m locked onto the signal, an enemy nudges me, and then in haste to get the signal again, accidentally trigger the PA exit animation. It’s partly lame UX and partly lame me.
---
I'm a commando so I like to start with 10k and when I get to about 1k I get it back up to 10k
---
I've seen tons of people at primal cuts, and personally think it's much more fun with the one wasteland changes
---
I agree it is not perfect, but I like some  pvp in Adventure and what we got now seems to piss off 90% of the players.  BGS clearly wants more players in PA and more ammo consumption. Rewards based on XP and workshop claims.  They are going to get used more and pacifists are passionate about ending PVP in workshops and I would like to see a workaround before they just remove the PVP.  Bought the game at launch and I grab workshops all the time and have only been challenged a few times.  Most guys cap me in build mode. One helped me defend it then when I waved killed me.  That was funny.  I totally didn't expect it.  Sorry, rambling,  my point is not even 1% contested.  That means 99% could care less if BGS removes the PVP.  I think we need something better or it will be gone.
---
I would love to hear your thoughts or ideas 🙂
---
I want an assault rifle skin or two.
---
Or level 64 ones in my case...have adjusted to update, but biggest problem enemies are Super Mutants (understandable), and frigging Mole Rats...I can take down a lvl 64 ghoul with two shots, why does a mole rat take four to die from a three star Vamp/exploding shotgun??
---
They need to be exterminated someone call Orkin.
---
Also OP: Sorry about your whole mom and the Sand people thing...
---
That's a good idea. I do sort of like the idea that a good legendary drop at lvl 40 could make you retool your build and replace the level 25/30 legendary you had for a new playstyle, which would go away. And it may be awkward letting low letting lower level players buy a scaling almost perfect gun for 250 caps because it's too light weight for me to bother scriping it.
---
But then, maybe that's just the way it works in One Wasteland.
---
Was gifted 15K ult 2mm which I can’t stash because it would take up about 700 pounds of my stash and I don’t have the Gauss minigun yet, have 20 fusion and 50 ult fusion, 1k ult plasma, 3k 5mm and 11k 308
---
I like to switch between my heavy weapons a lot to make things interesting just a shame the ammo weighs a shit tonne without bandolier and batteries included
---
I always put a Mr. Pebbles poster in my camp whenever I move. Little buddy deserves a celebration!
---
I'm I'm not usually too mad at bloodbugs but stingwings make my blood boil
---
And if you see someone activating the signal booster, back the fuck up. So many times have I had someone run right up next to me and interrupt the process, causing me to start over.
---
We noticed that before we noticed we got a Tendy Plan.
---
I play stealthy, semi-auto non-heavy guns stuff.  So around 2K for each gun I'm actually carrying at any one time (currently, that's .556 for the Handmade, and 10mm for an SMG).
---
It was challenging but not ‘difficult’, with lower-level enemies.
---
the difference in resistances is more than made up for by the carry weight imo, combined with calibrated shocks you can get v good carry weight. I also believe angry turtle demonstrated that the difference in resistances is pretty negligible in one of his videos. Don't quote me on that last bit though
---
TIL apparently i carry very little ammo compared to most people.....
---
I usually have like 500 or so lol
---
I'm surprised I dont see more of these posts haha. 
---
But I guess the visual cues are also decent in game. There's a  cooler for the trash and a cooler for the greens.
---
If you walk up to fire or poop, you're presented with interact option.
---
And if you man the drums or spits, the things go "ding" every few seconds to tell you you're contributing.
---
It seemed intuitive enough to me, but yes, it would be nice if they just wrote out the tasks.
---
I tried it today and have not liked the primal cuts.  Nobody shows up.  Waves of ground digging enemies.
---
From there, why not optimize fast travel costs rather than forcing us to fast travel twice? Calculate the cost from the nearest known free spot?
---
I think it's definitely a quality of life improvement.
---
I use one - works great.  One or two shots the vast majority of things out there, but I do keep an AA Fixer around just in case there's something tanky.  Not hitting too many shots so it tends to stay in good shape for a good while as well.
---
They can join at anytime. Just make the team and wait.
---
That's why I only try to have Rad-x Diluted or now Rad Shield since I just completed that quest. Neither of those stop mutations, don't really get why they had to make Rad-x do it.
---
You won’t be forced to join the ops once you join the team, or even if another teammate is doing the event. If you open your map and then open the daily ops tab located at the bottom left of the screen, then that gives you the option to join the event area and participate.
---
Alternatively, you can open your social menu and choose to fast travel to the teammate who is doing the ops event. That will throw you into the area and the event with the teammate
---
Shame the handmade skins all seem to be low poly and blurry mismapped textures.
---
stingwings are worse than cazadores. at least you can hit cazadores.
---
As long as it's a public team, if not you'll have to invite specific people to team.
---
Isn't he dual wielding? Triple and quad rocket launchers fire fast and if he's holding 2 then look out, that's 8 rounds before reload.
---
r/prequelmemes will enjoy this
---
I leveled up twice today just by running around looking for 100 pre-war dollars.
---
Atleast when you get swarmed by cazadores you aren't killed instantly and you can atleast fight a cazadore up close
---
You mean stuff like the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation 1? When games had pretty clear directions and objectives? I did, why do you ask?
---
Did you mean 30-40 Years ago? Like NES, SNES, and Genesis stuff?
---
Somehow the mole rats are doing more damage than the rad scorpions they really fucked up on the levels scaling!
---
Tanky - so bosses for sure. I dont plan on my rifle fella excelling at bosses, and thats cool. I'll fight wendigo spawn or something. 
---
How does it do vs behemoths, fog crawlers, gulpers and the like in your opinion?
---
What about daily ops?
---
Yes that would be awesome...
---
If you didn’t fine enough, people recommended Collision Course at the east end of Morgantown Airport. It’s trigger able just by going there.
---
Quite meh update. I said this before, but i still don't understand their decision to bring back stuff that was in there like 1 or 2 months ago and not stuff that hasn't seen the ATX since forever. At least we got a free flamingo and a cute icon for free.
---
The daily ops super mutant boss is always this guy. Massive health pool aside, his rapid fire missile launcher is what makes him tougher and more interesting than regular super mutants. This is similar to the blood eagle boss who has an auto grenade launcher that never has to reload. Now that we know what the bosses are and what they'll be hitting us with it's just a matter of arriving prepared (dense chest mod, fireproof perk, etc).
---
I absolutely hate that the stash boxes on 76 are all connected. If I go in a floor safe a shouldn't see all my magazines that are on their own shelf. Would it have been that hard to have separate containers like the past games? I hate myself kinda for it but I'm glad to have that unlimited scrap space.
---
It's an important means of stocking up on treasury notes so I can be lazier later on.
---
Also it's important to point out the balence issues with the borked level scaling and nerfed weapons!
---
Actually, i think most of it its the radaway i have...Somehow i got like 200 things of radaway.
---
I sense a hint of sarcasm ?
---
Flipside, though:  maybe that level 15 guy just got a gun to drop for them, that doesn't work for **their** build and playstyle, *BUT IS A GODROLL FOR YOU.*
---
So instead of selling that almost-perfect-but-not-quite gun to him for 250c ... **you trade gun for gun**, and *both* walk away happy.  :)
---
Same difference, really - it’s also why my scientist PA rifleman main refuses to take marsupial (though I personally think it feels silly to use).
---
For some reason innocent things that help the players are a higher priority!
---
I imagine they’ll only have a throwaway line. “Oh you supported x group”. Hopefully it won’t be bugged and be the wrong line like the ones I got at the end of the final Wastelanders mission anyway (they said people died who didn’t... apparently a bug caused by being in a group?)
---
I completed it. Thanks tho.
---
I agree, I was hoping they'd have at least one new plan or somthing new compared to last time, not really suprised it's exactly the same, though. I'm also only there for the XP but I still enjoy it.
---
Maybe one that turns it into an MG34 or M60 instead of the MG42
---
I mean, I just watched at least 6 players just standing at the grill in the center trying to do... something, for 8 minutes.
---
Not for me!
---
Explosive is terrible on an instigating weapon, sure you do alot of damage to the first guy but when his buddies  get hit with  the explosive it ruins the instigating on them.
---
You have to realize their are casual players and their are endgame players. These causal players don’t care about getting the most XP or grinding events, they don’t even know what a public team is, half of them haven’t even stepped foot in a public server. You can’t expect casual players to play like endgame players
---
Yep I joined in wearing my raider power armor at lvl 22, popped some lunch boxes for everyone and took a shot at every enemy I saw. Hit lvl 25 by the end
---
What a lovely day to adventure!
---
Pack of level 100 glowing molerats: Hey that’s a nice health bar you have there, sure would be a shame if it just turned red from us standing near you. Hey you like whack-a-mole? Try our new advanced version where we teleport hundreds of feet away and back repeatedly!
---
For sure. I agree it's better to have it written out or give us those diamond markers.
---
Boat loads of it.
---
5.56, 5mm and shotgun I usually carry at least 7K of each and .50 cal I try to keep about 12K+ 
---
I'm an ammo and stimpak hoarder, most of my weight is because of it, it's a lifestyle choice
---
Splash damage from explosions count as a second hit, two shot splits that into 4 hits to the durability per shot, unless another enemy was standing nearby, then its more!
---
You can get a refund by submitting a ticket at help.bethesda.net
---
I love him honestly lol
---
They were the worst for me, until I ran into a Level 100 Mirelurk Queen.
---
I remember it being twice last year, twice this year now too. Around the same times of year.
---
I use the camera to locate my loot.
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the feedback.
---
You don't have to spend money on 76 anyway.
---
Even if you did have to I don't see why you would punish yourself like that.
---
If you don't mind me asking, did you find those plans at a player vendor?  And if so, how much did he ask for it?
---
I'm looking to replace my windmills because i thought they would make less noise than my generators but somehow those infernal things manage to produce an even more annoying sound.
---
\*Edit\* I'm not looking to buy yours or anything, i just wanted to get an idea of what prices people are asking for those plans.
---
Leads to the dark side, hate does.
---
I agree they should’ve added a couple new things, especially if the event is hourly, and there aren’t all that many rewards to begin with. Also I’m just saying this to say it, I want some cult of the mothman events or quest lines.
---
Don't know about last year but this year it's a special extra meat cook because we donated to atlas
---
Seriously, I was in one earlier where we could have gotten the 8 minute mark but one the lv80 was nowhere to be seen until we were halfway through the second uplink. 
---
Worst part is the time ended up being 8:30-ish so if they actually helped with the uplink we’d have hit the goal
---
If you haven't tried it yet, Marsupial, Bird Bones, and Secret Service jetpack and fall damage reduction gear means you spend more time flying than walking :D
---
I can jump on anytime to give you some if your around
---
Do this.
---
Solid gun, it will do work with demo expert and rifle perks.  Add in stealth and covert operative and should ohk most mooks.
---
Not a good option for bosses though.
---
Well there was a one just a month ago. I’m
---
Doing them just for the notes.
---
It basically boils down to this trial and error process that Bethesdq keeps using in this game content wise. So whenever they add new stuff thats more streamlined, they for whatever reason do not bring the older content up to par. 
---
One of my favorite PA paints is the blackbird paint and I think it would look absolutely sick on the T-65, but no. 1800 atoms to just let that paint go to waste because the devs can't be bothered to add the new PA.
---
I use a VATS/Crit/Stealth build.
---
The rule of thumb is if I can chain headshots on virgin enemies things go extremely smoothly and quickly.  If something dings their health just a little it reeaaaaallly gums up the flow and makes things spongey.    Behemoths aren't much of an issue for some reason.  Gulpers feel like I'm pounding on a bag of cement though.  Can't say I notice anything particular about Fog Crawlers but I run into them so rarely it's hard to really have an opinion.  They're not hard or anything, but they don't go down in one or two shots.
---
Gulpers are probably obnoxious due to the stagger.  I swear those things have more HP than a blasted Deathclaw though.
---
Ops are fine - mutants and eagles are damn easy, though the resilient is a nuisance.  Robots I usually use the AA Fixer though.  A few at a time like AWOL is fine because you've got plenty of time to reload - when you're getting constantly swarmed you really feel the 5 shot animation.
---
I would just rather have the ability to make the graphics look like absolute butts if it could give console better framerates and load times. For Todd's love of skyrim, 15 fps on a console game 2 years after release just to keep graphics higher is abysmal.
---
Thank you for the comment on this. After one wastelanders, I notice instigating explosive to outperform my bloodied non explosive, since I also run low hp with instigating. It is also only sometimes enemies are bunched, not the norm.
---
The difference between having a bloodied lever at low hp or having a stock lever at low hp is now much smaller than it used to be :/
---
You can sometimes build up to it and try to reconnect it to a structure it recognizes. If that doesn't work, you can try replacing your camp and hope that the blueprint sets down. If not you will them have to rebuild.
---
I had this issue with a foundation that was floating. Blueprint failed to set down so I had to rebuild. Gave me an opportunity to make changes that were better than the original.
---
Yeah he’s op but has nothing on my AA lmg
---
Can you explain? I'm curious
---
wait... is there an actual legendary spoon?  can I mod bleeding and armor piercing on it and use it instead of my pink waffle bat?
---
And considering the vicious hit melee got in the nerf, they aren't even that good!
---
Their own fault for missing out, no one to blame but them. I love the game but it's a bug fest that's almost still a beta.
---
By far my most played fallout but I'm just saying.
---
That’s disturbing
---
Happens to me daily, goes insane on the refresh daily and holy cow today with the 6 day reset. Highly annoying.
---
Xbox one s.
---
When you start the game or open the map and it says rank 1/1, that will cause this to happen. In that case go and open the game board to force the game to realise there are 100 ranks and you are 25 or whatever on it. It stops this happening
---
She spent the majority of the day bitching on the internet lmao
---
I have Marsupial and Birdbones, but the SS chest + Jetpack is no small order. That's a lot of gold. I barely take fall damage as-is anyway, without cushioned legs.
---
Jumped down a sheer cliff yesterday and only took some 30 damage, and that's with a bloodied/unyielding build.
---
I just hope we get some unique items like the plasma caster was, something that can spice up the current meta but also be unique and interesting 
---
Tesla cannon sounds like it would be one of those items for sure
---
I thought the same thing when I got it. It makes my little packrat heart sing
---
But goooood silent story telling
---
Thank you so much for sharing! I thought you might say lever is unusable in ops, and was worried about that. Much more optimistic now. I'll have to build my last character for this for sure :)
---
LOL not literally. I've just been using that as my wording for when I find garbage lately
---
This.
---
I thought it would and I immediately opened the scoreboard but all it did was pause it, im rank 43 now, i can only imagine if it does it on rank 90 or something 😣😭
---
For a very long time I’d thought you were just supposed to wait for enemies to spawn and that was it
---
So for anyone checking this out, there was one last thing I hadn’t tried that allowed it to work normally. I got into a group on a public server. Not sure why public vs private would matter, but all the raiders were in the correct locations instead of all of them standing on top of Surge, and Fisher being stuck inside the room with Lev.
---
I'm having no problems with the new update. I've run in to a few enemy's that take some extra bullets .time. but truthfully I love all the stuff so far.
---
You got full unyielding and herd mentality too?
---
Cause that's some WACK carry space if it fits your build. 75 frickin lbs.
---
Haha yea by the time you spawn in it's over an done with :P I got almost everything I wanted from that event. Just need that tenderizer. C:
---
Yup definitely planning to run it just so. What are your thoughts on demo expert? I find it adds maybe 10 to 12% damage on the pipboy screen numbers at rank 5.
---
Seems small. Thoughts?
---
&gt; lmao why do you care how people play?
---
that's a thing on this sub.  so many expert nerds so concerned with how you play roflcopters
---
I mean Bethesda isn’t shying away from adding WW2 weapons so why not the BOYS AT rifle that thing would be unique to this game and was used by the US, plus it sounds evil when fired
---
ASSaultron
---
I kind of see that too. However, it’s short enough that it doesn’t feel too repetitive. I wish it wasn’t based around the BoS though. Screw those guys.
---
I hate levelling up now. Too hard to stay alive. 🤪
---
Maybe the map board has stopped working, try opening it before you load into a game next time see how that goes. Also... 43? Well you  gonna have nothin to do in about 3 weeks lol
---
Happy Cake day
---
I’d like repair kits to be added, I’m running out of mats to repair my gear
---
I did. Got called a hacker. And left. They don't want people that are better than they are. If you kill the leader in one match, you get put on the hackers section of their discord.
---
They have quickly become very efficient at popping up and killing you in groups quickly lol. It's embarrassing getting mauled by a group of lvl 100 mole rats
---
I want to make a charisma focused build just for this. With the addition of Legendary Stat Cards I’m more tempted to make another character to do just that
---
There is no reason for a molerat to be level 100
---
" **I'm tired of corpses ragdolling across the map and searching for 10 mins to get a 1\* Legendary Spoon.** "
---
Bethesda views that as 10 minutes of content.
---
standard bgs garbage
---
Not the one who posted, but I do the same. If you switch to your camera (not photo mode), and aim, you can walk around. When a creature is in view of the camera the name displays on screen. It’s not perfect but it can help you go in the right direction.
---
Always keep the hope up. I found a couple of bugs in another game, and it took months of me annoying the heck out of the devs in their forum for them to acknowledge each and then still a couple of months to fix it.  In these games, bug fixing takes a back seat to adding new stuff constantly to "keep players engaged". I'd be more engaged if this game didn't still crash at least once every couple of days.
---
I've seen them with stuff inside. They are similar to the one at the end of the run way at Morgantown Airport
---
I mean, it's just a pennant, but trying not to feel just a little salty. I took part in every PTS, and ran the Wastelanders MQ through around three to four times and discovered several bugs that got fixed doing so, and only trying to finish the Season stopped me from really taking part in this one. But sure, eighty minutes of running around is what gets rewarded, not other time invested in the PTS.
---
Ah well. No big. We test to make sure the game experience is as bug free as possible on live, not for reward. Grumble grumble grumble...
---
Happy cake day!
---
We’re way past beating a dead horse. The horse has completely decomposed by now and this is playing xylophone on its ribcage
---
I mean, it is the fastest lmg of ww2
---
Depends on the rest of your kit and build.
---
If your cqc is also explosive it makes sense but yes, the % increase is small.  Keep in mind instigating doubles damage though so if its 12% in the pip boy that's 24% on ther first hit which isn't too shabby. 
---
With legendary special it might make the investment in int easier to stomach and require less or even no sacrifice.
---
Ty mate appreciate it
---
Thank you
---
Most heaven weapons are tough to sustain in vats.  I find the Gatling Gun ok and the .50 for several quick shots, but high rate of fire heavies burn AP fast.
---
It's a random spawn from storing your collectron while it has a.44 in it. I got a tricentennial atom skin 10mm pistol other day when I moved my base storing my collectron. I was unaware of it till a friend told me about it after I noticed it in my stash.
---
Jeez you have some anger. Calm down a bit there little one.
---
95% of heavy gunners don't use VATS at all. The only time I use it is for fast small enemies like stingwings.
---
Yeah I feel the same and it’s annoying when you want to do a basic event or run to say Morganstown to loot for junk and you end up having to use more ammo than necessary for the area. I like the challenge for the most part, but some areas should definitely be capped.
---
Appreciate it, I had no idea! At least it's SOMETHING to work with, you know?
---
I'd put 1 point into Gun-Fu just for the fun of it - it's nice having the Vats auto-target from mob to mob.
---
I'd say opening shot is typically around 600-800 damage depending on the enemy.  Follow-ups are around 200ish or so.
---
Queen damage is...maybe 80 a pop with 250 on a crit headshot, which is every 2nd or 3rd shot.
---
Earle seems to be around 53 for a body shot and 83 for a head with crits doing around 150-180 I think.
---
That first shot hitting hard really matters for the general trash.
---
Thinking about it - that's with a FFR instead of Explosive though.  IE should be putting out more damage per shot.
---
They seem to be keen on keeping them to mostly ranged enemies, for some reason. But having a Ghouls Op would be pretty cool.
---
There are also stacks behind the desk at Bolton greens
---
That was before the update tho and with the patch 22 update mobs are going to be higher level. Higher level = more dps and so you can not expect the buildings to last as long against higher level mobs. The real problem is the turrets and allies do not seem to level up and there AI is atrocious (often see mobs attacking my camp while the turrets and allies sit and watch). Furthermore, after this last update, my bases (I build in same spot on all my toons and it is near foundation next to a mirelurk spawn point) seem to be getting attacked by ranged mobs more often (not sure why exactly since I have not moved but it seems to be the case). My base is setup in a way that the melee mobs that do not teleport are not a problem since I use a tower base and the turrets are set so that anything near my base can be hit by at least 2 missile turrets at all times (I use 6 missile turrets and 4 spotlight turrets). The best fix for this would be to make allys level up the way other mobs do, fix AI for ally/turrets so they will attack any mob that attacks your camp, remove range limitations from turrets so they can attack as if they were a mob with a gun. I have seen scorched with a pistol snipe my base from so far my turrets would not react and that should never happen when I use missile turrets. Would also be nice if we could mod turrets to have spotlights built in but take more power to run the turret after (that way we could lose the spotlight turrets altogether) but it is Bethesda so I would not hold my breath for a decent fix to any of these problems any time soon.
---
I'm loving vampire weapons now too. It does seem to have changed over the course of the games lifetime for sure
---
nice that sounds like a fun roll!
---
For me we have had too much meat week, I pop over when I notice but I am burnt out on it.  I wish I had Mischief night to look forward to instead.
---
I was downvoted when I said a group of molerats killed my lvl 169 character a few times since the update...
---
Not true at all, I’m lucky if I can get back all the ammo I use with my LMG because it’s specific to ammo type and not the weapon and your usage and because .308 is crafted in small amounts you also get a shit amount back
---
When I get ready to do a daily op, I prep everything I need first, then launch a fresh daily ops team, and jump right in. I can solo elder rank, 3 others can either join and cash in or not, only difference it makes is how quickly I get the uplinks connected. 
---
Point is, if you know you can solo an elder rank, start the team and dive in when you're ready. Others might join, they might not. If you need support, its probably best to start a fresh team and hop in the daily op and then wait 5 minutes or so. If no one shows, server hop. It might take a few tries, but you should find an instance where others join and help. 
---
A feature that allows team leaders to boot people while in daily ops would be super helpful as well. Or a vote out feature.
---
I would safely rule out pipe weapons.
---
Pornstar, Philanthropist, Playboy Power Armor wearer...
---
I’d just like it if I could get something other than the lights and signs
---
But what if you have one...... THAT'S BOTH?!
---
Lvl 69 mole rats eating your ass.
---
Vats with Gatling against shit like Radroaches/Stingwings is all I do it for.
---
And also slow the fuck down
---
Or at least as a reward if the daily ops take place in vault 94. I’m also trying to craft a halfway decent set (would just be happy with at least three of the pieces having the action point refresh speed) and sever hoping just to get enough steel is just agonising.
---
bongo bongo bongo*
---
hell, and here i thought i was alone with that.
---
Played them all night, people have been active on my server
---
Get bored of it? when it's the best ammo and legendary farm in the game!
---
I did that location today and failed it with two higher level players AND THEN, TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, THE LEGENDARY SHEEPSQUATCH CORPSE GLITCHED INTO THE GROUND BEFORE I COULD LOOT IT
---
dang,  can't say im not disappointed :(
---
Alas this doesn't always work as legendaries regularly loose their legendary name after death!
---
Legendary perks made that worse with all the extra explosions too!
---
dont care, dont like teams. not joining your team. am level 400, doing fine.
---
It isn't "unfinished" per say, from what i've seen it seems like another handmade skin.
---
Yeah man it’s a help for sure. You’ll never lose another in that damn swamp at the Strangler Heart again.
---
Usually indicative of the power brick going bad. If it eventually gets to the point you can't keep the Xbox on, head to Amazon and grab a replacement. Shouldn't run you more than $25.
---
There is the Service Rifle skin that is in the files, like the Screaming Eagle Skin, but without the added fan-faire, so it just looks like a standard Service Rifle you'd see in like the Anchorage DLC.
---
Fun fact ever since update 100K people stopped playing
---
See: Cazadors
---
But sadly from the datamines of the code, it appears to just be a skin.
---
could you pack any more gamer cliches into the one reply? fuck me, you even drop "snowflake" like its 2016.
---
Grow the fuck up and accept other people have different opinions, for god's sake. You sound like a major sweaty.
---
You can tell when a game is a console port because it's missing stuff like this.
---
Or text chat. 
---
Seriously, wtf?
---
agreed. i can smell his perspiration from here
---
Makes sense, thanks
---
I was so stubborn in playing 76 like the old Fallouts.
---
Only Lone Wanderer in Charisma, never grouped, never did events, ignored SCORE, any non-caps currency and dailies. 
---
Then I finally finished the quest except the first juke, and Meat Week hit and I finally tried a couple of Primal Cuts and Meat Cooks.
---
Seeing everyone doing a dance party around the barbecues and Steel drums finally convinced me that playing 76 as intended, a multiplayer game, was actually even more fun (not to mention, as you mentioned, for XP).
---
Now I'm finally nearly finished grinding for Raider rep and saving gold for the SS jetpack xD
---
It happens to me rarely when fast travelling to other camps. Like once every other day.
---
welcome to reddit. filled with insecure neckbeards and sweatys who get triggered if someone has a different opinion to them. Case in point the guy below.
---
Not every gun is vats efficient. Most heavy weapons are miserable in vats. Even the best options are only barely usable due to lack of mods to reduce vats cost.
---
Wow so my tse dragon is a fun novelty XD
---
Imagine if we got the cultists in on a Halloween celebration, trick them into believing that the Holy Mothman enjoys seeing his worshippers partake in the festivities. 100 caps says I get one of them to go apple-bobbing. (If I could) Double says i'd get the Raiders to egg Foundation and Foundation to make a haunted house.
---
The only good Molerat is a dead Molerat!
---
(And Snuffles, he’s ok.)
---
Yeah, it seems to be mainly while fast travelling to camps
---
Yessss! Wonder if it was only on Xbox! This is like this since one patch before Wastelanders if I'm not wrong!
---
Except that you could get the same reward you already have if you get any at all, some people have done it every day so far and not gotten a rare reward yet, while others got 5 copies of the same rare reward that they can only trash
---
fuck, just accept other people enjoy the game differently from you and move on. some people dont want or like "teams". Deal.
---
I could understand why.  With my endgame builds I didn't really see much difference.  So I started a new toon and now it feels like punishment to play instead of fun.  There is nowhere to get stronger cause every creature is your level and ready to roflstomp you in groups.  
---
They obviously didn't test this garbage.
---
Shame it's only a chance and not guaranteed otherwise I'd be farming them nonstop!
---
Ah that’s a great idea!
---
Best I can do is a skin for the handmade.
---
They did make mobs attack more often for me at least (I live near the settlers at foundation right next to mirelurks). I ignore the mirelurks and they can try to attack all they want but my missile turrets turn them into mush before they can really do anything. The real problem comes from ranged mobs that come from nowhere (seriously there are no super mutants near my base but I have seen them come to attack in force 5+ times since the patch). They seem to be able to snipe your base even with a pistol and your ally will watch this with amusement enjoying the view of your stuff being destroyed while they much on popcorn (even putting the thing that spawns them in closer to the side that takes the most fire does not seem to help as the mobs seem to ignore them). This is the kind of thing I would expect from the raider collectron who has expressed the desire to burn my camp several times but not the thing I expect from an ally especially 1 my toon is in a relationship with. The fix for this would be to make the ally attack any mob that attacks your camp regardless of range and increase the range your turrets have for each spotlight you use more but knowing Bethesda it is unlikely I will see any fix to this problem for at least 1 year.
---
Participation trophy for coming in first place?
---
And taste
---
And they will be BS untradable like so much they are adding.
---
I picked up 75 roughly clearing out Whitespring.  
---
The prize-bot can give you a ton, though that's hard to farm and not guaranteed.
---
The buttons are Z and C
---
I didn't do it until I got Final Word. I was around LVL50 I think, maybe a bit higher. A good heavy gun will set you for that fight.
---
lol you sound demented
---
Plenty of people DO survive alone, many out of necessity, others because they prefer it. People will have different viewpoints from you, **no one cares if you dont agree, no one cares if you think its "broken"**. Personally, i think people like you are the most broken of all.
---
also, love how you insert casual misogyny against a likely victim of severe sexual trauma because they dont want to be groped. Class act all around.
---
Mine says world found, loads in to a black screen and says “teams available” and freezes. All the time.  I’ve been trying to get on for 20 mins. What a piss off
---
Wished more players could turn the spits or play the drums.
---
Fucking liberators man! The soil/water/air data mission is actually annoying cause I used to run in and load them all up laser fire be damned. Now i have to actually kill them to finish the upload lol
---
Im not ignorant to the benifits of passive scrap collecting. I claim workshops as well. If you get the drop on me first ones free, but you gotta earn it if you wanna take it. If I lose scrap I didn't store thats on me.I can agree it sucks for low levels and there are plenty of people that take advantage of them in workshops. That is why i suggested farming the map.
---
If they remove the ability for someone to shoot you in the back it will water down that thrill and anticipation you speak of. In my opinion this game has been watered down too much already. I pre ordered expecting more than Fallout 4 with friends. 
---
Perhaps they should provide a buffer time to build your workshop up before you can be attacked. But for now I'm perfectly fine with it the way it is. It's easy to blueprint your structures and plop them down quickly.
---
Made even worse by the fact that corpses are instanced so you can’t even have someone find it and say “it’s right here” cause yours might be blown in the other direction
---
Been on multiple servers all day. I haven't seen it at all.
---
If you pick a bunch of safes, you’ll hit 100 pretty quick.
---
For the 30th time this week, open up your scorecard when you first pull up the game, fixes it
---
department's?
---
Does anybody?
---
level 100 molerats keep people from AFK’ing the Primal Cuts
---
I did the same, two sheeps at the end for me, I was like, cooome ooon
---
Me too. It's been happening to me since before the patch. I've never had a game crash so hard it shuts off my console 😳
---
Tbh the main reward is interacting with Grahm the actual prizes feel meh
---
I haven't seen any. At all. Maybe it's platform.
---
I'd find Prize bot a lot less annoying if he'd award legendary weapons and armor from time to time. In game lore be damned, I want my One Star Nocturnal Rolling Pin dammit.
---
The reward of ammo is better than the rewards of completing the op. This is just another failed implementation by Bethesda that will require nerfing so people can solo when people win all the rewards.
---
I hadn't thought of that. Just figured my console was slowly dying.
---
Use a level 3 Fireproof to keep from blowing yourself up with short range explosive shots. I also used to blow myself up  : /
---
Anyone buy the fridge? I wanna know how big it is since Beth didn't place anything near it for scale in the image
---
Which are very easy to trade for those rewards you do not have yet. For example i'm missing only one of the rewards because i traded my extra ones.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
I saw lots of people but the event was a shit show for sure. Could barley get two licks in because others were using way over powered guns. I feel that if there are at least 6-8+ people then y’all don’t need those Gatling guns. Just use a slightly beefed up rifle, even if it’s not your thing.
---
Not like ammo is an issue in this game..
---
After patch 22 everything takes more ammo so it is now!
---
I found the plan for 200 caps in a player vendor yesterday. I'd say that was pretty cheap for being a new rng item, but questionable on value. Bonus, Silent. Small footprint &amp; budget. Negative, 5 power so you might need a load.   
---
They do work no matter the time of the day, but my camp is in a foggy wooded area.. so for me they are kinda outta place.
---
I would like them to have enemy damage buff mutations just to give vets a reason to dust off their combat strats.
---
Atom fast forwarding through the score.
---
I thought you couldn’t trade them that makes it way better
---
After running the Ops a few more times I see why I thought it was a glitch, as I'm usually up in his face blasting him. He's got a minigun he switches to and i was getting lucky almost every fight until then lol.
---
I've got the whole shebang perks and armor wise, so I've never died to him even now that he's staring to use his main weapon me more lol
---
Worst mob in the game. Glitchy, irritating, and now stronger. I’d rather have cazadors.
---
Have you done BOS quests yet? If not... just dump it
---
Love you 3000
---
Oh definitely, this is just another option! Thanks for the suggestion!
---
Hoard plastic and load your own shells! Keeps my boomstick fed, anyways.
---
Great! Glad to see people offering loads of options!
---
I did them all but I don't have the forbidden knowledge quest option
---
Awesome! Thanks for adding to the great list! :D
---
I've been using mine in the daily ops and it's been helping
---
Just completed my second cookout. The people on either side of me on the drums would step off every 30 seconds, stand around for 20 seconds, then get back on. Over and over and over. Then they wonder why we can’t get the best objective
---
Just jump on the drums the moment the event starts and even before the event timer starts. It’s a huge help.
---
I stopped playing well before the update because as a level &lt;40 everything was already feeling way too difficult. Things at or just above my level were burning through all my ammo or durability - may be due to bad luck with what items I had at hand or something, but I was in a rut where I just couldn't seem to get anything better.
---
And to think everyone were trading the meat week plans for legacies lolololololololol
---
They do like to chew your ass up. Dont even take a guy/gal out to dinner first which is incredibly rude.
---
Yea, now that i think of it, propably should have said closer to 30 years ago. I started playing games \~42 years ago myself with Atari 2600 (only "console" i have ever had) and continued with Vic 20 shortly after :)
---
My pleasure! Glad I could help!
---
If you're OP, I can see doing it, but those players tend to be selfish and melt any legendaries in an instant. I used to play the Ash Heap Primal Cuts, but the only time I've seen someone else there, they ganked out quickly. Used to be 20 or 30 level Cave Crickets -- don't remember -- but now they're too much of a bother all at once, solo. No thanks. There's a serious problem with lower level creatures with this patch. They shouldn't be eating munitions like they do.
---
I wish we could kill NPC's. That way next time I hear "I have had my share of hard times" I can fill her full of lead.
---
Yea, we need level caps by region to allow casual killing
---
I keep a spare Ultralight SSA chest piece with jetpack for flying fun, I prefer asbestos or dense for my working CP.  Best of both worlds.
---
Honestly it’s nothing special really. If anything just get on a bit before the hour and go to the area, it’s near Vault 76, there’s like a 60sec timer before it starts so.. easy way to get lot of treasury notes, bout it.
---
Do meat week
---
Great name! It took me about three days of some hard and serious search time to find one. You'll find one tho!!
---
They've already said they are going to adjust it to help low level players. Hang in there.
---
Only Glaive plan is untradeable.
---
If you have a stack of them you have to drop them all and start a fresh. the bunker has them in the desks. I have heard of a glitch to keep handing them in. I have no idea how to do said glitch
---
Coming in first place knowing the rules of the game don’t guarantee anything and then expecting that you should be rewarded for showing up anyways?
---
That is true!
---
Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that but thank you for sharing it here so people are informed! :D
---
Do you have multiple characters? It will send them to the last character used unless you change it
---
Between all the events, seasons, challenges, reps, scrip, server hopping, resource grinding, mule swapping and endless base building, I literally haven't felt like I had time to ever just explore like I did in single player FO.
---
That’s awesome! Guess I missed that.
---
Okay thank you
---
There's a glitch where they get despawns, it can be fixed by storing what they're placed on.... But if they were placed on the ground you're plain out of luck and have to move.
---
If they were powered turrets the wire will just hover where the turret sued to be.
---
Use the ammo converter? Farm the munitions factory. If you are on PC i can give you some.
---
Yes, but you have ammo factory legendary perk so you are making way more ammo than you need (which you can use on your alt btw, so you don't waste coins on your main). For me, as a bloodied stealth commando, it takes me exactly one bullet more to kill normal enemies.
---
Nah he's got an auto missile launcher that sounds like a silenced combat rifle when he shoots it, and a minigun that until recently I've been fortunate enough to have him use on me most often. Lol
---
I'd almost argue that's the best gun in the game.
---
No worries. It was easy to miss; one of the community managers posted it as a comment on a random post. I'll try to find the post so you can read it
---
Sorry, I'm not sure what the time out is. I thought it was about 30 mins for me on PC?
---
I dunno.  I had a Pipe Bolt Rifle that did pretty decent damage, even into the 40s and early 50s for levelling.
---
But then, I'm a sneak-and-snipe kind of guy.  I had it silenced, and I was picking things off with headshots from a hundred yards away or more.  :)
---
i relaunched the game after a couple months. i saw there was a big update (the most recent one) and wasn’t a fan at all. most of the enemies are super difficult now. my character glitched once, and a player kept grieving me. not sure if i’ll be back tbh.
---
Like before not had any trouble with the other primal cuts apart from the unfair level scaling.
---
Something is really causing issues with just that location during both meat weeks.
---
That last sentence sounds like a line from a song.
---
This guy gets it
---
Where are you finding level 175 major gutsys?
---
People play there op, get elder then don’t play until reset it seems
---
Flatwooda and Whitesprings. Registers have them no guarentees. Also you can get a few using the US Supply drop. Not many. It may be a way to flog those tapes off
---
I've had wayward Beasties at some of the others but that particular location is my "eh....I'll wait" location sometimes.
---
My stealth commando was actually self sufficient in not even needing to craft ammo before patch 22, alas now everything takes so much more ammo it just makes the game more boring to play, as I'm wasting so many resources so frequently.
---
It doesn't help that sneak just outright isn't working anymore either.
---
They need to put Atom shop stuff in the PTS to test things. If you don’t want bugs then use the one thing that is designed specifically to test and lessen them.
---
Waiting on the quest line game is so dead for me 😔
---
Awesome! Thanks for the info!
---
Bring balance to the game!! Not leave it in level 100 mole rat-ness!
---
Sorry I am a noob - what is the camera? Do you mean the button you press to target in vats?
---
Yeah, it’s definitely more difficult if everyone isn’t on the same page 😅
---
Shite. You have to take your time. Read the item description. That has bitten me a couple of times. Not reading what is included.
---
Caping it at one reward per day makes sense, capping it at one elder run per day makes no sense.
---
The public teams always have a banner announcement when they are created inviting the whole server
---
I do too. I like the warden a little better though lol
---
[This should help!](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ixr0s6/psa_meat_week_tips_and_tricks/) When you turn in the Prime Meat you should get 5 scrip for each batch of 5 Prime Meat PLUS the meat sweats. Check your collections tab in your PiPBoy under Stats! ETA: You will see it be given just above the bottom of your screen, as an award - the same way you see it when you sell an item to the Legendary Vendor.
---
Nah that's their trick, they're actually demons.
---
Would be nice if they kept them in the loot pool just further reduced you’re chance of getting it for each successful completion. I really enjoy the ops but i’m encountering the same problem. Thankfully i am able to solo them for elder, i feel bad for anyone that can’t. More than happy to run with ps4 folks.
---
Lovecraftian terror newts. I love them from the safe distance of a fat man's firing range.
---
I've burned out two bricks so far. Annoying, but not especially costly.
---
It is... there is a lot of things that dont drop anymore that dont really  make sense  why... you should check my previous weeks!
---
Geez, I love fallout, but not purchase-a-second-console love...
---
Just did it with like 15 people on Xbox.
---
I usually join a daily ops team, and assume that there is a chance I will go solo, and when I load in, I use the follow me emote. If they show up, cool, if not, no big deal. Most often, they show up. Also, you can wait until you see that your other team members have gone “in ops”, which appears next to their name in the same font as “in conversation” and then start the op.
---
Somebody at Fallout, get this guy a job.
---
Happens to me, but it's only when I fast travel though, so far only on one of my characters.
---
"Mad dog malone has escaped. Again." Why does he never actually make an example of that sonofabitch lol
---
Ah I see thanks!
---
Wait 4 min for the bond to form, then go into the op.

If you want to see...Look for the reply by user Valseek
---
Mixed experience personally, seems like people like doing them with people they know so joining a public group is on a 'must do dailies' requirement.  
---
I honestly have a lot more fun playing with people I know, fucking bloody lvl.300 guys ruin it also by killing everything almost instantly and leaving everybody behind.
---
Two words:
---
**Starched** *and* **Genes**
---
Oh ok I may not have noticed then. Is the max 15 a day or 15 an event?
---
Sadly I am last in line to get to the Xbox tonight in my house :(
---
I see. West Coast here. Unless you are a night owl, I’ll probably hand it over tomorrow when we can both be online. :)
---
It’s over mole rats I have the high ground
---
Good luck! as a fellow pursuer of pets, I sympathize with you completely.
---
Actually they sell for one cap each soooo
---
No it's something you equip in the weapon menu. It was a tourist quest
---
That’s cause I’m shooting all the things with them!
---
No worries. There’s a quest where you find a camera to take photos, either for the Bureau of Tourism or for the bot with the overseer. With that camera, you can do what I’m talking about.
---
Edit: it’s called the Prosnap camera and you get it from “bucket list”, not bureau of tourism.
---
I have this issue but only on my toon that has Secret Service armor. Boyfriend is experiencing the same issue on his SS armor character.
---
Yeah, for sure. Easy fix compared to the alternative.
---
Damn it where does my comment keep going
---
You’re the best, thank you
---
Ok. Well I'm on every night around 7 to 8pm Pacific time.
---
So its technically possible for a gun to break in 1 shot if it hits enought people? But on d other hand, i dont seem to have this issue with my flaming bow
---
Just one, I’ve barely played so haven’t even thought of making multiple characters.
---
&gt; . I am level 490, and scrapped all my spare cards, and still didn't have enough to fully level up all six slots. 
---
This is exactly why I don't care about leveling up.
---
15 Per Event, if you gather enough from Primal Cut Events.
---
Do you know if you had any health buffs either from food, drinks, or drugs that might be wearing off? 
---
I'm assuming you're a bloodied/unyielding build, sorry if that's incorrect. 
---
I belive the Well Fed bonus gives you more health, which can kill some low health builds if it wears off. Same with Buffout related drugs and most limited health buffs.
---
Sorry if none of that helps.
---
Ok that's awesome! Thank you for the help appreciate it
---
Amazing Idea.
---
Yes it is.
---
Because he needs a nemesis lol. They've broken my turrets again, you might want to repair them.
---
[This should help!](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ixr0s6/psa_meat_week_tips_and_tricks/)
---
Ummm....can se wee the chair and work table together?!!?!?! &lt;3
---
I've had that happen when using a two shot mirv Fatman during enemy crouding events! One launch and SNAP!
---
People usually only do them once a day and be done with it. I always get elder tier solo and see no reason to run another.
---
My pleasure! Have fun!
---
D: *oh no*.
---
Ok! I'm usually on around 5pm, but could probably hop on around noon, eastern
---
If you stay in the area it spawns you in it won’t start the timer and you can wait for your team to join
---
I feel like there is not really any reward for the prime meat anymore, last year it gave you legendary script now you get the meat sweats. Also since the update I feel like I only want to do the ones to the left side of the map lol those yau gui killed me too quick
---
I love raider/settler fights. I usually pick one favorite from each group and kill the rest. Then sit back and enjoy the fight. Place bets if you're bored.
---
Oh I didn't think of that...I ground out most of the scorched ones but not all...let alone the robot ones now &gt;\_&gt;
---
Nah the nerf just hit so hard perk cards have become quite useless!
---
Jk... But seriously they really messed up pistol, rifle and melee builds.
---
My mule is mid thirties, has all the weight reduction perks, 1 rank in shotgunner is his only combat perk, and has 1 shotted damn near every single creature I have met in the Forest since lvl 2. No legendary effects other than a single armour piece with the blocking affix, although I did spawn a Quad Pump at lvl 35. 
---
Not much else to say about that. The game is still ridiculously easy.
---
Oh and without the magic armour effect its still like 2 shot kill, but I am not going to gimp myself any further than necessary.
---
I was literally just coming here to gripe about this. 
---
Did anyone ask Bethesda for LVL 100 Molerats?
---
Does anyone at Bethesda play this fucking game?
---
I've run it several times today with a group, and have seen lots of other runs started as well.
---
Well, they're going to keep me from wanting to participate in Primal Cuts now.
---
It always seems to drop me to near death, and it'll sometimes happen while I'm trying to eat, which doesn't make any sense. Unless well fed stays longer than my hunger bar stays full and then drops as soon as I eat again? 
---
But I'll pay more attention to see just how much is lost and when.
---
This is absolutely needed, also double the weight bonus on calibrated shocks!
---
It starts every hour on the hour. Hop on the drums or spin the meat at the cooking station. You can take a more active role by killing critters and looting critter chunks from them, collecting greens(turn in chunks and greens in critter cart or greens box), putting out fires, cleaning up critter bones and poo from Chally. Make sure to turn in your prime meet from the prime cuts events for scrip at the main grill. Have fun.
---
I had one of these today, and it was not fun, none of this is fun. Whoever came up with making this such a chore needs to get into a different line of work, because they clearly don't understand leisure.
---
I’m playing survival in fallout 4 and radscorpions are the most dangerous enemy in the game. I can trick a deathclaw by getting on top of obstacles until it runs off but radscorpions will wait until the next bomb to kill you.
---
Mole rats are the same too but I can clap them easily, even in survival mode.
---
What damage perks should be used I am getting clapped
---
And the timing of Gene Wilder.
---
No it wasnt patched yet. Beth are struggling with it trying to figure how to fix it.
---
The respawn glitch was some what fixed, mostly, but not fully. Only certain times it would not work, mostly. As for the fast travel bug, it mostly happens when wearing unyielding armor of any type, and occasionally when wearing other armor, sometimes. If you are confused, then you understand mostly the problem as we all fully don’t understand. Hopefully it will be fixed soon. We have only been waiting over a year now.
---
Won't the bond be fully leveled by the end of the op anyways? The bonus only applies to xp given at the end, right?
---
As annoying as that is, I've been gaining health randomly and have had to be sure to keep some rad rich food and drink handy. Every time I re-log or change servers I've been way over nerd rage.
---
So, yes, seems to be an issue.
---
But the +50 carry weight
---
They will hit you as they pop up.. through the tent roof.
---
Just like sand at the beach
---
I hate mole rat at any lvl, Always hidden underground and wait for the good time to bite your ass
---
Naw, it isnt very rare. Those rewards drop with a decent frequency.
---
Right, grahm only talks about it before the event and even then most people aren't listening and it is pretty vague
---
Anybody else mad there's no opponent game piece to measure your progress against?
---
My bloodied pals and my full health agree that robots are the worst mobs in the game.
---
From their point of view you are evil!
---
As a Fallout 76 veteran, I’m sure they left the “D” off at the end on purpose
---
Sounds like we're in the same boat. Don't take my criticism negatively. I believe the same crowd that bashed the game before release will continue to do so until 76 is a shadow of what it once was and open world PVP is no more. Part of me wonders if a lot of players get salty when a NPC kills them. I'd just stop playing if i couldn't die in a game without getting angry. Sadly most are gonna complain no matter what BGS does. Me I love this buggy mess of a game.
---
Perhaps they should implement a few "safe" workshops.😁
---
Go to Habitat-A, no LVL 100 Molerats, but you get plenty of LVL 100 Ants!
---
Also, since Meat Week is up, be mindful about taro salad. Eating more than one can kill you.
---
Yeah it's worth any decent legendary you want. Maybe around 20-30k 556
---
I agree, at this point I'm just heading over to the cookout to pull whatever weight i can for the plans.
---
I love it. I get around 700 XP just for a fog crawler. Tons for Yao guis as well. And it’s easy treasury notes
---
I'd love to have a version without the half bubble too, as an alternative craft!
---
And to use its jetpack with my secret service jetpack.
---
1 word.
---
Shotguns.
---
It’s the flat woods monster
---
Always the first picture up in my camp.  Give me a stuffed animal Mr Pebbles to display at my camp.
---
Omg right!! That should have been the Halloween event. Mothman festival where you have to fight the mothman
---
Do you actually think that you're intimidating? My comments are directed at the little sniveling twerps that are trying to dictate how a community should play a game. They are intolerant of other people's opinions and have spent an extraordinary amount of time countering anyone who suggested that playing solo is just fine.
---
I am definitely too old to be a snowflake, and as far as "bitch", well sweetie, it's a title I wear proudly and I have worn this title for a mighty long time. And in the future you may refer to me as Mrs bitch.
---
It's two separate things though? If so then I wonder why they dont just combine the flatwoods monster and alien into one
---
I get that but I wish they could add more stuff that actually makes it feel post apocalyptic
---
The R91 is easily my most anticipated weapon skin for them to add.  I recall seeing a small video of a dataminer showcasing it and it looked pretty much complete.
---
Hope they release the “default” versions of the Chinese Assault Rifle and AR-10 too.  I am not really a fan of the camouflage skins or really those with paints per se.
---
I don't know about your repair kits, but if you have mystery atoms you might want to make sure Fallout 1st isn't active if you had a subscription before you took a break.
---
I sell legendaries to random train stations when I can't scrip them, 1*2*3*... Doesn't matter to me anymore and I'll gladly let them become someone else's burden and or treasure. Anyone on PS4 should check them, I get rid of pretty decent rolls usually.
---
Absolutely:) I should be having it delivered within the next day or two via Amazon. I will take a bunch of photos of it for your team :) Just funny how experimenting with the paint managed to make a great complimentary piece of furniture to go with it.
---
It didn't used to be.
---
The cook-off starts every hour on the hour. Last time it ran it would sometimes finish very fast, so be there a minute before the event starts to be sure. You can teleport to the moonshiners shack just below vault 76, then hoof it slightly west.
---
Make sure the cookout succeeds! Its fairly easy.  Be there each time for basically free rewards.
---
Turn the spits/play instruments is easiest. But! If you dont do the other things progress can go backwards.
---
Some people need to put out random fires that spawn (walk up &amp; interact) near the main cooking area and the other spits.
---
There are also trash/bones piles to interact with and clean up, hard to see.
---
Gather greens, they are palm frondy looking plants, and put them in the cooler.  There are example plants behind the cooler.
---
Lots of little creatures spawn for side meat, i forget what its called, gather the item and put in the shopping cart next to the greens cooler.
---
The little creatures, rabbits, opossum, squirrels, etc you may want to photograph and or hunt for various scout badges. I just completed my rabbits hunt today for Gardener badge thanks to meat week.
---
Usually theres a couple legendary creatures on the prime hunt, so thats a bonus. And "huge" creatures for the weekly challenge.  Take pictures of unusual creatures if you need them for badges/world challenges.
---
You can turn in up to 15 prime meat into the big pot over the fire in groups of 5 only for 1 scrip per meat. Not the normal crafting cooking pot. But the prime meats get awarded in groups of 4 at the prime hunt events. So youll need to run several to maximize. 
---
Turning in prime meat, doesnt affect your rewards though. Just scrip + meat sweats. 
---
So make sure you are there by :59 minutes after the hour, every hour even if you dont have meat. Just dont sit there not contributing.
---
After / before the event you can also trade with graham without having to track him down on his route.
---
(I think you can feed chally too, but i dont know how to do that).
---
You nailed it! 😂
---
“We live in a society”. Now where did I hear that one before?
---
Damn.
---
Seriously? That'd be hilarious!
---
Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.
---
As long as you can keep trying for the day until you get your rare reward, then I wouldn’t mind.
---
But yeah, currently running it once, getting Elder and getting nothing with no reason to repeat for the day isn’t particularly exciting.
---
Take technical data to place, turn in technical data to said place... not that hard
---
Up for me. Try cleaning your Xbox cache by holding the power button down until it shuts off.
---
Really stoked you would even take an interest 🙏😅
---
What's the obsession with leveling up?
---
Yeah this is a pretty well know issue at this point. I’m sure it will be addressed soon
---
Oh, what?? That definitely explains at least one of the deaths. I was trying to drop weight and was eating it all up. Wtf?
---
Yeah, the balance is gone. Getting legendary scrip doesn't matter if you can spam Daily Ops.
---
Mischief Night. 
---
But yeah, that's a good point.
---
I've noticed this too. Especially with all the legendaries weighing me down, I'll notice I'm suddenly encumbered and need to shoot myself with a gamma gun once.
---
As someone who runs a couple different characters on shotguns, shotguns don't work well in a number of situations. Its broken out of vats and in vats. 
---
There are 2 basic rules I live by, and if I break them I die.
---
Rule 1. Always make sure you have 1 piece of 3 star armour with reduced dmg while blocking, and always make sure its repaired before you fight.
---
Rule 2. Never ever take a vats shot unless its 90% or better. Otherwise just unscope and try to proc enforcer, and/or wait for a better shot.
---
Other than that, prioritize AP regen and GRS. Gun fu is helpful as well. Consider sneak/silenced shotguns as well, the range is basically point blank but this is quite powerful  especially with high sneak.
---
yeah we type with the controllers
---
A- the daily. B- unlocking all the legendary perk slots and upgrading them. For those of us who work full time and don’t have much time to hop on every day it’s a big plus to get treasury notes and lots of XP.
---
Nah, I value game balance more.
---
I'm personally hoping for the Incinerator heavy weapon, who doesn't love a fire lobbing machine of death?   
---
Plus, they already got burning projectile models &amp; effects with the Floater enemy type
---
Clean the trash piles...
---
Stop the fires...
---
Pick up the poop...
---
Farm The Greens...
---
Farm the Critter Guts...
---
Not that hard, do all that and you could even solo it
---
It lets you craft a basically useless consumable and every day the plan becomes less and less rare as people complete more daily ops. I don't think it's worth as much as other people here are saying at this point but still more than most other stuff. I got one and sold it so I could spend the caps on something more interesting. I know I'll get a second copy eventually.
---
I’m not arguing against game balance. They have so much to balance out, and should’ve done a different event than meat week. But since we have it I’m going to take advantage of it and I’m still happy we got SOMETHING. Chill bro 🤣
---
More Sledge skins? Got it.
---
I get on a spit, enter photo mode, put a rubber band on my joystick than go to bed. Wake up at 5am, make coffee , check the game (usually disconnected at some point), join a new world than head to work. Come home, shower, eat, play with the kiddo. Check my game at 730-8pm, do my dailys,scrip hang with friends and repeat. Maximum efficiency for the working dad.
---
Ran into a level 15 Raider set yesterday. I'm 350.
---
Wat
---
Maybe they can ask Ubisoft nicely. Farcry have this mechanic already implemented. Loot will just show up on the compass when you've killed an enemy.
---
I’d honestly rather have unlimited scrip cap but only able to make 10 rolls a day from the purveyor. At least I wouldn’t be compelled to carry around junk gear until the scrip renews.
---
My two buddies and I ran the Op tonight, and set it for public daily op in case someone else wanted to jump in.
---
My buddy, the leader logged out afterward and the leadership passed to me.  I forgot we were still an Op team until two new players joined about 15 minutes later.
---
I just blitzed through the op again with them, so as not to be a jerkoff.  Simple as that.  I switched to casual after we finished.  I can take 6-7 minutes out of my day when it’s my own carelessness that could cause a problem.
---
It is that hard when it won't let you turn it in
---
Sometimes it doesn't work which is why people have been complaining about people who stay in the group and not participate. If no one shows up I usually leave and try again.
---
Legendary Spoon?... Ive been eating my Cheerios all wrong
---
Become meat week.
---
*BECOME...MEAT*
---
Same
---
I had this fun thing where I would beat up the first scorched, steal their weapon, then continue picking up and using weapons only once. That's long gone now....
---
Yes and patch 22 made it much worse.
---
You underestimate my power!
---
I'd still prefer it over meat sweats lol
---
lol sounds great
---
That reminds me of I used to dump all my stuff off in fallout 3 and fallout 4 and decide to go do a quest on the opposite side of the map using only what I picked up along the way 
---
Can't really do that in 76 because I can't fit anything else in my stash
---
Yup, exactly
---
This isn't really where you "file complaints". Literally nobody will care here
---
it nerfed everything
---
Rewatch the whatever glitch video you saw on youtube... maybe you missed something. Heres a hint... you cant complete a quest you dont have.
---
Mind of I ask what's this 100 pre-war money about? I'm pretty sure I have completed all my daily and not at home at this moment🤔
---
Did you verify files for the game? Try to exit Steam by right clicking the steam icon. Then open the files for the game and try to launch the game from the application file in there
---
Is there a reason that I’m not seeing?
---
Damaged calculation was modified across the board for all builds. It is now additive instead of multiplicative. They sorta forgot to change the language on the cards. So you could say yeah damage was nerfed.... for every weapon.
---
No One Cares. Go whine somewhere else
---
Legendary modules
---
It's a feature? All my toons are low health, but if I eat two tato salad in a row it kills me. Please, enjoy LOL
---
"Content" 😉
---
idk how to do awards but you got the me award on this one, and ive been lax on playing since one wasteland, but i know, theyre slaughterable
---
If you aren’t wanting to use it until being able to roll for max level weapons and armor, you could buy some legendary modules to have for whenever you want to try your luck at crafting some of the gold bullion items
---
[slams hands on table] GIVE THEM A GOLD PRESS MACHINE AND HAVE THEM BOOST THE DAILY BY 100
---
That's my point idiot, no matter what the quest does not show up. So I would suggest you get a brain and stop being a complete dunce
---
I didn't do the exit steam part but I have verified the files. This has been through multiple instances of steam though. Does it stay running in the background if you don't?
---
Legendary modules until you hit level 50. After that you can decide. 
---
Personally if you can finish the Vault Raid and unlock Secret Service Armor, I’d just start rolling those for armor. 
---
For weapons, two-stars are fine until you get one that really suits you. Then you can start going for 3-stars. But again, consider the option of the Gold Bullion weapons. I love my Gauss Shotguns.
---
When u slap the Loot wall sticker over his name he becomes Mr Ploots and I think that's important
---
Wow, thanks, this sounds great
---
If that means less posts about people complaining they didn't have time to tag the megasloth, Im 120% for it.
---
This isn’t the place for that. Go file your complaint elsewhere.
---
You’ve been dredging up this drama for about six months now. Why are you still subjecting yourself to it?  At some point, it becomes ***your fault***.
---
I feel powerful when I go afk solo in daily ops with freezing robots to pay the pizzaman and I come back and I am not dead yet.
---
I don't go back to Flatwoods to flex my dick. 
---
But if I did, perhaps sniping Mr. Farmhands with an Explosive Compound bow with 95% acc at 320 range and no archer perk cards does the trick. Or laying waste to a horde of 15 scorched with a quad ffr tesla rifle. Maybe sneaking up to the face of a Blood Eagle spotter, while you just 1 tapped his entire squadron  and he is still playing the banjo?
---
Oh cool. Can't wait for my level 200 be saved by a level 20.
---
I use vats to spot enemies and then generally kill them outside of vats with the heavy gun, this is because using vats drains fusion cores like crazy. It's worth it though for some enemies like bloodbugs and molerats.
---
If anything, I feel microsoft would put better resources in making the Fallout franchise strong.
---
Whistle in the dark?
---
Probably?  I'd assume it'd just warp you out of the zone like if you fast traveled out of it.
---
A much more quality post would be you taking the 2 minutes to try it and reporting back
---
You sure you earned them?
---
Go make that quality post then
---
I like how when they spawn they glow super bright but then after 5 seconds it's like haha nah, take the camera out, binch
---
Trading posts, including price checks, are not allowed on /r/fo76. There are other trading/price checking subreddits and websites available - please make use of those. 
---
If your post is not about making a trade, please [message the subreddit moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
Repair junk weapons &amp; armor that you loot from enemies before scrapping it. usually comes partially broken.
---
Aren’t those ones you can enable/disable in the Atomic Shop?
---
Hahahaha
---
This is your high thought not mine xd
---
What we know for sure is that zenimax and the subs all have full creative control for now. Typically this kind of take over is a year to year and a half long event. Exceptions would be if say Bethesda dropped a game and it was so shitty and was a loss out the door, then I could see MS stepping in.    
---
Also ESO and FO76 are probably very net positive, especially once they move the games from AWS over to Azure, which in turn could expand development of both games. Also the popularity it may maintain as a gamepass game.   
---
Basically we don't know but the outlook does look as a positive overall for FO76 and ESO.
---
Yes, but I use them both. Which is why I’m requesting that they switch the tab on them.
---
Yes you have missed quite a bit apparently
---
Actually, leaving the team strips others from one stack of xp buff (which is kinda the point of daily ops teams?), so I dunno about points 2. and 3. Which one would be more polite considering both our points? To stay or to leave then?
---
&gt; Great place to build a CAMP to avoid high level enemies, and enjoy the scenery.
---
There are places in high level zones where you can do that.
---
Very nice, man. I appreciate the accountability you held yourself to and I’m sure the other two players that joined did too :)
---
What bull shit right? I just got my bench and can’t even use it. Why disable it while they fix the bug instead of letting mellow enjoy the glitch for a while?!?
---
Zenimax was pretty lenient with Beth. They were about to let them wait 10+ years before making another TES, and they let them have a super short marketing cycle for their games compared to most other devs who reveal their stuff 2 years or so in advance
---
Where, exactly, should they go?  There’s only eight spaces and each one has its own theme.
---
The original was a lot of fun, like 2019 meat week. It started appropriately, everyone is together. It's a cool experience when it's done right. Timing is just off this go.
---
Okay, thanks for the info!
---
We just hope you love the chair as much as our team loved making it - Don't hesitate to reach out if you've got any questions or that
---
The worship one could go under the taunt tab or the heart emote tab.
---
Oh right that's true. I'm up to 7 again after turning in 20 the other day (no fancies, but a few western outfits) and was considering rolling them more but dreading the time sink but now I have more reason huh
---
*Comment Deleted
---
True hero.
---
Holy hell it took me 30 hits with a ski sword tonight to kill two diseased rabbits. Like wtf. Id just leveled up 3 times following a bunch of 200’s around doing events. Now all my gear is useless again.
---
*laughs in hack and slash rank 4*
---
There's a popular theory that FO76 is all a simulation and building on that I'm convinced Julie and Appalachia Radio do not exist "physically" until we actually see them.
---
It's inherently Magic, so actually...
---
Probably suffering from FO4 issues, swap the game to an SSD and it should fix a lot of the problems. No one knows why it works like that since really it should just be load times but yeah go look it up it is a thing.
---
No because you could name it with an appealing name like bloodied+explosive and someone might impulse buy it. Or just have straight up swearing etc.
---
Then keep your high thoughts off it unless you intend be useful
---
Ho hahaha
---
No but I get the grindy err sound and a crash. That happened 3 times today.
---
Trying to get the blade of Bastet has been tough with my higher level, non melee character. Sure I got a few kills with roaches, scorched, and ants, but half the stuff I try to kill literally won’t even be scratched by the level 1 garbage blade. 
---
I had no problem with one wasteland until I realized how dumb this quest would be now at high levels. Should have done it earlier on this character I guess
---
What are western outfits going for these days? All the posts I could find were old so I just shoved the regulars in for 100, chaps for 5k, and hoped I priced right 🤷
---
It didn't even kill any of them!
---
Sadly, I'm already used to that with the other Fallout games as well
---
Well, reading the comments, it doesn't seem like you have unlocked the quest yet.  If you are SURE you've completed the quest "Defiance Has Fallen", then all you should have to do to access the quest is pick up a new Technical Data.  If you had tech data in your inventory beforehand, just trash it, it is useless to you.  Go find new tech data.  When you pick it up, it will activate the quest to go turn it in.    
---
From my understanding, to do the "glitch" you have to have a friend who has NOT completed the BoS questline yet, and they have to collect multiple Tech Data for you.  They will then go and place them somewhere near the Tech Data turn-in point (inside a container in the same room), and then you can turn one in, take a new one, turn that one in, and repeat.
---
I am sure I clicked all of them and had the rewards pop up and everything, yeah.
---
Nobody explain it.... 😂
---
There's two sets with controller, triggers do bigger changes. What's the other set on kb?
---
It took 12 rounds from my shit cannon combat shotgun tonight to take out an Eye Robot. Point blank.
---
I like getting the grenades, makes some of the maps funner as my buddies and I lob them into choke points, causing enemies to be sent flying.
---
You sure you lost them?
---
Is there a new list for second helping? Or is it the same?
---
Or they could give us cap sinks that actually give us something in return.
---
I have been getting that to
---
Nope they scrapped that idea.
---
Raider Cultist Prophet, BoS Rogue Agent, BoS deserter, Raider Mountain pirate.
---
I truly don't know where these responses from responses from responses come from.  Everyone is accusing everyone of not posting responses right.  Then throwing a backhand snarky thing about Bethesda.
---
;)
---
No, they changed that.  They wanted to promote the use of cool animated cards and not just have people scrap them.
---
It's technically against tos but I think that's to just cover their asses if you fuck up
---
Horseshit.
---
I have to down vote this one. We're getting too many fast travel locations imo. At the rate requests are going, fast travel period will be free next year. And here I thought one of the biggest complaints were people having too many caps?
---
Thanks, that was my problem! I powered it up but still after 6 hours of play still no sales. Dropping my prices and also ready to move my camp since I’m done at the ash heap for now
---
Koth? What is that?
---
Huh? Who are you? Can you explain how i am stalking her? I dont know her address or phone number, i dont even live in her country, how the fuck i am stalking her? You damn pathetic simp. Stop simping Vic you cuck.
---
This one gets it.
---
Just south of Lewisburg train station. Massive amount of waist deep water and a train station nearby.
---
Don't build right next to the station though or else super mutants attack the base when they spawn in Lewisburg.
---
This is purely empirical but I've noticed that on Tuesdays there seems to be less events spawning than on other days.
---
Why would Bethesda change now, they are bigger and richer than ever. As long as people get shoving their hands into their wallets Bethesda will keep shoveling shit into our mouths.
---
Where did you get that figure?
---
Try selling it in your vendor for a couple K and see how it sells.
---
&gt;They wanted to promote the use of cool animated cards and not just have people scrap them.
---
I seem to recall something about a bunch of people crying about their animated card collections...
---
that no one can ever see...
---
Yea but they would make more money if there where more options to choose from right? If you selling 20 things only so many people would be interested in those 20 since that is all is available to purchase, but if you offer 200 things well you just open the flood gate for much more potential sales.
---
I had a bug on PS4 where it just randomly disconnected my internet on my whole system .. had to restart my Ps4 just to get connection
---
Agree much prefer a buying limit than a selling limit.
---
Of course
---
I sold 75 at 50caps each
---
I guess that is up to each one of us and our preferences. But xp buffs can be easily maxed out on other public teams like events team or casual team (grants intelligence, but that ends up granting more xp overall).
---
So I personally see daily ops team as a team that runs the event, and the other public teams such as events and casual are there to be used for xp buffs.
---
But this is just my opinion and suggestions. We all play this game the way we want to. That is part of what playing games are mainly for.
---
I don't know how the 94 armors compare to ss but it feels wrong that I can make 5 rolls a day but 94 users cant
---
Meat week definitely should be every month, once a year or whatever is a waste
---
well, shit. Thank you.
---
I'm camped in the mire and used to see them 3 or 4 times a week. But now that you mention it, I haven't seen one in a while.
---
Well, thank you kind sir, for the silver.  THAT is a response to a response to a response to a response that I can get behind.
---
Me too
---
I want my lightsaber
---
Pretty sure they are inside it. I had similar issues when trying to put things on certain parts of the Red Rocket Garage, the textures extend past the snappable edges.
---
That sucks when I get 4 animated of the same uselsss one
---
That doesn’t solve the issue. It’s bullshit that people in a huge mechanized suit of armor have to use perks just to carry as much as someone wearing a backpack
---
Exactly.
---
&lt;with sadness&gt; Don’t try it.
---
You really showed them!
---
Last year it was extra because we met the goals of project clean Appalachia
---
Heavy guns require a lot of aiming. Vats is of no use with a mini or a faster fire rate .50, especially an lmg. Stabilized is a good card, along with formula P to tighten the group. Really fun gun, but eats .308 really fast..
---
What time slots you playing at? I see a lot of low-team servers but rarely do I get only one with no one joining mine
---
Attempt server jumping. It's actually a secret benefit to adding friends I've found, since you can jump around until you find a good, well populated server
---
I don't like level 1 mole rats.  They are one of the most obnoxious, least rewarding monsters Ive ever come across.    
---
Reminds me of cliffracers in Morrowind.
---
I can’t even begin to describe how much I dislike molerats. If I get mugged they always give me a disease and just when I think I got them all I take 5 more steps and get attacked by 1 or 2 more. Irritating...
---
Completely understandable. Glad your back up and running
---
That's how gold works
---
*no*
---
Hold on to it. Maybe next season they'll make it trade-able for people that haven't gotten it this season.
---
I got one lvl 200 something around that and he keep being in these tunnel not around the uplink, i emote with the follow me one, he came and bash me with his gun, i kicked him of the group.
---
I don't have time to play with childish people like that, he want to farm ammo ? Then do it in solo and don't join an public dailyOps team.
---
Stop playing or stop complaining.
---
Unless you are a hoarder, 4k stash over 5 characters is MORE than enough. Are they trying to build their own FO universe?
---
I ran a few today with my high level characters. Took a break and brought in my brand new toon (a level 15 melee). Turns out enemies at primal cuts can spawn at whatever level the game feels like. So I’m there with my level 15 meat hook goin ham on a level 60 yao guai while a level 100 ish is running away (tactfully retreating maybe) because he got swat at. Primal cuts, even the forest one, isn’t easy for a low level melee. Granted I been playin since day one and know there’s no consequence for dying so I’ll throw my new toon into the grinder. All that being said, primal cuts is just..... ugh. Too much. Maybe every half hour. Every 15 minutes....
---
Sad trombone noise.
---
I wish it was that simple in my case. :( Running on an SSD currently despite all of the above. What's with the almost 100% GPU usage? Any other tips or tricks you may have heard of that I could try out?
---
You sure you're not mixing up the "kill" challenge and the "take a picture" challenge?
---
just got it myself. yesterday i got the glaive and day before that the reactor. for usch a big thing it sucks it does the same amount of power as the usual fusion reactor
---
Worship under heart, dance under taunt
---
I too have wondered this
---
I have nothing useful to add I'm just gonna watch this post and see if anyone has the answer 👀
---
Should give ammo for what you are using like ops.
---
Idk I wish I could tell her to switch it up some dang, just go raid the local record store and get some new material.
---
Sorry no.
---
I stopped sleeping since the last time I woke up. It's such a waste of time. So over it.
---
There is also extra development resources that could help Bethesda in developing ES6 and Starfield as well as some aid in making content for FO76 and ESO. But that’s just my opinion
---
https://i.imgur.com/jwIIJHH.png
---
Yes.  They have a decent amount of interior space.
---
Np
---
That looks sick reminds me off ricks gun on the walking dead
---
We could celebrate by drinking nukashine and eating cat meat!  Yum!
---
You f#cking monster.
---
I can imagine. I played every day for one-two hours. I’ve given up on it now because I hate figuring out builds. I just wanted to build and collect in the forest. :(
---
Skins for things that haven't got any would also be nice.
---
Outstanding!  That's all i needed to know, thank you very much.
---
Haha yea, traded a guy for this said it was super rare like less than 100 people have it.
---
Also on xbox and yes!
---
If only we could, you know, decide where things go ourselves
---
It depends on what you carry.  Obviously I wish I had more carry weight for the sake of carry weight, but I find myself not needing it too much.
---
Yeah, it does.
---
Saying a participation trophy is saying to be rewarded for doing nothing, just saying it’s not a sound comparison to working and coming in first place. If you think it should stay not guaranteed fine that’s different
---
Sure that's sad, but it's still cool to have them for yourself.
---
Legendary weapons shouldn't drop at loot at all- they should just go directly into your inventory.  
---
And we should have the ability to disable the screen blocking pop-up that appears when you get a legendary.
---
Lunchboxes for gold was a game changer for me.  I opened one at every meat cook tonight and had 100% xp boost for the whole time I was on, since many others opened them too.  Went from 498 to 510 on one of my characters and gained 13 spaces on the board tonight.
---
Fancy maths
---
Surgical mask isn't rare,  you can buy it at (raider?) vendors.
---
Yeah I just loaded it up to make sure, and in combat under the "kill different types of cryptids" it lists kill an alien and then under it is to kill the flatwoods monster
---
Yeah it did it to me for a while and if I didn’t open up the scoreboard before I went into the game and then got some score it would level up all my levels but still only to where it was before I got the score, not adding it into the total. It hasn’t done it since for me but yeah if it does just remember to open the scoreboard and it’ll reset it.
---
I have this issue as well but mainly on the Foundation and Watoga area the rest I’m averaging over 80-100 fps
---
I’m on Xbox and it turned the Xbox off and before that I was kicked to the home screen
---
Depends what you consider viable.
---
Why would you want to hurt yourself like that
---
Do you want molerats? This is how we get molerats.
---
Also if there is an unfilled casual group... Don't start a new one and sit there in it alone, join the existing one.  You get nothing from being group leader.  I see this happen pretty regularly.
---
I mean I can write anything on my walls but misleading titles makes sense as a reason not to have it
---
I think the NPC's have their original level system in place, and it's just different for how each player perceived them.
---
Feel like it’s a platform thing, maybe if you refresh servers a few times you’ll snag one with more interested parties?
---
Actually if you share they see it
---
Limit to how many legendaries you can buy with scrip. No limit to how many legendaries you can sell for scrip. Still keeps a limit on the process, which Beth will never give up, but solves the issue of having too many legendaries bogging down your inventory.
---
I just cleared out my misc inventory!
---
WTF am I doing wrong? I'm lvl 50 I can't keep enough ammo on me,  ever since the most recent patch I'm just burning through ammo and stimpaks at break neck speed all the time?!? My armor also is just breaking before I can complete more than a single quest line... I'm currently running around with no stimpaks just dying trying to get through Duty Calls.... I have lvl 3 scrounger and lvl 3 Pharma Farma Halp!

"basically useless" I take it you hate Master Infiltrator too with that attitude against qol stuff :9
---
I couldn't fully remember if we did anything extra last year, my apologies. I just remembered it was twice.
---
Deleted the post xd Lemme know if it works 🤧
---
Still hoping for a classic Fallout3/NV gatling laser skin seeing as though there’s an icon for it in the atomic shop
---
Id rather be getting 5 perk coins really..
---
Are the enemies leveled to the other enemies?  Are the enemies leveled to the levels you see them at for each other, but the level another player sees them at for each other for that player?  Who knows.
---
Free up some budget space maybe?
---
He shot you.  Not your fault.
---
Every single time I’ve done it I’ve got the lights or nothing
---
I mean yeah but phrasing it as "I prefer a buying limit to a selling limit" without specification feels like tempting the monkey paw
---
They fixed the "overencumbered" respawn bug, but AFAIK they've never fixed the Healing Factor mutation fast travel bug.  It is the one where you click to fast travel and nothing happens until you fart around, hold your mouth just right and click it about 5 times.
---
Sounds like you have Traveling Pharmacy equipped. I swapped that out, and use the chemist pack. Freed up 3 points to use, lots of options under strength that make a difference.
---
thats great for all those people sharing expert locksmith..
---
I do use starched genes but when you take rad x, mutations become suppressed.
---
Yes. All of this.
---
Well yes, but actually no.
---
Good, effective, etc.
---
I sincerely recommend going bloodied instead of junkies, you'll do a lot more damage.
---
Also I'd  recommend not using portable power, power user (unless you have a gatling laser), lone wanderer, or bullet shield.
---
Don't forget the plainly visible Uzi in Guerrilla perk which has no equivalent at all in the entire game.
---
But that's the thing you aren't in a group, and I feel like people don't realize this.  I have no mic, and outside of ops where there is simply a common goal that requires really no comunication, I never, ever interact with my team members.    It's 100% bonuses and no downside.    
---
I say all this as a strictly solo player.  Join a group.
---
Yeah it's any raider vendor.
---
Oh sweet, was coming here to find out where the best place to look is! Definitely gonna do that tomorrow
---
I wouldn’t mind carrying low level on daily ops if they just want the daily rewards, but in all honesty if I want to do consecutive runs of daily ops I would prefer high level player to speed up the runs.
---
I tried that before but I invest my perks into other stuff. I’m stubborn like that. Haha
---
As an alternate to your experience, im a mid 200 level player. Many times when i join a daily ops team, low level or high level,  i get kicked from it. I feel like many ops teams are friends.
---
Let me guess the high levels weren't even good at it were they
---
Bet they run off the point constantly
---
Then someone uses an explosive whatever and the body yeets into the future.
---
First daily ops I joined and was in a team with two 800 players I am 336. I figured easy, nope get done in 12 minutes being they just wanted to loot and I had to melee the robots even tho I’m a bloodied build. Join another team, one was 28 and other was 40. We got elder first try. That team was awesome and I played with them all night. I don’t judge anyone because who knows what those ppl can do. Just like tonight first cook off, everyone was using the glitch to kill ppl if they weren’t in pacifist. Everyone of them where 400+ and only the low levels did the event with me.
---
Being on a public team auto passed the mission "I am Become Death" where you learn how to launch a nuke for the first time. I was just working on my camp when suddenly mission passed. I still don't know how to launch a nuke. I got fucked.
---
Sorry should have phrased better. Already ran bloodied commando and just want to switch it up. Don't like the glass cannon feeling so I'd like to try junkies for a bit less damage but more security on surviving
---
Yeah same
---
Why does everyone think New Vegas 2 is so likely? Microsoft owning Bethesda and Obsidian is such a far stretch. Are we trying to wish it into existence?
---
Just buy 1 or 2 legendary modules, don't spend all your scrip on them yet.
---
When you got 50 you'll want to try get a good weapon. Or if your really really smart you'll only spend enough each day not to go over 1k and wait for the sales.
---
But against what?
---
\#4 don't be an asshole if someone wants to run around and loot a few mobs to recoup their ammo for a minute or 2. When the op is over.
---
Louder, for the people in the back.
---
If there are a lot of players in the event, the option to join refuses to pop out.  Very frustrating indeed, especially if you are trying to join ACP without having to run through the nuke zone.
---
You get the security and survival from power armor just fine.  Bloodied heavy gunners aren't glass cannons, they're just straight cannons.
---
Hahaha. A vampire explosive handmade would be nice to have. Have yet to even run across one at a vending machine.
---
I really enjoy them, I just wish doing them more than once a day was worth it to me. They are fantastic ....for 8ish minutes a day.
---
Some people use this

I’ll try that tomorrow. Thanks
---
\*clanks around in power armor\* wtf is stealth.
---
You don't know that he'll actually need them though.
---
I have the ballistic and energy ammo weight reduction perks and I just keep all my ammo in my backpack.  It is 90% lighter there.
---
The pressure from the fans, although to be honest, I really like the 76 community, it is the least toxic in the franchise
---
Same. You need over 1000ea for the robot ones. I wasnt particularlly thrilled about that when low level ones were possible. Im even less so now they will actually put up a fight
---
I do it until I get Elder, then I only do it again if a friend comes online.
---
Just hope they don't add them where you have to completely change your build. Stealth sounds uh. Interesting for full power armor / heavy guns build.  
---
CLANG CLANG CLANG PEW PEW PEW.  
---
AM I STEALTHY YET?!
---
That’s awesome your very lucky and now I know about another thing I had no idea existed lol
---
There’s a glitch you can get certain nuclear winter guns. You can’t get a higher level then 5. It’s junk, I wouldn’t trade a bunch for it but I’m sure ppl will. You go look up fallout 76 glitches and you’ll find it
---
Try it man.  I hate playing with strangers, and won't ever do it.  You litterally have zero interaction with your group outside of seeing thier name on screen, and possibly seeing them at a public event.    
---
I join a group on joining for the bonuses and I have never interacted with a teammate.
---
I like the idea of the balloons above your prize cause the camera shows the direction but not really where especially if it's under the map which happens a lot so BGS gets their 10 mins anyway.
---
I did some runs with some low lvls too and they performed pretty good. I think one was lvl24 and one was lvl 40 (both on different teams). Me (lvl408) and the lvl24 finished in ~7:30 mins on a two man team. And with the lvl40 was a three man team and we finished in ~7 mins. I don’t care if I play with low levels or not. Everybody was once new to a game and didn’t knew what the fuck they were doing and maybe got help by a more experienced player. Then why not return the favor and help a new player? If someone asks me politely if I can help them (no matter if if new or experienced player) I’ll take my time and help them
---
Clutch thank you!
---
Unless it has a faster firing attribute (which would make it magic) they aren't worth much.
---
You can use fed76 to price (rough price) a legendary's value.
---
 https://fed76.info/pricing/?item=None&amp;effects=None
---
I suck at Reddit links, sorry.
---
To be honest, I wouldn't mind the chance significantly lowered. Say 5,10,25% chance. And just let you do it more than once a day.
---
Awhile back during scorched earth it happen like 3 times a row on my Xbox one x and then never happened again. Don’t know what happened but I did have it happen to me. It said that my shit over heated and I know that didn’t happen
---
They did it to create a base to tweak damage off of and to flatten the damage curve.
---
With the nerf, you probably should consider carrying 40 drums.
---
monthly MEAT Week is way too much MEAT Week..
---
All good! Just knowing that website exists makes it worth it
---
I dont use power armor but I have zero stealth perks. I deliberately stayed away from it since almost every game where its a choice I play the stealth/sniper. Im enjoying a different playstyle this time round. Im the idiot charging in with a noisy shotgun or heavy gun
---
Medics in my opinion is better. 
---
And a fair price if you want to sell would be between 2.5k-3k for the Medics and 1.5k-2.75k for the Suppressors.
---
Hey! I’d say suppressors is better than medics for heavy guns, because I think most folks use heavy guns outside of vats. I use a website to help pricecheck some items that I’m not sure on: Fed76.
---
[https://fed76.info](https://fed76.info)
---
Depending on how many stars it is really can change its value. If you put the legendary effects into this tool and it says there’s no demand for this item, I would likely sell them for 500 caps at your vendor. Any more than that and they may sit for too long. 
---
Hopefully this helps!
---
If economy broke again you wouldn’t be able to display them at all
---
Maybe try turning off vsync?
---
Then we need different versions
---
Same! The guy only wanted a AA,E, 90 Gatling plasma and forest camo jumpsuit so I though hell yea.
---
Once again, it makes absolutely no sense that regular armor people can get more total carry weight very easily, regardless of whether or not I actually need a lot more weight
---
Awesome thanks for the advice
---
The terminal on the desk.  Boot Department B on the way in, then Boot C on the way out and wait for the last wave.
---
Liquid courage isn't even qol, it's straight up a damage bonus against earl.
---
variety is the spice of life. Welcome to blandland.
---
That's why I see them die every 30 seconds lol
---
MEAT Week is a nice place to visit.. but I wouldnt want to live there...
---
I just think people are misunderstanding the situation, I don't and won't play games with other people, but I join public groups because there are no interactions.  It's just a "here's some bonuses" button.    
---
Obvi peeps can do what they want but I think there's a fear of a situation that doesn't exist and missing out on bonuses they would want because of it.
---
Bullet shield is pointless in PA due to the massive hidden damage reduction done by PA.
---
Portable power is a useless perk. PA chassis weighs 10lbs and none of the individual parts counts towards inventory weight.
---
If you’re going to use ballistic weapons, grab bandolier to haul stupid amounts of ammo.
---
Demo expert was a minor damage increase to explosive legendary effect weapons (~13% for 5 points) prior to one wasteland. Not sure how it affects legendary effect damage now. Only the true explosive weapons really benefit from it. 
---
Power user is nice for heavy energy weapons using cores; but be aware of the ammo glitch happening right now. I just retired an ultracite gatling laser because I’d get down to 200-300 shots before the game demands I reload.
---
Yeah it’s a rare outfit
---
&gt;Yeah it's worth any decent legendary you want. Maybe around 20-30k 556
---
Only to a small handful of people who have to have everything first. It's a new permanent drop (for now) with a decent drop rate. Compared to something like the rare ultracite PA plans or rare outfits it's not worth squat.
---
I see people offering legacies for the new daily ops stuff and it blows my mind. Just give it a week or three and you'll get them yourself.
---
If you're collecting guts or greens, deposit it all at once 15 seconds before the mission ends, not in little chunks. You'll lose less bar.
---
Dont we all "eventually"?.. you can only play one style/build for so long before getting curious about others.. and when he does atleast hes got some modules on hand.
---
I got one after second day and I just got another one. I was saving when everything was going for a lot but I figured I would learn it. I have 6 balls from Earle that I can use but I started just scrapping those things being they weigh five pounds. Since Earle has elephantiasis. Lol
---
What are dummy plans?
---
This is exactly why the etiquette you wrote about initially will never truly work. I for example only use int buff teams, but I will join daily ops team if that's the only one with a free spot and there are already couple full int teams n the server. Just to get all the party buffs and start farming score via repeatable asap. It might sound like a rude move but as you said, we all play the game the way we want to. And of course I can create my own int team, but you won't believe how many times I found myself as a sole member of a team no one else would join. It's a potential waste of time on a server with many already created and full teams.
---
I don't see how you're getting more straight carry weight.  Large backpack is 120, plus 50 for armor, right?  Maybe 5 or 10 more for under armor?
---
Not if you're out of range in the first place. I just like not having my controls disabled for 3 seconds at a time.
---
Damn, you've got serious issues buddy. None of this misogyny garbage you're spewing, belongs on this thread. 
---
Looks to me like you need to start backing that truck up...
---
The we could have other ones like collecting tech for BoS then researching it, or drugs and guns for raiders, 
---
And building materials for settlers.
---
Some strange things going on I daily ops..had a full lobby on my private server a squad of 4 doing daily ops randomly some one would get kicked to menu screen they'd rejoin but the last time the whole squad was booted except me .were still in party chat but it was a disappointment to say the least.1st time I ever had a full lobby of like 7 people on my server.maybe it was my internet
---
Eh.  I would never want to respec my character.  I would honestly just start another one before trying another build on my current one.
---
I've thought the same thing but I was just saying what people would be willing to pay for them as I sold my special ops suit for a B/50cd handmade
---
Very nice, thanks!
---
Considering I've read that Master Infiltrator automatically picks locks at player camps and gives you a bounty, yeah, I would hate that too.
---
This too.  But my point is that liquid courage allows you to do more damage by being able to get right in front of earl.
---
They just got shit builds
---
Will do, and thank you. It's my fault and I should have slowed down, but this entire week is just a rush for fucking everything in my life right now; this just added on.
---
What difference does it make.. still need modules for crafting
---
Whoever you see dying is doing it wrong.  I almost never die, and 95% of the time I do, it was preventable/my fault, etc.  The build, built right, is very tanky
---
I was already gifted a really good Handmade rifle from someone on this sub for when I reach cap. So my quest will most likely be for armor.
---
People coming to find out how awesome this rare item this guy sold them is only to find out they got a exploit or hacked item.
---
It's supposed to be an Assault Rifle skin like the Service Rifle skin is for the Handmade. None of it makes any fucking sense. They should've reworked weapons with One Wasteland
---
Large backpack 120
---
50 from armor mods
---
25 from +1 strength legendary effect
---
75 from unyielding
---
That’s 270 possible bonus carry weight. Power armor gets 100 bonus from calibrated shocks and an extra 100 if you’re using excavator, I think there’s also a torso mod giving +2 strength so that’s another 10. You can get 60 more carry weight on just a normal player than a huge suit of mechanical armor. It makes absolutely zero sense that power armor hasn’t had any buffs yet or doesn’t have legendary effects yet
---
If I don't use them on my character, no, I don't.
---
Correct, to max XP the team leader should invite using Daily Ops, communicate to the team while you get ready that they are switching to casual to get a minute or two of increased kill XP then before you get to the boss switch back to Daily Ops.  Not that this is recommended because the leader might forget but it is how to max out XP. 😁
---
And you gonna grind rep before being able to buy it !
---
A very cool build :)
---
I love people imagination on fallout , great stuff man ;)
---
To feed chally you need to buy the recipe from Grahm then you can craft some in-between events so it is ready to go. It needs boiled water, 2 tato, 2 razorgrain and 2 carrot. 
---
Also take some wood with you to put on the pile that is near the cooking station. You dont need much but it hoes in batches of 5.
---
That's assuming a very specific circumstance for the regular armor.  Although to be clear, I do agree with you.  People in power armor should be able to carry way more than people without it.
---
I'm cool with people playing as they like, but I read a lot of fears and concerns about being in a public group that are simply not real, and I just wanna let people know that the downsides they imagine don't exist, and that there are huge bonuses they could be enjoying without altering thier game experience one iota.    
---
If they don't wanna do it, that's thier business, but me personally I like to know if I have a incomplete or imperfect view on something so that I can make better choices.
---
One of the most coveted items, dont get lowballed.
---
I can’t believe he got rid of it
---
I went through all my scrip at 45 and got 3 handmades..I know it was luck but I got a junkies 10damage and a anti armor 33vats and some other under leveled weapons but I think it was a win
---
Having the maximum for power armor is also very specific circumstances. 3 mods and using a set that is inferior to most others
---
I have hated the look of the AR since it was in fallout 4 one of the worst looking guns they've ever made.
---
What system do you play on? Pc, xbox, or playstation? If pc I can help you out a little and show ya the ropes.
---
I don’t like that I no longer have zero use for my fun low level weapons like the auto 10mm pistol with explode rounds I used throughout the forest and toxic valley
---
Just mobs in general. Not looking to solo Earle or anything
---
Or that's what the guy thinks will happen. He isn't BoS, just a fanboy.
---
To encourage daily log ins.  It's for the game stats not the player experience.
---
The pink stash box is from the atom shop, and an item I've been waiting for the return of for quite some time now...
---
I am Xbox. Thanks for the offer.
---
The power armors in terms of defense are essentially the same.  I tested them and for most attacks I took the same amount of damage in excavator as t 65.
---
Finally o can get someone to eat my ass
---
It’s worth more than you are being offered on your marketplace post.
---
The Daily Op had a couple in them.  Maybe it was a visual glitch, but I could have sworn they were just about my level
---
Get high levels to help you with their infinite amount of too much shit. I've been dumping unneeded ammo in rail station suitcases (and the green bag near Grahm's cookout during meat week) as well as plans and stuff. Fallout 1st users tend to have tons of excess scrap sitting around and hardcore players have scoured every plan. I genuinely recommend trying to find a nice high level who's willing to make you things like high end underarmor (which is level agnostic) or part with their unneeded ammo. High levels also tend to have way too many stimpacks. I'd offer help but I messed up and lost all my scrap to pvp so I'm out of my ability to make much reliably
---
Uh you would be incorrect about it being about doing nothing.  Many participation trophies are awarded to all teams and players who very much so did something.  Plus I never really liked saying an individual or team comes in “first” at the event.  Who were they competing against to claim such a placement?  It’s basically just a timed event that they completed and they expect to be rewarded with a rare reward for just being able to do so.
---
There is absolutely nothing special about my characters build or weapons and I can squeeze under the 8 minute mark in certain events by myself and i’m sure as I learn the routes of the other places I will be able to do them all under 8 minutes.  This game still is not very difficult no matter what people think.
---
Bloodied 2525 fixer or better.  😋
---
Honestly, I think it's fine.
---
Ah sorry then. Best thing I can say is take it slow and don't try to rush. With the new level system things can get really tough and overwhelming. Think of it like fallout 4 survival mode where you needed to be extra careful.
---
I am at level 50 on my alt and havent even finished the 1st wayward quest.im in no hurry to start grinding rep.i bearly unlocked the raiders guass gatling or what ever it is and I havent wanted to make any.too much in my inventory
---
I'm on xbox, what do you need? I can repair your weapons and give ammo, only thing I run low on is lead
---
Does more than one mini nuke shot
---
--Meet--
---
Modification for fat man launcher. Makes it shoot several at once
---
Halloween content is one of the things I like best in gaming in general.  Very big letdown that they aren't bringing it back.
---
Some people just dont want lowbies and you have to accept that. Some are just friends who want the bonus you just have to accept that. You have others like myself that dont give a fuck until you stray from the damn beacon to many times then i get mad.
---
2 words, shotgun + vats
---
yeah i realized that, wish it was perma, but i guess there are plenty of other events i could do to get them
---
No ones asking about "you"... hes asking whats the best way to spend script... and youve not bought modules?.. you must not have an optomised build.. so yeah if you want a mediocre end build i guess so
---
Microsoft loves money.hell they are still updating minecraft. So long as there is a player base Microsoft wont cut 76
---
Strange. Maybe it glitched on yours. I've only seen level 100s on my level 350 toon
---
Fatman mod that makes 1 nuke 6 nukes
---
If it was over by Exctractor Charlie then you picked it up off the ground near the spawn point. I cant remember the name on it. Arthur something maybe. I dont think theres any quest attached to it
---
Yea, you cannot always judge people based on there level. I am living poof of that - over 1100+ hours on record and I am still terrible at the game...
---
Nah, that's dead center and traveling there is cheap enough. The gold vault on the other side, that one hurts and should be free.
---
I said "if" hypothetically.  If OP is going to use pa, there's not much to spend them on.
---
Microsoft now owns all the IPs. If they think it could be successful then it ultimately comes down to them. 
---
Chris Avellone is also working on a new project (one of which he hasn't been able to confirm (or deny)) he gave some suspicious responses when asked if it was a New Vegas sequel or new Fallout game. This was before the acquisition so he definitely couldn't talk about it there if it was. (This was in August I believe)
---
This acquisition has been in the works since 2018 apparently, meaning that decision could've been made recently. 
---
It's all hopeful thinking imo, though it's much more of a possibility now than it ever would've been before. Microsoft are most definitely not going to let Fallout sit for another 6 years without another entry so, another spin-off, next year or maybe even 2022 would make sense
---
Yeah you would think, but they choose to use that dumb system instead.
---
Haha, yea. I always play a tanky boi in any game I can. So I'm fully DR / Power armor perks so I can just run into things and stand there throwing grenades at my own feet while pew pewing non stop.
---
"Hitler's Buzzsaw"
---
&gt; On my lv 18 alt yesterday (explosive blood eagles in burning mine) joined a special ops team-
---
&gt; There's 2 level 300+s and a lv ~115 so I figure cakewalk.
---
&gt; They all leave team and form a new one. With just them. Ok whatever I give it a go. 9min and change. I try 5 or 6 more times but my best time is 8:32. (Sigh)
---
&gt; See another special ops team form. Jump in. One lv80 and the 2x lv 300s from before.
---
&gt; They all leave. $##$$#
---
&gt; -and wtf would it matter even if they did carry me?
---
...
---
So you're mad you didn't get carried?
---
Bruh? Where have you been the past week...there was a few days of  posts saying"well now that they killed bloodied " everything was nerfed...its nerf or nothing
---
Once is enough if you get Elder.
---
"You're pretty good."
---
This is an intriguing idea. I'd personally consider an older Ocelot rather than the twenty year old in Metal Gear SOLID 3; I find that a lot of characters tend to skew younger, and the idea of being an aged immortal is more fun than someone who appears perpetually young.  The latter seems to frequently skew more towards the whole sexy, immortal vampire trope (which is perfectly fine, as an aside!) than I personally like.
---
I'd also highly encourage you to play as a character *inspired* by Ocelot rather than a direct port into the Fallout universe. There may not be a lot of parallels to the story, and  I've always found more meaningful to create and be a unique character rather than embody someone else's creation. 
---
Also, in case you're not aware, [there's a Fallout 76 roleplaying subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FO76roleplay/)! This seems like the perfect sort of discussion to be had over there, and you may find more replies.
---
Then why go in reddit and ask whats your best way to spend it? theres only two options.. weaps &amp; armor OR modules and scrap... if your not doing one then youve no other choice but the other....
---
No it's a survival game so you are going to fly through ammo and stimpacks. Ammo making, chemist, and super duper perks are going to be your friends.
---
Do you have the healing factor mutation? Once you get it you won’t look back.
---
I've played half asleep before patch 22. But gaining that many levels in your sleep, I'm impressed! 
---
Seriously though this is unusual and I've never heard of such a bug. This is a Bethesda game so I wouldn't be supprised.
---
Your camera identifies them
---
Some accounts got mystery atoms. Then had them removed, and some got banned accidentally for ‘exploiting’. Just continue on since you didn’t buy them.
---
I punch things
---
me too but I only see the good camps here never in game lol
---
Honestly if you run the daily ops a few times you'll be set. 
---
I'm sitting pretty with 200 radaway and a little over 120 stimpacks.
---
it's a bit like having the B.E.T.A. hat, nice to have, cool to show off.
---
Oh wow
---
Even the assaultrons are sick of assaultrons' shit
---
There as to be more than this.    
---
I struggled with my two characters till at least almost 30. Did you use the Nukes and Dragons site that's pinned on this sub?    
---
Stimpacks are something I rarely sell and always to a vendor. Even with the healing mutation you still need them.    
---
Both of them have had a melee weapon on them since I started them. Nothing outstanding but a Legendary that hits faster and does a lot of damage can save you ammo. Pick up any ammo you find you don't use and spend time at the Ammo Converter. My 1st got over 1000 round easy from points. Ammosmith R2 and Super Duper R3 and Ammo Factory (Legendary) will put a big boost in ammo production.    
---
You should be getting a lot of ammo, aid items and gear just by playing the game.
---
I tweaked some ini settings, went from 70fps to about 120ish in less demanding places. It can still drop but overall higher. 
---
The shadow distance setting seems to be one of the more demanding ones. Overall render distance could be turned down. 
---
The reason for such poor performance is the game is rendering way more than it needs to be since the default ini settings are so high. Your PC is rendering stuff in Whitesprings when you are close to Vault 76 for example.
---
I cant argue that one...only other option would be to not scrip anything until he hits 50 but that could be a few hours to a few days iether way I would spend the scrip
---
Pipe is life
---
The problem with your build is it isn’t specialised in any tree. Until you do that your damage will remain poor and you’ll struggle. U have 4 in line wanderer. There’s zero reason for this perk now with public teams. You have no damage increase in any ranged weapon and yet have perks that avoid armour. The difference this makes is minimal for the cards. How many weapons and grenades are you carrying at one time for bear arms.....with no damage increase for heavys....and ordinance express to be useful. Pick a weapons tree. And build the damage in that. Some overlap like rifles and automatics or heavy guns and melee and build for that.

I think what you're saying is totally reasonable.. and yes I agree there can be benefits to playing on teams, definitely. I have even met one or two nice people... I don't have an issue with people playing on public teams. But what bothers me here, is when people insist that others have to comply. Or when they make characterizations about people that want to play solo. It's actually a form of bullying... And that is where the problem is. There are people that post that have forgotten "live and let live".  
---
for me personally, playing solo has allowed me to become comfortable with doing certain events... And allows me to become quite proficient at them. I have a build that is geared toward my style of play, and not geared toward having teammates. For me playing solo is more fun and of course, more challenging. But I totally understand that many people enjoy the team experience and thrive when they play in a group. 
---
What pisses me off, again, are people who try to insult and intimidate others for having a different viewpoint.
---
TIL.... played since launch...
---
Man thats such a good idea
---
Those numbers next to your gun are largely meaningless now.
---
Since everything is levelled to you, the only thing that matters is how much health the enemy loses when you shoot them.
---
A level 1 with a no-mod rifle will do more relative damage than a level 200 with a fully modded legendary.
---
How long do you stay on the main menu screen for?  But I agree with you.
---
longer than you would expect
---
No, the balancing made it a little too tough for low and mid level players. Bethesda recently said that they are listening to the feed back and planning to implement patches to help with this. 
---
As far as what to do now, the best bet is to either buy stim packs from other or collect blood packs to craft them yourself. If you are going to craft, use Chemist and Super duper in order to increase chances of producing more stim packs. Also, if you happen to get a vampiric weapon or an armor piece that gives regeneration, use them because it will cut down on the healing items that you use. If you have the caps, sometimes people will sell them on vendors for cheap (if they are one star). Definitely worth it for sustainability. 
---
Also, if you are on PC, add me - Eldyrus3. I have a bunch of stimpacks that I dont need.
---
Do heavy weapons have enough dropoff to be losing damage standing outside of his range? I play support and focus on spawns so LC is mostly helpful so I don't have to pay attention to where Earle is while I do my job
---
I would understand that if it weren't for the fact that you get like 4 minutes to loot hoover afterwards.
---
My point exactly.
---
In general it's usually closer to level 80 before your build is in a place where you'll be taking in more resources then you're using during most activities. It's about your level that people start min/maxing their builds a bit... By which I mean cutting out some quality of life perks in favor of damage perks. You'll also want to start getting some higher end gear probably. What specifically you want will depend on if you're high health or low health, but usually Bloodied is less resource intensive than a high health build.
---
Its hilarious. I'm a fully fledged bloodied build with detha claw gauntlet. I can survive easily easily solo in the ops and against almost any enemy solo. Who can sneak up and take me down like I have no resistances? Those fuckers. Idk how they got so bad.
---
And if you hold the weapon you need ammo for and let some people get kills you will get ammo sometimes shit amount sometimes decent amount
---
Their team, their choice.  Bethesda's job to promote the game, not mine.
---
I don’t remember picking anything up I was shooting a mole miner dead center unloading on him and that popped up it was crazy maybe I picked it up before fighting and it just didn’t register
---
Ammo is worthless now because of the legendary perks. Just be careful. 🤓
---
I’m 220 and I joined a team of 100’s, they never initiated the daily and I didn’t have much time to play that day, figure I go even if solo just for the reward and log out, then when I’m about to complete it with a minute to spare, the leader of the team just kicked me out, and I was teleported automatically. I sent him a message that it was a dick move, unnecessary and he never responded, jeez...
---
I had radscorps tunnel through the æther and Stacy new on top of the Hemlock Holes maintenance area carport roof. I hate all the tunneling critters.
---
Hold on to it man. They don't come up very often.
---
Well as someone with a 10mm with stats well....
---
It gets messy. 😈
---
Theres a full set of PA that needs modules to craft.. also theres that entire event that weve all been playing towards.. with Fortifing Atlas and Daily Ops thats going to add more content, like armor and weaps, thats almost going to definitly going to need modules to craft ie.. BoS DLC... but yeah.. it makes "complete" sense not to "save" modules....
---
The locks are only a problem if you level up MI and hit an auto pick on level 0
---
LC seems fine since you're guaranteed his vocal sac per kill and you really only need the one LC per fight if you use it well (like after his hp resets)
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e65aa56&amp;d=eh2ek1pp2pe2s01ss2se2la2ao0&amp;n=Basic
---
I’ve left in the melee and rifles perks. Pick one side. I’ve removed the perks that don’t help you at all. Have u considered low health? This will help with all your carry weight issues and if u go melee with damage as well. Do you not use mutations?  If not why not?
---
Any idea how much it is cause I need to do some saving up
---
It's not drop off so much as that he just moves around.  It makes more sense to me to do to him what I do to the queen, stand in front of his face, tank the damage, and get head shots all day every day.  And now I can.
---
The bungalow? Here, I use them. They are big.
---

Took multiple tries today for me to get Elder because its the fucking burrows and I am a numpty that is STILL getting lost in that shithole (sorry to anyone who got stuck with my stupid arse on their team today). Finally got it and got zero special rewards for the first time. Some days youre the pigeon, some days the statue. Definitely a statue day for me. I dont know how I feel about 100% chance at the special items but I think "none" is a kick in the face for achieving the best time. Maybe an additional legendary would at least be something for the effort
---
Goal was for gauss minigun in mind, portable power will be gone and bullet shield can be gone. Do you recommend just moving the 3 points somewhere else? Don't plan on grabbing weight reduction for heavy weapons in str
---
Refund it through support. They'll give you your atoms back and, lucky for you, you get to keep the items as support can't remove items. Just grant atoms.
---
I'm not saying not to take them, just that it could be beneficial to know OP's plans.
---
I no longer use a sniper build but a iex lever would probably be one of the more viable weapons.so if you have one enjoy it or trade it for something you want
---
I'd feel bad keeping them, though, but thank you.
---
Next season we should be getting some new weapons and armor. So it's a possibility.
---
That’s true, thank you
---
&gt;No, the balancing made it a little too tough for low and mid level players.
---
I wouldn't say tough, the game went from fun and enjoyable yet challenging to Dark Souls meets Cup Head with no fingers.
---
What’s the drop rate on it?
---
*scruffle scruffle*
---
Hello there!
---
I'm a power armour noob.only use excavator 200 carry then add the shocks I'm hualing 400 plus with it...
---
What's this?
---
I was doing the event Feed the People. Im level 100, this other guy is level 25. We were both shooting the same enemy. For me he was level 100, but the level 25 was chunking the health of it. So I gotta assume the level is perceived different for everyone depending on your level.
---
Just in time for a new system. I ordered my series x today. But a while back my Xbox one x would shut off when I would go fight queen and would say it over heated which I know wasn’t the case. But happened like three times and then never again
---
It respawns. Ive picked it up and scrapped it by accident before too and some time later I happened to detect it on the ground again. Its by the spawn point at Charlie on the ground. Very hard to actually see
---
Yeah I long ago stopped doing any of the quests, so as to maximize the efficiency of the grind, game lost a lot of the interest since, LV 175 and still have about 5% of locations not yet visited
---
Sure, but if thats the best option if you have no plans.. Which Is what it seems like, otherwise why would OP ask
---
I've never actually seen it listed so I have no idea, but knowing this game it'll probably be part of a bundle with the pink princess bed.
---
I wouldnt worry about it. Support are very helpful and sometimes mention you can keep the items. 
---
Free stuff for your troubles I guess.
---
I don't, will look that one up.
---
Well a the full 1000 a day would be fair I would say. If I've got time to earn that amount of scrip that about let me spend it.
---
First off don’t correct me if youre fuckin up to I can’t control auto correct and Ofc griefing has been going on since day 1 but them canceling pvp made it way worse from people having trap camps to the legendary perk worst of all they’re pacifist
---
Yes... it is. That wasn't what I asked though.
---
Same here I went soon as I could vats.got 3 levels and my 1st legendary armor and a legendary revolver .
---
Fair enough.  To be fair 99% of people will probably use them.  It's a pretty good catchall answer.
---
Sometimes it happened if your a bloodied build when you take food buffs or just chems buffs you will get 30 or so extra health but at bloodied you only have around 20-30 so when the buff wears off you lose 30hp which will kill you instantly.
---
Edited dont use buffs then rad away because it bugs out an kills you instantly too!!
---
Gotta educate em somehow. I don't promote harassing low levels but he started it so you did the right thing IMO. Your teammate sounds like a douche tho.
---
I only play it until I get the top tier rewards to.
---
But usually I can find a group to run it.
---
Did it solo just for the daily reward but took me 10 minutes as I get lost in the burrows.
---
Getting better but still make wrong turns which cost time
---
What level are you? If you're under 20 and don't have any legendary guns yet I would suggest keeping one weapon for each ammo type on you: pipe pistol, hunting rifle, pipe revolver, and 10mm. It's less than ideal, but you'll pick up tons of random ammo and weapons from mobs. Scrap all but the best condition weapon of each type, and cycle through them as you run low on ammo.
---
You'll be carrying a bit more weight than you'd like, but you'll always have a gun with some ammo. Also, you'll unlock tons of mods by scrapping the extra guns, so if you find a decent pipe gun or hunting rifle you can start modding it to do more damage. 
---
Oh, pick up concentrated fire rank 1 if you don't have it already. It will let you target enemy heads or other weak points for higher damage and drastically reduce the amount of ammo you use.
---
Additionally, find or buy a cheap 1 handed or unarmed melee weapon. Use it on things that don't shoot at you, like mongrels and mole rats.
---
Also, keep your camp simple for now. At low levels it only costs 5-10 caps to move it, so just build a simple 1x2 platform with a bed, stove, stash, and workbench. If you find yourself low on health after a battle just find a place nearby to place your camp and sleep for a bit so you can heal without wasting stims.
---
Lastly, you should have learned the healing salve recipe after finding the overseer's camp. They give the same healing as a diluted stim and are cheap to craft. 
---
Go to Flatwoods and head to the river behind the church. Head south along the river gathering bloodleaf and wood. When you get to the dry riverbed turn right and follow it (gathering more bloodleaf and wood) until you get to the bridge by Sunnytop Farm.
---
Turn right (north) at the bridge and climb up to the road. Follow the road back east towards Flatwoods and gather all the soot flowers (and wood) you can find. When you get back to town collect 50-60 water from the river.
---
Go to the cooking stove across from the church, boil all the water, and then craft healing salve. If you picked up all the plants along the way you should have enough ingredients to make at least 20-30 of them.
---
25k .556 15k fusion cells 8 to 10k ultra .45 and a couple cores in case I need to glitch a wall.
---
I deleted my initial response to you after seeing an earlier comment you made regarding women. First of all I'm not intimidated by you.
---
Secondly, yeah I'm a bitch and I wear that title proudly. Definitely too old to be a snowflake. Here's the thing...
---
You have serious issues, you are a misogynist at best... I find you offensive and crude. In my opinion,  you crossed the line. I don't care what you say to me, I see you as a sick miserable man that really needs help...and you definitely are not an asset to this community.
---
So i have a unstoppable monster that i was 2 shotting lvl 60 mirelurks the other day because my gun broke mid fight with 5 strength and didn't have any perks for it so i say yes its still viable.
---
Maybe if you don't have the damage boosting perks for them, then yeah they don't do a lot of damage.
---
If you do (which you should) then the game isn't harder.
---
A lot of people just don’t understand how Daily Ops work. The reason you need more people is to make the signal boosters move faster. It doesn’t matter what level they are, as long as they’re standing next to it, it works. Any warm body will do. 
---
All I care about on a Daily Ops team is that the other people actually DO the Daily Op. As long as they jump in, I’m good. If not, I’ll kick ‘em real quick.
---
like the Tesla, that was NUT! I literarily got shot behind a pole and do not even know how ...
---
That's a nice trade on your end. Congrats!
---
Mostly because it’s way easier to get the experience buff food and you don’t need glowing meat steaks boosted.
---
Yeah no.... 99% is a generous figure... case in point all the other replies that say "buy legendary modules".. it would seem like your wisdom is only shared by you my friend.
---
If you’re on PC, I have a ton of stimpacks (and radaway) that I really don’t need, since they build up faster than I use them
---
Show up n just let every else finish it. an collect prime mean you can only use a certain amount of prime meat a day an prime meat gives you Script
---
Idk legit or not but I hope that barrel is added.have a b explosive one I been holding for at least a year
---
&gt;You should be getting a lot of ammo, aid items and gear just by playing the game.
---
I am using a shitload of ammo to get a little bit of ammo since the update. I'm getting 1 stimpak for every 2 I would need normally. Before the update I was going along fine, no issues. After update, can't even play.
---
Got hit by lightning one too many times, and now I'm a contender for being the ugliest thing in the wasteland!
---
oh that's interesting. will check it out!
---
Yeah but right after I accidentally dropped it with the weapon skin and was destroyed forever 😁😁
---
seems many have same issue, I guess xbox version has a "bug" XD (pun intended)
---
Are you still eating Vault-Os and Brahman milk? Son, I highly suggest a healthy can of meat stew served over a nice bowl of iguana meat *.
---
Yeah it would be. It holds 4 x the ammo before requiring reload for starters so probably 100 rounds or close to depending on what thats calculated on. Add into that explosive damage and the faster reload it would be a pretty powerful/useful weapon even without perks. I would advise hanging onto it because good weapons dont come around often
---
Less downtime reloading, so it has very high dps. Great pickup!
---
There's like a ton of areas in the cranberry bog where enemies just don't bother you, like the mountains. People need to be creative.
---
Your build is your damage. A well built low health commando build with that gun will do very well. If your built for heavys and belle that gun won’t do well. It’s worth a chunk btw
---
I hate those the grind is needed people im already grinding asylum dressers, gold, bos paint plans, legendary drops and rare plans I don't need another grind.
---
If you’re on XB I’ll give you 8K caps for it.
---
Do not forget a single action revolver with increased reload speed. It'a revolution!
---
... not my proudest moment, but a large group of those once caught me completely by surprise, jumping out from behind stuff, and killed me (glass canon sniper) pre-OWL.  I can imagine in tight quarters they'd be terrifying now if they managed to have horde-like numbers
---
Cluster bomb nuke basically
---
Hear hear
---
Thought that damn thing was powerful even after the nerf.if it's not kinda a bummer
---
The specific item is the [ProSnap Deluxe camera](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/ProSnap_Deluxe_camera). You get it by starting the quest [Bucket List](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Bucket_List).
---
I haven't explored the Savage Divide/Forest/Ash heap junction, because the enemies would've been lvl 15 garbage.  That's like 5-8 locations I ignore because of the arbitrary level system pre-OW
---
Borderlands 3 was doing that to me constantly while joining friends game literally 50% of the time and same for him quality of games have really taken a nosedive.
---
I agree. The rare rewards are already tiered. You're having to play multiple times to get the harder rewards anyway, then they added an additional daily gate.
---
Going to see what my options are with my current build but if it’s too much work to move around my stats I’ll DM you
---
OP, FYI it would probably go for trade only (more value than max caps) in the trade sub :)
---
&gt;What’s the drop rate on it?
---
Miniscule, less than 1%. It is hands down one of the rarest outfits in the game other than maybe a couple event things.
---
Preferably with a safe reentry plan
---
You can now buy lunchboxes for gold bullion from Mortimer or Samuel.
---
I wish we could claim workshops for them and fight waves of the opposite faction for reputation.
---
It’s weird how every creature decided to start abusing Buffout.
---
They don't have enough bonus rewards to make it a 100% drop chance. Honestly, they should bump the chance down a few percent. But make it so you can't get dupes unless you have all the plans. Largely because its very easy to get the 8min.
---
First of all I never have pacifist I’m not bitch made like you you’re complaining about someone being able to kill you in a post apocalyptic game 😭😭 goofy
---
So either they implemented an incomplete model, or they are testing on live, or both. Got it 👍
---
Yeah I didn't want to waste the perk spots either.....but I kept blowing myself up....  :)
---
Well this is all just an assumption because I don't know how the system works.
---
I assume the NPCs dont actually have levels, they're all a set level and the game gives them a visual level relative to you and they do the same damage % to everybody. 
---
Event enemies are scaled higher though, harder to kill, much stronger. So maybe instead of the enemys having levels, there are just systems in place that make all the calculations respective to the person. 
---
Thats how multiple people can fight the same enemy and still have it do the same % of damage, minus whatever your DR is. 
---
Again, idk, this is all assumption based
---
Keeping it real my friend.
---
Fallout 76 only has around  34k players that's not heaps of money.
---
Ty - I’m somewhat new to fo76 end game stuff (lv 70) so any advice is appreciated
---
I'd love to know if I could get elder on solo it but until I stop getting lost there's no chance of that ever happening.
---
The auto rifles can unload a clip in less time than it takes to reload, meaning they spend less than half of their time firing. Quad gives them a huge boost to their sustained dps, up there with bloodied. I've only run the numbers for FFR fixers, and there the quad comes out on top by 15% or so. Your gun isn't ffr, has faster reloads, and handmades reload faster than fixers, so I'd imagine it's pretty comparable to bloodied.
---
I think there are alot of missed opportunities in this fine game.
---
In this case, the link you shared in Fed76 with its advice is correct. Trade only. Don't be low balled.
---
&gt;I would prefer high level player to speed up the runs.
---
Any warm body speeds up the run because the uplink connection bar fills faster with more people. I have run several noobs through it and I just tell them to run, follow me, and stay near the uplink.
---
Now I feel like an asshole. I honestly don’t know what it’s worth, just saw something and threw out a price. Hope you get something excellent for it.
---
The problem is that the 5-10 is them finding a server, not players.
---
I agree though, id much rather be able to actually roam around and listen to all those holotapes instead of picking them up and forgetting I have it when the round starts
---
Oof
---
Oh thats a nice Idea, will need to try that
---
Another tip - now with meat week, do the prime meat event that is located north west of the alpha launch site. This spawns honey beasts which drip stim packs. I just looted one that gave me 6 stim packs for a single kill.  Do this event especially if there are other players there to help out.
---
I had it happen a couple of patches back on my XB and it didn't happen again until tonight where it just shut the damn thing down. I guess that's like the equivalent of a 'crash to desktop' on a PC.
---
A lot.
---
Jesus m8 I get npcs get annoying but they civvies have done nothing to earn death
---
Thanks a lot it’s been bugging the hell out of me
---
Haha no worries I would’ve probably done the same
---
Sneak 3 works fine for me. My agility with unyielding is 25, and I also had escape artist. I have super mutants literally bump into me and they still don’t see me.  
---
The only place sneak doesn’t work for me is for special ops, because by now everybody should know that sneak is disabled in that event, since enemies have high level perception.
---
You know what? Cbf. Not in the mood to argue with morons who probably run a Vampire's heavy weapon Power Armor build and want everyone to bow to their decree that patch 22 is fine and dandy. I'll delete my comment.
---
I've had a few of the crashes that kicked me to the home screen. But only two of them(now as of tonight) where it just shut me down completely.
---
I’ve read some stuff about legacy’s on this sub. Is this worth trading for some type of legacy? Sorry for all the Q’s
---
Time gating is also good in a way because it lets players think about where else they can invest their time during a play session, and more fundamentally create scarcity, which adds value to the rarer commodites.
---
I’ve run without starched genes for a week now. It’s been a success so far.
---
Clearly you've never gone hunting. Trust me, if you don't go with a .50 cal mounted on the back of your pickup truck and at least 30,000 rounds, you're going home hungry.
---
Super glad I did all of those trying to grind out for something a few weeks ago.  That would have been ridiculous trying to do the melee ones on my build with a net -6 STR.
---
Misc, with other flags on flagpoles
---
Holding onto 50k 5mm to feed my ffr minigun
---
Thank god I wasn’t doing anything important lol
---
I feel like every mob in the game has that 'piercing gaze' that the mobs in Daily Ops has now.
---
If you’re on pc I’ll just give you like 10k 50 cal ammo. It’s so easy to make that I usually make like 40k at a time.
---
I'm shocked as well. But I appreciated he didn't request 50 legacies or something ridiculous. His offer was totally fine.
---
Do you use a particular lense? I've tried doing this after seeing it suggested in the past but it doesn't really work for me.
---
I then my enemies into body parts, and then it explodes. I much prefer and autoloot option, at least for legendaries.
---
Shiiiit, that was me to somebody else. Rolled up on a camp with 22k, I had 24k caps, didn't want to bankrupt myself so I bought 12k and change.
---
My preferred dumping grounds is the overseer's cache in her camp next to the wayward.
---
Plans, ammo, meds, etc all go in there till it's out of space.
---
Its a flag on a pole not a wall flag. As others have said its under misc with any other flags on poles you may have unlocked
---
No joke, oh my god. 5 Yao Gauis? Not a problem. One radtoad? Dead in one hit.
---
It’s a good gun. High DPS. I prefer faster fire because bosses shrug off explosions.
---
I’m guessing you haven’t checked this subreddit since the update. I know a lot of people “don’t have time to read the patch notes” but it explained everything there. You can also go on YouTube and so many people break down as simple as possible what’s new in each update. 
---
Damage has been nerfed. For everything, Melee, Guns, Bows. So if your bow used to do 300+ damage, chances are it doesn’t do nearly as much anymore.  Like I said, that’s for everything. Your weapons do less damage, and enemies will now do more damage to you. 
---
Enemies now scale to your level. Meaning you won’t bump into level 5 enemies anymore. 
---
Honestly just google the patch notes and read them. It will keep you up to date.
---
This. I do a weight-script comparison that gets rid of the highest weight items with the lowest script first. It was **substantially** worse when Mumbles had her 50% sale.
---
I’m a bloodie melee build so I don’t have those problems hahaaaa suckerssss
---
I don’t owe anyone,or anything, jack shit just because I played enough to have a big number.
---
Take the entitlement elsewhere.
---
Even before one wasteland, their lasers dealt a lot of damage at high levels. Now they're a genuine threat. Honestly a bigger threat than raiders or scorched. At least the cultists have flamers which can mess you up, and blood eagles have those auto lasers. Raiders/settlers have nothing, and scorched were a joke since the game launched
---
If I remember the data mined info correctly the drop rate is only 0.25%. It is one of the rarest outfits in the game
---
I mean I have several level 500 characters all with many legacies so his request was normal since I have never heard of it or seen it I hoped on his offer immediately glitched or not I'm interested in new stuff that's what I trade for which is few and far between these days.
---
Very much this. The effect on my ammo inventory is easily mitigated by spreading out my activities a bit more. What I miss is walking around and when something pops up in the right area - one shot - and again and again. Peaceful, tranquil, stress-free murder. 
---
Now, every single enemy equates to a bullet storm. The peaks and valleys are gone and they've left us this mess that just desensitizes. There's no calm recovery. It's just rage all over and it's very boring.
---
Ops is too easy enemyvise imo , its a joke . But to find those fucking signal things and get em in time is where the real challenge is
---
I only do daily ops once a day. Unless I have to do it again whenever gf or my friend ask for help. 
---
Once you reach elder, you’re done for the day, since you won’t get any more chances for rare rewards. 
---
So no point in joining a special ops event for joining the event itself after that. 
---
Sure you could do it for the xp and ammo. But you’re better off just doing something else.
---
Probably idling for free event clears.
---
\+1 for this. I use it to get an approximate idea of costs without turning to any of the numerous marketplaces or posting in the Xbox LFG. It's not perfect, but it works well.
---
Thanks thought it was on wall driving me crazy
---
Because everyone sprints in this game whenever they are moving.
---
Don't you know you are supposed to wait 30min after eating before you do any exercise?
---
You can buy up to 3 lunchboxes per day for 100 bullion each. It's a great way to keep from hitting the max if you've run out of plans to buy, or just want to level up faster.
---
I'm at a bit over 4k bullion and can't really see myself using anything else available, so I cash in 20 notes and buy at least 2 each day. Popping them at an event almost always guarantees someone else ineligible 1 or more as well, so your investment can yield up to 100% bonus xp for an hour.
---
I've experienced similar issues as well as plenty more since the recent patch.
---
My flamer either obliterates my enemies or heals them. But thats ok, I have vats... oh nvm, 95% accuracy = miss 5 shots.
---
That's ok, I'll reload and use this vats crit ive been saving.... oh...*miss*... well atleast I have time to shoot and hit one of these mobs before... nope nvm... Mr tryhard lol 900 is one shotting everything including 3 star legendaries... well. Time for bed.
---
I've done a daily op with just one other person, a lvl 12 with a hunting rifle.
---
We finished in a little over 6mins.
---
With the level scaling, it's equally hard for everyone, just that higher levels have more stuff to throw around. (actually, he revived me once cause I forgot to watch my health and went down)
---
Is that why one guy is spinning in circles?
---
Well that explains my side cramps.
---
Wasn't there a legendary spoon in Morrowwind?
---
On the subject of camera's, if you are a NW bush working, use photomode while pretending to be a bush to get a drop on players coming you're way

Depending on the ammo type, it can vary a bit. I've noticed ballistic ammo tends to be rather low. I'd also like to bring up that once the boss dies, you'll typically get 200\~400 ammo of whatever weapon you're holding(from my experience) except missiles, mini-nukes, and cores(which will give you a few rounds of a random ammo type)
---
Lmao yeah shit sucks, on my quest for another
---
Fusion cores and plasma cores don’t drop either
---
I had a had habbit of joining opts teams to get the free fast travel to their vendor. One day the leader messaged me asking if I was coming (I was browsing a vendor). They were all in waiting for me, so I jumped in and did the op because I realized I was being incredibly rude. 
---
I no longer join ops teams if I don't actually intend to do the op.
---
My unarmed bloodied build has not been changed or modified in the slightest. Instead of killing things in one punch, now it takes two, at most 3. 
---
Enemies are still easy to kill. And with the right weapons and armor you won’t die as easily as people keep complaints about. 
---
In my opinion unarmed Bloodied is still pretty powerful. People are just mad that their weapon no longer does 1,800 damage. But I promise you my gauntlet that does 300 something damage still kills just as easily.
---
Just keep in mind that different platform has a different economy.
---
Like the disclaimers say, use it to get an idea of how good it is.
---
dont tell him
---
Welcome to the performance struggle, you missed the past 20 years.
---
Bethesda modernizing the engine since Morrowind for every new title, but always years behind. What you experiencing is massive CPU limit.
---
You might be able to improve things with ini tweaks, but you not going to solve it.
---
Takes awhile for battle pass and atom shop to load sometimes
---
 It’s as simple as dropping it in my inventory next to all the missiles. They have a system in place they do won’t do it
---
&gt;Legendary modules
---
How? The Daily Ops are ammo and stimpacks farm, got unlimited shotgun and 5.56 ammo thanks to them.
---
they aren't as bad as the super mutant firestarter
---
I think the original was better than all 3 personally I just want that back.
---
I was whacking stuff with a 1\* bloody grognak axe today for fun, was killing in 2 hits most of the time.
---
Was doing this in PA.
---
I mostly use vats with my plasma caster. Thing has great ap economy
---
when this happens try a new server, should help unless this is some kinda xbox thing.
---
Right, thats how it works for us. But my question is what happens when they fight eachother?
---
Ah, yeah, fair enough
---
&gt;actually, he revived me once
---
I hope you thanked him appropriately. 😂
---
Around the same drop rate as the tattered field jacket and Red Nurse Uniform. Its one of the rarest drops. You probably arent likely to get another any time soon
---
Go into a nuke zone and start looking for enemies
---
And Vault Steel if you plan on crafting the armors.
---
Seriously. Level 3 Sneak perk and I'm seen 20 yards away by a level 4 fucking molerat when 2 seconds before I walked right in front of a level 50 super mutant? Bullshit.
---
Events often times have glowing enemies. Prime cuts in the ash heap did it for me.
---
Idk if its just me or what but i love to do pvp i fought 4 people today and 3 out of 4 had legacy gatling plasmas i thought these were rare i guess not cause 75% chance to fight someone with one of these isnt rare and the biggest problem is that you have to have a explosive gatlin plasma just to counter it its bullshit
---
I had to click enter a couple of times before it would give me choices.
---
Thanks for all the advice everyone. Dope community, excited to get more involved in the game
---
best I could do while being shot at was throw a heart emote.
---
While it did suck to see them as evil, it kinda makes sense. 
---
Arthur being a Maxson must have thought he needed to live up to his family line, and began to take things too seriously and too far.
---
 To me though, Arthur Maxson is no different than a kid who obsesses over law enforcement/military and goes into it with a predetermined ideology of violent law &amp; order. It helps me understand his motives a little more.
---
Nope
---
I have a quad explosive handmade as well, it’s amazing.... except that even with rank 5 gunsmith it’ll break after only a handful of events. Prepare to repair it at least once a play session lol
---
Morgantown Highschool. Outside there’s always ghouls. It was nice. Now? Not worth the ammo
---
I see through the lies of the responders!
---
Occasionally you can see the other player’s custom weapon when you start a trade. 
---
I only had one weapon and it was my bloodied double barrel which I labeled “This is my BOOMstick”
---
And when I traded with gf she laughed and said it was funny I named my gun that. 
---
Tested it out myself with her and a few attempts I was able to see her custom named weapons.
---
Mini nukes
---
Yeah, the idea is based on Ocelot, albeit heavily. The character's name is Adam Jesse Hauser. So I'll use two revolvers and switch to the second when the first is empty. (Curse you no dual-wielding!) So pre-war federal agent, then vault 76, then immortal secret service agent. I can also see your point on the aged immortal thing.
---
Never complained about it mate, just annoyed by it and making others aware of how this new bug was working. If I got upset about a few caps and some junk I would walk away from the game.  
---
Anyways enjoy your toxicity hope you get your jollys off fucking with someone else.  
---
P.s. (You forgot the comma after "all", the period after "you", with capitalization of "You're".) ✌😁
---
*Laughs in upto 1260 ammo per craft*  gatling gun users have never needed to farm ammo more than once a year. I have somehow gained 8k 5mm ammo in the last few weeks without crafting any
---
By the pumpkins house, there’s a cave that always has a deathclaw in it. I went in that area and a sheepsquatch started attacking me. Then the deathclaw joined in, us 3 fighting and the Grahm shows up and starts fighting too.
---
Easy, go to Blackwater Mine IIRC because there are tons of Glowing Mole Miners there guaranteed.
---
The mutant hounds at Wes Tek are usually glowing.
---
That was some fancy shooting. You're pretty good. If the purveyor is kind to me. (She usually isn't)
---
The only thing I hope is that the Raiders/Settlers have their own quests that has some sort of interaction to the BoS.
---
Like maybe pilfering the BoS's stuff.
---
You still get the scrip. There's a visual bug where it doesn't always pop up the rewards on screen, but if you check your scrip before donating and then check again afterwards you'll see that you're getting 5 scrip per donation.
---
i go there but when i kill them nothing happens
---
None of this. Fallout first gives you no weight limit or like a lot more, that’s why. They just wanna sell subscriptions
---
This entire thing fits r/PrequelMemes
---
Always expect the unexpected
---
Two people at the uplink is more than enough. Gf and I get elder every single time. Four people would obviously speed it up a lot faster. But it’s definitely not required.
---
Have you seen this lighter recently? I checked and couldn't find it even on my private server. Stuff online says it's west of Charlie next to the cart filled with Mr. Handy fuel but I can't for the life of me see anything on the ground there.
---
My rule of thumb is Daily Ops team for Daily Ops and Casual for everything else.
---
If I’ve made the team I generally wait till there’s at least 3 people and I like getting the bond formed before running it, but that’s not fool proof. My average run time with 2 people is a little over 6 mins, and I’m never sure how long it takes the bond to form hence the waiting.
---
Generally if I’m lead, after the event I either change the team to casual if I’m staying online or exit the game.
---
On PC, so can’t communicate but it seems to work so far.
---
It's like you don't even know who Chally is.
---
Fix it good is for armor or power armor. The perk to fix weapons is called weapon artisan.
---
Do you know if there is a meat week event that drops acid?
---
Oh I didn't really keep good track so I just thought I wasn't getting anything
---
tomorrow i might be able to help out if you want some ammo
---
What weapon are you using? Some weapons are more quiet than others.
---
Get this to the front page, this is unacceptable and until that Tender is forward facing the game is unplayable!!!
---
It happened to me before i just need to pop it open and clean it and everything went back to normal
---
FIY You can actually buy 9 lunchboxes per server and if you server hop you can buy 9 more.
---
expect atleast three legacies when trading
---
I use it, also Class Freak makes it such a small loss that it’s not even noticeable.
---
Uranium Fever bag em and tag em
---
Instigating explosive lever with a suppressor
---
With bandolier 2 I have

57,738 of shotgun shells

---
True. 2 words and a symbol. :D
---
What amml do you need i can gove you some if  have that type
---
I swear I don't ever remember hearing the animated cards were going to be worth more
---
You sound like the kid in high school who is still salty about not making the football team. It doesn’t matter if you win by an inch, or if you win by a mile, or who you win against. Winning is winning. You just sound like a beta cuck.
---
Not sure if you’re aware, but Daily Ops isn’t account wide. If you have multiple characters, you can run to get Elder rewards once on each character daily.
---
Don’t use stimpaks in daily ops bro, just respawn. stack up on stimpaks when you play daily ops, only use things when they’re really necessary and for ammo you can run daily ops also
---
Any of the Mirelurks around the perimeter of the pioneers count camp lake count
---
I usually did this but I know before the update, it was level dependent one what type of mole miner spawned. As long as you were around or above level 50 or so, you would get glowing mole miners. I'm not sure if that's still the case.
---
There's three of us and when we do Ops we wait at the entrance for ANYONE else to join. High level, low level, just gimme a warm body to prop up against the booster and I'm good! Everyone contributes to the boost even if they aren't shooting!
---
its also a great way to afk the event and still contribute :)
---
You playing right now? I can definitely help you out bro, I’m on Xbox also. GT cozyxhugo
---
i would say so, yes, just use class freak
---
This is the attitude to have
---
I missed something didn't I.
---
I was thinking this to. The roofs are so limited.
---
As mentioned before, the right buyer would trade a legacy for this gun. Most legacy weapons have been heavily duplicated through glitches, this weapon has not... increasing it’s value.
---
From what I heard go to fort defiance. But the outfits are always random, and may not always be there if somebody else has already searched the place. You’ll just have to server hop plenty of times. You might get lucky and find it within 10 minutes, or you could be there for more than an hour.
---
Lost a 3 star legendary today in a bush. Looked in the bush it was in and all over. Found nothing
---
Power Armor, Big Gun, Radiation Poisoning- all you need to know.
---
I love one wasteland, minus the fact that the enemy health and damage goes up too fast over level 100.
---
The durability is pretty trash but I mean it's level 5 so to be expected. The damage is unreal even for being a TSE basically, 423 damage with the right perks so pretty much one shotting everything aside from scorched beasts and bohemaths. I like this kind of stuff not double ammo legacies which are worthless to me since a quad explosive is twice a good and I'm not the biggest fan of rare outfits since they don't make killing things any better.
---
Maybe try a non explosive weapon?
---
Pretty sure in all events stealth doesn't work.
---
It’s a survival game, I say embrace the challenge.
---
Next Fasnacht should be interesting. I can face tank a sheepsquatch, but radtoads have me chugging stimpacks.
---
Yeah for real! Hopefully you save your Word.doc!
---
Yeah it’s like -12 ap with class freak or something small
---
Was just thinking about it yesterday
---
Brilliant, but I totally would have picked something Derringer Tom. Joking! Mostly.
---
Also, don't be afraid to have a character who didn't come from Vault 76. The Wastelanders update made it very feasible to be either someone who returned to Appalachia or came from elsewhere (say, Washington, D.C., with Paige). You'd be looking at any time after 23 October 2103 to arrive in West Virginia, which is when Wastelanders cannonically begins. You can treat the 76 storyline simply as a game mechanic and have the benefit of not looking like a slacker who somehow slept through Reclamation Day ***for an entire year***.
---
There are so many dead vault dwellers in the game that you could easily justify having taken a Pip-Boy from one of them -- and it adroitly avoid any of the weird roleplay that you might get by interacting with a fellow 76er who you don't recognize.
---
And my pleasure with the subreddit! I've only been around for a couple of weeks, but the community already helped me find some folk with whom to RP. And I'm exceedingly grateful for that.
---
This could happen to any of us one day. Many people was already falsly banned. OP just got lucky his post was liked and noticed by Bethesda. Usually Beth just flip players off with something like "All bans are final" and also people in this sub usually biased as fuck. They gonna dislike those kind of posts to oblivion and gonna laugh at someone who got banned without knowing any details. Heck even in this post you can find "get fucked cheater" anwsers...
---
It's the mole rats. For whatever reason, mole rats and radscorpions have pretty crazy detection abilities, possibly to do with the burrow AI behaviors. If there are mole rats, chances are you're gonna be in [DANGER] a lot. Has been like that for a long time.
---
Numbers 92 and 95 look similar. So do 800 and 500. I think you maybe just didn’t remember correctly. Are you over 18? Is there a new legal plant in your state/country?
---
Hes a what!? Can you say that again but a bit louder I couldn't hear!
---
This is happening to me too now that the event is back. Can barely get through the first wave then the game just freezes. Just annoying.
---
The one huge problem about people thinking new vegas 2 is gunna happen is that the original team that made new vegas no longer works at obsidian.
---
You may still be correct, I noticed the Platinum player icon is available for 62 days which would end Nov 23. So guess we'll have to wait and see lol
---
Who eats the meat?
---
What was that? You want another 2 handed melee skin?
---
So Piecing Gaze has trickled down into world events, damn.
---
Yea, I really love it.
---
We did this within our group of friends on a private server.  We just kept finding different ways to kill each other
---
Yea it has, my friend said it could be ment to be that way if it was closer to the frame and a .50 was shot at it and didnt pierce the armor it self the impact alone would potentially damage you, pry just bethesda being bethesda and not fixing it but it helps me to think a bit more like that when I look at it
---
The more I think about this, the more I see how legendary perks will make this viable with Follow Through.
---
First shot is 100% bonus additive, followed by 40% multiplicative. I have my new goal. Haha.
---
If you're running those perks, chances are your build isn't optimized for damage. Can you post your build so we can help tweak things?
---
Yeah it's annoying having to look through all the meat piles only to find a stalkers shovel
---
Haven't done daily ops yet, from the sound of it that's all anyone else does now...
---
If you have pleasant valley tickets, you get pre war money as part of the claim.  I redeemed 6 and had 200+ pw money to scrap
---
I made a post saying something similar about small ants taking like 5 shots from my junkie +50limbs prime crossbow and the community was toxic over me
---
Ash heap has snally gasters which always have acid
---
I didn't even know this was a thing. How do you feel about the fire breather's outfit? It's a lot easier to get thanks to a simple glitch
---
My only problem with the Daily Ops is that my sense of direction is shit.  I lost probably a good minute and a half to two minutes from just getting lost and backtracking to find the right area.
---
My high agility PA Heavy gunner can sneak just fine around most mobs until I shoot (No Joke). Sneak at Primal Cuts events on my stealth commando does not work well or at all. The last Meat Week I even had [Danger] status after traveling back to camp from a Primal Cuts it only went away after a relog
---
I mean I think Microsoft are better than Zenimax (just a bunch of old guys that see it as a money wheel and little else) but don't go into this thinking Microsoft did this for any other reason than they saw a profit down the line, I suspect they will be a little better, but they aren't going to shy away from profits over quality
---
Top of the hour and if pc servers are similar to PS4 then it has only been lasting about 3 mins or less.
---
It a very rare drop from forest and toxic valley events. It took me over a year running those events to get the drop, some get it on their first day, it's random and rare.  
---
The only other way is to buy it from someone who has one and is willing to sell.
---
Drink tasty glowing blood packs instead.
---
Protip: The label actually says No.1 Food, but most people misread it ;)
---
That's some train dedication
---
It's 2% 10% 80% for a total of a 92% chance of 1 reward 9.6% chance of 2 rewards and a 0.16% chance of 3 rewards and only takes 8 minutes of your time and completes a daily challenge
---
Instead you'd rather grind it for a week with a 40% chance of 1 reward so you can run out of rewards to earn after a week
---
For every experience like this there are 100 that are left untold. Thank you for sharing!
---
I'm confident you will pay it forward at some point in the future :)
---
Hmmm let time it would pop up for an event. Is it doing that still or do you need to watch it?
---
For me regular bow skins work on compound bow
---
So, like this post, complaining about the lack of instructions while lacking instructions....
---
You probably have anther 20-30 lvls before you really feel strong and it's not a grind to get stims. And you are just getting to the max lvl for guns so that will start to help
---
Mr pebbles helmet skin + astronaut power armor
---
It sounds to me like you're just not doing enough damage. Having survivability is great and all, but Offense can sometimes be the best defense. More damage = less bullets consume and less hits taken = more stims and ammo.
---
What have you been using for a weapon, and have you invested in any damage modifying perks?
---
The bloodied melee guy I watched the other day kept dying lol
---
oh, that makes sense. Thanks
---
Mole rats and rad scorpions auto detect you.
---
I did Manhunt every time I saw it up for a few weeks. Well over 100 completions. Ended up getting two.
---
Bloodied for damage.  Probably 25% ffr, and 25% less action point cost in vats, that's my opinion.
---
“Never complained”  the title is literally you complaining 😭😭try again goofy
---
I still can't get over the... T60 is it? The one that's the only one in nuclear winter, having this bizarre bend whenever you look down in 3rd person. It's supposed to be metal armor but the back just stretches its bizarre
---
BoS top tier commando gun for bullion.  I’ll bet on it.
---
The b/25/25 fixer (yes I have one) needs to be made slightly obsolete, because they’ve been duped to hell and back.
---
Really? I bought 3 at Foundation the first day and then FT'd to the vault and they didn't have any. I didn't think to server hop.
---
That said, 2-3 per day is usually enough for me given the amount of time I have to play most nights, but that's good to know.
---
I don't like sand
---
True. If a game releases you from that pressure then I understand. Funny enough, when this Covid thing started is when I started playing fo76 and I didn’t enter a public server for months. I was trapped in the house with my family all day and that big empty wasteland was very relaxing.
---
Just level a trash card up then scrap the leveled card
---
If you've spent all your points it means you need to level up twice but that how things be some time
---
After a while you know which ones are more rare. On PS, for example, I've come to notice that legacy flamers seem to be a lot more rare than other legacy heavies.
---
Someone made a post looking heaven and earth for a ghoul slayers explosive laser, also PS4, Ive never seen one advertised in all my time. 
---
I dont think you'll find a database of this info. The info is there though, Reddit's search is a lifesaver. You'll be able to find whether those items exist :)
---
Pretty sure it's just one stars.
---
What sucks is when you play a different game and you wonder why you can't jump high anymore.
---
Well I have bought 9 lunchboxes on the same server from all the bullion vendors and 20 minutes later I bought 3 again on my private server.
---
Yeah, I believe it was only 1-stars for the last meat week as well.
---
Heaven weapons have the god mode legendary ap refresh tho
---
Internet aggressive, but a valid suggestion.
---
Peace is a lie. There is only Passion.
---
Well aint that a cunts uncle, now I know
---
I was so looking forward to this train set, if I use it I’ll have to look away now. This NEEDS fixing.
---
These comments are all so mysterious
---
Fireproof Perk, unless they nerfed it
---
I've not had much of a problem with the nerf.
---
Do a hardcore vampire role playing character where you have to wait until it’s dark to become deadly. You’ll have to find something to do other than sleeping in a coffin during the day... Maybe wear Power Armor when it’s light out to protect yourself from the sun.
---
Ch-Chally?
---
With little to do in the way of content, helping out lower lev players has become one of the more fun things I get to do at this point! Always love dropping some rare stuff and tons of aid. And let’s be honest.....I really need to get rid of some weight 😂
---
It's good that you mention this, because most of the animals that were launched into space during the 20th century died during testing or were not in retrievable spacecraft. Laika -- who Mr. Pebbles replaces in the Fallout timeline -- supposedly asphyxiated (though, as I recall, it was eventually revealed that she died within hours of launch due to overheating).
---
having skull and cross bones on the compass would be wonderful for this issue
---
I knew this looked too good...
---
So you raise the steaks?
---
I get lost in there every single time. Always going from Alpha to Bravo.
---
I got a Fancy pump action shotgun on my 2nd ticket. Hung it on my wall for now but if anyone wants it let me know. PS4.
---
Idk about all grenades
---
It’s an event every hour
---
I mean yeah but I don't think there's be too much extra work if it loads the Vault and let's you run around before finding a server? You'd have to load again maybe but since the same map is already loaded it *should* cut loading times as it just has to figure out what's happening in this one
---
Or maybe it's more complicated than that but with how often it takes for me to find a match I think double loading would be fine even if its a full load both times
---
It’s strange how they went with a completely different weapon to stand in for the Service Rifle, but I do like the wooden furniture on that one!
---
Once 10 hit it showed up but once I was already there. It didn’t show up on the map.
---
It only has 1 receiver, 1 stock and 1 barrel
---
I'd just be happy if a lunchbox effect would be to add those little placeable balloons to every corpse or pile for an hour.
---
Call it "99 Lootballoons" or something.
---
Through passion I gain strength.
---
I'm imagining Ward as Boomhauer,
---
I just don't like molerats at any level. In fact the weaker they are the more annoying they can be because if you take your time to kill them it's not worth it XP wise but if you ignore them they'll follow you to hell and back while occasionally hitting you.
---
Should be every hour on the hour. I have not yet seen the event *not* pop up. There is a 2 minute prep period and at :02 after the hour the event starts. It typically ends very quickly after that with a handful of people contributing.
---
Yum, more rad ant lager to be brewed (carry a bottle for those just can't  leave it behind moments)!
---
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THE CHISEN ONE ANAKIN! YOU WERE KEANT TO BRING BALANCE TO THE FORCE, NOT DESTROY IT!
---
Uuh I was wondering why there was a full casual team in daily Ops yesterday
---
I half want a master crafter legendary perk so I don't need the massive amount of crafting perks in INT (the energy weapons perk cards are particularly annoying)
---
I say half because I would totally get some heavy FOMO having 3 QoL legendary perks when I know I could've spent that on more stats. But also fuck the science tree.
---
Low levels are always welcome, gotta figure it out sometime. If you follow the objectives, you are helping alot. That same team wouldn't have been able to get under like 7min or so, without a fourth to speed up the timers👍
---
This person is on the right track
---
Radiation rumble. ALL enemies are glowing lol
---
You don’t have to do every challenge...
---
That sounds fun as might give it a go
---
It happens in non events too. Say you see 3 mole rats and pew pew you kill 2 and the third one burrows, it'll auto detect you and you'll see [Danger].
---
I also see this happen in the event "uranium fever" when the supervisors spawn and oddly enough in the event "line in the sand" if you solo it.
---
Berserker Commando.
---
Ok. Thanks! I have been seeing a lot of those posts/comments but I don't care about one shotting everything. I was just wondering if the meta was still the same
---
Use class freak. Then yeah, I use it on my vats build
---
Oh for real bro thank you!!! I managed to get 2 or 3 recently 
---
Also, do the Nuke card thing I think that also gives you pre war money
---
You gotta follow your heart, your soul will tell you when you find it
---
What would I have to do for that one
---
Will try this and let you know if that works. Thanks for suggestion.
---
Get most mutations and run starched genes + class freak. The combined effects in combination with CF weakening their debuffs is super helpful
---
I logged in for the first time since the patch, fought off about 13 level 60 radscorpions and then a level 100 legendary Sheepsquatch, then its like "a difficult enemy approaches" then another Sheepsquatch appears. Was fun
---
Show off, gg tho I got nothing except BoS spec ops suit and reactor plans which I sold. I hated them
---
No unfortunately I missed that period so I am stuck on Bethesda launcher.
---
I don’t have doors. Problem solved. 
---
(I, too, fail to understand why this s a pet peeve for some)
---
Sho you think everyone that buys a lotto ticket should win something. After all, everyone puts in effort by buying a ticket.
---
Before the current season is over everyone will have every daily OPs reward anyways
---
Level 49? Grind out some Daily Ops. Doesn't matter if you're alone, then you just have as much time as you want to farm. They drop tons of stims and ammo of the gun you're using. It's absurd how efficient it is.
---
You got ROASTED
---
I run the polar opposite (Vanguard, vampire boxing glove FFS +1S, solar scout armor). Hardly ever even start losing health when combined with the radiation legendary perk. Take one for the team is also super useful since you'd standing right in front of most things. Plus, exploding palm perk is awesome to boot. Short way of saying if you want to survive as unarmed you might have to sacrifice your unyielding buffs and go full health.
---
Through strength I gain power.
---
When my group gets bored enough we compete to get the highest wanted level or who stays alive the longest. Funny if you have a high wanted level more people usually leave you alone, they think you're griefer.
---
So basically fallout Steve
---
Berserker full auto rifle, I use a handmade and a fixer. 
---
Be as close to 0 damage resistance as possible. 
---
Use as many incoming damage reduction perks as you can fit in the build without taking any perks that up your damage resistance. 
---
It's a full health build without chems. Mutations are fine, even the grounded mutation is ok to use. 
---
I keep a level 1 mule to scrip bad legendaries and roll 3* armor. Level 1 armor is easiest to break. You can keep wearing it after it's broken and still get the legendary effects from the armor. 
---
There's more, but that's the general idea. 
---
It's a blast.
---
You beautiful bastard
---
Through power I gain victory.
---
Free XP my guy what's to hate.
---
Probably already mentioned, but just joina team Daily Ops with the weapon you want ammo for.
---
Take a few shots here and there, you don't have to kill anything at all. You're already helping with the pylons time. After it ends no matter on time or what you killed you still are awarded hundreds of ammo.
---
Dude just do collision course event one time.
---
This makes alot of sense, kept getting killed at events.
---
Does it still work with passive on? Cause that's the only fix I can think of besides unequpping it. And I really don't as its such a good boost
---
As someone who likes carpentry, I am triggered by the fireplace secret door hinges being on the side of the door that opens.
---
I saw it pop up at 10pm on the dot! Thanks, last time it popped up but I guess not now...
---
Today I finally accidentally got myself wanted with MI and it took ages for anyone to kill me. I was so confused and wondered if they thought I was some asshole who'd bait for pvp. All I wanted was to keep being able to carry all my scrap lmao.
---
I should be on around 1-2 eastern, then. IGN Aylaine. :)
---
Question, would it be better to wait to start the Ops when the bond has been formed between everyone for max exp or is it preferred to just start the Ops immediately when the team is full and let the bond form during?
---
This is an important and valuable question
---
Wonder what would steer them in such a direction.
---
You the real mvp
---
From what I've heard, turning on passive mode should work. I've seen this topic come up a few times in the last week.
---
You need Revenant, Mysterious Savior, Born Survivor, Dodgy, Adamantium Skeleton and Serendipity Perks.
---
Full set of [BROKEN] Life Saving armor. Each piece gives you a 50% chance to revive yourself, so with 5 pieces you get 5 chances to a 50/50 shot to self revive. If it is broken, you don't receive DR from armor but you do keep legendary effects.
---
You can Run and Gun, but you will go down a lot, OR you can go down once, get the 50% boost for 2 minutes, sneak kill, go down when 2 minutes are up and do it over again.
---
Remember there is a cool down for Life Saving, so Mysterious Savior is there as insurance when you have the cool down as Mysterious Savior does not have a cool down.
---
Have fun comrade.
---
It seems if you keep pacifist on you're safe, we tried multiple time
---
Something something something dark side, something something something complete.
---
When I get wanted by accident I show up at someone's camp take off all my armor put away my gun and emote until someone shoots me.
---
Well looks like I'm going passive for a bit. Not that big of a deal honestly
---
I really want Scorched Sierra Power Armor from Fallout: New Vegas' Lonesome Road.
---
Spend them on legendary modules whenever you need to make some space for more. You won't necessarily need them but they're used for so many things that you'll most likely be happy to have in the future, including the most straight forward top-tier armor set.
---
Did you watch the turtle video? Had no idea
---
That's a top (or very near it) DPS weapon for a rifle build.
---
Yeah I miss one shotting low level enemies fuckin sucks that I have to fight for my life everywhere I go which yeah I guess it's the wasteland but fuck half the people here can 1 shot most things cause of bloodied builds but I like my sneaky rifle build
---
I attribute it to a lack of communication and the transient nature of servers. Unless you're with a group of friends or reach out to others through third-party platforms (Reddit, Discord, what have you), it's hard to coordinate these kinds of things. There's no regular community when joining a map.
---
I predominately play on Xbox, and I very rarely see people who have mics.
---
I never got it. That’s why I’m asking. Knowing this sub I’m probably gonna get downvoted for asking this but what’s this glitch you’re talking of?
---
Just tried to run this, twice in a row I had to abandon it because I was left fighting single handed while a high level player buggered off miles from the uplink looted stuff. There was no way I could take down the final enemies single handed so I had abandon &amp; jump server each time
---
I cant wait, I got a space suit I've been drying to get on
---
Through victory, my chains are broken.
---
Yeah i do, and i also ignore it, but if youre going to do a Daily Op its worth looking out to see if anyone else is doing them aswell.
---
I hear you oal... I made a post suggesting certain levels don't make sense for certain enemies and my karma is still recovering XD
---
Some Bethesda fanboys can't stand criticism
---
I mean the faction rep for Gauss shotguns is such a grind I wouldn't recommend preparing for those that early. If they like unarmed then maybe prepare for the gauntlet since it's low rep but otherwise the ss set is a more immediate usage
---
The force shall free me.
---
couldn't you spend 5 minutes on a new character?
---
I always run passive. The amount of times I accidentally shoot someone is pretty high.
---
If you're below level 45, definitely look into using melee weapons until you get your hands on a good gun. That'll help with the ammo issue.
---
You can still casually stroll through an one shot them though.
---
I kind of thought it already double loaded with selecting maps. I would call it voting but I can count on one hand the number of times flatwoods is actually been selected.
---
As for finding a server, that could very easily act the same way the normal servers work and which somebody requests one it creates it and then just begins populating it with other requests after that. If it's taking 5 to 10 minutes to count how many people are in each server in order to choose which one you should be in, I think they need to hire a different high schooler to write their search algorithm then.
---
That was my problem. I wasn't naked....
---
I use Serendipity, I don't use the other ones you mentioned. 
---
I'm running Blocker, Field Surgeon, Tenderizer, First Aid, Covert Operative, Sneak, Escape Artist, Action Boy, Adrenaline, Ricochet, and Bloody Mess along with all maxed commando cards, tank killer, and ground pounder. 
---
I don't have any Life Saving armor at the moment. 1 Chameleon, 1 cloaking, 2 Unyielding, and a troubleshooters for the other perks. 
---
I rarely die and am still clearing out West Tek with ease. 
---
Not looking to argue, just comparing ideas.
---
They should just come up with a torso mod that allows you to wear a backpack. Granted, you'd have to choose between that and any of the other torso mods, but seems like a fair choice
---
&gt; Funny if you have a high wanted level more people usually leave you alone, they think you're griefer. 
---
I ran into this problem just last week. There's a workshop near my CAMP, and I regularly claim it. The map showed that it was unclaimed, and I gleefully lockpicked doors at the site while picking off mobs so that I could get that XP. My bounty silently kept increasing until the game finally seemed to realize that it **was**, in fact, claimed, at which point my wanted status popped up. 
---
I tried to get someone to kill me by the Wayfarer/Overseer's Camp, and it took a good thirty minutes until someone did so. I spent that time sitting around, crafting, giving out items to new players, and generally hoping that someone would murder my face so that I could return to my journeys in peace.
---
Bethesda has a  history of not knowing the real world.
---
If players have fallout 1st they could drop them in private server then leave. Just a suggestion😁
---
It's happened to me only once and that was when it started
---
Always happy to help... come visit me. Xbox gt:deke1691
---
I tried to lighten the mood. This guy is steaming.
---
You trading it? Lmao
---
I've seen plenty of level 200+ players not understand the mechanics of the instance. Level means nothing when people don't want to read.
---
Get Tenderiser
---
There was a vampire costume from Halloween event last year that would be perfect lol
---
While I personally subscribe to a “better together” mindset, that is to say that the more people enjoying the game and growing within the game is the best path forward, I’m not sure the onus can be solely placed on all high levels. Some rarely play the game anymore, only logging in to do dailies + op then caps/scrip, log off. Going about this as quickly as possible is the goal of many higher level people on my list I’ve noticed.  
---
I’d dislike it if my play style absolutely had to accommodate lower levels in this regard. Not because I’m selfish or make assumptions about lower levels, but because there would be no choice for people who play differently then I do or you do. There are a multitude of different players who have different reasons for playing the game. I honestly feel like the game can’t grow without them either.
---
As buggy as it is, VATS is quite strong. AP regent while in VATS would be silly for anyone with a optimized build and a 25 LVC Fixer or even Handmade.
---
But how long is night compared to day
---
I got a DE gatling laser for it, dont get lowrolled.
---
Also make the location available as a nuke target. I don't know if ATLAS is currently, I just want to be sure that I can nuke the Brotherhood in the future
---
What part of taking one for the team was unclear? 
---
Seriously, that really sucks. Kind of amusing at the same time though.
---
Responder Fireman Uniform and Fire Breathers Outfit are different but similar sets and the latter is guaranteed if you do all story quests but there's supposed to only be one.
---
If you trash your Firebreathers Outfit or want it early you can go to the Overseer's house and she has one in a display case. The hat can be looted by finding an invisible hitbox on the wall to the right of the display case and the outfit itself can be shot out of the case by tossing a grenade in the space between the case and the right wall
---
The outfit by the way. It's a lot more red than the responders version https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_Breather_uniform
---
This has been broken since FO4. LMAO.
---
Of the ones that you've mentioned:
---
* [Mr. Fuzzy Tokens](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Fuzzy_token) \- Camden Park
---
* [Pleasant Valley claim ticket](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Pleasant_Valley_claim_ticket) (I'm guessing?) - Pleasant Valley Ski Resort
---
I run a few daily. I’m also on a trade discord with an active lfg community so finding groups is easy if I do not want to solo. You could try that, or chat mod if you are in PC as many people run it there as well.
---
I noticed that last night, and am trying to suppress that traumatization as well
---
Right??? Did everything have to explode? Couldn't it has been fire damage, or acid, or cryo? Or anything other than "make the thing I killed fly across the map because fuck physics"?
---
you'd be better off making a *looking for group* post on xbox
---
I believe every "hit" causes a weapon to lose durability. Therefor, a TSE hits 4 times per shot.
---
For me the game didn't change much I had to change some weapons and, it just got more grindy, more tedious. But for my friends that's at a low level, well he stopped playing completely.
---
Pretty sure the perk cards work from 6pm-6am or something similar
---
I think a majority of the big public events give out 1 stars
---
I can definitely see it tough for new players. Even as a veteran player, leveling up a side character has been challenging.
---
For Ammo, consider this:
---
- As many have said, incorporate melee into your build
---
- get the scrounged perk to find more ammo
---
- visit player camps to buy cheap ammo, 1 cap a bullet
---
For damage, consider this:
---
- look to increase your perception and go for a sneaky rifleman build to start, but only get one rank of the rifleman series perks.
---
- get concentrated fire and do sneaky headshots to save on ammo
---
Good luck, and stay with it!
---
One Wasteland presumably is the issue here. To you, it's a level 40 Assaultron. To him it's a level 100 Assaultron Super Duper Destroyer
---
I travel to a vendor before entering the op so I can sell them right after exiting the op.
---
So. Much. This. Atkeast the first part. Loot should be automatically awarded.
---
Or, even better. We have a legendary item vendor. Why no let give us tokens for the purchase of a legendary item?
---
Then, we could even let us save up x amount of tokens to be able to pick what one of the rolls will be. Just one.
---
Do you sneak a lot?
---
You can always take other perks.
---
I think they should make a skin for the .50 Cal. Machine Gun that turns it into the Shoulder Mounted Machine Gun from Lonesome Road.  It wouldn’t be a typical skin but it would be pretty badass nonetheless.  I just can’t picture Bethesda adding an MG that shoots 10mm.
---
Honestly, nah, don't miss it lol
---
Pleasant Valley tokens under the pleasant Valley vendor.
---
Mr fuzzy tokens are at the place with the roller-coaster 
---
Tokens are handed in at the load bearing quest location entrance.
---
So ... "never", then.  (I'm not interested in Bloodied builds.)  :D
---
another option is the government air drop - i think they send you prewarmoney too
---
Mr Fuzzy tokens can be turned in in the Camden Park boss office (the shed behind the vendor bot). There is a terminal in there that you can buy things with the tokens. This is where you buy the soiled mr fuzzy costume. Its pretty expensive - 450 tokens for both costume and mask - so if you are looking for that just save them up. 
---
The Pleasant valley ones get turned in at the Bellhop bot in Pleasant Valley resort (this is downstairs from the vendor bot in the resort). However you wont get access to him until you have done the quests for Rose at the top of the world.
---
I don’t know if anyone else has noticed it or not but if you jump in PA and start falling with your arms up the right shoulder pad moves “correctly” and the left one is just completely static
---
I had some level 50 harrassing me on a new character (lvl20) and trying to trixk me into pvping. So I just rejoined the world with my lvl 140 bloodied build.... Needless to say I got a sorrg msg
---
 I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to my new C.A.M.P.
---
The new higher tiered ones use the glowing skin textures, but don't have the glowing keyword
---
Bad neighborhoods? Yes. 
---
Other places, not so much.
---
I have a Bloodied SS +1 Strength Mole Miner , with one glowing meat steak or some adrenaline, I one shot most basic enemies with no stealth.
---
Super mutant may take 1-3, Deathclaw, yao guai 1-2.
---
Scorch beast 2-4.
---
Tanky enemies is where it gets dicey. Alphas, Behemoth, Sheepsquatch, Daily Op boss can take 10+ which is a lot of time spend so close to an enemy with low health.
---
These are just what I'm noticing with my character, you results may vary.
---
Not just you. These type of events will only give 1 star legendaries.
---
Daily Ops must not be kind to you right now huh? Being squishy.
---
It's like the watchtowers in game, but smaller.
---
I have shot all of my bullets .  Where are the bullets?
---
If it is supposed to be like that I’d be cool if they put something in between the chest pieces and the frame so you didn’t have to look at the frame  because it just looks like they tried to make it look bulky by just lifting the plates off the frame
---
Wait, y'all don't play with passive on?
---
Okay.  Guess my main - level 83 - should head to a public server and join an SBQ event soonish, then.  :)
---
I dunno, ammo. Hasn't been an issue for me, gat gun, hits like a truck, so it uses minimal ammo, 2 or 3 shots most weaker stuff, on a legend or beefier mob I pull out an ultracite AA gat laz
---
I have the chemist's backpack and a small ocean of stimpaks.
---
EZ downvote.
---
Nobody is a douchebag for not wanting to play with you and your pipeguns.
---
Use class freak and mix it with bird bones ull get ur ap back
---
Power armor + Sheepsquatch Mascot head. That's it. That's the build.
---
I'd been PVPing with friends earlier.
---
Thats what I'm saying..
---
Been playing since launch and I never new this...
---
If you get one extra, let me know if you wanna sell it
---
I'd be less annoyed by it IF SHE DIDNT REPEAT IT EVERY FIVE GOD DAMNED MINUTES
---
.They use their base stats. The same numbers they used before OW, without the curve tables overriding everything.
---
Use awareness perk to check out new npc variants. They forgot to update it.
---
I got it an my second character, but I think I got it when I spoke to an npc when I went into the responders firestation, like I got the paramedic suit when I talked to the npc in flatwoods. It wasn't a quest reward, I just had them in my inventory when  after I talked to them.
---
Oops I did it again  
---
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
---
Glitched or tired of no new dialogue like in fo4?
---
And I haven't done the quest line so it's not the firebreathers, but I have that on my main character.
---
I mean...per folklore, that IS how Wendigos come to be...but still, never noticed this, and that's a neat detail!
---
Looks like ally quests can reward it too - I got mine from one of these.
---
Go inside an instanced interior (like the Wayward) and drop them in there. Everything inside is lost when you log off, and other players can't get to it.
---
Dude my brother got so cranky when I did this to him
---
lmao
---
Lmao I had that about 8 month ago,  kid was trying to start pvp at my bar, level 35, I gunned him down with a fifty cal. He joined the server in a second with his level 125 bloodied and then met my executioners gamma gun
---
I have all the Mr pebbles stuff, this is the best idea I've seen in awhile 😁
---
76 has a 10-year plan.
---
This would be so great
---
Only a synth deals in absolutes.
---
Xbox??
---
Which collectron is it? Asking for a friend
---
They don’t even make sense. Why would MOLERATS (or any of the small, only slightly mutated wildlife) get that dangerous?
---
Scorched? Maybe. Super Mutants? Sure. Cryptids? Absolutely! But molerats? 
---
They should have a level cap on certain mobs, period. Because at some point it just doesn’t make sense to be threatened by random pests.
---
That would be nice, but they'd have to gut almost the entire system to implement that.
---
Coward
---
That's why you dont be a bloodied build
---
SBQ turns into ashpiles again?
---
That is the point I was trying to make with this thread. These people who like to play solo can keep playing the exact same way on a casual team.  The only thing they accomplish by not doing so is that they miss out on XP.
---
Flatwoods double dips. Regular aliens got cut. They're in the game guide.
---
Or you do the Morgantown Airport event and get 100 from the drop crate.
---
Loo, we all know this already man. Whoever doesnt know this event exists is either new to the game or simply never went here
---
If you like dressing up your character (or just like collecting outfits), you could also trade it for some super rare outfit, like the forest camo jumpsuit. If that's your thing.
---
Its not like you're missing much xp or anything else. You can loot the corpses and meat piles anyway.
---
Display settings / Display Adapter Properties / set monitor refresh rate / change from whatever you have it to exactly 60.
---
Frames come back wow
---
I saw others suggesting this. Quickly knocked out the weekly! Thanks to you and others who have shared this info!
---
I've noticed during prime meat events that legendary enemies emit bright green vapor for like 10 seconds after they spawn. They should keep that glow forever even after you kill them.
---
I had the frozen effect stuck on my character after exiting todays daily op. Only way I could fix it was to relog.
---
It's funny that legendary initially glow green while alive. I don't see why the can't keep the glow until they are looted or have them beep like the nuke ghouls/scorched
---
Respirator mask might be a mole miners mask.
---
no offense but, who the fuck cares about 1980s games? how does it relate to what is being discussed?
---
Even with instructions, people still won't know what to do.
---
Look at Radiation Rumble, Encryptid, Project Paradise etc, and more recently the Daily Ops with Resilient enemies.
---
Even just one line of text is too much for morons to look at, so 6 bullet points wouldn't help at all. I honestly wonder how these people even manage to start the game
---
Don't scrap Ammosmith, because it actually stacks with Ammo Factory when crafting ammo.
---
Maybe stop dragging other players down? If you want to get initiate rank, just play solo or with your other BOS MaxsonxDanse simps
---
This is the problem, im not there to pull a lever for my mouse treat. I'm playing the event to kill some bad guys and have fun.
---
The approach of just ticking boxes and collecting loot, is a shit experience in my view so I get reluctant to get in the ops
---
When you’re done with the daily ops, just change your team type to casual or others.
---
It's 'working as intended' and no fix is planned. 
---
They wanted to drastically increase the time it takes to level to 50, while also decreasing the time it takes to level *after* 50. 
---
Most 'casual' players stick around until they hit 50, spending a few caps every week on the new offerings while they are playing but then have no desire for endgame grinding. Extending the time it takes to hit 50, makes them stick around a few extra weeks, thus spending more before departing.
---
While also decreasing the time it takes to level at 200+, because if you are that dedicated you are *more* likely to stick around if you feel you are still making progress in the grind. 
---
It sucks, but from a business standpoint I don't see them adjusting it any time soon.
---
As it is with most things in fallout 76
---
Lol, the lowest I've gotten is Paladin from my first ever match.
---
Sorry for wanting a fun experience out of my game. If your there to press that lever for treats then I guess that's on you.
---
Its new with the update
---
Yes we could, but how many unarmed/melee perks are there? The extra specials don't count since they are universal utility for all builds. Explosions are helpful for fighting mobs and people who like to min/max will need to take those explosion perks to do so. People really aren't asking for much just a little visual effect to make finding them easier like they have with the nuclear codes
---
It's because that Hawaiian music is just too good.
---
So far, we've been able to kill every interactable radio host in fallout. They wouldn't add her in without giving us the option of getting her killed. They wouldn't give us that option because it requires a huge amount of voice acting and causes issues for "shared experience". Also, if the intermissions are off by a second or two the songs will be desynced for everyone. Some autistic players like to sing along with the radio and it would be a lot more annoying if they're singing to a completely different song than what is playing.
---
Try going a month without having radio on. Turn it back on for one play session a week after that.
---
I don't think those are wearable by players. Might be the mask of the Raider Pathfinder Outfit though, but I've seen them around lately and I don't think I've seen that set in the shop? Maybe just coincidence and coming across a handful of players with the same old purchases
---
Was that new with the update? I could have sworn a friend found a legendary corpse and pointed it out to me
---
I don't like level 100 anything...or level 50 anything...seriously this last patch was such a fuck up. The game is too hard now. I'm a level 155 and it is not fun to play this game. :/
---
Heavy guns AP cost is fucking insane. Completely unbalanced .
---
I agree - mini nukes, missiles, and floater grenades for all!
---
Vampire Explody Combat Shotgun ...  Just Saying
---
Tell them the icons are basically the same too. That's deceitful
---
A few months or so ago I guess was the last time I noticed it. Ill take a look next time Im on and take a pic of the spot if its there. Its really hard to spot and very easy to miss since its so tiny and on bare ground
---
It’s really up to you and what you prefer to do. If no one else has entered the ops event, then feel free to wait until bonds are fully formed. But if a teammate/s start the event, I would definitely join at that point and help out
---
If you play a stealthier build, do you automatically lose out on stealth bonus damage if you are on public team? I’m not sure how this works, sorry for my ignorance.
---
No.
---
With the rng we got in this game, my pain is your pain.
---
How about:
---
#Don't use the shitty *Enemies Exolode Upon Death* legendary perks. All they do is make finding the body impossible
---
All my legendary items are 100 caps some are good some are junk but all 100. After scripting is done everything else goes in for a 100.
---
Known bug. If the mine is already in a nuke zone and a new nuke is launched, ACP will start again. I think it happens regardless of where you launch it but I could be wrong and it could be that awakening the queen also wakes Earle
---
Humans!
---
I'm there to get 5min run and log out because it's a snoozefest with no challenge
---
How you get that title at the side of your name,been wondering that for awhile
---
I leveled up my character from scratch almost entirely on one wasteland. Sometimes I ran out of ammo on my preferred gun, sometimes I ran out of all my ammo and everything was broken, so I started hacking and slashing! Sometimes I would catch parasites and try to battle my way to the next town to catch a meal while starving to death.
---
Mostly, it was a hell of a lot of fun.
---
I made one in nukadragon what do yous think https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f533dc&amp;d=e31l32a82a12eo2la2pg2ph2pi2lt2pp2ar2an2lg2i12sg2ao0cu2po2sb1
---
Makes sense
---
Well, with reclaimed gas masks and BoS suit crap popping up all over the place I highly doubt people should be trading them as they will only become more common. I traded mine today for a 3 star minigun because I hated the new BoS suit, just doesnt look good
---
The downsides of Junkies' builds are very low especially with legendary perks &amp; mutations that boost up your special stats
---
Radium rifle is dogshit. Scrapping rate is a bug.
---
Take grounded and don't look back. Energy armor penetration is bugged anyway. Only takes base damage into account, so if you hit for 200 with a tesla, it calculates as if you had like 70 and you lose 80% of your damage for no reason anyhow.
---
Right now tse is outputting more damage than usual but it breaks a lot and isn’t accurate, so that’s why I asked which is better, junkies explosive or tse.
---
stripfoosball sound better, yes
---
Question,where yall getting them cool titles on the side of your names
---
That sub fee would be shared w/ gamepass, anyway.
---
Energy damage is a joke in this game. Well minus that assaultron death rays but a puny grounded won't save you anyways
---
Sprint only
---
They really should have taken a page from fasnacht and done a random legendary 1*-3*
---
IFf you go to the train at Harpers Ferry and jump on it you can blow it's whistle, if that doesn't cheer you up... nothing will.
---
Caps have been worthless since the dawn of time and now you want them to be worth a damn?
---
in the queen?? yes, i get only 1, and must kill arround 1500 or more queens
---
Yeah, if you're a level 200-300 guy with a optimum build I bet it's boring as fuck. You guys have practically made the game boring for yourselves. I don't see how ANYTHING in this game is fun at that stage.   
---
Hell im 140 and the game is mostly too easily, one Wasteland has been a refreshing change but honestly I am waiting for the expeditions to be a thing.  
---
Though I don't blame you guys for that. Bethesda gives you 0 reason to reroll a new character.
---
All I got was a certificate for a year's supply of Cram.
---
The arm, at least the left one, is also floating. It's so ugly looking when you sprint.
---
I'd put the cosmo skin on it, but I don't like that either, and other skins are just too expensive imo.
---
Sounds like commie talk
---
Looks good. I'd take a whack at it. 
---
Main thing I'd change is having bandolier instead of traveling pharmacy and try to get 5 points in intelligence to max out gunsmith.
---
Yes! Why else would you have them other then for ammo and junk n stuff like that
---
Well I am a liberator so. Hehehe but I mean make the economy more equal.
---
560 yeah it sucks. I've got 7 characters on 2 accounts and it is ridiculous how powerful the player character still is after these 'nerfs'.
---
OK I could do that thanks mate
---
I honestly think that if you maintained the tone that you have now, throughout this thread, probably no one would have given you a hard time about it, including me. Sometimes it's not what we say, but how we say it. 
---
I watch every one  Angry Turtle's videos &amp; streams too, and learned early on about using a team / solo even on a private server. Not as effective as having multiple team mates, but it helps. I also focus on intelligence, and lots of mutant farming. I do jump on public to form a daily OP team, when looking for Elder. I've even created public teams, mic on &amp; ended up teaching lvl 5 newcomers some basics &amp; taking them to helpful fast travel spots. 🙂
---
Im really not sure whats my problem with it. I have it maxed out since two days after the update. I saw it working only ONCE. Is there anything that can block it?
---
Were people burnt out on this event the last time or something?  I haven't seen more than 2 people show up this time.
---
You on PC or console?
---
&gt; Would it kill the Devs to add like 5 or 6 bullet points under 
---
Very possibly. It would almost certainly introduce a game breaking bug somewhere unforeseen and seemingly unrelated.
---
I'm on ps4
---
I accidentally bought the Mothman bundle(one with the torch skin for the super Sledge)from trying to log in too fast.Not only did they refund me, I also got to keep it. 
---
Though the only thing worth it in the bundle was the emote imo.
---
I was looking at the photos for the stock racks, and I noticed a gun in the last picture that I didn't recognize.  What is this skin for the camo gun on the bottom?  Or is this a new gun we don't have yet?

---
Does the game offer anywhere near enough variety for those characters to feel different though? or is it really just different card perks that technically you could interchange if you wanted?
---
I think they should open the vault in adventure mode just to explore. Then reduce the lobby time so we don't have to wait 3 minutes in the lobby.
---
You can add mutant hounds to that
---
Just leave their green mist on death and set legendaries to never turn into goo/ash/meat piles
---
Damn. I'm on Xbox.
---
I get ha, I'm saving up for that 2k for the jet back, currently at 1490, so close :O
---
And the reduction is more for accidents. If you panic boost away  down a slight slope, and you're nearly dead xD
---
They could just make a selection of pipboy mods, one to highlight all bodies, or legendaries, or autoloot, or autoloot legendaries only, etc
---
I think the main thing is that Primal Cuts was made a lot harder for characters across the board cause of One Wasteland. Less people doing primal cuts = less primal meat = less people showing up to Meat Cook events to turn in Primal Meat for Scrip
---
I was surprised we couldn't, so yes.
---
Have it maxed out since two days after the update. Actually only saved me once.
---
Nah it's a special meat cook they told us we earned, so we complain less about the lack of mischief night.
---
The best bit is I Googled it just to be sure before I posted that and it lied to me... Google actually lied 🤣
---
Damn shame thier is no crossplay
---
They did barely any work to begin w/ before launch.
---
Timmyyyy !
---
I do appreciate everyone's help thank yous
---
Agreed. If there was, I'd give you a Berserker handmade or fixer to get you started. 
---
It is a fun build. I don't think I'd be happy with a different kind of commando.
---
Yer sounds fun
---
You can become an initiate. It was found through data mining.
---
So you're probably right.
---
I did just that last night, had to run to the loo. Got back and someone was shooting at me, angry and thumbs down emoting.
---
On mobile:
---
Go to the r/fo76 front page, hit the 3 dots top right hand side, select flair, and there you go
---
Oh man subverted my expectations!
---
And to the people that camp in the back room during Uranium Fever and zap the Legendaries without giving anyone else a chance...
---
A special place in hell awaits you.
---
&gt;I'm not a sneak
---
well, you're in luck then. I think no energy rifle has a silenced option bar the gauss. but you shouldn't be going down the rifleman way anyway. actually, energy rifles in general are mostly terrible compared to their ballistic counterparts. half the armor penetration, twice as much repairs
---
fixer is great for sneaking, but a 10mm SMG or a handmade might be better if you're running and gunning. handmades have far better recoil and 5.56 is plentiful. the SMG actually has one of the highest dps. but the railway is probably your best bet, yes. problem is that the auto receiver is literally unusable outside vats.
---
some energy rifles have their niche but you need to build around them. plasma flamers are great, for example. and legacy teslas and rifles can shred, if you can afford one. but generally speaking yes, take grounded. but you may want to revise your dr/er strategy, though. resistances have diminishing returns. flat damage reduction (like dodgy) is much better, so maybe try slayer's pieces instead of bolstering or vanguard.
---
I totally agree. I always make sure to give the wave emote so others know
---
feel free to comment :)
---
Just went there and it was on the ground for me. Heres a pic of where it was. Sorry for the shitty phone pic but i couldnt find a usb stick :/
---
[Arthur Woods Lighter location](https://i.imgur.com/soom4iw.jpg)
---
Yeah that's possible.
---
Having problens with this perk, as i maxed it out almost directly after the patch and i only saw it working once. Im really not sure whats my problem here. Anyone else get this? I mean, 40% chance should be a lot.
---
Mucho gracias, i will thank you
---
Nice thanks
---
I hope this bug doesn’t get fixed. Overall I feel like there’s less people launching nukes now that daily ops came out. So 2 bosses for 1 nuke is cool.
---
same
---
Yeah I loved using 65 but I just got annoyed with the visuals and wanted to use a visually appealing armour
---
The whole thing triggers me nothing is right plus the steam engine don't even run on that side of the river it should be conrail CSX but what ever, beth fucked home all up, artist interpretation I guess.
---
This is a great idea, the hardest part of this challenge is remembering to pick up that cash.
---
I feel you
---
Yeah, getting nervous about it too. Got it maxed out and only saw it working once yet.
---
Say it isn’t so 🤦‍♂️
---
It's possible and it's fun.
---
Yes of course, it‘s no problem doing it solo. But since its part of the daily score challenge Its nice to speed it up. Last season I didnt care so much about the legendary run but this time its different, we need the free card packs for our legendary perks.
---
I see one almost every time I leave the mine after Earle, and not uncommonly elsewhere. Died twice in a four hour session to a storm popping up in different places while I was afk smoking.
---
better is subjective, it really depends on if you care about the loss of stats from addictions, if you're a heavy vats user, if you use a lot of chems, your tolerance for making lots of repairs &amp; so on.
---
I can't tell if you are joking but is not infact new. Its been like that since launch.
---
I'd also add that purchasing items from NPC vendors (as in not those that folk have at their CAMPs) will increase the amount of caps that the vendors have on hand. I'll often offload items to, say, station bots and then purchase patterns or experience gaining items (uncooked meat, chems that I can combine for new ones, bulk crafting materials, etc.) when they near 0 caps.
---
It's not a 1:1 ratio, but purchasing is an option when global vendors near that 0 cap limit.
---
Consider anti armor as well. It Is not affected by the nerf and has no downsides. Tse does more damage than junkies right now but ad you said, durability Is a big issue.  Accuracy can be managed with vats, especially if you get a less vats gun.
---
I prefer sugar bombs. More than twice the daily recommended sugar!
---
Probably the exploit with a specific throwable that does damage regardless of pacifist state. Not going to mention it to give any people who don't know ideas.
---
i wonder if you can turn a plasmarifle into a magic weapon. the normal firerate is to low, but i have heard that 2 different damage types double the firerate so for that instigating, junkies or stalker.
---
i have a instigating plamsa flamer and it does quiet much damage - idk if its magic
---
Rank 4 here, and iono man. I only saw it working properly once.  Im afraid i wasted my coins.
---
You have a chance at getting scrip when completing it any time, chance at a decent legendary, and some decent xp. Specially today, since it's super mutants.
---
really that's a new one haven't heard about this one. and I'm pretty sure only 4 ppl joined event didn't notice a 5th. but hey who knows
---
Did I miss something or what is the point of the meat you get from finishing the event? You cant even cook/prepare it.
---
Yes you are right, but they occupy a slot in the team someone could have taken who wants to participate, they could play it solo if they dont care about the op.
---
Thats how i wish it would work for me. But it doesn't on lvl4. May i ask what lvl you are using it on? Maybe the max version is broken.
---
Seems like he's going loco..
---
LOL!   Wasn't expecting that picture.
---
There really is no downside for plyaing in a public team. Only benefits. Not like you are supposed to meet me and make my acquaintance. Lone Wanderer is nothing compared to the team's bonded bonus + shared cards (unless all 3 of them are Strange in Numbers /s)
---
Thank you!
---
Trade it in for scrip at the cookout
---
I've never had an issue completing the top tier with just one friend. I don't care who comes along. Although I did once try to bring a full team of level 20s and none of them would do the objective. I got to the boss at around 8 minutes and was quite unhappy.
---
Every full hours, Grahm starts his cookout left to vault 76. You can give the meat to him when the event has started and receive scrip
---
How is it an exploit? It's made to be played multiple times a day if one wishes too.
---
I love helping newbros!
---
Recently helped a bunch of under 100s to get elder on an Op, and their Heavy mentioned that he didn't feel like he contributed much with his minigun, which was a Two-Shot 1*
---
So I gave him my old Two ShotFF/RW Primed Gat FFand a couple dozen Ultra Cores.
---
Their shotgunner was so jealous xD
---
I gave her my Fancy Shotgun from Pleasant Valley, but yea, its no TS/FF/RW Gat lase :p
---
If I'm the leader I change the group type after we're done. Not entirely ideal but you also get situations where either the leader leaves and the people in the group don't realize it or that they're still in an op group. And many of them just have no intention of doing it again.
---
The other thing you run into is people joining casual groups and then starting ops there? Not sure if they expect people to join or just want the perk buffs.
---
i really have no clue why (maybe some of you can help) but I have been exploding/set ablaze pretty much every fight i got into since last patch or so and its annoying as fuck
---
The qsb? I thought it got removed and you could only get them from MIDUS 🙄
---
Pieces, or plans?
---
Data mines says it won't be a bunch of people. I believe the number was 5.
---
I can't even remember when the last time they put something I was actually excited for on the shop. It's all lame camp shit or stuff I can't even see anyone buying. Not even hating if someone likes this stuff but damn, the past 3 weeks or maybe more have felt like the same stuff.
---
Wow now I’m triggered
---
Ive been using a non legendary auto fixer and it's been pretty effective so far. 
---
Only just replaced it with an AA version but tbh the non legendary was doing more damage than my bloodied handmade so it's worth giving consideration, just because it isn't legendary doesn't mean it isn't good
---
There's actually a pretty good reason for the liberators
---
Oh. Lol. I knew I missed something. Thx.
---
Yeah, I'm wondering if the people who are complaining about bullet sponges are using VATS? I've been killing level 50 scorched, super mutants and most other mobs in the old easy areas pretty fast or outright one-shotting them with headshots. My instigating tesla works too without the headshots, just by bouncing the lightening off the ground.
---
Yes and no. The pip boy damage of my instigating power fist vs my unstoppable monster and completely identical at 20% health. And the damage doesn't seem to be much higher in use either. Any extra damage coming from the unstoppable monster is replaced by the first hit of an instigating weapon with adrenal reaction. This is just my experience but I don't know if it's even getting a bonus from both bloodied and adrenal reaction anymore.
---
I have the same problem with it. Im searching the web for more Info on it. I actually had it at lvl3 from directly after the update. I saw it working only once, and promptly maxed it out to lvl4. I never saw it working again since. I still cant tell for sure, but the max lvl version seems broken to me.
---
&gt; Next season we should be getting some new weapons and armor. 
---
Source?
---
would be nice if other players actually tried to do the primal cuts events. they are all just afk at grahams waiting for the hour to roll around.
---
The only thing that would prevent me from doing what you did is I can't use the legendary at this point and don't really want to toss it away or vendor it either.
---
I’ve done daily ops about 6 times now and 4 of them are caged bulb lights the other two I got nothing
---
The amount of times I got close to dying from shooting down from the totemnwith exploding bullets is embarrassingly high xD
---
If they ban me for using text chat Bethesdasoft can go fuck themselves.
---
You are mistaking ult gat lasers with ult laser.
---
Viable? Yes. Effortlessly one-shotting all but the toughest mobs? Not anymore.
---
We used to be able to skate by on just our strength and sneak damage bonuses, with things like Incisor and Iron Fist more a nice-to-have than essential perks. With the nerf to damage buffs, this has changed and we need more buffs to get back into one-shotting territory.
---
You'll want to get in the habit of using power attacks and melee buff foods (glowing meat steak, mutant hound chops, yao guai ribs, etc.) with the carnivore mutation. Having +swingspeed or +power attack damage on your weapon has also become more important than before.
---
Ohh the T51. Had no idea it would bend over. Eww
---
Idk man
---
PS4, thank you though. I swear the folks that play this are the best.
---
Nothing some tender lovin' couldn't fix
---
i got most recipes. 
---
for steal. go kill enemies and loot their weapons. they break down for easy steal, use the scrapper perk card in inelegance cos you get 10+ for most weapons
---
I'm confident I've missed out on about half a dozen 3 star weapons because of grass + ragdoll physics.
---
Couldn’t agree more. The commie bunker was kinda cool a few weeks back but aside from that I can’t remember the last time I really liked something
---
YES. I am a total idiot. I forgot about that
---
Bethesda should have created a separate bunch of servers for One Wasteland. Like they did for NW. A bit like when you create a new character in WoW, you get to choose the type of server you want to play on (PvP, PvE, RP, etc).
---
Existing players can then pay a numerous amount of atoms if they want to transfer their already leveled up characters over to One Wasteland.
---
drink them when you need to fill your thirst bar. quantums  are good for healing.
---
You get 25% of what you buy (spend) from a NPC vendor added to your selling amount (cant exceed the 1400 max)
---
The mask might be the raider one you get from the raider DLC. It was atom store at one point but now can only be bought with real money from Bethesda or steam
---
if they added in legendary level 50 drills i would use one.
---
Can't you just go to Watoga for those? I think the only robot that area is missing is a sentry bot and a Mr Gutsie?
---

---
Here's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. Been running this build for 250 odd levels now and love it
---
Note, 5 points of luck are from a legendary perk
---
Was it Mr. Pebbles who saved earth from Thanos or tony stark? I honestly can’t remember
---
No one wants to back track. Especially the borrows
---
Because that's EA are cheap fucks.
---
Bethesda bought this studio just to make FO76 and it's a lot easier to continue work on a game than it is to make a new one. 
---
Since microsoft is hands off with their studios I'm sure this still applies.
---
Primal cuts are great for xp
---
God I wish that was sarcasm or satire...
---
Calm down buddy 🤣
---
Or when you're going for a long run, use them for the AP
---
You can get 4 diluted stims for 1 stim and some purified water with the chemist perk. Add super duper and you could get 8 if it procs
---
75% to reduce 8% of incoming damage from players. 40% with a full set.
---
Yeah, it's a really weird decision to make all enemies scale. It's sucked all the variety out of the map. It's feeling less and less like a Fallout game, especially now VATS sneak doesn't work. 
---
Maybe it's for the best and time to move on -- I've had over 400 hours of fun with the game so I can't really complain. But I'm not really feeling the urge to rebuild my character and change my playstyle to fit an RPG that should support a variety of styles.
---
The durability boost and the ammo drops are made to enable rookies to participate not for ammo farming.
---
Strange...it always works for me. I also use miners helmet modded with high beam headlight. Just did it tonight.
---
Start a other account if you're on console, level up some characters a little everyday until they're 50, and use a courier from the tradlng sub to transfer over the scrip gear. If you have the patience for it
---
I saw it on a YouTube in a video that was supposed to be one of those "everything you need to know about legendary perks".
---
I sell it to NPC vendors. Though, if I were honest, I'll sell *everything* that is possible in-game.
---
I'm on the low end of Strength and generally don't wear Power Armor, so it's just added weight that serves little purpose otherwise. If I remember correctly, Nuka-Cola is 1 unit of weight, so your post indicates that you're carrying 90 units. That would make me cry -- and likely break my back!
---
I keep just enough to reliably provide a VATs benefit (such as Quantum's 100 AP) and then sell the rest.
---
I sell with chaps for 5k and without for 3k fairly regularly.
---
I _liked_ that characters had to improve and progress and work up to moving into different regions, but now, any new character can immediately go anywhere on the map.
---
WHAT IS THIS SHIT
---
Wait, is that why other people have been giving me the ???? emote when I keep calling them over to point bodies and stuff out? To them I'm pointing at nothing?
---
Thanks for the expanded answer! I never sat down to determine the actual value. I'll add an addendum to my post.
---
Its not punishment, I enjoy the game I spend money if I want. If they want me to stop playing fallout I wont give them my money
---
well microsoft bought zenimax in the past few days so hopefully shit will start being fixed now
---
The only one I haven't back tracked through was the burning mine.
---
Melee is your friend!
---
Since the daily ops started i have difficulty to sell all my stuff
---
Currently im buying excavator PA Mod Plans to fill up the vendors again to get rid of all my aids and trash legendaries ;-)
---
Secondary option is just converting that team to casual
---
Nuka Grenades! Best. Ivestment. Ever.
---
Lmao I’m a strength melee build so when I’m wandering, I don’t usually acknowledge my junk and food intake. But when I hurt for caps I do sell EVERYTHING. Sometimes if it’s bad enough I’ll go to the white springs resort and collect every piece of junk and sell it all back to them. Lol 57 vases? Easy 57 caps.
---
I spent 45 minutes pushing one of those guys in to a river and even got some free junk. I joined his team and he is yet to respawn. If you are on the drums or spit it gives you progress during the start up time.
---
I call them Molorats. 
---
(Molo is synonym for penis in finnish.)
---
I‘ve spent like 15 minutes looking for the loot of a legendary scorchbeast which unfortunately turned to ash. Nothing on the ground so I thought it must be on the roof of a nearby building but nothing. Then I used my jetpack to get a better view of the surroundings and there it was, far up in the air a pile of ash floating there. Could barely get it with my jetpack and you couldn‘t see it from below because there is no texture.
---
I do have the plans so I might as well try em out? 🤔
---
my fix isn’t the best but it’s still a lot better than fps dip.
---
I capped my fps at 60 and play on 1050p, turn shadow distant low, lighting to med, shadow Q to medium, texture medium, grass slider all the way down.
---
Thanks man.
---
This is awesome, they could certainly make a cool event out of this. Surely, they can do others besides meat week
---
I don’t drink them, sell them...I just hoard them 😂
---
I don't want to leave the Congo
---
That wouldn't happen in the wasteland, because there would be no foliage...  
---
... and I would actually feel like a Fallout game.
---
Level 2 Goat Legs helps me a lot. 
---
Level 3 Serendipity means I avoid a LOT of dying on landing. 
---
Level 3 Mysterious Saviour for when I don't avoid it.
---
I know. I mean, introducing A Colossal Problem somehow broke entry to Carlton Mine, twice. Once in the PTS where it was fixed, when the event first got introduced. Then it was fixed. And then the bug made it to live despite being fixed the first time around on the PTS. And the change to making the Inoculation quest easier for newbies is still broken for many players, what, a month on? It's genuinely bewildering.
---
So much exp though, just using  cranberry and a vaut suit and hitting 10k exp easily a
---
Glowing rad roaches in every Eastern bunker and most Western and central toilets.
---
Well I meant all Atom Shop items.
---
And rustic stuff doesn't fit in the Fallout universe... if it fits in Appalachia maybe it's Appalachia who doesn't fit in the Wasteland...  
---
Maybe Appalachia is not The Wasteland anymore... maybe Bethesda screwed up. Maybe that's one of the reason many people don't wanna play this game.
---
This is my only regret being bloodied. Once you die, you have to get the kindred spirit
---
Unless they changed it from the pts the laser turrets font proc electrical absorption. You can watch angry turtles, legendary perks tested p3
---
So me being the only one on a team with empath will make me take less damage If I use all those perks?
---
No it’s always been like that. If it just dies and falls it’ll be pretty much the same place for everyone. If the corpse then explodes it’ll be instanced for each individual player.
---
I use mine for workbenches - used to have it as a living space but the log cabin feels so much better suited to that
---
You don’t even need more than 2 people on the uplinks to get under 8 minutes. So even if the 3rd or 4th rando to join the op is level 1 they’re fine being on my team
---
They brought back the Slocum Joe bundle. Combined with the Red Rocket diner set, I was able to create my old fashioned diners which was cool.
---
Have you bought all the pa mod plans?
---
There is no spoon....
---
*Crickets*
---
Hahaha that's awesome - have my upvote!
---
TSE for up close but JE for overall.
---
Yeah, it's my favorite part of Fallout games -- those areas that are just terrifying you until you're level is much higher. The structure of the game works, you gradually power up and you're able to move further and further into the world. I have fond memories of being chased for what felt like hours by a mirelurk in Fallout 3 because I wondered just a little too far from camp... 
---
But the fact they're removing food and drink as a necessity from the game just feels to me like what I want from Fallout and what Fallout is are becoming very different things. I want that RPG experience with wasteland variety, the ability to play as different roles, survival aspects. Whereas the emphasis on the game seems to be making it more of a regular shooter. Not saying they're wrong, but I'm not sure it's for me.
---
I'd never say those people suck, but if you don't have people with at least decent builds at ACP, it's going to fail.
---
Wait, removing food and drink as a necessity?
---
This is literally the first time I’ve heard this
---
Most legendaries do that now - until you kill them. At which point they just dematerialise.
---
PS4 &amp; XBoxPut a hair tie around your right stick (the one that controls camera) and pull the other end around the hand part of the controller (the thing that your palm touches, what is that even called?) This will keep your camera moving, but you won't move, so you won't accidentally spin yourself off of drums. For PC, I've heard that putting an analog watch under your mouse works?
---
It’s even worse with energy weapons that turn them into ash or goo. The lag on these servers will mean that pile of goo would materialize anywhere in a 10 mile radius or even behind you if that was the momentum they had when they died
---
No, it’s every three hours per silo.
---
They seem to suffer the opposite problem of the Captain Cosmos Legendary Run poster where I can only place them on the bottom half of walls. Also are pretty random about what they display. Pistols? Nope. Auto Grenade Launcher? Sure. Minigun? Nope. Gatling Laser? Yeah!
---
hell no. overloaded and dropping useless legendary every minute.
---
I don't think he's there at the moment is he?
---
Do I actually need team mates, because strange in numbers works when you're solo on a public team.
---
Nobody knows when stuff will be back in the atom shop
---
You get alot of xp tough... I Love this update
---
Thats one thing I never do and have never thought of funny thing is I already have the scrapper perk lmaoo sometimes I wonder how I've even managed to get to lvl 72 lol
---
I've been dying for a lights plan, I'll buy it off you or trade for it
---
I hadn't heard it either until someone mentioned it recently. Apparently it's coming with the next big update.
---
&gt;Another big change for One Wasteland is the removal of Fallout 76’s negative survival elements. As it stands right now, if you don’t eat or drink for a while in the game, you’ll find yourself struggling on with a heavy debuff. But in One Wasteland, there will be no penalties, only bonuses for those who take the time to quaff and scarf all they find. “We want the flavor of survival without the drudgery,” Gardiner said.
---
[From here](https://massivelyop.com/2020/05/28/fallout-76-interview-bethsoft-on-one-wasteland-text-chat-and-other-radioactive-topics/). 
---
I'm not saying I like having to eat and drink -- it's a pain -- but it's a good kind of pain. It's a 'oh crap I gotta go hunt something to eat and live...' situation, which fits the Wasteland.
---
Thank you 😊
---
As a *sort of* veteran player with two characters (a level 137 sniper and a level 31 heavy gunner) I completely agree with you.  
---
The game is fun and interesting with my high level character most of the time, except in situations than don't make any fucking sense, like being overwhelmed by level 100 molerats (level 100 molerats, really?).  
---
**But it is absolutely tedious and hard for my low level character.**   
---
Sense of progression? Non existent. You're always fighting enemies at your level so you don't have the feeling you are improving... and that's **very bad game design**.
---
It's so bad that I'm thinking about stopping playing with my low-level char until a next patch comes live that fixes this broken enemy leveling system.
---
I make psychotats with mine
---
How Bloodied are you? Must be hardcore or just a slow smoker...
---
I didn't know either!😂 But that was definitely the problem. Like someone else said, since I have the plan finally, I won't store them.
---
Thanks again.
---
I mean, it's usually also some time in the bathroom but I didn't think that was necessary to add.
---
Unfortunately those both were hard passes from me.
---
Why do people think you have to play with them? The only time I ever play with my team is ops and if they happen to be at the same event.
---
Though once in a blue moon I get an annoying newer player follow me around.
---
Easy man, what's next no scrip limit.  They need the daily op rewards to last till next year.  If you get them too soon bad things will happen.
---
Ran it every day since release, got top tier every day, got my first reward this morning. Fucking vault suit.
---
You need to have other people on the team I believe, but just join a team or make one and wait for people to join.  You don't need to talk to or interact with them or anything.
---
Do you happen to know if they plan on bringing back the Survivor's event?
---
Cannot imagine and surprisingly jealous. I survive in that infinitesimally tiny spot between collecting precisely the resources that I need and the low weight-high cap assessment that gets me those sweet, sweet caps. Though I feel like I'm always hitting that ridiculous 30,000 caps, well, *cap*.
---
They should make legendary enemies be highlighted or have a beam of light or something emonating from the corpse until looted.
---
With the queen, you have to inflict a certain amount of damage before she's lootable.
---
If you dont put enough damage into the queen she doesnt drop loot . It was something they started to keep low levels from showing up to only shoot the queen once and get 3 stars for minimal effort .
---
No clue, they have yet to bring back the vault tec one so I wouldn't hold your breath
---
Haha I know, I'm not one of the anti group solo players. Just wondering if anyone else needs it.
---
The dropped weapon thing I've never heard. That guy was lucky you were decent. 😂👍
---
Ammo.
---
One thing i always wondered about this event, does the extractors even change the rewards you get? Done it many times but I've never seen any difference between fixing them fast or leaving them be
---
Gold bullion.
---
Just spent 10,000 on a rare Fasnavht mask, usually watching for any Faster Swing Speed &amp; Reduced Weight Melee.
---
I believe the more you collect the better rewards and more legendary spawns
---
It's not ammo farming if you're getting the same or less back.
---
Source saying it's meant for "rookies", because suggested level is 50.
---
I got one and i was afk in a bush
---
(i wasn't actually)
---
Are you dissing my sneaky gravedigger build?? 😡
---
I also buy extra serum plans , cards for sheepsquatch , cheap chems that i resell for more , ammo thats 1 cap that i know can sell for 2 caps ,and cheap scrip legendarys
---
Xp is one of the least interesting things in the game to me.
---
I’m just a simple water farmer
---
I do not use mutations because of having to deal with radaway/having to trade for serums. And i dislike low health builds a lot.
---
I wish I could bulk drop floater grenades
---
It's just rng
---
And it's one of the most interesting things to me. At level 425 with all the gear I could ever want and then some xp and killing is the only thing I care about
---
Different strokes for different folks
---
I’ve playing since beta and the only outfit I’ve ever bought was the western duster. I’ve always found them lacking
---
That's pretty sad.
---
Yes I love all of this especially the end of the title
---
As a veteran with a low level alt character I wouldn't say "challenging". **It's plain broken** (at low levels).  
---
The enemy leveling system is so broken at low levels that I'm transferring ammo, plans and armor from my main character to my alt.  
---
**The sense of progression is non existent.** All the enemies you encounter are bullet sponges and **always** at the same level as you... Yesterday I almost died to 4 molerats with my level.  MOLERATS! **How can this be fun?**   
---
I would understand a level 31 (my alt) dying to 4 radscorpions (even with different levels like levels 31, 25, 15 and 10) but to molerats?
---
Take the perk in luck that stops you from losing them. If u want high health that’s fine u just lose quite a bit of damage. Carry weight. Stealth and accuracy. Still want to be specialising in one tree. And take stealth perks to double and then some your damage.
---
How so?
---
Are you using a weapon with ultracite ammo?
---
REALLY depends.  If you like to farm scorched or super mutants, that may be true, heck, level 50 scorched can still easily be one-shotted.  But lately I've been doing a lot of Primal Cuts with a lot of Radscorpions, Honey Beasts, Fog Crawlers, Yao Guai and the like.  I have a bloodied gatling with some damage perks, and its more damage per shot than pretty much anything short of Gauss weapons. I can confirm that many of them are too spongey to go down in just 3 shots.
---
Congratulations!
---
I wonder if anyone will actually follow those exact steps to try and get a Tenderizer plan. It's just RNG, so it wont matter. I tried SO hard last season and failed but was lucky enough to find a plan in a player vending machine.
---
Legend
---
I'll just wait until I reach the end of season 2 because that gives a unique armor skin for all of them and it's decent looking until something from the atom shop goes on sale.

Stuff to spend caps on:
---
\- Weapons that I want   
---
\- rare items that I want (Reclaimed Deep Diving mask from ACP, for instance)  
---
\- plans  
---
\- stable Flux to craft ammo (when my stash isnt to full)  
---
(- used to buy ammo, but I now have 15000 .45 and I am melting down my 5.56 slowly to switch to ultracite)  
---
\- 0 weight items to further my cap deposit (Technical Data, Lockpicks)
---
in my world, those go directly into the scip machine
---
no. 
---
Use this for a rough idea on the worth of an item [https://fed76.info/pricing/?item=None&amp;effects=None](https://fed76.info/pricing/?item=None&amp;effects=None)
---
Joining a team. Every time a teammate completes an event you get caps.
---
A level 50 is a rookie for me. At level 50 I knew nothing about the game.
---
Scrip it
---
I have been using public teams since it was related and it's never hindered that for me, you just get an annoying new player follow you around once in awhile. Just ignore em.
---
These are true BoS that are coming, not the Appalachian chapter. They won't act the same
---
Ammo was my goto as well
---
Sitting at 88000 (45) and 180000 (5.56)
---
I NEVER remember to do this...
---
Who won out of the enemies?
---
Definitely not - never even think about it as I never use PA. good cap sink though!
---
You have to remember this game is all about your build. That’s where u get your defences and your damage. Not your armour or weapons. If you don’t change your build to incorporate that you’ll be level 600 still struggling to kill and stay alive.
---
Herd mentality either works or procs and then goes back to normal when you're alone on a public team. Never cared to look, but now I will.
---
Because he probably hasnt duped them. There's no way people still have over 100 high quality gifts legitimately.
---
Honestly mate whilst I disagree with your point on fast travel costs I'm on your side about the hypocrisy you're dealing with from this guy. Sadly you really can't deal with chuds like urnamesucksbro, it's best to ignore them.
---
I feel a change in sneaking too. I always played without sneak 3. unyielding armor with one sneak piece and a fixer always was enough but since the patch I need the sneak perk with agi 15 to make it work again.
---
It could be that there are complaints about Fallout 76 being a huge costume party and not serious and hard core enough, might they be a bit reticent to offer outlandish outfits?
---
I quite enjoy coming across players with imaginative combinations, I agree there could be more.
---
Not who you responded to, but, being on a public team since it was released has hindered my solo play.
---
Yep. It's like family shopping...   
---
Clean, beautiful curtains for the house, a new rustic coach for grandpa and some antler horns for decorating the wall, and a silly molerat costume for the kids.  
---
Apocalypse? Wasteland? Pppfff... don't make me laugh... Fallout nowadays only means Power Armor skins, Vault boy stuff and NukaColas.  
---
But people keep buying stuff in the Atom shop... So...
---
Secret nuclear age hinges
---
Ammo
---
Good, i thought it was just me when I did the Mothman event at the lighthouse, at ten levels lower pre-update I used to solo that thing, today died three times to the toad who seemed to take me out with like two hits.
---
I love you
---
currently equipped with 50 cal/mini/lmg/harpoon all using ult ammo except the poon
---
Scrip
---
Agreed. If at least they looked rusty or just a little bit decayed...
---
Which sucks because now I gotta figure out what perks I want.
---
Not before a year. It would be a major kick in nuts for other members,to waste a month on a duplicate
---
You can’t make Psychotats...
---
That's another problem entirely. I have a stealth sniper build without mutations or weapons with HP or status related effects (only Troubleshooter's, Vampire's and Executioner's) and it's working juuuust fine for solo play or even the occasional solo Daily Op. What I don't do is events that I simply can't be useful in, like Encryptid, Scorched Earth, Colossal Problem or the Meat Week events. Because my build doesn't allow it. If people with a build similar to mine join these and cause them to fail, it's no one's fault but theirs.
---
But I'm kinda tired of other players trying to force a Bloodied or mutant (*or team*) build on me just because it can deal a little more damage than what I currently have. It wouldn't be fun anymore and then I'd stop playing, and that'd be a shame.
---
Did it just yesterday for the "kill 15 scorched" daily. Satisfying.
---
You have to inflict over 1000 damage on the queen to trigger any loot drop.  Stops people afk’ing
---
Ok then?
---
But in my opinion a green or orange filter doesn’t make a game fallout.
---
It’s the art style. Which the the spec ops outfit definitely doesn’t follow.
---
Did radiation rumble last night, was just 3 of us, got 115 notes to scrap, was easy. Plus got the kill glowing enemies too.
---
They're not broken, the items themselves are. Quite a few items no longer have display graphics no matter where you display them.
---
Was about to post this, spot on!  Racks up fairly fast when 3 team mates are doing dailies etc
---
I think the Atom shop has enough childish, goofy and wacky skins/costumes already
---
Ammo is already trivial as is with two new locations spewing out whatever you're using, having all events be that way would just make the ammo factory, and ammosmith perks completely useless.
---
I am in for the autoloot option! I had it a few times that I killed Earle, got my HP out of focus and died a few seconds later by a wendigo horde. Loot lost! :(
---
Man, that would be really cool... but I doubt we'll see it...
---
It should be 100% drop rate if you do it solo. Otherwise there will be too many out there and it won’t worth anything.
---
If I remember correctly, you can buy them from the vendor in the Whiteprings Bunker in the medical wing.
---
Heads up - I leave the extractor broken at far end (the one to right as you enter) which means you get more miners to kill in the open area.  Event still completes.  I got 4 legendaries last run, maybe because of the extra time.
---
We did sort of have some level scaling like that but not that pronounced and didn't show in the mob levels. 
---
BGS went overboard IMO though. I think somewhere in between where we were and what we have now would have been better.
---
Imagine trying to grind out the "kill 1000 robots with an improvised weapon" now.  Just thwacking away with a lead pipe and diluted stimpaks until it finally dies, and then repeat another thousand times.
---
Hmm, maybe I am wrong. I figured if all operational better rewards
---
There’s definitely a psychobuff recipe, but I’m not too sure there’s a Psychotats recipe or I’d have found/bought it by now. I use Psychotats in PvP constantly.
---
Bethesda and Obsidian are under the same Moon now do you never know.
---
But that would mean playing others people playstyle, not mine. Is an RPG, if it was a decently balances rpg i could use whatever i want, and i should be mildly efficient in the game. However, because i dont use X, Y, Z or play in W manner, im heavily penalized.
---
Dont get me wrong, i appreciate your help. I had not thought of the public teams and lone wonderer, so ill use some of your tips, but the thought of having to play like player type 1, 2 or 3 is a mood killing thing for me. Is an loose RPG, not a "hardcore" RPG. I shouldnt need meta to enjoy the game to do the most basic thing. Is fine for bosses and hard zones, but nor for going around. Let me decide what build I want, and how to play. I have a decent build, dont make me useless just because is not a build that is specialized in combat with one weapon type!
---
Anyways, I really appreciate your tips. Thanks for your time. Ill do another build with your tips for combat only i guess, if i keep playing the game
---
This. The once low level super mutants still drop pipe guns.
---
Killed 3 scorchbeast queen's, got drops off them all and XP for killing them and killed 3 legendary scorchbeasts and a normal 1. Only 2/3, soooo, yeah.....
---
Ohh and a lvl 100 mirelurk queen. They are pretty big....
---
They said there won't be a mischief night?
---
I’m right there with ya! I jumped on the Xbox this week and saw how different it’s become it took a couple try’s but it gets Easier. I’ve adopted more of a melee heavy build and silenced rifles, the extra damage from sneak attacks helps a lot.  I’ve also gone back to places I’ve already explored quite heavily to stock up on medical supplies, oh and lots and lots and looots of drugs. I’m still super new but I’m getting used to the difficulty shift and it’s becoming pretty enjoyable. Downside I did end up buying fallout first because my stash was just to full
---
theoretically as a low level player with low level gear you can do enough damage to get her lootable
---
unfortunatly its almost impossible for you because she often lives just a few minutes
---
I love helping newer guys - I've only been playing 4 months but I recieved a shit tonne of help both directly and indirectly, now I'm 250 with enough good weapons and armour to invade the moon solo - and I always want to pay it forward. I recently took a lowbie under my wing and when he hit 50 made him a full set of X01 with calibrated shocks, and topped that of with a junkies minigun, some mid range 50 cal and an AA Gatling Laser. He was absolutely stunned.
---
What gets my goat is high levels who are really taking the piss with players generosity. People who pretend to be high lvl just so they can get free stuff. Irks me no end
---
I'm pretty sure it was a different group who landed on the moon in the Fallout universe. I guess the same principle applies either way though.
---
no one in the game knows how to play foosball.....
---
Just did that today too. Cleaning up the stash was needed. And before i drop them randomly somewhere and let them waste, i just give them to a new guy.
---
The problem u had with the queen is because u need to do roughly 1000 damage on her to claim loot.
---
The losing weapons thing is all Bethesda!
---
We had someone message us last night after losing his flamer to someone called Kermit_the_llama who  was requesting to trade with everyone and then trying to  kill them. He was shooting people and PvP would just start without them retaliating.
---
Use pacifist mode to avoid this and price something in your vendor to 30000 caps to avoid people stealing from your stash.
---
What is the minimum he'll accept?
---
Was around few weeks ago in the atom store(less than a month).
---
Yeah I like One Wasteland apart from this (and level 100 mole rats). I think they should turn down the enemy level for the Forest, to be honest.
---
This gives me hope on keeping stocked up on grenades,
---
I picked up ~1000 from the grenade trap glitch from around launch and I've slowly been using/selling them and now I'm down to 400. Trying to pump those numbers back up.
---
I know 400 sounds like a bit much but w/ one wasteland I can easily go through 30-40 in a single session.
---
I had the same thing happen with my ultracite handmade and someone told me that the game thinks you’re out of ammo on ultracite weapons if you don’t have a few rounds of nonultracite ammo on your player. Apparently carrying around a fusion core works too. I just keep some regular rounds on me now and it stopped happening, I’m not sure if that’s what’s going on with you
---
I'm not sure about ACP, but for ops you definitely don't get more ammo from the mobs. Best case it seems to be the give the amount used, but even if you have 100% accuracy, you're making a profit except for the reward it gives you at the end
---
Sneak has never worked right in Primal Cuts. Maybe it’s the Molerats/Radscorpions, but it seems to be the case at all the PC events.
---
So disregard what I said, stupid primal animals just easily smashed my communist fences even though no other enemy has ever touched them... sigh. I hate this events spawn points
---
I hate one wasteland; it's such a stupid thing. Burning through stimpaks in areas where I'd have to be afk to even take damage and my armour is pretty much broken all the time...
---
The whole MMO deal they keep trying to stuff fo76 with just continues to show how it *doesn't* suit the game series; limited stash, caps of items etc. It really sucks because I was looking forward to actually progressing fo76 this season and doing the quests instead of just chasing daily challenges and logging off
---
It looks way too big for the loco too....
---
Since the last update the game is riddled with bugs and exploits. Take care in the wasteland because there are some real dodgy bastards playing. 👍
---
Not sure if you know, but it's been data mined you can become an initiate. So youre probably correct.
---
I need a 1* spoon
---
Oh yeah lol could be psychobuff. I honestly wouldn’t know, I don’t use them. But it probably wouldn’t hurt to keep swinging by to check every once in a while 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Social anxiety is real, and it's complex and I have empathy for people who struggle with it. Honestly, I was only posting this thread because I wanted solo players to realize that they could join casual teams and reap great benefits with zero change to their play style.
---
These new power armor skins do look a bit comical to be perfectly honest.
---
I agree. We can inspect legendaries whenever we want, *if* we want, from our inventory. The last thing I want when I’m still in combat is a microscopic look at the three star legendary Berserker’s set of Sock’em Boppers I just picked up.
---
I've played since launch and are only level 150 something. So the XP isn't high priority for me. The main reason I don't join Teams is all the UI elements it adds, if we could turn them off I'll hop on a team everytime.
---
This has nothing to do with a color filter but I agree it's the art style that makes a a game, a Fallout game.  
---
Well it's a ***particular*** art style that defines any franchise.  
---
If you start changing the art style of your franchise to reach out to other players,  some people won't recognize it and won't play it and you'll divide the community.  
---
So, if the Fallout franchise is set in a post-nuclear apocalypse, in a barren wasteland with rusty and decayed buildings, mutated beasts and so... and you change that, some people are going get pissed.  
---
Sure, you can still sell power armor skins and vaultboy shit but you've lost people... and F76 is a shinning example of this.  
---
And, for the record, I don't care who owns the IP.  I'm not gonna agree with whatever Bethesda does just because they own the IP. Likewise, I'm not gonna agree with whatever Walt Disney (for instance) does to Star Wars just because they own the IP.
---
If I join a ops team I wait till they move in but if not in 5 mins I go in
---
If I make a ops team I go in after 2 more join most times I will stay in and work it until I get third tier reward or just join in when folks go in if I already have it 
---
Its a exciting run but cost a shitton of ammo
---
Nice. I always forget about them. I am still sitting on about 10 lunchboxes from season one.
---
You sir deserve a job 👏
---
Sims 76 😊
---
I'd love a p90, but even though it was in fallout 2, it's probably still too modern for them too add.
---
Oh sorry my bad I meant Overdrive 😃
---
Thanks mate will go by this from now on
---
Half my level in the Forest would be in the 90s though. That just makes things worse, especially since enemies continue to get stronger after 50 when I don't.
---
As someone else who uses grenades, I've found hitting the grenades, either through good aim, vats, or an explosive weapon, helps with setting them off at the right time.
---
Of course, there are better dps options out there but this playstyle is enjoyable for me.
---
Totally agree. I wanted to do the daily ops yesterday but not solo, so I joined the public team and tried to run the daily ops a few times, but nobody joined for minutes.
---
But I then noticed that I wasn't able to leave the team, because all others where full and I wasn't allowed to create a new team while already in a team. o\_O
---
YTMND
---
Yeah, what they did made more mobs ammo sponges for everyone between scaling ad nerfing all classes. On top of that some of the mobs seem too strong at low level since perks limited, unless you deck out your character with well modded gear.
---
I'm glad I had a higher level character, and another account and system, to feed my leveling character for a while or resources would have been a problem.
---
They really did the scaling poorly. In other games and prior to patch 20, I enjoy beating up on low levels once in a while.
---
It would have liked to see a minimum and cap maybe with a reasonable window for level scaling with based on area.
---
I have exploding palm and it seems to do explosive damage I think in the same way guns would (i.e. a percentage of base damage). Demotion expert seems to work on it, as well as possibly grenedier (still testing that). Seems to proc often enough (have it at level 3)
---
Someone forever ago told me it was data mined that the better you do in events, the better chance at rare rewards.
---
They should release Fallout 3 weapon skins or maybe even better, a different version with different animations and ammo packs on your back just like in Fallout 3. Always loved the way that looked/functioned.
---
I swapped mine for a croc bp, so pretty rare. Definitely not 3 legacys though XD maybe 1 if someone really wants it
---
Always 3 spawn. It was data mined a long time ago that the better you do at events, the better chance at rare rewards
---
Man I was lucky enough to see one while being at the top of one of those mansions. seeing Appalachia during one is so awesome
---
You're the hero this community needs.
---
Seriously though, if you must AFK, do it on the drums or roasting spits. If you just AFK in the middle of the event and contribute nothing, being pushed into a river is the least you deserve.
---
Here's hoping it won't be a skin.
---
Skyrim will come free from every Microsoft office
---
Oh. I see. Thanks for the info an
---
The roadmap
---
Im pretty sure you miss the right side to the objective there. Also you’re risking other players killing stuff before you can tag it.
---
Nevertheless it’s still a bunch of xp wherever you take part in that event :)
---
Hmmm need to be the stealthy tank🛺🚖🚋🚈🚉🚨🚡🚂✈️🚔🚠🚝🚆🛫🚍🚟🚄🚇🏍🚃🚅🚊🛴🦼 every damn icon but a tank ...WTF
---
Quad auto railway rifle. If you can find a 3* with 25 vats ap cost consider yourself blessed as the vats cost is already fairly low with an auto receiver
---
Hate ragdolls then you hate ppl like me that blasts legendary enemys with a explosive mini gun or a explosive gp or gatling lazer and sends them flying into oblivion. Thats why i like my build the ragdoll is Hilarious and i just love using gun that gutter my fps with the amount of random explosions happening at once and plus i usually play solo because all my gun are either legacy BE and TSE heavy guns and my TS fat man with mirv. Srry if you see me in a event i just spray and play with my guns because after a weeks farm for lead gunpowder and steel i make almost 100k of each heavy gun ammo type and thats life as a bloodied heavy guns PA tank build. So if you see me at a event don't shoot me after because caps don't matter too me so win or lose i'll keep coming after your knowing your wasteing ammo were i'm getting rid of excess ammo and why i say caps don't matter too me is because i walk every were because it you fast travel you will miss acouple possible legendary enemys on your way too your destination
---
I saw someone post an elaborate farm for caps from giant sloths. 
---
If you really desperate for caps just server hop the event and the 20 caps for clearing the mobs at Grafton steel.
---
Okay, firstly I never said that *all* the stuff on the atom shop is friendly to the setting. But the rustic stuff currently on it definitely is. Seeing as the game is set in Appalachia.
---
Secondly, the players want un-lore friendly stuff, as is evident by the spec ops outfit.
---
The event could include strapping a cat to a rocket and sending it to outer space
---
Going to, I think I have just been blowing my chances, I like soloing thing just because I can. I realise now these Ops Events are teams only for best rewards.
---
Multiple rolls? I thought it was only once a day, thanks for the info, I will hold of now soloing these events and try find a full good team
---
&gt;especially now VATS sneak doesn't work.
---
Works fine for my bloodied/sneak/commando. I'm not sure how well full health sneak is working atm though and haven't played one in over a year. I wouldn't be surprised if it's broken though
---
I vendor hop and sell the weapons for higher. Some people put REALLY good weapons in their vendor for less than like 1k when they can easily sell for 10k+ on the market. Then you get trading and make some sweet caps :)
---
That does seem to be the case, long run to final area. I will run these Ops in a team from now on, no more doing it solo.
---
It rolls for all 3 at once, so you only have to run the daily op once if you get elder first try. You have a 5% drop rate on tier 1, 10% on tier 2, and 80% of a rare plan for tier 3 in the daily ops. So essentially if you get Elder first try you have a fairly decent chance of getting a rare plan (not guaranteed!) since it’s rolling for all 3 tiers at once
---
Won't happen. They've been duped into the millions. 
---
There's tons of people on ebay selling 100,000s of them.
---
It's just a visual bug, you don't have to shuffle with cards.
---
I'll probably buy one more serum. I'm mostly saving it for fluxes so I can craft Ultracite ammo.
---
Sneak bonuses seem to work when aiming down the sights but using VATS they don't work anymore. Pretty sure it's not just me, I've seen quite a few posts about it. But yeah, might be working for some people then.
---
I think thats sort of the issue. High level, youre swimming in ammo. Low level, you don't have enough do to anything.
---
Using a mask and goggles combination with the 'Quack' outfit, I created a badass wasteland psycho doctor look, I love it.
---
You don’t have to play like anyone. I’m just saying you need to have your build taylored towards damage and defence. Doesn’t have to be maxed but at the moment your build isn’t helping you anywhere. Public teams don’t forget you act as your own team mate so mutations like empath where u take more damage but your team mates take less applies to you as your own teammate. So I think it’s 18% more damage to u but as your own team mate u take 33% less giving you 15% as a base on your own if that make sense. As I said. It’s not your gear. I do substantial damage with a crafted non legendary fixer. And think alike blocker and dodgy really help mitigate damage.
---
Save em incase new drops inside. You weren't gonna get much out of 100 presents even before they took away scrip.
---
Yeah, Electrical Absorption is fun. It makes Assaultrons a joke because their laser hits so many times, its pretty much a guaranteed proc. I've taken off Power User completely now and with some heavy playing this past week I've only used like 2-3 cores of the 60 I had.
---
we really need some good pistols
---
I'm lucky I had a +50 before one wasteland hit. I had been leveling up another one to try a different build, but with one wasteland it's just too much of a chore. I don't have enough ammo to do anything.
---
I have it and it's annoying as hell. I have it set up so that when it spawns, I launch it off a cliff with a trap so I don't hear it singing.
---
I can say for certain it's not a visual bug. My resistances are a *lot* lower and I die so much easier until I shuffle the card and Barbarian gets the extra strength.
---
😂 I forget too.
---
Hmm. I see. Ill check on the public teams effects and then swap some cards to react accordly to being in a team. Thanks for everything!
---
Shitty design? you probably didnt play a lot of mmo. you can be locked for a week sometimes.
---
Are you Xbox?
---
&gt; I pay for these services
---
What services are you paying for exactly? And whom do you pay?
---
I hazard a guess and say you're only paying for Game Pass. Something totally unrelated to Fo76.
---
No, on ps4 :(
---
Same, the level 50's are almost as easy as they were on level 1. But the damage whining is dying out more as people realize this is completely fine
---
All of those
---
&gt;"to be careful with future purchases because this option may not always be available."
---
the bloody nerve to say "be careful, you should no we can't do anything right."
---
You monster.
---
Why has this not had more upvotes - comment of the thread :D
---
Well, if you check your STR SPECIAL stat before shuffling card and after and indeed have the difference you should submit a ticket and wait if it'll be fixed.
---
what I meant is: Appalachia (**as presented by Bethesda in this Fallout game**) is not setting-friendly to a Fallout game or, at least, not to what *it was* a Fallout setting: barren wasteland, rusty and decayed buildings, yada, yada... (See previous post).  
---
And Bethesda owning the IP it's not an argument to make *this* Appalachia Fallout-setting-friendly. Same example as before, if Walt Disney decides (for whatever reason) to get rid of Imperial Destroyers or X-Wings and change them with Romulan vessels or whatever, I won't *buy it* just because they own the IP.
---
&gt; Secondly, the players want un-lore friendly stuff, as is evident by the spec ops outfit. 
---
Agreed current Fo76 players want this (sadly). But that's because Bethesda changed the art style, the setting... losing many Fallout fans in the process and attracting new ones who have never played the other games... and now some people think *"this is Fallout, because it has Power Armors, NukaColas and Vaultboys"*  
---
Well, sorry, fallout was more than that.
---
Then unfortunately I can’t help. Hopefully you get it soon
---
This is coming from someone with a power armor character: Power Armor already has so much benefits, it doesn't need more
---
No Fall damage, or it seems to only do like 1 damage.
---
Built in damage resistance on top of the DR ER.
---
Built in rad resistance on top of the ones shown in the stars screen.
---
Breaks super slow.
---
No stimpack animation.
---
Emergency protocols. It's a must have even if you're not bloodied.
---
I'm sure I'm forgetting something else.
---
Sometimes Commander Daguerre joins him and she goes on her mission to go back into space while he is singing. It's a lovely sight for anyone below the cliff haha 🤣🤣🤣
---
The mole rats, rats, and bugs are the stupidest part of the scaling, and the scaling is stupid in general the way they did it.
---
Collision course.
---
"wait, you guys are getting *lights?*"
---
plesant valley clame tokens usually give a few apon handing them in.
---
collision coarse gives 100 apon completion every time.
---
Collision Course event at Morgantown Airport
---
Caps are only good to sink into plans and to ft.
---
with my instigatin gauss rifle i left burrows with 150-200rounds plus - only from the meatpiles &amp; lootbags
---
For the event reward i equip my prime gatling plasma and leafe the event with 2-4 cores plus
---
But yes, its not guaranteed to get out of a daily op with a plus of ammo
---
😂😂😂
---
Good times.
---
I speak for everyone's concerns about microsoft buying zenimax
---
yea. no you dont speak for everyone here.
---
Only a bit? Only Power Armor Skins? XD  
---
Yesterday I refused to unlock the free lawn flamingo in the Atom shop. I don't care if it's free, it's wacky, it's childish and it's not Fallout.
---
😂
---
"Didn't appreciate that"
---
I feel your pain though.
---
My turrets decided to shoot my ally for the longest time.
---
Absolutely hate level scaling. 
---
I remember back when I first started playing and how exciting it was to finally level up to a point to be able to handle white springs runs, or to be viable enough to run the bog and take on the Queen. What excitement is there for low level players now?
---
Im high level but I really enjoyed being able to run forrest areas and experiment with new weapons that I wasnt specced into and see how things felt. I cant do tagr anymore when level 50 molerats are biting my ass. 
---
They should have truly left areas the same levels they were and only done scaling for events.
---
No worries. Anytime
---
The QE harpoon gun is pretty fun, mine still does 1400 damage after patch 22 nerf, plus it has a scope (only heavy that does), and can cause magic shotgun damage if you put the right armor on. It's not as good as the explosive plasma gattler or flamer, but it's fun.
---
If an enemy ragdolls you don't have to chase it, as long as you know where it died that's where the meat pile will eventually spawn.  Also you can pull out a camera and see the names of corpses and meat piles to track down legendarys.
---
Assaultron recall cards.
---
Appalachia has all of those in distinct varied settings though...
---
Sure whitesprings is pristine, but that’s just because the robots are maintaining it 24/7.
---
This. It's people like this that make others not want to trade my mask for the outfit, because they know some impatient person will give em something ridiculous for it.
---
Took me forever to trade my miner mask for a meat pile plan.
---
I wish you were right... I'm tired of wacky, goofy and casual stuff in the atom shop. I wanna see more wasteland-ish and rusty stuff...  
---
but I doubt Microsoft will be able to do any changes in the near future... not before I cancel my Fallout 1st subscription anyway...
---
What if it's a One S?
---
Or you can for once welcome prize not for the 100 prewar cash
---
Use your camera, aim it and it tells you what's there, so you can use it to find your killed legendaries.
---
Now that you mention it, I have noticed recently vats missing with my full auto a bit but I just let off the trigger and pull it again and it's fixed. Annoying and BGS needs to fix it but not severely detrimental for me.
---
This nerf across the board was supposed to fix a lot of these issues like this and rubber banding health but it hasn't. At least not totally and reintroduced some old problems, as usual.
---
And treasure notes should be 100% drop at least once a day, and not special reward
---
Agreed. I have a friend who’s only got two rewards after a week of these.
---
I've moved my camp to a gold node near Mac's Farm in the 'Bog and, knock on wood, nothing has yet to attack my bass with my lowest tier turrets because I wasn't thinking when I scraped my home defense max card.
---
go in deep water and drop like near grafton steel , then switch servers to limit the time your dropped bag stays
---
drop them on the ground at the edge of fisher prime , then put one piece of scrap in your backpack and jump in the fisher. it will move the the plans to the bottom of the fisher
---
Just give us a (legendary?) perk called “County Coroner” or “Mortician” that highlights lootable corpses.
---
Still, if you don’t have another alt who’s at least level 50, you aren’t earn the rewards you care about.
---
Can our defenses stop attacking our defenses? I.E. turrets attacking walls or turrets attacking other turrets? Lol
---
Im talking about the bunch of challenges "kill robots with x weapon" where the amounts you have to kill represent some binary number I assume. So each is 1000 or more. All for 40 atoms.
---
I run carnivore and get the xp bonus from relish..
---
Send in a ticket, they are usually quick to help with Atom Shop problems.
---
How does one submit a ticket?
---
Why quickly? You have a full weeks to complete it.
---
Honestly each is only worth 40 atoms and thats not enough for me to care anymore. Ive resolved those will never be completed by me
---
They could but there's a fine line they would have to walk in order to prevent continuity errors. Like they would have to make it so that the overseer rank worked in adventure mode as well. Not saying he couldn't work because technically the vault door is open when you go into nuclear winter.
---
Yeah if people are gonna afk then at least go on the barrels or turn the meat
---
All second this, anytime I see other people using theirs I'll drop one as well.
---
Uhhggg. That is frustrating. Your comment is one of the things that happens and why I wanted to try and clarify a little bit with my post.
---
As far as not being able to leave the team I have some help: 
---
in the future, next time that happens to you - 
---
1) go into your social menu and open the tab that shows you and your teammates only.
---
2) highlight your name and select it
---
3) it should give you and option to leave the team.
---
Once you choose to leave the team, you are now able to join another one or create your own.
---
If they still want us to work for it, the 100% rare plan could be some other, non-exclusive rare plans, such as marine armor helmets and plasma grenade plans. Or perhaps if you get elder and don’t earn one of the new plans, you roll from a table of hard to find plans.
---
Hmm, im gonna try it Out :)
---
He deserves it
---
As a level 40, being able to join any groups - including with all you lovely high level folk- has literally been a game changer. So often I was scrambling away from enemies twice my level. Now I’d probably the most addicted I’ve been to the game in ages. I’ve been given so many gifts by other players, it’s ridiculous! Such an awesome community.
---
yeah i did some digging, I guess i underestimate Bethesda in their ability to screw up thing. (and my expectations were already very very low)
---
I understand how dupes, teleports and client side spawn, but item injection?   
---
This is such incompetence i can't even have word for that.  
---
At least it seems to be controlled now, but who knows.
---
I only get the on screen pop up notice on the 1st one that happens after logging in. Subsequent ones don't have the pop up message but looking at the map shows them active.
---
At the very least make them stop instantly despawning or dropping through the map textures. I cannot count the number of times I have fought a three star legendary only to watch the body fall through the ground into wherever they go to.
---
Yep legendaries are way to common. No way I want them putting that 1 star FM or cryolator directly in my inventory.
---
That's the thing they're not even AFK, you can watch them show up, move around during and leave right after.
---
This is my currently pinned challenge. Thanks!
---
tight squeeze
---
Shit, it gives me 4 50 Cal rounds each kill and in probably use around 8 per kill.
---
This is the most entitled take I think I've seen on daily ops yet.
---
Not everything needs to be or should be handed to you so easily.  If you were guaranteed a rare drop every day that would make getting everything far too easy, even if luck wasn't on  your side and you got duplicates the market would end up saturated soon enough and you could easily enough buy or trade for everything you want.
---
Coming back the next day to try your luck again for a rare drop is part of the allure of the system.  If I got everything I wanted out of the ops so easily I wouldn't touch them again if it weren't for the daily challenge, and even then I wouldn't even have to go for elder for that so I could just half ass it solo.
---
Rare means rare
---
On the other side I bet you never need to craft ammo ;)
---
What one would it be? I didn't my stuff?
---
Here’s how I’d do it - start up your team as a casual team for people to join. Then go into an op and switch it to an ops team (staying in the initial area for the ops won’t start the timer. In the burrows and the burning mine, it’s right at the platform/first room, and the galleria it’s basically the area right before the skylight, but I’m not sure how big the area is on 94). Wait for people to show up if they want (2-5 minutes), and then run it. Once you’re done, switch back to casual. Note that your bonuses will stay maxed throughout this process.
---
On bethseda website. https://help.bethesda.net/app/home
---
Or the government supply drops.
---
Lol it worked, Thanks alot m8
---
Generally speaking every "lower level" random Ive had on a daily ops team has been the ones who stick to the objective the best even if it takes a couple of goes to get Elder rank so theyll be welcome on my team
---
Appalachia not being hit as hard is the excuse Bethesda used to partially remove the wasteland from the Fallout franchise in this installment, to make it more colorful.  
---
It's not lore-friendly, because there was a total nuclear war that devastated the nations involved and turned them into barren wastelands (before pointing at Chernobyl, remember radiation works different in Fallout).   
---
So, **all the previous Fallout games have this setting** (with the exception of the Honest Hearts DLC from F:NV). It's ***the*** Fallout setting.  
---
It's the reason *some* Fallout fans didn't want to play this game in the 1st place (yeah, others found it buggy as hell), as I said... Bethesda got new players but lost others in the process.
---
&gt;... so stuff hasn’t had the time to rust or rot yet in the same manner. 
---
Agreed. Things can't get that rusty in 30 years, but it should be ruined and destroyed...   
---
My hopes are with the upcoming "Bombs drop event" we'll be finally able to see a ***true Fallout-ish Wasteland***.
---
They could glow in green like they do in the beginning
---
Remove the legendary perks that does that?
---
Yea I think I spammed enough emotes to make one of our "team" leave yesterday. Got it done elder just the three of us :)
---
I like to be gratified quickly.
---
Mirelurk kings have always had a chance to spawn at the flooded train yard.Whitesprings pretty much spawns anything.
---
I just want them to bring back the original main menu. The Wastelanders one is so old now.
---
Novel concept but not investing in damage tends to, surprisingly, result in low damage
---
Shotguns out of VATS suck hairy balls. My principal weapon is the Fancy Pump Action. In VATS its usually a 2 or 3 shot kill at most for enemies over lvl 50-60. Out of VATS honestly its garbage. I dont use any shotgun specific perks anymore. Instead I tweaked my build a little to feed AP faster. I still have work to do via the legendary system but Ive at least got it to being as useful as it was before the change
---
They fixed a bug I think that was giving CF 3\* 20% accuracy.
---
I don't think vault 51 in adventure mode should be an active nw waiting lobby, I just think it should be an open space to explore. NW should still be accessed through the main menu.
---
I'm guessing it won't return until next Fasnacht
---
As long as you explain the problem and your request I think both choices are fine, since the Atom Shop issues are more likely to get a human response than an automated one.
---
They have a log that tells them what happened in the shop and when, and they are allowed to refund, so based on my experience it shouldn't be much of an issue to fix your atom balance.
---
i have maxed out shotgunner, demo expert, and bloody mess and my quad explosive double barrel absolutely shreds in and out of vats
---
im assuming you have a magic shotgun to kill them in vats that quickly.
---
I’d take that in a heartbeat. Half-filled health bars at my camp drive me insane.
---
Sorry I was unclear. Last patch I mean update 21.The one before One wasteland and legendaries. I have no legendaries equipped anyways.
---
I mean, both do give unique bonuses over other sets and are guaranteed to be 3-stars. I’m fine with them costing more.
---
There was a bit of miscommunication there apparently. I don't want it to be a lobby in adventure mode either, I'm on the same page as you. All I was saying is that lore wise, like how different parts of the Vault are sealed off for different overseer ranks, you would have to then bring those ranks to adventure mode, otherwise they become pointless if those sealed off areas are just open now. That would be the continuity error that I was talking about. Hope that made more sense.
---
ya continue the fucking over of everyone with the non trade able b.s because of a few ppl who duped things 
---
im already f n tired of getting things on character a that would be great on my character b , but  I have to trash it because someone duped some items months ago!
---
Ahh ok. I honestly wasn't sure what you were saying. Now that I look back I have no clue how I interpreted it the way I did lol.
---
Seriously, solar is excellent. My PA rifleman has a set under his strangler, and it basically has severely reduced my need for stims. If I can finish a fight above 60% health (which is easily shown on the default PA hud or eyeballed), I can just exit and health up in a minute or two. Combined with sun kissed, I rarely need to use radaway or stims except in emergencies.
---
And for teammates, it’s also useful... when they notice it.
---
Atom Shop isn't canon so doesn't really matter, also Appalachia is doomed in the Fallout Lore so doesn't matter either. We should just be able to goof around and have fun.
---
lmao, yep it's pretty crazy. But then again I can't help but feel like it has a charm, the fact that anything can happen. Anyways, I hope it was an entertaining rabbit hole!
---
I dont think it magic. It has the anti armor prefix, 50% limb damage and 50% damage resistence while aiming. Its being in VATS that makes the difference because of the way damage is calculated and treated in VATS.
---
drop a nuke
---
I got sick of waiting so I started doing the government supply drop tapes. At least 2 to 3 players pick the lock on them per server which makes them wanted...I've nearly completed the challenge already.
---
If you did enough damage, sometimes SBQ will show as empty. Wait a few moments and go back to body. loot will be there. Happens to me regulalrly.
---
Kinda how in the silo to open door after replacing cores,  you access computer and have to back out and re access it for options to show.
---
When I want to goof around I don't play Fallout, I play other games.  
---
Likewise, when I play Star Wars Battlefront, I don't want to goof around, I want to shoot down tie fighters or stormtroopers.
---
Hi! Here’s some information on solar and thorn armor:
---
1. Both sets are crafted at 3-stars. Period. No need to get lucky with them to have three effects.
---
2. Both come with a unique set bonus, activated by wearing a full set of the armor.
---
2. A. Solar armor (the one I use) heals you and nearby teammates for 4 hp/sec provided you stay above 60% hp. While the benefit is obvious for your teammates, it also can be good in solo play - just finish a fight at over 60% health, and it’ll al come back. In addition, weaker enemies struggling to outpace the healing at times. Just watch out for rads!
---
2. B. Thorn armor increases your sneaking ability (I believe I saw on a video by angry turtle that it was about 3 points of agility worth, but I don’t remember for sure), gives bleed to melee attacks (which is not that great), and deals damage to your attackers (which is not that good, but it’s something I guess). When combined with the shadowed mods and muffled legs and unyielding, it provides an extremely strong benefit to sneaking, which makes many consider it to be very worth while.
---
3. Mods have to be bought from modus in the armory. Also, it seems that arm specific mods won’t apply properly since I can’t put stabilized on them, though they both could accept muffled for some reason.
---
if you on a team and someone leaves or joins it can react with perks /  mutations / shared perks causing rad loss/ health gain/loss 
---
its annoying
---
Make it a Tuesday thing to do.. 👍
---
... Meanwhile, they're exactly what I've been waiting for since displays were first announced. Different strokes. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Keeps us logged in for longer
---
As someone with two posts on Reddit. 
---
This one and one about Pewdiepie. 
---
I can confirm you do not speak for me.
---
Still the same, turret fire doesn't proc the effect, probably to stop people cheesing the silos and such.
---
I was in Silo Charlie the other night and took a direct hit from an assaultron, it was quite fun to watch my fusion core recharge and health crew back up. Since PA can't have legendary effects, electrical absorb has thrown the PA users a much needed bone.
---
You seem to care a lot about it. Enough to get upset about. Even after reading "off topic".
---
The waterboy does.
---
Leave the glowing effect legendaries already have on the corpses or piles
---
How do you know it's a 3star?
---
\#Microsoft. Tag microsoft in all the problems, hope someone who bought over the company sees these and get someone to fix this game up.
---
Take a workshop, build a small room no windows but a few doors. Set all doors to level 0. 
---
Wanted players for days.
---
I think elder should be 6 minutes or less. And have a much greater chance of reward.
---
While also adding in a paladin rank of 8 minutes with the current elder drop rates
---
Thanks i have sentba ticket now
---
... and any merchant that wanders around. That would be cool, thanks!
---
limb damage is a magic effect.
---
This has been happening while in events. Now, this has been happening regardless of events, just trying to bounce servers to friends servers. I can hear the ambient music of the world I am supposedly in, but nothing but black screen and vault symbol with public teams available. Frustrating!
---
Use the camera to track it down.  It'll say if the legendary's body is in the frame.
---
cool cool but it was you socks, make sure you dont wash the luck off and ware them from now on while playing.... sry just pickin on ya a bit. reminded me of baseball player superstition
---
Did legendary drills exist?
---
same. also find my instigating combat shotgun does what is says outside of VATS. In VATS it's a destroyer.
---
This update has made shotguns better.
---
Skyrim in Powerpoint when?
---

---
im an unarmed build who just stacks Strength. its doing fine and can 1 to 3 hit most enemies still. no low life and no rads. only down side is i cant 1 shot everything.
---
Thank you. I will try that next time. It would be much easier if you just were able to select the team you are in and because "join" is not available, you were able to choose "leave" instead. :D
---
It was on the first iteration of OW on the PTS.
---
Collision course, Harpers Ferry also has  about 10-15 deads npcs with pre war money.
---
unfortunately not. but if they did i would have used them. they where in the drop list along side legendary items but never actually dropped as legendary.
---
With the new infiltrator perk ,I see wanted players in every server now. It should take much to kill them.
---
\+50% limb damage has da magic in VATS.
---
The only better roll would be +33% VATS hit chance as major instead.
---
talking about how characters play on the Foosball table. like the programmers never used one
---
Vendor hop, most people sell mutations for 300 to 500. You can easily buy 1-3 a day that way.
---
hand in claim tickets
---
if it was magic it would perform better than it does out of VATS. In VATS it hots like a truck. Out of it a wet noodle
---
Name? Would love to come see this
---
Vampire weapons or junkie weapons are your best friend if you dont like low health bloody
---
&gt; I hear your new overlords at Microsoft have this figured out for the most part...
---
That would be really nice, any links to that?
---
Are you using consumes? And what about lvl 76+  enemies like high level mutants and bots?
---
So this is what I mean by the fact that an filter doesn’t make a game fallout.
---
Bethesda hasn’t removed the wasteland from the wasteland, Bethesda has made the wasteland part less obnoxiously obvious. The franchise has moved on from FO1, where the publisher needs to label the game “a post nuclear apocalypse adventure” right at the front of the package. Same goes for Fallout 3.
---
We already know that fallout is in fact set in the post apocalypse, we don’t need an orange or green filter for that. It’s sets a very monotonous story telling setting.
---
And the infrastructure and the environment is clearly devastated. Idk what game you have been playing. But go anywhere that isn’t the whitesprings and stuff is falling apart...
---
And Im not going to mention Chernobyl. But I am going to mention New Vegas. If you remove the orange filter. That game would be just as colorful and flush as 76 is.
---
Obviously, it’s set in the desert, but there are still vegetation that belongs to nevada, there is the forest near jacobstown and there is also the canyon in honest hearts DLC.
---
Do you know why? Because The area wasn’t hit as hard by the nuke just like Appalachia...
---
Also, I love the rustic wild west theme in new vegas.
---
set iPresentInterval to 0 in the Fallout.ini file, this disables vsync, Vsync is really strange in this game and does not seem to be working with your monitors hrtz like it did in Fallout 4. This is the most likely reason for your bad Performance. You can find the ini file in Documents/MyGames/Fallout76

Radiation Rumble. Done it today and collect 107 prewar money
---
Thats the thing with magic shotguns, they only work in vats .... out of vats they pointless . I have a mutants bash lvc bouble barel and in vats my level 62 character destroys everything.... out of vats he has to run and hide ....
---
I keep an eye out for weapons and any plans I don't know yet. A 3* Junkies/FFR Gatling Plasma continues to elude me however.
---
best gun in the game imo.
---
i only use vats to either get a lock and then manual aim.
---
OR buff the AP bar, full AP bar, and then proceed to shred with a clip.
---
You start off by saying you are not in a group but at the end you say join a group.I do understand what you are saying though.My point was that if you are making a group for more xp purposes then you are making an ops group for said bonus xp.Many players have played this game for nearly two years as a solo experience.They are either just use to playing like that or just don’t want to group to do it.Also some players can solo elder rank by themselves.Once they have elder completed they have no reason to run it again unless they are nice and trying to help others out.I have also seen many posts of people just not liking the ops or caring about the rewards.You add those things up plus the players that have quit the game recently and that ends up in a lack of available players.
---
Prime cut in the bog. I didn't even try  for this challenge and got it in no time.
---
That’s why I quit and cancelled my 1st.
---
That cat would be a hero for crying out loud!
---
I would trade you my spare one, but the plan isnt tradable :(
---
You missed it it was here 2 weeks or so ago
---
Me too, with how hard they nerfed melee I decided to take a much needed break.
---
**HE'S A HERO FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!!!**
---
Bullshit
---
What do you expect with char 2 though? At level 17 you should feel fairly weak with a small amount of perks. With the 88 sounds like you might want to specialise on a weapona bit more with more perk related cards to the weapon or maybe add stuff like adenanline and bloody mess
---
He' a hero for crying out loud!
---
Idk wtf is going on with hack and slash and collateral damage but they’re definitely finicky sometimes doing too little sometimes doing too much.
---
Set shadow distance to low and compare .)
---
That's a something a commie would say. Mr. PEBBLES is a hero for crying out loud!
---
Tony who?!  
---
MR PEBBLES IS A HERO FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!
---
duh, I meant where anyone said or hinted at that this is coming to FO76
---
Because a Quad Explosive shotgun is that easy to get... By the time you can barter your way to one or are lucky enough to have one dropped you'll no longer worry about lvl 75+ enemies.
---
He deserves to be the protagonist of a game about being a goddamn hero for crying out loud!
---
I don't even have collateral damage equipped &amp; enemies just randomly explode no matter what melee weapon I use.
---
Yeah that’s how these kind of updates work with games unfortunately.Only thing you can do is try adjust perks and gear and hope you can make up at least some of the lost damage and resistance.This game seems a bit more extreme though.I don’t remember other games I have played being as large of a divide as this one.I agree with you though I am not a big fan of it either.Maybe if they had a middle ground between this one and the original it would have been better.
---
I volunteer as tribute.
---
It’s pretty low chance at the early levels so if it looks like your hack and slash isn’t proccing that’s probably it. I have hack n slash maxed and collateral level 3 and they both proc often, it’s so satisfying one shorting a wave of enemies with a melee weapon cleave+explosion
---
I was missing 1. Decided to check the airport. There was a crate from last event and fuck me, 100 pre war dollars.
---
&gt;Laika 
---
At the start of weightlessness, her pulse rate decreased. It took three times longer than after a centrifuge ride on the ground to return Laika's heartbeat to pre-launch values, an indication of the stress she was suffering.  
---
This wouldn't occur to Mr. Pebbles though. Why? Because you guessed it! He's a hero for CRYING OUT LOUD!
---
&gt; automatically picks locks at player camps
---
Then you've read a hoax.
---
It does not do it automatically, the problem is that the text is not always in red and the warning is not always present.
---
I have a quite low level character but join in the fights enthusiastically, trying to hit everything at least once to feel useful and gain XP.  
---
Thanks for all the high levels who are actually helpfull and there as a big brother! Kudos!
---
He's a hero for crying out loud!!
---
I love how they and insects scare me now if i see a mob. I had a defend event at the Thunder mountain workshop four waves of crickets, best fight I've had since one wasteland dropped, died a couple of times, it was great.
---
I am deathly serious. Why would I joke about a hero? (for crying out loud.)
---
If that's what you got from that statement, then I apologize. That was me just saying to Bethesda that their new (to be) owners already have the software they could implement. Not that it's been said they're going to. Just that it's be nice if they added it.
---
because they recycled it from nuka world DLC
---
Commie.  
---
But you better believe if you ate Mr. Pebbles meat that he would taste DELICIOUS. Why? BECAUSE HE'S A HERO FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!
---
It's there since wastelander. Neat place.
---
I first join a team and enter the DO, wait a minute and when no one is coming I exit the team and make my own. Then I wait again a minute, if no one is coming, screw them .)
---
“Nerfed melee” somebody’s gotta invest time in their build; I’m one-shotting 10 ghouls in a single swing and watching as their bodies soar from my explosive fury
---
Well, the turrets are designed to sense hostile intent, and the merchants that wander in plan to rip you off by selling you damaged goods at ridiculously high prices, and the turrets are just trying eliminate that threat to your Cap purse.
---
We have Raider pa and at least four skins for Raider izing other PA. We have two Communist skins. Don't be so negative about celebrating THE FIRST CAT IN SPACE!
---
Spoken like a true patriot!
---
Well they just used most of the assets from fallout 4.Some of the weapons they did not even bother with much in the way of mods or proper scaling.So I think the simple answer is that it exists because it already did in the previous game.
---
I have it maxed out.
---
corpses yes,
---
meat/scrap/goo/ash piles seems to be consistent at the place of death ~~if your willing to wait like 5 mins doing nothing for your trash 1 star rolling pin~~
---
Any true patriot would love this. Mr. Pebbles paved the way for space adventure for all humanity making him a HERO FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

There is a Chinese base near whitesprings so I'm not surprised they spawned there
---
Buzz who? Neil what? Silence your propaganda, commie! We're here to celebrate the first cat in space....a hero for CRYING OUT LOUD!!
---
Stuffed animals aren't enough! Give me a cat companion wearing Mr. Pebbles costume that looks and acts like a goddamn HERO FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!
---
It's your patriotic duty!!
---
I did not know that... thank you.
---
Because if it didn't exist then people would ask for it. Beth probably knew virtually no one would use it so why bother with anything but the most basic port from the earlier game?
---
I dont see the vault 79 one ever
---
Beyond that? Beyond that he's a hero for CRYING OUT LOUD!
---
What do you mean?
---
He deserves the world. After all... he's a hero FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!
---
I get something similar in Whitespring if I'm killed by a ghoul and respawn some colors are enhanced and others are muted and there's this weird whitewashed look to the interior (exteriors look fine).
---
That's how hack and slash works.
---
The best I can put it is have a Ducati in a movie, but have it sound like a Kawasaki. Having a American Muscle car, but having it sound like a Italian V8. Its the details that make the immersion.
---
You bet your red, white and blue behind it would be awesome, patriot!  Why? Because he's a hero for CRYING OUT LOUD!
---
Must be my undies cuz i wear sandals w/o socks
---
The only meat I want to serve up is in honor of Mr. Pebbles. Why? Because he's a HERO FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!
---
Well, the Western Revolver was traditionally a Colt .45, so its slightly different. But yeah, they function identically in game. Im going to be starting a new FO4 playthrough as a western cowboy type and will use the Western Revolver from that game.
---
For luck? Crit savvy, serendipity, class freak, starched genes and bloody mess is a good combo. It wasn't mentioned but if you have a spare point tenderiser is really nice to. Adrenanline is still pretty good as well as gun fu
---
maybe submit a ticket on that too...
---
I didn’t even know you could get a refund until recently. Man I still could have so many atoms if I  did that with some stuff. I purchased this bundle op mentioned too, will definitely submit a ticket for that one. You think I could get a second refund for the communist bundle too? Bunker is way too fucking small now and the fences are still a pain in the ass to place.
---
Hm, I'm only like level 6 so far. Haven't gone to any other places really than the starting area, and I haven't died yet. So I dono if that is what's messing with mine or not D:
---
Just tickled me to be honest - I wasn't like stalking your post history - just reading through some old threads in light of current events!
---
No need to apologize. I was just hoping that Beth finally saw the light and moved away from white- and blacklisting processes w/o thinking about renamed ones.
---
Was there much difference between the western and the .44 in Fallout 4 though? 
---
I never played nuka world so missed this gun. 
---
I get they recycle pretty much everything (except my precious deliverer). 
---
But why was this gun even designed, pitched and approved?
---
The problem is the RNG system used by many games is one of the more random ones, but it tends to be streaky at the extremes. Its why a lot of times in FFXIV, people joke how "if it isn't 100%, it's 0%" while on the opposite end, you could only have a 5% chance of success and it'll happen 3 times in a row.
---
So you'll have droughts of no procs and then suddenly, several in a row.
---
I'm saving Far-Flung Fireworks for last, if I use it at all. Still not sure if the random chance of explosion on kill is worth using over a big QOL perk like Infiltrator.
---
These guys running round with low health are using bloody weapons where their damge goes up with how much health they are missing. If you don't like the missing health the biggest hitter after that is junkies where you can be whatever health if you have 5 addictions. Vampire gives you health back as you attack.
---
tbh not even worth the scrip if you're maxed out and storing it. Too heavy. I'd vendor or drop it.
---
Damage cards on the one thing I refuse to scrap for the most part. Mostly because it takes 9 levels to get them back if you get rid of them.
---
This is also my take. I  work in the computer industry and I also mod my games heavily. Every time I take a look under the hoods or saw someone write about how a Bethesda game does something, mainly FO4 and FO76, it has the hallmarks of a money got cut had to delivery kind of project. The second problem is the small team. With FO76 they might have slightly grew in numbers, but their numbers were around a hundred (for BGS) a few years ago. That is extremely small for a studio with such large-scale projects. CDPR which is considered a small studio has more than four hundred people working on CP2077 alone. For example Ubisoft Montreal has more than 3500 people, even if 1/5 works on games or a single game that's 700+ people.
---
Overall BGS could do well with the money and more importantly with the expertise of the Microsoft people. The is engine is long overdue for an architectural change (total rewrite looking at the state of things), because all the things they do can be done much more efficiently today and MS's produces lot of well engineered and high-performance stuff. I would love for example if we could use C# as the scripting language in a Bethesda game, probably aren't gonna happen, but still that would make the game even more open to modding than before.
---
Np they are pricey to make yourself with 17k per recipe but with player vending you can get all the ones you need for easily 3k or less. I just can't remember what they are classed as for camp searches I just know its not medicine
---
While I've seen the stat issues myself on the effects screen, I never checked the actual special screen. I'll have to check it out next time I'm on.
---
I do know that Lock and Load breaks every time I exit power armor and I'm forced to take it off and put it on again.
---
Jesus I hadn’t bothered with bullion since I had everything I wanted. Time to bust out the lunchboxes!
---
If its that hard for you to kill something look at your build
---
It’s just weapon tier scaling. Single Action, .44 Western. Same reason their so many rifles. Just branching up the tree with the next one being strong in some form of stats.
---
Hmm so you haven't updated it after that or do you mean it's still a problem?
---
Are you using Ammosmith and Super Duper? That will help a ton.
---
I don't mind, at least they're a little more of a challenge and not a useless inconvenience. More xp, etc.
---
Makes them being a pain a little more worth it
---
IS THAT SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS ME TO KICK THEIR ASS?
---
I know a good way for Bethesda to prove your theory really quickly. Shut down Fallout 1st and make all of its features core except for the monthly atoms. Its existence is an embarrassment for everyone involved.
---
Right. I'm saying the robots in Watoga won't put up a fight so they should be easier to kill than random robots running around the wasteland. Or by "put up a fight" you mean that they are more durable now and so will use more ammo?
---
You’ve got pretty much a 95% chance to get a reward per day. I’ve managed to get two in the one run. If they made it so you can keep going until you get your daily reward they would need to serious lower the chance. I prefer having to only do one run and having a really high chance over having as many attempts as I want but at small chance.
---
Good point.
---
But then wouldn’t the reasonable thing to do be to make all the custom skins for the top tier gun though? 
---
F76 pistols baffle me.
---
Been saying this for over a year. The drill along with other tool based weapons need non combat functions
---
I wish the enemies scaled to the highest player in the area. I want to make lvl 3000 liberators spawn outside of vault 76.
---
"of ww2"
---
I haven't kept up, but which lmg today has a higher firerate than the MG42 with 1500 rpm?
---
Actually after looking I did not see the single action listed for fallout 4 so I guess it was not in there.I think the western was added to have a higher tier Damage pistol as it does do more than the revolver.It just looks like they added the single action to give more pistols in the game but did not bother to make it stand out.So basically its just a lazy throw in weapon to make it look like there are more pistol options lol.
---
How else are they gonna get you to look at the Atom shop if you aren't logging in every day?  It's cancerous really.
---
That's weird cause meat week is the best event for afk. 3 barrels and 3 spit roast and they work before the event proper starts.
---
THERE’S NOTHING I LIKE MORE THAN MAKING SOME OTHER POOR BASTARD DIE FOR HIS COUNTRY!
---
The odds of that are super slim if he’s getting the elder finish time. I’ve only missed out once and I’ve got a double reward on one day so I’ve kinda got one everyday.
---
It’s an 80% chance!
---
That’s pretty high for a drop chance.
---
IMO
---
Handmade wins assault rifle class.
---
Wait, does more people joining in slow down the uplink until everyone is in the area (x4)?
---
Not yet.
---
I prefer that too, but it would be nice to be able to run it again if you don’t get a drop.
---
The problem I’m more having is just getting the same stuff over and over
---
there are not enough legendary slots for posion resistance that only works for litterally 1 enemy thats not an insect. (mirelurk queen)
---
No, it speeds it up. I was saying that it didn't get done solo because people joined.
---
Note that mutation serums come under the “misc” counter when you hover your cursor over a player’s vendor icon on the world map. It’ll be in the Aid category in your inventory though
---
\+1 mate.  
---
But they would have to adress energy weapon overall. They hit like wet noodle :D
---
Pistols aren’t really wholly popular. Aside from a spoon full of people myself included. Why make skins for a weapon your going to use like 5% of the time. 
---
Pistol builds are okay. I have one based on the Big Iron. It only uses .44 revolvers so I get to see skins. But it’s just business nature I’m afraid. That’s why rifles, heavy and shotguns have tons of skins. Hell even PA has skins and it’s not even legendary
---
I guess so. Blueprint 2 posts one on top of the other. You should be able to place it almost anywhere.
---
And cut the mods that set it apart (although they're interchangeable with the .44)
---
I have full health and a one star Fixer (mutant slayer). I can kill most enemies easily since I’ve got all the commando damage perk cards.
---
I was originally hoarding them for use with Cola Nut, but it kinda became a hassle to use, so I switched to Field Surgeon with First Aid. Then I sold most of them off. I plan on keeping one of each to display eventually. I just have a bad habit of making my camps too big, so I never have enough room put stuff in display cases. :(
---
The guns are perfect to level up, but that's it.
---
I dont expect a full energy weapon overhaul, if the alien blaster base damage can hit even 75 to 100 I'd be happy.
---
litterally 0 effort
---
Somebody got on the mic while I was scrambling around trying to get critter chunks and said “I hope you guys can hear me because were going to fail. Because You guys suck. You SUCK.” And I got sad lmao
---
F76 baffles everyone. The skins could absolutely be applicable on both weapons because they're completely interchangeable
---
I have a B3315crit combat shotgun, it absolutely shreds anything in vats.
---
There must be bad weapons so the others can shine.   
---
:/
---
It purely depends on the gun. I started using a plasma flamer and I consistently walk out of daily ops with at the minimum of 500 plasma carts. I find the build matters too. I’m a sniper so normally I waste little in terms of ammo. And with the damage changes I still make out with a good amount of ammo per kill/reward.
---
I lost a 3 star legendary ghoul in the water one day. Even used that camera
---
My bowels haven’t got another one loaded yet. The toilet got blocked anyway...
---
Get used to it. It's the rain effects and it would have been better if they removed the feature from the game
---
My favorite rifle that I've personally owned was a Two Shot Increase VATS Accuracy Reduced VATS cost. Until I switched to a heavy build that gun got me through some hard times. And I got it for 600 caps off a vendor when someone sold it to the Whitespring Station bot.
---
I renamed it Overseer's Guardian and I will be displaying it on a weapon rack to honor its service to me.
---
Yeah. I think there might be some perk cards will crash it. My born survivor has the same problem too, it doesn’t work properly, I hurt myself to 10% health left and waited for 2 minutes and nothing happened. (For someone says I’m in the cool down)
---
No yeah, thank you for the advice but this is exactly what i'm talking about when i say i tryed the "blueprint glitch" 👍.
---
It tells me that "there's an object in the way...
---
I haven’t seen a single person on barrel or spit, it’s baffling. Last time they were constantly full. How has everyone forgotten??? A couple of times there was literally half a dozen lvl 200+ people standing around waiting for the event. Incredibly frustrating.
---
I'd love the shoulder mounted machine gun too
---
That applies to team leader, done and dont want to, change party type or begone.
---
I'm taking a break while waiting for the 'fallout' from 1WL to be smoothed out. 
---
I got all the rewards from the last 2 meat weeks so don't feel the urge to log in just for it.
---
Lol. I can imagine coming out of the vault and seeing a trail of dead bodies all dressed in the same vault suit as me. 
---
Would I keep going in that direction? Or turn back and plead for the vault door to open back up for me
---
You may find a 50 cal at a vendor, but iirc bloodied explosive plasma is legacy, so trade only.
---
Trade onlys
---
From my black book of builds: 
---
The chef- flamers, shishkebab, rolling pins. Runs a butcher shop. 
---
The Bosmer - cannibal archer. Berserkers/chameleon, throwing knives
---
Yusuke Urameshi from Yu Yu Hakusho - unarmed/ salvaged Assaultron head
---
The slayer - bows/crossbow, two handed melee. 
---
The pirate - blackpowder weapons revolutionary sword and Broadsider. 
---
Just to name a few.
---
Bloodied explosive Gatling plasma I think is a legacy item? So you probably wouldn’t get that for 30k. 50cal maybe within the 30k budget. Have you tried posting on the market ?
---
You're definitely not finding a be plasma in a vendor. And are super unlikely to find a be 50cal in one. And on the trading subs you won't be getting either for any amount of caps
---
ooh...that's a beauty. 750 hours still looking for that.
---
closest i got is Instigating 33 90rw
---
Yeah you’ll probably have to trade for those rolls even on a 50.cal, love your u/ btw.
---
I use 2 nvme ssd for 7000MB/s but i still think a lot of the loading time is from internet/server traffic.
---
Seems like a more realistic and immersive wasteland scenario to me.
---
I’ve got bloody mess and adrenaline and the maxed weapon trees for all the types got lucky while levelling. tbh I’ve always struggled on that char unless I’m useing my handmade the new leg ammo card helps a bit but everything is so spongey now. 
---
And with char two I was not expecting one wasteland to more than half my damage on similar level targets I get that it’s weak as I’ve not got 40% dmg from perks and my lv15 10mm isn’t amazing to begin with. I’m thinking I’m gonna either have to only play the PA guy or I’m gonna have to make a melee char possibly in PA now we have marathoner for Power armour in the leg perks .
---
Play daily ops, it's quite a rare reward tho I believe. You have one shot at a rare item once a day(I think?) or once the daily resets so good luck
---
Rare chance when completing daily ops
---
Ah the daily ops, May i ask what that is ? Haven’t played for ages
---
But it's not raining D:
---
Agreed, last season it was a grind for one character. this season I can jump easily between two of my characters to do them and they take an hour to do with me still grinding for my daily raiders rep.
---
I actually didnt realise the Watoga robots didnt aggro if you attack them once friendly. Ive never been game enough to try it. So TIL. Even so yeah, clubbing a high/max level bot to death with a makeshift weapon 1000 times isnt high on my list of fun activities. Specially when the award is only 40 atoms.
---
Yeah it sure was!
---
I’ve been using a executioner’s faster fire rate for a good week now. It’s my go to for daily ops. 306 shots per reload and most mobs there drop at times 15+ carts. If everyone is hitting stuff you can loot more bodies and walk out with what you started with. 
---
Anti armour is probably the upper tier effect to have. As it’s not affect an outside source like junkie’s, vats or something you have to build into.
---
Filters: I don't know why you keep coming back to this point, I haven't mentioned it a single time. That's not what I'm talking about.  
---
New Vegas: Yeah, but it looks barren, buildings look decrepit... except for some specific places: Honest Hearts (not the Savage Divide, not the Big Empty, not Sierra Madre, not the New Vegas) and the Forest (high up in the Mountains).  
---
Why? Because **Obsidian picked the right time and the right place for a Fallout setting,** like Bethesda did when they created Fallout 3 in the bombed ruins of Washington DC (Capital Wasteland). Again, here flush vegetation is the exception: Oasis and Point Lookout.  
---
Oh, I think I know where the disagreement is and I think Bethesda made the same mistake...  
---
People complaining about the filters (green for F3, orange for FNV) doesn't mean you have to link it to the environment. ie: you can create a **barren** wasteland without using a filter to make it look ruined and beautiful and you can "move on" without changing this...
---
Allow me to use a last analogy (This time a bit more silly XD):   
---
If you have a restaurant called "Moncho's" and you cook the most amazing traditional grilled beef steaks and after 20 years you change it to a more casual modern cooking style keeping beef steaks on the menu...  
---
Don't be surprised if former customers stop showing up whilst at the same time you get more casual customers who like modern cooking. Also, don't be surprised if the ones who left and liked your restaurant start saying "this is the not Moncho's". Also, don't be surprised if you start seeing "spherifications" and fancy salads with exotic fruits from Asia in the menu... ;-P
---
the only concern i have is ..........i am too damn happy about it
---
Somehow i 1 shot everything with my 2shot tesla or bloodied plasma flamer rifle. I am a single shot bloodied stealth rifle build.
---
Nevada is barren because it is an literal dessert.
---
Appalachia isn’t barren because like nevada, I wasn’t hit as hard by the nukes, but still has a lush vegetation.
---
Ok well then I guess its a magic weapon. I didnt realise it was or that shotguns could be affected. I thought it only applied to certain heavy weapons. TIL
---
Thanks this is the Info I needed at least I can start letting go of that BE plasma now as ill never get one
---
Thank you for the answer!
---
I run a bloodied stealth commando, it’s perfect because of the suppressor.
---
I think I traded a J3315 handmade for it that I picked up for 600 caps.
---
Huh i can do daily ops multiple times in a row.
---
They basically removed the rpg-aspect of the game with last patch. No idea why, they know from elder scrolls that scaling enemies is unpopular design, why did they fo76 suddenly needed it?
---
Is it on reddit? I'm not super familiar with this space and thanks for the info
---
No bloodied in NW..
---
OMG! You're so right!   
---
Bethesda clever fuckers how wrong I was! XD
---
PS: wait, so do the turrets turn on Bethesda staff playing F76? xD
---
Okay thank you for your answer at least I can give up the dream, and the madly fast travelling around the map searching!
---
I followed your exact steps and all I got was a meat clever plan. This is why I don’t believe in science or that the earth is round!
---
Heavy weapons, power armor are good for high health builds. The dps of heavy weapons is pretty good, decent enough without Bloodied or Junkies, especially if you get an AA gun with FFR or a "Magic" damage gun. Most things just tickle me and even bosses don't hurt that bad- at least nothing a stim can't take care of.
---
Biggest issue is ammo economy, which is somewhat alleviated by the new ammo factory legendary perk.
---
I think it’s bugged.
---
Mobs are coded a little funky. They are programmed to seek out the the location that triggered the “caution” flag. Not you directly. If you shoot and move you can actually watch them chase the trail you would make. Once in that sweet spot ranch your cover is blown of course. However mobs that “leave” the battlefield radscorpions, mole rats and sometimes scorched beasts can sometimes reset their detection meters. Meaning they’ll spot you immediately. 
---
Follow through actives on the next shot regardless of situation. Providing your in at least caution. You can hit other mobs that aren’t targeting you to start the perk “over”.  It also seems like the perk can’t/can proc if your holding the fire button down or by trigger pull or not give you the effect. Best bet is to burst a few rounds to confirm the damage is going up for the amount you have in the perk
---
Just because it is common does not mean it is good.
---
I hope too, and I hope it's available for ***all genders***, not just girls.  
---
I wish there were more raider-ish and punk-ish items in the Atom shop... like there used to be in previous fallout tittles, where could pick punk-ish or 50-ish hair styles...
---
Definitely agree some weapons need a lot of love, for rifle characters its like handmade/fixer or go home.
---
Yeah a Ve gat plasma might be out of reach. Took me a year of trading to get one.
---
Head to r. /. M. A. R. K. E. T. 7.6 with out the periods for trading. You can probably find at least a 1* bloodied 50cal for caps to hold you over untill you can trade for a better one
---
We have essentialy legendary showels, pickaxes(and cursed ones). Would be cool drill too
---
There's nothing like that currently
---
You’re not the only one. It’s been happening with sbq and earl with me. Doing enough dmg is not an issue for me. Someone else mentioned waiting a few min and checking again. I think I’ll try that next time it happens to me.
---
Thank you for the answer I was dreading hearing it but it makes sense. Im at the point In  the game now where only a gun is going to make a difference in my dps so I guess I'll have to adjust my expectations cheers!!
---
lol how perfect is that cover
---
They shouldnt scale at all in the majority of areas. If i explore an area im not supposed to be in yet i should struggle, if i go back to the starting area i should barely get touched by the enemies - just like in any other rpg. 
---
Whats the point of leveling up when everything just levels up with me? Whats the point of having supermutant when scorched are just as strong? Its terrible design both from an rpg as well as immersion perspective.
---
Not true, if you’re in a decent team it works. Don’t forget enemies are now scaled as well. I had a team today, 3 were 100+ and the 4th was level 29.
---
Yep, physics are handled client-side, so each individual console and PC will be different. Once the body turns into a meat pile it's in the same spot for everyone.
---
I'm also unarmed. Vampire FFS boxing glove. Combine that with Solar scout armor which gives +4 HP per second and i can just punch anything to death. Robots, SBQ (when she lnds), death claws, Earl. No problems what so ever. Might take slightly longer than a bloodied build, but I'm not dying, nor is my health going below 60%, meaning I am a great teammate since the solar also heals team members
---
Yeah I got to that point with my stealth build and got blessed by rolling a J2525 handmade, what platform are you on? I’d like to help if I can.
---
I agree scaling is a bit broken.  
---
Level 100 molerat swarms don't make any sense and it's not fun... plus the sense of progression for low level characters is non-existent. All the enemies you face have your level, it looks like you are doing nothing (I've a level 137 sniper and a level 31 heavy no-PA chars)
---
I sell both for 1000, but the fancy shotgun is very rare, better to find a trade than sell.
---
My junkies combat shotgun loves them. Just vats the little blighters, it's a one shot bonanza. 😊
---
are people really having this much trouble? I'm still putting level 50s down in 3-6 shots
---
A rather large patch was just released that completely reworked damage for players as well as enemy leveling, so don’t be surprised if you return to find enemies being a bit spongier than you remember
---
This is the better answer.
---
Just more relevant junk would be nice, none of the events give you lead and steel
---
I’m adding in options. And spending scrip on legendary modules to avoid wasting it on a level 40 roll when OP is so close is a viable choice.
---
Guys quick question - since one wasteland dropped , so I need to be level 50 to join daily ops? Or does it scale? Thanks !
---
Sorry i meant plans for the power armor pieces, there’s a data mine worksheet for all the treasure maps loot somewhere on this sub
---
You technically have 3 chances per Daily Ops. A 5% chance on Tier 1 rewards, 10% at Tier 2, and 80% at Tier 3. Getting Elder rolls all 3 of these at once though so it counts all 3 at the same time
---
Yes there's a legendary perk called take one for the team that allows people to murder other players without them initiating pvp, put pacifist mode turned on unless you want to pvp
---
Yes but what if Dogmeat ancestors originated in Appalachia and migrated west over 180 years...now thats a DLC I would buy.
---
i'm on PS4 and will be crafting a big bulk for myself over next few days, I can spare you a few thousand
---
I’ll say it again.  Make the flare gun highlight corpses meat piles, ashes metal piles, goo puddles.
---
They made the game into a chore. Which was probay the intention. Games as a service suck ass.
---
As someone who likes modding, I'm triggered by atrocious texture quality of atomic shop items  and seasonal rewards. C'mon bethesda, it's not 2001 anymore.
---
Are you bloodied? If you use class freak that ap loss is a drop in the ocean.
---
You can display weapons but its rather picky on what it wants.
---
this isnt really true though. Level 35 Super Mutant Butchers are a lot stronger than level 35 bloatflies.
---
too*
---
&gt; Nevada is barren because it is an literal dessert... 
---
Hence, it's a good setting for a fallout game, like a Washington DC. Keeps the Fallout vibe and makes your life easy when developing the game... Companies pick the settings for their games, you know?  :-D
---
&gt; And you are completely ignoring ash heap, mire, the bog or toxic valley here. All of which are most definitely wastelands of different kinds... 
---
I'm not ignoring the Ash Heap and Toxic Valley (actually that's where my CAMPs are at), but the rest are too big for the map they're in (compare them to Oasis or Zion).
---
&gt; It really seems to come down to filters in these conversations. 
---
Yeah, we all have some filters... (if I understood what you meant here). Like I said, some people will like your new restaurant, some former customers won't... but if you approve the new modern-stype Moncho's (F76) don't complain the have fancy Asian salads (Specs ops armor)
---
i know - in the category of heavy weapons only the 5mm ammo gains a plus because you get 10-60 per kill
---
Whats the .50 cal skin?
---
Idk I feel one wasteland was the best thing that happened for high leveling. During meat week you could prob level up from 300 at least once every 2 prime meat events. The bad update was nerfing weapons and perk buffs to make it double trouble with max level enemies and half the damage you output before.
---
Both are more likely to be acquired by trade. 
---
The BE GP is a legacy and will probably require 2 non legacy god rolls. Think along the lines a a B2525 handmade level of trade item. 
---
The BE 50 cal can drop by RNG but is a high level weapon. You may be able to find a 2* in a vending machine but most of these weapons will be trade only. 
---
Your best bet is to try other reputable trade subs to find a weapon. Neither of these weapons are easily gotten and will require that you have a large batch of potential trades for the owner to look through. It would be really rare for someone to take caps for the 50cal and unheard of for the GP.
---
STOP INTERRUPING THE PROCESS!!!!!
---
You're a waste*
---
You tried it twice ? I got it on my second run. If you only did it once than you didnt do it right .
---
It happens when you never technically join the event. You need to check that the quest is active.
---
If you die you drop your junk because you are not in a public event.
---
Both weapons trade only, the legacy Gatling is a fairly top tier trade legacy. It is possible to trade your way to both but it will take a little work . Visit the trading site to familiarise yourself with what other weapons and armour are fairly desirable but not legacy and Use your caps  to buy any of those you see in vendors and then start trading up. Vending machines are swimming in legendaries now. It’s also surprising what someone will be willing to trade you for lesser weapon with specific rolls that they really want , also every now and then ‘new’ items become highly desirable , the safari croc backpack plan I got from someone for a bunch of .556 ammo then got me a very rare outfit and I saw someone traded an explosive legacy Gatling for the new special ops outfit just because they wanted one now rather than in a month or so when their everywhere. For the .50 cal with decent second or 3rd rolls should be relatively easy to trade for

I pick up all the pre war money usually. I use it to make gunpowder. Lol
---
What system do you play on? If you’re on Xbox I’ll give you a fixer plan for free
---
I never understood why they don't just give them that green glow when they spawn in with when they die. The code is already, not that I'm a programmer or understand the complexity of coding a game.
---
have you equipped any kind of ammo releated perk cards? Because i get only 4-16 (average \~ 8) per kill and sometimes its to less for the flamer barrel to get a positive bilance
---
Several patches ago they changes the scaling in the Ash Heal and Toxic valley to make them more low-level friendly. All that went out the window.
---
Forest, Ash Heap, and Toxic Valley shouldn't scale 1:1 with player level. Let the new players feel like gods at level 50 fighting level 30-40 scorched, so they're confident enough to explore the Savage Divide, only to get smacked down to earth by level 60 yao guai. 😏
---
Serum recipes. 3 only left to buy to have them all.
---
How so? What constitutes as the game's "true score"?
---
Plans and meds I can see... But why ammo? I purposely hold onto any ammo I get and convert it. Even with having ammosmith max, super duper max and 2nd rank ammo factory I still use the converter. You can never have enough of that shit
---
We have a nice community, but not a clever one
---
You're welcome! I hope it helps! 🙂
---
It's not about being able to do the event. The reward list is different for characters with a level under 50.
---
*Fallout 76: Directed by Michael Bay*
---
I guess some people think that way. Although it is illogical imo.
---
I think Appalachia is the absolute best map in the series so far. And it absolutely is a wasteland just like the other maps, you’d really have to glare over the obvious if you really think that it isn’t fallout because it has more trees than rest of the games.
---
And West Virginia is really under appreciated in media anyway.
---
Funny, I unlocked the flamingo because I have re built my camp to be a random spread of stuff with plenty of colour from different light sources, I liked the led? lights.
---
Yes the power armor skins are more than a 'bit' comical. But I always thought Fallout power armor was goofy just by the way it moves. 
---
Imagine a Crysis type Nano Suit in the game, discovered deep in some hidden vault science area only after a completing a gruelling new vault quest, I would like that.
---
I realised that after I posted, but its only some plans I think you cannot access until level 50.
---
That's one good thing that came out of it; level 50 heavy machine gun turrets. Watched 4 level 50 scorched run towards my camp entrance, only for each of them to get double-tapped.
---
Ya I’ve had this happen, I’m in the area but it doesn’t register that I’m in the event for some reason. I usually run a bit away then fast travel to the event pop up on the map
---
Maybe it was overlapped between two robots?
---
OK, think I understand, boy they make these things complicated, at least for me 🤷‍♂️
---
I would like them to be a challenge. Would like to do more than run to location, hold x, wait, repeat. Something more like the vault raids where you actually have a bit of a challenge and some tasks to do. Without all the issues that the vault raids had though!  The daily ops is mind numbingly easy in its current state.
---
I swear it's like a bot made this game
---
I’ve never done this event actually, that makes me want to try it out lol
---
This is why aliens have never taken over the world. Yet.
---
Any explosive laser rifle especially be. Can be real useful when there are crowds of enemies.
---
*You stink! You are a senile bucktoothed old mummy with bony girl arms and you smell like an elephant's butt!*
---
I have played many characters, and I wanted to try a new one after one wasteland, just for the sake of it. Let's say the difficulty now for a new player is over the top. If I hadn't my high level chars to get leveled weapons/armors and ammunitions I wouldn't even try.
---
My advice to you is to put the game on hold till Bethesda rework the balance because, obviously, they didn't think things out. They've parctically made the leveling experience a total chore.
---
Daily Ops is the new, sort of randomly generated mission that came with this patch. Currently it's only one mission objective: protect some signal uplinks and then kill the boss. You get increasing reward chances based on how fast you finish the mission.
---
The enemy type changes every day and they also get some bonus modifiers to make it more challenging. 
---
Easiest way to do them is to team up with a public team. If you're undergeared, you can contribute by staying close to the signal boosters. There's a speed bonus when people stick around the booster.
---
Yeah. That'll encourage them to participate in your daily ops team...
---
You’re telling me, it can get super confusing when they add changes but don’t list everything clearly in the patch notes. I’m not fully awake right now so my math could be off but I think it’s like a .16 chance you get 3 rare rewards at the same time if you get elder run on your first go
---
Sounds just like my real life workplace
---
Ok I will do just that thank you very much
---
Signs and letters. It's neon lights. It has a chance to be in the vendor, Graham can also have it
---
So I’ve noticed if you have rank one born survivor it won’t work if your rads are lower than 20%. So your health needs to be a bit over 20 or it won’t always trigger
---
"What Rads?"
---
Every star is worth the cost in perk coins.  +300 rad resist, -6 Rads/sec at max rank is truly powerful.
---
You could probably get a bloodied explosive 50 cal if you rolled the purveyor enough but as others said the plasma is legacy. Thats still not impossible to get though if you get enough high tier weapons and trade.
---
I gotta admit I kicked someone from my ops team i started up yesterday. So i started one to do the ops, great stuff three joined. I waited 2 min so people could finish what they are doing then jumped in. I then waited in the starter room for the others to join, using come to emote to show good to go. 2 showed up whilst 1 guy didn't, we waited another 5 emoting for them to join, I checked the map a couple of times they were just at their camp the whole time so we just started then we had enough. However just as we were finishing the group of before the end boss appears this cheeky git only then decides to port in so wasnt afaik just after a free lunch.at this point I was more annoyed at the fact he kept us all waiting whilst wanting to leech last second, so a kick he received ;)
---
As good as the plasma for room clearing?
---
I had the same issue when i purchased that new moskito light. Got the same message and the 500 atoms were gone but the light wasnt purchased. But when i did relog in the light was purchsed and everything was good
---
Can your charachter dance on a tabletop whilst swinging their hips seductively ?
---
It’s worth doing honestly especially with a melee weapon, U find the mask &amp; then just put candy in pumpkin buckets that attract the ghouls, It’s easy &amp; u may get a decent legendary one day doing it. Just bare in mind that wearing the mask means other players can attack u
---
Neon letters - it’s a standard plan. Plans at vendors aren’t always available. Try again on a different server and it might be there
---
Ok, that made my day again
---
Nope. Get some caps. 
---
Alternatively you can spend hours on end grinding the RNG and earn them yourself.
---
They didn't outright say it, but it was left out of the community roadmap they released, so I think it's fairly safe to assume it's not happening...
---
Plasma is dangerous for bloodied builds but it wouldn't do as good with spamming as the plasma. The rifle can do you very accurate beams which is good for tight spaces where you dont want one of the projectiles from the plasma blowing you up.
---
I miss this, too.
---
The upside is that events in the forest region are more rewarding (I miss giving away those low level Leggies from 'Leader of the Pack', though).
---
I wish what they'd done is apply One Wasteland to *events only*.
---
3000 damage is pretty op, that’s why they nerfed it
---
Slow horses and fast women
---
One thing most people don't know about it is that you can collect those big aloe vera plants and store them in the green container . Run around collect them that will do.
---
Twice in a half hour. Both times just wandering. Lol
---
Whole game closes not just to menu screen.
---
I play on xbox and would appreciate any help even if its just telling me what rolls I should hold onto for trading in the future. From how fast my legendaries sell sometimes I know I've thrown away at least some gold someone else might have wanted to trade for
---
I really enjoy doing that event. 
---
1) Nobody ever does it in fear of getting into PVP with a player.
---
2) Sometimes, not always, but sometimes you can get on a real roll and come away after 3 rounds having looting 6-8 legendary ghouls. Often they aren't great rolls, but sometimes they can drop you top tier stuff.
---
3) XP farming is reasonably high.
---
4) Stock up to the hilt on junk &amp; chems. Scrap and sell it all at Watoga station right outside and scrip the legendaries that are worthless. 
---
One downside (maybe), you are stuck with the visual glitch of appearing to still wear the mask afterwards until you switch worlds.
---
If you play on Xbox and plan on returning, lmk I love playing with a team
---
I can imagine 3000 was OP, but now I can’t do shit and still die with 1 blow. Last time I tried A Collosal problem I ran out of time..... I think they went too far in the nerfing..
---
I loved my Bloodied explosive pipe revolver
---
I'm just trying to help 😑 you don't have to be so negative.
---
If you didn't do enough damage to count as having participated in the event, but were in a team with someone who did, you'd be able to loot the Queen, but the event itself would only give you 4 treasury notes and the random legendary at the end.
---
I browsed some of the covers. 
---
EVERY issue seems to have articles that are relevant for my character.
---
Just put a power armour helmet on &amp; that will resolve the visual glitch 👍
---
Did one violent night earlier. I killed six 3 star legendaries. I got six 1 star drops.
---
I bet they’re rubbing their hands at the prospect of fixing this ‘bug’ and using it to pad out the next patch notes.
---
So you want us all to lower our prices while at the same time you trade what will be a 500 cap outfit for a 3* mini gun. Kind hypocritical of you.
---
Ha Ha yes it is , and its great fun. Thats why I cept the motants as its LVC which helps keep vats active. Enjoy
---
Same here
---
Strange thing is, my tools don't even have the Splosion perks, and shit it still slpoding
---
Please if you're going to add it to the legendary pool at LEAST let us get the ammo easier FIRST
---
I have that Legendary perk card that removes rads over time, so it looks like the two counter each other. 
---
I tried jumping servers after using Radaway and a decon arch. That made it go away.
---
Fix what? It was clearly broken, you should have never done that much damage.
---
Shotguns seams to be a constant magic weapon with Vats, where heavies are a hit and miss for me . Sometimes they work other times they do normal damage. Its strange
---
"The magic of cooking over a campfire"
---
"The ultimate campers combo gun"
---
"Wilderness survival drinks"
---
"Strategic camping"
---
Thank you for your excellent response you've given me a good idea of what I'll need to do. Just one more question if I may be so dumb, I've never known what the numbers are in reference to regarding the legendary rolls when people post about them. Would you mind explaining it to me?
---
If you are near other players they do have them.
---
Also all three of the melee legendary perks are explosions!
---
As I said. I can imagine that was too much. But now it is way too little and I can’t do shit anymore. So yes fix this!
---
Level 450 here. I hate one wasteland.
---
LMAO. I'm a near day one player and things in the game have changed dramatically since then. I have only played once since the new update and the instancing had me laughing but happy about it. My camp is in the forest near the gorge bridge and when I see what used to be a level 1 weak ghoul to all of a sudden being a level 50, I was shitting bricks at first but quickly realized that the damage taken hasn't really changed it just took a few more shots to take it down.
---
My main character is level 196. Not specific to any general build, but I do used rifles, like alot. Being lowered leveled the perks are only starting, but they get so much better as you go on. I'm still tinkering with them. When it comes to supplies equip super duper and max it. Max out ammo smith. And for stims and radwaway max out chemist. When the legendary perks kick in get ammunition factory. I just put it to rank 2 and LOVING IT!!!
---
More often than not you get one or more legendaries in that event.
---
At this point stash full, mules full , got the weapons and armour I want . Loads of ammo . I never wear power armour but just sink caps into their plans so that bethesda doesn’t keep getting it when I max caps and I know the serums , caps are a pain in the ..... so considering just giving up my vendors and dropping all the excess crap I get on the ground. Must be how real world billionaires feel lol
---
I totally agree. My very first and only daily op I finished with elder tier, but received a pretty mediocre weapon. I wasn’t *that* upset by it, but it certainly did make me believe that I deserved a better reward.
---
I've heard that sometimes CAMP allies can follow you while fast-travelling, and I've personally seen more than once Allies at the SBQ with no CAMP in the area, so I assume these Super Mutants would use the same bug to follow you to your CAMP while you exit the Daily Op instance?
---
Just a guess, not too sure of the underlying technicalities of the problem.
---
You can't fix what's not broken.  You are going to need to adapt to the new changes.
---
They are big, thanks for the help!
---
Sure, if they change the name to „reward“ then, since it wouldn’t be „special“ anymore :)
---
I’d personally prefer unlimited tries but with a lower chance to get anything. So I can try over and over instead of once per day. But that’s a personal opinion. For now I’m satisfied with the current system (as long as they add more DOPS and rewards from time to time).
---
Upvote because i agree handguns need a buff. They are pretty much rifles with 2/3 the damage. To top itnoff revolvera cant be suppressed so thats a big hinderence and something should be done tonoff set that, especially now that folow through is a thing. Ive suggested a few times they should give them extra weakshot multipliers. For example instead of 2x head shot damage pistols should do 3x headshot damage and revolvers that cant be suppressed should do 4x headshot damage.
---
However i will say, youre wrong about them not being viable. With the new patch revolvers are certianly much more difficult to do well with, the lack of stealth and not being able to take advantage of follow through really sucks but theyre totally do able, just end up with alot of armor repairs. An AA revolver will 3 super muties to the head without sneak and 2 shot them with rank1 of adrenaline starts to stack.
---
 The 10mm pistol on the other hand can do very well, especially when follow through gets qorking. I run AA pistols and keep up with just about anybody. If i slap on geurilla performance increases anymore. Before patch 22, i was able to solo earl. Havent attempted him solo in patch 22 yet, but confident i can solo him, just will be close on time since damage dropped a good bit with the new damage formula they are using. Wouldnt make the time frame with revolvers/semi auto though,thats for sure.
---
That will be it then, was in public team with three others all the times. Thanks for clearing that up for me 👍
---
People were speculating it wouldn’t happen because it wasn’t on the roadmap and a community manager responded that it’s not on schedule because of outstanding bugs from last year and they’re discussing including a new event in its place.
---
Thanks, enjoy your coffee ☕
---
I’ll admit, it’s a letdown to not get any rare. But for me I’ve kinda made it a game, as a PA user I put on my T60 armor with the Elder paint and strive for elder every time. Gotta play the part, right?
---
Stealth commando is still OP. Stealth bloodied melee is nerfed to death! Tell me how to adapt. Change my whole build to junkies or something? That’s ridiculous. I still die with one blow. Around 1000 with sneak incisor and all the foods is reasonably. This sucks
---
&gt; Yes the power armor skins are more than a 'bit' comical. But I always thought Fallout power armor was goofy just by the way it moves. 
---
They weren't until Fallout 4.  
---
&gt; Imagine a Crysis type Nano Suit in the game, discovered deep in some hidden vault science area only after completing a gruelling new vault quest, I would like that. 
---
I disagree... Fallout had enough personality without having to copy stuff from other games...  
---
but also, Fallout was something more than Nukacolas, vaultboys and a Power Armor Simulator.  
---
Was.
---
No particular lens needed. It takes a second for the names to display though.
---
Thank you I really appreciate the time put into your response and will definitely start studying the trading forums  to familiarize myself with what rolls are valuable, and how to get to what I want!
---
Makes you regret Scripping those 1534 HUNTERS weapons now, doesn’t it?? LOL
---
I used to love doing the side quest at the church in Charleston that involved killing waves of them. It used to be easy. Now I have to run away. And they chase you for sooooo long after you leave to area.
---
The problem and the totally improbable reason and solution supplied by a fellow wastelander who had overcome it is the reason Reddit is totally awesome
---
I'll watch out for that one, I didn't die so as the other person commented I was in a team but just didn't do enough damage. Need to change my weapon of choice for the queen.
---
Two tips:
---
1) don’t worry about mutations until can get and have level 2 starched genes. 
---
2) you are better off buying the serum directly from a player vendor
---
I feel you bro, seems like everybody is into the low health high rad builds but those players are mainly day one fo76 players. Now since the patch 22 came out, it’s a different game sort of. Even before the patch I was running a stealth sniper class, I started played like a week before the patch came out and still like my build honestly. I kill enemies pretty easily unless they’re op or whatever
---
I’d like them to bring something so far unseen in Appalachia: a skin for the gauss rifle.
---
I have watched a few of his vids, the time and research he puts into it 🙏🏻
---
I've been selling them for 500 each. They seem common enough and don't sell very fast.
---
This, hack and slash causes an explosion on proc which does the Area of Effect damage.
---
Might be to collectors or for special builders.
---
I doubt normal player would pay much, because it only gives 100 power and needs a 2*2 foundation.
---
I always do follow me. Less ambiguous.
---
This game is shit and amazing at the same time, good job bethesda (watched ai companions shoot a dead corpse for 3 mins 🤣)
---
Uranium Fever isn't even done for the rare rewards most of the time though. It's done because tons of legendaries spawn. Or am I mistaken? That's why I always make sure and do it...
---
I wasn’t in the Daily op. I joined a new Server for a trade and spawned at my camp. Suddenly i was under attack by freezing super mutants.
---
Abbreviations are broken up into the 3 stars effects. In this case it is easier to see the breaks if I write them as B/25/25. 
---
2nd star (number in the middle of the abbreviation):
---
25: 25% faster fire rate
---
33: 33% vats hit
---
50: 50% vats critical dmg
---
3rd star:
---
25: 25% less ap usage
---
15: 15% vats crit meter fill
---
15r: 15% faster reload
---
90: 90% reduced weight.
---
Energy damage weapons will always be shelved overall unless Bethesda finally gets off their asses and fixes the Energy Damage Bug that's existed since Fo4's launch.
---
Group events were not meant to be done solo. I know it sucks, but it's still the truth.
---
Yea I do this and lick pick up the rotten leftovers at the beginning. Critters have been spawning like crazy also. 
---
Btw- if you shoot critters with an explosive weapon, you are awful.
---
Only thing I find myself spending caps on is bulk junk and armor
---
You can put a fusion mag on it. It needs an ultracite fusion mag.
---
Naa, was solo, and only had infiltrator, luck, and follow through.  And again on another toon with nothing equipped yet.stuff just randomly sploded when i hit it.
---
~~Stealth commando is still OP. Stealth bloodied melee is nerfed to death! Tell me how to adapt.~~ Change my whole build ~~to junkies or something? That’s ridiculous. I still die with one blow. Around 1000 with sneak incisor and all the foods is reasonably. This sucks~~
---
I wasn’t doing it solo. It was with 4 other guys. 1 low level. I died like 20 times and didn’t even made the time. Before I never did it alone either.
---
Surprised Pikachu face
---
Screw this "adapt" nonsense. 
---
The nerf went in the right direction, but still needs loads of tweaking.
---
Yeah you do.
---
Sort of, before patch22 full uny gear and 1 rank of sneak was iskallt enough to stealth everything, after patch22 and with more sneak ranks I also find myser detected way more.
---
Ugh I feel your pain.
---
Quick switch is bugged honestly, I switch from my lever rifle to my fists for no reason, when I clearly have another gun in my inventory. Best thing to do would be to favorite those weapons and use the up button on the dpad instead
---
Why does everyone say 80% the data mine I saw said 32%. That seems to better reflect what is actually happening.
---
My bad, it sounded like you tried it solo.
---
Sure, enemies have higher levels now, so they also have a higher perception.
---
This. Any sort of marker or outline of enemies would be great.
---
Deleted! When was this?
---
80% is the official line that BGS released. I’ve noticed it more like 60%, but I’ve found that I’ve been luckier than most people I’ve read talking about it on Reddit. Seems a lot of people have been a lot less lucky and been rarely to never getting the rewards, so idk. I’ve gotten the Symptomatic, Caged Bulb Lights, Whisper in the Dark, and Vault 94 jumpsuit schematics, plus the spec Ops suit already through having gotten Elder every single day since Patch 22
---
I have level 1 starched genes perk &amp; I didn’t know you could buy mutations from players, thanks for the tips!
---
Not if really if you wanna maintain a bloodied/nerd rage/unyielding build. Easier to cap health with rads.
---
I have been a full health stealth rifleman since Beta which is arguably one of the weakest builds. I have adapted since Beta and have made that build work.
---
 This update absolutely killed my build. I switched a few perks around, got some legendary perks and dug through my stash Box for different weapons and now I'm back to 1 and 2 shotting all non boss enemies. 
---
 I'm still fairly weak when it comes to bosses but I do enough damage to contribute and I think that's how they meant bosses to be... tough.  They were never meant to be destroyed so quickly by melee OP builds.
---
 I do agree though things need to be tweaked still but it is a step in the right direction
---
Maybe the npc have not only higher level but also higher perception?
---
Awesome! Thank you so much I feel much less stupid now.
---
Not much. It's a decorative item only (as it has no advantage over existing power options), so the market is limited.
---
The one thing I want is a higher script limit at the purveyor. I'm having to throw away legendaries because I have way more than I can ever turn in. As for the higher cap and bullion amounts, I dont see them doing any of that just because I think they want you to have to take your time so you dont get bored as quickly. Hopefully now that Microsoft has purchased bethesda, 76 will get some more manpower so some new content can get pushed out faster. If that happens they might raise the limits a bit since there would be more to do.
---
I’ve only had one website that’s worse.
---
I just tried to play nuclear winter and unloaded 8 shots to a radscorpion while my magazine gave 10% damage bonus , didnt even take him down to 50 % and ke killed me in 2 hits .
---
Easy way for bethesda to address this required buff and all other needed ones is by dropping new legendary perk cards for where required and my guess is that’s the way they’ll go
---
Not sure if I've ever got that or not, I may have and just scrapped it in the past. The last batch I sat through was 56 of those tickets a few months ago LOL.
---
I'm starting to think they're forcing everyone to become a certain build, nowadays it feels like the only viable builds are bloodied
---
Easy. Just make the Legendary glowing effect remain on them after death.
---
100k snowflakes less
---
During primal cuts I did that. It kept telling me where the body was and I looked for a good 10 minutes. It was a small area. Pretty sure it clipped into the ground. Not the first time I've seen this after a kill. I've seen rather large enemies fall right through after a kill.
---
Getting rid of my turrets a year and a half ago was the best decision I have made for my camp.
---
You dont need them and you save lots of camp space.
---
Where can u  buy those?
---
Yeah cause shooting level 6 when you're 100+ was soooo funny and rewarding.......
---
What rank do you have it? I was thinking of ranking it up is it worth it ranking?
---
Check south of Palace of the winding, East of Site Bravo.
---
WAIT REALLY
---
I went from maining gauss rifle (no skins) to telsa rifle (no skins) so I feel you.
---
Well, allowing players to have everything right of the bat doesnt seem good either. It's a way to balance rare things.
---
Does people need to shoot lvl 6 enemies to feel good at this game? Wow
---
Dont forget to bring chally some feed and you get more status if you turn in everything at once instead of one at a time . Like turn in 15 meats not 2 than 3 than 5 than 1 than 1 than 3 ... the 15 will give more
---
When you finish the 40 atoms one, an 80 atoms one will unlock.  Still not much but when there's so little else left to do...
---
My wife's vendor.
---
3 at foundation 3 at creater. 100 gold each. Havnt tested it myself but server hoping should reset them like the purveyor and legendary modules
---
Meh, play stupid games, win stupid prizes.  Lol
---
You can buy them through gold bullion vendors and I’ve heard mixed reports of 3-9 lunchboxes a day. Some people say 3 lunchboxes max daily, and others say 3 lunchboxes per gold bullion vendor daily (for a total of 9 lunchboxes. I haven’t confirmed this myself though
---
Louise, you are missing the point here.
---
If I want to one shot everything, I'll grab my I/33V/25 gauss shotty. No adaption needed.
---
I (and OP) fully agree that 3k is way too much. The shit is the adapt part. No game beside Fo76 has ever made any build unviable and forced players to adapt in extreme ways.
---
Sure you can grab some legendary perks to mitigate the shitty balance, but not everyone has the lvl and the points laying around to make it effective.
---
Stealth Commando is totally nerfed too. I did 1500 dmg per shot, now I do 370.
---
Well I was about to say cause West Virginia was safe from the bombs but actually by now it's probably the most nuked place in the world, hell with as many nukes as I alone have launched all of West Virginia should be worse than the glowing sea
---
My IE harpoon with Flachette mod does insane damage even without a single perk for it equipped. One shots just about everything, even after one wasteland.
---
It doesn't matter how many you may have, it matters only that 100's of new players flooding to the game don't have them or know where to get them or how to look this info up. I vendorhop dozens and dozens a day and rarely ever see the these items. That tells me that all these other new players never see these items either.
---
This junk stills reliably for 1000's of caps.
---
... just sayin.
---
" going for a run with the camera strapped to your knee. Itll break your brain"  
---
LOL!  Thanks for the laugh and the warning both.
---
That's a gutsy statement.
---
Seeing this on PC, complete CTD of the game and the launcher, no messages, just “up and gone”.
---
You could probably buy a be plasma off ebay for 100 bucks , but you also might have your account banned because its against the new zenimax terms of service apparently
---
Now check my username...
---
There's an updated list out of combo stats you'll need to adjust for.
---
I can only say it must work because 1-shotting everything in the face for daily ops for the first time yesterday was pretty slick.
---
Excuse me, I have a lost child. Has anyone see their parents?

Tbh i dont think they are  that spongy, maybe the lvl 100 supermutants are  but not that it bothers me. I was scared that the update would make them overly spongy.  That ammo legendary perk rly compensates with it. When  i craft ultracite FC's i need 2 Fusion cores  and get 6 ultracites in return lol.
---
I just realise some of my comments are missing words
---
I mean I get it, I am the same as you, I hate playing in groups, and refuse to do it in any regular sense, I play games by myself 99% of the time because I want to do what I feel like doing, especially in a sandbox game like this one.    
---
I don't view public teams as being in a group is all, and i don't really get why anyone who had tried it would.    
---
It's certainly not important, but it can be confusing is all, I'm sure that's why people get insistent about it.
---
No problem.  Expanded it with some more abbreviations in an edit. Good luck.
---
Maybe 3000 was OP, but 125 is ridiculous.
---
I think 1 star is fine.  If u do the event right it’s over in seconds.
---
You basically only need two players to reach the "Elder" rank. As long as you both know what to do and have enough diluted stimpaks it's in the pocket.
---
I don't even pick up 3/4 of legendary drops, I defo don't want the going into my inventory automatically
---
Jip.
---
It's still % but just x% from base damage(normal weapon, unmodded)
---
I'm keeping it at base rank for now and it'll probably be one of the last ones I rank up. It only goes up to a 20% chance and I believe the cost in tokens would be used better elsewhere until later on. Ammo Factory, a Legendary Special, Power Sprinter, etc, take priority for me.
---
One rank is good enough to protect from Assaultrons and Gatling Lasers because the amount if hits have a really good chance of proccing it, even at just 10%. Semi-autos attacks from things like Protectrons definitely won't be as beneficial, but they attack so rarely  that even at max rank it won't proc all that often (and they don't really do enough damage to make the healing needed).
---
I will level it up eventually. Just at the end.
---
Suddenly FO76 gets Crossplay between XBOX and PC.
---
I certainly hope not, personally.. 
---
Not because I'm on PC, but for those Console users that simply want the game to remain Vanilla ... So many exploits on PC, such as a Bow that launches mini nukes or the airstrike grenade launcher...
---
However if they manage to quash that nonsense, I'm open for Crossplay.
---
Mind you Sony will still be left in the corner sulking.. 😂😂
---
This. I finally got rid of them all and I don't get nearly as many hostiles attracted to my camp either.
---
I am built on the edge of a Primal Cuts event so my camp is now targeted all the time, but turrets are worthless for this anyway.
---
U can always check ebay listing. See what people are selling.
---
Come on! Illogical is calling the whole Appalachia a *Wasteland*...  
---
For Pete's sakes just go to Google and search "Wasteland" then the tab "images", do you see any bloody forests in there? XD
---
Forget it, it's impossible to reach a mutual understanding.
---
The vault now sells them too?
---
The only energy weapons I find totally useless are the laser rifles and laser pistols. All plasma and heavy energy weapons work fine to me.
---
We should gather at Johnson's Acre on the might of a full moon and plop cat carcasses on those flingy traps and send them into space, in Peebles Honor of course!
---
I don't think the developers ever intended bloody melee users to be as powerful as they were.  There should never be a build in a game where the majority of players want that build because it is the most powerful build. It makes for almost no diversity in characters around the game world.
---
 I'm sorry your easy mode button was taken away from you but unfortunately you are absolutely going to have to adapt to the new changes of the game.
---
User name checks out.
---
Same effect happens if you're using someone else's survival tent too. I was cooking up some meats and the owner left the server, and here's me left standing holding a bbq spatula. Had to restart gameto get things back to normal
---
When an ENTIRE WEAPON type isn't viable in open world then I agree they need to be buffed. Most pistols in the game are garbage. Plasma pistol with a flamer barrel is the best one i can think of. 
---
Knives fall into the bladed weapon category, or the one handed category, and those categories are fine with many of other options. 
---
I"m not complaining about one pistol, i'm complaining about the majority of weapons assocaited with the Gunslinger perk. The majority of weapons belonging to Gladiator are not in a poor state, and are viable. Knives belong to the Gladiator perk, that's what i mean.
---
I know right? Also yeah, it is a nice look. One bright side is I got a number of handmade rifles just itching to use it for a skin, including a quad, limb damaging, faster reload one.
---
For real though, shout out to people like this, you give me hope that tryhards won't overtake us all
---
One Wasteland is one of the best think they made for the game
---
There's some question still about vending being safe.   Innovsurvivalist just did a video that talks about it.   Although it's probably still not completely thief-proof, I've countered it with:  
---
  
---
\--putting skins on every weapon that will take one
---
\--putting stash far away from vending and not using blue boxes for stash.  If they're trying to access it as it loads in, they're going to have to do some looking.
---
\--putting a 30K placeholder in each vending machine so they can't buy every item in it and use lag to access stash
---
just because they are additive doesnt mean theay arent percentage based anymore,
---
bloody mess for example still gives you +15% damage
---
but its plus 15% of your weapons base damage rather than overall +15% damage
---
i do agree that its frustrating at some points
---
damage perk cards for weapons (commando/gunslinger/slugger...) should still add an overall 20% damage as a multiplicative and and so should recievers and weapon mods imo
---
the new system may be more predictable for developers but its absolutely unintuitive for players 
---
9perk points for an additional 60% of your weapons basedamage are just too much of an investement for what they offer
---
As someone who spends at least 2000 atoms a month on stuff this month's items have not been very good. Like you have already pointed out.
---
Which has at least stopped me from spending any Atoms for the last month.
---
On a side note has anyone else noticed how many people have finished the season pass already ? I visited at least 5 camps in 2 days with everything unlocked.
---
No wonder the 2 week lockout from last season never happened this time.
---
Right, that's what I'm trying to say, even though the word "group" is in the name of the thing, it's not actually a group any more than being on the same server with someone is a "group", and I don't think solo players should look at it that way.    A lot of people seem to think that being in a public group means you will be playing the game differently than when you play it solo, and I'm talking about the NON ops groups, even though I consider that solo play too, just like ACP or fighting the queen, are group activities.  
---
You have no responsibility to the others in your group, you have no effect on the others in your group, there is no reason to interact with them at all.    
---
Like the causal group is just "click this button to get more experience, and have two to three more free travel spots", to me.  That's it.      
---
I've played this game almost exclusively as a solo experience, and that's the way I like to play, and public groups make that experience *easier* and more rewarding.    
---
In the end you can do what you want obviously, I just want to be sure everyone knows that public groups are **not** what some some people think they are, and are really only groups in name alone.
---
THAT’S RIGHT MAGGOT! DROP AND GIVE ME A HUNDRED!
---
Outside of SBQ and ACP my bloodied unarmed is just fine.  Yea it takes 2-3 regular swings and 1-2 PA swings to kill now. 
---
No issues for me.  They still die ez enough.
---
Pistols should overall do less damage than rifles. Problem is that Commando is so much farther ahead of Gunslinger, that it's a larger gap than 2/3 the damage. 
---
And I did say the majority of pistols, not all of them. Anti Armor shouldn't be included because Anti Armor, for some reason winkwink, is REALLY good on EVERYTHING right now. Which means an AA Gunslinger pistol will do significantly worse than an AA Commando rifle.
---
Bad bot.
---
&gt; Likewise. Do you happen to know if there is a reason it's the only untradable plan/weapon?
---
I'm going to take a stab and say it's because the mods are unlocked by gold bullion
---
My point was that we shouldn't have to run bloodied explosive on a pistol to go "finally i can use a pistol effectively"
---
Right now, the 30K cap limit (and 800 pound max) keeps prices low.  The game encourages players to sell their excess at a reasonable price.  A 150K max cap would blow up the economy. 
---
All I want is a separate 25 pound stashbox that is shared by all your characters.
---
Even on my own it only takes about an hour now to gain a level..
---
*unloads half a dozen AP rounds into your head in a tenth of a second*
---
I have been seeing a lot of posts about not getting the rewards at elder tier. I think your luck stay plays a significant role in how frequently that percentage price this giving you a reward. All the the people I have talked to about missing rewards had under 6 luck or and the ones who where bloodied unyeilding with 20+ luck seemed to be in the same boat as me which is atleast 1 reward every time if not multiple. Idk just a theory but seems to be correct so far.
---
remembers me of the time when ghouls got stuck in there sleeping animation while creeping over the floor like snakes
---
game unplayable now &gt;:(
---
/s
---
There, there, you sound like you need a little nap, getting cranky? N'awww, widdle man has such an angry face right now. We need to get him on a nice game that doesn't get him wound up so tight. Maybe he just has a rash and he can't vocalize it. Is that it? Awwww, poor little angry bubba.
---
I'm literally selling every mounted plan for 5 caps each I don't even know where or when I got them I'll occasionally have someone come along and buy a hundred caps worth but that doesn't even put a dent in
---
But it's in the name WALL paper not roof paper....
---
I never did call the whole Appalachia an wasteland?
---
But it’s safe to say, combining the mire, the bod, the toxic valley and the ash heap, around half the map is a wasteland of some sort, no?
---
Appalachia *is* lush and green by its nature my man. And the nukes didn’t it that hard either.
---
But it is illogical to dismiss 76 as a fallout game because it wasn’t hit as hard by the nukes, while praising New Vegas for its “gritty” setting. Which it really isn’t when you remove the orange filter.
---
The car is connected backwards? Idk I don't know much about trains but it looks right to me but then again I'm no expert.
---
Literally buff the durability of everything, my lever action breaks with 5 minutes of use
---
Yeah pistols aren’t great but they weren’t meant to be good in endgame , or even used . they designed the game with a natural progression from vault - nuke launch with the areas and enemies getting more difficult and weapons getting stronger I.e pistol - rifles - heavies. Bethesda designed it that way , hey I’m a bloodied commando but love taking pistols for a spin and have tried to make them all work for me, best I came up with was BE 10mm auto pistol which feels like cheating as it’s really just a machine gun.
---
It's also a lot easier this time with OW. I'm at r40 and don't have all that much time to grind xp
---
Though imo yesterday's atom shop letters look better.
---
Glad they landed when they did, cos I finally got enough caps at once to buy the neon ones, now I can spend them on other fun stuff...
---
But I have seen people one shot scortchbeasts with alien blasters. They say it does 900 damage, Seems kind of fishy.
---
I love going inside while it's raining in my PA and its still raining on the visor, but not raining when I jump out.
---
Regular dailies reward a lot of caps
---
That was most likely godmode bobblehead stacking. Its patched.
---
I have done this too. My haunted house has little set ups of various plushies torturing each other. It's cuter than it sounds?!
---
Thanks for your concern. Perhaps you can tug me in and sing me a lullaby?
---
Mostly it creates a situation where players trade items for items to make up for the low caps cap
---
That is exactly what I mean.
---
Oh course people valways chem stacking or magazines or bobbleheads. I will never be that person ever! That and I would never remember to keep using all that stuff just for damage I use radsheild since the effectively stack forever which is nice hopefully that never gets patched. And super stims and that is it.
---
&gt; I'm sorry your easy mode button was taken away from you but unfortunately you are absolutely going to have to adapt to the new changes of the game.
---
That makes you sound like scumbag Steve, you know the annoying one that refused to understand the words he's supposed to read?
---
My "easy button" wasn't taken away, it was never there to begin with.
---
My stealth commando is still doing fine, the legendary perks just made sure that I can still one-shot everything, if i so chose.
---
&gt; There should never be a build in a game where the majority of players want that build
---
You must be new to mmo gaming, as every mmo has such builds.
---
&gt; It makes for almost no diversity in characters around the game world.
---
Those that care about this are the ones who tell others how to play, highly uncool attitude.
---
Aren't they named "gun racks"? As in they are designed for guns only
---
Not gonna tug anything...
---
Nuh uh, no way, no how.
---
It’ll improve as Microsoft need to get there 7.5 billion back from somewhere 😂
---
Boi you stole my post
---
A lot of the new stuff in recent months has been fairly mediocre at best. There have been exceptions of course, the contemporary camp bundle being a very popular standout.
---
The Raiders, Responders and Free States have all had bundles released but I think there's a perception amongst pepe that these keep getting recycled and the Mothman stuff gets leaned on far too heavily as well.
---
That leaves the 2 factions that everyone is asking to see themed items for - BoS and the Enclave. We may finally see BoS stuff appear with Fractured Steel, yet the Enclave seems to almost entirely off the radar.
---
The Atomic Shop needs an injection of fresh air - it's got stale, it's not releasing what people are asking for and several times items have sold in a broken state. Everyone's wise to ne cautious and disappointed with it.
---
Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist.
---
Also on console the nuclear winter scales to level i think , i just got owned by a radscorpion after i gave him a full 8 combat shotgun blasts to the dome . Didnt even get him to 50 % .
---
No, many of us are full health and VERY hard to kill. You don’t need to go the low health path.
---
Disagree
---
Yeah I hit bullion cap and started buying power armour plans I’ll never use , guess it’ll be lunchboxes now 😂
---
Ok but Legendary Spoon sounds fun tho...
---
Fully in agreement with this post, especially with all the exploding enemies now
---
So because shotguns have a higher base damage they did ok with the nerf ?
---
Yes.
---
Well if the people complaining used a fucking mic it might be easier to get their point across, rather than make Billiionth post on the subject.
---
Do lots of events and workshop captures? They usually award lots of stimpaks and i have to keep selling them to keep my weight down.
---
I look around for maybe one minute and then move on.  Not that big of a deal.  What are you losing out on?  5 scrip?  Not worth getting upset over.
---
You are getting downvoted, but you write simple truths.   Hell I started a BOW build now level 30 and doing ok.  😂
---
Last night I went around buying up all the cheap pump shotguns I could fine that where 3 stars going to try and get a test video made, I'm curious on the damage output.
---
Peace through power!
---
*...wait, wrong franchise...*
---
About 250k 50 cal ultracite ammo, only weapon I use it need.
---
Wow , too bad you didnt have any wendigos or snallygasters around , you could have done 15% more damage on them .
---
I went with alcohol, mentats, daddy-o, daytripper, and psycho. I pop psycho most fights so I rarely ever have the withdrawal effect from it.
---
I HIGHLY doubt they designed the game to progress in a way that everyone would be using miniguns and plasma gatlings for most end game events. That's a piss poor design choice considering you commit to a build as you level up towards the end game. People spec into shot guns or pistols or rifles or melee. If the game is designed SPECIFICALLY so you should be using gatlings, as you say "heavies", then the leveling is incredibly fucked and has been. They've never change dit tho becaus.e...that's not what the end game is. We're supposed to be able to use whatever we want. There IS a hierarchy in weapon types, no shit though. 
---
Pipe Pistols will do less than a REvolver. A walking Cane will do less damage than a super sledge/Assaultron Blade. Of course. 
---
I"m not arguing that. I'm arguing THE ENTIRETY of pistols is too weak to be used at all unless it's a flamer barrel plasma, or bloodied explosive, which is a separate thing that needs to be looked at and tuned because it's been the meta since the beginning of time. 
---
Plus iwth the addition of One Wasteland, your argument is weak because Bethesda literally balanced the entire world...(yes with caps in certain areas), so that everyone can play with almost everyone with the same survival and damage rate. 
---
A level 40 can be in a nuke zone contributing fine against a level 60 scorchbeast.
---
You really need level 2 so you don’t accidentally lose a mutation.
---
I'm actually loving the extra exp they add.
---
Where did BGS officially release that? I didn’t see 80% mentioned in the patch notes or ITV.
---
Of course people would prefer it but bethesda sorry Microsoft wouldn’t prefer it as they WANT you logging on every day so that you might visit the atom shop and spend some money, they don’t care if you log off once you’ve got your maxes fir the day as long as you’ve checked the shop out, and whilst not everyone dies - enough people do it to make it a working business model for them, plus player count per day probably is important to companies like this, especially if there trying to flog said company to a bigger company with lots of money
---
Ahh so ur the nab cake that takes all 15 colas from my fridge rather than one like it sez on the front of it hmmm....?
---
Meatwerk i use the time after to make food irl or do my business,  its a safe place to idle for 20 minutes if I need to do something
---
He goes great with the Wanderer's guitar, though. And unlike the Scavvertron, Santatron and Commietron, it actually shuts up when there's no player around. Just put him on the outskirts of your camp and he won't say anything.
---
Could've also been a glitch in the code though. I wouldn't be surprised if some people were seeing over level 100s with this new one wasteland
---
Ah ok, because I have like no other forms of money or trade so. Kind poor
---
Hello? OP? Where did you go what happened? You make this post and complain and here people are offering help to make your experience smoother because we would love new fallout players and you’re not replying to anyone? Sorry for jumping to conclusions but this post is bogus, I’m not buying it. If you’re a legit new player I apologize and maybe you just went to sleep after you posted this or something, but otherwise I believe this was all fabricated in an attempt to make the game look bad after the update because you’re one of the people unreasonably mad about it. There I said it. Kill me. I honestly hope thats not the case, I would rather look stupid than actually have someone toxic making fake posts like that. I just don’t know why you wouldn’t reply and accept all this help if you’re really struggling in the game, the folks here are nice and can really make your experience way easier than it sounds like you’re having.
---
Here’s a post going over the breakdown of how rewards work in Daily Ops as well as some other information
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/isgjgf/psa_list_of_daily_ops_rewards_coming_tomorrow_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
That, the FAL, the P90, the L86 LSW, the G11, the Desert Eagle, the 12.7mm smg, 14mm pistol, 5.56 handgun, Plasma Defender etc. Literally dozens of pre-war guns from the prior Fallouts are missing. They'd really improve the game adding at least some of these
---
Plasma gets by because of the damage split that has half as good ol ballistic damage that works fine.
---
Core problem is that Energy Damage for some odd reason does its damage to DR check BEFORE any perks and modifiers are applied, unlike normal damage which does the check after said perks. This means that if you had a 40 energy resist enemy and your weapon was 40 energy damage boosted to like 300 through a bunch of perks and such, then you'd still get slammed down to 150 damage because of 40 damage against 40 resist coming to a 50% reduction.
---
Meanwhile the equivalent ballistic with the same base damage and same amount of resist ballistic wise will take drastically more damage.
---
I mean, I dont want you guys to lower your prices, just stop asking for absurd things is all. On the xbox searching for group posts people make these crazy demands for stuff and it's just strange
---
.50 can be used pretty well in vats if you have the lowered vats cost legendary effect on one. Gatling Gun and Plasma Caster as great vats weapons, though. The others just fire too fast, though. Maybe with a ton of agility and the reduced vats effect you might get some decent bursts in.
---
 I use vats to find enemies if they're hidden behind junk or foliage, but that's about it. As for keeping dps up, bullets. Lots and lots of bullets.
---
You are doing less dmg overall since one wasteland. Counts also for magic weapons.
---
They are still good but you need some more pellets to kill the enemie.
---
Also they only work in vats.
---
I may just have to do that now as that is literally my only option at the moment
---
they need to buff all weapons 
---
the nefed down every thing
---
No no I was being positive as well, I was just saying if they havet heard about that event yet is if they simply never did it or are new:) walt being mean comrade
---
I mean if it doesn’t look like anyone is drinking them... 😅
---
You can.  
---
There are many ways to obtain what you need. It'll require more of a time sink and figuring it but just asking for stuff b/c you're lazy isn't productive. Make the time.
---
Reminds me of when i played state of decay 2 and my only purpose in life was to make all the zombies handicapped
---
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD
---
Furious + faster fire rate = my main weapon sinds the nerf.
---
Idk about that. Seems like everyone just needs an adjustment period. The game is still incredibly easy but people aren't used to not being able to 1 shot everything in the game.
---
OW?
---
Junkies does 5% more than AA on most mobs, but a little less to the boss enemies,  bloodied builds do 50-60% more than full health builds. TSE when perks with demo expert is doing more than AAE. TSE on a bloodied build is doing more than BE on bloodied builds. So AA is a solid standard to go by imo.
---
The 2/3 damage gap was comparing commando to geurilla or comparing gunslinger to rifleman since they essentially do the same things. Auto vs slowfire imbalance is a completely different argument, which i agree also needs to be addressed. There is no comparison in terms of damage output. Full auto weapons right now are king handsdown.
---
When comparing apples to apples they are rifles and handghns fill the same niche, but handguns do  2/3 the damage. Thats why i made the suggestion to increase handgun weak spot damage to make them more unique and not just a rifle "wanna be".
---
We could've suffered through the wasteland together my friend, but I'm on pc lol.
---
I'm lvl 20. Got an HL to help me yesterday. Found him on reddit and joined on his private server. He gave me a lot of ammo, a new set of armor and some weapons for lvls 20-25. We also did dailies a bit. Cheers to /u/8492_Dampfwalze
---
Prior to that I also found some nice guys in-game who also gave me ammo and crafted stuff for free.
---
The community is great and it really feels like PvE... we're here to help each other survive.
---
You can probably find similar people on xbox, don't forget it's a collaborative game if you want it to!
---
I suppose we'll never know, but less frustration and less feeling of a quick 15-20 minute checklist then logoff could result in better staying power, and more goodwill toward the atomic shop.
---
Hell, I think they should incentivize FO 1st by giving everyone the survival tent on a 1 hour cooldown if you're not subbed, and a scrap box that holds 100-125 of every junk type account wide, and unlimited when subbed, maybe even let non subs have a private server for like 45 minutes a day (basically enough to give them a taste and let them transfer items between characters until we hopefully get a real, safe way to do so in the future).
---
I feel like they'd gain more goodwill by lessening restrictions rather than having such an uptight grip that could disinterests players.
---
&gt;It's 2% 10% 80% for a total of a 92% chance
---
Your numbers are close, but you're mixing up uncommon and rare percentages.
---
If you're considering only the rare plans in the high level rewards, percentages are 2/4/32%, giving 36% chance to get at least 1 rare plan.
---
If you're considering both rare and uncommon rewards in high level rewards, numbers are 5/10/80%, giving 83% chance to get at least 1 rare or uncommon plan.
---
One wasteland
---
Thx
---
Just add the loot to my inventory
---
The TS fatman can be REALLY fun, trust me. The best you can get is a TS/10/90RW Fatman
---
Unfortunately they still exist along legacy trash
---
Nuka Cola Dark + Cola Nut 2\* + Party Boy 2\* and voila, you get 6 STR and 6 END. Simply put: STRONKS
---
Incredibly easy? For one specific op build maybe.
---
Mine is stuck at the exact same spot. I'm going to switch servers to see if it helps.
---
Is it only limb damage that makes it magic? I know about the block effect on armor.
---
Definitely will keep this in mind
---
that monstrosity of a weapon design should never have made it into 4, much less 76
---
This event seriously needs a loot table update.  It just screams to have mask types of loot.
---
That kind of server disconnect is form your computer losing connection to fast which cause your game to crash that’s why its really abrupt. Now when you see the little pop up say server disconnected controls have been disabled then yes that is Bethesda problem.
---
Add it to the legendary loot pool and buff it by 100% for energy cells and 200% for using AB rounds. Basically no one uses pistol builds right now because the best pistol (Gauss Pistol) doesn’t even properly work in VATS and is still a far cry from the other high-end weapons like the Fixer or even just the Handmade in terms of dps. 
---
The second best pistol is a revolver :/
---
The Alien Blaster could be the end-all-be-all for all our pistol needs, but for being an iconic Fallout powerhouse, the FO76 version is absolute garbage 😔
---
They ruined the game. They took away what i would call the “standard”. Low level areas/high level areas. It just doesnt feel right.  now have level 50 wolfs in the forest and endless level 100 super mutants eleswhere. hardly any incentive to become level 300. Id rather be lvl 50.
---
I tried a bloodied plasma rifle yesterday with the flamer mod and it's insane. Every 'bullet' does 500dmg in amazing speed.
---
I like the turn off foliage option.
---
Nah. Even with no real focus on your cards its easy. For example angry turtle did a build that knky had 1 damage card, a couple of defense cards, and the rest were all quality of life. He was still basically invincible to AI. Doesnt matter if you're melee, commando, heavy, sneak, tank, ect. The AI can barely take down players lvl 50+ as long as they have any armor on.
---
It’s really hard to tell if absurd is actually absurd without an example
---
I think so I might have to go through all my stuff and test it.
---
I do it a few times for ammo and Stims once I clear elder  but without fail someone will join as im getting ready to log off
---
I think either the new mg or the m249
---
This is thanks to a glitch and will become popular,given the number of posts about it rising.
---
Yes, you have a magic shotgun because of the limb damage attribute.
---
i havent actually ran into a level 100 bot in the open world but have only seen the ones in daily ops so im not using shotguns as im on a time limit, supermutants arent as bad as the toads i was fighting, scorched where still kind of easy at 100 but are probably the weakest of everything in general
---
According to [the latest community calendar](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4eM5a9X6VmGaV7zz7gYnDy/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-september-2020-updates), not until December 10th.
---
I like your take on it.
---
Killing a legendary should just drop the legendary item in to your inventory,just like when you exit monongah mine and you get a reward or like the second reward when killing the queen,the code is already there.

Casue people sell stuff on there and half of the time I have no idea if they are selling it for more or less then it's worth. And when I make a post I have no idea if a scammer is trying to scam me my my stuff higher end items
---
Might have to switch over to a shotgun build... my bloody handmade takes maybe 2-4 headshots to down some enemies.
---
It also counts as an event, so that can be two birds with one stone
---
Have an upvote for common sense. People you can't be running around with food/drink survival perks instead of Damage perks and expect to deal decent numbers.
---
This one works very well, it scales with rifleman perks I think. But it shreds ammo like .... :D  
---
Try any other laser rifle :/
---
So it turns out that maybe I am a filthy Commie, but only because of the spiffy uniforms and that hyperactive Communist girl
---
83% is still pretty good odds if you ask me! The event isn't going away any time soon so you're still hitting a rare/uncommon plan 5 or 6 times  every week, on average.
---
but what kind of an event?
---
collecting "space" rocks from containers where junk would spawn?
---
defend against "space invading" communist? (dressed up chinese astronaut ghouls with liberator pets)
---
im unsure what kind of event could happen
---
if you want to i suggest doing it right now and join as many primal beast events as possible. i got my second character from 30 something to 57 today. most exp coming from savage divide and cranberry bog primal cuts. didnt do mire much because the boss was usually a mirelurk queen who melted me without proper gear.
---
Cheers, I think I'll start anyway
---
Refrigerated, Chems and food mods cannot be stacked with perk
---
The raven mask is more valuable than the reactor for sure. Not sure how much it goes for though.
---
* I'm at r40 and don't have all that much time to grind xp *
---
Wait.. What? How much do you play a day to reach that level?
---
With a bit a luck perhaps Microsoft can give us a real fallout game
---
I know my dude. reddit is just a safe space where I don't need to worry about people, because there's an anonymity safety net between me and them. so I'm unusually talkative and often start \* for no real reason.
---
all in all I guess I was just sharing my perspective. the bonuses are there yes, but for reasons out of my control, I'd rather not take advantage of them. seeing as how they'd be more detrimental to my gameplay than anything. mr. shekels summed it up pretty much in his post.
---
but from a purely technical standpoint, sure. ditch lone wanderer.
---
Finally! Somebody is listening and speaking like a TRUE Patriot!!
---
Same for Radiation Rumble with turret-on-turret action, or the NPCs shooting the turrets themselves.
---
Flavour and illusion of choice.
---
Cheers. Will do that. Plan on doing a bit of Guerrilla warfare. Ie shoot it and cheese it!
---
For real. My cabin I made on an alt is so damn cozy right now with all of the nice furnishings.
---
Got the same Mr Handy yesterday - couldn't believe my luck. Still want to cash in my Covega though!
---
Oh!! This is fantastic news for me. I never played this way in other fallouts or Skyrim. So glad they are doing this. Not saying I won’t ever cook up some stuff for bonus’s but to not have to do it, yeah fully on board.
---
Definitely the one that revives you to full health. Probably taking one for the team for the damage boost just be sure to be in pacifist mode.
---
Speak for yourself. Some of us run pure builds :). But regardless your intention is correct. The radaway rewards are truly uninspired and somewhat insulting.
---
Appreciate it.
---
Of low to mid end items fed76 is an ok gauge of value. For trade only items it’s what ever the two parties can agree to as fair value. No one is going to tell you what the items are worth to you.
---
&gt;Call it "99 Lootballoons" or something.
---
you are my hero.  All day.  not just like a little part of it.  All day.
---
but the balloons have to be red
---
While we’re on the topic of pistol builds, I can recommend a pure pirate build though. 10 Black Powder pistols on quickselect for easy cycling.
---
Absolutely unviable for solo-ing certain events and a pain to kill Scorchbeasts with, but the damage on those is actually decent it it’s kinda fun. The reloading afterwards is also kind of meditative :P
---
i was changing the skin on my super sledge and someone left the server.

---
I'll do you one better, I dumped all my legendary perk level up currency from scrapping my cards collected over 243 levels into the explosive melee kill and unarmed hit skills since I assumed they'd be good for my melee build only to discover that their only effect is a chance to ragdoll corpses so you have to go look for them while doing next to no damage against anything.
---
Like an hour, 2 tops. My 6 month old dosent give me a lot of time
---
Well they sell for a bunch of caps at train stations so that would benefit you too.
---
Considered this when I played earlier.  Similarly I have just been doing nuke escorts , which usually contain around 20 each so it will take a few.....but I need the cards for launching anyways and take down more than enough per week where it will get completed no problem on its own.
---
But I don't know if it applies to all weapons this was my first one I experienced.
---
I love it. Thanks for the idea
---
Yes magic shotguns still exist. Mine still is one or two hitting things in VATS only.
---
Electric absorprtion is a must have as it regenerates health as well as FC. I use funky duds and sizzling style for survivability. If heavy gunner ammo factory greatly boosts ammo crafting. Master infiltrator QOL boost is amazing for any build.
---
I’m deliberately avoiding those perks for that reason. Well, that and the framerate dips...
---
If you've got time -- which rifle are using and what different perks? I was (still am) stealth rifleman, level 125 or something, and my damage has gone right done to the point where it takes six or seven shots to down a level 50 Mr. Handy or Mutant.
---
Ah ok, cause I'll say something and usually some guy will say "no no, it's worth this" and I'm like "eh ok?" And then we end up just kinda goofing around and building and stuff
---
I like to get on a build team, consume food that increases XP or INT (cranberry relish, canned meat stew, brain fungus soup) - if the group is together, open lunchboxes...
---
Run the WS loop (I get just under 10k XP running solo).
---
Typically, UF pops while I'm there - that's another bunch of XP.  
---
If the timing is right, RR also appears - Even over L200, if you are teamed, have the 4x bind bonus, etc, that one can be enough XP for 1-1/2 levels.
---
primal beasts in cranberry bog or secondly in the savage divide. ive leveled up quite a few times today just from these.
---
if your low level join any of them (or any event) that has other players and tag enemies and the other players will kill them and you still get full exp.
---
Even then, just give me caps and let me decide how to spend them. At most I make 500 from a train vendor
---
If you go to the train at Harpers Ferry and jump on it you can blow it's whistle, that cheers me up.
---
&gt; Hitting a &lt;8 min time only to get no special reward, with no hope of trying again, feels bad. And if it feels bad, it's not fun.
---
I mean, you try it the next day.  
---
Sorry to say - but doing it in &lt; 8 minutes, is typically pretty simple.    Every day I've been able to create a public team - wait for 1-5 minutes for 1-2 guys to join, and then complete the daily ops.  All but once - done it in less than 8 on first attempt.  
---
Once we hit 8 minutes and 15 seconds (burrows), and we ran it again.
---
I did Back on the Beat.
---
You said official word from Bethesda.... where is that?
---
Lever or gauss just for the suppressor I’d say,  can’t see a choo choo rifle helping in a stealth build.
---
i always thought it was double without perks.
---
If another human player is detected then everyone in the vicinity loses their sneak ability and damage. I can't really explainnthe technical side of it but it's been covered in videos for years now.
---
That might be what is happening. Unless if you are the sole person at these events then I dunno.
---
Ummm...what?
---
Surprised they didn't make a legendary perk for that
---
Question;  prior to the Microsoft acquisition announcement, did you say things like ‘Bethesda, sorry Zenimax’ in regards to situations like this?
---
I’m trying to get a feel for this new shift in paradigm so I shut would be helpful.
---
But first. Remove carry weight for ammos. I'm already overweight as it is...
---
They're killing my favorite game. I'm so sad. Wastelanders was such a great update, but they ruined it to cater to a minority of loud mouthed neck beards on twitch crying that their 2 shot explosive magic howitzers are op.
---
The non-atom shop variant of the Raven mask was relatively hard to come by.
---
Yesterday I joined the team late in the run, went in there help them finish up,I thought they were going to run again, I should have thought again. I ended up doing it by myself with everyone still sitting idle. Hope it doesn't happen today.
---
It's not against ToS if you look for the third party mods section. Allowed if it doesn't break terms, but not supported. Also consider that they outright detect and prevent you from using mods in Nuclear Winter, but don't do the check for Adventure Mode so it's implied that it's cool to use there so long as whatever the mod changes doesn't itself break the ToS. Stick to simple client-side changes that won't exploit things or gain you weps/caps/noclip etc - basically things that are managed on your machine and not sent to server.
---
I confused data mining on the patch with that, that’s my bad. The data shows 80% from what people have found, but Bethesda has yet to officially state what the percentages are. Once again, my bad
---
its like how the game gives me a handful of nukashine when ive got over 200 in my inventory. i dont need anymore.
---
Yep, they always have (at least in recent times since I started using them)
---
Stealth build? I would take the Lever with suppressor. 
---
Or the Railway but this is definitely no stealth weapon, or at least a weapon where you get detected pretty fast. 
---
The regular gauss rifle is horrible imo.
---
I'm happy if I can drop a nuke on 'em xD  
---
Just kidding... I'm curious about the *original Elder Maxson* views on Appalachia.   
---
I really hope F76's BOS resembles the original BOS from F1 and F2 when they arrive, not the imperialistic and xenophobic douchebags from F4.
---
Are you online?
---
Yup. It's a bug. Bethesda fixed Rad-X and Diluted Rad-X stacking but not Radshield.
---
“You and I, and explosive two shot
---
Buy a bag of balloons with the perk coins we got...”
---
Don’t forget that there is a perk magazine the contains a whopping 25% of the weapon’s damage! This magazine isn’t optional with that kind of magnitude.
---
As somebody who likes soccer, I am triggered that the fussball table has 13 players on each team.
---
I run the same 4 mutations on both of my characters.    
---
Mainly fast travel and buying mats if it's taking too long or don't have time to get them.    
---
I like the stat bonus and weight reduction on gear b/c it has allowed me to swap out perks.
---
Naaa, the m249 can only do 1000rpm.
---
As for the other German mg, they all fall short on the rpm, 4/5/G8 they all cap way below 1000, some can be changed to go as high as 1200, but that's it. :)
---
For stealth do you thing an instigating or a TSE lever action would be better? Because I've been running the ancient TSE since forever lol
---
I forgot about that. Still too weak.
---
I've been doing that when I can and got 45 notes within a short period.
---
Instead of a system to find the legendary how about just a repeatable mission in challenges that just gives us scrip when we kill a legendary. This way we can go to the purveyor and get items instead of worrying about scraping them ect. Also as a bonus you can even pick what kind of star and item type your looking for meaning you will have a bonus chance to get items you want.
---
Also double the max scrip.
---
Alright I'll check those out! With funky duds and sizzling style, isn't it a full set of whatever armor? 
---
Ontop of that, i have about 30k ammo stored away in my stash and 5k on me. I only use a gatling gun too haha
---
Yes the sneak attack was double,but when i aimed the head i was getting more, a torso sneak attack was around 800 but the head was showing 1200-1400.
---
Yes I am
---
On top of that they should just always be glowing, that's way they are easy to target.
---
I always felt the 9 perks for 60% was always not worth the investment been rocking the 3 for 30% and even Rank 1 Adrenaline easily counteracts the "missing" 30%.
---
One more dud in the loot pool.
---
What why the downvotes guys?  Trying to warn him about that bug people are exploiting to kill people unaware about it. There's basically a new system that involves legendary perks cards however one of them called take one for the team is allowing people to pvp people without them shooting you back first. The only way to stop it is to make sure your pacifist mode is turned on until they fix it.
---
Steel is everywhere.    
---
Tag it in any workbench. Gear you don't think you need tends to have it.    
---
If you have the Collectrons they can bring in some over time.
---
Wow! Nerf this now please! This is way TOO OP! Won’t be long before griefers build and entire camp STACKED with hammocks! The griefing in this game just keep getting worse I swear!
---
The last thing I need is to get lured to a camp with the promise of FREE LOOT and LEGENDARY items find STACKS of hammocks and risk catching a seizure or worse losing ALL OF MY JUNK!
---
I’m over encumbered as it is carrying everything, and to say that trap bases won’t be exploiting and abusing this glitch is an understatement!
---
Hammocks should be non stackable and should initiate PVP OR SOMETHING, because this is getting out of hand!
---
Don't the team perks only work if in a team? I have played solo for majority of my time.
---
I made sure of that, having a explosive gatling is easy to accidentally splash folks in events.
---
They said it was so low levels could go to high level areas with their high level friends, but it doesn't work out that way. Now anyone can go anywhere, the difficulty is always the same. People join public teams and don't interact.
---
When I was low level, I went places with my high level friends and they looked out for me while I uselessly picked at enemies they were killing from a hiding spot. The first time I solo killed a scorchbeast was an achievement. The first time I cleared out Whitesprings alone was crazy hard, I was way too low level.
---
Once I leveled up i liked taking legendaries I am not perked out for to low level areas to play with them before scripping/selling them. Now that takes too much ammo and kills me too much.
---
Also.... is it just me or does EVERYTHING break faster now?
---
Easy.    
---
Supply and Demand. Econ 101.    
---
Stimpacks are relatively easy to get and everyone needs them.    
---
Gear is subjective but most people want 3 Stars with certain effects.
---
Well at the very least it’s stronger then a standard laser pistol at that point. I don’t think you’ll be getting more out of it then that.
---
Yes it does. As you level you’ll apply perks to your build and get better weapons and armor. Hang in there!
---
But imagine trying to maintain a supply of that mag.
---
Getting that *controls disabled" then "disconnected" a lot since patch 22. Makes me not want to commit to more lengthy activities like launching nukes really.
---
Not going to lie, this is what I did for like 30 levels when I first started the game. Went to Helvitia repeatedly to get more black powder pistols and got lucky enough to have an Instigating and Executioners 15% reload drop from events. Loadout was 5 of them in this order:
---
Instigating, 3 non-legendaries, Executioners. 
---
It was surprisingly viable, but alas the beckoning call of being a Bloodied PA user was too strong.
---
Yeah, I've seen a crap ton of that
---
God tier for god tier. For example: if I wanted a B2525 fixer, I may be able to trade a B2525 handmade for it. But if I had a B3315 handmade I would probably need to throw in another equivalent legendary or 20k caps or so. 
---
If I wanted a legacy item I would need to have a legacy in trade for it. That or maybe two god tier non legacy items.
---
Two shot kinda sucks on slow fire rate weapons btw. It fudged up your accuracy
---
IMO, Leader of the Pack and Meat Week are pretty easy for low levels.    
---
They should pursue that as much as they can. Early on most people have normal gear so anything Legendary would most likely give a boost. If not, they can sell or script.
---
I tried to show my appreciation by being a bullet sponge and keeping to the objectives. They moved, I moved, they stopped, I stooped.
---
Yea but you can just join up on a casual public team and still play solo.
---
I just join a casual team and buff up and do West-tek, Huntersville, and Whitesprings and then server hop and do it all over again.
---
I would recommend the Instigating (maybe an explosive one) when you play alone. Because it only works on full health enemies. And yea not useful at all when there are several other players around you at events ect you know? 
---
The TSE is and will be always great. I would use this one for sayed events with other players.
---
See, I want just a 1* explosive laser rifle, I can do all the modifications and everything, but no one these days wants to trade away a legacy, it's always legacy for legacy from what I've seen
---
Awesome suggestion, thank you!
---
Yes it's actually a well-known problem and you should have pacifist mode on already
---
Thanks for the info. :) I probably decided I couldn’t be bothered with effort to get the squirrel stew when I went carnivore and stuck with canned meat and sleeping.
---
Weakling. It takes a real man to put up with all the bullshit that is an endgame pistol build 😎
---
I only wish black powder weapons had any sort of modifications. Like, a scope on a BP rifle would be so fuccing nice. They didn’t even get prime ammo :c
---
The legendary perk Take One For The Team has a glitch that causes this to be possible
---
Get a good melee weapon and a gun for every ammo type you have. Don't waste your ammo on easy enemies and unload on the tougher ones. After awhile you'll definitely find good weapons or legendary weapons that'll last you awhile. And if ammo is a problem try the lucky hole mine. Tons of lead, came out with 10s of thousands of ammo for my mini gun and .50 cal. And one more thing, try to get some power armor If you want/can. Since you're above level 25 go get the excavator power armor. Good for the mine I mentioned before and a decent starting armor till you can acquire better. Good luck!
---
Exploit with one of the legendary perk cards turn pacifist mode on if you don’t want to die.
---
Well as someone who has visited the TNT dome numerous times to collect alien blaster ammo, It’s obvious to me that the alien blaster is just there for novelty. Maybe when we get a big space themed event I’ll dress up and get to zapping but the alien blaster will stay firmly out of general use.
---
Fair point, it’s just my favorite event and I guess some OCD with it lol
---
Personally theory, Zenimax has been reducing funding to all their projects this past year so the company’s valuation would be hire when Microsoft began discussing purchasing the company. They were only worth like 1/4 of what they sold for a couple years ago.
---
My guess is we’ll slowly start to see production ramp up as we get closer to Microsoft fully controlling the company. Once they do, Microsoft will have to decide whether or not to double down on this game or leave it behind in favor of better future titles. Hopefully the former!
---
I did for a few just to give someone a plan I already had.    
---
They could be maxed on script and no room for storing anything if they spent some.    
---
They've done everything and there's nothing left to do. Why log out/back in every hour?
---
Yep. Highly sought after weapon. Won’t get one for anything less than a trade only god tier weapon. Also no such thing as a 1* explosive laser rifle.
---
There are 3 legendaries guaranteed to spawn at Uranium Fever. No more, no less.
---
That's the stuff I like to hear about. I got lucky enough when I started 2 months ago to run into a kind player who saw me struggling to kill some ghouls. He stopped what he was doing to build me a small base, craft a suit of modded excavator power armor, and drop me a bunch of stims. 
---
I went from scared child to feeling like I could take on a whole town of mutants in an hour. 
---
Now if only I could keep enough 50 cal ammo stocked up. Lol
---
If the event is already complete, the end crate is usually still there AND lootable even if you didn't do the event. When Holiday Scorched were running around, this was a great event for them. There were stacks of those end event crates!
---
Matching set of armor for both perks which applies to power armor as well.
---
aren't you also triggered by the fact that FO4/FO76 locomotives have no way to connect to the train cars? It feels just plainly stupid!
---
Crit without perks should be double damage, but different enemies have different weak spots. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/fhi3i6/tested_relative_weak_points_for_24_enemies/) is a nice list, maybe thats what causes the impression.
---
I find it tends to happen when I'm in a building in the world or one you've gone into with a loading screen. I have to leave the boundary of my CAMP when it happens and I'm there.
---
There might be
---
Exactly! A full team will grant you 8% more XP! (each INT point = 2% more XP for those unaware!)
---
When you can come join @Fallen Elem3nt and we will see what we can do
---
Damn, and I have bad luck so I wont be getting a legacy anytime soon ;-;
---
Absolutely.
---
It’s all of the new and special ones.
---
Rename it to Sneed's Feed &amp; Seed(Formerly Chuck's)
---
So I just tried to add you in FO76 and it said they couldn't find a bethesda.net user with that name
---
He has been, so I have no idea. Frankly, it feels like the rolls aren’t doing what they’re supposed to.
---
I feel like that is around what I've put in, with way more on the weekend, and I'm only at 29. What's your secret?
---
But that makes it multiplicative. If it's percent, then it's multiplying. So they didn't make it additive at all, right?
---
I'm no expert, but I don't think you can repair things by drilling holes into them.
---
It used to depend on how much your total damage was. At max rank I was gaining over 100 extra damage on my high damage weapons. Now it's maybe 30 with max cards.
---
😁Delightful, thanks for the giggle!
---
Collision Course gives 100
---
Mine took out a Mr. Messenger that someone was escorting past my roadside camp. 
---
They were coming down the road, so I ran over to join them. By the time we passed by my camp the messenger was like "Oh Dear" and was blown apart. I quit to desktop immediately hoping it could still limp on it's way and the other dude could finish the event.
---
I felt so bad. If this was any of you... sorry : {
---
Sorry pal, with the new update the enemies leveling system is broken at low levels. You always find enemies at your same level...   
---
So, it will get easier, eventually...  
---
I've read somewhere in reddit someone made some research and between 25-40 it's the worst, I think...  
---
Personally, I hope they'll fix this shit soon, or I'll be dropping my alt level 31 character and stick to my main level 137 until they do.
---
Pacifist mode is now on. Thank you all!
---
That's one of the better cards no?I like pvp every now and then but that bug sucks
---
I was incredibly surprised to see that they didn't carry over Boone's spotter perk from New Vegas into FO4 and 76. It just seemed like a no brainer. It clearly can't be something that pushes the tech and can't be added to these games. 
---
Ideally it would be a standard thing for everyone and not even a perk you have to equip. Even if it was a perk, the fun factor in the game would definitely increase.
---

---
See if any of that helps you. 
---
I found that the mid-game after 15ish all the way to around 45ish can get unreasonably hard given the build, gear and resource that you have available to you. Once you get past that, it's relatively straightforward once you know what you're doing.
---
You want my collection of 1-3* shovels don’t you....
---
You make the jetpack with the skin when you add the mod to the chest piece. You cant change it afterwards. So a jetpack with the camo skin added will always be camo and can't be changed. If this is what your question is about you'll need to make a new jetpack to change the skin.
---
I have a genuine question. How are you able to function in real life at all if joining a team is too much for you? How do you do work or go buy groceries?
---
"Unbreakable" laser rifles and VE laser rifles are the only ones worth a damn.
---
I personally always throw on the chef outfit for meat week. This meat week is Goblin chef.
---
I just suck up the 1 coin cost and unequip it if I’m going to be around a ton of other people
---
Perfectly explained thank you so much!
---
VE and "unbreakable" ones are good imo
---
Like Join you  in fallout how would I do that ?
---
I love Molerats. i'll take some of their meat. they give me tiny bit of hope for 30 mins of +1 STR. Damn, Im carrying too many junks.
---
Out of complete lack of research on my part (And.. typically playing alone so no-one to teach me my wrong doings), it took me until about level 90 when I realized what a life saviour Excavator Armor is. Came out of there with more than 100 Lead when smelted down.   
---
I'll *never* take you for granted again you wonderful Power Armor &lt;3

[This video shows you how Sneak actually functions!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OONwLXf2p8) It shows you why your sneak damage doesn't work in groups and non sneaky teams. /u/Tuc396 has it right!
---
Sorry. I tend to stray away because I'm pretty low on ammo. I try to stick to the uplink as much as possible though :[
---
I just give small taps instead a stream. It still uses alot. I am a single shot stealth build so i use al rifleman perks anyway. I got the gun as a reward and thought let's try it out
---
Amen, brother 🙏
---
Preach it!
---
The problem with the fusion mag is that it reduces the damage by ten, making the weapon significantly worse. A prime receiver probably would only stabilize the damage, but even then, the weapon shouldn’t be balanced around prime ammo. The problem would be fixed if the AB ammo would just drop in daily ops.
---
If that’s the case, bummer! But you can still get the outfit drop I guess.
---
Mutation serums can be found at player vendors for 250-500 caps per.
---
For events, a semi or full auto is useful, even if you are not spec'ed for it.  
---
As long as you tag any given enemy, even if someone else actually kills it, you still get to loot it.  
---
I'm a melee build, but for an event like Uranium fever and the daily ops, I switch to either a vampire SMG or vampire 50 cal.  
---
For RR, I stick with my ghoul slayers switchblade.
---
Since enemies got a level boost, they hit harder, so you take more damage -  you need better defense/damage mitigation.  
---
What Armor/underarmor are you using?
---
I found tweaking my perks (with the help of legendary perks) helped both offense and defense.  
---
For example, bumping luck allowed me to add bloodymess2, a 10% dmg increase.  Equipping Blocker ignores a good percentage of incoming melee damage.  Take one for the team legendary perk sends 20% dmg back to the attacker.
---
Government Supply Requisition holotapes
---
I don't. that's the actual answer I'm afraid.
---
Whats your load-out? I was level 105, stealth two-shot combat rifle, hunting rifle, and combat shotgun. Not a bloodied build or anything. I go through easily 600-700 .45 rounds in about a hour of exploring. The only enemies Im not struggling with are scorched
---
Yes i know about weaknesses, but super mutants had a 200% for the head, my gun has a base damage of 230, if i go to westek now headshot crits vary from 333 to 539, are the sneak crits calculated additive now?.
---
If it took the same amount of bullets, I'd be fine. But it doesn't (for me). So the net effect of all this is it *appears* like Beth wants you to waste more time and ammo in order to have to play the game more... Don't you get more xp though? At level 300, I don't want more xp. I don't need more levels...I have all the cards. I have all the things... 
---
I want more and better content...
---
[This should help everyone!](https://redd.it/ixr0s6) You can do it with just 6 BUT they have to boogie and divide their time insanely!
---
Add me on Xbox @Fallen Elem3nt I'm joinable
---
all low level players are in this boat from what I read and hear.
---
Odd, so you’re still firing at 300 dmg, but the DR is splitting that in half because it thinks that your actual dmg is a weaker number?
---
I have one turret that attacked a vendor last night. Just one. I thought it was a one time thing now I have to worry about a pissed off robot. Good to know
---
Nope. Took me over a year to get mine and it happened through pure luck that I had just the right trade piece.
---
Tesla rifle is the best for fusion cells
---
I completely understand you. This is the exact reason why I shelved the game. I don’t mind a challenge but when I can’t get through an event without blowing through 6000 rounds of 5.56 then I have a problem. 
---
Thanks for sharing your thoughts
---
All I can say anecdotally is that not all cooked are made equal. Some seem to last even longer than others. 
---
For example simple cooked items like a basic steak lasts longer than raw but I've found those more involved recipes not only have a longer effect duration (usually 1 hr vs 30 mins for basic stuff) but its spoilage duration is likewise better.
---
Unarmed was the most nerfed in this 'update'. Even me not being unyielding/bloodied, I lost 70% of my damage.
---
Unarmed having also low base weapon damage, the new additive formula renders any damage modifier perk nearly useless.
---
Don't feel bad, I spent an easy several minutes running around and damn circles yesterday. By the time I kind of figure out where I'm going it's on to another day/new event course
---
I'll have to find friends to play with.  I started a daily group to go into my first one ever I'm lvl 51 but no-one ever joined. I didn't join others out of fear of being kicked. I'll play one day.
---
Ammo is pretty easy once you have the trick to it :) I can share my trade secrets iffn ya want :)
---
Very much so.
---
Did you leave off a zero?  Should have been able to smelt at least 10 times as much lead after going through lucky hole mine.
---
Dang
---
I agree. Yes, pistols definitely need a buff. It annoys me when people say they are meant as, "side-weapons". No, they are not. If they were, they wouldn't have a load of perk cards focusing around them.
---
If somebody wants to invest in pistols and make an entire build around them, which you can, it should pay off.
---
Hey the wasteland levelling wasn’t planned from the start , it’s a bolt on fix to there system because there was nothing to hold end game users attention and also because the game is free in game pass now and teams are easier to go into so lots of low levels joining teams and going into high level areas there original game progression route didn’t want them being viable in or account for, true about shotguns etc being end game viable but there’s a reason certain weapons and powered armour etc were level locked and a reason why pistols always did piss poor damage , I don’t agree with their game progression model but I do understand it and that’s why pistols etc will probably get some sort of buff or extra damage legendary so that end game users can circumnavigate their original plan
---
Shitty Time-gating is the hidden subtitle of this game.
---
80% chance to get either an uncommon or rare plan (60/40 split)
---
A lot of people misquote and say 80% chance
---
*upon
---
Yeah, I had noticed that too, but I never really paid *that* much attention before, I just knew it lasted a bit if I’m paying attention, but too often I’ll just be playing and next thing I know my food bar is empty and I go to eat and the food spoiled.  It seems like it was super fast, but if I think about it, I think I had it on myself for at least a couple of hours (which is in game days, so I guess that makes sense)
---
Yes. Even more so with recent additions. 
---
Why do you ask?
---
I really hope they remove it. It’s the biggest thing keeping me from playing more often, aside from most enemies being bullet sponges as well. I hope it gets removed from the regular game and they make a more hardcore server for the psychos that want it.
---
It's almost like a 30% increase to shit damage it's still shit damage. 
---
The Alien Blaster and other weapons like the Chainsaw need legendary versions, and serious buffs on top of that. Like, 3 times the damage, 10 times the damage, whatever it's needed to make them viable. And before someone says *"but that could be op and gamebreaking"* consider that there's no fix to magic weapons, thats no excuse to stop buffing stuff.
---
I'd prefer it actually if they gave us an option to auto loot legendary items, makes more sense to me.
---
Nope just used it because I’m bored at work and messing around on Reddit trying to amuse myself 😂
---
Except that it increased our ammo consumption by 100%+.  It still isn't hard to kill things.
---
It does get easier, it might be Grindy as all hell but I stayed in there, took me forever to get to level 25 but since your level 28 get excavator armor because in another post there was a guy who said to use lucky hole mine for lead and I use it still and the excavator armor will help as if you get the full set the amount of ore you get quadrupled and can harvest and ore node more then once, it helped me a lot, steel can be very to get, we’re I go and get a bunch is west tech because it’s always super mutants with assault rifle and so by also having the scraper perk you get 19 steel per gun and so by the end of one run I have around 400 steel and for cloth fast travel to summervill and there will be a house full of  mirelurks and there be well over 100 books for cloth and acid will be found anywhere really. And by level 50 you’ll get most of your build done and get ammo smith level two as well as super duper and can get ammo factory for a legendary perk and so by the end you can make thousands to ten of thousand of ammo. Also by level 50 you can get the x-01 for power armor and if you finish wastelanders if your going heavy get the t-65 and if your not go for the secret service armor
---
Pistol builds were viable in fallout 3, new vegas, and fallout 4, so I don't think Bethesda would have intentionally chosen to make them unviable in late game this time around. Considering all the problems this game had at launch, and still does, it seems more like an accident. Just my perspective.
---
How do you get that perk? Is there a mission that rewards it or is it random?
---
I like to think the keeper maybe is the person in charge of lore and history in Appalachia. They are the one who makes sure holotapes are in working order and left for us to find. 
---
...or someone has the real answer
---
Please tell me that you don't follow the sub much.
---
This is one of THE tentpole issues that was a part of Patch 22 i.e. changes to damage calculations. What you use to get is no longer relevant now.
---
Might be worthwhile to get yourself informed and actually read the top stickied post on the sub that covers the patch notes.
---
I wish they'd implement what Diablo has done. When there is a legendary drop in the Diablo series of games, a light beacon rises up from the legendary item, making it easy to spot and exciting to chase down. Surely it wouldn't be difficult to toss some light effect on the downed legendary enemy?
---
You could say it is radio-active.
---
No? Sorry, couldn't resist.
---
Same. I hate having to do chores just to be able to play. Plus it greatly changes the way I enjoy to play the last three games. So now it’s a different feeing game, and I don’t like it as much.
---
None of the above. 
---
You'd do better off with an instigating Fixer, Handmade or Combat Rifle.
---
Spoken like a goddamn patriot!
---
Poison resist over the fire one, chances are the things that are trying to burn you are using energy attacks so the healing perk should sort you out.
---
Exactly this.  Sometimes I don't want everything to be a struggle.  Now far too many events are complete shit because they take too much ammo for the rewards which are too weak.
---
In all honesty, I was just quite low on fusion cores and... Wasn't the smartest and forgot to build a helmet on my armor to give me a light source so, I just got the easiest deposits I could find and left.   
---
Definitely could've left with a lot more if I look around a bit some more, I'm sure. Lucky Hole Mine is 100% heaven on a wasteland Appalachia.
---
Thanks!  I appreciate the information.
---
That would be even more useless lol. I have all the mutations I need. Those would 100% be junk and just go straight to me vendor. I guess it’s free caps, problem is no one would need them either if they were in the season.
---
The Western revolver is basically just a more powerful .44 in Fallout 4 as well. I don't think there really needs to be a deeper reason, personally.
---
WhaO man! It's day one for the new over lords at Microsoft. Let them finish unpacking first. Lol
---
It's one of the choices of the new legendary perks you get once you hit a milestone level, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300.
---
Yeah!!! You said the exact thing I want to say
---
It looks like a lewis gun and sten gun had an unholy child. Big tube little side stick mag.
---
LOL! How about during season 4 we get a full set of 3\* legendary armour. Probably be about as realistic an option.
---
Did this last night! Good tip!
---
Honest question, what are the main changes? Aside from the daily op quest it seems like most challenges are set up the same as season 1.
---
Ok awesome. I’m five away from 100, if it wasn’t for this annoying mechanic, I probably would t have ever stopped playing it. I just came back this week after the new update.
---
The best exp farm method are the friends you made along the way.
---
You know what would be cool is to had a mini "quest" where you learn to modify it and cant turn it from pistol to rifle etc... And yes legendary.
---
One event you have to help npcs in a mine. The mobs there all drop prewar money. Forgot the name but it's near westek. Got 100 in minutes
---
I think the free one is bending down and the paid version is standing straight up (I'm not on right now though so can't check).
---
Literally just positioning i think.
---
I miss using my boxing glove. Now I feel like I have to stick to the meta deathclaw or power fist to do enough damage
---
I waited in my own lobby to try it out for first time as I excitedly got to level 50. But no-one ever joined. I don't dare join others, I would just get kicked. Maybe I'll get to try when I'm level 100.
---
The number of things you have to do for the challenge are decreased or made easier. Sell or buy one item rather than three. Kill 10 enemies rather than 25. Complete an event and complete an even in a team. 
---
Basically they decreased the numbers. Then combine that with Daily Ops, which covers a lot of these, and it's wins all around.
---
There seems to be a display problem with damage numbers after One Wasteland hit, sometimes they don't make sense at all. I suspect a bug just in the display, not in the actual damage calculation. Did not run any real tests, though.
---
I mostly just use Final Word when I'm walking around (the 50.cal you get from becket) or i'll use my instigating gatling if I'm sneaking around
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f436ca6&amp;d=sq2s32sr1s01s22s81p10pe2er2cm2ic4s12id2ii0a72a04ls2l22cr0c51a81x03x63ej4x81lt1
---
I THINK these are the perks I currently have on
---
Get a casual team, eat and drink to raise your intelligence, do events.
---
The best event interns of exp farming is A Colossal Problem.
---
For starters, Mr. Pebbles: The First Cat in Space Celebration decorations for our C.A.M.P. and other Mr. Pebbles themed items (like weapon skins, backpacks etc.) If you can reskin it with Mr. Pebbles face on it, do it.  
---
Secondly, the actual event? Maybe it's a series of smaller mission type side quests. Like for example: One could be about collecting cat bowls, collecting ingredients to make cat food and then combining the cat bowls + food and giving them to random stray cats around the map for some Mr. Pebbles: The First Cat in Space Celebration XP.  
---
Then the next little event would be to help build and defend a small shelter for these stray cats, similar to how you would build up defenses and defend a workshop.   
---
Third little quest, craft fireworks and shoot them off at the now defended cat shelter camp in Mr. Pebbles honor.   
---
Not satisfied with my ideas? Well, you should be! Why? Because he's a HERO FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!
---
Have you hit the lucky hole mine with an excavator suit? Should be able to walk out with near 300+ lead scrap. I tend to need acid more than lead because of that.
---
I built one. Didn’t see anything new but of course it could be like the fixer and hiding it’s effects. It’s okay but then I have a lot of extra ammo for that gun as I’m a heavy build.
---
As long as it's in Pebbles honor. After all, he's a hero for CRYING OUT LOUD!
---
Yup my main is 360.  My alts are 65 and 10.  That level 10 is likely never getting played again.
---
*survives because Mr. Pebbles is a hero for crying out loud*
---
My problem with special ops is familiarity. Most of the scenery I am totally unfamiliar with, and often get lost without making a couple runs first, but I fare out well against the opposition and objective. Let me know if you need somebody who serious about running the event and I'm sure I can help edge some critical time off.
---
I really like this idea. I would love to see it implemented!
---
Maybe add in a 10-piece candy bowl as well.
---
100% Funky Duds and Electric Absorption. After that it depends. Take one for the team is decent. 
---
If you have gaps with perk allocations that could use filling, 1-2 special perks would probably work well too. Especially if you haven't maxed out Intelligence (just for XP alone but also for the demo perk if you have explosive weapons), Agility (for full adrenaline), shuffle some stuff around so that you can get max ranks for Tenderiser in Charisma and maybe contribute to the team with sharing at least a 1-2 rank perk card. 
---
However for Charisma, you're better off not picking that perk and shuffling around other specials to get your Charisma up.
---
I kinda had the same thought in the back of my mind.  Keep it lean and mean during acquisition talks.
---
Yeah One Tamriel works for ESO because ammo doesn't factor into the game.
---
Excellent idea.  Turn a 'weapon' that has always been a joke, into a utility item that happens to have a damage rating.
---
That is 3-6 times more bullets than it took 8 days ago.
---
Yes! A candy bowl for our trick-or-treaters would be awesome :D
---
Some pistols need buff not all because if all pistols got a dmg buff it would put the blunderbuss pistols as number one in dmg overall because a lvl10 blunderbuss has 200 to 300 dmg unspec and i found a lvl 50 one awhile ago i didn't believe it myself that i found a lvl 50 but i did and with the right perk set up it could push 1500 dmg pre patch 22 and if it was in the legendary pool a god roll BE fr could possibly triple or quadruple the dmg out put of it and possibly push the realms of 2 too 4k dmg overall which would be absolutely insane
---
The game uses a ratio system of incoming damage vs resist to determine the % of total damage to knock off. Matching damage to matching resist ratio wise results in a flat out 50% drop, with initially sharp changes either direction of the ratio that level off after a point. This is why in Fo4 it was useless to ever go above T-51 upgraded to full as any incoming damage due to the ratio system (combined with the stupidly high defense values of PA) was already reduced to bare minimum. Any extra values would do nothing for the threats you'd face.
---
Now normally, the check of damage against enemy DR is supposed to happen AFTER all modifiers have gone through the gun's base damage (perks, legendary boosts, sneak etc). Energy goofs up because the DR% check happens BEFORE all that. So the total % of damage taken off is using that initial base damage against energy resist. The problem is initially barely noticible, but as more and more of your damage comes from perks and crits and the like the bigger and bigger the gap between Ballistic and Energy grows.
---
[Here's a post on Fo4's steam forums showing just how damn extreme the discrepancy can get when you have heavily armored enemies in both ballistic and energy resist and use roughly equivalent weapons. Danse is used as a practice dummy due to his insane resists due to always being in PA.](https://steamcommunity.com/app/377160/discussions/0/1736589520010279074/?ctp=2#c1733212454825464891)
---
And daily ops and if you wanted too the legendary perk for ammo would be well 0ver double what the production use to be
---
The sentry bot fell first, then exploded killing the Radscorpion, leaving the the sheepsquatch to turn its ugly gaze upon me.
---
Recently? What do you consider recent? It's been very sub par for most of this year.
---
I had to turn off the "x% chance that enemies killed will explode" lefendary perk I was using because half the time it catapulted the body 50 ft away and the smoke was so obscuring that I couldn't see where. Its like batman throwing a smoke bomb and grappling away but its a legendary scorched ragdolling into the sky.
---
Eeeeeeh bows will give you a run for your money
---
Not sure if Bethesda would ever implement something like that but it would definitely be nice. Could also get around a player auction system comparable to the one used for Neverwinter to make trading items between players easier.
---
Lvl 720 mutants in the bog would be game breaking.
---
From what I understand it’s actually somehow tied to your frame rate. So if I’m plodding along at 12fps because I had a bunch of explosions in my field of view, versus someone else has 60fps because they were looking somewhere else, the physics will actually be affected by this.
---
I've never been able to build high-end combat armour out of cigarettes, plungers, hairbrushes and an accordion. But, here we are.
---
Mate, this is a permanent feature. What's the rush? You'll get entities eventually.
---
Omg yes, an open coffin is such an awesome idea!
---
Have a quad explosive cryolater that's very fun for pvp but kinda sucks for normal mobs used a aaex laser rifle for about 50 levels that was pretty fun
---
We need loot sparkles like every MMO ever.
---
If you are concerned about dying from PvP, why didn’t you have Pacifist mode on already?  All it takes is one accidental missed shot (or someone stepping in front of you while you attack) to tag that flag.
---
I wouldn't know, but I imagine it's be the same. Eventually, the problem will get worse, to the point you can turn on the Xbox, the light will come on with the little jingle, and immediately turn off. Nothing will appear on screen or anything. If it's a random shutoff when playing and never ever gets to that point, it's more likely an issue with cooling.
---
I'd like to see more complex objectives and more enemies. Maybe enemies with some mechanics? Right now OPS seem super trivial. Reaching Elder ranks is super easy too. Even solo.
---
I think mirelurk kings give some poison damage?   But your point still stands.   It's not a huge percentage of enemies regardless.
---
&gt; 9perk points for an additional 60% of your weapons basedamage are just too much of an investement for what they offer
---
It's not even just that. With the nerf to Concentrated Fire for commando builds, now anything more than 1 rank is a massive waste.
---
It seems mostly nowadays (with a few exceptions), you're better off with a bunch of single rank damage perk cards than fewer, larger ones.
---
GRS?
---
A few mounths back might have been last year
---
Issues like this are more likely an issue with your network or connection. Check that before assuming it's Fallout.
---
No that was the moleminers
---
Maybe you should have used a drill.
---
Nope. Just the lego perk.
---
Wrong. Have you tested it? I have all the weapons he has mentioned, all versions. The three you mention are second tier.
---
I was scare yesterday i almost comoleted all of the weekly and daily challenges without even trying. 
---
Feels nice...
---
I just wish i could enjoy them with my stealth build. Or if you dont want me to be a stealth rifleman then at least give me a reasonable method to change my spec
---
Have all the heavy perks and even then it takes more than 3 shots of a gatling to drop radscorpions.
---
Fusion cores dont drop for ammo.
---
Makes Sense since you are "taking one for the team"
---
Game wouldnt have the same charm If there was no bugs
---
If you and your friend were both looking right at the same enemy, and had similar frame rates, it would likely land in the same spot for you both. But that’s not always the case; my husband and I game on PCs right next to each other and we frequently watch corpses fly one way for him and a completely different way for me.
---
Does nothing to stop radx
---
There was a Western theme park in Nukaworld, with unique outfits and a bunch of robots. I guess that's pretty much it, a themed version of the 44 that was more powerful because it was on the dlc. 
---
Luckily we didn't get those nightmare fuel worms that moved under the ground.
---
To be fair what isnt spongy nowadays
---
And I learn about this after leveling up What Rads....
---
Wonderfull
---
Aha1 thanks!
---
Yes.somehow the apex mutant is vulnerable to the scorch plague.
---
I run an auto AAE handmade most of the time.  What I’ve noticed is not only has the damage per shot tailed off but I have to repair the damn thing multiple times during a normal gaming session.
---
No way I thought sentry bot would of had it
---
Not too different from my set-up, except I dont have Legendary Perks.
---
Sounds like it comes down to the weapons. Most people I see struggling are rifle builds. Shame Bethesda would tweak the game to the point where an entire weapon class becomes obsolete.
---
That fact we don’t have a confirm trade window proved to me they don’t want a safe simple way to trade items.
---
I dont care because my level 200+ char got a level 25 version, so joke's on you!
---
Or at least include a glowing steak &amp; bottle of lead champagne in its loot.  
---
Since [I like to be wined &amp; dined... before I get FUCKED!](https://youtu.be/5PZpKWcMxGo?t=73)
---
Ok so no account deleting bug but vending is an oopsie ok but ....... did they fix displays i gotta knos man
---
My lvl 3236 got a lvl 20....
---
You can create a team and play by yourself for the extra tiny stat boost, and all your team based mutations and perks will activate. Honestly, there's no reason not to do this, you're missing out on free bonuses.
---
Yes. The frequency and recency of posts on this and filthy casual subs attests to the great player community.  Recent updates have the game on a good trajectory.
---
I have them and have tested them. The answer is Lever Action, because it can be silenced (railway rifle still hits like a mule, but you need the sneak multipliers) and it works well in and out of VATS (the Gauss is still bugged there, plus you need to charge the gun). 
---
And you better start using headshots. Hitting the chest means four or five bullets instead of one.
---
My personal favorite is when you kill a 3* Scorchbeast and it fucking bounces like a basketball into the fissure it spawned from.
---
Fo76 devs are fucking idiots.
---
I had that issue when I uncapped my framerate in the ini files but it went away after I locked my fps with nvidia control panel
---
Plasma rifle or gatling plasma,I have a quad plasma rifle and I think it holds near 60 rounds for me the gatling plasma holds around 300ish not sure off the top of my head
---
West tek, harpers ferry, burrows my usual route for XP.  
---
I’m sure there a lot more places now.   I’d go to where ever super mutants/ghouls are.
---
Definitely and it’s also a pretty damn good player base as well. Only online game I’ve played where I’ve had more positive interaction with everyone than negative.
---
Wait for the next dupe lol
---
Idk how much ill be on ill defo have to max rep raiders like i was supposed to but will deffo be there when brotherhood returns
---
People won’t like it to hear this but I want no part of some lvl 25 chipping in at the SBQ event.  For the majority of players (those not running an alt character) you shouldn’t be doing high level events until say lvl 60+
---
Yeah, it rots. Try using "good with salt" if you want it to last longer, if you have the card available available and are inclined to use it
---
I propose a system that gives you ‘Season Tokens’ instead of some of the esoteric rewards like the Kits or Chems or Supply Bundles. If you really want those, you can spend the tokens on them. If you don’t, you can get a little extra Gold or Scrip or Caps or even Atoms (up to a certain limit for each). 
---
Allowing for more customization instead of everyone getting exactly the same things all the time.
---
I like the flamer attachment but the range is horrid
---
I don't know.
---
Is the vats targeting perk worth it? And also is an instigating explosive LA better than a TSE that i currently use?
---
But Ultracite Fusion Cores do?
---
i like how division handles loot notifications. it's like an ion cannon, can't miss it.
---
I don’t care if they don’t raise the limits (I wouldn’t complain either), but I’d love the account wide caps, scrip, bullion, stash and plans.
---
Yup. I try to only do the event right before the cook-out because I'm terrible at remembering I have it on me before it goes off.
---
 They probably did it just to fuck with you.
---
Yes, some nerfs, but it also made enemies scale to your level, so they have way higher hp, resistance, etc.  With everything now level 50-100 everywhere, it gets harder.
---
 It sucks though that other players don't hear you do it, but I still blow the whistle anyways.
---
33% vats hit chance also
---
I have tons of legendary lever rifles, instigating is the only one "viable" after the update. 
---
The rest are shitty, since the rifleman is expected to kill with one, maybe two shots. If you are going to fire 12 shots, well, go commando.
---
Look on the bright side: you get an achievement for getting vaporized by a nuke.
---
Congratulations though! Here's to many more!
---
Mr. Pebbles got knocked out when I was playing Wastelad yesterday
---
Fog crawlers are classed as cryptids so maybe that could be a factor.
---
Yes this
---
Very good point,  thanks man!
---
  I tend to stick with WS/UF/RR in part because everything is closely spaced, which works well for my usually overencumbered self :)
---
Free looks down, paid is upright.

I assume that's to make it even more secret. They'll see the hinges, think the door opens one way and BAM! They're wrong! Secret!

Try running through Watago EMS if you've done Mayor for a day as there are a ton of containers to trigger pharma farma. Also, I would suggest running with First Aid 3, and diluting stimpaks with chemist and super duper 3 (when you get there). With rank 3 first aid diluted stimpaks work as well as normal ones and you get 4 prr stimpak with chemist.
---
For ammo, first of all make sure you collect something with lead like a battery or tin can and the go to your junk tab, look at the bottom and push the button for component view. Flag lead. Now everything with lead will have a magnifying glass next to it when you highlight it. Tons of stuff has lead out in the world. Also hit up Lucky Hole Mine. It's SW of Fort Defiance near the Monorail Elevator. Jump in Excavator power armor and mine hundreds of lead ore. Smelt to lead and enjoy thousands of lead per run, more when you get Super Duper.
---
Yeah it is part of the possum badge challenges.
---
Look at the damage on that "useless" gun, bro. Plenty of damage despite the level.
---
The real answer won't be as good as this one is. I'm using this one for my personal keeper canon.
---
I was fighting super mutants inside the Burrows yesterday doing the  uplink event, every single damn mutant I killed would explode as it died. Blowing everything around it all to hell. I was using a  non explosive LmG, thought it was very strange.
---
It is on XB1, at least during peak hours.
---
Hell the lever action gun has the ejection and feeding slot on the wrong side....unless fo76 is set in a world of lefties

It's hard to find them all even with a light, but once you know where they all are you usually leave with around 300 ore, more or less depending on how the server wants to act using excavator.  Luckiest run I did smelted down to about 2,200 lead using super duper.
---
Just look up "locamotive tender". It is indeed backwards. The fact they didn't google it first is just... sad.

Primal cuts breaks sneak, I don't know why they chose to do make it that way 😐
---
I just want to role play as Roland
---
Make a legitimate post about how you don't like one wasteland = ignored or downloaded into Oblivion.
---
Make a silly joke about how garbage one wasteland is = everyone loses their mind.
---
Haha good times! Congrats on your first nuke :D
---
If your issue is dying a lot, I would suggest equippping lv3 blocker and swapping marathoner for lv3 dodgy. As the mobs in primal cuts are mostly doing melee hits, blocker will be a lot more useful than extra damage from your mini gun if it’s not your main weapon. And imo marathoner isn’t needed if you’re a ranged build anyway, better to equip a defensive perk instead. They’re what I use and I find they save my ass when a yao gui starts slapping me around.
---
I think if their cards went 20-10-10 instead of 10-5-5 more people would try them. The fact that they are under agility doesn't help either.
---
Instigating is better than TSE because the first shot is the one you need. TS does not mean 1+1, but something around 25%extra damage. 
---
I insist, I have them all. All combos. A single star instigating is  a sniper rifle. Shooting and scratching the enemy with an explosive version can ruin the instigating effect, meaning little damage and tons of bullets. 
---
Also, you might want to try an old-school instigating rifle modded to shoot 50 cal. 
---
One point of concentrated fire is enough to auto-target heads or legs, and paired with tormentor and tank killer, it will let you manage fights with ease, even after your stealth is broken.
---
Your "Well Fed" food buff is wearing off. When you reach 75% or lower "fullness", you lose the 25 to 50 hp (depending on perks) and the game just straight up takes the HP away from you. 
---
It's super annoying and has gotten me killed more than once but all you can do is try to stay full.
---
All builds have been nerfed. If you are playing a non-meta build you are going to have a really tough time playing after the patch.
---
Bloody Mess can cause some comical "explosive" dismemberment. It can make it difficult to find the bits in large fights. Maybe this might be a issue or no?
---
Thats now how you treat Mr. Pebbles. He's a hero FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!!
---
if you want some free lead, steel, etc. (\~1000 of each) I can hook you up with plenty of junk for making ammo, or can just make you some ammo too if that helps, message me if interested I am on xbox
---
The original flamingo plans has 2 of them. One standing up, and one aiming at the floor. 
---
The ones that are in the atom shop are the exact same thing, but they light up now. One you have to pay for, one is free. The difference is that one of them the flamingo is standing straight, while the other flamingo is staring at the ground. That’s it.
---
Good idea
---
Gotcha, thanks for the tips! Now i just need to go look for someone willing to trad for it
---
Sure thing :)
---
Yeah it’s still junk it book bud. Sorry if you traded a whole bunch for something like that.
---
They take up so much space too. I dropped most of the ones I had sans the Mothman and Deathclaw plans - and limited those to a max of 5 at 10 caps each (or whatever 10% of the suggested price is).
---
All multiple hitting explosive weapons need to not have such stupidly low durability. I agree with you. My VE laser rifle barely made it through a Daily Op on a double condition bar and they even have half durability loss in Daily Ops. Ugh.
---
My JE laser rifle beg to differ!
---
Welp I guess my fallout76 run is over. It's not any fun when ever enemy is a bullet sponge and you get creamed by a scorched with a pipe pistol.
---
You can put wall paper on shack windows by this method. Select the shack window. Replace it with a normal wall. Apply wall paper. Then, select and replace with shack window. Makes sense?
---
The western revolver is a Nuka-World DLC weapon, and yeah it literally is the exact same gun, just with slightly different stats and a slightly different skin.
---
Are you sure that's just not Behemoth foreplay?
---
i have bloody mess but is it supposed to like literally blow me up in flames and make me burn?
---
I think you already knew we weren't talking about legacies and just wanted to flex that you had a JE Laser.... which isnt even rare.
---
never seen it :(
---
If you have an armor piece with the “reduce damage while blocking” then you can mostly 1 shot everything with any shotgun. 
---
I had all the shotgun perks, and my bloodied pump shotgun, so I was killing everything in one shot. 
---
But then I decided to fully heal all my dads, I crafted a basic double barrel , and I still killed everything in one shot.
---
Mate just two words -,, Plasma thrower"  :) Turn it into a plasma thrower and you are set:)
---
I'm going to go against other people here and suggest the Instigating Gauss rifle.
---
It can be silenced, hits harder,  and doesn't require every single bullet to be reloaded.
---
I know this. That’s what I meant by “a functioning feature when you replace the walls”. But every time you log back in you have to do it over again.

That's why I said most enemies, Primal Cut throws stuff that's supposed to be tough since a lot of people are gonna be there, and they drop plenty of resources as a reward. People complain about how weak Deathclaws are but Yao Guai and Honeybeasts are supposed to be around their same level.
---
Yeah it’s tough even for meta builds now. Bethesda have said that they plan on tweeting stuff to make the game more balanced but for now you will need to adjust your build if you want to continue playing.
---
The way damage used to be calculated was (1.2x1.2x1.2 x other buffs(bloodied)) but now they fixed it so it’s additive like it should be. Everyone is doing less damage and spending more time on each enemy. It’s a necessary change, and if you start a new character you should have an easy time figuring out what perks to use because you’re not changing builds retroactively
---
I have seen something about the plan you buy for caps, seems to work a little better, the letters actually snap together, and apparently the one you buy from Atomic shop doesn't work the same way
---
Hmm. I didn’t have to do it over every time I log back in. My windows stay wallpapered
---
Meta builds got rebalanced more, closing the gap to other builds, so this is utter bollocks.
---
sorry you lost your 25k caps
---
I plan on actually leveling up a few of them. But I usually use the only time I get every night to play my main. We will see tho, hopefully soon I will have a couple alts that are higher levels
---
Lol the title literally says a little "annoyed" which is exactly what I was. Not complaining. Death is a part of the game. Being a whiny bitch it what you are troll. Walk on and fuck a sock 💝
---
Remember to [extend your pinky finger](https://youtu.be/PUSmHThJ0tE) while holding down the minigun trigger.
---
Took me over 100 to get the fancy shotty
---
lol no, I don't have one of these. It's no more useless than any other pistol.
---
So, is Bethesda implying that if you are only taking the free one, you should be ashamed and only be looking down. While as, if you obtain the paid one, you should be proud and look up? That is some real psychological conditioning there...
---
(I'm joking btw)
---
It's nice, eh? Only thing that is prohibitive is the difficulty of crafting tons of RadShields.
---
Have you tried a non meta build after the patch? Yes meta builds got hit harder than non meta but non meta builds were already dealing low damage anyway. Non meta builds aren’t really viable anymore when meta builds are also struggling.
---
I had heard rifles got hit a lot harder than heavies, maybe its something with how the rounds themselves work (like .50 vs .45 if that makes sense?)
---
I was coming here to post this, so thank you.  Took 10-15 minutes to run this event solo last night, and I shockingly ran out of power cores, and then I stubbornly crawled around in unpowered armor to finish it.
---
Fusion cores aren’t just for guns, whereas Ultracite cores are, so that may be why. Plus because of the legendary perks there’s no real need to farm cores anymore, you can just walk into a silo and get them all recharged quick
---
250k 5mm with bandolier
---
Perk. Card. Packs.
---
I really feel like they should have left at least an area as low level zone. It would work as a "safe" area for lower level players and a nice sandbox area
---
Each to their own. I was sitting on around 7500 atoms for quite a while, then from the contemporary bundle ive been buying again. The cryptic hunter camp bundle, hunting lodge bundle, this week's down bundle, etc. They all exactly what I've wanted since day 1, camp objects to fill out a hunting lodge. Honestly couldn't be happier with my camp now (except maybe if they finally allow trees to be planted on soil tiles so I can finally finish my underground garden
---
If im using an explosive gatling, will my own splash damage help?
---
No it isn't lmao. I was having to fire 2-4 before on most enemies and I'm not even a highly optimised build.
---
Very true that’s why i dont craft them i just vendor hop and buy them since most players sell a lot of them for under 30 caps today alone i bought 500 of them for maybe 4,000 caps? Idk lost track but it wasn’t much.
---
It’s all good i made up for it
---
damn i never thought about that
---
Isn't that the whole point of the game?
---
What's this about pre war money all of the sudden?
---
Yes! Give us all the Halloween! I hope they don’t drop the ball just because we’re not having Mischief this year. It’s been Xmas year round on my tent, would rather it be this.
---
So this.  This this this this this.
---
Oh damn it is backwards... i mean only Bethesda right? Probably some inside joke for them to keep it like this or likely scenario it’s probably just lazy devs that dont really give two shits.
---
The atom shop has been dismal since the seasons started. It seems like they decided to keep making the same amount of paid content but now spread it out over season rewards and the atom shop which means we get armor bundles broken up into individual rewards in the season and weekly atom shop updates where there might be 2 or 3 new items. This isn't necessarily a bad thing for players since stuff like the greenhouse set is obtainable for free when it would normally be an expensive atom shop item, but it means the value of Fallout First has gone way down because there's very little worth getting with those atoms. 
---
As for QA, it's always been terrible. There have been buggy atom shop items since the early days of the game and many of them haven't even been fixed yet.
---
I would be happy if just the scrip limit is raised.
---
Haha ye a sorry about that. I’m bloodied so i was never interested in what rads but hopefully you didn’t spend 250 coins to rank up the entire way... that would be a real wast for ya.
---
Nah it’s fine the way it is.
---
I switch to melee a lot while lvling. You don't need the perks to be good at it just grab a super sledge and run
---
I’m usually always at max caps, I got about 6 mutation serums learned  but I’m definitely not in hurry to get more since I’m not a vendor. 
---
Each day I spend about 1,400 caps, just because I know I can sell weapons and aid items to the robot vendors and easily earn that money back. 
---
I usually go to player camps and buy ammo. 
---
I use shotgun shells, 10mm and 5mm. 
---
I buy .44 and .45 for my gf
---
Or 5.56 and 50 cal for my friend. 
---
I never ever see anything worth buying at another players camp. I stopped looking for armor because I’m wearing SS. And I’ve had the same 4 weapons I’ve been using for the past year. 
---
All the plans people sell are mounted heads, and other useless stuff that I already known. So the only thing worth buying at this point is ammo. 
---
I definitely COULD buy gold. But gold is so easy to get that it’s not even worth the 6,000 caps to just get 300 gold. Each day you can get 200 gold, that if you do that each day of the week you’ll end up with 1,400 gold, the 300 gold you’ll get once a week from the guy at wayward is basically meaningless for me.
---
Cool video bud. Thanks for sharing.
---
You're not alone. I'm saving a lot of atoms. Hopefully there will be something good so I can get rid of my money and then feel bad for wasting money on a game.
---
Killed a three star mole rat the other day. Don’t know what happened, but it’s body literally de spawned in front of me. It and all it’s buddies just disappeared. Never been so pissed lmao
---
That is a fair point and a fine idea!  I guess I just need a few more cores to recharge, then.
---
The Railway is the worst choice, simply because it is not a "stealth" weapon. So while it does do a lot of damage you're only likely to get that stealth bonus on the first shot; after which you are just a regular "sniper".
---
I used an Instigating Lever-Action when I had a stealth sniper build, and I liked it very much. Good mix of damage and attack speed. It does less damage than a Gauss Rifle, but always felt like it handled better.
---
Fair warning, though - BOTH the Gauss Rifle and LAR are horribly broken in VATS: they both suffer from the "constantly missing at 95%" bug, and it will be even worse if you're trying to for headshots.
---
I got so tired of the constant missing that I actually reworked my character into a stealth commando build, and I've been liking it *much* better than the sniper. Until they fix the VATS bug I have a hard time recommending another be a sniper, unless you're a boss at manual aim.
---
If you want good gear just play through from level 1. Don’t use mumbles until level 50, and also make sure to get as much scrip as you can. Spend it all on 2 or 3 stars (if you want a greater volume get 2 stars), then get rid of the crap gear. Keep anything that’s good (even if it’s not good for your build) and trade it on the market subreddit. The whole point of the legendary gear grind is the grind itself, because it keeps you playing.
---
Wow so all enemies drop ultracite cores in daily ops, not just the final boss?
---
 The Ghillie Suit was one of the NW Survivor's challenge rewards.  These rewards were available from May 19, 2020 to June 11, 2020.  After [Patch 20](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_patch_1.3.2.10), a bug occurred in Nuclear Winter wherein every single limited-time event reward could be re-obtained. This bug was active until Patch 21.
---
My username is wet noodle and I hit much harder than energy weapons, thank you very much.
---
While you're at it, grab the Herd Mentality mutation. It's a free +2 to all SPECIALs while on a team, even if it's just you.
---
&gt; The cargobot drop contains over 100 Pre-War money.
---
Tried something similar yesterday. Hide &amp; Seek &amp; Destroy. It had no Pre-War money.
---
Sorry, had to go take care of kids and get to bed!
---
They usually drop the ammo you’re using. So don’t use a fat man
---
There is a silver lining for pistols, tank killer armor piercing perk now works for pistols
---
We have to crusade to get this patched ASAP.
---
Nice man, I never find any in vendors and I love Radshield.
---
You won't get the Pre-War money in that one.
---
Cool video indeed, but shot before One Wasteland.. so not fitting here, because the stealth "issues" began after Patch22.
---
That’s nothing 
---
Early in the game high levels would camp out at the vault and instigate newbies and when survival came along the spawn killing just took over for some. 
---
The game was also so much different when you could attack camps. 
---
But alas, the duckies and bunnies crowd complained and got their way.  Between the nerfs and updates the game is so much more sanitized and that’s great for the food builds and campers but some of us like killing and shooting and blowing things up.  
---
So in other words, no apology needed!!
---
If you play with a friend in your general area all the time, the game gets exponentially harder. It’s most apparent in the silos. My best advice is to grind up to level 50 ASAP so the game gets easier
---
You absolutely need to get level 2 of the perk if you want to use mutations. 
---
You also need to take the perk OFF if you're trying to gain mutations by getting rads, because it prevents gaining new ones (serums work regardless).
---
I am afraid they aren't going to have much for Halloween, especially with Mischief night cancelled (or replaced with something else). I've been looking forward to it since I started playing in May lol 
---
I would kill for that Xmas tent though! It's so cool!
---
I’ll use the camera to search around. It’s usually works but is a little bit of a pain in the ass. It just tells you the body is in the frame but not exact location. Better than nothing  I guess
---
Gotcha! I usually just try to pick heads off with manual aim anyways cus the vats bug is annoying af, yeah i made this build waaaay back in 2018 and early 2019 and now i only recently got back into the game
---
Possibly. I used to harvest rubber in Grafton, and I could easily one-shot all mutants there with my combat rifle. After One Wasteland, my combat rifle does like 16 damage per shot. It was so discouraging, I had to put the game down and havent played again yet.
---
To keep us playing daily I guess.
---
I'm throwing/giving away scrip since last purveyor event. 
---
This has only been requested a thousand times so no, they won't change it.
---
I believe energy weapons are the only ones that would not roll an explosive affect anymore. That's why Exp. Gatling Laser, Exp. Gatling Plasma, etc. are considered 'legacy' since they don't drop anymore.
---
Anything is better than what we have got. But plans and bullion definitely need to be account wide along with transferring all stashes including bullion weapons to all character. I have amazing junkies weapons on my bloodied character. But can't transfer them from that character to my other that could use them.
---
Also I have no desire to do that grind for max rep with the settler or raiders again.
---
Instigating explosive is actually bugged, where the game may detect the explosive and ignore the instigating. Try not to use that effect combo, frequently just won’t work
---
Epic!
---
Yes and they're fine. My gunslinger is easier to play than my bloodied commando for things like ops and does fine out in the world. The only real difference is the game is no longer so puss easy you can throw any old perks together or use random assortments of weapons and get away with it.
---
And so many more people are rubberbanding while working remotely from home
---
Theres a kettle/pot to turn it in during the cookout, but only in stacks of 5, up to 3x for 15 prime meat. Gives you scrip and meat sweats temporary effect.
---
And of course you collect it in stacks of 4.
---
80% is pretty good.  I get something almost every time with it, I'm about out of rewards, I think the only thing I haven't gotten yet is the autodoc disease thing.  And sadly that's what I most want.
---
You need to hit the boss with a normal gatling laser in order to drop cores ( from 2-4 ) in the reward window
---
Na that's not true. I run a non meta heavy gunner build that I put together 2 day before the patch comes out and I have a smooth time. Not even using stimpacks anymore. 
---
I don't get why everybody have such a hard time with the new update
---
Far Cry New Dawn does this perfectly.  They have a little X on the compass for close unlooted corpses.
---
Yes, very annoying.
---
First time playing an online game?
---
my problem i have is ive got about 400 in my stash but cant take them out and i keep forgetting and putting more in when i pick them up.
---
Screw everything, put the auto fire on the railway rifle and go nuts!
---
Right, and by making reputation a one-time thing, it makes me a lot more enjoyable to complete even with the current baby steps, because you know that that little bit of rep you're gaining is progress that's locked in.
---
So it's just the Ultracite Gatling that won't make them drop?
---
And to add to this, I get that people are going to test it out by shooting everyone they meet...but if it doesn't work the first five times you unload a clip into them STOP. Every Meat Week has been full of people constantly shooting everyone and making the event an annoying pain in ass.
---
Plasma rifle with the flamer barrel mod.
---
No idea.  I have no weapons primed.
---
Actually they nerfed it hard, you barely recover any flechetts from dead bodies. Ammo factory and daily ops save the day though.
---
Indeed. Works great
---
Me either.  I have an unprimed Ultracite Gatling Laser.
---
I'd be totally okay with Molerats, and agree to live and let live.... but noooo. They single-mindedly aggro me every chance they get. Little burrowing bastards...
---
Had that with a sheepsquatch.  
---
First one I killed, solo, 3 star legendary. I went into my inventory to pull out my prosnap and the thing disappeared as the camera was unholstering.  
---
I'd be cranky about it still except daily ops bosses with their 500 round per minute, 3 shot kill, guaranteed stagger, explosive mid-air sniper weapons make me crankier.
---
If you want mutation recipes then go to the enclave vendor, you might be able to get them as a reward from the SB queen (unless that’s not a thing anymore) or you might be able to find a player selling them for 10k-15k (with hard bargain 3, grape mentats, the lowest price I got at the vendor was 17,300) so anybody selling it between 10k-15k would still be cheaper. 
---
Steel is probably one of the easiest things to get. Just collect weapons(dropped from enemies)  and armor (found on some enemies and also rewarded from events)
---
Then just go to your intelligence skill tree and equip “scrapper” so each weapon and armor you scrap will give you a lot more materials. 
---
I usually go to west tek and farm it a few times for all the laser rifles, assault rifles and mini guns they have, as well with collecting all the junk items inside I can see, and I leave with a huge amount of steel. 
---
You COULD claim a few workshops. Pop down some steel extractors and claim it from Time to time. But they are so painfully slow that I don’t even bother with them.
---
Get there at :59, before the event shows on your screen, that can be delayed and the event can finish before you get there.
---
You must be playing an entirely different game then. I have a non meta gunslinger character and it was barely viable before the patch but now I can barely even play the game. Enemies destroy me before I can even deal any damage.
---
It’s the same with my bloodied commando. I struggle to survive but it’s at least possible on my commando character. On my gunslinger I just die constantly.
---
It's the same.
---
For those of us that could one shot most things 3-6 shots is in fact 3-6 times more shots as x*1=x
---
Oh and legendary perks should be open and perks shared too. I'm level 425/on my main I don't want to have to have 5  level 500 character just to use the new perks system.
---
I’m hearing the turrets dont trigger that legendary card.
---
I would never use any other tent skin.
---
Yea she n i get low i just straight up vendor hop and i look for camps wit h100 or more meds and i check and see if they have them, eventually i find some and they usually sell them in 20-60 amounts one guy i found a few weeks ago selling 200 of them for 5 caps a piece i nearly shit myself.
---
I wholeheartedly agree.
---
I’m talking about low damage builds like gunslingers. I should have probably made that clearer.
---
Dam.i need to pull mine back out to check it out then.unless I didnt have enough ammo to fill up the clip up to 300.thanks .on a side note  just close range use for you?
---
No unfortunately i tried this with a flamer and friendly fire, didn't end well lol
---
Its even a scout badge challenge!
---
That’s what I was wanting to know. Was going to make a spare cameo arm just in case, but would be great if I didn’t have to waste flux and weight.
---
Sounds like a 'you' problem.
---
They drop in the rewards at the end, not from the bodies.
---
Lets hope it will be available again soon, I don't think MS will keep Bethesda Launcher running.
---
I see the same issues during primal Cuts event.. Fast travel in and boom DANGER.. No matter if any monster has still spawned.. In Danger right away.. Not matter what Armor (Chinese, Chameleon, Uny) or what sneaklevel. It just like in Daily OPs.
---
I mean not really. There are countless posts on here that say the same.
---
I have the gear i need, i have solid gear for alts at 30 when they hit decent levels. My issue is that i got every single piece of it by trading because at roughly 50 weapon types, 20 major legendary effects, 10 minor and 13 tertiary effects rolling the weapon you want is somewhere around 1/(8*10^7) which is not a grind but a lottery.
---
Granted more than one combination will be usable, but the point remains.
---
With class freak 3 you only lose about 12 points of AP 
---
I run with unyielding armor so I already earned a lot more AP back in the first place for it.
---
hate you...
---
Anytime I find them in loot bags or suitcases I wait until I'm logging off and drop them in the water just before.
---
Plenty saying there isn't a problem.
---
He’s meaning that every time you change the skin you have to use the crafting materials like flux, unlike PA paints that are usually just oil. Basically if you don’t run into nuke zones often you might not be able to reskin the jetpack due to lack of materials.
---
Hitting up high density events, mainly line in the sand and rad rumble. Will pop 4 lunch box's and a can of stew before each one. I'm able to get a lot of xp that way
---
I'm also very efficient at kill large groups very quickly curtsey of my je gat plasma
---
yep it appears if just 1 mole rat detects you, then you are now in 'caution' for all enemies in the area
---
ah ha. thanks for the info.
---
Emergency protocols are op af never use my jet pack any more
---
Unfortunately from how they described it would seem you’ll have to use flux for each jetpack and have to deal with the weight.
---
So? How is that a counter argument? There are always going to be two sides and in this case there are a lot more people complaining than praising the update.
---
No wonder we have to give out particpation trophies to everyone nowadays....100% CHANCE is a guarantee
---
Is it not just the scaling? The muties in grafton used to be like lvl 5-15 didnt they?
---
Pure speculation. Counter point, you get level 50 pistols.
---
Too cool!
---
Some people that you see spinning the fire pit or playing the drums aren’t really there, they just left their character doing that while they went out, went to work, went to sleep, etc. They are just standing there so they can get credit for the event whenever it pops up, so they can still get plans and legendary weapons etc. 
---
So whenever they do come back, from whatever they were doing, they can see what rewards they got. The game doesn’t kick you out if it sees you doing something, and you’re technically doing something while on those animations. 
---
Now if you meant other players in general just walking around and stuff. Often times they are trading with each other, comparing plans and rewards they got. 
---
There’s no reason why they stick around. You aren’t missing out on anything.
---
I am be pretty interested a the black fasnacht raven mask. I you are on PS4 and willing to trade. Pls let me know.
---
I think its one giant reference to Johnny Cash's The Devils Right Hand. Even though the song isn't in the game it should have been and would make sense lyrically.
---
I would rather take nothing than getting the Valley Galleria signs for the 4th time tbh
---
Thank you for the detail!
---
I remember that's what a lot of people thought the purveyor would be before she was introduced
---
Also where are all the passenger cars in Appalachia? Why even have trainstation if you have no trains carrying passengers?
---
A lot of players seem to forget you can have a melee build in this game. The only gun I carry is a black powder pistol. Even without ever having switched pacifist mode on, I've never once accidentally initiated PvP combat. Kinda why I asked.
---
My bad, I definitely had too much juice lmao
---
right, but my comment was "i'm (that's me, an individual) still (that means its not a new thing) putting level 50s in 3-6 shots" because my prior experience was that 2-6 was a fairly average amount of shots on the 50s bracket (depending on enemy) and since the balance patch its more a consistent 3-6. I said nothing about people who were one shotting lol. Sorry that the game isnt balls easy for you anymore
---
I have an instigating revolver taking up stash space just waiting for this to happen.
---
Fast travel and gold from smiley... im too lazy to equip travel agent
---
Do the event in Morgantown airport.
---
It stacks or at least used to as well. With other teammates wearing it
---
Agreed, the point of legendary cards is to "increase build variety" but that goes out of the window considering in order to level them up you need to pigeon hole yourself into a specific build because you'll spend your spare cards and level ups purely on leveling legendary cards, which themselves further pigeon hole you into your build, at least if they were account wide the progress could carry over and the cards could be used more situationally for other characters.
---
And you have irrefutable evidence of that?
---
Levels 25-45 were hell for me. It absolutely gets easier once you get closer to 50. Once you're at level 45 or so, worry about your end-game build. Until then, spec into whatever good weapons you find. You should still be adding SPECIAL points to where you'll need them for end-game so you don't have to waste level-ups moving points around like I did.
---
👍 Gotcha. I've noticed I've stayed in Caution with no enemies near-ish, but not the Danger one. I'll try a few events and see if I get the same issue. I really hope its not a "new and exotic" bug.
---
As someone suggested already, you need to find a reliable melee weapon asap. It is a must while grinding towards lvl 50. Allowed me to save my ammo for legendaries.
---
Yes, it gives you gamma rounds for some reason instead of fusion cores..
---
I had this problem the first time i logged out of a world. So i had to re-do them all. But strangely i have never had to re-apply it since. The only difference the first time i logged out was that i had shut all the shutters before logging out. Ever since then i have always left the shutters open, logged out and back in and the wallpaper has successfully stayed on. Not sure if that was the reason?
---
wdym you cant take them out?
---
Ty
---
Rad shields are a huge pain to craft anyway. Not super practical
---
GET 'EM OUT, BOYS!! HE NUKED IT!!
---
Get a load of this guy..... +1 upvote
---
You’re running out of ammo quicker because enemies are a little stronger now, so it will take more bullets to kill them. 
---
So before the update, let’s say it took you 3-5 bullets to kill a certain enemy. Well now it might take you 5-8. You’re essentially spending more ammo, so that’s why you see yourself not having as much ammo as before. 
---
Now for the stimpacks. I only carry about 5-10 on me at a time. With the healing mutation, I regenerate health as soon as the fight is over. Or if I’m able to sneak in the middle of a fight. I usually pop a stimpack if I really need one during the fight. But most of the time I’m able to kill enemies before they kill me. So my health regenerates right there and then. I don’t know what level you are. But try to get the “healing factor” mutation. 
---
Also, like I stated above. Enemies got a little tougher. They also do more damage to you than before. So you’re using more stimpacks because now you’re getting damaged more. Before you probably just brushed it off. But now you notice how much more  damage you’retaking.
---
This game is literally designed to be a grind though. That is what all its mechanics are built around and what people buy it for. Why would you support less overall content?
---
its called hoarding :D no matter what if you hoard things or if you heard sheeps ... :D  
---
dude, I have to watch in-sheeption south park episode again. .... :D
---
PS4 definitely is
---
The quest Leader of the Pack will get you three.
---
Yeah. Search on the sub and you will find more posts complaining about the changes. I’m not going to count them all for obvious reasons but feel free to go ahead and confirm it.
---
Fixed like Skype...
---
Yeah.. atom shop as been tasteless oast few weeks
---
Holy. Shit. You are a certified genius. I love this idea. It needs to happen.
---
High quality PS1 graphics, bruh!
---
Show the numbers then.
---
Scaling is definitely an issue. They either nerfed rifles a bit, or they need to buff them so it doesnt take a full clip to take down an average mutant.
---
My main issue with this game right now is the scaling. I like having low level areas to explore and farm stress-free. The logistics around trying to farm now without using up more resources than I acquire has removed all the fun for me.
---
Ok
---
The most damage of all my rifles would be my TSE lever action. It was useless before this last patch but has come to life now.  That gun basically one shots just about everything that's not a boss.
---
I also have an AAE handmade, FE fixer, AAE pipe revolver, TSE handmade and an AA/50 fixer.  They all do about the same amount of damage, 2 to 4 hits per enemy.
---
 Before this patch I had 9 perk points in gunslinger because I was using a pipe rifle build. They absolute destroyed that build so I remove those 9 per points and picked 5 points in Adrenalin and a few more I can't think of right now I'm at work.  For the legendary Perk I picked the one that increases rifle damage after the 1st shot I don't remember the name.
---
 Just make sure you have every damage perk you can find.
---
"A 1* legendary spoon". Probably a nocturnal spoon too! I wanna be mad with you, OP but that is funny as fuck. Haha.
---
Update: I got it the other night after 3 Valley Galleria signs and two nights of nothing! That felt good, ngl. Really happy with how it looks.
---
Thanks for the info and bless you for random dumping to help others!
---
Hopefully they’ll re-release it this winter and you can get it.  They did do a really good job with it. I’d like at least some of the things from last year. The light up carved pumpkin, the hanging bats, and the damn JOL with candy loot bag. Tired of trying to find my loot in the leprechaun gold pot, but it’s the only one I like, lol.
---
Legendaries should maintain their green, misty glow throughout the fight, even after death
---
Same here 😅
---
It will be until everyone eventually gets the plans from the daily ops. I mean it looks cool, but it's twice the size for the same amount of power from the fusion reactor.
---
Haha I used to do that. I'd always do it and then think "god damn it" when I realise I already have some lol.
---
Then I forced myself to grow into the habit of scrapping EVERYTHING before I throw it in my stash. But therein lies the rub when I need specific items and I've already scrapped them :( ha
---
Rocket Launcher/ explosive expert
---
Bloddied Stealth Commando that is? Because those were/are approx my dmg as full health stealth rifleman.
---
the reactor plan will likely and is likely devaluing but over on the market sub it can fetch a good deal of flux atm. it is not worth nothing at the moment
---
If you kill an enemy in the daily op with the alien blaster will it drop alien ammo?
---
No I'd support the grind just not the restrictions on the grind if I can play all day let me play all day if I can grind legendarys all day let me scrip all day, if I can loot weapons all day let me sell them to vendors all day till im at max caps you can have a grind just let me grind and not restrict me. I'm sitting on 1500 billion tickets because I cant turn them in. This isn't a grind it's time gating.
---
I literally just told you I’m not going to count them. Didn’t you read my comment?
---
Sorry, had to jump off before posting this.
---
apparently they weight too much. you know how there is a hard max carry weight. it thinks its over that weight so i cant take them out and i cant select them singularly for some reason.
---
Thanks everybody. Lots of useful tips.
---
Your experience isn't the only thing that matters. If others are having problems then they're having problems, no need to be a narcissistic jerk.
---
Yeah I probably should have mentioned I've already finished it by doing that &lt;3 Thanks
---
I appreciate that must be frustrating, what platform are you on? next time I get a good legendary combat rifle you can just have it if it means you can enjoy the game again :)
---
I did the same thing. Walked out of the vault beta day 1 planning to be my usual Bethesda "stealth archer" build.
---
Ran with it through mid/late 2019, until the VATS bug popped up and it started getting really annoying when both my sniper rifle and CQC rifle missed shots consistently. 
---
I modded my CQC rifle into an automatic, and immediately saw an increase in effectiveness - especially in fights with lots of enemies. So I ran as a hybrid for about ~8-9 months.
---
When OWL dropped and enemy health jumped up I finally reworked to be 100% Commando based, and it's honestly been fantastic.
---
Just depends on what appeals to you more. I have a Man Cave in my camp so the caps neon letter plan worked better for that.
---
As somebody who buys all the Mothman stuff, even I agree that they're overdoing Mothman stuff as of late... but I do wish I could get that big stupid metal statue!
---
Thanks for the offer but something in me wants to feel like thats cheating. I do appreciate the offer though thanks.
---
Works best with the Mr Fuzzy Ride, when the owner logs off you look like you're riding an invisible bike and the music still plays as you zoom around.
---
You literally can't please everybody.
---
I hated getting almost no XP for killing low level mobs.
---
I've had stealth issues way before patch 22 and even before Wastelanders so no this issue isn't new. It's a reoccuring issue that's never been fully fixed.
---
Did you ever hear the story of Darth molerat the wise...
---
Someone mentioned this yesterday: if you redeem your Pleasant Valley Ski Resort claim slips you get tons of pre-war money to scrap.
---
agreed lots of camp filler items, love the chesterfield sofas and I like the look of the lodge gun racks. we get quite a lot for 1500 atoms this bundle
---
The V.A.T.S. Unknown is the Alien Blaster but with all vats legendary effects. It still sucks though, even if you land a critical shot.
---
"just play and you get stuff" ... "oh you can't just play, you have to treat it like a job"
---
Come on dude.
---
Yup. Close range. Or really when my sniper rifles aren’t going to work real well. I currently get 306 shots per reload.
---
Maybe have a little review system in place like star reviews on certain aspects of the CAMP, so people arent leaving shitty messages about other players (you know for a fact that people will be dickheads if given the chance)
---
I'm going with number two. 😆
---
Seriously. I get that a seven foot tall five hundred pound mutant might need a few rounds to go down but a fucking eyebot is just a floating trashcan one or two should do
---
If it wasn't clear, what I'm saying is: not *most* enemies, unless you're content to farm garbage.
---
They were pretty easy. I finished 2 at the same time at Radiation Rumble: kill glowing creature and kill feral ghouls. The ghouls counted for both. Plus, the Deathclaw there counted as my third huge creature after doing 2 primal cuts right before w/ a sheepsquatch and a mirelurk queen. With all the exp in that event, I leveled up and got the repeatable challenge at least 4 times. And... I guy my scrap 100 money challenge right after the event from the loot. That was good enough for 4 ranks from finishing 1 event.
---
I played for less than 2 hours and got all my daily's and all the weeklies done, except for level up 3 times - I only managed 2 level ups last night.
---
No proof then, just talking bollocks.
---
I have an AA/E Handmade, got a tip for building a commando build?
---
What platform are you on?
---
no worries, I understand but I wouldn't have half the legendary weapons and armor I have now, if not for other people in the community, I feel like you really have to team up and trade with other players to get everything you need, I have like 50,000 steel so I wont miss it if you do need some
---
I think it's the lunch boxes. That's a ton more xp. I'm never sure when I want to commit to using them. Do they carry over from session to session like food buffs?
---
you could try putting them up for sale in vendor machine and getting a friend to buy them for like 0 caps each to drop them back to you
---
Legendaries should have that green aura always and keep it after they die, and it can disappear once looted similar to a meat pile. Boom.
---
I play on PC
---
What are you on about? Have you even been reading my comments or are you just on here looking for an argument!
---
Ahhh shit I’m PS4 lol never mind
---
Yeah that would be great, I meant pre-written adjectives but a star review system would be fun too
---
I do agree to an extent.. pistols need a weight change as well.. how does my 10mm pistol weigh more than my 10mm sub? Morons
---
Congratulations, that’s very lucky. I’m well aware of the ability to have a viable melee build. My Str 15 Main w/ an Instigating Super Sledge says ‘Hi’!
---
Enabling Pacifist should be the default setting. But since it’s not, the best option for players that don’t have any interest in PvP is to enable it themselves.
---
Leveled it to 3/4, but still. Even before legendary perks the rad resist from SS armor helped a lot in nuke zones, I just took a radshield, went in and popped a diluted radaway about every 20-30s. Now it's about one per minute. Have to get rid of them somehow :D
---
Hey you never know maybe in the year 2103 the tender is attached backwards for some reason 😂
---
Yeah, better safe than sorry, I guess. I’ll just have to make a spare and then try to reskin my original and see what happens.
---
.... doesn't stop *suppression*, but does at least make sure the mutation **comes back**
---
Well, there's currently 6300 people playing on steam right now
---
Yeah. I had like 30 something from last season still. And I've been buying them with gold since I've bought everything else I wanted and been at max gold. I buy a few so I can turn in my notes everyday
---
Yeah some pre written ones could work too, I was just more on about like, dont give people a box to write what they want in there or it'll be filled with hate
---
True. 
---
I did spend some time farming strangler blooms (iirc, it's been a while) and had quite a few stocked at one time. Then I started giving one or two to random newbies and using them in nuke zones. Still have about 10 left.
---
Well in that case, I apologize the post just seemed fishy and there’s been a lot of toxicity regarding this topic lately. So yeah sorry about that. The game is tough at the beginning, it doesn’t require help like this but it definitely will help you get into the game and enjoy it once you’re character is built up and can take care of business. With that being said, just stick with it man if you like the game at all you will love it once your character is built up a little bit more. Get through these hard time it’s totally worth it bro I hope you stick around.
---
OK fair enough.
---
They should have it like eso when you die you lose durability
---
I wouldn’t advise this yet. Melee is currently useless against the two hardest enemies.
---
Nowt like petty name calling to let on you've no valid argument.
---
I meant a 3 star enemy
---
It's been 3 days since I had an Elder tier drop. That shouldn't happen. So far, my drops were: Valley Signs, Stash Box, Valley Signs, Caged Bulbs, Valley Signs, nothing, nothing, nothing.
---
The reward system here is ridiculous.
---
We need Mistress of Mysteries stuff. We've had Grognak, Captain Cosmos, and Greylock. C.A.M.P. items for MoM would be fantastic.
---
Well just take 7 of them and you won’t ever worry about radiation until the chem wears off, unfortunately the time doesn’t stack just the resistance. I just had someone hit me with a gamma gun while ass naked in the radiation zone of emmet mountain trench and my character gave zero fucks, like nothing pops up as if after 1,000 resistance you become totally immune to rads. It felt weird then I went afk forgot about the timer and as it wore off I died pretty much instantly I think the first and only number I saw was +879 rads 😂
---
One is free &amp; one isn't.
---
It used to get easier after about level 20, once you could use combat armor.  Then last Tuesday they introduced enemy level scaling.   Then it got MUCH harder for practically everyone.  I would not want to have to try grinding to lvl 100 in this environment.
---
If we gained more hit points with higher levels, like enemies do, it would not be so bad.  But at level 185, i am bad to my lvl 30 strategy of sneaking around and getting sneak attacks with my rifle.
---
That's why tank killer now works for pistols too.
---
I saw several other posts in here about gunslinger builds which are now even better then before the scale just because tank killer perk.
---
Maybe this will help out
---
This is inaccurate. There is a cool down period of 3 hours on each silo. You can launch all three in rapid succession or even at the same time, although that’s likely to put a bug load on the server. On gaining access to launching the nukes you’re given a holotape that tells you how long until each silo has a nuke to launch.
---
Hmm I didn’t know about that. I’ll try it and see if it helps.
---
I just buy them, many vendors sell them for dirt cheap
---
My geiger counter is showing your toxicity levels are off the charts! You should climb back into that bunker below Whitesprings, and seal it tight.
---
Lighten up, Sheldon.
---
Thanks, I didn't know this. I get tired of that mask of shame (I'm a MM addict)
---
They are running out of ideas.
---
Damn ok. Thanks a lot!
---
agreed haha i try to open them in large groups if i have them. Did last night for a group of like 9 people. then everyone else started opening them haha cracks me up to see a chain reaction
---
I swear I sell one for 1500 every other day or so, the game knows I love hanging lights, but 1 plan was enough. If you dont find one before I get another Ill just give it to you.
---
As did I, saved itself had I not laid heavy on the trigger of my rifle prior to the Sheepsquatch’s mighty blows.
---
Im on Xbox. Gamertag is the same as my reddit username. I've got plenty of caps to trade for anything that will make this game fun again lol
---
Nothing like believing only your own experiences in something are the only valid ones.
---
Thanks I might have a chest peice with that perk in my stash.  Is it only viable for shotguns in vats?
---
i haven't tried that. cheers for the suggestion.
---
Why did you show me that?   I can't unsee it.  Every time I look at it now...
---
do your have a mic. and do you listen to basic instructions?
---
yes b33 stealth commando
---
Paddle Balls need a FAT buff, barely can win 1v1s smh
---
That's crazy. I haven't heard about this bug yet. Luckily my pacifist mode is always on anyways
---
I don't believe that. Either they lack the funding or they're being lazy.
---
2 months later, still not fixed. Still aware?
---
Overencumbered...respawns at Vault 76.
---
1: lots of new items mostly acquired through the new to you quest line via gold bullion. Most notable are probably the gauss shotgun and gauss mini although the mini is a tough sell when it comes to ammo. And a new armour set called secret service that is awesome and has a jet pack. They’re crafted with legendary modules kind of like the vault armour sets.
---
2:there’s an entire new quest line that came out with the npc (wastelanders) update you can’t miss it.
---
3:nukes are still popular there’s a new end game boss as well as the queen that you nuke monangah? Mine to initiate. 
---
4:just lots of new items and you can have an ally now
---
5:scrap is worth it in my opinion
---
6:the gap between bloodied/junkies and all other builds has been closed but they’re still top of the heap as far as damage goes but... there was a massive nerf that has made bloodied frustrating for some.
---
What, that meta builds now perform closer to non-meta? I don't think that just my opion, it's been mentioned a few times.
---
I run a gunslinger too and while life got a bit harder (=I need more ammo) I still have no big trouble cleaning westek or doing an ops solo. What exactly is the problem, survivability or too low damage? Maybe post your build?
---
I think people would still be dickheads and just rate camps low
---
Ultracite lasers and gattling lasers do not do extra damage to scorched. That is a common misconception.
---
But yes a bloodied ult gat laser would be great for the Queen, I use a jffr for her personally. And it benefits a lot from priming. The cores are super easy to craft
---
There is a mutation for daily ops that makes enemies explode on death.
---
I will say, you’ll do good damage to everything else. If you’re not worried about doing 25 damage a hit or whatever on Earl and Queen then it’s not a problem.
---
he went out a hero will using his special on the Alligator Abomination, idk if he auto revives when i boot up the holotape today or if ill have to swing by the shady wastelamd doc for him
---
Might be you.  I thought the communist bunker was pretty good, and the fence is fantastic.  I don't have any atoms atm, in fact.
---
DATTEBAYO!
---
And they need to fix friendly fire. I shouldn't have to bash npcs to heal them
---
When i wanted XP i went to high level areas. When i wanted to collect scrap in peace i went to low level areas.
---
Yeah..
---
You know exactly what I'm referring to. This player is having trouble with the game and you're acting like he shouldn't be because you're not. 
---
It's whatever. Do as you want. But behaving like only what you've been experiencing is right and anyone else's experiences are invalid is a total dick move.
---
THAT’S HOW WE DO THINGS IN THE US ARMY!
---
Because even with bandolier and batteries included equipped I had like 50 lbs of ammo on me for guns I don't use. The weight management is tough when you're stocked full constantly
---
FYI: if you own the Free States jetpack, you can apply it to T-65 without knowing the jetpack plan.
---
Also, if you own the Camo T-65 paint, you can apply a jetpack to the arms instead of the chest piece, but you have to know the plan for the jetpack
---
I don’t play on pc but has the mod been updated  to work after the patch? The addition of legendary perks changed the layout of the ui.
---
[you are so f*ckin' suave](https://youtu.be/oHL5F9i6mpY?t=253) for that
---
Hows about a loot all bodies thing when you look into the inventory of one enemy. You know like what eso has all bodies are linked after they die.
---
Read the conversation from the beginning.
---
This! I dont think they envisioned how well tuned woukd players have become. In n previous fallouts it didnt much matter because you were doing your own thing and there were mods and you werent conpeting/contributing with other players.. FO76 being online is a whole new world for them. They are most certianly learning as they go. One wasteland is a prime example of that.
---
I know you said you shouldn't have to be a bloodied build but I don't have any pistol perks and use my 10mm as my primary except boss battles. Nothing takes more than one clip.
---
Relax. It’s simply an opinion. I never insulted you or your playstyle. I simply asked a question. 
---
If you think that’s toxic, you have my sincere apologies, along with my sympathies. 
---
Thoughts, u/beefytrout ?  Have I been toxic here?  Can you offer some guidance?
---
Id like to see some more scientific/medical type use for it, Like give Ward a lobotomy etc.
---
You can very easily do both by just changing perks when you feel like meleeing. 
---
Like the other guy said, bosses will be pointless to try and do with melee. But it works just fine for normal running around and killing things for challenges and quests etc. 
---
Since the Daily Ops came i started to use my old lv120 PA 2Handed Melee alt, and he can do just fine soloing the Daily Ops for example. I picked up first 2handed weapon i could get my hands on and ended up with vampires 40%ss grognak's axe, which i use with your common PA low health build. It two shots everything else but bosses or big enemies like behemoths. I would think bloodied would do even better.
---
Yeah bud its ruthless first ran into it myself 4 days ago was innocently making flux in my camp and luckily hadn't started yet when a low level came behind me and merced me before I knew what was happening. Weird though didnt get the option for revenge or would of explosive plasma exploded his ass back to whatever sorry hole he crawled from. Luckily people were sharing the cause on here so I put it back on. To be honest should of done it time ago with flux dropping again as I like to use aoe weapons sometimes in events
---
👍
---
For non legacies and non godrolls you can still buy a lot of stuff with caps. If the cap limit was raised everything would just cost more caps
---
Last Fasnacht someone said you could use the drills and friendly fire to repair the robots... Twas a load of shite obviously. But that would be a neat feature if drills could repair friendly robots and camp structures.
---
Keep at it. I just had a server lunch ACP, then SBQ, and then ACP in a row. It was chaos for a while because of meat week as well. :)
---
I recommend posting this in a sub that allows bartering posts. 
---
This one does not.
---
its a bit of a process, you have to rough out an area before you refine. arm the camera, walk a bit, look. walk in a different direction, look. circle an area until the camera says "enemy_name" then you walk in the direction looking down until you get a hit.
---
A courier. And one of the Market subredits.
---
I think you have the wrong sub mate. But on the Market subreddit make a post with H: Trade W:Courier then comment on the post !courier
---
Check the market sub.
---
Honestly thats the nuts and bolts of a successful ops. Keep doing you. Youre doing just fine
---
I hit Earle for 300+ with a full-health Junkie's 2h build. Melee is still viable, and it's very helpful when fighting Earle/SBQ if you have maxed out Taking One For The Team and are face-taking. Greatly increases the overall DPS of your team.
---
you can also do what I did which is just find one and repair it not knowing what the fuck it is you just made only to learn that its a useful tool way later.
---
Yes, I even did a test doing a completely non-meta build using All-Rise melee against level 75/100 supermutants.  Without using incisor I was able to 2 shot most of them.  I have an instigating bone club I’ve been using, and I can one shot any enemy in the forest minus crowned bosses or legendaries.
---
My level 63 sniper, only mutation is chameleons, using weightless gear, she can one shot enemies in the mire with an anti-armor sniper rifle (which isn’t necessary given tank killer works too)
---
Non-meta build work fine, some people seem to confuse “not as fast as it used to be” with “not viable”
---
I've been waiting for the red rocket garage to return, for what feels like an eternity!
---
Weird. I’m not using full perks, and mine does 51 damage. No buffs as far as I remember.
---
I've been trying out a junkie's beam splitter laser rifle and I'm actually liking it. I think it might have a weak vats magic effect though kinda like a shotgun.
---
Id say so.. Earl is the spongiest of sponges... i ussually run an endgame boss every play session... alternate between the queen and good ol Earl
---
In terms of per-shot damage, you're right. However, that's the only instance you're right.
---
You're VERY sorely mistaken about the weapons I've mentioned being second tier. 
---
Whether you like it or not, DPS is king and these weapons output more DPS (even in semi auto) than any of those slower sniping weapons ever could.
---
You may do alright with a lot of regular mobs but you're dead weight in any serious event.
---
That would be amazing. I agree, the Xmas tent is well designed and looks really great. I need something flashy! I have the plain tent and a paper bag for dropped loot lol I am planing to pick up anything Halloween themed that they release. I did find one of the carved pumpkin plans in a vendor for 5k caps but it is just a small, rotten looking pumpkin so I really need something a bit better haha
---
I'm pretty sure the updated tos is vague and broad enough that any modification is against it, but yeah, contextually it seems any mods that aren't cheating are fine. Though I have to wonder what "unfair advantage" mods like the ones that make collectables glow are thought of by the people in charge
---
IIRC the Western Revolver in FO4 was more akin in looks to the Single Action in FO76. Not much point in using though since any decent pistol build was VATs with Kellog's.
---
thats a shame, I'm PS4 :/ sorry pal
---
Have you played Skyrim? Explosions are not necessary for Bethesda hyper-ragdoll action. You could even have a sabertooth ragdoll off into the heavens never to be seen again from a plain *arrow*.
---
Yes we just need to spam about durability 😂
---
Bruh just get a better build
---
The extractors are pointless.
---
I've noticed it's being done a lot less. I think people are more inclined to do scorched earth for the extra repair kits. Exfra treasury notes are great if you still have bullion items to buy but a lot of frequent nukers are going to be done with that by now.
---
We aren’t allowed to say the name of it because of silly rules that don’t let us he helpful but there is actually a dedicated sub for this that’s easy enough to find
---
I mean once I get one of those I won't be needing to use the claim tickets lol
---
Yeah the experience is obviously different for everyone but personally I find it too much of a struggle playing a non meta gunslinger build.
---
Thanks
---
This current season is absolutely shit, who the f came up with this idea that radaway and nukashine can be used as rewards. They really went low and cheap on this one. Last season at least there’s a thunderpipe skin and cosmos PA.
---
Mr Ploots soviet hero
---
Anything that can go underground just sucks to fight. Radcorpions and mole rats aren't difficult, they're just fucking annoying.
---
Thanks. Yeah, I was the same with the pipe rifle -- I've got perks in gunslinger, tried to switch to commando but it didn't seem to be making much difference, even with a handmade, but it wasn't an explosive one. 
---
I'll have a mess around and see then, aside from Legendary Perks I can't really see anywhere else I could be adding damage -- got Bloody Mess, Tenderizer... I guess the main thing I need is a greater rate of fire, but whenever I try and use that with VATS, it doesn't seem to work so well. Problem is I like being a sneaky guy, keeping the distance, picking them off, but sneak seems to be busted as well.
---
Not sure how. Maybe it's the NW one.
---
Same! It's the only Mothman themed piece that I don't have and it will go so well in my Mothman church camp.
---
Don’t think so. I grabbed it from the safe. Never even seen one in Nuclear Winter... Which is weird, because I know skins for it work there.
---
Man .. I need to log in . Started working on set this week and I have maybe 30 minutes of game time at night. Been ignoring it since I didn’t think I could accomplish my dailies
---
The revive one isn’t worth it at all. You spend 300 perk cards for only a 40% chance
---
He got a little chippy, and you lobbed some back in return. I wouldn't say either of you were "off the charts" toxic.
---
However, I have blocked both of you just to be safe.
---
Idk. I had on every pistol perk in the game and it said 44. Either way it's still too weak.
---
So would you say that this is not legal tender for all trains public and private?
---
Bethesda: nah
---
Yes it has been updated.
---
Why make your vendor crazy expensive?
---
Mr. Ploots, commie scum FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!
---
microsoft could make like 10 fallouts at the same time im not worried
---
Assuming you downloaded the most recent version:
---
You want to grab SFE from the same creator as well as it enables on-the-fly saving.
---
Perkloadoutmanager.ba2 goes into your fallout76/data folder.
---
dxgi.dll from the SFE download goes in the root fallout 76 folder where the game executable is.
---
Head to documents/my games/fallout76. If you do not have a "Fallout76Custom.ini" file, you'll need to create one by making a new text document and naming it "Fallout76Custom.ini". If you have "file name extensions" UNCHECKED under the view tab in file explorer, you'll need to check it to rename the .txt to .ini.
---
Add the [Archive] entry if needed and then put "﻿sResourceArchive2List = PerkLoadoutManager.ba2" below it.
---
Yeah, I operate a Mothman themed Bar &amp; Grill called "Divine Light" that could REALLY use that piece lol
---
Seems to be yes. When aiming down the sights it spreads the damage with each pellet. So if your gun does 300 damage let’s say, when you shoot, all the damage will be spread across each little pellet adding up to the 300. 
---
But for some reason when you sue vats, all the little pellets end up doing 300 damage, so it’s almost always a one hit kill.
---
*First of all,* ***HOW DARE YOU!!!***
---
Thanks, mate. Perhaps I could have taken an extra moment to word my reply more diplomatically.
---
We can raise this one again and see what's going on.

It rolls the chances for all three if you get them in one go. I've gotten 2 rewards at once. Both 94 stash box plans though. 😖
---
The one on Nexus is the only one out there, and the one people use (like me). If you are not seeing it ingame, double check you are installing it correctly. There are instructions on the mod page.

Did you add

`[Archive]`
---
`sResourceArchive2List =  PerkLoadoutManager.ba2`
---
to your Fallout76Custom.ini?
---
really? never triend to find some special sub for camps :) but thanks, i'll try
---
Daily Ops are the most fun I’ve had in this game in awhile, it’s like Borderlands style mayhem fun.
---
But goddamn it’s just disheartening to make it through an Op (Especially some BS one like Freezing Robots in the Burrows.) just for the game to say “Lol nope go f*ck yourself, you get nothing for today.” It’s like “Wow I’m glad a waited a whole day and used a ton of ammo just to get nothing at the end of this... Guess it’s time to wait for tomorrow and try again.”
---
(I wish we could reply daily ops even after getting Elder for the day and have a slight chance for the event stuff to drop. I get a fun Op for the day I wouldn’t mind playing it over and over for a slight chance to get stuff.)
---
Dude even the lvl 20 molerats are annoying.
---
As a new player I find that most Event instructions are vague or scattered across the Pipboy etc and while I'm looking them up more experienced players are running around like mad completing the task in a manner which I cannot follow.
---
OP, why not post the instructions here rather than just complain?
---
Only difference for me is that I had to equip my damage cards. Magic shotgun build.  To do any damage now so now. So had to reduce my weight a lot, since I was basically a food build.
---
Tbh I love this idea hope the devs put it in
---
No sadly.
---
Sneak still works but they basically disabled it for the ops.
---
 Adrenalin and gunfoo both add damage. I did find out if you put the next fastest receiver on the pipe rifle it shoots a lot faster with only very little damage reduction.  I always used  hardened until I tried the next fastest one.
---
An explosive rifle with 5 in demolition adds quite a bit of damage as well.  A lot of people on this reddit say explosives on semiautomatic rifles is bad but i have used it since Beta and never had a problem. They have always been my best weapons.
---
 I did add legendary luck and picked some vats perks as well.
---
Neat. I have one of those
---
I actually find radscorpions can be pretty dangerous if they catch you unprepared. Thankfully they're not very common though.
---
Mole rats are just a complete nuisance.
---
BM can make for some silly gibs but the burning and flames is super weird and out of place. I would run naked and slowly add perks and weapons.
---
Tried four times.
---
1st: Fast-travelled after killing Williams. Event doesn't count as complete.
---
2nd, 3rd and 4th times: *Server undergoing maintenance in 5 minutes...* (of course couldn't complete it)
---
... so: screw ACP.
---
Tried that. Made an alt named Deschain and everything. Stumbled into a magic double-barrel shotgun that still fits the overall cowboy aesthetic, and the stopping power is just too damn good to deny. :(

---
your offline so i cant join your game and didn't respond to party invite.
---
I wasn't looking for one shots. I was having a moderate time in general playing and it felt like the game was fair. This just seems to be another push to make this a multi-player team game and not a solo adventure like fallout used to be
---
I see, ty!
---
They’re about to buy more studios . 7.5 billion is chump change to them . They paid like 26 billion for LinkedIn and like 9 billion for Skype
---
I agree 100% but also Would be nice to to get repair kits from cp and maybe make the the glowing windigos drop glowing meat at “colossus problem” cause i think there intended too the ones on the map I encounter drop it weird it doesnt for cp
---
And you know why they should? Because he's a HERO FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.
---
(Seriously though... he IS a hero)
---
It’s a gender reveal
---
People have been asking this vary thing ever sense you could in fact have a cow, and I will tell you the same thing I have told them. No, and I’m going to take all your razor grain too.
---
Perk Loadout Manager. Keretus is the author, and all his mods will change your game for the better.
---
You'll need to install the SFE dll to get most of his mods to work. That file goes in the base game folder, with the Fallout76.exe
---
The mods themselves go in the \\Data subfolder.
---
You'll also need to either create/edit the Fallout76Custom.ini file located in your Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76 folder OR use the Fallout 76 Quick Config program from Nexus. 
---
If you go the manual edit route, and you only have the PLM mod installed, you'll want this line in your Fallout76Custom.ini file:
---
    [Archive]
---
    sResourceIndexFileList=PerkLoadoutManager.ba2
---
Add more mods by separating their filenames with commas. In general the order doesn't matter, but if you add the chat mod, it does need to be the last one on the line.
---
Cause it has a beautiful view and it's on top of a mountain, where stuff costs much more 😝 it's a roleplay choice... I've got crossbow bolts for 1 cap tho!
---
you can legally hack the plasma flamer with the pulse receiver from the plasmacaster (can be bought in vault 79).
---
it turns the plamsaflamer into a ranged weapon, but i dont liked it verry much and built it back to prime
---
Tell your Str 15 Main w/ an Instigating Super Sledge I said hello. LOL
---
The chainsaw would be viable if it had a lv 50 version and legendaries. The damage isn't bad for a level 20 weapon.
---
As for the op's having no sneak I take out my sneak perks and add defensive perks. I use a VE handmade and can stand toe to toe with any enemy without losing any health.
---
 It may take a few extra bullets but I'm barely taking any damage because of the health regen
---
On "today's" rails, that might be true. But the mighty [J-Class 611 steam locomotive](https://hawkinsrails.net/steam/611/611c.jpg) regularly made passenger runs and the occasional coal run to/from West Virginia before being retired in 1959, despite derailing in 1956. Only thing keeping the J-611 off the rails today is Amtrak/CSX being a bunch of dicks.
---
But yeah, that coal tender is total backwards.
---
Ohh is that why I've seen it a bunch lately without seeing an Atom Shop listing, actual dlc
---
Someone did it a few days ago, I joined it just to see how it was after Patch 22. 
---
Pretty much the same, and not really worth it.
---
I don’t really find it worthwhile anymore. After the nerf it’s a lot harder defeating earl. I was in a full instance last night and we weren’t even making a dent in its health. Everyone left and I attempted to solo it but when I reached the point where he regens all my weapons were broken and I decided it wasn’t worth the amount of ammo I would need to spend. The rewards just aren’t worth it.
---
This is 100% true, I have no idea what all of these people do that make them unable to play the game. You have to take the 3 cards for damage perks!
---
&gt;What are the builds people are targeting these days? I see a lot of talk about bloodied and junkie. Are you guys using some site/youtube channel to decide on builds?
---
It's pretty much the same as before - Bloodied, Junkies, Tank/Vampires paired mostly with commando or Heavy PA for the most part.
---
The only one that possibly got knocked out of its position are melee builds which seem to be doing it tougher than they use to. Rifleman builds are doing it tough too but they were never apart of any serious meta talk in my experience.
---
If you send in a support ticket requesting a refund, you'll get the atoms back and keep the set. It's unethical, but so are they.
---
What you would like to see?
---
But I don't want to trick people :^(
---
I mean it's a pistol. Obviously an auto rifle is going to beat you in damage. Pistols can be fun but they aren't supposed to be super great weapons. They're light so they barely add to carry weight, and they can do a decent job outputting damage, but obviously any larger weapon with a better caliber, higher rate of fire, and bigger mag is going to hit harder and get the job done faster. Its a trade off.
---
Exactly. One wasteland brings new relevance to areas once forgotten.
---
If you squint real hard, it almost looks like the [J-611 Steam Locomotive](https://hawkinsrails.net/steam/611/611c.jpg), with the coal tender connected backwards.
---
I had to remove all my turrets just so I could have a pet again... Now whenever I spawn into my camp behind the Helvetia post office and every scorched in town rushes my base, it’s only me and my pet Deathclaw Mr. Cuddlesworth defending the house. (And Beckett if he decides to run out.)
---
Fair enough
---
I think it would be wonderful! I also really like the workshops and I feel a lot of potential lost in them. I think it goes against the rules because it can be considered “post marketing” to put the link here, but if you want in my post’s history there’s a recent one about workshops’s. I believe that we could organize ourselves as a community to make  those ideas reach Bethesda.
---
Ah. Thanks. Knew this had come up already.
---
I like coming to Reddit and unintentionally learning shit.
---
When I was like a level 25 I got my first handmade on a god roll and needed 5.56, was vendor hopping to try to buy some and some level 300 just dropped me 10,000 rounds for it that was nice (:.

Don't give them ideas to take my money with
---
So the smallest weakest gun in real life is the smallest weakest gun in the video game?
---
Yeah, and?
---
Clearly a joke. Woosh and all that
---
Folks I don't know what to tell ya. I run a bloodied gunslinger and absolutely whip ass with him, even post-adjustment. And I use revolvers, not 10mm. I'm working on getting gauss pistols but this guy is my 3rd time through the WL campaign and I'm struggling to find the motivation. 
---
I also have a berserker rifleman/commando and while he's still ok out and about in the world, daily ops are just not an option for him unless they allow stealth to factor in or give berserker a big time buff.
---
I want to up vote this but it's at 69 so just know I did it in my heart
---
The journey is the reward.
---
You're going to have absolutely everything from Ops in a couple weeks anyway.
---
I would like an engine on par with rdr2, but in the fallout world. I want tears in my eyes when lighting strikes dammit.
---
i just want the Easter eggs from the previous year
---
They should disable all the ash and goo pile effects because they STILL have not managed to fix the respawn bugs from launch where enemies turned into ash or goo piles may not respawn properly.
---
He says *‘Who the hell is that, boss?’*

I replied *’A living legend, my boy. A living legend.’*
---
Hmm, I think the DayTripper is wearing off...
---
I do SBQ for the four flux.  Last thing I need is more repair kits but they are still piling up on me.  Used 15 last night for the weekly challenge, just need to use the other 540 of them now.
---
I "only enjoy 76 when it's your (my) own personal hyper-optimized wonderland, at the expense of the broader game and broader player base.".  YES.
---
Everything is meaningless "unless they (I) could jump around in stealth and 1 shot 99% of enemies.".  YES
---
Such a weird issue to have. Seems like all you’d need is a minor change in the formula(which should be almost the same for ER as it is for DR). It amazes me ppl who play this game are smart enough to figure out these issues, but we still don’t have a fix for them lol
---
even at 1 cap some plans dont sell (looking at the 27 mole miner plans ive got set at 0 caps)
---
It is not new, however if the corpse just falls it will probably be near the same for everyone but if your near a ledge for some people it might have fallen off for others it might not, and if an explosion goes off it will fly in a different direction for everyone
---
All I know is braham milk spoils faster than you can milk your braham.
---
The revenue from the monthly scrap box rental fee is all they care about now.  There's no dedicated atom shop team - the designers are busy preparing new items for each season now.
---
Xmas survival tent!!
---
Do you use the bloody mess perk?  Or were you buffed with a lunchbox?  Either of those can cause enemies to explode into chunks when they die.
---
I made a daily op team so me and my buddy could get her Elder rank yesterday. Two other people joined the team and went into the OP, kept doing question mark emotes and whatnot, I could tell they were getting annoyed waiting on me but I didn’t make the team for them... I made it for my buddy. So I’ll continue to wait until said buddy arrives.
---
(Plus... It’s my team. I’ll do what I want with it.)
---
You've seen the state of the atom shop lately...they need our help 😂
---
Yes, it will. I farmed 300+ alien ammo yesterday
---
I think it's the people who were using semi-automatic builds.
---
Automatic builds like heavy gunner will always be fine and useable.  Riflemen builds for example took a huge hit and they were already far from meta
---
Haha, post-apocalyptic Sims is a great way to describe it. Keep on keepin' on, friend! Take good care of yourself.
---
I don’t think fps has anything to do with it, just that if an explosion sends the body flying it will be flying different direction for everyone
---
You ask why the lesser revolver has the skins and the worse one doesn't. I ask why my double barrel shotgun doesn't have any skins despite how good it is.
---
Hopefully that’s true! If this was the devs under Covid *and* Zenimax being stingy, then the game could rank up much faster! It’ll probably just depend on if Microsoft thinks they can salvage F76. They definitely have the marketing power for it and a change of ownership might be a good boost to Bethesda’s credibility
---
I just hit level 44 and can confirm. 25-40 were a total bloodbath shitshow.
---
Flex? Are you insane? Legacy weapons are common on the market and easily avaible. There is nothing to flex about.
---
Is it less flux for Earle? Genuinely can't remember.
---
This needs to happen. So many modders are ready for private servers...I can't wait to see what they can unleash on a private world. Imagine being able to go to New York. Imagine being able to fight on the back of a scorchbeast. Where the fuck are all the horses and/or their mutations.
---
"Maiden nuking" okay Braid
---
Wait really? Cause I thought meat piles were entirely client side, as they only appear if there’s still loot in the body and once you take items it disappears
---
Open a ticket
---
Or people are just running daily ops. I did the event at level 20, it’s very accessible now. That character just can’t launch a nuke of his own yet.
---
Wait, you have plans to make ***Mole Miners***?  What system are you on and how much do you want??
---
 I got several times a low level camp with a shit ton of incredible max lvl gear. It was a mule camp. So at the end you can never know what to expect when traveling to a strangers camp that's what I like about vendor hopping
---
I am aware, but you shouldnt discount the idea that the majority of players do dislike fallout first just because they watched the video. In fact, the fact that people are making videos saying fallout first sucks more compared to making videos saying fallout first is good represents the discontent in the fallout 76 community.
---
This has been suggested before and the trouble is most people don't bother levelling mules.
---
In my experience player level has little to do with the quality of the vendor at the camp. 
---
I've seen it all.
---
* High level camp with meme content
---
* High level camps with just junk (not the crafting material kind)
---
* High level camp in a low level area catering towards new players
---
* High level camp with ludicrously high prices
---
* Low level camp that's are obviously someone's mule account with a ton of legendaries
---
* Low level camps with popular items being sold at a good price
---
All level tells you is how long someone has played with that specific character. That's it. It bears no meaning elsewhere. 
---
It's not even a good indicator of average value of the vendor, at least in my experience. It's a total crapshoot either way.
---
It's not just the overall lack of damage that gimps pistols right now. Agility is overwhelmingly crowded with good perks in addition to a majority of pistol-related perks. Adrenaline, Gun Fu, Covert Operative, Sneak, etc. You've got all these damage-increasing perks that rifle builds can easily access since all their weapon perks are in perception. Meanwhile pistol builds have to somehow fit their base damage perks in with all these additional increases, and generally lose even more damage no matter how you do it.
---
Even if they decided not to buff the amount given by the damage perks, they should at least make Gunslinger/Guerilla single-rank cards that give +20% each. It would free up 6 agility points. Some miscellaneous improvements like a silencer for the .44, automatic mod for the alien blaster, much higher damage for the single-action, etc would also help.
---
There’s still PA, a few skins for weapons, lunchboxes,  a couple nice camp items, and a new building set, and a pre-fab BoS bunker structure in this one. Other than the radaway and nukashine rewards, this season is better.
---
All good. Thanks anyway!
---
That might bring that back. Although I’d prefer to see a different version to set them apart.
---
That's my point.
---
No it’s gambling and we all know we’re not guaranteed the reward I’m simply arguing against his analogy of being rewarded for nothing
---
Didn't know the neon snapped, that's handy alright - I always wind up spending ages aligning letters...
---
Right. I have to use the grocer’s mod backpack to do away with thru-hiker and be able to stack all of the other agility perks I need.
---
For sure. I have to use the grocer’s mod backpack to do away with thru-hiker and be able to stack all of the other agility perks I need.
---
First time playing an MMO?
---
The deliverer was left out because in fallout 4 deacon says that it was made for a certain person in the railroad
---
That’s weird. I’m sure I’m doing more damage as a Bloodied and I can’t get very much past 200. Unarmed does great damage, 1 or 2 hit on most enemies, but like nothing against queen or Earl.
---
I want the option to romance a lvl 100 molerat
---
Are you sure you don't have Grounded mutation with Class Freak 3?
---
Class Freak 3 will reduce -50% Energy Damage to -12,5% Energy Damage.
---
51*0,875 = 44,625 = 44
---
Snow 🙏
---
Gauss rifle by far. It's already powerful even witjout perks or stealth crits.
---
I find my ops take around 6 minutes. So three minutes in I should change to ops team? Hardly seems worth the XP for just 3 minutes of killing and the stress of trying to change teams in all that chaos.
---
I can also not agree with that sorry :D
---
Semi rifle builds will always be not that good as there full auto Bros. But even now without a single perk for rifles, I can more or less one shot everything with a black powder rifle. I have a  Instigating BP Pistol. Not even the rifle . Headshot deals round about 1,2k dmg lol everything is one shot
---
That happens in a few cases. I forget which actions fix it but you can without restarting. Try going into camera mode and changing pose, try zooming in with your gun, try swapping weapons. Those have a habit of fixing 90% of animation lock ups
---
Remember... teachers find and wear the mask. Find and refill the mask with buckets of candy hidden around the school.
---
Students! Hit the teachers like a piñata. Candy will fall out of the mask.
---
I dunno, I kinda like the current feature. I remember when I first joined during the first Fasnacht and the title screen kept going through the scenery and the streets of Helvetia all decorated with Fasnacht stuff... Good times.
---
I'm sitting on a ton of Atoms over here (Thanks FO1st) ITS OVER 9000!
---
Do you get ammo returns for the Alien Blaster from the Daily Ops?
---
Think that was supposed to happen as part of the Op. It's labeled as "volatile".
---
Outside the ops the sneak damage bonus isn't registering in VATS. It does if you aim down the sights it works but in VATS it doesn't anymore. I'll take a look at Adrenaline and GunFu. Hadn't thought about adding demolition. Got plenty of perk card points so I can mess around that. Thanks, appreciate the help.
---
I had a cultists knife with 40% swing speed and it was really fun running around in a straight jacket pretending to be Roberto from Futurama.
---
One of the main reasons that they have for the new system was that they didn't want people running around like gods in low level areas but I dont get the logic there. I mean, were all fallout fans, and thats exactly how fallout works. You get to really high level and then you can go back to the starting area and kill molerats just by looking at them. I get why the dynamic changes when its online but I feel like they listened to the very small minority of "im bored of 1 shotting everything" and now those same people are still 1 shotting everything but the rest of us lost this fun element of the game.
---
The contemporary camp just came out pretty recently... just wait a bit buddy.
---
For me is the poodle skirt and it has been an eternity, not just a feeling, a proper eternity.
---
Even Slug Buster can deal with enemies easily and everyone can just get that by playing the story or buying it off another player for a few thousand caps.
---
That's how the burrows be
---
Damn.when I get home I might pm you.i need to check this out.i might have my guns mixed up in my mind.the one I have is like the slug buster reward from wastlanders
---
Black powder build?  Sounds like a good idea... until there is more than 1 enemy.
---
Now all I'm thinking about is the mass casualty situations in Line in The Sand. The number of times I've seen the OTHER PEOPLE'S CORPSES sat around the area that aren't loot-able for me. But it's creating so much asset drain on the server that it completely turns into a PowerPoint presentation. When they layer up where there's a corpse, an ash pile, a meat pile, AND a nuclear goo pile all in the same area but only one of those is loot-able for me. 
---
The number of times I've just said "you know what? Fuck it. Not worth trying to fight to try and get this stuff I'm out" is insane. I would like to have an easier way of doing a "loot all in area" for situations like LitS
---
Some guy opened like 9 lunchboxes at the end of meat week. It was pretty cool to see all the buffs.
---
Are you full health?  Junkies?  Neither?
---
-More rare vendors/more items for rare vendors.
---
-More plans for caps/recipes, not gold.
---
-They could make meds and junk a decent price at vendors and I'd buy the shit out of it. I'm sure others would.
---
-Something that is a gamble with high risk high reward. Maybe a once a day legendary mystery pick, npc you can send to collect a certain item who can show up with nothing or an abundance.
---
-Someone who fixes gear. I avoid using my junk as best as I can.
---
I just woke up, but this is what I have off the top of my head.
---
You’re right Bethesda could mess that up to
---
Marble statue please

While it absolutely would work to drop ranks, i wouldn't want to nerf myself even more than bethesda already did (atleast too much). Especially with the freedom with legendary special perks. Here is what i'm using atm [my personal build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4e44aaa&amp;d=xm3x83x73x43x90xa0s01sg2pg2ph2pi2pp2p00eu0eh2ce0cu2ib4ic3ir2s12an2ao0a30a72a04lt2lu2l71lk2la2lv0a51po1&amp;w=ar1l20lg2c62&amp;m=051c29f7b3&amp;am=18-18-18-18-18&amp;wp=w6w6w6&amp;wm=142535-142835-1l2835&amp;n=My%20Legendary%20Commando). Working on maxing STR/PER legendary perks, and those points will go to STR to make this build a Heavy Gunner / Commando. When i get the STR/PER maxed, the build will look *something* like this [build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=aa44a8a&amp;d=xm3x83x73x43x93xa3s01sg2pg2ph2pi2pp2p00eu0eh2ce0cu2ib4ic3ir2s12an2ao0a30a72a04lt2lu2l71lk2la2lv0po1s31sr1sq1s21sx1&amp;w=l20lg2c62&amp;m=051c29f7b3&amp;am=18-18-18-18-18&amp;wp=w6w6w6&amp;wm=142535-142835-1l2835&amp;n=My%20Legendary%20Commando).
---
Sure it was butchers bounty? I dont have it in any of my characters but I was recieving double legendary drops for a while last night. Nothing good unfortunately.
---
It usually has 20 or so for me.
---
Dropped Connection care package at the end always contains pre-war money.
---
Also don't forget safes, they frequently contain pre-war money as well.
---
It does.
---
Well, for me and my brother at least, the game doesn't really run any better even when the graphics are worse.  On XBox One S for both of us and usually pretty quickly into a session the textures start failing to load anything other than the worst LOD texture even up close, but it doesn't seem to affect the framerate much.  I hardly take photos anymore because they all look terrible with the bad textures.  When taking a photo at least it would be nice if the best textures were forced for the photo.
---
But yeah,  even when the graphics looks like butts all the time, it doesn't really help.  And all the extra explosions certainly didn't make things better.
---
I'm at 25. I have some friends at 32
---
Haha I remember when the v94 raid came out and this guy got a drill and no legendaries
---
I'm at 14. Haven't had a lot of time to play this week.
---
25 points away from level 30. have skipped a few dailies.
---
&gt; ultracite Gatling laser
---
Bethesda: Introducing a BoS Gatling Laser Skin! (does not apply to the ultracite)
---
TBH I would love a Nukashine skin for the LMG/MG42. something in the vain of the Lullaby Lucy skin for the minigun
---
the gauntlets. mybad. havent slept for like 30 hours.
---
31 and 4 weeklies left
---
More repair kits too.
---
R40 have 1 weekly left. None purchased
---
Ha at least there's some nice views to make the walking worth your while!
---
While keeping in mind that we are naturally engaged in fantasy firefights, I find it odd that there is no attempt in FO76 to basically start with the ammunition used to determine the base single round damage potential. The .45 cal round is the same round used in the pipe revolver and lever action rifle for example but the damage is wildly different in the game. A longer barrel only improves accuracy and that should be easy to include in the game's coding. Beyond base projectile damage per round I think the easiest to change missing handgun component in FO76 is the obvious lack of mods. Why are there no silencers for the .44 cal handguns for example?
---
If you still eating Vault-o’s and brahmin milk son, I got 99 problems pre-war food ain’t one.
---
It's all random drops.  You're just as likely to get it if you are playing drums, as long as the event gets to 100%
---
Nice work!
---
I scroll through public teams to check the players level before FT even though it isn't indicative of vendor quality. I've personally never been to a mule camp with amazing gear, but that doesn't mean it can't happen. I've been to plenty of high level camps selling useless garbage, so it's always a gamble. Displaying level might prejudice against new players trying to eke out a living though, so that wouldn't be very fair.
---
They are massively duped so arnt worth much. Their main worth is that you get caps when you open them. So they act as a sort of alternative cap
---
I would love for an M60 Mod. where it drops the rate of fire by a lot but increases the damage and accuracy. and then add an M60 and MG34 Barrel option. hell any mod option besides just ultracite ammo. I love the gun but I need more options. it has the slots already made.
---
Yeah this would be helpful, but I'd even settle for a quick reference point on the map for all the players on the server and their level. I usually don't go to a camp vendor until I can find them on the map and check their level. An easier way to do that would even be good enough for me.
---
Omg I totally agree. Also the fallout 4 train you see everywhere that isn't even hitched to the dam carriages
---
They are buggy and a lot of weapons display absolutely terribly
---
so it is finished as it has the same amount of attachments as the LMG
---
I thought the difference was the atom shop one had lights, but no one is mentioning this so now I feel thrown off
---
You're a hero. This challenge was a ballache to do without a map
---
The real MVP. Thanks!
---
#microsoft. Pls get someone to fix this?
---
Gauss pistols straight up suck in my opinion. You literally can't hit the broadside of a barn because of the gauss issues.
---
they did update the road map to mention new weapons. so I hope they add it there. and add some weapon mods to other guns like the LMG
---
To be fair. Hand guns have always been bad. I had one char lvl 70 handguns and God it was hard
---
You could solo Earle with pistols??
---
My mule is constantly loaded up with all the stuff my other characters find, he’s only level 9.  My bloodied commando only set his camp up as a drug den, so it’s mostly just for looks (though people do buy the stimpacks and chems I sell).
---
I don’t know if level is really any good indication of anything.
---
Edit: what if instead of showing the character level it shows the highest level of the items in the vendor?
---
Ooo, are you on ps4? I’d love to stop by for a mothburger
---
I hope it gets on sale at some point. or just building kits on its own sells for a reduced price since it wont include the other items i dont want.
---
Yes it was a good trade I guess there is still some good people out there
---
Ok, I get that but how do you trade up when everyone is trading godrolls? Seems like you'd have to luck into a godroll yourself to start. I'm over level 150 and don't got much to my name. Been trying to buy / trade for some shitty 2* bss/jss dcg for over a week now and all I'm seeing is people wanting to trade for a bear arm or power fist of the same modifiers. So I trade for something worse so I can at least play unarmed for now... a jss death tambo. Now I still can't go up from death tambo to dcg cause no one wants a bundle trade... just more bear arms or power fists. &gt;.&lt;
---
I think your last sentence should read "pretend to be LOW level to get free stuff".  We know what you mean though.
---
I'm in no rush. After the hell I went through with the shotgun and the mini I'm not exactly kicking down the door to start another module grind. By the time I get a good one maybe it will be fixed. And if not, well, I've still got my existing collection.
---
I thought the slocom joes bundle was a good addition but that was early summer. They can’t always be great, but on the bright side at least you have more time to gain more atoms in the interim.
---
So we should expect Fallout Teams instead of seeing fixes?
---
Thats what i thought , but last event someone posted the datafarmed info on what the event counted .
---
Yup and oops.
---
With Carnivore and Strange in Numbers, you can get +200% melee damage with all (7?) food buffs. Add some Psychobuff, have TOftT active and you start hitting pretty hard. I think I was getting 330 or so damage with just 5 of the food buffs. TOftT is multiplicative, so it's pretty powerful.
---
Super Mutants are the most common high-ranking xp sources if you need to go out of your way to hunt stuff down. Otherwise just boosting your int and xp gains and playing in multiplayer events is good
---
What system are you on? I like checking out camp builds
---
Sounds like a waste of time lol whenever someone is up there I always have to FT multiple times to actually get to their camp. I'd be pissed to see a bunch of overpriced crap in the name of "role playing"
---
This and the Christmas Collectron
---
I've never once seen work and I killed myself 30 times just to test it.
---
Not worth it anymore. That wave has passed a few months ago. Unless you need plans you don't know or just some caps, thats pretty much it.
---
Absolutely! I've found some of my favourite CAMP spots this way.
---
It’s hard. This is why we have money in a real economy rather than barter. You have to luck out. Either you find someone willing to do a 2 or 3 for one trade on a god roll or you luck out and find one for caps in a machine or the RNG blesses you with one. My first step into high end trading was buying a BE15 handmade for 24k caps in a vending machine.
---
I run this event every double xp weekend as much as possible, and it seems to pop a lot.  Great XP, scrap, and sometimes you get a ton of legendaries.  I've only had it happen twice, but if you get the mask, head to the candy refill but don't pick it up, if the mob that spawns has a legendary in it, kill them quick and you might get the same group over and over again till the round is over.
---
level 100 molerats it's fine  
---
level 100 molerats that has more health than supermutant however......Srsly who has this briliant idea to put spawn of satan on Apalachia????
---
Level 25 with 6 weeklies left
---
*Awww...* I got excited for a moment and thought I could get a new statue. 😁
---
Yes, I love his dialogue! I think for sure they'll bring the Collectron back and I will definitely snatch it up.
---
What do you do if you encounter the respawn bug? Restart the game?
---
This has happened to me at least three times and that's what I end up doing.
---
Yes I found it and it’s on display at my camp now it’s Arthur woods retirement lighter
---
Rank 26...skipped a few challenges....but enjoying it so far :)
---
Praise Him.
---
It popped pretty frequently in the past... But at one point when I was trying for the platinum trophy, it took 3 weeks for me to catch it going on a server 😳
---
Pre22 I used to run this event exclusively with my flaming longbow chainsaw!  Just keeping it on and swiping it left to right, none of the ghouls could hit me.
---
I truly love this sub.
---
PC :/ But thanks anyway! If I see an explosive combat rifle I'll give it a shot, no pun intended. Do you use the junkies part of it or is it fine without having to be addicted?
---
If I didnt just get a junkies 25% ffr, I wouldve bought that off of you.
---
Try vending it at 3k. If it doesn’t sell, move it down to 2k, then again at 1k, then scrip. 
---
That’s what I sometimes do with ‘niche but good’ gear.
---
How do you make them really fun I find them to be a pain in the arse. But I do them for the daily.
---
What I want to know is who's the turd who keeps down voting innocuous comments in here
---
I’ve sold the raven mask for 15000 caps after a few hours of playing, idk the price ceiling but I could only take so many caps
---
I always get only 2 random fluxes for ACP.  Not sure if it's fixed at 2 or variable, but I've never gotten more than 2 per run.
---
And a man can only use so many screws!!!
---
34, done all challenges for the week, done today's to. Favorite reward so far is the officer mask.
---
I just want the skin for the handmade, also not purchased any. Been buying lunchboxes and using some buffs not Unyielding though. Getting lots of xp from prime events.
---
Try vending if you have enough stash to support it, and if it doesn't sell in a few days, scrip.
---
Are you ps4? Cause i would trade with you
---
So, let me get this straight, this weapon, named after a European polearm, also bears some resemblance to other polarms, and this is an important issue?
---
It looks to me like someone took a European halberd and made it double-edged, and gave it slightly the wrong name, is all.
---
Ps4. Its an underground bar
---
There can be only one.
---
I would try to sell it if I were you. If you end up wanting to scrip it and are on PS4 I’ll exchange another 3 star script weapon for it
---
Morgantown used to be my favorite Steel and claim ticket farming spot. Now the place kicks my ass unless i go in their with my proper battle gear.
---
This has been happening ever since the game launched, you have to be really careful when you kill the ones you want to loot. When i encounter a legendary one i wait until it is running towards me, so it is not in the middle of burrowing animation.
---
Ah cool. I never pay much attention aside the rare stuff, which again is a very limited time thing.
---
Def sell
---
Pc unfortunately, thanks for the interest though :)
---
The proper response is nuke their base.
---
I usually try selling decent weapons for about a week or so. Every other day I decrease the price, it it's not sold, I scrip it. Unless I already have a shit ton to scrip in my box which is lighter. In that case is drop it to (lower) level players.
---
I haven't even been checking what the dailies are 😩 i am a little too complacent after finishing early last season. My next reward is ship in a bottle, whatever level that is.
---
Absolutely, Ive had no reward twice I think now, and I had repeat rewards 3 times now, with my reward yesterday being non tradable, so basically another no reward day
---
That sounds awesome! Did the VATS accuracy and cost reduction completely negate the two shot accuracy penalty while in VATS? Also, is that the one you can buy in Covenant in FO4?
---
I stuck close to Flatwoods for my first 30 levels or so.  Then I ventured into Whitesprings later on but didn’t even visit the SE portion of the map until lvl 50+
---
35 with some weeklies to go. It seems like the repeatable is happening a lot faster then before, but that’s due to One Wasteland I’m sure.
---
And on top of that AA is the absolute best effect from perk cards.
---
Oh okay, that’s kind of disappointing lol
---
Do you just have to keep it out? Or do you have to kill something with it to get ammo as a reward
---
That's not at all what the original comments were, but fine, time gating is important here too. Since bethesda seems to have joined the community in worshipping cheaters, it's needed so that the entire grind isn't completely trivialized. People had literal millions of treasury notes with the vending dupe, if there was no limit to that then they'd have been able to get every gold recipe in one day on a character the day they finished the WL questline. If there was no scrip limit, all those duped legendaries would be an infinite source of rerolls until you got exactly what you wanted. If there was no cap limit, the billions of duped christmas gifts out there would be even more of an infinite cap source than they already are. 
---
I'm not aware of many other large-scale games like this that don't have time gating. Most big server bosses or raids have long respawn timers or even daily resets. Many games have long IRL crafting times for things like keys to said dungeons or to spawn said bosses. Games like warframe often have daily caps on end-game missions, reputation, etc. You can only infinitely grind the trivial things, the important ones are gated to keep you playing. Doesn't matter if you don't like it, that's how the games are designed and what everything is built around
---
Understood- I'll definitely look out for one at least with the quad.
---
Rank 29, 5 left on the weeklies. I skipped two NW dailies I think (“get a kill” because lol I hide in a bush, and “kill a creature” cause I was too busy that day for NW).
---
I like the power armor paint jobs, using them on my PA alt that I’m levelling up now. The preview pictures for the rank 100 reward are blank for me but from what I’ve seen the final PA isn’t so different which is a bit disappointing. Haven’t had a chance to use the foosball table yet because this stupid primal cut event keeps spawning enemies next to my camp so I’m away as much as possible... 🤦‍♂️
---
I do read the patch notes, but i am not talking about the change to damage from multiplicative to additive, i am talking about the enemy weakspots and the 2x critical, even if the damage was calculated additive the number should be higher.
---
Okay, I'll give the Fixer a shot then once I get the plans for it!
---
Just do Radion Rumble once. The  corpses there always drop 3-4 pre war money each. I usually drop 70 pounds worth of pre way money when I finish looting after the event
---
I am trying to get in the habit of #2, but I'm just not used to switching teams. Before Daily Ops, I would fire up, either join or create a Building/Casual team, and only switch if I found myself alone.
---
So I guess my #4 or #5 would be "have some patience with people not yet doing #2 - it's a new behavior for a lot of us"
---
No purchased levels. At rank 30 this morning.
---
Yesterday I got a really good Radiation Rumble. We were at 3/4 reward rank, seemingly only holding off to let enemies spawn longer, tons of unlooted legendaries on the ground, and then the entire server crashes. No way to jump back in with my team because the team is gone along with everything else. Fuckin RIP
---
It's because of the burrowing. Their corpses can turn up miles from wear you killed them.
---
Robots do though
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4eM5a9X6VmGaV7zz7gYnDy/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-september-2020-updates
---
Well, at the time Concentrated Fire was bugged, so I pretty much always had a 95% hit chance. It didn't fully negate the accuracy penalty, but I could VATS headshot enemies from quite a distance away.
---
And you buy Overseer's Guardian from Vault 84 in FO4.
---
Yeah.
---
Almost not a single cool Military themed item has been in the Atom shop lately.
---
I know the Camo SS PA is cool, but could use more military stuff.
---
I can’t for this op because i’m at work but if you ever need help i’ve been steamrolling them solo.
---
Psn: alphaboomer
---
If you ever see me on and want to run them shoot me a message i’ll be more than happy to join you
---
Sell. Flamers are pretty viable weapons these days and AA has worked its way up the ranks in patch 22.
---
The lights
---
As u/giantpunda said, level doesn’t really matter. But what I would like to see is ‘Featured Item’. Each player can designate one item in their vendor as a Featured Item, and that is viewable form the map. Full info as well as price. 
---
So if someone wants to advertise ‘Stimpak - 9 caps’ they can do so. Or ‘AA/E/RW .50 cal - 20,000 caps’. But bots only on one item or stack, and once it’s sold the player has to designate a new Featured Item.
---
Excellent tip, thanks!
---
I can't deny they are encouraging coop (ops, public teams, ACP) but you can still do almost everything alone if you want to, just needs a little bit of preparation now. In my opinion it was way too easy before one wasteland even playing solo without a 'meta' build. It felt more like a farming simulator with people just farming to increase their farming speed with better gear, an endless loop without real goal and no challenge. 
---
But I digress, maybe take a break and come back after some adjustments were made (they already hinted there will be some changes iirc).
---
I’d do a fetch quest that let me unlock new songs on the radio by searching out records for Julie.
---
The presents will return some caps when you open them.  There's a wide variety of plans and items the presents can contain - I don't have my old list handy, but from what I remember : mounted head plans, weapon plans, armor plans, and aid items.
---
That said, with as many as there are in circulation, it would be unusual to be able to recover your initial cost, and IMHO, not worth trading good armor/weapon for.
---
Looks like they fixed it to where pacifist is working now with the perk.
---
I do 26 :)
---
My poor pistol build character is just a storage unit now.
---
It doesn't have purveyor stuff attached
---
Yeah just for kicks I used regular frags for a bit last night .. they are just not strong enough. Convert to Nuka or MIRV and they work much better.
---
Could I ask for clarification on this? I’m planning on doing it but wanna make sure. (I already bought the camp T-65 skin but don’t have any plans yet as I’m saving up now)
---
1) Buy arm plan and jet pack plan
---
2) jet pack will appear as a mod choice for arms
---
3) craft that mod
---
And that’s it? Would I need to already own the torso piece? And, does the jet pack visually appear on the PA or are you running around without a jetpack while flying through the air? Lol
---
Thanks for any help 🙏
---
Stuff like damage tables are kind of hardcoded last I checked. So a general unoffical patch can't really touch that area. You would need a script extender based bugfix mod (like SSE Engine Fixes for Skyrim) to get at it.
---
Honestly just sort posts by best of whatever time period, scroll past the negative ones and you'll get a decent run down of Wastelanders and other things.
---
You would need to go into a nuke zone and kill the enemies and gather the plants.  The enemies will drop things like the hardened mass or high radiation fluids, and then you can turn all the plants into the flux.
---
It does though.
---
Enemies in nuke zones all have a chance of dropping the resources to craft them, but you also have to gather the raw flux from nuked pants. A Collosal Problem and the Scorchbeast Queen quest also give you random stable flux.
---
Killing glowing enemies and robots in nuke zones. You need hardened mass and radioactive fluids.
---
When I do kill them they don’t drop anything
---
Great! Thanks for the response.
---
I had this happen to me yesterday after the daily op I was had the bravo signal just stop what it was doing and everyone in the daily op was confused and then we all crashed it was really odd
---
Yes it does. look at the schedule.
---
Great advice, thanks! On the diminishing returns, how high can I go before the resistance points are useless? Ironclad+Grounded should give me 150, plus up to 35 when my health gets low for my one bolstering piece. Dodgy sounds really good now that I think about it but sometimes I have to use VATS for my backup weapon (a IE double barrel that kills anything but I didn't want to make my build around it). Does dodgy leave you out of AP often? 
---
Too bad on the Railway recoil though :/ I don't like using VATS for my auto weapons too much but maybe I can get used to it.
---
For sure. Primal cuts is the way to go. My enemies are level 100 and I’ll net something like 3-4XP per event. Totally worth it!
---
got it working, thanks for the advice!
---
Bad RNG, they don’t always drop it, you need to farm a few enemies to start getting the materials.
---
Bruh sell that shit for 10k. It’ll take a minute to find somebody who needs it and doesn’t want discount prices but that’s what it worth.
---
People on here telling you to sell it for 3k are fucking crazy or just rich and wouldn’t need the caps themselves
---
Head over to the market, Reddit or discord
---
I put it 3k like you said, it literally sold in 2 mins to +1000 player... thanks :)
---
Taking one for the team seems to be what I’m missing. Also, there are only two food buffs that affect your attack: damage and strength? I was doing both, stacking multiple chems, all of the damage perks, and a magazine... only got to 200. Not worth it for all of the resources being used.
---
I Guess it is bad ring thanks man
---
Just run them a few times. I hadn't been in the burrows since it was released and after my third time doing it I had 0 issue with finding my way to the objectives
---
AA is multiplicative. On top of that AA is more important now because we can no longer rely on massive damage to overcome armor like pre patch 22.
---
Was it good before?
---
But it's so pretty and comfy
---
I agree since there is always fireproof in endurance to cover explosions and fire damage.
---
Thanks. My junkie commando still destroys everything but I can see AA being awesome now.
---
Gotcha. You might honestly be right because I can't think of any other enemy that uses energy damage.
---
O dear......it just sold for 3k 🤦‍♂️ 
---
I'm completely clueless with weapon prices.
---
O well, live and learn I guess.
---
Thanks for comment though 🙂
---
So that's the answer punish players who don't cheat because of players who do. Look I get ya points but literally I spawn in after reset. Max scrip in under a minute. Max caps in two and gold by 3 mins. I do one daily op and then that's that for the day. That's way to much of a time gate. But each to there own im just sick of having to log in every day to do stuff that I could get out of way now. I've already grinded to get the bullion tickets I shouldn't have to grind to cash them in. 
---
But like I say I get your point too. Just shame the grinds are terribly implemented and the drops rates are ridiculous.
---
Please give more perk card packs bethesda
---
You need resources from nukes flora and fauna (plants and creatures) plants drop specific kinds of raw flux while in nuke zones while creatures drop three resources you need to create the stable flux. Make sure you have green thumb perk and probably the one that lets you kill glowing creatures easier. Maybe also a perk or backpack that reduces spoilage. Then nuke whitespring or another place with a lot of creatures and the kind of flux you want. Kill everything, pick raw flux then go to a chemistry station and craft your stable flux before it spoils
---
What do you need different pa's for? I can see excavator maybe for mining or weight (but I find a backpack to be more beneficial). What's your third for?
---
Maxed Tank killer gives you 36% AA effect. So you do have some in your build most likely. That being said, an AA weapon gives you about the same damage without the addictions.
---
Full health, vats/crit build, no addictions. Weapons of choice are an instigating western and an anti armor western for beefy targets, vampire plasma flamer for the oh shit moments (now more common since one wasteland)
---
Wait, Atom store cosmetics are boring?  
---
👨‍🚀🔫👨‍🚀  
---
Always have been.
---
He may have visited my nuka machine yesterday also.  13 nukas, 2 nukashine.  Enjoy the free ride you greedy hoarder.
---
Isn't it in the same location every time? Just keep doing it and remember the route you take to get there, once you figure it out.
---
Yesterday I had a 3 star radstag disappear on my before I could even run up to it. It sunk into the ground with 4 of its buddies.
---
Good advice for the burning mine run I had the other night where I did my first blind run in 9 minutes. Practice would surely have let me shave a minute off my time.
---
I spent 30 minutes last night just going down every possible path in the Burrows last night and I never found the repeater. That map marker never seemed to get closer. I checked underwater routes. I used the right hand rule. I 'practiced' that map and didn't get any better.
---
Sounds reasonable but I would have to outsource my revenge. I've never launched a nuke and I wouldn't waste my first one on this goober. 😂
---
Now i cant unsee it. I was talking about the frizen not moving and no pan flash on the black powder flint locks in another post. I feel your pain.
---
WELL THAT SABERTOOTH DOESN'T HAVE MY LEGENDARY 1\* SPOON, NOW DOES IT?
---
me too! NY iatse 52 ✌️ Wuddup
---
Understood, thanks! I think I tried using the online weapon calculator for it and it was giving me negative damage for certain higher level enemies, but I can't be sure if that wasn't just an overflow or something. Still, doesn't look promising.
---
Awesome!!
---
they're probably blowing in from maryland, which is why they seem more common in mire and cranbog.
---
I have 56 damage from mine...I got bloodied mess, all pistol perks, and tank killer.
---
If you happen to know, how many shots, out of sneak, does it take to kill a level 100 super mutant with your anti armor western?
---
Is the map marker wrong? I did one burrows run successfully I want to say 2-3 nights ago and I just followed the map marker. No dice last night.
---
hey got it working thanks
---
for using multiple mods, what should that end up looking like?
---
I'm trying to use 3 but not having a lot of luck with:
---
    sResourceArchive2List = PerkLoadoutManager.ba2,﻿sResourceArchive2List = ImprovedHealthBars.ba2,sResourceArchive2List = EventNotifications.ba2
---
Edit: the moment i posted that i realised how stupid it looked.  Using this and its working fine:
---
    sResourceArchive2List = PerkLoadoutManager.ba2,ImprovedHealthBars.ba2,EventNotifications.ba2
---
Yeah I'm on ATM done it 2-3 times solo not quite making elder either, I'll add you in two shakes im just having a smoke outside. Unless you want to add me first and I'll join up when I'm back at it my psn username is demonconfined
---
Oh Nice, me too! I’m abide84, you?
---
Oh-
---
"set them free, at the fissure site"
---
Put Tank Killer on your perk loadout, only way to run pistols now homie
---
Excavator for carry weight, Xo-1 for fighting and ultracite just because it has a jet pack!  Lol
---
Tha k you for the offer, I'll add you and maybe we will ops another day
---
The repeater that you have to repair is the first left and over a wooden walkway I believe. Then the thing you boost is threw the exit from that are to the left.
---
The burrows is the most confusing location by far
---
I’m so heavy all the time dropping legendaries everywhere giving them away just to make weight to fast travel to the next event
---
Sometimes you need to wait a few seconds when looting them to have the mass or fluid appear.
---
Ok thanks
---
That’s what caused the Great War.
---
was gonna  say, I want those four horsemen PA skins on my t-65... or at least some fun t-65 skins
---
Oops, my bad. Looked it up and I was thinking of Justice, the staggering combat shotgun. The headshot part sounds awesome! Must have been sad when it was fixed.
---
Oh no!! )': XP that's so mean. I would be sad too. I would probably just stop running around and look down at the ground in defeat. ;-;
---
It's not wrong, but it can be confusing. I've taken a few wrong turns, even after having run it. Also, there's more than one way to get from A-B in the Burrows.
---
Admittedly, I only run the Ops with players higher than my own level, and I just follow them.
---
💪🏻
---
No need to joke this is my head canon now
---
I recommend posting your build so people can give you advice, I’ve had to solo parts of it due to people taking ages to join, it really shouldn’t take that long. 
---
You can use this site to make it easy to fill out your build-
---

---
22 missed a couple days, haven't played yet today
---
There was one in NY where i grew up called Mountain Men was allot like them.
---
For all the mountain mommas who like to RP
---
One other thing to note is that good with salt rank 1 seems to last longer than the fridge.
---
Thank you for your help (:
---
&gt; your submission
---
Sadly, I'm on Xbox, but I do legit serve up fresh mothman omelettes daily!
---
Ultracite is better than xo-1 I believe, why use xo-1 over ultracite anyways
---
Yeah the markets themselves are crazy active. In general people are always on.
---
How does AA multiply? There’s no dedicated AA perks at different levels like rifleman, expert rifleman and master rifleman, so how does AA benefit from multiplicative calculations?
---
Kindle off topic and maybe stupid but, since Microsoft bought out Bethesda does that mean Sony players are not going to get anymore fallout/elder scrolls games? What about support for Sony users as well? We just kinda got fucked in this lol
---

---
That's the build I use. I don't fully 100% optimize for combat; I keep a few QOL perks in my build. I also don't use any weight management perks, because fast travel is cheap and there are places to store stuff everywhere.
---
It's also worth noting that I use VATS for a crit-focused build. If you're manually shooting, there are a lot of things in my build that won't be useful for you.
---
Some other comments:
---
* **STR**: Blocker is easily the best skill in STR if you're not melee. Ignoring half of all melee damage means getting swarmed by melee mobs is more of an inconvenience than a threat.
---
* **PER**: I keep Green Thumb in because I gather enough that it's not worth trying to remember to swap it. Also - you only need Rank 1 of Concentrated Fire. Don't waste more points on it.
---
* **END**: I have 3 points here for Nuclear Winter, so if you don't play that mode (or have an alt for it) you can sit at 1-2 END easily. Rejuvenated is fantastic for AP regen, so if you use AP for VATS - or just like sprinting/jumping/flying - it's a good pick.
---
* **CHA**: I keep this at 6 for NW. If you solo, Lone Wanderer is a no-brainer pick. Tenderizer is also very strong after the OWL patch, but it's debatable if more than 1 rank is worth it.
---
* **INT**: Auto weapons break fast. Gunsmith 5 helps them break slower. I can't even imagine how bad it would be without this card, because I'll lose half a bar of durability in one Daily Op even with it maxed.
---
* **AGL**: Again - if you don't need AP there are different picks for you here. I'm experimenting with Gun Fu at 3; I may ultimately swap to Adrenaline at 5 instead. (Or both, when I finally get around to spending all of my legendary perks.) Born Survivor at one rank has saved my not-paying-attention-to-my-health-bar ass more times than I can count, so I leave it in my build.
---
* **LUCK**: All of my picks here deal with crit and mutations. Bloody Mess x3 is worth including in every build, because it's a non-situational 15% damage buff. I'll probably add Better Criticals in at some point, to take advantage of the fact I can crit on every third shot.
---
For legendary perks I've only taken Master Infiltrator at 1 rank, and Legendary Agility at 1 rank. I have plenty of coins and open perk slots, but I'm waiting for people to use and review more of the perks to see which ones are winners, and which are losers. 
---
(I consider Master Infiltrator at 1 a must-buy, because even if you never really have to unlock or hack a single thing in this game, I enjoy having the option whenever the urge strikes me. And I fully intend to eventually raise Legendary AGL to 5, but I'm waiting to assign all of my perks before I start spending my coins.)
---
I would proudly display a marble statue. Why you ask? Because he's a HERO FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!
---
Praise him for being a hero FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!
---
Would be nice to have a filter you can apply for vendor hopping. Filter for camps with legendaries or plans
---
Still not bad for barely a week in. The weeklies seem to be easier than last week for me, had them done with about 3 hours of play.
---
- Rush past the mobs. 
---
- Focus on the objectives. 
---
- Only fight when you cannot squeeze past them or your at Alpha, Bravo or in the final fight. 
---
- Use cover as much as possible and focus fire on one enemy at a time to take them out. 
---
It can be soloed and you can get Elder. It’s just going to be challenging. 
---
Can you complete it solo, regardless of finishing time?
---
Agree id love something like this but people will complain about the grind. Etc not that you had grind to get the weapon you want .and the major prefix maybe if the second and third we're re-rollable .
---
How's your build and gear? I've had 0 issue finishing elder solo. I wish they'd turn up the difficulty.
---
Also just server hope until you find a team. It's not hard to find at least 1 other person to do it with
---
Edit, it's not really suppose to be done solo. And definitely not at level 50. It is end game content geared for groups
---
Yes the new damage system/scaling stuff is pretty annoying for low lvl's, but as many Problems  76 has its, its biggest strength is its community! There are plenty of high Level Players around who have struggled themselves  (me included) and love to help out. 
---
Try to connect to people. On reddit. On discord. Ingame. Or maybe go to some 76 youtubers and ask for help in the comments section. I see a lot help full players there aswell on all 3 platforms! 
---
I'd love to help myself, but as stalker474 has pointed out, we are on PC :/
---
Good Luck in your journeys!
---
Best camp I’ve ever seen.
---
Just want to say that I appreciate everyones advice/suggestions. It has been helpful. Blocker 3 has helped immensely. I have liked playing as a rifleman/shotgunner but I will also start to add the commando perks as I can and try switching between those and my rifleman perks and seeing which I like best.
---
S 12 +2 (legendary strength perk)  Strength Perks: Blocker 3, Scattershot 3, Shotgunner 3, Expert Shotgunner 3, Sturdy Frame 2
---
P 15 Perception Perks: Concentrated Fire 1, Rifleman 3, Expert Rifleman 3, Master Rifleman 3, Skeetshooter 2, Tank Killer 3
---
A 8  Agility Perks: Action Boy 3, Covert Operative 3, Escape Artist 1, Gun Fu 1 (The next level up I will move 1 pt from Endurance (6) to increase Agility (9) at which point I will add Adrenaline 1)
---
L 8  Luck Perks: Class Freak 3, Starched Genes 2 (Also have Bloody Mess 2, Better Criticals 1, Critical Savvy 2, Four Leaf Clover 1, Grim Reaper's Sprint 1, Serendipity 3) Running Serendipity 3 or Bloody Mess 2, Grim Reaper's Sprint 1 and switching out. Is it worth it to rank up Grim Reaper's sprint further? 
---
Weapons: Not having luck with RNG legendary drops or at the Rusty Pick vendor keep getting mediocre pistols and heavy guns so no changes here. Will keep checking player vendors.
---
I have gotten some decent mileage out of the Hunting Rifle in my original post but it just isnt cutting it in comparison to my Gauss rifle these days. Between that and my AA Handmade, I have decided to retire it and sell it for scrip. I understand the Gauss Rifle I am running is decent, however what legendary versions would be better for my build?
---
I'm also on the lookout for an Instigating Lever Action of some type but I understand they are rare and expensive if you are lucky enough to find one in a vendor.
---
I've heard elsewhere that a modded out Vampire Combat Shotgun would be of benefit. Thoughts?
---
Armor: I now have Buttressed Secret Service Chest, all the other pieces are still BOS Heavy Combat Armor.  I have the Stabilized mod on the Arms. I have tried a few now and can't decide on which mod I should use on the Legs,  Deep Pocketed? Strengthened? Ultralight?
---
Torso ☆☆☆ Hunter's, +1 Agility, Reduce dmg while blocking by 15%
---
Right Arm ☆☆☆ Zealot's, +1 Strength, Junk Weight reduced by 20%
---
Left Leg ☆☆☆ Exterminator's, +25 Poison Resistance, Reduce falling dmg by 50%.
---
Right Leg ☆☆☆ Mutant Slayer's, +1 Perception,   Reduce limb dmg by 15%
---
Just keep it equipped
---
The Daily Ops purpose is to be a challenging event meant for a squad of players. It's supposed to be hard, and especially for a solo player. At Level 50? You're getting the experience you should have expected to get.
---
sResourceArchive2List just gets listed once, and you separate the mod file names themselves with commas. So yours should look like this:
---
    sResourceArchive2List = PerkLoadoutManager.ba2, ImprovedHealthBars.ba2, EventNotifications.ba2
---
That would be cool I guess, but that seems like it would be a waste of time to add when the game itself still has massive issues that need to be fixed for it to be playable
---
any reason you are doing it solo? and dont say just because you could. there are events that can be started solo and be very difficult to complete solo (radiation rumble, project paradise)
---
join a public group or start your own and get some help.
---
Bryangolley. You online now?
---
Just take some Halo/Destiny modifiers:
---
* Blackout: Radar disabled. Enemy melee kills instantly.  
---
* Grenadier: Enemies throw grenades much more frequently. Every enemy drops grenades.
---
* Energy Burn: Energy weapon damage greatly increased, ballistic damage greatly decreased.
---
* Ballistic Burn: Ballistic weapon damage greatly increased, energy damage greatly decreased.
---
* Radiation Hazard: Background radiation is greatly increased.
---
* Swarm: Enemies are slightly weaker but spawn in much greater numbers.
---
* Shock Troops: Enemy spawns are reduced but enemies are significantly tougher.
---
**Edit:** Also, I'd love Nightfall mode:
---
* Nightfall: Players cannot respawn and can only be revived by team mates. If the entire team dies, the Daily Op fails.
---
 You just missed the boat I am afriad, be happy to run it again though
---
AA is an enemy debuf, so When it increases damage by reducing effective armor it increases all damage from all perks, legendary effects, mutations etc. something like junkies is an additive dmg bonus  it only increases damage of the base weapon and not the bonus damage from any other perk, effect or mutation.
---
Check wiki again
---
The problem with items you can craft, is anyone can craft them. I spend the most on drugs that can't be crafted and bobbleheads. Ammo at 1 for normal 2 for Ultracite is something I spend on even if I don't need it. Dog food is great as well.
---
I realised that the moment i hit post on my comment!
---
Thanks for being understanding with my stupid self!
---
Xbox didn’t do it with obsidian, they tend to make more money through things they purchase so it would be stupid to not keep things non exclusive
---
Lol that would work
---
Radscorpions are meaner in wastelanders :/
---
"I need about 200 more levels for my build" so what build are you going for that requires most of the games perk cards?
---
sell 3 star legendary items only for real cheap. you wont have problems getting rid f them unless you set up camp in a stupid far away corner of the map.
---
That’s a good point
---
Thanks. I will give this a go next time the burrows come up.
---
Everything you mentioned sells well in my vendors, especially the rarer outfits. Other things that go pretty quickly are treasure maps and mods.
---
They actually make quite a bit of money off of PlayStation which is funny
---
Right when I don't have to level up in Nw that one goes faster
---
What's the stat boost for this issue?
---
A Master Chief skin for my power armor
---
Omg lol yeah that’s so annoying!
---
Yeah if you're keen I am
---
Would be cool.
---
Yeah. It was confusing I remember that. 
---
They really need to do something with that local
---
Thats a fair statement. However not everyone likes to craft. Might be a smaller percentage but i still like to know if people want it. Im not looking to make caps, just something to do. Which drugs cant be crafted? Are you suggesting to sell magazines along with bobbleheads? How much would be a good deal on dog food? 3 caps?
---
I can do it solo in 8mins 4seconds just run past everything til you have to defend something and keep an eye on your health. Lots of stims and lots of bullets. 
---
Can't deny though I'm bummed I haven't got under 8mins yet but just got myself a junkie 33%vats ffr 50cal so I'm hoping that will help cut that last 4 seconds.
---
Also still haven't got a single rare plan and ran 30+ times now off work for a couple of days so knocking them out until I get one lol
---
Always need more fusion cells
---
Serums would be a good start. Maybe some bulk scrap like lead, copper, or ballistic fiber?
---
It would be nice to see more useful craftable items. So people who don't like crafting as much wouldn't have to and could just fork over the money to other players rather than the Npcs.
---
Edit - spelling
---
Lol I know it’s a annoying glitch.
---
I'd be good with that. I hope it is too cuz I'm not using atoms for it haha
---
I will try to find a compliant test subject later, still at work atm :-)
---
It was in the Beta but not the final game.
---
Not betting against that!
---
...then pick the legless ones up and throw 'em around like hay bales.
---
Ive heard about it. It sounded really cool and like the only pvp I'd be interested in
---
Ontario DGC and ACtra, it’s nice to be working again
---
Wouldn’t that be fixable through any of their patches that required us to download new content onto our device? Or is it deeper than that?
---
I did eventually get through it, I wasn't going to quit after so much time put into it, it just wasn't a fun time. I did rush for the most part, however it became an issue once I got to the point where I actually had to kill enemies and then the boss.
---
You realize you only have 1 chance a day to get rare rewards right? (1 chance per tier)
---
Maybe the slider would affect most if the mobs and bosses, and be chosen by level. And higher the level higher the rewards
---
And glowing mass too I believe. Also harvest nuked flora the glowing plants in the nuke zone.
---
Scrap 100 pre-war money is one of the weeklies
---
Shotgun Shells, 50cal rounds, plans ( not the mounted ones ) , junk
---
Of course within 15 minutes of posting this I turned in a couple to get the pre-war money and got the Shotgun.  There's a revolver also?
---
If you wanna consider the LMG finished, then sure
---
Yeah, never got it to work though
---
It's been a while since I saw something that was new to the shop that I actually liked. Actually... I can't even recall one example of this, but I'm sure it exists? Lol 
---
Everything I've bought lately has just been recycled content that I wasn't around for the first time. I'm glad to have it though. No complaints here about bringing items back.
---
Nuking Whitespring isn't that good of a resource for flux. Great for xp and legendaries. If you want flux hit a area with the flux you are after (see [maps](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmwpx9/mappalachia_my_project_which_can_automatically/) here). As for the fluids/mass make sure you hit a work shop, and claim it. Those waves all have the goods. Or you can look around for a node turned Ultracite and pick it creating a good amount of scorched for the goods. This can be done over and over despite not being able to pick up any more Ultracite, just tap on the node.
---
Im lv 158 and i need lv 300 for the last legendary perk slot. Not to mention ive switched builds a lot. So i dont have as many perk cards to scrap for rank ups. 200 lvls is an optimistic statement.
---
I had my camp at whitesprings station with 3 stars for 150 and they were in there for over a week.
---
PA or no PA?
---
I think ultimately the real problem is lack of ammo for lower levels. We need more As a higher level, I usually get a lot of ammo back fr regular runs in ACP and Daily Ops, but you don't really run those when leveling from 1 to 50.
---
If we could just have contextual ammo drops all the time, I think that would help a great deal. It's awful spending 10-12 shots of .45 from your combat rifle to kill molerats, and then loot 2 shotgun shells.
---
I use the xo1 for the higher Energy and rad resistance.
---
yeah!
---
The specs are kinda "hrm dont think I'll use that" but it would look interesting on the wall I think
---
My build is not much of anything honestly and is probably spread too thin. After looking at all the build questions, I'm guessing I should take a look at what I have instead just using what I like. That being said, getting elder is absolutely mind blowing to me.
---
Also, perhaps I don't understand the levelling system? I'm not expert on the game by any means, but I thought that getting to 50 pretty much stopped any sort of power increases and it was just basically getting more perk cards from that point on. Does being much higher than 50 really make that much of a difference?
---
Lol, the worst is when I think I'm hot shit, booking it to the next waypoint right after completing the first objective. The team follows me because they think I actually know what I'm doing but I lead them to a dead end and get us all lost.
---
Let's just say my 'Sorry' emote is getting plenty of use these days.
---
Are you sure the alien blaster rounds drop in the daily ops?
---
WOW!, 540? That's 55lb of weight. I thought I had a lot at \~180, at that point I began to save some in my stash and then started to dump them.
---
Make sure and start drumming the minute the even starts, during the "wait for event to begin" countdown.  Those contributions pile up, and will credit to the event when it starts.  Did one last night with three people drumming, and the completion bar came in at nearly 75%.
---
What are some good prices for those things? Do you mind? Im pretty new at selling. Or a video on trading you could suggest. 
---
What mods sell? PA mods?
---
In my experience, I level much faster last season than this one. Probably because there were more challenges.
---
Had an imposter sheep that got exploded 20 ft away, took us 20 mins to figure where it went
---
Yes. I just farmed 900+ rounds. I got 188 on completion as part of the rewards and the rest from the enemies I was looting.
---
That's interesting, I'll definitely keep this in mind when trying to grind ammo
---
Cycling through some of the old videos would be nice. I miss some of them like the Nuclear Winter one.
---
What build are you running? Because getting Elder while solo is very do-able...just extremely hard. I usually just barely finish, in the last 15-20 seconds before 8 minutes is up. One time I finished at 8:01. That...sucked. Hard. But yeah. You *can* do it.
---
Rank 1 perks was the old meta.
---
Now 9pts is pretty mandatory for everything but the lesser nerfed builds aka not commando or heavy weapons
---
I'll buy dog food all the way up to 50 caps a pop. Granted I may have more of a disposable income than some players, but 3 caps is way to low. And yes magazines are my favorite I forgot to mention that. As for drugs that can't be crafted, phycotats, x-cell, and a few others I can't think of (no coffee yet)
---
Uh what fallout have you been playing? It's always been comical.
---
Wtf is Naughty Nightwear or K9 gun?
---
After level 53 or so you should have been able to get every perk card needed for your build (if you were very careful with your perk selection). So no it doesn't really mean much.
---
But it does mean you've had more time to dial your build. And more importantly get better gear
---
Without a good build and gear you are going to struggle in combat.
---
They're reintroducing old stuff so you'll be out of atoms when BOS drops and have to buy more.
---
We hold this to be universally true
---
&gt; A temporary highlight around the corpse
---
I want to add it needs to be a strong highlight as well as be marked on the compass or something of the sort ala BL3, something that would stand out in any situation, Even if it turned into green goo, ashes or exploded into pieces.
---
* Damage perks are less important now. You can get away with ranks I/II/II (base/expert/master) instead of III/III/III.
---
* For Commando, Tenderizer is good because it's still applied multiplicatively and not additively.
---
* Stealth is key. Sneak III, Covert Operative III, and high AGI are highly recommend.
---
* You want Unyielding armor.
---
* Nerd Rage and Serendipity are a must.
---
* Adrenaline V is worth the investment.
---
* Don't waste points on carry weight perks.
---
* Concentrated Fire I is sufficient.
---
Personally I like the vagueness of some events, it makes it feel a bit more like a free form puzzle
---
Rare outfits and plans
---
Ran every day since they came out:
---
(2) V94 jumpsuits
---
(3) cage lights 
---
(2) valley galleria signs 
---
(2) burrows signs
---
(1) super reactor 
---
I just recently realized they weren't account wide rewards and that I could run them more than once a day by using my other toons.
---
You can just buy an arm plan and the jetpack plan. You do not have to have purchased the torso yet. The jetpack appears in its correct spot, on the back. I have it on a PA frame with an Ultracite torso and a T-65 camo arm. The jetpack is camo colored (slightly) to match the camo paint from the arm. It shows a jetpack flying as normal.
---
Upvote for fucking propellers.
---
This.  Really insulting getting 12 x nukashine or a few radaways.  Sure I get there needs to be filler.  But at least drop something useful.
---
No PA, on an unrelated note happy cake day!
---
I tried it once during Beta and then never touched it again.  By the time I felt I had good PVP gear it had already been removed, and by then I really lost any interest in PVP in this game anyways.
---
Yes, but not in the way you are thinking. Most of my characters dont come into their own until mid to late 70s. This is to finish ranking up the right perk cards and what not, finding better weapons and armor. Use nukadragons character planner to help you out.
---
Food buffs are weird in that they won't stack if they give you a SPECIAL boost (e.g. only one +STR buff at a time), but ALL +melee damage stacks together. Taking the plunge and becoming a "food build" is the number one most important thing you need as melee.
---
Glowing Meat Steak normally gives you +10% melee damage, but with Carnivore, it's +20%, and with Strange in Numbers, it's +25%. It stacks with Mutant Hound Chops, Yao Guai Ribs, and Mutton Chops, with are also +25%. So that's +100% right there, more than if you stack all 9 weapon damage perks, Bloody Mess and Tenderizer. These are really easy to keep in stock, because it only takes one meat item and wood scrap to cook. With Super Duper you make tons.
---
The other buffs give +37.5% melee damage, but require pepper and some basic stuff like boiled water/mutfruit/carrots/starlight berries to craft. These are Mutant Hound Stew, Yao Guai Roast and Mutton Meat Pie. It's super easy to keep yourself in mutant hound, glowing and yao guai meat, but for the sheepsquatch stuff you need to do Free Range whenever it pops. So now we're up to +212.5% damage without any perks or magazines or chems. Just food.
---
So if you're a melee build, you NEED to also be a meat cook, otherwise you hit like a nerf bat. It takes a tiny bit of grinding to keep yourself in all of the ingredients, but honestly, it's easier than worrying about ammo.
---
I will forsure think about it tonight when im home... maybe a couple hundred lead and steel
---
Wouldnt be so bad lol
---
I kill them without weapon it's faster but I got a legendary perk that make even that explosive....
---
It was always underwhelming tbh
---
Bethesda: "No, I don't think I will."
---
Daily Ops are meant to be played as a team event....this is why it says in the  bottom of the event when bringing it up ... "Join Team." Of course it can be done solo but its more efficient to be done in a squad. XP bonus for squad is pretty good too. Even high level players shouldnt scoff at the XP now that its needed to rank up cards and such for legendary upgrading.
---
It’s used for buried with honor daily and is a great place to get wood scraps, actually an amazing place for wood scraps (Especially if you’re still trying to finish the gather wood challenge)
---
Okay so you’ll want to get unyielding armor or bolstering armor and then perks like serendipity and nerd rage for damage negation and radicool for that sweet sweet carry weight lol. Thank you!
---
I didnt know that about damage perks now; will they still offer the same value? 
---
Thanks you this is a def screenshot!
---
I see you too are a fellow BETA OG.
---
Microsoft bought Obsidian too late to make changes to TOW.
---
Nuka cola ! I'm desperate for the stuff !
---
They should make the propellers do contact limb damage. Choppin arms and heads off and stuff. It'll be like when they had the helicopter at the local fair here IRL appalachia.
---
Macro
---
Well yeah but that all depends on if Bethesda could actually bother to fix it. Like I stated earlier this bug has existed since Fo4's launch, carried over to 76 and has never been fixed.
---
What I look for the most:
---
* 5.56 ammo (or bulk lead, acid, and cloth)
---
* Stable fluxes, primarily cobalt
---
* Rare/uncommon outfits like Hunter's Long Coat, Tattered Field Jacket, and Traveling Leather Coat. (I'd pay 10k for the field jacket without batting an eye if I ever found one in a machine.)
---
* RadShield
---
* Bobbleheads
---
* Nuclear keycards
---
Huh. I... guess I’ll let my melee friend carry my gunslinger through and farm up a bunch.
---
I had another person check with Earle and was told they didn’t drop. Thank you for the correction!
---
Yeah but what a waste for such a meh quest. 
---
I prefer putting on woodchucker and hitting up Hevetia fir wood myself.
---
It’s a big location for so little as it currently stands
---
This.  I’m mostly looking for rare plans and outfits
---
The C.A.M.P unit itself cannot be destroyed. Only the structures, workbenches, etc.
---
I don't think so.  At the very worst it's just temporarily broken like everything else in your camp.
---
I've been buying any presents I see lately just to have them in case I'm vendor hopping later and am a few caps short on buying something I would hate to miss.
---
Otherwise, no, you won't get anything cool (people sell the plans so cheap or drop them because the market is saturated).
---
Auto laser rifle with bloodied or junkies and the splitter mod is pretty good but it eats fusion cells, the mag is too small, and it breaks way too quick. It might not be a god their weapon, but it makes for a pretty good poor mans weapon.
---
You probably don't think you can heal people by shooting them either
---
Happened to me yesterday at the ash heap primal cuts
---
Noted, only upset about it since they were 90+ should have been nice loot lol
---
Idk I’m ok with everything not literally being spoon fed through that area. 
---
People don’t wanna learn the gameplay and pay attention while running around with adult adhd or relying on others to pay attention to what the game is already telling us / is readily codified on the internet and the cost of that is failing events.
---
There has to be some self sufficiency or this all becomes a boring rail shooter
---
I prefer the recent content over the silly stuff and repetitive power armor skins they had in there previously, but the bugged stuff needs to stop.
---
Stable Flux is my most desired item, of all types, since that would save me time and ammo.
---
The alcoholic beverages that provide buffs are also something I’ll buy (Like Ballistic Bock) but I might be a niche market. 
---
I also pick up bobbleheads and magazines, so if you come across those while gathering other supplies, its something you can throw out there
---
Waits its tradable/sellable ?
---
I guess I underestimated just how much of a difference my build was going to make overall, so I guess I should put some time into making sure my character is on the right path so I don't put myself into this sort of situation again.
---
Yes I would love this! Also, I just got Fallout 1st and I swear I have seen Survival Camps that are personalized (Christmas lights, a bench) but I can't figure out how to do it and I saw something that says you can't personalize them. Any help on this?
---
So I was testing both my AAE 10mm and my BE 10mm and still found the bloodied rocked in comparison. Im no data miner but it was very obvious what was better.
---
As a new player that’s what I learned. I never really use chems so I have a shit Ton of them that I just sell for next to nothing, I have no clue if people actually buy them but for 15 or less caps each they are all there.
---
Thank you, I will check out the perk builder and actually put something together so I don't do this to myself again.
---
Yeah laser splitters and two shot weapons trigger the same magic effects that the shotguns do!
---
The regular .44 should be double action and have a faster firing rate and reload time.
---
Single action and western should both be single action revolvers with slower firing and reload time.
---
The western should have the worst accuracy due the the type of sights.
---
The single action should be the most accurate of the 3 due to fewer parts. 
---
They should all do the same damage if they're all chambered for .44 magnum.
---
And the comment you were replying to was about how previous to this most things were one shot.
---
It isn't a question if ease it is a question of resource consumption.
---
It most certainly was on final game, but got removed fairly early on. I wasn't on beta (started on the day of the launch) and i remember doing the event couple of times before they removed it. Never worked like it was supposed to but still.
---
Agree with this 100%. I'm asking myself like do people not like the fallout aesthetic and themes? Past games were hardcore, now it's overshadowed by disneyland costumes and family friendly events. It's not just the atomic shop, can anyone really see something like Meat Week or Fasnacht taking place in Fallout 3, NV or even 4?
---
Yeah. Bloodied is still top of the totem pole.
---
And a lower chance to get duplicates, I have extra vault 94 stash, and burrows signs gave away my two sets of caged light bulbs..I just want the special ops stuff and warglaive :(
---
Friendly fire does work on the robots. People would get freaked out when I started flailing with the shishkebab until they saw the health bar increasing. They probably thought I was trying to sabotage the event.
---
They will get it from Starfield, ESO, and TES VI.
---
The Virtual Barbie Fashion Shop has always been underwhelming.  I think the only thing I've actually liked was the grave stone because it's more visible than the paper baggy.  If they made a flashing disco ball loot bag, I'd be all over that.  8k atoms, do it!
---
Once you have your idea legendary setup:
---
1) Aligned Flamer Barrel
---
2) Pulse capacitor
---
*this will make it ranged automatic, with 200 ammo magazine, while using rifleman perks*
---
- Forceful stock
---
- Reflex sight
---
Chainsaw to the knees could solve that problem
---
"recently" lmao.
---
“Listening is the key to life. Gotta focus.”
---
Yeah your build is very important. Pick 1 weapon type and stick with it. Using more than 1 type is inefficient. Unless you have the legendary perks to bring your special up to make the difference, and even then I'd recommend staying with the 1 weapon type and making it even more efficient
---
Those special tents were only available for a limited time. Ive seen Christmas and I think a Responder's theme. They were probably released as free monthly rewards? I'm not sure though, that is before my time. I've only been subscribing going on 3 months so haven't had any different tents available.
---
I lose legendary bugs all the time because they blast apart with bloody mess and good luck finding tiny body parts in the tall grass.
---
This is lies.  it dropped 101 for me.
---
With scorched up to level 100 the XP wasn't bad either.
---
Agreed
---
thanks a lot :)
---
Ah yes it works with the Shishkebab, but this dude said it worked with the drill as well. Found out the hard way that was not the case and it cost me a Fasnacht.
---
Welcome. I think it might have the largest interior of the premades. I love them. It makes pick up and go camps really easy and convenient.
---
It’s meh, but I do it whenever I can because it’s an easy 3 scrip. 
---
It is a big location, and since the robots are passive, I think it could be made into a good location for some settlers in the future.  The settlers could all dress up in Union outfits, and the robots could be reprogrammed to treat all raiders as confederate soldiers.  The event could be reworked into a PVE event where you have to help fend off waves of Raiders.
---
Hey, could you sell plans for the vertibird pa skin?
---
Oh damn that still works? You think this would go well with the slug buster from wastelanders?
---
It appears so in some events, during Primal cuts I can't sneak at all.
---
Also don't know if you guys have experienced this, but I'm not getting notifications for sneak attacks or follow through, and the damage numbers display normal damage.
---
EDIT: Talking about solo play, I'm aware of the implications for stealth while in a group.
---
More likely to see time delays or exclusive cosmetics than not seeing the game at all.
---
How did you get an extractor at your camp? Is it an exploit it am I missing something? I looked through all of the camp building categories and didn't see them anywhere.
---
Yup, had it fail because the quest giver wouldn't stop attacking a turret so it was impossible to start the event.
---
I just want 150 of your Mr. Fuzzy tokens.
---
It's only good if you:
---
1) don't run speed demon
---
2) don't run ground pounder
---
3) don't run quick hands
---
4) doesn't have +15% faster reload
---
5) don't run quick magazine
---
6) a combination of the above.
---
Otherwise it is dogshit
---
There rewards are extremely underwhelming
---
what we really need is one that looks like a vampires slumber crypt, sleeping slab in the middle, small "blood box" stash, junk box outside with a "cauldron" cooking pot
---
I havnt seen a single auto complete complaint this season
---
Beckett seems to have a real hate on for merchants.
---
Should also be mentioned power user extends the life of cores in Gatling lasers as well as pa. Making primed even easier
---
Best reason to nuke Earle now a days is to farm the wendigos he spawns for exp. It's better than Queen's ads since those only spawn when she lands and people tend to kill the Queen way too quickly so she barely gets to spawn anything in.
---
My CAMP is made of of three prefab cabins, one fore selling stuff, one as a guest cabin and the other my personal cabin.  So the first time I walk into my personal cabin and find someone sleeping in my bed I felt like one of the Three Bears.  In this case I just pulled out my TSE Gatling Gun and fired his ass up!
---
I would agree with you pre patch. As a rifleman I was a crit fixer and i33 dragon user, used to one shot everything, even legendary sb. The furious fixer was pretty good too for queen. With the vigorous mod you could get 2000 damage a clip relatively fast on her and you didn't have half ass stealth like unyielding users.  This patch though, xp actually means something now. But the great thing is you can dual heavy and rifle with the perks.
---
Dps used to be a joke really. When you one shot everything dead, who cares if you overkill. It was really only the queen it mattered. The railway is pretty good right now. The fixer and handmade are mule items unfortunately, and I did try to get them to snuff. It's not happening. The lever at least can one hit if you max adren and chems/bock help too. The railway can one hit things outside of stealth though. Heavy explosive is where it's at for dps.
---
It definitely doesn't.  I mean, I looked for half a second, but I would have seen it.    /s
---
They should pull a diablo style map legendary marker to solve it 🤔
---
It's a plasma rifle, so yeah.
---
Just build the mods in that order
---
Oh i see, so it works like this I guess:
---
If a weapon’s base damage is 100, with 9 weapon buffs it becomes 100*(1+0.2*3) = 160,
---
With Bloody Mess it’s 160 + 15 = 175
---
If enemy’s armor is ‘negate 40% incoming damage’, the real damage becomes 175*0.6=105
---
For AA since the negation is cut in half, the damage becomes 175*0.8=140
---
For Junkies the weapon gets 50% buff so the damage becomes 175+50=225
---
Then since the enemy has 40% negation, the real damage becomes 225*0.6=135.
---
Of course the numbers differ from creature to creature, on some creatures Junkies might be slightly higher.
---
It literally pops up in the top left corner of the load screen like most other events. Sometimes if you load too fast you can miss it, but I've been able to read them most times.
---
Not seeing it at all.  Check your network connection.
---
Remember trying it few times early on after launch, before they removed it. But never got it to work, and never understood what you were supposed to do. But it was a fun idea for an event. They should have just fixed it.
---
Awesome idea... but more than that what we need is a tent with actual workbenches or vendor spawns.
---
My tent hasn't moved in months.  No matter how cool of an appearance they give it... it needs more utility lol.
---
I'd totally buy a holiday bundle of different tent skins for the different seasons though.
---
its in resources tab. if you have some resources deposits on the territory - you can build extractors on it. Espacially on this exact spot i have 2 deposits - 1 lead and 1 junk, so i have 2 extractors and plus BOS collectron.
---
Exactly. All hypothetical number but the way things are added and multiplied is right.
---
Reminder:  Higher levels cost more S.C.O.R.E., but the same amount of atoms as lower levels, so you are better off saving your atoms for the end of the season..
---
Adventure mode is the only mode really. People can't destroy your camp unless they drop a nuke on it. The community is extremely helpful and giving towards new players. I highly recommend the game
---
Wrong I don't do it because after the event I'm stuck with that stupid head until I log off the server
---
only reason bloodworms never made it to 76 was because of how they ragdoll when they jump out at you
---
Agreed!
---
I stayed logged in on Saturday (didn’t want to lose my workshops) and had no autocomplete, not a lot of complaints about it, just a couple. 
---
I did log off myself though, not because of autocomplete but my poor PS4 sounds like it needs a rest being on with me AFK all day
---
Great observation, great idea.
---
You're implying 9 points is necessary for heavy gunner?  Cause it definitely isn't.
---
I wouldn't call it a tradeoff, especially when 90% weapon reduction exists.
---
lol
---
Medx, day tripper, and calmx cannot be crafted. I use to sell them for 10 to 20 caps. If you have the recipe for formula P it was selling out fast. I started at 20 caps and raised the price up to 50 and still couldn't keep them stocked. Berry mentats will sell around double xp events. Just a few idea's on chems.
---
Yep, I got 101 also
---
Yah, just seems like a minor inconvenience to actually fix. Was hoping to understand if there was an actual reason this couldn’t be solved in an afternoon before the next patch or if rebalancing weapons that already worked was more important to them than fixing the ones that don’t
---
Confederate soldiers are massing in the parking lot?
---
Speaking of which i feel like no one is doing him anymore, all nukes are back to be solely on the SBQ.
---
🤦🏻 No I did not know that and I always hit the middle tier too s@%*. So I have to actually do it slower in order to have a second chance and prey I find a team that can finish the final tier for a third chance. Long!
---
Thank you I think you just saved me a few hrs of annoyance lol
---
Imo the biggest difference might be the switch from max bloodied to max tenderizer, or both maxed out.
---
vats or no vats?
---
How do you change your Team from Op to Casual or events, etc?
---
Thanks for the reply, so Adventure mode is populated? Will we see other players in the world? and sure, i understand if someone nukes our base. I am guessing thats just part of the game.
---
Also can you do everything in Adventure mode?  
---
Another question, joining so late to the game i am guessing all the best places for a camp/base will be taken?
---
Yea since AA has zero downsides so it’s naturally a good choice, they need to buff Junkies to balance the risk/reward.
---
You got a 1\* spoon?!? Lucky bastard!
---
I just did it last night with my friends.
---
You can definitely duo the whole story and it’s when this game is most fun. Take your time with it and enjoy the game. There’s basically no griefing since you can activate pacifist mode so no one can kill you. The only time you activate pvp is when you decide to take over a public workshop.
---
For every 1 instance of this, I've had 10 that weren't that great
---
No vats
---
They're probably also waiting for a buff.
---
Angry turtle is a great YouTube resource. His videos change the course of the market.
---
this is all right - but stealth is just an option.   
---
[i run around ](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f435ae&amp;d=pp2p00a04l71lu2ii0s01pg2ph2pi2eh2cr0ce0ir2la2sg2s72cu2xb0x00xp0ik0c62x43x53lg2po1am2lk2a30a72eu0&amp;w=a12ic4if2c52iq2at1ij2lm2c20lt2&amp;m=051c29fe87b3&amp;am=1827-1827-1827-1827-1827&amp;wp=w6w6w1&amp;wm=1429-1g2435-142238&amp;n=Donald) with a Q5025 railway rifle and dont care about stealth, i want the enemies comin to me. key are the crits. with full unyielding/ap refresh armor, 14 baseluck and critical savvy, every second hit is a crit and when aiming for the head, almost everything falls with the second hit. sometimes you go down like today when 4 100 yao gais spawned right next to me at a primal cut event but thats ok. my alt weapon is a 2* b33 handmade which works perfect also but the railway is way more fun.
---
This is the correct answer. Using a ultracite Gatling laser with no prime gives you no cores. 
---
Once you prime the laser, you will begin receiving ultracite cores. Got 2 full cores from a daily op yesterday. As previously stated regular lasers will give you regular cores
---
If you finish with elder it rolls each lower tier at the same time, so you can possibly get 3 rare rewards at once. So no you do not have to do it slower
---
Depends on server.  I've had 4 and I've had 20.
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
no such thing as griefing tbh
---
if you dont meet a high level player dropping you guns armor and ammo just change server
---
best community (minus a few trade scamming 14 year olds) on earth.
---
PM me your wisdom o jedi ammo master. Lol
---
I did look it up, the first thing I noticed is it's 'locomotive' :D
---
Where do you get so much lead. Seems every time I look someone else has beat me there.
---
I definitely agree with needing a workbench. I have used the cooking station approximately 0 times but the number of times I've needed quick access to a workbench to scrap is probably in the thousands 😅
---
It is a trade-off. 90 percent weapon reduction I only a thing if you get lucky and it's one of your legendary effects on the roll you get. You can not expect to be doing as much damage as the bigger and better guns when using a pistol. Its not gonna happen, for reasons that seem pretty obvious. If you don't like it, don't use a pistol. That's all I can really tell ya.
---
I had never done it before until recently, and I didn't realize it was PvP. I was instructed to attack the other player, and when I did, I was so shocked they took damage that I stopped attacking him. They seemed to understand, and I just followed them around helping kill ghouls, and when it was my turn, they did the same.
---
But yeah, as a result, I probably won't play the event again.
---
Look at the Roadmap image. It has the Purveyor sale in the bottom right. 
---
I really promise it’s there.
---
Gratz on the Nuke!

---
Oh, I was being sarcastic.
---
Na, i said not commando and heavy.
---
Rifle/pistol/melee need it and they still lag behind
---
There can be a max of 24 people per server. Camp spots are plenty don't worry about it, if your spots taken just change servers. There will be others players in world, but contact with them is normally pretty limited. It is a very big map an dost people od their own thing
---
Every thing is done on adventure. The only other mode is nuclear winter which is a battle royal mode that is only loosely connected to the main game
---
None of those. He's a combat medic, Lotta str and cha, was using a mole miner gauntlet and no buffs. It started right after the new patch. Its the same animation as my melee who has exploding palm.
---
If we this was a joke, the punchline would be “250” atoms.
---
Dammit, I can never tell with you.
---
*Now* you’ve added the /s, ya bastich, lol.
---
Oh, okay.
---
Just hit them a couple of times theyll still fight you, just like at whitespring.
---
that's what she said
---
Oh no.
---
Over the internet it's hard as well.
---
Also, don't shoot Mr Prize Bot immediately - oftentimes he rewards 100 Pre-War money as well.
---
Different animation, more like exploding palm,  and it was happening outside of ops
---
You need better weapons.
---
YES, this is another good tip.
---
So very hard.
---
There are multiple locations with those little bastards, one doesn't have to worry about doing that event.
---
I somehow managed to level up three times the only weeklys lefy are collecting 50 planta and repairing 15 things. 
---
Played a llitle less than 3 hours
---
You'll always have AWOL armaments, or just graze a handy at Whitespring. You're right about Watoga, they don't even fight back now.
---
Oof butvman those radtoads in the Mire... I think I know where all our lost damage went.
---
F
---
Excellent, exactly what I wanted to know! Thank you!
---
Great, thank you! and thanks for the Wiki link too! Looks like we will grab the game and give it a try! I appreciate the replies!
---
Huh, crazy then.  But certainly believable considering all the other weird bugs that are in the game!
---
No one ever played it, ever. Not once did I ever even see another person there.
---
I see pink. Were they being controlled by a Flatwoods Monster?
---
Yeah secret service is great armor, definitely worth it.
---
The game got so stagnant I barely got to lvl 5 on the first battle pass
---
its worth it for the chest piece and jetpack
---
but if you have legendary perks equipped that require a full matching set of armor then best to commit the 7k bullion or more it costs for the full set.
---
i sell all those junk rewards for a chunk of caps.  honestly, id rather just have the caps as a reward than soak up the daily 1400 my toons can get
---
Encryptid anyone?
---
Nothing wrong with my fiberglass connection.
---
Make sure you have rank 5 ironclad and rank 3 blocker if your going to melee without power armor. I did unarmed prior to one wasteland and had a blast punching everything
---
The mask is the raider pathfinder mask and was /is available through the raider content package in the same menu that you purchase blocks of atoms.
---
It's worse now because of my legendary perks. You know enemy's explode and fly to somewhere.
---
Thinking about that event is so weird now that we have all these anti griefing rules, I never got to try it but I thought it sounded really cool
---
what is apotheker? anyway. if you are at 15 strength you will be fine. if not you can use the legendary strength perk card to get to 15. if you are lucky you can get +1STR on all armor pieces.
---
Yup.  Just logged off so I don't get a bunch of auto completes.
---
If they drop guns etc, and we did pick them up does that mean we will be pvp flagged? or something? Sorry for dumb questions!
---
No it doesn't. Never has. That was just a coincidence. It completed ten times last season while I was off. Never while I was signed in.
---
I’m trying to turn my main commando to something like This myself.  
---
Heavy/commando looks like it could be real good for this patch.
---
Well it is the best normal armor set there is. And only one you can equip with jetpack.
---
You can at least rename the chassis so it is always at the top of your apparel list
---
I don’t mind them. I have fun watching them run for their live from the the bears and deathclaws   Reminds me of my first few months at beta
---
Okay, okay I spelled it wrong. You got me.
---
You nuked a maiden? What's wrong with you?!?!
---
Or at least give us the option to turn off the extra effects. 
---
Or even better, allow us to change enemy corpse "bags" into what we have for our drop bags.
---
no perfectly fine questions.
---
when somethings dropped it appears in a loot bag (comestic store items can change the appearance)
---
you hover over it and can view whats inside and take it.
---
like most dropped items in other games
---
Back on the beat stash houses have stacks as well.
---
hopefully no more PA skins.....  
---
as non PA player with a bathrub, all these armor skins mean nothing to me. would be nice if they had something else in mind...
---
Same thing happened to me using a workbench. Got stuck in the animation, had to crash the game since I couldn't even log out
---
If you call out a cargobot for a nuke card it gives you prewar money.
---
Yea that's the problem. They are fun and really strong but not the best at mobs...
---
I had a build only with them back in the past and the fav wheel only filled with BP weapons haha
---
I’ve completed that event once by myself with my current toon. Omg the memories! Definitely one of the most memorable fight, it’s the only time I feel like gang fighting in a populated wasteland back when it was empty. 
---
Now the 2 colliding factions don’t even have epic fights.
---
to be fair a lot of the super-neat items have gone to the seasons.  (eg water faucet, the new foosball table, ammo deally (that also had to be fixed, haha))
---
and, has anyone else noticed the new jams available on the theremin?  its triiiipppyyy maaan!
---
hey I'm sorry man, but you did tell me to look it up
---
You're a bit heavy on qol imo
---
There's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I'd either drop power user (if you don't use gattling lasers) or 3 ranks of gunsmith for nerd rage
---
Because IRL a silencer doesn’t work on a revolver.
---
I’ll be happy to just get a skin for the damn thing
---
Why not just have area looting?
---
Good point. There have been a few times where I've given low level players resources but only because I had too much junk in my stash. But, there was also one time where I shot someone point-blank with a shotgun over a 5cap bounty. So, understandable.
---
I got to lvl 20 yesturday
---
Go prime, trust me it's 100% worth it.
---
There must be some perk card that blocks it somehow. Looks like i gotta test it pushing out one by one to find out which one.
---
Ironglad is one of the worst perks there is for survivability. Extremely expensive (5 ranks) for just 50 DR/ER which is nothing, and has close to zero effect on your damage taken. There are several better perks to make you tankier.
---
The doors mutated.
---
Ah ty
---
lol me 2 -- we need more emotes &amp; dances!!
---
Haha nice. Yeah I got the revolver in my first 50ish
---
"I get that reference"
---
I was thinking that last night but didn’t want to actually put it out there yet. Considering the dozen a day posts it does seem like they did fix it.
---
Yep. Sony players are probably not getting any new Beth games. It would be a *very stupid* and unprofitable business move if Microsoft does it any other way.  
---
After all.. can Playstation play Halo? nope? Halo wasn't released on the Playstation, right?..... lol  
---
ESO and FO76 will continue to be supported on those platforms though. That was announced.
---
It's trash just give it to me for free..... ill take it off your hands...   
---
but for real if it hadnt already sold I would gladly have paid 3k for it. Nice find.
---
It legit needs to do atleast the damage that the Gauss Pistol does, if not more. I want 2 look at things and have them go pssshhhhhh like in Fallout 3. Ofcourse I dont expect it to one shot the SBQ and Earl, but it should be atleast good enough for Gunslimger build to bring it to those figths.
---
consider dropping lone wanderer. play on public team, casual for more xp, and get strange in numbers. the benefits on a team are way higher than lone wanderer and if you dont want to interact with the others, they will leave you alone like 95% of the time.
---
You never know, Sheogorath likes to spoon all kinds of critters.
---
Easy to solo even for low level. Gotta be quick as they do lock back up after the event. I believe the last one has a big pile and 4-5 safes.
---
That’s a lot of work to do 300/hit.
---
Which ones? I would get downed in about three swings from a ghoul before ironclad
---
Yes i remember doing it once. The npcs got confused and both sides were attacking my friend 😆
---
The only thing I can understand having a cap is Camp Build Items in Adventure Mode. Everything else seems stupid.
---
I sniff the pipe
---
PIPE IS LIFE.
---
You see when 2 Behemoths really love each other...

I would mainly use it in a nuke zone when I’m running around in my Chinese stealth almost armor. In the time it takes to open the pipboy go to apparel pick a pa place it get in it I would be scorchbeast poop.oh wait forgot put a fusion core back in it.
---
Do you even Fallout bro?  This is a feature not a bug going back to FO3. It forces you to slow down, discover new parts of the terrain, use explosives sparingly, try different views and perspectives, and appreciate the details of the world.
---
Happy cake day
---
I sniff it every time. Pipe is life.
---
How would you have them be stronger?  Surely you don't expect them to do as much dps as a rifle or heavy gun?
---
I want outlines on loot and bodies like Outer Worlds. Best thing ever.
---
Now if only we had a map for the others lol
---
seems like Bethesda considers it finished
---
I just got a magic Gatling laser so I’ve been testing it out, I run nerd rage because of the damage buff and the damage resistance. I’m constantly below 20% health. How much difference is there with gunsmith as opposed to with out it? Is it very noticeable?
---
I want one for my camp
---
They have been a part of every Meat Week.
---
For once i was excited to see him come up to me.  YES, give me my money... so I gently lifted my finger off the trigger for the first time, in a long time.. he gave me my reward..... a pipe pistol with a few rounds.... for this insult..... I mini nuked us both.
---
I don't disagree.... but honestly caps are so easy to come by even just selling ammo at 1 cap each for everything and plans at 25 caps for most I just sell heavy items at discount to move them out quickly. I've had max caps 3 times in the last month and I have been buying all unknown plans from vendors/npc. I sell awesome weapons at like 5k absolute max so i can move them quickly and still make decent cash without hitting storage limit.  
---
The only caveat is if I finally go for buying all mutation serums then I will get more serious with my sales.
---
Well yea. That’s what I mean. U can combine the two now.
---
I agree, I was only commenting on how to max XP with the public teams part.  So the team bond will hold while switching but you also need a moment you are not running or being shot to switch, unless you are a complete tank.  The change would be best just before the boss fight.  Again, probability not with it.  And if playing with unknowns not on mic it would only confuse the other players. 🙂
---
I feel like everytime I join teams they kick me. I even help them out as much as I can. Strange in numbers makes me jump a lot higher tho haha
---
Ty!
---
I recently reequipped my Xmas tent.
---
It’s fun placing it by the pumpkin house
---
Yes, both are very high end.  Attainable, but high end.  BE gat plas were duped to hell and back on pc though, so if OP is on pc they may have better luck.  Still hard to get though.
---
Yes, very much so I think.  I actually look forward to every Tuesday to see what’s new in the Atomic Shop and it sucks when they add nothing good or just rehash old items multiple weeks in a row.  There are some things in the files I wish they would finish up and sell.  At this point, I feel like a broken record making those suggestions as they fall upon deaf ears.
---
3 caps may be on the low side but buying dog food for 50 caps is absurd, I probably wouldn’t even go up to 10
---
I would say that you specialize in a power armor or without PA (you can put a mod for your backpack that helps with chemicals or food and have free space to be able to another card ) there are several cards that you can remove (as good with salt) and change them to cards that are combat oriented but it is your style of play, adapt as you think necessary
---
We need so many more repair kits as the more bullets it takes to kill things means the more scrap or repair kits needed to fix our guns! Earle doesn't give us repair kits!
---
Blocker in strength is Great. You always want damage reduction before resintance.
---
Edit: fireproof and rejuvinated in endurence is also very good
---
Mutation serums
---
durtty pipe sniffers
---
recently?
---
it has always been underwhelming
---
You're the first one to find it. That's the true end-game of Fallout 76. You've won!
---
(/u/AFUSMC74 taught me how to be chippy)
---
Lots of great stuff here. Only thing I wish for was that public teams had a means for the creator/leader to set somr ground rules or expectations for those looking to join. Maybe a box to type a message into. With many folks not having mics, it makes communication harder when it comes to these nuances. Personally, I prefer mics over trying to find other ways to communicate.
---
No, were on season 2. That's long gone.
---
True, maybe there aren't enough great ideas for both. But the difference for me is that I have another feeling about stuff from the atom shop, because I can choose if I want to get something or not. There is some stuff I would like to get from the seasons run, but not everything and so most is just okay to me, because I get it anyway while trying to get to the point where I get those two or three items I really want.
---
I have had pretty good luck doing them solo just not getting them done in time lol SNS_bulldog I'll be on after work today I'm only level 68 anyone is free to add me
---
Now I feel left out. I want to sniff the strange pipe! I have never seen such a thing!
---
If your on PS4 let me know where your at. I'll be there.
---
That and the Ammo Converter (and Lunchboxes!) are available from Foundation and Crater (not sure who has which) for gold bullion now that Season 1 is ended!
---
Was able to do it once. Only one player showed. Never saw it again.
---
Nooo... wheres the map for season 2 rewards?
---
Would totally get that.
---
Drunk. Misread xD
---
Pipe is life.
---
Corpses in flatwoods also have a bunch if they werent looted already too. I used to do that for cloth but just go to the bookstore now. 150ish books there.
---
I renamed mine with a number in front of the name so it is at the top of my apparel list.
---
Wow...
---
Ah i see
---
I lasered a legendary scorchbeast the other day and it disintegrated in the air. It looked hilarious as all the dust fell to the ground, but then I realized it was impossible to find any lootable ashes and I was sad. I gave up after a few minutes, but I keep thinking how that loot was probably amazing just because I couldn’t find it.
---
Or just kill a possum in this game, it'll get yeeted away as if you just shot it with a mininuke
---
Ring the bell three times, guaranteed to work.
---
i just want a 90%RW ripper and dragon to hang on my wall...guess that's not gonna happen till this gets fixed
---
No, you are not.
---
It's not really as bad as you think. If you have Good With Salt, that stuff takes what feels like a month before it spoils. I usually have so much of the mutant hound and glowing meat steaks that I have to start vendoring them. And you find a lot of pepper lying around if you know where to look.
---
And where would someone who just started replaying find those guys?
---
You are probably alright putting the points from it else where
---
All good.  Have another on me =)
---
Shout out to OP for their service once again.
---
First off your GT would be helpful so we know where to go by. Now on to the list I usually look for:
---
Stable flux, (most recently) radshield ,stims,ammo , ballistic bock, high voltage hefe's
---
That was just the daily effect, they can explode on death, freeze you on hit... etc.
---
Right? Like I can’t even see in the game that well. I got my flashlight on 24/7
---
I honestly don't know if I've seen it before and just never noticed it or not encountered before...all of a sudden it was there in the distance directly beneath a power pylon and I just had to investigate.
---
Guaranteed to recieve a legendary item the first time you buy one if you do this.
---
I am level 412 and still get killed.  In time you will figure it out, there is plenty of help out there, don't be afraid to ask for it when you are stuck, there is no use in dying over and over.
---
Next time the ops is in the Burroughs, start it by yourself, find the first spot. Exit the Op. then go into the Burroughs outside of the Op event and memorize that first sprint.
---
Then start the Op again and find the next spot. Exit Op. Go back into the Burroughs. Learn the next sprint.
---
Repeat process for the third and fourth. 
---
I was able to memorize the sprints fairly quickly and now I can breeze through the Burroughs.
---
Im not so sure about the PA reboot perk. Im using it at lvl4 but it is not even close to beeing reliable. Im at the point that i think its bugging out in combination with some perk cards. Because since i maxed it two days after the update, i only saw it working once.
---
Edit: Now thinking about it i must say the one time it worked i just had it on lvl2 or 3. So i never saw it working on max lvl yet.
---
Blue suitcases at train stations. Trashcans and cig dispensers too
---
Agreed.  On another note, I have already gotten duplicate plans for making elder and it's barely a week old.   That isn't fun either.
---
This is where someone tells me that hey, the whole point is to keep you playing the event and grinding the event.
---
I say that is a lazy, awful way to encourage continued game play.  A better way is to, I dunno... offer new rewards every now and then.  Instead of expecting people to grind for a year to get an outfit.
---
It really fucking annoys me that they put the train in with the stupid donut stuff
---
If only they would set the slider to 100 caps you could easily set the prices... the slider adds 1250 caps... That's another non sense...
---
Another thing that's always bugged me is the western revolver is a modern revolver instead, and the single shot is really a western single action design. bugs the crap out of me.
---
They just told you where to get them.
---
Think he ment chemist backpack.
---
You're not the asshole for saying no. But you're kinda hung up on the money aspect, which is irrelevant for the most part.
---
I am at work and can't see IMGUR pic but thanks for reminding me to pull out my Chally costume when I get home.
---
thats fair.  i wonder if they calculated soaking up those excess atoms out there w/ the ssn mechanic.  (ie the hidden fireplace door deally is worth x amt of funny money, so playesr spend the atoms to get to that level)
---
i agree also w/ ur point about what choices id rather have when shopping, too.  generally, id like to see more dances in the shop; can we get a fuzzy brenda "whooaa nelly?!"
---
Yea i have those perks also so occasionally they do still do boom
---
Underrated comment, gj
---
I loathe dodgy.
---
Can confirm. I have received a Legendary Item from her every time I have rung the bell three times.
---
Foundation and Crater are locations for the Settlers and Raiders
---
Run thru the dry lake bed at new gad, I see the pipe at least once a week, straight out from summerville docks
---
I think that's from berry mentats
---
Just try playing again without it and see how easily you die.  There's a reason ths moniker is tank and not Ghost Division.
---
First of all, how dare you. 
---
Second, whip ‘em out boys, we did it!!
---
when you're trying to hang out and your mom wants you to come home now
---
Crater is where the Crashed Space Station used to be in the Toxic Valley - the gold vendor is in the Crater Core where Meg is. Foundation is where Spruce Knob used to be in the Savage Divide, and Samuel is straight back against a sign. If you have not played through the main Wastelanders questline and chosen a side, none of this is available to you yet. Do BOTH foundation and crater until the point of no return, you'll know it. Have fun!
---
Too true, IRL silencers aren't able to make a weapon silent anyway, but we have a silencer option for the .45 pipe pistol in game today so that logic is already busted. While I'm dreaming of what could be, could we have a silencer for the 10mm SMG? Please?
---
What you want your new build to be would probably help us help you better.
---
Dodgy seems to work best with low health builds. The extra AP regen you get from Nerd rage balances the drain
---
I generally sell most plans under 50 caps. If by default it says 200, i put them down to 20. Though some plans, depending on what they are i put them to like 100 to 500. Plans for those prices are generally power armour or weapon plans.
---
Pipe is Life!
---
You have to type it in all caps, otherwise it doesn't count. Have I taught you nothing?
---
this might be a good starting place for you: [build](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwMNAwUECwoBAQELAgMFBgkKDA0PEAEwQAUnAvABA8QBA3sDxQEDzQEBfAOAAQO5AQFwAgoD3gEBpQED8QEDwgEBUQPrAQM2AhgBWQG7AQPVAQEZAgA=)
---
really? i got never kicked so far. perhaps they wanted a free slot for a friend. in that case, just open up another casual team or join an event team. if i remember right, at least strange in numbers works also when you're solo in a team.
---
.38
---
.44
---
10mm
---
These ammos are worthless to me, even for points (too much of a PITA).
---
But for lower levels, it's precious.
---
10 stim packs mean nothing to me, but for lower levels, once again, precious.
---
Plus, yeah, weight... I tend to carry 1-200 stimpacks at most, anything more I tend to dump. I don't use stimpacks often, but when I do, I use alot.
---
I only really use dodgy in pvp, apart from that I don't need it on.
---
Don't even get me started on the lever action not sharing ammo with the western revolver.
---
40% actually should be a lot. But im using it on lvl4 and its bad. I never saw it working. There must be something wrong.
---
It does
---
Haven't had it happen yet this update and I've been logged in at reset for a few days to test it!
---
It's completely understandable.  The only person who I would feel comfortable with asking to use their private server without them on is someone who I play with like every day.
---
Depends on the server really. Just like sbq event. Get on the right server and people were doing it. Meat events have changed that again.
---
Yeah. Even if you have the Gain AP when hit mod for power armor you still lose AP. It’s good against slow rate of fire or melee enemies but a Minigun super mutant will make you rage.
---
I changed your [build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=d14699e&amp;d=sq2s22sr2s32sb1eu0ip2ir2a72a04lu2l71lt2ls2xa1x91x61p02e31eh2c62ck0ce0s70lb2x71ic4s00&amp;w=pe2l22l12&amp;m=51c249fe3&amp;wp=w7&amp;wm=142538) to include legendary specials so you can equip more perks
---
That's a good idea. Or exempt the SBQ and Earl.
---
Bethesda wants to know why you're so determined to find that 1 star cultist dagger that you wont ever have space in your daily limit (or your stash) to turn into vouchers.
---
Yeah thank you.
---
Think youre right. I have never had mine auto complete and I have not bothered loggning of once
---
Yes you are, feel free to give me all your stuff and you will feel oh so much better.
---
Found the asshole
---
in the game. same place the season 1 map was.
---
I actually had an idea for a general use bench.  Can only make atomic shop items and repair ones you already have, but can break down everything.
---
Yes, let's save the time travelers from getting prewar money
---
Imo, server hop.  Buy one thing, than server hop.  It may be completely random, but I've seen enough to think it's just a really bad algorithm.
---
I would have said, nah I'm about to log off. Then id remove them from my friends list later. :P
---
Nice to know all my hard work has paid off.
---
That's like some Seal team 6 level of coordination. Definitely getting blood from a stone.
---
How is it irrelevant? I pay the bill and he doesn't but still wants to get the benefits. I don't even know the guy other than a trade we did months ago
---
Probably keep it 1 handed melee. And I use a rifle on the side for now, no power armor at the moment
---
Check your mutations. You may have Unstable Isotope, which triggers that effect when you are hit in melee. And/or Plague Walker. Both at the same time are even more fun!
---
I find legendary corpses tend to disappear under the map more often. Use you camera the weapon one to find them. Easy peasy.
---
Is it not on the legendary table? I have a vats legendary alien blaster.
---
staying with one handed? high health or low health build? power armor or no power armor? are you wanting to switch to heavy guns or shotguns? if guns, vats or no vats?
---
If you can find a bench you were last on quick enough, you can revert the animation I found out.
---
But that can be a nightmare depending on where you are
---
Agreed with you and the answer is: No they can't see it, but it doesn't matter to them.
---
That's one of the drawbacks of opening franchises (a bit too much) to other audiences: you change the franchise's cores and former fans are disappointed.
---
Maybe Microsoft will change that in the future, but I wouldn't hold my expectactions high.
---
I think we'll have to move on to other post-apocalyptic, dark games...
---
The drum mag on handmade to hold 75 rounds not 30...
---
Yep flux and repair kits are better endgame rewards. The last thing most people need are more trash legendaries and people that run Earle regularly already have multiples of all the plans. 
---
Plus now that the queen can be crippled again it’s a fun fight.
---
I think that in these online games, the creative juices just eventually dry up.    We have already seen this to a degree with the legendary run and now the score board.  Both introduced a new grind with 3-5 items (out of 100) that I actually wanted. 
---
I mean, honestly, how long can you keep pumping out fresh, fun content for the same game?
---
Pipe. Is. Life.
---
I said it's irrelevant for the most part. One mention, sure. You mentioned it 5 times. Seems excessive to me.
---
Wow I never even thought of that. Good luck sir lemme know what you find.
---
If your camp unit is on an object that can be destroyed, the object being destroyed can send your camp module into the ether to never be recovered unless you move your camp. Outside of that, it can't be destroyed.
---
Low health, no power armor, with vats and I'd love to switch to heavy guns but I'm rifle for now
---
I tank just fine without it.
---
Prosnap camera finds them for you.
---
No you're not. You pay for it, it's yours to do how you see fit. It would be different if you've played together and we're actual friends, instead of just a random add for a trade.
---
No, get legenday Power Armor instead if you are in PC
---
Ah right, I couldn't remember whereabouts it fell. Shame they didn't fix it and put it back in, it's a bit of a dead space up there aside from the burial...
---
The Green Thumb perk card is very handy when gathering the materials from plants.
---
Sadly, the true end game in FO76 is to manage a healthy weight and stash....
---
So dog food, 8 caps. Set every third one i get to 30 caps just for you. I will have to learn farming locations of those drugs you mentioned. Do you know if the audio cue perks are worth it for finding magazines and bobble heads?
---
That’s actually a really cool idea. I would love that!
---
I like your posts beefy.. You tell it like you see it
---
I saw an animatronic clown in someone's camp today. Not the plans for it though, just the clown, but now I really want to find those plans. It was terrifying.
---
I woulda let em join,&amp; then logged off &amp; did whatever I was gonna do to begin wit...
---
I dunno If it boots a non first member,but I know I’ve played on a fellow 1st members server,after they left,&amp; was good for as long as it took me to finish up.
---
That being said,I am a first member as well,it was just easier to stay vs makin my own server,as I was already logged Into that one,I don’t know if it works the same for a non member or not
---
Where would i find a list of whats considered "rare"?
---
I think you are wrong there. Which makes me wonder, which games have **you** been playing.
---
In previous installments, it was dark humor and it was tiny little pieces scattered around...
---
Not Fasnacht events after meat-week events after halloween parties after who knows what kind of goofy event they'll come up next with silly costumes and childish stuff constantly popping up...
---
Depends on how nice your current Unyielding set is for legendary effects. If you have a full set of Unyielding AP Refresh, WWR, Cavalier or Sentinel it will take thousands of legendary modules to roll a set of secret service armor that good. If you're okay with 1* pieces of Unyielding it should only take 50-100 modules or so. 
---
I went for full 3* Unyielding SS and it took me 300+ modules to get a set that still isn't better than my full 2* Powered set of Heavy Combat I had before. It has better damage resist but I only have one piece powered so in general I'm still slightly worse off, but I do have a jetpack so I can't complain too much. Lol.
---
no offense, but who in their right mind even runs a pistol build?
---
Nicely done
---
Butt what did you do with it?
---
Yeah I'm not doing it 🙂 I like shooting stuff running and trying not to die.  I'm real good at forgetting to watch my health and dying.  BUT THAT IS THE ONLY TIME I LEAVE THE UPLINK THING IS WHEN I DIE, sorry just wanted to make a point of that in case anyone reads this .. lol
---
Not even the money bit fella, you said yourself you were nearly done and was gonna log off for a bit thars all you needed to say
---
Hehe yah I saw someone’s camp that pretty much had every daily ops reward in it.  Me... I just get the glaive plan and 3 stash boxes....
---
I have legendaries clip into the ground all the time but if you hit the sweet spot you can still loot them.
---
I have never tried despite having all of them at one point. And do t sell dog food short. It's the only food with it's own perk and doesn't rot.
---
I think was in your public team couple days ago.. I have a friend who blocks anyone from joining when he's in private. I don't know what he's doing in there xD
---
So does anyone know what happened to that crop planter that was in the Test Server that looked like it was going to be part of the Armor Ace stuff but now isn't? Will it be coming to the Atom Shop then?
---
Doesn't matter if OP mentioned 10 times. The money is a big part of first. Why do you wanna pay for someone else to use it that you don't know or even talk to?
---
Because I have to work for what little money I have and this is the only thing I really buy that isn't groceries, rent, utilities and etc.
---
Well played, sir
---
Sometimes people just don't switch the team type fter they run it or are doing it with a group of friends. I regularly have people join and start one right after I run it. Nobody is responsible for carrying other people through events regardless of level. If people choose to be nice and help out great but no one is required to do anything for you or anyone else in the game.
---
Yeah it would seem it's not Butcher's Bounty. I run the perk and saw that my animal loot pools were doubled, anyone  who saw that would have assumed that perk being bugged was responsible
---
Trial and error, thats the only way for us rn mate. I let you know if i find something.
---
But the thing is, this could even be a gear problem. I hope its not my strangler PA.
---
did you read the note? Pipe is Life
---
I first saw the pipe when Wastelanders dropped.
---
Is there some way to find the pipe or is it random
---
Yes please! :)
---
Yes, I remember your username.  Thank you for the extra intelligence.
---
Thank you for this post. I haven’t played for awhile because the grind was way too frustrating for me. I’ll have to give it another shot.
---
Ok, nice they changed that then.instead of spending all your stimpacks for nothing . Cool
---
Depends on which pipe gun 😂
---
I think there’s a link to a spreadsheet of rare outfits floating around.  Up in the search bar put in “rare outfits” and I’m sure you’ll find the thread.  Not sure about a list for rare plans though maybe someone will chime in.
---
VTU is your own instance and has tons
---
I appreciate your situation, my dude. All I'm saying is that the information isn't really our business.
---
Or there's an enclave season where we'll be getting the enclave power armor / x02 from fallout 3.
---
Enclave has really not gotten much from updates, basically nothing in the atomic shop, so it would be nice.
---
Should have just let him in.  If he’s not a 1st member he would get kicked out the server if ur not in it.  
---
5-10 minutes.  Whatever the timer is.  If it still does this anyway.
---
Do you know what tab the claim tokens are under in your inventory? I have no idea how many (if any) I have
---
That character only has 3 in take one for the team, kind of gimpy but yeah. He does have a lot of lunch boxes though.
---
Nope.
---
I forgot there even were behemoths in fo76. I haven't seen one in the past 100 levels or so.
---
I guess I only needed to hear the information once to understand. YMMV.
---
That's the only thing i want!  
---
Don't mind selling the other plans, i had a bos suit gone in the first check at 10000 caps.
---
It won't be rare forever so i get the caps now when people want them.
---
Solar panel are next.
---
yeah, thanks! i also like it
---
Hammer lock time makes single actions like colt SAA tougher to shoot more accurately than a double action like the S&amp;W 29. SAA hammers have to travel a MUCH further distance before they hit firing position resulting in human error being a bigger factor than double actions like the model 29. This plays a much bigger factor than the moving parts. Besides number of parts in regards to accuracy is redundant if the revolver has a solid lockup and is in time.
---
But i do agree with you in terms of how they should perform in the game. 44 pistols (maybe make it 38 cal, and call it a service revolver) should be fired much faster in double action, have a faster reload, cost less AP but do about 2/3 the damage. 
---
The western should be a little less accurate than the others and do the most damage. Also fired single action like it currently is.
---
The single action should have an increased accuracy (maybe a hidden vats accuracy boost like a built in aswell,  like 33% hit chance),it would have very good hipfire and its base stats should be the same as the "fancy" single actions, has meaning 30% faster reload/fire rate and 10% reduced AP cost vs the standard single action. To top it off it needs more mods for barrels,grips and receivers.
---
I'm a straight shooter. Pew pew.
---
All of the railways in f76 are terrible, there are rollercoasters that are less intense.
---
You get the radiation emitter from graham?
---
[https://imgur.com/a/OSXjctq](https://imgur.com/a/OSXjctq)
---
Exactly. My #1 wanted mod (if mods ever come to console).
---
A step in the right direction, but doesn't mitigate the damage nerf. Pistol builds were already pretty crappy before, now they're even crappier.
---
*cough cough* wastelanders is worse than the base game *cough cough*
---
How do you get enough ammo for this? I have a level 50 V.A.T.S. Unknown, which is a three star legendary alien blaster. I’m using it on my Space Cowboy but there’s not enough ammo!
---
The game missed you and welcomed you back with open arms.
---
If you want to see one do the Cranberry bog Primal cut event. Say hi to Chuck for me.
---
Don't get your hopes up
---
If youve been on the same server the primal cuts locations are covered with loot with no bodies or meat piles. I always go around seeing whats there for acid ect. Even find legendary weapons that were left behind.
---
My bloodied melee character lost about 90% of his damage against the sbq. I've been trying to figure out what to do with him. Instigating seems to be better than bloodied now on normal mobs.
---
Man I’m just waiting for them to add veterans daily ops or 
---
Unlocking them all for regular rewards
---
They can't please everyone all the time. Just because something doesn't fit your taste doesn't make it underwhelming. 
---
If we were getting absolutely awesome must buy stuff every week people would just switch to complaining about how expensive everything is or how Bethesda is tricking them into spending their free atoms or how it should have been been available free from in game.
---
pretty sure its under misc
---
i have an instagaining combat shotgun, kills everything humanoid
---
Where is a quick place to find a glowing creature?
---
I know when I joined a friends server before I was a 1st member it would kick u.   When he would leave I would be able to play for a couple minutes but then get a message that i would be getting booted and a timer came up.
---
My turrets LOVE to shoot Grahm and Chally, and I hate it. Every time it ends with Grahm running up and destroying the turret and then bashing out a wall before walking back to the road and going on his merry way. They aren't even hostile! STOP THE MADNESS!!
---
heavy guns get 45% anti armor from the stabilized perk card, but only in power armor.
---
Wait it was destroyed? I ran melee last night without issue. Maybe because I am not bloody?
---
Item already exists, it'll probably be brought back.
---
It was actually part of the bug where players were pulling items out of people's stashes. Let's hope when they bring it back, they don't bring back that bug.
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;very stupid  
---
&gt; and unprofitable business
---
It'd be unprofitable to sell games to more people? Ok, that makes sense...
---
They ALREADY have a "highlight a body" system, that Berry Mentats triggers.  Just turn it on for dead legendaries!!!
---
How are you getting that many caps, and why don't you stop doing that?
---
How much? [I have 500] i like trade more than caps ps4.
---
You can find a glowing ghoul a lot of the time at Freddy's fear house
---
This is mines [Bloody HW](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f164e5b&amp;d=sq2s22s32sr2pe0eh2ib4s12ip2a04l71lt2lu2cu2x30xp0xn0x10xj0es2ce0ir2lg2sg2xb0&amp;m=01c29feb3&amp;n=Heavy%20guns)
---
When will the daily ops resets
---
foliage needs to stay on because disabling it is borderline cheating, thwarting anyone or anything using camouflage
---
Thank you!!
---
So I still get around 400 damage with my death claw 2 star bloodied gauntlet. I have no perks for it and I know it got hit hard as I was near 1k. But is it that bad? When I use it I still 2 to 3 hit enemies. I mean are you upset that you can’t hit 52k like captain noob did against Earle? I’m not trying to be a dick I’m seriously asking so hopefully you don’t take it that way.
---
Its for the drops and the "daily challenge". Also you get lot of xp and stuff
---
I mean Sony has way more exclusive titles than Microsoft does . I can only think of halo for Microsoft , while I can think of 5+ for Nintendo and Sony
---
I want the Chinese pistol in this game.
---
Could be modded to be an automatic or semi-auto pistol.
---
He had it in his inventory for me yesterday, too, so I hope you get it!
---
nooe, you pay for it, you can do what ever you want.  
---
just a technical question: i assume he dont have 1st, he would just went to his own world. so, its possible to play on a private world as a non 1st player? is it possible via invite? i've never thought about that. i always thought, if you dont pay, you dont get private worlds, at all.
---
Not something you can really craft, but I'm always on the lookout for treasure maps (max 50-60c)
---
Hell of a welcome home party!
---
Same I was slapping people with my war glaive and it was working fine
---
Sorry, sensei. I’ll work on that.
---
Which craftable items would you like to see?
---
Never logged off of the game at noon just for the reset. Never had an autocomplete.
---
Its quite boring being answered the same way whenever you push for variety in FO76. "Oohh, but I use my min-maxed meta-legendsry effects, Full-combat focused build with (insert weapon that does 10 damage here) and I kill a single mob with 30 bullets, and thats perfectly fine by me, so it MUST be fine to everyone else, so you have a problem with your build, not the weapon."
---
I had a medic western revolver. I sold it this week. I loved it, but the lack of mods and the level changes on npcs meant i just csnt use it anymore. I hope next year we see a whole overhaul on the meta and combat focused gameplay, to sllow other builds and playstyles to have a place in FO77
---
I usually buy serum recipes or recall cards to run Encryptid.
---
No. If it were me I'd probably have replied, "Sure, as long as you can drop 3k 5.56 for me while you're in there. Could use some stable flux, too."
---
Ass, gas, or grass. Nobody rides for free.
---
Nuke zones are best but anywhere with critters, bugs or ghouls have a chance.
---
If you're going to make the double actin a .38, then sure,  lower damage per hit
---
If i was going to change things around,  then I'd make the western fire .45. Higher damage,  longer reload,  slower fire rate. 
---
That leaves the single action.  Make it a .44 magnum like the super Blackhawk. Same as western but better accuracy and highest damage. 
---
Part of the reason single action is potentially more accurate is that it's more likely to be aimed for rather than spray and pray. Like a bolt action rifle vs semi auto.
---
Any specific kind?
---
Turn in your max for the day, then visit the purveyor the next day after the reset. this way your daily allotment is available for you to scrip what she gives, and you don't get stuck having to store or carry any useless and heavy 3\*'s you get. It takes an extra day to get started, but You'll probably be happier in the long run.
---
yess! unstable isotope is the mole
---
True as that is, it would make 0 sense to turn a franchise who’s never been exclusive into a console exclusive game. I really hope we don’t see that happen anytime soon especially with fallout, I haven’t owned an Xbox since the year of the Xbox 360 release and after the RROD never bought another and stuck with PC and Sony products
---
I think my system is mad I ordered my new xbox yesterday :(
---
It’s already a thing. I have mine year round at my bar area. 
---
Hopefully it will make a return. IIRC it was a free item.
---
Every 3 stars i get i am alleays trying to sell in My vendor. If not sold after af couple days i scrip Them. Only Thing that is allowed to saty longer is bloodied weaps and uny armor.
---
Really? Automatic lasers used by Blood Eagles seem to hit me like a truck, even with pretty good energy resistance.
---
I’m level 115 and have been casually playing for a long time, this update has made the game suck and I’ve stopped altogether. EVERYTHING is a grind now. I tried to do a daily OP and could not finish It because the super mutants can see my ultra sneak character and no matter how many of them you kill the new spawned ones keep pouring in. This game is no longer relaxing and no longer fun.
---
I’m out until they fix it.
---
A dlc for TOW just came out though, dunno if it was timed exclusive on xbox or not
---
If they are borrowing assets from FO4, there are still plenty to exploit. I would love to have a train-building set, the modular metal parts, or a vault bunker set. There are still things in FO76 that could easily be used like the green wallpaper I've seen here and there, contemporary paintings, cash register stash boxes, more flora choices for gardens, shaped hedges, etc. There are endless ideas. There must be some other barrier.
---
unless you use a .50 machine gun, that's why i'm hoping to land a vamp gatling soon :p
---
I get then while doing daily and weekly missions. Daily ops, events, etc.
---
I think it works fine, but there's a bug where you have to unequip and reequip your perk gets to get them to work. And keep in mind the scaling on the queen, she's going to hit harder. Blocker, dodgy, serendipity, ricochet are your friends. Also, fireproof like said above.
---
Stand in range of the beacon
---
Thats all I care about
---
Stand in range of the fucking beacon
---
2 words: 
---
Auction Discord
---
I'm all about those perk card packs
---
It works. The player has to be at their camp for it to work. It's always been that way.
---
As for the description being cut off, when they aren't there you just click on the item like you're going to buy it and the whole description will show....
---
You know, I love this game, I put hundred and hundreds of hours into it, but I absolutely live for the roast posts of 76. There's so many "be happy with..." nah. I post hate out of love. I criticize the hell out of this game and bethesda, not because I hate them, but because of what the games/features/company COULD be. That said, enough 1* legendary fucking spoons for wading through 3,000 lbs of corpses and rivers blood for 10 fucking minutes.
---
issue is two shot
---
its 2x62.5% dmg
---
The way dmg works lower dmg is affected MORE by ammo, you might, very likely get more out of a plain weapon. than a lowwdaamage 2 shot
---
gettt an armor pen gauss pistol, tthen you will see
---
IN-CRED-I-BLLE
---
I see your Western and raise you the Single Action. Essentially another revolver with the same damage, but you reload rediculously slow compared to the other revolvers. Try reloading a quad single action, it takes like 5 minutes.
---
Psn cosmicmole if ready now
---
I'm not saying that there is necessarily a true score. All I'm saying is that one person's score isn't magically the score that applies to the game for everyone. You may give it a 3, I may give it an 8, neither of us is correct per say, it's just our (hopefully unbiased) views on the game.
---
But, if I talk to 100 people and 90 of them give the game an 8 and the remaining 10 people give it a 3, that's more or less a fair indicator of the quality of the game. It doesn't make those 10 people's low scores any less viable, it just means that they're the outliers and that their experience probably isn't going to be the general experience that most players will have. And that those 10 people possibly are either letting some of their bias score the game for them, or they're just not very good at judging the quality of the game.
---
Do you have all of the Serum Recipes?  How about all of the plans from all of the vendors?
---
Are you maxing out script every day?   You can go shopping for script at players vendors.  I typically buy legendary items for script at between 10 and 15 caps per script amount.  So a 3\* weapon would have to be 600 caps or under.
---
Do you have the max level weapons that you want?   Again, go shopping.  You'll be surprised at what you can find at player vendors for, what amounts to be, giveaway pricing for rare rolls.  
---
Personally, I buy up treasure maps as long as they are 100 caps or under, same with Bobbleheads (big guns, small guns, explosive, and a couple of others).
---
Oh yes.
---
If you're near the edge of the zone and they spawn outside it then run into it, they won't have the stuff. They have to spawn in the zone. Plus, Ionized Meat counts as a "special item," and it can replace stuff with actual value.
---
As opposed to giving *your competitor* games to sell?  
---
Yeah, very fucking stupid. Are you just not familiar with exclusive titles? 
---
Do you think you can play The Last of Us on Xbox? what about Uncharted?
---
I could swear I've seen a 24 hour cooldown in a silo, but I stand corrected.
---
Thats either domestic violence, or love. Probably both.
---
Dual wielding Legendary perk, with each level improving recoil, damage (true addictive) and reload speed
---
Or perk like Money Shot like salvadore from borderlands. Last bullet from magazine deals extra DMG
---
How doesn’t it? People buy playstations just for their exclusives . The only way it doesn’t happen is if PlayStation users are able to subscribe to game pass imo
---
It now takes me two hits to bring down a Level 75 Super Mutant instead of one.  Hardly would say that is unplayable. I’m still getting the second hit in before I move into Danger so Stealth is still viable. 
---
I never got to the “three swipes to take down SBQ” level, so I am sure those players were more dramatically affected.  But I’m not sure it even makes sense that you could kill the most dangerous enemy in 3 seconds. 
---
Fun, sure, but is the game broken now that you can’t do it? Not really.
---
Go play STALKER
---
Fires, poop, mess (?) have all been there when we first got Meat Week this year. I wasn't around for the original Meat Week, but I assume these were there as well.
---
The full list of things you can do (I'm sure someone will correct me if I missed something)
---
* Play on drums  (especially helpful the 2 minutes before the event starts)
---
* Run spits (especially helpful the 2 minutes before the event starts)
---
* Collect and deposit greens
---
* Collect and deposit critter chunks
---
* Put out fires
---
* Clean up poop
---
* Clean up messes
---
* Deposit wood (have to have on hand, doesn't come from stash)
---
* Deposit Chally Feed (have to make beforehand and have on hand)
---
I'm not entirely sure if depositing Prime Meats also helps with the event. I know it certainly helps you :-)
---
It is counter intuitive but BGS made the game much harder for characters that haven't reached level 50 with the latest One Wasteland update. The good news is that fighting every enemy at your level will generate more XP so you will level up faster then before. Lots of good suggestions in this thread already but using melee for mobs and having a weapon for each ballistic ammo (e.g. - 10mm, .38, .45, .308) type is helpful. One tip that I didn't see is that sometimes it is smarter to avoid combat. Focus on the mission alone because the XP and other rewards have a higher ROI then wandering and hunting every enemy you encounter. Make every shot count until you can afford to be more Rambo.
---
dude, i run a non bloodied pistoll build, gausspistols are AMAZING
---
I think this is what I'll end up doing. Ive looked at the cards several times and can't find any that really appeal to me or would benefit my play style. So i think I'm gonna use the SPECIAL cards to rank up cards I already use
---
Melee is far from broken. I roam the wasteland with a vampire boxing glove and solar scout armor. No problems here. Combine that with perks like taking one for the team and people on your team will appreciate everything you do. Granted you may have to give up your gaming of the system with +15 in your specials from unyeilding, but melee is not broken.
---
Whats really bothering is that they are almost indistinguishable, redundant, and yet the new Type 93 Chinese Assault Rifle skin and Service Rifle look alikes aren't even their own weapon.
---
I LOVE me some black hawks, heres my 2
---
Blackhawks https://imgur.com/a/RonjwI6
---
Top is a 45 colt 4 5/8" sbh with a vortex venom.3 moa dot for hunting. Sent the cylinder out for reaming last year for proper throat diamters to.shoot hardcast lead.
---
Bottom is a custom meduim frame flattop 44 special with a 5.5" barrel. Was a lispeys bisley originally.  Sent out to jack huntington for the work. Aluminum ejector rod housings and grip frame fitted, cylinder reemed, free spin kit installed , standard blackhawk trigger and hammer, and a little action work.  Little write up on it here of ya care to read it.

Sniiiffff ittt!
---
There's a legendary spoon?! I'm having flashbacks of Skyrim with the fork and knife.
---
And allow casual gamers to adapt rather easily.
---
Isn’t it etiquette to wait til it x4 exp bonus?
---
What would you try to achieve with that? That dude's loosing his equipment all the time while the settlers talk about some kind of turret defenses which apparently only they can see.
---
Agree, I have noticed the change, too - the day to day rhythm is much more sustainable, so I feel like I may actually have a shot at getting to those greenhouse walls.
---
And yeah, one purchase vs three...the latter just led to a lot of artificial small purchases.
---
Me: “another Pickaxe Pilsner, barkeep!l”
---
Bartender with glass head full of doughnuts:  “Are you sure about that, sir?”
---
And thirty minutes later, I’m driving my power armor into a radioactive pit.
---
News to me because I’m still doing fine with a full health Power armor build.  I even posted a few days ago an experiment I did with the All Rise and was able to 2-3 shot every super mutant at West Tek.  I was even able to do fine using an unmodified ghoul slayers baton, against super mutants. It might as well have been non-legendary.  Both of these tests were done without incisor or martial artist which would have increased my damage from armor penetration and faster swing speed.  
---
Melee was not destroyed, no more than any other build
---
I swear people are acting like if something can’t one shot everything that it’s no longer “viable”
---
Yes I did couple months back also find the random again and it might be a bomb you have to defuse and the wire you need to cut changes so you have to just guess. After almost two years of playing this game I just recently found those things like 4 months ago. It’s fun
---
I’ll keep server hopping till i find it 😋
---
I want the creepy clown painting.
---
Level 29 when I logged off last night. None purchased.
---
Also, if party favor Confetti is running from a lunchbox.
---
&gt;It's just a shame the Char legendary points dont count towards sharing...
---
you could always use a Legendary SPECIAL on a stat that's maxed or nearly maxed then move points into charisma when you max the card...
---
Ah. Didn’t know that.
---
I haven’t had any complete and didn’t have the problem last year and I’ve been on it during reset. So that’s just a rumor, it happened to ppl that weren’t even on
---
Sneak blooded pistol,  you have to think but you get most of the damage of a sneak rifleman. All of the perks being in agility along with sneak limits you but you can make it work. Just one of my 5, but my pistol packin' mamma is fun!
---
It's not a problem, everyone probably has unused levelups, just go get another one if you scrapped it already.
---
Combine ammo factory, ammosmith and super duper and you get some nice amounts of ammo per craft. Super duper doesn't add insane amounts but it does proc and give you more than if you didn't use it.
---

i sold my legendary one the other day for max caps
---
Well serums can be crafted, which is why I mentioned them. If food lasted longer I woulsld say food and drink.   As great as the vendors the while trading thing was definitely a second thought and thrown together. I typically don't buy much from vendors unless I see seems I need or plans. If I see ballistic fiber I'll pick up those too.
---
Yes, fires have always been part of meat week.
---
Put out Fires, Clean up scrap, and shovel chally poo are all secondary actions that you can do while farming Critter chunks.  They all count towards the progress bar.
---
Turning the spits while the wait timer is counting down will give the progress bar a head start.
---
Playing on the drums slows the progress bar from sliding backwards.  So it's probably the only event where AFK (away from keyboard) players contribute towards the success of the event and are worth their weight in critter chunks...  (grin)
---
I've encountered that bomb a few times around the world, was a first for me with the pipe though.
---
T-65 looks even dumber with its chestplate disconnected from the frame.
---
Where is the radiation emitter in the build menu? I learned the plan but I can't find it. Didn't see it in the defenses section.
---
Excellent list. This is what i need. What would you consider a good price for each of these? I know ammo is 1 cap per.
---
Those wing attacks are explosions, kind of like how exploding palm works
---
Try putting fireproof back on
---
I found bomb twice and think pipe once. And I was like what the hell is this. So you bet your ass I sniffed that shit
---
Burning mine is the easiest for me because the final boss spawns very close to the second booster.  Galleria is next easiest because it's a wide open area and easy to navigate.  Burrows sucks; I've found a route that works, but it's a close call time-wise.
---
Not to mention they were just trying to buy TikTok
---
Truly I have found the way....PIPE IS LIFE
---
Foosball table is also broken. If you leave your character playing it you’ll come back to your light on and weapon drawn with the sound being glitch looped permanently until you leave server
---
I love when vats spins me around to target a grenade someone threw while the target I was meaning to headshot can just saunter on up and push my shit in while I'm looking in the opposite direction, locked onto another target.
---
Ahh maybe the scaling then.  Good thinking. Gave tried re eqiping it when I get there but not using any other perks you mentioned.  Just posting to find a solution. Feeling like throwing my controller through the TV at times lol
---
yeah, that's what my plan is. I love the idea of being able to share 5 perks...
---
I forgot about reset and was logged in, and got the autocomplete bug.
---
Then watched as one by one, the completed daily list disappeared, and when the last one did, the daily category is gone.
---
If I start running low on stash space I will end up dumping a bunch somewhere but for the time I'm trying to see just how high i can get the number.
---
Not many people would be trusting enough to hand over their gear if I told them I was going to "repair" it, otherwise I would do just that and randomly fix other people's gear for free.
---
Niche market or not, i like to know. Gives me lots of options for things to do. Thank you.
---
Dodgy OP with unyielding. If you want it in PA, try getting hacked unyielding power armor or those AP refresh leg mods
---
Best legendary farm now is probably daily ops. Get 1-3 murmgh rolls per run, with a good group each run is 5 mins or less.
---
I get to play carnival games in my game? Will do.
---
I do have the Formula P recipe. And the mentats is a clever business observation. Wouldnt have thought of that.
---
Ski swords make zero sense. Even in a non-sensical fantasy sense.

That's not content
---
Carry honey and keep it on your favorites wheel.
---
In about 6 minutes. I find it resets at 12 pm US Central every day.
---
Did you record it? That sounds crazy
---
Is that really a thing? If i can find it will sell it.
---
A glowing mole miner is often in one of the houses in Welch.

Gotya.

Pretty much what I did with mine, the assaultron blade will not be getting made lol.

Not every location in the map has to be for content.
---
do you use sneak?
---
No, it's not.  Sorry.  It's kind of been a joke around the fo76 subs recently.
---
My bloodied melee went from doing 1600 damage with an AA gauntlet to a measly 360-400 max. Sad I have to revamp her. I really liked melee but it doesn't seem viable anymore.
---
Yeah I don’t get the reactor.. like why would I want something that takes up 3x more space for the same power as a fusion generator.
---
Also the Primal Cuts event (in the Mire) spawns glowing gulpers.
---
My GT is Fat_Boys_Brunch (Ps4). But it wont do you much good since i wont have hardly anything for a little while. This was mostly a post so i knew what i should start farming to stock my vendor. Still though, feel free to stop by to see what I have get.
---
Min maxing is significantly more important in OW. sorry about your hybrid build
---
I didn't read that whole post, but I can promise you a pistol build is currently more effective than a berserker build.
---
Oh yea he is very informative. As a level 470+ I still learn things from him all the time. This game is anything but consistent so it's nice he takes on all the new changes and breaks it down.
---
Same. The SPECIAL perks are clear winners. The only other one that's really tempting me right now is the "funky duds" poison resistance, since poison is the only thing that really wrecks me.
---
I'm always looking for .45, rare outfits, and rare plans. I personally sell worthwhile legendaries, and a lot of chems, serums and exotic beers/cocktails. My inventory moves pretty quickly, but I keep my prices fairly low.
---
5 characters, 3 full Heath and 2 bloodied.  I’ve gone take one for the team on all 5, the stealth damage boost on 2, what rads and funky duds on 2, rest is all special.  Very little in the so called legendary perks matches up to standard perk cards.
---
Let’s face it, being a double agent for the Enclave while wearing its highest commanding officers uniform immediately after slaughtering him is kind of a power move.

I would do something more in line like this.

I keep it for novelty purposes.  Similar to my pog collection

On Xbox, its from the same menu as "Leave team". There is an option for "Change team objective" there if you're the leader.

It is a random spawn in different locations.

I would like your help if i could borrow. I think i figured out a 'feature' but i haven't gotten any replies here.

Have you taken legendary perk electric absobtion and used it without PA?

Exactly. Fixer, handmade, combat... Still great for commando, second tier for a rifleman.

Not a power armor guy, sorry. Way to noisy for me.

Nice! I have a super Blackhawk bisley hunter with a Burris 3-9 power scope and a super Blackhawk with a 10.5" barrel.
---
I'm already half way through not even trying.
---
400 damage would be enough to 1-2 shot most enemies, how is that not viable?
---
Ssorry but shotgun shells are mine. Unless i get a few K via Daily Ops.

Thanks bud :)

Basically the team leader does their instance, once they finish, you'll have to switch team lead to do your quest

You can help your friend, or they can help you, but you can't both gain progress from the same quest stuff.

Not really. The dog had a personality, he seemed like a cool dude and like he actually gave somewhat of a damn. I barely listen to the radio on this game cause the dj lady just seems boring. Three dog would talk about things you did and even talk shit about you to a degree if you were an asshole. It motivated you to wanna meet him, even if you were trying hard to ignore the story line. This lady does not motivate me to wanna meet her lol just seems like a normal radio dj
---
Just drop them anyone who has killed a few mole miners will already have it learned.

Perhaps you should try a different recipe and try complementing with Nuka-Cola Orange.

The regular ones textures are in the files. They had issues with the face texture and never bothered to finish it. They can be scorched in the lore
---
I love paying to take over a workshop, pimping out defenses and resources only to get disconnected. No cap refunds or rebuilds given. Not to mention getting through a huge interior filled with 30 levels higher enemies just to be disconnected as I'm about to finish and leave. Rads are still fucked, ammo is still used, health is still shit. So literally the potential hours put in for absolutely no fucking reason! LOVE IT!!
---
*sigh my bad*.
---
I meant: i have electric absorb
---
I know the perk works for PA to HEAL.
---
I do not use PA either. I took the perk for testing.
---
I believe it negates the damage still. I don't know but it might have regen. I just wanna know for science. Cant find anyone speaking on it.
---
Edit: post 22 i am tanking assaultron lasers to the face.
---
Three dog* not the dog lmao
---
No worries. Just didn't pick up that perk.
---
Everyone finds it that way.
---
This is a really good analysis. Another interesting fix would be if pistols were much better in terms of AP cost than rifles.
---
I have a bloodied commando and melee mix. My bloodied sledge went from 1200+ to 400-something. The boost from the bloodied attribute itself is now only 70-ish points, so it's barely worth having.
---
I'm thinking about moving more points into commando, and switching to an instigating melee weapon.
---
The other day I tried to melee a daily ops super mutant boss, and it took dozens of swings. The DPS compared to an auto firing weapon is just trash now.
---
I would love to be wrong though, if anybody has any tips!
---
I loved my quad single action...just so useless with the low damage now.
---
I would dearly love to be able to use it again. 
---
ALSO - when they had the sale at momma's the other week I must have bought a hundred weapon rolls, the only explosive ones that ever came up were on single action and western revolvers - and I picked up a few of those.

Blackwater Mine is nothing but Glowing Mole Miners.

AI is handled by the server, or enemies would attack and move differently for everyone, so where it dies is  the same for everyone, which determines where the pile appears when the body disappears.
---
Guyz u are really sad... If I wanna sell my trade only God rolls weapons at 25-30k I'm gonna do it... It may not be cheap but I'm not gonna sell em at 10 caps cause u can't afford em
---
Yeah but what am I supposed to do with hundreds of extra legendary items?  
---
Once you have the weapons and armor and build you want. Everything else is just weight management
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Does the perk do anything outside of PA? Or is it supposed to?
---
I think i have a 2 shot explosive less action point cost western in my stash collecting dust. Too bad pistols are nonviable really at endgame
---
why the armor? and how do i get legendary effects on my pa?
---
I got ~300 with a lv45 jss death tambo, no food buffs other than glowing meat, no chems, and no nerd rage. I used to do ~500 with a bss hachet pre-patch, so I guess it's still a 40% nerf but didn't hit me as bad as it hit those guys already running bsss dcg's with all food buffs, chem buff, etc.
---
That being said, I'm still under the belief that melee is all risk and no reward vs ranged right now. Like why bother when the commando to your side is doing same / more damage and not getting any aggro? Ammo isn't even an issue anymore with daily ops and the new legendary perk.
---
I basically swapped to a melee/shotgun hybrid build for now. Melee for trash mobs. Shoutgun for ops and bossing.
---
If it were me I'd start by buffing one thing at a time and see where that gets us. Like the new brawling chemist drug could be multiplicative again instead of additive. It seems like every mandatory dps perk right now is multiplicative (tenderizer, follow through, take one for the team).
---
For you not a massive nerf
---
And all we get is a photo ?
---
Sorta. They changed how they figure dmg bonuses in the latest patch. Instead of Multiplying each bonus you add then up then multiply. This means if you run a build with several multipliers you should notice a significant decrease in dmg
---
Typically not caps
---
 waiting for microsoft to fix this shit idc
---
I feel you.
---
I still need to get my license. Discovering that handgun hunting is a thing really spiked my interest. That and venison is tasty.
---
65k to 115k on discord. Depends on time of day you post.
---
Its more complicated than that. The way anti armor is applied is odd. If you run tank killer with an anti armor gun, that gun effectively halves the power of tank killer.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
&gt;In terms of per-shot damage, you're right. However, that's the only instance you're right.
---
That's what matters when you go stealth sniper, as the post states. 
---
I have maybe fifteen godroll fixers. Best ones before the update were a furious faster fire and a Bloodied Explosive. After the patch, they require too many shots. Junk? Of course not. But not the best at all.
---
Serious event? Like what? ACP? An instigating lever can tag Earl and kill all wendigos with single headshots, plus cripple the boss repeatedly. Scorched Earth? The same. Daily Ops? No stealth multipliers: bring an instigating lever or railway rifle. Wanna use a vampire fixer just to stay alive? A vampire pipe gun on .38 will do the same job. 
---
I love the weapons you mention. I collected them. They're not Rugal anymore.
---
I really want them to bring old things back to the atop shop! I mean, there are things that don't "fit" in the themes they are using, like, we had raider theme, blood eagle, mothman, now rustic..... I want more "cute" things back lol, like the poodle skirt, the door with flowers, that windchime that is like a red bird, the fishbowl lamp and mr pebbles one... Idk, as a girly girl i feel kinda abandoned lol, i will save my atoms till there's something like that
---
It felt really weak the first couple days but since then it's been OK, maybe legendary perks are helping, but 3-4 hits on the lvl 100 ghouls with an instigating puncturing powerfist isn't terrible
---
Mirelurk queen is the worst with poison. I couldn't find a list or chart so I hit a bunch of threads about poison resistance and got this list. It's probably not 100% accurate.
---
Bloodbug, megasloth (poison spores?), mirelurk kings can have it in their sonic attack, radscorpions, and stingwings.
---
Mirelurks count as glowing creatures... try Pioneer Scout area.
---
With the legendary perks it becomes a god tier weapon for waves of enemies.
---
You and I talking is a waste of my time. Go get some air.
---
I would pay actual atoms for that. Or honestly anything Halloween. I missed the vendor skin and keep hoping they'll bring it back
---
Yep. Anti armor bonuses stack multiplicatively.
---
And yet, you came back ***two days later*** to waste more of your time. 
---
Brilliant!!
---
A friend of mine had this bug happen to him. He just so happened to be streaming on Twitch when it happened. [Here is what OP is describing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3rKInaWNpU). I've had it happen to me as well, it's freaky.
---
Also, if you have the US Government Supply Requisition holotapes to upload, I remember getting prewar money from those
---
I really hope to get more enclave content. Time to show those muties what true 'murica looks like.
---
Someone throw a hallucigen?
---
No, PA only
---
You need to provide evidence you do something besides troll people.
---
Like I read :( suck like this but will make do. Thanks
---
Stupidity must be addressed.
---
Damn..... At least I only cost me 1 perk coin wap waaaaaaa. Also. Cool i get a new slot!
---
Sometimes they get killed but they pop out of the hole they where going to. Take camera out and find it
---
I thought talking to me was a waste of your time?
---
Scorched in the cave next to fissure site prime. Easy to kill, good xp, and more spawn everytime you pull iltracite ore.
---
You can't.
---
I'm on ps4 and xbox. Can people troll but not read?
---
I saw that most people disagreed with this post, but I absolutely agree. I'm a level 25 casual player that doesn't have time to grind for the best of the best gear, I just want to chill around with my friends and play some missions as I would in any other game. But it's just impossible to do that when I go into an area and get swarmed by mosquitos and mutated bugs that take whole pump mags to kill... Anyways, any advices would be highly appreciated, as I have to admit, I'm not exactly a pro when it comes to builds, perks and etc.
---
Yes. The fact that you refuse to produce evidence when everyone here is telling you you’re wrong, and the fact that you claim this is a waste of your time but come back to a two day old conversation... is colossally stupid on your part.
---
Provide some evidence to your claim.
---
When I get off work, I totally am! Thanks for the info! I can’t believe I never saw it in all the hours I’ve spent in game!
---
Sometimes you can really tell who on this subreddit are the kind of people in the wasteland to build huge structures out of garbage because they are mechanical nerds.
---
people will cry if they can't get all the rewards that are rep locked
---
No did not record, was mesmerized watching it disappear.
---
I guess I'll have to see if it returns tomorrow, making sure to stay offline.
---
They are junk if you don’t need caps or mounted head plans. I never played during Christmas being I have 6 kids and a wife and would’ve been murdered if I played during holidays. Lol but one night about feb this year I went to whitesprings and saw a bunch of bags laying around. Some had legendaries and one had 800 large presents. I said damn this is awesome, but they also gave scrip but they stopped doing that. So after you get all the plans they suck. And everyone still sells plans for a bunch. I dropped all of them
---
I've never been lucky enough to find a 2 shot explosive for my "Officer Friendly" character - dressed as a responder state trooper and specialized in pistols and shotguns. For a billy club he uses a bat, for a taser he has a tesla rifle.
---
Finding god roll pistols to use is now my endgame. Even built a police station beside the top of the world that you walk in to right off of the road.
---
My absolute first thoughts were- "Maybe now Microsoft will force them to use a modern engine!" &amp; "Maybe Microsoft will bring up their bug and release standards!"
---
Yes, I understand exclusives. It's still their title they're selling, though. Microsoft is going to have 2 exclusive titles for Playstation, BTW.
---
The only "responsibility" I have in the game is to kill everyone who owns a workshop.
---
gauss pistols do not suck
---
Make a different character and have that one be part of the other faction?
---
I skipped it. The only time I ever had an autocomplete was when I was trying to complete prime cuts right at noon during the last meat week.
---
You're welcome love 💜
---
And I've gotten the caged lamps for the 3rd day in a row lol .
---
After further observation, (and aside from the tato salad bug? feature?) this does seem to be the case.
---
I've found it a couple times at that house next to Slocum's Joe.
---
there would be cry about that too..
---
You know there are people who do use power armor right? So for them, they’re gonna want that specific skin, because it’s a really good looking skin.
---
34k active player base, who regularly spend on in game items and Fo1st subscriptions.
---
The game already sold relatively well at full retail, and further has plenty of new content and I game purchases. They won't shut it down just because you don't like it.
---
You didn’t say you were on PS4 in the main OP. You said it only in a reply to someone else. 
---
How is he trolling you by asking a question?  LOL
---
Actually your best bet might be to get the plan for the gauss minigun using bullion and the legendarymodules and build a bunch till yu get a bloody or junkies one
---
The only people getting nerfed were people running generic, cookie-cutter, glass cannon, bloody builds. 
---
And they were nerfed on purpose. All your bellyaching-qq isn't going to change that.
---
&gt;If nerfing is the only way you can "balance" the game, it may finally be time to move on.
---
If basic balance updates twist your britches so badly, you should move on.
---
Still can't work out (even though that's a board reward).
---
Glowing radroaches in any of the bunkers in the west.
---
Once you have everything you want, you make a new character and start all over. 
---
Once you’ve done that 5 times, you buy a second account and do it all over. 
---
And then... you go outside and marvel at the beauty of the sky and sun
---
I wear PA and I think having PA skin as top tier every time is watering the 'reward' down.  I am thinking the 500 atoms is actually the real top tier reward, but then again they would need to have more COOL things in atom shop to choose from.
---
at this point they are diving in value, considering more and more people are getting them. Right now, they're getting harder and harder to sell. I'd sell it asap.
---
I don’t see a /s... is this serious?
---
Lmao I’m agreeing with you, but isn’t that sacrificing immersion just for that?
---
I adopted dodgy when I realized I had like 28 - 30 agility, after becoming Bloodied Unyielding. 
---
When you combine it with Serendipity, Adrenal Reaction and all those other low health buffs, then, you become tougher than any Vanguard tank. You can even take pylons at Encryptid, fight Earl or run any daily ops without dying once.
---
Like that never comes up for me - is this a triggered event?
---
Yup just one has head down. But I bought bundle and not for the flamingo
---
Well the majority don’t agree
---
That doesn’t mean they’re a beta player
---
If it existed it would probably be the only event where bloodieds couldn't participate.
---
Or at least bloodieds that knows whats good for them. If you're like me you know you aren't doing shit against anyone with a rate of fire over 100.
---
Or a gamma gun.
---
So you want to rate other players, vendors , and camps? Sounds like a new way for trolls to troll.
---
I see people saying that Microsoft won't allow their games to be published on Playstation but I don't think that's the case. Look at minecraft for example, they're still publishing that on multiple platforms, including switch and PS4. I believe Microsoft also acquired Double Fine before they announced which platforms Psychonauts 2 was coming out on. They could have had DF make it an exclusive but it's still being released on multiple platforms.
---
There are cases made where companies have pretty much made nothing but Xbox exclusives since being bought by Microsoft, like Rare, but I don't think that's the case w/ the more recently bought companies.
---
Sniffed it last night for the first time, didn't even know about it til I saw in and investigated to see what it was.
---
I never use builds and it takes me 3-4 shots with a pump to kill a human enemy
---
Thanks, but XB1 here.
---
People don't really know at this point. I tried swapping a AAE Combat Rifle or a Deep Mining Helm for one, no one was interested. Then I got an outfit, and I decided to be cheeky and see if anyone would trade a Legacy for it (as allegedly people will, but I think that's rumor) but again no one was interested. Someone would probably give you a few characters of caps for it but chances of getting a good trade either way have seemed low for me so far.
---
If you didn’t know, why didn’t you say that instead of saying the wrong thing as if it was true?
---
It’s not atomic shop. It’s going to be in mole miner pails.
---
Honestly I've never been totally blown away by any of the offerings in the Atomic Shop. The complete disregard for canon and not offering things that fallout fans want from the franchise seems like a totally bizzare bait-and-switch kind of artistic decision.   
---
We're playing a fallout game, but they are extremely reluctant to sell us things that are iconic to the franchise that we're here to play, and quick to introduce things that make little to no sense in the franchise. It boggles the mind and I genuinely think the people making the decisions for the Atomic Shop do not understand the fanbase.
---
Thats a lot of effort for more scrip.
---
I've honored him in my camp every since fallout 4 and ever single 76 camp I've made has pebbles in it.
---
800 hours and I still haven’t found it, or the undetonated bomb encounter
---
I SAID IT YOUR TURN TO CLEAN UP *thonk*
---
Is it an Atom Shop item?  I played on Xbox at release and stopped before the first update.  Playing again on PC (started right before one wasteland dropped, but that is for another thread) and i have not found it in world or seen it in the shop.
---
Well, I was just hoping to make him quiet really.
---
Big difference between "beta" and "BETA"; or what was essentially just a week of early access.
---
Np good luck
---
I dont remember seeing it back during the mole miner event but maybe I'm wrong. Or is it going to be there next time?
---
Queen doesn't scale. Queen and Earle are fixed level spawns. The random spawns she drop do scale though.
---
Once there's absolutely any benefit to building diversely, sure. As it stands there's really only 2-3 viable builds in the game and not a lot of alternative path options, raiders or dutchess, raider or settlers...and we're done. 
---
I'm not interested in having 20 mules. This does not spark joy.
---
it will be coming with the next treasure hunter event with the mole miners.  
---
But, I believe if people had leftover pails from before, when they updated them it updated the loot pools, so some people may have them already.
---
Do you own the jet pack plan. I know before I bought the plan I had the free states bundle and could put that jet pack on the t65 without knowing the plan but all the other skins I couldn’t until I bought it. Which I ended up doing because I had nothing left to buy with gold that I wanted. Now I will start the grind for strangler heart and the other two armors.
---
I think it depends on your build... stealth commandos have a hard time but if you are a half way decent tank you are perfectly fine
---
It for the up and coming one. There’s also a clown animatronic and some circus strongman stuff too.
---
Me and a buddy did it one time. It’d never work with how PvP is now.
---
Team PvP would’ve been nice. Maybe if we were locked to black powder weapons/melee, it could be good.
---
Patch 22 changes everything about how damage is calculated. It’s not a nerd to explosive. In fact explosive was probably least effected by the change. It’s a nerf to how perks, legendary effects, and mutations stack.
---
isn't one yellow lights, and one pink lights?
---
I thought you got 1 legendary per run and a bonus for the second tier reward ( the 12 minute reward - once a day)
---
Personally I never run pacifist. Unfortunately thats the closest I'll ever get to the feeling survival servers provided.
---
Well, maybe if they use pre-written description they could make it that it comes only after 10 people use the same tag... No trolling allowed that way
---
Agreed! That and the one in The Mire! They're good fun though. Actually got killed by radtoads yesterday.
---
Gotta ask though, what do you have thats worth more than either? Id say keep both.
---
You can via trade, they were spawned months ago, but they are worth a legacy each piece. Of course legacies have no value on PC, so it is very cheap
---
So, I was out randomly and came across a player's tent but it had extra stuff inside it. Is this an add-on or is there different tents you can buy?
---
Well they generally have like 3-4 standard armor piece skins for each single PA skin so it's pretty diverse as is.
---
What perk?
---
The TS with demo expert is probably similar enough in dmg to the BE. Maybe even better if it acts like a true tse does in terms of the explosive damage.
---
"B... B... But my bloodied explosive pistol kills things in less than 50 bullets so its fine!"
---
Pistols should be close to rifles with damage, but have less range or something.
---
OR
---
Give them a higher sneak multiplier.
---
pipe = life
---
That’s how I feel about the in game content. It’s not more stuff to do if they just give more rewards and a time pressure for the “missions”  that was already there.
---
I'd be surprised if they didn't! They did bring back the Christmas one (and I'm pretty sure the Halloween one too) several weeks ago. They were in the shop for one day each, if memory serves. Kinda like a flash sale type of thing.
---
Yeah. I noticed.
---
If you are on Ps4 i can give you tenderizer plan for it
---
thats from the companion quest
---
Well, it crashes more often, thats for sure...
---
Deliverer is basically a real world pistol, the walther PPK. they could definitely bring it back, just name it something like the pocket pistol and chamber it in a smaller round
---
All my bloodied weapons stopped being awesome, so I replaced them with antiarmor, instigating, two shot... And VAMPIRE, which means Daily Ops with unlimited ammo and health.
---
There have been limited time skins in the past, maybe available as the free monthly gift for that time period (I'm guessing). I haven't seen any come out since May this year when I started playing, so it's been at least that long since they've given FO1st subs a new tent skin.
---
Junkies is incredibly low risk. Especially compared to bloodied.
---
I almost solo'd the bog yesterday.....had 2 people bail on me on first attempt.  Second,  I stuck to it. Finished about 30  seconds too late.  Wish more players would go the Bog when its up, its a helluva challenge and the XP gain is huge!
---
Maybe one-day.
---
I keep getting that bug, usually 2 or 3 times in a row. Every time I log in or server hop. It's annoying. I don't like having to time me looking at my map with the fast progress bar filling up. 
---
At least the notification is smaller this season...
---
I think most people will spend that atom ranking up on the scoreboard, and I have a hunch that some might be more inclined to buy more atoms to skip the grind or ensure that they reach rank 100.
---
yet they keep hunter hunter which i've never seen happen since beta
---
Yes but it still has downsides that need to be mitigated, unlike AA which has none. Of course Bloodied is a lot riskier.
---
Interesting info!
---
Of course I missed it 😭 I didn't have wifi in my new apartment for like 3 months so I missed a lot lol
---
yeah - if it was just visual it would be one thing, but for several minutes at a time, several times per night I'm forced to time it just right if I want to actually get to my map because it's just popping up with the score screen otherwise
---
I can see vendor hopping for bobbles and the last few plans i need, but I already have more than two days worth of 150 scrip trash legends in my stash, so I think most people, who are doing the numbers of events like OP here to be at max caps, has no need to buy legends to scrip.  Hey, maybe Smiley can sell a few hundred scrip for caps every week too....
---
OG fallout had you learn how to beat a hyper intelligent radscorpion at chess from a sentient talking plant, and you're calling a flamingo with Christmas lights wrapped around it too wacky?
---
Ive gotten 2 legendaries in my rewards for repeatable. Loot table says 1-3 Murmgh picks repeatable. Theres also 1-3 murmgh picks for a reward tier too.
---
Jetpack, just to try something different. 
---
In terms of performance, well, not a big difference. 
---
You might want to make a set of SS and a legendary effect, like, a full set of Assassin's SS, or a full set of Troubleshooters SS, etc. Otherwise...
---
Oh no!! 😥 I hope you have another chance at it!
---
You can't trade them, it would be pointless keeping both.
---
What lore? Supermutants can’t become scorched, why would behemoths?
---
This is also the best time for the drop I got in daily ops yesterday too. Anti armor/FFR/FR Handmade.....
---
The best part of this season is all the military style structures we get. I have plans to make a large military ops base.
---
Again: how often do these situations occur?
---
There really should be events like this monthly, be it meat wwek, or fasnacht
---
tell it to the paddle ball
---
Hopefully we see the mannequins in the shop next week. I really want to display my outfits
---
War glaive is a different story. That’s the one of the most strongest melee weapon, even non legendary.
---
I mean, Nukes are still dropping, world is in shambles, what did you expect!
---
Pretty good pull shot animations
---
Bloodied damage out does ts 100%. Yes the gap closed but bloodied is still top of the pile.
---
You think that's bad, my primed BE gatling gun used to do over 800+ damage, now it does a little over 400. It's basically a non primed non explosive pre nerf bloodied one.
---
My buddy wanted to make a viable pistol build. Think he made a "Robocop" build. Power armor and pistols build lol.
---
Youre not taking into consideration balance changes. Whats good/bad now is not permanent
---
&gt;melee is all risk
---
What risk? If your plan is to wade into melee range and then not take any damage, you've got a shitty plan that needs to be reconsidered.
---
Basically a god tier weapon. Nice drop.
---
I noticed when I load up the game if it says I'm rank 1/1  on the main menu, then it will do this glitch if I rank up during that session. I tried opening the run board before loading into a world because some people have said that will fix it, but it didn't save me from seeing it flash each level when I ranked up.
---
Here is the thing. All weapons, perks and legendary perks need rebalanced. Let’s hope the damage recalculation was the beginning of that.
---
Why some ppl cant see that being trolled by RNG is simply put a part of game mechanics?  
---
Just chill
---
welcome to the internet..
---
And guerrilla too. Imo pistols could do with more damage
---
There’s not *too* many instanced spaces like this, fortunately...
---
In fallout 2, they're over half the game it feels like lol
---
As a serious counter argument:  how often does the wacky stuff actually occur in the actual gameplay/events/quests?
---
There was a cigar shop/news stand near my house in Queens that had every magazine imaginable.  I remember seeing it.  I used to go there with my allowance and buy Thrasher every month, and of course try to peek into the back room for a glimpse at the trove of nudie mags.
---
TLDR: Yes, you could buy a magazine called Mountain Man in New York City.
---
Someone is a bit sensitive
---
I do, but I never actually played it
---
Thats not the issue the issue is the respawn timer also known as the timeout corner
---
Daily ops yielded ab rounds for me. 
---
Daily ops gives alien blaster rounds yall let it be known!
---
Western Revolver is best revolver
---
Complete opposite of my experience. Hope you find a happy place elsewhere.
---
You know you’re proving his point.
---
If anything, what they should do is rename it “Tarnished Alien Blaster” or something like that. Then add the aliens that have been in the files for so long, and allow us to get a proper blaster off of them.
---
Pipe is Life.
---
Earl may not. Ops def did for me
---
If you happen to play on PC you can use this mode to replace the ash piles with the orange duffel bags from Nuclear Winter:
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/480](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/480)
---
Yes. Lots of items are too expensive for caps to be an appropriate method of payment.   
---
When you're talking about using three mules to transfer caps to 3 different mules....risk  is too great on either side.
---
I personally disagree with the 100% chance because honestly getting Elder tier is really easy. But I do think you should be able to re-roll (i.e. replay the event to get Elder tier) until you get your rare reward for the day.
---
Friends list is notoriously buggy. I’ll try adding you now. IGN?
---
Damn 👍🏻
---
Also got me the War Glaive, finally, on the one toon that could use it.. (my other commando bloodied both have it already..)

You have to finish Rose's questline to turn those in right?
---
Gah I never seem to have all of the ingredients at the same time to install her special syringe gun mod, I'm always short something different each time I remember to check haha
---
Troll #1
---
Secret service armor is the highest stat armor in the game, by FAR. 
---
But.
---
It costs modules to craft, and can’t be traded.
---
So getting a set with the effects you want? Could be hundreds of modules just to get a set with the primary effects you want; thousands to even come close to the second and third effects you want.
---
Troll #2
---
No, there's only an 80% chance of a rare drop so sometimes youbdont get one.
---
often i will put one or 2 in a train station suitcases cuz i know it is a high traffic area, and someone will appreciate the easy find.
---
I believe you only have a chance at rare rewards once per completion rank.  So if you get elder first time, all three chances roll.  If you get no reward, that's your lot for the day.
---
Crossplay with pc and its aimbots and hacking, no thanks!
---
No I don't believe so. I haven't gotten any so far and I do it every day so it's just your turn for a bad roll I guess.
---
I'm not a "gay basher" I'm actually more friendly in fo76 then I am irl just saying 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
---
SS Chest is BIS because of the jetpack.
---
They can. Super mutants can't become scorched because the devs were too lazy to hook it up and probably didn't have Scorched Supermutant voice acting done either, so they brushed it aside.
---
It's not lore that regular Supermutant can't be scorched. Every other FEV creature can be scorched.
---
Not a bad theory.
---
I appreciate that. I'm done.
---
I’m a troll for sticking up for you?
---
No. One chance per day. Regardless of how good or bad your daily roll was.
---
Nah Dawg between consoles
---
Does fast traveling fix it?
---
How much for the spoon it’s what I need to go with my fork n knife for a legendary dinner set to get the +.05% bonus to my food bar
---
Im about to go farm them, sucks it has to be this way but its better than nothing. Completing Dageurres questline should teach you how to make the ammo when she gives you the vats unknown :/
---
I'm a dolt. I thought IGN was part of your name. I just sent you a request.
---
I believe the microsoft game pass version should be cross platform but still connect into xbox servers only
---
I have never wanted an atom shop item more. Sing in kaynebot
---
hey, i would be down to play with you. i'm on steam, my steam id is just destro, my fallout ID is 'oxdestroxo'
---
Look at your own language. You can't even admit straight up that sniping is better than semi rifle.
---
&gt;The lever at least can one hit if you max adren and chems/bock help too.
---
How about without all these extra caveats. 
---
I don't say what I do out of ignorance. I was pitting like for like, 1* bloodied lever VS 1* combat rifle with an old alt that was a food rifleman. The combat rifle handily outperformed anything you couldn't 1-2 shot with the lever ie most creatures. 
---
The only area the lever did better was easy squishy mobs. Pit it against tankier targets like robots, super mutants, yao guais etc. and it wasn't even close. Obviously nowhere near as good as commando version but it was leagues above the sniping weapon. 
---
Do the test yourself &amp; see.
---
The easy solution is to stop rewarding cheaters at every step of the way. But since they are adamantly refusing to do so, this is the second best alternative in their position
---
Where’s the lore that they CAN be scorched? Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. 
---
This sounds like a lot of speculation and assumption on your part.
---
What are "unbreakable"?
---
Agreed. I dig the space aspects of fallout. Not enuf love
---
Oh okay, you didn't specify so I just assumed you were on Xbox.
---
He's blinded by rage atm, all he sees is trolls everywhere lol
---
Not noticing anything different on PC.
---
Am not saying his wrong but he doesn't have to make this post. Toxic people love these type of posts and encourages them to do more hate speech. He should make a formal complaint to Bethesda with proof
---
I tried earlier on, had to log out of my ps twice and then it would only let me in a private server without booting me back out again, eventually a public server actually worked.
---
lead is a little harder to get, I always used to buy it at vendors when I could, private server helps too that way you can just look up lead locations on youtube and just hop from one to the other and not worry about other people already grabbing it.  Anytime you see weight benches you can grab those weights and barbells, they are heavy but so is lead I guess
---
Not normally
---
Pistols need a buff
---
If you have pacifist off and the legendary card taking one for the team someone can kill you without you shooting back.
---
Turn on pacifist, problem solved.
---
Im glad they're showing it a little bit of love at least and it's not completely useless
---
Clearly. I was going to send him a message saying he can play with me and my husband and that we’ve got a couple other gays were playing with. But no way.
---
It isn’t guaranteed you’ll get one everytime.
---
80% chance for a rare drop doesn't see too "rare" haha
---
I think Fireproof is the single best damage reduction perk available. I ignore scorchbeast sonic attacks, punch cars to make them explode and just laugh at the flames.
---
i got the worst rare drop ever, plans to the vault 79 stash box. what a joke. I already had the plans from elsewhere. stashbox plans really bethesda for a rare drop????
---
This post sounds like it has quite a backstory lol
---
Nice!
---
Why did you label this as "BUG" and then not tell the part that's bugged?
---
Have you learned everything? Serum, power armor, furniture, weapons, Grahm? Armor mods? Weapon mods? 
---
I have been learning all power armor mods, even when I don't use it.
---
Because a rational human being is going to spend that much, right? 🤣 Gtfo
---
You unlock the ability to craft ammo when you get the plan to make its respective receiver. You just need the flux to make them and normal bullet crafting materials (gun powder, lead, etc.).
---
If you don’t have flux, you can do a Daily Ops and have the weapon out and scavenge ammo from dead corpses your teammates leave behind, as they will provide Ultracite ammo just so long as the weapon is out. You can eventually stock pile enough to be able to go over 999+, as I did with my Ultracite pump action, having no ammo at first then getting over 1000 Ultracite shells just by scavenging from dead bodies.
---
I haven't been there in a while, I've been meaning to go but I'm a little scared because of the enemy leveling with the blood eagles in there.
---
Edit: or mothman cultists,I forget
---
Why wouldn't you sniff it? Pipe is life.
---
They overhauled the rewards for it.
---
I cant stress how good blackwater mine is for glowing creature hunting.
---
These forums are very tough unless you have a very thick skin.
---
I don't think so. I got a Ultracite Laser Pistol Legendary months ago. It's a trophy mainly  b/c that char isn't a Pistol build and I'm not going to spend levels to respec for one weapon and the massive grinding for ammo that is needed.
---
Where's the evidence that they *can't be*?
---
the only evidence that they can't is what I said above. The counterpoint to that is that there are textures literally called Scorched Supermutant in the game files. If big Supermutant can be scorched and Supermutant don't exhibit any physiological degradation from aging, then it is literally impossible for regular supermutants to be immune to scorched plague.
---
We collect a feral ghoul blood sample for the inoculation, not a supermutant sample
---
I’ll try that next time
---
Aww that's so wholesome 
---
Same here actually,  only with my wife and without the gay friends sadly, then I saw his reply to your post and pffft haha
---
Ah well
---
I’m sorry you’ve had a terrible experience, I assure you not everyone is like this.  If you see something, say something.  Make sure to document and report people who harass and abuse online/ follow up with it.  It’s a shame some cowards use FO76 in this way.
---
That was the last good bundle I can remember. Lots of good stuff in that one.
---
Well yeah, what they want is people to get First and pay to skip on the board, Instead of getting First and only spending those atoms in the shop. And I'm sure enough people are doing that because they actually made it easier this time. So from their perspective they are getting more money out of their paying players which is good. But from a paying players perspective you're paying more to get less, which is not good.
---
My bad, so used to the typically bashing. I'm deleting my account today. Only been a member for a couple months and the reddit demographic is full of terrible people! Everyone's getting "karma" when true karma is the exact opposite. There's so many god awful people on here saying terrible things, all for upvotes and ... Karma? What jackass decided to name an upvote karma? I get the use of the word trolling now... people that do it are so fking ugly.
---
By chance was this during Primal Cuts?
---
He’s not wrong. But he’s kind of being like those he’s mad at.
---
Im gonna say 50-50. Tjey still gonna have to give more love to shotguns (outta vats) pistols, semis, and unarmed.
---
This ner- "damage recalculation" adversely affects the 20% bell curve or diverse [non-meta] builds and needs attention.
---
Ill grant you unarmed former 1 shots were too much but the pendulum swing is hurting out ammo economy a llittle.
---
Tl:dr fix less op builds also
---
Triggered.....
---
I have typically only good experiences in FO76. I'm sorry this shit happens! It never should but please l, even if just for a future reference, don't let minimal idiots/pricks actions define how most people are.
---
Well if it sells, then yes.
---
for a high lv char like mine, it has gotten easier or maybe faster to lvl now because of more exps from mobs.
---
Damn, think my best is 502 burning mine, cloaked, blood egals
---
I'm not even gay and I've been called a f***** so many times just for having my Legendary Run power armor on a month before it was over. It's sick how people can say those things through text but they would never dare say anything so despicable in person. This Reddit culture is disgusting.
---
Aww man I miss Rare... Perfect Dark was my favorite
---
No bug, just your typical Fallout 76 RNG. 
---
I regularly solo these OPs with the Elder rank and not even that guarantees you anything.
---
It's not that bad, really, the OPs are not a limited time thing.
---
what is the rad emitter and symptomatic??????
---
Yeah I've seen both the goods and bads of this community believe me, so I do get it
---
But honestly he's raging so bad I don't even know if he's serious or this is some kind of double troll or something haha
---
70 pounds of pre war money would be several thousand at least. There are 2 workbenches at the event too so you can just scrap it there
---
Then again we have nuclear bomb launchers that have less DPS than rifles.
---
The headline made me think it was going to be about me. Thankfully it's not.
---
Valley Galleria has a bunch of cash registers in their stores which have pre-war money in them, as well as some money stashed behind the counters on shelves sometimes.
---
Many of the stores have safes hidden on the floor or walls as well, most contain a fair bit of pre-war money.
---
Idc about not taking any damage. I'm fine with taking damage. The point is that if I'm in more danger of taking damage as a melee build then there needs to be a buff to reflect that cause ranged does the same/more damage without taking that same risk. Or if not damage buffs, then some perk changes here and there to get away from sneak melee and promote a healthy tank aggro melee build that can help in boss fights and not be a hindrance. The question to ask ourselves is why bother playing melee of any kind in this game (unless roleplaying) when ranged outputs more with less effort?
---
who is graham?
---
This is why they won't pay haha. We do it for free!
---
The karma and downvoting mean nothing. Karma is literally worthless on here. 
---
I get told how much I’m going to get downvoted for my views. I ignore it. Someone us threatening me with unpopularity on the internet? A stranger?
---
Not going to worry about it.
---
I agree with this, I've been wanting to do a shotgun build for a while but it's too underpowered
---
Fallout 76 has many, many issues. But the one thing almost everyone agrees on is how awesome 95% of the community is. It’s the best most agreeable community out there, especially considering everything that’s happened with the game. There’s a few bad apples in every bunch, but that’s life. I love the community in 76 just as it is. Good luck out there finding another nicer community!
---
As a bloodied build I really like the rad resistance it adds, hardly ever pop radshields now.
---
Thank you very much, I have both of those. I’ve now turned pacifist on
---
You sound completely awful, like someone who finds an insult in a bouquet of roses.
---
I’ve been him in the past. You just shoot off at everyone sometimes when your that angry.
---
How? I play for like six hours every day doing ops and events and I’m lucky if I get 1000 caps
---
Grunsday. Just fill out the pay ticket for hours worked and submit.
---
Downvote and fear mathematics. The perk is bad on your build because you aren't building around it.
---
Jesse what the fuck are you talking about
---
Bye! Around here we like things to stay positive and supportive. So... feel free to leave whenever, troll.
---
Anyone know the usual drop amounts? I started using 5mm Ultricite after I saw how much the ops were dropping for my brother. Like, how much .50 cal Ultricite? Is it comparable to the 5mm drop amounts?
---
With a full unyielding set sneak perks are not really needed, they may help a little, but you are sneaky as crap w/o them.  Escape artist still important for breaking contact.
---
Do you think it's worth getting the legendary perk for poison resistance for those?   Thanks for looking it up.
---
Are you on PC?  I'd love to have them.
---
Holy quadruple post, batman.
---
Nah they should be like 5k-8k by now. Check a trading sub, post that you want one and have caps
---
My dads friend Vick Hinds was on the cover of it once .
---
NOOOOOOOOOOO I WONT BE ABLE TO WASTE MY LIFE AWAY GRINDING IN A HALF ASSED MMO GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????????????????????????
---
HOW COULD THIS BE HAPPENING TO ME NOT THE FALLOUT 76 TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
What a rush eh?
---
It should be being sold for less than 10k.  It's not a rare enough drop to be sold that high.
---
If it makes you feel any better, downvotes aren't just people being mean for the sake of being mean
---
They are also for things that don't relate to a discussion and stuff like that
---
So in this case people may be downvoting you because they don't think it warrants discussion in a fo76 subreddit 
---
That sounds harsher than what I mean it to say haha I'm sorry 
---
Basically never take downvotes personally, even though some people use it like a "Like and dislike" system that's not what it's supposed to be
---
It's just how the site figures out what to make the front page posts and stuff
---
They are giving better rewards this time and not the stupid mounted heads. So ppl had pails so they got rewards early
---
Currently no, there isn't.
---
Wouldn't it make sense to have the pistol perks in perception as well, since you'd need a better perception ability to, for example, hit weak spots with a pistol vs a scoped rifle? 🤔
---
bruh, dafuq are you actually speaking  ??
---
Burning mine is the easiest in terms of distances
---
oh okay ty
---
I mean, if Obsidian made another fo game as good as they have in the past I'd be happy.
---
It doesn't roll from the table if you complete the same op over and over that day.
---
Yup I'm guilty of that even still to this day, it can be hard not to
---
fallout 76 shitter doesnt even know who Obsidian are
---
lol gtfo back to fortnight kid
---
I got one for 5k caps and I thought that was alot
---
* if it's on reddit, take a screeny and complain to the admins, if the mods don't do anything.
---
* if it's beth's voice chat, file a complaint with beth, they are quite quick with banning those assholes.
---
* if it's on sony's chat system, take it up with them
---
That said, I can't remember when a bashing post was left standing and unsanctioned for more than a few minutes.
---
Anyways, I can't say I'm sorry to see you go, because people that generalize like you do in your post are overly toxic themselves, and shit like that is cancer and needs to be excised.
---
Reddit seems to disagree lol
---
It's BiS without it too.
---
No prob. Don't pay too much.
---
&gt;get away from sneak melee
---
Then stop doing it. 
---
The real problem you've addressed is that the game doesn't have ANY tanking perks or abilities. There's nothing built around keeping agro on one person. There's a few around reducing enemy damage output; but they're unnecessary as almost no enemies in the game do enough damage to be actually dangerous to someone paying attention.
---
DAE NEW VEGAS GOOD GUYS
---
I haven’t jumped on since before the update, how do the weapons feel? I uninstalled it to make room for something else but have been curious how it’s going so far?
---
Are you saying too many wendigos spawn? I'm not clear on what you're talking about.
---
I can say that last night with playing drums, dropping off 1 or 2 wood portions and 1 or 2 chally feeds, my husband got 2 tenderizer plans in 5 meat cooks.   So maybe a variety of tasks helps the rng a little, but I think there was an old song, I'd rather be lucky than good? 🤠
---
So that stacked with blocker should be enough? I seemed to be hurt more often by normal gunfire than fire/explosion damage
---
Should I bother to say there's no lootboxes here?
---
Nah, just a spammer.
---
Sorry bud Xbox we really need a cross platform auction house. Or summit
---
Lmao "be positive or gtfo out troll" 
---
yes that is correct
---
I wonder why they took a beloved overpowered but limited weapon and made it objectively terrible
---
You can place two doors facing either way, then edit the door pieces and replace them with regular walls or windows. The inside side will show on both sides, and you can put your wallpaper on to mimic an interior wall.
---
Buy all the junk from robot vendors.
---
I once caught my turrets shooting my stash box and personal terminal. I don't think any damage was being done though.
---
Yes...you make the wall a doorway, add another doorway but turn it around so the opposite side is showing, snap them together and then you can edit them both to regular walls. Then you can put wallpaper on them. Search for a video, it's not that complicated though.
---
You need one of the base hame prime plans to craft the ammo.
---
Ie: gold bullion prime plans are/were bugged to not unlock the ultracite crafting.
---
Just farm ammo for it on daily ops if you can't craft it. As long as the enemy dies while you have the primed gun equipped, it will drop that ammo
---
Damn, thanks. This app has issues.
---
I was just throwing a joke haha. 80% for a rare item doesn't seem to make it really rare anymore haha!
---
There would be way more benefits than negatives
---
"It's a major award" 😂😂
---
I end up doing vats and shooting grenades and screwing team mates throws up by doing that
---
The problem with magic guns (certain shotty/heavies) and their non magic counterparts is:
---
Impossibly unequal in all ways. But. The new damage ner f (fuck it it's what it is) is good because it will be augmented as things progress. Im just doing me till it gets diverse then imma be a motherfucking caravan :D
---
I only know what I charge--fluxes are 250, radshield 50, bobbleheads 50-100 depending on type, and keycards 400.
---
These values were derived from watching how quickly an item sold once Iogged in, and how they were purchased. Bobbles go steadily all the time, while fluxes and cards will sit a bit, but when they start going, they go fast.
---
They may not reflect "the going rate," just what works for me.
---
What about cookers instead of pure
---
If I get too many stimpaks and junk aid I sell them too. I use unyielding for bloodied so my charisma and barter rates get higher. Rather sell the junk than drop it
---
That's damn good.
---
That was so sweet.
---
Listen. If your making choices in life because of people like this.
---
Then you’re letting them make the choices for you. Your letting them say who can or can’t belong.
---
That thing needs at least a 300% to be considered for trash mobs.
---
Man, exact same thing happened to me just a couple hours ago!!  Was about to take the prime boss down and then got killed.  I respawn nearby and start trucking it back to finish him off and grab a TON of loot that I dropped.  Halfway there a message pops up saying "Another player has taken your loot".  Like wtf man?!  You show up at the last second AND have the nerve to heist all my loot!!  Oh, and the sob didn't even finish off the boss.  Arghhh
---
wtf, how old are you? And how disconnected from everybody are you also? Fortnight? What in the ass is fort NIGHT? You mean fortnite? I barely play fallout 76 anymore btw, I'm more of a rainbow six siege person :3
---
Every single one of these plans will be as worthless as the mounted heads by mid October
---
You have no proof that the reports aren't posted to /dev/null, as evidence suggests. So why would you get anything for something they never see?
---
This, also two shot is so woefully innacurate you literally have to on top of something to get all the hits in.
---
See this is what I’m going to do. Being I switched build around two months ago for a bloodied commando being purveyor sweet ass gave me my first bloodied fixer. I use to have 8 I. Charisma and switched it to 1. But my perception was 14 and I picked the legendary perception and plan on making out and moving those points to charisma. So I don’t care if charisma doesn’t do it. Being I was warned before I picked mine and knew not to.
---
They are lvl 5.  They cannot break or rarely break.  They have a fire rate comparable to a minigun and have 797 range. 
---
They could be made for a few weeks a few months back.
---
Drop ammounts very from kill to kill. I've seen drops as low as 8, and as high as 32.
---
However, it should be noted that it seems that the best way to farm these bullets is with higher DPS weapons, NOT higher fire speed weapons. I went in to farm with a prime light machine gun, and ran out pretty quickly.
---
It would therefor seem that the best weapons to use to farm in the Daily Ops are weapons with a higher DPS, as you are using less bullets to kill your target.
---
It should also be noted that Fule seems to be a good medium, as I frequently find myself able to farm it pretty reliably while doing Daily Ops.
---
People can criticize the game all they want, but coming onto this subreddit to berate the entire fo76 player base is just asinine, especially when I see 5 posts a day commending that same player base for being kind, generous, and caring! If he wants to make a point, call people out by name, show footage, or just report them to Bethesda. His post was untrue and if he’s that blinded by rage, then yeah; he can leave.
---
well i have 22 hp so dying to every enemy isnt fun
---
once
---
No, I mean that people are paying that much for an item that is still currently available.  The Spec Ops aren’t going anywhere so it’s very odd to me that people are paying that much.
---
Plans: Burrow Signs
---
Enough? You can always have more Damage Reduction. I also use Adamantium Skeleton 3 to ignore limb damage
---
When it comes to taking sustained gunfire, your best ally is positioning. If you're getting shot a lot, put cover between you and the enemy.
---
And breaks faster
---
Oh! So a mess up by bethesda haha!
---
Judging, insulting and vilifying a whole community based on the actions of some bad apples is the truest road to intolerance and hatred. You sound like you've been hurt, but you're better than that. Don't become the very same type of person that caused you pain, rise above those assholes.
---
As someone who wouldn't do such things, it is hurtful to be lumped in the same bag. For real, don't take that path, be better than those that hurt you.
---
I kind of have the same situation, I have a Bloodied LD Gauss Minigun and  Two Shot (Explosive) RW Gauss Minigun and I know the Bloodied shows better damage numbers but I always seem to go with the Two Shot it seems to do better on SBQ and Earle Williams for some reason...
---
If you are on PC, look on nexus for the "obsolete" fast exit mod.
---
I think the main broken thing is lack of ammo. At higher levels, there's a lot of access to easy ammo through ACP and Daily Ops that isn't there for lower levels. I hate using up all my 45s on one encounter only to get a few shotgun shells in return and being out of options when the next enemies show up. 
---
If we just had a ton of contextual ammo drops all the time, I think that would go a long way.
---
the cartoon fortnight game. I dont play it myself, I only play games from early 2000s these days.
---
What build are you? A rifle man? You know you can turn the pistol into a rifle, right? I mean even then it’s still a pain since the rarity of Ultracite Laser weapons make it difficult to get attachments, but it’s still possible to make it an automatic rifle or semiautomatic.
---
I misunderstood you - my apologies.  
---
People want them right now and will pay. The cost of these plans are already going down significantly and will continue to drop with availability.
---
Lol get rekt
---
Not sure if any one has told you but I feel this is needed for you...Meth is bad, please seek help.
---
outside of daily ops, sneak is a very useful tool, but if you want to just run in and shoot stuff with a heavy gun, try this: [build](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#Aw4DCAICBw0BAQELAQkKDA0PEAIDBQYqQAV3A/ABA0gDxAEDEAG1AQM7A4ABA34DmAEDggEFmQED8QEDwgEBkgEDUQM2AhgBWQHVAQE3BVEBBlECB1EDCmUBC2UCDGUDDWgBDmgCD2gDEHcBEXcCEncDE7cBARS1AQEVtQECFrUBAxehAQEYoQECGaEBAxroAQEb6AECHOgBAx42AR82AiCCAQEhggECIoIBAyOCAQQkggEFJsIBASeSAQEokgECKZIBAyoYASvwAQEs8AECLaIBAS7xAQEv8QECMPEBAzFAATLVAQEzWQE08AEDNcQBATbEAQI3xAEDOKIBAjmiAQM6PwE7PwI8PwM9gwEBPoMBAj+DAQM=)
---
try getting a vampire 50 cal to stay alive, this build will make you pretty tanky.
---
not an ideal build by any means, but should work.
---
10k and below
---
I remember seeing this video explaining how to navigate the burrows for daily Ops: https://youtu.be/GZVy9b24mnY
---
That’s the same that I payed. I’ve been wearing it for weeks so I think I got my money’s worth.
---
I had been wondering, like I said in a previous post my bloodied has better damage numbers but the two shot just kills enemies quicker it seems like
---
Yeah every single time I try to do the primal cuts the past couple days the game just up and freezes. I have to restart fo76 to get back in. Really frustrating.
---
They must have removed that from the game 15 minutes after launch.   I have been playing since B.E.T.A. and I don't remember playing it a single time. I don't even remember seeing it.
---
Wait, where were you ‘gay bashed’?  That’s completely unacceptable.  
---
It’s one thing to think someone is wrong for their opinion about a game. But to make it about their personal lives?  That’s completely unacceptable.
---
Or they go the T65 route and make it a gold bullion offering.
---
Server hop for the queen , she rewards a lot of that
---
Preveyor drop
---
As far as i know , Diamond is Unbreakable
---
If you’re uk it’s 5pm!
---
Two manning or 3 manning best has been in the 6 minute range.
---
Rad emitter gives you rads at your camp, you can turn it on and off, great for bloodied.
---
The symptomatic is a disease cure at your camp
---
Don’t look at the numbers in the pip boy or even the numbers on display from hits. Look at how fast you kill things and how fast far the actual mob health bar goes down with the same number of shots. Only way to compare. The numbers in this game can lie and don’t add up to the reality of actual damage dealt.
---
Swan makes a good target for damage testing.
---
There is some interesting things happening with TS and explosive that lead to it outperforming other legendaries. Angry turtle had a nice vid showing that a TSE heavy weapon did  way better than A BE on the pts.
---
I also have that. And yes I die more then before. But I’m just wondering. Are you wanting the numbers to be outrageous like they where or you just want it buffed a little. I mean with no perks I two hit most enemies with my melee. So if you use perks you should still one hit them. And really there isn’t any consequences to dying unless you’re trying to do Earle solo or queen solo. I am a bloodied stealth commando so I took a damage hit too. And like you said I die more but it’s fun to me to be more cautious of what to do. I also just spent a bunch switching my build only a month before the nerf. And I still believe it was needed. So now when I go in and fight Earle and say you where there you couldn’t one hit or two hit him. Idk, again not trying to be a dick so Hope you don’t take it that way. Just trying to figure what you want it to go to.
---
That’s why it’s great while leveling but I pretty much don’t use it all anymore now that I constantly get glowing meat
---
Is this a build you already had that you are adding the perks to? Because you need to copy the web address again and use that one to reload it.
---
I guess that makes sense. 
---
I’ve personally never seen the appeal of buying a rare outfit from another player. I’d rather acquire it on my own.
---
Glowing mass, hardened mass, and high radiation fluids all have a purpose.  Is ionized meat good for anything?
---
Sorry I’m on Xbox
---
Pipe is meth.
---
I will try to find something. Thank you.
---
Hey now, there's the bayonet for the BP rifle. Given the reload speed, a legendary black powder rifle with increased bash damage and the bayonet might the most viable use - just hit people with it.
---
I did play around with the black powder weapons with the Trail Fireworks fast reload bug - still not good enough.
---
Sometimes I am able to get it to stop if I play a instrument and get well tuned - how or why I don’t know but it’s fricken annoying
---
It's definitely getting faster as I get used to the locales and know exactly where the points are. Less time looking around and getting lost.
---
250 atoms.
---
This is beyond ridiculous. I did an event yesterday on a hillside deep in the swamp woods with tons of foliage and trees around and I killed three legendary level 100 mole rats it wasn't able to find a single corpse
---
Well, its better than investing in damage resintance perks. But with blocker you basically ignore melee damage and with fireproof you basically ignore all fire damage(explotions, scorchbeast sonic attacks and probably more). There is no reduction perks for non fire ranged so you will be vulnerable there. But they are very effective.
---
To be honest, I will be undercutting these prices as im not concerned about caps. I mostly didnt want to go too high. However making some caps while I farm isnt a bad idea. I appreciate the info.
---
You're a prince!
---
This is true. However I feel that like every other build rpg style game glass cannon is going to always be top of the heap as far as damage goes.
---
or at least give us a f****** compass marker so we can know the general area where to search just like when we lose our junk items?
---
You say God roll &amp; furious in the same breath? Really? Even with ffr that's laughable.
---
&gt;Serious event? Like what? ACP? An instigating lever can tag Earl and kill all wendigos with single headshots, plus cripple the boss repeatedly. Scorched Earth?
---
I've seen how snipers perform during these events post patch. Utterly useless. Their kill rate is too slow to keep wendigos or scorched mobs off the hard carries &amp; most of their time is spent repositioning because they can't take on more than a couple of basic creatures at a time. They're basically a more socially acceptable telsa user whose there purely to tag.
---
I can't speak to ISS or RR post patch with these guys but I imagine much the same. Maybe slightly better with RR as ghouls are squisher  &amp; you have a perch outside of melee range but again still dead weight in terms of event completion.
---
Man I still have my high rise and that was the weapon I used for almost a year and a half until I got a bloodied grog axe to drop. Then switched to that, but I still have that and brings so many memories. I never see anyone post about it
---
I'm not sure I'd even call the Gauss pistol the best, it doesn't even have a Long Barrel mod so it sucks at range, especially against SBs. My favourite is a Bloodied/FFR/Less Vats Plasma Pistol. Good fire rate even in semi auto, good damage, 230 range with Sniper Barrel and 15 cells in the mag. But that's with a great legendary roll. Pistols just don't measure up otherwise. I'd say there isn't even a "best" pistol, even though that doesn't make sense. They're all just not good
---
Sorry about that.
---
Normally I drop treasure maps but I'll be sure to hold onto them and sell them in bulk.
---
the threshold is debatable because honestly you could go up to 700, but 350-450 is generally a safe bet. I just cannot recommend ironclad, 99% of the time those 5 points would be better spent elsewhere. like lifegiver (and class freak if you have the adrenal reaction mutation). if you really feel like you need the extra dr/er, use evasive instead.
---
your ap gets depleted pretty fast if you're face tanking enemies, yes. I have a build that can generally kill stuff faster than they can drain my ap, but if that's not the case then you won't have any left for vats. just keep in mind that DB is bugged and dealing 'magic' damage. so once they fix magic weapons, it won't be any good.
---
the railway is not bad as a semi auto (rifleman) and you can aim down sights like that. but the problem is that your dps is gonna drop massively, so big enemies like the alpha creatures in meet week could be a problem.
---
They didn't have a single atom shop update the entire launch week of Update 21. I checked every day hoping it would be something other than three different Mothman packs. Do people actually buy that stuff? Are they just hoping people will buy that stuff?  
---
I really hope they come out with some proper CAMP packs I can sink my atoms into. I get that snapping isn't going anywhere, but even fallout 4 had some cool semi-prefab pieces that you could use to make shoddy shacks and fortifications. I see environmental houses in FO76 use this shit ALL THE TIME. LET ME GIVE YOU MONEY FOR IT! It costs you nearly nothing! The model already exists! It has for six years now!
---
Rifles can continuously fire, launchers shoot once. Obviously a rifle will out dps a launcher. I've never even seen a player touch the fatman or middle launchers. They aren't worth it. More players use pistols, but they still also aren't really worth it. Dps will always favor a certain type of weapon over another, and pistols will never be in the high ranking dps weapons unless you have a god roll pistol or something
---
Pipe gatling would be cool. Or just make the regular gatling fire .38
---
Yeah general rule of thumb if you see a gun with 797 range just buy it.
---
No it is a new build I am posting.
---
Explosive gauss mini?
---
Don't underestimate how many caps are out there. I'm hit 30k every day selling stuff.
---
Even better, I found last night you can exit the vendor and re-enter and they are restocked with lunchboxes. I bought like 9 IIRC.
---
That’s true, some people are cowards.  I dropped social media over a decade ago and JUST started getting into other forums like reddit  this year.  Again, I’m sorry people are jerks, but hopefully you give it another go.  I’m on PS if you ever want to team up.
---
The gatling gun the best putting out the most damage,mine does 660 damage in sneak
---
Yeah. My thought was a toolbox. But all it does is allow you to break things down. No repair or craft functionality. Would really help with weight management on the go.
---
Gatling Pipe. a pipe weapon version of the Gatling Gun, fires as fast as the normal gatling gun, but has lower damage due to how common/low level .38 is. 200 in the clip, can be rechambered to 5mm later on to boost damage a bit. id say minimum level would be 10, so new players can jump into heavy weapons a little sooner
---
I’ve seen you do that. But you cool off relatively shortly, so I respect that. 
---
OP’s been holding on to this for a while now. He came back after a full two days to throw insults at people asking him to substantiate a very unlikely claim.
---
Where is tje harpers ferry vendor now?
---
If your on ps4 and you want to try one with a group I'll join you later this evening I'm sns_bulldog
---
fra-gee-lay. well it must be italian!
---
Burning mine and camo are insanely difficult as a combo. The mine is shrouded in smog and it makes them even harder to see lol
---
Yes, I learned the plan last Meat Week and got my first legendary Tenderizer on Monday as a reward from a Daily Op. I got an Executioners 3 star w/ Power Attack speed and blocking, if I remember correctly.
---
Yeah I'd like to avoid that even if it is just a game
---
I appreciate this. This seems to be what everyone else is saying. I just got tired of all the space that legendaries took. 5 legendaries can max my scrip limit and even at 50caps a star they wouldnt move. So it overall became a moot point to keep extras.
---
Ohhh.
---
Bring back the junk blaster in all it’s meme glory
---
Gunslinger perk is the same percentage buff as commando and rifleman, so gunslinger itself is fine. It works the same as all the other weapon type buff cards. EXCEPT that they really should move it to Perception because having it in Agility eats up   perk slots needed for other damage cards.
---
It's the fact all of the gunslinger weapons are semi auto or single fire that's the root problem. They don't have a high enough base damage to compete with full auto pistols or rifles. Rifleman suffers the same issue right now.
---
What needs to happen is they need to rebalance the damage of all of the semi auto pistol receivers (and semi auto and single fire rifles too) , and add dual wielding for pistols (that takes away your ability to ADS or has an accuracy penalty). The revolvers also need a speedloader mod for the "magazine" attachment slot that speeds up reloads but maybe also increases wear.
---
Gaussmini has an unlisted explosive effect similar to the legendary effect. It’s even boosted by demo expert. So a TS gauss mini is really a TSE.
---
I was lucky,a level 400 had six and gave me one free of charge
---
Probably the 50cal or lmg. Gatling lasers or plasmas are good too.
---
I have 3 extras on Pc and all the colossus plans in my vendor for 100 caps each
---
Yeah... sorry.
---
Increasing rads for bloodied builds, I guess. Maybe carnivores have a use for them, dunno. Any utility they have is an edge case mostly.
---
Depends on what you mean by best.
---
Awesome, glad to see there’s some life in this really unique weapon! Thanks for answering!
---
You can back out of the Roxie one if you kill the Former Raider and choose "Appalachia has a New Corpse." Back out as soon as you see the Rep increase and keep spamming it to finish Raider Rep.
---
Unless they patched that. I'm not 100% sure because I finished rep in June/July finally.
---
Radiation Rumble ghouls have a lot of cash as well.
---
Sort of but so is the bloodied
---
Thanks, glad to hear it!
---
damn im on xbox
---
It's mostly the same. The weapons didn't really change relative position post patch.
---
Then I have no clue. I put a couple different ones together recently and didn’t have any issue.
---
I hear you. But I'm not into pvp, and depending on the team I run with at: Earl or the Queen, I use it. 
---
Bloody build speaking on my own behalf.
---
jesus that’s good shit
---
I think the limits should go up per level.
---
My bloodied plasma gatling is pretty god but also my explosive furious 50 cal is op. Id say either 50 cal or any bloodied fast firing gun
---
T-65 Helmets are broken with lighting effects, even with new skins on them.
---
If you look in third person, not only are the lamps/eyes not lighting up, but the light is coming out of your right foot and facing to the right.
---
Without getting into rolls or legacies I’d say the gauss minigun
---
I know the guass mini gun and plasma caster came out I was wondering if they’re better than the 50cal now?
---
Gatling Gun is a great ammo conserving gun. Take it to Daily Ops. Since the mobs there drop ammo based on what you killed them with, they drop 5mm. But, they currently drop way more than you used. I was 3 or 4 shotting Super Mutants last night, missing 0 shots and looting 20-60 5mm ammo on each corpse.
---
Far flung fire works gives you even more aoe damage, and ammo factory makes the ammo costs more reasonable.
---
I'm interested in this too, I use a Bloodied FFR 50cal for bosses, bloodied gatling for farming and trash mobs. 
---
Anyone know how the gauss minigun performs ?
---
Lol I had 2 in my vendor for 500 each.. no wonder they sold quickly :)
---
That's fine by me. My "income" from the machines is pretty much just a bonus as it is since, outside of those items, I price everything else at 20c or less.
---
I don't know. I'm still bothered that I bought a skin for the .44 before I knew that the legendary weapon I had was a western revolver. I don't think I knew there were different types at the time.
---
its a dope helm so im not surprised
---
30% was just a ridiculous amount. Nobody that actually plays the game would think that is acceptable or sensible. It's like making dog shit 30% tastier.
---
I mean, it was proven that they don't even listen to people who test the PTS...
---
I can always run in there with ya sometime and mow some things down. I have more than enough atom packs and all that to tank it all so we can get some lead
---
They have a Leg Lamp already inside the Rusty Pick. It's an Armor Leg with a Lamp Shade. I think it's behind Mrrmrrgh or in the Weapon Cage, IIRC
---
it makes them take damage from all sources from what i have seen, it is currently bugged to where people can drag you into PVP if you are in a team. 
---
you use it, join a team. someone shoots you and the effect triggers on them. the effect counts as a counter attack and they can shoot you freely
---
Really? I thought valley Galeria was much closer together
---
Hell yes man I’m waiting on more Fallout 1st gear the last one was the Bogwanderer
---
Yeah, it’s still a “good” weapon, but is easily outclassed by the vast majority of the legendary weapons, simply because it’s missing a primary affix.  That said, it’s still good.  My test was to see “if I was a casual player and the only weapon I had access to was a quest reward, how could I do”.  I went in with overall mediocre gear, just the 3 Slugger perks, and the All Rise and it was doable.  A well placed power attack to the head could kill most of the level 75’s 
---
I still have all my quest rewards, I moved them to a mule, but I have them.  Some go on display in my camp as little memories.  Then again I’m weird, I won’t use mounted heads until I’ve actually killed a creature.  I do it for the memories
---
Yeah me either even tried different internet browsers and no luck. So not sure what is going on. Thanks anyway.
---
Depends on what you mean by better.
---
I paid 1800, and it felt like a good deal. Really like how it pairs with the stealth suit.
---
How long has it been like this
---
The market in 76 is so bleh. Realistically3k is a great price if the value of caps didn’t tank in value. I have a hard time maintaining caps so if I had 3k at the time I would of loved that. Nothing like hovering 10k caps and hearing about items priced at “don’t trade for caps, this items value is trade only.”so yeah the 3k is a fair price to a legit player.
---
All I know is that the Gauss Shotgun has been worth every bit of the grind, and then some.
---
Yeah I have the ranger outfit, looks really good with it
---
I took four Legendary SPECIAL perks, since at max rank, it makes your total available Perk Points 76, which felt appropriate.
---
Block then power attack.
---
Melee actually requires a little strategy now. You'll be fine.
---
you won't necessarily need unyielding armor to boost stats unless you are using one handed (just swap out strength cards).
---
bolstering armor full set at 18% health will give 160 DR and 160 ER.
---
barbarian 3 is 80 DR, bullet shield 3 is 60 DR while shooting,  ironclad 5 is 50 DR-50 ER,  nerd rage 3 is 40 DR, evasive 3 is 45 DR-45 ER, scaly skin (on a team with strange in numbers) is 62 DR-62-ER, grounded will be 125 ER.
---
totaling 337 DR from build + 160 DR from bolstering = 497 DR
---
totaling 282 ER from build + 160 ER from bolstering = 442 ER
---
that is before adding in your armors base stats.
---
standard set of heavy combat armor with BOS mod = 226 DR - 266 ER
---
so total armor rating for this build with full set of heavy BOS combat armor would be: 723 DR - 708 ER if my math checks out.
---
best set would be a heavy combat torso and 2 heavy leather limbs and 2 heavy metal limbs (all bolstering), total would be: 755 DR - 706 ER
---
using a matching set of armor will allow you to run the legendary perk card to reduce poison damage.
---
note: totals include bullet shield and only apply when firing. also totals are shown for being on a team, using strange in numbers, class freak, and having another teamate who is mutated.
---
it was originally an MG, according to the files, but then for some reason they cut the chinese assault rifle so thats the AR instead
---
It's sadly impossible to be a lefty in fallout 76 :(
---
If it got popular as an actual pvp event, yeah. If it's like monster mash nobody who does the event will ever have a decent pvp build, they'll just be there to slog through it to get the event rewards.
---
We've still got quite a few interior that they could re-purpose. For example, I think that government building with the DMV would be a great location.
---
Since it was released with Wastelanders.
---
first 8 words were on point.
---
Yep nice little magazine. Still in print.  Was what you would call a "prepper" magazine long  before being a prepper was all the rage.  Filled with lots of old timey recipes, advice on living off grid, camping, knot tying, hunting,  etc.... Imagine an adult magazine for those that were  boy scouts if you want to get an idea of what they have inside. Actually a very useful source of information. I got maybe a dozen sitting in my "reading stash" by the toilet
---
I use my bloodied gatling to gather 5mm ammo, then use my Instigating FFR minigun on the boss with all the collected ammo
---
damn i wish i could get that deal it pairs well with a lot of outfits
---
It's like fertile ground if nobody visits the airport it never starts.
---
I would LOVE a large anti-material rifle. Make it shoot 20mm Vulcan shells and count as a heavy weapon. I'd carry that beast even if it weighed 50 lbs.
---
I suggested keeping both mainly because of a gauss minis rarity and power. Given that you can only get them from modules or event rewards, and having a good roll on 2 variations is great for flexibility. But if op also plays a juggernaut, the two shot would be better.  I remember reading that the accuracy penalty on two shot is getting adjusted, something to consider too.
---
it's a long answer. each heavy weapon has its pros and cons. generally speaking, the .50 cal. it's the best all-rounder. gatling plasma is a worse, but still very capable alternative to the .50 cal.
---
the gatling gun and the plasma caster have low dps, but can dispatch trash mobs quickly due to their high single shot damage. they also excel at ammo conservation because of that.
---
the LMG, gauss minigun and flamer all have the highest dps, but are also hell to keep fed. and the flamer breaks fast and is bugged on top of it.
---
the minigun and gatling laser are probably the least notable heavy guns, but have their niches. like magic ones, which are bugged and kill bosses extremely quick, or vampire ones, which will keep you alive forever. ultracite gatling lasers are better than regular ones.
---
there's also legacy heavy guns, which are just explosive energy heavies, and should be in a category of their own. any legacy you can get is gonna serve you well, but also constantly blow up in your face and kill you.
---
When you put PA in your inventory or stash and it has a fusion core in the PA the corresponding fusion core will show in your ammo section of stash or inventory. Doesn't add weight since it's part of the PA set but if you take the fusion core out of ammo if stash or drop it from inventory then the power armor spawns with no fusion core.
---
You have to remember how much charge your PA had so you don't drop/remove the wrong core from inventory.
---
Haha yeah I came across it and was like oooh I wonder what happens, so I tried it, as you do. Pretty trippy.
---
Seriously? FFS Bethesda. I hope MS does some cleaning and boots the dead weight.
---
Never heard of this one. I did have mine disappear when I was ready for the launch run. Happened twice so far.
---
Yeah especially when you know where the end boss is going to be
---
Yeah, it's basically trading bullets, stims, durability, sanity, and time for minuscule rewards in an event that sloppily mixes pvp and pve. Monster mash is a MESS. And if a low level joins you just feel like a bully.
---
Radrats during primal cuts in the ash heap count as glowing, I believe.
---
High rise is the only one I kept but yes when I first got it so long ago it was best I had. But never messed with builds on weapons. I just wanted to carry as much as I can. So I used that because it showed highest damage. So many weapons I prob dropped or scrapped that where god rolls I don’t even wanna think about and that included legacies I had because I thought they where junk back then and I also didn’t realize they wouldn’t be around anymore. Man 🤦‍♂️ lol
---
Maybe, or maybe I’m just used to the burning mine now lol
---
Yeah this was a crew of 4, all pretty high level
---
Ok now that sounds sweet! I like it!
---
Actually all you need to do to buff them is to allow dual-wield :V
---
It's been underwhelming to me since launch. Most of the items are downright ugly. I'm sitting on over 8000 Atoms and I've never spent any money on the game other than the $60 I paid for the game itself.
---
But you're right, the Contemporary Camp bundle was great. It was one of the few things I've actually bought from the Atom Shop.
---
Mainly full health. That's all I play is rifleman and now hybrid rifle/heavy. Found the railway is probably the best gun for one hits in rifle no stealth, harpoon in heavy. For yao I agree with that, but the qe harpoon can do it. I run 4 guns on my characters and tested a lot after the patch.
---
The tse handmade is still the best mass cripple weapon imo with grenadier. Even my alt is 1-2 hitting the prime fogcrawlers in the bog. My main did ops sub 7 solo today but he has a some legend perks maxed https://imgur.com/MOXoeS8
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu3vdJB9L7I &lt; Here's after the patch testing instigating rail. nm the condescending meme at the end, was tired of reading the forum that rifleman and one hitting is dead. I've only crafted some 5mm since the patch to check out the maxed ammo perks.
---
The i33 lever is still on my main, use it to save condition on the harpoon. It does one hit most things, something the fixer and handmade can't do for a rifleman unfortunately.
---
ouch
---
No, but I think the point is that would be a good location for content.
---
That's what they always do, ignore bugs to push new broken content.
---
I picked up a bloodied swing speed strength tenderizer from the purveyor yesterday, so they do exist
---
nope i was running bloodied modded boxing gloves, they went from 1800 damage to 210 with the same perks, yea i am using all perks/mutations that boosts damage and have 34 strength, and the 3.5 sneak multilayer almost never works
---
THIS
---
learned at prickett's fort
---
Or an "overflow container" that stores up to ~5,000 Caps if your pockets are full.
---
I believe all gauss weapons have explosive effect now, so basically I have a Bloodied (Exp) and Two Shot (Exp) and the Two Shot seems to do much better
---
I did this “before patch” and worked great.  Now I have half a bar to complete the settlers side.  Raiders and settlers were even before I found out how to do it.
---
What would be the best Vampire heavy gun? 
---
I don't find myself dying a lot as a Bloody Heavy gunner though, I'd always appreciate not using too many stims
---
It's Tough Love Wednesday. I do this because I love you.
---
not a bad idea, but pipe shotgun would be most realistic and probably only gun you could make out of a pipe. so why not combine the two and make a pipe gatling shotgun? make it like 30 rounds or so.
---
haha, that's awesome
---
Not rally useful items but This week is one of the best weeks to grab all the plans from Graham if you haven't already.
---
Indeed. I run a stealth sniper build, bloodied ofc. Pre patch I ran a bloodied lever action ffr. After the path I noticed a noticeable decrease in damage, so I switched out to an instigating ffr lever action. Immediately back to one shotting everything, except robots, at level 75 and lower. I still keep my bloodied lever action for boss fights and such. But overall be on some minor tweaking there really isn't a whole lot of difference
---
Unfortunately Xbox, but thanks :)
---
Concentrated fire is still part of my build. I use it to boost my lever action damage. It's better than three points in rifleman.
---
I sell all decorative plans at 5 caps each, and all non decorative mostly at 10-15 unless its a rare one then those are as high as 50 caps. I love playing post apocalyptic sims and regular sims 😂😂
---
I was really fortunate, just happened to hit a camp that had one for sale. I had all but given up hoping Earle would ever give me one.
---
I can try that. Makes sense but it doesn’t say it applies to projectile weapons
---
I mean, I can craft it for her easily, I just was hoping she'd be able to craft it too because she'd have the weapon, even though she didn't know the plan (just in case she's playing when I'm at work and runs out).
---
Oh well though, I suppose we'll just have to grind more Scorched Earth until she gets the plan too
---
Strange.. I have never seen this bug. Worked fine yesterday so not sure what is going on.🤔
---
All Explosions benefit from it, from grenades to legendary exploding bullets.
---
Is there a build you can do for the alien blaster or is just a unique item to show off
---
Yo man that pipe is awesome stuff....
---
I had the same problem and this fixed it.  I think it started when I tried to rename my power armor.
---
I didn't hear about no Mischief Night.  I've been taking a break and was hoping to make a return soon for Halloween.  I'm so bummed.
---
This whole MS will make BGS Xbox exclusive is absolutely absurd. 
---
Sure, MS just bought a company that has popular franchises that sell alot of units. 
---
But whether you love them, or hate them, BGS is a microtransaction machine.
---
They're not going to make BGS games exclusive. They're leaving far more potential cash on the table than they would otherwise.
---
depends on how much you'll be relying on it. generally speaking, anything with a high rate of fire and the explosive effect. a gatling gun or a plasma caster\* for example wouldn't make a good vampire weapon in my opinion. but a .50 cal or a LMG would.
---
Ya I pretty much only use PA for Earl so that combined with fireproof pretty much makes me, well, fireproof. I Prefer the specials and XP in unyielding unless I feel PA is absolutely necessary.
---
Dude you forgot the best part. Enough candy to put you into a coma.
---
i genuinely found the comment to be quite funny if im honest
---
Uh, have you been there post patch 22? There are hardly any Glowing ones anymore, most are new variations that aren't glowing. Not even the damn level 100 molerats are glowing.
---
Black Powder is surprisingly effective in my experience. The only downside is there’s no mods for it and the firerate is basically 0. And of course you can’t get a Quad version to even try to offset that.
---
Gauss almost does as much damage when fully charged, so the damage is there, but the fact that charging just sometimes doesn’t work, VATS is fucked up on charging weapons and the range is positively abysmal, it just falls flat. Like, if all those issues were resolved it would at least be effective to some degree.
---
But yeah useless on SBQ. VATS enhanced Black Powder pistols with crits do a solid 500-700 damage though 👌
---
yes, that too. LOL
---
Can you guys do Daily Ops? She can get a ton of bullets from there from scavenging, and if you complete it another 200ish rounds. If not, then just stick with the hardened receiver since it does the same damage as the Prime, just not the bonus against scorched.
---
I believe there also have to be people on the team for it to trigger - I had someone attack me while I was in an empty public team and nothing happened.
---
West? I think your compass is broken.
---
I actually have a full size leg lamp that I won...so it really was a major award.  Sadly, my wife won't let me put it out.  There's no "soft glow of electric sex gleaming in the window" at my house.  :(
---
Daily. And there are glowing ones there every time, same as it was before (except the higher levels, obviously).
---
I should point out that I don't go IN the mine, I slaughter the ones topside.
---
Got the bayoneted rifle on display ;)
---
But you can’t even craft it is my point. You gotta get lucky and find it :/
---
No. 
---
MS doesn't just sell more games by not making BGS games exclusive. 
---
The thing that everyone seems to be forgetting is that BGS has proven via Fallout Shelter and 76, is that they know how to effectively push microtransactions to make money. 
---
If for no other reason, that's why MS will never make BGS games exclusive.
---
I sell two and three star weapons, good ones with decent effects, for 1500 caps. The longer I play the more my prices drop.
---
Create another character. If you subscribe to 1st, transfer all your stuff through your private server. If not risk it in a remote area on the public servers. Lots of guidance on YT.
---
I had to do it as I got a bug part way through the settlers quest.
---
Makes me wonder how (or if) being in pacifist mode affects that particular scenario?
---
BUT MY 1 STAR LEVEL 20 PIPE WRENCH!?!?
---
use this [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic)
---
Pacifist works for that. Yeah it is really op perk if you play on teams. Run right in let Earl kick your face. Not sure if it stacks with multiple people, sure angry turtle has tested that.
---
I’ve played this game legit since launch and still to this day I’ve enjoyed all my “decent” drops. Why would I want instant gratification. Recently I came by a magic shotgun drop and have been running that. It does seem like a reward for my timeless grind. However don’t let loot make your gaming experience. I feel like people are rushing to this “end game” which really is the same thing of killing mobs for legendary rolls. Just chill. Enjoy the wasteland while Bethesda still is investing into it.
---
:(
---
Last couple times I tried this, locate cargo bot, FT to cargo not.  Shoot cargo bot.  Cargo bot flies away across map.
---
Garage door with the switch inside. Hit max caps? Remove the roof, jump in, switch it off, replace the roof.
---
Shows up on the map as gray.
---
do the menats that highlight living targets see through camo?
---
damn man thats dope im just sitting here getting yelled at for offering prices that arent 40k caps
---
maybe the candy bowl can be a stationary thing that can be activated for a random effect like the lunch box, or gives out one piece of candy for a similar random effect.
---
Dude, where's my legendary?
---
Pacifist mode on stops this
---
Here are some tips,  go melee for now the fire axe is a great early level weapon, build up strength you can change it later if you need to.
---
Carry purified water or even boiled water these can replace stimpacks 
---
If you can place your camp on a junk node and get a collection .. they will give you lots of materials 
---
Create an adhesive farm you can use it yourself or sell it
---
At level 25 get excavator PA this will get you 4x ore there is a mine above Watoga (lucky hole mine)where you’ll get 1000 lead with the PA
---
This is the Scavenger’s Bible.  All hail the wisdom contained within.
---
Super annoying since the beginning.
---
*Husband* “Oh, found it. It’s right here for me.”
---
*Me* “Not for me it isn’t.” *sigh, give up looking*
---
of course im aware of that and its great to hear, you like those skins. fantastic. but, from my point of view, id like to see other things as top tier reward also.
---
I’m fine with it, means I don’t have to buy atoms so I don’t feel like I’m missing out on anything cool.
---
For me it isn't that different. I'm bloodied unarmed. Sometimes I died to take off my gauntlet for level 30 and below areas. Still just one punch everything
---
Yeah, I have been chasing the damn cargobot across the map as well 😁 it usually takes 2-3 hops to capture it, usually from a rooftop or mountain. It is interesting how it senses that you figured out where it is heading and then reverses the course in the opposite direction.
---
Im just saying if you are using logic of bigger/heavier=stronger,  the rule doesnt apply in way too many cases. 
---
Pistols weighing a few pounds less is not worth the massive damage decrease.
---
You pretty much said things you want are the things we should get, not what the community wants
---
Hero
---
the worst is when a camp item is maybe 1-2 hits away from being destroyed and you cant repair it, and the only time it was damaged when everything else in your camp was already destroyed
---
Yeah I’ve had 2 friends stop playing specifically because they hate having to eat and drink every 15 minutes. With a controller it’s just a huge pain.
---
Just wanted to say thank you again!!
---
• The herbivore to carnivore switch was HUGE! Do you have a method of gathering all the meat? 
---
• Still need to tweak some perks to make my PA aspect viable. I like the bloodied uny style but I can definitely see when PA will help tank! 
---
• Have a whisky making factory set up at my camp now and that’s a awesome bonus! 
---
• I’ve never been much of a chem user so that’ll be a whole new challenge. I hate resource grinding so pretty much have never gathered the stuff for chems.
---
All in all I’m getting a lot more bang for my buck and it’s made it a lot more enjoyable. I’m not huge on having to hunt down resources but the carnivore option is simple. Once again really appreciate these tips!!!
---
And glowing radrats in the Ash Heap
---
I weighs so much, especially with the salty mod. I might carry one if it was 90rw but thinking, with mod might still weigh around 15?
---
Some of us did for no reason other than morbid curiosity. That curiosity was NOT worth it, but now might slightly be a bit less not worth it.
---
No. Again. 
---
You people are looking at this from purely a game units and potential additional console sales. 
---
MS didn't just buy a company with popular franchises that sell units.
---
They bought a company who has proven they can absolutely rack in microtransactions. 
---
Think of Fallout shelter. In 2018 it was reported it had surpassed 100 million and who knows what that number is now. 
---
BGS' potential for selling more consoles pales in comparison to their potential to rack up additional profit in the form of MTXs.
---
Cool. I'll look into all this when my internet connection comes back. Thank you
---
My pa spawns every time without a fc in it. I never take my fc’s out of my inventory.
---
what?? i said "to me". isnt that clearing out, that im talking of my personal opinion??
---
Unless you're using Funky Duds or Sizzling Style, you could always swap out for a different, slightly weaker Helmet. Using a T-51 Helmet won't hurt your resistances too bad, plus it has the Bright Lamp mod available, unlike T-65 Armor.
---
I, for one, wholeheartedly love this idea. Maybe a red rocket bb gun to go with it.
---
Huh? That’s weird every eyebot has been a one shot kill for me.
---
You worded it in a very selfish way
---
&gt;The i33 lever is still on my main, use it to save condition on the harpoon. It does one hit most things, something the fixer and handmade can't do for a rifleman unfortunately.
---
Yeah, of course. That's not my point. 
---
There's a very stark difference between efficiency &amp; effectiveness. It's more ammo efficient to snipe. It's more effective in terms of damage dealt over time with semi rifle. Like you said with yao guais. Same applies with other tankier mobs you can't take down with 1-2 shots.
---
Agreed, people keep saying pistols suck but my gauss is putting out ~500 damage at 40% hp. Backup weapon is a plasma thrower pistol that literally melts any max level mobs. Two pistols and I'm covered for every situation, pistols do not suck in general.
---
I pulled out my TSE 44 in an Op a few minutes ago for old times sake, and it was hitting the mutants for around 40 damage per shot, so 80 in total. That's around 8% of their health. Ludicrous considering I have Gunslinger perks maxed out.
---
Sorry my friend :( we have all suffered a great loss this day.
---
So far it seems okay.  My build is pretty unoptimized too. If ya need a hand later this evening id be willing to help ya run through it. Otherwise I'd say if you feel confident enough make a couple runs there every so often to keep the stack high. As well as always claim the hemlock something or other workshop. Has 3 or 4 spots to farm acid I think. Gt is numbminded19 if ye need.👍🤘
---
I think he talking about the 2x (or more with cards) Sneak Attack bonus not happening.
---
Right. I quickly realized this too the day the cards were available (I'm lvl 380), and I was like; holy shit I've got to get to around lvl 600 asap. lol ... Time to start making that Cranberry Relish again!
---
Dude 5 shots or whatever from a Gatling gun is nothing.
---
Chainsaw should collect wood when used on a tree.
---
The difference is the explosive damage. For ballistic damage of a shot, TS does 62.5% of normal damage on two shots, adding up to 125%. However, for the explosive portion it just doubles it. So rather than two two explosions at 62.5%, you get two explosions at 100% of the standard explosive dmg. Demo expert then bumps both up.
---
This is why a TS auto grenade launcher is awesome. It doubles the explosive damage which is all the damage.
---
Me please!!!
---
Since when do you have to wait 24 hours? 
---
I'm pretty sure I ran Daily Ops several times in a day by server hopping and joint DOps parties...
---
what?
---
.50 cal is the best for basic people. All others require a certain finesse, gat plasma and minis if you get hit you have to wait for an animation to wind back up.  Caster and gatling gun slow fire but front end shitty for large and boss mobs. GL UGL best ammo capacity with perks decent but suffers vs any high energy resist mobs.  LMG great if magic but the recoil and ammo usage is terrible I would place it dead last as a useable gun.    
---
If you have a magic gun it doesn't matter. If you have a legacy learn to jump a lot and it doesn't matter.   
---
Overall I love the .50 cal it is clean and simple to use, however since I have a stack of legacies I find myself using them more for the foreseeable future. QE15 flechette harpoon gun is so fun and BE gat plasma is right there also.
---
yeah, seems so. i will overthink my future choice of words ;)
---
Do you have more photos of them getting it on?    Asking for a friend.
---
If ya played ya cards right, that 30% buff is actually pretty darn tootin' powerful.
---
Those idiots that were gay bashing got dealt with I believe.  And that was early on in the games release.   
---
I have not heard or seen anything like that again.
---
But the upvotes keep me warm at night :(
---
I do! Completely forgot about that. I did finish it a few times. It was a fun event. Nice concept. I'd pick opposite teams from my friends and all hell broke loose 😂
---
Would ultracite be the next best thing in regards to defense stats?
---
Is that an attempt at sarcasm? Hard to tell through a phone screen.
---
And Warner Bros.
---
Also, almost all their articles are reader-submitted. It's literally a survival/outdoors magazine for and by survivalist/outdoorsmen.
---
Everyone is doing microtransactions now , I don’t understand your point . 
---
Game pass is the future and if they can make a bunch of gamers favorite games exclusive to pc/Xbox that would hurt PlayStation(their main competition who sells more consoles than Xbox). 
---
By your logic , why does anyone do exclusives?
---
Modus releases nanobots from cargobots that infiltrate the Wasteland inhabitants and controls them.😎 cyberzombiefied. The are microscopes available, could use them to analyze the samples collected from the mission. Or like how we do it for the scorchbeast DNA mission.(c)
---
I've got a Bloodied/Faster Reload Black Powder Pistol but that reload is just a serious pain I can't get used to.
---
We need stuff like the Plasma Defender, Hunting Revolver, etc from New Vegas. That game was incredible for weapons
---
You sure? My melee build seems fine, but it is unarmed so maybe that's different...
---
I really don’t remember that event, and definitely never did it.  Back in 2018 I mostly tried to ignore the fact that the game was multiplayer and didn’t do many events.
---
Ironically, I spend a good portion of time in events now.
---
You mean we can change our perks later?? I didn't know that! lol 
---
For adhesive farms, I assume you need the plans first then the materials etc? 
---
Thanks for the other tips!!
---
Good advice, the .50 and LMG are the go to vamp guns I use.  I have the legacy vamp plasma gat, legacy vamp gatling laser and regular laser, but for almost any situation (most notably daily ops) I prefer the 50 cal.
---
Im not trying to troll.  
---
I pvp more days than not and can't reproduce your results, so I'm happy to learn how it is you are able to get pulled into pvp while in pacifist. 
---
Thus my repeated requests to see a video of this.
---
That's cool I didn't know that. I was wondering why we had no light machine gun of any sort after FNV super glad they brought the mg42 to the game but I really want that SAW.
---
no thanks
---
Or they *do*. Hence the backwards toilet paper..this train car, etc...those twisted bastards
---
My brothers and I bought one of these for my dad several years ago.  It was shipped complete with the fragile stamp and everything.
---
The look on my moms face prompted my dad to say,”guess this isn’t going in the window, wouldn’t want it broken.”
---
One year after my mother died, us boys put it in the front window.  It still sits there, untouched, not talked about....  we assume my dad thinks if he acknowledges it, mom will notice it and knock it over from the grave.
---
They have a contract with private division, so they had to release it on ps4. 
---
The dlc is on the private division site.
---
Don’t do quests yet, just stay around Whitespring and farm the ghouls, you’ll get to level 50 in a few days, then you have all the weapons to choose from. Vendor hoping can land you nice gears and reasonably priced ammo (normally 1 cap per round).
---
Targeting HUD doesn’t, so I assume berry mentats don’t work.
---
Microsoft got Gears of War, sea of thieves, and grounded as exclusive titles as well
---
Im mean daily
---
Definitely gonna have to either be called the "Fragile Lamp" or "Italian Lamp"
---
Its *been* underwhelming for like a year now.
---
Yep you can spec into your build later , work out what you want to be and build towards it but use strength for now.
---
No plan for adhesive you just cook it up, look under utility on your cooking fire, it’s Tato, mutfruit and corn if I remember right
---
changed wording sorry i didnt read it through
---
PIPE IS LIFE
---
I’m a melee build primarily, so I have maxed out Martial Artist. Brings the weight of it down significantly
---
Yeah, my Primed B2525 Gatling Plasma still shreds. Less than it did, but it shreds. Same for the Primed B1025 .50 cal.  
---
B2525 Gauss Minigun is incredible, but very very ammo hungry.
---
disclaimer: I am not a heavy gunner build, just have a few perks that benefit heavies, and use them in certain circumstances. 
---
That said, I have a vampire 50 and a vampire focused gatling plasma.  
---
 Vampire 308 works well b/c of the rate of fire, but is harder to keep fed.  Even when using ammosmith2 and superduper3 - crafting makes 21x 308s vs 180x 50 cals.
---
When it comes to which is best....the 50 is good general purpose - I use it non-robot   
---
 Daily Ops, when soloing UF, and against mothmen and few other select enemies. 
---
  However, for SBs, I change to the gatling plasma.  It does more damage per hit to SBs than the 50 cal, and as a bonus, only takes a couple hits to take out the L68 scorched that usually accompany SBs.
---
trickle that shit down yo..
---
why you hoarding caps like that
---
I’d guess that anyone reading posts in this forum knows the rules for each event. I get the OP’s frustration. It’s so aggravating to have people aimlessly wandering about, particularly for an event that’s 2 years old.
---
Just make it so every time we kill a legendary the reward goes directly into our inventory. Like they do with all the garbage rewards they're constantly stuffing into our pockets. If they can give me an auto grenade launcher and 9 grenades every time I turn in scorchbeast DNA they can manage this.
---
Yes, why not? This isn't reality, it's a weapon choice in a multiplayer video game. It's not like the gameplay is complex enough to give it many other advantages over other weapons. ***You are talking about a game where a hammer with a rocket attached to the back is able to one-shot a super mutant when blasting it three to five times in the face with a 44 Revolver won't kill it.***
---
I was there yesterday to do the weekly, not a single one was glowing outside the mine. They were all new types. I had to go through the whole mine and still couldn't finish the weekly, there was only a couple inside glowing.
---
The ash/goo pile will be in the air. And the bottom of said pile has no render so its invisible from below.
---
Only does it to me when I drop cores are like 20% or less and don't realize that was the one currently in my PA.
---
Higher damage if the roll is the same, comes with explosive bullets, but you def need Battery Included to counter the ammo weight. The explosive effect is blinding, that’s one reason I don’t use it much.
---
Lol
---
Honestly, they could condense Gunslinger and Guerilla into one card with 20+40+60 damage under agi and it still wouldn't be OP.
---
I’ve found that if only 1 person joins that’s enough to do it under 8 minutes. I’m impatient and can’t waste time waiting for someone to join. If you’re starting a new ops team then the people that join should be ready unless you’re taking too long to start it. As for text chat as long as 1 person who starts it and knows what they’re doing is talking then your team can thumbs up or down in reply.
---
Yeah I see your point. It's definitely not the same as pre patch, had to adapt a lot.
---
I had a group that played together all the time back then, we tried it a few times, never got it to work. Could have been a lot of fun if they'd fixed it but, I mean, come on. They definitely weren't ever going to fix it.
---
My atoms are always safe because I want dirty rusty stuff. The pristine stuff is an eye sore to me in a post apocalypse.
---
 But I understand it sells better than the stuff I want.
---
Put a candy bowl that you can put meds in for raiders lol.
---
I've definitely found stuff after piles go away. When you could glitch line in the sand, the piles in the circle would get ridiculous. My friend told me he just waited till they went away and came back to loot. He's got first, so I swear he can't help but pick up everything of any value and break it down for junk. We used to give him shit because his stash was always full of junk before 1st.
---
Kill 10 scorched.
---
PA is already strong. How about just ban the hackers? Like permanently.
---
Silly question here: I have an ultracite gattling laser but it uses regular cores. Would having ultracite core in my inventory make a difference?
---
Did you recheck after a few seconds? I've had them show empty after opening the lock but backing out and looking again would show the contents.
---
no. could come from the fact, that english isnt my native language and i miss some nuances between the lines from the words i choose. let me try to clear it out:  
---
i understood the post as a question, of what people would like to see as future rewards. its clear, he seems to like those skins, so everything i wanted to mention is, that, from my personal point of view, there are people who dont use PA and it would be nice, to have other top tier rewards also. nothing more. it seems like the way i wrote it got understood in a, as you say, selfish way that wasnt my intention.
---
I've been trying. I swear legendary molerats just evaporate. I've lost 3 or 4 of them in the last 2 days. All 3*.
---
I scripped it me wank thing
---
Yea, that would be perfect for fallout 2 maybe a green x for legandaries 2
---
All are good, except for the Broadsider.
---
Nice job !
---
It would be nice. But I'm happy with the new electrical absorption card. That was plenty of a buff imo
---
What were they called?
---
Haha I got murdered instantly in daily ops by a blood eagle in power armor with one
---
Used to kill them in much less
---
Was my favorite event and was a ton of fun. Nice mix of pvp and PvE. 
---
Don’t understand why they removed it.
---
I was also in a group/guild that as an activity recreated the event. PvP with Black powder and other era appropriate weapons, no legendaries, no Vats and some other limitations. But they fiddle farted around crafting uniforms for everybody for so long I had to bolt before they actually started.
---
I was told it was fun LOL
---
Since there’s fewer people doing ACP, the price shouldn’t go too low too quickly. I sold a couple for 6-8k each, gone within ten minutes after i put them in vending machine.
---
PA and photomode glitch would like to have a word with you about that theory. 
---
Also, just closing doors don’t make camps appear grey, that happens when a player is still loading into the server or just left. 
---
And turning the machines off only hides the camp from the map. 
---
The only 100% to disable them is to remove/store them. Which is a huge PITA
---
I have a hidden switch that not even I can access to turn them on/off with the (locked) computer terminal. 
---
It’s not perfect, it’s not secure, but it’s the least painful really. 
---
Oh and: I constantly spend caps to stay around 10K I I don’t sell overpriced shit
---
are you trying to get mods?
---
The super Mutant that runs meat week. Normally he randomly travels around Appalachia making it difficult to find and trade with him. Right now he's parked near vault 76 so he can run the meat week event every hour.
---
I even tried to put ammo into it to see if it transfers... it did. Then tried it a couple more times and then just canceled it..was frustrated.
---
My unarmed melee character felt nice and strong the other day when I checked it out.
---
If I were level 21 I would...use a spiked board and stealth whenever possible, to save ammo. I would alternate between a pump shotgun, hunting rifle, and pipe revolver (modified to a rifle with the stock mod)...this will alternate ammo type.  Farm Morgan Town airport and Point Pleasant for weapons, ammo, and chems.  
---
Craft healing salves, use them instead of stimpaks whenever possible.  Stimpaks are for combat only.  Never use stimpaks after combat...use water and food instead.  
---
Try to focus on taking perk cards for a single weapon class, at least on your first character.  Avoid the jack-of-all-trades approach.  Rifleman (morphing into comando later) makes a great first build.  
---
Don’t be afraid to ask a higher level player to craft a weapon or a mod for you.  Some won’t, but many will be happy to help.  
---
Try to balance scrapping weapons and armor with selling them to a vendor for caps.  You really need to learn those mods.  You don’t need a ton of caps just yet.
---
True.
---
Even my legacies hit other players like wet paper towels now. Got ganked by a seriously fucking tanky melee build earlier... He took almost no damage at all from anything I tried on him. BE handmade, BE Railway Rifle, BE laser... All of which are commando and I’m specced for commando weapons.
---
Yes it spawned right at the entrance of my camp when I first moved there. Obviously, you gotta sniff the pipe
---
The enemy has to be attacking you. So it won't be able to stack, since they can't attack more than 1 person at a time
---
Enclave events are good for that.
---
Primal Cuts has really brought this back with me. Every time I see a Legendary Stingwing blip on the screen and then disappear into a legacy explosive laser bath from another event goer I kinda just tell myself it was going to be a 1\* ghoul slayer leather arm to feel better about it.
---
I’d have to re check but last I saw ts the second shot was somewhere around 25/30%  it’s also not taking into account armour residences of enemies which explosive has no work around for but ballistic has stabilized. That’s why ffr overtook explosive as the top secondary for dps.
---
Edit: re read I get your wording now. Your ya numbers are correct
---
Narrator: "And then the pyro, eager to burn and loot, discovered he did not have enough gold to complete his murder suit.  Alas, he could not count. What need is there to count when the Wasteland does not care..."
---
Pyro: "Tomorrow, Apalachia becomes my bitch. But first, I must sleep. Tomorrow...."
---
Nukashine candy
---
Issues Resolved: On a whim I figured I would check my browser apps and it has been a while since they were last updated. Updated them and it seems to be working now. Thanks.
---
The Gatling gun is basically the most ammo efficient weapon in the game. 5 shots is nothing.
---
I have that and it wrecks everything, but durability is so shit tho lol
---
I saw that both the flamingos are in the atom shop. Both flamingos have lights on em. Only difference is the paid one is standing up straight and the free one’s got its head down. Lol
---
Yes exactly 😂 i have to wait.
---
I am a PA user for life but this is just my 2 cents on this. If they were to implement legendary PA pieces I think they should focus more on QOL perks rather then damage perks or damage resistance perks. What I mean is they should have some that decrease the weight of certain items because PA can't use backpacks. They should have a stabilizing legendary effect so we can free up 3 points if we use stabilized. Slower fusion core drain, etc, etc. I feel like giving effects that increase resistance or damage on PA might make it a little too OP as it already has the potential to be a monster, but adding nice QOL legendary effects can make being a PA user not such a pain in the ass sometimes.
---
It can be finicky. Rank the card up then click on the card. You may have to do it a few times but this worked for me.
---
LIFE IS PIPE!!!
---
It would seem to be simpler to just drop a bag at point of death, then stop looting corpses.
---
Ah nanobots!!! I like it.
---
5 mins 35 seconds here 
---
Not bad. I find the burning mine the easiest
---
Yeah that would get to me also. If you're on xbox I can drop you a few cards in a couple hours when I get on. Message you gt if that would help
---
i get more dammaged for my uny sent armor than my power armor its week compaired to good roles
---
You can "insult" someone with roses depending on the colour. ;)
---
You’re telling me dealing 5000+ damage per hit at least once per second was balanced? It’s not broken, it’s fixed
---
Core assembly chest mod with kinetic servo leg mods , but I use just the core assembly, with my calibrated shocks. Action boy and dodgy top it off for real solid defense.
---
I put most plans at 1 cap unless it's chems, from ACP, or daily ops.
---
Quick google search would’ve answered this
---
I like the current bundle, it looks cool IMO
---
Make them a glowing golden meat pile
---
ultracite gatling lasers are literally the same as regular ones, except better. and like regular ones, you can prime them so they use ultracite cores.
---
it's a little confusing, yes.
---
I died during a primal cuts event today because I did the thumbs up emote and just got stuck doing it. Couldn’t heal, leave, shoot, or anything. Just thumbs up to my death
---
No. Unless you prime it they use normal fusion cores
---
Beautifully written.
---
Yeah.  I think electric absorption and Funky Duds and Sizzling style and heavy guns in general take care of the combat part.  I want backpack mods on pa.
---
Of you're sticking with melee remember to use martial artist, blocker, and incisor.
---
Thanks, I am on Xbox but will keep on trying - I actually give them to someone who can launch them in extremely short time using some black magic😁😀
---
These new racks are so arbitrary. You can display an MG-42 on them of all things, but not a laser rifle or a plasma rifle or even a pipe rifle.
---
I got 3 times the vault 94 container and that's it, nothing else even though I've reached Elder rank everyday....
---
Exactly. I play with people who are fairly hard core.  When we ran nuke silos. they wondered why I didn't use the glitch that lets you skip ahead to the end. I said because I don't want to miss out on XP.  They would say oh I don't care about XP I am level 220 I am finished with this characters build. I tried to explain to them countless times that there was a legendary perk system coming where you had to be insanely high level to take full advantage of it.  They didn't listen to me and boy are they pissed now lol
---
Two shot on a weapon that already has a high rate of fire can potentially make it a "magic" weapon. If the enemy's health bar drops suspiciously fast, and not at a smooth rate, that may be what's happening.
---
Only under armor I bought from the shop way back then was that Grafton Tracksuit. Usually lackluster choices though. Only use em in Nuclear Winter tbh.
---
Which leads me to the thought...maybe they really only release these kinds of items w the NW mode in mind (aside from camp stuff of course, which isn’t even allowed to be built during a match) lol
---
Me too, but I’m getting to memorise them now..
---
 Although today I had the solo burrows from hell run
---
No one else in the ops team turned up
---
Fell off the bridge into the water,
---
Got knocked off the signal repeater 4 times
---
Accidentally exited my PA .. when I finally got the repeater done I was 2.5 minutes down
---
Then ran out of ammo for my main and 2nd weapon
---
Got it done in just under 11 minutes so had a string comeback
---
I remember seeing it on the map but it was a PVP event, so I didn't do it. Then one day it was gone. Forever.
---
Dude use the tunnel to the left to run downhill, don’t jump down the shaft when earle is about to die.
---
It was a mildly fun little pvp game back in December 2018 when everybody was a noob but now that pvp is broken and full of tryhards its probably good they removed it.
---
That’s not true
---
/s not /s.
---
Sell em like hot cakes at 5k ea.  Usually sit in my machines for less than 20 minutes
---
It's super easy. Create a building or room with a garage door. Wire the door and all the vending machines through a switch. Flipping the switch closes the door and turns off the machines. Done.
---
Right on. Happy hunting!
---
Recently got back to doing the rep grind on another toon. 
---
I’ve tried the Roxie thing and so far it lets u do it to a certain point.   
---
I’ve back out and it autocompleted quest after a couple backouts.
---
Why?  I have a vampire's gatling plasma and I straight up tank boss hits with no damage.
---
Thanks,  currently it is 90% weight reduced and modding it would increase the weight. Appreciate your answer.
---
Thanks, less AP would certainly be nice/helpful on slow fire and semi weapons. Only thing it doesnt fix is auto pistol vs auto rifle comparison since both can be modded to cost 1-2 ap a shot when paired with the lower vats legendary effect. Now if you could get the AP low enough for pistols to not even need that effect, that would be a massive improvement. Not only would it n ope up the third star effect, but it could free up perk points from action boy or grim reapers sprint.
---
That would be fantastic
---
I need some damn combat shotgun skins! I have none, and am getting impatient
---
secret service unless you want PA
---
Very slow rof though.
---
The only reason I don't say PA backpack mods is because I know it will be implemented incorrectly. It will probably take the torso slot away which is by far the most useful. The only way I see PA getting anything close to backpacks is by what I said.
---
But... we already have the Gatling gun. Which is a civil war cannon that was modded to (presumably) be lighter, and to fire 5mm. That would just be a pointless weapon
---
The gatling plasma straight up does more damage at the same roof as the 50 cal.
---
Got it!!!
---
Yep.  It's nice and subtle....and absolutely required.
---
Probably the only item I would actual drop money on
---
I went with just the SS torso one with dense against explosions and one with asbestos for surviving Earl and the falling fire. Everything else my old unyielding leather.
---
There’s so many different secret service ones though
---
I meant backpack mods as legendary stars, sorry.
---
Never heard of it! Will have to check out meat weak today, thanks!
---
some guy is trying to sell the suit at 50k caps and the mask seperatly for 20k, the price gouging is real
---
Those would be nice aswell rn I just trying to get the armor
---
I'll try again, I was looking at clothing and Armor today and the purchase confirm had nothing on it but basic cost.
---
AWesome thanks! the disease cure sounds amazing, im always eating and drinking all the bad things, i never drop any food or drink. Toxic goo, +125 rads? OK Lets drink it!
---
It's probably good for bloodied builds since bugs can get you easier with low health. A mirelurk queen can appear when doing the scorchbeast queen but I think it dies too fast to be able to kill anyone. 
---
I just learned that the wendigo colossus has a poison head so it would be helpful there too.
---
I dunno my bloodied ultracite Gatling plasma would disagree.
---
Often? Make that always (he's in the central row of buildings). The glowing mole miners usually spam missiles, though, so look out for cover.
---
I loved how you where calling cate with his/him
---
No, you'll shoot your eye out.
---
Ah okay, yeah thats the only way. Unless they add a whole new slot dedicated to backpack mods, which I am not against, but that seems like it would be more work rather than just making it able to be legendary.
---
I actually dont mind the repair kits myself my non magic stuff has been breaking more often since the last update and they dont weight much
---
My TS Limb damage Gauss mini kills boss faster than the bloodied version, however it’s not like a sudden drop on their hp bar like some YouTube vids, it’s just a steady chipping away their hp.
---
Start with the basic pieces (chest, arms, legs. Don't buy the helmet). The rest of the secret service stuff is mods for each piece.
---
I took both poison and fire resist perks, (only lvl 1 of fire resist for now though), electric absorption, Take One For The Team, Power Armor Reboot, and Ammo Factory.
---
I prefer the defensive perks and hefty damage boost for bosses rather than more special points. I strongly suspect they will be having more enemies doing fire damage so fire resistance may eventually be a lot more useful than people think.
---
I run unyielding armor for grinding xp. For everything else, power armor.
---
I would absolutely love this. I switch between gunslinger and geurilla constantly. Gunslinger for most of my play and geurilla for harder events, daily ops and boss fights. Have even aquired 2x ve25 10mm pistols , one modded auto one modded semi soni always have a healing weapon on swap that still does decent damage.
---
I was lucky,got faster fire rate legendary effect,my gatling gun really combats the new leveling system :)
---
I would love to see either the backpacks work, or minor legendary effects on pa like reduced carry weight for certain types of stuff. Maybe a different set of effects than regular armor, like reload speed, damage reflection.
---
As it stands your damage can get so high that stabilized hardly matters anymore and so it becomes more effective to go non-pa for more carry weight, move speed, ap regen, armor modification options, etc.
---
Even if it was just delivered as 1-3 mod slots, and you find the mods to install - no patterns, no actual drops of full armor pieces.
---
I have 410+ carry weight outside of PA and 330 in it. I don't even have the large backpack, and I don't have to give up a two cards for food and chem weights if I want to use the backpack mod. (and I do - I carry a shitload of stimpacks).  Yes, I'm more durable in PA, but it doesn't matter how tanky I become *if I can just kill almost everything in the game before it even hits me* as heavy weapons *without* the benefit of stabilized. The carry capacity difference between Unyielding+WeaponWeight + Chem Backpack + Armor Weight Card is an entire order of magnitude difference from what I can get in *power armor, functionally a robot exoskeleton.* Even if mobs hit me, born survivor keeps me from dying before they do. The damage reduction is functionally worthless outside of extreme damage in something like encryptid pylons.
---
As it is when you reach the upper limits of damage output, PA itself falls out of usefulness for general purpose. It does not scale upwards to increase your general wandering or combat effectiveness in any way, and falls well behind a great set of regular armor. Granted you had to grind a lot to get that regular armor, but there is just no long term growth in PA at all. You start to become handicapped by not using regular armor because legendary perks slowly increase the power of your build in various ways, and PA just... stops.
---
So yeah, I agree. It needs some kind of something. I don't agree that it should be straight two star legendary cloned from regular armor. It would be a real pain to grind and it wouldn't really fit the theme of PA at all. Slapping a bunch of mod slots on PA and letting you find the mods to go in there would make a lot more sense thematically in my opinion.
---
meant caster, thanks.
---
And how is that not true? You have 1 shot for each rank, repeats will not offer chance for rare rewards. If you get elder first time it unlocks all tiers and you are done for the day besides getting xp and junk drops
---
Most snipers haven't changed their weapons/builds. Most players, in fact, don't spend a lot of time reading on Reddit and don't min-max. 
---
Snipers are still viable as long as they do things well. And that means using a strong oneshooter.
---
Happened to me twice last night. I took out my camera and scoured the area for so long the next event popped up. I never found the first one and the second one showed up on camera but it must've been under the ground because I couldn't find any corpse/pile/pieces to loot. It's pretty annoying.
---
Everything you mentioned would be better suited as additional "mod slots" rather than perk cards.
---
All four of my heavy machine gun turrets got taken out by a damn mongrel
---
Or in the basement at Camp Venture (technical data drop-off point).
---
Aw, dang it!
---
The problem imo with the 50 cal is it doesn't do quite as much damage as the gat plasma, and the ammo is ballistic, which means you want bandolier and strength is already full for heavy gunners.
---
Oh right so I shouldn’t buy the say secret service hardened armour legs and arms?
---
Pipe is lifeeeeer
---
Pipe life!
---
Yeah, either stars or actual backpacks, I'm fine either way.
---
never honestly used one; just saw captainoob slay w/ one; it is arguably as deadly a lever action/gauss/black powder rifles, but it has large mag cap
---
Honestly the gun you have right now is fine.
---
Camera doesn't always work. I posted about it a minute ago.
---
I drilled a cow,The farmer wasn’t happy about it
---
Ffr helps
---
Oh, yes.  That would be unfortunate.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ikypw9/solod_earl_with_a_10mm_pistol/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Last patch atleast, havent tried with the new damage model.
---
i literally do these and only have to cut one wire and all of them go down till I repower them.
---
Yea I agree they could use some love. I think they should be the "best" at something no other weapon can do. Like, they weigh less...but who cares?
---
Would be nice to see 10mm pistol have faster fire rate that rifles with similar receivers. .44 magnums would be cool to see more damage there, maybe you can aim with them faster down the sights, and accuracy/recoil should be much lower than a rifles as well (except maybe the revolvers/magnums). BUT crosshairs should shrink pretty quick.  
---
I'll still have fun with my gunslinger once a day for the daily ops, but that's about it. 6 rounds on avg to down a guy in a 6 round repeater seems daunting on the reloads.
---
pump as much as you can in int, play bloodied and use unyielding armor, int buffs, etc.
---
probably something involving explosive heavy guns.
---
Desease cures a clutch and you can craft them.
---
I bought one for 2999 caps.
---
That’s my experience too. TS gauss kills boss faster, maybe due to the built in explosive. However their hp bar doesn’t drop dramatically like some ‘magic’ weapons effect, it’s just a steady and surely drop.
---
5 base components. For me, I went with buttressed and deep pocketed mods. And the jet pack.
---
you can only buy mods from the enclave unfortunately... or is it fortunately. 
---
suppose there's no rng involved.
---
if you dont run power armor get the under armor and the shielded lining for under armor for 450 Bullion. It will give you 15 energy/balistic/radiation resistance and +4 strength +2 perception and +4 Endurance  
---
edit its 200 bullion for the underarmor and 250 for the shielded lining (450 total)
---
My point is you have NEVER been able to play halo on a PlayStation or uncharted on an Xbox. But you have ALWAYS been able to play all Bethesda games on xbox, ps, and pc. 
---
My point is yes, keep the already exclusive games exclusive, but don’t take away content from people and release Fallout 5 as an Xbox exclusive, that’s just idiotic. 
---
Personally I wouldn’t buy an entire new system just to play one game
---
If you get this mod you can easily switch between a normal perk set and one for lockpicking and hacking and free up that slot for a card that might be more useful.
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124
---
...and no, using these mods won't get you banned so they're safe.
---
Why is this man being down voted? He right
---
Ive been farming them, ammo for them, and the fusion mag mod to sell cheap with the hopes of getting more into circulation, but this last update and the buffs to enemies really killed the usefulness of a lot weapons I used to rock a auto explosive 10mm pistol for weak enemies to save on my other calibers. But that, my .308 sniper, and my auto .38 combat rifle are all but useless now
---
Get max intelligence and egg head, the mutation and proper mutation perks and all unyielding armor.
---
Tldr, boost intelligence.
---
Oh I know it doesn’t because I’ve lost many legendaries even when using camera. So sometimes I gotta look through camera then put down and look through again and the names will pop up. But I’ve lost mole rats and cave crickets that where. And I always think that’s prob the one time it would’ve been a god roll weapon lol
---
well there's loads of mods. don't get the helmet or jetpack until you have the limbs and torso and mods. buttressed and deep pockets are the best two IMO
---
Quantums replenish a good chunk of AP immediately, grab some of those and put them on your favourite wheel they will help.
---
Those are mods, not actual armor peices.  And when you do get to mods, buttressed is what you want.
---
I just want the Halloween plans again lol
---
Does anyone here on PS4 have some they’d be willing to sell/trade for?
---
I thought they got rid of it because an event about the civil war reduced to robots fighting tourists was too much, even for the tone-deaf at Bethesda.
---
Anti armor, bloodied, vampire is good enough. Explosive is not really needed. If you do get one of those then yes use those instead, however, explosive weapons eat through durability much faster. FFR is also a good choice.
---
You might look for gamerzsoul on YouTube.  He just put up an insane build. 50+ Intelligence
---
I just spent a minute or two yesterday testing the survivability outside power armor and it feels like I only have base wood armor on, it really needs to be addressed or tuned up. 
---
Needless to say I’m fully invested into my power armor heavy build now...
---
Thanks.  Kinda thinking I should go ahead and equip poison resistance on my main and let my 140 alt do the ammo making for both of us....   :)
---
I never suggested these be perk cards. What I was suggesting in what I wrote is that those would be the legendary effects on the armor if they were to do this.
---
I made my new level 4 character claim those items, to get just a little bit of use out of them.
---
Pipe is life!
---
If you're on xbox, I can spot you the plan for your wife. Auto or semi-auto.
---
I think the wood does get taken from your stash. I’ve had it say that it took some from the stash before.
---
Pretty much any special event location, seen it near the astronaut's crashed ship and the little rest area just north of the ferris wheel at Tyler.
---
The Responders are also missing from the atom shop, there was one bundle that barely had anything good in it and a shotgun.
---
the general opinion is pretty much exactly what you described,
---
veterans loving the update
---
casuals and newcomers hardly enjoy the game anymore
---
bethesda knows about the situation and allready assured us to take a look at the topic
---
The Level 50 molerats certainly don't make it easier. At least they don't have the mininukes strapped on them like the moleminer versions do 😀
---
Yep. Durability is shit on any ts but especially on a ts that explodes because each shot is actually 4 damage calculations that each reduce durability a tick. Gunsmith 5 is a must for any tse
---
The Atomic Shop has always been bad. Bethesda tries to create artificial shortages on digital items, so the selection variety is always bad because they have a habit of making certain things timed to try to entice people into buying before.
---
And value has always been equally shit, it's no surprise people rarely spend their stock of accumulated Atoms, because coupled with the artificial scarcity of items people actually want, you're usually always getting a bad deal unless you spend Atoms during a sale.  I feel bad for anybody dumb enough to buy Atoms with real money and buy full-price on the catalogue.
---
Its a great service they provide to us at work.....wishing to be in the wasteland!
---
xbox won't release AAA games for PS5. indie and smaller titles will get released if sony says ok.
---
the thing is, microsoft want to boost their gamepass. i highly doubt that any upcomming bethesda game will get a release on ps5 at any time, they even removed the playstation logo at the official Elder Scrolls 6 press release. It's not about the potential money, it's about getting players to buy the gamepass to let microsoft became the leader for gaming subscriptions which is probably the future like netflix is for movies. Playstation and consoles in general are like cinemas, i assume this generation of consoles will be the last one since everyone has a Tv, Pc, Smartphone, Tablet or anything else with a Screen -project X-cloud will also be included for the xbox gold pass a few months after the console release.
---
Nice! How is it? I've been wanting either one of those or a bloodied war glaive.
---
Buttressed you want. And then mod it with asbestos.
---
I think If you're taking an hour of prep, you need to work on your build. I seldom need help and when I do, I'm the one doing all the damage.
---
Personally, I hope Plans never become account wide.  I don't want to make another character focused around a specific weapon, and get everything but it from the purveyor because I know the plans from my other characters.
---
Everything else is fine though.
---
It sits on a 4x4 foundation space if you try but doesn't snap.
---
Wait, Mischief Night isn't coming back?
---
I traded for one last meat week for a fixer plan and next cook off I got the peppered mod. Then last event I did the night before it ended I got a tendy plan and yesterday out of 5 of them that I did before bed after work only reward I didn’t have that I got was spicy mod. So I believe I just need Tato salad recipe or that one that drops and the salt mod. I’m not to worried about this event this time being they didn’t up the legendary stars for it and I have tendy and all other outfits and stuff and had the peppered mod which is the highest damage mod for it
---
Exactly. Lol. My thought is the same, "Guaranteed VE15 LMG." 😂
---
And the helmet.😎
---
I still have yet to get a legendary drop for one tho
---
It doesn’t have red on power armor. I bought it also thinking it would but it doesn’t
---
i got my ammo factory to rank 3 but daily ops is an ammo factory
---
I’m able to complete it solo pretty easily. Haven’t been able to get elder rank, but depending on the map, mutation and enemy type I’m able to get paladin pretty reliably.
---
It can sit on floor/foundations, or be placed in the ground like a foundation. And if you're enterprising enough, you can use power junctions to place it.
---
Ah nice, I was actually looking for this to reset the loot counter, but I thought it was in Helvetia. Thanks for the heads-up!
---
And you should continue to honor him until the end of time. Why? Because he's a hero FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!
---
you trade damage for damage resistance, seems fine to me.
---
As a Junkie's Heavy PA build post one wasteland, I would have to disagree. With more builds being close to each other, PA is more viable now then it was back before. We have the option to completely negate energy damage as whole, run emergency protocols to slow health drain when you get low, run born survivor, and even reboot with full health upon death. As it stands right now I like my PA way more than regular armor just for the fact that energy damage no longer matters (from most sources). As for damage output, I was never on board with 5-10 seconds boss kills, that is too much. However with what I have, I am able to solo most content in the game and am happy with the time it takes. The only thing PA needs is some QOL stars if it were to be legendary to make it perfect.
---
Being a casual I agree wholeheartedly with you, I’ve found it considerably much less enjoyable now I enjoyed just logging in going on a private world listening to the old radio popping in and out of areas and just plodding on but now I just turn it on 15 minuets later I turn it off....such a shame
---
In PA, use a Kinetic Dynamo torso.  If you’re bloody, don’t swap it for protocols.  If you play junkie or another high health style, you’ll never get slowed down.
---
Don’t use Dodgy for a melee build, unless you have tons and tons of AP and rapid refresh effects.  You need mobility too much.
---
You..
---
You should probably get outside more.
---
New players 1 to 20? Not at all. Throwing knives are amazing at those low levels.
---
20 to early 50s are also easy as long as people don’t go and fight mireluk queens, Kings and other tough mobs.
---
Actually so far I kept all the arms and legs as they have good secondary and tertiary attributes. Modded the unyielding chest with a jetpack, buttressed it and have the fireproof perk.
---
I run my "enclave" build basically heavy energy weapons (AA/FFR) full health PA. A bit of Psycho on occasion but I try to stay as addiction, rad and mutation free as possible. With good enough weapons it becomes easy. I won't kill anything too fast but I won't die either and I'm still good enough to do most Operations solo up til 2nd tier, 3rd usually depends on modifier, bonus points for high int so leveling isn't to tedious. Could I do more damage? Sure, but I'm simply too lazy to farm copious amounts of 'munition and my poor heart hates surprise deaths in a full bloodied build when RNGesus decides to drop a bunch of gutsies and minigun muties right around me.
---
Yeah it’s a shame tank killer change is a step in the right direction though
---
I meant because 15 int. plenty of room for demo expert. and stabilized.
---
I’ve leveled up several characters across two accounts, but none since the update so I have no idea on answers to your question.   My guess is they have significantly slowed down the game for new players.  No more going back to an easy area to farm up some ammo and stims, since everything levels with you.  
---
It might be more important now to pick wisely when choosing perk cards.
---
I only want shared plans, personally.  Im all about building camps and recollecting all the camp plans is a major pain. Especially because so many come at the end of long quest lines I already did on my main character.
---
I don't remember, but there were more than one type. Still getting used to all the new names.
---
I've got friends who just started and are between level 10 and 15. They've been doing fine so far and I've even taken them on a daily ops and to a queen fight. For really low levels, the level scaling works well. I think the real problem is for solo players in that 25-45 mid level slump that was a drudgery before but is more difficult now. You are facing enemies that are a challenge even in the forest which should be easy by that point and you likely don't have an optimized build and/or good legendaries. It's compounded now by the fact that higher level players can't farm lower level legendaries for them any more so they can't even be helped along with their gear. I really think they should level lock the forest back to 30 or put level caps on certain mobs. The ash heap and toxic valley should be harder so level 50 makes sense for them, but there should be a point when the game starts to feel easier in the forest for mid level players.
---
Run daily ops. Enemies drop ammo based on weapon you are wielding. Run on a team.
---
I'm 90% primal meat counts as well
---
No, T-51 is the strongest in terms of DR/ER after T-65. It has weak Radiation Resistance though, but that's almost moot in Power Armor since there's a built in reduction of 75-80% of incoming Radiation when wearing Power Armor.
---
I am and want one ; Justinjay4188
---
The burning effect from the perfect storm is entertaining, but doesn't really do much extra damage.
---
The TS at least gives a 25% dmg boost when the second shot hits.
---
It should as long as you use same Bethesda account when you sign up
---
Nope, t51b is the next in line
---
Nice! Glad to hear it!
---
No, you’re asking for a feature that should have been part of the system.  However one could say that about the baseline perk system so I’m not hopeful for change.
---
The issue to me isn't that it's difficult to gear, but that the best way to do so is dissatisfying.
---
it is literally advertised on a poster at camp venture. that ppk pattern pistol is clearly a commercially available weapon.
---
the deliverer might have been a derivative model, or an aftermarket modification but its not the only one like it.
---
I don't have the war glaive but I'm still hitting 1k and over with the peppered tenderizer, it is also amazing looking
---
I have a level 20. Ran colosal problem and daily ops no problem. 
---
I don’t know what you are talking about. Maybe your friend needs to spend a little time looking at perks and upgrading their gear?
---
If they pick a choose locations that have scorched and other weak enemies they would be fine. 
---
What I seen when they hit those mid range levels is go after mirelurk queens and kings and all the other harder mobs.
---
There are places on the map where you can get tons of resources without fighting at all. In the river on the left most side there are like 10 safes hidden in the water after the moth man town going south along the river.
---
Camp McClintock is also a safe area to loot.
---
Odds must be pretty low then. Guess we both better start praying to RNGesus
---
Assuming not PA, in this order
---
* Secret service chest
---
* Secret service jetpack
---
* Legs/arms (priority on biggest benefit from existing armor)
---
* Buttressed everything
---
* Misc mod of choice for legs/arms  (I like deep pockets)
---
Find a Daily Ops public team with higher level players. Don't stick to your own kind cuz you'll all be struggling. Be sure to have the weapon equipped that you want ammo for and just maybe tickle the enemies a bit...let your team carry you in their loving arms.
---
Ammo Factory was the first one I maxxed out, before realizing what an exploitable farm-fest Daily Ops are.
---
I clear all the enemies w/ a Tesla, spending maybe 2000 cells and getting 1500 back. Then I use 250 shots from my Ultracite Gatling Laser and get rewarded with like 4 full Ultracite Fusion Cores.
---
So broken, so exploitable.
---
&gt; If they were to implement legendary PA pieces I think they should focus more on QOL perks rather then damage perks or damage resistance perks.
---
Maybe I'm not understanding your post correctly due to how you're using the word "perks" when it typically applies to the cards?
---
I have a feeling it will be good for the teased "Interior Camp" feature coming. So maybe it's just them getting all the pieces in place for our little vaults.
---
You just answered your own question, it looks nice
---
I run it on 3 chars and I have like 7 of these haha
---
The answer is simple, really. Game modes. That way veterans get their challenges and noobs and casuals can ease in to it. And If I want to just relax and farm scrap I can take over sone workshops, set up some turrets and know they'll be just fine. If I want to piwer level, kick in one wasteland. They used to have survival mode, which kind of flopped because there weren't a lot of hard core pvpers. But it's been done before...
---
however it won't scrap bulk wood and other junk items to get it
---
From the perspective of a new character(not player) the 1:1 scaling is helping me level up faster while just exploring the forest area and occasionally doing the cookout.  It also provides a challenge that was missing from the early game.
---
So I personally appreciate the scaling.  But I can also understand the feeling of 1 shotting enemies.
---
For stimpacks, healing salves are your friend at early levels
---
It’s not even that hard of an event, doesn’t really make a difference.
---
I didn't know this one, but I hope it still works.  I'll be trying it tonight.
---
NICE! :D   you know, I'm lvl 314 and still haven't launched a single nuke... I would love to, but I havn't gathered the courage. :/
---
thats actually something I'm interested in checking out. I started to enjoy vampire prefix after I stumbled over a Vampire Ultracite Gatling Laser. It's basically invulnerability as long as the cores last. But I was always interested in how this translates to melee... well time to vendor hop for one but it looks like as if nobody is willing to part with vampire weapons. Half the vendors are stocked to the gills with bloodied and unyielding though.
---
Then does that mean that the R91 Handmade skin will be another Battle-pass tier reward?  
---
Not that i have any issues about it being a tier reward that is.
---
Great tips here
---
Maybe take a breath of fresh air
---
Pick up damage in legendary perks. It’s been working like a dream for me.
---
Instigating on a heavy gun...you must be joking.
---
I myself use an instagating gatling gun it's name is kindness
---
Walk up to them and hit repair. Or go to your camp module and hit repair all
---
Find your camp module and repair all. Or go to broken pieces and it will give you the option to repair individual pieces, if you're short on mats
---
Ok i will be on in a while
---
They're remains from opening multiple holiday gifts, you'll see them scattered everywhere along with plans and alchohol. More often on xbox

---
Go into build. Highlight frame of wall. Click repair.
---
It’s a good community I was at rusty pick and a level 20 was there. Don’t know if he was a alt or not but I gave him 100 regular stims 100 radaways couple plans all grenades, some legendaries. I didn’t need them and it would help him out more
---
I think if you need to respond to general suggestions for how to improve the game with personal attacks about how awesome you are then you have some personality issues to work out.
---
It doesn’t appear. The display remains empty.
---
I use a vampires guass mini gun and just sit laughing at the imposter cheap squash while he tries to kill me .
---
Ah, that explains it. The only time I bulk things is to sell. And I only ever have raw scrap in my stash.
---
Instigating on a heavy weapon is not great unless it’s a gatlin gun and even then it’s questionable at best unless you mean like rocket launchers
---
you use explosive weapons? as in grenade launchers? or just explosive legendary heavy weapons?
---
because instigating would be mostly terrible if it's the latter. and if it's the former, two shot would be better.
---
you should also know that some instigating weapons are bugged and dealing more damage (a lot more) than they should.
---
So the things I want to be buying at the moment are Secret service left and right leg, chest piece, right and left arm, it’s so expensive to get it all, 4,250 to get it all
---
Okay got an update on this! They have fixed this internally and have it slated for a future update. So it is coming!  
---
u/omega_nik u/MattyBizzz
---
Nice.. I still get lost in the Burrows 😁🙄
---
Maybe on the gatling gun or plasma caster given how high their damage is... but, yeah... doesn't make much sense otherwise given the follow up shot is just the secondary and tertiary effects.
---
Yeah I also don’t do any melee rolls from purveyor so maybe I could get better luck from that.
---
Is it as unwieldy? My biggest gripe about the the nuclear generator is that it’s a nuisance to wire up in an interior with out specifically building enough head space for it.
---
I've come across a few randomly, was worried at first that I might be stealing someone elses card, but that's not the case fortunately
---
I just started playing, i appreciate how much i feel like I'm progressing through the season rewards. Usually games with seasons force hard FOMO and require 100% attention to get any value of it.
---
I work, i have other games.
---
It does when 2 stand on the drums and nobody helps.
---
It’s so expensive for it all, looking at 4,250 for the basic pieces
---
Install this mod and everything will be fine.
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/144
---
I chose the bright pink/purple one. Meat piles are clearly visible even when fighting the scorchbeast queen.
---
I use this, perk manager, and glowing ores. Using them won't get you banned either since they're purely cosmetic.
---
I’ve always wanted the black bat mobile!
---
Yeaaaaaaah you must be new.   
---
If you face towards the wall(s) that are destroyed, a prompt will show up for you to press the relevant button to repair it. Or, if you don’t feel like repairing them individually, walk up towards your camp machine and press ”Repair All”
---
If they are low but not broken, simply store the wall then replace them. you must store them first, otherwise they do not come back in new.
---
I just saw a level 700 running around with an AB one hitting level 100s whats up about that?
---
I just dropped 5 3* weapons and 15 2* and 3* armors for some random person. Nothing like helping randoms (and clearing stash space)!
---
Hey, you're the one complaining. A lot of players can do it solo or without your suggestions. What you suggested can help, but it isn't necessary to make elder rank.
---
My buddy took a video of hitting the queen for 1100 damage after 22 with a bloodied gauss pistol. I told him gunslinger sucks (not guerilla as I am one) and he took that vid to show me im wrong. It was literally chunking off her health.
---
I would love some new Camp items. Most of the things in there have been pretty lame as of late. I would also like to see more female outfits. I've been using the Nuka Girl for months because I haven't found anything else I really like.
---
Not this year. They are trying to work out bugs.
---
Since the power output is the same as the much smaller fusion generator, it’s apparently older technology and was probably designed for museum themed camps.
---
I played it a few times,It was later cut from the game
---
Yep, and when I start a team or join, jump into the daily ops and wait there until we decide when to run it. Can get elder with 2 coordinating heavily, so I'm fine if we go, but have a plan before starting it
---
The alien blaster will never compare to the ray gun in black ops 2 zombies
---
my problem always seems to be that the event finishes so fast I cannot get there in time. at least with faschnaut we had some time to get there to participate
---
Wtf
---
I’ve been saying this! Why isn’t it a thing?!? When can ya FO 1st players have a chance to claim the other tent skins as well?!?! Just open it already
---
That'd be fun.
---
&gt;didn't die once, as a bloodied build - why do so many people talk about dying so often?
---
are you using PA? or sneaking? there are ways to keep yourself alive. but face taking enemies in regular armor without a plan is a surefire way to get yourself killed.
---
Yeah, it's a grind. You can buy 300 gold per week for 6k caps, and then grind events enough to be able to consistently have the max per day 20 bills for 200 per day.
---
Took me about a month I think
---
Are you sure? I could have sworn it's 2*2.
---
Why do you think it is more often on Xbox? Not like evidence wise, I play all 3 and I think you're right. But like why?
---
Me as well. I normally keep 2 or 3 on me at all times just for events.
---
It does but by definition perk just means something extra, a little added bonus. And in this case I am referring to the stars as perks for lack of a better term.
---
The pipe is life!
---
Personally, I deleted all my old characters and started fresh today, and while it is challenging, it's not as bad as you described your friend's game play to be; then again, I didn't rush through the story, but started exploring and clearing each area in the Forest.
---
I've given up putting effort into the event. Just be lazy, 2mins on a drum  or spit with zero ammo spent and no durability used but still getting full rewards...in fact I often get there early and AFK for several minutes.
---
If you're going to be an asshole at least have the balls to not rush and edit your comments when you get called out.
---
I like that actually, forces me to smell the roses and not miss out on locations/worldbuilding/neat things.
---
I also have a compact CAMP blueprint for when i really need to make a deposit
---
There's no way. I was using an AA SS shiskabob in the DO on a lark, and was still killing mutants in 4-5 hits. Completely unperked.
---
Yes!! That would be amazing ❤️
---
Aye. And thn you also need the legendary modules. And then you need RNGesus on your side if you want specific bits of armour.
---
Yup, just loaded in and laser turrets don't proc the effect. Kinda disappointed because you don't have to worry about the turrets walking up on you while you're swapping fusion cores lol
---
I’ve heard that it’s silent as well,so that could possibly appeal to some people?!?!
---
instigating with higher fire rate is buggy - you basically build your build around a bug which could get fixed at any time which would decrease your damage output similar to non legendary effects. only the very first hit does double damage, if the enemy is full live - using explosive is even more dumb since if there are two or more enemys nearby the explosive trait will damage them slightly, which makes instigating totally useless.
---
instigating is good to solo farm common enemys with hard hitting single fire weapons, which are rare as heavy gunner.
---
wait warner bros?
---
Jeez, how do you go about getting that many caps a week? I have 11k atm but it’s always going down
---
Looks like Bethesda does some rounding. In game, .308 gives 53 in instead of 54 and .38 gives 80 in game instead of 81.
---

Song long as you're pc the saves go back and forth. It's all one atmosphere. The difference however is where you have your 1st sub and where you buy/gain atoms. Those are bound to the area you have them in. So if you have 1st on bethesda launcher it won't work in steam; vice versa. Atoms gained in steam won't show up if you log using Bethesda. Any cosmetic items or things bought/earned will be available everywhere.
---
To clarify I've been using a Instigsting explosive .50 cal and deal an insane amount iof damage, I also use an instigating explosive LMG and Minigun. I push a tom of damage and everything dies within a couple of shots. The bugs I do know of, and I consider it the same thing that was fixed with bloodied builds in the last patch.
---
It's not fixed yet, so I'm using it 🤷‍♂️
---
It's how I like to play, and I was wondering if anyone played the same way.
---
Best thing about Collision Course is that the cargobot drops don't despawn, you don't even need to run the event yourself because half of the times you show up there will already be 2-3 crates there ready to loot.
---
Higher level enemies = more XP.
---
My team was comparing level ups since 22 last night and we all agreed that we are leveling much faster than before 22. We are also getting the repeatable one multiple times in one night just playing 2 or 3 hours.
---
Just went there for the daily, lucked out and found 3 level 60 glowing ones outside. The rest were level 75 Dredgers and Skullcrushers.
---
u/ladydevann Any word on this yet? It’s happening to me now too. Very frustrating.
---
Yes. They eventually declined the offer.
---
The Skype purchase is weird since they've basically replaced it with Teams at this point
---
Which ones? Im only really using the Ammo Factory.
---
what system you on ?
---
You are gonna get a lot of snobbery from this sub because you don’t have a min maxed or even somewhat optimal weapon, but you are leaving damage on the table.
---
Instigating is great for two handed melee weapons or guns where you are attempting to one shot, but for heavy weapon, non meta builds you are gonna want anti-armor, fire rate, limb damage etc this increases the dps over the length of your attack and not just the first shot.
---
Toxic Larry's, should be a handful of Glowing Snallygasters
---
Consoles then maybe, PC then no thanks!
---
[this is the build I'm currently using](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=a27ae49&amp;d=cm2cu0ic4i12la2lt2a80a01lu2ce0ck0sr2s32sq2pq1eu0ee2ek1xa2s60x83l22l71s72x41s12ir2xp1xl1c62sg2&amp;m=01c2febd6i&amp;am=182731-182a31-182a31-182a31-182a31&amp;wp=w7&amp;wm=14&amp;n=burn%20west%20virginia)
---
I run around with a bloodied flamer and just melt the world. I usually don't run nerd rage and run with power user instead just so I can bust out B FFR UGL prime to kill off scorchbeasts, or mobs I don't want to be in melee range of like mirelurk queens or super mutant behemoth. It comes with the juicy experience benefit of doing area damage so you tag literally everything for experience - granted you can get that with an explosive weapon too - but unlike explosive weapons you don't have to care about stuff being in your face and you can just absently pray and spray your fire goodness everywhere.
---
If you want satisfying single shot THUNK, use the cursed harpoon gun (flechettes) and swap blocker for lock and load. You'll get off about one shot every 3 seconds, but if you vats target whoever you shoot you will oneshot almost anything. Scorchbeasts, mirelurk queens, behemoths, similar super high hp mobs will take 2-4 shots instead of one. Harpoon gun will run ammo positive *always -* you can shed harpoons whenever you're over 100 and literally never have any concern about running out. Playing with the CHG exit vats and mash the reload key until you see ammo hit 1 - Sometimes when you get damaged it stops caring about attempting to reload until you manually hit the reload button, so doing it that way you'll never run out of AP nor will you run into this 30 second long "Why the fuck isn't my gun reloaded yet i'm mashing the trigger?" problem.
---
Flamer will run big ammo positive in ops and rapid drain anywhere  else, and it breaks noticeably faster than the harpoon gun or ugl - but you aoe everything down so it doesn't really matter that much. I use grenadier because I want that perk card or thrown grenades to hit a huge radius for tagging mobs for the experience gains. The legendary perk card itself does basically nothing for damage. Realistically it's a relic from using the CHG and using the flamer I could ditch it and grenadier for glow sight.
---
Unyielding is the ideal primary mod basically only because of carry weight and wanting to sprint forever. The perception and ap are a bigger deal for using the harpoon gun. *You can run anything you want on armor otherwise.* I don't use PA because I use the chem backpack and carry around 300+ super stims to let born survivor make me invincible unless I get one shot somehow. I'm targeting Unyielding / Poison Resist / Weapon Weight just because I want to carry all the items ever and not worry about poison.
---
My level 300 card would be endurance to grab more HP, aqua boy, fireproof. That's not really needed though, hardly anything does explosive damage. Cars, mutant suiciders, dead robots, and scorchbeast screams. Just don't stand in the explosions and you'll be fine without fireproof. Been debating moving something around to get white knight so my armor doesn't break as often, but the perk card combo makes you so durable it doesn't really matter much if  a few pieces of your armor are broken for hours at a time.
---
I use mine when others use theirs and just play a bit longer.
---
It there because if it wasn't people would ask for it. Like most of the rewards, and many Atom Shop items its no improvement just different.
---
Ah yes. I can appreciate this. I’d be happy with pre made gear plans we could even build towards.
---
Create the team. Even if no one joins you get the benefit from Herd Mentality and people usually do join, especially daily ops teams
---
if you are on pc sell, and how much you want? ign Chris3633
---
You can start at Vault-Tec Agricultural Research Center and follow the river up collecting bloodleaf and soot flower. If you have the green thumb perk it’s really helpful.
---
instructions unclear, added 'contractor kits' to the atom shop
---
Glad to hear it! 
---
Mutant Hound and Glowing meat are easy by just running West Tek or any other Super Mutant location. The hounds will drop both. I tend to run into enough Yao Guais when just running around playing the game, but to stock up, my favorite place is the railroad tracks just west of Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast. There are two that always spawn right there. Lastly, for the Sheepsquatch meat, there are a few options. One is to just run Free Range whenever you see it pop (and it tends to pop a lot). I run it every time anyway since I'm still trying to get a few of the weapon plans. Secondly, you can farm Sheepsquatches in random encounters, but with Butcher's Bounty/Super Duper/Good With Salt, you tend to have so much after a while that you don't really need to spend much time farming anything.
---
And if you want to make the gourmet stuff with the big bonuses, just plant some mutfruit and carrots in camp, grab starlight berries whenever you see them, and stop by Helvetia and the Wayward from time to time to grab pepper.
---
PS4
---
Thanks for the interest but it's already sold
---
Dude..... I’ll agree with you that Beckett is the least annoying of the allies but... what?
---
Apparently the mask is the hardest one to get or that's what I hear
---
"Usually" sometimes you get 5 to 7 mirelurk kings instead.
---
Thank You,
---
nothing was 'fixed' with bloodied. they nerfed all damage across the board because of a change in how bonuses are calculated.
---
magic weapons on the other hand are 100% unintended and will be worthless once they're fixed. so you might want to have a backup plan.
---
Smack me daddy. Throw your giants rocks at me. Come on, stop the ground with a massive ground pound
---
For legendary perks, Follow through and if you like to group taking one for the team is huge
---
no need to be in a team, friends accidentally forced me into pvp on my private world without any teams.
---
It's a spawn point for multiple types, I've only had snallys and liberators and I'm level 311
---
How much do you pay for it?
---
But why make it harder to get?
---
Is it a daily to kill glowing ones or cryptids?
---
And auto will always out DPS semi auto builds, not even close
---
I'm still sticking with rifle as I can enjoy the game and keep up just fine
---
Typically snallys for me too, to clarify.
---
Thanks. Any significant difference w rifle vs commando?
---
Never heard anyone say it was fixed. They all showed that they still worked
---
Did they fix that? I remember testing that awhile back and the speedy receiver + ffr was the same as the receiver by itself.
---
Whew buddy, apparently you guys take this game a lot more serious than I do.
---
I kill stuff fast...
---
It's a bug I knew about...
---
I was curious if anyone else did it.
---
I have fun playing a video game, my bad folks.
---
No, it's a weekly to kill 10 glowing enemies
---
With nukashine liquor filling 😁
---
I did my glowing enemies in uranium fever
---
Also- antibiotics
---
I just want the outfit, I don’t care much for the gas mask
---
It might also help if I had more budget. Hard to justify buying more camp items when I cna't even place them. It feels like the camp budget is designed for the weakest console on the market, despite the fact that I play on PC.
---
Ah thanks
---
they were not fixed in the PTS, though. unless it's in the *latest* PTS.
---
ok np
---
Okay, one trip to Blackwater Mine also works then :-)
---
Wow, the fact that you took the time to run it up the chain and get some info speaks volumes. Much appreciated, you’re alright in my book 😎
---
Just got my plans last night. Haven't crafted yet work is work. Can this be used in P.A?
---
You were fine 
---
This dude is being a whiny brat because he can't read and got all personally offend by something you didn't say and would have been your opinion to have even if you did
---
Additional damage in stealth and if you get shot at. Don’t remember the names.
---
True, but these guys give you acid (around 10 per)
---
all rare rewards have the same odds of dropping.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y7YtULG-9k5u5GD6swiIwBVgxspA3Qg6IzLQpJqeNRQ/edit#gid=0
---
How? I don't see this option in the power armor display or inventory screen?
---
I currently have it at rank 1 as well. I'm not entirely sure if it's just me but the health regen and the fusion core recharge seem to proc separately(health regen may have a higher rate). When I was recharging a ton of cores(had 4 super mutants with semi-auto lasers), my health would constantly bob up and down. It would range from "slowing" my health loss a bit to fulling healing me. As for the cores, the 10% seemed about right. Whenever it did recharge a core, it would fill up at least 10% or so each time it activated.
---
Correcting me 😭😭but you type like you got Parkinson’s disorder not wasting my time on you here psn :talkinmonk if you wanna Handle this
---
True
---
Great news! Thanks so much!
---
I guess my cranks it alot faster
---
Let me add that if you create a Daily Ops team, once you're done Daily Ops, leave the team or disband it. I've joined 3 different teams in different servers today and all the members are off wandering around. I still haven't completed today because I can't find a team that's actually doing the bloody mission. Argh
---
That helped, thanks
---
I keep getting the mask.
---
Apart from the trip sniffing the pipe restores health too.... Pipe is Life
---
a lot of people do. it's not exactly a secret, nor is it a build. you're just abusing a glitch and... that's it, really.
---
personally I can't get them to trigger. but more importantly, you do realize your 'build' is gonna be hitting like a wet tissue paper once they're fixed, right?
---
I think it's silly to invest so much in something that's clearly unintended and bound to get fixed. but you do you.
---
How's it feel? Do you use the explosive perk?
---
"Works on my machine"
---
Its steam coming out of Modus' butt.😎
---
Yes. It's a 2h weapon
---
It sucks doesn’t it? We feel your pain as we’ve all had our play styles “adjusted “ at some point along the way. I feel like there should be a disclaimer before you start this game that things will evolve and be adjusted as it goes on just to warn people to not get too attached to their build. Try a shotgun build. Kills in a couple shots and ammo is easy to come by.
---
Having 3 people on drums or 3 people on spits gives a small bonus. Better to have 3 on drums vs 2 drums/1 spit. 6 people on drums/spits will make the bar not decrease during the event.
---
Maybe an SOS system a la Monster Hunter World? One player starts an Op, sends an SOS and other players can see the sos list from the ops menu. Joining an SOS automatically adds you to a daily ops team so you get the team bonus.
---
It's probably the game, not your graphics card.
---
I only got 750 bullion for completing vault 79.  What did I do wrong?
---
Electric variant is a 'Ji' from ancient china. Look it up.  Has nothing to do with European stuff. Naming the polearm warglaive instead of some stupid chinese weaponery is a no problem for me. My problem is, it looks something straight out of chinese mmo and I don't think it belongs in fallout. Literally there are weapons like this everywhere in chinese mmo not kidding. Looks exactly the same. Makes me feel like I'm playing some shitty chinese game and believe me, you don't wanna relive that experience
---
try going to abbie's bunker, go to her terminal and read the fort defiance entry. it just worked for me
---
I remember it. It was removed becuase people could initiate PvP with pacifists.
---
I've always wondered, thought it might be non p.a because of the animation
---
It's a video game I play in my free time at night. If it gets fixed it gets fixed.
---
I thought games were meant to be fun. Fallout doesnt have a competitive scene. Nor will it be around forever, I'll have fun with it while I can 👌
---
Its at a fixed time every hour, head there somewhere between :55 and :59. Waiting for the popup may be too late.
---
A lot of these acquisitions are to integrate features into their existing platforms which I’m sure they did with Skype... another example is google buying Waze For $1 billion, a lot of those features have been integrated into Google maps
---
What all actually displays on wall mounts? Really wanted to display a series of daggers, rippers, and chainsaws, but none of them would go onto the short display boards.
---
I don't think anyone here is a bot that got a 3080.
---
To answer your question: I play with a 2080 Ti; a 3080 would be more than enough for 1440p. I am typically above 100fps at max settings only because of how... janky... the graphics engine is.
---
Nah. The only thing the different animation effects in pa is 2h weapons with a medium swing speed like the pitch fork. It makes them swing at the same rate as a slow
---
Well I guess that's fair. Never got to try it last year, so I was looking forward to this one.
---
If they had a Fragile crate storage box skin that would be great
---
Get Tank Killer. It now applies to pistols.
---
I'm at 270 as a gunslinger since beta. It's not meta but I do ok and have fun. Main weapon is a JE western revolver.
---
I enjoy it. I really didn't know if you used anything other than the super top tier damage output builds that youd get burned at the stake lmfao. I do use the explosive perk as well.
---
I really didnt know fallout was taken so seriously, or maybe I'm just not a die hard gamer anymore. The instigating bug dodged patch 22. Which I'm thankful for, when it gets patched I'll find another way to play 🤷‍♂️
---
I'm finding myself very frustrated with the Gauss rifle to the point that I'm probably going to dump my prime two shot (level 45) the next time I log on.
---
Between charging and not firing, aiming issues and problems with VATs its just not fun anymore. With Meat Week going on I am reminded more of its shortcomings than ever. With new changes to damage I can't even edge in some boosted damage. It really makes me sad.
---
He/she did.😎
---
Pipe is life! I love the pipe!
---
I gave a guy a few legendaries yesterday and 100 stims some radaways ..I message him a few mins later if he had a mic.he hadn't moved much on the map..he got on his mic and was like"im over encumbered "took him at least 15 mins to get to his camp.
---
I'm confused... why do I not want to get the SS helmet?
---
The market is insanely stocked on them, they're cheaper than the other platforms just to get rid of them
---
I had a very similar situation I'm 136 but there were some level 300+ running it on repeat for people that haven't got the &lt; 8 minutes.. I had cycled in and out of worlds for at least an hour before I found them so.. thank god for them
---
I don't know if you're just showing us the available weapons or these are your everyday carry but if it's the latter, I'd drop all but one of the three from Gauss Rifle, Lever Action and Hunting. All aren't great but the lever action is the least worst. Quad is pretty much useless on anything not an auto fire weapon.
---
The rest are fine. Handmade is decent for what it is and the gauss shotgun, while far from idea is at least lightweight.
---
Do events, loot everything, sell stuff to vendors (they give 1400c a day). Put items up in your camp vendor, especially ammo you're not using. Cheaper items sell quicker. Most people sell their excess ammo at 1c each - certain types will sell higher at 2 or 3 each. Some won't sell to anyone basically ever, the weapons that use it just aren't really used; .38, .44, syringer. The explosive ammos (mini nuke, missile, 40mm) are basically only bought in order to cycle through the ammo machine and thus despite being rarer are not generally worth more than 1 or 2 cap depending on who is staring at your vendor. Personally I will buy all the explosives at 1c but not at 2c. Full cores (plasma, fusion) will move pretty quickly at 50c each. I personally buy the ultracite fusion cores at any price up to their full listed price in game (162 i think).
---
Legendaries can sell too, but if they're not highly desireable roll combos they won't sell for much value. I list 1 star unyielding at 600, everything else that isn't 2-3 star unyielding or two shot, explosive, bloodied or some combination of those for 100, 225, 400 and 60,135, 240 for 1 2 and 3 star weapons and armor respectively. Someone who doesn't want to grind to get scrip, or who is looking for their initial set of gear will scoop that right up out of your vendor. Except during meat week (right now) where there's just tons of legendaries being sent out from all the events and people are actually playing them and not just logging in for the scrip reset.
---
No fucking way.
---
Launch your own nuke.
---
I still run it pretty frequently.
---
Probably wont get fixed unless they learn that it somehow benefits camp builders.
---
I definitely didn't say that was the only factor but assume as you'd like, I'm not gonna sit here and argue about something that's pretty obvious. A sidearm is going to do less damage. That's how they work. Smaller caliber rounds, small magazine, basic fire rate, altogether means not a lot of damage. Its not rocket science. Don't like the damage you're given when using a clearly weak gun, don't use it.
---
5 of the legendary perks cater specifically to melee.  And you can still stack buffs.  Melee is fine, as long as you can adapt.  If you can't, go heavy gunner.  You'll never run out of ammo with ammo factory perk so it's a lot more fun now actually, especially with explosives.
---
Is it legendary scrip? Think looks a bit like a micro chip?
---
To be honest, I’m more likely to get bored when I’m limited so severely than when I’m allowed to just grind however much I want at a time. Think of it this way, why play more than an hour or two a day when that’s all it takes to do your various daily tasks, it doesn’t really add up to a lot of playtime. However, if I’m allowed to grind as much as I want I would find it fun to spend an entire day doing so which is going to be more playtime in one day than I would have in a week. Remember, forcing waits isn’t really effective, casual players will hardly ever notice and more grindy players will only get bored when they can’t grind.
---
Toxic Larry's Meat-n-Go.
---
It's been turned off due to people being able to stack its buff
---
They disabled it almost a week ago because of an exploit that allowed players to stack the buff indefinitely.
---
I’m disappointed, I wanted hanging torches around my camp.
---
The game would be so much better seeing the two of them out and about, occasionally fighting each other too..!
---
They had a candy bowl in the atom shop last year and for the MN event they were placed all over whitesprings
---
Lol its almost like you don't understand the console wars and that these 2 companies are directly competing against each other
---
Sure ok whatever you say dude. lol.
---
Where is that?
---
Or maybe Bethesda could make a Red Rider skin BB gun as a reward for Christmas related quests.  BB gun does 1 damage and will ricochet back at you.
---
Good to know
---
Those are what I am carrying. Planning on dropping the Hunting Rifle. Thanks.
---
I think it's more like you're blissfully ignorant of the ins and outs of the game.
---
Energy weapons in general need a buff or to at least making it worth using them.. They break faster then any other weapon and have zero perk cards that directly refer to them.
---
Yea that would be it, I've only seen it pop up. Couple of Times and its breif. What does it do
---
Hmmm I never get cores from them.
---
Up grading gear should be #1 when I made a 2nd acct I loaded him up with legendaries to scrip.1k at the purveyor 50%off sale got almost a full set if 3 star vanguard and level 15 mutants hm and a mutants combat rifle.got me through to level 35 pretty easy with this last patch
---
Oh, didn't know about that. I could have been he-man for a day. Thanks for the quick response.
---
I dont know I kinda hope they do a new christmas tent. How boring would it be if every year they just had the same design for annual events...
---
You use it to purchase legendary weapons and armor from the purveyor..
---
I ditched my turrets months ago because they almost killed my deathclaw
---
T60 PA with emergency protocols and dodgy equipped, so I just went full tank on the whole place.
---
Shhhhh... Keep the plasma flamer secret or they will nerf it to lazier rifle stats.
---
Thanks.

k sure, I don't care

you'll see.

*laughs in 50 cal ammo that doesn’t drop in any meaningful amount from ops*

I've swapped out of rank heavies perks and just use r1 instead having that extra flex power for say junkweight or pain train is the biggest brain play I've ever made.

Color really doesn't help us as much as the words would.

Yeah I really wanted on of those suits. I thought it would be cool.

The bash damage and armour piece trigger stopped working on PTS, the others were ok.
---
Why not just put Dense on your chest piece and sacrifice one mod for a ton of perk slots.
---
I think peeps just keep borking the math.  4 foundations in a square.  2x2  but even I mistakenly said 4x4 before. Simple mistake  given that its 4 tiles total.

What, you don’t like Mothman bundle after mothman bundle after mothman bundle after mothman bundle after mothman bundle after mothman bundle after mothman bundle? I’m the minority there dude. Everyone wants more mothman bundles? Enclave or Brotherhood stuff? Pfft. Nobody wants that. Nobody at all. Not a soul.

It's a huge pita. I've had to fully exit the game to get it to stop. Seems to happen everyday the first time I earn score

exactly. the only way to be 'tanky' as a bloodied build is with PA. try it in regular armor and you'll be mowed down.
---
unless you're sneaking of course. or have some esoteric build to work around the damage.
---
320 DPS is enough for me idk about you lol.
---
Apparently it doesn’t help against airborne diseases and that so it’s pointless
---
PIPE IS LIFE!
---
Oh right, isn't that place over run by blood eagle tho
---
Yes, please! It will fit my NA pistol build.
---
I had a similar thing with the playing guitar bit of a tent that someone despawned. I was stuck sitting and playing. Was hilarious to see my sliding around like a squatting M.C. Hammer.
---
Read the note on the table, than head NW to Berkley Springs station, aka the old home of Mumbles.
---
Yeah, those and assaultrons are the baine of my existence
---
Graham also sells rare plans.  You can server hop to refresh his list:
---
Plan: Domestic Kitchen Tables
---
Plan: Metal Picnic Table
---
Plan: Mirror Ball
---
Plan: Park Bench
---
Plan: Radiation Emitter
---
Plan: Starburst Clock
---
Plan: Stone Benches
---
Sold a spare one for 1234 caps (on PC)... Yup, my prices are insane, but I don't get many walk-in-customers in the mire anyway.
---
Nope, you're thinking the blood eagle inhabited portion of Berkley.
---
Toxic Larry's is a static snallygaster spawn. If you're a high enough level, they'll always spawn as glowing.
---
Well, if it was on something like a Broadsider that fires slow where one hit should be all you need.  I found an instigating Fat Man (technically explosive damage) and have been playing around with it, mostly for fun.  Actually wipes out groups of enemies in Daily Ops.
---
Died on the way back to his home planet.
---
I’m honestly hoping that they rerelease the Vault-Tec workshop from Fallout 4 so we can build our own mini vaults underground.
---
-If you are having trouble earning your 1400 a day from vendors, farming purified water and stimpacs to sell to them is very doable. 
---
-On top of that even just one vendor at your camp selling the ammo you dont use for 1 cap each usually brings in a steady amount.  
---
-Always do Manhunt mission at the dam when it pops up (120 caps) 
---
-Always be on a casual team (you get caps when teammates finish quests) 
---
-There are routes you can look up for caps stash runs, if you do this make sure you rank up and equip the caps stash perk card, fortune finder perk card, and if possible pop a Caps Bobblehead.
---
I use pneumatic because I hate long staggers. I have nightmares from beta of getting locked in a constant sequence of staggers once one starts, which doesn't happen with pneumatic.
---
If I was using an explosive weapon, I'd consider dense. If anything I'd probably use the endurance card and move endurance points to agility to get white knight. Dense and Fireproof are seriously not even worth considering unless using an explosive weapon in my opinion. Any source of explosive damage from NPCs is either avoidable or such low damage it's not going to hurt you enough to get past born survivor anyway.
---
The main reason i was considering going after fireproof was it was reaching a point where I didn't really have anything left that I especially wanted, and I was considering running around with a gauss minigun or shotgun if I ever got one that rolled well. The flamer is just.... really good.
---
I've got a 2 shot broadsider and I'm sad that its not that great.  Does about as much damage as my explosive gatling gun and breaks in 20 or 30 shots.
---
That’s just the game, I have RTX 2060 super and it’s running fine on most area in the game just frame drop on Foundation and the centre of Watoga
---
I found 3 level 100 in Huntersville and outside Westtek, unequipped  adrenaline rank 1and the rank 1 tank killer card I use. No stealth/sneak, open showdown western style.
---
Result:  SM1 took 4 shots, SM2 was a one shot for whatever reason (2nd in a row in one vats session, so gun fu triggered probably), SM 3 was 3 shots.
---
For the record - headshots, and I crit on every 3rd hit. No idea why the 2nd one died so fast though.
---
No problem, I’ll even stay there the whole time while I’m AFK working :D
---
Free one has yellow lights. They aren't very bright tho which is kinda sad. My camp is in a wooded area that's kinda dark most of the time. Was hoping it'd pop more.
---
Look, Bethesda is gonna bug the fuck out of SCORE points somehow. This way is better than not getting the points at all. Beggars can't be choosers!!! /s
---
Oh, is it the place where you find the holotape of the run away teens being hunted by a sheepsquatch
---
You had me worried for a second there :)
---
Yes and I am having a ton of fun with it. For a game with a million combinations of ways to play. Pretty blissfully ignorant of yourself to think anyone is wrong If they're having fun.
---
I bet you're a shit ton of fun at parties.
---
*laughs in 2mm ec which i am drowning in cos it takes 1-2 shots to kill something and i get 8+ back)
---
Anything a pistol can do a rifle can do better. Not only do they need a damage buff, they need a perk card that gives them a unique advantage. Like gun runner, but actually let it stack with speed demon. Or maybe let their crits do significantly more damage.
---
I have garbage equipment now. I followed a few 200's around doing events and I leveled up too much lol.
---
With the base perk system it makes more sense not to allow it as it reflects a more organic progression of your character learning how to adapt to the wasteland overtime.
---
Where messing up your build would eventually improve over a period of weeks.
---
Messing up on the legendary perks tho could leave us majorly hosed if we didn't research them properly.
---
Or worse sank every perk we had into perk coins.
---
Tho if they make perk packs a more common reward  then should be able to pull away from it being months to fix a gargantuan mistake.
---
You will want buttressed for main mod on all pieces but misc is all your preference.  You use legendary modules to craft the non PA so it gets legendary perks that's why I did it first
---
that's what she said.
---
It isn't their title they're selling... the publisher is selling the title dude
---
ZeniMax makes more from selling the games than Microsoft will ever make. ZeniMax are the people who would benefit the most from selling their games on both consoles.  
---
 
---
Microsoft makes more money from people buying their console for exclusive titles, lol.

Man, I stacked 5 rad emitters next to a laser tripwire and it goes from 20-100 rads a second. Hard to even get away from it sometimes. It's awesome.
---
the only things i feel should have been account wide the whole time are the scout badges/progress, plans, and rep. everything else being character based is fine by me tbh.
---
I've sold 3 from my vendor for 6666 each.
---
I never said that you're wrong for having fun 😂
---
in fact, what I said, verbatim, was 'more power to you'
---
my point is that you're completely unaware of the Fo76 metagame and culture in general. which is 100% fine, but it's still a fact.
---
you should know that a lot of people despise magic weapons though, because they rob them the chance of tagging. I don't care one way or another, but a lot of players do.
---
Can confirm; my camp is right next to the astronaut’s ship; I get a random spawn every log in and it’s the pipe once every other day
---
wait - why is mischief night cancelled?
---
Lmao I had an incredible experience yesterday, I was in a random daily ops group and one guy, after the mission finished, reached me and gifted a lot of stuff like plans, legendaries and ammo. I asked him why and he just told me he loves non toxic players, this game despite his problems has the best community I've ever seen in a game since I started playing online
---
my alt account's main character knows literally zero plans because i wanted to test this and the amount different things i receive as legendary rewards, having not even completed a third of the main quest, is extremely diverse.
---
the only things that seem to affect it are fixer plans and stuff like that from events. everything else is very much receivable without learning anything.
---
Omg I changed you're to your. Did you want to go full grammar Nazi on me?
---
This was so helpful! I did have to cash in about 4 of them to have enough, but I have dozens. I never thought I'd need them because who needs dozens of ski outfits?
---
It sucks that atoms is not account bound but it’s storefront bound instead.
---
Needs another zero.
---
Valseek (I think) commented or posted it was cancelled due to persistent performance issues that they couldn't or didn't fix since last year. 😞
---
Lucky. Past 2 days I've got nothing from elder and it's making me mad
---
I gained 2 the gutter plans in 2 days lol
---
It's the same as any other weapon. It cam have any legendary effect a melee weapon can have. I got a vampire one 2 days ago.
---
there are several ways to do it, actually.
---
Full sentinel does wonders with the right perks, the only thing trucks me up is poison
---
I've done it every day since the start of season 2 and absolutely nothing
---
Not like this is a limited time event. Be patient.
---
It has cool little electrical effects on it. -shrug-
---
New players have always (well almost always) complained it was too hard. Asking for tips, help or advice. The game has that threshold where the game gets easier, for me it was getting enforcer but in general it's when you get fireproof. 
---
 Don't get me wrong, I can see slumming it in the forest to build up a surplus of ammo and meds isn't that easy anymore.
---
Now that's painful. I dont get why it cant just guarantee one singular rare item daily for elder. Its stupid
---
Shut up
---
I think it needs to be primed and tag the end boss with that weapon
---
Since nobody has mentioned them (probably for good reason) I'll talk a bit about the explosive heavy weapons:
---
The auto grenade launcher isn't bad if you invest in demo expert and get an instigating or two shot one.  I can kill most non-boss enemies in 1-3 hits with my instigating one and using vats makes it easy to aim.  I use it a lot to clear out the hordes of enemies in daily ops.  People are always selling 40mm grenades for dirt cheap so I've never had to craft ammo for it.
---
The fat man can be a bit of fun (again if you get instigating/two shot).  Just isn't good for general usage unless you are constantly finding large clusters of enemies.  So far every non-boss enemy I've shot mine at has died in one hit (post-patch).
---
The missile launcher seems to mostly be garbage.  It seems to break way too fast and doesn't do enough damage for what it is, IMO.  To be fair though, I don't have an instigating/two shot one like I do with my fat man/auto grenade launcher.
---
The broadsider is also very disappointing.  It just breaks too fast and doesn't do enough damage, even with two shot.
---
Mutation serums that you craft can be resold to a Vendor bot for 500 caps. So if you buy flux at the average price of 150, make the mutation serums and sell for say 333, it profits you and anyone buying it to make more caps.
---
I jumped on my level 25 and breezed through multiple scorched and super mutant locations without dying. No legendaries or damage perks either.
---
Metas are for people who lack uniqueness in my mind. Maybe I took your criticism the wrong way because I'm so against doing what everyone else does. It's such a blank slate of a game, why waste my hundreds of hours being like everyone else? If it gets fixed then hey, I'll still have fun. Just wont be a heavy damage dealer. All good on my end, theres always ways to play.
---
A guy posted last week with his 3080. He was a 53 fps.
---
boom. roasted.
---
Its silent. Do you know how much I hate the noise from my generators? Also it looks proper high-tech not like something cobbled together out of some 200year old engine.
---
me too!
---
53FPS at 8K resolution I hope. That's terrible FPS considering the 3080 has a 20-25% increase in rasterization performance over the 2080 Ti.
---
I'm afraid magic weapons kinda are the meta though.
---
Make multiple characters
---
Mine is still in place, its next to a nukashine keg. People will drink all the booze but they wont touch the candy, ya bunch of alcoholics !
---
I don't know how much it would add really. Interaction with other people is very limited. And there's plenty of folk on each system to do the events.
---
The only thing I could really see it doing is bringing some new stuff to the markets since the different systems have different legacys
---
I have like 40 agility with food buffs and unyielding armour, since I don't use ap much the perk does wonders
---
I wear standard X 01 if that helps
---
You wont want to hear this, but the last 2 days I have completed the Daily ops I have had 3 plans each time ( I did get nothing every time I did one last week though). 
---
Honestly the RNG is this game sucks.
---
Hope you get better luck very soon.
---
I'm the inverse on buying gold from smiley. I'm at that bastards desk every Monday for that 300 because it's an extra day and a half of gold. Especially is someone only gets to play once or twice a week, it let's them get a decent chunk of gold in their pocket fast.
---
Isn't one of the simplest ways just using PA to phase through the wall in the room right beside it?
---
I dont know why.  But my friend 2 punched the SBQ because he had 100 strength.
---
where do i shop for one?
---
I’m designing a large bunker atm, and it would be wierd but cool to put one or two of these inside it for separation purposes
---
Where do the vertibird squads launch from? Was forced into a new camp location the other day and a whopping 5 squads showed up yesterday. 
---
I don't mind the nuke cards, but I'm trying to build a camp here can I have 5 minutes to think in peace???
---
And maybe they are, I just happened to find one I liked. I play with the sane two people every night and we just kind of wing it. We have a blast doing it too. The backlash I got in this thread proves I dont play like others 🤣🤣🤣
---
Doubt it, the pipe shotgun had to be bought in fo4
---
Lol really? I thought the rest were specific places like in the forrest. Could have done this ages ago. Thanks!
---
Harpoon guns as well. Got a mutant slayers explosive harpoon that is now legacy
---
I don't think you'll be able to socially recover from this.
---
I put mine under thecement less geo dome, you have to put foundations around it and 1/3 of the way above the ground
---
I-I haven't the slightest....
---
You get them in the end report rewards if you use a weapon with cores at the end of the op
---
When you've done 80+ Fasnacht before getting your first rare mask then you know what a B**** rng is. This DO malarkey is easy, just 1 day without a rare so far.
---
Where did you find the plans?
---
Don't think they have a base. They just kind of appear. The nuclear keycard carrier ones are spawned by Modus on the Search and Destroy quest. They usually travel North from the waterpark down to the South to the Hornwright estates area or the Ash Heap. I camp below Vault 76 and rarely see them.
---
Well of course your opinion is your own, but there are literally chinese agents in FO76 already.  It wouldn't be my first choice but I don't hate it.
---
This, I’ve been farming toxic Larry’s meat forever!
---
Pulled the whistle in the dark plan on my first go through.
---
They drop off of daily ops, if that's what you're asking
---
Happened while playing banjo on someone else's survival tent. Left me in a sitting position scooting around meatweek. Three guys thought I was hacking and attacked me repeatedly. Had to restart game to fix issue.
---
It needs QOL stars particularly in the way of carry weight. Without access to the legendary carry weight effects regular armor has, nor access to the backpack and their carry weight mods, nor access to the strength bonus  of unyielding, power armor can be fairly quickly dwarfed in that regard by regular armor.
---
The freed economy from ditching a carry weight card for the backpack effect itself is nothing to sneeze about.
---
Emergency protocols are nice, and compensate for the loss of serendipity. However EP runs into a problem - it activates below 20% and born survivor at its lowest triggers at 20%. Running born survivor (and I'm not sure why you wouldn't, really - it's a huge boon for survival especially in heavy weapons with spin up times) means that you're not really benefitting from EP except when in danger when BS is already on cooldown. Serendipity starts at 30%, which means you're already benefitting from it before BS kicks in, resulting in a noticeable jump in effective survival. Granted, this in a fairly noticeable way is offset by the built in lower damage intake while in PA.
---
Reboot is nice, but I'd have to give up something else in my cards to even use it. Follow that up with the need to carry cores to power the armor - even if you don't use a gatling laser - with the lower carry weight potential in PA and your inventory capacity is at even more of a disadvantage.
---
The negation of energy damage coming in with that legendary perk would only particularly interest me if it worked on the ticking damage from pylons. Even then, we're again talking about using legendary perk cards that we could otherwise use for stat cards, presenting a further potential deficit in build strength.
---
Add to it AP regeneration - Ap regen legendary effect in regular armor can dramatically dwarf the potential of power armor. You can shrink this gap by using a chest mod or leg mods, but this comes at the expense of either emergency protocols or *even more carry weight loss* \- an exchange regular armor does not need to make at all.
---
Power armor has its strengths, but it has a weakness in perk card economy tradeoffs, and a peculiar deficit in potential inventory capacity. Adding legendary perk analogues to power armor, *especially* in the realm of inventory weight management, would make regular armor the less obvious choice once you reach the top of the damage output plateau.
---
I really **want** to like power armor, but I run into such a massive inventory deficit by using it in exchange for survivability that I didn't even need that it becomes hard to justify it after a certain point. Plus -  I don't get to galivant around in the fancy event costumes I pick up, and *fashion* is an incredibly important part of the game.
---
You realise how many aid items you get from Daily Ops? In 2-3 runs I've amassed 70 Radaway from carrying none.
---
Don’t the settlers and raiders wear a lot of atom shop stuff?
---
No mention of the explosive flamer? That thing is a beast with huge range and good damage. Also it lights corpses on fire making them easier to find
---
What if I told you pistols are for when you run out of ammo with your actual gun and dont have time to reload, and that's why they weigh less and do less damage. Because, you know, sidearm.
---
That’s awesome!
---
Mind explaining to me the WS loop?
---
They might. But aren’t their cosmetics available not in the Atom Shop but as a DLC to the game in the actual console store?
---
What's up with people liking dogfood so much, I'm lvl 180 and never saw its charm
---
I think the benefit is more for if you have friends who happen to just play on a different console. I generally agree with your point, but I do know there are some PS4 people I would totally play with if I could.
---
With the perk Good Boy it does wonders for me and it never spoils.
---
Keep not caring but at least take time to learn what an actual console exclusive is. Comparing halo and god of war to a game like fallout or gta, is just idiotic
---
Anyways with all these people yes instigatinng on heavy weapons works for the first few shots for a heavy weapon since wastelanders not including the magic effect.  
---
If you are a full health power armor build then I would recommend blocker, fireproof Rank 2, rejuvenated maxed, tenderizer, and for your power armor that would go kinetic Dynamo with dodgy and action boy. Ricochet is good to if you can fit it. If you're a low Health then definitely emergency protocols. And nerd rage.
---
Is it from the brotherhood stuff?
---
I think this is the killer feature that can convince me to swap to iPhone lol anyway is this made with jailbreak tweaks?
---
Dude there are what... less than 10 rewards? Getting 2 out of 8 days isn’t bad. You’ll have them all before you know it.
---
&gt; I’ve seen a number of posts about changing the HUD color from yellow to a player selected value (or traditional green)
---
In FO76? How?
---
Yeah I got the game after they removed it I was pissed.
---
Once you get a unlock elder, you don’t get any more rolls for rare treasure no matter how many times you further get it that day. So you only had 2-3 sets of rolls at rare rewards.
---
Rng.
---
Im currently playing with a gtx 1660 ti but it runs smoothly with the right settings.
---
I move mine constantly. When you have events out in BFE, it’s good to lay out down so everyone can at least access storage instead of dropping.  I’d definitely love a way to scrap weapons and armor though at a minimum.  Otherwise it’s easy enough to lay it down, go home to fix, then come back.
---
It’s made using the shortcuts app on iPhone :) there’s a few guides online that can show you how to do it step by step
---
You're definitely doing something wrong.  It should have taken way more attempts to get what you wanted on those other pieces 😂
---
I paid for the one before realising it was actually free the next page down  :(
---
I got one every single time. Anyone want three brotherhood masks?
---
I haven’t been over there recently. Did he really leave a note? Awesome.
---
Why does it matter tho? Would those agents be swinging around them polearms while wearing them stealth suits? Hell no. Have no idea why people think anything chinese is okay in this game cause of some chinese agents. Yeah let's get those chinese C-pop playing in Appalachia radio then why not. It's perfectly lore friendly cause chinese agents
---
That's awesome
---
Halo called. Wanted to talk to you about how Microsoft makes games better for current and future players.
---
I leveled and got score at the same time and it triggered on me. I had to close app but I had to finish prime cuts and a cook out first. Talk about a pita with that in the middle of my screen the whole time and hearing the lvl up sound just teasing me.
---
Wow.  Better than i thought.  Thanks!
---
There is a vendor in the ash heap who lets you turn it in for legendary gear.
---
Happening to me no purchases it has no cycled through all 26 levels 5 times now non stop
---
yeah.
---
i like the idea, id allready be fine if they added some more usefull mods to PA
---
pretty much add in mods that do similar things to what you described as set bonuses,
---
that way bethesda could still sell their skins while adding more options for PA
---
My rng is pretty good for scout armor. I got a lot with various weight reductions but I charge a lot. 
---
However if you say the word (and are on ps4) I will set aside 1 and 2 stars for you for a 200caps each piece. 
---
Can't guarantee they'll all be one or the other forest or urban.
---
My elder rank completion didn't even reset today so that's a cool thing that happened
---
Legendaries aren’t necessary at all at that level. Definitely makes the game easier, but unnecessary.
---
Yeah, I think it does, just.. like you, not 100% positive.
---
I remember doing this when I finally got the plans for the jetpack on my power armor several months ago. Its a shame they haven't done anything with it.
---
Both. I’ve seen them wearing stuff that I own.
---
Nope.  Tried that early - camo is murder on my vats build.
---
Yes
---
Yeah, I should have put the spits/drums at the bottom, or detailed that they just slow down the failure, not really make things go forward (except during the 2 minute pre-show).
---
its too early to talk about challenges. They have the capabilty to screw and unscrew it.
---
Haha! Yeah… I actually found out in reverse order. I fast-travelled to a region, spammed the photo button until I got the reward, deleted all those duplicated photos in the Photo Gallery, and then repeated in other regions. It wasn't until I got to the Forest region and felt confused why that method wasn't working that I realized that one actually has a sub-list of specific locations.
---
I do know that but regarding laser weapons, I might have fired one less than 10 times.  
---
I have several of the larger rifles looking to see how they feel. I also have all the Commando perks so I can switch to that easily with those weapons.  
---
I've never used Ultracite ammo. Ever.
---
I've been playing for almost two years and I still struggle with the naming conventions and knowing what is needed for what. I wish there was a better in-game ability to "zoom in" and get relevant information about what a particular piece or "recipe" is good for.
---
you have to inspect the power armor chassis the armor is mounted on and there should be a "rename" option.
---
As a builder most of my items I want to see done are CAMP related.
---
1. Stairs that actually fit with the look and feel. Corner stairs made of wood I.e. the same found in all interior homes in the game already. Also bay windowed walls since they also are in the files, windowed and not.
---
2. More run down looking walls and floor items. If people want a shabby raider styled dwelling they should be able to make it. Everything in 76 for the most part looks a little too fresh which I don’t mind but a quick addition of run down versions of everything would be amazing. Broken barn walls, patched wood walls, faded exterior paint on contemporary walls, a simple trash covered floor/foundation similar to the carpet, tile, plank styled pieces to give the look of clutter and use.
---
3. Stylized roof interiors. If we are stuck with pretty walls and floors why not make beautiful homes have something other than roofs looking like a hobo did your ceiling? Even if it was simple, a nicer roof interior set similar to how wall paper would go a long way.
---
Weird, I see /u/KonkretneKosteczki agreeing with you on this. I could have sworn I've had times where it told me I didn't have wood, and I always have wood scrap in my stash. Is it possible it pulls from scrapbox (which I don't have) and not scrap? Or am I just wrong/confused?
---
Dang that's crazy it's almost as if it's a rare reward and not a you get it every time reward
---
That's an excellent question - I know when I use my +Limb Damage LMG on the Queens head, it does massive amounts of damage.
---
So it’s not a jailbreak? How did you do it?
---
oh that is cool. ive only been playing for maybe half a year.
---
PTS isn’t open yet
---
Is it just me or was this nerfed recently?
---
Only getting 500 shots now
---
Previously had 999 shots available with Power User x3.  Unequipping Power User and then equipping gatling laser again shows only 500 shots.  Equipping Power User again while galing laser is equipped doesn't increase shots at all.  Unequipping Power User while gatling laser is equipped actually drops shot count to 250.  
---
So, either it was never intended to alter weapons and they stealth fixed it or they accidently broke it and it's now not working as intended.  In either case, this pretty much renders Power User useless if you don't use PA.
---
I had that happen to me last night at the same time I levelled up. It's annoying AF. I just quit the game for the night anyway.
---
Yup, I agree.
---
Vault 51 - that the Nuclear Winter Vault.
---
Supposedly, they have content coming to make it explorable.
---
We already have a side list of players in your world when you’re looking at the map
---
If you're being serious I'd like one if you're on xbox lol
---
i sold one for 40 caps, and will have another one up at the same price when a slot fees up...
---
That's Vault 51. The Vault referred to in Nuclear Winter and location of the lobby before you start the game mode.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault\_51](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_51)
---
False.  X-01 is far better than Ultracite.
---
Ultracite is only barely better than T-60 and T-51 smokes all three.  T-65 is the best, but it's locked behind 6 weeks of grinding for bullion.
---
Both my nephews play on Xbox and I play on PS4. It would be cool to run around the wasteland with those little turds.
---
Look at your rank. If it shows anything other than x/100 (like say, 31/1) it will run through the animation for every single rank in sequence when you gain score.
---
When you start the game from fully closed, at the main menu ***before you enter a world*** look at the bottom right of the screen where it shows your rank. **If it shows anything other than x/100 - such as 1/1 - open up the scoreboard and wait for the board to load.**
---
It should then update to your current rank and x/100. The bug will then not happen. Doing this method I have not had it happen again at all.
---
With the Microsoft deal, you're more likely to get XBox to PC play...but I sure as hell don't want it.
---

Based i feel the same about Sophia
---
Did 3 of them yesterday and we had to keep yelling at players to come back, they run off chasing baddies and make the progress slow down....
---
Yup, super duper fun!
---
If her daddy is a shotgun build he is in trouble 😁
---
Yes?
---
So then why is it hated by so many?
---
I’ve heard rumors
---
I didn't even want one, and yet there it sits taking up space alongside the BoS suit. WHERES MY SOLAR PANELS!?! Oh well, at least I finally got my Telephone Booth...I mean Symptomatic today..
---
So fun, and complex too- you’ll love it
---
Can you use them to dupe or something?
---
It’s a magic weapon. Instigating plus explosive makes a lot more guns beside the mini gun a magic weapon. Anything above fire rate 100 will do if explosive.
---
Oh man, nothing made me remove one of those legendary perks for exploding enemies than watching a 3 star ghoul go ragdolling into the sky in the mire at night and not having any idea where it landed.  Fuck that.
---
That's really cool! I'll probably try to do it on my old iPhone 6
---
Take one for the team legendary perk is currently bugged
---
yeah, since I just learned that the points from Legendary Charisma do NOT count in regards to sharing perk cards, so now i wasted 150 points for nothing when (if i had known....say the Legend CHA card had a "These points do not count in regards to sharing perk cards" on the bottom of it) I could have say shifted 3 points from elsewhere and grabbed a different SPECIAL legend card to account for the shift....but nope....now im down 150 points cause Bethesda cant be bothered to add a simple line of text.
---
Enclave Events - Bots on Parade &amp; the Orbital Strike ones...9/10 they give you a piece of Scout Armor as a reward (non-legendary).
---
Regular mutants yeah, but the boss barely feels my bloodied sledge.
---
I don't think so.    
---
In reality it isn't. Since there are perks for increased limb damage and crippling then it likely adds to that.    
---
My Sniper and Shotgun chars have the perks for that maxed (not Legendary one) and it procs quite often. I can't count the # of times I've crippled a group of 5+ only for them to do that Hollywood sideways limp and I could crawl around them and not get hurt.
---
Wow really, Im using the perk myself can I then just shoot someone and do damage?
---
I didn't compare them to  Fallout or GTA you dumb fuck. You're the only one whos even said those names lol. 
---
Sheesh I can see talking to you is a waste of time. You're blocked now.
---
LMAO I love the tinder one- fire load out
---
Fun!
---
That diving suit is theorized to be obtainable. There was a big thread ages ago talking about it. Would be cool to see a secret quest or a secret puzzle that leads to it.
---
I will kill you with teddybears
---
Depends, is it an Ultracite Laser gun or a Laser gun with a prime capacitor. If it’s the former then it should accept the base fusion cells.
---
limb damage doesnt increase your damage itself, but the damage to the limb
---
every enemies limb has its own "health bar"
---
once that health bar is down to zero, the limb is crippled
---
its not adding to your damage, unless you use a shotgun in vats or a fast firing heavy weapon
---
in that case you will do extreme damage but thats not intended, its a bug (so called magic damage)
---
Idk but they can do it to you if you’re on a public team without pacifist on
---
1500hrs+ on 5 characters and I can quite confidently say - No its not fun. 
---
...its Addictive!
---
I've gotten a rare everyday so far, today was the first time I got multiple rares from it. They weren't anything great, 2 vault 94 jumpsuit plans and the valley Galleria signs
---
There is a packable cooking pot and it weighs 12$ a month!
---
Same for me, either it’s not 80% or i’m just damn unlucky!!
---
That’s one of my favorites too haha :)
---
Damn its like survival all over again then, lol
---
Congrats! I'm still a nuke virgin.
---
I have a couple of ideas. First: multiple map markers that you can annotate so I can remember where unmarked locations are. Currently I take photos on my phone and label them. Blood tick hut etc.
---
Second: track world challenges on your pit boy instead of having to go to the map.
---
Finally have verdant season pop up on screen on matter where you are instead of having to be in the area.
---
They could just have the game check your current caps upon a purchase attempt.
---
If the sale would put you over max, the item isn't sold and instead the buyer is presented with "Trade Failed With Server, Reason:Cap Limit Reached".
---
Ah that’s the older emote glitch maybe? Happens in or out of Power Armour. 
---
On Xbox press start then y for photo mode, b b to back out quickly and you’re free. Annoying but it’s the quickest way out
---
Agreed man, I feel the ability to have a build mode view for more strategic placement would be a huge bonus. Not just a build mode from our characters perspective.
---
Nope, I guess name dropping is frowned upon so Ill let him be anonymous
---
It would be cool but those icons make no sense for their apps
---
Yes, it makes every limb, also the head cripple faster, you're enemy will lose perception and you are more likely to hide from him.
---
yeah REALLY wish the Legend CHA one actually told you the points dont count for sharing perk cards....otherwise i wouldnt have wasted perk points on it...thanks Bethesda.
---
I would look for a QE double barrel shotgun. They are not too expensive to trade for. Your handmade is already optimal, even for a rifleman. Only thing that could be better is the second perk. FFR or explosive is meta for AA guns.
---
same here...    
---
for me was it the   UNY - R.Arm ,   
---
i have wasted \~ 50 moduls \^\^    
---
.. it looks like that ONE part for an complete set  is much harder to get as the others ?! ...
---
I'm camped near there, and I hear it every time I return to camp.
---
It's obviously a BoS thing. But I'm not sure why it plays at Pleasant Valley / Top of the World, because that's still a fair distance from the BoS observatory. A bug perhaps?  
---
It doesn't play over the whole Savage Divide, despite a lot of people initially assuming it did.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/UyJd3JE.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/UyJd3JE.jpg)
---
Congratulations :)
---
I don't remember. I don't have ammo either way since that char uses ballistic weapons and ammo.
---
I got one of those cursed harpoon guns and with the flechette mod it seems to work like a magic shotgun in vats and does crazy damage
---
Are your settings set to Pacifist?  His/Hers?  Otherwise.. Glitches happen, and they are common. Normally Level 50's and up are typically even outside of the equipment and perk availability.  If you are a new 50ish and he/she 350.. you are still at a disadvantage from experience and weaponry/perks.
---
It's 6pm.
---
I simply kick them out of the team, they can farm for ammo solo.
---
100% agree with this! With so many points of interest it would be amazing to work out my own system with a few coloured marker drops! this would be amazing
---
DayZ right there haha! I'd like it IF they made the rest of the game realistic.
---
There goes part of the deam of being a true wanderer. Much sadness
---
Meanwhile there is probably 1 lucky guy out there who gets non-duplicate rares on 5% rolls every day until he has all rewards.
---
Used to be
---
I’ve gotten the outfit twice FWIW. I sold one to a dude who did 5 runs on his characters so take my RNG with a grain of salt.
---
"I know a place you can stick that fire hydr-"
---
Yeah, let me personally call every one who has ever left a negative review for this game.
---
You serious with this question?
---
Help your friend find some power armour, a good melee weapon, equip one of the auto-stim perk cards, and pharma finder.
---
Before getting into a firefight or dungeon diving, put on power armour and hack and slash through scorched, ferals, molerats, etc.
---
You might be right that it’s too hard but it could also be that way to encourage cooperation with low-levels.
---
I’ve had random high levels gift me tons (RIP my stash capacity) of stuff.
---
Not sure, maybe because it’s buggy? Maybe because ol Beth made it a MMO, instead of Solo RPG, or maybe people just like to hate and complain... I’ve been playing fallout for years and years, FO4 is one of my all time favourites.. FO76 is just great too!
---
The communists sent a dog. We sent a cat. Dogs are communists confirmed.
---
lol, happen to me also the first time, i was willed by my own nuke too.
---
Being a heavy gun build for about 500 levels, always go back to my 50 cals because of the mag size, fire rate, ammo crafting, durability and lack of spin up. 
---
The other options all have things that I dislike.
---
Any of the spin up weapons have to restart their animation if you get staggered, and sometimes even unload themselves after a stagger. You also can’t stim yourself until they stop spinning unless you break the animation by switching weapons or bashing. It’s just a pain in the ass. 
---
Energy guns have all have a spin up delay AND leave a ton of partially charged cores in your inventory. There are work arounds but it becomes more trouble than it’s worth when there are better alternatives.
---
Gauss minigun is pretty strong, but again it has a spin up and the ammo crafting isn’t as efficient as 50 cal, and for some reason the ultracite 2mm ammo weighs a ton. (Twice as much as regular 2mm) Probably my 2nd favorite heavy gun, because once it gets going it hits super hard for sustained damage. 
---
LMG’s shred but they’re also expensive to feed even when primed, and you’re constantly reloading during boss fights. 
---
The other heavies can be great in certain situations but the 50 cal is good for every situation.
---
The game forced me to hit on Beckett
---
simple :     
---
PA glitch - then jump high to the round window , that u see in the backround of your pic ,...  
---
\*timing is the key ;)
---
It is.
---
Well ricochet deflects it and the absorption heals you. So it's a win win
---
Yea probably a duck move on my part to name drop.the guy was literally flying around and shooting everyone so I shot back and instantly got K,Od
---
Good to know. I know I hate running around shitting my pants.
---
The only thing I use the Perfect Storm for is to mark Stealth Boy players in PvP. Two Shot makes the 10mm Sub and .45 Sub horribly inaccurate.
---
Oops - sorry. I’ve seen a number of posts of people *requesting* that from Beth.
---
I have no idea what to sell either, I used to have a few weapons vendor characters, but business dried up bad a few months back. I got rid of my vending machines, haven't bought anything from a vending machine for a long time either.
---
Welcome to the dupers club.
---
Yeah that would help. If fallout 1st weren’t so expensive it might be an option.
---
It’s a free weapon you find on the ground , let’s wait and see what legendaries look like before we start freaking out about a weapon that has zero value. Until we get a alien invasion event I don’t see the point in even caring about that trash anyway
---
Thats some good logic. Serums have been mentioned multiple times. Now i just have to learn the recipies
---
Why punish the buyer, when the seller is the issue?
---
I mean how upset would you be, if you find your god roll in a vendor, have the caps to buy it, try to buy it, but it wont let you b/c the seller doesnt have cap space?
---
If it happened to me, dont blame me for the nuke I launch straight at your camp.
---
XD
---
Great! Thanks for the info!
---
Imo, it’s alright for now would be nice if there is a raid again in game since I never actually attempted any
---
Pipe is Vita.
---
youre welcome 👍🏼
---
I didn't mess with the extra SPECIAL legendary perks. I've lived with my builds long enough to be comfortable with them. The only regret I have is two ranks of ammo factory, I should have finished funky duds
---
ore go too The White Springs Mall ,... there u find all Vendor bots from Apalachia.  
---
besides the ne that u obly can trigger by one of 7 posible places/randome encounters!
---
I could barely muster the strength to type this post.
---
Why so you need anyone’s input to make your own determination on what is or is not fun?
---
This is more of something to give me a task other than event event boss event event. And show off my camp.
---
Ahh sweet. I’ll switch to one then. Thanks!
---
It’s not.
---
Almost everyone is a member. We need a big stadium to hold a gathering at this point. If you have ever owned a meta weapon of any kind, there is a high likelihood it was duped.
---
Would really love it if the legendary perks were more so aimed at legitimizing various weapon builds that are largely currently unviable in end game content.
---
Sounds like you aren't using a two handed power attack weapon.  Instigating +40% power attack will solve your melee woes.  Incidentally, that's exactly what I have been stockpiling since beta.  For a sweet low price of everything you have, I can provide what you need.  Limited Time offer, restrictions apply.
---
The fact he/she answered with that makes me feel this post is a troll post started to get people riled up.
---
Spoiler alert.
---
Ugh yes. I spent my first upgrade not knowing how much time was committed to getting the coins. Nothing wrong with it, I just wish I knew, I never would have leveled up the lockpick perk to 2
---
People act like the reward needs to be as good as any other, I would be happy to receive the sub level 50 loot list plans on the 20% of the time you don't get the ops specific ones, that would at least mean your dud runs would have a chance to give a few different semi rare plans like the t-60 plans.
---
Oh good information. Thank you. 
---
I was just running dense on a drop before I got a new mod for it and really liked it. 
---
I also hate the staggers. Does that counteract Yogi Bear’s attacks too?
---
It does but hasn't been a big issue for me. However if you've been working on one to get to a goal and switch that can be an issue
---
Finally, someone with the guts to bring this up.
---
You're likely correct.
---
No. They already plan on removing food and water debuffs, hopefully they’ll remove diseases too
---
Just turn on pacifist mode. It negates the bug. Also, if you don’t want to do that don’t go on a team. That’s the other half of the requirement for the bug.
---
It was an issue for me since I play on gamespass but Microsoft own the IP now so I think FO76 might stay in gamespass library indefinitely
---
Most Def.
---
Had a couple of friends who “mysteriously” came into thousands legendary modules. It took 900ish rolls to get a god tier three star unyielding chest piece. It’s RNG and there are many possible combinations. Just keep trying. And there is nothing worse the rolling a god level vanguards piece on your bloodied, with no way to move/trade it.🤔
---
I get that both are nice, im just wondering if ill lose out on charge and healing if i equip ricochet  because it will reflect instead of absorbing. Or if absorption checks first then ricochet checks second
---
Probably you've already done but save this for the next time, above Grafton dam on the river sides there are a lot of mirelurks that even if they don't display the name (at least in the Italian translation) they are actually glowing
---
295 myself, not completely out of the loop in pvp but not what Im trying to make my build 
---
I did try to see if it was the «take one for the team» perk that made it a bug and it would seem that is the problem 
---
(Tried it with my GF, no griefing) I think thats very interesting tbh its litterally a potential free for all going on atm then, watch your junk if you use that perk!
---
In an alternate universe where stealth is enabled on primal cuts: 
---
OMG another broken event why aren’t the creatures coming to me??? We just failed the 3rd primal cuts because we couldn’t find the stupid gulper!! thanks BADthesda hopefully Microsoft guts you, my day is ruined
---
Thanks I didn't know where they were. I have only seen them about an hour ago.
---
I love when I drop nukes and every so often there's that sole survivor just standing in the middle of the blast radius. I yell at my pc telling them to GTFO knowing they cant hear me as I watch them die and spawn at Drop Site V9.
---
I’d love to have my T-65 get legendary effects!
---
I saved up and was super excited to accidentally purchase a SS armor mod 😂 instead of the actual armor.  I gave up on grinding for it now.
---
"What's going on here?"
---
The pieces are picked at random. Feelings don't enter into the equation.
---
When the Sheepsquatch Imposter dies near the water and so do you, so you respawn without seeing exactly where it died so you start crouching and searching all over the water, but then it its not even there because an explosion made it fly somewhere else and then you can't find it because it's camoflauged well
---
You can still put it on the t65 arm if you have camo paint.
---
Not until they make it possible to put it on the favorites wheel. =/
---
That's the fastest way
---
Since the update I haven't seen anyone run colossal problem so I decided to nuke it and well with 5 minutes left in the event we finally got it down to half heath and then it refilled
---
My Alt keeps getting better drops than my main.
---
Okay! Thanks for the replies, again Im not upset about the event was just worried some hacker were roaming about on ps4, I find this very interesting tho, obviously this is terrible because of griefing but I get serious survival vibes out of this and if it becomes common knowledge pvp just got a little revival I think
---
I'm loving all these stories of people with bloodied builds qqing about their glass cannons getting shattered.
---
I play on PC. I don’t know anybody who would want to cross play with PC, filled with hacked items and players.
---
The free shit is the only reason to visit.
---
It should affect any stagger that makes you stop moving and do the stagger animation. It's a little weird because there's two types of stagger - one that only happens in third person. The big stagger that happens in both is affected by pneumatic, doesn't matter what caused it.
---
The third-person-only type I believe is also affected by it, but I have not tested it specifically. I just blanket throw it on and don't even pay attention due to the *trauma* of staggers. Try it out and you should notice the difference pretty significantly and immediately. Since using it I've never been stagger locked - the worse I've gotten is face tanking 4-5 mobs trying to revive someone and not being able to finish the revive animation.
---
You need to put that on a site somewhere...you’d make bank!
---
Yw, was curious myself because I usually don't count shots in the heat of a battle (and vats beeing vats with lots of misses at 95%, so I recorded clips and counted later). Anyway, gunslinger isn't half as bad as people describe it but still could use a boost to bring it in line with other builds. Probably just fixing vats would do, heh
---
They need to let those.of us that were effected by the bug when first added, re-roll. I do t care how much they buff it, a level 25 weapon is never going to be worth anything.
---
PC - so no luck there, and yes I have no use for them. Maybe I put one on my Camp Follower but I like to see my character.
---
If you’re on pc I can help you out sometime
---
I’d buy it right now
---
True, but it doesn't hurt to give them a win when they get it. May encourage them to keep winning.
---
Interesting
---
Ye, sorry
---
That's what I mean. I have both maxed ricochet doesn't  effect the absorption at all so you're fine
---
I leveled up Legendary CHR not realizing it doesnt work for sharing. Feels bad man
---
So this is what Humanity has been up to in the Fallout universe? God...
---
It’s a good question that I don’t think anyone has the answer to.
---
I went thru 77 modules for my right arm gl
---
No 17:00 I looked it up, that's 5pm
---
You should just quit Reddit now and become a hermit. This black mark on your record will follow you everywhere.
---
thats my thought behind it,
---
for example, shotgunners arent really doing all tha much damage to the queen, but they are still somewhat usefull by keeping her wings crippled
---
it could really help to make more builds usefull im quite tired of cheesing through the game with my stealth commando but struugling to do a viable gunslinger for example
---
Make it a mausoleum
---
I can assist after meat week bbq add tekilla53233
---
Haha thanks! The best thing is anyone with an iPhone can do it for free :)
---
It’s likely that FO76 would have crossplay at some point between pc and Xbox not sure about PlayStation tho
---
In your pip boy on the status tab, the screen all the way to the right shows all the currencies you have, names and amounts.
---
Mine still doesn’t work. In fact it’s been bugged to the point where it starts downgrading itself from shielded to resistant and lower. Trying to make and mod a shielded one again showed I didn’t have the plan, which is false. Idk if I’m alone in this but certainly check ur stats when ur swapping it off and on.
---
And you won't really take any damage of energy. essentially you'll be over powered like me cause they both proc and when I take damage it goes to the core
---
So what you're saying is jumping on bandwagons has consequences?
---
It is objectively weak.
---
This is the dream! Congrats :) I am hoping to get lucky and score the outfit and trade up before they become common and worthless
---
Highly doubt that.
---
I read a post yesterday about a guy making one that people were showing interest in so he slapped in on a few places and by the time he woke up the next day he had made over 5k
---
Only thing I can recommend is renaming the chassis to something that will be in ur view when u open ur inventory.  So u don’t have to scroll to find it.
---
Yeah, that is for sure good advice my problem would maybe come when we are talking about new players to the game that dont have anyone to help them getting scared off.  Certainly hope it does grow the community in the sense of helping new players.
---
Do dailies still auto complete? I haven’t been playing for a while but thinking in give it a try again
---
Well, it's meant to be used with all the building pieces from the Vault Tec DLC from FO4.  However, for whatever reason, they've just given us the power generator from that set only which doesn't snap to any of our current pieces.  It's puzzling on it's own but hopefully it means we'll get the rest of the pieces (floors, walls, etc.) eventually.
---
I'll take the suit off your hands. Lol
---
I always open them before ACP or Queen fights so that my team mates benefit from them. And they stack!
---
I only have Electrically Charged at Rank 2 and Ricochet, at rank 3, was causing it to trigger a lot less often whilst trying to recharge my fusion cores.  
---
So for me until I can max out Electrically Charged I will not be slotting in Ricochet.  When Ricochet triggers all the damage is reflected and I get zero energy absorption.
---
People are lazy and would rather pay the $.99 or whatever than take the time
---
Oh I’m fully aware that extra 300 gold a week is amazing. Like you said yourself, some people don’t get to play every single day, so it saves them time and having to do events to get treasury notes. 
---
I work from 10-10. So I usually get 2-3 hours each day which is enough in my case.
---
The blue ribbon shows your bond with that player. They have one for you as well, you just don't have one with yourself. Make sense?
---
Fucking hate him now tbh I mean he was ok but after hearing his same fucking lines over and over and over I DONT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOUR DREAM OF THE MOTHMAN
---
Damn. Really appreciate it and would have taken you up on it, but we're PC lol. Thanks anyway man
---
Got the solar panels yesterday. Fun fact, you can put a turret on top so you have a selfpowered lasertower now you can place pretty much anywhere. Or hang a searchlight on the pole - best of all no generator noises.
---
You gain the bonding bonus after a bit of time being a part of that public team. You'll notice a blue bar going up above your teammates names on the lower left. Once that's full your bonded with them
---
I'd expect better from a raider. That's weak shit right there
---
Fair enough, I think a lot of difficulty is in learning a new game as well as a harder difficulty right out of the gate.  I know when I started it took me many hours to learn how to do things like workshops, and where to farm resources, or how to farm power armour. Maybe they are trying to get players to slow down a bit and now power through the story but I think as is for super new players it may be a little to hard.
---
Better question is to why is the 10mm SMG not only light for being a rifle-class weapon, but it's mods are *incredibly* cheaper to craft than both the 10mm pistol's and any other rifle weapon
---
I love doing daily ops, but she hates it for some reason lol. That's a good point about the Hardened Receiver. Probably just have her keep that on until we happen to get another Prime plan
---
/u/AFUSMC74 - it's all up to you now. Make me proud.
---
Yeah, very much this. The fastest I've done solo was something like 8:20. Just having a single person actually stand in the capture zones with you is more than enough to complete the elder time if you're on point about getting from place to place and killing the last group of mobs. The only time I have issues completing elder with +1 is because the person is off in nowhere land and not getting point credit, *or keeps dancing in front of my fucking face somehow and interrupting the activation for zone despite me being in first person view and dry humping the object.* I'd like to thank your fucking elbow for contributing an extra +20 seconds to the time.
---
I use those perks as well but still sometimes get squashed especially if AP is fully drained. What’s your DR/ER any other necessary perks?
---
I’ve heard otherwise
---
All my bloodied builds survive and kill just fine.  
---
Why so much hate for a way someone plays?
---
Ah so I don’t see anything above my name? I thought it was an indicator of ‘all members are ‘bonding’’ and therefore we can see a bar above everyone for evidence of bonding. But if it’s something that other people can see (my bonding) but I can’t see my own- cool. Feeling slightly less shit!
---
The user experience is actually different enough between pc and console that it would make playing together problematic.
---
Absolutely a good point, I just know when I started I was very unsure of how I wanted to play still and didn't want to solidifie any build until later in the game, which in pre one wastland you had the freedom to do that and try out several different weapon types before picking your perk cards for what you want.
---
So you're finally hit puberty. gz.
---
i meant the prime meat lol 😅 but lately ive been lazy this year and just afk on the meat spits
---
Go to the airport and hover around the flare gun, it usually triggers the event.
---
So they can both proc at the same time? If this is true that's awsome.
---
I'd keep both...   run the bloody as a daily and prime the 2 shot for scorched earth
---
Wonder if I could mod the Slugbuster plasma with the flame damage mod. 😁
---
Sniffed it a few months ago. I was so confused on what just happened. To make things even more confusing, the pipe disappeared after the trip.
---
mine is back up every other shot. or at least it should, but because of lag it usually takes 3-4 shots longer. even with a semi.
---
this is something I think a lot of people don't realize. their crit rate is being slowed down by quite a bit due to latency.
---
I get what you mean, and maybe he is picking fights he shouldn't be a bit but I feel like maybe the game needs to guide you better in what areas you should be playing in at certain levels until 50.  Otherwise anyone that is brand new with no higher level toon will have no idea what any region is like.  I think that following the story as with other games should give you through your level zones a little better.
---
Legendaries already have a particle effect, so why can't they just make it permanent, even while they are dead?
---
Massively the opposite.
---
Was getting 70ish pre patch now 120-140 outside, 180+ inside.
---
Thanks for the awards guys. I'm blown away.
---
are you scrolling left/right? because they're definitely under floor decor.
---
We need a overhaul though, plasma weapons were always the top notch guns in the fallout universe bedsides guns like fat mans, in 76 laser rifles and plasma rifles feel weak sadly :/
---
That’s one way to look at it
---
I think it's because it's looked upon as being a cheap and easy way to play. Lots of bloodied builds have shown me just how easy it is it abuse healing salves and other healing methods, while retaining their ridiculous damage numbers. Idk why they act confused why some people hate their builds tbh.
---
Don’t give Bethesda ideas to start making rocket league clones
---
I think the mothman cultists do wear some atom shop stuff
---
Exactly. This was the breath of fresh air this game needed. Most people must have been toying with a half ass build and not committing. Which is fine and dandy but not realistic in the sense that in a nuclear wasteland full of danger you have to be proficient in battling the dangers and that means committing to whatever build keeps you alive the longest....that includes finding appropriate weapons as well. The update allows me to roam the map as I once did because everything has decent XP to it....not just the bog area or what have you.
---
You say "bandwagon", I say "meta". Toe-may-toe/toe-mah-toe.
---
Don't worry, I'll save some of my tissues for you when Bethesda does something to completely render your build useless, too.
---
But I want a pistol build that's viable without perking into it or needing meta legendary weapons.
---
I'm lvl 500 and use an un-modded pipe bolt-action. After patch 22 I can't solo the path to enlightenment anymore without getting one-shot by the lightning bugs. Grrr
---
It might. But you're going to need to buy Starfield to find it.
---
Stealth isn’t supposed to work against creatures who sniff out their prey.
---
I'm fireproof 3 now
---
Maybe you need to evaluate your method when you're in the ops. Until the final objective (kill the marked mobs) - nothing matters except staying in range of the capture points.
---
If you could endure the incoming damage by chugging stimpacks, you could complete the ops in elder time with 2-4 people by killing literally nothing until the final zone. A lot of people don't seem to understand that and do other things, like killing mobs on their way from A to B, running away from capture area to loot or kill. Granted, melee builds are at a real disadvantage here since many mobs stop to shoot from outside the capture area.
---
Even then, though, there are many LOS breaks where you can simply hide from those mobs, staying in the capture zone, and not take any damage.
---
This is probably what's causing you to need to search so intently for a group "capable" of doing it. Either you are getting people who are not standing in the capture zones, or you personally are not approaching the tasks of the event well. The actual damage output requirement of the event is pretty low.
---
As others have said, addictive.. Yes. Monotonous,.. Surely. Fun... that is a personal question you have to figure out yourself.  Enjoy.
---
I wouldn't be upset at all.  I would contact the seller and see how we could make the deal happen.....  I have had to do this before where if an item was 15k, but they can only hold 12k, I would do 12k 50 Super Stims, 50 rad away etc to make up the trade difference.
---
I have also bought cheap items from a camp that was Off, while wondering around and immediately plummeted to my death when they logged out.  Is that their fault?  Not at all, its mine for buying from a camp that was off, I made the choice.
---
Same thing with players that clip through walls in power armor, is it the sellers fault for properly hiding their Off camps, just to have a bug screw them over?  No, if anything the fault is with the fact that camps that are "Turned Off" aren't actually off....
---
As for the nuke, if one is over my camp I just log out..... Its actually an easy thing to do....
---
Just to be clear - are you sure you didn't store things instead of scrapping them?
---
I alllllllmost upgraded lock pick. Glad I took a sec to think it through.
---
I've found that the angriest people in this game are the ones that don't pay bloodied 😆. They're probably burnt out from constantly grinding for ammo.
---
Don’t get me started on my favorite locomotive... Saw 611 at the NC Transportation Museum after it was restored...
---
You need the long display for the bigger weapons m8.
---
Those suits are going for crazy trades even though they are going to end up as common as all the other bos outfits.
---
Thats interesting. I always have the feeling that crit savvy doesnt speed up queen kills for me.
---
Primal Cuts doesn't award the stein. Grahm's Meat Cook does.
---
The whole system would have been better if you ranked up the slot, not the card.  Keep the cost of swapping cards out to make commitment to the perks mean a tiny bit.
---
My issue is going to be when new perk cards come along, or there is even the slightest change to an existing card.  You take months of work and flush it down the toilet, or even worse if a bug breaks one of the cards.
---
I was hoping to see some really interesting and fun ways to change the way you play your character with this system.  It is largely stat and damage buffs.
---
Piper is life! Oh wait wrong game
---
You know, even though you’re trying to acquire one and haven’t had any luck yet, that doesn’t invalidate the advice that was given.  Perhaps your energies would be best directed at further attempts at the Special Ops. 
---
Also, you might not know this but you can run the Spec Ops on each of your characters and as long as they are level 50+ you can get three chances per character per day. 
---
Best of luck!
---
I got you fam.
---
Have you tried capturing two zones at once? Is it possible to activate the other zone while one is going?
---
Is this the first time logging in since the update?  They added a few more dead zones for future content.
---
Considering there's also some Enclave stuff and Enclave PA, I bet we're gonna have mixed BOS and Enclave Rewards for that season.
---
 Like the Enclave PA will be the reward in the same spot as the White Captain Cosmos, and the Vertibird PA will be the Tier 100 reward.
---
rly ,.. disabled ?!? did not feels so for me.   
---
i have no problems at the P. Cuts evnts...hmm ,   
---
the only thing i have say is that  the stealth + sneak perks are worthless at Daily Op's.
---
but thats nothing i can not handle,..
---
Stored items take up space still
---
I have 3 characters. A bloodied heavy gunner level 300, a vats commando level 210 and my 3rd was going to be a pistol build but I got to about level 20 and said nope, switched to shotgun. I had very good low level legendary pistols and they just didn't do it.
---
Is that running now? I'm confused why there are 2 meat themed events.
---
You get it from the Grahm's Cookout event, not from the Primal Cuts ones. Its the one that occurs every hour just west of Vault 76. It should be given to you after completing it the first time. At least that's how it was last Meet Week. Hopefully they kept it the same this time, for your sake. Good luck.
---
It’s nice to have unlimited space for junk, and that’s about it for me
---
Yes they both proc
---
Not really, assuming you are starting with a stealth shot with your auto.  Ammo perk becomes more valuable with commando as you'll eat through ammo of course.
---
I didn’t know AA/E was considered legacy
---
I think what I would like to see is a better balance for the more casual players/newer players and the veterans.  Dont get me wrong either I do think this update was generally good, but I do think it is alienating super fresh players, at least ones soloing.
---
Edit: Also just saw the part about Bethesda knowing; glad to hear that they have heard about this!
---
It was fun. I got it to work when me and my buddy was low leveled. We used muskets and fought. Very fun.
---
Tried it at max level.... not so fun. Legendaries are the best and the bane of this game
---
I have my candy bowl sitting next to my vending machines, stocked mostly with bubblegum since that's a recurring daily challenge.
---
I would love one of those legacy galling plasmas. Sucks that i joined after those had been long removed and trading is crazy for that
---
Super Sledge is currently bugged right now with displays. It won't display in general. Same applies with the Assault Rifle.
---
That happens when the camp area is also a critter spawn point. Glitches make stitches.  Enjoy.
---
goddamit and i was doing a pistol build
---
Does nothing for the daggers.
---
Yeah more camp space isn't unreasonable and none of this shit will probably happen either lol. Also, a low level camp could belong to a mule so you'd skip it and miss out on potentially good stuff. Only one I majorly agree with on this list is dead legendaries being marked.
---
No I don’t think so! I played fine before yesterday! My camp is right at that new event primal cuts, I can join the event from my living room
---
I had managed to orchestrate some matches for it. Gave members of the respective teams their uniforms and black powder weapons. It was pretty fun.
---
5pm gmt but we are in bst time.
---
It's an hour after the challenges reset which is 5pm.
---
Same issue with Bolstering left leg for me, easily over 160 attempts, I've just given up even trying
---
You get the Prime Meat from the Primal Cuts events and turn it in at the Cookout for Scrip. Meat Week has always been both of the events together.
---
Then I would tell you that reloading is quicker then weapon changing because you can use perks/legendary effects/mutations to change reload speed but draw speed is constant.
---
What can I do so I can’t play today? :/
---
Experiences may vary, apparently. I spent the morning giving away plans, upgrading and repairing peoples gear, giving them ammo, boosting them through daily ops.
---
To be honest, they were pretty obnoxious. I won't complain if I never meet them again. However, they were young people and low level, so I helped them and bit my tongue when they said really dumb shit, because that's what good community is about.
---
Might be helpful to tell us the location, my dude.
---
Thank you. I so need to get the stein to fill my collection.
---
Wouldn’t be playing without first.  Scrap box is godsend.  They really need to add it for everyone.
---
Absolutely. The Atoms alone cover the cost (1650 for $13). The Private World is also very useful, especially for material runs.
---
Sometimes i think it may be lag, i have a BE flamer which melts literally everything in the game, but when i faced some specific people on pvp, me being from Brazil with a high ping, i get a shitton of markers doing 100+++ dmg while they're jumping around like monkeys and the guy don't even flinch, even when i'm in vats, but then they kill me with a few shots -_- 
---
But when people are just stading around, 2 or 3 shots max to kill basically everyone in pvp
---
What is Meat Week without meat? Think about it...
---
Why do ford guys hate chevys even tho they are they same truck? Is almost like people have pre determined notions of certain manufacturers regardless of if they make a good product or not.
---
Same for the skin on the pickaxe
---
sooo... no fatman launchers?
---
Funny. We had three consecutive cookouts where people killed the little critters then left the bits to meat-pile.  Weird.. RTFI.
---
The auction house has dozens being sold for 65k+, with multi selling for close to 110k. I'm not making  it up, search the AH for it and you can see for yourself. Thise posts dont like man.
---
That would be something Bethesda would do.  Hide it in with very obscure clues, where in the end you had to pick up the “Blue Tin Can”, drop it on the empty throne, activate the Clapping Monkey Three times, then throw a “Pulse grenade” at the throne to disengage the lock opening the throne to reveal a chest with the Plan: Diving Suit.
---
Someone should get EpicNate on this ASAP.
---
Earle straight up dunked you from beyond the grave
---
Yep, 2060 Super here.  I run on a custom high setting(textures high,  rendered distance low)  and get a consistent 144 fps at 1440p. Only time I get significant drops is during the SBQ and ACP events where everyone is rocking Tesla and Gattling lasers.
---
Spawns the same
---
Need to pick up 180 items before your oldest pick up resets
---
Helps though because others don't share your world spawns
---
Level 94. Still haven't nuked yet. Hope to soon cus I really wanna meet Earle Williams
---
I'll be on later today in a private. You're more than welcome to come and farm.
---
I have been doing daily ops every day and now have 1000s of ammo for very gun i own. I'm level 25
---
I don't think it's a personal attack, it's just advice.  All you really need to get under 8 is 2-3 people, knowing the route to the targets, and not fucking around between stops.
---
I try to speed-gather all the stuff to keep the ground clean. Just gotta remember to drop it later. "Where is all this damn spoiled meat coming from??"
---
Fair enough, I know that me and my girlfriend tried a daily opp before we hit 50 and had a really bad time of it, we did beat it but cost a lot of resources.  Maybe it does all come down to gear and builds.  But I also feel like it's hard to soldidifie your build before you get around 50, as well i think knowing good builds builds to work towards as a fresh player with no higher tools can be more challenging.  But i can certainly see the argument about needing to gear up more and at least thinking about a good build earlier.
---
Shhhhhh don't give away my preciouuuusss
---
I don't care about how they play FO76, I'm making fun of them for complaining on reddit about it.
---
Yb agree just as a new head wear or mod for the power armour that high lights corpses
---
Congrats! That’s one nice gun. I am currently looking for an AA GP with FFR.
---
You can server hop to find spawns, places like the antique store are well known buts it’s hard to know when a server booted up or when there was last a respawn.
---
The tea house and lighthouse have 2 magazine and 4 bobblehead spawns, visiting both im lucky to get 2 of the 6
---
Unless they changed it and I never noticed.
---
Where are the interior ceilings? Tired of the "barn" looks...give me interior drywalled normal ceilings damn it!!!!
---
I got like 12:30 today solo, but it's because the first quest marker failed to show up so I ended up wandering around the mine for four and a half minutes looking for the switch :/
---
I'm fine with people playing whatever broken builds it is they want to.
---
I'm tickled pink by posts like this one from /u/NIKwithoutaC complaining about their builds not being as broken. Real qq content, but the chefs kiss on this one is OP pulling a "nu-un ur teh angri oen" reply. Because I'm the one making qq posts about their build.
---
So in other words. U care.  It made u comment.
---
Does RTX 2060 super runs better on 1440p for fallout?
---
That’s what some people don’t understand. Unless it dropped in game for you, whether it was purveyor, daily ops, event, or looted from a mob there’s a very high chance it was duplicated.
---
I can start you off with a free marsupial recipe, just kick me some dog food sometime in the future. PSN Flavoredcancer
---
I will buy them all
---
The only thing i see here thats a problem though is that a fresh player with no high level toon can't do this, and at level say 15 they probebly don't really even know what scrip is.  Or how to farm legendaries and get good gear.  I know it took be a good while of playtime and youtube to figure out a lot of that stuff.
---
When I read comments like this, I feel like I must be playing the game wrong.
---
I use meta gear, but all of it I obtained myself. And I can tell you where I got each item. My bloodied handmade I got from a sheepsquatch, my instigating swing speed powerfist I got from a dog in Big Bend Tunnel, most of my unyielding gear I got from the SBQ (back when she only dropped combat armor), etc, etc.
---
Nope, I play junkies and kill with only a few shots
---
After a year i don't think i could go back to not having a scrap box. I also use the survival tent more than i thought i would.
---
Yeah some may be mule characters, but most are low level folk with 8000 .38 bullets for 8 caps each.
---
Cut content by all accounts. It was apparently going to be used for an event (PvP I think) where you fight to become president.
---
Scrapbox is king. Without it, I would’ve stopped playing ages ago.
---
Real question here, is English your first language? If not, then I'll explain your confusion. 
---
If English is your first language, why are you so bad at reading comprehension?
---
Hehe not sure which is more annoying. I have got on the mic to shout get in the zone to randoms and that is so not me. But sends me nuts.
---
I’ve used my explosive Gatling gun during many Meat 6 Days events and they always have the critter chunks on them when I blow off a group of 15. Maybe someone came and took yours on the quickness.
---
now I want someone to do that.
---
No you can only activate one at a time
---
need raiders PA
---
Oh you're sick of path the enlightenment? Try meat week, im literally dying non stop getting swarmed by squirrels and chickens. Patch 22 is too hard bethesda way to go. Im uninstalling fallout 1st. Take that TODD
---
I have the same problem. I have the xo-1 pa jetpack I got from white springs bunker. Bought the red rocket bundle and have all mats. Went to mod the re jetpack and it said I haven't met requirements. So where do I optain this plan for it? Please tell me.
---
And I'm pretty sure the spawns are same.
---
Power armour torsos with jet packs or the materials to craft jet packs and ultracite to craft ultracite PA.
---
I have never seen power armour plans (do they even exist?).
---
With everyone complaining about the update, more people should be running PA at least part of the time.
---
Automatic .45 combat rifles.
---
Sort them by required level
---
Yeah, all atom shop items. The plushie was in the shop fairly recently - maybe 3 weeks ago, but only for a day. The lamp was probably 2 or 3 months ago, and the backpack I haven't seen yet but have been looking since February or so
---
I find that I agree with you. Many of the cosmetic items just don't seem very inspired.
---
I remember seeing it on the map but I never did play it
---
100% yes. Take it for a month. fill that box. cancel it. when it gets to a point you need more junk take it again. fill box. cancel. repeat.
---
Yeah that's fair I remember as a new player I found very overwhelming and maybe a little difficult but I was never running out of all my stims and bullets and dying a ton.  I do know that the difficulty certainly went up for anyone under 50, as i was still only around 45, and I was geared fine i didn't really struggle but I could already see how many more stims I used and bullets and died more often then before, so I could see that really compiling on a fresh player.
---
Scrapbox, yes. Even though I'm not playing nearly as much as when I was laid off, I'm not sure I could go back without a scrapbox.
---
The atoms alone are worth it for buying the goofy cosmetics.
---
Are you trying to place your camp in wholy new location, or in a location you had your camp at before?
---
there was another guy here a month or two back who was having trouble with his camp. It had been auto removed due to a conflict with some game asset when the wastelander stuff had come out.
---
I told him to place it in a completely different random location, then leave the game completely; that is quit to the main menu and then exit the program completely. Then go back and put the camp where he wanted it for real.
---
Just to be safe you might want to move to a couple, meaning two or three, random locations, and they should all be a decent distance away from where you really want your camp and from each other. The minimum distance should probably be a 2 or 3 minute walk between each location.
---
You don't have to build anything in the new location(s) before you move it back to the location it was in. Just place the camp widget thing. All of the assets in your camp will still be stored and ready to replace after doing this.
---
That worked for him.
---
The theory of why this works: the game is basically a giant distributed database. One or more servers, and whatever cached data you have within your client, may not agree. by dancing the camp into a completely unrelated location and then exiting, you're basically changing the generation number of all the save data and triggering a resync of the data that pertains to you and your camp.
---
placing your camp object in a couple different locations basically flushes all the caches and gets the servers back into synchronization.
---
note that this is something that can happen with virtually any distributed database especially if there is some sort of outage or collision involved. and most game companies don't spend the huge sums of money that financial institutions spend to get around these sorts of data consistency problems.
---
As a user it's the equivalent of spending 150 caps to climb out of a map hole. But it is something you can do right now, and it's not something the game devs even have the tool to really address for you. It's just a petty annoyance.
---
Can you get raiders pa if you are not their faction? Also would it be worth while?
---
Honestly, I've been wanting to use the single action revolver in particular for so long now. It looks really, really good - But even before one wasteland I was struggling to defend myself with it. Pistols absolutely need a buff and the single action needs a buff for reload speed and damage to bring it closer to the NV version that was actually usable and give people a reason to use it.
---
Personally it creates a pvp issue, but since pvp is non existent Im not as scruffed about it as I was before. Hey if you wanna 1-2 shot things then whatever Idc. But Im the kind of person that like a bit of a challenge with my games and will purposely turn down OP weapons or methods for a more honest and down to earth kind of experience. As opposed to the optimized and crazy builds that most people would sooner use.
---
I have a friend (we’re both new players) who consistently gets gifted plans and such from higher level players. Often times people will show up at his doorstep and drop screws. It makes me maddeningly jealous
---
its a mod which means you need a raider PA chest first
---
I'll keep my eye out, just picked it up like 2 weeks ago.  Played one day before the update so was baffled when I got on and game play was completely different.  Getting used to it now and don't hate it.  Just takes longer to do anything because of prep and everything is stronger.
---
I get that the gear that I did get from this play through has been passed out to 2 random players I met.but honestly without having access to my main account this playthrough would of been tough without legendaries even though they scale down.maybe it's cheating on my end but I would do it again when I make my 3rd toon
---
For me it's worth the $10/month.
---
I get the tent, 1600 atoms ($16), the unlimited junk-stash.
---
But foremost the private world, I don't have to share the nuke zone with anybody and can farm one for over an hour, which can result in more than 100 stable flux.
---
I get why it's not weekly instead of daily. I would pretty much log in one day a week since it's not hard to get your weeks worth of scrip together. But the entire system of restricting your progress at all just discourages me from logging in at all most of the time.
---
Raiders is junk imo. Faction not necessary.
---
What is maiden nuking?
---
Yep. I am under no disillusion that my high end handmade, fixer, and legacies were probably duped. But at what point do you stop caring and just enjoy the game. To me they were purchased and traded for legitimately and so I have no issues.
---
Many thanks, it suddenly unlocked after a day away from the game :)
---
Survival tent to dump junk wherever you want is sweet, basically neutralizes any impact of junk other than in instanced areas like silos and acp.
---
The junk I was running before 1st occupied between half and 3/4ths of my stash space. With 1st I've now got space to list tons of weapons and armor on my vendor, and practically unlimited scrap for whatever I want to do because I compulsively grab everything that I see.
---
Also, to my knowledge, items in the world respawn after you loot X number of things.  I think it's 140? Anyway - Assuming that mechanic is true, vacuuming everything in sight would be why there always seems to be stuff everywhere for me to grab. Before 1st when I was selectively looting only the things I need, the world seemed substantially less filled with... junk. Granted, it could have been because of a patch, as I'm not actually one hundred percent sure of their mechanics for respawning items in the world.
---
Top-tier copypasta
---
I do actually, one NSFW pic lol that I thought reddit wouldn't allow
---
I didnt like the chore of the last season but now that card packs are important for legendary perks i do them as if i would get paid for it.
---
I came across this a couple of weeks ago &amp; it gave me a much needed laugh. I have kept the note too, only note I've really kept  😆
---
The 4 END does nothing, END on weapons and armor hasn't worked since FO4
---
The update modified gun damage. All builds are stable. bloodied and Junkies still most standard builds.
---
you just need the plans. And i would say no. I don't do PA but it is quite ugly and there's better options.
---
Why?  It only takes about a month go get max rep with each faction, and then what good would all those spent perk points be doing?
---
Ah. So much for the complicated strategy of sending one person ahead to the other point.
---
I have started vendoring scrip legendarys for 0 caps just so ppl will take them. The only stuff I try to actually sell now is god tier and this is a waste as well due to the fact that god tier items usually are worth more than the 30k cap limit.
---
It is yeah, berry mentats -addicted to berry mentats lol
---
So when Bethesda inevitably disables some core component of your build in certain events... You're not going to complain about it?  I guess you're a stronger man than I, then.
---
I usually use the Chinese stealth suit, but pa when something nasty shows up. I'm fairly new and totally casual as I only get to play on Mondays. What better options am I missing out on?
---
How do you get so much ingredients like fluids etc in a hour?
---
My stealth commandos get shredded at these events. It’s harder than daily ops to be honest.
---
And you know what? I’m fine with that. It certainly isn’t boring.
---
Ammo factory is crying out to go on an alt, which is how I've got mine.
---
The Scrapbox is priceless...yes it's so worth it!
---
Pipe Is Life
---
I use a gauss shotgun and all the critters drop critter chunks.
---
I personally think that the bloodied-meta is lazy and a sign of a lack of creativity or personality, but its not my place to complain about *how* they play.
---
My favorite lazy-bloody complaint was about people on teams sharing the Sun Kissed perk and ruining all their 'hard work'. Massive eye roll from me.
---
Unfortunately I turned off nvida replay &amp; wasn't streaming at the time
---
Platform?
---
Yes, it's related to the Brotherhood of Steel and it's supposed to play around Atlas, but it plays around Pleasant Valley Station for some reason.
---
Maybe something BoS-related will eventually happen there and they just forgot to remove the music trigger.
---
I mean,  it would always run 'better' at max settings with 1080, but 1440 looks better.  
---
To have a stable and constant 144fps with the 2060 super means I may have hit the jackpot on the silicone lottery though. I have a stable overclock pushing the clock to 2190 and +900 on the memory which seems be a fairly rare result.
---
That sucks. Usually people are fairly quick to help you out when you have a bounty. Hopefully someone will off you soon. You may want to try removing your armor before they do to save yourself repairing it later.
---
Since the page doesn’t have much info I’m Guessing it’s datamined content and therefore not obtainable atm
---
Maybe idiots (like me) don’t know how to earn reputation fast after the main quest
---
Doubling the amount of reputation you get
---
I named mine ::armor name:: and with the colons it puts it near the top of my inventory list.
---
And the 2 shot automatic tesla. Hmmm
---
It's just your luck.  I had a lack of rewards the first couple days too, but it really does seem to balance out around 80%.
---
I have definitely hopped on the mic a couple times pulling low levels (like one guy was 38?) through it. Was debating kicking people from the ops group because they seemed to not come to the points.
---
Hopped on the mic with a "Hey buds, so killing mobs doesn't do anything to help complete this until the end. Only standing in the capture areas matters. I can clear all the mobs for you but alone in the capture point they're gonna kill me because there's four times the mobs and only have me to target, *please run past everything and come to the cap point."*   (It was the robots + freezing, big oof)
---
And just like that suddenly it went buttery smooth into elder. Guess they just didn't understand how it worked at all.
---
Acquire ip and eliminate competition . It’s the capitalist way
---
They need to retcon a reason to explain why Appalachia BoS was never in the official lore of West or East coast BoS in any other game.
---
Them being outcasts, or excommunicated from the main faction for something unforgivable like this would make perfect sense.
---
Camo is extra murder when they get to hit you 6-7 times in melee before decloaking, for half a friggin second...  
---
I refuse to do camo daily ops. Killing vats screws over both my aiming issues (my computer setup makes anything but sniping or vats really hard to do), and my shotgun build dps.
---
Following that logic the 50cal should rip Earls ashole off in one shot but somehow it gets out damaged by a rifle shooting 45 pistol rounds. All weapon classes should have some incentives to use them. They don't have to so the same dame but need to be viable in most gaming scenarios.
---
PC
---
You used up, all the adhesive, ON PURPOSE!
---
They need a Motherlode sized nuked mole rat boss.
---
Woah, that’s pretty good. I forget that not all gpu is made equal
---
You mean take my atoms Microsoft
---
There is no trick.  You just complete the faction dailies and do some random good deeds for them around the map if you see that they need help.  It only takes about a month for the average person to max a faction.
---
&gt;You're not going to complain about it?
---
Nope, but it also helps to not play gimmicky builds. There's only two or three enemies in the game that cannot be easily soloed by a level 50 no legendaries build. So all the fancy builds don't actually cause that much of a practical difference. Which makes all the qqing extra hilarious. You don't need a gimmick build to be good.
---
&gt;I guess you're a stronger man than I, then.
---
If you say so.
---
Instanced items have a cool down.  If you haven’t looted the specific item in X amount of time, then it will be available to loot.  Having Fallout 1st will always allow you to grab that item.  Eg - the coveted Asylum outfits.  Once you grab it, then the item will be unavailable in private or public until the cool down or 180 items.  So, if you are having issues finding an item in an area, 1st can help.
---
I think We'd all show up for that...
---
Of course not! They’re not collectivists down there, you know.
---
did it once.  Then down the memory hole.  Hope they bring it back, maybe as a yearly event.
---
wow anyone got any feedback on how hard it is post-one wasteland compared to pre-one wasteland?  
---
I deliberately did this the week before the update when nothing else was happening.  Its so much fun to actually do the launch! Though thanks to the website with the codes - I can't imagine working it out the slow way!
---
All mine goes in super cheap no matter what they are,off loading a lot of very good stuff. Everything else goes into the machine ,on the floor or to a robot ha
---
Yeah but you can send the team to the first point as you activate the transmitter thing
---
Get a plasma or regular gatling and a power armor. Easy to get and no legandaries/perks necessary. It will be rough at first but survivable and you deal enough damage. Not enough to solo team bosses but good enough to farm up the gear/perks to do it later. You can buy the gatling gun plans from the free states vendor I believe and the plasma gatling can be bought from whitespring. 
---
After you're 50 do Beckets qline for the 50cal and put your perks into ammo crafting/super duper + heavy weapon damage perks. At level 70 you should be semi optimized no matter how shitty your build was before.
---
I think it's hard to judge at this point.  Like, when I have one perk of each Slugger, the damage is somewhere around 270 on a non-Legendary Glaive.
---
*But*, all of the mods for the War Glaive, which you can buy from Regs at Vault 79, redirect a significant amount of that damage into elemental attacks.  Fire, plasma, ice, electricity.  Kind of like the Shishkebob, the raw damage number looks pretty bad in comparison.  There's some thought that elemental damage is going to get buffed in the next balancing pass, and if that's the case, the Glaive is certainly poised to take advantage of it.  But for right now, it's probably not a be-all-end-all weapon for its rarity.
---
Best heavy is the lmg, second best the 50 cal, all other heavies have this spinup time which makes them too slow to be good outside of queen and earl fights.
---
If you want to include legacies, the best heavy is the explosive flamer but im sure they will fix it some day.
---
I think that was just the first day.  I could be wrong but I saw a post on day 2 saying that day one it reset 1 hour later than normal and normally it would be the same time as all the other resets.
---
Ya i guess
---
But who knows how lazy the person is to do all that and decrease from a month to maybe 1-2 weeks
---
I like how it sends the corpses flying off into the horizon.
---
I'm way too scared to do meat week for that exact reason. I wouldn't mind a patch focused entirely on flora/fauna rebalance... I ate a mutfruit the other day and immediately died from rads! Way too damn hard.
---
Spy outfit was part of the Communist content to be unlocked from the Atom shop.
---
Fallout first is worth it if and only if you were going to buy ⚛️.
---
The scrape box is great and all but you don’t need it. I’ve been running around with 100 to 150 of each junk in the stash box and I never needed more. 
---
The private world is amazing but every new feature they add the less interesting private worlds become for players unless your a streamer and or youtuber that wants to test stuff as well as have people not in your stream messing some stuff up.
---
Also having workshops everywhere is good for farming junk for scrape box.
---
Wow, a bloodied build.
---
Wave them down after event get naked and holster gun.  Hopefully they find a way to keep this from happening....done it 2 times now.
---
Do you care about your playstyle or do you just want to do what all the other cool kids are doing?
---
Idk why they don't just copy whatever AI/Pathing the Ghouls use in Radiation Rumble. It's a similar event with waves of enemies rushing to a point and afaik stealth works just fine there.
---
I mean what's next??? Enemies whose attacks overload your PA circuits and force you to exit it? Flying enemies that never land? It would be funny for a while, but completely negating builds is like the laziest approach you can take.
---
In the same place I always had it! And shit I didn’t even think of that! Idk I think I might just stop playing if this doesn’t work bro I don’t wanna build my camp again it took forever
---
I’ve achieved Elder every single day since it came out. Not a single rare reward. 80% chance for a rare reward my ass.
---
The first one I did I didn’t realise that you had to stand in the zone. Someone waved me over and then I realised. But always helps if one person knows what to do the rest just follow.
---
Oh wow😂
---
Agreed. I usually blow my scrips on legendary modules trying to craft a better 3* Mini Gauss. I get like 2-3 a day if I'm lucky. Then I'm stuck with a ton of crappy legendaries with nothing to do but drop them.
---
LOL I picked up a two shot three star reduced weight fat man launcher last night. Challenge accepted.
---
Pipe is Life!!!!
---
I forgot the name of the train station but right in the middle everyone does trades at! Right on the right of that where the little lake is with the Brahmin and that new primal event, I can trigger the event in my living room
---
On a heavy weapon it matters less. Your going to be in something’s face anyway and at spittin range the accuracy issues are not an issue.
---
Tonight's meat gonna be extra crispy!
---
i just started a new solo character and haven’t had too many issues. i maxed out gunslinger as well as gladiator, barbarian, and lone wanderer. haven’t even added any points to perception and endurance and have only died once. i try to stick to only fast or medium melee weapons (the bleeding mod on machete is great), and use primarily 10mm and laser pistol with speedy mods to do more dps. 
---
my advice to other beginners is shoot for the legs to cripple ghouls and other melee enemies so you don’t waste as much ammo finishing them off.
---
Wow! I don't post often, but I check this site multiple times daily. How I missed all those posts is beyond me. Thanks for the tip.
---
I just built in s friends camp last night. I just couldn’t scrap anything.
---
You can still do this in a **Private** Team. But not in Public Teams; this is to avoid harassment like someone using up your build budget with letters hidden a bunch of places.
---
I really want the rescue diver suit but I feel like it'll be like the hazmat suit and you can't wear armor with it
---
Yes. I hoard scrap, and without 1st, my already constantly full Stash would be near useless. Also, the tent is very useful as a fast travel point while exploring parts of the map far from my CAMP.
---
Only works on private teams, not public ones.
---
You have to be in a team but not a public team
---
This is a solid response tho thank you!
---
It is, if it is an Energy weapon.
---
It's been quite a while, but I had someone tell me they use Hunter's Longcoats as a currency for trading because of their rarity and ability to easily liquidate into caps if needed.   
---
They would offer like 10 Longcoats for an item, and I think around the time they could go for 10-12K in caps.
---
I'm still salty that they haven't delivered persistent private servers.
---
There's plenty of other daily grinds in this game, why does everything they add to the game have to be another daily thing?
---
You have: caps, scrip, daily quests, daily ops, daily challenges, reputation, gold...jesus there's too much to do every day.
---
And it's not like it's real content (aside from the Ops, I do thoroughly enjoy them) they're just motions you go through to get that carrot that they keep dangling just ahead of you.
---
I get it's intentional game design to promote a healthy playerbase and generate revenue...but that doesn't make it less irritating.
---
R/mildly infuriating
---
Builds are the same. The only thing different is that vampires and anti armor is more sought over compared then before.
---
Forest Scout Armour 
---
"Best armour in the game"
---
???
---
I don't think you were being trolled, but I do think you massively overreacted.
---
What's the pink glow? Are they being mind controlled by a Flatwoods Monster? Either way it epic!
---
What's tatos?
---
I myself don't have it but have read this a few times and thought I would share.  Those that do have it, please correct me if I'm wrong.  The private server you get is not unique to you. By that, I mean that it's not a complete new server when you get it.  Player A gets private server, plays, loots, etc.  when they are done,  the server goes to player B without resetting.
---
Block someone on that world. It should try to avoid sending you to a world where a blocked player is.
---
Ah yeah, Escape Artist is key.
---
Fantastic addition to the game.
---
My understanding is that its much easier to farm for mats in certain nuke areas than others. I've heard that Aaronholdt Farms is a good place to nuke for fluids.
---
With scrap unlimited and private world so you can farm better and that helps alot so its worth it in my opinion
---
That could be good, if we get a candy bowl, we can add chem-infused candy that gives us bonuses
---
We were just about to finish when we got kicked, how am I not supposed to be mad?? The dude clearly doesn’t even know what a daily ops team isor what daily ops even are, he was sitting in a daily ops team solo just kicking anyone who joined but yet he’s not trolling.
---
What this post needs is more pipe......and cowbells
---
I don't have a build.
---
Who else clicked this thinking we were finally getting an in game Keychain so keys wouldn't clog up the inventory?
---
Nice job though... What top coat takes 5 weeks to cure?
---
The scrap box and private servers where you can farm resources is all you need to know about and yes it’s quite a P2W game changer indeed.
---
I mean, yeah it's cool, but it's still just a bloodied build.
---
Private worlds are great for materials. I have a couple guns that run on fusion cores, Saturday mornings while I clean the house I take workshops at 2 power plants and farm cores for a couple hours. I grab about 25 to 35 and that gets me through the week an ammo and PA needs
---
I can't even sell them unless they weight like 5 pounds, my stash is full.  :(
---
I know. I scrapped everything. Still says the samething. I'm about to move my camp again.
---
Did you gain the Unstable Isotope mutation?
---
You get other outfits too! Including the western outfits if you're into that
---
I've sold two sets of three diffusers over the last week on PC. I'd call that a decent clip of sales. I think I was charging 45 caps per; I'm not trying to profit, but just to charge enough to discourage people from buying more than they need.
---
imgur and link it.
---
"We"
---
What does sun kissed do to their meta??? I dont use sun kissed idk
---
I scrapped them. My storage is completely empty. I have nothing left.
---
THIS.
---
There are also raider and settler skins for the tent. I'm using raider, but the Xmas one might be making an appearance again for me.
---
A Halloween tent would be fantastic though!
---
Same with ammos \^\^ Start of with 20 shotgun shells, end up with 400+ everytime
---
Does it have to be wired or does it radiate power a certain distance?
---
yeah for this build, I've tried all the best armor sets as far as I'm aware.
---
It might not be as fun as ur friend wants to hear but he has to stay in the Forest /toxic valley area till prob level 25-30. Do as many events with others as possible. Use melee when ammo is low and upgrade his gear every level he can. Even before the patch when I first started out I prob stayed around these areas till level 30-35 till I traveled into the ash heap or savage divide.  
---
 I feel like the biggest prob newbies have is they rush the story and don’t explore the forest and toxic valley enough. You get familiar with the game mechanics that way and can see where u wanna go with ur build. Then u can do the quests that usually are supposed  to be done at higher levels. A lot of the time tho they get impatient and just keep tryin to go at the main quests. It’s more of a pace urself kind of game, even more so now post patch. After he gets the hang of perks, mutations, legendaries and what enemies to engage and what enemies to avoid he will get better and it will be easier.
---
Before the seasons I rarely ever logged in for atom challenges. 
---
Now though we are rewarded cosmetics and some other stuff we would most likely have never bought because they would be 500+ atoms each. 
---
We are also rewarded atoms but not as much, but it’s still enough to get something that you want in the shop.
---
Overall this is a very good addition for the game. Some players will have that FOMO and complain but these things are meant for players who are actively playing their game.
---
Yoo my camp placed! I kept logging back in and it worked! Thanks for your response
---
I thought the smiley face would have been a clue.
---
meat week is a summer bbq event and you get cookout themed items/weapons (like meat cleavers)/costumes
---
Sun Kissed removes rad damage from 6am-6pm. Bloodied builds usually rely on having 81% rad damage to work.
---
Does this really happen often?
---
If they're smelling, they'd come for me through the TV screen, The Ring style.
---
I am, had four of the heavier machine gun turrets, 3 rocket and 2 search lights, im down to 3 actually showing up, but i cant put anymore down because it says im over budget (despite showing 3/10 on the counter).  Not sure how to sort it either :/
---
This and maybe a cultist/ mothman themed survival tent.
---
More often then I’d like. I don’t care about being kicked but when your on a daily ops it kicks you out of the daily op so you have to restart it all over again.
---
the \*Best\* bloodied build
---
I don’t have a scrap box either, just the stash
---
Unless this has changed since last night, someone is taking those chunks. I used an explosive combat rifle and all the critters killed by the explosion had chunks.
---
Did you have to do the dance, or did you just luck out and the problem is seriously disappeared?
---
My personal choices:
---
Fixer/Handmade for light swarms,
---
Furious for Big Guys
---
Vampires/Explosive for large mobs
---
There’s actually very little difference between PA - they all offer the same 42% flat damage reduction along with 90% radiation reduction, but ER, DR, and RR have diminishing returns. So in theory, for a min-maxer, X-01 is superior in a nuke zone or PvP against legacies for its ER, assuming Emergency Protocols is installed. Ultracite would be superior for protection against ballistic weapons and explosives. T-51 is the most versatile. But all in all, there’s not a lot in it.
---
I’m kind of a rifleman build in progress, albeit not as minmaxed as something you’d see in a YouTube tutorial
---
Well, for starters, you can run the Daily Ops as often as you want. Secondly - did he kick you when you joined, or when you were about to finish? Was he doing the Op with you? If not, how did he know you were about to finish? You don't think nuking his camp was a bit of an overreaction? Why didn't you start a new Ops team and invite your teammate?
---
I also have not received one yet from daily op drops. I actually am really wanting to try it out. So I would certainly trade or spend caps at your vending machines for those plans if it was allowed!
---
I haven’t seen that, but now I want to look for it
---
Or we can have a repeat of the start of the year and have BE90 laser rifle fillings instead.
---
How do you get furious?
---
Ah, there you go.  If you're on pc I can build one in your camp for you.
---
Damage is produce by your build not your gun. A good build you’ll do decent damage with a crafted weapon
---
I ain’t have to whip out my moves!! But (I could have sworn) my camp kept disappearing yesterday! I wouldn’t stay in a world if it didn’t place my camp, and I would notice while being in a world for a while my camp wasn’t there! So let’s see if it disappears but it’s here rn!
---
IMO, having levelled 8 toons so far, starting with fully modded Legendaries makes a *huge* difference. I agree that it's not absolutely necessary though. What's essential on the other hand, is fully modded weapons and armor and always upgrading to match the level progression of the character.
---
Ok thank you
---
You should team up with that guy who wants to nuke people's camp for ruining his Daily Ops experience.
---
I'm glad I didn't rank up Legendary Perception before I realized I already had 15P and wouldn't be able to equip more perk cards.
---
I've found it twice on the road towards the Mire heading away from Freddy's House of Fear. If that helps.
---
It’s Jenkem...
---
Or at least that is what I suspect unless someone comes up with a better explanation.
---
Oooh, I bet a mothman theme would be a big hit! That's a great idea :)
---
OK. I will pay more attention the next time. I'll go in without wood scraps on me, and see what happens. This would be great if I've been wrong about this.
---
I mean, you're acting like you've discovered some forbidden knowledge. It's still a bloodied build. "Best" or otherwise. It's nothing new.
---
My medics shotgun has become my favorite since the update.
---
Wait, if this is the case, what the point in a plan? Why not just drop the unique weapon again?
---
Note: I don't doubt you, I made 3 gutters and they are all exactly the same, but why...?
---
Damn dude feels bad lmao
---
Start your own ops team. I do not want the success of my Ops to be influenced by whether or not someone kicks me out. 
---
I choose not to give that control to anyone else, and for that reason, you will only ever find me on a Daily Ops team where I am leader.
---
Fixes this issue for me. I think it could for you, too.
---
The real division in playstyles right now is whether you want to play full-health or bloodied. If bloodied, there's pretty much one build to choose from. For full-health all kinds of options. 
---
For ballistic weapons, its sounding like the current winner is automatic/commando focus. Stealth is broken half the time and shouldn't be relied on for damage.
---
Oh, and PA or not?
---
That's bullshit that it doesn't.
---
This! The tent and the scrap box have been such blessings for me lol. I didn't think I'd use the tent at all, but now it's a part of my daily grind.
---
People think that since they can 2 hit a super mutant everything is fine. They don’t realize that they still lost like 90% of their dps and now they are worthless for boss fights and heavy enemies.
---
You can also fill up the ammo converter and farm plans/fluxes.
---
I’ve had this happen, it’s annoying, takes work, and hopefully you can easily fix it. But you have to find where you had the missing turrets, scrap/store the object they were on, and then rebuild it. I had to completely redo a section of a tire wall to get back two turrets and then I couldn’t realign them like they were. But that’s the only way I know how to fix it
---
Cursed Shovel, awesome melee weapon
---
Same happened to me. I went to the One Violent Night event and hoped that in the chaos inside the barn, somebody would off me. They did. I said "thank you" on the mic.
---
I’m still at my standard 30 FPS here on console until someone shoots at me. Then I get a third of a frame per second and by the time I can see properly again or use the favourites wheel, I’m already dead. Seeking revenge is fine though.
---
Berry mentats, I always use berry mentats
---
Or ya know bring back leveled zones
---
No he didn’t kick me immediately, I joined the team and loaded into the daily op, we were about to hit the second uplink when were all kicked. I didn’t nuke his camp but I felt like it, i just didn’t feel like doing all that cause it wasn’t worth it in the end. Like I said, he was a low level and he probably doesn’t know what a daily op is or that kicking you from the team also kicks you out of the daily op. I was already aggravated so didn’t feel like going through the ops again so I just logged off for the day.
---
This is a gd alien gun. This things needs godly damage status. If a 50 cal can mow down a scorchbeast, the alien blaster needs to be able to turn it into a chicken..wait, no..I like that. Let it be crappy. Let it instead turn it into random wildlife! Imagine fighting a deathclaw, only to turn it into a cow you can then milk.
---
Whatever. Playstation was the reason 76 never went crossplay, I wouldn't cry if the disappeared. I just figured they have enough IPs to still offer exclusives.
---
I didn’t know that, and now my ritual of blowing the horn multiple times before farming Harpers Ferry, seems... so futile.
---
Furious is a legendary effect on legendary weapons, just like two shot, bloody, junkies or vampires for instance.
---
Any normal legendary weapons has a chance to be furious, meaning any time you're awarded a legendary weapon, it has a chance to be furious.
---
Totally would buy one from you. You’re an Xbox by chance?
---
I think I got the harpoon gun on my first.  
---
1) cursed shovel is pretty awesome as a melee. 
---
2) look at the weight. Cursed shovel and cursed pickaxe are 40scrip in a super low weight item. I have piles of them to store scrip.
---
🤣😂🤣😂 no more😢😢
---
A swift kick in the ass.
---
For heavy guns Furious (non explosive) if you aren't bloody or junky, those prefixs if you are. Even if you don't have any perks into heavy guns it still does enough damage to be helpful against the bosses around the clock unlike nocturnal which is only useful at night. Two shot to me feels too uncontrollable to maintain consistent damage to a single part of the body which headshots are always the best bet and against Earl those little bastands sure are small.
---
And this is why I solo them. Its close but so far ive always done so in under 8 minutes since I learned what to do.
---
When life gives you shovels...dig!
---
Bloody mess is a must as is nerd rage
---
No but they didn’t need to nerf it by 90% or more.
---
My raider dailies haven’t reappeared in over a week. They just show as completed in my pip boy and I play everyday. Never had this issue with the settlers.
---
That is the reason I started selling for 0. I had half a dozen weapons/armors for sale and was capped on stash weight. Like OP I was left with a choice. Either drop them on the ground or try and find a way for ppl to take them. So far ppl have been taking them....what they have been doing with them I have no idea! lol.
---
New way to stack*^
---
I have recently been delighted with explosive weapons (with maxed demolition expert), they are not the most powerful in the wasteland but they work well with my stealth commando build
---
in fact, I stopped using any other weapons...
---
I’ll sit there at the start basically begging the people to join the daily ops and then they try to defend the signal repeater you repair
---
If you are gonna go through that effort to blow up a house just run solo. I would say server hop but seeing  how people do daily ops, hed use alot of nukes.
---
I’m guessing it’s just luck of the draw when it comes to getting a good legendary gun
---
I usually don’t see the point in making my own if there’s one already open, but now i will. It seems to me that nothing but immature children play this game
---
Thats actually sounds pretty fun
---
The best armour in the game is either heavy leather or heavy combat. Take the escape artist perk and weight of armour doesn’t affect sneak.
---
Probably not PA, all the time anyway, and currently I’m kinda kitted for non auto
---
Yeah It's up to a solid Mississippi &amp; 1/2 between activation and execution...
---
Not Primal Cuts, but I couldn't find the legendary corpse at a mole rat Horde event. This was a day or two ago.
---
I'm in my 30s. So for me that's usually true. It comes with the territory of gaming.
---
Go fight a boss.
---
Last night private server my whole team was kicked out of daily ops except me.we are all on private chat and one by one "dude I was kicked"it was just me left alone in the daily ops..just told them I was done for the nigh after that...i didnt kick them but must of been a bug of some kind
---
I was really hoping for the mothman one since so many mothman themed items have hit the atom shop lately.
---
yep.  links.
---
I mean, have you seen explosive energy weapons?
---
A Quad Western Revolver just feels so good to fire but hits like a spitball.
---
LOL! This community is something else. Wont even kill you if you beg for it
---
Bookstore is in Summersville.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_(Fallout_76)
---
excavator armour is popular for the amount of stuff you can carry and the extra yield from collecting ore. 
---
some types are more popular but the mods can be hard to find
---
Have you put the fast spin barrel on your mini gun? The one that gives you 200+ fire rate? You may have a different opinion if you go and do that right now.
---
Mines the same, think it’s just a visual bug. If you un-equip it and then equip it again it should show again
---
I wish I was online right now. I love taking bounties.
---
already did, went fine.
---
What did you set your shadow distance to? Any other specific settings?
---
That’s why I always start my own team....
---
Shhhhhh don't tell everyone! Seriously though, this has always been my go to for stocking up on scrip. Hell I even leveled one of my toons to 50 solo with a level 5 TSE pump prior to the TSE nerf. Monster Mash kill Watoga bots server hop n repeat.
---
Im about to be down voted into oblivion but FO1st is a huge waste of money. Youre essentially paying extra for a single player experience in an online game. I find that kind of sad personally.  
---
If you like you can do what i did, buy it for a month, fill the scrap box and then cancel. Almost a year later I still have not run out of junk in my scrap box from that initial month.
---
Kinda new to the game so haven’t really used much besides a sniper and fixer
---
k whatever. I can see why you hope its the other way around.
---
It really depends on what else you have and what you're looking for. If you're bloodied and want full unyielding, start with any piece you don't have.  Just pick what you think currently has the least desirable effects, and try to replace that one.
---
Thank you kind and knowledgeable person.
---
Thanks. English is not my native language, sometimes it's hard to know the difference :)
---
As low as I could in the ingame settings
---
Hmm yeah I think I’ll do my limbs first
---
Yep, with this games time gates for everything it's all about time. The more time you spend playing it the more stuff you will eventually find that's better than what you are using. I started out usually only using non legendary handmades, then fixers, then legendary ones, then packing a basic heavy for bosses, then I found a legendary one and just upgraded from there all the way up to a furious explosive 90 reduced weight Gatling plasma legacy for when shit gets real.
---
I would vendor shop.  people sell good 2 star or dscent 3 star weapos
---
Correct - you said you got one shot a day but you get 3 a day. You can just roll all 3 at the same time if you hit Elder first.
---
Tbh I have no perks that help the mini gun or any mods unlocked
---
I was mostly talking to the person who said your perks make your damage.  It's a mix of weapon and perk.
---
Yep and if u have a commando build with no perks in heavy damage and stabilised etc it’s poor. Just did Earle and had a level 100 with an exploding plasma gat doing lots of fireworks and very little damage. It’s the build not the weapon. Same for defence. U can have full bos heavy combat if I don’t have blocker/serendipity/dodgy/adamantium etc then you’ll die like u were wearing nothing. Everything comes back to the build
---
I kicked a guy off a team yesterday, really pissed me off. I was waiting for everyone to join and then one dude shows up and just takes off running. I thought,  OK and went with it. Well, 1st uplink, ive got nearly claimed that guy breaks the connection. Then I kicked him after that, said fuck it, and left that server.  People need to chill and work together, if someone is at the uplink get away. You cost your team 3 or 4 seconds you need at the end by you needing to be FIRST.
---
I don't wanna beat on PC players but honestly I'm so glad bethesda hasn't made crossplay between PC and consoles. When all of those modders on PC that would straight up rob you of all of your loot with the press of a button were going around harassing everyone, and even stealing from players and making them buy their loot back, I was SO glad I was a console player
---
I tried changing it from the locked 59Hz to 60Hz, but it just reverts back. Apparently [that's how Windows 7 and up sees it](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2006076/screen-refresh-rate-in-windows-does-not-apply-the-user-selected-settin), that 60Hz is actually 59.94Hz.
---
I've noticed the same issue with my 60" vizio but following as you suggested did seem to help a bit! Thabk you!
---
Nah... I'm hating on it.   I think the balance is overboard favoring the critters. I'm blowing through sooo much ammo... been relying on melee now.   Used to love my quad lever action...
---
How do you find a legendary fixer?
---
Definitely sure it is off as I was getting hundreds of FPS prior, and thousands on the main menu. I thought that limiting it to 70FPS, which is more than enough, would reduce unnecessary load on the GPU.
---
Your name doesnt seem to fit. Very generous of you. I will add you in a bit.
---
I’ll defo have a look
---
One of my toons is a bloodied heavy gunner equipped with a VE Gatling Gun and a BE Gatling Gun, as a back up weapon. Both gatling guns do great for day to day use. For special occasions, that toon also has Bloodied, Vampire and Twoshot gauss miniguns.
---
It’s just a little airborne....it’s still good it’s still good
---
I’ve only seen it once, there’s an electrical tower near the giant tea pot, that’s where I found it. Pipe is life
---
The reason he wasn't doing much damage was because earl takes very little explosive damage
---
The problem is he wasn’t even with us in the Ops, he was doing some other shit at his camp. I thought maybe he’d join but nope, me and the guy were killing it just to be kicked an have to start over. Not fun
---
So the leader wasn't even in the op with you?
---
it should do 100 base with its ammo and 60 with fusion
---
Learn the plan and they will drop just like anything else. Kill enough legendary enemies or spend enough scrip and the purveyor and you will get one. You on Xbox? I have a couple that aren't the best but you're welcome to try one out.
---
Sent a friend request, so I can find you 
---
IGN heavy_Jake  
---
happy to help you out
---
RIGHT? Thankfully I was able stand in the way of some poor fellow's flamer during a Primal Cuts event. I think I might have traumatized them though.
---
Join a daily ops public team. Never had problems with teammates doing nothing and even then it's pretty easy to do it alone or with 2.
---
I'm working on my unyielding set now. I have 1 good piece, 1 decent piece, 1 scout armor piece that has better effects than what I rolled, and am still using 2 vanguard pieces because i haven't got better unyielding pieces. 
---
Just a warning, it can be one hell of a grind to get the pieces you want. Ive gone through hundreds of modules at this point.
---
I suspect the effort now flows into seasonal rewards.
---
I got the chest piece first and honestly it's the only one I want.    
---
I was very lucky. My first roll is a 3 Star Chest and I added the Bolstering mod.    
---
It has these effects:    
---
Unyielding. I don't run that build but it helps I guess.    
---
Increase AP Refresh Rate    
---
Ammo weight -20%    
---
A 1 star can be as good as a 3 or vice versa. The random effects can make/break a piece.
---
Did it once, thought it didn’t show up because I didn’t talk to any of the bots there other than the curator. Didn’t realize it was removed.
---
Born survivor - take that off.  Also any auto stim armor.
---
Ive never been a huge fan of PA unless I played heavy guns. Ill take dying honestly. That way you can seem my giant sun face as i blast you in the mouth with a shotgun. The ghouls can at least. But I appreciate the info. Got a little off topic. Im pretty sure i haave most of the ultracite and PA plans learned. So I can sell anything i get from the queen.
---
And yet I’ve seen well built heavys with exploding plasma gats absolutely rinse Earle. Take off your heavy oerks and stabilised etc and then have a go with your plasma gat and tell me the damage is still really good
---
I'm using Windows 10. I guess it was worth a shot. Sorry it didn't solve it.
---
Yeah I saw someone’s stream yesterday that had a fixer at like 220 Damage and I’m sat here with 81 damage, it’s decent against animals, ghouls and robots but when it comes to a boss it’s useless and I want to be able to participate in these events but I’m just basically sat there for morale support with how bad my gun is against it
---
Nope, I think he was building up his camp or something. I chalked it up to maybe he has to craft ammo or something but nope he just felt like being a dick I guess
---
but to max your damage you need to pick a meta build and stick with it.  low health use bloodied weapons, high health use junkies or anti armor.  there a plenty of videos on each.  Also its hard to max damage with a heavy weapon if all your perk cards are geared toward rifles.
---
No, that was fixed within like a week if release
---
Now you have 5-10 minutes before your server cycles after leaving; and a fresh one gets created
---
PIPE IS LIFE BROTHERS AND SISTERS
---
I’ve been kicked off of teams way more than usual lately.  I just assume it’s bc the leader has friends they want on the team instead.  I always do whatever the team specifies or I switch teams to mimic what I’m doing at the moment.  Could be that I don’t share cards, but I honestly don’t have enough charisma points to do this.  I usually end up by myself on my own casual team lol.
---
Yeah but the thing is I barely classify as an unyielding user almost everything on me is 1 star marine that I bought for 450 caps
---
I feel like weapon reloads have been slowed down.
---
Same. The daily ops in the sewer is basically hopeless.
---
I have a normal fixer plan so should they drop sometimes or is there like a legendary plan?
---
It sounds like you’re being inefficient with your perks if you’re using a fixer (a rifleman or commando weapon) and a mini gun (heavy gun). Pick one theme and then use the damage perks for it, you’ll get a lot more damage if you focus on one type and get all the damage perk cards for that type.
---
Po-te-toes! Boil 'm mash 'm stick em in a stew (Boil 'm mash 'm stick em in a stew Boil 'm mash 'm stick em in a stew)
---
Alt+F4
---
This is what happens when even losers are given trophies...they never learn or attempt to be better. Too much soy in their lives, not enough fat in their diet turns them tard. Fact - that squishy thing banging around in your skull needs fat to be healthy...not soy.
---
When the nuke drops and the queen comes out there are always people to put her down.
---
Probably bloodied legendary effect and adrenal reaction serum, as well as good mods for the gun plus all relevant perks.
---
Ha! That's awesome! Glad it sorted itself!
---
Core Assembly is better for getting that AP back to avoid hiccups, but Emergency Protocols will max out defense.
---
A thread about meat week and critter corpses just gave me a good idea for a fun perk: animals and creatures killed with energy weapons have a chance to drop cooked versions of their meat. Grill a herd of Radstag with one arcing blast from your Tesla! Nothing like a nice Radtoad omelette fried up just like mom used to make: with a searing dose of plasma!
---
Call it "Energetically Epicurious" or "Science Oven"
---
Same here, and I hate being alone on a public team, for that I might as well slap lone wanderer back on. Like I said I can deal with being kicked but it’s really annoying when you get kicked out of the mission as well. I’ll just give him the benefit of the doubt cause he was a lower level than me and he probably didn’t know what he was doing.
---
Same. It's not a bug, it's rng.
---
I’m on xbox
---
Wrong PSA
---
The OP specifically asked about replayability once achieving Elder. 
---
So assuming you hit elder that day, you have one chance. You get 3 rolls in the single chance but it's still one chance and if those rolls fail you have to wait till the next day.
---
Happens so much with scorchbeasts
---
Player base for PlayStation and Xbox are much larger but we still play in servers with 16-25 players. PS4 has the largest player base and pc is the smallest. However, we get all the cool ini tricks and pro hackers.
---
Sadly issues are there too, when I join a team everyone usually does fuck all.  They had probably already completed it but somtimes it will be a new group.
---
Gee thanks now my bloodied sneak build isn't gonna be able to sleep for the well rested bonus😁
---
I don't have any of that. Seems I have to get my rad level to like below 15% to keep my hit point at 20% level. Maybe it's a bug with UI. Rad level and hit point level does not match. Don't have any mods installed btw
---
I had all perks for a sniper, maxed out rifleman and people said it was fine for a fixer but then people also said I should have commando so I’ve slowly been unlocking them
---
Happened to me. Lvl 400 something. They could have let me just ride with them instead it cost him Elder level by 3seconds. All cause he booted me. I got a chuckle because all they had to do was let me continue
---
CORNER. STAIRCASES.
---
How about a Halloween Scrap Box skin.
---
Only one fixer plan. Did you learn it already? If it doesn't say, (known) plan: the fixer, the you need to click on it so you can craft them. Once you can craft them it's up to rng to have one drop. Anyone's guess as to whether it's a crappy one or a god roll. RNG is RNG lol
---
Ok. I’m sure it is on yours. On both of mine it’s poor as I’m bloodied commando with no heavy perks. On a flip my B2525 fixer does great damage. If I didn’t have commando perks and ran at 100% health it’s shit. I’m not arguing. All your damage and defence is in the build not the weapon
---
IMO, I would not have wasted my caps on 1 Star unless it was something that was filling a gear slot. I have a Two Star that provides the Chameleon effect which is essential to my char.  
---
The rest of my gear is solid. They provide stat bonuses as well as weight reduction and other effects. I have to find a piece that is at least  Scout Armor with the same two effects.  
---
I only have the plan for the SS chest and the grind for the rest is done that way on purpose. I may not be doing all this insane damage but I do have more time.
---
It all seems so confusing for a newbie like me😂
---
Fun fact - there’s a dead NPC wearing it over in the cave entrance of the deep.
---
Servers seem full, but how many servers? Not sure.
---
Nuclear winter had problems getting started before the lobby change at the end of last score season and in between.
---
I will give that a try, sadly one was/is on the ground dont know what to do about that one.
---
See that’s what I’m saying, I’d expect this behavior from a higher level player. Some people just get a kick out of being a troll to others, especially in online gaming. I deal with enough of that in COD, I come to fallout to chill not deal with pesky annoying adults that act like kids. Also a level 400 should know better than to kick you
---
It's not too bad
---
Yeah I learnt it a while back and I’ve never had a fixer drop, would it drop from an enemy or would I get like a random legendary from crafting
---
Same for the fixer in general right now.
---
This happened to me recently. I saw someone in the silo and thought I’d help speed up the process. He goes to launch the nuke and then just stands around eventually giving the confused emote also. I think he had the card but didn’t know the launch code. Looked it up real quick and launched it myself. Felt bad but he clearly wasn’t going to be able to do it
---
As a heads up, I also posted this in a fo76 Facebook group. One person suggested just going into the Xbox settings and turning off hdr, bc the “optimized for Xbox one x” only tries to fake 4K, so it messes with the picture. I was skeptical about how turning off hdr would improve the visuals, but I tried it. And surprise surprise, the game looked just as good as it did when I did my toggle UHD off/on trick. And even better, if I have to go back to the Xbox Home Screen for a second the improved graphics stay the same. With my trick, if I went to the Home Screen the graphics would go back to diluted and I’d have to restart the game and do my toggle thing again to get the good graphics back. So turn off hd in your Xbox settings, and you will no longer have to toggle UHD off on your Vizio ever again!
---
i thought it was funny bc i’ve heard multiple inventory items referred to as a “stack” and that’s a literal stack idk
---
Other people you team with may be healing your rads also.
---
I kinda understand how some perks work but it’s stuff like the bloodied build that confuse me, I really need to just sit for a bit and learn about them
---
Okay, look.  You're right for 99% of weapons.  I was just pointing out one specific type of weapon that doesn't conform.
---
Recently?
---
Probably got kicked because you were going to finish the event and the leader of the party wanted to farm xp.
---
Some foods boost your endurance and can move your HP so you have to actually watch your diet too or your HP will fluctuate.  Dog meat steaks and some other stuff plus mutations might also change and lower your total HP.  So 15% might be 20%.
---
All bloodied is is: more damage the lower your health.
---
Nope, whatever you're thinking is wrong. I only own PC and my 1 friend who played on X Box built a PC, too. Sure, they'll make money off the hardware, but remember that it was the software licenses that made Bill Gates rich, not the hardware.
---
There is a location in the south of the map where you can get a ridiculous amount of lead easily, it's called Lucky Hole Mine, taking an Excavator PA makes it even better if you have it already.
---
you already had a post removed, man
---
also. free bees? not the beeees!!1!!
---
It will only drop as a legendary from an enemy, the purveyor, or as an event reward. The ones you craft aren't legendary.
---
Honestly just gonna yeet some fertiliser at a noob from a half held cement mixer
---
Nah, that objective is on a platform with only one entrance and that archway infront of op is the path all enemies take to reach it, when solo some will head right for you, others will pop the other objectives first before heading your way but ALL will path through that arch, it's like shooting fish in a barrel tbh :p
---
Edit to say that these days i'm doing this event mostly for the notes, xp is so stupedously easy to get anyway, i started the char i'm maining atm half way though the last season and he's lvl 110 by now :)
---
I also need to learn about mutations
---
Automatic/Commando is better for bosses and hectic fights... but Semi/Rifleman is still very good for hunting outside of the events.
---
I run Junkies/Stealth and used to switch between Rifleman and Commando perk cards... now I don't even bother.
---
I imagined them looking at a camera feed of some poor settler girl tied to railroad tracks, twirling their mustache, and pressing the button.
---
Go to lucky hole mine with an excavator pa and you can walk out with 1500 after 15 minutes, just look for all the ore veins.
---
Except the damage part.
---
Smart idea. I just bought it due to being time poor. Need to get things done fast. In Aus it is $22 a month which due to lockdown is a good buy since I cant go out and do things or work.
---
NOT THE BEEEEEEEES!!!!
---
Fair enough, hopefully I get lucky, I just need better guns because I’m trying to take part in that prime meat event and my guns don’t do enough damage which is annoying
---
Or get more screws and springs by killing robots with it.
---
PS4 but thanks for the offer
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
The Pipe is life!
---
Fusion cores as well.  Just swap to a gatling laser right before the boss dies. I did it once, I got four fusion cores out of it.
---
I mean, there are workshops with core generators, but getting a few extra is nice, especially if you use a gatling laser.
---
This. Limb damage cause faster crippling, nothing more. 
---
Unless it’s a magic gun and then it adds 1000% damage.
---
Yah the being kicked out of the mission part is not cool at all.
---
Yeah I am an Xbox player
---
In no way have I ever stated I've discovered something new or original, however you are entitled to your own negative opinion. What build are you running?
---
You can farm double the amount of XP in a casual team and open some lunch boxes to get a 100% XP boost so it’s literally like double xp everyday. People just enjoy being trolls that’s all it really is
---
It was one of the funniest encounters i have ever seen in this game.
---
I wish they added more interesting and fun stuff like this one.
---
is that a bug?
---
Psst - check his user name out.  He might bee a little too obsessed with our black and yellow friends.....  not sure we should trust him.....
---
I heard about someone not being able to get plasma cores, so I’m surprised fusion cores are fine. Unless that person was wrong...?
---
Beware of landmines
---
Wouldn't be a bethesda game without a million unresolved bugs years after release
---
Also the fancy weapons if you're lucky
---
If you're online now send me an invite. Same gt as here I have one you can have. Like I said it isn't a god roll but its better than a basic one.
---
Magic weapons get a lot of crap due to assholes ruining Scorched Earth and ACP by instakilling the bosses, it also relies on abusing a bug which isn't exactly fair play.
---
Damage was fine.
---
Nice, I wondered what was up with this challenge when I tried. Took a load of pictures and only the 1st counted. Figured it was another sludge lung challenge. Broken no matter how many times I get sludge lung.
---
Are you sure
---
I think its easier if you solo it
---
Since you can do daily ops solo and not in a team I just dont get it. I also got thumbs down for not being quick enough the other day. I was just having an off moment. I can usually hold my own. I am the kind of player who just goes for it.
---
I ran into this problem. Apparently it's the "Meat Sweets" effect you get from turning in 15 prime meats at once. Wait until that effect expires and it should return to normal again.
---
What about an unstoppables theme  run instead? Or maybe a Tales of West Virginia Run
---
Do you have meat sweats or whatever you get from the cook-out event? 
---
I had a similar problem with my hp not dropping low enough or dropping but jumping back up last meat week.
---
Yeah I got you
---
YES!!! YES!!!!! YAASSSSSS!!!
---
Even eso has a full respec system...
---
Do you have any blueprints
---
illuminati confirmed.
---
Honestly I hope they do new BoS themed paintjobs for regular armor + power armor, like they did with the Red Viper skins and the Armor Ace PA skins. I think it’s possible- if you look at the roadmap, the power armored soldier has a different skin on their suit than the ones you get from Forbidden Knowledge; it’s gray with a blue BoS emblem on the chest. Likewise there was a datamined ‘Steel Dawn Combat Armor’ that was gray with a red BoS logo on the shoulder.
---
Ok, I’ll send you an invite
---
Buy serums from players, use "starched genes" to "lock in" mutations - you can't gain or lose mutations.  Class freak reduces negative effects, strange in numbers increases positive effects when you're with a team.
---
Yea, I don't even bother looting enemies for .50 cal ammo. I can get enough resources to craft thousands of rounds in maybe 20 minutes. I doubt I'd get more than a few hundred rounds if I looted ever body.
---
Get the jetpack and secret service armor chest piece. Best quality of life investment out of it all
---
Ah thank you that must be it
---
I’m not high enough to start respeccing, is the meta game even playable without some bloodied or junkies build?
---
I'm thinking... just my opinion...Bethesda might be concerned about adding a chat module because of the toxicity it might generate.   Yakking on a microphone is one level as you can identify voice types...young, old, gender...but keyboard vileness can go hog wild.   As I said... just my opinion.
---
I killed a few enemies with gattling plasma and got no drops.
---
Sounds good I'll do that right now 😂 thanks again!
---
Software company rich off of software? you don't say?
---
what the hell kind of argument is that dude?
---
I was expecting a stealthed assualtron to sneak up and kill you right after you pressed the launch button.  Happened to me last night.  
---
Far from my first launch though.  Keep launching those things, it's always appreciated.  Congrats.
---
Yes, turns out meat sweats really is the reason. Thanks. Gotta be careful not to turn too many in at once
---
Yeah, I don't know what has been going on with the team kicking.  Been happening a lot.
---
Oh my God. Wtf
---
Or the fact that a lot of the tracks in FO4 would be impassable for a train. The grade change going down the hill near Greygarden comes to mind.
---
As I've been logging in through the day on the hour most servers I've joined the event was over in the first two minutes. Only one time today have I logged in and only seen an event with like a couple on drums and a couple running around.
---
I have had to equip white knight and lucky break just to farm prime cuts without my leg armor getting chewed through.  They were only lasting one event!
---
Ikr, I’ll just do daily ops solo from now on that’s all. No sweat off my back
---
I sent an invite
---
Wha? Didn’t anyone tell you not to cross meta streams?
---
Yes it’s good. It’s actually great. Obviously bloodied faster fire rate. Then you choose between reload speed and reduced weight. 
---
Thankfully PiazzaROY stepped in at the knick of time to save my rhyme with their ability to enunciate.
---
Oooooof tough crowd. Play me of John! :::old timey piano music:::
---
No prob! Glad it helped someone! Assumed it’d have helped more ppl, but nearly 5 months since my OP you’re the first comment. Happy I helped you out, that was the goal!
---
Also note, make an event team (or whatever), and join on others in the area. If you're collecting critters, you get double/triple/quad guts to put in the pot (as a team). If you're solo, you can't loot the critter corpses killed by other players but as a team one dude kills them, four loot them.
---
Welp if you’re on ps4 I’ll join you and  won’t hop out during the mission 😉
---
Morgan town airport?
---
Melee damage and unarmed damage are 2 different classifications. Always have been, always will be. They have had separate perks since release. Sorry mate.
---
I switch in the last round to my ultracite plasma gun and after completing I get 2 or 4 ultracite plasma cores.
---
Just pulled 3 star poisoner should I keep?
---
Fable, Forza, Recore, Ryse, State of Decay, Sunset Overdrive, Hellblade, and the Ori games also.
---
I’ve taken 3 legendary special cards: strength, endurance and agility and working to reshuffle my points already in those to other areas that need a boost. The perk cards in those areas were more beneficial to my character than the other legendary perks on offer. I did chose some qol legendaries though: ammo factory (might swap it out and use on an alt at a later time) infiltrator (if it’s locked I want to know what’s inside and do not enjoy the mini games) and take one for the team.
---
Please please please. I want this so badly and I didn't even know it.
---
Maybe that's what I did wrong.  My gatling gun drops rounds for everyone I kill, but the plasma didn't work the same.
---
Nice! My best solo time is 6:57 but I'm trying to come up with ways to improve that time.
---
I want the damn diving suit Bethesda. You had me wonder all around The Deep and put this dead guy in a sick diving outfit before me, and then tell me I can't have it as an outfit? Cruel..
---
Then you choose between reload speed and reduced weight.
---
That’s how u make it rhyme - I feel like that was too easy! :) haha
---
I've been using a qe handmade with no problems, all seem to be dropping critter chunks from a quick spray.
---
&gt; PA and photomode glitch would like to have a word with you about that theory. 
---
Don't forget just slow render when first approaching a camp. After once accidentally locking myself in someone's camp just by approaching the camp too quickly, I've learned to stand back and wait for the camp to render before I walk towards the camp.
---
I personally haven't tried the photomode glitch, but literally just seeing the words "power armor glitch" gave me enough info to know how to do that glitch, and sure enough that glitch works pretty easily. I tried the glitch on a house my wife has (we are now on public teams since they are so awesome) and she was a little surprised when she saw me inside her locked house.
---
Kill the boss with your plasma gun (ultracite?) and if you open the reward screen you see two or four plasma cores.
---
No problem man good luck! Should be really good with that stealth suit. Long as it says hidden when sneaking it should kick some ass.
---
Yeah the stealth suits unreal tbh, can just sneak past enemies so easily
---
ita good to stockpile junk for a month or two, then its a waste of your money
---
There are some items that don't spawn the same in private worlds like magazines, bobbleheads and power armor. I'm not sure what the specific spawn criteria are on those on private but it feels entirely random. And I'm talking "just went to biv to reset all loot spawns" and spawn points are empty. Power armor frames around watoga are the most noticeable in this because i never pick those up but you'll see only one or two or none are there on private servers. Anyway. Enough rambling. I still think it's worth.
---
Ah gotcha, then I probably did get them.  Yea I totally misunderstood.  I though we were talking about looting corpses.
---
So, He forms a daily ops team, you join, jump right into the Ops without waiting for him(was it even a full team?) and you proceed to speed through it without him?
---
Needs it modded or do you know the ones you need?
---
Bro I got a f***ing legacy for half of these drops, you can def score something nice as well.
---
There’s a bug with one of the new Legendary perks. Make sure you’re in pacifist mode and you won’t be able to be killed like that again
---
Yes, at the opposite end of the airport from where you spawn in, where the metal sheds are, on the path is a flare gun, set it off.
---
What you mean
---
What about Vats Unknown?
---
When I started the daily opps for the first time I had 18 ultracite plasma cores, now I have 67😊
---
I have Nerd Rage too. I've seen people mention bloody mess but the description doesn't describe any increase in DPS
---
and if youre lucky, mr prize bot will lend you 100 dolars
---
Right. Spose duping has made everything old quite “priceless”
---
"over"
---
Odd, it's always dropped exactly 100 for me, every time.
---
Like at that bench I have a bunch of mods for it so if you want like powerful automatic different scope/reflex sight. Silenced that kind of thing
---
Why not? I personally have a *** bloodied, 33% vats hit chance, faster movement when aiming that's my go-to for bosses. Ultracite ammos are easy to farm now with the daily ops. All you have to do is pull it out before the boss dies.
---
Get used to those shovels mate
---
It definitely increases dps. Are you full health or bloodied build?
---
What effects does it have?
---
I only have 10 mods unlocked
---
So I don’t have much on it, the only think I’ve changed is a longer barrel and the receiver as that’s all I have to improve it
---
Ok if you give it back I have almost all of them I think
---
Pacifist is your friend
---
15 percent reduce damage while blocking and 75 chance to reduce player dam by 8
---
I usually get home around 1am cst, id be happy to give ya some ammo if that’s not too late for you. (Sometimes a bit later but usually not much later.)
---
I did give away and used a lot of my last batch, I’ll have to make some more and I’m low on lead so it may take a tad longer to make than usual for me.
---
Well, if you would have,  you could have moved a point out of perception to another special.  I've put my points into specials to be able to use more regular cards,  maybe dumb?
---
I didn’t start anything, I literally just loaded into that sever and I seen the notification pop up saying so and so started a daily ops so I went and joined the team and their was one other player so we were just breezing through, I figured the other guy didn’t join cause he was busy doing something else. Even if we started without him you can run daily ops as many times as you like, I’m not waiting get your shit and let’s go. You shouldn’t have to craft ammo/stims or anything you get all that excessively when running daily ops
---
How do I drop it for you?
---
Do I just click drop on it?
---
X
---
Especially for the Fallout 1st members
---
Can't be killed if you turn that option off
---
It was. But you got their first so you get the credit.
---
It says this item can’t be dropped otherwise it will destroy the item
---
Yep
---
What's your DR when running this test?
---
Wait didn't put a skin on it did you?
---
Yeah never really cared too much to make sure all you English teachers are able to read correct grammar but I’m sure you get the point!! Btw I got my last post removed because it was “ clickbait” lol again it’s obvious I could give two shits and made another one !! Carry on my fellow English teacher ! Or you’re a salty Bethesda employee! Which would honestly make my day!
---
That's really not cool. I don't get why the hell anyone stays in an Ops team. You only get the XP from actually doing the ops, if you're not going to do them,  get out of those teams. I had the worst time the other night trying to find people to do them with. I joined a couple of teams, no one from the team showed up, so I left that team after a few minutes of waiting and emoting and getting no response from them. 
---
I also had a weird instance where I joined a team, two people showed up, then abruptly left the team. I guess they didn't want to run it with a female character or something, afraid my bloody gal would show them up in their power armor, I guess.
---
OG goes reeeeee
---
Yeah I did I put dark matter on it
---
Active enough that it takes a few server hops to drop camp in the same place.
---
Ammo can be a big cap sink from player vendors. Serums. Those expensive whitesprings plans. I buy every vendor recipe except .38 receivers and scopes
---
There is an area in the map with valevs ye can turn, what do they do?
---
I can just make it default appearance can’t I
---
You'll have to take that off before it will let you
---
sounds like its doable but idc either way just gimme mischief night :////////
---
If you can feed it, you can keep it. 
---
The only reason not to use a gauss minigun is ammo consumption.
---
Say that again
---
Can do
---
Awesome ideas. Not a chance in hell though. We will probably get another nerf to guns lol
---
I’m English
---
Well gonna do this ass soon as I get home and sign on!
---
I'm a salty teacher
---
Idk people have always been weird in online game’s. That’s why I prefer single player games, people annoy me too much
---
thank you so much. i've been server hopping and running around ike a madman
---
Thank you so much, I appreciate it
---
Berserkers is about low DR. Remove your armor  and under armor and try it.
---
I've had 5000 atoms waiting wanting to spend them but nothing decent. Always nice but pointless furniture. How about a nice inside toilet Bethesda!?
---
seems to be working exactly as intended. the non legendary gets a boost from your perks when equipped and the berserker fixer loses damage when equipped because you have armor on. what is the issue?
---
How do 24 hour sales even work? I’ve been checking everyday since the latest Mothman bundle for one, but saw none pop up. Only ones I ever buy would be the camp walls, collectron, vending machines, etc. The greenhouse one I missed due to being new, and I would have loved the Planetarium.
---
Should be wall decor, I think
---
probably wall decor
---
Most of the stuff I've wanted like BoS camp items, heavy weapon and PA skins seem to be getting added through Seasons. The Ace T-45 skin looks great and has got me using that again over my T-65. Even the Ace Wallpaper and military floor are stuff I've wanted for my BoS outpost style base. So I can't complain.
---
Beserkers is higher damage for lower damage resistance.  This means that you'll get the highest damage when you are in your underwear and lowest damage when in armour.
---
Typically a bloodied build (low health) has armour that gives it high damage resist so that you don't die from a radroach bite.  This is the opposite of what you want for a Beserkers weapon. 
---
What you need for a Bloodied build is a Bloodied weapon.
---
Not the first time, but a popular game doesnt need to design much mechanisms. It could be better
---
Sorry to hear that hope “you’re” day gets better👍
---
I just realized today that I had run out of adhesive, so I will be farming later. Too many armor repairs since patch 22 and my nest egg from my FO1st scrap box is dwindling of all the goodies.
---
What?
---
if you played last season and got gold bullion rewards then thats where
---
No, only you can craft ramdom legendary piece armor
---
plus mad expensive
---
The more likely explanation is that it's going to be released alongside or as part of a BoS themed pack when the BoS update drops.
---
It would be nice if people could cram the notion that there's all of this BoS stuff coming up and that's when they should expect to see BoS themed items in the atom shop instead of whining every week that it isn't for sale yet.
---
I'd say it's unlikely we get a season directly themed after the BoS, at least for a while.  For now they're been leaning more on unique themes like space and this GI Joe meets Iron Man thing.  That lets them add unique season rewards with little to no relation to lore while saving more faction oriented stuff for in game rewards or the atom shop.
---
How about a mummy display or mannequin for cloth?
---
Pipe pistol I thought was not a revolver. Agree 10mm SMG should be able to have a silencer. I never played around with once and I’m surprised it doesn’t have a silencer option.
---
Yummy!
---
Roll for a weightless set then if you're always in PA. No there's no non-legendary versions of the armor. Or like the rest of us roll for unyielding that you can hop into for trading with the bots.
---
What level are you?
---
Bingo the endgame system ESO has can be respecced for gold and it’s very little gold in the scheme of things.  76’s system is poorly conceived and punishes the players so much more.
---
Oh, and yes, your regular gun will show different damage numbers in inventory when you have a weapon equipped that has damage modifier such as Junkies.  Just as the Junkies would show lower damage numbers when a regular weapon is equipped.   
---
The only way to see the real damage numbers is when you equip the weapon.
---
Yeah because all these morons keep putting money In their pockets with no effort on their part !! Maybe stop feeding the company snacks and eventuality they will get hungry !!
---
Yep, it's not the grind that troubles me, it's that there's no guarantee that it will EVER lead to getting what you want no matter how long you play. I didn't mind scraping away for tiny slivers of rep each day, because I knew there was an end in sight, months down the line. And since there's no shortage of grinds in this game, I see no reason they can't let us have something to improve our odds of ending up with what we want. It can still be damn grindy. I'd gladly use 10 or 20 legendary modules for the chance to re-roll the legendary effect of my choice on a piece of armor.
---
No, unfortunately you can't make a non-legendary set.
---
The boss drops ammo for whatever weapon you have equipped?
---
Where is the football table in the camp build menu?
---
I have it unlocked and can’t find it
---
Level 64
---
Same spot as regular flamingo
---
Is this why someone would randomly run into my camp and start trying to bash me with their gun?  This happened last night. I guess I never check to see if they had a bounty out on him.
---
It's a bloodied build that is completely scattered on perks.
---
Your shotgun is just a 'magic' shotgun. It's not the build, its just a bugged weapon that does that.
---
[What do you think of my bloodied build?](https://twitter.com/i/status/1308902054358904832)
---
Bloodied 50% limb damage 90%rw Napalmer, 4x Unyielding. At least one of my armor pieces is actually broken here lol
---
[What about a non-bloodied, non-covert-operative Vats Crit build?](https://twitter.com/i/status/1273589833319854081)
---
1star two shot railway rifle, 0x unyielding (4x ap gen though)

Wow what a surprise!! !!! Lolololol just keep putting money in their pockets cause that will make it better lololol but you damn well know if you posted about a dupe glitch then a bethesda employee would be In this post a minute later trying to get In contact with you!! This company needs a complete clean out and I hope Microsoft does just that!! Yeah I’m calling you out                    “   community manager” Val whatever
---
I'm pretty sure it depends on your graphics card.
---
Tested at violent night quest
---
Me: gtx 970 with 9th gen cpu, dropped as low as 40 fps from 100+
---
Friend: gtx 1080ti, 10th gen cpu (shouldn't be much different from 9th) stayed at 100 fps.
---
My friend would get similar frames outside (about 10-20% higher than me), but he would get nothing as bad as a 60%+ drop in frames in certain areas that I've compared with him.
---
Thing to note: Apparently fo76 likes no less than 6 physical cores.
---
We are both using the same heavily modified config that turns off a lot of post processing and shadows for max frame advantage.
---
Conjecture: There are some problems with older cards rendering certain elements FO76 utilizes that will cause heavy drop frames. Newer cards Pascal onwards seem to do a good job (not sure about AMD equivalent).
---
I would love a Shoutgun... Fus...RODAH! And all the enemies are pushed back so you can shoot freely again.
---
Ok thanks guy's! Began to become a real pain in the ass getting killed and teabagged every day
---
Can't wait for the Doomguy and Master Chief helmets to come through.
---
If you don’t care about the effects, just get the plans and the best mods, then craft one of each piece and mod them with buttressed and ultra-light. 
---
I’m curious as to why you want to wear armor at all if you’re mostly in PA and don’t care about the legendary effects of your regular armor.
---
What's the overall DR value of your character? As a Berserker, it should be as close to zero as possible or zero but never negative.
---
I ran rifle for a while until I had a good supply of ammo. Then I switched to commando, and it's pretty much the same. I can fire quicker which is helpful for higher level enemies, but for everything else I just tap the fire button. Right now damage seems to be taking a second to register too, so I've found I could load 10 bullets into a ghoul before it went down, but if I just tapped it, I'd only use 2
---
That's what I want to here, you are hired, even though I don't work for Bethesda! 
---
This is the kind of concepts I like to see with in this game, for all seasonal events. With no disrespect to the development team at Bethesda, sometimes it just fresh Ideas and new concepts that make a world of difference, especially amongst us old timers ⏲️ that have stuck with you through thick and thin. 
---
I like the efforts made over the last two years, mind you I prefer less complicated and more realistic things to do with in this game, and I am sure  at least 60% of this community feels the same. I may be wrong, but hey what wrong with being optimistic at the end of the day.
---
 As old saying goes "KISS 💋 " And I not saying anyone is stupid, I am just saying keeping things simple, can be just as fun as more complicated events. And too be honest with you this was just one of the things that kept me playing over the last two years, I want it to be atleast another two years, if all goes well. 
---
I  wish you, and everyone all the best! 🙂👍👊❤
---
Only looks like a few more damage per-shot. Any other hidden benefits that would make it worth building cores instead of farming them?
---
Sounds awesome!
---
Um...okay? Good for you I guess
---
No the plasma cores are a reward after completing the daily opps. I always use my plasma gating laser to kill the boss, all other enemies I kill with a normal vampire explosive gating gun.
---
Radiation rumble, all the ghouls there drop pre war money.
---
Apparently they were rich or something before the bombs dropped.
---
Awesome stuff, that vats crit build is the best! I like using those perks!
---
I received that same beserkers fixer last night from the ACP event.  Tested it by taking all armor and perk stat buffs off.  It worked as expected. Damage went up.
---
I sold it today for 1776 caps.  Are you on PC?  You may have bought it from me.
---
Overall a good interview! I would have like to have seen you ask Jeff about some of the bugs that have been in the game for a long time they seem to be struggling to fix (e.g. the fast travel bug and the damage bug), or just a bit more on how much they balance bug fixes vs adding new content.
---
Couple of cool tidbits that jumped out at me:
---
- Todd Howard still gives design input.
---
- I got a good laugh out of his comment about not knowing exactly when patch 23 will come out because there are a lot of cool games coming out in Fall they are excited to play (I suspect there will be a lot of leave requests for November 19-20).
---
They're concentrated Evil...
---
If you’re under level 70 you shouldn’t participate, you’re not going to do anything to help, and are taking the spot of someone that will actually do something..
---
6pm uk reset I’m always in ops for exp n legendary then 6pm all new op again.levelled up loads since they started. I was 419 now I’m 448 in just over a week it’s insane
---
Try me and my mountain of railroad spikes
---
First daily ops rewarded me a quad explosive railway rifle, I slapped an autopiston on that bitch and only use it duing daily ops. Now I have enough railway spikes to set up a continental railway straight to Mariposa Military Base, I drop *hundreds* and still have over 2k at any time
---
What mutations do you use?
---
Probably just people not realizing it. I've messed with the settings before and just thought it was a pasty game 🤷‍♂️ till last night i hooked it up to the tv in our bedroom and the colors hell even the shadows looked way better! And they're both vizios! I was thinking well this can't be right..so after some digging i came across your post really thankful! I've been playing the game like this washed out for about a 1yr and 1/2
---
Btw any form of language is a social construct but of course you would never try and teach that
---
Goddammit, Jin Yang!
---
*Santa Claus boot in face*
---
&gt; All you have to do is pull it out before the boss dies.
---
That's good advice for many things.
---
Ummmmm I have wondered that myself. Lol I think I always just did it because if I was ever out of my suit for something in the world and was attacked I wouldn't be able to get back into my suit in time. I have been thinking about that recently tho...
---
I was in the burning mine or whatever it is today and I was totally lost and the other player kept using the come here emote.  I could not figure out how to get to him.  I knew what we were supposed to do but it did not matter.
---
As long as it's all the lore friendly stuff.
---
My magic minigun still works.
---
Finally, someone with the guts to mention this.
---
Pork scratchings, fatty bacon, blood pudding with chopped pork fat 😜
---
Picked one up from a vendor for 5k
---
Yeah I’ve been getting kicked a lot since yesterday
---
It never even crossed my mind to level that. You can manually pick and hack everything with rank 1 which is good enough for me.
---
Oh you can run pistols. They just make the game harder for you. I have a pistol character, but that’s one of 4 characters lol
---
Wanted to make a pirate so I grabbed a costume, hat and 10 Blackpowder Pistols + a Revolver as a backup. It’s mostly playable, but most importantly it’s fun. Just using VATS to let the computer do the aiming and switch guns after each shot.
---
My main character uses heavy weapons, another one melee, and the last one is an archer. All of those work, but the heavy shreds the best.
---
If you wanna go pistols though, try it. Maybe a pistol sneak build with silencers and sneak perks.
---
Well considering i was lvl 220 and everyone else was at least over 120. We just didnt have 3 bloodied melees crawling around. From what i could tell, everyone was high health build with heavies.
---
I've posted on there a couple of times when I was doing Project Paradise and actually had peeps show up. Give it a go.
---
bUt CoNtEnT iS MeAnT tO bE BuRnEd ThRoUgH iN a DaY. \*Stairs ar THOUSANDS OF NOTES\*

I thought that was just for tradeing/selling...thats why I never tried there. Good to know.

Ooo nice! Thanks helps a bit thanks. :)
---
Not bloodied

84 but I'm a tryhard
---
33
---
O_o
---
Oh yeah i forgot, adrenal reaction, marsupial and demon speed
---
It’s called Armor Ace.
---
i just hit 50 earlier today, im sort of going ham, but im also taking breaks here and there.. plus i cannot play much on work days
---
They made a post the day the update went live about charisma not counting twords shareable perks
---
I was strongly encouraged to try stealth bloody commando (I was messing with regular bloody rifleman at the time). Watching this, it seems to me that unless you're going to do stealth sniper, putting perks into sneak doesn't make much sense, especially if you're on teams. The fact that you can't get sneak bonuses even when two different NPCs are fighting each other seems to me to make sneak bonuses even more useless.
---
Am I missing something? If you're a team, non sniper player, it seems that sneak damage perks (Covert Operative, Mister Sandman, Ninja, Follow Through) are not worth investing in. It feels to me like the only reason for me to invest in other sneak perks (Sneak, Escape Artist) is to try and prevent aggro. But I'm thinking it might make more sense to invest more points in other things (action boy, adrenaline, Gun fu, maybe even white knight).
---
Do I have this right?
---
19 but I'm not trying that hard.
---
It works. Did Encryptid like that, too. Had a bunch of people and a successful run of it.
---
I really like this idea...! Seems to be an agreeable compromise between those who want to have fun and play a bit more casually but also provide the opportunity of a challenge for those who desire it.
---
I eventually scrapped my turrets and at this point I'm convinced they attract hostiles more frequently. I'm set up outside the food plant in the forest and it's been weeks since I had a genuine attack, Instead it's some wondering mob that drifted away from the workshop to attack my flamingo's. Same applied in other regions like divide and toxic valley.
---
There is your issue.  Get a couple Bloodied damage dealers in your mix and you will have a better time of her.
---
As a team event, you will need at least 2 of your 8 to be heavy damage dealers.  High health heavies arnt there to deal damage, they are there to live through it.
---
Ive done this quite a few times post patch, and the longest fight thus far has been around 7 minutes.
---
29 but I still have a few weeklies left to do and haven't done any of the NW dailies.
---
34
---
That will bump up your dps
---
If you just want protection when you hop out then pretty much any set of combat or scout will have you covered.  Even then you want it to be legendary no matter what kind of effects because it's always better than no stars.  Or just rock the Chinese stealth suit underneath since it has fairly decent stats plus stealth and is pretty light.
---
If you hardly ever get out though then just don't wear armor at all.  All it really does is weigh you down.
---
I hate that event...not as much as paradise tho...but im a big gun dummy in power armour who just like to be told shoot this thing till it stops moving oorah!!
---
How do you know if you are in the same world?
---
If you are on a really popular spot you can have hard time to log in.
---
No, but I saw the guy running for his life from an angry chicken.
---
Yeah I understand that but selling from one system to another should be ok with an auction house.
---
Not bad. Every second counts when you want to be the fastest!
---
That's what muting is for.
---
19 or 20... i forget
---
Ive been skipping the NW and OPs ones
---
Haha nw. Like one of the users said, roll for weightless then. That way, the pieces don’t take up too much carry weight.
---
Honestly, in your case, I would just wear the Chinese stealth armor suit. Only weighs 5 carry weight and provides 140 DR/ER at max level. Better than spending a ton of scrip rolling for specific SS armor.
---
I never thought of just the stealth suit...It just sits on the shelf collecting dust anyway
---
We call those "Christmas lights" ... with a grumble and a groan - they tend to have the uncanny ability to show up at the most inopportune time and really ruin your day...
---
&gt; Was there much difference between the western and the .44 in Fallout 4 though?
---
The Western Revolver is an end-game revolver
---
It's the best Revolver in FO4.
---
&gt; I never played nuka world so missed this gun.
---
Basically all the gear from Nuka-World are end-game tiered.
---
Like the Handmade rifle vs the Assault rifle or the Disciples Blade vs the Combat Knife
---
I far from instakill either of those bosses. I've been wondering what people use to do that.
---
That is correct.
---
There's no map markers while a capture zone is active. The first one I did I was wandering around wondering where the hell I was supposed to go. I have a bit of sympathy for people wandering around lost, especially lower levels, as a result.
---
Yeah I missunderstood the effect entirely... looks kinda useless compared to a full set of unyielding? Any suggestions how to lower ones dr?\^
---
I was spawning near my where my camp was meant to be and every time I looked it was the same half finished shanty house
---
No, these are the top tier items that should be really hard to change. Also, you should have a lot of experience in the game before playing with them. I'd also suggest from reading the comments below that people really should read more about the perks, watch the videos etc. before spending those coins.
---
Is there a reason that you're being needlessly antagonistic?
---
Yea I know, but I’d like it to be added to the activity that drains my condition more
---
Ah, yes, Big Iron. I loved that gun and Marty Robbins' song. You just convinced me to go back.
---
It wasn’t nerfed by 90%
---
TBH the local maps were often really hard to follow when multiple levels were involved.
---
As long as there is 8 ppl with decent weapons I’ve finished it within ten to 20 minutes about 7 times since patch I did fail once when everyone left before fight started except me a level 330 and then two others which where 200+ but one used a Gatling gun and other used a pitch fork. Yes you read correctly, a pitch fork. That one was a fail.
---
Unless u pvp: ignore any piece that reduces player damage. Caveat to that is always try to get 2 piece of fall resist for that sweet jetpack life. (2 of my first 4 were and they will be the last replaced guaranteed)
---
Well thanks for the one guy who gave positive input.
---
I appreciate the rest of you coming to bitch and whine. Glad to see the community is full of a bunch of butthurt people over a PVE game. Jesus...
---
That's a melee PVP piece.
---
With one bullet
---
Parent companies only gets a tiny drip of profits off MTX.
---
Thanks. Im building commando perks and will try it soon. Now that I have Ammo Factory and The Ammosmith both maxed, ammo shouldn't be a problem
---
Last one is definitely the most valuable.
---
I’m 35 and I play only around 2 hours a night before bed once wife and kids goto bed. I have done every challenge except most of the nw challenges. I hit the 10k xp so many times during 2 hours of play. It’s easy this season. Shit I think 3 weeks in or 4 last season I was just getting to 40.
---
I've been waiting on the Enclave Power Armor for months
---
Bethesda logic
---
I'm opposite. I just started leveling up a 3rd character and the amount of times I had to get on mike and tell people this is an alt my other 2 are level 300 and 210 i don't need anything was staggering. I mean I was level 5 within a scout mask, hunters long coat and explosive weapons. You'd think they'd figure It out.😂
---
Miscellaneous
---
0
---
Sounds like you're just unlucky with groups. Don't think I've ever failed it and I only play with randoms. What ranged weapon you using? If you're bloodied a b 50 cal or fixer/HM should do solid damage without any perks invested.
---
Is it possible we all are from different regions of the world 🌎 🤔 
---
My reset time has been 12:00 pm every day in Canada, Toronto, Eastrn Central Time 🇨🇦  so, maybe this is were the confusion is comming from. Just a thought. I could be wrong, and if I am I apologize for putting my 2 cents in were it doesn't belong. Lol.
---
That’s pretty much where I’m at now. I put all my legendary items up for 10caps/ scrip value unless they’re God Tier. Its not even worth it to scrip items that aren’t locked to your character because you need that scrip to get rid of trash rolls on the endgame armor/weapons
---
25. Haven’t played today yet.
---
I swear the animation they use for them running makes it look like they should be running a lot faster than they do.
---
Oh so the early events are good once again for XP. Did not think of that. Thanks.
---
ty
---
Set off a nuke, light up the night!
---
I think that’s a good point that’s not well known - if you cancel your subscription the scrap box remains and you can still take scrap out of it ie it’s not lost forever.
---
It's what called all the resources to be used that lead to the great war.
---
Edit: Used* not called.
---
...recently?
---
Wall decor being it’s signs
---
that tends to happen on a fresh login for me, best way to skip it is to check the scoreboard before triggering any score increase.
---
Red rider bebe gun! You are going to shoot your eye 👁 out! Yez please. 
---
I wish you all the best! 👍
---
How do you know it's not? iirc you can't display igpu rendering through a dgpu.
---
Yes, so do the daily ops too!
---
Hey, your tv remote has a mute button. That'll fix the problem for you.
---
Totally sniffed it cause I just had to know what happens. Such a fun little part of the game.
---
Are you noticing this when you're in the daily ops? If so- one of the enemy attributes can be that they can detect you better, making your sneak redundant
---
Edit: spelling
---
I’m... cautiously optimistic and yet mildly perturbed at the lack of updates around this.
---
Similar to Hack and Slash, this new legendary perk would have a 20/30/40/50% chance of staggering your target per shoutgun VATS usage. At rank 4 it will also ragdoll enemies, inflicting additional damage when they collide with the environment!
---
Yes, I have found them.. all 4 are locked even though I own the free one from the atom store
---
Thanks I'll keep that in mind, I probably won't play again until the weekend
---
I got a flamer last one and the other one I got to do today failed badly. Like how does a event like that fail. I joined server it was already down to two minutes and yup failed and there was a lot of ppl there. Only thing I received so far this event that I didn’t have yet was spicy mod for tendy. I now need salty mod and tato salad and then I’ll have it all
---
I've had it where I've recognised a bunch of CAMPS when I've tried to jump servers, so either the entire server jumped with me and we ended up in the same server or the game shit itself and put me straight back in the same server. I know what I'm leaning towards hahaha
---
I nuke WS, run through, reconnect and repeat until the zone is gone.
---
Doing the same where the flux is concentrated.
---
You don't see the issue with your statement? They want you logging in as much as possible.
---
Naa, WS is easier to run.
---
Thanks, I'll probably play this weekend so I'll keep that in mind
---
you have to quit to menu then re-try. Source: kept putting me on the same world where I was in a nukezone until I did this. 
---
Quality game.
---
Fix the respawn bug first it is more game breaking then OMG I have to click something again.
---
I’ve got a lead run that nets me about 600 pieces (without Lucky Hole Mine) and also pushes the loot list past the 180/256 limit. So then I can just server hop (or log out for a few minutes) and then jump in and do it again. 
---
600 lead in about 25 minutes becomes 9600 5.56 rounds.
---
It needs to be wired. It has 1 connector on the platform. The rest of the protruding rods are just for show. The size of the super reactor is exactly the size of 4 floor squares.
---
NnnnnNNNNOTTAFINGAH!!!!!
---
Sounds like a great idea. Can you put perk pack bubble gum in it? I saved perk packs for legendary perks and opened like 20 perk packs and got tons of the bubble gum.
---
Hitz from the bong. 💥👍👊
---
Must be just me then cause nukes used to drop one after the other on monogah all day long then patch hit. Only saw one nuke day after then nothing till today. Out of 15-20 people in the server only 6 showed up? Thats my point is that its just not happening like it used to and that was what i believe the reason is to why. I used to run bloodied but the constant back and forth between bloodied outside of daily ops and full health during daily ops got to be a hassle so i stayed full health. Because im pumping good damage bloodied but all around more fun my playstyle as full health. It just trying to figure out why nobody is doing the event anymore.
---
Ok, I recommend start working with on your perks.
---
How do you like to play? You mentioned a fixer, commando builds are the way to go with that. For heavy weapons you want strength, which also works for melee once you collect the perks.
---
If most of your perk cards are for carrying more or really anything besides doing more damage you are going to be under powered
---
I hit 45 today and I am done for the day now. Tomorrow I should hit 48-49 unless I want to dump extra gold for more lunchboxes.
---
4 months and lvl 200?? Ive been playing since B.E.T.A. and im only 155. I must be doing something wrong lol
---
i absolutely get the issue with the statement. that's why i think it's a shit design for end game. it has the opposite effect on me.
---
Old news, use the search function on reddit.
---
Full xp buffs server hopping rad rumbles?
---
3 in sneak, 1 hiding in plain sight, no unyielding. I’ve had 0 problems with Primal Cuts as a AAE Commando. I’m still I. Hidden or caution and killing everything with ease.
---
5mm and fuel drop in quantities of 20-50 per enemy. it’s nuts especially if you use a gatling gun.
---
I used to play stealth but that doesn’t help when it comes to fighting bosses and big enemies, I’ll have a look into builds tomorrow
---
Gotta dress up some locals in black n white stripes, and the Red Ryder will one shot only Black Bart.  Also, it better have a compass in the stock.

Its not even October yet, hold your horses.

Lol, kinda reminds of those days.. wasn't this rough though when I was level 68. Now 5-6 mins and...
---
Grats.
---
Some of the players in this game are... unique
---
literally just happened to me. I don't have other games do this, and I'm hoping it's not a sign of a more deeper "inside the console" problem.  
---
here's hoping it's either a one off or they patch it out
---
P:reventing aggro for yourself even if your team isn't sneaking is still a very valuable thing to have. If you're after the damage boosters/detection reducers that the sneaky cards give you go for it, but if you think you can better serve your build or playstyle with other cards, that's something that you need to decide. However, Sneak takes your sneaky damage from 2x to 2.5x not a whole lot at first glance but it serves well say for a bloodied who can min max that 2.5 into something rather scary :) You can still sneak as usual and save the points for elsewhere!
---
Straight up just rock "Frankenstein" uny for the effects til you gear out. Wear a cool outfit til you can flex. We believe in you
---
As much as they really really need a buff, heck they needed a buff before they got nerfed!
---
Alas all this is going to end up causing is them nerfing tesla rifles!

Not every corpse has the holotape, that's random.

[I had to log back into that character to see what it was using](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4a185df&amp;d=pg0pi0ph0p02pp2lr2lk2lv0l71l22a72c72cu0ic4ao0lt2s71ar1a30au2a00cm2po0ek0s01sb1&amp;m=5cf6i&amp;am=1h27-1c26-1g2731-172134-1g27&amp;wp=w6&amp;wm=1k&amp;n=RWR%20vats%20crit)
---
I haven't logged into that one since before season 1 when I decided I wanted to do a totally different build and not slowly change the build and made a new character.
---
It could definitely be dramatically improved with the legendary perks. I still have a TSE RWR sitting in my other characters stash I meant to give to it.
---
I always get more excited for the returning items
---
Because my gpu usage is at 2%
---
I'm sitting at 5.5k Atoms right now because literally nothing there interests me.
---
I got the huge-ass generator today that I'm not sure WTF to do with it right now. That thing would be handy to have around, though.
---
Alright, thanks!
---
This is like the 23433 post about this man. At this point I'm starting to lose hope
---
mannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn i fucking love this questline. Make sure you read and listen to everything.
---
I'm glad it wasn't just me. I got attached and turrets opened fire just as I hit launch.
---
It’s great ain’t it
---
Exactly. I hate the daily ops because I could easily solo it in 8 minutes or less if I actually knew where I was going lol
---
Haha yeah that’s what I heard so wanted to try it out!
---
I ‘soloed’ him once after doing SBQ. Saw there’s someone still in the ACR event so I quickly joined his team and FT’d into the event, he was totally swamped by spawns and Earle was at full hp. it was my commando toon with a vampiric gat laser, I just kept blasting him non stop and killed him when the timer has less than a minute left. Had i died even once it would’ve failed. It’s just my survival weapon and I figured if I could stay alive I’d be able to grind his hp away, and it worked.
---
Thanks, so any armor piece just with the unyielding effect.
---
You’re not playing the game wrong, just differently. One if my closest friends has a similar mindset and we co exist just fine; him with his self found gear, and I with my trader gear.
---
Mama dolces has food scatter around
---
Yeah ppl said that about the bugs in this game when it first released, and I still can't fast travel half the time.
---
I'd argue with you that's a bullshit reason and counterargue that there are builds viable for you to melee something to death. 
---
You can't go "haha pistols are meant for sidearm, that's why they suck dummy", and run around with a fucking bloodied melee weapon , THAT doesn't make any fucking sense. Unarmed and Melee is INCREDIBLY viable and strong. 
---
Your logic is that pistols are sidearms and that's why they're weak. Well Melee is meant to be a last resort tactic unless you're rocking a power armor and super sledge, but all kinds are powerful and viable and usedin end game. 
---
Your excuse is bullshit.
---
Saw two today in different vendors at 1000.
---
Xp grinding spec ops meat week stuff and a lil wallet warrior
---
Justifying extreme anti social behaviors/introversion is such a first world enabled thing. If I was struggling in a 3rd world fucking country, I don't have the privilege to not go out and get a job and interact with others. I'd starve and die. I WILL have to muster up the guts to work with others regardless of if I am not socially inclined.
---
It's as complex as people's privilege and excuses make it to be.
---
Your whole thread proves it: Just join a feature, zero change to playstyle, reap benefits. Somehow headasses STILL are uncomfortable with the fact. It's worse than OCD imo.
---
Actually a trend with this fo76 community. Many threads full of babies that  refuse to adapt to new systems. The damage recalculation really showed that.
---
Funny thing is, the Nuclear Winter although small, lowkey represents this community a lot more. Everyone's friendly until they get stomped by someone that knows how to hold a mouse and then cry cheats.
---
It's never about them playing better. It's always an excuse for their own comfort. Let me connect the analogy: Builds get nerfed, and people cry. Instead of using better builds (actual lvl 100+ players, not sub50), they try to Burger King it and cry "BUT I WANNA HAVE IT MY WAY BOOHOO!". Yea sorry Karen, but you're going to have to move away from your Pipe Pistol. Same thing in NW, just more toxic: Noobs get stomped (seriously these players have the worst positioning, movement, and even worse aim) and then hackusate instead of reflecting on how they can do better lol.
---
TL;DR, move out of your fucking comfort zones and enjoy the rest of what life has to offer you gormless tossers.
---
Well that's good to know. Just bought 76 for pc but have been playing for playstation awhile but heard it's not as active as console
---
Anti armor on shotguns
---
Yup! If you vendor hop youll have good odds. Also make friends and TELL them. Odds of success greater thru networking. Im on ps4 but i believe u got this! (Remember to stock items u dont use others do in case of trade: GL) :)
---
I wouldn't go stealth since they're removing the ability to stealth in ops and events.
---
I've been thinking about this as well, and I think part of the problem is that not only is there the 150 a day cap on scrip, but when you spend that scrip you get a new legendary item, which means you're almost certainly going to either scrip that item, OR scrip the one it replaces. Either way, if you hand Mumbles 150 scrip, you're likely putting 40% of that (60 scrip) right back into the machine. So most days you're only able to put 90 scrip of 'new' drops into the grinder before you're stuck again.
---
Being able to trade scrip for something besides other scripables (Lunchboxes? Bullion?) would help alleviate that issue.

---
I'm kinda afraid of getting that one. It's new, so you want to display it. But I've got my fusion generator packed into a nice neat little shed.
---
If they do that, I’d imagine it’d be handled like the Strangler Heart PA. Kind of just adding a set bonus to a pre-existing PA. I wouldn’t be opposed to it, I suppose. I’m just tired of waiting to get my gold for the things I want. I have like 200 treasury notes
---
This, if people don’t shove explosive Gatlings down your throat to take it. This and ammo factory have the most PvP for some reason
---
Radiation Rumble. The glowing ones and ghouls carry tons of pre war money.
---
Can we also upgrade the unique one to level 50? Mine spawned at 20.
---
Ideally this would be the case and everything BoS themed will be through a vendor in-game. But I think I remember reading somewhere on fallout76.com that next season will be BoS themed.
---
get carnivore or herbivore and source food as you go.
---
Ber needs BUFF, period. The risk and reward ratio is a joke.
---
27 mainly by just the repeatable xp (cran relish/meat stew + brain fungus soup + well rested + berry mentats)
---
Lul. Imagine needing to actually loot legendary enemies because you don’t have mules full of godroll gear
---
For Daily Ops and events I usually put on T65 PA for the tough ones anyway and Stealth Armor for everything else. Unless it's like Tea Time or something simple.
---
People are farming the Wendigo spawn for acid and screws most likely.
---
Weird. Good luck.
---
Too lazy to read. The quick drop down of the survival tent in some situations actually is good for survival. Just drop it and run in and hide. Able to hike most of the bigger hard hitting mobs.
---
It's for shelters when they come later this year really, the generator I mean.
---
Thanks for sharing in my enthusiasm and not at all being sarcastic!
---
Dude wahhhh just leave the server lmao
---
Ya, walked away from Radiation rumble with 127 pre-war money to scrap, plus all the xp, so I think that’s the most efficient way
---
As in "maiden voyage"... His first time.
---
Thanks mate. I can be sure to ask him that next time I interview someone from the team/
---
That’d be cool since we wouldn’t have to pay for it but I’m tired of just getting skins for pre-existing guns. They need to add more guns! Maybe the R91, the Assault Carbine, a Browning .38 or an M60 looking gun that functions similar to the MG-42 but uses different ammo.
---
PA doesn't need to be more op.
---
I feel u
---
I made it fit in a small place by removing my foundations building it and putting the foundations over/around it, that works well
---
It’s strong if you do not care about the diminishing returns from DR/ER and all the RNG required to get an optimal set.
---
Or at least a mummy shaped sleeping bag with a Halloween theme (no special animation needed)
---
I have plenty of God Roll gear, and have participated in quite a bit of trades. My primary gun cost me 50K Caps alone. 
---
The point still remains, that a popularly requested feature is desired. Something pretty simple compared to the other requests people make daily.
---
Also, yes. I like drops. Because I also like to get Scrip for other purposes in the game. Yanno, because people like to utilize the game to its full extent?
---
Take your elitist shit somewhere else.
---
Oh and don't reply. I blocked you. Not worth more than a single reply :)
---
That's just completely wrong in terms of damage.
---
Berserker works as intended, as IT'S ALWAYS BEEN INTENDED TO WORK...you just can't use some weapons with it. You can't go melee or shotty or probably pistol with it because of the low DR. 
---
Long range weapons and gatlings work as intended. 
---
Also, Berserker was fine before One Wasteland, pistols weren't. Berserker is now having it rough after One Wasteland? Pistols are ESPECIALLY fucked. They aren't anywhere near as effective when ti takes me a full 6 magazine to kill something, then i have to do a long reload while i'm getting my ass kicked. 
---
AGree to disagree.
---
Ah. Yes. Trollz.
---
Inb4 they nerf legendary drops in Daily Ops ;(
---
28 with no NW/DOP or grinding.
---
You must’ve lucked out because I tried that and it didn’t work
---
Even quit to desktop with no result
---
That’s what I’m really hoping for as well. BoS paints for each PA just as they have done in the earlier seasons. I would love a BoS paint for my T-65 or Secret Service armor.
---
haha maybe microsoft will do something LOL
---
Darn it! I'll check later when do the dailies reset, thanks for the heads up
---
Really hoping for more energy weapons and heavy weapons along with some kind of extended modding system for PA to make up for lack of legendary effects.
---
I don't know, but I can't wait to find out. Hopefully some amazing heavy weapons as that'd suit the BoS very well.
---
Same goes for some of the 'cursed' weapons you get from Earl.
---
Nah, nuke that CAMP and make them leave or repair.
---
Depends where you live, in the UK dailies seem to reset at 5pm and the Daily ops reset at 6pm.
---
I am SO about this idea. I also hope that some day they make past survival tents available. I wasn't playing FO76 when they added the Settler tent, and I want it so badly. 💔💔💔💔💔
---
At the time PCs came out they thought the hardware was where you made the money. You said Microsoft makes the money off the hardware. There's my argument.
---
Trade ya a suit for the mask??  PS4
---
It wouldn't surprise me if it was screwy like that. I've been able to reproduce quitting to menu work, but there are so many bugs in this game. Surprisingly some people just never get them.
---
I have the diver suit. It weighs 8 pounds and gives only 250 rad resist.
---
I like it, but they should have given us a little more of a break  between the two. Nice idea I agree but its just another thing to grind.
---
I got a 3* suppressor's explosive fixer once and a quad 2525 gamma gun. Think that killed any and all luck I had with the drops for this event since. I've done it probably 30 or more times and still don't have the reclaimed miner helmet. But now that it isn't being traded for legacy weapons I'm not so salty lol
---
I agree, people have gotten SO damn used to the bloodied, junkies, berserker builds explosive twoshots etc etc builds they think that is supposed to be the BARE MINIMUM you need in order do anything in the end game, and it's disgusting. That should be required for raids if they bring them back, world boss events where it hardly matters anyway, or pvp. Daily OPs it doesn't even matter because it's a time based event, not a combat one till the end. 
---
If i can't reliably kill the open world level 50 enemies that ARE NOT RESISTANT TO BALLISTIC within half a 6 round magazine of a revolver, the gun needs a buff to it's base damage.
---
I've had a terrible thought.  It is unlikely, but the possibility of it occurring is non-zero.
---
Microsoft now owns both Fallout and Halo.
---
Mjolnir Power Armor Skins 
---
Covenant Plasma Gun Skins
---
I am both horrified and thrilled by the thought.
---
Nice, I didn't think of that since it comes on a foundation.
---
Nah, it's a complete hugbox here. If you have a problem with the game then yeah, you're bashed to hell.
---
Hopefully a good pistol.
---
Sure, perk bubblegum will go into it. Funny, I'm just refilling my bowl as I post this.
---
I only get 311-6xx for the ops enemies wheres I get 896 per ghoul in rad rumble. I spawn in the bog for a quick queen and the minions she gives 33xx and normally 800+ for the mirelurks.   
---
Was just curious to see how others do it or if there was a quicker gimmick or not. Did find the prime cuts at savage solo and bog solo provide the absolute max xp gains for now but I try not to rely on it to much. 22 levels in 4 hours of play has been nice.
---
6:51 alone. Strangely more with one other person. Never had a full team.
---
I found them thanks guys, it just didn't indicate which ones they were :D
---
Broken Steel brought the Tesla Cannon to Fallout 3, it would be a nice nod to bring it to 76 with Fractured Steel.
---
Heyyyy, thanks for telling me when the rest is :D
---
It gives you an hp buff for a few minutes.I've hit the pipe many times.
---
One of my go-to places to grind before daily ops; now I know it like the back of my hand. Once you go in there a bunch you’ll get used to it, and it’s even easier in the daily op since the uplinks are always in the same locations
---
What about a small table for an all-you-can eat egg salad sandwich station? Spooky egg salad... Where is it from... Who was it for?
---
Yeah it goes at terrain level then you put yours on top, much smaller.
---
Get can do and just hit up trash cans. Canned coffee is the fucking best and an easy run is white springs where the vendors are.
---
Sure you can't... ;)
---
Have you put in a support request?
---
22ish I think?....one or two past the ship in the bottle since that was only one of a couple items I was looking forward to.
---
Thing is tiny.......so very
---
This game isn't really multiplayer. You can't do the same mission, you can't trade items at end game, you can't repair each others gear.
---
A bloodied fixer does as much damage than a heavy gun...not a bloodied heavy gun perhaps, but a normal one. 
---
The base damage needs to be stronger, period. I'd argue they should be doing the same damage , all of them except the 10mm since it fires fast, as a rfifle because a rifle can fire much quicker, and even faster if it's auto. 
---
GUNSLINGER can't do that until they're not gunslinger, they're the Automatic Pistol build. Because revolvers fire so much slower, they should be doing more damage than they are now. 
---
Nobody said a pistol should do as much as a heavy gun, that's silly.
---
I play Destiny 2 as well (and FFXIV... oh God I have no life trying to keep up on all 3) and the seasons thing worked there, so it works well here, too. It gives you something to strive for each day and keeps you logging in, combined with leveling up to get legendary perk ranks, which are kinda like Paragon levels from Diablo 3. It's something the game severely lacked before- once you got your weapon and build, there wasn't much of a reason to keep playing each day. Now there is.
---
That's a waste of camp budget.
---
I would not be surprised if beth decided to have 2 strong and 2 weak seasons per year that interchanged. This season rewards are somewhat weak. Next season, right around christmas... will be a strong one. 
---
This lines up with that reward cadence. 
---
All about hitting those buying and gaming seasons, summer and winter are prime release seasons.
---
HE's bullshitting and I know he is unless he was using a 10mm or plasma thrower, or auto pistol bloodied build.
---
Here's mine https://imgur.com/E1MBaMJ
---
Yeah I was talking about Xbox being the hardware... because they're the ones who make the Xbox and who own exclusive titles for their Xbox game system.
---
In terms of gaming Microsoft makes its money off hardware sells. I wasn't talking about the overall company. 
---
Microsoft's aggressive business tactics are legendary but most of that revolved around their software.
---
Same, though I've nowhere to put it. 1 fusion generator supplies enough power for my camp which I'm currently rebuilding and to be honest I've probably already gone well overboard in terms of the size I actually need so I'll need to strip the decoration back a bit when the time comes.
---
Got the War Glaive yesterday, though I don't melee and as it can't be traded, it serves no purpose for me beyond collector value.
---
Had to check the sub name first...
---
I did the same thing with my jetpack on my SS armor! 2k bullion needed, after turning in my 200 for the day I had 1990.
---
It was so annoying to have to wait another day.
---
I have legitimately never spent money on this game aside from purchasing it on release.
---
It is amazing the more I play the more I see why all the complaining is happening. I can imagine what early adopters of Fallout 76 went through.
---
Why use a developer team so out of touch or so inexperienced in making MMO's, even the most basic quality of life concepts that are decades old, and instead let them continue to do what they do now without at least letting us know they are actively searching for some developers with more talent than just making a pretty Atom store and lots of NON Lore items.
---
I mean, it seems to me so far this developer team and their support are doing things the very cheapest way possible for reasons we do not fully understand.
---
Here is hoping we see some changing of the Bethesda guard including those in charge and those developers and managers holding this game back in both enjoyment and discussion.
---
If you don’t have under armour that’s decent, and you’ve only got 1.1k bullion, I’d highly suggest just getting the SS Under armour and the shielded lining mod for it.
---
Since it gives some extra protection, and boosts SPECIAL stats by more than any other under armour. 
---
The only real advantage SS armour pieces have, is the fact it gets a jet pack mod. 
---
Aside from that you’ll easily be able to find decent to god tier armour drops from legendaries, events, OPS or even other player vendors.
---
Oh god I haven’t seen that in years
---
Pistols are garbage.use non automatic rifles.lever action combat rifle.if you want massive one shot damage then get shotguns.i use my combat shotgun and guass shotgun.i never need another weapon.i do carry a laser gatlin but barley use it.
---
Was that the one in the Fort with two sides fighting each other? Did it once or twice but it seemed really buggy or didn't work, can't really remember it.
---
I just had that thought today lol - "If you max out master infiltrator can you accidentally become wanted by auto-picking a player locked door?"
---
I guess the answer is yes.
---
I’m not sure if it’s new or old but I found you can sell legendary items to vendors. Maybe it’s a big if it’s not old.
---
How I long for the days of MIRV'ing camps
---
I'm right around 40. I really want the greenhouse set and my due date is in two weeks so I'm trying to get it done before then as I doubt I'll have any free time 😬
---
Probably won't happen but I can dream
---
That's what I mean. You get all the mobs on \*one\* objective. I Just did the event like an hour ago, standing in the middle, tagging left, center spawn at the crafting bench and right side. roughly 30-35K XP (lvl 313 to 314.5) with 50% from Lunchboxes + Cranberry relish and around 20 intelligence (so no, not even Unyielding). I was able to tag around 80% of the mobs that spawned across the site with 5 other players participating.
---
XP might be easy to get, I still need around 100 levels to max out the legendary perks, though, so this way i might save some time :D
---
There's level 100 molerats now?!?
---
Check and update your drivers in device manager, be sure to also check that your video card is the default/primary video device, not your CPUs onboard/built-in GPU. Should resolve your issues, unless your HDMI cable is plugged into your mobo, plug it into GPU.
---
I don't agree with silencer mods, i don't get why people think that's going to help. if the base damage as they are now is too low like we've said, sneak damage isn't exactly helping around in order be effective, so why a silencer that naturally lowers damage or range?
---
TSE is 2x less durability than JE
---
Thanks another question for bloodied which legendary perks do you recommend
---
That's disgusting. The owner proudly displaying his love for animal felatio.
---
I hope that you reported them.
---
I think we may see the addition of the original Wattz Energy Weapons. And possibly more classic fallout weapons such as the classic rangemaster, or AK-112 Assault rifle and/or R91.
---
Thank you so much. I finally found it with your help! I love to collect weird items like this.
---
Sounds interesting....
---
Or use stealth. Which at this point, I don't know why anyone would. It's clear they don't want stealth builds to be a thing.
---
I don't understand why Mischief Night is cancelled. 😢 Performance was the only noticable key issue last year. Other than that, it was THE most amazing event in 76, ever(IMO). I hadn't heard it was cancelled until recently. Absolutely awful.
---
Halloween is no joke, I would really like to see something the entire month of October, rather than the short celebration, lack of Atomic Shop we had last year. C'mon Bethesda, you CAN do this!
---
That would a fantastic decoration! Add a Lil' Orphan Annie decoder ring, too!
---
I think so awhile back when it first happened, but I didn't get anything back.
---
I had a sign at my camp that said 'Bush did 9/11'... but everyone that saw it was too young to understand the reference. womp.
---
First rule of the strange pipe...
---
She can join your server through the Xbox dashboard and then she can join your group. I have that issue too. The bf doesn’t show up as my friend even though I show up in his. Look for the friends in games on the dashboard and then you guys can join each other.
---
You said "Microsoft makes money off people buying their consoles for game exclusives lol" that's hardware.
---
I thought TS shotguns suck because they don't double the number of shot pellets, they just added one extra pellet.
---
Depends on your guns. Heard of Angry turtle? (youtuber). If not watch his vids about it. Way more know knowledge.
---
Ah, so you're the guy who's like "I...I run a b-bloodied gunslinger and i do fine!!!" No shit sherlock, you're running bloodied. If you run bloodied anythning you'll be fine. You don't even need weapon perks at that point to be effective. 
---
I said in my post, which you didn't read OBVIOUSLY, that no matter the weapon type, we should NEED TO RUN BLOODIED, TWO SHOT, OR EXPLOSIVE OR BERSERKER IN ORDER OT HAVE THE DAMAGE  to be effective. 
---
And for a lot of weapons you don't have too, except for ballistic pistols. I haven't tried a Laser Pistol since level 20 MONTHS ago onmy second character, but it wasn't that hot either. Gauss I'msure does fine, but that's an end game weapon , what about EVERYTHING ELSE up until that point?
---
Or Cannibal
---
Since they loved their power armours. Some kind of pa mounted weapon would be cool. Like mini rockets on the shoulders ala war machine from Iron man 2. Lol
---
I’d be fine with some weapons getting buffed or just better mods for them, take the laser rifle/pistol for example.
---
Edit: The heavy Incinerator would be nice actually.
---
Right? That kind of Gatling was in 45cal if I remember right. The fact that they call it 5mm bothered me for a long time. Considering that a cartridge itself contains the energy.. it makes little sense to me that it would either do a tiny punch from minigun... Or huge booming slow shot from the Gatling.
---
Dude, they’re being bought out. What do you expect?
---
I don't think I've ever played any FO game using just melee before, so my melee is terrible lol. I guess I gotta start practicing!
---
I do use healing salves instead of stimpaks whenever I remember tho, I'm just so used to using stimpaks and food/drinks LOL
---
I did my first one a few days ago... we had no issues dropping him well below the time limit. Probably had 7 or 8 minutes left on the clock.
---
Much like the SBQ, you really just need a group of people with decent builds to do it.
---
Thx buddy
---
I appreciate your input, but it does little to contribute to the discussion. We know pistols are garbage, we're taling about how they need a buff more than Bloodied or Berserker's needs a look.
---
Ah I am PC, sorry my dude.
---
I tried this, sent to bug report &gt; atom store. Heard nothing. Is there another section for refunds I should be navigating to?
---
1st has been worth it for me. 
---
The scrap storage, extra skins and monthly atoms do make up for the cost.
---
As others have stated as well, you can kind of exploit the scrap box by un-subbing when you feel you have enough materials inside.
---
Another note as well, there’s a couple of bugged quests which myself and many others couldn’t actually complete/trigger checkpoints in without 1st (Yes, I’m saying that under the correct circumstances, without 1st you literally can’t complete some storylines, being that they’d only allow you to trigger objectives within your own 1st private world).
---
We had tried that initially, but I still couldn't add her to the group. Best we could do is just play together but 'separately'.
---
But you also can't do that with Fallout 1st since it's a private server.
---
If you haven't tryed. Try blocking her account and then unblock, and her account doing the same to you. Also hard reset both the systems.
---
Try having both of you add each other as friends.
---
