No it doesn't. You can sometimes cheese chameleon into working while standing but that dosnt last. Idk why people want sentinels. If they spent anytime in survival they would know these things.
---
---
---
No, it expands to include specific locations in the Forest.  So you can't just take 20 photos in the same spot and achieve the challenge, you need to go to each location and snap a photo.  I did the 20 photos in the same spot initially but then went back and discovered there are a whole bunch of specific locations so you can't just do it in the same spot.
---
Awesome well done!!
---
Cavs is way better. You will never.. I mean never be standing while not crouched in this game.
---

---
Sentinel has a place tho... Melee attackers standing in front of a queen. Then its op.
---
That's been my experience with it. Switched to a crit build instead
---
Truuuuuu
---
Awesome thanks so much this rules I appreciate it
---
They already have canned coffee in the game. Canned coffee and boiled water (have to make it hard for ya 🤣) equals 2 hot coffee and each one gives 2 strength for an hour or something along those lines. Have two coffee machine choices like the hot stove and coffee pot and the actual coffee machine (reusing existing skins in game to reduce the time needed to code). I would prefer the small hot stove and coffee pot cause I've only got a small camp and don't have the room for a big coffee machine.
---
No way! This is one of my favorite things to do in prowls camps. Lights on and doors closed. Not anymore!
---
You have no reason to trust me, but I’m on Xbox if you ever need a mule!!
---
I would guess it'll come out closer to the 14th  (the date the game launched on), but I would also guess it'll actually come in November. I know it's fun to joke about delays, but they're clearly focused on it seeing as features like the legendary player system got pushed back, and they've had a longer than usual gap in the patch cycle. Plus, Bethesda has a winter holiday iirc, so it also makes more sense they'd want to get it out before then so they're not stuck addressing issues over the winter.
---
Tomahawk is a very rare plan for one.
---
Yeah, that's not gonna happen. It would be Atom Shop content.
---
Wait i need specific locals? Which? I stayed in own place for the others.
---
I was mostly referencing the pricing on getting a chest opened earlier. That if they're okay with that price gouging, they wouldn't hesitate to do the same elsewhere. I suppose I could have been clearer on that. I do understand how mobile games work. Spent my share of money on free to download games.
---
The thing is that if they really need money, they need to go about it in a far better way than they are. Now they've lost regularly paying customers like myself, who will continue playing the game, but will no longer spend another dime until they stop making me feel like I'm a walking wallet in their eyes and nothing more. 
---
I had intended to always buy their ten dollar bundle, whether I liked the outfit that came with it or not, or whether there was anything in the atom shop I was interested in spending atoms on at the time or not, and then I would also buy the other packs when something shows up in the Atom Shop that I really want but am just short of by a few atoms. 
---
They wouldn't have got millions out of me this way, of course, but they would have gotten a decent chunk of change from me. 
---
After today, however, they're getting nothing.
---
They're scared to lose five people that pay five hundred a month, while completely ignoring the five thousand people that would pay twenty or more a month if they didn't feel like this game is becoming more and more of an elaborate joke on all of us and/or a straight up money grab.
---
Heck, I was going to drop a fiver on Bethesda this morning when I saw that the power armor station skin is on sale. Then I saw the Pharma fridge/glorified reskin of the original fridge (that's also still 700 atoms) and my wallet suddenly vanished.
---
Yeah, it's different for the Forest.
---
You need 1 photo for each location (e.g., Camp Adams, Wade Airport, Lakeside Cabins, etc).
---
I do not like rain in this game, however rad storm are dope and I want to see them more often
---
Oh so it doesn't actually matter as long as they're different spots?
---
Let's look at it this way: would you congratulate someone in college for utterly smashing the penmanship on their final paper? Never mind it doesn't have sources, the grammar is terrible in places and it's obvious they triple spaced to make it look bigger?
---
Exactly what I was saying. I have to scrap part of my house to add one magazine to the rack. Then the magazine also takes up space in my stash. Whaaaat?!
---
Yay, more raider stuff.
---
Thats what everyone told me about survival mode. Why does it not apply here? Half full lobbies after 5-10 min waits. Game mode is dead use those resources towards main game.
---
EP is cool but I sure enjoy my jet pack.
---
Isn't nuclear winter enough for you?!
---
Republic of dave for sure
---
Random rolls here we go!
---
Dude I grinded asF first time round for it. No go... Primal Cuts event, low level drops it randomly for me. Thank goodness no one bought my expensive peppered mod plan since lol.
---
This is a brilliant idea! 🤩🤩🤩
---
With this I'm a bit of a lurker but well should I get the game and do a playthrough before the update. Also will the game run like two types of servers. A pre wastlanders and after it.
---
There was snow in one of the e3 trailers. Don't know why they decided to remove that area
---
Lol I love it nice build.
---
no the flame station is vaulting :( i havent gotten it yet
---
Thank you so much!
---
Works fine for me.
---
As a Californian, I would very much appreciate snow in the game.
---
Star Wars Galaxies had a really good one, and Farcry 5's fishing is great.
---
Seasonal nuclear storms wouldn't be hard to implement after all for a horizon 4 can pull off 4 seasons. Fallout universe really only needs 2 seasons nuclear winter (high rads and poor visibility) and nuclear summer where its the current weather in the game which still has rain storms etc.
---
 this thread is seriously deflating
---
Because Bethesda didn't create anything.  Fallout and the world of Fallour was created by Black Isle Studios a subsidiary of Interplay Entertainment. When Black Isle was dissolved, many of their key employees went on to find Obsidian Entertainment (sound familiar?) When Interplay ran into financial difficulties. They sold the rights to Fallout to Bethesda. Bethesda made Fallout 3, and then Fallout New Vegas was developed by Obsidian and is considered the best game of the series by many. Bethesda has tried to ham fistedly but the franchise for money by monetizing it with microtransactions and trying to strip away mod support in order to force players to buy mods through their store. Bethesda had very little to do with creating the world of Fallout.
---
Those randoms are the people that become your friends. You get a few people on your server that's cool and all but what about when they quit? Then you're on a super dead server and I mean I spent like 500 hours building my character. I'm not going to want to just start over every time player servers die out. 
---
I'm not against player servers at all. Just saying personally, doesn't seem interesting. Also the way people I know mod their games is lame too. I don't want to be at the mercy of a server owner who thinks every enemy having a anime or Todd head is cool.
---
Surprised how little info we have on it.
---
Up here in the PNW we’re already getting snow, so it’s not too early ;_;
---
Been really hoping for the smoke machine, that's not in an over priced bundle.
---
The only drawback of that point is, of course, that mods can't be used in Nuclear Winter.
---
I'm guesing the faces in that big tower that have the fall immunity legs in the top.
---
A faction of raiders from fo4
---
He is talking about the world though and the fact that it is persistent unlike many other openworld games where it is easy to cut around corners to make the game run more smoothly. Something not always possible with a world filled with multiple players
---
let a responder dream leaky
---
Nobody should be spending $20 a month on this game. Or any fucking game.
---
World of Warcraft has 100x the content this game has with each update adding 10x more than updates for this game add. And that's still only $10 a month.
---
Idk but I really want that outfit advertised in the 3rd image. I swear it's not in the game
---
This is too real lol
---
Yes I agree.  The game is the backdrop. It’s the people that make the game.
---
As a Canadian, I respectfully disagree.
---
As a Nevadan, what is snow?
---
Yes. That is not the setting....that is the persistent online servers. Like I had just said.   
---
You okay?
---
I honestly doubt it's going to be a super massive update. I hope to be proved wrong but I'm not expecting much. If you're interested in the game just grab it on sale because I think it's going to be incremental updates for a while
---
Bummer. It's not "rare" but can be hard to find when you need it. Pretty essential plan for any typical house build.
---
Right but we’re not talking about mods, we’re talking about how beautiful Appalachia is and what a well designed worldspace it is and giving Bethesda credit where it’s due for it.
---
What about the face in lucky hole mine / faces around the icky vine birth creature in the hidden room...are they all connected?   Maybe it’s vestiges of Skyrim...dwarves.  Same planet but way in the future.
---
It depends. If you have the right it’s a cakewalk. I personally have cleared the quarry with a gauss rifle and and the compliance regulator, however I have also done it with other stuff. It’s easy on long sight lines or if you have equipment that causes fatigue. Bean bags are great for this, though I prefer the compliance regulator. Explosives and melee I don’t have experience enough to speak for though.
---
I ment like I heard it takes place a year after the main game so would new players not be on servers with wastlanders on it
---
Survival mode is gone. The people who played that as top dogs need their fix of killing and looting
---
🤣 Lydia
---
When we first got word of Nuclear Winter I was hoping it'd be snow in summer just to throw a curve ball.  But as we know, that did not happen.. Hopefully for winter though!
---
Don't have nor will ever own a console outside of a Switch. Anything that can be done on PS4 Xbox can be done better on my personally built computer and with higher graphics and less whiny children. The exclusives on either console are horrible these days and no where worth the money or time.
---
They'd (the YouTubers) would probably pick it apart, anyway; For example, look how The Angry Joe show covered the Nuka-Cola moldy helmet story- They showed the NON-moldy Power Armor edition helmet in the thumb-nail, then used the NON-moldy helmet in the first part of their coverage, only barely mentioning later on it WASN'T the Power Armor edition helmet that had issues with mold.

Standing up at my workshop is the death sentence :p I don't pvp cuz I suck at it.
---
it's blatant how out of touch and desperate for big-gains the atom shop directors are - despite the seemingly-blatant-oversights, poor qa, re-rolled bundles and continuously hostile pricing on content that maybe-shoulda-been available in-part in-game.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm a huge fan but Wastelanders better be worth it because this interim period sucks.
---
But would that count for the kill enemies that have become scorched weekly challenge, though?
---
For real though, I am addicted to the game like the rest of us, but let’s be realistic, we have random texture glitches without trying to add more textures.
---
Cleaver has bonus effect of hackin' and whackin' and smackin'
---
Apparently you can get downvoted for politely having a different opinion. Go figure.
---
Yeah, I have a gaming rig as well. Doesn't change the fact.
---
*shrug* Guess you'll just have to keep complaining about it until BGS does something. 
---
I'll just keep playing.
---
Thanks for the replies, guys and girls. That explains a lot. Muchly appreciated.
---
I'll continue to play and enjoy it, just a bit tougher all around it seems. Oh well, still a great community for the most part. I've had more good experiences than bad, though the bad experiences are becoming more frequent, as I mentioned.
---
It would be cool. If there are flame weapons then they have a chance to blow out in high wind situations and the player has to fix them. Same with fire pits and stuff.
---
I made the mistake when farming ticks to leave the tick blood sack and just take the blood. I didn't realise that the blood sack scraps to antiseptic!
---
[removed]
---
Ah! Interesting perspective! I go boutique and still do quite well. 
---
I sell a very select  choice of weapons, priced around 699c for bloodied/instigating/junkies 1 star decent weapons, to 2500 for good two star rolls and 5k for great 3 stars.
---
Amazing rolls can be priced to 7500~ish
---
I also have sold some god rolls that I’ll never use due to build for about ~15-20k, they’re my showpiece items :)
---
Everything else I scrip and save for next days scrip!
---
Lol. I'll have to check that out when I'm on.
---
God of war, last of us, uncharted, red dead redemption 2 (at least currently)... fucking unplayable games on console.
---
I share your pessimism tho :( but we can't tempt the monkey's paw
---
It's in an Overseer's chest at Morgantown airport. Maxes out at 30# at Level 50.
---
Ha! Just moved out of the pnw this summer, but not before the freak winter storm that dumped 4.5 feet of snow in the last 2 weeks of winter. Friends are sending me pictures of the first snow hitting already. So weird.
---
That was in an update a long time ago. Most of us didn't notice because we cleared it and never looked back.
---
My guess is that they’re trying to find a way to stop the cheating without banning anyone. Every time there’s a ban wave, bad press follows, no matter how well deserved those bans may be. They can’t afford anymore bad press, especially with Wastelanders coming. 
---
When they banned dupers there was no shortage of “I got banned for no reason” posts here and on Bethnet. We all know that 99% of those people were lying, but that didn’t stop dozens of writers and Youtubers from making “Content” that used those posts to dump on the game and drive clicks. I have no doubt that the same thing would happen if they banned these clowns as well.
---
Also referring to the almost complete lack of nuka cola atom shop skins. Wasn't going to buy a fridge but that one I would.
---
The tunnel in the south of the map
---
The monetization strategy and long gaps in between both fixes and new content leave people feeling salty - despite the awesome potential.
---
What? I'm \[PC\] but have five recipes and make lots of serums. Made some yesterday. That's sounds weird. Does it use up the materials? You've checked the AID tab to find the serums?
---
Had a scorched molerat spawn at Fissure site when we were doing the pic challenge but only at one of the 5 sites we travelled to.
---
Thank you.
---
It's not just at the SBQ that it didn't count. I killed scorched ticks at Mosstown, near Hopewell Cave and at Dolly Sods where I also killed a scorched Yao guai. None of them counted stuck at 2/3.
---
These kind of scorched are meant to count towards the 8mil community challenge as well so hopefully it's only this atom challenge that is bugged not the whole thing!
---
Ugh, I've wasted so much time at that car... Well, I guess being realistic, it's only a few hours, but still. Thanks!
---
"If gta can do it... its surely possible" how so? Gta is one of the most successful video games in existence. They generated way more revenue than Bethesda and probably still do. With that they can do whatever they want. Bethesda is pretty limited compared to them.
---
I honestly want a new different snow region to explore.
---
Those are actually decent 2nd and 3rd stars, considering that it’s a stealth weapon. If you’re on Xbox pm me, I’d be interested in the quad.
---
I would love the savage divide to be snowy, but keep the rest as the same. I just really love the idea of it snowing the higher elevated you get, and looking up on the mountains to see it snowing
---
But I also love the greenery of the forest and redness of the cranberry bog. But wouldn't it also be too hot in the toxic valley and ash heap for snow?
---
Y'all are wheelie pissing me kff
---
I really thought this said snow in Alpaca..multiple times. And hey, sure alpacas in West Virginia, let's do it.
---
Did they take survival off?
---
Awesome  Idea, I would also like to see snow in the game as well, and  it may be  slightly early, mind you, Canada just  got hit with  tons of snow  less than 700km away  from  West Virginia over this past weekend.  But then again Canadians also  live  in igloos right. Lol. 
---
In addition, what would happen to the animals in game, would they hibernate,  and some would be in aestivation jurring the summer months. And we would have new animals that are introduced to the game, like the mountain lion, and cougar.  And what changes would be made to players survival in game. I guess it would make things more survival themed. I think it would make a great DLC addition to the game after the wastelanders release in a  month or so. 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best.
---
No
---
Wait. You play fallout 76 but shit on those other titles? That’s laughable. And that’s coming from someone who loves 76.
---
You mean you haven’t gotten the message that your CAMP can’t be placed?
---
Sentinel by a long shot
---
These weapons are extremely valuable to the right people. 
---
That quad could go for a lot, and the Medics would depend on its other stars.
---
Technically if they add enough snow, it should be less texture
---
I concede on that matter, but we are talking about Bethesda here, they will find a way to mess it up. Furthermore, while scrolling through the comments a couple hours after the original comment I made I keep seeing repeatedly, not shitty snow meaning they are looking for a high detail snow in which case texture issues remain.
---
Really....
---
This is why I don't wear power armor.
---
Even if they had some less system intensive storms, like an ash cloud that forces players to either run indoors or wear a gas mask, or a heat wave that decreases everyone's energy resistance (npc's included). It could really ramp up the immersion, forcing players to react to the new conditions and potentially use them to their advantage.
---
The truth is, it called the Day Tripper, mixed with Buffout. I see snow flakes every time. Lol.
---
 Just kidding, interesting I will have to check that out my self. 
---
I wish you the best.
---
This goes much quicker if you equip Butchers Bounty under Perception, you can then search the ticks and get extra loot - very useful for farming tick blood for stimpacks.
---
There is also a guaranteed 4-5 tick spawn in cabin in the Mire by Harpers Ferry that shows up if you start the Insect parts daily quest.
---
You know yes or no woulda been less letters to type of your so perturbed by my question
---
If you’re a heavy gunner, then the sentinel makes a lot of sense. If not, you’ll likely not be standing up and standing still all that much, so the effect won’t really do anything for you.
---
It was a joke! But fallout has always been good at environmental story telling.
---
Maybe we could re-open that ski resort?
---
Ah, gottcha- I didn't realize that. Thanks so much for help!! 👍👍
---
There is a courrier service on the other subreddit for 76
---
It those dam pork and beans, I tell you. Lol.
---
I am indeed a heavy gunner, thanks everyone for your answers I also sided with sentinel but I wanted confirmation lol
---
Yes, I’ve seen posts from the miners. I was just trying to joke with the other commenter. Thank you for the link.
---
Yes.
---
Yep its harder to get into as more bearded up and thr vendor bot is dead:(
---
reminded me of the Sacred head of the Vault Dweller from fallout 2, but maybe it has something to do with the next generation episode I havent seen in 20 years
---
I mean its a gorgeous world and a fun gane but a bad game thd launch state crippled this thing from the start and ongoing bugs are really rough.
---
I think it was buyers rather than sellers.  They thought that the seller should manage their money better.  Their concern was that players would fast travel to a camp only to find a large percentage of items unavailable for sale.  That’s why I suggested that greyed out items shouldn’t appear on the map pop up.
---
This may be my issue, I really don't want to deal with it lol
---
Normally they release updates on Tuesdays so it's likely it could release on the 12th or 19th.
---
thats coming later on
---
Check out the event "The Battle That Never Was", its like this
---
You haven't even lived until the queen kills you, you re-spawn inside the nuked zone, the rads kill you and then the game forces you to re-spawn at vault 76.
---
Nah I want more tire stacks! Keep those tire stacks coming! In all seriousness there is an utter lack of reasonable game related content. A lot of the stuff is just random bs. Looking at you crap wallpapers.
---
There was a time when Raiders were badasses. Passive mode is winning.
---
Just saying the word "respectively" doesn't really grant you complete immunity from the not so positive side of people. I've actually already learned that the hard way.
---
Just crafted a few on PC to test this. Worked fine with multiple different serums.
---
As a person who lives in a part of mexico where is mostly hot all the year, yes please, I would apreciate that.
---
Alternatively, go to Tanagra Town. There is almost always a Megasloth there. Tag it and fast travel to Cranberry Bog. Have another Player kill the Megasloth and you get credit.
---

Yea welcome to spell check and auto correct😂 lmao
---
Today's only the first day with it gone and I already had the second floor of my house broken into for the first time ever. Where I and my family sleeps. So, y'know, enjoy the beds, even though I also have some downstairs for visitors.
---
It's very likely a game design choice. 
---
Of course that some changes had to be made to the map by compressing all the spaces to make it flow better in terms of travel but you'll also notice if you compare the map to real world maps that even locations of towns are different.
---
For instance, Morgantown is WAY further north IRL than it's depicted in the game. Places like Grafton and Clarksburg are actually south of Morgantown, not north of it as depicted in the game.
---
Energy weapons are shit vats weapons. There is no automatic receiver, only a barrel. The barrel doesn't seem to reduce Vats costs. You won't get nearly as many shots in.
---
Its supposed to release in November
---
It’s supposed to be out in November
---
Tiny “hands” 😉
---
My opinion is that people get sucked into “its gotta be heavy”. The extra DR/ER isn’t that big of a leap. Keep the 3* and sell the 2*. Probably for more than the 3 would sell because of the heavy preference.
---
Crit capacitor... Along with some of the lowest ap costs in the game? Are you fucking high?
---
I got one on my lvl 25 alt but not my lvl 159 main.
---
It is next season (third season/DLC) coming in November most likely.
---
I agree with you one hundred percent. Like it's all just random stuff. At least give us themed items
---
thats how it is made to, it is a trap. it does not stop until it decides too, or it breaks
---
Maybe but maybe also respawns as well and set a 15 each team with one player as the general which is the team member with the most kills
---
Which ones?
---
Employee turn over in the scrap collection industry is high. Understandable given the nature of the nature of the work.
---
I did get him I just forgot to list it.  I was taking a rest from bemch press when i posted that i was on a time limit lol but ty.
---
Yeah it’s just I’ve seen people have it hooked up so I goes off one time then that’s it and mine did that then after a while it started glitching to where it would keep doing bursts
---
Okay same what level are you
---
You need to list all the modifiers to the guns for us to give you the real value.

Sheepsquatch vs. glowing deathclaw

Deathclaw v. Mirelurk Queen
---
I live in Morgantown. It was 92 degrees today. Please give me winter. 😩
---
I honest to god saw a pack of deathclaws somehow kill a SB
---
!remind me 1 month
---
You lose out on 50% AP reduction from not having a receiver. Unless you are saying the critical capacitor has the 50% reduction. You can reduce AP costs to one on something like a Handmade with the -25% legendary effect.
---
Did the SB land?
---
Watoga  vendorbot should sell the plan too.   I think it’s around 1,800 caps.
---
!remindme 1month

Sheepsquath won!

Radium rifle is ballistic anyway
---
I assume the Queen won?
---
I saw them fighting each other
---
It's a long shot but is it pointing at the plate? Maybe the flames are registering as weight for the plate. Try pointing it a different direction to see if it matters. 🤷‍♂️
---
Can somebody tell me where to get the jey that opens the other containers?
---
Off and on, but i would have thought it would have just kept in the air, and killed the DCs
---
I agree as well, especially since everyone has some sort of anti armor perk so it won’t even be 13, and if they have a aae it’s even less. With the sentinel that’s a flat deduction
---
And that's why I haven't touched rdr2 in so long every once in awhile. I'll try it a couple time keep getting kicked, trying joining my brothers server he's in and get kicked. So just said hell with it for a couple months. Hopefully it gets better soon..before everybody stops playing lol
---
Nope. I did.
---
It's all about them crits. Also the handmade is tied for worst AP usage in the rifle department. You should search on here or google. Someone mad a sweet spread sheet.
---
Just played FO4 with realistic storms mod again and boy was it different from Fo76. You could see 10-20 meters and with lightning flashes get glimpses of moving just out of visual range. I loved it.
---
Anyone know if there is a chance from treasure maps? I’ve gotten T series PA plans from them before.
---
Yes
---
Appalachia*
---
Thanks I’ve tried that but it’s not working still it’s like the pressure plate was just glitching the second it got connected to it
---
Yep. You will lose those caps. 
---
Transfer to them to another character or go and buy something.
---
Go to a low levels camp buy all there stuff and scrap it to unlock the mods that way you can lose Caps I try to never go over 25k
---
The buyer pays, but the only thing you get is more stash space.
---
Something so simple yet so game changing! This would be great
---
The one in the top left of the map in the Forrest?
---
Well shit the bed somebody got lucky today and got 15 stable violet flux for free. Got it closed off and powered down now.
---
When did they cause fear in fallout 4?
---
I think OP is referring to the games where they could actually hurt the player.
---
They pay for the stuff but you won't get the caps.
---
I suggest going to buy plans or something even if you don't use them.
---
IMO, Survival was pretty average for PvP as it's been dead for a while now. It took too long actually finding someone and when you did you had to shoot them 100 times to kill them. 
---
PvP in Adventure sucks as it's all about workshops which people now avoid. 
---
Nuclear Winter load times are too long.
---
I'm hoping that with Wastelanders they bring out a new PvP mode/area or something.
---
Yep. Deathclaws don't have acid resist.
---
Tenderizer mods are a very common drop, while plans for the tenderizer are not. I think it's high but if you can get 750 good for you.
---
3 star hermit crab vs. 1 star sheepsquatch. I tagged them both from sneak and watched it play out. The squatch emerged victorious but battered, he was quickly put down.
---
I closed it off and dropped power. Thanks
---
It's always funny to me that people call Rockstar masters of world-crafting, but their worlds are always skin-deep and don't really have anything interesting to find, or explore.  That goes for their modern open-world titles too.  They make very impressive recreations of real-life locations, but that's about all they can brag, since there isn't a whole lot between those.
---
Meanwhile, Bethesda's world-crafting isn't so much interested in building exact, or close replicas of reality, there are some creative reproductions. But what stands out about Bethesda's world crafting is that it's all kind of meticulously planned out for the players to interact with all the bits and pieces inside it, from nearly corner to corner.  There's sights and sounds to find, and the exploration for that untouched corner is always there, and you can almost be sure someone at Bethesda probably left a little something for the thorough explorers.  Some people critique this style and refer to it as a theme park or something, but I find a world is a lot more enjoyable when I know the developers have planned out a lot of the space in such a way there is something to find, and it's not just empty, dead space.  Which was one of my common complaints about New Vegas.

30-50K I’d estimate, but it’s typically a “trade only” item.
---
Quite a bit I presume. I’m looking for one if you’re on pc.
---
??
---
He still spent caps, he didn’t get anything for free.
---
It’s high for now. After the event is over people will pay more. I’d hold onto any Meat Week plans/items til then.
---
I recommend moving caps to another character.  Have a friend help you, or start a “mule” account.
---
I think that people are just bored. After the Queen storyline is done, there's not much else to do. Personally, it took me a couple of weeks of aimlessness to finally realize, "wtf...I'm sure I could be doing something else!"
---
Now it's better... I wander around a bit on weekends and play fo4 thru the week when I have time.
---
Things will pick up for a bit with the new material coming in next few months
---
as an Illinoisan, trust us, you really don't wanna know.
---
Right but I would have rather lost the legendary’s then the flux, it’s a grind to get that much but we live and learn.
---
Have three ... on my STR 3 pistol vats character.
---
All in the vendor.
---
I just saw one in somebody's vendor for 5K and then in another vendor for 500, on the same server. Still got meat week for another couple days so I imagine after its done they might be worth 1k - 2k.  I already know the three mods so I'll probably end up throwing mine in the vendor for 1K.
---
Yeah, I wish I’d find more flux on vendors.
---
I’m going to start a mule tomorrow.
---
Right on. 👍
---
Coming down from a mountain the Savage Divide I looked down and saw Scorched and Super Mutants all rushing to battle. Must’ve been a dozen of each, at least, all running in opposing packs. 
---
I wish it was a more common sight. It really drove the point home that the world just doesn’t belong to humans anymore.
---
Me and my buddy just tried but cant find the codes
---
Place a cooking pot on a floor mat with the handle pointing outward and move the mat close to the wall. When you activate the pot and exit it, it should clip you through the wall if done correctly. Just be careful you don't fall into oblivion, suggest storing junk first.
---
Have you tried buying plans to get rid of caps.
---
Sell stuff as a player vendor to get rid of stuff in stash.
---
Than buy stuff from.legendary vendor to get rid of scrip.
---
The game warns you when you are about to go over max scrip.limit.
---
stay in the east and do side quests for a while..
---
you should do forest primal cuts whenever it procs too
---
when you get your build a little further along and have better gear it will be way easier
---
Honestly? At risk of being ripped to pieces, I think that might be a good idea, if there are any issues at all. Better than just pushing it out when they could make it a better and more stable experience by waiting another month or two. Hell, there are things I would like to accomplish before it lands, and I'm not sure the occasional day I can manage to per week will be enough with only a month left, lol.
---
You can wear power armor @ lvl 15 what system?
---
I sell more of it the anything else. All 200 but violet and I sell it for 250, all day. I thought I was high but was told to go higher due to nobody selling it. So I always grind WS for the other 3 components and the hit the nukes for raw.
---
Sounds like your weapon is bugged. Find or craft a different one.
---
nuclear winter is over
---
Maybe I just haven’t ran into any power armor I can’t actually wear yet lol my b! That explains that.
---
what do u mean?
---
At level 19 you're still not ready to explore the eastern half of the map, or parts of the savage divide. If you stick to the Ash Heap and Toxic Valley for a few more levels you should find them more manageable. Levels 20-40 are semi-infamous for being the hump of the game, so you're not doing anything wrong.
---
I accidentally got involved in a Primal Cuts with some level 90+ guys and got demolished lol. I give it another go though!
---
And what system you play on? If on Xbox I can give you a lvl 15raider power armor
---
Behemoth VD Scorchbeast, while I watched from up high on the monorail. Was amazing to watch, and the behemoth wrecked the scorchbeast and barely took damage.
---
I’m pretty sure you can get Raider PA at L15, maybe it’s 20. 
---
You should be able to do events in the Forrest which are good XP and some offer Legendary items for scrip. The Legendary Vendor is leveled so if you can save up 100 scrip you can get a 4* weapon that fits your current level. But tbh I’d advise going with 2* until you’re a higher level. 
---
Otherwise the Feed the People event is easy at low levels and offers a good item that boosts XP.
---
If I'm bored I'll sometimes run around the map collecting power armor frames (scrapping or dumping the armor) and drop the frames off at Overseer's camp or Flatwoods for newbies.
---
I’ll keep that in mind! I’m currently doing the mission Defiance has Fallen! So far these missions have taken me all over the map and sometimes into places I’ve gotten absolutely shat on 😂
---
Once you get to level 40+, the game opens up a lot.  So grind/level and learn the mechanics of the game, and then get ready for when you hit level 40+.  Don’t worry about gear much, until you are level 50.
---
I think my favorite was a Sheepsquach vs a Scorchbeast and a Glowing Deathclaw came running out of nowhere and joined in as well.
---
Doors that lead out generally say “Appalachia” am I right?
---
Hold on to all MW plans, clothes, items until after the event is over. Then they are worth something.
---
I haven’t done any of those events but I’ll keep that in mind for tomorrow!! Is it better to focus on events or quest? Or do both at the same time?
---
Me and a buddy were thinking about dropping anuke tonight, around 11-12ish, I'll ask and let you know fellow scavver
---
Man sounds epic
---
I play on PC! Thank you for the kind off though :D
---
As a Texan I agree
---
😂seems fair man
---
I assume the scorchbeast landed then
---
Very valiant of you to put it out of its misery 😂👏
---
This is why this community is the best. Love you guys
---
Fair enough 😂
---
Imo until you can bring some damage with you, I’d grind events to level up and fill out your build. 
---
This site is great for planning ahead and seeing when desired perks become available. 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/
---
It’ll be difficult to make no mistakes on your way to L50 but the better you plan the less time it’ll take to re-spec to what you want.
---
😂Hell yea brother
---
Yea would’ve been smart
---
Patrolling the Appalachia almost makes you wish for a session of Nuclear Winter.
---
I just started a second character, but going a different route with melee. Now I’ll start getting the kick ass rifles!
---
So far the prices of both fridges are the same aren't they?  If can't afford it, won't get it.  I can do without, and I'm not giving them another dime of my money until they change their methods.
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The\_Motherlode](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Motherlode)
---
Red is hot right now on the Market. Brown is easy to find, 1-2k, Green is harder so 3-5k, Red is get a lot more than that, around 15-20k I think.
---
The map and world design is absolutely amazing. Especially all the details and stories they put into hundreds of locations. I’ve played many Open world game in latest years, none of them, none of them can compete with FO76 when it comes to  the contents of exploration and details of the map.
---
sometimes pressure plates get "stuck" IMO the flamer traps are not worth the hassle without a master power down switch
---
Much appreciated.
---
Yo it’s way early. I live in Appalachia and it’s been 90 for weeks.
---
Ok thanks I’ll probably remove it and wait until after meat week
---
Ok I’ll do that thanks
---
They’re up now
---
Ah okay and the flamer traps are the only trap that work for this purpose
---
I was there yesterday! Nice place!
---
They ruined survival because even a full server would be 24 people and 10 of them are just low level turds in Flatwoods that just want to grind with bonus exp and don't want any pvp at all. The other 14 players are trying to pvp but keep running into low level idiots that scream on the mic about being left alone if you shoot at them or take their workshop. The 20% exp bonus ruined survival by attracting people with no pvp interest.
---
 I've gotten 5. If you're on ps4, ill give you one
---
Its ashes from the toxic valley
---
Thank you very much!!  I appreciate it!
---
You know that reminds me of back when I used to patrol the Mojave...
---
because NW is dying and they need to consolidate pvp so the queue times aren't outrageous. Too bad NW is also trash
---
Check YouTube for PA farm locations because even the base chassis is nice
---
And under intelligence there’s a perk to lower energy ammo (fusion cores are counted) as they weigh 6 pounds each
---
As a Florida man, I've only heard tales of snow.
---
I understand that, but i wish they had at least chosen roads that were actually in wv lol
---
Mirelurk Queen v. 3 Scorcbeasts
---
And we've all heard tales of your mythical deeds, oh marvelous Florida Man
---
yeah i’m noticing that now. :(
---
Who won?
---
So typical RNG. Didn’t get it the first time MW played out or at anytime on the second appearance. Until today. Did the event twice, got a Tenderizer each time. They are heavy.
---
Yeah we were 15 minutes to early
---
Figure out a good pistol build. There has to be a good concept. I’m thinking about doing one. Just don’t know if I’ll find the point shift worth it.
---
Oh cool!! Thank you!
---
Craziest was a Flatwoods monster controlling everything on Whitespring. Like five people in power armor shooting against a scorchbeast, charged ghouls, a deathclaw... It was insane. I was like level 28, shooting 10mm from a SMG. Noisy as hell.
---
This deserves way way way more upvotes
---
The mask they made, then next week or so the same mask but with a helmet. I just learned to not buy anything until it's on sale or been in shop a long time.
---
2/3 Scorchbeasts
---
Atleast he got one
---
Damn man sounds amazing
---
You are embarrassing yourself by saying fallout 76 is more appealing than the Xbox exclusives listed. Fallout 76 on pc is a godawful Xbox port and high framerates are completely meaningless on a game with high latency servers and slow tic server cycles. Running fallout 76 above 60fps is completely meaningless to the gameplay.
---
Where Is the cardboard box?
---
There are different vendors in the Enclave. For these plans you want Production. 
---
Buy the first plan available and learn it. Leave the server, join a new one. Return to the Production vendor and it will have the second plan for you. Buy it, learn it, leave the server. Repeat until you’ve learned Shielded. 
---
Or skip all that nonsense and buy the Shielded plan from a player. I think I have a couple copies I’ve found in PVMs on Xbox.
---
I have an exec Powerfist and deathclaw gaunt
---
Both exec
---
Interesting tool, I saved it to experiment with tomorrow. I’m worried I already fucked up lol
---
What platform u on dude
---
With the increases rad resistance to 650 does this mean that you can stay alive in nuke zones without power armor?
---
Thanks man!
---
Probably but as you’re approaching L50 it’s impossible to do it perfectly the first time. You’ll find a new weapon and decide to switch directions with perks, etc. at least no you can change after L50. Wasn’t always like that...
---
Now time for the survivors to "Purge!"
---
Whoo boy. You don't want to be in the bog!
---
Well done.  I'm struggling to reach level 100.  Really liked that you took the time to capture the pics.
---
Creekside sundew grove works too. If you can kill the enemies attacking the sloth so it turns visible then.
---
Maybe you are the ignorant one for thinking NW has much appeal. I've been playing 76 since launch with a very large discord server and absolutely nobody plays NW and the only time I hear about it is the hackers. Haven't you seen the advertisements all over YouTube for the NW hacker tools? It's disgusting how easy it is for people to cheat and it's so common that every match is guaranteed to have a cheater as the winner. Why bother with NW? Other games do battle Royale better.
---
Damn 92? Glad it didn’t get that hot here though it felt like it
---
Uffda! These hotheaded murderous jag-offs really need to step it up! Giving up just isn’t the raider way, eh?
---
Recommendation?
---
I killed it today by accident. I joined a Scorched Earth and when the battle was over, I spotted it vía Vats. I went SMG on his ass. Pop! Ten atoms.
---
Amazing!! Great job.
---
Well there is concept art for wintery themed NPCs and costumes in Wastelanders.
---
Because scorched earth is supposed to take place in the nuke zone
---
PS4
---
Damn man I would’ve given u some if u were Xbox
---
This is the one I was going to add. Pretty reliable ant spawn if the Deathclaw hasn’t already killed them.
---
And again with an ignorant post. Get off my post if you have nothing appropriate to add. NW has a lot of appeal to a lot of people over the base game that is stale most of the time. Very large discord server? What's large to you 25-50 people? I'm on several that have 100-300+ for just NW. It's obvious you don't like NW so go elsewhere.
---
No worries, thanks though. I'm just about done getting materials for the new one. Thankfully I had another suit, just not all the stuff for the last upgrade
---
I have a Batman character (unarmed Stealth ninja). Shall add and visit you.
---
Yeppp that’s what I hear but I wasn’t sure what else to focus on!
---
Pepper mod isn’t too rare.
---
Spicy mod is very rare, though.

Yea I try to find the sbq event cause almost guarantee to complete the challenge I just like to find the spots that I know will spawn certain things in a hurry to complete the daily and weekly challenges I noticed I have found spots for things that even google doesnt tell me and this was definitely one of thm so figured after completing it again today using this method was time to share.
---
As a Marylander living in SoCal I can testify that escape is possible.
---
I had no idea it works that way awesome trick thanks for sharing!!!
---
The Fever Clan discord is a Multi-game network with thousands of players. :)
---
You sure you're actually changing servers? If you go too fast you will just take the same spot you left.
---
Close to desktop then re join and your good
---
And the base AP cost is irrelevant on the handmade thanks to the AP reduction legendary prefix. I have infinite AP. Hundreds of bullets and critical hits. Auto receiver, aligned mods, red dot sight, quick mag and legendary prefix seem to put me at 100% AP reduction. Energy guns dont have an auto receiver, just a barrel. In my tests, the barrel does not reduce AP cost by 50% like the ballistic receiver does. It is likely energy guns cannot completely reduce AP costs to near zero like ballistic weapons can.
---
Xbox exclusives are trash compared to PS4 / switch. Running most games on or above 60 fps is NOT meaningless either. It's obvious you've never played above 60 fps if you can say that with a straight face. Almost all games have an advantage at higher frame rates if your rig can handle it, but Xbox can't and everyone knows it. So again get off the post if you have nothing constructive to add.
---
SB vs Grafton monster vs 6 glowing ghouls at WS. Got a pic on the load screen for PS4.
---
I have an anti-armor faster fire radium rifle I would like to use, but wont until I have learned to harden, silence, etc. That Will take me years.
---
Ye... Gone. Reasoning was to focus on wastlanders. Sucks.
---
But, you could be the 4th player of the team
---
As all Californians know, snow is something you drive to see.  When you are done, you drive back to 70s and sunny.  So I too would love snow in the game...as long as it stays on my computer screen.
---
I personally think everybody is setting the bar way too high and coming up with very unrealistic expectations for some sort of fo76 2.0.
---
So you're taking a multi game server and saying that 100s of players are only playing normal mode. Not that discord can tell the difference. Your ignorance is showing.
---
How much money will it be and can you play it no matter where in the game you are, or only one if you’ve completed it?
---
I play on a 240hz monitor and it doesn't make this game any better than playing on a TV, it's just an Xbox port.
---
My bad I meant build as in camp ideas 😅
---
No quests or enemies will be going away. Some quests will most likely be changed so they would make sense with humans around.
---
Sounds fun!
---
Level 30 some powerful cards open up. If I recall correctly fire proof shows up, scorch beast become more of a nuisance than a threat. 
---
White knight for armor durability and reduced repair costs. 
---
I wouldn't have gotten by without enforcers. Stops most things in thier tracks.
---
I appreciate the effort you put into this. I would participate.
---
214 &amp; 972 Represent!
---
Yeah sadly this game kinda a cash cow now
---
I'm not the only one who witnessed it then.
---
Thanks for posting this OP. Wasn't sure when it started. I'm trying to get 30 3* weapons to post in my weapons vendor with several signs around it that says "Extermination is Everyone's Duty"
---
I didn't say only normal mode, I said nobody plays NW. I have a lvl 300 adventure mode character and a lvl 200 survival character. I'm sad to see survival go but it needs improvement before coming back. NW is dying so fast that they had to remove the region lock and remove survival mode to boost the amount of players per match. NW needs to die and have an improved survival mode come back.
---
what happened during the Superbowl that one year in 2011. Dallas shut down.. driving to work was a mess and then the whole city closed. Yep... 5 inches and lots of ice and DFw loses its mind
---
I have no idea what you just said, or what you are attempting to convey.
---
Straight calling bullshit and that you're lying then. I play on 250 hz gsync monitor and it's 1000 times better than 60 hz. You obviously have no idea what you're talking about and just making shit up at this point. Just leave the post, because you're showing how stupid you are at this point.

Yup I can't count the number of times. 
---
1* Instigating Lever: next day looted a 3* Instigating Lever
---
1* Bloodied Lever: within a week looted a 2* Bloodied Lever w/ Limb Damage
---
1* Bloodied DCG: survival challenge for The Unstobbable Monster came back and I wound up with two of them (two accounts). 
---
1* Instigating DCG: Over several weeks I got 2x 3* Instigating DCG from the purveyor. One with swing speed and one with reduced weight. I don't remember the exact combos because I never use them. 
---
Same thing with Unyielding armor when I was leveling up my unarmed.
---
+100
---
Making this work isn't easy!  Give the team the credit they deserve, total props.
---
I see a doggo in your camp!!
---
I liked the dmg reduction, made it feel like more of MMO style PvP than just typical FPS battles
---
Lemme rephrase this a a El Paso person what is snow
---
Unstoppable Monster rules them all. I keep it in the stash because it feels like cheating. My favourite is my faster swing executioner Knuckles, but the monster does like four times the damage. Not even my instigating power fist does that.
---
It spawns you at fissure prime which is inside the nuke zone... yet, if you click any other location in the nuke zone you cannot fast travel there. So what is the purpose of that restriction?
---
Yes! I love having a dog or wolf in camp. That devoted gaze 😍
---
Isnt fallout 76 perpetually set October?
---
people are bored man
---
daaaaamn
---
Thank you for the suggestion. Can definitely do that.
---
That's a cool idea! Stop by anytime.
---
Thank you!
---
I’d like SOMETHING PvP focused. Hunter Hunted giving a non-legendary piece of combat armor isn’t incentive enough.
---
Yup it's broken. I killed every scorched enemy on the list at a SBQ fight the normal scorched and queen counted everything else didn't register.
---
Ignore him.  Go to his camp and hang out.  If you engage youll be in pvp he is trying to get you to pvp by being an ass.
---
Would definitely participate, I’ve always had a thought to hold a PvP war like this however one reoccurring problem among all my tournament trials was the 24 server cap, even with all 24 people involved somehow you have to consider that you’d have people who’d want there vendors just outside the event  to sell, some who’d just want to spectate, of course the competitors, officials to make sure it runs smoothly etc. once you add it all up 24 is just not enough
---
Sweet build!  Great work on getting the switch hidden, I'll have to swing by and check it out!
---
Cool. I also ran into a Alpha crab ( the name slipped my mind. The crabs in the vans) just crawling around. I don't remember ever seeing one like that.
---
Its the make or break &gt;-&lt; , its gonna be nice having the big narrative get more life and can go forward for WV. Maybe explore some other cities outside of it in the future. I feel the Pitt needs to be a thing someday.
---
No.
---
Yep.
---
Ya ure fine as long as you don’t hit back and stay away from workshops.  But really just under your team/friend menu tab, under recent fine his name and block him then jump servers
---
Two spots snow Ive run into.
---
It was a mess. You couldn't pay attention to what was going on, because too much was going on. And it lasted for a long time. The scorchbeasts were shitting all over the place and a guy was marsupialing from roof to roof swinging His Grognak's. He couldn't hit shit but it was epic.
---
He is just shooting all my generators and stuff and I can’t tell if it’s actually doing anything
---
Everything since launch has been a sort of disappointment. And I’ve never been more discouraged than I am right now, as a PvP focused player, getting rid of survival is a major turn-off
---
Its horrifying how they are handling the store. I feel the amount of stuff added into the game since the start is a spec of whats been made for the store only.
---
Shouldnt do anything if it does a bounty will appear.  Maybe youre in the spot his camp is isially at and hes trying to get you to leave.
---
I would stay and chill at his camp.  You could also ask another player to pvp him there are hunters that seek that but not in this thread google search that reddit thread and hire a gun for hire.
---
Lmao 250hz monitor. They are 240 or 300. Stop lying you sound stupid.
---
This is the exact reason why I bought the Qffr Tesla and have put on a assassins sentinel set. I'm tired of this happening to me too. I'm gonna start fighting back. I'm sick of just sitting there or having to leave
---
An*
---
Was it hard to find?  thats a pacified attack dog right?
---
I realllllly want to have faith and believe they’re truly working on something “different”. It is very hard to trust them it seems. So I set my expectations low and assume we’ll have a few added quests where you talk to a NPC instead of a robot. And you’ll get some dialogue choices to make you feel good about yourself. I just don’t see how they can truly integrate NPC’s the Fallout way like people are thinking without totally reworking the game.
---
Ass*
---
I actually wouldn't mind tbh.
---
Delay it, launch it on the test servers first then roll it out to everyone.
---
Thanks. I just searched his name in this subreddit and apparently he is a known dude
---
2nd grade english*
---
Who is it?  What platform?
---
He's an attack dog. I sometimes have great luck searching for pacified animals. Attack dogs don't live long even in the forest region. He lived 3 days. I now have a wolf. Both were found at the random spawn west of Big Bs.
---
Ok. You became an ass in 1 reply. Not an easy task.
---
Are you on Xbox? If so if they're still around what's your gt?
---
I just ignore it I feel it pisses them off more not giving into their bullshit.
---
Or theirs
---
Xbox waldfaultier
---
I agree but I've had it. It's getting worse.
---
It wasnt always like that. They messed it up so bad back in August
---
An xbox troll.  Keep your eye out for bounty hunters and hire one to get him while youre near by then take his loot after.
---
Waldfaultier
---
He's "offline", are you still on the same server?
---
I linked to a thread above where he was bothering people
---
Hee-mthafkn-haw
---
Damn
---
That’s cool
---
I blocked him and hopped servers. I just turned the Xbox off
---
Fair enough :P I'll just keep an eye out then, he'll appear online at some point
---
Yeah I literally sat there for like 10-15 minutes and he just kept whacking me or shooting the gun
---
The whole compas bar could use a update/colors, its starting to show its age
---
Thanks, I appreciate it haha
---
I dindu nuffin
---
Been the way it is now for a few months now at least. 
---
I like both versions, version 1 felt like we got to see what the airport was like during normal responders operations, version 2 feels more like a last stand location.
---
Can I go through it this weekend
---
Some start throwing pumpkin grenades at you too.
---
Isnt the actual holiday in March? I want like a better Monster mash or something for Halloween lol
---
I think it is going to be way smaller than people think, and many Will go crazy and complain here over and over. Mostly the ones who play eight hours every day and run out quests and events really fast.
---
Like I’m not saying anything along the lines of, “we are so much better” I’m saying we focus our builds on pvp, pvp constantly and therefore have more experience and frankly if you compare the gear of just my pvp group it’s miles above anything the majority of the player base has access to. Like for example how many people do you know with 3 pieces of Unyielding Sentinal AP Refresh And a piece of chameleon Sentinal AP Refresh? Just our sets alone put us pvp players, and us high end pvp players at a instant advantage. To counteract you’d have to say something like you can only use non legendary equipment, which then means the tournament loses half its draw
---
snow and a flying santa ghoul that drops presents.
---
Everyone is naked with none legendary black powdered weapons crafted at the same level. If everything runs smooth then you outfit everyone in civil war clothes and clip ppl having fun
---
For why?
---
It is in March but the devs said the robots control the event and can do it whenever they want I guess 😂
---
I enjoy it
---
It's very red 😂 It's not bright red, but it's definitely red
---
That would require Bethesda to do actual work tho and they don't seem to good at that
---
Well, speaking strictly for myself here, PvP is not my in game focus, but I do have a respectable PvP build ready to go if needs be, and I have a group of similar friends.
---
That being said, kills will never win the Battle of Charleston. While they Pure PvP-spec builds are shithousing the Landfill, the multi-spec, PvE players are capping Wade, the Capitol, and Poseidon, and collecting the actual resources that determine victory.
---
Fair enough I like the premise :) but I’m not sure everyone would, maybe if you had different comps that you could enter for different prizes? Like have a PA comp where the price is a Fully modded suit or a god tier heavy gun egc
---
Pitting similar builds and players against each other
---
Let's hope they do cause I'm so tired of Meat week, I needs me some sp00ky masks 🤠
---
I'll PayPal you $5 if it isn't.
---
But let’s face it, those pvp players are just going to do what we always do, see a captured workshop or acknowledge a pve player and make the assumption they haven’t visited there stash recently and go over and either 1. Take the workshop killing the player and not only forcing the pve player to do all the hard work but gaining the junk they had on them, the workshops assests and the workshop to draw others o try and take it form them, who will inevitably fail just giving that pvp player more junk
---
The update will be free, all you need is to own the base game. They said that wastelanders gonna get new main questline but there was no info on wether they will ditch the current main quest completely or not. We also don't have any info on how one will start that new quest line
---
However on the other hand arguing against a pvp player just abusing there pvp superiority the pve player can play smart, waiting for this pvp player to be engaged and then reclaiming or farming while crouched etc, or do the really sneaky thing and claim the workshop, build resource collectors  at a workshop then with the help of another player make the workshop unowned  and hey presto, stealth collectors that they can abuse, a pvp player is often to lazy to be the first to cap a workshop because we assume nothings placed etc and there’s no benefit in killing anyone, which means the draw for a PvP player and the entire tip off that the PvP player gets to the workshop being active is minimised leaving them none the wiser
---
I used to live there in BC now but I know the feel of those winds. 
---
May the warmth be with you this winter Fellow Canadian Wastlander!
---
I didn't know what are you talking about sorry.
---
Can you explain me?
---
Maybe you need warm clothing at night or during radsnow storms
---
Start already?
---
don't forget 70s and sunny at the snow places during the day after snowing all night
---
between the native explosive stagger and the one gun army stagger, I can't tell you how many Bloodieds I've dropped because they got overconfident and dead because they decided the noob in the Atom Shop PA would be an easily kill.
---
Do I spam Stims? Fuck yes. I also consider myself low on ammo if I'm under 10k rds.
---
The only possible way I can think to upgrade this build for PvP would be with an AAE minigun, to raise the OneGun Army Stagger rate.
---
Because, like I said, I'm built for teamplay. I don't have to kill them, one of my bloodied VATS sniper buddies usually does it while they can't move.
---
I've figured out the password problem, and submitted a heat ticket. #191002-000079. Also I noticed the link said there was different speeds depending on where in my house you were. So right next to the PS4 the speed is 170Mbps
---
Darn, PC
---
I would add to you post, actually fixing bugs, and or making sure that new update doesnt brake more than it fixes. and maybe, and thats a big maybe
---
nah who am i kidding, no I cant support it a lot more needs to change.
---
My new base is at the top of a cliff. A player with the marsupial mutation can climb up to it if they know the right route. There is an area at the top of the cliff that is usable for camp building and a small spot that will allow a C.A.M.P. box to be deployed. A short distance back from the edge of the cliff, the playable area of the map ends. You can't go very far in either direction along the edge of the cliff either. I'm waiting to see if enemies will spawn in "You can't go there" territory.
---
Haven’t seen any reports of that happening in awhile now. Not to mention BGS released a patch that supposedly addressed that issue
---
i would say every weapon from events need to have some type off legendary effect or it is worthless, at least for me.
---
I have no idea what it was. He was crafting something at my bench and turned around and had this huge launcher thing
---
Sick\~
---
Extra crispy.
---
Sentinel by far- you can always favorite a food/drug that gives u quick AP fill.
---
Hellfire is also from broken steel dlc. Creation club was just to add it to fallout 4.
---
Do you mean someone to carry stuff around, or a third party escrow service?
---
I just said that...
---
at night with the right lighting it looks so damn nice.
---
Hmmm... and you crafted film for it? I dont know then I haven't used my camera in awhile so maybe it's broken like a few other things since the last update....
---
My IGN is Pryce\_Permafrost.  
---
I have a medic build so I can spam stimpaks and hopefully keep the team alive, the downside is that my damage output is pathetic so someone else will have to do the killing.
---
a Fat Man? A normal missile launcher?
---
PC, PS4, or XBox? If XBox, I'll gladly craft some lamps at your base, no charge. I have plenty of scrap and it'll probably give me xp for making the stuff anyway.
---
Yes, I have 56. I crafted it a couple months ago, but never attempted to use it before now.
---
Just curious... Why were floating camps being condemned? Mine is only floating because the buggy ass game wouldn't let me place or move the camp anywhere otherwise...
---
Did you repair the camera?
---
Nov 14 is one year
---
Yes! Absolutely. last night I had a similar experience as the one I described above, I love the FO76 community
---
No, no option to
---
you are discribing survival mode that was just taken off the game lol .
---
The most stars i got from killing a 3 star creature was yesterday in whitesprings. Killed a 3* legendary got a 2* forest armor peice. But as for weapons all i get is 1* garbage.
---
I run a bloodied explosive build, which im probably Gonna change up
---
Feels legit like Year 1 Rahool designed this legendary drop system. Oh that's a nice purple engram you got there, would be a shame if that decrypted to a blue...
---
Actualy u would be thinking of the movie Andaconda.
---
Ok. So meat week fails because of a few reasons. But the main one a are when people don't deposit critter chunks, don't pick up bone piles, fires are not put out.
---
As for the primal cuts. I'm not sure how you fail them. Just kill the marked enemies. Only time I fail these is when I rock up late and people are shooting mole rats and not the bigger stuff there supposed to.
---
I’ve never failed meat cook. Been playing over and over every hour. Do not think it’s rigged. But do think people suck at this game. Or on their own path of some sort. Artkos pharmacy is Same issue
---
Don't pay more than 20. Even that might be too much.
---
There are legitimate sellers that have have cheaper keys as the game was overstocked and hard to sell after the launch fiasco.
---
they kinda get us out out groundhog day first lol
---
As an Australian, I have no idea what you are talking about.
---
If there people want lie each other I'm out or don't know what is Mean 60fps rock solid I'm out
---
Maybe people just do the event for the exp and don't bother turning in the chunks and greens.
---
&gt;on their own path of some sort
---
could be that, can't think what though, oh well
---
Like I’ve heard of people giving a 3rd person the stuff to trade to the other person or something along those lines to avoid scammers
---
you gay
---
jk but it is spoken with a chinese accent that is why it sounds weird in english
---
yaow quai - with accent mix the q and g

Thanks!

Do you know if the level of the crafted weapon increases the chance of learning a mod when you scrap it? I've been wanting to unlock mods for many of my weapons, but keep delaying it because I don't know if crafting a bunch of low level ones will save materials while still unlocking mods at the same rate as if I scrapped a whole bunch of high level ones.
---
Just because you see people running around does not mean they are doing it right. I passed it with less and the bar was full.
---
A bit of both but mostly run and gun

As another Australian, I agree with my fellow kinsmen.
---
Because they haven't improved over time, nor worked on their flaws.
---
It took them like 6 months to let the handmade skin go live. I think that was datamined in the winter.
---
Not quite sure how post pic but my character looks as close as I could get to Harley Quinn from Suicide Squad
---
Yeah ofc now in 4k.... Bb have a good life
---
They must be hording the meat for some reason, it spoils anyway.
---
Yup. Mine were picked today and I had to replace the lock.
---
YW!
---
Sometimes it displays a legendary you've previously picked up. It's happened to me more than a few times. Often times, it would show an item I've had in my possession for ages but had recently transferred to or from my stash. Not sure if this relates, just conjecture.
---
If you  see the event Leader of the Pack, do it every time.  It will give you low level legendary items you can use or scrip.  It is in the forest near the fairground, so the enemies are low level.
---
It's a common bug that happens when you open the game. It's a simple fix.
---
Step 1: Close the game.
---
If he removed the locks, he should show up as wanted. Everyone who lock picked my home today showed up as wanted because of it, including someone who's in my friends list and was picking the locks as an experiment we were doing to see if you get a notification when people bust your lock. You don't get notified, for the record. If you're close enough to them, their name will show up in the top left as now being wanted, but there's nothing there saying they picked your lock. First lock that my friend picked was while I was across the map. No notification at all, not even the blip saying he's wanted now. Second lock, I watched him pick it, didn't even have the option to try to interrupt him (short of shooting at him), and only got the screen blip saying he's wanted now.
---
I picked up a 3 star with agi that morphed into a 2 star without it.  Yes, it's happening.
---
...the game had been open for hours before this happened?
---
This is also happening, yes.
---
Hmm. Yeah, that might be it. I've seen it display the last legendary I've taken or put away loads of times, but it hasn't done that when getting a new one, atleast not until the last month or so.
---
The event needs people on all the drums and spits.  That alone will stop the progress from dropping.  that way the collectors can actually make progress.  Everyone I have been on that failed last time and this time, no one works the spits or drums.
---
Keep checking the map for Hoard events in the forest and ash heap.  Join them and kill the legendary.  You can get some very good gear for your level.
---
Bait
---
Thx
---
You can basically ask for what ever you want. You’re looking at least 75k so trade wisely. I’ve just traded for one after giving up on ever finding it. If you look on the trading sub you’ll see that when someone puts when up, everyone will offer you lots of good stuff.
---
I'm the one in the Elder Coat / Blackbird T-60. 
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/SbFabp1
---
Also, it can't be put in a weapon display for your kitchen..
---
This post is more likely than not intentionally baiting for attention with the ridiculous prices for such an item. 
---
Here’s you go I guess😂
---
It is planned for next month.
---
You really believe someone on here has any specifics? Sit and wait like the rest if us, your just going to get speculation in here.
---
50ish caps per scrip if it's something someone might actually use.  The rest get recycled.  
---
1 star vampires pipe gun, 250.  2 star 750 unless it's explosive or ffr, then WAY more.  2k for any useful 3 star.  Level also somewhat matters; either max or min are worth a bit more.  
---
I think this is pretty fair and reflects what I have bought/sold both through vendors and the trade sub.  Garbage scrip I'll pay 10 each at player vendors every time.
---
I was confused as to why that would be early before hemispheres occured to me
---
I have 4 flags but missing the apron, red fireworks and tenderiser..
---
Exactly my point. But I still kill plenty.
---
my problem is using the quick wheel, it can cause 5-20 seconds of lag.
---
Or, I am misunderstanding you, but since my pistols don't reach damage cap, pretty sure I need those guerrilla perks equipped still.
---
Scrip legendary 3 stars I sell at 666 caps. 1* at 111 2* at 222
---
Good combo legendaries differs greatly
---
I still use my All Rise even now I'm lvl103, but I do agree with grognak axe and pole hook as alternatives, and I would add the Fire axe to the list as well, it's a very underrated 2H melee imo
---
Yeah, a separate mode like that would be cool. What survival mode should have been.
---
FYI : "nukacrypt"
---
Glowing wendigo vs. glowing yao guai. The yao guai won with half of its health still there after the fight.
---
Also, a deathclaw vs. a group of super mutants near Top of the World. The super mutants were not having fun. Bonus entertainment was tagging the deathclaw with the Vox Syringer during the fight.
---
Just make sure that you have Passive mode turned on.  Then nothing can ever happen to you save for workshop events.  Then just block them, report them for harassment (same menu) and switch servers.  You'll never see from them again and just get on with your life.
---
Yup
---
Not me, taking to the wastelander lifestyle. Still have a designated pee corner tho.
---
I don't understand the lack of "Looking for Group" or "Looking for More" in this game.  PUGS are some of the most fun you can have in these types of games, why can't we have this functionality?

Welcome to reddit this must be your first day.

The Brotherhood of Steel - Hellfire Chapter
---
PM Sentinel Looch for enlistment details (Discord Looch#7529).
---
UK checking in. Everything grinds to a halt in snow, so they'd have to disable fast travel for me.
---
A couple of months ago they updated a vendor (I think foundry?) in the enclave base, they now sell every mod plan.
---
It snowed in Montana already
---
It'll be delayed, the way they've been handling stuff lately.
---
Since last patch you can, but believe, you don't want to ;) It doesn't look nice, as both items interpenetrate each other.
---
You know nothing John Snow
---
Delay is very possible, so I wouldn't gird my loins too much if I was you. Besides, everybody is so excited about NPCs, however they need to understand that NPCs might not change the game for good. I mean if there's no interesting plot or meaningful choices, what do NPCs change on a brod scale? Probably nothing.
---
I just tried it today, not an hour ago. Maybe it was the Green Hood I tried it with, but it didn't work. Might just be my opinion, but I think it would look good with it. Who knows? haha
---
I don't want to change your mind, I'm happy with the PvP state in the game as it's now ;)
---
Although the content is lacking it leaves a lot for you and fired to make up. Its great for people wanting to RP factions (like I do with the BoS)
---
Despite its flaws, the game is only as fun as you make it
---
Power armor scrapping doesn't teach you mods for any of Pa variants, so why you think X-01 would be different?
---
As the kids say, dis gonna be good.
---
There's a ski mask and winter coats in the concept art shown at last year's e3. Hopefully it's not going to be npc or Atomic Shop exclusive.
---
As a South African I would also like to have my first snow Christmas
---
Exactly. It looks like you're on PS4 otherwise I'd shoot you and invite to my group.
---
As Finish I’d like to get my winter-boots on. And if there is no snow in the winter it’s pitch black here. We’ve had the first snow come a couple of times in January and the darkness till then is just unreal and f’n depressing. And it rains like hell after the summer so every car ride is like near death experience in the darkness. Sorry, got sidetracked. Yes SNOW please!!!
---
You get the nuka cola dark recipe as a reward from doing the Biv repeatable quests. They usually reward a recipe, one of which is the dark.
---
You could check out player vendors too. They can sometimes be found there - although it may be a fortunate find as in my experience of selling them they dont hang around for long!
---
I think Biv gives anything related to alcohol. I'm not sure if you can get the rest of them.
---
I came back after a few months away, went to the airport and saw the vendor was dead, I thought it was a bug or something lol.
---
Ok thx for the fast answer gonna start his quest now
---
All that nuclear fallout has radioactive greenhouse gases trapped. Sorry but it’s hot year round.
---
its funny though that the urban mask can be worn with hats and hoods
---
It's definitely gonna be a npc location later. Has weapon and armor benches there in a semi secure area.
---
Yess I use drifter outfit too
---
GTAO does this at Christmas and it so underused. You can pick up snow and throw snowballs at people.
---
Seems a massive effort for a short time event in 76 though. As much as id like it.
---
Nuclear winter should have a blizzard that kills you when you step out of the circle.
---
Oh yes duh!
---
Yes i duped!
---
No plans for underarmor itself, only lining. Shielded lining (the best one possible) plan you can find in hidden lab in the Mire, near Tanangra Town.
---
I expected something for Halloween since that's a pretty Important date in lore.
---
Sure im like lvl 36 what region are you from?

I had DCG extra claw gauntled, so it definitelly exists. The others you've mentioned I miss too in my collection.

No, I tried building my camp on the road leading from Point Pleasant (video 5) but it kept saying "Cannot place camp outside player area"
---
As an Oregon man I'll see the snow,see the sun melt it the same day, then rain, and follow it by being warm enough again by dinner time to enjoy a bbq outside in shorts and a t-shirt.
---
It took a long while for me to get Nuka Dark, so best of luck with the RNG gods!
---
Is it safe- i find it on Sale for 26.00 with key active at G2A - Is it safe to buy for Xbox?
---
What do you mean?
---
My freind and I will play with you. I'm from America and there from the Philippines.
---
Sweet thanks bro, I’ll add you if you can drop your PSN
---
I'm collecting plans, but I'm not obsessed with getting all of them, especially most are useless and I would never craft things they've teach me. I do actively look after them, but I'm not keen to sacrifice my best items to get them.
---
No because he doesn’t have his OP Legendary Items and Marsupial.
---
He actually would require skill in NW.
---
I don't understand when you say someone helping to fight a queen makes it harder. If there's not at least 8 people at the event don't go.    Ghoulish is your best friend. Idk. Maybe I've just speced my character different. But the only thing that can come close to killing me is a 100 legendary mire queen. I'm only lv 85. I do wear power armor though. Its not the best tho.
---
Oh sorry, that would definitely help out wouldn't it. Lol, my PSN is HillbillyDLUX08
---
More needs more spook!!!
---
As for drops it can be rewarded from most Savage Divide events. If you have mats (fluxes) I can shielded your underarmor, but I'll be home in around 8 hours.
---
I'm on pc
---
My timezone is CEST. It's 10 AM here.   
---
My IGN is Pryce\_Permafrost.
---
Workshops are useless and pointless currently. The return given for defending isn't worth it. My defenses I set up should hold off an defend event at least once. So I can go do something else. There's to many defend missions. You get more then one workshop. RIP doing anything else for 5 hours till you get a disconnect. It'd be better if you could save a workshop setup and rebuild it instantly. I'm not wasting 30 minutes building to get my mats destroyed when I leave the game.
---
Nice we have the exactly same timezone! I can be up for it in an hour if you can too
---
If we have real world-aligned seasons then we may need to consider how many days are in each of those seasons.
---
Sure. I'll wait.
---
Well you can always use something different in PvP to start with. But yes, it's an unfortunate (but hilarious) bug.
---
My char opened a chem shop in his shack, it went really well, and now i upgraded to a supermarket... the name and good prices are still the same tho :D

---
Absolute legendary idea, let me just stop pvping after I’ve spent hundreds of hours trading and playing for what I have
---
The thing is tho that it’s not like I’m using a explosive laser or Tesla, or when I do I find it doesn’t occur nearly as frequently as it does with a plasma
---
I'm level 181
---
I’ve been to scared about loosing my account to try vault raids
---
Move.
---
Did you just start the game? If so, yrs the vault jumpsuit is basically something for your character to wear. You should be able to find some armor pretty quick
---
(Posting as a new comment as I'm not sure if the OP gets notification for a response to a previous comment).
---
**Bug?:** post server maintenance (October 1), I've seen humanoid scorched spawning inside a Nuke Silo, specifically in the launch room. I recorded the aftermath: one stuck in the floor and the other one turned into pile (robots don't carry rifles, do they?). [Video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYA44UkkB9Y)
---
This is correct. To add - the plasma thrower (flame thrower) on the plasma rifle counts for Rifleman Perks. It's a lot of fun. But you'll need a lot of plastic to keep yourself in ammo.
---
No, I’ve been playing for a while... I could have sworn when I was playing yesterday my vault suit was the same as it is in Fo4... maybe i just never processed that it was different
---
Vault jumpsuits and other underarmor only give resistance if you mod them with lining otherwise they're just cosmetic. Is yours modded?
---
Add peeps who do pvp, I play mornings and would be down.
---
Can’t say this is 100%. Been sever hopping for about an hour here and haven’t seen one
---
Exit the server by clicking your own name at the top of the Social tab. You'll never join the same server no matter how fast you do it.
---
Vault Jumpsuits mods are very easy to obtain, you'll find them in the Overseer caches as you progress the main quests, for other underarmor it gets a more complicated I'm afraid.   
---
Long story short pretty much every other underarmor you buy the first two tiers from vendors and then you have a very slim chance to find the other two tiers from specific events or quests.
---
Got it all
---
Alright, give me a couple minutes while I restart because of usual the frozen social menu bug.
---
My ign is Trizcondronius ...quite hard to spell btw i'm sending friend request right now
---
It's amazing how all those good stories end up with the same statement: " Then the server crashed. "
---
How about they fix the explosive laser rifles freezing peoples games 1st so people can actually pvp fairly
---
Then the server crashed.....the ending to every great story in Appalachia
---
Berry-Mentats
---
He looks awesome!
---
At the Cemetery in the ash heap, there are 3 lvl 3  safes
---
Tbh I’m always down to pvp but whenever I find someone else who’s down , there’s always something wrong , such as my armour being broken , my gun being broken or I’m over encumbered.. so I’m basically forced to pass on it
---
Can t find a stash on your house
---
But if the person doesn’t use stealth boys or you run Tesla yourself?:)
---
It's the desk, can't you hear me? I'm trying to talk.
---
Yeah pretty cool to see this back!
---
Right? It was kind of the perfect Fallout 76 experience. And wrapped up so definitively. Good thing it was past bed time lol
---
Agreed, end game players are feeling no incentive to keep playing with the limited amount of high level content. Opening up the map and adding more level 100 baddies would definitely spice things up.
---
Got audio off and just crashed :((((((
---
Did you crash? You didn't give me the underarmor yet.
---
"... and then it crashed." is what we'll tell our grandchildren. 😅
---
Sorry, I meant a list of what drops from level 3 safes. Wondering if there's ever anything special in them?
---
Was just setting price for it when it crashed
---
It's fine, I've just been trying to tell you I had that extra plan if you needed it and that the cache was there. I'll wait for you to come back.
---
Ohh, ok
---
I'd like to apologize, you were right. I guess I've always fixed stuff asap that I never noticed it stayed equipped. And since guns unequip I just assumed armor did, too. Learn something new everyday, as they say.
---
So with the armor broken you get a better sneak, or what is the upside to this? I'm curious about the benefits.
---
this x2000 I’m pretty new but ive met a couple people who make this game lit as fuck. we hang out, make jokes at todd’s expense, and build bases with nothing in them. i just made a base shaped like a mushroom cloud and i was wheezing the whole time
---
Psychobuff, Berry Mentats, and Calmex are always what I use. If you use VATS crits, you'd be amazed at the difference of damage by not having Calmex.
---
Trade interface doesnt show up
---
AHAHAHAHAHAAHAH THAT SAME FUCKING JOKE AGAIN!!!
---
Better servers?
---
I played it 0 times...so everything 🤔
---
The Abominable Grafton Monster!
---
I never was awarded a red firework, but I found one dropped on someone's roof earlier, so I got everything by now.
---
I’ll definitely keep that in mind about Calmex, thanks!
---
Thank you so much and sorry for the patience issues
---
No problem, let me know if you ever need something else modded.
---
It's one of those locations that's almost certainly gonna have people in when wastelanders drops. There's a few of them and in trying to keep note of some of the main ones
---
Jeez, don’t know how I’ve never noticed any of that before. The raider one would do well for my build but I’m not sure where to find raider under armour and the mods are way too expensive for me atm
---
tnx my dude ... if it works it'll be just amazing
---
I ended up buying one from someones vendor for like 2 or 3 hundred caps...just because I wanted to get one if it didn't drop for me. But I still want one to drop.
---
Got everything last Meat Week, I can give you a free Tato Salad recipe if you're on PC.
---
No interest in playing or just starting out?

I'm on PC.

just put them in the train stations

As an Irish woman in Northern Ireland I can confirm this statement. I freaking love the snow though, provided I have nowhere to be and can just stay inside and look out at it 😂
---
Adderall
---
Too true how bout they fix legit all the game breaking bugs in pvp like people not showing up red for others while they can do full damage etc
---
A good while back I thought I saw something about a loot table, but the fast few weeks I thought about it and couldn't find any information. 
---
Thought about collecting data on it myself via the three rank 3 safes at the cemetery. Just haven't gotten around to it.
---
Currently have almost a complete set of lockpicking ultralight armor sitting in my stash to speed up the process.
---
Just remember to not pick up anything from a container if you want to server hop and get another reroll of loot without having to wait until the next day.
---
Sent you a request.
---
Thanks for the info. Have you personally found something impressive in them?
---
Just public events
---
I miss Red Fireworks Mine and Tenderizer plans, that should be on rewards list.
---
I recently managed to get a queen all to myself. A friend stayed in a server overnight on the drums at grahms bbq and so his vendors were getting traffic while he slept. I logged on in the morning to see him and his other account still in the server but no one else. I quickly ran to alpha and launched on queen. Got her all to myself, 12 or so minutes later and she was dead.  Sure I died a few times but that's the price of running a bloodied glass cannon stealth build.

Love getting to fight her myself, she takes more damage and less trash mobs spawn in to interfere with the fight.
---
video of it here if anyone wants to check it out [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VurYfomxNTs&amp;t=406s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VurYfomxNTs&amp;t=406s)

"Then the server crashed"
---
"So say we all"
---
Agreed. The only end game enemy worth fighting are other players right now.
---
So you seem like someone who might help me: been maining/pvping in fps no-vats PA HW build since ages and would like to perhaps try a new VATS gunslinger character. Got a nice collection of pistols, lasers, gammas and whatnot as a by-product of trading; any tips and tricks?  Like do pipe revolvers stack with rifle AND pistol perks? Any good combinations I should look for..?
---
hahah! dude that was creepy. i like the strobe in the electric chair room. i have a strobe in my elect chair room to. but i also have these tesla trap things that shoot electricity all over, but what sux is they break and you have to repair them after a while .
---
Thanks a lot man.
---
Toxic valley is just heavily polluted therefore not hot just unsafe the ash heap on the other hand has coal fires underground and on the surface so the ash heap is really hot in some places
---
Same here. Upgraded from a 1050 ti to 2060 super, what a world of difference XD. I'm actually able to see the buttons on my leather armor now that its no longer a blurry smudged up mess. I think some of the god rays are overkill but for the most part it feels like I'm playing a new game.
---
Btw now I know the real price but I can't offer too much, so would you like 2500 caps?
---
I'm only missing the firework mine.
---
But it drives me nuts that there isnt a plan for either the mine or the tenderizer.
---
The tenderizer i can kind of understand, but not having a plan for a consumable explosive is ridiculous
---
Early into the announcement of Wastelanders I thought they mentioned that you would be able to trigger the time skip of Wastelanders or be able to stay in the original setting as long as you would like.
---
That could of easily changed during development so no telling what that may mean.
---
Yes mate that’s fine. IGN is the same as here
---
Bone armor?when is this comming?never heard of it
---
In your game settings you can have the numbered damage your enemies are taking after resistances show up as they are hit. 
---
This is great for seeing stuff like that. 
---
Well I supposed you can look at your weapon damage from your pipboy and then rearrange perk cards to see how much it changes.
---
Yeah idk why they didn't make the firework a plan ffs. It would be nice to make those for New Years or next year's 4th of July.
---
Its put now, it's a skin for excavator armour, looks pretty cool and has a sheep skull on the helmet.
---
Ow lol i actualy have the bone skin!i thought it was some new normal armor.yeh i thought its looking pretty cool to.i just visited the atom shop but not seen it tho
---
Complete daily quests and any events that pop.
---
Learn plenty of plans from scrapping.
---
It may seem impossible but try to hit your daily vendor cap selling limit. My grind advice is going to the amusement park in the ash heap.
---
Clear it out, sell to the vendor on site, switch servers and repeat. You'll gain plenty of caps &amp; xp.
---
Haha yeah I'd love a set of bone armour skins for my low-power armour stuff. Ah well, the excavator is still really nice.
---
It is a great resource, I have used it earlier, but it isn't that good for specifically finding locked terminals. "Terminal" points out any generic terminal, whether locked or not, and many locked terminals instead have unique names that still doesn't suggest if they are locked or not.
---
45 minutes to launch a nuke? Yeeowch..
---
I sent you my GT.
---
Don't kid yourself, no matter how long they push it back it will still have bugs and issues. The sooner the better, in my opinion.
---
Vanguard Sentinel is what I use
---
Keep up with your repairs! Maybe it will unencumber you. lol 
---
I actually get over-encumbered real easily now that I am moving my build away from QOL to be more effective in PvP.
---
Vanguard does what again? Thx
---
For the genere it looks very nice! I'm playing all maxed out in full hd.
---
Dumb question.. but what is the BIV event?
---
lmao
---
I always run unyeilding just for the boost to stats you get even at half health itll boost your stats up and there isn't any pve situation you cant handle with half health then If you need more carry weight charisma for selling or whatever you can drop your health down sometimes I'll have 1 peice of chameleon or auto stim or something but unyeilding is my go to
---
I’ve had the red firework mine twice now and twice I’ve set it off at the end of the event.. didn’t realise it was in demand..
---
Good plan, thanks
---
more dr and er the higher your health.
---
Ah ok, will check that out thanks
---
👍
---
Those are rivers no tsunami in the mountains of West Virginia however a mudslide would do the trick to destroy my camp there
---
Mine often changes, some of the more interesting ones include:
---
* Grizzled middle-aged survivor, with a grey beanie, a drifter coat, and sometimes a gas-mask (Similar to yours)
---
* A terrifying abomination of pain and suffering, completely bald, pale, giant lips and no nose, usually wearing either a drifter coat with a uskansha hat/mining helmet and gasmask or an enclave uniform/clown costume/cult outfit with or without a gas mask.
---
* A literal witch, complete with wart and nose, in either enclave uniform or other, tight, potentially sexual clothing.
---
* Enclave Adolf Hitler.
---
* Waluigi, with blue eye-bags, pink nose, arched eyebrows and the closest thing to his moustache, in whatever I've found recently that looks the most like his overalls.
---
So say we all.
---
Yeah I haven't seen it drop once...
---
Give it a try it’s worked on pc and Xbox for me. Sometimes you have to get the timing just right but I collected 100 waters once for a challenge and it took barely a minute.
---
A (very limited) Sandbox PvE game without NPCs was a pretty dumb idea if you ask me. If one could create actual player factions and larger faction bases etc, with more pvp, it would make sense without npcs, but most Fallout players want pve and story :shrugs:
---
Wrong sub dude
---
I have 5 of every plan, a bunch of outfits and a tenderizer, but I have yet to get the damned firework mine.
---
Any data collected on level 3 safe loot tables?
---
in fact they’d have to make a bunch of teen ghouls that throw snowballs at your moving car
---
I have a few duplicates of the tenderizer plans save for peppered (which I JUST got one so that was nice), two tenderizers (got one as a drop and bought the other one), and so many damn outfits.
---
I got lucky with the tato salad, someone gave me it for free on here. I'd like to get it as a drop so I can give it to my friend who isn't playing Meat Week and missed out last time as well...but it's not the end of the world if I don't get it.
---
I'd really like to get some fireworks though...
---
Well Weightless is fine; Vanguard with chameleon is good; or just simply mixed pieces, you know you can get -15% damage from all creatures that way.
---
This thread showcases both everything wrong and right with this game.
---
I remember a good while back someone posted about their camp structure being made out of stash boxes and the ceiling being made out of countless power cables. Enough to block vision.
---
Don't forget that an update this huge will have so many bugs. If you are busy and don't get to play for a few months, you'll probably have a better experience. I am very much looking forward to some actual plot, quests and most of all SPECIAL checks other than Charisma.
---

You didn't see anything
---
Why do you want it? It's pretty useless and it's not like your gonna use it when you get one.
---
If nine people are running around you *will* fail.
---
Listen to what Grahm says to do.
---
If you haven't learned all the mutation serum plans I usually pick one up as I start to hit 30k.
---
So glad it's no longer a 25k cap limit.
---
They would have to actually create the cross play feature first which would take time.  So unless they already had it waiting and ready, we probably won't see it for a while.
---
If you ever see  a non-legendary enemies health go up you should change weapons.
---
It's an irritating bug.
---
Got it
---
You could just trade with them and offer 10k caps or so for one of there carrots.
---
Would be a nice feature but the amount of people using it would be low as most people still don't have all the buyable recipes and plans.
---
I'm a completionist...also I want one to keep, one to give to my friend and one to fire off to see what it's like.
---
 r slash mark    ET  seventy six
---
I must have gone biv 100 times and It never dropped for me. If you really want it put a request on the marketplace reddit. Expect to pay about 4k.
---
Yeah true, I didn’t even think of that one hey?! DOH!!!
---
I think the frequency of storms is fine but the duration isn't. They should increase the length of storms to run a full day or nite cycle, this way you could actually get some benefit from the perk cards, instead of a five minute novelty let it rain for an hour. They should also change the mister sand man perk to work at nite or in inclement weather. The weather should also affect stealth...
---
I've seen this many times but not lately. General consensus is that BGS reboots servers and stops letting people join the server scheduled to reboot. You can still join via your friends.
---
We usually take over every workshop and at some point the server does crash but it takes hours. Usually.
---
Almost the same here. Damn, i miss the early days. I still remember when i had to wake up at 2 am in the morning on a work day just to get a couple of hours of BETA.
---
   Remember when legendaries were rare?  We had 400 lbs stash, no perks and you didn't see high level players everywhere? I still recall server hoping to get some power armor parts and i had no idea where to find those. Good times !
---
If only Bethesda would update the progress bar more often than once every week day...
---
Would this explain why I had like 75 at one point?
---
Just go up to someone and tell him that you want to give him money. 
---
All he has to do is build a vending machine and sell something for x amount of caps. One .308 for  1k caps, for example.
---
If we want it enough they will make us pay for.
---
I had something like that a few weeks ago. Until I died. Nobody was on the map but since I was wanted. I got killed then everybody showed up on the map. Never changed servers or anything
---
So all games based on any history of any war are "triggers" now? No way man, that's ridiculous.
---
Robot over in the cabins. If you zone in run down to the kiosk, then iinds up and to the left. There is a robot there, talk to him.
---
 only on head shots imo
---
I bought the game to explore another BGS open world and play a FOish game with my son. 
---
I keep playing (less lately) because I've met a great group of people and we have fun messing around. My son quit playing but he tends to play a game for a few months and move on.
---
Amen
---
What about mid-level players with terrible money management skills? 😏
---
Yeah very true. I always seem to miss the most obvious way around something to achieve the same result 🙄
---
Yeah 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Oh fantastic! I didn’t realize this was a thing. I’m a serial killee so this is great news.
---
Enjoyed that
---
My favorites are psychotats and berry mentats
---
Personally, I actually would prefer if they roll it out with the new legendary player system, perk loadouts and other improvements that have been promised - or rather that they introduce the new improvements first and a more polished Wastelanders-exerpience a bit later. Because I'm afraid the new expansion will bring in a lot more bugs and need for more fixes before the old ones are fixed.
---
When I first went there I thought it was a fight with no armour and only black powder weapons and we'd be given one and our uniform of choice for competing. I was very disappointed.
---
Never knew that.
---
But did you get the achievement...
---
Back before the vendors had a whole swath of plans available I used said safes to pick up various weapon plans such as the tesla rifle &amp; flamer.
---
Props man I haven't tried her on my own didn't realise she was less bullet spongy nice video I've upvoted 👍 also what chest piece you wearing if you get dense on it and the fireproof perk them sonic attacks dont do shit just an observation tho great video
---
Yeah, this is my problem with the map too. It's definitely the best yet and I love the different areas, but 90% of the locations you only visit once because once you see it, there's nothing else to do. Without NPCs, there's really no reason to visit anywhere other than a handful of places again (and most of those are due to events)
---
It's the nukashine questline. Go to any rail station and take a look at the posters. There should be one about a house party, read it. This starts the nukashine questline. Once you do this, you get a daily repeatable quest that the Biv character gives you. Eventually you will get the recipe - along with many others.
---
If your wanted I dont think you can see players on your map dude
---
I can only imagine how the tubers are waiting to see the wastelanders crash. So they can make some juicy videos and get those sexy views. I bet they are already making assets for the videos so hyped they are for seeing it fail.
---
It would be cool as hell if it would work.... But... I don't beliebe it will...it's gona be lost inventories and characters and bugs and glitches.
---
I love the game but it's a big thing to make a game like this in this scale and make it run. Expecially wheb this is a new thing for BGS. I give them credit for making even this. Making games is form of art that needs time, money and talented people. People can whine if they want but I keep supporting this game.
---
.... also add a way to share your plans/recipes across all your chars would make people feel more inclined to have other chars with completely SPECIAL-distinct builds.
---
Love this idea.
---
Only thing that makes a difference after level 50 is perk cards
---
Hey wait, the T45d and t51b have heaters right? I mean they were used in Alaska so....
---
Also it be fun and hard as hell to put a meter of cold. Like wondering in the savage divide be cold and the character can freeze to death if you exploring a cave. Food for thought.
---
Once you hit level 50 your max level in a sense as no gear levels past that but if you want your build to be as strong as possible you need to level well past 50 for the perk cards and to move skill points
---
Yup 😂. I thought I was going mad every time I logged in and I saw I had more. I made a point of noting down how many I had!
---
Gotcha thanks
---
Thanks for the tip, for the medium, is it the same method i use to get my weapon bench to not jump through the roof of the bungalow ?
---
Place it on a small rung and move it in place ?
---
I agree a Christmas the retexture would be great and maybe put Graham in a Santa outfit as well
---
Yeah I do , but my gear just breaks easy , like my shotgun breaks after like 50 shots or something, and yea mine is more geared towards pvp however I’ve gotta keep travelling pharmacy or else I’ll be a couple 100 overweight.
---
Cross play NW 🙏
---
Yeah it’s probably glitched then. I put my locks back on and forgot about it.
---
Minnesota here. It's totally ok to bbq in the snow
---
I had no time thid week :/
---
Oh boy I can’t imagine how this will turn out given the rather dubious stability of the servers for each platform individually
---
Yeah, the OP is seriously lacking information.
---
I’ll check this out! Thanks!
---
As others have said you need to fight the SBQ to reliably get scorched creatures.
---
However it appears the challenge is bugged and nothing other than scorched and SB's count.
---
My way of dealing with deathclaws on new Vegas is a antimaterial rifle with explosive bullets.
---
Yea kinda, you have to get them on a rug then move the rug, problem is the only way ive found to get them on a rug is first clip underground with a chair or something and build over to where the edge  of the water is in your area, then place a mat as far into the water as possible from that area and place the purifier ontop of that. May be easier ways but that was how i did it

My build ,i run revolvers. Can keep up with most builds because of crits. Every third shot is a crit. AA ,vats crit damage, -25% vats cost western revolver tears stuff up. I was bloodied before and switch back because it got boring 1 shotting everything, and killing sheep squatch in 5-6 hits.
---
1. Yes. 50 is max level for gear.
---
2. More perk cards for swapping between combat and crafting/CAMP, or for different weapon types, e.g. 2h-melee and heavy guns. Also, swapping SPECIAL points for when you want to change your build.
---
3. Not as far as I know.
---
Do other things, and return to the Brotherhood series when you are higher level.
---

And, if you haven’t started them, go to a train station and read the posters. It will trigger a set of side quests like tadpole, sheepsquatch ate my brother, and BIV (nukashine).
---
4 pieces of auto stim and a chameleon leg.
---
Yeah I’m still finding things after 462 hours. 
---
Quick tip, stop using fast travel, you find the weirdest of things, like a load of bears sitting at a table with guns and cigars and playing cards
---
I think CheezWong was being sarcastic here. Along the lines of 'the only way to avoid the bug is not to Play the game at all'
---
Current look of my main, He decided to stash his longcoat sometime ago
---
https://i.imgur.com/entT21E.png
---
Yep.  My main character is a shotgun build and the bug is infuriating.  I've got five legendary shotties, three of them doing over 220 damage per shot.  Yet it takes 4-5 shells to put down a mole miner due to the broken health regen.  I should be one or two-shotting those mfers.  
---
Fix this, Bethesda.  Jesus.
---
how about Pink ? is that high priced ? :)
---
We have zero info about it. Which sure makes it seem like some 35 minute quest rather than a huge patch that turns this into fallout five
---
I feel with you. I had the same happen to me with the one challenge where you had to do the path-to-enlightment-Event. And to pour an additional shitload of salt into the wound the frickin Event popped up TWO FRICKIN MINUTES AFTER THE CHALLENGES CHANGED ! I was so close to rageflip my table &gt;&lt;
---
Yeah... but to make a cross-play game, Bethesda needs resources and money to invest on it. It's not an easy thing to do. That would be nice tho
---
What are you referring to?
---

Yeah Snow! Better than rain and twisters like here.

Can we also have Christmas presents instead of paper bags?

That's what I've been using. Or 'damned bear'.

That has got to be one of my favourite fo76 pictures and sums it up pretty well, broken but fun.
---
Would santa ghoul and some mutated elves be a rare encounter or event boss?
---
Its not early in Montana for snow
---
So you don't have a source, and probably either made it up yourself or believed someone else's unsubstantiated bullshit, but you're still going to use it to attack the game because you "wouldn't be surprised"?
---
Internet in 2019 summed up right there.
---
Psychotats, Berry Mentats, Formula P
---
Just as a side note, while 50 is the max level for weapons, certain ones scale differently and are considered max level at 45.
---
Eh, console has the griefers, PC has the hackers. Pick your posion.
---
I think so. It has chem stations and the MODUS computers are only selling aid and the aid recipes, like for stimpaks, radaway etc.
---
Dont put in the chunks an greens one by one,a couple on drums and about 3/4 people gathering a pile of them and put them in at once launches the progress bar to full is my experience.even without drums we managed it like this
---
How bout high level players with terrible money management skills 😏
---
I'd recommend focusing on a melee build. Once you get to about level 30 or so you'll be able to take on higher level enemies with the right perk loadout and weapons.
---
&gt; The gameplay is basically just FO4 without interactive story
---
That would imply FO4 had an interactive story.  Yes, no, maybe (no but you can come back and say yes later), and sarcasm (a funnier option of either yes or no but you don't know which until you choose it) isn't very interactive.
---
You're in the wrong section. That's the medical bay. Come out the medical bay, turn right, then it's the last room on the right at the end of the hallway. I think! 
---
Definately sounds like you in the med bay, it's genetics lab you're after.
---
I call them Yogi Bear’s
---
Some other dude just did an awesome haunted house for Halloween. I would like to see more of those. 
---
Some kind of tree village could be cool
---
I don't think pc would be allowed to play with us consoles anyway. There's far too much difference in hardware. Ps4 and Xbox are the same pretty much.
---
Son of Fluffy is part of the quest "Unsolved: Tracking Terror". The quest can be started by reading one of the notes pinned to the map in some of the train stations.
---
however psychotats don't actually give you 15% DR, its just 15 flat DR
---
I'm not sure on weighted. But brawling dose not stack. So using one will give you the max benifite
---
Well, technically that usually comes weeks or even months after the firestorm, after the nuclear storms has caused ash and clouds to cover the skies for a prolonged time. The way the have it now, with heat and radiation, is the realistic version of what comes after the firestorm.
---
Do you mean the Petrified Corpses?
---
Those are people who have been completely consumed by the Scorch plague
---
Sometimes when entering areas with Scorched  you see them in poses like the petrified corpses, before they realise your there and move
---
Does ZAX could control the storm? I don't think so...
---
Thanks for the responses everyone. They need to fix it ASAP if they didn’t yesterday haha.
---
Great combo!
---
Yea i was trying to remember what the bug did, only remember that it affected damage. Thats why i wrote "if i remember correctly". Aaaand if you use bloodied the damage decrease will prolly be more than half. So kinda/sorta i was right xD
---
Think I’ve got a spare outfit, what do you play on?
---
Those are people who've been in the scroched plague to long.
---
The animation for that would be tough to do
---
based on other comments, the mine, mods for the tenderizer, plan for tenderizer (if thats even a drop), and the recipie for tato salad.
---
This would probably be most likely crossplay scenario, since on regular play PC has the advantage of mods, but on NW mods are disallowed.
---
For me it was always waste affix, but I've never played PvP and don't plan to.
---
No the perks are not used by the game to determine pvp damage. The damage readout in your pipboy means nothing when it comes to pvp. You can take those perks out completely and you will do the same amount of damage. 
---
You will handicap yourself for pve for sure but at least you can put some other stuff in for pvp.
---
With a big iron on your hip.
---
Well, they did just hire 20+ more people to the F76 studio, so who knows. Probably takes some time to get all the new people up to speed though, but 2020 might be a good year for us.
---
That's awesome. What platform are y'all on?
---
Not likely since the bug has been there from launch of the game.
---
I'd take Nuclear winter with a grain of salt as more akin to a vr simulation than literally burning appalachia in a ring of fire.
---
Thank you. On PC.
---
They will probably modify it for wastelanders, so it affects raiders too,
---
Ah ok so just use one of each then.
---
The +250 DR while reloading affix breaks the primary affix when you reload. You gain DR, but lose bloodied, instigating, furious, anti-armor, etc.   
---
You can avoid the bug by unequipping and re-equipping the weapon, but that's not a reasonable workaround for guns with anything but monstrously large clips.
---
I like everything but the burned texture idea. The burned textures are flat textures. It's made to be boring and cover everything in it's path as it is in the fire storm for NW, which you aren't supposed to enter.
---
In the trailer they showed a nuke on Charleston Capital and they 100% put it on such a destroyed building for the sake of making it look like nukes damaged things.
---
If it did some damage to buildings that'd be good.
---
You might want to check but isn't stings and thing's one portion of a multiple step process for one single badge?I didn't even know you could do the same quest and get multiple badges for multiple attempts.that might have been the bug itself. To my knowledge all you should get for completing those is xp,but then again I do the challenge once then turn it off and move on
---
Maybe we get lucky and we get the equivalent situation of Activision and Bungie break up but it being Zenimax and Bethesda Game Studios.
---
Yes but my main reason is for the damage bonus. Secondary is for +5 PER
---
Um trading and grinding... are you talking about survival? Well I thought they were doing something and already announced they were removing survival from the game. Anyways maybe I am reading that wrong and you are somehow talking about NW but it sure sounds like you are talking about survival.
---
We can sell ammo to the small vending machines at stations?
---
Chucking outfits on the mannequins was pretty cool tbh.
---
My favorite shots of my main 257 level character:

---
Yea dude, i wouldnt really put much weight what Bethesda claims. Do you want me to make a list of the lies they said the past 15 years?
---
This is what I do. I run one piece of zealots, mutant slayer and troubleshooter since they can all wield ranged weapons. I also use hunters for some of the heavy hitting animals like scorchbeast and Yao guai song with blocker 3 to reduce all melee damage. Lastly I use a piece of auto stim just in case, but I’m pretty hard to kill especially since I use a medics build.
---
Yes so we can enjoy PC players ;p.
---
Is that a thing? Did you test it out? What dmg perks are then calculated for pvp?
---
Hmmm, I've never seen an explosive flame. How does it work? I thought the explosive trait got removed from energy weapons
---
Yes, it really was. That was one of my favorite things from for. I had a whole shop when I built my vault, with dressed mannequins on lighted platforms.
---
I think that would be a great way to implement the ammo conversion that everyone wants. 
---
It could worknlike those machines in real life where you dump all your coins in amd get some notes in rerurn.
---
You dump your unwanted ammo into it, it values the ammo you put in, takes off a percentage for the service, and then gives you some caps. Or maybe an ammo token of some sort that can be used to buy the ammo you want.
---
Right?  My PS4 is going to catch on fire if they do this.
---
I seem to be to be able to survive better during PvP engagements with the assassins armor. So I'm not sure if it's actually beneficial or if it's just a subconscious thing and it's just as good any armor.
---
Agreed they need to buff pistols or the perk cards.
---
I'm also from Illinois and I say shush! Give us that snow and snowball "grenades"! Hell, even snow machines to turn our camps into snowy areas would be nice.
---
I thought Wendigo was part of Lowes, but opinion here says its from Southern Belle...
---
It's been too long, and I dont remember which 4 are from lowes.  
---
Quick google search says the quest is named Lying Lowe, and the rewards are
---
Yao-guai, owlet, radstag, and wolf
---
So much yes!
---
They are legacies so not available unless you got it before they took them out. They shoot bullets instead of flames. I don’t have one but I got a trade offer to pick between the aae flamer and aae plasma both with reduced weight so I’m trying to decide!
---
They have always given badges but in the past I'm sure it was 50/50 if you got one but after the fix I always got one from stings and still didn't get any for camp or toxic.
---
Now I'm not getting any.
---
It's never been multipart for me before.
---
I'd go with the plasma. You put a splitter on it and it shreds.
---
It doesn't bother me, but I can see how political and controversial it could become. That's why I think it would be a good move on Bethesda's part, to open up more modding and private servers. Just going to mean some serious engineering to make that happen.
---
I found a 2* Instigating/ explosive pipe rifle for 1500 caps in someone’s vendor once. I bought that right away since I thought that was a steal. 500 is way too low, anything with explosive is typically worth a couple thousand caps at least unless it’s a bad prefix.
---
They were working for me yesterday. My run of bad luck was earlier when you were getting one nearly every time as I was getting 1 per about 5 attempts then. Yesterday I got one badge each from both daily quests Stings and the other Operation Today one.
---
I am not a programmer or code writer so i am probably wrong but cross play would have to be written into the game during the development phase , adding it as an afterthought is a completely different challenge. It would be a good thing for the title and its longevity but i dont think it is as easy as flipping a switch
---
Good to know so I can go wild in SBQ now and Encryptid :)
---
I call them Yo Guys
---
No I mean all the trading and grinding I’ve done for all the gear I have that’d go to waste if I wasn’t to pvp
---
I LOVE all of your ideas 😍
---
A good way to get them to leave is to be in passive mode and play bad music through your headset while you just teabag and laugh. When they leave just follow them still playing the music and laughing at how pathetic they are. They usually go and bother some other server when I do that
---
Sorry, Could you explain me which is the problem? Thanks.
---
My main just reached 15 badges and my alt just finished his lead lined all since they fixed it so it definitely works
---
I'm pretty sure you gain the buff when not using the chems
---
There’s literally pink unicorn wallpaper and a princess bed along with several types of dresses, meanwhile all poor old raider me gets are weapon paints and outfits with a complete lack of camp items (cages, junk walls etc)
---
Oh I’ve already killed him without the quest
---
Take the plasma its pretty good and got cheap ammo!
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/rxj6W9X
---
Technically my secondary character but I play it more than my original main.
---
Welp too bad the game doesn't take place in Montana 😂😂
---
The one thing that needs to be added is a Power Armour stand.
---
Im sure there was one in Fallout 4 that you could power, and it lit the armour up
---
As an Englishman, I think your all bat sh*t crazy 🤙
---
Yes the pa stands were great and much needed as well
---
That is Awesome, but scary at the same time. I don't  want to say this, but I have this strange inclination that the game is slowly losing steam.
---
 I noticed this a few times over the last few weeks. Even I am starting to loose intrest at this point, and I am on the verge of hitting the 2000 hrs mark. I could be completely wrong, and let's hope I am. 
---
This is the best comment on the thread, never have truer words been spoken. One flake and the country come to a halt...
---
Yes I know and I'm grateful for that, but every week it's more raider stuff. Yea, I know its probably bc of wastelanders and it's a big part of fo but still would like to see something other than that.
---
The difference is damage, accuracy, and distance. I have both so I will tell you there are plenty of reasons to own both. At super short and long ranges you want the flamer and at medium range you want the GP. No matter what build you have, with AA being added to energy, you could even have a dense chest and 3\* fireproof, but a single volley from the GP at a target that is too close and you will gimp yourself. So, unless you like to die to mobs that charge you need something that you can still use at close range. It is up to you to decide if you just want to carry a non explosive weapon or a melee but you can still survive some hits from your own flamer and the flamer has a range up to 288 so the damage fall off starts a 288 meaning it is one of the furthest reaching weapons in the game with crazy accuracy, automatic fire, and a large magazine. So if you just want high damage then go GP especially since plasma cores are actually cheap to make for the damage they put out. If you want really good damage, range, and less risk of use then the flamer is really nice but the ammo cost is kind of high.
---
As a Queenslander, the fuck is snow?
---
I just want to be able to show off my Hellfire PA.
---
Ive even swapped from my Quantum XO-1 suit, to a Hellfire Ultracite set for the time being
---
What about just the red asylum hat? I assume it has a little value. I've had one for a while. Don't even remember where I got it.
---
Imagine if they gave players some sort of notice (assuming this is true). Makes me wonder how many server “crashes” are intended.
---
^^^ more ^^^ raider ^^^ stuff ^^^ pls
---
lol watch them charge atoms for crossplay.
---
It is because people fart in their power armor, I swear. It crashes the game every time. Bethesda needs to remove the pork and beans from the game, just saying. It would make the game more stable.
---
That's not a problem. Son of Fluffy is not an actual quest objective and more of a side note that adds flavour to the story told in that quest.
---
Oh ok
---
Fallout 3 and the Underground Hideout mod, I loved the mannequin display area, so cool.
---

I think it would be cool if they had a few "mothman events" that specifically triggered after encountering a mothman. Like being attacked by a horde of deathclaws, or a deadly rad storm coming, or being afflicted with a rare illness.
---
I had something similar happen months ago. Was alone for hours, took a workshop and suddenly the server populated.
---
Right, they announced on Sept 19 they were removing survival mode from the game. If you are talking about pvp in survival mode then they did or they are going to do something, remove it from the game. Should be in this article. https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4ZKOaWgcjj9ShSaduDeyI7/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-september-updates
---
Shit looking at it again survival should be gone by today. Who knows maybe they when back on that decision, but if not then you don't have to worry about the gear you traded for because if it is pvp gear then it is useless.
---
I tried the real trap too.  Had it way behind where the scarecrow was so it wouldn't hit anyone.  Used a tripwire so at least the first person would see it.
---
It bugged out because I made sure the power was off before I repaired it but it would just keep sparking till it broke.
---
Yes I love the hellfire paint, that and the Pink sprinkles are my favs
---
Noooooooo
---
everyone spawns with a greaser jacket pompadour wig equipped.
---
if you win, you unlock a snaping emote/pose
---
I always do a quick run for greens and cleanup waste piles and poop then stay on drums or spit, it does seem most people are obsessed with murdering small animals :D
---
Yea it’s gonna, I don’t think your grasping what I complained about
---
when can i find u on?? and i need your nickname to add u as a friend
---
Im fine with it between the consoles but i don't want crossplay with PC because of the different inputs, different settings and the hackers and modders.
---
Awesome! Thank you everyone
---
^^^yes
---
Since they are going to be supporting this game for years to come, I would love to see them add a real-world dynamic weather system where during the spring, there is more foliage, during the summer the days are longer, during the fall the leaves change, and during winter the world is covered in snow and days are shorter
---
At first it was the bugs then when this guy said just don’t pvp I was like well that makes all my hard work getting my pvp gear etc redundant
---
??? Since when?
---
IGN is same as here.. let me know when you want to meet, I can come online any time
---
I mean, the logic is irrefutable
---
They drop from this quest and a few others that are cranberry bog specific. I do believe they drop based on which ones you already know but I might be wrong there if someone else knows please chime in. 
---
They are however rare to drop. I'm not sure of the chance percentage though.
---
Yea, I only mentioned the medical supplies vending machine because they were both just there
---
Yeah I made a Minutemen/military museum with mannequins with full combat armour, BOS Combat armour, Minutemen outfits (including that one from the basement of the castle), I had track lighting on the floor looking up at each mannequin. Then I had a few weapons on racks as well.
---
The most tedious part was standing Nuka Cola bottles upright in a display cabinet because it's on Xbox lol.
---
People have vendor shops at their base
---
me too i can come online any time, right now too
---
I had the pink sprinkles up until I got the Hellfire, didnt even bother with the Inferno paint
---
I think that this would revive the game.  I have so many friends on other platforms  that wanted me to play with them, but I can't, and I am not forking out more money for another game, after what I paid for this game before launch $180 CAD. I could have bought 3 more games now,  with what I paid back then. I think Bethesda should just allow me to switch platforms for free at this point. 
---
My "Last person on the server" story: (not as exciting?)
---
I needed to take the Thunder Mountain workshop for the weekly, so I slowly make my way over there (I'm living the "Encumbered Life"), I take it, go inside because the power up event is up. I might as well try that. Couldn't figure most of it out (I repaired the cooling towers, couldn't figure out the maze to get to the other areas)...the junk loot was pretty awesome, though. Before I ran out of time I was like "Thanks, Nobody, for showing up and helping!"
---
Then I checked the map, and Nobody was actually online. Not OnePerson, but Nobody. A friend told me about farming Fusion Cores by holding the camp for a few hours. I don't like the pvp aspect of the workshops (I grab them, get my plan and run, I've had too many bad pvp experiences...I think it's dumb how a lvl 24 can one-shot a 78 in power armor...no thanks). But there's no one around to stop me from keeping this WS and just farming cores, right?
---
So I built a little walled area around the Fusion Core Processor...the first "defend" quest was Mirelurks. The worst part of this was I was at 90-something% xp and needed some unusual equipment choices, and it was a bit of work to get them down...but eventually I did. Cool, so now I've got this place locked down, I started putting turrets around my little crap shack near the processor, and some punji boards like those were going to help.
---
The next quests in the following hours were mostly Feral Ghouls. As the Fusion Cores started to stack up I just started using my laser gatling (to eat through my lower % fusion cores, even wore my power armor full time). The best parts were when the invaders got stuck somewhere or were just out of the area. It was a nice break (letting the event basically stall itself so I didn't have to worry about it). I'm afk just checking my controller every once in a while keeping myself online. Eventually built the Nuclear Material collector, which actually was a good thing because it lured some of the ghouls out of wherever they were hiding and I "awoke" to the sound of it exploding when I wasn't looking at my screen.
---
The fusion core processor generates a 100% fusion core 8 times an hour, or once ever 7.5 minutes.
---
Anyway, I held the workshop until I got kicked off for maintenance...55 cores.
---
And I'd do it all again.
---
... I'm talking about those vending machines at train stations
---
Haha inferno is cool but I like the other 2 better. Carry around both just to switch it up some days ha
---
I would love to just nuke Morgan town, point pleasant, and watoga just to see what it would look like destroyed if that was the case
---
 Agreed.  I have multiple PAs. I'd like to display one or two.
---
Oh thats awesome if they drop from Cranberry Bog quests too
---
Its 100% I do it everytime and did it today it's there first time I found it was accident second took me forever but today after maybe my 4th hop it was there and even had to wait to invite friends and show them but my friend list has grown so much that I was hopping that way today and its there I wanted to post pics didn't know how i promise its 100% guarentee. Sorry the bad luck but after me looking for red asylum dresses I definitely have the patience when it comes to server hopping lol
---
Ok I’m online
---
Nice! That's another thing I miss. Being able to decorate with everything you find.
---
 what's naughty is that you play on xb1. Boo. :)
---
Sorry, I have just realized the error. This post was intented for market, not here. My appologies. Sorry again
---
I'll delete it now.
---
Try dropping them a bag of 5.56 ammo that is 1c each, although they will probably run away screaming, that's what they do when I offer a gift.
---
They drop in a fixed order, and it generally takes upwards of 100 times of doing the quest to get them all, so that's roughly a 5% drop chance, I guess.
---
[Hey, who turned out the lights](https://i.imgur.com/8wBrKan.png)
---
If I get it again I’ll save it for you (PC)
---
Thats what I had originally hoped and honestly still wish for. But considering how much of a lag spike nukes cause when they detonate, I tried going for something more within their scope. I don't know how far the devs are willing to go and having to go and edit almost every building in the game to make a damaged version sounds taxing as hell, but heres hoping.
---
Agreed. It'd give REAL incentives to nuke outside of whitesprings. Weve seen destroyed areas in fo3 with megaton. With a games as a service style situation they have going, they could even just over time roll out new nuked models.
---
Let me guess..you're on ps4?
---
Isn’t 1 enough?
---
This. There should never be PC/Console crossplay.
---
Game is locked at 30FPS on consoles. I'm on PC and I haven't run into a game-breaking bug since last patch yet. It still has bugs, but most of them are visual or animation bugs that don't affect your gameplay.
---
Here is a post that has a spreadsheet on events and quests and the outfits it rewards. I believe all the cranberry ones on this list can drop the paint plans as well if someone can confirm this.
---

---
Playing COD or Battlefield. Playing games that don't have auto aim or guns that only need to be aimed at the ground.
---
To make it really good they'd just have to make the nuked models and special cells for all automatically recognisable areas and for most stuff like unimportant houses and and trees and stuff they just need debris #1 #2 #3
---
i'm in the world join me
---
Tato salad recipe
---
Nevermind I believe I have interpreted stuff I have read incorrectly. It appears they do indeed matter at least until you reach the cap damage of 110.
---
I've just stopped playing the game overall.
---
PS4 if you need it.
---
Yep I was waiting on friends to kill it today and scorched was wondering right up to mine but lucky even the schorchbeast that was flying way to close missed him but thank you for verifying you saw them there!
---
No plan for the tenderizer
---
Sure my psn is yopipz28
---
Do you need the jumpsuit as well?
---
Sure
---
Dude she won't bang you.
---
I can't read anything on that map.the quality is too low.
---
Can you just write a route for like 10  terminals? 
---
Like 4 at poseidon plant--&gt;lighthouse house--&gt; camp mcintosh.
---
Well i’m not on for few hours! 
---
But i will add you meanwhile! 
---
How many caps would you give for both?
---
I think Bethesda does get credit for the world they built.    I think they receive that credit in the form of people still playing this game despite all the problems with this game.     The world they built is incredible and its the only reason I do still play.     For many people they have squandered the credit Bethesda did receive for building such a world.    The bugs, missteps, and overarching poor decision making killed this game.    
---
The world Bethesda built was great.    Bethesda also spoiled it largely on their own.
---
This is a valid request.
---
Personally , my biggest want is PA displays and Mannequins as well.
---
The last few days of playing the game without being told that someone has marked a place on our maps.
---
Not looking forward to it.
---
Impossible for **mannequins from like Fallout 4** only because they don't how to code it as they used actual NPCs for mannequins so you weren't going insane when you thought they were alive. But yea they really don't know how to make it function properly without using an NPC.
---
and then for an in-game explanation on how the place goes back to how it was before being nuked could be that the enclave have special mister handys that can rebuild anything back to before it was nuked. They were originally meant for post-war repairs but due to Modus being offline, they were not able to send them out after the bombs and they only have data after reactivating Modus, so there is no prewar data to rebuild off of.
---
I wouldn’t call an instigating explosive sniper garbage though.
---
Take the plasma. I have explosive Gatling plasma and flamer. They are both nice, but the plasma damage is just ridiculously good.
---
An idea to  possibly increase the yield is for players to be able to attach nuka colas , quantums or nukashine to the warhead before launch  
---
Each with their own effects and mushroom colour
---
They are in my vendor for 500each;
---
Do you even math bro?
---
I'm wondering if this is region based too.  I have a camp on the far west side of the forest and in 200 hours I've seen at least 4 there and another 3 near Berkley (purveyor).  Other then that I haven't seen one at White Springs, which is ironic, or anywhere else other then once in the Bog during a queen fight, which was also ironic since everyone was at the drop site outside of the nuke area and the storm rolled in giving rads to everyone.
---
This would certainly help bring the community together here on 76 Reddit. Even if the games population dies down if we had Crossplay we would still have a decent sized pool of people to play with. 
---
Obviously they would  need to implement some Anti-Cheat into the PC version before it would be allowed full open access to Crossplay with consoles. 
---
It would be so cool to be able to play with my brother on the PC version from my Xbox version. I’ve got so many weapons to give him. Even if PC to Console Crossplay was Private Servers/Invite only it would still bring a lot of value.
---
Just ignore these fools, they want you to engage so they can PVP you. Most likely he is bugged and or hacking as well so he is invincible. The other day at WS I had a fool just pounding on me and he wouldnt stop so I was like sure I havent PVP'ed in a while so I waited until he got tired and ran off, I took my buffs and crouched which hid me from him. I am a stealth build and I shot him with my bloodied handmade and it did 0 damage to him after emptying the entire magazine into him. Just as I thought, he was bugged and was taking advantage of it....I just logged out at that point.
---
Just please leave PC out of it. I don't want console crossplay being the reason they decide to remove the ability to manually mod the game on PC.
---
It would also make the money wasted that I spent on a second copy on xbox to play NW without cheaters.
---
I couldn't remember if the space station was in 76 or FO4 , recently took a trip out there to see it again
---
Meh, ammo is way too easy to come by, it would devalue everything else in the game.
---
Might as well be able to sell flora.
---
The only option is to make it more rare...and who needs that.
---
Ah ok; that would be a pretty major thing other way...
---
First of all, two more people with hammers to chase bugs? Every hammer counts! Second, there's a problem with FT? How did I miss this? What's wrong with it?
---
Congrats, wow you were racking up the XP then... I have around 740 hours and I am just now 167. I agree the game still draws me in even after all we have been through!
---
No fucking way do I want crossplay with PC players.
---
Save game LORE. Stop fckn feminism🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
---
Clearly thats where they got the name.
---
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side! lol
---
🙄
---
Please, before posting anything verify your information - T-60 paintjobs can ONLY be get by finishing Forbidden Knowledge quest, NO form any other quest or event in the Bog.
---
No, they don't drop anywhere else.
---
And THAT would be scary? That would be the cutest thing ever. Bethesda! Where is my adorable sloth onesie?
---
and if we do it we get a scorched oven mitt! Yay for us! :)
---
It's about rare event outfits, not about T-60 paintjob plans....
---
Maybe I'm just seeing multiple quest you're not paying attention, I know with stings and things I had to complete it three or four times for it to register
---
I've gotten paint plans from distant thunder I thought. I did say I may be mistaken and ask for some to verify which apparently you have. Thank you for informing me how to forum though.
---
They are still buggered up, I have killed the SBQ multiple times now and mine still shows that I didnt...
---
The blocker that kicks you for mods doesn't work on the worst stuff, ironically, and reporting people for using aimbots doesn't seem to do anything to get them banned.
---
Here is the order they drop:  Initiate, Knight, Knight CPT, Knight SGT, Knight Officer, Paladin, Elder. To get next you have to learn previous. Chances are very slim, but it's RNG. I've completed my collection when I was around LVL 207, finishing that quests 200+ times at least.
---
Up to and including your whole build... I got a random pistol from her that I fell in love with. Next toon? Pistols. Not all that powerful, so I get to pick something to go with it!
---
I killed a scorched Mr Gutzy...thought it was stupid that a robot became scorched but oh well
---
The pvp community is pure cancer. I had a guy bait me with a message, wanting to get some cores from the Poseidon workshop. After I was done with the event I was in, I went there to grab some cores for him, but he was hiding and used TPP to blindside me. 1 punch and I was dead from the broken and absurdly overpowered bloodied build. He stole my junk, griefed the place, then left. They're probably the most toxic community in gaming. Even worse than rust.
---
Works fine on Forza and War Thunder.
---
And probably others that I don't know about.
---
No, from Bog missions you can get plan for PA pieces (leg, torso, etc) for T-51 and T-60 and plans for mods for those PAs. But not paintjobs.
---
Yeah, there is a bug with damage registration on server. If you in sneak, but someone around you is not, then no additional sneak damage
---
yes it does, if someone purchases your items you get nothing for it....
---
Thanks for the info
---
Got mine with the SBQ
---
I put away my shotgunner character until they fix it. This has to be one of the most serious bugs to fix, like, urgently.
---
Apparently you did not read. I said it's a list of outfit rewards but I was stating I thought the paint plans dropped from the same events listed for that region on that spreadsheet.
---
Great story,the dude sounds like alot of fun lol
---
I'm on PS4 and it seems broken. I've gone from a badge each time I did stings to nothing. I'm got most of the plans but it looks like I've got to go and take a photo of a mirelurks ass from a distance while wearing a clown outfit etc to complete the challenges instead.
---
If your still getting them it sounds like I'm just having shitty luck on the events. I can deal with that, thanks for the info.
---
As an Ohioan you do not want snow
---
Very true, it's already hard to find people willing to trade in caps anymore and I fear being able to sell ammo will make it worse.
---
No, they have different amounts of resistance, no NPC atm is wearing armor especially not legendary armor, as asked here.
---
You think you've got it bad ? Enclave player here. Bethesda seem to not want my money &gt;&lt;
---
I mean yeah, that’s basically what I’m saying. It’s just disappointing that my favorite game decided to essentially get rid of what I like to do and how I like to play.
---
It’s sort of a slap in the face, I mean I have almost 2000 hours logged and have been playing since before the BETA and here we are. PvP has just gotten continuously worse and worse and less and less fun. 
---
I want to play another game, but this was the perfect game for me and now it’s not. I wish, if they were going to remove survival, they would at least do something to replace it
---
If I'm honest, I would mostly want the backpack for all the great skins. And that's probably weird. I'll get there. First to get finished is Mistress of Mysteries, though. I tried at level 20 and got CRUSHED. 😂
---
I was running Treadly and Pompy getting a badge every other day...then it stopped about 3 days ago haven't gotten one...haven't seen campfire tales pop up in over 2 weeks
---
I don’t know either. Exactly my point. Maybe I’ll go build a cool house or something at a workshop until a Stealthboy’d Tesla player comes and attacks and I lose interest. Very disappointing

Why not bloodied? Nerd Rage and all that?
---
Really? I'm pretty sure I picked them up off some random counter in a hardware store or something. Guess I should probably hold on to them, then!
---
Spent about 10K on mine.  Not recommended though, explosive is crap for sniping.  Not that it's *bad* exactly, just not worth spending anything extra for the explosive part.
---
I’d take weapon artisan out and swap it in when needed same with lockpicking skills gives you a few extra points to maybe raise endurance so you have more health.
---
NW is just not my flavor. I like the RPG elements involved with just normal PvP, it’s a lot more personal.
---
It’s why I play a fallout game.
---
I’ll echo the sentiment that something changed, not sure it’s broken though.  I too was getting a badge per shot of operation tidy (btw you stupid robot I’m not a possum anymore).  Last 4 times nothing.  Could be it was set to 100% before and they toned it down to some chance.  I’m 0/4 right now, hopefully my luck turns around.
---
I have no idea why you link to the topic that was about outfits rewards when OP asked about paintjob plans and in that topic there was literally no word about T-60 paintjob plans. And why you presume those plans drops from those events? Just because? I'm sorry, but it's an exemplary situation "I have no idea about the answer, but I post something anyway", which usually kinda irritates me...
---
There should be an option at least
---
I am almost certain I got a reply of “Check Martin” I saw my notification and half of his response to my message.. however I now come on the app and there is no reply?😭 did he delete his reply to me?
---
Im pretty sure they could implement it
---
They’re items literally anyone can get, in survival legendary items had a marginal difference. And honestly, a non-legendary railway rifle was better than 90% of the legendary weapons available.
---
And a marsupial serum is 300 caps out of most player vendors.
---
Your complaints are stale
---
God thank you!
---
This post should reach a million upvotes.  Do not lump us console folks in with PC until the PC cheating issues are fixed, which appears to be never.
---
They need to rework the engine for that, and that was the initial cause, not because "sony doesn't support it for all titles". Excuses.
---
I havnt seen one myself, and honestly there would be a lot of guess work and theories involved
---
Ive done solo runs of each week to fully explore the place, and only found a few terminal entries and holotapes, there isnt nearly enough lore to piece together a full picture of the vault
---
I mean, I’m glad you understand. They go to this subreddit for suggestions. But it’s just a bunch of bitter people who don’t PvP making suggestions for people that do.
---
There are a lot of MMO games with PvP communities. Imagine if one of those games just methodically deleted everything PvP related until it was just left with pretty much nothing. People would leave, and I just wish I didn’t have to. But it’s just so boring for us now
---
I guess it puzzles me since this isn't a game you CAN win, minus Nuclear Winter. Now, I haven't played NW (can't hit the broad side of a scorchbeast without VATS), but I swear you pick up your gear from the map as you go, yes? So, it would just take away the early struggle.
---
I guess what it comes down to is that I started playing after my husband did, so I didn't have to struggle the first time. So... my husband is pay to win? lol
---
I saw a herd of Radstag go crazy the other day in the Toxic kill 2 Yao Gaui and 3 Scorpions...for some reason they all started chasing me and when I say all there was at least 20...idk what's up with them lately they are more violent then I remember
---
Lol

So... you're dead? That's truly unfortunate. We'll miss you!
---
Shame, I really like the vault 94 interiors and hoped for some fascinating stories hidden in terminals, holotapes and notes :(
---
I linked it as a cross reference for the events for BoS rewards. Just trying to be helpful. Forgive me for being kind and trying to help. I'll just never try to help on here again as I'm clearly stupid in your eyes and do not want to cause you anymore irritation. 
---
On a side note, I just looked and I know how to craft 3 of these paints. I never turn in technical data......not sure how I got the plans then. Can you link me to something with the correct proof of these paints so I can be as smart as you are please.
---
I just tested this.  When crafting at the weapon bench the cleaver's damage is 60 but in the pip boy it is 75.  Turned damage numbers on and threw both at some enemies and sure enough, they do the same amount of damage.  I guess the cleaver is just bugged and displays it's damage incorrectly when crafting.
---
Only reason I can imagine why it takes so much more material to craft is that since its bigger it has a bigger hitbox and can hit its target easier.  I don't know how to test that though other than to just use both of them a lot and guess.  Even if that is the case it still doesn't seem worth it based on how much more it costs to craft.
---
I was thinking Assassins gear/weapons would be pointless now with Survival shut down, but then this..lol
---
OTOH, nearly every location does exist IRL, even if out of place.  Some are under different names, but they are there.
---
Tyler Fairgrounds (IRL: Arthur Boreman Elementary School)
---
Wade Airport - (IRL: Yeager Airport), 
---
Posiedon Power Plant (IRL: John Amos Power Plant)
---
Monongah Power Plant (IRL: Harrison Power Station)
---
TNT Domes may be Mounds, WV
---
Grafton Dam may be Tygart Dam IRL
---
(yea, sometimes I have too much time on my hands.)
---
It's been said that if you purchase a higher tier plan and learn it, forbidden knowledge will only drop the next one in the sequence.  So please beware that you could prevent yourself from learning others by accident if you skip ahead.  Also.  Initiate paint was removed from the game at the same time they added the rest of the paint plans, so that one is "legacy" and can no longer drop in-game.
---
I suppose I could learn the stacking foundations trick. And there MUST be a trick. Adjusting them for my current split level was annoying AF. It would feel like a bunker, which could be very cool. Fort JENNSAUN!
---
Role players! 
---
Yes! 
---
I want to have a Clan/Cult; 
---
I already built the “Sanctuary” of the Meetings; 
---
I’m working on the missions and the evolution of my quests; 
---
Please let me know if you would like to come to an early meeting of the Cult.
---
On the subject of the order the paints drop in, I got Officer first about 3 months ago, and after maybe 30  additional Technical data drops on the same character I just got Sgt paint last week. It seems the order is random to me. 
---
In terms of total, I’ve dropped well under 100 tech data and have two paints, so RNG has been favoring me I guess. (For once)
---
The feeling is mutual.
---

---
The only 2 holos ive found, are the Vault 94 Council Recording, and the GECK Recording
---
I never wrote you're stupid, but spreading false information (like you've done) isn't helping, but makes confusion and require correction.
---
If you never done the quest you could've buy plan from players vendor.
---
I always feel so defeated when this bug happens like you one shot an mob and think ok on to the next and their still there full hp like you just meleed them with the butt of your gun
---
Just imagine the servers for 76 trying to remember all the item locations lol.
---
I can't speak to 76 in particular, but as long as the game base is the same for all systems (same world), and the controls are already set up for each (which it has to be, since all 3 are supported individually), the actual code to put all 3 on one server is actually rather simple.
---
There was another online game I read about a while back, the devs said the code could be implemented in an afternoon.  Nothing is ever 100% the same, but the basic functionality of crossplay isn't hard. at all.
---
2 things holding it back. Competitive play isn't even between controller and keyboard/mouse, so for NW there might still need to be separation.  That, and I have no idea the cost - Sony will allow crossplay, but do they let you do it for free?  I haven't read anything that states one way or the other.
---
Unlike a lot of folks who hold lore as sacred gospel, I’m completely fine with altering some lore if it allows for something even cooler or better for gameplay.
---
I suppose the "easiest" fix for accidentally skipping one, would be to start a new character.
---
However if theyve removed the Initiate paint, would that prevent the paints from dropping at all, or would it start at the next paint?
---
Might depend on your build.  (Melee with 15 base points in str + extr str from armor, etc.)
---
Cleaver is rated 75+ dmg when equipped.
---
Ha ha

Here is a published benchmark, 1080ti 69 fps + at 4k ultra, so not just me.

Ahh thanks for the heads up. I've gone from one each stings and things to nothing and that did seem excessive but I'm glad your getting the RNG luck now. I'm level 206 and I just want to finish all the plans and never speak to those poxy scout robots again.
---
I wear power armour all the time.... I don't even use the backpack that much.
---
Think the grind is getting to me...
---
nope
---
Have my upvote for making me literally laugh out loud. Fantastic!
---
Morgantown Airport and trainyard
---
It's not that I am 'against' it. But it's silly to use the past games that held to old lore standards vs a game that chose to do its own thing. My comment is neither positive or negative, simply factual.
---
You do realize that fallout is not very stable when a nuke drops , I’m just concerned that a nuke like what your describing would cause server crashes especially if your trying to nuke the queen
---
Noooope. Hundreds of queens and No achievement yet.
---
Again, just trying to help kindly which you don't see a lot on this forum. After this run in with you I can see why somone might be hesitant to reply and try to help someone for fear of someone being a dick to you. I did state I could be wrong and asked someone else to chime in if they knew better, which you do obviously.I'm 99.999% confident I've never bought plans for BoS paint as I do not even like the BoS style. I do not recall ever seeing someone sell them in their machine. 
---
Now it is possible I picked them up in a bag back in the day when we use to just drop our known plans for other people. I do not recall that though but that was many many months ago.
---
I like it. Maybe make it a second dwelling like in GTA you can have multiple.
---
If you don't have any explo GP, you'd probably better take GP, if only for that ridiculous, out-of-this-world dmg output. If you do however, take that AAE flamer, it's one of the most satisfying and fun weapons to use in F76.   
---
The thing with explo GPs is that they are so OP (and dangerous even to you) that after a while you'll feel certain numbness when using them. If you ever played Morrowind and became flying immortal omnipotent god - that's the feeling, cool for a while, boring in the long run. Though I'm not saying it doesn't have its own appeal.  
---
As an example, in PvP I only take out eGP when fighting against opponent with the same weapon, teslaboys or squad of 4; it's just not fair and fun against "normal" opponents. AAE Flamer is always on favorite wheel, though.
---
Biggest issue is that pistols have always had perks that made vats better... That doesn't translate well here
---
What platform are you on? I don’t have a cultist character.. but I’m sure well someone could be “turned” 😂
---
At least have an afterimage as a punishment for looking at the nuke directly.
---
I don't blame you. That's awesome! I usually do the defend quests... dropped in sneak so no one knows I'm there. I'm curious: what do you mean by unusual equipment choices?
---
Unyielding Bos powered combat chest piece. Don't have the dense plan for combat armour even after numerous server hops at watoga. 
---
I only have 2 endurance and run rejuvenated most of the time. Really don't mind dying at queen fight. In a group it's easier to stay alive as she focus's on others.
---
The man from the future is here.
---
it just starts at the next paint, no worries there. yeah correct, you could start a new character to farm the earlier ones if need be. It's just a bit of an uphill climb to reach the join the brotherhood again.
---
Savage.
---
Took me a while the first time but with practice you can get it down to 15-20 minutes.
---
Damn str8 its fricking VA
---
You can complete the game:
---
1. without the atom shop items you reference. 
---
2. without legendary 3\* god tier weapons and armor. 
---
3. without consuming performance enhancing foods, bobbleheads, chems, etc.
---
and better yet, enjoy the heck out of it at the same time.
---
I had no issues on PC a few weeks back making mine.....
---
I had a similar issue that I couldn't get the "clean up kiddie corners cabin" quest from scout leader Pompy for ages, ended up contacting the Bethesda's customer support and logging a ticket. They reset the quest for me, and actually had the exact problem you're having with Jaggy but it fixed itself after relogging in.
---
Blizzard of fire .right?
---
Would be nice to see some full servers for a change
---
You think Zenimax would let go of all their property like that? Bethesda holds all the IPs Zen makes money off of
---
I would like to add you IGN Janynfletcher
---
Thanks...Jay
---
Oh yeah it would be a little bit of a struggle
---
I have got a level 50 or so Char that i havnt touched the main quest line on yet.
---
Thought it might be a good idea to wait for wastelanders to drop so i can experience the main quest again
---
I understand, but as I play this game since December and spend 1800+ hours, I haven't heard anyone claims to have 3 T-60 paintjobs from Bog quests...
---
PS4;
---
PS4!
---
Yeah I'm wondering if the one badge for  each time was broken and they have changed it back but I'm in double figures now on stings and no badges and since the fix I've never got a badge from campfire or toxic.
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
Except we get NPCs next month, so maybe, if we're good?
---
Hey. I haven't looked at the game files for these but you can get a wide range of weapon plans from safes including DCG, power fist, gauss etc
---
Oxhorn does one, but it's kind of a cheat one because he uses someone else's footage. It's quite in depth, though
---
Personally I wouldn't like going toe to toe with someone on PC while I'm on ps4.
---
Drops are shit...The only ways you will get something nice in this game are to save script and take your chances with Murmur or buy it a player vendor. In over 700+ hours and hundreds of SBQ runs and other event runs I have NEVER gotten anything great from them....
---
Real seasons in game would be awesome.
---
Ahh so it may not be me... Thank you.
---
But yea, I'm the same. Never plan on playing nw, but still need to know every bit of lore that is available ha!
---
PC
---
There’s nothing at all strange about that inclination.
---
Smite just added crossplay across all platforms, but in the settings you can choose console only, I think this is the best solution.
---
Realy? I've checked his channel, as I watched his V51 lore video (which also wasn't his footage, but it doesn't matter, as I listened to it, not watched), but I couldn't found V94 related. Can you link it me?
---
I have mixed feelings about this. I would love mannequins (as someone pointed out, we will probably have to wait until after Wastelanders, since evidently they're based on npcs). I have concerns about other "girly" stuff. With the stuffies, the princess bed (in pink!), the pink unicorn wallpaper... when Bethesda tries to do girly, some of it is a real eye sore. Saw a camp with the pink wallpaper on the outside yesterday. *cringe*
---
Actually the radiation danger is all the radioactive debris raining back down after the initial explosion. The shockwave also does a fair bit of damage too. I am not sure where the ring of fire fits in with nuclear detonations, but i enjoy it.
---
I get what you are saying, there is a bug, it effects pvp, specifically it effects survival mode, you are saying it should be fixed, they removed the game mode, so they kinda did fix the bug. It is not the fix you wanted, hell it does the one thing that probably makes your blood boil and completely shits on your effort to grind out a pvp specific build and gear, but nonetheless for now the solution to fixing pvp tied to your adventure mode character is to simply remove it. Maybe someday they will bring back Survival mode but I think the entire idea is to not offer that game mode again till all the current gear that is available for trade is made obsolete by whatever we are getting in Wastelanders, but maybe I am wrong. Oh well either way RIP your and my pvp characters.
---
Man it occurs more often on survival cause more pvp occurred but really it occurs just as often
---
I will if you are PS4. But do I need a mic or can I be a silently lurking zealot? We can always just pretend that my tongue was cut out as part of a blood sacrifice ceremony. :-) Because I don't suppose that giving big, jolly waves and thumbs up emotes is in the spirit of things, is it?
---
It is not a guaranteed drop from those events/quests but still fairly common at 50%. I'm not sure if it is a bug or intentional but there is no pop-up for receiving badges at the moment so the only ways to check are your collections tab and the vending machines themselves.
---
Not bad. I have more hours logged than you :p 
---
But as a bit of comic I grabbed a technical data and turned it in to see what kind of rewards I can get for this as I never really cared much to do it before. On my first try I got a paint plan. 
---
So I go find another piece of technical data, turn it in and get the SAME plan again! Two returns in a row gave the same plan! How's that for karma lol.
---
That’s roughly a 1% drop. And I can confirm it lol it takes a long time
---
This is the Shotgunners curse, I still play mine but it does truly hurt a fun build in the long run.
---
I thought they misspelt ‘finishing.’
---
Drop him some missiles, at this rate the poor guy should be running dry soon......
---
I think you mixed with his V51 video (so did I and realised as I was gonna search up video for 94)
---
Yeahhh, no worries!
---
No, I had more than 150 steampacks  in my inventory. Thought to sell half, but people don't even take for 6  caps.  I had to throw them near new player camp. He was pleased, I hope...
---
If I could play with my friends who have it on Xbox and Playstation it would be a gamechanger for me. I don't know anyone else who has it on PC, but I don't own an Xbone or PS4 so, I have to play with randos. Which... is why I still haven't launched a nuke and finished the main quest.
---
Damn, I bet you cant wait until its 76 outside.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I would prefer more gritty and realistic things to wear and build my camp with.  This is the Apocalypse after all.
---
Ah my bad... I thought you were talking about a nw lore vid! Sure it will only be a matter of time before he does a raid vid... although, it will probs be other peoples footage again, because his build seriously sucked last time I checked ha!

My character is a deranged priest who splintered off from the Mothman Cult to worship all the Cryptids as a pantheon.
---
Yea I've just realised ha
---
That could be cool. Give the option if your camp can't be placed to to take up a room in the apartment. Every apartment could be identical layouts so all it would have to load in is your decor. They could allow for maybe like 16 extra people on the sever this way since there wouldn't be a ton of camps to load in.
---
You can make healing salves, which will be used if you're out of stims. You can get all the materials you need in the Forest Region. Same healing, just instant instead if a burst and then HoT. You can also turn tick blood into stims, and use super duper and chemist perks to increase your yield.
---
Look through some of the groups on /r/fo76factionshub or /r/FactionBoard76.  I ran into the BoS Appalachian Chapter on PC running an operation in the Mire, and it was an impressive sight. I believe they're a cross-platform group.
---
Why don’t they fix their game first
---
well crap so I redesigned my camp last night and moved my machines into a room with a garage door connected to a switched line because I thought only I controlled the switch. So now it sounds like I just need to scrap the power line to that room when I want to power them down when I am max caps....
---
Agreed, I've decided to hide under the of free states until such time as Beth decides they want my atoms.
---
Okay cool!
---
Will do :P
---
The Bobby Hill comment made me laugh out loud. Imagine showing Bobby around the wasteland... I can picture it perfectly
---
They should use those textures when someone nukes a place.
---
I tried soloing the queen the other day with my Prime Hunters Gatling Plasma.  The event was up when I logged on, but nobody was there and it only had 11 minutes left.  She was full health when I started, I got her down to the first 50% and she healed at around 6 minutes left.  Got her down to about 50% left when time ran out.  Burned through probably 12 full prime plasma cores.  The biggest issue was the extra mobs staggering me and the queen not wanting to land a few times.  I realized after the fight that I forgot to put on Stabilized, I'm thinking with the full time I could solo her, if I had one or two people killing the extra mobs I'm positive I could take her down...
---
Everytime I get the alert I try to witness the impact and I try to see the shroom from the distance and it disappoints me a bit. If additional effects affect server performance too much that's fine and I personally don't need them but gimme my shroom!!! &lt;3
---
With all those patches Bethesda done since the premiere they've messed with this quest many times and I no longer know if something isn't wrong again. First, it was only initiate plan, nothing else. Then they've introduced other ones, but some patches later broke initiate (with un-learning it from some players). By that time I was able to collect all up to the elder, but couldn't craft initiate, so bought a plan for it again and learn-back. Like two patches ago they've changed the look of Elder - now it's a Sentinel, that was removed from the game entirely and was only available from dev room...
---
You don’t need the armor. Just jump up and down and pull the trigger. They don’t call it a cheese cannon for nothing.
---
That is what they want.
---
I've seen his raid vid (with 3 other YTers), but as far it was fun to watch, it wasn't lore video I'm looking for.
---
How is that feminism?
---
Oh I got the Wendigo I just forgot to post it.
---
I'll have to look to see if that option is in their Paladins title as well.
---
cool ill add you later today when i get home
---
When you play, do you stay on one server the whole time or hop around a lot? I've found that some servers are just plain luckier than others. I constantly hop servers and test them. Do an event, hit up my regular farming spots, find a legendary. See what it drops. If it's anything close to being good I keep going on that server. If not, off I go.
---
If I get some really good drops like explody guns or top tier melee weapons I hit up the purveyor and blow through whatever scrip I have. Quite often she will give me something worth selling and sometimes I get something worth keeping.
---
As an example last night I looted a 2 star bloody pole hook and a two star unyeilding piece of armor. Hit up the purveyor and she gave me an exterminators explosive lever action and an anti armor, faster fire rate gatling gun. Couple days ago she handed me an anti armor explosive combat shotty after I looted a quad explosive 10mm from uranium fever.
---
The one that says "Trading not allowed"
---
I just throw them at randos post meat cook (in passive mode)
---
Interesting. Well now I have 2 of knight captain paint lol.
---
You described NW essentially. They should expand the game modes for it, capture the flag, king of the hill etc. I hate the PvP in this game. I have perfect gear for it, but it's like you said. Either I totally mop most people, and with others geared like me it's pretty much a stalemate. There is hardly any skill base in it. Then, if you do beat someone, they just pop a stealth boy and pull out a Tesla rifle.
---
You are right, it's no middle. Its either just ok to pass or over the top.
---
Sure feels like they abandoned ship 8 months ago. Just a bunch of try hard fans with rusty buckets trying to keep the ship afloat.
---
Pink and purple things in post-apocalyptic world-it is feministic madness)) The author should play barbie, there are a lot of pink and purple
---
I like the game a lot but I struggle to justify my time playing after lvl 50.
---
Waiting on Wastelanders though.
---
Oo can we?
---
I just want to be able to do something with the rounds I don't need. I was wondering what to do. I'm pretty new with lvl 45 so I got a lot to learn.
---
If we can't sell them can we scrap them?
---
Yea yea
---
Actually I hope Bethesda talks to Sony as little as possible. If they get too chummy we’ll start seeing PlayStation exclusive Atomic Shop items and events. Seriously, I’m getting sick of Sony paying game envelopes to withhold content from other platforms. Wanna play that sick new mission in Monster Hunter? Too bad, Sony bought it for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Want to play the new game mode in Call aid Duty? Oops, looks like Sony payed for exclusive rights to it. I’ve never been much for the console wars thing, I enjoy both of them and pc, but Sony has resorted to some Lex Luther Mark Zuckerberg bologna. 
---
Everyone knows Sony is only starting crossplay because of community backlash. Don’t be surprised if they resort to buying up half a game’s content as “exclusive” to try to screw over the competition.
---
I am well aware of how unstable it is. This is more or less just a wishlist of things I'd like to see improved in regards to Nukes. They're the ultimate weapon in the franchise yet they feel lackluster. I'd love to see stuff like this as long as stability and performance isn't affected. Stability should never be sacrificed for visuals.
---
Youre acting as if all of a sudden the nukes destroyed all the feminine stuff that was there BEFORE the apocalypse and left nothing of that alive, that's not how it works you incompetent incel worm lmao.
---
Honestly, the plans should be available at venders and not up to chance.(note I never found it, and had to buy it from a player)
---
Thanks, I appreciate it! I'm just a lover of all things Nuclear so I'm just voicing what I see as necessities!
---
Give it a couple of months and I’m sure Oxhorn will have something.
---
Or Junk Walls? I'd like Junk Walls.
---
As a server begins to degrade they first freeze new people from joining the server.  Then (and I don't specifically know the exact number) when the server population drops below a threshold you will get a server shutdown message.
---
There have been many times we noticed the server getting wonky and the number of camps dwindling to it's just my discord group and one or two others.  I will hop servers to find a new one where we can all place our camps and the second I leave my friends get the shutdown notice.
---
I bought the Bone Armour PA when it initially came out, but glad it’s come back for those whom missed it first time around.
---
I currently have a low-level alt character, so when I get to the Garrahan’s Mining mission, I can snazzy up my Excavator PA up. Gonna mix and match it with the Raider Scabber / Waster skins too!
---
There are a few bugs that I still regularly encounter: 
---
1. There's still too much lag when you interact with terminals and quest items.
---
2. You still run into goo-piles where people slagged enemies, who therefore won't respawn. 
---
3. You can still hard-lock when exiting power armor, but less often than before. 
---
4. The +250 DR while reloading legendary effect still turns off the primary affix. 
---
Aside from that, my experience is pretty bug-free. I haven't had the queen fly off in months. Freezes or crashes to desktop are rare. Most quests work as expected. It's no longer in such a state that I would call it a buggy game.
---
YES - I have PS4 only friends I want to play with!
---
Maybe all those high priced atom items!
---
It’s all a chance sadly. 5% I believe(?)
---
Yeah and I think NW is a good game mode but it strips too much away. I like it but really I do still want to play the base game. I still want to go out with a group of friends and set up ambush points, drop nukes on bases, and laugh when a random super mutant finds that guy trying to sneak up on you and lets out a "FOUND YOU!" battle cry alerting you to an idiot that is now going to have to fight you and a super mutant. 
---
I want all the changes i listed but I also really want adventure and survival to not be linked. Survival needs a good old fashioned gear wipe and maybe it need semi annual gear wipes to fix the stat of things after a ban wave and such. I play other games that have seasonal gear wipes and I actually like earning back my gear.
---
That sounds cool, post some pics when u do would like to see.
---
what happens if you know them all (the paints) and keep turning in tech data? do the plans still drop, random order, not at all? 
---
I havent grinded the quest with my character that knows all paints, just turned in some data occasionally when I pass by. Would be interesting to know if I could get copies to sell.
---
I’m pretty sure that the plasma thrower actually uses the commando perks, as it’s treated like an automatic weapon, not the rifleman perks
---
What clothes is you character wearing?
---
I have no idea what people are still finding to do in this game. I thought I would be playing it for a while but the updates take fucking forever and never add any real content.
---
Well then BSW would have to split as well and that’s not happening anytime soon
---
Awhile ago, someone put together a review and video comparison of all the TSE heavy weapons, which is largely valid for AAE as well: 
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgu6va/massive\_test\_of\_tse\_heavy\_ts\_explosive\_weapons/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgu6va/massive_test_of_tse_heavy_ts_explosive_weapons/)
---
I just answered from my own perspective and those are weapons I used in pvp in the past. Before survival was shut down but after they made the change to cap damage at 110 it was pointless to have a bloodied build when a lot of weapons could hit the 110 cap without needing bloodied. Why make yourself a soft target with a low hp pool when you could tank 1-3 shots with a full hp bar and still have the same damage output? 
---
Now if we are talking pve then personally I would choose junkies over both AA and bloodied just because it is so damn easy to get high damage with any build with a junkies weapon so what is even the point of making a squishy character. Either way it does not matter because OP asked a very specific question so I focused specifically on that because I had experience with that exact same situation.
---
Sweet! I’ll check it out
---
Crossplay is much easier to implement if the game is designed with it in mind. I love this game but it is not robust enough to support crossplay, not without a marked improvement in multiplayer functionality. I'd rather them be working on getting Wastelanders the best it can be. 
---
After that? It's a possibility I guess. Not sure Bethesda will bother given this is a spin off game and they have other titles to work on.
---
I have 7 of one and 9 of the other in my vending machine on PC, so I've dropped prices to somewhere between 45 and 95 caps. I cannot recall, but they aren't priced at a premium.
---
You know, as ridiculous and outlandish as that sounds, I could totally see that happening in Fallout.
---
Does this now include minecraft? I know minecraft on ps4 isnt compatible to play with other bedrock editions. Not sure if its on Sonys end or Mojang
---
Are you talking adventure mode or Nuclear Winter?
---
What is it with people buying this game and then posting on this subreddit asking whether to play it?
---
Adventure. Sorry thought I put that in. Edited it thanks.
---
I find dozens everywhere I go... 1400 caps selling a day of anything you have should net you enough to buy them from player vending machines which will tell you as you hover over them if they have them for sale.
---
That's an odd logical progression.
---
All around? .50 cal. Best balance of damage, accuracy, ammo consumption and lack of spin-up. Gatling is runner-up for value ammo use.
---
Yeah dude if u watch the ground or in a building u can get more than 60 fps, go in a scorch beast queen event and show me ur 60 rock solid when 10+ more players are in the same place. Anyway good life dude i don't care what u are thinking is just that, I've tried it.
---
I like your style. Tips on songs? I might just start singing. That'll make them run! lol

They do sales every so often, you could hold out till wastelanders, they might do a sale to attract more players, physical and digital prices vary because it’s up to individual retailers to set their own price, they buy the product at a set price and then they can sell it for however much they wish, they drop price when they have to much of the product and there isn’t enough demand for it so they try to empty their inventory
---
I was able to get my copy for $15 USD, and upgraded to the Tricentenial Edition for a total of $40, back in November/December. They occasionally have sales like that, so just keep your eyes out. It might be higher right now because Wastelanders is about to drop.

Non-legendary Gatling guns kill most enemies in 1-2 shots, Bloodied Gatling guns kill 1-2 enemies in 1 shot.
---
I sure would love PC/Console cross play for co-op. I wouldn’t want to use it for competitive though.
---
Ah, gotcha. Didn't think of that for some reason. I know someone who is working on pulling the lock status out now and hopefully it can be added to that map.
---
I think it'd be less helpful to put them in the train stations -- then it's simply another stash.
---
I am a programmer, and what I'm thinking is you could have the backing data store for this be a little more offline than what is normally used for your regular gear.  Then when you go retrieve stuff, you won't notice the lag as the robot "goes to find your box" -- that's the server pulling your secondary stuff from slower storage.
---
While that would make things more challenging and keep things fresh, they aren't ever going to do it. It wouldn't make them more money, and that's their only driving factor for this game right now. They care about profita and that's it.
---
yeah Im sure this strikes a bad cord with some players as it was all they did in game.....
---
I was JUST about to write a post about this...
---
It's a real issue in this game. I started a new toon a few weeks ago to focus on shotguns because I'd landed a QE Double Barrel that I just had to put to use. I quickly retired the shotguns because of this damage bug and switched him to heavy/1 handed builds (PA Heavy that can also go no-PA stealthy ninja). 
---
Well, yesterday I was out tooling around with "Leon", my sweet little legendary switchblade and noticed the same bug with fast one-hands. I'd snick right into some low-level mob that should EASILY be 1-hit, clearing up scorched and doing my duty, and there'd be no damage recognition. I'd have to hit these buggers 2 or 3 times before damage would be recognized. RIDICULOUS.
---
With my medium speed 1-hand or my other toon that uses a super-sledge, I can 1 hit lvl 68 super muties. So when I can't 1 hit lvl 1 scorched due to the damage not being recognized, there's something definitely messed up there.
---
I would love to play my PS4 Character on PC   that is truley all i want. as i started on PS4 but want to do it on PC just not start all over.  Give me that at least.
---
A full set gives you a 75% chance to avoid 45% damage and doesn't have specific conditions like cavs and sentinels. So prob is helping more then you think.
---
I know but he is one of the better lore YouTubers. I don’t know many other lore youtubers that are still around, Most got out after fallout 4, while others just kinda moved their video content away from lore.
---
With stabilizer, all heavy gun perks, demolution expert and tank killer.. nice setup.
---
I ask you again what purpose of this stuff in game?) It is not fallout barbie edition) I dont imagine about what stuff nukes destroyed, I just think that pink stuff breaks game ambient
---
They would need to add a penalty to people that alt+f4 in combat and that is a big ask. I love the idea of separating the game modes but just doing that does not stop someone from hitting the I quit button and finding a different server if they think they are going to lose.
---
More details in my reply above, but I see it as being able to have two storage backing services, and they don't need to load up the secondary stuff until you go ask the robots for your box.  Then, you are also not PO'd as it takes a little longer for the robots to retrieve it.  You keep the performance by keeping your current build/load size the same, so it is very similar to a mule, except without a player slot being taken up.
---
How so?
---
Forza does a constant revolving live cycle of the seasons. All 4. Bethesda should be able to do one lol
---
MARTHA!!!
---
I think I would prefer more tank build, I feel better knowing I can fight if I have to rather than rely on a KO. Thank you for the feedback.
---
No worries. 
---
I own both.  I prefer to play on the console for its simplicity at times but let me tell you. The pc is beautiful, max settings , capped at 75fps and it blows me away.  Oh and  load times - almost as fast as a console respawn at an event. If I was on pc and my buddy on PS4 , I would be loaded in and miles away before they spawned. 
---
The fact I’m using my same login on Bethesda and yet my console characters can’t be used here is crap. This is why I’m excited to destiny on PC but using the characters I’ve spent hundreds of hours creating on PS4. 
---
Now I’m o-k in PvP in destiny but pit the platforms against each other - yikes.
---
&gt;Bethesda needs resources and money
---
I think they're fine.
---
Man those prices are sad.
---
All 4 of my machines are filled with plans, everything is priced at game value, except jet packs which are 500 caps, and then rare plans are a bit higher. They don't always sell right away but if I leave them in there eventually someone shows up and starts clearing me out. There's always that one person that wants all the plans.
---
Tank killer effects heavy guns? Thought it was rifles only.
---
Is it? I thought it would be redundant with unyielding. Do special stats not max out at a certain point?
---
They are likely dealing with an O(n) scale problem, in programming terms.  The more things you have to interact with, the less cycles you have to do other things.  If you want near-instantaneous load times for your stash, you need less items.  If you don't mind waiting a few seconds every time you pull up inventory, then maybe not.
---
By putting it into a secondary storage, the "lag" won't hit you every time, and it even has a story explanation.
---
I've had a couple of occasions where I joined a server in the wee hours of the morning to find a ghost town kind of feeling with only 1 or 2 other players, and then they left, and I had the map to myself, it was one of these occasions when I discovered the unusual Legendary Spawn that used to occur when a Server was about to go down for maintenance. I was just entering the gate to WS near the Station when I got the pop up, and for the next 20 minutes WS was producing an endless supply of Targets, the back porch of the Club house was waist deep in Ghouls &amp; Meat piles, and I got 3 level ups, and 58 legendary items before the server kicked me out,
---
I know, but I'm not biggest fan of the guy - I appreciate his thorough research, but for me his voice intonation is irritating, to say at least.
---
So that paired with dodgy and serendipity is what has been helping me survive better than in PvP probably.
---
Fair enough, no harm in that. I know his videos are not for everyone.
---
Second only to graphics, copying data is one of the largest "costs" to any service.  The more they copy and have to scan every time you check your pip boy, the slower things are.  No CPU will make that faster.  What makes it faster is keeping the data on a single host--but that is kindof contrary to the concept of server/client architecture :)
---
Serendipity is crazy OP. Everything's coming up millhouse.
---
inb4 you can use M+Kb on console...
---
I 100% understand that but do you think the grind for legendary's is required? If they simply restricted resources making ammo something you had to use more carefully and as a result resources more valuable would you play the game clearing landmarks and events for caps, chems, and ammo so you could continue pvp? Is a gear grind really needed when we have a game so many valuable consumables?
---
Just double checked with my TS/50 that I had sitting in storage. Definitely uses Rifleman perks.
---
Rifleman - 79 Ballistic / 75 Energy.
---
Commando - 49 Ballistic / 47 Energy.
---
Doesn't make much sense... but it is what it is.
---
That's really cool... like your secret batcave entrance.
---
Burn
---
As a West Virginian from the Charleston area, we definitely get plenty of snow.
---
As a North Carolinian Man I feel this sentiment. Wake up to humidity and dew on the grass, watch the snow fall and everyone close up shop and schools for the day, then watch it rain around noon and grill outside in the 80 degree sun before evening, which then gets muggy and unbearable.
---
No way, thanks for putting in the work to check
---
honest question - why?
---
All they would need to do once they had a balanced pvp mode is add a battle pass that tracked high value boss kills, mobs kills, event completions, player kills, and had multiple tiers of cosmetics or other things to chase based on your complete and total survival performance. It would be easy to design a battle pass around both the pvp and pve aspect.
---
What?!?!? A bug that's actually IN FAVOUR of the player???
---
k
---
Games that have a battle pass are Fortine? Listen if you are right and they need a way to monetize the game mode before they are willing to fix it then a battle pass is better than nothing especially since it is still something I can opt out of. 
---
The battle pass gives players a grind because I would be asking them to remove legendary equipment and some people need a grind to even play a game these days. I don't know but right now the core pvp experience and a battle pass is the only thing keeping Apex Legends together but with a few hundred thousand players at peak hours I would say they are doing just fine.
---
I fully agree - I've been using all B25 and most BE (except GPlasma) heavies and I enjoy 50 Cal the most - from the sound of the gun to good balance between ammo efficiency, damage and stopping power it's for sure the best non-energy heavy gun for me. I like Gatling Gun as it's awesome for damage/per shot, but it lacks the versatility of 50 Cal.
---
That has happened to me 2 of 3 times times after launch and never happened againafter the fasnacht update. 
---
I would be able to essentially have a server for myself for hours  (longest was 12ours with nobody or crashes)and farm whitespring without worrying about getting my kills ninja'd or workshops taken away.
---
I always drop my underarmor as soon as I can. It weighs as much as a stimpak and there's no real reason for that. They just need to make all the cosmetics weightless.
---
Yeah, everyone knows that radiation destroys all pink and purple coz those are weak women colours. Only manly men colours like black and camo can survive a nuclear blast. Dumb ass.
---
Hey, NP. It's been about six months since I switched from Rifleman to Commando and didn't know if it had been changed since. Plasma thrower on a sniper is the perfect "oh shit they're on me weapon." Seriously... if you're a rifleman get a furious / junkie / bloodied / whatever your build is plasma rifle. They are a **perfect** back up weapon.
---
But as I mentioned they're hard to keep in ammo as by my experience Plasma cartridges are the rarest ammo drops. And it absolutely pisses through ammo. Three seconds is like 100 rounds or something. It's beast mode though and melts, literally and figuratively, everything.
---
I had a pistol only build that I abandoned at lvl 68 or so, and then when the purveyor started dropping legendary pipe revolvers, I immediately started playing it again, because my revolver did about +30 DMG more than any other weapon I had.
---
Just chucked about ten of each in the overseer camp trunk during a stash cleanout. I had them listed for 11 caps each but even at that price they were a slow mover.  Getting ready to do 200 treasure maps so the slag had to go to make room for better plans.
---
BE Gatling Plasma
---
Yes, that right, fool😁
---
There's a somewhat reliable way of getting this bug.  swapping from a Gatling to your standard weapon.  I was able to do it consistently before, but i forget if it was mid reload or something.  Whatever it was, i remember being happy to find a really handy exploit.  I was giving my AA tesla 250 rd capacity just holding down the trigger indefinitely.
---
Me too. But for me, Adventure just doesn’t have enough. I find myself getting a bounty and just waiting in my camp for people since no one takes workshops anymore, and when I take them no one comes (or I take them, and fight like one person, and I don’t get anything from them because they just store everything before going.) At least in Survival I’d get some sort aid out of it.
---
Apex actually has 8-10 million weekly Ayers, according to EA. I know other games are way better. I stopped playing FO76 over a month ago because of how trash it is. I didn't mind it being rough at first, because I had faith in BGS to fix it. Then it got worse. And worse. And worse. And they never fixed any of the major problems to any satisfactory degree.
---
I agree with what you're saying, it would definitely breath some life into this dying game, but I just don't see them doing it. That's all I'm getting at.
---
I would rather have them invest the money into fixing **all** the technical issues of 76 first, and then invest more into fluff stuff like crossplay later.
---
Sheepsquatch vs. Glowing Rad Ants
---
Do you have a mic?  Mock his total impotence to being unable to harm you or your CAMP.  He's compensating for something with that missile launcher.
---
Not worth putting in a vending machine imo.  You get them in droves from treasure maps and such, so only new players/new characters need them.
---
If code is written well.... this can either of two situation.
---
Harder later because there is code in the wrong places (layers) and this needs to be moved to another place. This usually creates bugs when fixed/moved. Being that developers work on teams, It may not be the dev that wrote the code that is moving it. Something could be missed/broken.
---
Easier.. because there have been so many iterations that were able to test the different code that the operation is now just moving pieces of code to another location.
---
Because it was not planned initially .. It's normally the Harder option that wins here..
---
Just did meat week all by myself and there were at least 10+ players in my game i think a lot of people gave up on it because there’s no new rewards
---
There's currently a Halloween event in the files that involves vandalizing the Whitespring in various sorta Halloweeny ways
---
Sorry.  I keep it on for my handmade on that build.
---
20-25k.
---
I find the fog crawlers are usually hiding out in the trees even after banging the drums. You sometimes have to chase them down or seems.
---
Add intensity and cloud to ground lightning strikes
---
no problem, I am also currently building a tank, 15S and 15E, I can take all the hits
---
People have touched on the others so I will just say that Mutant's is a good middle ground for someone that wants bonus damage but doesn't want to go bloodied, or wants bonus armor without having to worry about what level their health is at. It gives you a lot more flexibility with your build, and they usually sell.
---
Gotcha, here I was figuring the resistances and powered were universally better. Other than strength, luck and maybe agility(stealth), are there any other abilities people care about?
---
\+1STR for melee/unarmed is good - it's 5% more damage, as far as I remember. +1AGI is also useful for stealth characters - with high unyielding bonus is kind of overkill, but I wouldn't call it a scrip. Luck is also sought after by some players.
---
I see a lot of people are against PC and console cross play but dont people realize PC gamers use controllers too? I use a controller for 90% of my games and it's literally the same as mouse and keyboard.
---
Sorry, Xbox. I think I've only ever found like 1 sneak effect in the wild.
---
Whats hilarious about someone cheating? Just dont get it......
---
Yeah, this is just such a bummer though. I remember in other games shotgun was just bada$$, walking up to a mob and just watching heads explode. Hopefully, they'll fix this with the promised weapon-damage-revamp that i think is coming with Wastelanders.
---
Plans. Not super common but you can get weapon plans from them. Save a few thousand caps each one.
---
Jus think about it...the nuclear blasts messed with nature itself.
---
It could be possible but i think if they did they need rad snow storms lol
---
Also slip n slide all over the place
---
I have no idea but the loot quality is definetly better in the level 3 safes.  I have gotten some pretty good plans out of them.  I usually would check the cemetery and the area around top of the world.
---
8-10 million I could see that but when you talk about concurrent players over a 24 hours and 7 days a week I doubt that adds up to much more than 300-400k during a peak hour on a weekend.
---
Mostly just difficult to see
---
Okay, I"ll add you. I play sporadically, but I'll look for you when I am on. foxsable is my IGN
---
Well i play on PC with a controller so competative pkay is hardly an issue im my eyes
---
Survival mode is being removed, and for the most part you have to tag in for PvP in adventure mode. Just turn on pacifist mode in settings, and you won't have many problems. Also, stay away from workshops, because those that are looking for a fight after survival mode leaves will be all over them.
---
You will.still run into a few assholes here and there that will try to goad you into a fight because they're bored, but there are more friendly people than assholes so. You should enjoy the experience overall if you enjoy the fallout series. Wastelanders also drops in November, so you picked a good time to start I guess. 
---
I personally left the game, haven't touched it in a month. I may try again after Wastelanders. I just personally couldn't stand all of the bugs and glitches that never get fixed. Makes it hard to enjoy the game for me.
---
The fact with NW removing VATS on players and everyone started the same is one reason why I like that mode. 
---
Something that should be the same for Survival but in a large open world.
---
Xbox already supports keyboard and mouse :P just up to the devs to implement it
---
[Great Video on Technical Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t9NyVyHA4M)
---
I think this was meant as a distraction while they focus on bugs and wastelanders.  New content would mean spending time on development for the event.
---
even if they dont make it a sticky, lock and update it, then keep it pinned to the sidebar.  you wont waste a sticky but its there for easy access as needed.
---
That's just EAs own statistics, the 8-10 million.
---
FO76 is still hot garbage anyway. They really need to totally restructure the game.
---
Could you link? I’d add them to an excel spreadsheet or google doc
---
More customers!
---
As long as Pacifist is enabled, just ignore him.
---
Hey - it's free super meat. I will not complain.  
---
I got 27 from this herd.
---
die
---
I had it with every melee weapon I tried. It wasn't 100% of the time, but it was definitely a majority.
---
That is... Odd....  
---
Thanks as always, will report and hopefully others will pile on and confirm / register it as a non-unique glitch
---
you may also want to kite him/her into a bigger fight and then just... leave.
---
ps: dont forget to stash ur junk constantly!
---
Everyone I tell laughs that this game doesnt have the very basic EVERY MMO has.
---
Yeah I really wish they would give us a release date already. I have to travel for work all throughout winter, and would like to take some days off during/around the launch of Wastelanders, but by the time they tell us, it will be really short notice to request vacation time.
---
Fuck no. We should be moving as far away from crossplay as possible, it's already bad enough they're updating pc on the same schedule as console and that cert time lag is why the game is still in such poor shape and why whenever they break something it takes weeks longer to fix than it should.
---
76 needs to be on the same kind of setup games like warframe are, keep consoles and pc seperate so you can play off the strengths of pc to make the game better faster instead of just dragging everyone down.
---
A fresh start would defiantly chance things but that alone or even seasonal wipes of gear would not be enough I don't think. It needs more done to it IMO.
---
I used to pvp a lot but I ended up not doing pvp cause so called pvpers are so fking toxic. I consider myself a toxic player but these people are just beyond that. The game's a lot better without them and I'm glad these people are considering quitting. Not that I want to see you quit, hopefully you are not one of those people
---
Sure. The contract should be a % per copy not to go below a set amount per without prior approval. 
---
Now, is there some kind of digital tariff since it’s from a US company? I don’t know. 
---
Last I checked the digital for Xbox was $49-$54 USD while a physical copy is $15-$18. 
---
And Amazon digital books are often more then physical ones. So Sony isn’t alone in this.
---
Actually I've put together a full set of assassins combat armor. Yesterday I won every PvP engagement I could get myself into but none of them were using explosive lasers so I still have yet to test that out with my new setup.
---
Well if you don’t hit him back, he won’t kill you(as far as i know), so you’re kinda safe; 
---
Anyway, i use a meele built, so a 350 level would take couple of hammers to go down;
---
maybe, the origin of '76 is FO4
---
HA! Good one!
---
Psn and xbox live have terrible digital pricing.  Base prices for older games can still be $60 ( including sports ) when retail can be $5 - $10.  So it's not Fallout, it's the marketplaces.  Consoles want to beat places like Steam, but don't seem to understand why people have massive game libraries on their.  It's one reason I still largely refuse to go digital only on ps4.
---
But you can get red ant lager. 50 lbs carry weight is amazing!
---
Just basic, no legendary:
---
1) Gatling gun - Fun, good use of ammo, cheap
---
2) 50 cal - versatile, fun, looks good
---
3) Flamer - Just pure fun, good damage and burn stuff
---
4) Harpoon - great for initial contact/sniping. Slow reload makes it a pain, but that first shot is a doozy. 
---
5) LMG - This is a great gun, just ammo is expensive and the clip is too small.
---
I'm not a big fan of the minigun, it's just too slow with the spin up. I've also never really loved the other energy weapons for some reason, though I guess I need to give the plasma gat another go, based on all the comments.
---

I haven't seen Campfire tales since before the change to events.
---
forest and 94 masks dont seem to have the change, urban does.  i tried with hardhat, miners helmet, mr fizzy helmet, police hat, black leather cap (as), and the hunting cap (as)
---
Skyrim and 4 both sold enough to have them set for a while
---
seriously.  I would love to see the numbers on those things, does anyone ever use them?  we should def be able to sell ammo
---
True. I agree that NW was a shit idea.
---
All the shotgun perks are in S and rifle perks are in P. It's tough when you're trying to level &amp; switch points. I'm kind of hung between half good shotguns &amp; half good rifles. I'll get there! :)
---
oh man i would love that. i have only one friend that actually gave the game a chance and he has been in love with it since. it's nice to have convos about it but we've always thought it was so shitty that we cant play together bc he's a PS guy and im an Xbox guy.
---
Great! Then it should be easy to keep a log for a week where you do it deliberately and confirm that your expectations are supported by data. :P
---
As a Connecticut native, I would love to see those unfamiliar with snow try to drive in it.
---
right? wherever will a small indie start up like Bethesda possibly get the funds???
---
Those are fair points, but keep this in mind.
---
It should be possible for console players to opt out of playing with pc players if they feel. Just like other cross platform games out now. There are ways around this issue.
---
Also pumpkin grenades
---
Thankyou :D
---
Definitely this. I think I went 8 straight prime cuts without a legendary plus 2 more where the final wave didn't even spawn since the 2nd or 3rd waves wandered so far off target they didn't get killed in time. I think the last meat week must have been before they "fixed" the legendary drop rates because this round sucked.
---
Erm, since when? It definitely its.
---
Yes, they have been buffed due to the Vault Raids, but this instant melting effect is random in my experience. I'm glancing in Excavator PA and most Queen/King attacks apply only small amounts of poison damage over time. However, in 10% of the cases, poison attack stacks exponentially and I'm dead under a second.
---
There is practically no pvp so don't worry lol
---
I still see a lot of activity, for the most part. But it is slower than when it started.
---
For me, personally, the event has been a huge success, even though I don't have the Tenderizer yet.
---
I was travelling during the last meat week so personally Im glad to see it back.  There's nothing in the rewards I even want but I don't mind hitting a few of em here and there to get stuff for trade later on.  Its just a meh event and I agree with the others that say its a diversion to fill the time before wastelanders.
---
We’re at 2 mil already bois
---
A firestorm occurs "when coalescent fires cause sufficient updraft to form their own wind, blowing inwards from all sides and thereby increasing the intensity of the fire". Essentially, a collection of fires in the same area gets very hot and converges. This super-fire then heats the air so much that it begins to cause its own self-perpetuating weather patterns with hurricane force winds. Most notably, a small firestorm occurred at Hiroshima after the US detonated a nuclear bomb over the city during World War Two. 
---
The physics behind this phenomena is simple. After the initial fiery blast outwards, air rushes back inwards towards the epicenter of the explosion at upwards of 200 mph. This adds fuel to the flames, which start to burn hotter. The air, superheated by the numerous fires rises quickly. This causes air to be sucked back towards the epicenter of the fires, to be heated again and perpetuate the process until the fire runs out of fuel. At its peak, a firestorm can cause hurricane force winds and level entire cities.

We need more space on the C.A.M.P's
---
.50 cal easily unless you can bag a explosive plasma gatling
---
Very cool I'm jealous I dont have the scabber armor
---
Agree
---
I feel like it would take away from the feeling of the game. It's supposed to be nuclear fallout. The fact that you're not living shoulder to shoulder with others is kind of a big story point of the game, as a lot of humanity was killed off. I don't know, in another game it would be cool, but in this one it would kind of be immersion breaking for me.
---
I mean not a single male looking hairstyle gas been released
---
Shotguns are pretty trash right now

Try the gunslinger perks
---
We haven't been getting a whole lot of content for the past month. I know a lot of us expect delays. I know it's optimistic but it seems like they're doing whatever they can to release it in a timely and stable manner.
---
What are your typical playtimes? I usually either play from 12-1 EST (lunch) or 3:30-4:30 EST.
---
I think PS4 can use m+kb too. I don't know I'm on PC... The whole "PC players will kill console players with m+kb" is complete be. I play most of my games on PC with my Xbox controller... I'm never outclassed because of my input method... And the whole "hackers, modders and bear! Oh my" is stupid too... If it were that rampant people wouldn't be buying games on PC. But it makes up a huge portion of the market. I never *notice* any hacker on any of the games I play. Fallout would be no different. PC devs do implement anti cheat systems you know...
---
Thanks for the reports! We're looking into a couple of issues with creatures getting distracted or heading off into the wrong direction during Primal Cuts events and hope to have them fixed up the next time we hold the Meat Week event.

"and then I work up" = "and then the server crashed"

Honestly just a little disappointing when the final creature spawned and it was only prime. I found the primal cuts in the ash heap spawned legendary most often for me, but probably just RNG.
---
Throw up a heart emoji and follow them around. Or spam team requests.
---
Kinda all over but mostly 4pm-9:30pm Central
---
This is the right answer.
---
Okay, still good to know
---
If you think I'm angry then you must have led a very sheltered life. Funny how people like you go around shouting your mouth off, but as soon as anyone comments against you you jump on the "you're an angry fanboy" defensive. Don't like being told you're wrong, do ya?
---
Cool, thanks!!
---
Explosive harpoon to stagger him and initiate the pvp, switch to auto railway and vats his head for the kill. Go chameleon and fast travel anywhere but here before his friends can come running from behind whatever wall or hill they are hiding.
---
Okay. I might pull an evening at some point. Maybe today. I'll look for you.
---
Theres bald...and others I guess, I dont have Male characters so idk
---
For me (PC), it doesn't work outside Scorched Earth: I've killed a Scorched Megasloth at the NAR Repair Yard and didn't count towards this challenge but counted towards the "Kill Megasloth in the Cranberry Bog" challenge.
---
pcmr would clean up in NW :)
---
Look at the styles section of the atom shop
---
For sure I just got it last month and i costantly play.  Its very entertaining.
---
I literally edited some shit out cause I was wrong on it and you still attack. I dont mind being wrong lol. That's why i edited my comment !
---
i have experienced this...
---
Since ever. Modular coding demands abstraction and organization.
---
Communications should be it's own area.
---
Seemed to work well for the recent cod beta. Saw some console players doing really well, even beating pc players sometimes.
---
Explosive harpoon eh? There lie the problem...
---
Well take some fucking English lessons because you speak like a 6 year old.
---
Plasma worth it?
---
I've tried a controller, how the hell do you hit anything?
---
Its part of the engine.......
---
Look at Unreal that supports it by default.
---
I'm completely with you :) I had no idea about PS4 lol if it does support it then people don't even have that excuse anymore, crossplay and input options should just become the standard lmao
---
And honestly no one asked for the Hornets nest or that megaton one..hideous imo
---
Ok, thanks for letting me know. Appreciate the details!
---
Oh sorry for being late, if you didn't search it already it's Italian :P
---
As someone who lives in the Shenandoah Valley, this is so true.
---
I'd prefer to be able to just break down any ammo I don't use (ala FO:NV) and make ammo out of the materials.
---
Just giving the what I would do scenario.
---
Horde events should spawn no less than that many enemies. I feel a bit underwhelmed sometimes fighting things 5 low level enemies at a time...
---
2 months. It will be released in the last days of november, if not (very likely) delayed to middle winter
---
&gt;The tenderizer i can kind of understand
---
I don't.
---
Because if the concern is "Oh, it stops being special if anyone can make however many they want," well, there's a solution to that.  The same Atomic Shop flag that's on backpacks that prevents trading/dropping/selling/etc.
---
Whoever thought "Oh yeah, players will be delighted to have a 20 WT object in their stash which is equivalent to a Lv. 40 Super Sledge" wasn't thinking.
---
And wait for the TES6 sellings.
---
i've been doing stings &amp; things and operation tidy everyday for the past week. i'm getting badges from them across 3 of my characters. i received badges yesterday. i managed to pick up the insulated lining with one of my guys. they are still dropping.
---
Yup, saw this as well. Kind of scary as I was in my low 20s and I came upon the group just in time to see them whup a Yao Guai's butt... granted it was a low level Yao Guai,  but still...
---
Fair point 😂.
---
The 20lb does suck
---
Interesting detail, makes perfect sense.  I have to assume something like that probably is in play with 76 since it's already multi-platform.
---
Yay! Best place, relaxed, views, junk... What else can a wastelander ask for?
---
PC also has more issues than consoles by threads here on Reddit... most the issues I see have to do with PC version.
---
It's often bad with the legendary hermit crab. That's usually dead in two seconds flat before half the group has had the chance to get a shot in. Put your big guns away for a split second, people, please, and give everyone a look in. What makes me extra salty is when these people swing by late in the day after me and my mediocre weapon have put in all the work to clear the other waves, and they waltz off with the prize. Rant over.
---
Seems to happen at the Col. Kelly monument quite a bit.  Big Game Hunter will send you there to kill something else and the radstags will be going to town on the other critters.
---
100 caps, I'd just scrap it to be honest, I'm guessing those people are out for a scam.
---
Yeah they would have to update things at the same time on both or else it would cause problems
---
My english is just fine fucker. Maybe the issue is. (YOU CAN'T READ)
---
Want list: players could sell at your camp for certain items you wanted at the price you place if they want to sell. 
---
Some Caps would then be marked not for use since you would be asking for items. 
---
You need 45 ammo, buy price is 1 cap each, they could sell you x number of 45 that you set the number.
---
Sounds like hard disk or ssd failure, try on a different disk/ssd. Windows 10 is licence linked to your PC hardware.
---
Love it when I'm stalking somebody all stealth like and out of nowhere, "I CAN'T BELIEVE I FINALLY CAUGHT UP WITH YOU! COOOONGRATULATIONS! YOU ARE THE WINNER OF THE GREAT APPALACHIAN SWEEPSTAKES."
---
Lol, and I'm the angry one?
---
Two days? It has been 24 hours in total, and I'm in the UK so probably a different time zone to you. I only picked up on the thread again today. Wasn't aware there was a time limit on replies.
---
Funny how you want to talk about being mature when you're bitching about a game you don't play anymore and apparently have very limited knowledge about.
---
i just ignore them yeah im a higher level i can take em but the last time i did i got called a hacker over and over for an hour just because i popped a couple nuka colas then killed him with my bloodied setup. took out him and surprise his 3 buddies that were with him waiting. pvp pretty much isnt worth it unless your doing nuclear winter people complain when you dont die cause you use a good setup or complain about the damage your doing when you got a really good weapon with the right perks.
---
U can look at my profile and it’s pol I know and have done trades with. This is an amazing piece lol. I have about 12 different offers from 12 different ppl n they ain’t scammers. If Ud scrape it ur crazy I’m lvl 312 played since day one beta and know a ton about the game but was curious so I posted this one. Anyone can check my profile n see all the ppl trying to buy or trade for it.
---
That is the only kind of surprise mechanics I actually enjoy in games.
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/bxCgBga](https://imgur.com/a/bxCgBga) \- Both normal + power armor.
---
I was also nervous to read of possible cross play. Not even considering the hackers, a keyboard and mouse have a distinct advantage in gameplay over controller users.
---
I'm sure some use a ps4 controller also. Besides that fact, you can see farther than me because of rendering, your loading times are faster than mine, you probably lag less, all around it's just a better way to play lol. I just happen to have the playstation and not a PC before you ask why I don't just switch.
---
Might be.. also why we all get the same bugs :P
---
is it the underarmor or the jumpsuit? if it shows 0s for the dmg/eng/rad, it's the under armor. if it shows nothing, it's the outfit.
---
Yeah that a good alternative to using caps
---
I'm on PS4 and would like cross play with xbox, not with PC though with that being open to modders
---
Now you can do two right things today and sell it to me.... psn? :)
---
Damn, god tier top. Gratz!
---
You are correct, works with urban, but not with forrest, I have both, bummed me out a little haha 😂
---
I've been shotguns on my main since March, I recently switched to heavy because I just can't deal with it anymore. I had the same issue on my commando build as well.
---
Oh it’s just the outfit then - where can I find the under armor one?
---
Guilty Spark is proud of you.
---
Ignore him for a bit, then stop what you're doing and slowly turn to face him.  Sit there staring directly at him for a slightly uncomfortable amount of time.  Then slowly turn back to whatever you were doing, ignoring him completely after that.
---
Once you're bigger, pull out a very large gun before turning to him, but the other steps are the same.  If you're on voice coms, you can add 'Heh, not worth the time' softly before turning away for extra effect, but YMMV on that one.
---
I've actually gotten some really great rage out of people like that.  It's kinda fun once you get the hang of it.
---
Haters gonna hate
---
That seems like a pretty good God roll
---
I think part of what made the first one so great was the double xp at the same time. It made prime cuts a lot more worth the ammo.
---
Aye, can't have PC players hogging all the best glitches!
---
I don't have enough space on my other disk. I've only had issues with the game recently.  
---
But it makes me wonder, if reinstalling the bethesada launcher too would solve it.
---
Not entirely true. At the "beginning" of the conversation about FO76 and cross play, Beth said that they were ready to go with cross plat play. The only entity holding them back from flipping the switch was Sony. 
---
At least, that was the case back when people were first clamoring for it. The situation has probably (read: more like definitely) changed since then and you're probably right. It just needs to be mentioned that the case at that time was Sony dragging their feet. 
---
Lest we all forget that one time that the Rocket League devs "accidentally" flipped the switch and let xbox people play with ps4 people for all of 5 minutes.
---
Is it bitching or legitimate complaints
---
Mods are not an issue with NW, but if you're PvPing in Adventure, that's a disadvantage for sure.
---
yep but eh just what i gotta deal with especially on the ps4 got a guy thinks he can go and tax people and kill em if they do the slightest thing wrong heck cant even wear enclave stuff without him freaking out and wanting to kill you
---
So tf is pacifist survivaal and adventure mode?
---
They added the Brewing Station to the base game without the Atom Shop...
---
This would have saved survival
---
Weren't there a TON of pink and purple and whatever other skins/paint like.... six months ago?
---
It's the same for pretty much every game, digital versions stay at full retail price for years
---
I have placed my other explosive 0.5cal machine gun out on my vendor for sales. +30% against super mutants
---
Dominick the Donkey was the first thing that came to mind.
---
Just because another named engine didn't abstract out a family of functions, does not make it good coding standards.
---
Code separation by functional groups is a logical organization and a way of thinking how to lay code blocks out.   Unreal should keep to graphics functions. If it covers more than that.... It's not an example of an engine, bit more of an environment to code in..
---
Balance reasons?
---
It would not be pay to win, but the game would become smaller, easier, etc. In fact, it is way easier than before. For instance: People who start playing today can fast travel almost anywhere in the world thanks to Vending machines at camps. That makes the big map and distances irrelevant. I hate it.
---
It might have to be separate for consoles and PC in NW.  But you can use a keyboard and mouse on some (?) consoles, so you may still have that issue.
---
Ye i seen that post that one guy got killed by computer dogs couse one player maked the dogs atack em
---
I dont get it either. Maybe they had to "balance" it out as it's kind of a beginners suit, that can be acquired a full set of quite early in the game ?
---
A side note,if I was mining in one of those things and got buried and trapped underground under thousands of tons of rocks with no hope of rescue, I'd damm hope they'd have built a self destruct/ terminate occupant button ..
---
October 15 there will be a free modern statue! You can see a picture of it on the Project Clean Appalachia site under week 6 [here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events).
---
I just move the knobs and pull the trigger.. It works for me..
---
At least pre-war money scraps to cloth, so you can make gunpowder... or repair/craft other outfits.
---
Wait. 
---
Dense &gt; BOS
---
 in terms of resistances ?
---
I want the game to be harsher in all ways, so yes, please.
---
Excavator has perks the others don't.  Definitely a balance thing.

i think you should just be able to make it. if you've ever played nw, you should be able to craft a vault 51. have you checked if you can craft one?
---
58???
---
So PS4 players can play xbox players and switch with PC and every combination in between? Is that really a big surprise that people want that?
---
As a Michigander I see your snow, then watch it melt. Then watch it hit 80 degrees then snow again at night all while having an earthquake and then having it rain the next day followed by more more snow
---
Ps4 minecraft is based off the java edition but was already confirmed to be changing to bedrock edition soon, (not a fan personally, bedrock redstone is garbage bc its altered for mobile/pocket edition). Also, ps4 edition was handled by 4J, a separate dev team. But regardless, this is a fo76 sub.
---
I would love a destruction effect, even if it isnt on all buildings. Imagine if you could destroy the Grafton Dam with a nuke and flood Morgantown with toxic water, filling the town with mirelurks, or if you could remotly start a radstorm when nuking an active power plant. Just imagine the possibilitys of what Bethesda could add with a nuke update
---
ok.. I'm married and got 2 teen kids... so I can't promise.. but I hope to.. Just saying.. when I get home after a long day.. I love to shoot things.. but it might not happen .. :P
---
All the ones I can craft are just clothing - no stats on any of them
---
The same way multiplayer in 76 was done by reworking the engine. The same way Star Citizen Cry engine had to be reworked to support it.
---
Are we really talking about "good coding standards" in the fo76 subreddit? Kinda ironic.
---
Idk. I use it at SBQ all the time it reists alot of the rads and i never die. Even when i take several scream attacks from the queen.
---
He can'r damage you or your camp unless you agree to pvp by retaliating or claiming/contesting a workshop.  
---
So ignore him, report him for abuse, and/or jump servers.
---
nah, i think you're looking under outfits to craft. under armors have their own category.
---
I did the prime hunt on my own this morning near Welch. It was hard. A legendary sheepsquatch arrived. Many many nuka grenades later I won. Fine the legendary weapon was cool, but I got 4 pieces of prime meat, which had spoiled by this afternoon already.
---
I just dont see the point of this event, the rewards that relates to it (prime meat) are meagre and go off before I could even find Grahm
---
Any plans to fix stealth during these events? The automatic [danger] is really annoying.
---
Seems blatantly obvious to even people who don't use PA. I still find it shocking that people want the game to be any easier.
---
This is a really really bad idea. Prices on weapons are drastically different. This either means that one platform’s economy completely crashes or the other one goes way up. Duplicated items will flood over and it’ll be 100 times messier than it already is.
---
I wrote all that before thinking about the fact that my pvp build changed long ago to be a full hp build because they already normalized all pvp builds in the game by capping pvp damage to 110. The 110 damage cap is stupid and it exists because they cant balance damage or effects in the game as it is. I am going to leave what I wrote here with strike through text but the fact of the matter is the pvp people have been playing for a while now in survival was already crap and heavily normalized because if it was not then everyone would still be one tapping each other with maxed out bloodied builds and stealth crits. The type of pvp you are talking about which you probably experienced recently only existed because they gimped all the high damage builds with the 110 damage cap. Doing things my way would get you closer to the real experience you want without needing an arbitrary damage cap. 
---
~~Legendary loot is the goal in pve games so they could not remove legendary loot from pve because it is the entire point of the mode. On the other hand the point of survival is inevitable pvp. It is not if you will end up in pvp but instead when you will end up in pvp.~~ 
---
~~The thing is my perspective is as a person that played from beta to the end on The Division and saw all the things they had to do to make a game with random rolled gear stats, weapon perks, armor perks, and gear sets work with an open world style pvp mechanics that gave you a gear advantage. The short of it was they normalized all the the gear for pvp because the pvp mechanics had higher stakes than they do in FO76. In The Division after you killed boss mobs and got loot worth having you still needed to extract it and if someone killed you before you could extract it there was a very good chance they could steal it. Meaning you could be grinding for hours trying to get an upgrade and have someone that is fresh to the server come on when you were trying to extract and kill you and steal your loot, LOL. I did a tremendous amount of pvp in that game because of it's high stakes nature.~~  
---
~~The thing is Fallout 76 has an advantage in the fact that some of you characters power is in your build. Instead of only normalizing gear they could buff the perk system. I am probably sounding like a broken record but putting more focus on the perk system and less on the gear also does a few other key things. One it kills a lot of the incentive for people to buy or sell in game items, two it put players in the game instead of on the forums trying to trade, and three I think it opens up the chance to hybridize builds more efficiently.~~ 
---
~~Right now a 3\* perk card can give you 20% weapon damage but bloodied or junkies can give you 80% or 50% respectively. That make a bloodied weapon alone substantially more powerful than spending 9 special points and if we look at junkies it is worth 7 special points worth of damage. That simple fact alone shows how improperly balanced and broken the game is when the primary legendary effect even as a 1\* is more powerful that the meat of a build. You can remove all weapon based perk cards from bloodied build and use any bloodied weapon you want so long as you have adrenal reaction as a mutation and nerd rage you will out damage normal non bloodied characters.~~
---
~~I understand were you are coming from but the biggest problem the game has right now is balance and that directly correlates to the fact that you get more out of the game spending hours trading on forums then you ever will actually grinding in game.~~
---
Oh okay, I’ll check it out when I get home!
---
They are, but they’re also really cheap if nobody here has somehow managed to notice yet
---
Dont know why its relevant that its 76 sub. Rules state POSTS are to be related to 76, not comments. Id rather you not explain if you're gonna be pretentious at the end of ur comment...
---
Well, considering two of your complaints were proven to be bullshit then I'd say you were bitching.
---
Folks might be interested in unyielding +1 int for crafting sets.
---
I wouldn't be against them allowing us to connect a m/kb to the consoles to play tbh.
---
1-Create crossplay only for non-PvP mode. Adventure mode will certainly benefit from crossplay.
---
2-Disable players mods, make support for ingame mods (like FO4) at same time.
---
3-Solve 76237698 bugs
---
4-Then MAYBE let crossplay into PvP modes... or just leave it that way.
---
The atomic shop earnings should help with that right?
---
And the ones that were bullahit were deleted.  So if and when I'm wrong i take things down as to not misinform
---
Where does the Urban mask drop? I thought it could be bought from the enclave vendor but haven't seen it there for a while
---
Is there any point engaging when theres nothing to gain?
---
Yes. This spot is a lot of fun.  It will be like 4-5 Yao Guai versus 100 radstag haha
---
Same dude. Just staring at my camp for a few minutes and logging off. Survival was the game for me, I can't get into the game anymore. It wasn't JUST about the PVP for me. But the PVP enhanced everything else I did in game. I just loved the open ended sandbox PVP, no goals, no real "winning" just pvping for fun and roleplay. I was having a blast even when I was getting my ass kicked. I was always having fun. I watched my favorite game evaporate right in front of me and it feels bad man.
---
Yeah im fine with crossplay between the consoles but feel it should be avoided with PC.
---
I wish they would support crossplay.  I have gotten so bored with playing half full Nuclear Winter matches.
---
Human nature, both wanting things easier and complaining about what they don't have.  Not worth even noticing, especially these days.
---
OP is just using limited understanding of how things work (though this is fiction, so anything is possible).
---
Verry nice. I finally got my first explosive gun aswell. Its not as nice as urs but it works. Mine is the 3* Medics 10MM. Gives health when useing vats. Also bullets explode for area damage.
---
Very cool idea, you got my upvote 😜👍
---
&gt; Are we really talking about "good coding standards" in the fo76 subreddit? Kinda ironic.
---
Ahh...you win! :P
---
Yes, in 20 minutes, and I've gotten more than 40 on several such occasions prior to patch 11.5 which seems to have ended the phenomena.
---
I think they went with fun rather than realism as the primary game design conceit, and I think that was the correct move.
---
I NEED THIS!! I have not 1.. not 2 but five PA sets lol
---
Excavator, T-51, T-60, Prototype X-01 and Ultracite
---
I'm also trying to get T-45 ._. I may have a problem.
---
That's amazing.
---
When this happens your best bet is to relog.   Several bugs seem to be related to being put into a world and disappear when you leave and enter another one.  No idea why that is but its a way out of hours of frustration.
---
I have an IE 50 cal for when things get serious and a FE gatling for the slower moving situations. I also have an instigating non explosive 50 cal for when i dont want to blow myself up. I guess the gat is my favorite. Something about the way it sounds and it is just frikkin murderous man.  Destroys everything. Only issue is the lower DPS.
---
may i ask where you got the forest scout mask from? i've been grinding enclave events hoping to get one.
---
Why does that page say to take down 8M Scorchbeasts to unlock 25% off purveyor? I thought it was kill 8M scorched (like gun zombie dudes)
---
I don't think the armor is designed to protect you if you get buried, but at least from minor rocks falling on you and such.  You could argue it either way though.
---
Combat armor is designed to protect you from things like ballistic missiles and other projectiles, high energy and particle beam weaponry, and nuclear radiation.  JUST a little more heavy duty than rocks.
---
Different approaches to protection, depending on what you're defending against.
---
Having cross play would be good in general for all modes/servers. As it would allow the players to fill apalacha. Vs having at max 15 players on xbox 1 during the day then 5-7 players at night. Plus vending would be better.
---
Excavator works for me.  I'm a L141 melee, been in excavator since about L48.
---
With Fireproof1, no particular issues in nuke zones (to include multiple SBQs).
---
With a fast weapon, critters don't get enough hits to take you out before you kill them, and healing factor does the rest.
---
&gt; before you ask why I don't just switch.
---
oh, no, Different strokes for dif folks.. etc.. If I was on a console, it would be PS4 too. so I don't blame you one bit. Only we get to see all those silly pictures we were forced to take by challenges that we forgot to clean up while loading! You are limited to x pictures. I keep thinking "I need to delete that picture... everytime I sit waiting for the game to load....
---
Now I feel like a slacker, lvl 276 at 12 hrs.
---
I got one from a dropped connection and another a while back from Bots on Parade but haven’t seen them since, like months.
---
Pull out a broadsider and load it starring at them menacingly.
---
Ran across that a couple times, last time threw about 6 frag grenades into the middle of them. THEY were flying everywhere.
---
If free to play games like Dauntless and Rocket League can do cross play out the gate then I think a multi billion dollar company can.
---
If you are playing solo, the Lone Wanderer Perk is a must-have. Regardless of your build. If you don't already have it maxxed, I highly recommend. I also recommend Blocker once you hit level 21. It seriously reduces damage from everything that isn't shooting you.
---
Did you mod the game? Or is it an update issue?
---
Morgantown High School is good
---
I know it would take alot. BUT I would love to see a Mistress of Mystery power armor skin/paint. Something stealthy but looking like it was designed for the show.
---
It's just "scorched", anything with scorched aspect. So the zombies as well as the beasts and everything in-between.
---
it’s s 8M for the first goal then they up the amount to kill for the next and then again for the next
---
Ooh that would be neat. But somehow I feel like they'd mess it up somehow
---
typo? It says 'Scorched' here: [https://bethesda.net/en/article/cm1RPKthQ75aMdF9dQY4m/fallout-76-project-clean-appalachia](https://bethesda.net/en/article/cm1RPKthQ75aMdF9dQY4m/fallout-76-project-clean-appalachia)
---
Aww we could have finally seen what those cargobots have been swarming around all this time.
---
I put the camp module way up in the pylon to get a LOT of height, even though this cut out the junk pit. Oh well. Worth it.
---
I'll add it to the list :)
---
If they would give this the Captian Cosmos treatment  I would be too happy
---
I agree with your list but would have to add that there are certain times when some of the effects listed as trash tier are quite good. Exterminator's is excellent for vault raids, troubleshooter's is good for encryptid and silo runs, zealots is good for scorched Earth and hunters is good for project paradise. Of course outside of those events those effects are pretty trash but I thought it worth mentioning
---
Broadsider with a multi-canister. Nothing like hurling a lead ball at something.
---
Here you go :) No drop chances or anything like that as thats WIP.

Well if you wanna toss a entier diffrent state into 76 why not make the area huge and just allow us to cross the entier united states. And with that being said. Thats were the whole winter plot could take place as northen states get a shit ton of snow.or if u walked to california u would have to deal with. (Earthquakes)
---
Ha, that's one very dark side note.
---
He Obviously means a level 3 table that is safe.
---
Let's call it "Survival mode"
---
I’ve been excited to check the vault out, but my play schedule is wonky. Not sure if you’re still looking for players, but let me know if you are!
---
Yeah I started an alt because my main just destroys everything now with no effort.
---
For Christmas! GTA V does this for Christmas. Snow all over the city. It makes driving slippery. Walking like walking in sand. Diamond city in FO4 is decorated for Christmas.
---
Because it was designed to mine ore and not be shot at?
---
Alone with your thoughts and plasma cores.
---
It's been well attended on the servers i have been on.
---
Exploding plasma/laser/tesla weapons have been removed from loot tables for some time now, those in game are 'legacy' weapons and its rare to find a seller and they cost dearly.  Are they worth it? Clearly to some they are.  PVP players seem to think so especially.
---
I don't know what it would take to get me to play NW again. Full servers would be so far down the list I can't even
---
Well it can't get much worse
---
Im going to start going back to farming for T-60 paints.
---
So if we do get PA stands then i can display my favourite one
---
Morgantown Airport?
---
Just do a file scan from the launcher and it should be fixed.  It’s a pretty slow process.
---
That's a whole soccer game of cross-platform joy! And then nothing...
---
I like your perspective. The game has come a LONG way, and all that spaghetti code we hear so much about is going to be a lot more jumbled now than it was on release. It would be nice, but it's probably best not to hold our breath.

They didn't add anything new to the loot pool. I got everything from the last one, don't really feel motivation to play it again
---
LoL yeah hackers Bork every online pc game
---
Speaking of combat vs trapper, why do people not like trapper armor? I get combat is a good middle ground for dr/er , leather for ER, metal for DR, But trapper has DR and rad resist which is super handy if you run white springs and get mobbed by ghouls, or fighting scorchbeast.
---
Maybe try not posting misinformed opinions in the first place. Just a suggestion. I mean, you have the whole internet at your disposal, so there is literally no excuse for you to bitch about things without confirming they are true first.
---
Melee please
---
already at 2 million... get that scrip ready!
---
i can’t really tell if that was sarcasm or not haha, but! either way it was just a little side suggestion for a different fallout game maybe in the future, just thought it’d be cool to see what happens. Also, an entire map would be spectacular but bethesda has a hard time keeping up the map they already have
---
Thank you for the advice. I’ll definitely add these to perks I must have
---
Me too! All my PC friends think I'm nuts! Except my husband, who is weirder still: PS4 controller on his PC.
---
I'm not the OP but I've been playing about trying to find a good pistol build for quite a while, and it's not easy. The two main issues are that it's so crazy heavy in the agility perks that there's room for nothing else, and there's no armor pen perk :/
---
This is the base I'm working off now:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=33148ff&amp;d=an0ar2a00a30ao0ab1af1ai1ae1l71l12lu2lt2lr2lv0ic4sg2eu0c72p02ir2&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
Complete sneak+VATS focus, poor defense, and bloodied (probably a 10mm) with unyielding (1 chameleon, loves stealth boys) for synergies. Stay in VATS and crit as much as possible for as long as possible.
---
With regard to pipe-weapons, my understanding is that rifle and pistol perks work together, but only on pipe RIFLES. I'd love that to be wrong.
---
Wouldn't mind your thoughts :)
---
Yeah or multiple
---
Well... the installed FO76 uses about 80gb, installing needs about 15gb for the download, and then again about 10gb for the unpacking. 
---
That means you need at least 100-120gb of free space. If you don't have that you can't reinstall and the launcher will throw the error you have.
---
Thanks - Added :)
---
wait, I TOTALLY misread that. that’s a good idea actually
---
I copied across a few more: https://imgur.com/gallery/eYjQfdk
---
Fuck sony.
---
That is why country roads only take you home.
---
Sometimes this delicious herd of deer jerky spawns legendary rad stags. Easy scrip.
---
I didn't ask for more bullet resistance
---
Helvetia/Sutton area
---
Plasma, easily I know some traders who would give just about anything for that gun
---
Considering that we aren’t air bursting the nukes does make a difference. You get more coverage overall. 
---
What I would like to see is new variations of mobs. Nuclear charged. Sure glowing is good but we have a perk directly made for dealing with them. Hell making them boss level would be good. 
---
After a new nuke we should get more fallout, rad storms, nuclear winters, 
---
But yeah as some people have said. When selecting your detonation site give us the option to air burst or direct impact.
---
Pretty good?  Any exploding Gatling Plasma is basically the best gun in the game.
---
If I had a "cap" for every.... What button is that...
---
it's the "X"    
---
that didn't work....
---
na na na na na...moooooooo
---
I remember the first snowfall in GTA V, that was pretty special. It would probably be a good boost to PR to have some snowfall and some related events during winter.
---
I often have to switch from my grog axe to a shotgun during silo runs because the turrets would die. I can swing 5+ times and nothing happens.
---
Similar to those in the Lucky Hole Mine.
---
Get nuka nades and orbital success beacons
---
I have been on when Morgantown was nuked, I was low level (20) and couldn't do much there without getting insta killed by high level scorched
---
I'm level 85 and crafted my first set of excavator this week (I hate PA but needed the lead for ammo) and the fusion core ran out before I'd even carried out a full sweep of Lucky Holes mine, which is hardly the most sprawling of locations. Is that usual? I expected it to last ages!
---
I need to craft some now. mmmuuuuuhhahahahahah
---
Looks like Backpack Skins and Emotes are on the Atomic Shop menu, boys!
---
So as a woman playing a female toon, I WANT to agree with you, but I worry that it will go WAY too far!
---
It was too and about that house. It was otherwise a spectacular build! But... pink unicorn wallpaper? Looked like a cake...
---
Play between the hours of 11p-3a on a Sunday. Best single player Fallout Ever. :D
---
Which is better in combat, an M1A1 Abrams tank or a Caterpillar bulldozer? 
---
Don't get me wrong. Bulldozers are rugged machines, but they aren't designed to protect occupants from the same hazards as a battlefield. It's not just game balance. It's a different machine built to face different hazards. 
---
Design can be more important than use of a "stronger" material. 
---
Baseball bats are a different issue. Baseball bats don't just damage people in excavator armor, but also people in T-60 PA. That doesn't make sense, but it is a game balance issue.
---
Good info, thanks!  All seem reasonable except BP Weapons (tedious) and unfortunately shotguns (because you need enough ammo/time to kill 160 - 240 due to the damage bug).
---
why is everyone calling this a god roll?  didn't TSE get a nerf?
---
great place to take a Fat Man for Atomics Fan possum badge
---
Now console players can experience the joy of dealing with all the hackers that are still in Nuclear Winter.
---
Haha! Bless your heart for making me feel less weird about only wanting it for the skins! Mr. Pebbles, huh? Something to think about. Can you get skins in-game, or is it all Atomic Shop stuff?
---
You may be correct about hooking that setup to a console. I imagine it would only work with the web browser app and not for in-game controls. 
---
I’m just a console proletariat so I don’t really know about these things 😔
---
It sounds good but with as much ammo that’s in game and hoarded it would eventually de-value the cap. Worst than ever before. 
---
I can see a daily limit. And daily types of ammo being accepted. Other wise we’re just going to end up with a even messy economy. 
---
I could also see a ticket redemption system. Say for example turning in 10 .38 rounds give out X tickets. And tickets could be used to get X ammo with out shelling out caps.
---
Support this. Four of my characters are pattered (very loosely) based on myself, my wife and my daughters and I like to thematically represent their personalities. 
---
There's not a dress in this game that looks like it has pockets; my younger daughter is very disappointed. And the only dress where the skirt isn't hugging the legs is the one with a hoop skirt (and really, missing all the petticoats - so laying down in that thing is ... poorly rendered).
---
4J worked with Mojang for PS3, PS4, and Xbox editions of Minecraft..
---
Thank You
---
  
---
I did not know if others knew. Had a friend grinding Atoms and he brought it up to me. So I imagine others dont know. Most of mine has been done because of how long I have been playing but I can imagine a newer player who struggling to get Atoms does not know this info.
---
Yea pretty sure that’s their intent most likely
---
It's so unfair to be painted with the griefer brush because I loved survival mode. I loved it because I could PVP and roleplay the darker side of the fallout universe without resorting to harassing peaceful players who just want to play to relax or whatever. I thought the separation was good for everyone. Now you have a group of players used to playing the game treating everyone else as a potential threat mixed in with players who just cant grasp why playing fallout like that would be fun.
---
That's so weird. That's never happened to me. I play on PC, so I guess that could be part of it. Thanks for clearing that up for me!
---
It's still powerful, even if it isn't as powerful as it was before.  If you happen to get one, I'll take it off your hands if it's not good enough for you.
---
True, but it’s not like the plans are expensive or require rare parts.
---
I know for a fact that some games have had to separate console keyboard users from controller users for that reason.  Not from experience (I've never owned a console), but from reading other stories.
---
Sorry, but I left PC 76 because of rampant cheating in NW. It's not stupid, it's a huge problem and it completely destroys that game mode. It's also a problem that simply doesn't exist on PS4 or Xbox. If they mix those platforms with PC, I'll stop playing entirely.
---
Drifter outfit and Wool fishermans hat.
---
That was a big part of it for me. She gave me an explosive .44 with extra damage to scorched. Almost as much damage as my other guns, and it's just so fun to dash around with a little six shooter! Did this character seem to die a lot? Trying to work out my chances of not dying...
---
Yeah but knowing the video game industry it would be more like a Power Bikini than Power Armor...
---
As a fan of winter, I see this too and it makes me sad. How I envy your lake effect snow (I dont live near Erie, but an hour north of Morgantown)
---
And weirdly this is giving me an idea for a responder guild hall CAMP theme.
---
Point Pleasant has been scorched every time I've been there. 
---
Morgantown trainyard has a decent number of low-level scorched.
---
You're not the brightest crayon in the box, huh?
---
It's all good, nothing is obvious in this game. Still learning new things after 700 hours.
---
You don't really get a better sneak as the weight remains the same but you don't have to repair.
---
It varies in my experience, sometimes no one shows up at the cooking event, other times there are many people and it is easily completed at 100%. At worst I turn in the meat and leave. The primal cuts events also seem to have quite variable numbers of players, once I was able to play the Savage Divide one 4 times in a hour solo (lots of XP and loot from the bears and honey beasts), in less lucky cases there are several high level players with legendary weapons and they (almost) one shot everything.
---
Would make .38 and 10mm worth picking up. Sadly it would probably break the game since we only saw it for NV and it wasn't ever in 4.
---
And toilet paper. Never forget the toilet paper.
---
Ok than it was designed purely to mine ore so humans wouldn’t lose their jobs to robots.
---
I said before. On all the gunslinger perks max tier add 5% armour pen. You get 15% all three. Same deal for auto pistols.
---
I didn't think this was even a question.
---
I'm wondering if nukes will still be possible after Wastelanders.  Hopefully they just make it impossible to launch on settlements, but with the map the size it is that would really make it difficult to find a spot other than the bog.
---
This can be caused if a Player is standing on top of the Primal Meat tower (the cross bars with hanging cages).
---
The spawned animal selects a player at random to aggro on.
---
If the randomly selected player is on the tower, the melee oriented animals will determine that they cannot hit the player.
---
Anti-Exploit tech then paths the animals away from the un-hittable player.
---
You can try this on your own, the Golf Clubhouse is a great example.  Aggro the ghouls, then head outside and hop on the Bus roof. 
---
What do the ghouls do?  **They run away.**
---
Isn't raider worse?
---
Belching Betty mine and ARV Medical Center are both still full of scorched even after the Responders quests for those areas are long done.
---
You'll die more against huge enemies, but not too much. I always use chameleon and sneak though, which helped alot. Finding a quadruple ammo single action was the best thing ever. It was still a pretty terrible weapon all things considered, but I got to be a cheesy movie cowboy with 24 bullets.
---
Not if it’s nuked.
---
What about down by fissure prime or glass cavern? Yea there are scorch beasts, but there is a crap ton of scorched running around too
---
You didn’t do enough damage, being present isn’t enough. I think it’s 5% damage by you that has to be done.
---
Sorry but I've been play FO76 since Beta on PC and play a lot of NW. Cheating is not a huge problem. Maybe you just need to hit gud. I've not ever run into a single cheater and people are blowing the cheating in NW way out of proportion. I think it's more likely people are getting salty from dieing and blaming it on cheating rather than just assuming they were better than you.
---
Got a zealot plasma rifle and chucked a flame nozzle on it, I'm impressed with the horrible things it does to Scorchbeasts if you can make em land.
---
only if we can have more nuka cola :P
---
I hadn't looked it up. I figured you would get back to me. It's interesting, lore-wise. It's Chinese for monster. Either way, run!
---
A locker at the train stations the best options. One locker 50lbs and it’s linked to all stations
---
RIght?
---
By even the most conservative estimates, they made tens of millions on 76 alone, never mind all their other games and ESO at this point is pure profit.
---
I do a run, it takes time if you don't fast travel but sometimes I just take the long way to encounter whatever random events (like yesterday, I encountered many many dead Brahmin on the road, I've never seen this before). They're all low level so pretty much anyone can do this without much issue (for me I am working on all the scorch combat challenges, perfectly timed with this event..unintentionally). My camp is near Hemlock's diner so it's also just easy for me to start.
---
I will start at **Wavy Willard**'s (maybe a dozen-ish total here). I progress to **Clancy Manor**, you'll get 6-7 here. I stay on the road so I can travel to the **Tyler County Fairgrounds**. There's a bunch of scorch there but it has varied for me, I have encountered at times a lot more scorch than I ever thought existed here. I stay on the road that runs parallel to the creek/river that contains Deathclaw Island. While it's no guarantee cause ghouls or super mutants might appear instead, I do encounter spawns of scorch at the **Silva** and **Billings** homesteads and **Lewis &amp; Sons Farming Supply**. And from there I end my journey at **Camden Park**, which is always crawling with scorch. 
---
Just fast traveling to each location, you won't take much time mopping up each location and you will quickly down a significant amount with ease. That doesn't even count the times I take the long way and encounter random groups of scorch on the road. It did not take me long to meet my goal of killing scorch with a sword, killing scorch with a crossbow, and now I am almost there with an unarmed weapon (I chose a boxing glove since I have never used a boxing glove before, lol). Next will be the black powder weapons one. And finally, ugh, the laser one (never have liked lasers).
---
It seems to me the level 80 sheepsquatch in the Ash Heap is actually stronger by a fair bit than the level 100 hermit crab in the Savage Divide. But it was also legendary more frequently, which may or may not have been just luck.
---
I completely agree, and the raids are the reason I listed exterminator as the best single-enemy affix. That said, with stash limits, I cannot imagine many players are keeping full sets of enemy specific gear, even though they could be very powerful. 
---
Similarly, I've seem people try life-saving builds (trying to trigger revenant), but it's quite a niche thing.
---
Inside top of the World Mezzanine Level isn't bad.
---
Yeah,its in the official bug and feedback stickied post:
---

* **The legendary ranged weapon attribute that applies “+250 damage resistance while reloading” can temporarily remove the effect of that weapon’s primary legendary attribute after reloading.** 
---
   * **STATUS:** We are aware of and investigating reports of this issue.
---
It's the cheating, not the controller vs kb+m. I used a 360 pad when I played on PC, and I don't mind being at that slight disadvantage - still racked up plenty of NW wins. It was the blatant cheaters than made me switch to PS4.
---
Int has a soft cap so getting 40-50 int would be a waste.
---
it's more likely your base is placed near a npc spawn and keeps getting attacked
---
Probably mole rats. They love the brahmin pen.
---
Before camp venders this is where I saw people, in the main crafting areas. While I'm ok with what we have, I do miss seeing people in one main area.
---
Damn. Yeah ok. Need bigger guns next time
---
Are you a Nigerian prince.
---
Helvetia, Top of the World (and sometimes the surrounding area) and Sutton are all good.
---
I'm missing the tenderizer but I haven't competed meat weak a lot.
---
Someone else mentioned they were having issues crafting serums, which also involve flux.
---
Kind of reminds me of that bug from a while back where your on-person and stash inventories weren't seeing eye-to-eye.
---
I *am* gud, thank you very much. I won plenty on PC before switching, and I win plenty after switching. It's just a much more enjoyable experience on PS4 without the cheaters.
---
No one cares about 5 scrip, without 2x xp it's  pointless.
---
Not like the rewards can even be used.
---
Shhhhh, dont ruin my vats build :)
---
They need to add Brahmin Armor to the Atom Shop.
---
I had never heard of this, so I did what anyone would do: I googled it. I laughed... hard. Although Baby Shark would work really well, too!
---
Hey it snows 1-2 days a year in NorCal 😅
---
SBQ
---
Now that’s an incentive to kill as many scorched as possible.
---
Is the scorched challenge for killin 8 million active yet?
---
Yeah cores burn fast, faster if you sprint
---
Awe dang I thought I was mistaken when, during a Scorched Earth event, I had tagged a scorched Yao Gaui and didn't get credit for it though I got the acid and stuff from body
---
If its constant, its the mob spawns. Happens to me all the time in the southern forest.
---
This is also true. I only have the one toon, and she started out before Wild Appalachia. I have been planning another character, so I guess I'll find out just how much easier it is!
---
I don’t think it’s in game. I think it’s just real world knowledge. It would be cool if they used in game items and events
---
I got mine for $2 from Amazon. It was on sale for like 17 bucks and they had a $15 promo on select games , fo76 being one of them. Pretty sure that's the best 2 bucks a ever spent.
---
For me, a firm message that asshattery will not be tolerated.
---
Yea, that makes a lot of sense...
---
I was clearing the shotgun one at Morgantown Airport. I could get close enough to kill them one shot and a lot of them drop 6-8 shotgun shells, so my ammo stock was going up doing that and Melee weapons.
---
Haven't gotten to doing the BP one yet.
---
Break out the Zealot gear booooooiiiiiiiiiiis
---
All I see is a perfect excuse for high explosive cooking
---
Is there lore that says it was supposed to withstand being crushed and not made to carry more ore?  Is crush resistance the same as bullet resistance?
---
If you have a good melee weapon you can kill him before he has time to react.
---
Haha, that's a very potent weapon on a right build.
---
Even with the buttressed mod, trapper armor has very low DR and ER. Like Marine armor, trapper only comes in a sturdy variant, so you cannot get the increased DR from heavy variants. 
---
If you want armor with rad resistance, from the comparisons I've seen, buttressed Marine armor and polished robot armor (light, sturdy or heavy) surpasses buttressed trapper armor on every metric but weight. 
---
And lastly, you look like a hobo.
---
Haha! My controller is wireless and died in the middle of an event yesterday. So here I am, running around with my mouse and keyboard, screaming because I can't figure out how to use a stim. Eff me. lol
---
So say we all
---
not really.. I've got tons of experience and plenty of legendary items
---
I love MEAT WEEK
---
Why not build some sort of trap base? It's not PVP but it could be fun.
---
Fallout Shelter,  Blades,  Fallout 4 Creation Club,   76 made a boat load of money and is still making money , residual sales of prior titles    
---
BGS is a profit machine  They didn't peak 400 employees even during Skyrim.  This isn't EA with a massive burn rate.
---
To be honest, I thought this issue had been fixed until I had the problem last night.
---
It's doesn't even cover the neck of my character,so it looks ugly when used with the raider outfits. Luckily it's usable with the Trapper bandana even though it clips a bit.
---
Yeah, in the OP's link where it shows the purveyor further din tge po age it said "Scorchbeasts" which is why I asked. Must have been a typo. 
---
As far as the OP. 
---
Morgantown airport and AVR medical center also have quite a few scorched around.
---
I'd like to think it's mobs, but I've got turrets up to deal with mobs, and the ones that do spawn are low-level. Right after I built the thing, some 133 LVL guy shows up and started shooting up my place and attacking me. I think I'm going to rebuild the pen, surround it by missle turrets, and see what happens.
---
That’s that Take2 money though
---
I've seen them at random, it's 30min warning.
---
Certain they monitor some health metrics and auto reboot the server instances.
---
thx :)
---
There's enough low level scorched at Poseidon that you could probably complete the shotgun challenge in one run of the powering up event. They have so little hp that even a low level shotty should finish them in one shot, so you don't have to worry about the rubber banding health glitch.
---
Yes. This !
---
i can only hope they do this. i can finally play the game with my nephew who i never get to see and we can talk fallout all day again while we play fallout
---
Mats will never happen due to people placing you in a trap or off a cliff. I made a post a week back of so about getting more actual building pieces. Got a ton of traction. 
---
As it seems though they are working with a really small team. Hence key features being pushed back etc. With wastelanders coming they arent really working on CAMP things. I'm praying that after wastelanders drops they finally come back to revamping certain mechanics like stash an CAMP. I hope they add some new actual building pieces like new walls an roofs an different types of pieces new angles. I love building CAMPS an spend a lot of time on mine. But you can tell they dont have a lot of people working on new items for it since they only seem to be recolor an reskinning everything.
---
This explains so much. It would say I got a sneak attack in, but the enemy would heal away all the damage.
---
Do you think this is intended or a bug?
---
Sometimes that quad bullet legendary perk makes a HUGE difference! My current toon uses a shotgun. Had a double barrel, and it did more damage than my current shotty, but two shots? Dear god. Now I have a 32 shot combat shotgun. Reload? What's that?
---
Afaik there's no confirmation that WV was ever hit by nukes, all the descriptions of seeing mushroom clouds are on the borders of the map.
---
There's one spot near watoga but I think that explosion had a different explanation.
---
Nice fight, why you don’t use explosive baits to make her land more easily ?
---
Did you have a full core?  Do you have core perks?
---
It's actually both in-game and real life questions..
---
It could use the other nuka cola flavours too, each with a unique effect and intensity/size.
---
Ie. nuka cola being the least and quantum being the most large
---
Effects:
---
Nuka wild: increases nuked flora yield 
---
Nuka dark: turns day into night within cloud, mild hallucinations or  random alcohol withdrawal effects 
---
Quantum: turns all hostile creatures within blast into nuka variants
---
i have gotten them from both stings and things and operation tidy this week it is a small chance.
---
Interior walls. 
---
More building sets with more pieces like some of the fallout 4 mods
---
Railings and balconies
---
More stair options
---
Clean Rugs
---
Bigger budget 
---
More in game stuff and not just atom store.
---
Ability to build atom store items at friends settlements.
---
I've been suffering for months. 
---
**Workaround:** assign the item to a favorite bar slot and consume from there. Tedious but worked for me 99.9% of the time. (1:1000 the workaround froze for me too.)
---
VATS also drains cores if you use that.
---
Story of my life, I do that on a weekly basis :P
---
Convert it to a prime Gatling Laser, you can usually get around 2.5x output with super duper.
---
More dmg and more cores!
---
Does obviously require a bit of violet flux.
---
Id guess it's the way it is for performance reasons.
---
2 million as of this morning
---
If you want to cheat all the answers are online. But a lot of them are real work knowledge questions. I liked to think about them an try an figure them out they arent that hard. But if you get stuck you can always look it up.
---
Finance reporting source ?
---
Where do i get technical data?
---
underrated comment
---
Oh ok. I didnt know it was active already. I thought we would have to wait till meat week ended fully.
---
I've been known to kill a Brahmin when I need the meat it provides. Also, you can lock the fertilizer part of it.
---
Not as good as be/aae/je/fe
---
Poseidon power plant, Riverside Manor (the mistress of mystery house), Greg's Mine Supplies, and Sutton are all guaranteed locations.
---
&gt; Beth runs on Azure
---
Really? My understanding was they were on AWS, at least for the servers for 76.
---
&gt; Excavator armour was built to withstand being crushed under thousands of pounds of rocks in the event of a mine collapse
---
Where is this stated?
---
Did I even mention bullet resistance? And yes, there is lore on the crush resistance. It's on the terminals in garrahan hq
---
Turrets don’t work well when you are gone.  Sometimes they don’t work at all. 
---
It seems to me certain items in camps attract more creatures and such.  (Generators,turrets, and Brahmin pen). Also you can shoot the cow if you are another player. But players cannot shoot anything else.  So if crops are destroyed or other items then it HAS to be the npc spawns
---
Just wanna add I too did enjoy Dark Zone in D1; it was uneven, chaotic, unique and awesome.
---
Not to be rude, but fuck nuclear winter the game shouldn't be balanced due to a secondary mode
---
Nice
---
Only the mine
---
50 Cal for DPS.  Gatling for trash.
---
I dunno, I usually play Overwatch (3500 hours) or this (500 hours).
---
This is nice and mellow, Nuke silos are kinda autopilot for me, polar opposite of Overwatch :P
---
I just find it relaxing.
---
Baby shark is an excellent idea as well. I'd love a whole playlist, tbh.
---
How do you kill two enemies in one shot?  Explosive?
---
It's weird because on my main I never get the issue but on my alt it happened twice last night.
---
I thought the same thing honestly, but I won't complain that there's already a good chunk in the progress. I like free stuff as much as the next person
---
This is the type of content that belongs on this subreddit.
---
My personal record is 12min if you ignore the mobs and just rub through :P
---
I've noticed the melee turret issue seems to have gotten worse. I consistently have an issue with the one on the wall going up to the launch prep computer. I can smack them twenty times and they just keep blasting away.
---
I mean the vault didn't really have an experimental operation going on anyway just a purely humanitarian vault so there probably wouldn't be too much lore in the first place
---
I really think those machines will disappear when Wastelanders come. We probably will have a guy buying and selling ammo, like it used to be. 
---
I have 980 hours of playing (since release) and I have never bought ammo. Even when I needed it, I could not afford it. Silly in-game element which is still with us.
---
PC games are notoriously easy to cheat because the end user has access to EVERYTHING the game uses in an entirely open environment (PC). No matter what kind of programming you do, people will ALWAYS find a way around it as long as they have full control of the environment the game is run in. This is why most PC games have to constantly update to patch out the workarounds people find. Or just thrust open the gates and allow modding support.
---
And yet, still powerful.  I extend my offer to you to take it off your hands if not good enough for you if you run across one.
---
Indeed. The rewards are meh though other then the sale. Guess I'll get back on my main for a bit today an slaughter some scorched.
---
You know when you put mods on your armour pieces like lead lined n things like that theres padded which gives you slight resistance from explosions then you got dense which gives you better resistance
---
PS4 itself does support m+kb input (see:Final Fantasy XIV). It's up to the developers to implement support into their games.
---
Seriously, my sniper can usually stand at the queen's feet and remain hidden, so having the prime creatures automatically detect me is a huge pain in the ass.
---
Well, when you say weakest, I assume you meant damage reduction from bullets.
---
"If you aren't noticing the cheaters, maybe it's because you simply aren't good enough to be affected by them."
---
Lolwut
---
They also seem to be drawn to turrets more than players, so if someone has a camp too close to the spawn point they'll go attack that instead of heading to the meat week kill zone like they're supposed to.
---
Try taking the crafting items out of stash an holding them on person to craft.
---
yeah, toxic meta pvp players
---
Well that's just wonderful then lmao I really hope they get on it, it shouldn't cause problems for the game economy either because from what I know items sell for about the same amount across platforms
---
The questions come from the game, the context and the real world. But I had to research and surf the web to find the answers, like going to the library. I did not want to just look for the answers, but the knowledge instead. It was nice.
---
I wonder if the re-log works because the next time you log in you get a better server.
---
Because digital copies don't take up valuable physical inventory space.
---
DO IT!
---
I'd be fine with half assed VR support just to take in the sights of the mire, and se a nuke blast roll through it.
---
Hallelujah
---
Where'd you hear that?  Good to hear, maybe something will actually get done to get the game in better shape.
---
I mean, will it allow us to receive less and deal more damage to them, or will it still only work against players.
---
i thought it was 15% reduction? did it get buffed?
---
Yeah, my answer basically falls into the "because you look like a hobo". I tell myself that it's because I'm RPing a Brotherhood Outcast, but really it's just an aesthetic.
---
Sony stopped being a poopoo head. Nice
---
I just scrap them. I have scrapped so many meat cleavers, I'm starting to feel bad for all the meat cleaver families I have ruined. And I want to apologize to those meat cleaver families.
---
That exists, it's just one if the most sought after combos for melee.
---
Honestly asking for 3 specific rolls and a specific armor type pushes the chance of getting that to 1/10000.
---
I use that combo but wood and I've been looking for ANY left arm that has it unsuccessfully for 2 months.
---
I never checked, but AP consumption is low enough for me to kill the enemies and still have AP left. Don't need it to be plain ZERO: that's just overkill. Besotes, I think all my characters have agility of 12 or more.
---
maths 
---
1.4 million is about the best estimate anyone has been able to say.
---
lets just give them an average profit of say $10 per copy
---
1.4x10 = 14 million 
---
and that was in December

I've played it a number of times, but really disappointed they didn't listen to the clamor to get a PLAN for the Tenderizer or red firework.  I finally got one of the red firework but will never use it since it's the only one I ever got.  But the Tenderizers I got are just taking up space.  I'll try to sell some, modded with Spicy/Salt/Pepper, but honestly they'll probably end up getting scrapped due to space issues.
---
Jeez, I don't know how you all keep up with the demand for PA juice! I'm struggling just to keep on top of my ammo needs, so I won't be adding fusion cores to my list of dependencies any time soon. I don't have any core perks, but I'm unlikely to invest in them as a priority given my dislike for PA. It was a full core, I didn't do any sprinting, but I was doing a lot of VATS-ing as the mine was rife with mole related creatures. I now have a serious appreciation for the simplicity of my main melee build. So low maintenance (if we don't count the ballistic fibre).
---
Time to go full blooded on these scorched
---
Purveyor better give me some RNGoodness then.
---
Im aware of this, but all of them except ps4 are no longer current editions. Xbone, mobile, and switch versions are all bedrock and separate from ps4 and java bc they are not compatible editions. That was the point i was making about crossplay. But like i said, ps4 is switching to bedrock and the only reason for doing that at this point would be crossplay with other bedrock editions.
---
Yes we have killed 2m
---
Get naked. That's what I do. They know the fight Is for real when you take your shirt off.

So, does that mean we can potentially cross platform mule characters if they support it? My PS4 character has so many weapons my XB1 (now main) character needs

at 0 ap cost gun fu literally means "crits forever"
---
You're better off on the trade subreddit that must not be named.
---
The mods on here are having a childish feud so I can't be more specific.
---
Oh, that's interesting. I wonder why they flipped it
---
You must be thinking about the critical meter fills 15% faster prefix. AP cost reduction prefix is 25%.
---
I keep sharing that gif from Hot Fuzz Shame.   
---
Because it a real shame Bethesda ask us to kill of the population of West Virginia
---
you can use the lowest level version and still learn plans.
---
Lol, I wish I had the time that you do
---
Good to know, if only mysterious stranger wasn't so castrated.
---
It is fun till toxicity kicks in. As I said, I used to pvp heavily till I found out I don't want to be labled as a pvper in this game. For some reason, this game's got some of the most toxic pvp player base. Have no idea why. My guess is that since this game is so unstable and allows so many glitches and workarounds, it attracts some abnormal players that want to abuse the shit out of everything
---
Yeah, I've read Wiki section, but really hoped for some more...
---
It's quite useful. I do not need to worry about AP management. I can sprint and jump around all I want and still have near infinite AP for Vats.
---
More pvp to have fun with. I'd be down
---
Switching weapons also does it for me as well as the aid issue. Dropped a nuke and crashed right as I found a 3* ghoul. I used to get the aid crash all the time using radaway or purified water.
---
Maybe this will be my next few tasks... I have completed some of this but I can knock out some more for sure...
---
Stating its a fo76 sub isnt being pretentious. I didnt say it was against any rules, but you’d be more likely to get a quick and accurate response asking that on a minecraft sub. Or just google it. (Thats being snide, not pretentious)
---
 Not sure. It would have required a very different area around Grafton Lake, the dam would be on the north end. It kind of curtails the prospects of any Pitt related content, or at least a logical route to the area should they decide to add it later.
---
Less the cost of funding dev teams for 2+ years, less ongoing hosting, operating and support costs, leaving a net profit of ... maths ?
---
Couldnt agree more, since I am "Wealthy with caps" now seems like all I do is travel around to spend on ammo instead of having to make it. Would be nice to just head to one of those machines to purchase it from. Although the quest of finding it is still kind of fun...
---
If you're a masochist may I suggest pistols?
---
In my case it would be my skirt!😇
---
No. At least not until they can get a handle on PC cheating.
---
Hoping this is what Wastelanders will bring!
---
the accuracy sucks but okay...  better off with furious, especially on an automatic
---
I got mine from the main story line missions somewhere
---
This. Also the investment of producing those physical copies is lost if they don’t sell at all,  so the price gets lowered just to recoup what they can.
---
Of course less all of that. 
---
Don't be so salty  :P
---
76 obviously didn't meet expectations big time
---
But they have plenty of money to fund things like crossplay which was the original intent of this thread
---
Im debating that, a sniper build, or a 1 handed melee build.
---
yup thats where my confusion is, apparently its easy to tell that i rarely use vats lol.  thank you for the response
---
It’s a game about nuking people and the aftermath of a nuclear war
---
They've stated that they're not removing scorched or scorchbeasts (can't remember if they mentioned one or both) in wastelanders.
---
Could be there's *less*, but they won't be removed altogether.
---
I love you :)
---
My junkies explosive double barrel takes a level 91 deathclaw out in 3 shots, but it takes 9-12 for a level 80 scorchbeast. I've seen the glitch where the damage goes down and back up again and I only get it with scorchbeasts and muties now, everything else performs as expected otherwise. I dunno why I always put it down to DR, as in muties and scorched are just more resistant to damage. I feel like it's intentional, when I pop a level 80 scorchbeast it shouldn't die in the first shot. To be fair a glowing deathclaw shouldn't die in 3 but he is on the ground and can easily 2 hit me also. Where as scorchbeasts attack does diddly squat until she poisons so I might take 12 sonic boom attacks also.
---
low key mind blowing thought right here
---
you keep saying "powerful", that word, I do not think it means what you think it means...
---
Im just not into it at all.....
---
So, that doesn't mean that you cant have nice things
---
No their quite shit
---
Awesome. Thank you so much. With that and maxed out super duper, I'll be saving a ton of scrap.
---
I don't have a problem searching the web for articles and such that will help me get an answer. I was just hoping that there were resources in game that lead to an answer. Good to know that they're not all there so I don't spend the next few days looking for them.
---
You gotta pump those numbers up! Those are rookie numbers!
---
I just tested it on xbox, it still does absolutely nothing.
---
He would have to get a explosive gatling plasma to even try to get that armor piece
---
Does it work? Did you try it?  I don't know if it will work but I can try.  I doubt it though, I believe it's like the power armour bug
---
It would kill nuclear winter matches. 
---
They could probably do ps4/xbone crossplay though.
---
So good! I've got a 10mm TSE SMG last night. Two shots explosive is nerfed but is still sooo powerful and cool to use.
---
It doesn’t fit the theme or the aesthetic. You’re playing a game about a nuclear war. That’s like if I played a game about ponies and pretty colors and I want the devs to add in assault rifles and gore. It’s literally the contradicting aesthetic
---
&gt; end user has access to EVERYTHING
---
What makes you think the user has access to everything? All transaction to/from the server is all you need to guard against. Whether this is a full game or just a tic-tac-toe game it's the same concept. Systems are guarded by enforcing proper game rules..
---
ex. Don't accept a move from player until the other play has moved..
---
A full game will just have more "commands" but rules (if important) will be implemented the same.
---
If you get a bloodied damage while aiming crit fill one you can do some serious damage. The explosive makes it easy to lose stealth so I prefer damage while aiming. I hit with 2k often or higher, and even higher if I had stealth perks.
---
Its a tricky question, as compared to what? I would say as a main weapon no...As a backup sure. My TSE or AAE hand mades are much better choices for stealth sniper builds and deal so much more damage, are faster reloading, carry more ammo, etc.
---
nah i’d say add in lever actions and shotguns (time friendly) that don’t one hit kill.
---
I messed with sniper rifles for a while. I had Instigating faster fire rate +1 perception Gauss rifle an Hunting Rifle. They sneak sniper build is really good honestly. One shotting anything.
---
The problem though, is enemies always come in floods so sitting there sniping 1 by 1 takes too long even with a good build an weapons. It is viable but just too slow. I did it for a few months then switched back to my Bloodied faster fire rate vats refill Handmade Commando build. I destroy EVERYTHING so fast it's not even funny.
---
TLDR sniper is viable just too slow.
---
I have a Bloodied HR that will blow the head off about anything short of a Scorchbeast, but rate of fire is a “thing”. 
---
When the “clever-girl” Yao Guai you didn’t see until the last moment is charging you you want a semi auto like a handmade or combat rifle.
---
Pew-pew-pew and down she goes.
---
How about an added mechanism that as long as someone is still banging the drum the prime beasts bypass everything else to get there?
---
nice! i wasn't aware that the forest mask dropped from one of the main quests -- most likely the enclave. i have a new baby character. hopefully, it'll drop for that one. off to the grind. thanks for the input.
---
then why do you want to lower the cost?
---
Please, what is pink sprinkles? I've bought all the feminine stuff i could find in the atom shop including the pip boy. Was this a limited time paint? I need a pink power armor Barbie for my wasteland Barbie dream house 😄
---
Yes, totally. Was hunting Yao Guai so they were not welcome.
---
is 20 a lot? genuine question
---
My 1* Instigating .50 cal hunting rifle one shots anything level 65 and less other than scorchbeasts...damage output as a sniper is 450-750+
---
It could be the case that at the level you are playing at, a good player and a cheater look the same, and kill you equally as fast. Not that I would assume anything about your skills, but you started throwing shade with the 'git gud,' and there's actually a better argument for you being the one who needs such gittin' :-)
---
Yeah, sony "plays nice" in exchange for exclusive shit.
---
See: the new Modern Warfare Survival mode being Epic Games Grade stupid for PS4 only for a whole YEAR! ON A YEARLY SCHEDULE RELEASE SERIES.
---
Thanks for you reply, I appreciate it.
---
I really can't comment on that, as I have almost no experience with pistols, VATS, bloodied and unyielding (playing de facto very opposite build - PA, ADS, full health, vamp/explo/aa HW)... Just thought it would be cool to try it out for a change and utilize all that arsenal I have amassed. Still not sure about going bloodied though :) Really not my style.
---
I haven't yet I'm out doing some stuff. But there was a similar bug a while back where crafting items in stash wouldn't register. If you held stuff on your person it would void the bug. I'd try it with one craft to see if it works but if you want in a few hours I can try it out an report to you.
---
Depends on what you have. A regular hunting rifle is less than ideal in any situation. They're good sniping weapons, I have an instigating ffr hunting rifle that deals some damage when you're stealth sniping. The fire rate is just too slow, even with ffr, to be viable anywhere else, especially as a main rifle. Take a hunting rifle into The Whitespring and you're ghoul meat.
---
I believe it's all atom shop items.the more challenges you complete the more atoms you earn = free skins.I just got a Mr pebbles plushie plan as well.im not gay,I just think Mr pebbles is a cool concept.

crossbow/ thrown weapons
---
I have a aae handmade on my main but i wanna fuck about and have a chill build on my alt
---
Same here.. when bio scanning before launching a nuke, if my controller will not center right... I have to unplug it to stay in the scanner.. but if I plug it back in and it does not take the controller right away.. I have issues getting back into the PA.
---
The controls and setting on PC vs console would always be an issue.
---
I would like to see cross-save, where I can use the same toon to play with my Xbox and PC friends, but cross-play for most games would not be a fair exchange.
---
I haven't cheated on a test  in my life and I don't fancy the idea of starting now. Yeah a lot of the questions are common sense or just well known facts but then there are some that are more trivial. Mainly the codebreaker section where it asks you to decipher something.
---
Materials like screws and springs come from typerwriters, pepper shakers, clipboards, toy cars and trucks etc... Player vending also has tons of that stuff if you have the caps. At your level I would run the mine next with White springs a few times inside and out and sell everything the mole miners drop, EVERYTHING. You can easily claim the 1500 caps a day that way and have the money to get the materials you are after. You can google your build, but you will want rifleman in strength, you will also want, enforcer for the shotgun.
---
I don't think grenadier works on explosive weapons. I have a TSE 10mm sub and it's one of my favourite weapons. I use maxed out bloody mess, demolition, adrenaline, commando and fire proof and it absolutely wrecks. Make sure you put a good receiver on it too.
---
Yeah, right now - probably flogging the same audience 
---
If Wastelanders hits well - I could see them looking into it.  
---
And yeah, they really need to get a handle of the cheat engine.  I love NW but its deflating when one of those asshats comes running through just auto-killing you
---
I disagree. The point of the game, as it's told in the intro, is to "rebuild America." We tend to congregate and build cities, which the game doesn't allow us to do.
---
Obviously this wouldn't work with the technical aspects of the game, seeing as your camp can't rely on someone else's camp when they log off, but it's a decent idea for the private servers.
---
It means it takes so much work to maintain one of the meta builds.
---
All these stealth commando bloodied tse handmade people who have the same perks as every other player like them, spend 8 hours a day making ammo, and then get to grief some level 20s or sumn.
---
Awesome location idea. Though this post would work better on r/fallout
---
I'm bored at work...
---
I figured it was another "feature". I'll often get the no ap regen or no ap usage bug while killing the SBQ. Guess I'll have to try out some of my other rifles. Got a BE 25vats pipe revolver from the Purveyor that would be a monster with all that AP.
---
Pip boy damage number is outgoing damage.  Multipliers then determine actual damage.  I believe you get bonuses from sneak/headshot/etc first, then that number is input into a formula that take into account the enemy's resistances to give you actual damage dealt.  Thing is, with shotguns, there's damage calculations for each projectile. And unfortunately, if the incoming damage is less than the resistances of the target, the damage gets reduced much more than otherwise.  Exponential returns, basically, for raising outgoing single projectile damage.  So shotguns, miniguns, etc never achieve the one shot potential that rifles do vs targets with any semblance of armor.  This could easily be solved by granting flat armor pen via perk cards/weapon mods, but so far everything seems multiplicative.
---
Figuratively lol
---
I got a furious, ffr ultracite gatling just around the time they fixed energy weapon damage. The thing can melt some enemies pretty quickly. I'm just hoping for a prime receiver drop as well as the weapon plan itself to really deck it out
---
Would be great to walk up on a group of super mutants and blast them with a pink .50 cal
---
I can't find anything stating either way, but given the small beta exclusive it wouldn't surprise me if they were using Azure. Azure is usually better (cheaper) for large, long term compute infrastructure, while AWS is better for data hosting and short term compute, like stuff you need to ramp up to meet demand or whatnot, to a certain extent anyway, they are fairly equivalent. Just depends on who was willing to give them a better deal.
---
If the volume gets really large both get prohibitively expensive unless you can negotiate custom rates.
---
Think just before and after the patch where it fixed AA on energy maybe wouldve done it, but think a fixer or bear arm looks the best bet atm.   Dont feel like anyones bothered by plasma much anymore.
---
MORE HAIR THAT ISN'T UGLY
---
They're perfect for PVE until you go up against boss enemies like Sheep or SBs.
---
Use sneak attacks to 1shot all common mobs from outside their detection range. This is why you get the hunting rifle so early on. You can climb to level 50 without getting hit if you try.
---
Because boss enemies have such high HP pools, the bolt and semi rifles won't have half the required DPS to blow them away. You also suffer from slower critical refill, which is your bread and butter for bursting bosses. Try Four Leaf Clover or Psychopath to recoup.
---
It’s a decent number for scaling up - churn in game dev can be high, burn out is normal, people often leave and change so I would expect some might be replacement as well.
---
Some have a cap for certian things like CHR I hit the vendor sell/buy cap pretty easily.
---
sauce?
---
Cloaking seems to be helpful in melee - when you are hit, you disappear for a second or so - enough to sidestep the attacking critter and attack from a different angle...
---
when you disappear, they pause, so you can get another hit or two from a different direction without a return hit.  depending on your weapon, that's enough for a kill.
---
\+ special may help offset a - special due to a mutation.
---
Mutants may or may not be helpful - if its literal anti-Super Mutant, usefulness is limited, but if its "if you are mutated" its much better (IMHO)
---
I think you'd have a lot more fun with a lever action rifle. There's not enough place to snipe in this game. Something that comes to mind is the outside of west tek. Thats fun for sniping but most other places you get into close quarters and it's just not fun with a slow rate of fire weapon. Lever action has the range to snipe, and the speed to go close up with enemies.
---
Curly bun was a good start.
---
Endurance. The only stat that unyielding doesn't boost.
---
Morgantown Airport. Poseiden Energy plant. Sutton. Helvetia. Are always full of scorched.
---
Fair
---
Interest?
---
Well it depends on what they do. If they are all gameplay programmers 20 is a lot of new members. If they are scattered across all elements, the improvement might not be as easy to spot but they sure can make a difference either way.
---
aahh you guys didnt play any of them? For example fortnite, if you have a pc xbox ps4 pc team, you will be playing against crossplatformers. If you have xbox xbox xbox xbox team you will be matching with xboxers. Simple as that.
---
Crowned boss is dead, which stops respawns for a time...gives you a break while you are collecting flux
---
Arktos maybe?
---
I was a sniper, and my weapon from ~50 to 150 was a 1* instigating hunting rifle.  It killed stuff easy, as long as you were out of 'danger' and there weren't a lot of them.  Sneak + headshot + any sneak attack multiplier will kill stuff easily.
---
If there's more than 1 mob though, you'll need to 1) be fast, or 2) be able to hide again (covert operative helps).  Sniping outside West Tek is cake.  Sniping *inside* West Tek takes  whole lotta work, luck, and skill.  Without stealth, it wouldn't be fun at all.
---
I swapped from sniper to commando.  I haven't missed it a bit.  But it was certainly viable for somewhat simple encounters.
---

Ghoals are located there.
---
I know OP asked for pink and purple but you can make stuff that's more aesthetically pleasing, or feminine, as have it still fit the FO theme. I think OP is also asking for game "stuff" that is traditionally seen as appealing to women in games, such as makeup and hair items, etc. 
---
Also, to speak on the topic more generally, people seem to disagree on whether things like houses should look tore up from the floor up or neat...in my mind, if I've been out of a vault and running around looting the world for a couple years (in game time) I think "I" would have had enough time by now to find preserved/nicer items and materials to make my house look nice.
---
What should i go for then? Im new player just interested on it
---
You're over thinking an blowing it out of proportion way too much. My main is a bloodied ff vats build an I dont spend "8 hours a day crafting ammo" an I can destroy anything. Of course people are gonna go for the good builds. Why would you want to gimp yourself? Other builds are completely viable an you can do whatever you want. Junkies is far from "meta". Why even ask what to do if you arent gonna take suggestions an try them?
---
Rule 34
---
Yeah no kidding. My mains a bloodied ff vats handmade rifle build an I have zero issues with ammo an dont spend 8 hours a day crafting like he claims it takes. I craft ammo in one 30-40Min period for a whole week or more. Ammo Smith super duper an lucky hole plus Grafton an I'm good for a while. Hes trolling or just daft.
---
Instead of grinding and putting in the time to find good gear you can just go online and buy the gear you want. You can go on eBay and buy legacy weapons and just go around destroying people with one or 2 shots. I have played this game since it came out and I have yet to find a god tier gun. So basically what I’m saying is the legendary and trading system in this game is what needs to change to better the PVP.
---
Once you've selected a card, its yours forever.  unlike previous versions of fallout, where any perk you select is active all the time, FO76 makes you choose which perks are active at any give time.   If you swap out a perk card, you don't lose the card itself, just its effect.  
---
You are limited to something like 57 perk points, you will not be able to keep all desired perks active all the time, so you will need to swap out perks depending on what you are doing.
---
You can swap as many cards from as many categories as needed to accomplish a task.   (I swap out 4 cards from 2 categories when I craft ammo)
---
For example, hard bargain (Charisma) reduces buy from and increases sell to prices at bot vendors.  Lone wanders (also charisma) increased damage if you are playing solo.
---
You don't shop and fight at the same time, so you don't need HardBargain equipped unless you are buying/selling.  Before you shop,  unequip lone wander, equip hard bargain.
---
when you are done, swap the cards back.
---
Rainbow Unicorn 50 cal, with confetti particles when you fire it
---
I didn't know people actually used those things..
---
Ok I've been a no lifer in survival mode since day 1, leveled all my alts there, even have one that I delete and start over again just to hang out in low level areas, so I am very familiar with the caps and damage nerfs and the effects they had on combat. I can tell you that the changes they made actually just made the divide between the well geared and not even wider than before. The caps were fine, but the damage reductions killed it. It was a hot mess, so bad it seems intentional. Not because of the caps, but the extreme damage nerfs. 
---
Before even an average geared straight forward build player could take down a Meta player if they played their cards right and strategized. You see because the battle starts LONG before you even pull your guns out. The gunfire is the END of the fight, especially since you know it's a one hit. I don't want to list out my strategies as I consider them to be trade secrets but trying to outsmart stronger players was my bread and butter. 
---
Sorry it's so long lol. It happens when I start talking about survival mode. I don't really remember what brought us here but thanks for listening. By the way it's funny you mention the division, I just got division 2, just made lvl 30 the dark zone is what made me interested. Been hanging out in there hoping to get railroaded by some pkers haha. But I am seeing a trend on reddit (maybe other places too idk) in the pve / PVP drama, including being jealous of resources being used for game modes they don't like, and saying PVP is unfair and it's just gear. It's like same shit different game. Maybe that just comes with the open world PVP territory. Seems like everyone pvps differently and they get something different out of it.

---
Can we still trigger collision course non stop? That would help...
---
Yes, take all my atoms
---
https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloody+Mess
---
I prefer a lever action rifle, but I think the hunting rifle is good for lower level players.
---
I think this won't work with AMD chips, it's only for people having this problem with Intel ones, but if you disable hyper threading, limit your cores to 2~4 (some people said 8, didn't test myself) and limit particle effects in the .ini (it's 750 by default, I set it to 75), it *should* mitigate the problem.
---
thanks!
---
Yes. It says so in the description.  Its 15% multiplicative with all other damage sources.
---
Nope, but I'm sure you can repair it again after a few shots.
---
Try heavy guns. Get a .50 cal and a Gatling gun. Live in your power armor. It’s extremely powerful.
---
Again this is a "it depends" question...Depends on your build and what you are doing. For me as stealth / shooter build, I like Psycho, psychostats, etc....Melee would be something different.
---
it's partly the rewards but it's also over saturated, it just keeps popping off...
---
10mm isnt exactly the gun I would select if I was looking to one shot things.  It's a high fire rate low damage base weapon good for head shotting low armor mobs like ghouls or humanoid scorched.  The AA helps with this but not enough to one shot a honey beast, let alone a bear.  Sorry bud.
---
Also, if you want to one shot things you need a specific build which includes: at LEAST 6/9 gun perk, bloody mess, nerd rage, and adrenal AND be below 20% health.  You also need an instigating or bloody weapon.  I assume junkies with 5 addictions might work too but I refuse to make my toon an addict on purpose to find out 🤷‍♂️  Vats with concentrated fire for headshots also helps but isnt necessary if your aim is good or you hate vats.
---
There are some exceptions to this like gauss rifles which when bloodied hit like a truck even without rifleman perks but you still need nerd rage adrenal bloody mess 20% health etc.
---
Im not going anywhere near that place and risking loosing my gear or characters.....
---
He doesn't want to spend "8 hours a day crafting ammo".
---
woaah thats so easy i think, but not earning one i think. I saw in youtube that a guy opens like card package in level 2. Im level 2 aswell, is that free?
---
Best thing I've found for high level Yogis is an AA LMG.
---
It is planned for next month does not mean you get to play it in a month. It could be in 55 days.
---
Im on PS4 and ive yet to see any roleplayers. We need a roleplay community/server. Would be so fun.
---
Why should he or anyone do that? I don’t. Never did
---
You died after the event? Or during? You dont drop junk during the event. You also need to do enough dmg to the queen to get loot. Shooting her once or twice wont work.
---
you do realize you it's optional for console players whether they want to play with PC?
---
It's to do with the daily you get from the golf course in the western side of the Ash Heap, some Mr Handy gets you to fetch him steak. It's cool though I wish there were more large herds of Radstag about.
---
400lbs stash, now that was pure nightmare.
---
Definitely my favorite time was capturing workshops and actually getting lots of resources. All those PVP times at ammo factory was glorious. Now nobody takes workshops.
---
No clue bud. Read up in the comments where I suggested something an read the replies. He claims it takes 8 hours a day of crafting ammo to maintain a "meta build".
---
There's no tenderizer plan, just the mod plans.
---
Because with your idea your deposit box has to be loaded every time your character is loaded just like the rest of your inventory. If you put stuff on a mule it only has to be loaded when you load that character.
---
Okok. Maybe I'm averse to change. Maybe I'm not used to having to cookie cutter into builds to be viable. Idk how to gather steel or lead. I'm lost. Sorry.
---
it's an option in games where it is currently available, you can opt out of playing with PC and still play with the other console...
---
Add the Bleeding effect to them if you hit something. 
---
The Sheepsquatch throwing knife is pretty strong. I love em.
---
it is still very common for weapons that hit multiple times per shot, such as shotguns and lasers with a splitter.
---
it absolutely sucks. I shoot an airborne SB for half its health and when I look back from dealing with its spawns it's back at 90%.
---
oh your shitting me? So even without power they can still purchase? So now I am replacing the garage door with a solid wall you are telling me to keep people out? Sheesh...This is getting more and more difficult...
---
Thanks mate.
---
Really? I only have the space for the game on one of my drivers, and haven't had issues before.  
---
I have now reinstalled the launcher. No issue. But when I tried to install the game, same issue.
---
If you get a good one they can work in a pinch but I firmly believe the Lever Action and Gauss Rifle are vastly superior.  Hell, if you could silence the railway rifle it too would be better.  Already has a faster fire rate, higher damage, cheaper ammo and a hidden armor piercing trait.  Hunting rifle def needs a little love.
---
I just got D2 because the dark zone just seems so cool. I heard survival was a blast, kind of hope too see something like that in D2 as well.
---
Good question.  I'm always hidden and seeing enemies heal a portion of the damage I inflict on them is an extremely common occurrence for me.  I certainly notice it happening during events where other people are around.
---
Or once you kill the queen you go to farm all the dead enemies but they start disappearing...
---
This happened to me once but with super mutants. No matter how many I killed, it seemed to be an unlimited respawn glitch of some kind. I eventually ran away...
---
Agreed, Poseidon is filled with them especially during the powering up Poseidon event.
---
Simple answer? "BeUcAuSe iTs NoT fAlLoUt" Asshats who never touched the game shitting on it because its different despite being par the course for bethesda in terms of everything else. Speaking as someone who used to shit on it for the same reasons till I decided to play the damn thing.
---
Cool thanks.
---
There are several notes in-game that *feel* like they are meant to be sent through a *(datemined)* mailbox system.
---
Thinking of "Hey Man", "You've Been Insulted", "Watch Out!", The I.O.Us, "No More IOUS!"
---
Had this same thing happen too. I claimed posidon work shop and made myself 30 fussion cores and a buttload of lead. Very nice when it occurred, and super glad I took advantage of it.
---
They are supported by data. I just told you. I've done it for years. Stop taking your personal issues with intolerance out on people who don't have beef with lgbtq. Seems like you are trying to make enemies.
---
I hope you find peace in life. Most people dont give a single fuck what they are called. The rest really so and we respect that. I call my trans friends their preferred pronouns and everyone else whatever i please because any who knows me knows i love them and am playful.
---
I didn't switch to assassins sent because I am just too addicted to unyeilding. I found that even if I could take more hits with high health I'd just get staggered in place until I died even with pneumatic mod. Plus my strength was definitely evading hits (not just using dodgy but like actually evading the best I could) and the bigger pool of AP really compliments that playstyle. Yeah I hated that it was pelt each other with bullets or pull out a railgun or in your case a legacy. It was so much better before even with the one shots imo. At least average players with average weapons could achieve lethality if they wanted to.
---
This would be awesome!
---
I would love to see a nuke spawn rad storms.
---
PvP at this point is a waste of time unless you have communicated with the players your fighting with some rules to make the pvp actually fun. I was pvping with some clans and we all agree'd no handmades, teslas, lasers, stealth boys and chameleon and it was a blast. People were using melee, fatmans, grenades and pistols.  Was really fun. Nuclear Winter though is where its at. The new map is really good.
---
Heh, reached 300 because of my friends like to grind a lot for legendaries, and because of that I ended up leveling up very quickly. It was before the XP nerf. Leveling definitely goes a lot slower now.
---
Search for Wasteland Estates Homeowners Association, large cool group...
---
the game is crashing/freezing. something like that. they'll redirect your report to developer team, allegedly.
---
it's really weird this is happening on xbox, though. at least it should put some pressure on them to finally fix it.
---
Lol yes I've been encountering these herds since meat week 1. 
---
I was trying to sneak and take photos - but they all aggro'd at the exact same time and charged at me so I requested an orbital strike and wiped the slate.
---
Now thats a way to be a raider.
---
Anybody know of automatic .38 rifles? Dude....I have dropped thousands and thousands of 38 rounds because nothing but pistols use them and I dont pistol.
---
10mm smg's recoil like mad.  for best results you want concentrated fire -&gt; headshots.  Night and day difference.  
---
As a random tip it's better to take rank 1 of damage perks before additional ranks as the first rank is more valuable:
---
* Commando 3 + Master commando 3 = 40% damage for 6 ranks
---
* Comando2 + Expert commando 1 + Master commando 3 = 45% damage for the same 6 ranks.
---
It's not a deal breaker, just a way to eke out a bit more damage for the same cost.
---
Done that.
---
Yeah I had to move my CAMP on top of Seneca rocks. Never had an issue of fast traveling to it until this last week. Didnt move anything an now I cant fast travel to it at all. Tried moving the camp unit an didnt change anything. I loved my camp an had to move it.
---
Ok ok. You mind if I dm you to uhh learn
---
I feel a complaint needs to be filed with the Nuka-Cola delivery team. They definitely service other areas much more frequently
---
I've enjoyed meat week mostly because I roll solo and it gives me a rare opportunity to see other people and unite for a single cause. Sure, I see people around camps but I tend to battle alone otherwise.
---
Its a nice idea, but I really dont wanna play with all the hackers on pc
---
Believe it or not this happens to most of us on the regular. The buildable and desirable areas on the map are actually not nearly as large as the map itself, so it’s bound to happen eventually — even in remote sections. Just log out and log back in or select “find another world” and you’ll be just fine.
---
The excavator armor was engineered differently than combat armor so it provides different protection. Black titanium may be present but may not be built in the necessary matrix to protect from knives or high velocity projectiles. There are armors in the real world that protect better against knives and others against ballistics and others against fire and others against explosives. They may be made of similar materials, but the way they are processed has an effect on their function/application.
---
none, sadly.
---
Last time someone opened up on me with their explosive gatling plasma I walked toward them and the killed themselves instantly lol. Other than that I fight back, or just like, ignore it and go about your day.
---
I want long hairs for my male character...
---
Problem could be that Flatwoods literally starts every new players quest to cook Ribeye 🥩
---
I am curious of your opinion of the word Dude. Do you believe it to be a sexual term, neutral or both.
---
Keep in mind,  Connotation is incredibly vital to language and can change the entire definition
---
Yeah bud send me a message an I can help you out.
---
You on?
---
Say this "i dont got time for little fish". Always gets them roaring.
---
thanks for the info!!! it is appreciated!
---
Same....
---
There was no quest marker and no bag everywhere. The Guai killed me because it crippled both my legs, so no bag in the air. It's possible that someone else might have taken it, but they must have been the sneak kind because I haven't seen anyone around, nor on the map.
---
I really wanted to get rid of that quest...
---
So I'm still studying and testing things with PvP engagements. I'm noticing almost all pvp players cloak when they crouch. Is this a "staple" of PvP. I currently do not have any chameleon pieces. I can never kill players who are cloaked.
---
Thats literally the only thing we get in the atom shop
---
It weights less than 2 pounds so why not. The ammo doesn't look like it takes to many resources to make. Before this I was rolling with a regular Gatlin gun because I thought it had the best value for ammo and damage. The 25% extra speed eats through ammo quick but it shreds things. We'll see how resource sufficient it is but this and my gatlin gun could be a great combo.
---
😂 what came first, the tea bag or the milk? 🤔
---
100% it's mobs with me. Lvl 5 and under. Turrets ignore them most of the time.
---
Most likely a bug, it has happened to me more than once. I have gotten both the marker and no marker and gone back and not found a bag. I always try to not carry important items but understand your position and it sucks...I have lost stable flux this way more than once right after the SBQ event
---
It's probably a high tier roll, not a God tier roll considering the current state of weapons.  I still use my TSE 50cal though, it's a great weapon.  Plus that weight reduction is nice.
---
Shotguns, tesla rifles, flamers, and plasma flamers are basically unusable because of bugs around damage. Enemies will heal back most of it, or it can just trigger the damage bug and make ALL of your ranged weapons utterly worthless until you leave the server. And god forbid you use any explosive weapons because if there is any surface within 5 feet of you, they WILL be magnetically attracted towards hitting that just so the shot can kill you
---
I think it might be a different thing, because normally when the server message happens you have a half an hour. This was over an hour with just me on it, no server shutdown message.
---
What do you mean you select a perk from the perk pack to keep? I’ve always kept all of mine
---
came across a ghoul that i was able to kill that then came back to life and completely invincible shot off its head he come back to life only way i was able to get it to stop coming after me was shooting off both legs. thats been my only experience other than some enemies laying on the ground and move around that way.
---
Nice, and with the weight reduction too.  Congrats dude.
---
Do you have the plans for it? Otherwise you can get them at the scouts camp shooting range
---
I meant, more than normal, even for a bloody build. I blame it on not sleeping well for a few nights and being up late. :p
---
plasma cores are super cheap and easy to make.  
---
The Gat Plas has some of the cheapest ammo in the game.  
---
Copper, Lead, Plastic, Nuclear Waste.
---
YES.
---
This "cloak" is 1 piece of Chameleon Legendary Armor. It is a staple. If your not crouching in pvp, ANYBODY can use VATS and simply aimbot you for free from across the map. You literally cannot pvp without crouching unless your using a stealth boy. 
---
Easiest way to kill someone using a stealth boy or crouching with chameleon is a Tesla Rifle or Explosive weapon shooting at the ground. Grenades work wonders also.
---
I think sheepsquatch are always legendary.  Ive never seen on that wasn't.  As far being tougher, they're waaaaay higher in damage resistance and hp than hermit crabs.
---
The evolutionary record suggests that the domestication of dairy cows began slightly after the invention of the first Barry's Teabag, approximately 16000 years ago.
---
Fair play to Barry.
---
And howya, norniron :) South coast here (Waterford) :)
---
Bags can be flaky.  I've dropped things on the ground that never appeared.  Not sure it's ever happened when I died, but it's the same basic idea.
---
Sometimes the bag is just underground, but you should have seen a death marker if that was the case.  If it's close, you can sometimes drop something minor on the ground, and if the bag for that is close enough to your other bag, the contents will be together.  But I don't think that would have worked for you.
---
We have exclusive Atom Shop content?
---
Damn, it's that low? I swear the drop rates on some of these things...I got an urban mask from watoga dropped connection back in like January, I assumed they just removed it from the drop pool. I also feel bad about selling my second ultracite gatling laser plans for only 8k, apparently that was an absolute steal and I'll probably never find those plans again
---
take your time, look at youtube videos, there are a ton of them that explain the perks well. You dont lose anything but you can make wrong choices that you would have to wait until you are level 50 or higher to correct so choose wisely when you are at lower level. Try to nail down what you really want to be character wise...
---
I think when private servers come out we could see such things.. however if consoles even get private severs that’s another question? Probably not! 🙁
---
 I dont have plans but might head to the scout camp tomorrow
---
That's something I'd love to watch
---
I keep hearing about this glitch but it doesn't seem to be affecting me (on ps4). Combat shotgun with extra projectile is my go-to close range gun, and I can kill anything with it pretty fast. A lvl60 or so scorched only takes 4, maybe 5 shots to the face to defeat
---
*give this ole salt a raise*
---
No worries, I'm not on a timetable (obviously) lol
---
Get power user max level. Double core duration I PA and 1000 rounds in gat lasers. Be careful though, gat lasers have a bug where they randomly eject a core and reload a fresh one. You don't lose the core but now my inventory is filled with partial cores.
---
Off I go into nw so thank you.
---
We'll all have our turn. Free states has stuff. Raiders lots too (probably more relevant right now with wastelanders coming). Vault-tec has a few things.
---
Have BoS got much out yet? I can't think of anything.
---
Seriously serious, dead ass.
---
and a 30% chance to double that with Super Duper
---
I love when bloodied players deny how often they actually die...  I used to run bloodied, had all the mitigating perks and mutations, still died a lot, since I switched to a high endurance toon I rarely die, I can take all the hits
---
Ok. Cool. What about perk cards? I have 10 points in agility. I'm using action boy, marathoner, sneak,  and dodgy. Is sneak beneficial if I have a chameleon piece or can I put on born survivor in place of sneak?
---
I play both and I couldn't disagree more. Sure they are both PVP but they couldn't be more different from each other. You can't compare a match based PVP mode with a open world PVP in an RPG. Both require a different skill set, different reflexes and different strategies. But even beyond that the point of each mode is different. NW is about the match, there's a clear way to win, competition is a huge component. Survival was a PVP sandbox with no real way of winning because competition wasn't the point. Much more open ended and unpredictable. And I don't want to hear that NW somehow takes more skill and it's always even playing field because you still have perk cards that increase the amount of damage you do and special weapons that are stronger then the others. I say this as someone who likes both modes and felt that having both available gave a nice well-rounded PVP experience even if you vastly preferred one over the other.
---
Pretty dude ive soloed novice raids at least 6 times and have yet to lose anything
---
Can't you put vendor machines in workshops and then just sell the materials you get from the work shop and other stuff you want to sell? Now if you were able to build a little town with friends that would be awesome.
---
That was my plan too. I only made it to level 18 before I quit lol.
---
it's not terrible, but the nerf was pretty bad, of all the the only effects worse are the enemy specific ones or the ones that only work some of the time
---
Happened to me an hour ago for the first time in a while. It was particularly annoying as a couple of players were using my camp and I had to shut the game down with no warning.
---
Lmao I still haven’t been able to kill a SBQ always a server crash
---
A nuka-nuke.
---
I'm on board with this.
---
Know how hard the falloff is after soft cap?
---
That sounds suspiciously like science and education. Us ‘Murcans don’t like that kind of talk.
---
Power Armour Museum perhaps?
---
Someone will do that lol
---
ohhh thats hell of hard but i can try to help, as a 2 level
---
Yeah, I'll be online all weekend.  Stop by and Happy Halloween!
---
I found them fun to note a few divergence points, like the US running on direct current.
---
If you want to read some wild real history read up on the AC/DC current (not the band) “battles” back when electricity was catching on.  It was pretty gruesome in some cases.  Oh fine, I’ll do it, and shocking!
---
one of those days where things barely match up for your Level while 3/3, can't wear power armor cuz I need to wear a full clown suit or something...well fed/intoxicated/diseased isn't available. But I **had** to wear my power armor cuz the crazy mirelurks are there (my armor isn't great yet), so I ended up having to use a hatchet I was lucky enough to have from a scorched earlier for "While wielding an axe". It was a slow kill...
---
Sneak effects how far away someone can see you on the compass when your in combat. Your enemy's perception also effects this distance. 
---
Perk cards are subjective to the build/weapon type your using. 
---
I'd say some staple pvp perks are the following:  
---
1. Adamantium Skeleton 
---
2. Serendipity 
---
3. Fireproof 
---
4. Dodgy 
---
5. Action Boy/Girl 
---
6. Class Freak (helps reduce the hp loss from adrenaline reaction) 
---
7. Evasive 
---
The rest of your perks are based on your build. Some people like to use Barbarian. Iron Clad and max there resistances. Some people use First Aid / Born Survivor so stims save them. 
---
Just know in pvp its a kill or be killed kinda world right now.
---
Thank you!  I'll post a full walk though with some spooky music this weekend.  Happy Halloween!
---
They could of been sneaking so you never saw anyone on the map. Also, you'll never get rid of the quest... Its a daily.
---
Got 2* VFFR handmade yesterday
---
It's very possible they use AWS for load balancing/CDN, then route it wherever (Azure or AWS or even their some of their own hardware) for the actual backbone. 
---
I'm fairly sure that as far as load balancing &amp; CDN goes AWS is vastly superior since they have servers pretty much everywhere so that would make sense, you'd want the latency to be as low as possible. 
---
I'm going to start doing this too from now on, since I've been curious what kind of latency I get. 
---
What's your typical average?
---
Wow, it is a small world.  I released an album last year and I have another new one coming out next Halloween.  Happy Halloween!
---
Yes you can learn mods from scrapping but what you learn applies only to that part of armor. So if you scrap a arm piece you will only learn a mod for that armors arm. 
---
I think. Also getting mods off armor is much harder than getting them for weapons in my personal exp.
---
Yeah the recoil is for real! It takes a bit of practice but once you get the hang of it its great. You just have to adjust your rhythm if you are used to the handmade.
---
Your correct, keep was not the best work choice.  
---
Equip is the appropriate word.
---
Seen a super mutan kill a mole rat and t posed after tbh it was dope xD
---
Ha, well there's only so much time to play and also other games except F76, so I'll see how does it fare... I'm also kinda limited by the pistols already in my posession, as I don't have much time nor will to trade anymore - TSEs, QEs, AAEs, that kind of stuff.
---
Nah, infiltrating the seditionists is legit. That way we know who to assassinate \^\^
---
I use a lot of the plants, but I don't see them as feminine, personally speaking. I use them to breath life into my camp, to make the place feel lived in.
---
If only they had an in-game store that generated them money to put back into the game.
---
*oh wait*
---
Haha that’s pretty funny
---
lol this bug is one of the only issues that got trading the strangler power armor on the main trading sub a warnable offense. The other trigger being that the mods didn't realize you couldn't just drop to trade, you had to do an actual exploit. So I don't mind it, most of the users didn't do the raid enough times to have it so it shouldn't come up. There's a similar bug with some legacy weapon effects
---
Poison resistance is different than the disease resistance your referring to.
---
Well knowing this I'm going to try it with born survivor instead and see if my success rate goes up.
---
This is what i was going to say. Even last time with double exp people lost interest before the event ended. At normal exp and with no changes made to it at all, im not surprised no one is doing it.
---
I produce it from start to finish.  I have a home studio where I write, record, mix, and master.  Thanks for checking it out and Happy Halloween!
---
Same, the only speculation I have is based off of Warframe's circumstances. They have had some pretty very game breaking issues on their major updates. So they usually wait until the finished pushing out all hotfixes before launching the update on console.
---
RNG gonna RNG.
---
Yes, I have also made some questionable decisions, hindsight is a wonderful thing 🤔
---
For a better chance, just farm materials. Then, once you have enough to craft a huge amount of armor, find a server that is dropping vanguard. You'll have a much higher chance of crafting the vanguard effect
---
They didn’t say how many they fired though. We could be at a net negative.
---
definitely about learning the mods from armor - percentage seems much lower to learn from armor over weapons. i knew you can learn mods from scrapping. i just wanted to know if you can learn mods of other pieces from scrapping other parts of the armors. i swear i learned a marine torso mod from scrapping a leg. thanks for your input. i would rather create a bunch of arms instead of torsos to scrap because they require less resources.
---
No one stays to collect flux for more than 2 minutes then the whole zone is a ghost town.
---
I think that one is just straight up cursed. My game has frozen 3 times since BETA started, and two of them were during that Primal Cuts this past week.
---
You're correct. I learned most of the mods for Marine armor only crafting and scrapping arms.
---
if I'm not mistaken the only way to get legendary effects on solar is the legendary modules
---
Well screw that, suppose I'll just have to wait and hope that Bethesda actually allow the forest mask to also be worn with hats
---
That explains the last few meat cooks I've been in.
---
I’ll be sure to check them out!
---
Fuck the crossplay give us Actual mods on ps4
---
Legendary modules are part of the crafting materials. I'm saying don't craft the armor as soon as you get materials together, save them up to do it all once. You'll find more of your armor has more effects in common on average including the Vanguard effect
---
ok, cool. i'm not crazy. thank you for responding. have to make a bunch of combat arms once i get home from work. ultra-light torso has been avoiding me for forever.
---
Only 3 freezes since beta? That's like a miracle, my game freezes on ps4 at least once a day.
---
GREAT...….even after a nuclear war the Government still have screw with the little man just trying to get along in this post apocalyptic world.
---
BUT on the other hand have it a Mr. Gutsy and track you down to pay the fine, that could be just annoying enough to work.
---
but you can just drop the chassis?
---
How are console going to compete with PC when mods can. Done to the PC variant?  Is there some sort of anticheat that will level the playing field?
---
Well, you could do that still. Just why isn't there more spawns. Doesn't seem like there are any scorched at all. The issue of the scorched seems to be moot if a band of idiots can wipe them in less then 10 minutes.
---
No they still haven't fixed the bug. It isnt viable.
---
Vats in PA doesnt work too well, PA will eat up your cores if you vats.
---
Cores are easy to get.  If you find yourself playing at an odd hour (middle of the night, noon on wednesday, ect) then run and grab a power station to make them for you.  Take 3 minutes to set up the fusion core generator (you dont have to power up the station, just drop a nuclear generator to power the resource)
---
Then leave so some PVPer doesnt come try to kill you.  
---
Every 15-20 minutes stop by and pick up your 3 cores
---
In an hour or 2 you will have enough cores for weeks.
---
Or you could be greedy and take all 3 power stations for 24 cores an hour instead of 8
---
I remember when Fortnite finally went crossplay that Pete Hines discussed it on Twitter. The answer was basically "I don't know if it will happen. We're focused on other things right now." The game wasn't designed with crossplay in mind. I hope that all of these updates that we are getting are built in such a way that it makes crossplay easier, not harder. I would REALLY like to have it. It would stink to have the cheaters from PC show up in NW, but it's honestly a price I'd be willing to pay in order to play with my friends on other platforms. I hope that after Wastelanders drops (and after they fix whatever issues that causes.) We see them start to focus on crossplay. 
---
Here's the tweet: [https://twitter.com/dcdeacon/status/1044992390316969984?lang=en](https://twitter.com/dcdeacon/status/1044992390316969984?lang=en).
---
Yeah, it seems like if you didn’t take advantage of the experience bugs early on in the game, you are kinda stuck around level 300-400. I’ve sunk 987 hours into this game, and I’m only level 305. Been playing since the beta, but recently I had to quit because I got a full time job. I still login on weekends for my free atoms, but I won’t be sinking 40 hours a week into this game anymore. If wastelanders is decent? Then maybe.
---
Empty their vending machines.
---
You can't just drop the chassis, it will ask you to destroy it
---
that's not how RNG works
---
&gt;Really? I only have the space for the game on one of my drivers, and haven't had issues before.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I have now reinstalled the launcher. No issue. But when I tried to install the game, same issue.
---
Yes Really.
---
What reason is there to do the same thing twice and expect a different result, when you've gotten the explanation on why you get the error.
---
Instead of repeating the same action over and over, maybe free up the required space?
---
Has happened about half the times I tried it. If the prime enemies show up without a quest marker over them, that's my sign that the quest is going to fail as soon as we kill the last one.
---
It is when servers don't roll every possible effect, just a random number of them
---
One day I participated in sqb 8 times and only got loot from her 1 time. I found that if u stay  a distance away from her, and wait a min for the loot in her ready body to properly load, this solved the issue. Since I've been using this method I have not had this issue anymore. Personally dont think her rewards are based off damage dealt. At least not yet
---
I like that idea! And if you don’t pay your camp would get a random encounter from MANY Mr Gutsy seeking payback lol
---
I have seen enemies fall below the ground during Primal Cuts too. We nuked Savage Divide Primal Cuts and then a bear or something fell into Todd's private dungeon and we failed the event.
---
Maybe if you hit certain mine shafts it triggers an event to mine high end materials like ultracite on mass but also cause the local mole miners to provide heavy resistance
---
That's my favorite Primal Cuts because I've gotten quite a few legendary behemoths to spawn. The enemy respawn seems to take longer than other Primal Cuts and it doesn't help that the behemoths and fog crawlers aggro on other mobs half the time and dont even come into the drums. It usually fails because I dont get the last fog crawler or the behemoth down in time, it's almost always a close call like under 30 seconds. My best strategy has honestly been not caring if others get hits on the stuff and just wiping everything out myself as quick as possible or the event has a high chance of running out of time

Check out the power user perk. 1000 shots per core for th

If you have caps, ammo or good trades you might be able to make a deal with someone on the Market

Perhaps feminine was the wrong word. I think any man or woman can use them. They were my example of something done right, as opposed to the garishly girly pink unicorn wallpaper or princess bed, etc.
---
So wait what?? All of these  (Aligned barrel/grip, Dot sight, Quick magazine, and any automatic receiver) reduce AP cost? That's awesome. I wish that was in the description of the mod, would be super helpful.

I'm still rocking my resolute veteran, although one day I might try out a plasma cannon

Ouch if you’re on Xbox I can give you one (I got 3 of them sold one and am keeping the 3rd)
---
Could be related to the often mentioned 'server stability' patches I suppose.
---
So we have to completely throw the aesthetic of the game away to cater to a select few people who want something? Say I like horses a lot, so suddenly Bethesda has to create a whole horse-themed line of wallpapers, etc.? I heavily doubt that after a nuclear apocalypse, decorating and painting your house is anywhere on the priorities list. So suddenly we have to appeal to females? I don’t know why you’re downvoting, it doesn’t fit the game, I’m so sorry.

**Fuck Assaultrons**
---
Don't have to. They could just mix the Xbox and PS4 player pools by default. If you want to to play with a PC friend they could allow you to load into a fully mixed server by choice.
---
Some of these answers.
---
1. Let them initiate while you have pacifist off and  lay them out if you got the capability. Then either continue to fight or switch back to pacifist mode.
---
2. Just ignore them and keep pacifist one.
---
Yeah I think the enemies stop spawning once the queen is dead. They keep spawning if she is alive.
---
Still not working.
---
That is a great idea. I know I have mods so I am sure others do on PC and it’s not fair to console players to mix and want to compete when PC gets the mods.
---
I would not consider that a “god tier
---
roll” weapon.  It’s a solid weapon nonetheless. 
---
To me, the god tier is all about primary prefix and secondary effects.   Right now, anything that features bloodied or Furious or instigating or AA is pretty decent.  Two shot is down the list.  Vampire can be decent depending on the situation. 
---
Faster fire rate, faster reload, dmg reduction while aiming or reloading those are good effects to have.  Swing speed on any melee weapon is decent. 
---
The name of the game is inflicting as much damage as quickly as you can.  That’s why automatic based weapons and receivers (especially rifles) are so desired.   
---
In terms of the 50 cal I love my Last Action Hero because of the FFR and quick reload.  With heavy gun perks it’s pretty ridiculous.
---
I am saying I do not need to worry about AP management **because** the legendary prefix lowers it such.
---
Damn, I'm on PS4. But thanks!
---
my two shot +25% FFR auto grenade launcher really likes these opportunities &gt;:D
---
Because they don't, ha. You can see this in action during a large scrip dump at the Purveyor, she'll give you similar rolls more often than not. You can game the system a little bit with this info, but it is something you can personally test for. Just farm more legendaries. There was also a bug a few patches ago which supports this, melee weapons would *always* roll Limb Damage if you remember that one
---
Yeah larger mushroom clouds are a must a nuke detonated on the Queen while I was at the Primal Cuts event near watoga I hoped to see the cloud but a few trees blocked the whole view.
---
Problem Is recoil. I have an anti-armor anti-scorched explosive SMG and it Is a beast, but you need to Vats the head. And Bear in mind you can't silence it, so you lose some Stealth multipliers. 
---
Still fun and cheap. Great for silo runs and scorched Earth.
---
After the patch yesterday i was attacked by several gouls in whitesprings rhat were laying down flat but showed as sliding around.
---
Or Bethesda could put in some anti cheat measures. I mean whats more reasonable, the company that sold the game making it playable and fair for people on PC, or forcing people to spend $500 on a console that they dont want or need for anything else? 
---
Not to mention, most of us play on PC b/c we vastly prefer keyboard / mouse. I'm really happy that ya'll don't have this problem on console, and I'm sorry that there are PC elitists that have told you "hurrrr, shoulda played it on PC" in the past - those guys are jerks too, but suggesting we buy a console is just as asinine as PC players suggesting that you play on PC every time console players have an issue.

that's literally RNG, ever played Blackjack?  there is a thing called basic strategy, with that you take away some of the house edge, but even following it to a tee you could still lose 20 hands in a row, just because you happened to get one effect more than others doesn't at all prove your theory.  I thought you had a source for believing this utter nonsense

Well this is quite interesting. I did the math on it a while back and by my calculations I figured the lowest you could get a combat/radium rifle was around 6AP per shot. Didn't actually try it in game though since none of my daily drivers had the reduced VATS cost effect. I'll have to check if I have anything with that in my stash and give this a go.

just going to downvote my reply?  no really, why would they do that?  also I have been grinding for legendarys for months, I have spent over 1000 scrip at the vendor at one time, and through all that did not notice any patterns emerge

The fact the weekly for killing scorched(30atoms) is bugged and cannot be completed,is exactly the opposite.
---
This would be nice. As a newer player I have been looking for information but have had to resort to YouTube for it. And even then if it's older then Wild Appalachia patch I disregard it mainly due to it more than likely being out of date. It took me a couple of days to find out about Nukes and Dragons.

weird flex but okay...

I'm down

Not true. It can just be dropped
---
No, I die all the time. Like, all the time. I don't care about it, it just means things might take a little longer in the silo. It's why it takes me 45 ish minutes, or even an hour, and other people can allegedly solo it in 12 minutes. 
---
To me death doesn't matter. I don't lose anything, I don't lose exp, I don't lose caps. I can hit stuff for 1200 dmg, and if I'm not bloody it's like a couple hundred max. I'd rather take fewer shots and die more often, than put tons of bullets in a mob. 
---
It's a play style choice, and no one is saying you have to do it forever. I did 175 levels full health, now I'm doing something different.

Well I did it!  It only took me about 2 hours.  I thought I had the brick on that character but I didn't... will correct that tonight and replace the walls.

Kept the same spot, right on the river between Arktos and Mama Dolce's, built right on the road.  1 story longhouse with vendors, crafting area, and a little sitting area.  I also set up a camper with 4 beds, and in-between the longhouse and the camper is the cooking station with some instruments around it.  I discovered that you can put fusion generators on Roofs, and if you put upper floor down first, build walls, then replace it with roofing, the walls stay, and once you replace the last piece of floor with roof, you can take out the stairs. So I have a enclosed generator to power the camp! (I'm excited... I don't watch building videos or anything lol)

My character is a Medical Officer of the Enclave that was out of the bunker collecting various samples of fauna to see their effects after the bombs fell. He managed to escape the 'incident' that killed off all the other members inside the bunker and has decided to work with MODUS upon returning. Upon discovery of Vault 76 opening, hes decided to help assist the dwellers and occasionally recruit them if they meet his demands. My character isn't very charismatic and usually looks down upon any waste-lander but is always willing to give out some medical supplies, food, water and some ammo if requested kindly. Due to the Scorched Outbreak (that he knows who originated it), he's forced to work with the traitorous Brotherhood of Steel and Free State remnants to help clear out the Scorched. Until the Scorched numbers are at a controllable level, he can't go after these groups just yet. Unless of course, they're Raiders or Super Mutants.
---
first of all if you are only getting 1200 damage with a bloodied build you are doing something wrong, also even without bloodied you should still be able to do more than a couple hundred max
---
Go to where you start the scout stuff. Where you do the crossbow potion of the test. There should be plans there.

Hey, what do you call a shooter game with nothing to shoot?

Yea, the last couple runs I made, I noticed it does empty out fast.

For me, that was a good thing - I stayed in the zone much longer to find and harvest the 400 violet flux I needed to make calibrated shocks for each set of PA I have.

Have it go up x amount for each Gutsy that has to track you down, THEN to pay you have to go to the DMV because (fill in reason) and it works just like the DMV portion of the BOS quest.
---
Women dont die out in the nuclear apocalypse and things can be feminine without being out of place. OP never said they wanted a pretty clean princess dress and tiara. Just because you wouldnt wear pink and purple, or a badass raider dress with shoulder pads, doesnt mean no one would. It makes complete sense that someone who was alive before the bombs dropped would attempt to bring some style back to the apocalypse. It would be a completely normal, and expected way of coping with the current situation.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding you confusion, but it doesn't say scorchbeasts?
---
That would be fun to watch.
---
I’m wondering what will happen to nukes with wastelanders if they will be very limited or removed out right to avoid conflicts with the NPC bases Quests.
---
So you’d cave into the female stereotype of hot pink and tiaras and dresses rather than show feminine strength through rebuilding something practical rather than wasting time decorating? You’re rebuilding a civilization, not building your nephew’s treehouse
---
I like this a lot, really lore friendly too. As a cultist I'm not sure which faction to favor to fit my story

Lmao did you even read my comment? Thats literally what I said. Feminine doesnt mean dresses and tiaras.

After performing an exploit. Just watched a vid on the process to make sure I was right. You do drop it, but only after you go through a few other steps. For instance, it seems like you can't do it without a power armor station
---
I'm not a min/max player. If you want to play one way, that's great, do that. I'm enjoying the game how I play it. I can 3 shot kill level 60 scorchbeasts, and that's good enough for me.
---
Pretty much this. I'll collect prime cuts and play drums if there's nothing else going on, but If I'm going to grind hen SBQ at prime is the way to go.
---
Pole hooks are the best 2h weapon though! Slightly lower base damage than the supersledge but its mod has the highest armor ignore. Plus it weighs less. Plus there are no constant mechanical sounds. Plus it has the least view bob when swinging. Plus I am 99% sure it has a slightly longer range!
---
I want to know what that PA is. I'm assuming high rad resist?
---
Not true. I’ve put calibrated shocks on multiple peoples strangler armor I play with. All they did was drop it. No extra steps.
---
Short answer, yes. Longer answer...
---
Weapons have different ranges of mods that drop from scrapping. There's the high, which have a 1/4 chance of dropping, then medium, which is 1/5, then low, about 1/6.6, and rare, which have a 1/10 chance. There are also weapon mods that will not unlock from scrapping, and must be learned from a plan or applied from a found/purchased mod. One weapon, the radium rifle, has different drop probabilities from scrapping. They're much lower than other weapons', and even lower than armor's.
---
Armor mods that unlock from scrapping are all very low probability, less than 1/100. Not all mods can unlock this way. BoS mods must be learned from plans, for one example. Scout armor mods have to be bought from the Enclave military wing vendor, or found as drops (I think they're possible drops, and if so, they're exceedingly rare).
---
INT helps here. If your INT is 5 (as shown on the SPECIAL tab in your Pip-Boy, not on the perks page) or higher, there's a multiplier that makes all mods slightly more likely to unlock from scrapping. The higher your INT, the higher the multiplier. Below 3, you're actually less likely to unlock through scrapping.
---
just sucks cause they already made a fallout in nevada, hence new vegas 😔
---
Very good advice, thank you, but as fusion cores are so heavy I wouldn't ever have the stash space for more than a couple. My carry weight and stash are always maxed as I run 4 vendors and am OCD about them always being full.
---
neither am I, that's why I don't play bloodied anymore, min/maxing is literally the entire point of the build
---
I don’t have to. It’s the same crap that everyone else is trying to argue. It makes no sense whatsoever. This is a post apocalyptic game, not a building simulator. If you want to build, buy Minecraft.
---
Yeah for this pile of garbage that’s simply not gonna happen. :(
---
Dunno why it's showing as needing to be destroyed when I try to drop mine then. Weird. Maybe it's a PC only perk? You guys get a lot of other neat perks that console doesn't get, like access to the dev room and NW cheats
---
There is no commitment to real physics in this game.  .50 cal rounds weighing fractions of an ounce?  Being less resource intensive that 5.56?  2mm gauss is heavy?  Antique gatlings use 5mm?  Identical rounds do different damage in different weapons?  HMG damage drops precipitously if you are 50 yards away?  Headshots don’t kill?  Poison makes it through power armor, but water doesn’t?  People can hypothesize any explanation they want, but there is no consistency with anything comparable to the real world.

Yep. Failed this afternoon, killed everything in sight, then 5 minutes later two tardy fog crawlers show up.

This is a very common problem for me. About 20% of the time, there flat out is no death bag on the surface or above it. It either doesn't spawn at all or it spawns under ground. I've kinda learned to just accept that bethesda is incapable of making anything that isn't buggy trash and moved on.
---
Watoga station and BOS vendor usually have the UGL mod plans, though iirc mainly just the refined or severe beta wave receivers. I found an AA UGL, primed it, and love it.

 I’m on PS4. They just dropped it no different than dropping a weapon in paper bag. I modded them and gave it back the same way.

This is such a strange bug, as I've never run into it, with any of my shotguns. Not my bloody, not the explosive I ran for a while...

Bashing works too - no need to waste ammo on low level mobs for some of those-

So you want server crashes? Because that is how you get several crashes.

I think it's a server thing. Sometimes they shut off letting anyone back into the server, but don't actually start the shutdown timer. Probably a bug. ;)

My parents were two of the few chosen for Vault 76. My mother was a Vault Tec University graduate with a P.H.D in Science and Biology, while my father was also a Vault Tec grad but a medical doctor. My mother died giving birth to me a year after being locked in the vault, and my father died two years before the vault opened of bowel cancer. I am now travelling, finding all the places my father spoke to me about (VTU and his childhood home), and learning about WV in general. My build is melee as I’m so angry over being an orphan so young, just want to kill anyone and everyone who gets in my way.
---
still a one star, but good to know about pole hooks for my melee character
---
Exactly, the one on the door is attached to some other quest, that's why it's trying to take you back out of the building that the quest originally lead you into.
---
the working theory is they will expand the map with future content, I mean the in game map has like 2 inches of unused space on all the borders
---
Dude, I don't know what your problem is, but leave me out of it. I'm enjoying the game, if you're not, move on.

I think rumor was we’re getting remnants of the Motown vault.

What a suprise another self aware ignorant redditor. 
---
Also the entire game is based around building so idk what the hell youre talking about. Keep shouting your subtly misogynistic thoughts about women not belonging in the game, without actually listening though.
---
it's decent, but I never liked the situational effects
---
Ahh
---
FO76 is generally a bad game. Bethesda goes back on their word, every month there’s a deluge of bad news that’s more than just bad bugs/balancing , etc. Not to mention that fundamentally it’s built on a 22 year old game engine. These are objective facts.
---
I don't have a problem, I'm just saying the particular build you chose is all about min/maxing, and if you don't play that way another build might better suit your play style
---
Wow, what a surprise. Another idiot caught in the corner, the only response they can’t find is .... misogynist. Nice. The whole game is about rebuilding a nuked civilization. After a hurricane is the first thing you do is run down to the build site with 5 buckets of hot pink paint and begin painting the walls hot pink and purple? Think logically, these people are coming out of a nuclear war, they have to make use of whatever they have. Finding and using paint should not be a priority. Keep trying buddy, maybe one of your points will be semi-decent
---
cool deal maybe these dudes will be the cultists.  Vault tech made a vault to house the crazy cryptid wierdos who segmented into cults once the door closed and now they are full blown nut cases!

A survivor from a western bunker that made his way to WV. Ended up in point pleasant and spent the night in the mothman museum using mentats. Saw many elder gods in a vision telling him that the world must be cleansed by more nuclear fire. Spends his culty time sacrificing victims to the "glow" and attempting to bring more radiation to the lands to appease some powerful god that has yet to give a name...basically a pre children of Atom cult member making way for future generations.

I just wanna imagine all of the economies crashing together

Wow! "Fortified bulldozer". "Armored bulldozer". That's some serious post-market modification. If you weld some plates to your excavator armor, maybe that would be a fair comparison.

I'm stoked to kill all killable npcs
---
I like how they may have worded the refund too.. "this one time..." I reported a bug on another atom item too and got a refund.
---
If there's a bug.. it needs to be "Every time..."
---
This bug is still happening. Has happened to me several times since the last patch.
---
YES PLEASE!
---
The same thing happened to me, only now whenever I try to loot one out of a crate or dead body it tells me “ maximum weight reached, cannot pick up item”. It’s been like that for awhile now. Did I mention they weigh nothing?? Lol
---
That’s honestly not your business. 
---
Whatever issues/frustrations I’ve had with this game like nearly everything in life do not require raising the villagers to attack the castle.
---
Any chances Bethesda will allow us to migrate the game to Steam as Bungee did with Destiny 2? That would be a pretty nice feature tbh. I guess if the feature would be available only for a week (not permanent) would be fair... Or at least for the ones who were around since BETA
---
Poseidon is a good place to do BP too. The pistol One-Shots everything in there and most of the time they're separated by a catwalk so the melee ones usually can't get to you before you can reload and shoot the next guy and the ones with guns are terrible shots.
---
You do NOT want PC in your Nuclear Winter until hacking is addressed.
---
It's a nearly unplayable game mode. Discussion of cross play really starts and ends with that right now.

I had a very angry PVP player tell me this is supposed to be impossible according to the datamined formula and he also cited the 6-7 lowest AP cost possible, though he was unable to produce any sort of proof about these claims. I had previously recorded this, but the quality defaulted way too high and it made the frame rate suffer. Fortunately, I was able to tone the quality down low enough while still making it clear what was happening.
---
56 perk points, unless I somehow lost one. Maxed out and am currently at 12, 3, 10, 5, 14, 7, 5 respectively.
---
There is not a cooldown that I know of for personal use of nukes. My friend nukes a server three times at the queen then we go to a new one to do the same.
---
Yes, you are right. I knew that, but didnt think about it at the time. Do you know of other ways to get poison resist? Or just the resist from the legendary effect?
---
I totally agree with you. I have a gaming PC and consoles, so have a foot on both sides of the fence.
---
My SO originally bought me 76 on XB. It's the only reason I play on console over PC. I really miss some of the available mods, but I have so few issues on console that I haven't felt the need to switch.
---
Unyielding is great for a lot of things, i love my set, but if you're not running melee you don't get a lot of actual damage boost.
---
Gauss Rifle
---
Lever Action Rifle 
---
Hunting Rifle
---
In that order for weapons that need to be cranked. Gauss Rifle just oozes damage.  The Lever is just great overall. And the Hunting is just eh. Imo. It does what you ask.  It’s biggest problem is the ammo count. The standard mag holds 5 rounds but the very next mag size only ups it by 1 round (5+1) despite clearly holding 10+ .308. Yeah it can fire .50, but what good is that if you have to reload every other second. 
---
It’s still a good weapon. But it’s lack of competitive ammo count hurts it a little.
---
...leave me alone.
---
Nukes are a big mechanic in the game rn as the only way to farm Flux, don’t see them removing that. 
---
Maybe there will be a faction system or something else that interferes with getting keycards, making them more scarce? Or 2/3 silos get destroyed? 
---
OR when 1 faction enters the silo, event starts and the opposing faction has to go in and stop them?!?!?
---
That would be interesting.
---
Think both can be found in white springs
---
After being a heavy gunner (and hating melee) in all previous versions of FO, I unintentially became a melee in 76.
---
where unintentional = Not knowing anything about specific builds, and not fully understanding 76 perk system vs previous version perk system when I started playing, I selected perks based on what weapons were working well for me at the time I was able to choose a card. (Axe, machete, and a sniper rifle)  
---
Left me with a high strength, low charisma (I play solo most of the time), low luck.  
---
As it happens, this works reasonably well with heavy guns, which I use against flying things and certain high level ground based critters.  But for most everything else, I use a switchblade.
---
Point is, never say never :)

I'm pretty sure the pork and bean farts are mostly air.  It's the canned dog food farts you have to watch out for... those generate green clouds of gas.  Unstable Isotope, my ass....  that's canned dog food side effects right there.

You have piqued my curiosity. How does one go about "laumching" something?
---
Does it it involve large quantities of lube? Because it sounds like it should involve large quantities of lube.
---
Hahahaha YES THEY WOULD. How great would it be for their mental health living in fucked up ruins all the time? Thats why art, and fashion exist. Something as simple as a giant flower painted on the side of yet another ruin would inspire hope.  It is a part of rebuilding. You are the one who cant understand that colorful, and feminine can fit into an apocalyptic scenario. Look at the way colors were used in Farcry: New Dawn, in Nuka-World, look at the symbolism of the tree paintings in FTWD season 5 (even though the show is in the toilet). Humanity does not survive without art.
---
new to the internet?
---
This guy gets it. I would also add you should use sneak attacks whenever possible. Does the 10mm sub get a silencer? If so, Mister Sandman and Covert Operative will multiply damage by 3.75 at night provided you reequip Covert Operative second.

you are probably right.  I haven't actually counted in a long time :)

Then how does my friend launch so quickly? Unless the timer is small. I suppose they could stack the launches in such a way that it cooldown at perfect timing for the next.
---
did someone take your bag?
---
So the move wouldn’t be to build a city, instead build 1 house, decorate it over the roof? The fact that they are living should be enough hope. You survived a nuclear war that was meant to kill everything in existence yet you survived. So it’s not about a community? It’s about self indulgence and making yourself happy. Because then it’s all going to be ok.
---
Grats, it's a nice weapon, though watch the accuracy. I had one way back (but without the reduced weight effect) and tossed it for another purely because of the accuracy.
---
I mean the second floor of my house is locked because that's where I and my family sleep and we don't want people watching us while we sleep because that's just creepy? I also occasionally lock my junk extractor but you can still access the junk pike underneath it. Also have a large, open water purifier for everyone to use, and two smaller, locked water purifiers specifically for me. Would really rather not have notes left complaining about locked stuff at my camp when the reason I have stuff locked is legitimate.
---
I thought I read somewhere that it will be the vault hidden inside the crashed space station on the north end of the map. And the video for wastelanders shows that spot as well.
---
I bought one from the Enclave vendor in the bunker months ago. Just sever hoped until it showed up.
---
Lol try sharing them from your PS4 account to a google drive via your phone then download them. Hopefully this helps!
---
No thanks
---
Are you talking about Jaggy?
---
No idea but I found out the hard way, so I can confi rm there is a personal cool down. It wasn't always that way, not sure when it got put in.
---
Is today opposite day?
---
&gt;I've loads of those thanks to picking up every core I come across so my ammo tab is already quite messy!  
---
&gt;I've got the power user perk so I'd estimate I've around 36,000 shots right how as all the cores are about 112% condition, which I assume will squeeze a little more juice out of them.
---
I haven't played Fallout 76 in a while because I've been hooked on ESO for quite a few months now since my friend got me into it.
---
I honestly thing ESO is superior because it is a giant game with a practical neverending game but how do you see 76 as better.
---
That could be cool if nuking settlements spawned marked men
---
Personally, I would also really love a ‘dressing room’ option for atom shop outfits.  I’ve been SUPER disappointed how some of the outfits look on my (girl) character. Like. I worked hard for those atoms. And now I’m stuck with an outfit I hate. Sucks :(
---
Nice I would love to see some pics of this!
---
Weightless holo tapes aside, I'm quite a bit curious what they consider to be maximum weight. Like how much can I carry on me before they won't let me pick anything else up?
---
No I was offering help also.. I'm launched over 300+ nukes.. (a guess)
---
Yes!
---
I stopped doing that event after ten
---
Ow, fair enough.
---
😁
---
You guys need a third?
---
Dude. Are you completely socially clueless or just a dick?
---
oooooooooooooohhhh i get it now, silly me. thanks :D
---
Well thats a F for the robots companions I guess
---
Candles plan is called "Antique Lights"
---
You just argue for the sake of arguing dont you? Didnt you just say this isnt a building game? Now you are saying we should be building a whole city? What is even your argument other than "You're wrong." Regardless of whats being said? Oh, thats right, its no to anything that you dont want because you are focused on self indulgence and making yourself happy. Look at that.
---
&gt; Beth said that they were ready to go with cross plat play. The only entity holding them back from flipping the switch was Sony. 
---
This isn't accurate. They were a no on crossplay initially, and then when Sony relented to crossplay for another game (Fortnite I think) and they were pressed about it again, Pete Hines said they'd still have to do the work. I distinctly remember he made an analogy about Halloween costumes, since it was about this time last year. [Here's a twitter thread about it.](https://twitter.com/dcdeacon/status/1044992390316969984?lang=en)
---
dude says he doesn't like min/maxing, I only informed him his chosen build is based on min/maxing
---
My main seems to get one almost every time but he's got full unyileding so maybe luck plays a chance. Not so much for my alt. He's only got two since the patch which was what I needed for the lead pack.
---
Nah even though they've done some crappy stuff nothing beats xbones attitude during the last console war. When players asked about the always online and you cant trade games they said deal with it lol. So people did, they bought a ps4.
---
Oh ya that lamp in there i want one sooooo bad id pay 2000 atoms for it right now lol
---
I hope they start releasing more info soon.
---
Maybe too much to ask from Inside the vault tomorrow.
---
You just get the outfits... After Elder, no more paints drop, at least for now.
---
Makes sense, thanks!
---
No mod on pc gives an advantage over another player in the game at all, they don't work that way. If they did, then Bethesda wouldn't allow them at all, they are only QOL improvements or cosmetic, nothing that would give you an advantage over another player that isn't using the same mod.
---
Those account challenges have been there since launch, did they reset them for the event? I already had all of them.
---
There's lots of pink stuff? There's even a pink sprinkles PA if you play Nuclear Winter to level 44.
---
you only learn the mods for the peice you scrap.
---
For example, if you scrap legs, you will learn legs mods.  
---
If you want a chest mod,  you will need to scrap the chest peice.
---
Dr. Crassus, a scientist in the field of chemistry working for a local lab to produce higher quality explosives for the army, an accident left him scarred heavy and took leave in WV while he recovered, now out of the vault he uses his knowledge of explosives to deviate any foe he encounters.
---
Yeah I hear you 
---
I have a BE Prime auto handmade rifle and emptied an entire 20 shot clip into a guy and his dmg meter didn’t move one bit.  I’m pushing close to 140 dmg per hit without chems or adrenaline activated and he’s just sitting there LOL.   There are definitely some bugged players out there.
---
I just recently started playing again and got an explosive shotty. It sure kills things just fine. Sometimes the health bar moves but then jumps back to where I think the damage should have been. 
---
Here's what happens: Shell connects with enemy, HP bar jumps to almost zero, then jumps back up to half. So damage is done, but the HP bar registration is fucky and I think it registers the damage fine. Just the HP bar wacks out and has to re adjust. Never had any shots do 0 damage though.
---
Instead of a Flamer skin, they should give us a Flamer that doesn't suck.
---
My statement stands.
---
Astoundingly Awesome Tales #9 gives +15 but that's not really something you can count on. I'm not aware of any other food or chem that gives it though.
---
Honestly they are both very different games from each other. 
---
They're both multiplayer but one is a survival base building game while the other is a straight up mmo.
---
The Main quests tells you exactly what those people are. Check out computers, notes and holotapes for lore, too.
---
What a pretty girl. 😂
---
I can get behind this, being a guy who runs a male charachter I would like to see more than asylum workers in the wasteland.
---
There are two spots near Watoga, and both have high radiation. Pretty sure both are nuke impact sites.
---
Right if you use the same mod. I have an edit that lets me see my FoV a lot better then the in game. I also have an extra slider for grass and such I can turn right down. Advantageous in NW. I agree same mod same result, but I thought that kind of edit can’t happen on a console?
---
Whats your damage sitting at? Im looking to do a gauss build also
---
Totally agree, pc players have a huge advantage with the controls and the hackers would be annoying.
---
You can get duplicates until you learn it... Once learned you start getting the next plan.
---
When did they reset it for you? I'm having the same issue but they stayed they weren't able to do anything for me
---
You have to be prepared to hunt down the creatures.  Especially in this area.  They get stuck on the terrain or other creatures way too often.  I don’t even bother waiting for them not to come, I usually go into the forest ahead of time.
---
Right, I'm getting tired of running around in my red and pink asylum dresses
---
They should add dildo baseball bats like how intimidating is getting beat the fuck out of a giant rubber member.
---
Sounds fun
---
I don't want PC hackers in my PS4 NW matches though.
---
Yes to all of this!
---
If you have a mod that gives you an advantage over another player that DOES NOT have that mod or any mods, then you are using an illegal mod by Bethesda's definition. Mods are only allowed to improve quality of life or cosmetic appearance and only allowed to affect you and no other player. Anything or any mod that does not fall into that is illegal and bannable if caught.
---
As for grass sliders, you can turn the grass off or adjust how much you have without using any mod or app, by simply changing the value in the fallout config files, which is perfectly legal according to Bethesda. You can also adjust the FOV in the same config files as well, no mod/app needed.
---
That was the Rocket League devs who said that. Since most games don't require the TouchPad or gyro it would be easy for 76 to cross play.
---
Lol np 👍
---
800 fucking atoms for killing scorched? I am gonna destroy the entire Appalachia !
---
The scariest thing was that running decontamination arch! 
---
No seriously. Good job. Makes me regret not getting the smoke machine.
---
Eso&gt;76, eso is way more successful than 76
---
This made my day. Thank you.
---
Same for Battle Bots... or is that the same event?
---
I'm just a nibba with a rocket launcher
---
I have had several prime meat events fail because the mobs that were supposed to be coming in never showed up.
---
is it....?
---
Shotguns are pretty trash rn
---
Max wight is 1500 pounds over your character weight limit.
---
I swear after 200 I got better drops.
---
My tse 10mm shreds them not sure why yours wasnt
---
*AHEM* WE HAVE A PINK PA PAINT
---
No silencer for 10mm smg, sadly.  That said I find it doesn't report a ton of noise so you can actually still get a decent amount of sneak attacks but it's not ideal.  
---
If they ever add a silencer this gun will actually compete with handmades.  Fun fact it does more DPS thanks to it's higher rof, but lack of silencer makes it fall a bit short for use in stealth.  
---
A bloodied stealth with crazy agi due to unyielding can get away with it in the right situations but you'll wind up in &lt;danger&gt; more than with a silenced rifle when there's a lot of enemies around.
---
Agreed on that. Honestly though it would be nice to have some more...refined items? I guess what I mean is stuff like say one of those terraces with the vines growing on it, usable pots for planting, I know there was a nice kind of greenhouse sink that was leaked recently with a wooden shelf. In general I just want rustic items, that is the word I was looking for.
---
Prewar money can be scrapped into cloth
---
wash it down with ballistic bock while your at it, lol.
---
Crafting ammo is easy af, takes me maybe 30 mins to craft 3k 556
---
I appreciate your efforts on the queen. You went out on your shield. Lots of respect for that.
---
I have built a four floor, 2x6 apartment, it worked really well and I got a lot of thumbs up on it. 
---
Have a screenshot of it somewhere.
---
Been talking with some people and the general consensus is three hours for personal and silo cool downs.
---
cavs so you can close ground.  Once you get a hit its gg.
---
Sadly the 10mm sub does not get a silencer.
---
You used the ellipsis wrong again. 
---
At the end of a sentance it should have 4 dots (one of them the period to end the sentance).   If you use another form of punctuation, you should limit the ellipsis to 3 dots then the punctuation.   You used 4 in your second example.  You should have ended either with .... or ...?
---
Before the bombs fell, I used to spend my summers in Appalachia lounging around the lake and scooping ice cream. And after I left the vault, I didn't want my summers to end. So, I made myself a home near the local bars. I developed a nasty Psycho habit because I loved the way it made me feel. Extreme highs gave way to extreme lows and I fell into a depression. Then I started following the Overseer because I thought it'd give me a sense of purpose, and it did for a while... until I started using again. And now, I'm festering away in a small, low budget C.A.M.P., in the Toxic Valley, waiting for the radiation to finally take me away.
---
Most people farming the queen will switch characters after dropping one from each silo.
---
Hey thanks guys. Quick question, do you physically need to be holding the sprint button. Or does just moving count?
---
Elder Scrolls Elsweyr upgrade is 50% off now also
---
pretty sure this is not true. the conversation is from the thread the nice person (ultramegajerry) above posted.  
---
\[person 1\]     "Scrapping armor doesn’t always unlock a mod for the slot you’re scrapping. E.g. You scrap a leg   
---
piece and unlock Brawler mod which only can be used on arm pieces."
---
 \[person 2\]    "I can confirm this
---
Last night I scraped a load of Leather arm, got a mod. Then torso's, got nothing, then legs, got   
---
Asbestos lining (My last Torso mod yay!)"
---
i'm pretty sure i have unlocked a marine torso mod from scrapping a leg but i don't remember these things anymore. that was a while ago, though. i just needed confirmation from other people that they had the same thing happen for them before i started crafting a bunch of combat arms or whatever cost the least resources. thanks for responding, though.
---
So how does that even work? Players that are new see holotapes about everyone being dead, then see wastlanders?
---
Thanks for the trade!
---
For sure, they’re both sold at Whitesprings.
---
thanks. the spreadsheet only involves weapons but there's a conversation in the thread that answered my question. thank you kind person!
---
Yes the hunting vendor in Whitesprings.
---
The unmentionable trading subreddit has players that offer PA crafting services.
---
I think the limit for those things is 250. I used to get the over max weight whenever I tried to pick up the government supply tapes so I just dumped them all. Sounds like the brought the duplication bug back on those.
---
Let's get fallout working well on all the platforms first. Then we can talk about crossplay
---
Just moving
---
I can't carry full sets around like the entourage of madonna. 
---
With 3 vanguard and no dr perks i'm already at 500 dr which is quite handy.
---
Okay cool. You never know with the verbiage sometimes.
---
Yes please, rolled a second char to play energy weps, went 1-55 with no trouble and suddenly since then I am not allowed to use any lazor weapon I own, it´s literaly permanently bugged for me
---
i was aware of most of this but really appreciate your feedback. i didn't know about the ratios of what could be learned &amp; the INT multiplier after 5, though. so thank you for that.
---
I honestly don't know who thought this was a good idea. With the very limited amount of players that actually bother to run silos, you would think those of us that do should be able to launch them at will.   
---
Thankfully I'm usually playing with a party of 4-7 players that run them so we rarely ever get to the point where we are all on cool down, but it has happened.
---
I use windows 10 and I find using task view (windows+tab) is better for solving Lockout76. 
---
I drag the black fo76 window to the New Desktop icon, which will then move the app away so I can use task manager to close the app. I then close Desktop 2 and relaunch the game.
---
Thanks.
---
**Bug?** [Got "Tipsy-taste" and "Wasted on" repeatable](https://imgur.com/a/D829VmA) quests from Biv - I thought one can get only either of this type of quests. I haven't done may Biv quests with this particular character so far.
---
Only thing with a BoS logo or reference has been the elder jacket, and the prototype paint for Ultracite. That adds the emblem to each shoulder and one on the chest.
---
Try swapping weapons very quick for 40 seconds straight. It usually crashes the server.
---
&gt;New Events removed. New Features removed.
---
Subtly concerning, given my worst case scenario is that Wastelanders is all they really plan to give us, and after that wind the game down to a life-support state. Hopefully I'm just being a worry wart and it's nothing.
---
I'm all for the hype but this has been there for a long time
---
Same.
---
Valley gallaria.
---
👌🏽
---
That’s what I was talking about. Can consoles change those values?  Sorry, more of a script kiddie here.
---
there are a couple of core perks you need - batteries included, which reduces their weight, and Power user (I think) which makes them last langer.  I usually get 6 or more hours out of a 50% core.
---
I’m not so sure... the game tends to differentiate between running and sprinting. (And moving, which would be both).  Cav armor specifically says “sprinting” so...
---
Yes console can change grass level and fov.
---
You cant use armor with chameleon serum. It only works when you dont have any armor on.
---
Did you not see that I also said this was not a God tier roll?  Or were you just agreeing
---
Hmmm lol
---
rly??
---
You don't need that kind of negativity. Drop him.
---
Weightless legendary armour shouldn't count as armour for chameleon mutation.
---
WRONG!!!
---
Weightless legendary effect specifically states "This does not count as armor for the chameleon mutation)
---
Its like written on the item.  You cant miss it.
---
oh great idea...i haven't been there in ages! Definitely are scorched just outside of the tunnel on the east side when I do Distant Thunder that pops up there. Need to just go in. Thanks.
---
Wear no armor, draw your weapon or clench your fists and it will proc.
---
You actually want the armor to show through? I got rid of my best chest because of it. It's been around over 2 weeks now.
---
Wow, I haven't been there in ages! Thanks for the suggestion.
---
Make sure you are not using Rad-X or RadShield, they surpress mutations.
---
Make sure you have pacifist enabled.
---
Even if this was true, if you watch the video, the chameleon effect doesn't proc when I unequip all of my armor.
---
That's some delicious food for thought.  Good write up, MidRoad-.
---
its not just you
---
it seems to be a very buggy mutation right now, it only seems to work with a weapon out for me.  even then it is a stretch.  ive tried many combinations of weightless/no armor /no pack / no jumpsuit / weapon and no weapon.   i have yet to find any type of consistency with it
---
Hey, good catch there! Thank you for pointing that out I'll get the site updated. It should say "Scorched" not "Scorchbeasts"
---
Lmao im a console player and now I'm going to affectionately call my system the plaguestation. Thanks hater!
---
Ok my bad then :). I have not played now for a bit, got sick of getting stuck in my armour. Too bad as this was one of my fav games. L
---
I am all for cross play if it’s fair. That was really my point.  Thanks for the clarification of the FoV and grass sliders. I was pretty sure when NW came out those sliders were not in game officially.  I know when I was given that file to replace it made the game so much better!  What I could see around me was insane. A bit warped, but amazing.
---
I am not using either of those. You can see in the video my Mutation effects are not suppressed.
---
You can choose a special, but pick a perk card from the others if you want. "z" and "c" iirc.
---
Also " [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) " is a very helpful tool
---
No idea how you can get hooked on ESO. The combat is too floaty with melee and magic has no unique flair to it. The spells look horrible compared to Skyrim counterparts. The world design is gorgeous but the combat kills it.
---
https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Weightless+Legendary+Effect
---
Why does this matter?
---
Neither, get Powered for the AP Regen,  will synergize better with Dodgy
---
yeah, instanced game modes should be the easiest thing for an online game, GTaO has literally hundreds of game modes, including death matches, a battle royale, and horde modes
---
Workshops are free game when it comes to pvp. If you have one someone can contest it, which will result in pvp if you are in the radius of it. Not much you can do about it.
---
This gets it to work! So it only works when you have fists or a weapon drawn I suppose?
---
You can’t put the milk in til it’s brewed. That’s illegal down here.
---
Thanks man
---
I want in
---
That makes sense I guess. Or chameleon mutation/heavy gunner.  I use to see players clamor for it in pvp and they would all get smoked. Jumping was/is a death sentence aginst another player lol.
---
What sleepy4792 said in this thread worked for me, pulling out my weapon or fists with the armor equipped seems to make it work for me. Very strange that it only works then, but it's better than it not working at all I suppose.
---
If you use a powerful enough shotgun it one shots them and there's no chance for health regen it seems.
---
I've been using a bloodied combat shotgun and it's dropping level 68 scorched with one shot no problem as long as they're within about 25m. I actually use the high level scorched in the tunnel to gain more shotgun shells since in that area they seem to drop them a lot.
---
Feel free to buy my expensive junk at any time.  ;-)
---
I have a full set of uny cav. Just working on getting the powered to a few more peices.
---
Do you have the materials?
---
I 1 shot them.
---
We already have a full team, but we will run Expert every day this week.
---
Psn: nwa_terence
---
Also please stop selling repetitive, useless items in the atomic shop. I want to be able to build a truly unique shop, there are so many existing assets in the game already that can allow us to do this. Sell those.
---
No, if you did them they're still completed. I did all of them a while ago.
---
Merely entering the Workshop area puts one at risk of PvP damage, even with pacifist enabled and without taking the Workshop.
---
No, there was nothing to gain. This guy just wanted to jump a level 20 because he got dunked in the toilet at school yesterday and a had some pent-up aggression.
---
Toxic Valley as well. Those things will wander off away from the drums completely.
---
A high scribe in the Brotherhood Outcasts. Roaming around collecting rare technology and the means to reproduce it. If I were more set up for PVP I'd try to capture and keep all the power plants, but alas, I'll have to wait a few seasons for them to add some sort of in game guilds. As it stands I just hoard 3* combat armor and ceaselessly hunt down plans.
---
Unyeliding is teir 1
---
Sent and Powered are both teir 1 and 2, not 3
---
You can have Unyeilding and either Cavs, sent or powered
---
You cannot have Unyeilding Powered and Cav/sent
---
You either get Powered or Cav/Sent along with Unyeilding.
---
Your tier 3 effect should be wt reduction, or a stat point.
---
Very nice, I only have the excavator pop.... :(
---
Today I learned something new.
---
Bethesda makes so much fucking money, what are you on about?
---
My character went into the vault when she was 5 her mother was a nurse and her father was a scientist working to develop better versions of the stimpack and rad away before the war. As a result she is very intelligent, she is an amazing shot with a riffle, what she lacks in strength she makes up in her ability to run. She's almost completely immune to radiation and her body metabolizes all the diseases in anything she eats. Now she carries out research on the mutated plants and animals to make cures and stimpacks that she sales for a moderate price. She is also an enclave medic trained in the art of stealth.
---
Can confirm this.
---
Not much of a life support if they are setting up a test server.
---
It would be a cool idea. Reminds me of an old zombie server I played on this one game, can't remember which. Essentially we cleared out the building and each person got their own floor. Half was set aside as a personal shop whereas the other half was the private home.
---
It sure is!
---
Death match, point control around Watoga, a rush mode like in Bad Company 2. All of that would be really fun with NW rules but I'm pretty skeptical the game engine could handle it.
---
Or at least bring back the limited time items and it really be limited time. Not here for a few days then a couple months later it's back again.
---
I knew that going past 250 was a steep decline but didn't know it was that much. Cool sheet!
---
Yeah, I ended up storing the vendor and placing it back in order to remove the tape. I don't want anyone else inadvertently purchasing a bugged tape from me. Stinks, since I was trying to sell them cheap to help out the low levels.
---
That's literally a plot of this one show on Netflix except it was to get on a spaceship to leave the dying earth
---
Right? I feel like a .50 cal rifle should dominate for sniping. I have an instigating limb damage one I refuse to stop using because it should be able to kill most things with a sneak headshot despite the meta.
---
1: My main character is modeled after me. With her face as close as I could possibly get to my own. She wears a poodle skirt, and basically carries a lot of canned food/healing items.
---
2: Zarina is a Scarlett Sniper merchant. She sells/trades to the good folk vault dwellers that come by her shop in Whitesprings. She tries to sell things for cheap since she has a lot of competition.
---
3: Jade is a Cryptid Cultist, she's active in the Mothman cult, but also dabbling in a new cult she made for the Sheepsquatch. She hordes Cryptid items, and eats meat exclusively. She also wears the Sheepsquatch impersonator outfit, the hood she keeps off until she's ready to fight.
---
4: Jess is a comic book store owner who routinely gets into fights with other players over her beloved comic book characters. She wears a NW track outfit, with short hair and nerd glasses.
---
It’s really not.
---
Yeah, I'm not judging sitting on the poles.  Hell I sit on up on top all the time, but hop down if I see the critters fleeing the group.
---
I just use my AAE Ultracite LMG and it holds 75 rounds. By the time my clip gets to 58rounds remains the Scorch Beast is ragdolling around
---
I mean, I'm hoping I'm wrong and wringing my hands over nothing, but all that means is they realise it's hard to have a game people stick with if they are frustrated with bugs that recur or never get fixed. It was also never part of the roadmap and is something that isn't yet implemented.
---
Yeah, but then you look at how almost a year later, they still have the wonky code decryption thing that's so obscure that most players just use Nuka-Crypt, and yet they keep it in.
---
Wasn't there a test a few years back when Microsoft was experimenting with cross platforming that showed keyboard and mouse users consistently dominated controller users on first person shooters? 
---
Point and click is very instinctive. I'd hope any fps available for cross platform play will support keyboard/mouse play on console.
---
I was doing the powering up event... I left the cooling area by outside... to go inside of the power plant by the external door that was already open.... I crossed the workshop event area indeed - and died, but just that.
---
It doesn't work for me :( There is no such achievements in my Challenges.
---
Exactly!
---
It is satisfying seeing them nose dive into the ground.
---
yes thank you i'm Gamebrah if you're still on
---
yes, I sent a request!
---
Honestly, I'll prefer more realistic items. There's plenty of feminine stuff in the game already. It's the wasteland, there probably wouldn't be much in the way of super pretty feminine stuff, unless it was repurposed, created from things in the wasteland. Faded realistic wallpapers, graffiti, furniture built out of scavenged materials. Different roofs! Chain link fence. Barbed wire. Mannequins would be awesome. As would being able to change a plain t-shirt color.
---
But before more stuff, how about more camp budget!!! If I want to add even an inth of the stuff I already have, it requires a complete redesign that I'm usually unhappy with.
---
My character didn’t come from a vault and was hit almost directly by the blast, he has no charisma and his face looks like it was stuck in a microwave for 30 hours straight
---
Still haven't fixed the game from launch and you're asking for crossplay.. so.. what?? So you can sit there trying to log in or blue screen forever? Smh
---
Just under a week ago. They emailed me saying they attempted to reset the quest, and should be sorted when I logged in next, and sure enough it was. I'm on PS4, don't know if that's relevant.
---
Maybe not just female but all genders get some new outfits Camos and colors for woman sure but I think all genders could use some more outfits
---
I think that's always a distinct possibility, just from my experience with Doom 2016.  Everything was running full speed until it abruptly wasn't.
---
There is a *lot* of stuff that has been pushed back to what we might consider post-Wastelanders 2020 though and I don't think they'll be able to renege on that without a major stink.
---
I popped into the forest Prime Cuts event midway through. The deathclaw appeared (legendary no less) and immediately boned out down the road to Flatwoods. I had to sprint after it to take it out.
---
I was kind of hoping there would be some players fresh out of the vault in town just to see them freak out when this thing rampaged into town.
---
not really sure if it worked, not showing anything here (either that you accepted or if you sent me a request...) 
---
is the social tab broken?
---
**Bug?** Ballistic Bock (drink I had to make for the quest above) doesn't affect the Gatling Gun or .50 Cal. [Looks like this is still an issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search/?q=ballistic%20bock&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sort=new).
---
You've got a lot to investigating to do, stop harassing the wise Mothman!
---
spooky
---
You can meet her in a club in old Soho, I hear.
---
This bothering me too. During events I stopped to use aid items from my inventory because of the potential lock up.
---
They're all useless, imho. Best defense is not gaining their attention or being there in person and leading them away from your base.
---
You already do it?
---
I got the puncturing pole hook mod plan of an angler in the mire
---
And that loot isn’t going to retrieve itself.
---
Literally just finished :( sorry buddy
---
not showing anything here... :(
---
I have to leave work now, but tomorrow in case you didn't manage to do the Tadpole challenge, let me know!
---
I have the plasma mine plan learned. Got it from a drop off a super mutant at westek
---
There’s a vault hidden under the space station wreckage?  I haven’t really poked around in there much TBH.
---
I doubt it. With a few exceptions they weren’t that great, and I don’t think there’s a lot of collectors.
---
That said I have my Action Hero and wouldn’t sell it!
---
My character has:
---
- The skinniest build possible
---
- A hunter's longcoat
---
Trapper chestpiece clips through the longcoat 100% of the time
---
That’s ok, thanks!
---
I am from the vault who was a fire fighter before going in to Vault 76. After coming out and found the Responders and Fire Breathers decided to continue their jobs. 
---
Upon finding out what happen, I have tried my best to protect new members from the vault as they come out from any raiders and helping them to get better to take the fight to the Scorched.
---
why not just give all "hats" stats and abilities. i mean the gas mask was just a tutorial precursor for power armor and hazmat
---
I think its time for BETHESDA to investigate this server overload duping. Ban the users or fix the glitch. Here is a link showing a few of the problem players and what duping they are currently using.
---
[https://youtu.be/UcWjFDe6Zxo](https://youtu.be/UcWjFDe6Zxo)
---
I recall the updated road map was first shown at QuakeCon, maybe it changed again since then, but I think it was already only human NPCs and new gear there.
---
This exactly. I was in landscape maintenance for a few years and I enjoy using the CAMP plants to decorate; crops also make for functional decoration around the exterior.
---
Yes but for now try to evade this type of players that just dupe the gear or buys it on eBay.
---
Btw that thing of buying weapons at eBay seems something hard to fix, right?
---
I don’t mind fixing my base costs nearly nothing usually, plus I like the resources they drop when I kill was just wondering which turrets would do most damage to them.
---
Or like add it as a resource list on the sidebar, I know I'd like an easier way to track down the Mappalachia posts
---
I saw photos from someone else who clipped through the sealed door using their power armor. There was a vault door behind it. And I just assume that since the space station is in the video, that would be the vault that will open. But who knows.
---
I love battle royale and I play CSGO danger zone few hours daily. I used to love Nucleat winter but now when I tried it, it was terrible. 10min zero enemies then suddenly 3 lvl &gt;100 players raped me in second with one single shot while my grenade launcher didn't even slow them down.   
---
As new player BR is unplayable. And not to mention that unless you have friends, teaming is impossible! Last game I played alone because I only had one person in my team and he just died in the first seconds because his dumbass didn't choose spawn location so he randomly spawned in the middle of 7 enemies...
---
Are you sure it’s Plasma Mine and not Pulse mine?? If you could plz screenshot yourself being able to craft that at work bench and send it to me, gamertag same as name here
---
Nice! I'm still looking for a aggressive Mothman to kill. I have only ever had the ones that fly away if I get too close or the wise one.
---
Not sure about that, but if it is before, then that makes it even more effective.
---
The answers are not in game. It's not like the firebreather's test where the answers are laying around somewhere, unfortunately.
---
It is 100percent plasma mine.  I will get a pic when I hop online today
---
I mean it could definitely be better but it's the best one of I got on this character so far.
---
Has anyone seen a scorched mothman or one controlled by the flatwoods monster?
---
Yes! The scarves and surgical masks would also give a small amount of radiation resistance IRL.
---
Then the game will be heavily Ping reliant. Aka TERA. Aussies can't be competitive vs Americans due to less than half the dps/healing output.
---
# PINK PAINTED NAILS AND BEDAZZLED DEATHCLAW GAUNTLET!!!
---
I also have Unyielding Sentinel AP Refresh and Assassins Sentinel AP Refresh pieces. Happy to post screenshots if there is still doubt.
---
I stand corrected. 
---
I was under the impression that Powered was in the same teir as Sent and Cav. 
---
Thank you for the link to the effects also, this will help me in the future.
---
YASSSSSSSSSSS 💅🏽🤣
---
Legacy aside, all around best base weapon is the 50 cal.  No spin up time, good ROF, solid armor defeating base damage.
---
I think my JE plasma gatling is the best I own though.  Full health, clears a room of Vault 94 mirelurk kings like an oxy-clean commercial, and is extremely ammo efficient.
---
Everyone starts at the beginning and gets faster with better gear and more experience. I think my first solo was probably the same, because I was usually fire support to a pro and had to follow my own quest prompts.
---
what you should have done was what the guy before you did. 
---
State i was wrong, show me how I was wrong.
---
But no, you were a dick.
---
I have fresh shine, would you like a drink?
---
I was a Geology PHd who was heading for an interview at Hornwight. When the bombs fell i was lucky that my proffesor had been acepted to the valt. With a little persuasion and a bribe of the last rock samples taken from  Applalachia I was allowed into the vault. 
---
I used to walk Applalachia with a hammer and a note book.
---
I now walk Applalachia in power armor with a rocket powered slegehammer and a [50.cal](https://50.cal).
---
Still collecting samples.
---
I want to live in a world where a scarf is protection from radioactivity
---
it can still look raider-y!
---
Nope, Sony has nothing to do with the price of the game on PSN.  All PSN prices are set by the publisher.
---
Yeah, I see a lot of Mothmangs.. One day I was in eastern bog and ran across a Scorched Mothman being attacked by some ghouls and then omw to Watoga I fought a Glowing Mothman, it was weird. Ive also encountered two Mythical Flatwoods Monsters within maybe 30 minutes of eachother in Ash Heap
---
Welcome to the club, i prefer the tse lmg but its ammo is shit, the tse is nice and ammo is easy to craft
---
As a western new yorkian, you dont envy our lake effect snow. You wouldnt know what to do with it, while i'll hand you a lemon snowcone. Thats what the yellow color is... lemon, yup, believe me.
---
Now if you could have brought the scorched mothman to the flatwoods monster and got a pic that might have been the rarest sight in game.
---
Scorched yes (2 versions), controlled no.
---
libertarians are basically just fascists that havent admitted it yet...
---
Turrets hurt Scorchbeasts like wet toiletpaper hurts concrete
---
Yeah, 10 atom challenge, amirite? lol
---
Could it possibly be just a test map used only by developers?
---
Kinda wish we could build one of those anti air turrets
---
I wish it kept track for THAT character. The longer the character exists, the farther the date
---
Also I’m on pc, not sure how to send a screen shot to you
---
I’m Tim. I was VaultTec IT supervisor. I have no business in this world and I’m paralyzed with fear every waking second. If you’re reading this, please send diapers.
---
What’s the name of the show?
---
I kept my Action Hero, Garauntee and Sole Survivor. 
---
Everything else was junk.
---
Would be cool to see that, through the dlcs maybe they could even change the map with the ageing could see some really dope stuff from that
---
Agreed. I just don't see it happening. Otherwise it would have already happened with xbox &amp; pc.
---
This news is great for games overall but I just don't see it happening with this game.
---
Makeshift warrior
---
Lol yeah, sounds about right.
---
when I read this I thought raider controlled Casino!, sry
---
The maskes should atleast protect from ash heap stuff.
---
I already, nicely, stated that sentinel and powered can both be on the same armor piece but you decided to start an argument. Who is the dick here? The guy who's talking out of his ass, or the guy who's sick of people talking out of their ass? A hard lesson is lesson too.
---
If the server can take it, absolutely! However I think we're a long  way off from that sadly.
---
Dear god no!
---
Yeah I’ve been buying up stuff just to spend caps but I then really don’t have stash space for all the scrap that comes from the weapons or armor I buy from them 🤪
---
Thank you !
---
This.
---
I have seen the flatwoods monster once in 900 hours.
---
LOL 😂 Believe it or not I’ve been spending up big on stuff I don’t need just to spend caps but then don’t have the stash available to store the stuff I buy..... aaarrgghh 😳
---
Very valid and wanted! I wish for the same!
---
I think you might be in wrong sub
---
I'm online now and I'll try to be on most of the night for anybody who wants to stop by and check it out!
---
You never provided proof, or a source.
---
I told you so is not proof.
---
Too many assholes use the "I told you so" or  "I saw this thing once 5 years ago"
---
So, I'm sorry I was skeptical at first, as mentioned previously, you did not provide any proof or resources.   So learn from this, and I will too.
---
I’m not a developer just a casual gamer so I’m not sure how to do it. All I know is the majority of the players I run into with a crazy build didn’t work for it. They bought it off eBay or won an auction on reddit.
---
And I am sorry for venting on you. Have a nice day :)
---
ESO released in 2014 to bad reviews, they've had 5 years since then to fix everything. It remains to be seen if the same can be done for FO76.
---
If you and another player are in an unclaimed workshop you can initiate pvp by claiming the workshop, been that way for a long time
---
Yeah same! Its not even that hard to program into the game
---
Why Bethesda??
---
[plasma mine ](https://imgur.com/gallery/Htp6CT5)
---
Oh that’s not gonna work then lol. I should clarify my earlier post then. On Xbox 1 these are the Plans that I believe do not exist; Deathclaw Gauntlet extra claw, Plasma Mine, Healing Salve The Mire, Healing Salve Cranberry Bog. If you are on Xbox and have them for sure with proof, I’d love to see it.
---
Agreed but they would need to have a reclamation day server for new players
---
Love this, spread the word! I was planning on making a video about best places to take out scorched for this community event, but this just adds a lot more reason and interest. Do you mind me referencing to this post?
---
Just posted link of me having it
---
Ok I'm dumb...but I'll take a chance here...does that mean I might be able to play HALO on a ps4 or the new ps that comes out?
---
Yeah I guess so but on the other hand they could also be more like GTAV where you play online for the first time in 3 years and you're like WHAT THE *****, then again they could have some sort of level clearance for servers
---
Chameleon mutation.says as i reading it right now. (Invisable in combat if un armored &amp; stationary)
---
Maybe, but I'm interested now in what they have to say.
---
It happens.  I get it.  Im a hard head just like you.  But in the end, we can part amicably.
---
I need resources and money lol!
---
Amen to that! That is how this guy was....
---
Bethesda is a little more tame than Eastern designed games. Bethesda isn't good at titillating design even if they try... now 'some' modders on the other hand, lets just say you can but don't want to imagine where the power core goes.
---
It protects you from directly inhaling airborne radioactive dust particles. Those will never leave your lungs.
---
I want to try it so badly but am so scared now after seeing all those posts about people having problems. If you guys decide to run it and need another Im game. :)
---
I’ve been seeing it more and different types of....
---
But ... but what if your neighbors are buttholes? Do you know how hard it is to find good neighbors!
---
My name is Jade. Ever since I could recall, I lived in Vault 76. Life was sweet in the vault actually! I had many books to read that teached me about heros that killed monsters with swords, they looked so cool, I always wished I could be like them, a fierce slayer!
---
Another kind of books that I always had around were healing and all, I read them, using blood and knowing recepies for cures and stimpaks came easly with time.
---
One day the Vault 76 opened, my eyes first laid out in the beautiful landscape of West Virginia... Trees in the horizon that meet the eye, beautiful apalachia...
---
Wondering, collecting, living from the earth. Sometimes slaying radioactive creatures with the help of my machette or sword. Life outside is good.
---
It's the end of the world perhaps but... I guess it's the most beautiful home I could have ever asked for.
---
From now on u shall be like the rest of us only useing (diluted Rad ex and Diluted radway)
---
oh I ran into him up at the lighthouse and didnt know what the hell it was. I tried to shoot it until I realized I wasnt doing any damage. So I stopped and interacted with it and got some enlightenment for 3 hours :)
---
Exactly what I was thinking
---
With DR, the important thing is that making it **x** times higher will make the damage you take **x^0.365** times lower. So, for example doubling it from 200 to 400 means 1.29 times lower damage, or about 22% reduction. This formula no longer works if the armor is fully penetrated, which happens when the incoming damage is about 6.5 times higher than DR. Although in practice with any decent armor that would need to be high enough damage to get killed by in one hit.
---
After event was over. Got killed by legendary animal. Lost all junk collected off the robots in silo
---
Very.  I have only seen a couple since beta.
---
Wha kinda build/gear are you running and what level are you? I'll probably have another and the 3 of us can probably knock a standard out pretty easily
---
Unless we're being lied to, anything to cover your mouth and nose is better than nothing for protecting from radioactive dust... In FO4 I make all my farmers wear gloves and mouth coverings even though they don't really do anything, I just always wished they did lol.
---
If you cannot fight Scorch beasts outright, you're best bet is to keep a low profile camp. 
---
If that won't do it and you want the spot, try using concrete foundation blocks for roofing.
---
add me in game, I have helped probably 200+ with this. Glad to help IGN JanynFletcher
---
Definitely not.
---
finally, full servers
---
Depends if they reintroduce them, of course.  No way to guess atm.
---
My character setup is sneaking with single shot rifles. So combat rifle and hunting rifle.
---
Kill him 3 times today. My camp near Top of the world.
---
Radshield does not suppress mutations.
---
I just drop mine for the peeps who are in need.
---
He showed up in the ash heap primal cuts event for me yesterday.   Was random
---
The mk2 gun turrets actually work better because most rockets miss a flying SB. They still suck though.
---
Good to know, maybe I'll open a new ticket and request the quest to be reset.
---
I don't think it was always there, either. Can someone fact check me? Like I need to ask. 😁
---
Damn.
---
I can barely even play right now anyway, Primal Cuts keeps causing freezes that force me to logout of Windows to close the game because I can't even get the Task Manager to come up.
---
Realistically, every clothing item is protective clothing from the radiation dangers we face in fallout. 
---
The primary danger you face in a nuclear strike after the initial blast wave is fallout, which is radioactive dust and other small particulates. These accumulate on your skin and clothing the more layers between you and it the better off you are.
---
I'm just in it for the stories and all that. I don't really care much for the combat but with the characters I have it's kind of easy and fun. Especially with one since I just walk past everything.
---
On 76 I just have my shotgun that used to kill everything in a few hits now just almost feels like a nerf gun.
---
For me if I'm not having to close the application at least once during a play session, its not the full game experience
---
Three hours is the time.
---
Sfec
---
Only the BOS CAMPs came with those.
---
A few limbs do not necessarily weigh that much, but these creature specific damage reduction effects are most useful when you know in advance what you are going to fight.
---
Forged were an ex-gunner faction. The gunners had extensive training so it makes sense that the forged did as well.
---
However I still think the fire breathers would win. They're fire fighters, fighting fire is kinda their thing.
---
You may want to carry a higher dps weapon for the queen. I'd always aim for 2-3k damage just to make sure you get loot. Now that people are killing her faster again slow firing and low damage weapons can be more of an issue.
---
,
---
ESO has been out for 6 yrs and has had its fair share of problems at the start. Hell damn near all origonal to ESO could tell you ESO was far worse off then 76.it took alot of trial and error for Zinamax to fix it and make it into what it is now.
---
Once you have a set you don't have to pick up anymore. Just kill the two Mr. Gutsys and then go swipe the cards you already have.
---
Yeah ok I'll try that next time. Was having some massive lag during event as well.
---
Try a non-explosive on SB, particularly  SBQ. I've found that +10% while aiming works *all the time*, and my non-explosive shotguns do way more damage per hit on SBQ than explosives do. As it stands, shotguns play well with crits, no so great with explosives, especially considering your procs spread to you if you're too close.
---
Thank you for the clarification!
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/D2ik4Z9 
---
Happy days in a happy place!
---
Hopefully one day there camp builds
---
Yes both
---
First time I accepted an invite from a stranger it was just a troll to put me into PvP.  In this game if a teammate is in PvP you or your base can be destroyed with full damage.
---
It looks really great on the scabber and waster outfits from the atom store.
---
Sentinel is better than cav because you don't need to expand AP to get the effect.
---
If 76 is anything like F4 (lol) the game treats vats melee animation as standing still.
---
Yeah but now I wish they were a food item in game lol.
---
Cheesy Opossum bacon fries...
---
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
---
See them all the time in big random encounter spots. I've killed at least 14
---
I bought elder scrolls online and it was the worst decision I've ever made.
---
 Seems like you have to pay for everything you do in that game. A big no thank you from me.
---
Right, ESO should be a buggy failure with no content and not the epic, highly polished mmo that it is.
---
It is very bold to assume of you that pink color is feminine.
---
With melee? With the way hitreg works due to the server if you get denied a hit in because of lag you'll almost definitely get hit by a Mirelurk King at some point. That's not even accounting for getting attacked by multiple ones, or multiple sources of poison/acid attacking enemies. Stingwings/ Mirelurk Queens/ Mirelurk Kings will kill you at some point.
---
Here the location on the wiki.

Zeke Lee Johnson was 15 when he entered the vault. His father died in the war against the red menace. According to his mother, who later died in the vault, he is a direct descendant of both Robert E. Lee and Andrew Johnson. He is a WV hillbilly, but due to being (mostly) raised in the vault isn't a racist, but he hates commies. He prefers to stick to his home in the hills, playing his steel guitar and makin'  whiskey, just enjoyin' his middle age. He misses his cat.
---
And quintuple the staff currently hired to work on 76?
---
You're a survivor from outside the West Virginia area that's been unaffected by the Scorched virus and have come to join the cults of the area. Or atleast something similar to that.
---
Lost in space, it's the 2018 edition
---
I always just use the pvp emote after I am hit, then walk a little and ignore them, pvp emote and pull out a weapon if they follow, turn and walk away to do my thing, pvp emote again if they start to lose interest to bring them back, walk a little and check my pip boy, pvp emote...etc...etc...etc. It drives the little kiddos absolutely scorchbeast shit crazy and if you get the right one on the hook, you can waste a good chuck of their time.
---
I had that happen as well. Trying to take USGSR tapes from the stack marked for sale instead ended up adding a tape to a second stack in the stash that was not marked for sale while keeping the for-sale stack at the old size. I think taking tapes out of the not-for-sale stack ended up removing tapes from the for-sale stack as well, though, so I managed to get all the tapes out. I'm not sure if I took them out through a vending machine or a stash box, though. After this, and since they're useless anyway, I avoid looting them in the first place.
---
I've had weird things happen when accessing the stash through the vending machine interface in other ways too. E.g. taking things out of the stash through the vending machine interface would not increase the available stash space. I'm not sure if that fixed itself when I loaded into a new map or whether I now have less stash space permanently.
---
I see him about once a month.
---
PS4 version is not the same as Java, it is considered the Legacy version as it was the console version before Bedrock was a thing.  PS4, PS3, Wii U and Xbox 360 are all considered Legacy version.  Unlike the other older consoles the PS4 edition is still getting updates.  You can still find the old Legacy version on Xbox One also.
---
Player housing with variously-skinned entrance doors would be cool!
---
Besides "floor" doors, maybe wall doors that can be placed on the doorways of some of the completely boarded up buildings? They seem to have a large variety of instanced player housing in ESO. Poke the other team for player housing coding tips!
---
just throw your meat cleavers at it
---
I'm sorry but for now I'm going to say no until the situation with player-cheaters on PC have been culled to an appropriate amount or entirely removed. I want the people on Xbox and PlayStation to not have to deal with the infestation of cheaters / hackers on Nuclear Winter.
---
For Adventure Mode? Sure.
---
With PVP being entirely optional now, I see no reason why this couldn't work. More players = more community = more fun.
---
I’ve had 4 mothman and 2 flatwoods monsters at my camp in a couple months of being in my current spot. Took a picture of my cow and collectron glowing purple.
---
I want a baby one as a pet. Or a deathclaw. Either or would be great.
---
If I remember right, a Halloween event was confirmed at QuakeCon. The large expansion with NPCs would probably come a few weeks later, unless it is delayed.
---
Thrown weapons disappear when shot into wall decorations, otherwise I would use Sheepsquatch shards or throwing knives, but thanks for looking out!
---
it's been gone for a while too, i wanted to buy it a month ago and it was gone along with the hot rod pa skins; it's back again, and definitely wasn't there "in the beginning."
---
When my Camp was on the Golf Course near the Snake by the hole in the fence with the robots, I used to kill one a week.  Every play session I seemed to get at least one legendary and many Boss creatures.
---
From what others have said they're calling it the 'Secret Service Power Armor'. So probably something Enclave related AND related to that Event where you can become the President.
---
Unfortunately this. They can distract the SB for a bit but you are better killing it yourself.
---
If you want to randomly stumble upon the Mothman it is very a very rare occurrence, yes.  
---
However, if you're actively looking for it and are willing to do some server-hopping, it's actually not that rare at all.  
---
There are a couple random encounters that will spawn a Mothman, the best and most reliable one I found this far is at  Cranberry Glade because the spawn point is right next to the random encounter hotspot after changing server.  
---
Literally just fast travel there and check if there's something next to the Cooking Station, you'll have a chance to encounter a Mothman. Now, for some reason it seems to always spawn a WISE Mothman... The same one as The Path to Enlightenment event but you can actually kill this one. For some reason it doesn't seem to attack me back nor notice I am there at all which makes me think it's possibly a bug.  
---
You can also find tameable pets but keep in mind it might take a long while before a Mothman spawns, just keep server-hopping until it finally happens.  
---
Any other Scene type random encounter will do but this one's my favorite by far.  
---
Mothman also seem to spawn in Travel type random encounters (The same type that spawns the Vendor Bot Responder.) but those ones will always be a standard Mothman and will most likely fly away as soon as you get near them unless you can kill it really fast.
---
Except I didn't say git gud. Or anything remotely near that. Look who you're talking to.
---
I tend to find him in the Savage Divide areas most, though I've seen him near the Nuka Cola plant also.
---
I think it's odd that the Grafton Monster and Snallygaster have reliable spawns around Charleston and Wendigos have that one cave, but I don't know of any reliable spots for the Flatwoods Monster or Mothman (Lighthouse Event doesn't count)
---
It was always there. Just not easy to locate, as no quest takes you up there.
---
Ok I'm doing it all wrong lol
---
They had pink power armor in the atomic shop about a month ago.
---
Im shurs bethesda would be more then  willing to stick properties we could buy into 76 that would be immune from attack and cost $100.00 usd per. I got every one of thoes noble homes on eso and if bethesda ever placed in homes like that for players to buy. Id def buy the biggest one lol.
---
The week of November 9-15 seems to be preferred by BGS for major releases, at least since around Skyrim. So, my bet would be either on the 12th, which is a Tuesday, or 14th, the anniversary of the original launch. Another possibility (assuming the month does not change) is near the end of November, like 26 to 29. I suspect a release on the same week as Doom Eternal (November 22) would be avoided.
---
Yep a teammate found this herd for me during my tadpole hunter quest.
---
Xbox?
---
I did, someone just got them made for me.  Thanks!
---
Power armour is for pussies.. or when you've died three times in normal armour and really wanna take down that +10 level legendary mob 😂
---
Most of the non-daily or non-weekly challenges are unlocked by other challenges. This one is probably unlocked by like Kill Different Creatures --&gt; Kill a Scorched Creature or Kill 76 Scorched or Kill 76 Scorched with a Ranged/Melee Weapons etc. Or something similar to that. So you probably don't have something finished that unlocks this.
---
Had to fight both,mothman,and flatwoods monster yesterday,it was a hell of a fight,but damn,that bloody moth started stalking me today
---
No, people like you are people who make fallout unimmersive by adding modern guns clothes and stuff so stupid
---
I was thinking about the shape more than the color.
---
I seen the newest patch notes for ESO earlyer poor lil wordan's freeze is being nerfed.
---
And the landscape/trees are still defined much further, outside of the map, on the surrounding borders
---
He seems to have a decent chance of spawning at the random encounter spot on the road just north of kiddie corner cabins. I had to complete "loot torm mothman wing" for my badge and so I went to Point Pleasant and looted all the mothman eggs and ft'd up there and he spawned for me lol. Was probably just lucky though, but he does spawn there quite a bit for me
---
Ok well, that's how you feel
---
I don't smoke in real life, but I think gas masks should be mandatory to avoid screwed lungs. I even think clothing should have degrees of protection, like Skyrim and cold weather vs clothing.
---
Ya pritty much.hell i made 7k last night off 7k rounds of 308
---
Wasn't me but, I play this game a bunch so often I have to actively work at getting rid of caps. 
---
This mostly means hopping camps to see if there's anything good, often there isn't, so I try to give donations by buying random stuff then just dropping it in the camp again.
---
There's usually two types of camps that I'll give donations: 
---
Those of obviously low level players - the camp might be rudimentary and not much in the vendor, so I'll check to see if I can find the level of the player on the map.
---
Just straight out cool camps of any level, after I've usually taken a bunch of photos for the load screens.
---
So a PSA: Throw in some random stuff, maybe some notes that you can get a stack of (like the propaganda from Liberators), for a hundred caps each or so. This price gives the most flexibility I think. Maybe throw another stack at 1000 if you have the vendor space.
---
I often see 'You've been insulted' or other notes over 10k. The chance of me donating that amount is slim to none, and by putting at that you may have put yourself out of the several hundred to a thou that I might have donated.
---
They’re not gone. There’s occasionally a glitch where they don’t load in and are inaccessible. Server hop and they’ll be there. The same thing happens with Arktos Pharma and the Taxidermy Shop.
---
I started putting random junk in there and it's still selling. It's odd to say the least.
---
LOL HOLY SHIT
---
RIP - can’t win them all lol
---
Yeah it wasn't letting me accept for some reason but thanks will msg if needed
---
sent invite thanks so much!
---
Pics!?!?!
---
Nukashine parlor too
---
Hope ur luck been good with meat week. So far i got 1 tenderizer, 2 fireworm mines., The salt mod,too manny plans.too manny chef hats.too manny bloody chef uniforms.
---
Kinda hard to tell because other players also attacking her and everyone seems high level
---
I've gotten nothing incredible sadly. I've gotten the Bloody Chief hat 4 times in a row.
---
One time I found a scorched Mothman just north of Harper's Ferry, at the spawn point on the tracks where the tracks go under the highway.
---
Damn is this the guy who actually came up with the visuals for the Sheepsquatch? MAJOR props, my favourite creature design from Bethesda of all time,the way the flesh has rotted around the face exposing the skull is wicked stuff.
---
Perhaps it is, but i've killed 76 Scorched already. I'll check it again next time i'm in game.
---
What would be the difference in plans drops on console? Not sure I follow
---
Ill admit I will check out the camps nearby right after the event finishes because they are just there and I don't have to bother with fast traveling.
---
That suxs.sorry to hear. Im shocked all i got specially since all i do is play the drums
---
Oh, you mean the cross button? /s
---
I’m not sure, all I know is that nobody on Xbox has them. We can’t trade or sell things to ppl on pc so I’m sure there’s a difference there. Again, if you’re on Xbox and can craft any of these lemme know! Thanks
---
It's fine. I got almost all of the high value items last Meat Week. I'm just looking for the other two mods for the Tenderizer and maybe another Tenderizer for display.
---
Wastelanders is definitely the breaking point I reckon. They're essentially rebooting the game, launching it on Steam and hinted that private servers are coming around the same time. No one apart from BGS knows how well 76 is doing financially but from what I've seen this is a big push to reestablish the game, which if this doesn’t work out then I doubt we'll get into 'Year 3',let alone complete 'Year 2', which would be a *massive* shame imo as despite its shortcomings this game is truly unique in an industry full of CoD and Destiny clones.
---
Im level 60 and ive envountered maybe 5 in the wild, plus one who attacked my base
---
Depends where you are on the map.
---
One of my CAMPs got hit by him almost daily.
---
I’ve tested it multiple times on different servers and I get the same results.
---
Lots of people forget this but at fissure site prime there are 3 scorchbeast spawn and as long as they are alive and able to scream at u the waves of scorched is endless. So bring all the qualifying weapons and do it all in one long bat infested hour. GG
---
At this point, I loot them to sell to low levels for ten caps, since they're the only ones that will get anything useful out of them. I ended up having to store the vending machine and place it back down in order to get rid of the one for sale. Can't get them out of my stash though, and I'm kind of afraid to touch them at this point.
---
I think it has alot to do with location. 
---
I have always had my camp in high traffic areas.  For the last 6 months I have been stuck on the acid node in the pond south of Pleasant Valley.
---
It just so happened that Prime Cuts spawns 50 feet from my camp.
---
I have sold more stuff in the last week than the last 3 months combined.  People are buying my high priced weapons, plans, ammo, aid.   
---
I think its because everyone is already in the area, and people like a quick stop to scrap or cook what they pick up on the events.
---
I have made about 40k caps just this week alone.  Hell, I even sold plans for a mole miner gauntlet.  Even stupid stuff is selling.
---
Daughter of ChiCom sleeper agents

My character’s name is Cordelia Black. As a child, she was a member of the Pioneer Scouts and had a love for hunting, a hobby she shared with her father (a zoologist). Her father was eventually drafted into the military and was killed in action. She entered Vault 76 at age 15 with her mother (a nurse). She decided to follow in her father’s footsteps by studying zoology while in the Vault, intending to use her knowledge to study the effects of long-term radiation exposure on the animals of West Virginia once the Vault opened. Tragically, in 2094, her mother was diagnosed with stage four cancer and passed away. 
---
Cordelia is 40 years old by the time Reclamation Day comes around.  She embarks on the main quest (as one does...) and builds herself a cabin in the woods east of Point Pleasant. She uses her prewar hunting skills to survive the Appalachian Wasteland, mainly utilizing non-automatic rifles and a Deathclaw gauntlet as her means of self-defense. Cordelia counts herself as a member of the Enclave; despite their flaws, she genuinely believes that they are the best hope for returning America to the way things were before the war. (Is she misguided in this belief...? Maybe. Probably. We know what happens in future games, after all.) When she’s not running errands for MODUS, she continues her research into the fauna of post-nuclear West Virginia, and has a particular interest in cryptids and discovering whether or not there could be any truth behind all of the prewar folklore surrounding them.

I've seen him quite a few times, even outside of mothman week.
---
I do it for the company because Grahm loves friends :)
---
Go to the Wave Pool at the water park (with your  "assistant"), and note that at least one of the Scorched is unarmed. 
---
Kill only the armed Scorched, then have your assistant remove all armor, clothes, and buffing perk cards. Have them aggro the unarmed Scorched, and have your camera ready - along with the stimpak,  of course.
---
Lure the Scorched to the water, and allow them to slap the bejeezus out of the assistant until they are incapacitated. Apply stimpak, and note that you are credited with the Pioneer Scout value Loyalty - Revive a friend, AND a requirement for the Tadpole Swimmer's Badge - Revive someone in the water.
---
You should also have plenty of embarrassing photos for leverage in case your assistant ever contemplates a political career in the FO universe 😯
---
Hmm does a Bloodied Shovel count as blunt melee or bladed?
---
I'm close to 100 and not looking good.
---
Ya i was at the other meat week aswell. Wish they would have added new crap.vs the same stuff most of us already have.
---
Not at all. My camps around the mire and the divide and the bastard attacks my camp constantly, along with a flatwoods monster. They're really annoying and laggy. Other than at my camp I see him pretty often just roaming around.
---
What do people do with all the caps, I keep hitting 30k so go on a serum buying spree. I turn off the vending machines to stop going over and wasting stuff, caps seem to bleed from this game.
---
Panties. Has anyone said undergarments yet? I'm not reading through to find out. Lacy ones, or at least flourcloth prints. Even solid colors. My tighty whities look a little crusty, and my customers can see up my skirt when I play for them. A corset would also be cool. You could get real creative with corsets.
---
shoot, I didn't know that! thanks for the info
---
Is there some wasteland Bank that I've overlooked, seriously 40k how is that even possible?
---
Well like I said, farm the super mutants at westek, that how I got it.  Hopefully it’s the same on console
---
Played the queen today before work. I helped get it to land with tormenter and switched to prime weapon. Didn't even get off half the mag and someone killed it.
---
This was beyond anything iv seen while at queen fights. I know groups can kill it quite fast but this was a difrent kind of damage. Went from 90% percentage health to dead without re fill instantly.
---
More then a couple people were upset. Without my prime im sure i would have missed out on loot to.
---
Player housing is a huge money maker for ZOS in ESO so bethesda doing the same would be awsome.
---
Normally, I go out and buy plans I don't have but now, I have no idea what to do with it all.
---
&gt;it's hard to have a game people stick with if they are frustrated with bugs that recur or never get fixed.
---
Nothing more to add! Been a hardcore player myself until the endless bugs&amp;glitches drains all your mental health and nothing get fixed and more glitches comes ...
---
I hit cap then went and bought X-01 Emergency Protocols and the Jetpack plans.
---
Then I hit cap again so went armor shopping, found my last Unyeilding peice.
---
I did not have 40k on me, i just made that much this week.  I spent some of it off to make more caps.
---
Question what weapon were you using?
---
Hit up Whitespring and pick up all the serums!
---
Tho idk how manny would be pissed as soon as they added them. I mean alot of ESO properties cost $100,00 usd
---
Makes sense. It just took me forever to gather the right 3 perks on the right type of armor,and they cover all situations.
---
Junkies FFR mini.  he shows it in the video.
---
And Arktos.
---
This sounds a lot like what I’m experiencing honestly. I managed to solo her in like 10 seconds flat today all I’m using is a Junkies 25% fire rate weapon with +1 agility.
---
But I’m either it was him lighting the queen on fire or someone else?
---
Lately, since I started making omlettes with the Mothman's offspring, it seems like I've seen him more often. Twice at Whitespring during a blast zone, yesterday over near the Cranberry Glade, and out in the Mire close to The Southern Belle Motel...three of those encounters resulted in my having to rip his wings off and two resulted in some epic in-game photos.
---
I explore cranberry bog as a level 3 then again I know what I’m getting into since I’ve played since beta
---
Yes I’m using a junkies 25% fire rate +1 agility minigun with no perks.
---
...nice 4 month bump. And to be a dickwad too.
---
A lot of my ammo goes unsold because literally nobody wants it. .38 just keeps stacking up and I can’t even give it away
---
Heh, I bought some antibiotics today...and took a lot of photos - your shop looks really great! Loved vault-boy-2000-plushies on the shelves :)
---
Oh that’s quite literally insane I have a few mini guns but no one sells the ammo on PS4 for a reasonable price at least
---
Ammo in general, sure... if you’re using .38 or maybe shotgun shells. Ammo I actually use. Nope.
---
I been to manny SBQ events and even on xbox one she goes down fast as long as its high lvls eating her down.
---
I liked in the earlier games how most outfits werent gender specific or they had gender variants based on the PC. That was the tops.
---
Always sneak while at a workshop (sneaking hides you from the world map, so griefers won't know you're there).
---
If a player begins claiming/contesting a workshop (which can be done from anywhere within the workshop area, by holding the same button/key used to enter build mode), it will flag everyone else in the area for PVP.
---
I’d rather melee and ammo starve myself than pay the machines over inflated prices
---
I remember they pressed sony for crossplay before its release and they were not receptive. Bethesda later said that for the time being crossplay wasn't on the radar".
---
As a pc player who bot a fallout 76 xbox one x for my wife, I really really hope crossplay is at least on their radar now.
---
They don’t
---
Download more ram

Have you tried doing this with damage numbers on? I watched the video and yeah it looks like you are doing an usually large amount of damage but it is rather difficult to tell since there are others present who are also high level. Having a video of the damage you do and the damage numbers with your main and the alt accounts would further help determine if you are indeed getting a damage bug. Also will help with the inevitable claims that you are making it all up for attention and what not.
---
Junkies doesnt do that.  Im thinking someone else set it on fire.
---
"So lonely in here so ill talk to myself."
---
Yes, OP this would be a good idea!
---
If only the instruments would line up and sound good together.
---
Honestly, I've reached the point where this video game feels like the virtual version of my ex. Spends all my money, never makes any real attempt to get its shit together (fix one thing, break three more), and leaves me wanting to rage quit into the great beyond on more than one occasion. I keep sticking around, hoping beyond all reason that things will one day change, and I end up looking like a fool the entire time.
---
Damn really? I get them pretty often around my camp at WS. Once every day or every couple days but I play a lot
---
Don't forget the vegetarian ham.  That is the real culprit.
---
I must be unlucky, I've seen 2 so far and am only level 25.  One was at East Ridge Lookout, he was standing around under the support structure... his eyes were purple but I used a stealth boy to run past him to get up the lookout.  I think he got cranky anyhow, I staggered but made it.
---
Second time, eek... last night, starting at the aforementioned lookout, trying to get to Dolly Sods lookout.  First I randomly find a Mr. Handy selling lemonade.  OK.  Then as I get close to some lair of an aquatic creature (Gulper Lagoon?) ... I crash.  Dammit.  So I relaunch, respawn at the first lookout, and as I get close to that lair, ZOOM, Vengeful Mothman out of nowhere.  I watch a lot of horror movies and nothing has scared me like that.  He's attacking and I'm wondering, do I go to that lagoon and see if he'll fight the Gulper?  No, I know he won't.  So I hightail it to Dolly Sods Lookout, luckily he zooms around but also there's quite a gap in time between attacks.  I make it just in time to haul ass up the stairs to the top, and I can hear him trying to attack me from the ground.  I made it!  I really hate the Mothman.
---
I'd send diapers, but I'll need an address first.
---
That is cool; where is your camp located?  
---
I have mine on the station side, and only get moleminers.
---
After never seeing a zetan/flatwoods monster, i saw two in succession at a guy’s camp, leading me to conclude that they must have a non-rare spawnpoint nearby.  Was not able to find him again ;(
---
If only we could download optimization.
---
How do you get the concrete foundation blocks for roofing?
---
I have come across him alot in the forest near wilsons brothers auto repair. But lately the flatwoods monster has eather been stalking my camp or been staking me while im out exploring toxic valley.kinda like does this fker have a life.
---
Team is too small and inexperienced, and Beth culture is too comfortable with sloppiness.
---
You mean recipes? I really can't bear the thought of getting all the ingredients, don't do nuke zones at all.
---
There is no address. Everything’s gone. They’re dead. They’re all dead! Oh god...please find me. My khakis can’t withstand anymore surprises....
---
Oh I see, same then hit cap then go shopping, fair enough.
---
I do literally the exact same thing. I always have at least 30 three star legendary weapons in my shop so all it takes is a couple big spenders and I’m suddenly at my limit. So I decided to help out the newer players by buying ammo and dropping it. Wish there were more ways to spend caps.
---
I bet they have awesome doughnuts!
---
I just tested on a bloodied unarmed character with the same minigun with no heavy weapons spec and it did the exact same thing. I even removed all my radiation so adrenal reaction wasn’t effecting the damage and yet I still got the same thing. Going to try one with the numbers on and record it.
---
That’s just what the internet in general is like though
---
Pacifist?
---
Yes I’ve been able to replicate this multiple times but I do not not what is causing this.
---
What I've proposed is not to load it every time your char is loaded--you are right, that would not solve anything.  But rather, you go visit a site and /then/ it loads it, like how you don't load all the vendor's inventory until you go speak with a vendor.
---
This is another kind of fast though. I have 0 damage perks equipped.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/KxYXAOg.png](https://i.imgur.com/KxYXAOg.png) Good ol Vault-tec doctor still trying to do her job.
---
This twitter comment was made quite a while after it was released that there was an attempt to make 76 crossplay at launch but negotiations with sony failed so cross compatibility was abandoned.
---
This is the oldest article i could find on it https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/fallout-76-release-date
---
Put my camp back near whitesprings.  Netted about 100k in 4 days.  Not actually as good as it sounds because I'm constantly having to shut it down to keep from going over cap limit.  
---
Ultimately I've concluded you have to immediately log out if you get too close to 20k or you might skyrocket past 30.  
---
Actually lost 15k to the void because somebody bought my 18k plan when i just made it to 27k 30 seconds earlier.  
---
There's big spenders about because just about everybody is reaching endgame right now, where the only thing left to do is get all the power armor plans (not the mod plans), roll a good fixer, and wait for wastelanders.  
---
It helps to know that something like a t-60 right leg plan sells for a whole lot more than just 5k, and to load up your vendors with things people want like weapons, weapons, and more weapons.
---
Do scorch beasts have armor? How much of the AAE is doing the heavy lifting here compared to the ultracite rounds?
---
Not that this needs said, but as a guy, I'd dig pink camo. It's my favorite to use in games.
---
You can't tell me that adding an extra setting to turn on or off vsync, which basically changes the .ini file, is hard for even someone who's inexperienced.
---
Check your shadow draw distance and the like. It's not the scale you think, full render distance is something mental like 3km.  
---
I'm running the system and it plays fine. 4k60 (unless I'm in a busy camp then I'm down to 45, on a *1080ti* ffs)
---
https://nukacrypt.com/
---
Nice shot of him too. Or her.
---
yup, its a quick way to waste 17-19k caps (or 24k if you have crappy CHA and/or dont use Hard Bargain or grape mentats)
---
https://nukacrypt.com/php/home.php
---
I agree with this.
---
Ok I went there but it didn’t say the date so I wasn’t sure. Their notes on hotfixes stop in July so I wasn’t sure if it was still updated
---
I see now some dev stuff from today actually. Thanks for the help
---
supposedly there is a super mutant bbq grill plan too, but i have yet to see it in game
---
I save the "you have been insulted" notes to leave in the bags of players I kill (which is rare)
---
Ya but armor has linked damage along with lvl + ur explosive weapon. Hell kevduit did a vid a month bk trying to see if 76 was beatable without useing perk cards what so ever and it is.
---
I've had that before. I'll be there for the whole fight with my shotgun (with enforcer) breaking her legs and wings and keeping the trash at bay and I don't get a damn thing as reward.
---
Check Pheonix bot in Watoga, he usually has all the T series plans.
---
I agree. Rainbow (LGB) and blue, pink, and white (trans) themed ones would be welcome as well. I think the Pride flag icon went over well this past June. I still have mine as my icon as do several players. They could expand on that next June with skins and outfits, maybe donate all or a significant portion of the proceeds they get from the Atomic Shop that month to The Trevor Project.
---
I always seem to find the assholes, or they find me. Case in point, tonight I claimed Posiden workshop and as I was looking into my pip boy,  asshole comes up with an explosive automatic something and blows me away. He was level 194 I am level 62. No way I could compete so I hit ignore and respawned. As soon as I load in he kills me again.  I respawn a little further away and asshole finds me.and.kills me.again. Im like wtf? I thought he couldnt do pvp away from the workshop. After the last time I just logged off.
---
NW is like playing a game of soccer and survival was like kicking the ball around. Both activitys are similar but they have different purposes
---
i'll trade a pepper or spicy for a salty if you're on pc
---
I've already fixed it. It appears to be an issue for people who have monitors that are higher than 60hz.
---
Blackbird certainly has an enclave feel to it but tbh i have no clue what its about.  Is there any lore related to it?
---
Did you forget to turn pacifist mode off?
---
I pulled a Bloodied Explosive .50 Cal, and its changed my whole build. 
---
It's probably killed ME more than enemies, too. Gotta remember to switch to Unstoppable Monster when they get into melee range, otherwise I die to my own splash damage!
---
I don't think the prime meat affects the reward at all, it just gives you scrip and meat sweats.  At first I thought it did but experimentation has proven otherwise; I've gotten the Tenderizer and tenderizer plans without prime meat
---
Usually you'll get one of the prime beats buggering off to attack something that's a distance away from you and you won't get a marker. So you time out and fail.
---
If you already have a PS+ subscription, then it's $15 bucks well spent (base game on physical disk).
---
If you don't have a PS+ subscription then you'd need to have that in place before being able to play online. Unsure of any PS+ promotions at the moment, but can be found for $40-ish when promos are being run.
---
I have two PS4s (orig and pro) and picked up a second copy. You can play two PSN accounts at the same time using one PS+ subscription which is pretty neat. Also makes transferring items between toons a lot easier.
---
I accidentally bought the nuka cola backpack (for a weird reason my finger double clicked the x button). They also refunded it and I could keep the nuka col backpack. Really nice of them.
---
You guys are awesome, I don’t have enough caps to go on a binge donation, often I see stuff I actually need — but it’s usually overpriced :(
---
That’s why I also like giving stuff away (even though rather useless to some) and even if the player “donated” caps by purchasing my toys, it wasn’t expected at all and was really helpful (150 caps since ain’t much but getting at once, for me, without having to go to a bot vendor just to accumulate that much, was super satisfying!)
---
Aint getting no freeze with a OP pc build
---
pennies, candy  corn, those waxy candies old ladys always seem to have, an apple.  i got a toothbrush trick or treating as a kid once.
---
Yeah I don't think it would affect the rewards but it might help the bar go up a little bit. That's all I was saying.
---
I don't do primal meats at all because these new events cancel out any sneaky type build.
---
 I don't do shit for damage if I'm not sneaking.  Doesn't matter of that creatures are a mile away or right next to me it just completely cancels out any sneak.
---
 Either very piss poor developing or very lazy developing.
---
 Either way it sucks
---
Lvl 50 Scorchbeast have 200dr. The SBQ has 300dr with 10-12times the health. A max level Super Mutant Warlord on have 185dr. So I would say the AA is doing some work. You can find all this information on the wiki
---
That’s some funny stuff!! If I ever get geared enough to kill people (for whatever reason, god forbid me to role play as a raider troll lol), I would leave some gifts too :D
---
You set off 30k+ in caps 😭
---
I'm running 1680x1050 weird dell monitor 16:10 with ultra texture and shadows everything else medium.

---
He's done a lot of ca for other 76 stuff if you check out his profile too! Really goes to show how much thought goes into updates.
---
Ok!! That social tab is weird, I don’t think I ever managed to accept or send a friend invite successfully on PC... msg me whenever and we will try again!
---
No, it’s not hard.  There are simply dozens of these oversights, and they have proven incapable of the discipline to knock them out.  So many early bugfixes actually came back in subsequent patches.  Those are clearly management problems.  (Btw, i fully agree with you.)
---
I was pretty excited about this. Imagine my disappointment when my kill scorched with (insert weapon) challenges are all autocompleted. Also, I didn’t get the atoms.
---
My story isn’t really that deep but my character is a pop culture fanboy exploring Appalachia with my nuka colas, bottle and cappy shirt, cappy sunglasses and ofcourse mr pebbles on my back. I hope there will be slocum joe clothing soon, i need them.
---
They said scorched and scotchbeasts are going to be around still... What's a niggle? lol
---
They probably won't be disappearing but their numbers will likely be heavily reduced to allow other people to move in.
---
What did you expect from a company that need several months to get a simple lightbulb fixed?
---
It's a persistent feeling that makes you slightly uncomfortable pr not feeling quite yourself
---
Scorchbeasts not dragons.
---
while eso def had some growing pains, there have been all kinds of Qol adjustments + fun seasonal quests/events that hopefully 76 can emulate in its own unique way
---
mmm, had a friend list his copy of Unstoppable 1 in his vending machine, purchased it and it didn’t;t count for me.  Perhaps like the Abandonned bog town it is busted for me.
---
Broooo I’m dying at some of those bug pics
---
or just give us a days alive tally
---
They should refund everyone who bought it.
---
Eastern Penitentiary had a bunch
---
Yeah, interesting. I try not to say words like that around here, like niggardly or vinegar. Just asking for trouble.
---
This but the Queen May be replaced with another boss.
---
oh yeah it does help the bar go up.  i'm also a stealth rifle build but I have had good luck showing up to well attended prime cuts, tagging mobs, and basically getting legendaries for one bullet.  you can also just join the event near the end and get the prime meat for free without doing anything
---
I am not OP. But do you know how much benefit you get from higher intelligence?
---
Change the entire map.  If somebody didn't play it enough in the entire year, tough luck.  
---
A year has passed, and the scorchbeast queen is dead.  Upon hearing the news people flock back with newfound faith to retake their homeland.  Raiders come because Rose beckons them.  Whitespring/enclave content based on your past merits.  Certain legendary effects become legacy.  The forest is overrun by cultists that demand you worship the bugperson.  The north is base of operations for the raiders.  The mire has spawned a new threat.    
---
Incoming radio transmissions from the BOS indicate they might show to assist eradicating the scorched plague (a few repeatable quests in the cranberry bog).   
---
Players choose a faction and fight for victory.  Enough BOS credits and they show up.  Or the responders retake the Ash heap.  Raiders get to participate in um idk, raids?!?  Faction-specific loot tables and limited ability to be in multiple factions.  
---
Just an idea.  
---
But seriously, holding a game back for the sake of new players/characters is dumb when so much better could be done.  New characters could simply not originate from the vault, because after all, they're showing up a year after the last of them left the vault.
---
How do you mean?
---
Does anyone know of any prewar communities set up like a cul de sac similar to sanctuary or the estates with the yaoguai in fo4? I was thinking those would make an amazing community space.
---
There is plenty of mis-information on this thread. It doesn't matter which piece you scrap, you can learn mods for any other pieces. So always best to craft the cheapest in terms of materials before scrapping.
---
Any specific spots you can share?
---
Grenadier is bugged.
