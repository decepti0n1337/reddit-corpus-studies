Don't think you are bound to any region. Guess its throws you on the best server pingwise. I have some people from the US in my friendlist and there is no problem in playing with them, you just have to join them directly.
---
Hope you were able to get out of the vault without a disconnect.  Last time I spent that much time making a character, I got to the vault door and the game crashed on me, taking my character with it.  Never again.  I do my character editing outside of the vault from now on.
---
I did see a ladder somewhere but that lead to nowhere. I had a bunch of guns to scrap and had to drop most of them.
---
A Mega Sloth speaking? Experiments really have gone too far. Suit up and grab your laser gatlings boys!
---
I remember back when the disappearing bag glitch was going on i got a NV long handmade rifle that was really powerful and for level 28 it was my first handmade and i dropped it so my teammate could grab it and there was no way he cod have tooken it cause it was at my feet so i lost a really good gun. üò≠ luckily im lvl 60 rn and have a 2sE handmade.

They are already starting to show signs of paying not to win but paying for a spin at the legendary slot machine. Encrypted is pay for a spin with caps, it won't be long before you can buy tokens with real money for a spin at the wheel.

A Vault divided cannot stand!

For tho, this is awesome
---
Toss your power armor frame next to it, then jump on the frame and loot the bag.  Or so I'm told.  I've never been brave enough to try it.  Of course, getting out of there after that is either a matter of jumping out or fast traveling away.
---
The key is activation.
---
You can buy the key from any region, but then you need to activate it from within that region; you can use a VPN to activate it from a specific region.
---
Once you've activated, then you can play from anywhere w/o using a VPN.
---
Demo expert, their both heavy guns but the heavy gunner perks specifically say non explosive which it means these, so I think it‚Äôs just demo expert
---
I‚Äôve been using bloodied and TSE shotguns ever since I farmed them from WS back in December, leveled up more than 100 levels just by using them alone. Only recently I started to use heavy guns for boss fights (mini, 50 cal, gatling), simply because of the range and speed. It‚Äôs actually really convenient that Heavy and Shotgun builds use the same Strength perks so I can switch back and forth between the two easily. Of course Skeetshooter gives me more range and tighter spreads while heavy guns don‚Äôt need that. Give heavy guns a try, you will probably be surprised by their efficiency. Not sure about VATS accuracy though, never used it.
---
Yeah I had something off happen recently, I am a pic player. I recently added a calibrated shock to my t60 left leg. Next day I logged in to find my t60 had no leg. Not sure what happened here but I lost a leg after applying upgrade  upon next login. still no idea what happened, this game is super weird with pip boy issues of all sorts.
---
Ah elf
---
Seriously. I have spent hours building my camp, and I hate that I have to sacrifice practicality in order to have a nice camp. There should be secondary daycamps, where all you can build is a camp stove, bedroll, and stash box that get recalled after being out of the build area for ten minutes.
---
I feel like I've seen this exact criticism for months and Bethesda has yet to do anything about it. 
---
What will it take?
---
Yeah, hope the Imperials send him to the block when they catch him crossing the border.
---
Honestly just to sell that‚Äôs pretty much it I sell complete sets often to people for pretty cheap, more expensive with upgrades added
---
I was camping up there for a few weeks - bit of a pita to get around but great bat cave feels
---
I've only encountered one squatch and I'm not sure if it was bugged. Spawned near one of those ranger towers and just stood there yelling at me while I plonked it down from on the stairs.
---
Pretty sure he‚Äôs talking about pieces, no way would there be PA plans laying around watoga, I would know with all the grinding I‚Äôve done there lol
---
Definitely need a confirmation option. I have no clue how many caps Ive spent inching my build area over to the perfect spot.
---
Sounds more like a slot machine.

I honestly think dailies are wonky. Camdem park dailes trigger as soon as you land in Ash Heap anywhere but it seems like most others dont trigger unless near and not the biome and some just dont trigger unless I server hop a few times.

Or have a max volume of space and let us set our own dimensions spherical or rectangular.  That'd give a lot more creative space to make incredible structures.

It's a different mission marker telling you to leave.   Confused the heck out of me at first as well.  You'll find your objective somewhere in the building.  Learn to pause every time you walk up to a door with a mission marker on it, and make sure it doesn't say "Appalachia" or something similar.
---
Turn off other quests
---
I loaded that one up about 7 times and it was almost always a bare frame. Super odd.
---
I think concrete is scrap too.
---
Yeah so do I. However due to health problems (cracked my skull a few times) I have to cut back on both drinking and gaming. Spend most of my time working and other hobbies. So if you don't mind take a double on the rocks or four for me. Thanks chap!
---
I'd like to know this too.
---
Some nice ones in there! I like the one that looks like Diablo hah
---
How the fuck did you get so close to the flatwoods monster and still had time to a picture btw?
---
That‚Äôs what I thought too but I turned off all other quests.
---
Camp Venture not sure about the name, but it is the one that you turn your technical data to BoS cache.

Yes, but only if I get access to the 4,700,000,909 kinds of meat he‚Äôll have.

With the freezing barrel, the cryolator does ballistic damage. My point was that you'll get credit for the kill and you'll be more helpful than you currently are and you won't have to change your build to do it.
---
Says the guy who is only level 40. Your opinion won't be the same at level 150 see what you say when you hit level 150. Are just that kind of person who likes throwing rocks at a wall all day long? For the rest of us who need a bit more stimulant, the game is really lacking post 50. Might as well buy yourself a sandbox and build castles at home, would save on electricity because you seem to be entertained very easily. I mean you couldn't even handle something as simple as a quest so you dropped them instantly. 
---
Just because someone is bored with the game doesn't mean they are ruining it for everyone by wanting new content to play. Companies wouldn't even make new games if people didn't want new content. But apparently that is ruining it for the rest the game for you, whatever that means. If your stink is just about farming weapons, let me clue you in on something... nobody buys a game wanting "to farm new epics!" We want to play new content but there isn't any.
---
I was just kidding. I quit drinking about two years ago.
---
Level 40 is still pretty early in the game, heck you still get to pick a S.P.E.C.I.A.L up until 50. After 150 there really is nothing left to do and the game has no replayability like previous Fallout titles.
---
1500 caps (did I do that right)
---
Fuckin a man. Nice work
---
I change mine all the time... that said tho, I‚Äôm always changing it after every damn update when it gets defaulted back to the original. 
---
I imagine after a while most ppl just stop giving a s@#t lol
---
Interesting. Is it a marked location? Also, about how far east would you say?
---
Powered doors/ powered keypad doors, a mans best friend to keeping those bastards out right now

I can do the calibrated shocks for the Excavator whenever, no charge, just mats. No help on the X-01, I'm afraid. Trying to get shocks myself, and I leave the jet pack for someone else if I ever see it pop up.
---
In general "rare" materials are the ones who appear as ore in extractors.  Crystal, uranium, black titanium, aluminum, gold, coal, and copper all come to mind off the top of my head.  Oil is really the only "rare" material that doesn't need to be smelted though I'm pretty sure the extractor fills up at 5 waste oil instead of 10.
---
There's almost always a set of t51b for me in one of the train carts to the east of the Lewisburg station (although it tends to be level 20-30). Lots of the brotherhood camps in the cranberry bog will have a t51 or t60 set. There are two or three power armor spawns near crashed vertibirds in Watoga, also a pretty good chance of max level t51b
---
Demo Expert, Bear arms, Ordinance Express, Stabilized (Power armor only)
---
Thanks for the offer! Unfortunately, I'm on PC. Maybe some xb1 folks who are solving will come by!
---
There's an inside the vault posted every week to tell everything new, limited time items, and discounted items and even says when/how long they will be up.
---
Decanters in houses at Whitespring are pretty consistent.
---
Thanks! Looking forward to spending a lot of time in it haha, it‚Äôll look 10x better when Beth drops the clutter build that‚Äôll allow us to clutter our base with stuff from our stash!
---
to bad your name based on gamer tag lol
---
I'm only level 30, should I shoot for the Lewisburg location?
---
Same here. Before they ruined them I'd routinely take workshops and do the defend against waves of whatever event for the 2 plans. After that I'd set the place up with a stash box, work benches, and resource collectors for anybody who showed up after me then and I'd get back to whatever I was doing. 
---
Now I completely ignore them unless there's an atom task. Those times I wait until I'm done playing and then right before I quit I take the workshop and as soon as the atom reward pops I quit.
---
Right next to the last transponder by the scorchbeast.

We could have (melee only) Cage Fights between players with restrictions on the weapons and armor you can use (or provided/randomly selected for you for this purpose), mutations suppressed, and maybe even a (fair) betting system on the competitors with odds based on their accumulated wins. Losers throwing the fight would be punished. Rewards to the winner in caps or equipment.
---
The 3 month long animations need a nerf.
---
Xb1?
---
If it looks like shit,nbuggy as hell, has microtransactions, and plays like a looter shooter, its probably Fallout 76.
---
They are invincible for a very long time is the only reason this is an issue.
---
Lucky Hole Mine. Wear your excavator PA for more crystal ore. There are tons of crystal veins in there (along with lead veins). Then you'll just need acid to break it down.
---
Lucky Hole Mine
---
This happened to me yesterday. Doing a horde quest, went to the mall. Went inside, marker went back out. I went out and the he was. Never happened before.
---
Yessir, ever wanna come on by and hang or grind shit out, my gamer tag is Sithis Empire
---
There's the power armor that spawns in Blackwater mine sheds (not the actual mine) but it's pretty random as to what shows up. Fort Defiance has sets too. But as far as reliable spawns?   Not sure.
---
Bethesda is treating it like that.   
---
Bethesda created it with that on mind. Just check the trailers.
---
I don't like it one bit, the trailers were a huge letdown on how gunning was a major thing.
---
But it is what its :(
---
Magnifying glasses are small source.

This is a horde quest too lol.

Weapon paints would be OK, but I prefer their resources making more content like they have been.  When it boils down to skins and hats instead of new story and enemies, I'll start to get bored.
---
I miss the auto closing doors from the Slocum's Joe stuff in FO4.
---
Thank you so much for this information. I appreciate you
---
Ok give me a sec to find some t51b
---
Yep
---
 Sorry should have specified
---
So obviously you use Lincoln's Repeater and an axe called The Great Emancipator
---
I ran a nuke the other night in silo alpha and there was a complete T-51b in there except for the helmet all lvl 50 so I added it to my collection. It was in the section where you have to rebuild the mainframe in one of the side rooms.
---
Fallout 76 is less about stories, role playing than the past games of the series. You are thinking of Fallout 4 or older games. You don't decide what Fallout is supposed to be, Bethesda decides that per each game they release. With 76, they chose to go a route that is less role playing/story and more explore/human interaction(PVP)/grind for loot. When I am exploring, I'm not out going to new places to find some "interesting" note or holotape, I am looking for a resource cache, a 3-star spawn location, etc etc.. Something to improve my character to make it even more OP at PVE (for most efficient farming) and another step toward being PVP viable or even dominant. The end game is PVP.
---
Try to use the small round table. Fits barely but fits
---
Well what the fuck is it then? Because the entire world is more or less dead/empty.
---
Lucky hole mine has a crap ton and take over hemlock holes for acid cause you'll need it to smelt it down

I have had this happen to on the Xbox seems to have something to do with the server I usually have to jump to another world or restart my game.

Its comparable to when WoW did it in WoD.

Where do I find those?

Weight is so inconsistent in this game.  Every time I spawn or fast travel my carry weight and max carry changes...

That projectile's certainly more than 90 kg.

100% agree
---
I could be wrong on the type, but he carries both of them regardless
---
Thank you, I looked through all the tables I had available and don't remember a small round one. I will have to try and find it when I play again tomorrow.
---
It has a map marker. It's at the North edge of the small mountain range directly on the other side of the train tracks, East/South East of Whitesprings.
---
Along with Lucky Hole Mine, pretty sure there's several veins in the cave with the hoppers up in Tangara Town.
---
That‚Äôs soo cool! I‚Äôm going to make one of Morgan freeman
---
I just don‚Äôt care. The icon does not really affect me one way or the other
---
Well.. as for heavy weapons (I've used them exclusively pretty much since I got my hands on one in beta), gatling plasma and gatling laser are both extremely underwhelming, but only because armor pen perks don't work for them, which is a huge oversight on Bethesda's part. I still can't believe they haven't rectified that. The .50 Cal was actually pretty much always the best dps in the game, and now it's the best dps by a huge margin. Even melee doesn't do as much. Plus the damn thing almost never needs repaired. It does go through ammo, but I have no issue trading my .45, .308, fusion cells, and other stuff for .50 cal ammo in bulk, and every end game legendary farming activity I do also allows me to craft ultracite .50 cal. At this point that's all I use for anything, and I still have plenty of violet flux left over to sell. And yes, I've used that website before, though right now the attacks per second is messed up for the .50 cal (misplaced decimal), but still, easy to tell that with a maxed out B25 .50 cal, you are nearly double the next best weapons in terms of dps, and that site doesn't even take realod time into account, which is huge - .50 cal has very reasonable sustained fire rate due to the large magazine. The only thing that trumps it is the gatling plasma, however, until they fix the armor penetration issues with energy weapons, it will always be inferior.

They are fast at solving.  At least one by late Monday or Tuesday

That would be a good bet. That suit spawns a bit less often in my experience, maybe 60% of the time or something

Do you it! Be a legend

Thanks dude, busy now, maybe this weekend

It think you can complete the quest without hitting all transponders, but you need to find the last one, which is next to her corpse.  Once you have killed the boss SB at the end of the cavern, her body is on some rocks not too far from the elevator that takes you out. You're going to have to pass back forth a couple times to find it but it's there.
---
Shoot the gas cap
---
Thanks I found it there
---
Wait stabilized allows Auto launcher to ignore armor !?
---
Get Mutations as soon as possible. (And i am not joking).
---
Don't believe so. As far as I know, it isn't tradeable, so you can't even do on a second character and transfer.
---
Sounds great!
---
XD
---
You can mark things you need to craft by hitting "tag for search" if your missing them..so make sure to tag screws and springs because you'll always need them ! Also, gunpowder and ores goes to your misc. Item section instead of junk so you have to store it manually instead of hitting triangle to store all
---
I choose to believe this. What made you turn to look?
---
Gotta buy em from a vendor at white springs I believe, if you‚Äôre on Xbox I can come build you one
---
Level 202 ish here. just  rebuttal for a common complaint I hear about the game. 
---
"theres nothing to do after x - level" - BullS\*\*t there's more to do than is humanly possible in the average human life span. 
---
Today at 800 plus hours I baked my first pumpkin pie. I was considering altering my build to get the largest hitpoint pool possible in the game. for that I would need my perks maxed out on HP, pumpkin pie,phsycobuff, and cranberrie moonshine. getting to the max possible as a one timer was not my goal I wanted to see if it was possible to maintain it. in the you tube videos I watched of where to find pumpkin pies I saw them get picked up from a table. which gave me the notion that perhaps they had no cnd and would not spoil. if they did not spoil I would be able to maintain the health pool. so I went and found the recipes but no pie because someone already looted. however there was spoiled food on the table too. perhaps they spoiled? 
---
Anyway I had the recipe so I went off to get ingredients.  I went to a nearby marsh in search of mirelurk eggs and a three star legendary mirelurk queen was there. I got some mirelurk eggs and a legendary. nothing amazing for me I chucked it in the stash to sell with the others. duh pumpkins, went to the fissure near the pumpkin house killed a small army of scorched and one scorch beast for a decent and sizable chunk of XP and picked myself some pumpkins. then I had to get sugar so I fast traveled to vault 76 and then fast traveled from there to flatwoods to run around in the creek and gather some snaptail reeds. 
---
All of this sounds quick and uneventfull but at one point I got overweight and had to find a workbench to scrap at, and I had other minor interuptions and hang ups which meant it took about an hour total to get all the stuff for pumpkin pie. When I finally cooked the damn thing I saw it did have a cnd bar and therefore would spoil and that means maintaining that health pool would be way more effort than I was willing to put in. 
---
so the experiment failed. however I got a big block of xp and a legendary to throw on the market later. Then a friend logged on and we started chatting about stuff and went hunting awhile together. 
---
fallout 76 is not for everyone but for those getting frustrated with the lack of progression I recommend stop trying to progess and just experiment, play, and exist. you can always find a direction to point yourself and the only time I get frustrated is when I fixate on along ter,  target and get impatient.
---
Do you think once we get the fridge we'll have the ice cold nuka cola?
---
I just did this with Grahm
---
Would dropping it and picking it up out of the junk bag work?
---
Mirelurk Queen at the Toxic Dried Lakebed didn‚Äôt work for me.
---
If you ask me Watoga‚Äôs one of the best places for it. There‚Äôs two to three chassis‚Äôs you can loot on any given server hop, and if you‚Äôve completed the quest there‚Äôs zero enemies to fight. That‚Äôs how I got full sets of level 50 T-51, and T-60.
---
I found him on my first try, down by the Miner Monument. I just randomly fast traveled there after reading up that that is one of the spawn points.
---
Pro tip for when you do find it and have to craft film, Lakeside Cabins workshop has a crystal and silver vein.
---
The only reasons i see Devs don't let us build next to each other is so players don't build huge structure and block passages or something?!  
---
Or some other limitation in the engine probably, it can't render more than 1 Camp at a time?! hmmm
---
It's essential and can't be killed, interestingly the Random event Wise Mothman isn't, and T-poses on death, dropping a cooked Mothman egg on death!
---
Same here. I love that evil bastard
---
PC player. I guess its time to save up for something else.
---
Just sent you a request
---
The icon changes itself back for some reason- if I want my icon to show I always have to go into the atom shop - unselect it and then re-select it :/
---
I'll be tmr but I'll add you now send you a message when I hop on
---
I'll buy one if I like it annd it goes on sale. I want the cat mascot but 150 is a bit much imo.
---
Yes please omg
---
congrats!
---
Well I found the plan so it‚Äôs cool
---
Sweet thanks for the help. I have a bunch of silver already but I‚Äôll get some crystals from there. Lucky hole mine also has some crystals. About 30 while using  the excavator armor.
---
The devs probably did have them but they couldn't place them due to "floating" collision problems. :P
---
Four score and seven hundred years ago....
---
Shooting glowing ghouls in whitesprings at level 20. A single bullet from an unperked unmodded level 10 or 20 10mm pistol would not give me kill credit- no XP, no loot. Dumping the whole magazine, or using a .44 revolver or a sniper rifle, would give me credit. 
---
Granted, this was a few months ago when I was leveling up that alt, maybe things have changed since then, but it was pretty clear what was going on- I alternated weapons repeatedly and got consistent results.
---
Fucking. Agreed. Fallout is not Borderlands. The most challenging thing in the game right now IMO is the Imposter Sheepsqautch and that's only because of chem heads doing everything but activating pylons. I'm an Unyeilding/bloodied build so I totally understand why some people won't/can't activate the pylons but damn near 1/2 of the server shows up and they can't all be bloodied's
---
/kick
---
Yeah very cool, especially when doing Enclave events and modus talks through the computers, etc.  
---
I hope they don't leave the enclave story on hold for ever ;)
---
I've changed mine before, but my icon doesn't change in my name/healthbar on my team mates screen, is that normal?
---
Unyielding if you do VATS at all. If you don‚Äôt do VATS, it‚Äôs a lot less beneficial (that being said, it‚Äôs still  beneficial, just not very protective)
---
Lol well I added already I have tons of plans if your looking for anything
---
I can tell you with hope, I have BOUGHT the voice of set and the blade of whatever because I trashed them for space months ago and didn't know they could be made better, nay, required to make them better.  
---
Just check all your vendors from now on, and maybe the various markets?
---
Fuck yeah great response - me too (on the love and explaining part)
---
Will do
---
&gt; gatling plasma and gatling laser are both extremely underwhelming
---
LOL gatling plasma is quite literally the highest dps weapon in game. You're actually insane and furthermore, you have no fucking idea how resistance and pen work apparently. Once you break certain damage thresholds penetration doesn't matter you do max damage anyway. Besides even though they get reduced by a bit, gatling plasma dps (on a properly built character) is like 15-20k while rifle dps on the best rifles is maybe 2k? Also gatling lasers, while nothing on a gatling plasma, are quite fucking strong and are one of the most sought after weapons on the market.
---
[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gc9PFZU1Fg4&amp;feature=youtu.be) a god roll gatling plasma doin' its thing in case you are as clueless as you say you are.

There‚Äôs a carry weight glitch with the excavator armor. If you end the game while wearing your armor your carry weights 100 pounds higher than normal. You keep this until you.....
---
A. Exit your armor
---
B. You die in combat
---
The only way to get this back is to exit the world and start on a new server. 
---
Hope this helps
---
That is weird.
---
No problem!
---
It's because what you are looking for is on the outside of the building, like the roof.
---
Contact you in about 3 days
---
Oh, I guess that makes sense. Technically in the building but technically not. Thanks!
---
HYPOTHESIS: Some have indicated a post-mortem bag drop in the immediate vicinity could allow loot to be recovered.  Others have challenged this.
---
THE SETUP: I did a nice swan dive into a fissure and enjoyed the animation where I sink into the glowing ultracite abyss.  I Respawned, and touched nothing/killed nothing/did nothing except run to the exact location of the aforementioned swan dive.  I could see the bag, maybe a body-length and half away.  I dropped 10 .50 rounds.  It made a tidy loot bag behind me.  My floating loot bag in the ultracite morass disappeared.  Oh the excitement!  I turned to face my new loot bag, hands trembling on the keyboard, eyes wide, lip quivering!
---
F'ing bag had 10 .50 rounds in it.
---
Yes it is. None of my crops moved either. Just lost them. I figured it was another bug. Waited a long time to buy the game because of the rocky start but love the fallout games.
---
NEVER TRUST AN ELF
---
There was. A level 100 too.
---
I found her! Thanks everyone - now on to finding Uncle Sam. :)
---
That happens sometimes.  Best bet is to break down/save everything outside of the structures, because it tends to happen.
---
I got bored of it in December. The new stuff hasn't been enough to get me to want to play again. I definitely got my money's worth from the game though.
---
Enjoy!
---
Alternatively you can farm a bunch of Yao Guais for acid too
---
I've seen the garb and blade at white springs pretty often.  So there is hope.
---
If it isn't a looter shooter, its literally nothing past 100. That's literally all there is to do
---
ive noticed a sizable difference in damage using stabilized and not using it. since the auto nade is a heavy gun, it also makes it a bit more accurate (reduced spread)
---
This makes since thank you
---
It's 87. A score is 20.
---
Thank you
---
Oh shit, I made my guy look like Lincoln too! I‚Äôll have to post it later!
---
That would be nice but doubtful. I think that's why they are implementing the new leveling system soon. Where we would reset our character to get different more powerful perk cards after reaching lvl 50. Not sure on details, but it is coming.
---
Best Queen drop so far is a 1*junkies pool cue...
---
I agree, but imo it just takes some getting used to. I played CS quite a bit with it switched to left handed mode.
---
With tons of perks for headshots and sneak skills
---
Shoot.  From 50 yards away.  Anybody can kick a soccer ball past a line in the street.
---
So acid and steel and lead are all "common"?
---
This helps on my resource runs pick up "rare" scrap when I find it.
---
50 yards is 45.72 meters
---
I can verify PC at the least
---
You can usually get 60 atoms per day and 150 for the weekly challenge, but if you need to get a lot of atoms in a short amount of time you should look into the 40 and 80 atom challenges: collect caps in specific regions for 40 atoms, scrap and craft items for 40 and 80 atom challenges. There's five more days where the Nukashine armour will be in the shop, anf if you get 100% of the daily goals between now and then you should get about 300 more atoms
---
Seen a lot of people with it today
---
idiot for wasting your time with this garbage? well yeah
---
And PS4!
---
Thank you! I will start doing that for sure. Sucks for sure. Had corn and taders planted.
---
MODUS values your... Appreciation.
---
Well thank you for answering that unasked question C-3PO.
---
ROFL
---
I havent seen any. Then again ehen I played earlier I literally ran into only 1 other person lol.
---
I have scaly and twisted, but currently not home. Maybe in an hour or so. If you haven't gotten them by then, let me know.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôve turned my girl into an alcoholic and a disease cure addict as soon as they show up. I‚Äôll let nature take its course.
---
its a bug, if you try to shoot them too quickly after a detonation the explosion will not go off
---
I won't be on until then a anyways. PSN is Hownny. Message me when you're on. Thanks man.
---
Could be in your stored tab.
---
Yep they give normal armors up to three legendary effects per part so you can stack a shit tons of effects from a whole set, while power armors don‚Äôt have any and can only have one mod applied to each part. Want to carry more? Then you can‚Äôt walk faster. In normal armor there are more mods don‚Äôt even count towards legendary effects. 
---
And now since they made fusion cores drain much faster, PA is really being punished. 
---
I like the new PA skins such as nukashine and dusty Excavator, but since Bethesda has crippled PA so much against normal armors, I have no interest in dressing up an inferior defense.
---
You guys have been on a roll
---
Nicely done! That looks just like him. Now all he can wear is the civil war suit and top hat. :)

Legacy (not obtainable anymore) explosive gatling plasmas are bugged when paired with a splitter mod - they do full damage on each piece of the split beam. This is a special case. Those are extremely rare, and most people won't trade them for anything. The downside is they eat through durability like crazy. Before durability buffs you only got about 30-40 seconds of sustained fire before they broke. Not as much of an issue anymore (durability buffs and repair kits), but it's a bit of a moot point considering it's nearly impossible to get your hands on one - grats if you have one and that's you firing it. I'm seirously jealous. But yeah, I could offer 5 godly BE / B25 weapons for one, and still get turned down so... kind of not really possible to get one unless I resort to Ebay, which I won't do.
---
PS - there's really no need to be so rude man.
---
Yea looks dope
---
This wasn't a bot message
---
I'm new to the game, and after the XP event last weekend I quickly hit 50, today in fact. I do agree with the post because having to un/equip QoL perks like scrapper and lockpicking when out of combat is just tedious at best. But if there is a new system coming I look forward to seeing it!
---
Thanks. I'll message you when I'm on.
---
Can‚Äôt you craft it?
---
Alright see you there
---
Did you know that people back in the day considered him super ugly.....
---
I ended up his distant cousin.
---
Makes sense.
---
I want it for my PA character so I can yell BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD as I burst out of bushes at lowbies
---
Thanks man. Got confused for a minute didn't realize you couldn't trade atom shop painted armor
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm considering going for. I don‚Äôt actually have a vats build at all, so that won‚Äôt be a problem. Vats is just the only way to reliably hit a flying scorchbeast with the grenade launcher...
---
Big dick diplomacy
---
Found one here first try thx for the tip!
---
Try relogging

Speaking of anti armor explosive 50 cal. This morning at whitesprings I was going through checking the vendors just to see if anything decent had been sold and to get some lead when I came across a vendor bot selling a anti armor explosive 50 cal. Two star for 330 caps. I couldn't believe it and bought it immediately. I didn't even take the time to put on the hard bargain perk because I didn't want to chance it not being there if I backed out and came back in. Needless to say that was the best deal I have ever found at a vendor and by far the best firearm.  Just to think someone sold it to the bot for probably 50 caps if that.
---
I‚Äôve relogged twice and nothing :(
---
To craft the Garb, and upgrade it, you need to already have a Garb of lower lvl on you or in your stash
---
Damn, sorry I can‚Äôt help ya :/
---
if you drop it using the drop command, it's fair game for anyone to take. if you build it, it's yours and it will recall.

Is there a way you can upload the exact format on how you made him please and thanks if you can. I want this lol
---
No one was around me, I was in my camp. It never appeared when I dropped it.
---
Yeah look up the 100 day roadmap, coming in summer are several new updates one of which is the following. Unfortunately it's all the info we have so far.
---
New Feature: Legendary Players¬†‚Äì An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities.
---
If you're on xbox you can have mine. I'm never going to wear it. Clings to my hips too tight lol
---
Truth is, the game was rigged from the start
---
Yea if you have a level 3 lock pick you can get 4 or more every hop. Start at the down vertibird 1, head West to the red building with stair case up on the roof to your left that's 2, drop down next to medical center next building west is a level 3 lock inside is the 3rd and on the roof of the medical building is the 4th.
---
To be fair I did do the sheepsquatch impostors event so whole server was there
---
I have a TON in my stash box that I haven't used.  But I play on PC or Xbox.. Not PS4. I would give them to you otherwise!
---
I sat and listened to him list all of them out before. That was so funny.
---
Wow, related to Abraham Lincoln. That got to be a really conversation starter.
---
You know you can move the camp when placing it with the triggers...on console that is so you can kindoff move it around for a better veiw.
---
The top veiw idea i like that...
---
Im going to go and see if i can see my camp placement in photo mode brb.
---
Yea with a grenade launcher it‚Äôs trickier because the ammo is heavy and expensive. With a good heavy gun and right perks (3x heavy gunners, one gun army, etc) you won‚Äôt need VATS, those flying bats are large targets, you can mow them down with a 50 cal quickly. When they crawl out of the fissures you can kill them before they take off.
---
Nah on PC mate! BUT, I forgot you can just craft it! I kept seeing it as one of those holotape games and you just gotta find it haha. Appreciate the offer my friend! &lt;23
---
If the problem is that I‚Äôm not doing enough damage fully specced into shotguns, then swapping to a weaker weapon that I‚Äôm not specced into that is also short range won‚Äôt help.
---
If the problem is that the game is bugged, then swapping weapons won‚Äôt help. 
---
It‚Äôs definitely interesting to me that the cryolator works on her. Makes me regret not buying the 3* suppressors cryolator I saw at a vendor one time. And the original intent for my build was actually to be a support character. In fact, I‚Äôve been carrying around the syringer that lowers damage resistance, and I used it in the last few queen fights, although I have no clue if it even works on her. I will totally look into getting a cryolator, and I thank you for that... but it doesn‚Äôt really have anything to do with my problem.
---
It's great! Thanks for sharing.
---
For a second there I thought I was still playing destiny 2 reading posts in that sub.
---
Stuff just disappears into the nothingness sometimes, this is fallout 76 after all. Lesson learned, now you‚Äôll always remember you gotta place it, not drop it from here on out.
---
Does the punch bowl stay in the shop forever? I'm stuck out in the field doing training for my unit and won't be back until tomorrow.
---
Always place, never drop. Power armor has been slow to non-existent to show up for awhile. Doesn't help you now, but at least you know.
---
I second this. The mods on NV are epic. Dust is an entirely different game, a sequel even.
---
Sorry, from what I can tell they don't have indicators telling how much I adjusted each aspect of his face, I just kinda stretched and squished the face as I looked at a picture of him. Wish I could have had more help to give.
---
I placed 10 nukashine in my bowl and invited my friend over, he had NO idea. It was pretty funny to watch as he realised what I had done.
---
*BY THE GODS*
---
Thank you!
---
I really dont know. He just wasnt attacking me.
---
I actually don‚Äôt have any trouble killing scorchbeasts. Takes forever because the grenade launcher shoots so slow, but the damage is fine. Just pop out, vats shot, rinse and repeat. And when they land, I just circle strafe and blast them with my shotgun. Easy peasy. It‚Äôs just the queen giving me trouble apparently... her and the imposter are about the only things I can‚Äôt solo with ease. The enforcer perk is pretty OP.
---
hopefully when the preveyor comes out we will get legendary power armor, id even be okay if it was only 1\* prefixes
---
Thank you! And i dont really know. He just wasnt attacking me.
---
Yuh I know. So let's stop treating it like a looter shooter and get some actual fucking content in it instead of pushing shit looty shooty.
---
Under a bridge!  Low level players may be inclined to stick to roads or near them as it makes for easy enemy spotting ahead. The game has plenty of bridges all along the MSQ So you could probably pick one about the time people should be gearing up for Ash Heap. Perhaps even try to direct individuals to initiate the Excavator questline.
---
If you don't exclusively wear the civil war outfit and top hat while specializing in the lever action, black powder guns and fire axe I will be very very disappointed in you
---
So we don't really know each other, but I feel like we know each other. I'm so 100% onboard with this post. I don't understand why these things are not done through ammo and mods, like things that makes sense. 
---
Explosive ammo is 100% more rational than an explosive gun. And it totally is magic the way it is now.
---
Yea the ladder that lead to nowhere had no room at the top to get out of PA ( not enough room).
---
Or roofy laced  wine.
---
Good news is those are the weapons I'm going for
---
Had Mr Squeeze try to kill me and another player the other day. He was completely invulnerable so I'm pretty sure he would win vs SBQ. Even if it takes him a few days to cut her down.
---
Actually if you change veiws from 1st to 3rd person.(ps4 hold the touch pad). You can move your veiw out a bit while in that veiw outwards a bit. Best i got.
---
Sure hope so. Until power armor becomes an effective alternative against magic armors I won‚Äôt invest another atom in them.
---
Well, for the entirety of my play time I‚Äôve used shotguns, and as long as I got a hit marker I got credit, regardless of range. In the beta, a few months ago, and today. Except when it doesn‚Äôt. 
---
If you can prove it, you definitely should, but otherwise you shouldn‚Äôt be going around telling people it‚Äôs definitely not a rumor with nothing to back it up. Sorry to come off strong, but this is how misinformation gets spread.
---
I keep some unyielding and get myself low enough to get my Charisma up to 30 alone with just unyielding because of +3
---
Yeah I know that, but you can't see behind you. My CAMP is on a lake, and when placing it, you can't turn your body around to see where the border is when you're placing it. There is no way to do a 360 spin to see all of the border, without moving the CAMP Terminal.
---
We need to be able to see the exact spot the ring will be before we confirm the placement, basically. Because my last spot I had to move 5 times just to get it all where I wanted.
---
It wasn‚Äôt. I looked there first. :(
---
I believe the popular response to these threads goes something like.. "buy a new copy of the game make a new account and dont cheat this time"
---
Right here with you. I've got over 20 mutton pie plans. I did just get the flaming staff plan tho finally.
---
Okay - that made me chuckle.
---
What is this a picture of? There are no NPCs in this game
---
Now make Abradolf Lincler, you'll have even more fun.
---
Then there's guys who put down their camp just to use their stash wherever they are and keep walking.
---
You can get them from Helvetia? I always prowl the battle cemetery
---
I used to pick a high spot and watch them play. :-)
---

I've made about 5000 atoms just playing casually, think I've got about 250 hours played. Even took a whole month off. I think it's plenty. F76 and MGTA are pretty much the only two freemium (you can earn currency by playing as well as with real money) systems I've enjoyed out of many dozens of games.

They thought they‚Äôd seen the last of the Fat Man in 1945...
---
Well guess what? Truman‚Äôs back, with a new kind of Fatman! Prepare your anus, wasteland!
---
I think it‚Äôs possibly because of the total damage requires to take them down in a short period of time. When you‚Äôre soloing an SB you can take your time and put in all the shots needed, but in SBQ and ISS battles a bunch of people are attacking them at the same time, if most of them are using fast-shooting heavy weapons, they will register most of the damage before you put in enough shots. The advantage of heavy guns is their efficiency in delivering most damage in very short amount of time.
---
Possibly, be sure to toggle between them occasionally to make sure!
---
That mainly happens because your client doesn‚Äôt know that another player has already killed them I believe.
---
It's actually: "If you hadn't cheated, you wouldn't be in this position."
---
Truth, we need more meaningful cap sinks and a real economy
---
Yeah, I get same problem. Every now and then i'm lucky that there's even no lag at all. 
---
One of the issues with the game when it comes to performance is that it runs on a cloud server instead on a beefy dedicated server. They more and likely knew at the beginning the game's release date wouldn't do good, and so it would been the cheaper option to use cloud servers instead. Hopefully they do this before the game moves onto Steam since the game is doing a **lot** better than before.
---
Another problem that wasn't wise of them is reusing the 7 year old Creation Engine and then heavily modifying it. We saw how bad it perform in the beginning, and how it performed for Fallout 4. And no, if you ask, having a better API wouldn't make much of a difference. The game engine and how it's coded makes the biggest difference. 
---
Hopefully I was informational. :)

There is a quest where you go in the Watoga medical building but you have to leave the building to finish. The quest is to clear trespassers, but the trespassers aren't in the building. Hope this helps.

Hope in one hand and shit in the other, see which gets heavy first lol. I am cautiously optimistic about the legendary vendor but fear it will be a let down.
---
Lucky hole mine as others have said. Also theres a small cave halfway up in Tanagra town, that has a lot of crystal nodes to mine as well. Make sure to wear your excavator armor for mining ore, you get double the yield.
---
Murgle can be tamed, or at least it used to be possible. Can't see why they'd patch that out on purpose. Google his name...
---
Snitch lol
---
Sounds like you got reverse-camped at spawn lol
---
Keep in mind, all power armor spawn points in the world are either raider or t-series.
---
Raider will only ever spawn raider power armor, and only raider power armor
---
T series power armor spawn points can spawn any one of 45/51/60, and it is completely random which one, which makes getting a full set for any one of those three a matter of persistence.
---
Cranberry bog is the best area to search overall, as every brotherhood firebase has one T type spawn, Watoga has 6 if you can get around the bots, the generals steakhouse has one out back in a shed, and the various pre war bunkers also have them, this overall gives this are the highest density of power armor in the game, with close to 20 packed into a relatively small area

That makes 2 of us. I'm hoping they will release more details over the next few weeks leading up to the patch. If not mistaken it's something scheduled for June-ish...
---
Yes it does. That and the extra carrying capacity are the upsides of the excavator PA.

Did you have it painted with an Atom Store paint job?

I lost my 3 star Unyielding bos chest with 20% weapon  perk right after the camera came out. Maybe relayed but I don't know tbh

Just a future tip for you I believe you can lock specific items, I remember seeing a lock item option but I‚Äôm not entirely sure, might be on a weapons workbench

Tryin to steal my flavor.ive been "Honest Abe" for the last 3 months..

Setting 3 of the tables in kind of an L pattern [like this](https://i.imgur.com/tjtaISv.jpg) will allow you to put the bowl onto the center one. After you place the bowl you can delete the extra tables and move the remaining one where ever you want and the bowl will remain attached.

I just held it for about 2 hours. Didn't crash on me but got really framey and choppy if I was there for too long at a time. On xb1 as well.
---
If you're on PC and unable to get it back, I can build you a set
---
Is it just me or is I when you die by the Sheepsquatch imposter your game crashes while respawning XB1

I did this as soon as I found the civil war suit and hat, was already using an axe at the time.

It‚Äôs cool man I just bought a set from someone. I‚Äôm on Xbox as well. I appreciate it though man

Awesome! I'll give it a couple runs when I get home tonight. Thank you.

&gt; almost looted a 3* Bolstering Chest piece I have been grinding for two months to get, when the interface broke when the damn thing glitched thru the ground
---
In my experience (been able to replicate this half a dozen times) when the legendary enemy melts through the ground, it's actually teleporting back to where it spawned. I've been able to find the corpse and successfully loot the item in question more often than not.
---
Thanks man ily I got the achievement! Sadly my achievement for level 100 glitched and won't unlock. No 100% for me. :(

A tip:*head to the whitesprings resort*
---
Not at all, I just had the idea to make an Abraham Lincoln character, I made him and wanted to share it with other like minded folk like yourself.
---
If you used the "drop" command and not "place" it will destroy the PA if it has Atom Store paint on it. It's to prevent people from reselling Atom Store stuff. It should have given you a message before you dropped it that it would be destroyed.

not arguing about balance, just pointing out that the Fo fanbase is comprised mostly of singleplayers. and it shows considering the "top" players on youtube just jump in place spamming an AAE combat to the gound and call it "pro gaming".
---
You just answered the question I was gonna ask. Wasn't sure if it was T-45 or 51.
---
Yes!  This is such a big problem; most notably, as seen in the video, with the gatling gun.  I haven't had any problems with other guns, but when your up close with the gatling gun, even when there is no objects close, only enemies, it does the same thing with the aim going all over the place.
---
Did you do a SBQ event? I've gotten one from a drop so far

The smile really got me, really made him feel like the enclave/puppet master.

You get "improved" repair kits from the queen as loot. The basic repair kits are the ones for sale in atom shop. So essential the free ones in game are better since they repair to 150% condition.

I've been wanting to open a wasteland bar ever since player vending was announced.  I finished the build a week or so ago, and the new bar items in the atomic shop are the icing on the cake.  I'm waiting for the Pickaxe Pilsner and Old Possum signs to go on sale this weekend to finish it off, will probably post pictures later.
---
I run through Fort Defiance grabbing all the straight jackets. If the place is fully reset you get about 20 straight jackets and with some charisma and hard bargain you get 50 caps a piece. They only weigh .1 too which is always a plus.
---
Right, but in that case it‚Äôs a design problem. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm sitting back and barely hitting her. If spamming grenade launcher hits with a decent grenade launcher (executioners) for the entire fight doesn‚Äôt work, and shooting her in the face with an anti armor shotgun when she lands doesn‚Äôt work, both with all relevant perks applied, then what else can an explosives or shotgun build do? Aside from getting a really good legendary and/or going bloodied?
---
I mean, I guess I‚Äôm going to swap to heavy weapons either way. It was something I considered when I made the build way back in the beta, so I‚Äôve got room for all heavy gun perks. I just figured I‚Äôd be able to swap for the fun of it... not because my current build just doesn‚Äôt work, but only for the end boss. Ah well.

I dont spawn camp its them exploiting the update it doesnt matter if im near spawn or if theyve been running around for and find me far away from spawn. They shouldn't have invincibility forever it doesnt make sense.
---
Lol, yeah forgot to move the cursor.
---
Yeah. Highly likely. They might adjust it to lower the repair kits drop rate after the drama lessens but at least for the moment it's a pretty regular drop from SBQ. Like 25%+ chance per queen.
---
Cheers to you fellow abe
---
You have Improved repair kit, haven't you? They are obtainable from SBQ if you talking about improved repair kits.

Currently have Drifter outfit, with the Fastnacht Beret, Patrolman Sunglasses, and if needed favorited Assault Gasmask. 
---
During the winter months I was rocking Purple Ski Outfit, and Clean Ski Hat  
---
Depending on how some of the backpacks look coming up, I might go with one of my Nuka-Cola outfits. I have all except the red jacket, and jeans.
---
Cheers as well
---
Dude I just tried to build there yesterday! Was kinda bummed that none of my foundations could be placed farther down the bridge toward Harpers Ferry... Wanted to make a toll station. So I ended up moving just North East ish on the overlook right next to a titanium node üòé Cool base though!
---
Wait for the Death (Black) Rider or Pale. I like the amount of work that went into the War Rider, but it looks so cartoonish I can't pick it up. 
---
The Nukashine is 100% around the X-01 - like most of the armor paint sets. The T51 version of the Nuka should have gold accents on the helmet and a gold stripe.. instead it has the basic silver accents &amp; some matte tan stripe which looks wrong. I'd petition for a change but I doubt they'd do it.
---
Those are some wildly high expectations...the number of people needed on a server to populate it in any kind of meaningful way in that scenario is muuuch higher than the 24 or whatever it is now. Even 100 people on this map and you'd have just like 1 main city and a maybe 2 or 3 others.
---
Looks like Borderlands to me.  Cool!
---
I have an X-01 torso with jet pack attached I'm not using. Yours if you want it.
---
Glad you like it man.
---
6 Yao guis spawning back to back me and my team where not ready for that Beary scary attack
---
I ran into someone while fighting 3 yuo. He looked like an old man and made weird noises in his mic. I died and came back to him waiting and as I got close he made more odd noises and looted my dropped junk.
---
I survived a whole mini nuke plus a car explosion. Along with scorched and being shot at by the player I was fighting.
---
So me and my friends were playing and we encountered a guy my friends friendslist.
---
We all decided to avoid him because we didn't know him but eventually he started chasing us and we got to the place where you get the T Fuse for the responders quest.
---
Me and my friend that don't know this guy draw our weapons and agree to fire in a moment while the friend that does know this guy is hiding behind a trashcan.
---
My friend shoots him once with a pipe pistol and is instantly taken down to half health. He hides behind a destroyed car to use a stimpak. Then I start throwing grenades. Most of them missed. He shot a mini nuke at me and I threw my last grenade and blew a car up next to him and he died instantly because he wasn't in a group. 
---
This guy was a level 70 while I was level 25 so he should have won because he had power armor and an op gun. But I got lucky.
---
So after the flashes go away my friend yells "WTF did you fucking nuke yourself?!!" While my other friend is laughing. I am down and one of them picks me up.
---
He returns and we start running again and then get away.
---
Spawned In at my camp near Whitesprings. There was a bethemoth AND a Flat woods monster with the whitesprings guard. Needless to say that was a interesting fight. Shortly after battling all of these opponents a scorchbeast swooped down and his entourage showed up and they too met a gruesome fate. It was a long hard battle and the best experience I‚Äôve had in the game.
---
Definitely man, what did you want for it?
---
Definitely man what did you want for it?
---
Nothing. I'm on now. IGN: Entretic
---
It's cool at the time I was a literal lumberjack. Didn't have much time. It's cool. 
---
I was just making a statement about my personal play style. Even in Fo4 my main is level 70. If I get tired of that I switch characters and delete them when I die old fashioned hardcore style. Gives me a chance to look into other card combination without the threat of it being a commitment.
---
I know this has little to do with the original post but would anyone know where to get the science scribe outfit?
---
Enclave officer uniform with sentrybot helmet, aka wasteland cobra commander
---
Getting on now, appreciate it.
---
Dont man, if you gotta wait until your next check to buy some digital shit, it ain't worth it in the long run.
---
Alright, very cool. Thank you. I think I just need to hit a high concentration area and hope I get lucky. I already did mayor for a day, so Watoga may be the way to go!
---
How?
---
Interesting, Well i have one if needed.
---
It was limited time.
---
I've had a lot of issues with the handmade. I play a stealth/heavy build, and I'll go for a headshot and my bullets  hit above them. I can see nothing blocking my shot, but my line of fire has been angled (almost like an auto-aim system is trying to adjust the target).
---
Was thinking they could add the settlement Transmitter from fallout 4. Make it a township beacon that lets people build near you. Everyone still gets to maintain their own build limit, just closer.
---
Nice, very cool! I'll report back if I have any luck!
---
 Yeah, bears often spawn at the end of the Freds BBQ Free Range event. So I've got acid for days currently
---
If you gotta wait until your next paycheck, you  should probably not be spending money on Fallout...well unless you're still young and live at home n whatnot.
---
I do too, every time lol
---
What all melee weapons are considered fist weapons? I would like to start a fist only character. Why do you have Pharmacist 1 and First Aid 2? When you have a healing factor mutation?
---
My buddy did on a junk pile for a long time. It was like being in the mire...
---
I used to live down the street from a random spawn w a soccer ball and would kick it into my garage every time I travelled home only for it to disappear as soon as I‚Äôd leave again.
---
You should be able to tho i have a few renamed
---
THATS GENIUS! Give Chally-Moo-Moo and Grahm a traveling food truck lolol
---
If you enjoy fallout 76 you should try fallout 3 fallout new Vegas and fallout 4 all very good games as well
---
Brotherhood engineers outfit with welding mask, field scribe with fasmacht beret or the vault 76 overalls with the yellow mining helmet and a pipe wrench.
---
It could be pulled gondola-style so he still wanders!
---
LMAO I just found it, thanks. Deleting this post now lol
---
my AAE laser breaks in like 4 mags lol so might trade it
---
I have mine south of Sutton station near the truck. It's a great spot, rarely gets attacked and has a friendly army robot nextdoor.
---
I feel like you're on the edge of wanting this game to be something else entirely. But not quite there. 
---
Elder scrolls online is the Zenimax MMO, Fallout 76 is more of an answer to Grand Theft Auto Online, a 30ish player drop in lobby with things to do, anything beyond that seems like very wishful thinking. It's an FPS with custom builds, and in those types of games it can be extremely difficult to get anyone to play anything that isn't just a glass cannon (much less damage focused) outside of games made with some kind of RPS or "trinity" roles.
---
In my opinion it's better than the alternative of requiring roles such as a charisma support and then not being able to join a group because you aren't one, or taking forever to form a group because you can't find one.
---
At the same time no group is going to turn down or shun someone who doesn't have an optimal damage build. It's less Rpg-like than I would prefer, but it's also doesn't suffer from the flaws of those systems, while still offering choices.
---
There‚Äôs bridge just north of Harper‚Äôs Ferry that you can build a neat hide-a-camp underneath.
---
Though I suggest the Savage Divide for fast traveling middle ground
---
Anderson SC Here!
---
I second this. And give us a wider viewing angle so we can get a glimpse on where we out CAMP radius would be.
---
You'd be fine, servers are not regional and you can always join in on friends
---
It makes me wonder how he got over the psychotic breaks from being a super mutant.
---
This seems like the embodiment of the "no witchhunting" rule.
---
Thanks!
---
What do you mean?
---
You get 3 improved repair kits per SBQ kill
---
Not a fan of their music?
---
No problem. Have fun.
---
**MUST. CHOP. WOOOOOOD!**
---
Oh wait, that's George Washington...
---
Nah, more country meself
---
Any DC, MM, power fist or knuckles would be a one handed melee (fist weapon)
---
 Pharmacist; Because of rads takin sometimes after you die. You spawn in the nuke zone. I hot key rad away. Take a few and haul ass. By the time I make it out I'm back to almost 20-30% life. 
---
First aid; because sometimes you get overwhelmed with scorched taking alot of dmg and need a quick boost of life.
---
Mine have been disappearing but it seems to be a massively increased rate of depletion causing it.  Not sure if they‚Äôve been nerfed or whether it‚Äôs a glitch.
---
Either way it‚Äôs bloody annoying.
---
Make the bonuses increase multiplicatively instead of additively so 5x Sentinel/Cavalier pieces becomes 26% reduction instead of 75%. Also fix the bug that makes VATS Crits ignore all mitigation.
---
I dont carry a lot of anything,but I carry very little stims so first aid helps by giving more life more quickly.
---

---
You're not allowed to name and shame on this sub. If a mod sees it they will take it down
---
Aren't there 4 vaults now?
---
Have not played NV for about a year and a half. I may have to go back and try Dust. Thanks.
---
Ok.  I get that.  I've played MMOs since DAoC, including Age of Conan, WoW, Asheron's Call 2, SWToR, ESO, DDO, EvE, (Tried) Lienage, LotRO, Perpetuum, Tabula Rasa (died too young), WHO...  So yes, I guess other than Tabula Rasa and one or two others to some degree, all had/have a reliance on class/team work to achieve the end goal.
---
And yes, there's the point that if you specialise too much you end up resulting in FOTM situations where people get left out... and then there'll be the balance questions between classes, not the just weapon types we have now...
---
Beyond whatever locations and short quests they create, pvp or faction-based pvp is probably what will keep players interested in the game. If you could choose a faction and hunt down players from other factions (solo or within a team) it would be a start.
---
False. I've been collecting lots of bottles of Alcohol from the wasteland and it gave me the option to put all of my collected drinks into the bowl. I just put Rum in the punch bowl right now.
---
Ok thanks for the feedback. It's edited to work now
---
 I had one at a pond. It was perfect! I built a base in the middle of the bond, purifiers outside. Planted crops in the mud. Solid recommendation though, build a wall around everything. Radtoads happen to attack often.
---
Hunters long coat and Fasnacht barat. Or western coat and hat (atom shop).
---
I like to take a workshop, put a bunch of water purifiers there and sell the water.
---
Now you need Lincoln's Repeater Rifle from Fallout 3.
---
Yeah, wish they had that in game
---
Quarry X3 also works quite well. Always a queen, and kinds spawn pretty often on the other side of the quarry.
---
Unfortunately, The story is over. 100% The only new story is what is added in the future for me. I wander, and wander, and occasionally find a rare little nook I missed, maybe one or two a here and there, but this is basically down to turning over stones and looking under rocks for a teddy bear display I may have missed. I pick up my camp and move, rebuild it about once a month. I mean at this point there isn't much left to do other than shoot and loot for something to do. There are only so many times you can wander the same places before its boring. 
---
I wander, do my daily, work on challenges. The game has to have some kind of progression right? I have also been over analyzing my builds as a new hobby. 
---
How about trying to not define other players experience and playstyle based on your own? 
---
I don't demand anything as far as drops go, I mean that loot carrot is the only carrot left at this point. (other than promised content) If I get those perfect legendary drops then there is NOTHING left for me. 
---
So, for now, I will continue to wander around and grind for those legendary drops I want.
---
Everything? Good builds, which rely on good weapons/armor to survive. Most popular are "bloodied". Less health=more damage. This, combined with armor that reduces damage from players and boosts stats at low health, is borderline OP.
---
This is just a big maybe but ive noticed that water and food deplete between playsessions without being in a server so maybe fusion cores do the same, although going thru 10 of them seems odd.
---
But all that plastic wastedüò¢
---
Actually... I see how it can be seen in a similar light to The Division, just simpler.  I enjoyed that too.
---
When I say ten I mean more like 6-7.
---
Yeah being a lumberjack will definitely eat into your time and possibly injure you. I used to be a structural Ironworker so I know how physically draining that is and a top 5 most dangerous job at that  stay safe out there!
---
Turn in technical data at Camp Venture. Chance to drop. Coincidentally what my favorite outfit is, with Urban Scout Armor mask.
---
I've been using PA, but will sometimes have like 7 and then realize I have like 3. And I've got all the perks, so it shouldn't be going through them that fast? I dunno. Sucks for real.
---
Wow so cynical. Better than a roast.
---
 I was the kind of kid that took apart his expensive robot toys to see what made them work. When I had it all figured out I would build my own. Out of the scraps. So to say the least this game is a little up my alley.
---
If the game gets boring and stagnant because there is no new content. When they said they wouldn't make us pay for it because the atom shop micro transactions would pay for it. Players keep bitching about the atom shop. 
---
And here I am proudly stating I do have a life outside of pouring real hours in to a game with a low level character because yes this game is exactly what I wanted. Not because I am simple minded as your statement remarks. I am a tinker, worked as a lumberjack, and make extra money selling scrap metal in the real world.
---
If you want new stuff give them funds or wait it out. I dropped out of Art college because I noticed the growing relationship between dev and consumer. And said to hell with it. It not that I am lazy. I compare graphics to reality. Look over concepts and compare them to reality. I am sorry did my play style offend your toxic gammer sensibilities.
---
-_-
---
Just do lots of nukes 2 to 3 levels each dropping on scorchbeast queen. I do this everyday and it still works past level 200
---
This is true, and I have played very casually IMO since launch I am around 170 now and have 4 alts of varying levels.
---
I think I'd probably die irl if I lost my PA lol. :(
---
It's been a bug for some time. Plague walker triggers the cows to attack in the Free Range event. One of the many things they haven't fixed.
---
Are you sure you didn't drink it all yourself and not remember?
---
I would love to run a shop or a pub or something, but the trading system is AWFUL. I used to enjoy holding workshops and building up community centers with free services and resources for all but, well we all know how workshops are now. Even with all of the resources open for anyone to take, nice amenities etc. Always some higher level ass hat just come to kill you can take for the shits and giggles. So Bethesda ruined that for me.
---
‚ÄúCorrect me if I‚Äôm wrong, Sandy, but if I kill all the golfers they‚Äôre gonna lock me up and throw away the key.‚Äù
---
It's almost like Bethesda has no idea how pvp should work.
---
I spawned in by prime site Delta and within a minute I was fighting three scorchbeast at once... I ended up raging just a tad bit.
---
That will be coming in a future update detailed in one of the inside the vault articles on the fallout website.
---
Graham represents the dream fallout 76 didn't do. NPC's with personality, that motivate us and make the world feel alive. Players don't do that. Players live through the story, they're not creating it. Graham is my favorite because he's the exception.
---

Bruh, you gotta cinch it.
---
Borderlands is nothing more than a run and gun by definitions and design. PoE is cool, but something just couldn't hold me too long. It got boring quick. Probably because I have played all the Diablo style diablo in my life I ever needed when Diablo was new.
---
Praise to the L√∂rd of The L√§mp.
---
i have the atoms but im more fond of the upcoming black rider(sp?) one the t-60 variant
---
This is how we farm our mats and caps.  Most importantly, our fun.
---
I played PoE for a full season. There is a story? lol. I pretty much just mashed through it and skipped the story as quickly as possible. it wasnt interesting to me.
---
76 is an MMO lite. Contains many aspects of an MMO just scaled back a lot.
---
Well, how about you stop. üôÉ
---
Worth the sacrifice lol
---
Oh really? That's good to hear.
---
Well there should be alcohol toxicity and drug overdose in this game if you take too much at once, with major impact on your character all along the way.
---
I remember back in the first Everquest, you could get drunk and your character swayed, if you kept drinking your vision would get impaired etc.
---
I'm hoping that will come to pass. The PVP server should satisfy the PVP crowd. So much whining about dedicated PVP servers and now it's here asshats are still trying to PVP in the  PVE server.  BSG should eliminate PVP completely in Adventure so mediocre PVP players can't grief the PVE server with their duped weapons.
---
Automatic... TSE weapons work better when you're firing around the mod due to the explosive splash damage rather then direct hits.
---
Soccer's for commies. Why do you hate freedom, vault dweller?
---
I'm afraid they end up in Skyrim.
---
Exactly i get the spawn invincible thing but it shouldn't be like were adventure mode waiting for someone to shoot before we can shoot
---
Let's get a presidential crew together lol
---
Not even a please wow
---
Yes! Definitely if ur on Xbox then Abe and the others could get together soon.
---
Straight numbers. The semi-auto will do more damage. Max out all the rifle perks, get the hardened reciever, bloody mess, tank killer, etc, etc. The gun will be pretty beastly. 
---
Used to have one.
---
Probably just sizing you up. I ignore random trade invites
---
mothman is best man
---
Please post pics I will eagerly await to see it!!!
---
Yeah it's on the 100 day roadmap they showed off a while back. 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
Place items from your stash in your camp.
---
Nice yurt. I tried so hard to get my walls to be even like that, but just couldn't do it for some reason.
---
But it dosen't suck.
---
Sunrise Field, just south of Watoga, also usually spawns kings and a queen (she is hiding in the pool of water). 
---
Highland Marsh in the Mire is also a decent spot, though not sure if kings are guaranteed there. 
---
Kite the queen until she spawns hatchlings, then push the bodies together and bam, you're done.
---
I always ignore unless I establish trade before hand.
---
Some people just like to harass players that don‚Äôt sell them stuff
---
There used to be an issue with certain heavy weapon shots going through enemies when they got up in your face, maybe this is their system that attempted to fix it being overzealous/bugging out.
---
I'll pay u caps to build it for me
---
At one camp spot I would randomly find various dead animals right in front of the stove: frogs, squirrels, radstag etc
---
Nice! I built there a while back. Love that place and have been really tempted to go back.
---
Cry
---
U can get the plans from the market subs
---
do you have the scatter barrel for that shoot multiple lasers instead of one?
---
I have wondered a long time now. Why do you lock the doors?
---
I see no real advantage to doing it. I put my generators in a room with no windows or doors, mobs always attacked my locked doors. Now with no turrets and no locked doors they just seem to want to chew on crops, signs, and water hand pumps. 
---
But I mean if someone wants to damage your camp a locked door isnt gonna stop them. 
---
No turrets seems to get my camp attacked less, and the turrets didnt shoot the mobs half the time anyway, Super mutants just stand out of range and shoot.

---
Lol if i had a tse handmade that be nice
---
yeah! beam splitter or whatever
---
I hope his in game name is cheekbones
---
theres your answer lol, with that barrel on, that laser rifle aint gonna last
---
As I was reading all the responses, I was like "yes, YES, Yass!"( Axes, levers, black powder, civil war outfit)
---
I like to walk around and give out free ammo that I'll never use. I got the idea from some random dude who came up to my camp. At first, I was like, oh great... He wants to fight. But, then he said in a kinda creepy whisper. Here. I'm give you some free junk. He sat down the bag and left. I was a little creeped out for about 30 minutes. Lol. It's nice to see people doing right by others. If not in real life than at least in a video game.
---
I mean, there are ways to censor course language. Not a live chat but like a server wide message board. Its too tedious messaging 1 player let alone 2. Sure there are potential issues but there are ways around it.
---
Sometimes when I go in  I am on pacifist and forget to turn off. It is weird, kind of like sometimes my chat volume is zero when I am on. PS4 btw, do not know if its a buggy thing or not.
---
Nothing worse as a sneak vats build than hunting a person for right moment then doing no damage.
---
But either way Edo is right, gear and perk set ups help alot. Also, being a group makes things more manageable. Extra eyes/damage and the ability to plan out attack strategies is pretty fun.
---
I always do the lumbermill with butcher‚Äôs bounty maxed out and server hop. Then make sure to have chemist and super duper on when you make everything. :-)
---
Believe it or not,  but a random player that saw me near the enclave vendor dropped one for me today ‚ù§
---
I have been collecting bobbleheads in the hope that one day I will be able to display them
---
I still can't even find that damn pro snap camera!
---
Who wants to make love to Grahm?
---
Love the dedication. Well done.
---
i got all those perks already xD it just the problem is to find more places with tick enemies
---
How did i get down voted just for saying it's their servers which they claimed. .. jesus
---
I feel this i server hopped yes for a solid hour.
---
Awesome work - seen a few camps here
---
I must have missed that. Cheers for the link man.
---
Level 230 here. Higher level players are oftentimes looking to buy your treasure maps. They already have most of the quest lines completed, have learned most of the buyable plans and mods, and are looking to expand their character‚Äôs capabilities.
---
The secret Enclave Holotapes really help explain MODUS. If you haven't listened to them id recommend it

---
I'm sorry but wheres converter not on this one?
---
Hell, I used to be one of those players who took workshops build them up to small outposts and left everything unlocked for anyone to grab freely. I love building in this game. 
---
So here lil old me just trying to build the workshop into the best community centers I could. Beds, food, crops, resources, all open and free for anyone. But noooooo, someone of a higher level has always got to come and kill me just to take it. No reason other than the PvP and thrill of 1 shotting me. 
---
And for what? Everything opened and unlocked, they gained literally nothing but the thrill of being an ass hole. So. I quit doing it. 
---
Wont do it any more until something changes. 
---
At least when the capture circle was there I had a chance to fight, not its the whole damn workshop and they are all one shot explosive stealth builds. 
---
Its pointless to spend my time and materials to provide services and access for low level and high-level players alike when people like this come along. 
---
I wish there was an option that would pop up where you could have an openly shared ownership with as many players as wanted.
---
I have mine set up on the stream by the overseers camp, all crafting stations, four beds, and food and water resources. I think it's a great spot to be noticed by the lower levels or others in the area.
---
Love bridge builds. This one is great.
---
I'm kinda sad I laughed at this convo
---
Ooooo baby now you're talking my language, I'll work on the build tomarrow. See you in the wastes !
---
Coagh?
---
Holy sheeeet. Thank you!
---
Yeah I asked on here before moving my first time to be sure -- not like we get a tutorial or quest to explain it better. :(  def confusing at first.
---
my non-death-related bagdrops are always a mix of the following: missiles, 40mm nades, shitty armor and weapons I accidentally picked up, small amounts of ammo for guns I don't use. (2mm ec, cryolator ammo, etc)
---
I instantly thought futurama.....TRUMANS BAAAAACCK!
---
I wish we could pickpocket grenades INTO peoples' pockets like you could in previous games.
---
this shit is fucking broken. people with 4-5 armor pieces with these modifiers are basically invincible in survival, which is FUCKING RIDICULOUS. yes, the modifiers exist to give you an upper hand, but no one should be able to tank 40+ auto grenade launcher rounds w/ corresponding weapon perks and barely flinch.
---
I‚Äôve seen this happen a lot with a combat shotgun, aiming dead center and you‚Äôll see the shogun bursts go upwards to the right, does not happen with a double barrel though, even at quad bursts.
---
Well played take this upvote
---
I constantly have heavy shots unable to hit close enemies. There's also a glitch where when you zoom in with a heavy, the shots get set off to one side, so you end up having to aim to the left of everything for awhile thereafter.
---
What I'm saying is the shotgun is the whole problem here. I've experienced the same thing. If I only hit the queen with a shotgun, I don't get loot from her or the event. You need to hit her with basically anything else and the cryolator is a good option because you can be very useful without having to change your build.
---
The Kanawha County Cemetery will also spawn ticks but not exclusively. Sometimes it will spawn bloatflies, bloodbugs, ghouls, etc. a couple things to keep in mind though; you can server hop with no cooldown on the shack, lumber mill or cemetery. I would also highly recommend getting Chemist, Super Duper, and Butcher‚Äôs Bounty.  Butcher‚Äôs Bounty will give you much more tick blood. Chemist will double the amount of chems you make. Super Duper gives the chance to double on top of Chemist.
---
Niiice. Thank you! I'll check it out!
---
God, I want that tile flooring so bad.
---
PC has always had plenty of people.
---
I use a Ripper a lot which matches the Science Scribe outfit, medical goggles+surgical smile mask for a funny face
---
They mentioned a bobblehead display in specific in an inside the vault, so youre all good there
---
the true fallout experience
---
- Fast travel to Treetops in The Mire.
---
- Follow the dual lane road north, towards the river.
---
- Once across the river, keep the river to your left and head west. Look for a metal shack (unmarked). There should be a chain-link fence surrounding it and a bombed out semi-truck beside it.
---
- Make sure you have a maxed out Butcher's Bounty perk card equipped. 
---
If you server hop, you'll find 6 - 8 ticks every time. When you join a new server, it'll place you near Treetops and it's only a few seconds to walk over there. Be careful though, there are two random spawn points on the road, very near each other.
---
Has anyone else tried scrapping vegetable starch and only gotte. 2 adhesive per each starch.  Spent a lot of time making an adhesive farm and this happened to me tonight.  I will try it again tomorrow.  Was really frustrated at the output.
---
This would require a ton of infrastructure to the game tbh
---
Were they all full?  A while back they changed the ones you find in the wild to about 1/4 full.  Result is you go through them faster since each is only a partial charge.  
---
The ones from fusion generators are full charge.
---
I‚Äôd say make it so that once someone contests the workshop, you‚Äôre safe until you enter the workshop radius to defend. Once you enter, you‚Äôre flagged for PvP with that person until one of you dies. 
---
Because it would be annoying if you were actively defending it and accidentally stuck a toe too far out of range.
---
Holy crap, you‚Äôre completely right. The community economy has undergone radical deflation in recent months from the amount of people sitting at the 25k limit, instead requesting item to item trades. With fast travel as the only reliable way for Bethesda to devalue the cap, it‚Äôs next to impossible to stimulate that economy without introducing a new currency; THAT‚ÄôS the reason they won‚Äôt increase the limit, it‚Äôll devalue the cap even more.
---
Yeah, I am sure the chameleon tse one shot on my level 12 alt vs your level 200 is "Fun" Lots of play out of that lol. All the caps and mats my level 12 has. lol.

*laugh track ensues*

Beyond the aim, for console players such as myself they have this really weird and inconsistent sensitivity with looking around. It like has an acceleration rate that makes it really hard to have quick snapping aiming adjustments. Go play Call of Duty and see their pin point and consistent aiming compared to beth games, its abysmal.
---
all i can think of is try completely powering off your xbox by holding the power button in till it shuts down...or clear the "reserved space" file from the game ...THIS WILL DELETE YOUR PICS so only do it if step one doesn't work
---
I had my handmade doing this all day today my shots would be an inch or two over the reticle
---
We don't get the bottles from the Nuka Cola we drink though? 
---
Still, it would be nice. I'm tired of hunting for lead, the motel and the fire station never have any weights and I'm too lazy to move my camp to a lead deposit..lol.
---
Honest Abe died over 150 years ago and those jokes *just* left the "too soon" zone; best believe if the library's open.
---
What's high level to you
---
If you're scrapping fast their poor choice of overloading the tab functionality can lead to accidental confirmations of the dialog when you expected to back out instead. This is emblematic of the poor, incohesive UI/UX that is Fallout.
---
Yeah black rider looks awesome, if I cant get the war rider I will be getting the black, just depemds on if I get paid before or after the sale ends lol.
---
Yea but they want an arm and a leg for one plan. Just need balloons and streamers for the grand opening of my bar and grill.
---
I agree we should get the bottles from Nuka Cola, beer , wine, whiskey , bourbon, vodka and rum. That would help in getting bottles for brewing/fermenting.
---
Well played

It's not anything to do with account security, just another bethesda bug. Don't spam scrapping items
---
It's a naked mutant panda bear, some DLC for a future update so Fallout can be accused of going all WoW on us.
---
Tbh I like this game a lot but if I‚Äôm being unbiased it‚Äôs definitely not AAA quality. I mean the game crashes daily but it‚Äôs still nothing compared to the first 3 months, but I mean who can honestly say that fo76 runs smooth? The game in general is just buggy, it feels like I torrented it or got a free code from some weird website, yet it‚Äôs a $60 game from a known popular studio. There‚Äôs no reason for a game that costs top dollar, by a veteran studio to be this bad as far as basic playability.
---
This game is a few minutes a week kind of game for me now because it‚Äôs just not entertaining long term so it‚Äôs best to just play in short spans tbh, it also feels a little less buggy when do it like that, I usually just stop playing after the first crash (maybe about 30mins-1h not counting the crashes while trying to start).
---
No, not that particular bug... The people saying they have their guns go missing out of their stash.
---
That did it! Finally got some level 30 51 pieces! Thank you!
---
Lost bulk steel and lead the other day...
---
Who cares they're not unbeatable
---
I don‚Äôt know what constitutes high v low but I‚Äôve got all these known plans which I try and offload all the time, I‚Äôm LV 45 which isn‚Äôt high but i try to trade the plans off to lowers for free or just dump them and get their attention. 
---
Is there a trade glitch?
---
If you‚Äôre Xbox I can place some for free tmw.
---
I go for semi-automatic 'cause don't wanna waste my precious 5.56 ammo.
---
Level 400+ I‚Äôm just interested in seeing people‚Äôs weapons haha
---
Maybe their cracking down with stealth deletes since the duped weapons have tagged markers in their coding.
---
I always get protrectrons under my generator building
---
Bought it yesterday. Put it on my ultracite armor. Looks nice. Plan on getting all the horsemen skins (BSG should be happy) since they work with any type of armor.
---
What time cause I get on real late. 3am to 5 am central time
---
Every time I start playing the past 2 weeks it starts with the over encumbered warning, but I never am.  It doesn't affect my playing but don't understand why its always popping up.
---
People who DON'T nuke babies make me SICK!
---
If I had faith in Bethesda, I‚Äôd say this sounds like a recoil effect from not having a shotgunning skill, or too low a strength to handle a gun that size.  Like if you cranked up strength and shotgunning perks, it‚Äôd pull everything back to center.  
---
But we‚Äôre not that naive any more.
---
Yeah that was my thinking but I cant afford to buy atoms. The plauge marine..I mean rider looked cool too.
---
Grahm is more

The best thing I could recommend is to pick a weapon specialty (for example try to get all 3 perks (regular expert and master) maxed for one type of weapon, be it single hand melee or rifles and any supporting cards that ignore armor or modify attack speed) cards like bloody mess in luck will also help contribute to your damage output. Make sure the weapons you are using are not too low of level
---
It's a really beautiful location. Just be prepared to fight anglers every now and then
---
Imposter helmet, prisoners collar, and those wraps from mothman museum
---
It's possible, but people that are afflicted are claiming they were drops they received. In giving them the benefit of the doubt, this could be one reason for it.
---
I would love to be able to sell blueprints to other players they could just plop down.
---
I've always thought this was a bit odd, but maybe it balances itself out with the phantom bottles we create to hold our purified, dirty and bottled water.
---
Had two of my best weapons vanish this past weekend.. Talk about demoralizing. Someone said it might be due to renaming, so I restored the original names. I managed to replace one gun (only a * Gatling) but the other is a total loss (** MG42). BSG better figure this out fast....
---
Hmmm hard to say. One time a deathclaw kept running away from me so I chased him until I cornered him and he still wouldn't attack for some reason.
---
There was also the time I murdered my pet deathclaw and he was dead for weeks until one day he just reincarnated into a radstag...who I also murdered.
---
I've been experiencing a lot of weird stuff involving deathclaws for some reason...
---
I‚Äôm a level 104 and I just like seeing the different things that people have and see if I have anything they need. I find it entertaining to see some of the different combinations of weapons and armor people use.
---
I spam scrap all the time. If that causes it, I better slow down scrapping stuff as I can't keep losing my main  weapons....
---
How much are you looking for?
---
There is no damage in adventure mode outside pvp anymore. They were able to kill you because you still owned the workshop.
---
It's built similarly to fallout 4, enemies near the end are supposed to be bullet sponges unless you have a min-maxed build. With that in mind, there are a few ways to reach god mode status:
---
Instigating explosive weapons with a maxed out sneak build (ninja, covert ops, mister sandman, etc). Especially good on semi auto weapons like a handmade rifle because you can keep stacking sneak attack criticals while well hidden until the enemies see you. With the way armor works in this game, dealing one strong shot is much better than dealing multiple weaker shots that add up to the same damage number
---
Bloodied weapons. That's mostly the current meta. With low health, you can benefit from bloodied legendary weapons (~90-95% damage boost), unyielding legendary armor (+3 special per piece while at low health, up to a total of +15), and a few perks like nerd rage (+ damage and some other bonuses while at low health). 
---
It's better for melee because of a ridiculous +15 bonus to strength and much better agility/endurance for sprinting to enemies, but even with guns this is a massive boost. The low health isn't as much of a problem as you would think, it's mostly just annoying having to deal with radiation because most people stay at this health by forcing their rads up to ~900. You will get one-shot out of nowhere once in a while from some powerful enemies, but honestly if you stay back and play carefully you will kill anything before it comes anywhere close enough to hit you
---
Explosive shotguns are also ridiculous. Some genius decided that each pellet (not each shot, but each individual projectile) should do 20% of the base damage of the gun in explosive damage. Before the TSE nerf update, you could reach numbers up to 2000+ per shot by stacking the right effects. Even now you can still one-shot most enemies with them.
---
Nothing else really comes anywhere close to those overpowered combos. Melee weapons with swing speed and strength boosts are pretty good. Two shot explosive or anti-armor explosive guns are always a strong alternative. The handmade rifle, combat shotgun, and gatling plasma are all very powerful; getting a semi-decent effect on them can carry you through the whole game tbh. 
---
On top of that, don't forget stacking effects. Even non-legendary weapons can become pretty formidable once you get a 60% bonus from perks, 15% total bonus from bloody mess, 25% bonus from drugs, 2.5x-3.75x sneak attack bonuses, any applicable armor penetration from perks or receivers, and just good ol' headshots
---
I‚Äôm going to give this a try. I‚Äôve already uninstalled and reinstalled the game, no luck. Rebooted the Xbox a few times, same shit.
---
Over lvl 100 for the most part
---
The best part was you would physically move left and right even if ya sat down. Kill my self twice in tree city (kelethen) or something near that spelling I think
---
If it were WoW or LoL or similar, I could see hacking into accounts to steal items. But for 76? Where we don‚Äôt even have economies established in-game yet? 
---
I highly doubt that. Plus, believing every, or even most, persons affected was a legitimate drop is suspect in and of itself. 
---
But I reserve the right to be totally wrong, as it hasn‚Äôt happened to me, and I‚Äôm unable to verify my previous post. My hunch is based on how Beth codes their game (used to mod Oblivion/Skyrim/FO4) and the changes implemented after removing TSE lasers and co.
---
They can't take stuff from your inventory without you agreeing to it. More than likely they want to offer you some stimpaks or other stuff they have just weighing them down. Or they might want to give you free stuff. I personally never trust those paper bags to spawn, and when they do it can be a paint in the ass to get the other player to release your giving them free stuff doing that way.
---
If you have it painted with atom shop paint it‚Äôs gone because dropping it destroys it.
---
There is not a trade glitch. A rumor got started around launch that there was one, but it was complete BS. Nobody can get anything from your inventory unless you agree to it.

Wait he‚Äôs evil? Why the fuck have I been working for him! He said I was appreciated and it seemed like everyone was trying to destroy him and I thought he was the victim and... my god. All those nukes.
---
That's why I had it :) didn't even get to make 1 round before it all disappeared.
---
Cap limit is 25k. 15k could get you a good weapon (and by good I mean good, not a god roll) or a couple of good armor piece's.
---
Well that‚Äôs the first I‚Äôve heard anyone say that shotguns don‚Äôt work period. 
---
So if shotguns don‚Äôt work, and explosives don‚Äôt work, and that‚Äôs literally all I got, then how did I get loot the one time?
---
Regardless of what exactly is broken, this needs to be fixed.
---
Yes. For the first time in forever I'd actually gotten Poseidon for an hour to farm cores because the 25% ones are gone in a blink.
---
it mostly depends, mainly if you can find someone who wants caps. i personally do accept caps for item trades. if anything so i can cram them into Modus's terminals for Serum plans. basically getting caps out of the economy
---
I rotated to all the locations and got nothing. I guess hopping for an hour is better
---
Even the 'padded' mod (for chest armor) is enough to save you. You can go toe to toe with an enemy, blast away with an explosive shotgun and still lose very little health; same with standing on top of a car/bus just as it explodes. Its also sold by vendors, but you can unlock it by scrapping armor too. I have that mod for metal, robot and combat chests, and my characters are sub Level 200.
---
Dense is the best mod though, I usually find it selling (for marine) at Watoga Station, and it's there probably 10-20% of the time.
---
Dealing with those radscorpians: If I can't get to higher ground I'll jump up (with marsupial) and fire  down at it as soon as I see it coming for me. I'm hoping around and firing like crazy when there's 2 or 3 of 'em after me. I doubt I'd survive without having any explosive legendaries.
---
Yes. Find the trading forums. I'm done for the night, but if you'd like to peruse my saved legendaries I have a bunch of good 3* weapons and armor I'd really like to get rid off for stash space. I have a3* Anti-Armor light machine gun I'd love to get rid of, tried it tonight. Works very nicely even without me having the perks for it. A few 2 star knives that do a nice job. They're discouraging trading on here, but feel free to message me on here if you're interested.
---
I see. I'll continue collecting caps then I guess lol
---
Found out today it can happen when you equip the camera and then go into Photomode. [Here's](https://streamable.com/u4v84) a short clip of it.
---
Here! Fucking! Here!
---
My very first death playing Fallout, (Fo3) was when I walked around the corner and literally smack into not one, but TWO Deathclaws,  (Random spawn). Hit me so hard my body slow-mo exploded. My kids and I were like, "What in the fuck was that?!? AWESOME!".
---
Don't you know?? when you eat a can of something you eat the can as well
---
South of Raleigh Clay's bunker. There's a pre built home of train cars. I built on top. Love the spot.
---
I was in survival mode earlier, used a stelthboy because a team of 3 was harassing ws station. First guy I see I go into vats and he has 5hp, hit him with 2 crits to the head, did no damage was at like 90% hit chance. He killed me with one shot from probably a exploding telsa shotgun.i have a full sentiel set also. Are there hidden mechanics with exploding lasers? I know crits aren't guaranteed hit but 90% twice with 5 hp.
---
I chased a legendary mirelurk around the Ash Heap trying to kill it because it wouldn't attack me for some reason.
---
Thank you br√∂ther
---
I'm interested to hear what happened
---
Looks like a typical middle eastern person
---
I'd suggest semi-auto just because it's two shot. This handmade is kind of built for max damage, you may as well capitalize on that and maybe even get an armor penetrating magazine. 
---
If it was double or quad, I'd suggest automatic because then you could get an armor penetrating magazine (to minimize the damage gap between semi auto and auto) and still have a decent chunk of ammo. But with two shot, you will have to either reload after 10 shots or use a non-piercing magazine and suffer a rather significant damage drop with the automatic receiver
---
Cool story man üëç
---
Hey, you still need serum or did someone already hook you up?
---
Really wish there was a quest related to Grahm. Like why is he not a mindless bloodthirsty supermutant like all the rest? How did he get turned into a super mutant? Where did he find Chally? What is he actually looking for? So many ways he could be more incorporated rather than being a random encounter to trade with.
---
Trade glitch does not exist and has never existed. People can not steal anything from you. They are either A) trying to sell their spare crap for stash capacity, B) give you some "free" (1 cap) items without risking a brown bag going missing, C) seeing if you happen to have some oddly specific item they want, or D) seeing if you have anything worthy of starting PvP over

---
You really trying to use this effect? This, junkies, medic and stalkers legendaries all get dumped or sold immediately (unless ***, then it depends what it is) to reduce any RNG bias BSG has implemented based on legendary inventory.
---
I get this when I die in the Burrows. You do have a respawn point, it's just in a weird nonsensical spot. When the map loads up for the respawn it will be centered where you can respawn, but it's real easy to lose the spot if you zoom out and move the map around to orientate yourself.
---
You tore into me. Especially that comment at the end "you are ruining the game for those of us that are actually playing the game." Really, I'm ruining it? LOL. I couldn't resist roasting you over it.
---
That's a groundhog, otherwise known in West Virginia as a Whistlepig. I should know, I'm from there.
---
Mirelurk kings have always had too much health/armor to oneshot easily (unless you're a sneak/sniper build), but their 'sonic' attack that staggers you is still the same as it was before (too OP especially when there's group of them).
---
Sadly, hard lemonade isn‚Äôt one of them
---
Thats cool, but one SBQ fight can be 1k lead and 2k steel + gunpowder.
---
For a melee build, I assume you are using incisor? With 75% armor negated right off the bat, it would be pretty much impossible for it to make a difference. The better swing speed one has a dps of over 100 higher. With 753 damage per hit, and 75% armor negated, you would have to be hitting something with like 2000-3000 base armor for that difference to overshadow the dps boost. I don't think anything like that even exists in the game; afaik the tougher enemies like the scorchbeast queen have an overall damage reduction modifier, not DR
---
I got it on sale on amazon for like $10
---
T-51 is so ugly, i am glad i bought plague skin
---
Dang. I wanted to drop you instrument plans
---
I am indeed using incisor; good call! Thanks for that, it's precisely the kind of advice I was looking for, the angle I hadn't considered. Cheers!
---
The SS is always going to win out all things being equal. The DR of what you're fighting will never really be a factor in your scenario because that never changes.
---
&gt;First guy I see I go into vats and he has 5hp, hit him with 2 crits to the head, did no damage was at like 90% hit chance.
---
serendipity probably.
---
&gt;Are there hidden mechanics with exploding lasers?
---
I've heard that explosive lasers ignore damage reduction but never tested it myself. I do have a legacy tesla but built for heavies.
---
Honestly, given how similar the Chinese AR is to a modded handmade...In that they're both just AKs, i'd guess if they bring it in it'll just be a handmade skin anyway.
---
Cave critkets are real engame, they are crazy, like ants, one of strongest creatures lol.
---
I would suggest you to go melee, curently it has best damage and you dont need ammo.
---
Non-auto rifles gauss or lever action are good for solo sniping from sneak, but as you get spoted you are fked up and it is not good for bosses.
---
So automatic rifles, medium damage, eats tones of ammo, all i do whole playtime is collecting lead.....
---
Heavy wepns, any gatling is good. 5mm, laser, plasma.
---
Yknow they caused a "bug" that makes us fall through the earth if we have any mods. So there is a mod that allows you to lock items so you dont scrap or drop them. No updates on that bug at all btw, and they never said they were looking to fix it.
---
I have semi and i never have fking ammo, what is the trick?
---
Wait so it works if they're dead? Well this GREATLY simplifies this. I have been going to cranberry glades and corralling them into frame while they attack and I've done it about four times but the camera won't detect them and then once when it did THE SHUTTER QUIT WORKING. So now I'm willing to give this another try.
---
Thank goodness lol
---
wel, damage done is calculated using the ratio of damage per attack to damage reduction... so because the two damages are different, the same DR will lead to two different damage totals getting through. But as u/Papa_Shekels points out, with incisor ignoring 75% of the armor, it'd have to be crazy high before the ratio is impacted significantly. You're right though, I think that means SS clearly wins out.
---
You know what else never changes?
---
I've had mine filled with nukashine and tickblood tequila for two days and nobody's taken the chance yet. Can you see what's in the bowl before drinking? I haven't found another camp yet since this thing came about.
---
Oh just wait. Really scary shit does happen when you are low level sometimes.
---
 I was low level a long time ago and some high level player came to my camp. Just stood their looking through the window. They had one of those stupid mascot masks on. They stood there...for an hour, but I know they weren't AFK because they would move every few seconds. Scared the ever loving shit out of me to the point I was looking over my shoulder irl. Finally they went running back out the forest.
---
they don't stack additively, they proc one after the other. so 5 pieces is something like 55%. plus assassin, 70%. and dodgy, 80%. oh, lone wanderer, 85%. although these people usually hunt in packs. and that's before hitting your DR.
---
but your idea is not so bad.
---
Aye, usually if someone accepts Cap for a god roll weapon it‚Äôll be 25k or higher, usually higher. I‚Äôve seen the best of the best go for 75k sometimes.
---
When world of warcraft was thing, bored people were runing around main cities inspecting gear of othet players. Or they want to buy maps, ammo, or any othet needed item that everyone have. You have no reason to be scared. Once i didn't manage to finish daily challenge in time, because one guy who deffinetly had one bubblegum, refused to trade with me, i would give him even 1k caps for them that day. 
---
Don't be scared, people can't hurt you.
---
Literally just posted this in a different thread.
---
Honestly would be funny if they made what he was looking for a random item somewhere in the world. Something super obscure. Something a player hasn't traded to him yet. Once traded the correct item it unlocks quests related to what I was talking about. I think that would be super cool.
---
What is a "God roll" weapon
---
Dng. I lost an excavator leg yesterday and two main weapons the day before. Ate up my screws replacing the leg... Someone said spam scrapping might be the culprit. I routinely speed scrap stuff and only recently started having stuff dissapear. Hopefully BSG can figure this out. I don't want my TSE handmade to vanish...
---
Could have used smaller 1x1 designs for now. And slowly released more and even atomic shopped a few.
---
Maybe you just don't have any armor piercing perk/magazine, maybe you have useless weapon, maybe our lord and savior Mothman wants you to suffer....
---
Did you use Rad X? It negates mutations
---
There's usually a group of them south of Watoga Station (around some farm buildings), or at the Flooded Trainyard just a mile or so south-east of there. Sometimes at the NAR Repair Yard too. I used to camp near the Station before the legendary bots in Watoga disappeared.
---
They aren‚Äôt removing duped weapons. A lot of innocent people have duped weapons because they traded for them, and removing all duped weapons would fuck over a LOT of people, including people who don‚Äôt deserve to be fucked over. I never did it, but I‚Äôve bought some nice stuff off the marketplaces on reddit. If they get deleted, Bethesda will answer for it. There‚Äôll be a lot of unhappy people and it won‚Äôt fly, not at all. Thy aren‚Äôt exactly smart, but they aren‚Äôt stupid enough to wipe all the duped weapons.
---
Would be a better market than the one we have now. People already design and build for other people so yeah would be cool.
---
Even with starched genes on?
---
I got the war rider so beautiful
---
Obviously we eat the cans along with the food.
---
&gt;no one should be able to tank 40+ auto grenade launcher rounds
---
That's not ass sent that's a dense torso mod and fireproof 3. You can shoot yourself in the foot with a fatman and take no damage
---
No. It isn't. That's the game. Stop trying to make something more out of it. 
---
Or stop telling people what to do, you commie piece of shit.
---
Whenever you see a low HP bloodied guy, hit em with the gamma gun. Deep dish signal repeater.
---
lol I just try not to spam it. Go to Green County Lodge and Charleston Fire Department for collecting lead once in 1 or 2 days, West Tek Research Center for steel and gunpowder killing supermutants. Make sure to equip Scrapper perk for breaking down weapons. You'll have enough components to make a good chunk of 5.56. Also never forget to equip Ammo Smith and Super Duper when crafting ammo.
---
How do we not have a real one?
---
Oh well that explains it I didn‚Äôt know thank you
---
That sounds really abusable. I‚Äôd just get a friend to make an easy order.
---
Only diluted rad X and rad-shield don't negate mutations. Rad X doesn't remove it, just stop mutations from working for the period of time the rad X is active
---
Yes. I don't think I made myself clear... With your perk loadout and DR of the enemy always being equal... IE Same loadout, same mob then the extra DPS offered by the SS will always win.
---
Dolly Sodds. Log in, kill the bears for springs then look around and you'll find about 6 ticks. Use butcher's bounty on them. Relog. Repeat.
---
u can use diluted though and it will not affect it
---
No problem
---
Awesome gonna have to make up some more rad shield then thank you for the info
---
Lol every character I make in FO4 looks like lincoln
---
YES! It's not just me! I'm not crazy! You have no idea what a relief this is. I was going bonkers trying to figure out what I was doing wrong and why sometimes my groupings are so consistently off, like I'm landing all my shots except they all get displaced somehow.
---
Ok. Thanks.
---
I've been having it happen all too much lately. I line up a perfect headshot against a ghoul, fire... and it's not dead. Fire again, and it's still not dead. It's literally just standing still, and my shots miss.
---
I'm starting to question that whatever is borking my aim in the video I posted has been hitting me all over. I've even had point blank melee shots miss time and time again. Now I have to wonder if I somehow punched something 500ft away because the game doesn't understand aiming.
---
People use rad-x to suppress their mutations for crafting purposes.
---
Paint in the arse doesn‚Äôt sound healthy.
---
Also, Bethesda actually fixed a bug for once. Paper bags no longer disappear, they always drop and they only spawn in a few seconds after you exit your inventory instead of dumping an item one at a time like it used too.
---
Not entirely worthless..I‚Äôve found the Buzz Saw very useful for dealing with fast moving ticks, as an example! All one need do is spin around with one of those sticking out and bugs tends to drop almost instantly üòèüëç
---
I‚Äôm level 237 and I‚Äôve had people do this after a SBQ fight. I assume they wanted to buy flux that I‚Äôd gotten after the event ended, probably violet specifically. I ignore them because anything I have on me I want to keep and I don‚Äôt want anyone getting pissy about me not selling my bloodied .50 or any of the 80k rounds I have.
---
I have one a on a junk pile in the mire. Built up around it with a two tiered system and there‚Äôs a water source big enough for a large water purifier. Made an enclosed locked area for my crops and it works out pretty well. My new got to spot for base building as it‚Äôs in a pretty good location for fast traveling on the left side of the map.
---
There is also the bridge that leads to Point Pleasant. It's either ticks or some other insect spawns there. Roughly three of them
---
Only did that once... I tossed 3 mini nukes right into the birds-nest of one the other day and barely did fuck all to it.
---
Something like Antiarmour/bloodied explosive handmade or lever action with less vats cost. 
---
Bloodied deathclaw gauntlet or power fist with faster swing speed and +1 STR is a God roll melee. With a good set of perks/armour/chems/mutations you can easily get damage per swing (not counting sneak multiplier) to 3k
---
Ahahaha... I'm not on the ball tonight with my typing. And yeah, I know Beth fixed it, but I'm still suffering from PTSD with those damn paper bags.
---
There‚Äôs no solution where someone doesn‚Äôt get affected in some way or another. And given the turmoil that followed the duping age, I‚Äôm of the camp of mindset that they should.

Buying/trading for items procured by illicit means irl carries consequences regardless of whether you know it was procured that way or not, so why not here as well? If those items were meant to be super rare, but they pop up all over, that defeats the purpose of rarity. That upsets any chance at a legitimate economy, and unfairly weighs the odds in the favor of those who deal in/purchase those goods.
---
Add to that the fact they can be bought for real money, as stated elsewhere here, and it‚Äôs not good regardless of how you approach it. Not that any option can fix it, that behavior will always exist. But knowing that they will no-tolerance any violation of TOS should curb that practice.
---
And lmao at ‚Äúgetting fucked over‚Äù from having a virtual gear set removed because it was flagged as duplicated. It‚Äôs a game, not life-support. False equivalency, but still. A little extreme, that wording.
---
There needs to be something that alleviates the sheer disappointment of getting a regenerating wood left leg. If RNG isn't in your favor, there needs to at least be a consistent yet time tempered way to get what it is you want. Using crappy legendaries to get the good ones isn't a bad idea.
---
I have 12 and figured I got them from the SBQ
---
I have an awesome two story radiation maze over the river near Harper's Ferry! I love it I have a one way entry and exit out the 2nd floor that I can use in survival to escape with the Gulper slurry that makes you invisible while submerged in water, Basically. I have an awesome secret escape door. Still havent had anyone try to break in to rad to death yet though.
---
I'll give my entire inventory to anyone who creates John Wilkes Booth and kills this guy in the White Spring theatre.
---
Bloodied explosive is better. Anti-armour does not work on laser weapons currently so it is literally useless. A 1* anti-armour laser weapon does the same damage as a non legendary of the same level.
---
Later.
---
I think this is a fantastic idea. I owe Grahm a lot. I was screwing around in my base the other day, and I heard a super mutant muttering. I was getting ready to go out and kill it but then I realized it was Grahm!
---
I hightailed it to my stash and grabbed everything I wanted to sell, then sprinted like hell to catch up to him. I felt like a little kid chasing the ice cream truck, and for that feeling alone there is nothing I won‚Äôt do to make Grahm just as happy.
---
Sounds like a very...filthy...CASUAL thing to do... ;-)
---
What frazzle said. God roll just means all 3 stars being perfect for a specific build. Bloodied, swing speed, +1 strength for melee weapons is very highly sought after for example. Bloodied obviously massively increases damage, swing speed obviously massively increases dps and the +1 strength adds a bit more damage. Also some carry capacity.
---
Oh ok good so this isn't just happening to me. I thought something was wrong on my end with my install or mods.
---
If you want to see yellow snow go up to the mire and wait for this glitch to occur. lol
---
Have you also been getting some really weird artifact effects when you look around in the woods? I get where it looks like the light patches of ground smear across the dark objects. Only happens sometimes.
---
This is a sandbox and people will play how they want.  I DO WHAT I WANT!
---
That‚Äôs so strange to hear people say as I love the t51. Although a lot of my love for it is derived from nostalgia I suppose. 
---
It‚Äôs design definitely harks back to a time when these things were built using simpler polygonal geometry.
---
i think they changed radshield to where it does supress  but i could be wrong
---
I'm really hoping for more MODUS/Enclave content soon. That whole main quest is so cool, and it kinda sucks that it feels almost inconsequential that we're &gt;!Generals with the power nuclear devastation at our fingertips, and this AI controlled army of machines is up to god knows what!&lt;. SOMETHING needs to happen.
---
Usually 4 at the Gorge Junkyard, you have to kill them and some robots to claim the workshop.
---
...I am using a Vampire shotgun. And I've noticed the sun has seemed extra harsh lately....
---
They can‚Äôt remove them. They‚Äôd get fucked right up the arse if they tried because more than half the player base would be pissed. Some people would lose hundreds of hours of time investment. Removing all but one in the past was the right move, removing all of them now would be a horrible idea.
---
And please don‚Äôt be that guy that tries to tell me that the ‚Äúpixels‚Äù don‚Äôt mean anything. Losing all my weapons would mean losing all the real time I invested into getting them, which has value. It would mean that if I wanted to get them back, I‚Äôd have to invest more valuable time grinding, which isn‚Äôt enjoyable. Hence me saying ‚Äúfucked over‚Äù, which also isn‚Äôt extreme. Saying my life would be over would be extreme.
---
It is
---
I was little drunk when i was doing fasnach parade, so i wanted to talk. Some young boy started chatting with me thru voice chat. 
---
I asked him where he is from. He told he is from Germany, few minutes later he asked me if i like nazis. I was like wtf? That's not legal to like nazis.
---
So he goes: "i am German, but no nazzi."
---
It is not wildest encouter, but it was definetly most crazy for drunken me. I think i will never understand what the fk happened, lol.
---
I've got hard lemonade in my punch bowl right now
---
So was the t51 befoe the t45? I know t60 was being produced right before the bombs fell but which if its 45 51 then 60, wtf happened with the design? 45 and 60 look similar but 51 looks so different.
---
#CONGRATULATIONS!
---
I propose that we start using dog food can tabs as currency instead of bottle caps.
---
I did that. I walled off both sides and had a doorway on one. Pretty cozy, and I actually got the placement almost perfect so you couldn‚Äôt see in.
---
I have like 3 improved RK from every queen we put down. Are you sure about that count? Now i have 12 of them and i am regulary using them for eveything that broke midfight. Also i didn't do much queens because i never have ammo to farm her.
---
I was kinda hoping thats what Charleston or Whitesprings was going to be, a sort of player hub for people to build together at. Really a lack of a player hub in general, what Vault 76 should have been, is a real shame.
---
I thought about getting it but I didnt want my armor to look like gono-herpa-sypho-titis.
---
good to know man, thank you
---
i have a tse tesla already, it kicks butt but I'm looking for something else for my laser
---
+karma np
---
be laser or be tesla?
---
Commies
---
I can place those items for you also if you still need them
---
While playing FO4 i was avoiding X-01 bcos i didn't like it. T-60 is still the most beautiful PA.
---
T-51 have super ugly helmet, but best stats in fo76 so...
---
They likely have a few pieces of sentinel gear. Each piece decreases incoming damage by 15%. A full set of armour with both the sentinel and assassins effects on them will decrease incoming damage from players by 85%. Make those pieces combat armour, fully mod them and add a few DR increasing perks along with line wanderer and you‚Äôre ridiculously tanky. Spam stims every ten seconds or just have the perk that does it for you every now and then.
---
I doubt you encountered anyone with a full set of sentinel and assassins though, you wouldn‚Äôt have killed them at all.
---
It's your mods and/or custom .ini file
---
Given the current environment our gaming industries are in, yeah, they would, they abso-fucking-lutely would, if only to sell you a loot drop boost afterwards to placate the hundreds of thousands not on Reddit, who don‚Äôt voice any opinion either way, or who simply don‚Äôt care. Remember how ‚Äúcosmetic only‚Äù went? 
---
But arguing the point is moot by now; we‚Äôll never know, they‚Äôll never tell, and as it continues to happen, slowly over time, you‚Äôll be left to wonder. But I‚Äôm absolutely positive, in my own experience with Beth‚Äôs engine, this is not so simple as to be a bug. I refuse to believe otherwise, given their predisposition for stealth nerfs and shadowed gameplay changes already. Corpos could give a shit less as long as they still make baseline, which is not exactly sustained by the 10k+ users here.
---
Should add it's the Blackbird T-60 paint
---
It IS op, and I‚Äôd be willing to bet that Bethesda will be combining both the assassins and sentinel  effects into the same group so they can‚Äôt be on the same piece of armour.
---
Cloaking make you invisible after being hit (good for pvp) chameleon increase you sneak when standing crouched + u are invisible (great for sniping in pvp)
---
I use about 8 a day and they're working the same as always.
---
Oh yeah forgot about those. Happen to know a quick fix haha?
---
Cloaking will put you in stealth for a few seconds when you take a hit.... Chameleon will put you in stealth when you crouch and stand still. Chameleon is better in most situations.
---
cloaking only makes you invisible when something/someone hits you, and it doesnt last if you move at all, chameleon makes you invisible when you crouch and it lasts until you stand up or start walking
---
oh ok good to know
---
Emergency Protocols Everytime.
---
Funny thing is I‚Äôm running a shotgunner build with all shotgun perks and max strength.
---
Others cannot see what's in it, only, "Drink."
---
I'm a Bloodied build and actually prefer reactivate plates. That's just me though... If I had to choose of those the two you asked about I'd go with Emergency Protocols.
---
Both? I tend to carry two sets myself, its actually 3 at the moment (added t-60 to the mix, cheap as chips to repair). 
---
I've also heard of just carrying the Torso and hot-swapping. With perks can drag the torso weight within reason. 
---
I love the Jetpack myself. Just even jumping off a cliff and seeing how far you can get (stealth = high agility, my main can almost reach whitesprings from my house on the cliff with the right tapping). Combine it with Marsupial for the extra boost as well.
---
Even just with Troubleshooters armor (without Sentinel) taking 75% off their damage, that's easily enough. A sneak kill (with all 3 'Sneak' perk cards) and the Escape Artist perk that will let you back away into 'Caution' mode from 'Danger' if you don't get too close, that's the easiest way I've found to deal with them.
---
Lmao +1
---
Believe it or not, my character is Adolf Hitler lol
---
Weird
---
The jet pack is fun, but it sucks the life out of your fusion cores. They‚Äôre easy to replace obviously, but still. The jet pack is more of a toy, if you have marsupial it‚Äôs not necessary.
---
Emergency Protocols are awesome for a bloodied build. You should be at 19% health or lower for nerd rage to kick in, and it‚Äôll cause the effects of EP as well.
---
It might be because of how unintuitive it is to change it
---
Faster attack speed weapons and being very very sneaky is the route you want. You can't one punch someone but if you can shank them fast enough it's pretty similar.
---
Other than restoring to defaults I do not.
---
My character is Hitler lol when I get home from vacation I will post it
---
üëèüëèüëèüëè
---
Yeah. I noticed a regular supersledge was screwing me.  Especially with the terrible hit registration of melee and unarmed in vats
---
Lol i got a god roll rolling pin the other day, it was level 45 and did about 400 dmg with my current build (level 27ish)
---
Ah man i wishhhh it could do the full thing. Im only in excavator for the looks atm hahaha
---
Awesome - love all the little details and the narrative (lol  Fredrick)
---
I've got a bloodied combat knife that does God's work, but playing around with the idea that maybe the bloody might not be necessary and just need the fastest attack possible. The weapon for this week's event is a faster swing speed switch blade might be worth looking into. You also only need the 3 1 point 1-h perk cardd to get your damage, with incisor and the faster sweep cards maxed.
---
I like it. Too bad about your...neighbor.
---
I've had that happen without moving my camp. Built near whitesprings, then one session I built a foundation a bit closer to resort and next serverhop my camp couldn't be placed
---
SORRY :P
---
Level 202, I have a vampires gatling laser, every perk related damage reduction card and can facetank the entire cranberry bog including the queen. that being said those damn bears slap me silly.
---
I had a bunch of lvl 1 eye bots spawn at the white springs golf course once instead of ghouls. Same situation, I didn‚Äôt even know there were level 1 legendaries
---
winter is coming!!!!!
---
I'm tempted to run full hp because bloodied is useless. U cant even 1 hit with black powder guns anymore. Pvp is 1 step away from nothing but vats crit handmade guns and lasers.
---
üëçvery cool!
---
Or maybe it is a punishment from God for abusing his name everytime you had a three star drop.
---
A level 40 hunting rifle does 65 base damage, rising to 78 with one three-point rifleman perk. No hardened receiver? You should also have at least one point in expert rifleman by then.
---
I've never used the jetpack. Could it help me scale a mountain, and how does it work when overencumbered?
---
The only time I actually see myself using the armor for defensive purposes is when I can't sneak, like during events, namely the imposter sheepsquatch one. That would still be pretty useful though I suppose.
---
Atoms, 30 or 40.
---
That is why I always use a lower case "g" ;)
---
Hah, he thinks u ded. Tin can mans, weako. We raiderz gona rul to the appalachia!

Amen brother.
---
I used to run with a guy who made Teddy Roosevelt and wanted to get a rough riders faction going. As soon as I heard that, I made my guy look like DMX
---
Bethesda pls let us fill punch bowls with toxic goo.
---
Ive literally spent hours trying sell them to low lvl players, who were at least in their 20's, I spent caps traveling to meet them, so far it's not been not worth the effort
---
After an update, the Fallout76.ini in your game folder updates with new archive lists.  Since you are overwriting the updated archive list with your Fallout76Custom.ini , you have to manually update your custom.ini to reflect the changes to the default .ini in your game folder.  It's just a copy/paste and take 2 minutes to fix.  I would much rather Bethesda continue with this 'hands off' approach than to get involved and start policing the community.  They need to fix the base game, we can fix our mods.
---
I am going to pick up everything from now on. Not taking a chance. Thanks for the help!!!
---
Does that apply to plasma rifles as well?
---
I have gotten 11 from SBQ.
---
I have noticed that it‚Äôs also a sync issue with where your console thinks your character is vs where the server thinks your character is. In 76 your console relays your position to the server and the server responds when you do an action such as hit a target in melee or the like, so when your out of sync and actually the server thinks you are 50 ft away and you swing your weapon the damage is applied all the way over there, not where you can see your self on the console. This appears to carry over to aiming as well. If you aim at the head the server actually thinks you are aiming about where you where 3 seconds ago which isn‚Äôt even on the target so the shot flies off into the distance. 76 has a bad time with this on all platforms but it is also effected by connection speed and packet loss to the server.
---
So toss cloaking armor?
---
(PC) Sitting on max caps with several toons, and cant buy any end game pieces with caps. Caps as a fiat is broken.
---
That's why you have to trade, unfortunately. I don't see that as broken, though.
---
I love this. Just jumped back in the game after a couple month break and am trying to decide what kind of camp to build, this is seriously inspiring man
---
Hahahaha
---
+karma
---
We can help him find the milk of human kindness.
---
I'll start: (Short of putting workshops on their own private server world) perhaps maybe treat workshops like the rentals they are (?) Adjust the price for claiming workshops slightly higher and replace the default PvP mechanic with a "buy out" system &amp; timer in Adventure Mode. 
---
Owners are immune to buy outs for 1 hour after claiming the workshop then the price for the workshop is set at a premium between 300 to 800 caps for the next hour (pricing based on the level of the player buying out the lease - higher for higher levels). After the 2 hour period, the price of the workshop drops down to it's lowest price. The caps for the buy out do \*not\* go to the owner. Workshops are limited to x2 per player to prevent griefing the system. 
---
Add to this process an option for the original owner to enable PvP when claiming the workshop at a discount off the price of the claim (Say -100 caps for the risk). 
---
This way, when players look to contest a workshop, they can either choose to buy out the land either at a premium if "they need it now" or much cheaper if they're willing to wait or - for the competitor - fully engage into PvP with a consenting owner for the workshop. Most AM'ers will buy out the lease at the cheapest and/or jump servers to an unclaimed shop. The PvP'ers looking to compete can target PvP-enabled workshops. 
---
PvP griefing teams looking to buy all the workshops on a given world (whether they're claimed or unclaimed) are put into check by spending caps and getting bought out by AM'ers. Legitimate PvP'ers know that any engagements for a workshop are above board and not versus some fresh 76er trying to fix their broken pipe pistol. 
---
Sound, decent or flawed? Thoughts? Additions?
---
Lol. I do the same but on the front door.
---
Abrohamlincoln
---
Same here. I hit 40 tonight and will be 50 this weekend for sure so its something i hope they implement well.
---
There is someone on here that says they like to do things like that just to mess with people.
---
it sucks he stops talking to you after the quest is done.
---
I can understand that, Billy Maddison showed me the humor in it. But on my bed lol
---
It is a looter shooter though. Ever since fallout 4, the gameplay design is a lot closer to the spirit of stalker than any of the others. To be honest, that's why I've put so much more time into them (and why the lack of NPCs never bothered me now that I think of it).
---
Luckily there are a bunch of titles coming out that have that old school fallout spirit like wasteland 2 and pillars of eternity so everyone wins
---
Well regardless of in game timeline now, the t51 was introduced in Fallout 1 back in 1997. Hence the somewhat outdated design cues. I think they kept that armor the way it is to please us oldies.
---
As you say, with something like a Bloodied Power Fist, Unyielding Armor, and Adrenal Reaction mutation, if you just spam at a group of them a couple of times, that will kill them no problem. Fist/Melee builds are so OP against melee enemies. But against 5 Colonel Gutsy's, shooting those armor shredding bullets at you, it's much harder.
---
I agree. Just found a lead spot with dirty water source and secluded. Its on a waterfall  and in the trees and i am dressed like a owl man. Whooo ever so finds my domain is welcome. We bird people live a simple life, hunting our ancient enemy, the sheelsquach.
---
Why does that not surprise me lol.
---
Is chally rocking some sort of ghost launcher on her back? Because that would be rad.
---
You can always ask someone to ream up or just to help. There's alot of people playing this game who have no problem helping someone out. An added plus to that is if you tag the higher level enemy, you get that xp.
---
You can put in on more than one armor.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve tried doing that. Everyone denies my requests so far or is off doing an event
---
Just keep trying...you'll find quite a few out there. Sometimes it helps if you message them your intentions.
---
I say if not dumping PvP from workshops altogether in AM then replace it with something more appropriate like a "buy out" system with caps in Adventure Mode. Workshops are essentially rentals and thus should be treated as so by charging fees/caps as the way to "contest" ownership. 
---
Adventure Mode'rs with no interest in PvP should be able to claim a workshop using a "buy out" option in place of PvP to protect themselves from griefers. PvP'ers should have the option to enable PvP when claiming a workshop and receive a discount off the cost for taking the risk. This way, any PvP engagements for a workshop are all above board. 
---
I go into more detail in a discussion thread I just opened on the topic if any of you have ideas and alternatives to PvP when contesting workshops. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bjrew8/what\_are\_some\_solutions\_to\_replace\_pvp\_when/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bjrew8/what_are_some_solutions_to_replace_pvp_when/)
---
The griefing is real. Let's kill it.
---
send them a text first, I dont accept random team invites due to the fact that a few times they just wanted to see where my camp was to start PvP.
---
I literally suggested this a couple days ago...
---
What do you play on?
---
I assume bloodied would increase it the best, and others that would increase it against players should be two shot, beserkers, assassins, others that I can‚Äôt think of. You get mods from scrapping it.
---
Ps4
---
I gave up on treasure maps early on and have a stash of them. Just didn't bother using them. Maybe it's time to go digging at level 170.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
What is it that separates the intelligent super mutants from the mindless? They all seem to be fixated by something don‚Äôt they. 
---
All super mutants are driven by an urge, for most it‚Äôs to dunk things into fev and reproduce. But for some... 
---
I was going to start listing the relevant super mutant characters here, but I‚Äôve just realised I‚Äôve opened a massive can of worms!
---
Not sure if they got reduced or anything but the normal Mirelurk queen is a pushover compared to the legendary one.   Shes really a beast.   I found her way south in the cranberry bog near the excavation mining site.  Forgot what its called.
---
I didn‚Äôt even realize you can send text. Is that just on pc?
---
Love C&amp;H! I've still only seen Mothman twice in nearly 300 hours of play, and both times were just after launch when I was too low a level to even scratch him. He's the last cryptid on my list
---
Politically inclined huh?
---
Normal Mirelurk queens are fine.  But the legendary ones are like sub-bosses.
---
Rose's quests/ Top of the World is kind of a difficulty threshold in the game.  Level 15-45 is the toughest part of the game.   Even if you get frustrated, enjoy it and don't rush the story like I did.
---
*chases enemy down, shoots them in the head, tosses a cap* you forgot your change
---
Join a fallout discord and ask around. Also, you CANNOT just go through the main questline in one go. The level jump near the end nessatate 50+ solo (ymmv). Relax, level and gear up. If you rush the game you're going to be very unhappy later on.
---
The level scaling is really bad. You are supposed to be around level 15 when you reach The Top of the world and there are either level 50 or higher Super Mutants, Scorched or Mole Miners. I Was greeted with an Albino Rad Scorpion at around level 60. I was lucky because some random guy asked me to join him but even he with his level 40 Power Armor was struggling. The Main Quest constantly forces you to go to areas that you couldn't possibly beat with your level, even if you allways walked your way there and killed everything in sight.
---
Just level up with side quests. When you have a Power Armor and you are around level 30-40 just go to Whitesprings like everyone else. I myself only recently finished the main Quest after one Month of doing anything else to gain about 30 levels.
---
Hiw do you lock doors? Never figured that out
---
Suppressors combat knife with swing speed.  Stab stab stab as fast as you can and nerf the enemy.
---
If I remember right, while in workshop mode, press LT on the door And it will prompt you with a lvl0-3 lock to choose. I'm on Xbox, not sure for PS.
---
Sometimes tho instead of telling you to go around, it would tell you to go through the damn building lol
---
Phrasing lol
---
Agreed, why rush it? Have you done all the events west of Rose (savage divide) at least once?
---
Also plenty side quests available as well. Some of which give you the much needed xp to level up, and sometimes weapons or gear you can only obtain from quest.
---
That smile. That damned smile ... this is where it all started ... with MODUS and the reign of the Enclave \]:) ... and of course a second nuclear winter for every red chinese communist
---
I'll be on in 2 hours. GT: TwEaK354
---
Ya. I busted ass and ran into a wall atb25 or so. I didnt do a single quest until I was like 65 and knocked them out. Hell, I'm 132 and bout to start the excavation stuff. Get your ass on that discord my man. Best thing I've ever done.
---
Creative silliness with no damage done. Also great scene setting üëå
---
I'm there to. I was on top of the structure but it was a pain to get there.
---
Speaking as someone in this situation myself (I am level 36 and keep finding level 50 enemies) my usual strat is to try and avoid them. I have taken to just exploring, don't feel bad if you spend a little longer in the forest than you feel you should, just take your time.
---
Bethesda wesda? Can you pwease fix these pwoblems that have been in the game for faw too long? Thank yeeeeww ^_^
---
I‚Äôve had that before, hard resetting Xbox works well for this ( I don‚Äôt keep my Xbox in power saving mode so basically I never need to reset) I‚Äôve also went through 2 days of game freezing when I try to enter buildings with super sledge equipped.
---
I also uninstall the game AT LEAST once every other month or so and fresh installs solve random issues. 
---
(Xbox one S).
---
I would also love to see some better looking paints than the pink or rainbow one.
---
I bought the pink one accidentally and its just ugly in my opinion, some rusty metal, black or even some sort of urban camo would look pretty cool
---
I agree with you that the current system on Adventure Mode is deeply flawed. I think it could be fixed relatively easily, by tweaking a few mechanics. 
---
1. Workshops would still be contestable by PvP, however, that should be limited to the workshop zone. No more exploiting the system.
---
2. When another player claims, there should be a 1 minute timer, clearly stating when PvP begins. If the owner doesn‚Äôt want to fight, they can simply leave the zone or not return to fight for it (if elsewhere on the map). Once a PvP battle begins, either party can give up their claim by simply leaving the zone or being killed. 
---
3. No revenge option should be available after being killed, and players can‚Äôt claim the same workshop more than once per hour. Death results in losing your claim. This eliminates the whole farming players for caps nonsense. 
---
3. Workshops should be more productive, making them more valuable pieces of real estate than they currently are‚Äîmaking them actually worth fighting for. They should also have more resources to build with, further enhancing their value. 
---
4. Cap rewards for player kills should follow the 25% of level reward from Survival. It shouldn‚Äôt be more profitable to kill players in Adventure than in the actual PvP server.
---
Maybe a tiered token system where you can cash in 1,2,3 star Legendaries for bronze, silver, and gold tokens. Platinum tokens would cost caps or something? I don't know lol.
---
I usually can 1 shot them with an instigating power attack super sledge as long as I get the first  hit. I only do it if I'm solo or with just teammates. If not I just sit there for a while and let me Tesla hit everything so lower levels can smack everything around.
---
That's a good point. A good half the stuff in the Shop has been there since launch.
---
How do you get the punch bowl?
---
Well there is a locked President room or something like that on the top of the communicationroom in the back.   
---
There will be new content, but we just dont know what it is. There are also some blocked tunnels that seperate some existing areas, implying that there will be something inbetween sometime
---
Would love to see this
---
Are there? I know 96, 63 &amp; 94.
---
So don‚Äôt wear an outfit all the time? I change my look every week or so, put the unyielding armor on the shelf and go for a new look.
---
I've not had any problems killing sent users.
---
Thank you my good man. Good to know.
---
Energy in general. Pretty sure Tesla only does energy damage in which case, AA is useless on it until it‚Äôs fixed.
---
I definitely had a laugh, all in good fun. And thanks :)
---
It applies to the energy damage that it does, but not the ballistic. Plasmas do both so it‚Äôs kinda helpful, but doesn‚Äôt get the most out of it like with ballistic only weapons. Don‚Äôt let it stop you from getting yourself an AA plasma or laser if hats what you want though, surely Bethesda will fix it at some point.
---
From what i have read, the world is essentially a wasteland as much as America is, some places way worse. China would be as bad or worse than America.
---
If you‚Äôre going for rifles you want to at least take the first rank of each rifleman perk‚Äîrifleman, expert and master. That‚Äôs a 10% boost for each. Maxing out one card, as you‚Äôve done, only gives a 20% boost. 
---
In this game, as opposed to other Fallouts, picking your build matters. If you want to output heavy damage, you‚Äôve gotta pick one thing and max it. If you want to play with all the toys (and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that) you can be more balanced, but you won‚Äôt get the big damage numbers.
---
There's perk to help dodge shots and he could have very high dmg resist with sentinal armor, are you running perks to boost your rifle dmg?
---
I‚Äôm not sure where everyone‚Äôs going for wood, but the toxic valley has literally hundreds of broken trees everywhere. I hit 250 in less than two hours.
---
Uh, turn on passive?  Don't know what mode you're playing or why, so its vague.
---
Everytime I'm building, I think of the square foundation in the circle build zones and think like a Mr. Popo after dropping a literal gallon of LSD. "All these squares make a circle. All these squares make a circle." But yeah. We definitely need our build zones to not look like Kami's Lookout.
---
Had that happen to me the other day.  Ironically, four BoS roleplayers stopped by for a visit, amiable guys.  And then the dick Enclave roleplayer came by, left and when I went off to quest, he came back and took it.  I tried sneaking back, but he spotted me and one shot my ass.  Eh, I just let it go.
---
Although, I have seen videos where people completely enclose the workshop with either cement barriers or wooden shelves such that they cannot be reached without destroying them, thus opening them up to turret fire.
---
It could help you scale a mountain and get to places that marsupial can‚Äôt quite reach, but it drains ap quickly so you can‚Äôt just go on until you run out of fusion cores. Stuff like canned coffee doesn‚Äôt outspeed the drain either, but I‚Äôm not sure if it gives a bit more time.
---
It does work when overencumbered but I‚Äôm not sure if it drains more ap. I don‚Äôt think it does.
---
If you rarely ever get hit, you might as well go for the jet pack. In events you can always hide at a distance. In pvp though, you‚Äôd struggle. You‚Äôd likely die easily even with emergency protocols really but every bit counts.
---
I don't think you were missing. I just think maybe they had a ridiculous build. What platform are you on? What LVL are you? Weapons/build?
---
With a full sentinel assassin set, you can make yourself pretty much invulnerable to range except stagger, Anti-armor or crit headshots.
---
But they did seem to be floating, although the game glitches out to allow these sort of things and he was jumping around, but it seems you only shot at him will he was standing still
---
Yeah. Best story Ive read on this sub for ages.
---
I wish I had my strip joint that I had in FO4. I had a full bar, pool table, disco lights and hookers.
---
They need a "Are you sure you want to drop these item(s)" option to to confirm.
---
I've been snatching, cooking and selling his eggs nearly since launch and STILL haven't seen him.
---
Just use VATS till the critical bar is fully loaded, drink hoppyhunter and then VATS crit hit
---
As someone who has done that quest on similar level (~20), couple of tips
---
- find power armour (you can use raider pa from level 15)
---
- melee weapons will probably be more useful than guns (but may depend if your build is specifically suited to rifle/auto/guns)
---
- if high level player has triggered higher level enemies, server hop
---
I managed to finish all of Rose‚Äôs quests, and most of Free States &amp; BoS ones by level 26. I did have to avoid fights as much as possible, and also used sniper rifle a lot wherever I could.
---
And then bam. Last expansion for this year ends with us getting new NPCs but those NPCs kill Grahm and Chally out of fear. With us left to mourn for Grahm and slaughter those NPCs we prayed so long for.
---
Where is the plan? Where is the plan???!!
---
I imagine they might have something like that for the vending machines, like an advertisement beacon so players will come by.
---
 
---
&gt; So what can be done? Well, they can nerf it. But that sucks. 
---
They could leave legendary effects for the armor as is, but change the way legendary weapons effect it. For example, they can make anti- armor legendary effect to where it ingores not just 50 percent or armor, but 50 percent of benefits from legendary effects.  Sentinel assassins full set provides 100 percent damage resistance,   but only 50 percent when hit by anti armor.  
---
Or they could increase the stagger chance provided by perks.  Staggering makes these armors vulnerable, so increase the chances of staggering.
---
How to tell if my critical bar is fully loaded &amp; how to do Vats critical hit? Sorry I mainly a melee built with terrible vats knowledge :[
---
Vault 76 - Americas best and brightest
---
Thank you for your protection my child. It is appreciated. Your kindness will not go unrewarded. May the RNG be in your favour.
---
Yes, can confirm this.  
---
(Took me ages to realise you had to hit the triangle button on the PS controller to actually make the critical hit)
---
Sorry man can't help you
---
The one where you follow the overseers audio logs was actually pretty nice. You see her slowly realise what vault tech has done and how the wastes had changed her as a person.
---
There's an animation cancelling glitch that let's you power attack then normal attack almost instantly. If someone doesn't die from a power and normal hit back to back like that than something is wrong. In my experience no one makes it past a power attack but there seems to be a lower cap for normal attacks and it leaves the player at about a third hp
---
If I remember correctly you can load the game, you can either choose not to move your camp and when you log out it will be in its same place, or move it for free.
---
Actually, yeah. An advertisement beacon of sorts, like just an item that is placed that makes you visible would work wonders. Also can't wait for those vending machines. Going to put one in my bar upstairs of my Mire Swamp Camp.
---
how do you have no arms?
---
It can't be scrapping because we can't scrap legendary items, maybe it's a visual bug, if your stash hasn't lost any weight after you think it dissapers it might still be their.
---
Dude love this pic
---
I‚Äôd like to see an option for closest workbench, so when I‚Äôm over encumbered I know which way to stumble to scrap some stuff.
---
This, please. Also a SLIGHT reduction to their budget amounts.
---
I got it!!! Thank you thank you :DD
---
heyyyy never knew i would have a reddit post about me. 1st off i froze because i have poopoo internet. sorry bout that :D. i do run assasin sent and seredipity and a bunch of other junk. if your interested im happy to shore some tips.
---
Most of the time though high level players are trying to Max their cap earnings. Example if I grind white springs I usually sell all the junk legendaries and Max out vendor caps but everynow and then I'll end up with some good stuff just under leveled so not useful to me, so I'll find some one who could use it and try to sell it.
---
That'd be cool too. Though with all the stations and red rockets? You can almost always be near a bench and stash.
---
The yellow bar in vats is full, you get a short ringing bloop sound, and the previously faded button to use crit is in full yellow colour now.
---
Someone was going to sell me a bloodied one but they said the rad damage doesn't increase at low hp so I backed out. Still a good gun against low hp players like myself. Bloodied is still best because it increases physical damage the most
---
Just reminder for devs that survival is uplayable shit atm. We desperatly need weapon/armor balance update
---
While in VATS you see a bar in the upper side of your screen - thats the crit bar (looks quiet the same as TP or AP bar)
---
If it is fully loaded you see which command to use for crit depending of system (PC, PS, XBox) hold the button and shoot.
---
Would suggest relocating, you must be in a popular spot. I blame the YouTubers
---
Yeah that would be a bad idea. Like hey come sit in my chair now let me walk away and flip this switch.
---
It‚Äôs kinda lame that you can‚Äôt take damage from it :(
---
Been playing since beta and the love of grinding and just general camp building keeps me in the game. They have patched out most of the duplication methods and banned a lot of those people which is nice. It's not nearly as common as it was before. As for a few notes:
---
2 shot explosive is still wicked powerful but not nearly as much as it was. 
---
The PvP mode is only worth entering if you have god tier legendary gear and a perfect perk setup. (Think unyielding assassin or assassin sentinel on all pieces) on a side note, finding gear of those kind will yield you a lot of caps from selling to another player
---
The new waistlines are great!  They're aren't super long but still provide a decent amount of hours of fun. 
---
DO NOT attempt to take on imposter sheepsquach solo. You will die. A lot. And likely will not scratch it. Either the whole server takes it on or you lose generally. 
---
Welcome back!
---
Modify in workshop mode, not build mode.
---
Your post just made my day lmao üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Unarmed? Sure does.
---
The enclave. They have a cool bunker, vendors and the quests feel like you're an undercover agent. They also give you cool outfits and things like the orbital strike beacon.
---
Thanks for the advice
---
Passive mode changes the game to haha no grief me. Can't wait till haha you can destroy my base. Mmmm safe
---
The key to put a lock on your door is F on pc. :)
---
I get that but OP is right. Every new PA skin doesn't need to be limited time.
---
I haven't tried spirits, I've just tried putting in my collection of beers in but it wouldn't let me so I assumed you had to brew drinks, nice to know i can put something i can find in the world in there.
---
Had a friend drink out my bowl and he said he only had the option to "Drink" without being able to see what it was.
---
I really loved the Mistress of Mystery questline! The story is really great and full of betrayal and all that jazz.
---
Most of my workshop experiences recently have gone exactly like this, I honestly don‚Äôt touch workshops anymore because of this. One of the few things that keeps me playing this game was pretty much stripped away from me. You‚Äôd think with all the pvp incentive the knuckle dragging bastards would stay in that cesspit of survival mode, but they‚Äôre probably tired of being beat, so they go for easier prey for the distraction from
---
Their sad lives. 
---
Chin up good sir, we aren‚Äôt all bastards.
---
When I‚Äôm in a place I haven‚Äôt explored yet, they‚Äôre not on the map. I‚Äôve found there aren‚Äôt many train stations in the south east area, just old elevated rails.
---
This is exactly what iam looking for especially for the playervendingmachine . You dont allways want to build on the same spot an there are many different spots to do this. Only doing this on one place would somehow counter the idea of the campt that could easily be placeble on potentially any ground for a quick patch-up for the whole team and a cheap quicktravelpoint. But this way it would be hard to vend something without some kind of beacon simmilar to the siren but it may even work as a (payed) quicktravelpoint for anyone (if it is chosen in the options) when you are allways move your camp, so they can quickly get there or even get there when the camp is on a location that is hard to reach.
---
I drank hard lemonade out of a friend's punch bowl
---
Didnt see anyone mention it yet, blocker 3 is amazing. Radicool is handy. Revenant perk is totally bonkers if you have a team mate to revive you. Definitely definitely get speed demon, twisted muscles and talons mutations. Speed will get you to the enemy faster and the other two increase damage. 
---
Optimal build for damage is of course low hp. I run the low hp survivability perks like serendipity 3 and actually dont use slugger or iron fist (due to needing carry weight perks) Without iron fist perk or chems or booze my power fist does over 1k because my low hp build. If you dont want to die all the time like my dumb ass than I would recommend a normal hp build
---
If your spot is quite popular it might cause you less headache to move it. 
---
Otherwise, you can just get a workshop or something of the sort for your playtime to be sure you have workbenches and such.
---
So long as you don't place your camp again it will still be where it was originally on your next login. (:
---
I like that they have repeat quests with decent loot. Unlike BoS, which was a big disappointment in the quest line, but I did enjoy recognising the names of BoS members.
---
Mmm, first death of the game was last weekend, when I found out the hard way that you're not only pvp-flagged while taking the workshop. RiP character, RiP workshops. 
---
That am I flagged because someone contests my workshop whether I oppose or not is just baffling to me.
---
Had thought it was (and feel it should be): I take workshop and is flagged while taking. Player attempts to take workshop from me and is flagged while taking. I am flagged if I attack that player.
---
I'm sorry, without going into details all your suggestions are just bad. And will never happen.
---
A puny switchblade for junkies with some extra  dumb effects, you one things you gotta do is collect wood 250 times.
---
Ain't worth enough to waste my time on.
---
PS is L2, so it's essentially the same thing as Xbox
---
Yeah me too. I just started the brotherhood quests yesterday but i realise a lot of things.
---
Ritual bindings with civil war top hat and a skull bandana, it‚Äôs my wasteland witch doctor look lol
---
Think he‚Äôs been there since launch he just wanders a lot haha
---
He's been around since the beginning I think he pops up rarely but always has good stuff hes a vendor. Cant remember his name but you often read on here people letting others know where he is when they see him.
---
No idea, but now I'm curious! Thanks a lot, now i won't be able to sleep tonight, just wondering all night lol
---
Go away.
---
You're new?
---
Na I've been playing for months never seem him before I'm level 120 üòÇ
---
 [https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/)   
---
That is a map for many resources and includes power armor spawn locations roughly on it. The quality of the core depends on the player who renders it in first's luck skill. If your luck is terrible like mine farming cores from power armor might not be the way to go. Line in the Sand usually gives 2x 100% cores per completion and is up very often. Non-Whitesprings Sentry Bots like the one found at 98 Nar Regional north of WS usually drop 2 cores as well though not sure if they are guaranteed 100%. Robobrains at Dyer Chemical also have a decent chance for dropping them. I would not recommend making them as they are not worth the hassle for flux.
---
wow you don't get out much do you
---
I personally like getting into locked buildings without lock picking and turning all their lights on/off etc, and occasionally sleeping in their bed waiting for them to come back. I have only been able to get into a couple that were locked though.
---
Nice! Here's my generic raider outfit, ppl tend to not look at me lol
---
Raider crossing https://imgur.com/gallery/ujNYnYO
---
Man, I hope they do change it, because I would love to run across something like this.
---
Well, shit.. Lol. He's been around since beta. He's definitely rare though, but "super" rare for you, I suppose ü§£
---
No problem. The animation cancelling is easy with a little practice. You have to sprint, attack(normal button but because sprint it's a power attack anyways) then quickly crouch and use a normal attack. Takes a bit to get the timing down. There's another step after that for yet another quick power attack but I'll let YouTube explain that bit. Really fun when you get all 3 hits in on a scorch beast with perfect timing
---
you could go to the enclave bunker in to the science-wing. On the tradingterminal MODUS will give you the option to either buy serums or even better: Give you the opportunity to even buy the recipes for these serums. They are legitly expensive (i think 24000 caps ore something around that) nearly at the caplimit(25000 caps) but with some perks and some alcohol you can push it down to a price of unter 19000 caps
---
What‚Äôs the best questing for getting XP? 
---
I did the one at the forte with the sonic thing and fought a tonne of scorchEd and two SB I thought that was pretty good 
---
Then I did the monster mash by myself and got to kill like 100 ghouls, get tonnes of meds and even a few legendaries
---
Glad I could bring you enjoyment, it made mine too.
---
Yeah I've had the worse luck playing this game I didn't see mothman for so long then he just randomly jumps me at a nuke zone at the golf course at level 112 üòÇ
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
My favorite is to use the porta-john. Go sit down, close the door and go afk for 10 mins.
---
The trade glitch never existed. 
---
I usually trade with high levels to size em up and see if I can have a fun pvp fight or if one of us totally out ranks the other person with gear quality OR to see what they were using after I've pvped with them
---
I trade with people around 50 to 70 to see what gear they have. If I seem their gear horrible enough then I usually give em a high damage weapon out of my stash
---
Radaway and Rad-X lasts about 15 min. After that your mutation should kick in.
---
I guess it will be available until the next bigger atomshop update or so, but i'm pretty sure it will stay for at least a week. So you should be able to grab it. Otherwise feel free to come to my camp to grab a refreshing drink üòã
---
Maybe right beside white springs isn‚Äôt a good spot.......
---
Someone sold it to the vendor probably by accident. I've seen that armour go for 5 to 15k before as it's basically best in slot everything for a normal health sneak based guy. You can mod it with ultra light and that'll make it even better at sneak since armour weight effects your detection range while moving. Good find!
---
Lots of great suggestions here, [tshk80](https://www.reddit.com/user/tshk80) and quoted from the truth! #5 is totally baffling to me and seems like a technical oversight on Beth's part. I say losing the workshop and your junk is all that is needed. Remove the cap penalty all together!
---
Good tip, have 125 left to go, will pop up there

I can't wait to get it today after all this work. I want to set up my place even more and be ready. Then once I setup shop, I will check out other players CAMPs.
---
Go to Phillipi Cemetery and wear the Confederate uniform
---
I'd never want to live anywhere else. The ambient sounds, the music, the lighting.
---
My main has her house near Harpers Ferry and I was terrified that the update containing The Burrows would conflict with her spot, but thankfully it didn't.
---
As for enemies, the worst I ever get are the occasional three to four man gangs of cave crickets that roll in looking to take over the house, and sometimes come damn close to doing so if I'm not prepared. Apart from that, it's an extremely calming place to be. Quiet and serene, feels like you can breathe and relax.
---
Wow.. Did you eat 10 nerd rage cards? Are you a millennial by any chance? First world problems much?
---
You were lucky. Half the players I meet are dillholes. It's been said many times but I'll say it again, we need a no PVP mode.
---
No worries a buddy of mine has them all! I just never bothered to buy them üò¨ I appreciate you tryna look out though ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Full Charge, it's a gift from the gods
---
However, possible FC drain bug(s), If you're sprinting and swing before you stop sprinting, thats a Power Attack and thus FC drain.
---
Possible conflict with Marathoner as well, (I know it doesn't work in PA) but there might be an issue that it conflicts with Full Charge, deactivating Full Charge when both are equiped - Needs more testing though.
---
I felt like I was taking damage easier today but it might just have been no food buffs
---
I'd of given it back too, just because these items are digital doesn't mean they don't have real value. You can't just rob someone like that
---
The chinese remnants appeared in fallout 3 through their operations at mama dolces as ghouls. In fallout 4 there was a chinese sub. The mama dolces in 76 is deserted of surviving remnants, and was discovered prewar if you read the terminals in sugar grove. 
---
This still leaves room for surviving members to be introduced if: they are holed up somewhere, migrating, intercepted brotherhood of steel signals, investigating the scorch, or returning from outposts to their headquarters at mama dolces.
---
Okay, what is the speed value then?
---
name a very light weapon **a buffer 
---
I do this with my clothes because they all are named with * in front of them to bring them to the top of the list adding a buffer will help any item you don't want to drop not be the top of the list you could also put a z in front of the name if you want it to be on the bottom
---
Apparently some of the Eggheads became rotten. Not this vault dweller. I turned into Wine and got better over time.
---
I feel you! Mods made that game AMAZING, According to Todd, there will be private servers, and mods activated in said private servers, most likely not for a long while, BUT, it‚Äôs something awesome to look forward to, Bethesda knows modding is what keeps their community thriving for years to come and loves it!
---
Yep, i am on PC too. Ign: strangar88

Word of warning guys, don't be dumb like me and go to the first mirelurk queen and lure the king there, it was much harder :)
---
Oddly felt the same, way up on stim pack use and got my ass handed back to me by a mud level mr gutsy.
---
He was probably going to put the mic right up to his butt and let 'er rip.
---
Surely a nerf in which almost 50% damage is removed from your gun would have to be announced!!
---
Your obviously in one of the more popular spot so the only real solution is to move camp.
---
As bad as not marking known plans and recipes that took them forever to fix. It becomes more and more apparent every day that not only was the game not even close to being ready for release, the developers didn't even put in any real playtime.
---
Yeah...   Not saying it was on purpose, but they chamge part of the code and blow holes in other parts inadvertently.
---
No sir stop you cant drink the whole punchbowl
---
me:Gurgling noises as I down all the booze
---
I get patches of darkness in the Mire since November if that counts :D And instant changes from late night to early morning lighting.
---
Sounds like a plan. Hope to see you soon. Btw my camp has been updated recently with new sections added and in construction. 
---
We seriously need new stuff CAMPs. Now minor items but a big package of new items for remodeling. Like a major patch. Not the atomic shop unless it's an item that makes sense to spend atomic points for.
---
Yeah I get that, hopefully someone else with a gauss will leave a comment. See if they have same issue.
---
*Perfectly balanced, as all things should be*

Ah, classic "Is this guy AFK? Quick, try to get their attention or fuck with them."

I'd rather **disable any kind of fast travel**.

Depends. Are you trying to turn it off? Or are you trying to turn it on? Relevance is relevant.
---
Venders only sell  broken pro snap cameras

Not the deluxe model you need
---
Ive just started a second character and at level 40ish (higher than my first) fought two sheepsquatches and several deadclaws all 50-60+ by myself with just light leather Armor and only needed a couple stimpaks on each, and was pretty much shrugging off any damage from SBs so maybe there was something wrong with the servers yesterday? 
---
I‚Äôm pretty new to the higher level stuff so don‚Äôt know whether this is normal or not
---
Before going to a place, have a look at the map. The level of the enemies in that area (cell) are based on the last player that went there, so if a L100+ is around your destination, server hop or do something else. Unless you are ready to face high level enemies.
---
That said, you should consider getting a 1 star Vampire weapon. That will help a lot and, if it is one star only, you can often find one free in the trading channels. I was easily able to solo Whitepring when I was level 24 with a Vampire shotgun.
---
I like the one where I walk from one holotape to the next holotape! I'm being facetious, obviously.
---
I'd say Rose's quests, because they were themed, you learnt about the different raider clans, there was a traditional NPC / quest giver with an actual personality. Got to feed explosive meat to some dogs. All the good stuff.
---
Rose's quests and the Enclave quests. The only quests with substance are the only quests with an NPC attached to them. Go figure.
---
Changed mine a few times but it always reverts back. CBA anymore
---
Don't fool yourself. Good low level items are valuable and sought after. I wouldn't be surprised if you could trade this for a meta weapon and then some.
---
Fallout 76, an online experience, where some players enjoy sh\*tting on others, almost literally in this situation.
---
Hmm i have an anti armor that's now 140dmg and two shot thats 156dmg....  you may be on to something.
---
I‚Äôm trying to turn it on when I‚Äôm in a world I can‚Äôt hear anyone or talk to anyone and I use to be able to but I didn‚Äôt use game chat that much back when I was able but now that I want to use it it doesn‚Äôt work
---
Some players just want to watch others burn, literally.
---
We were discussing events, but it works very well for Whitesprings farming too. Owning a tesla is extremely easier than the one-shotting super weapon they are using now. It's just a question of how much of a team person you are. Do you care about others? Carry a tagging weapon. It could be a light pistol or tesla. If you don't care about other players, don't, but poeple aree going to get pissed.
---
Yup i will be doing this after work as well and the weekend. I would be happy with 51b or the 60 set but honestly having all 3 would be cool. I have a camo paint for the t series i would like to use.
---
Your not wanted here degenerates, leave Appalachia at once or lethal force will be authorized. Appalachia belongs to the good people of America and the Enclave.
---
You went through all that trouble of dropping these two items on your own bed, then going on with some ungodly lame story that even Tumblr would roll its eyes at  just to make this post?
---
The problem is F76 needs new content ASAP. And i mean, serious expansions. Game is too easy after level 50, and let everyone reaching the end too soon. Also, new players can abuse the help of high level players. There are tons of lacks. I don't find any point to keep playing and farming legendaries.....for what ?.
---
I have seen it at raider vendors and i think grafton?
---
Could be worse,they could of set the bag on fire.
---
Your world is full ill join soon as it opens up. My gt is REBEL69420
---
But thats the fun part.. :D
---
Here. I'm a "soloish" player 95% of the time. Because i want to read in peace terminals-papers-olotapes without getting bothered. When my stash is full i just get rid of things or create something. For example, i tossed out dozens of mininukes, materials (wood. steel and whatever). I really don't have time to mess with other characters transferring--sharing..etc. F__k that.
---
I think either Graham or Rare Robot Trader.
---
Ok. Sorry to be a whatever but..cmon. This is the wasteland. We all awoke.  Some of us were idealist listening to the Overseer. Others looked out and said wtf I can rebuild this. I‚Äôll take my slice.  We are the legendary founders of the factions in the future games. Whether good or bad. We started it all since our vault was zero experiments.  We decided what games cities controls we would impose later as we gained followers and laid out plans that some survived to implement.  Others didn‚Äôt.  
---
So don‚Äôt get attached to your equipment.  We know the history   Eventually we and our offspring destroyed the QSB and asserted ourselves in factions we laid laws down that eventually were warped.  
---
We are simply children in s sand box that we will turn to dust.
---
as long as its not bottleable i see no harm, since you cant carry the bowl everywhere and booze only lasts 3mins at most
---
"my mutant friend and me" , has a nice ring to it
---
I was going to show you this post. I guess you've seen it now.
---
If I had to guess, I'd say that if they were going to bring any of it back, it'd probably only be for a week or something. Some of the really shit stuff they removed I could see being gone for good.
---
We haven't had a patch since last week so this would have started happening then
---
Believe it or don't, it happened so I thought I'd share.
---
This is true.
---
I get that messed up abdominal skin with the nuka cola outfit sometimes too. Do you know how to fix it? Also what paint do you have on the x01?
---
Hmm I thought they said they had fixed that already. Classic Bethesda.
---
Still on my first one, L201 now, and previously when fighting the sheepsquach i used 3-4 stims earlier i needed 8.  But i needed 9 drums of ammo which is quite an increase.  I use the perkcards but no mutations or drugs and rhats not changed, so i cant figure the sudden drop on my gauss rifle.
---
Mirvs split at the top of the arc. If you don't aim up the top of the arc is where you are standing
---
While I get what you're saying this is within 10 seconds of walking up and standing still for about 10 seconds more
---
Can't tell if you're honestly whining or not, if you are you're totally overreacting and deserve for your camp to be blown up, or not then I laugh at it because that's what I would do lol
---
Yeah, 10 seconds is all I need to think "Maybe they've gone for a piss, quick! Assume the position!"
---
Slot 2 is reserved for the Stat boosting legendary effects so that's not something that would happen. They need to rework how those two effects work

I think people would lock their door or selfish we‚Äôre supposed to be helping each other what if I needed one purified water help out at least you to do is have unlocked wanted to purifiers outside and some farm equipment you know some people just fight five scores piece in a row I need to repair their weapon and then you‚Äôre going to be the jerk protecting your little turf hogging the acid or junkpile just so you can forward your items to maybe sell them to us later that‚Äôs the worst kind of player and 76 right now in my opinion. I keep an industrial water open outside I keep wine inside I keep every crafting inside with an unlocked door so that people can get the help they need and if they blow it up so what it cost hardly anything to repair same with the vegetables oh now you have to find a couple little things to fix them and no you don‚Äôt have to do the fix all all you do is go to the individual plant and fix the couple you fix a BlackBerry it alreadyImmediately has another black berry right to fix a second BlackBerry if you noticed so selfish people like you who like your door and hog resources especially those one on the top with the acid when every day needs acid can go fly a kite they‚Äôre the ones that I‚Äôm thinking about wiping out there homesteads and I‚Äôve never wife one out before

A house divided against itself, cannot stand.

Pvp armor has no business in this game. The people with the best sets are dupers or people that play way above the average played time for most people. 
---
This creates a barrier for the majority and sets a bad first experience for them against someone with it. 
---
To make this game more competitive and accessible, all armor enhancements should be pve only. 
---
My other argument is if this is it creates only 1 build meta. This is unhealthy. Just like how bloodied is unhealthy and should be brought into balance. If armor enhancements are removed for pvp it will create more varied armor builds.
---
You literally hit one button. How much of a tutorial do you need? You tried it maybe 100 times and still can't get it? This might actually be the worst reddit community.
---
Sorry to say, it'll never be any of that. Temper expectations now to avoid disappointment.
---
Once in a blue moon I see someone without a default icon. I had just assumed it was bugged.
---
Raider Vendor has it for sure, found it at the pleasant valley vendor
---
This is correct. You can join a world and choose the move option without actually placing the camp and it will be in the same spot the next time.
---
Fair warning, even with perks it's still trash. I learnt that the hard way.
---
Hubby lost an arm on his X01 and just now a chest piece on his Excavator. Both times it's happened when fast travelling.
---
From what I've read, there is only one set of servers. I helped out a reddit user from around the world the other day. They aren't regions.
---
I usually top the bag off with a Molotov, but hey, to each their own.
---
Why not give Adventure mode players the option, when logging in, as to whether or not they wish to show their camp placement to other players on the server for each session...
---
Are you on ps4? Do you have the ps gold wireless headset?

I'm sorry - I have to give you an up vote .

Isn't this literally already a thing?

The Enclave are wrong and the government has failed us! It is time we rose from the ashes! Do not listen to this traitor of humanity, join me my Brothers!

Maybe you contracted a grounded mutation
---
It should‚Äôve never cost caps to fast travel. And there should be some perk where you can fast travel even over encumbered because I‚Äôm getting sick of playing but I have to walk every damn where because I have to keep enough weapons because a break but they don‚Äôt start fixing it I‚Äôm done playing this stupid game of weapons break too soon you have to carry too many so you have to stay over weight and then any You have if you do get down here to waste too fast travel and who the hell are you paying to fast travel what alien race is fast traveling for you and collecting those caps
---
Yeah, my door was locked and I still came home to 3 scorched wrecking my stuff.
---
I could be miss remembering but I'm sure when someone asked for the same thing the other week, a Bethesda staff member said they'd pass it along.
---
I'll see if I can find it.
---
&gt;Claimed the Poseidon Plant workshop 
---
Well who the fuck's fault is that? You literally initiated it. Such a worm. Get out.
---
They have too many underground spaces and hidden locked away areas for future content so they are reducing the area that you can build on and eventually we‚Äôre going to end up with a city area where we can build. Where everybody will have to build and it‚Äôs going to look stupid because we can‚Äôt make an actual town like we should be able to or we can fight off mutant hordes or something by making fences that cover our new city that would make it too much like we were rebuilding the world after the crisis they didn‚Äôt manage their space right they didn‚Äôt  Their camp spacing right they still can‚Äôt manage wait right on items or else people could fast shower a lot more than I can so you‚Äôre asking way too much from them they‚Äôre just gonna lower and lower the air is we can build in and it‚Äôs gonna be harder and harder to find your friends on the same server because there‚Äôs gonna be so few places to actually put up your camp and that‚Äôs the reality just look at the history of Bethesda
---
Awesome outfit
---
are you, uh.. are you ok?
---
I see what you mean. But those Mosaic tiles looked awesome. I didn't know about them u til I saw a player put them down as he was building.
---
I would do anything to have them now.
---
It does affect you, you are just not thinking about how it does.
---
So I wasn't crazy in thinking there was potentially a connection between the Interloper and West-Tek's research. After watching some of Oxhorn's content on the escaped creations of the first Snallygaster and Grafton Monster, I thought, what if the Interloper is just a super mutated Snallygaster? More specifically, the one that West-Tek never captured. I don't know if Oxhorn ever hypothesizes this, and I'm not sure how likely it is that the escaped original Snally went from Huntersville to the Lucky Hole Mine. All I know is, I would LOVE to see the Interloper show up as a super-powered cryptid for us all to fight at the tail-end of Wild Appalachia (or some other cryptid-related update).
---
That's actually a fairly well known bug. I've had a ghoul do that before. It was really funny.
---
Such a wierd intensity to your anger at this. Equally wierd thing to be mad about.
---
Sorry that‚Äôs all it is now I played fallout four recently after playing fallout 76 is the beta hundreds and hundreds of hours and I realized you can change the world in fallout four you can‚Äôt do jack and follow 76 except loot and shoot sorry that‚Äôs what it is that‚Äôs all it will ever be unless they introduce workshops where they are settlers NBC‚Äôs that players can take over the workshop and rule them have them farm build And have a city Lake in fallout four have like five of them around we can even have supply lines other players could attack the supply line or they could help protect them you could team up you get have a few people I am a council president taxation manager whatever shops even but people who could talk to who can have families who can give you a little quest who can farm Foria but instead we do nothing except build a house that we have to relocate every once in a while. 
---
Simply making three or four workshops that are settlements newly entered into West Virginia and PCs who are looking for protection whoever gets there first then can put up and defend them and if you defend them and they survive then you can build them houses like fallout four and Tourette‚Äôs and then maybe you were a friend or even an enemy can get the third and fourth settlement and make a truce or Deals and they can trade back-and-forth and you can both make money like bottle caps like the old merchant things and you can have actual readers that are fallout 76 players to go in and read the towns maybe they can‚ÄôtKill the NPC‚Äôs but maybe they can enter them for 2030 minutes or somehow limit the productivity of the settlement hurting the person that owns the settlement but there‚Äôs Apsley no reason to not turn this workshop idea into a town workshop idea where there‚Äôs real people and that‚Äôs how you control them by controlling the workshop because they‚Äôre looking for a leader someone to protect them and you‚Äôre there protector you build their houses you build everything the rad storms hurt them you have to build walls and tourist protective and wild animals yet to put them to work like all you had to do in fallout four and they couldn‚Äôt help protect you against other players to try to take over the workshop they would make for a very fun adventure and it‚Äôs my idea on the first to put on here months ago and of course some idiot on here told me they didn‚Äôt like it so they deleted it but it‚Äôs a good idea a workshop of NBC‚Äôs 3 to 4 it‚Äôs a slow move to factions but you could protect them you could even be elected out of office if their happiness was not good enough or if you left long enough but no one wants to actuallyI had such a good idea instead let‚Äôs just had some new quipped it which makes it a lunar and shooter and that‚Äôs it and I am fed up with it after playing fall out for for the fourth time it‚Äôs so much more than 476 because I actually change the world are you nothing in Faltz 76 yet except give somebody something or go there pick up that listen to that holiday it‚Äôs gotten boring
---
I play without any mutation, but it was the first thi g i checked.
---
I‚Äôve just started a new build last week for one handed melee, It‚Äôs incredibly efficient, I don‚Äôt spend half my time trying to get ammo or perks for different weapons. I focused also on getting lots of water to farm for vendor selling. 
---
I started with a machete until I lucked across a ski sword and have used that since, and pretty much just fought enemies around the Charleston land fill/ Poseidon area and did events quests in the area. Also it‚Äôs not bad doing it on survival if you want the extra XP. 
---
Priority was strength, lone wanderer to 4 ASAP (assuming solo play) and some Marathoner / action boygirl due to all the running, then pretty much just strength until you get suitable perks for others. 
---
Biggest plus of this build is you can run around taking on mutants scorched etc without having to retreat to reload or when they come on to you

In terms of Armor, I‚Äôve literally been running around in light leather Armor just scrapping and replacing when brokenb
---
I‚Äôm downing pretty much everything in one or two hits and soloing deatchlaws and other legendaries. 
---
This is my highest level character so I‚Äôm pretty new to strategy and don‚Äôt know how effective it will end up being if I ever need to pvp etc. 
---
I‚Äôd be happy for comments or feedback, I intend to post questions about my build soon
---
the real problem is the lack of things to do - I am lvl 93, got the gear and weapons that I wanted, the build done, got all the map locations visited and all that remained is to upgrade from bos heavy combat armor to vanguards sentinel (not really worth it for full time PA user tho) and to launch a nuke (won't bother with that at all)
---
so, all I can do now is login just when a new quest appears, get it done and wait for another
---
This is ridiculous. It looks like you want to weaken all the builds except for what you probably use.
---
Bloodied doesnt increase rad damage, but it does increase ballistic damage of the gamma gun by quite a bit
---
Only thing that changes the rad damage is adding a deep dish mod which will put it to 125. Legendary effects don't really make a difference as with those things it's all about the rads. Most non PA will get seriously stung with one, especially bloodied builds.
---
Why not eliminate the caps reward entirely from workshop pvp? The reward should be the workshop, not stealing another players caps. 
---
This would also promote people contesting points solely for the workshops, so you won't get some uber pvpers contesting everyone's workshops then not even using them because they just wanted to take everybody's caps.
---
what is you weapon accuracy?
---
Explosive trait tend to reduce accuracy a lot
---
I didn't think serendipity procked on crits? And it's wierd all my other shots(12 of them) showed I hit cause they were filling up my crit meter.
---
You can always find someone who has it and pay them to install in your camp, as a temp solution.
---
They can try to destroy your base all they want.   All you need to do is just leave the server and join another one and you end up with minimal damage.  
---
I did that the other day when a player who had taken over a buddies workshop and killed both of us in 5 seconds flat (so we let him have it) showed up at my camp and started shooting up the place.  I just left the server.  
---
Soon, though, there will be a patch that will prevent your base from being destroyed when in Adventure mode.
---
Yes. Raiders need to rise.  Content needs to rise.  After hundreds of hours this game has devolved to zip. Taking pics and I‚Äôve seen soo many complaints of ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt put my camp here anymore‚Äù ‚Äú Simone shot up my camp‚Äù. And the jerk who hogs acid on the hill with a locked resource really ticks me off. Acid is hard enough to get. And yeah I don‚Äôt get locked doors.  So much for the nice guys leaving presents.  No one locked their doors when I was playing up until last month.   Then it‚Äôs all locked up. Everything.  So I guess they forgot we are supposed to rebuild the earth but not with any of their workshop use.  One jerk pulled out a bunch of legendary ghouls at whitesprings.  My sledge broke I followed him back to his place he locked it. I said I just needs to fix it. He said tough. He‚Äôll tag then from his third floor and I‚Äôm to kill them..so he could get exp and loot. So yeah. I‚Äôm pissed. Normally. I‚Äôm the one giving you free everything. Just walking up and dropping stuff waving and heading off. But now people want to play those games.  I‚Äôll adjust.
---
what about roads to get there!?
---
haven't seen a single one without holes, missing pieces or blocks
---
a vertibird van would make more sense
---
This is ridiculous.
---
I agree this whole list is wack
---
Oh I did this!  During Everquest beta when my enchanter could turn into Felwithe Castle. (Minor enchant).  I found it quite funny to sit in front of the real castle and move slightly to the left or right and watch people try and "enter" the door and run into brick wall.   Then back off confused.
---
I would go next door to kelethin and make it a challenge to go from one side of the city to the other while drunk.  Never made it once.   I think I had something like slow fall or levitate or something, but I don't remember dying.
---
What system? I get the loading inside of West Tek crash pretty often. I'd say 2/10, your vats issue I have not experienced at all though. This is on xb1
---
Due to incidents lately w jerks pulling ghouls. 62 lev. Leaving me letting my weapons break. Telling me to follow to his camp to repair then he locks door and laughs. Sniping a small tag on each so he got free legendaries and exp.  so yeH hundreds of hours I‚Äôve given out aid ammo weapons mini nukes fatmen you name it to people. Just walk up salute drop and move on and now I‚Äôve run more into jerks like that. So yeah. I‚Äôm off my rocker at this minute on it.
---
That is hilarious,and yet nasty. I can enjoy this kind of humour, since I have multiple beds on my camp.
---
Also I leave propaganda flyers when I visit camps.
---
Nah, just a little exaggeration. I didn't mind, I got a kick out of it.
---
And besides after taking Poseidon probably 100 times and helping out probably 1000 players I think I‚Äôm entitled to a rant and rave for once I‚Äôve given away so much ammo fusion Cors I‚Äôve taken people on trips low level ones to where there‚Äôs power armor taking me hours watching them when they couldn‚Äôt seem to even walk straight helping them are in missions I‚Äôve done everything the game is supposed to be but I am definitely for openCamps unless of course there‚Äôs someway to steal something from them that I‚Äôm not aware of
---
After seeing this, it's gonna be my go to thing when I visit others camps.
---
The only quests I really enjoyed were the ones that spoke directly to you even if you couldn't base, which were the Rose and Enclave quests. I still cringe thinking about dead swamp girl who somehow left audio tapes everywhere you go which triggers on things you do. They couldn't have just have someone in another bunker who radios you when you do stuff? 
---
And OP saying that Fallout is about story is true, but the amount of story in the game does not exceed the replayability of the current games leveling, looting and killing. It seems to be a comment from someone very casual which the game has a lot of.
---
I now have 79 copies of "RobCo facility access card" on my character that I cannot get rid of..... They really need to add a keyring.
---
I'm 101% certain it happened because variations on this are my favourite thing to do just at the moment.
---
I also play sounds from a 'Predator' soundboard app I have on the phone... Little amuses the simple, eh? :)
---
Well I had just finished my house this past weekend but only put one bed in it. Maybe I'll add a guest room and keep my locked off or something haha.
---
I have a camp setup right next to sunrise field, south of watoga station, there is a mirelurk king and queen spawn there, they constantly attack my base, but that's half the fun. That's also a good spot for a pic
---
You can't install atomic shop items for other players. You can do it for other items. But as soon as the other player stores it away, they can't use it unless they have the plans. Did it with track lights and had to find the plans to use them again.
---
And you can down vote all you want it‚Äôs still it‚Äôs supposed to be a cooperative game and locking doors is it really cooperative I‚Äôve helped literally thousands from the beta helping them with events getting them power armor places wanting them for hours request at all and I‚Äôll run into this new idea people locking up everything they have just so you can‚Äôt even get a purified water after you fight a couple sports bees and I‚Äôve run out of ammo and everything else that‚Äôs not quite the way to be neighborly is it a downpour what you want I don‚Äôt care that doesn‚Äôt bother me I‚Äôm allowed to write rant and rave after I‚Äôve put hundreds and hundreds of hours into this game playing at the way you should helping out lower-level players I‚Äôve crafted weapons for them I‚Äôve spent so so many times bring down everything but the last couple points of scorch beast so they can get the last tags in and get the ultra site and stuff they need I‚Äôm guided them on quest to get their excavate tour armor I‚Äôve done more to help more people than I have to help myself but then to come across people who are like in their doors when you can‚Äôt even steal stuff is ridiculous and just cause you don‚Äôt like somebody sayingThat the suggestion that everybody now should lock your door you want to download go ahead it‚Äôs no skin off my back
---
Vampire barbed walking stick
---
1. The bug with the missed shots right after entering vats seems to have returned, but it's not as bad as before. I just wait half a second after locking on a target and it's working okayish.
---
2. Crits should always hit regardless of %. If you're using a gauss rifle and charge then enter vats trigger a crit and fire you'll probably miss. The gauss rifle is bugged that way.
---
3. Never use two-shot with vats. The % chance displayed is not the real one. VATS chance is calculated for 1 single bullet that being shot from the middle of your barrel. Two-shot weapons have 2 bullets and each of them is slightly offset. There are tons of threads about hit chance with two-shot weapons. Tl;dr version: Don't use TS weapons with vats. Not worth it.
---
4. No crashes for be but i do have some nasty stutters right after i join a server.
---
Weaken? I'm trying to find a balance between everything. I did not nerf everything to the ground, I adjusted things subjectively. I apologize that you don't like my suggestions and I will take it into consideration.
---
Yeah xbox as well.
---
When you get attacked your mutations can go off and it registers as you attacking. Then it is a PvP situation.
---
Raiders. Ugh. You ya'll look so damn cool that someone's gotta roast ya. That someone is me: 
---
* I think people do a 360 around you looking for what went wrong.  
---
* "One man's trash...is this man's armor."  
---
* You look like a scorchbeast swallowed you whole then shit you out alive over Charleston Landfill &amp; whatever handicap toilets stuck to your body you used as armor.  
---
* It looks like you're waiting for the next train outta Watoga because it just wasn't classy enough for you there.   
---
* Something tells me that if I shot that gas tank on your back with TSE Fatman your armor would still look the same after the smoke cleared.   
---
* You look like Feral Ghouls run up to you, give you hugs and tell you, "Hang in there buddy, everything is going to be allright."  
---
* That skull on your back was from someone who died laughing at your armor.  
---
* Nothing says, "fully protected" like a roll cage for your head and gas tank filled with ammonium nitrate strapped to your back.   
---
* You look exactly how we all feel about your armor.  
---
* Mole Rats ambush you with canned stew and well wishes.  
---
* You look like you smell so bad that when you enter a nuke zone, the mask comes off and you say, "Finally, a breath of fresh air!"  
---
* Faction: Post-Apocalypitc Trash Pandas  
---
* Faction: Brotherhood of Steal Your Trash.  
---
* I walked up to the Tinker's Workbench in front of you, selected "Scrap All Junk" and you disappeared.  
---
* You look like you strapped a big magnet to your chest and went head first into Jeep Wrangler then rolled into a dump truck.  
---
* You look like all the junk we lost. Ever.
---
Jokes aside, full Raider armor is so terrifyingly stunning that I too stop and take in the incredible sight. Good job, Op (and thanks for taking a good joke or two)! 
---
;)
---
By going near the shack,you mean that you fast traveled to the shack ,or that you walked to it from a closer location?
---
I also did this quest and a couple others once in 700 hours
---
Hahaha, don‚Äôt share your tips with a cry baby tbh
---
I haven‚Äôt seen that specifically before but ghouls, scorched etc have been exploding like sentry bots or legendary robots since the second last patch. Rarely, but it happens.
---
Been super bad for crashing at west tec for me too... I'm also xbox
---
Also been getting this, connecting from UK
---
T-45d was made to look like a downgrade to the T-51b as 51b was the successor to the 45d. But in reality the 51b was designed first for fallout 1, the 45d was first mentioned in Van Buren and then Bethesda‚Äôs art guy designed it to look like the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù to the T-51b.
---
When fallout 4 started in development they wanted to redesign the 45d in the new engine with new artists and they created the T-60. It looked different enough that they thought to change it and jam in the T-60 into the timeline. 
---
The only way this really make sense is to think of it as more of a refurbished T-45d. Instead of continuing to produce the costly and superior T-51b which was made of high quality ceramic parts they redesigned the 45d into the T-60. Cheaper to produce but very heavily armored. It‚Äôs a fairly common practice in war time when parts and money are tight. Also explains why in 76 the T-51b has better overall stats than the 60 but costs a LOT more to repair.
---
Weak
---
That is all.
---
Perk cards like to randomly unequip themselves. Try taking off all your perk cards closing out of the menu and then going back in and redoing your perk card loadout. If that doesn‚Äôt fix it then it possibly could be a stealth nerf to damage to try and artificially increase the difficulty of the end game content.
---
Someone wants attention
---
I hope they are able to solve this fast considering the limited time sales they love to do.
---
Thanks for chiming in was worried I was hitting some sort of Australian firewall (like how Japan can't buy them) or something :|
---
Dude don't say anything bad about the story! You'll get downvoted, here on this subreddit you have to love every little aspect of FO76 else people get butthurt. 
---
And yeah i share your feelings about Abbie's quest line. It was one of the worst.
---
The issue isn't legendary items, I think it's one of the best additions to 4/76. The issue is farming those legendaries is really all theirs left to do because of how difficult it is to get the best of those legendaries.
---
Cheers for the clarification, it does seem like I've seen a big performance drop off with my two shot lever action though. I never used to have this problem but it could just be my perception of it. I have a furious lever action and it is definitely more accurate.
---
damn! the Don Rickles of Fallout! lmao.. thanks
---
You started with an almost unagreeable position, and presented it so poorly that no one will be on your side. I don't owe you anything from my camp just because you have given things to people in the past, and yet you're acting like we're the bad people for not acquiescing to your whim.
---
There is one it‚Äôs called r/fallout76settlements I believe :)
---
And you must speak as softly as you can in area chat so no one knows you‚Äôre carrying a big stick.
---
Things are balanced. For example, with bloodied you do more damage at the cost of health. Everything already has pros and cons, strengths and weaknesses. Why unbalance things to suit what you want?
---
TS works much better if you manually aim, use it that way, it's still a good gun :)
---
üòÇ
---
MODUS is a great character and I want more of it.
---
You got dumpsacked!
---
When someone puts a couch/workbench/anything you can interact with near a window, I always get it and look around.
---
Now, I've got a friend who has the greatest set up in the world. I dont know how he did it, but someone his entire CAMP is under the world. The only way to access it? He has a little building on top, with a cooking station hidden by a sleeping bag. You have to find the right stitch in the sleeping bag, click craft, exit and bam you're in his CAMP.  But there is literally no way to get in unless you know these steps. 
---
It's quite fun when you have people hunting you, I only wish I could actually watch them as they lose their minds. It's obvious from the map we are there, his CAMP is obviously there. But where are we?
---
Fucking sorcery I tell you.
---
When one of the updates came out my installation was missing a bunch of textures from the atom shop meaning any camp item using an atom shop item was just missing from my world. A lot of camps had no floors allowing for non-picking entry.
---
This is true. After returning after 5 months for the double exp weekend and leveling another character, my initial end game before was farming exp, farming legendaries, and scorchbeast queen, but the double exp felt like what the game was before all the exp nerfs... and legendary farming is still just as bad with me receiving no "decent" loot (which hopefully the vendor fixes). The OPs argument is that there is no real end game to grind for... which that's why they are trying to get better legendaries because that's all there is to do at the end game, not story content. The only reason I returned was to level another character, because I enjoy the RPG element of getting new perks to customize my character. Saying people are dumb to be farming for loot when all there is left is to farm for loot is dumb.
---
They're running around the wasteland headbutting stuff like a crippled ghoul.
---
Of course you don‚Äôt and no one has to be.  But it‚Äôs a free country and I chose to for once take a jerk position.  Normally I take the nice side and yes I like all the other stuff. But I‚Äôm in a bad mood and I decided to go anti.  I never complain about others. I‚Äôve done everything to help others and gotten one shot many times taking it all in stride.  So tonight before I go to bed while I wrap up some work on Quara making some moola I chose to attack.  
---
I apologize for that.  Just one of those times you feel like being an .... and let it fly. So yes I‚Äôm sorry I even commented on the post.  I used it to throw out some stress.   I have twin daughters one with throat cancer.  That is true. My wife was a b...tonight.  I‚Äôve got forty patients in preparing charts for    So that‚Äôs not excuses. But it is the reason I lashed out.  
---
I play these games to blank out.  So. You and the others deserve an apology.  And this is it.  But I did need to de stress by lashing out.  Better to do it here than at office in morning.
---
I made my camp as a three story building. First and second stories are dedicated to crafting and guest beds + music instruments and the punch bowl. Between second and third stories I have erected half walls + doorway with a locked door.
---
Oh for sure it's still good, just my build is focused around vats for survival so I experience a certain degree of panic when people start gunning for me and I can't retaliate. Although my furious handmade is proving to be an excellent substitute. I have a heavy weapons build as well and my TSE 50 cal melts things but is way less dependent on accuracy ha.
---
*Interrupts arguing*  Hi, I'm from that vault up the hill. Gosh it's nice to be out here... say, *looks them up and down* that's nice coats and guns you have there...
---
You and I are clearly playing a different game if everything is balanced
---
Nice, but why no lights in the living area?
---
If the game is that buggy, maybe reevaluate giving them more cash for a while. ü§£
---
That‚Äôs a shame. Not something I would‚Äôve expected either, and unfortunately the +25 radiation damage legendary effect wasn‚Äôt carried over from fallout 4.
---
I guess the best effect would be faster fire rate to apply radiation faster. You could also try and find out if a critical hit helps.
---
His conversation with the Raven Rock AI ZAX is super interesting.
---
Yes, it is quite annoying and I've reported it to beth months ago to no avail.

How much testing did you do? Are you sure it wasn't a glitch or something?
---
I have both versions already. Lol
---
Maybe the problem is you don't know how tonplay. What isn't balanced? Sentinel protects you if you're standing still but offers no protection if you walk or crouch. Shoot them when they move. Cavalier gives you protection but only when you run. Shoot them when they stop. The game really isn't very complicated where you need to change the whole thing to suit your build.
---
Where are you that you're getting that much consistent and negative player interaction? Also what weapons do you use? I have a heavy weapons build and they used to be made out of toilet paper and hope but since using weapon artisan and other durability perks I rarely have real issues with weapon and armour durability. Same with my rifleman build.
---
The wiki has a picture of him with a red skull for a face, but I've never seen it in game.
---
Possibly (probably) unrelated but I did seem to be burning a load more ammo yesterday with my 10mm and Western.  VATS just wasnt cutting it for head shots like it usually does plus my range seemed much more limited than normal (both have long barrel mods).
---
Perks and mutations were the set as they ever are (high P, A and L)  with Speed Demon and Marsupial.
---
Laser trip and electric traps.
---
I was taking pictures of a Scorchbeast vs Mirelurk King fight when I heard sentry bot sounds and started looking around expecting to be bombarded.
---
Took me a moment to realize it was the mirelurk king. He also exploded on death.
---
Had  a cat at my base for quite a while now, it's a bugger to milk though.
---
It's not a trading post.. Lol.
---
Is it just me or has a nice floating indicator just recently been added to the game to show where our paper bags are not on the map but on the actual game screen!? I‚Äôm seeing one hovering over mine right now üò≥
---
I agree with these other guys. This game is not supposed to be super balanced. It has trade offs. Always has always will. This is exactly why the PVP part of this game is arguably taking away from the core experience. 
---
People in full assassin sent/cav can be beat. Invest is good AA weapons that have high fire rate to counter any regen they may have, the AA is the only way to RIP through their armor and heres a hint, it doesnt have to be 3* or AAE! Bloodied people get insane damage because they are always a few hits away from death. Vanguard people get insane first few hit defenses but drop way off after. Unyielding mixes with bloodied but at the cost of defense bluffs gained with Bolstering. Literally everything is a give and take. The more they start taking away the more the PVE side suffers, which is what fallout has always been. 
---
I run a full sentinal set not for PVP but for PVE. I like mitigating the damage coming from say the sheepsquatch or other enemies that chew you up. There will always be builds that seem to top your own or other players that are better, this does not mean things need to be balanced (nerfed) so everyone that joined late can compete on the PVP side. 
---
Theres always going to be a build that will destroy what you currently run, or a player that flat out beats you. Just accept it and move on or learn from it and adapt. Not trying to be a dick but nobody wants to see everything they have grinded and traded (probably really good stuff) for go to waste because of more "balance" changes.
---
Love this paint job. I snagged blackbird when it was out and haven't got a PA skin since but this is sorely tempting despite not using PA on my current character.
---
You don't understand how Sentinel/Cavalier damage reduction works.
---
Showing a basic grasp of basic game mechanics and elaborating on how the proposed changes would improve on the existing ones would add some credence to your argument.
---
As it stands it reads 'change this because I say so'.
---
Good to hear :)
---
It was before last patch. And never had anyone destroyed my base.  I was holding  Poseidon for an hour so I could get a few parent whores to last me you know several sessions and then I want to walk around the entire map on the railroad and I heard the alarm I came back slowly walking and there was some jerk three of them just been a part of my camp for no reason or Yellit him why are you doing that you can have what you want and they said something around white and that was the worst interaction I‚Äôve ever had with players other than the two that played the game of when you‚Äôre having the workshop one guy pretends to be your friend and me and my hasHey sniper friend watching the one shot you sometime and then steal everything you have which didn‚Äôt bother me because I hardly carry any trash and junk but what got me is they did it like 10 times in a row even when I kept telling him give me a chance to unload the workshop or if you want it you can have but they just kept doing that and taking my cab so our server Hopton that‚Äôs really the worst interaction I had except at the ammo plans I got to defend against to scorch beast and I was slowly whittling them down a third one showed up and then a level 281 guyCame when I had the third scorch beast down to about half his health and he came over and sledgehammered me to death just as I was about to kill the third scorch beast eluded him he took my bag of stuff and then I went to the nearby river to kill a couple scorch beast to get the altar site and he messaged me and said oh do you want your stuff back I said no why don‚Äôt you go ahead and keep it since you wanted so much he could‚Äôve waited and let me get the ultrasound but no.  Those are really the only bad experience I‚Äôve had most of been very good but like I said I was in a bad mood tonight I‚Äôm in a better mood right now I just feel like lashing out so sorry about that but you know how it goes sometimes you lash out at the wrong people at the wrong time I can happen
---
In the white springs thing it‚Äôs that person that keeps putting the tour it‚Äôs right there at the door and he‚Äôll pull them out and I‚Äôm sitting there killing them and then he won‚Äôt help he‚Äôll run away I‚Äôll get swamped and he goes runs around round locks his door and I lose what I can but with a dead sledgehammer when I usually just carry that when I‚Äôm doing that he really pisses me off but that‚Äôs been a patch and a half ago since I haven‚Äôt tried doing that he was just a jerk but I think he was called out on Reddit about that
---
Damage has been increased on super mutants for sure. Been getting my ass kicked by them more since  Tuesday at least at West Tek.  I swear either armor DR means nothing now, or damage reduction perks are broken.  I ran about 150 runs of West Tek this past 2x exp weekend.  I have since done about 15 more since Tuesday and for sure I am taking about 40% more damage than usual.  I wonder if enemies might also have all been given more anti armor as well.
---
That was a long walk for a dick joke.
---
 I‚Äôm on Xbox my name is my name on here so if you‚Äôre ever on there and want to team up and I happen to be on there I‚Äôll be happy to just ignore me tonight I was just lashing out and I‚Äôm glad I lashed out because it‚Äôs better to lash out in words then in physical violence in anyway shape or form I mean I want to wash our cars tonight and the car wash stole $10 for me and my credit card a $10 car wash and it charge me 20 bucksSo my night started a little pissy that way so sorry about my attitude earlier and I hope y‚Äôall have a good night and happy hunting in fallout
---
It‚Äôs better than trapping people in a room full of traps to kill them.
---
People could just cancel the action and stand up in this case. I‚Äôd be all for it.
---
Tip: name it `Zz` because `Zealot` will come after `ZZ something`.
---
If it were opt-in.
---
That was I thinking about. If we would be able to change dimensions (min/max should be set), we could build towns :)
---
Congratulations the first time I did that was the most exciting time on the game and then once you figure out how to get them to land and to do it I can get easier and easier but not at first I don‚Äôt get excited right just yet still be very careful because there be time is it two or three decide to show up or they fly off and suddenly all their health is right back hundred percent
---
How effective you say? They couldn‚Äôt hit an elephant from that dis..........
---
RIP
---
This one was my favourite
---
&gt;* I walked up to the Tinker's Workbench in front of you, selected "Scrap All Junk" and you disappeared.
---
Do you have a weapon with +250 DR while reloading effect? There is currently a bug that will lower damage on all weapons when you use such legendary weapons.
---
I love the generosity in this game,  occasionally when I've got nothing better to do I pop to lowbie areas ( overseers camp etc..) And craft armor and weapons (LVL 5-10) to put in the overseers chests 
---
I also put in spare plans and ammo, stimpacks etc..
---
It sounds like you need invest more time into planning and maintaining your weapons. There is no need to be carrying around so many that you are encumbered a lot of the time.
---
I didn't scrap anything between logging out the last time and noticing the gun was missing when i logged back in
---
&gt;  I have to keep enough weapons because *[ they ]* break
---
My weapons don't break.  Maybe you should look into keeping them in better condition.
---
Perfect, thank you!
---
yup.  gharand excavator.
---
I was in my camp and didn't use any containers
---
I've sold a lot of 3\* melee and armors to vendors due to weight/stash limit or simply not using those types of items. My heart aches every time.
---
What platform are you on?
---
having sent a video of the problem, and the fact that i do not have access to perk cards gone missing, i am confident the issue will be resolved to my satisfaction.
---
Tse flamer is the only tse gun i have ever found, i got a total of 3 (well two now) and wonder how people can afford so many :D Maybe im doing something wrong but i could never afford to buy multiple tse guns
---
Well the sloth was in my camp for over a week
---
 Yeah I know I need to figure out what I really need because all I really use is a 45 automatic and the sledge hammer for up close signs I can‚Äôt even member the last time I pull the 308 sniper rifle out but then it just feels like you want to hold on and all these other weapons
---
It happens nearly all the time i play survival if the battle ends up close to a spawn point everyone has invincibility for a certain timeframe when they spawn in(30 seconds or something) and if you dont shoot you stay invincible even if your gun is drawn so they can stare at you with their gun out and kill you any moment
---
might want to go to a weapons bench and take a close look at your guns.
---
hardened and armour piercing is a must do.
---
I could have done the same (no legendarys),at a fraction of the ammo cost,and faster, with a bog standard hunting rifle at the same level as you.
---
not being big headed or anything, found out the hard way,and automatics suck when their in the air.
---
Honestly if you get to that point just make a new character. Surely that is far more enjoyable than grinding for gear. When I see people with characters in the 2 or 3 hundreds it confuses me a bit.
---
Yup my gatling shots end up somewhere up and left consistently. But only from hip fire, ADS is fine.
---
sometimes it's a ghoul and not the wendigo that spawns there so you should be able to server hop and the wendigo will apear depending on you're level
---
No the only one that breaks is the sledge hammer and it‚Äôs the special one or whatever it‚Äôs only breaks on the ghouls all my others they never break I‚Äôve got all the special perks but if for some reason breaks quickly it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs made out of bamboo or something. And it seems to work best on the honeybees and the girls and even death claws
---
But anyway thanks for the advice I have a good night and sorry for being a jerk earlier
---
Neat!
---
I made this one:
---
https://youtu.be/ua68S49EVmA
---
This will seem laborious but it's actually fairly quick: Lucky Hole mine for lead. Just go down near the first junction and theres 4-5 lead nodes on the right (you can find much more down there but this is just my quick run). Make sure your wearing Excavator. Steel scrap is everywhere but there are also plenty of nodes around (near Flatwoods, Sutton, Air Purifier 3). Down by Silva Homestead there are 3 bags of chlorine, and a few coolant bottles in the big metal shed. There's your acid for smelting ore and turning cloth into gunpowder. And the lead weights everybody knows about. With bandolier for ammo weight and ammosmith, I actually end up having to drop ores because I have so much ammo already. But you're not wrong. The handmade eats tons of ammo, which is why I make a habit of going after super mutants for their steel scrap from weapons, gunpowder, and screws.
---
But anyway maybe I‚Äôll see you online and you can give me some advice then but sorry for being a jerk earlier and you have a good night
---
Unplugging and replugging your console. Aka power cycle to stop crashing in specific areas. Thanks to another helpful redditor for that. It worked for me.
---
Nothing is going to waste. Sentinels is still going to be amazing, especially coupled with Assassin's in concept. This suggestion keeps the strong strong but gives the weak ones a but more of a fighting chance. This game currently functions in a "rich get richer" concept in which those who have these unbelievably overpowered sets can combat each other "fairly" but demolish anyone else who isnt running an identical set. 
---
I run similar op sets because that's just what's unbelievably good. It gets boring when everyone does the same thing or you just steamroll, I just want to add some spice to trading, PvP Meta, and PvE
---
Cheers, ill give that a go.
---
Ahh is this the equivalent of leaving a bag of poo on the door step? Really?
---
Yes.
---
There already is spice though. I only use my tank set for things like the sasquatch, I mainly run a mixed armor set with fall damage reduction, weight reduction perks, and deep pockets. I dont always need that huge damage boost, hardly ever in fact. When I do though why shouldn't I have it with like 500+ hours in?
---
Changed mine after Fasnacht.
---
Well done.  Gotta show the cancerbats who's boss around here.
---
Hell yeah do you know what it‚Äôs worth ?
---
I honestly love this bug. I live in the Ash Heap and [by Mothman it's beautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/bbwk6t/winter_in_the_ash_heap/).
---
saw him once as a low level and he kicked my ass, had to cower in a trailer for 30 mins till he got bored. Good grief, haven‚Äôt seen him since
---
I would say it's one of the most ineffective weapons in game for melee.
---
If I didn‚Äôt say it sorry for lashing out tonight. RL I just had one of those lash out moments and it‚Äôs better I do it here than w patients in 5 hours. So sorry.
---
When they're on the ground melee saves a lot of ammo.
---
I'm a rifle/shotgun fighter myself, but a SB on the ground?  Pull out the ski sword.
---
Go into your audio settings  for some reason it's glitched and you're going to need to turn up the volume. This happens to me fairly regularly. This is an in-game setting.
---
Sorry for lashing out. But it was better than doing it with real patients in 5 hours.  Just felt like being a ja for no reason.  So sorry.  RL sometimes pushes us.
---
Oh I certainly am. 
---
The question is - would *you* be interested in doing some 2D Art work for Project Arroyo? You may have heard about us - we are re-creating Fallout 2 on Fallout 4 and we're in need of all sorts of people, including 2D Artists.
---
Not really but I'd take a wild guess at not a lot, they're quite easy to come by and robot isn't the most popular of armor.
---
Theres some cool updates just around the corner. Be sure to read the roadmap. Theres quests on the corkboards at train stations youll want to read. The burrows in harpers ferry is new, youll want to go in and pick up the holotape off the brotherhood of steel soldier.
---
Player vending on 7th!
---
I just play to unlock all the clothes and do events. Build new stuff. I never replay any content or events until i do something else first because that‚Äôs when it feels like work. Mix it up and just explore and shoot stuff.
---
I thought there was one?
---
Bingo.  And thanks.
---
Good job on killing it, great feeling when it finally goes down!
---
But bear in mind you're +17 levels above it - should've been a walk in the park!
---
Upgrade your weapons, as mentioned, and don't use things like combat shotgun from distance like that.
---
Look into the perk to increase accuracy on particular limbs in VATS.
---
Go for headshots with a black powder rifle/pistol and it'll be dead in no time.
---
If I sneak attack a SB with a black powder pistol which does increase damage when enemies are on full health, I usually get it down to about half health with a headshot with one shot - and that was when I was about level 40'ish.
---
*Loading... please wait. *
---
You can have your cake and eat it too, this isn't really neutering existing builds. Just trying to bring less "optimal" ones up.
---
I've had them drop at every event too.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs bugged or intentionally held out. Maybe gonna come out when beer keg does?
---
&gt; have done since is move my c.a.m.p. redesign my house and scavenge for food and scrap to modify or build guns and armor with. I find the game quite pleasant. Especially when I am on a server with loads of high level pl
---
ive managed you just need to put in all those hours
---
Cool thanks man much love
---
Yeah, I loved it too!
---
Now show us a picture with the civil war era clothes on!
---
Great work!
---
What fun do you get dropping items fron your own inventory and making up stories about it on reddit? Did you use to write fanfic on Tumblr?
---
Ahhh, you Just brought so many good idea's to me thx to this post / build
---
Bear traps hooked up to car batteries when? We need justice for OP.
---
Don't know about favourite but my most stand out character is still rocking the party hat and glasses at level 120.
---
they get quite miffed when allrise  appears as well.point is tho,your rifle/shotgun, so you must have noticed the difference if their armour piercing.
---
a 308 or 50 sniper rifle can blow 10-15% off a scorched beast per round. judge the shot, and your hit ratio is  almost 100%. once it lands- hammer it. personaly i switch to shot gun,  but case in point:-
---
level 35 gauss = slap damage............level 45 gauss...........more slap damage.bought the plans and scrapped and scrapped until the piercing capacitors turned up. Jings crivens help ma boab,  thats better.
---
every weapon capable of anti armour,should be just that.
---
cheers
---
I agree they should put more permanent challenges but daily/weekly is about right else it just becomes a rushed atom grind. They should have upped the permanent ones when they add new content.
---
House cats will wander the road in the Ash Head just east of Charleston
---
Play in a server without your camp or move camp to a less popular spot.
---
Yesss! Thanks for that!
---
lol, just got an alpha deathclaw AND a lemonade stand right beside fissure prime xD
---
The thing is that on PS4 your photos are stored (in the PS4 album) even if you delete them from the FO76 album.  So it's not a question of "space", it's just slots in a fixed size data structure.
---
More stellar programming from Bethesda.
---
Sounds complicated.  On PS4 you can find all the photos in your PS4 photo album, even if you delete them from FO76.
---
That would be unlikely as the HMAR already occupies the same niche. It would be much more likely to be released as a skin for the HMAR.
---
Throwing a guess out.
---
When you stand near an object you pull the gun in. The gun is actually shooting where it would be pointing in that anim despite not doing so visually
---
I broke into people's houses just to take a photo of them and then leave like a shadow.
---
That's just easy mode
---
You can only get the heating coil for the super sledge, that‚Äôs it.
---
You forgot to add in that creepy 'member' like your part of the god damn Illuminati
---
I'm level 43 and recently this guy I don't know at all friended me, asked to team up, fast travelled to my camp and then the most amazing things started happening without him saying a word. A picnic table appears in my mostly empty outside deck. A decon arch appears in my doorway area. He gestures for me to put my power armor in my stand and he adds a torso mod to it. He offers to trade, and after my several fumbled attempts (I've never traded before), he totally gifts me a tse lever action. I have him 50 stims, which is nothing, but it was all I could offer in return. I'm still completely stunned by all this, and still feeling guilty that I can't repay him in a meaningful way. Definitely going to pay it forward someday, though.
---
Do Enclave Events If you miss him.
---
Me and three friends nuked Whitesprings, and farmed the enemies up until the event ended - i didn't gain any armor pieces worth keeping by a long shot, and the weapons were very lame too
---
Oh yes, always use armor piercing mags on rifles.  I'm lucky that I got a quad hunting rifle so the normally tiny perforating magazine gives me 20 rounds!
---
Damn allready got that ...
---
Excavator has a bug that gives you an extra 100 carry weight if you log in wearing it that goes away if you die or climb out your armor. Relog and it'll come back. It's also one of those glitches most people don't want getting attention üòâ
---
Dying to gain an advantage? Clearly an exploit lol.
---
There‚Äôs a unique super sledge called All Rise you get from a quest in Watoga if you haven‚Äôt already done it.
---
Scout armor needs legendaries!
---
I really really hope the legendary vendor can help with that.  But I'm sure I'm going to be disappointed.
---
You need to add all the update.ba2 files to your Fallout76Custom.ini file so it looks something like this:
---
\[Archive\]
---
sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 02UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 03UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 04UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 02UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 03UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 04UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 02UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 03UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 04UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - MeshesExtra.ba2, SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba2
---
You'll also need to check the data folder every patch to see if they added more update files and add those to the line.
---
go do 'mayor for a day quest'. starts in wotoga.gets you allrise, which is a rather nice s/sledge at 90% wieght.
---
I dont doubt that but i dont do PvP, thanks :P
---
It's nice to see everyone supporting you and congrats but in FO76 things get really easy when you level up. Another 20 levels and they'll be a piece of cake.
---
That's actually amazing. I'm very impressed. I wish there was a way we could save face presets like that.
---
The Enclave is the rightful government of the US so, yes, of course.
---
Hey if you need to talk and vent pm me!
---
Oh that's fucked,  I love it!  I know what I'm doing to my brother now
---
my gauss is now the same.now if i could just get the rate of fire up, oh that would so nice.
---
Can‚Äôt comment on AAE but TSE gauss and rifleman build is fearsome. 80 crowned scorched beast in 3 shots. And VATS picks targets I can not even see in the distance and then take out in shot - often multiples as I switch VATS targets. It‚Äôs primed and the damage increase is a lot higher than the standard capacitors. Normally running at 600- 800 damage depending on health etc. Coupled with sneak etc you can see it packs a big blow.
---
That pink color is what loads when an object is missing it's associated texture files. Make sure to remove your Fallout76.ini files in your documents folder. After doing so, the next game boot up should create the current files there.
---
Those configuration files contain lines that tell the game which .ba2 archives to load for the game. This is useful information if you decide to mod the game. The game has received several updates to these files since launch, which added separate archives for the atom shop.  You are possibly loading the originals.
---
I would of let them have it.  After all,  their mom did drink all their food money
---
Glad to be of assistance Lmao the poor fool won't know what hit him...
---
I'm kinda done with Whitesprings too for that very reason.
---
\*intense piano music\* So what happened?? Did squeakybeak appear at the last second or..?
---
You have to get the build right for sure
---
The greatest problem with current setting is that player X may initiate open PvP on whole world on a convenient moment, while their trammate Y attacks the owner as soon as the PvP is opened, with the owner being unable to defend themselves and to know when it happens before it already happened. If PvP is to remain on adventure servers, first step is to only have it opened for people within the workshop area, with similar "exiting the event" mechanics to avoid people shooting from inside the area and reloading outside. The second step is to make it a proper event - or maybe a two events - that would begin once the workshop is contested. If I ever PvP in adventure, its that discord buddies summoned me from survival to defend them from assault. I'd love two events being triggered once the workshop is contested - one for the attackers and those who want to kick some ass, and one for the people that want to defend the owner, and to kick some rude ass.
---
Its a commitment. You have to play around in there for a while...and die a lot....to get a feel for whats going on. Stash ur stuff, and prepare to lose some caps. 
---
Theres a few different play styles people use and its evolving.
---
But dont get discouraged. Everyone runs into someone now and then that can just tank everything you have.....and destroy you.
---
As Dobna got closer he/she dissapeared off the map. Moments later so did PVPGod. Wish I'd been there to see it.
---
I mean I was getting kills, but between the lag, glitches, and disappearing players I thought I just played a ps2 game.
---
What a dissapointment ass/cav armor and perks are. Literally does nothing at all.
---
A quick search on here would have told you that.
---
Used to emerge out of a storm of TSE bullets with this combo back in the day, it was the only way to defeat the sacred evil of the wasteland. Now all you need is a dense chest, fireproof is just overkill at this point tbh since TSE is nerfed to the ground I‚Äôve not been killed by a TSE shotgun in ages.
---
We talked about this a lot yesterday. Here's what my idea was:   [Workshop Ideas](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bjhjbq/if_you_want_the_workshop_fine/em8r447/?context=3)
---
For keeping PVP in AM: 
---
"I think the answer is as simple as a prompt asking you whether you want to give up the workshop, or defend it against another player.
---
Choose to give it up, the new owner takes your place.
---
Choose to defend it and PVP begins... maybe an event should spawn which will invite the server to participate the same way you can when defending against enemies. People joining the event can either choose to be defender or attacker... you show up, click on the workbench, choose either. Upon successful completion you get the normal event rewards for defending or taking a workshop, while the person who claimed or contested keeps ownership."
---
For eliminating PVP in workshops:
---
"Maybe a mechanic could be introduced to solve that issue though. Something like scaling the difficulty of defense to be harder and harder each time, until it would be impossible to defend without help, which could lead to a person losing the shop. Then introduce a cool-down timer so that person cannot just reclaim it to start again at the lowest difficulty. If you don't share resources, you probably won't get help defending it. Share your shit and people will go out of there way to help you keep it. Or maybe they just stand there and watch you die, only to claim it themselves."
---
Goddamn, I can't even get anything to go in mine.
---
That wired roofing is a very genius idea :D Actually looks really nice
---
Its playstyle man, you give up weight reductions for sentinal or cav. It depends on what is important to the player. That is why the system works how it is now, you can make a godly build if you go in 100% on what you are doing and forfeit everything else.
---
Pink and rainbow paint, maybe vault tech. I'm talking something less...cartoonish?
---
It makes a huge difference lol just sounds like you don't know how to use it to me.
---
Try shooting col. Gutsy's combat rifle arm (middle, IIRC). It is easy to break and forces it to swap to either a laser pointer or the buzz blade. Don't worry about its thruster.
---
I had a cat that peed on my pillow once. I am not sure which is worst.
---
Just ignores ballistic bro... hopefully fixed soon
---
Yup, in the little museum :)
---
I was just in a sprint wearing full ass/cav bos and marine armor. I got dropped in about 2 or 3 shots from &gt; 50 yards away by an aae automatic combat rifle. I was dead withing less than half a second of being attacked. Would have made no difference if I was wearing no armor at all. Thats pretty bad tbh.
---
Try my [damage calculator](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) and compare settings. With no buff, the level 40 does 18.7% less damage than the level 50 does, but the level 40 has 15.3% higher DPS

Try toggling voice chat mute on other players.

Bethesda teased that exact drink then didn't release it.....
---
wired roof is cool as heck.
---
I use discord on my phone and stopped alt tabbing to fix it :p lawl :(
---
Storage companies hate this guy. They want to keep this simple method secret.
---
Headshot crits override armour and legendary effects, cavalier i'm really not a fan off, Sentinal on the other hand is better.
---
I feel like this is an exaggeration i rarely die to one shot with zero mitigation perks, and i'm not even rocking Assassin's armour or serendipity
---
Well I've been in the game since December so I'm not low level but if you need someone to run around and help you level up just let me know!
---
You can add a Tesla Trap close to the chair, linked to a switch, and voil√†. Not the most elegant solution, but it's a workaround.
---
Well played, stranger. Well played.
---
Yo, for what it's worth, I agree with you about the raiders needing to rise up and content needing to change.  Every time I come across a "raider camp" location on the map, it makes me sad to see it full of scorched instead.  We need players to roleplay both sides.
---
Not an exaggeration at all. And yes I had serendipity and fireproof on too. Dead as if I were naked.
---
wow, I don't even know how you figured that out, but thank you very much!
---
I'd like to know this as well. I did Queen of the hunt maybe 3 times before I just stopped showing up. I have tried server hopping but to be honest I only do it 2 or 3 times before I decide to go do something else. If someone were to tell me honestly that if I server hopped it bunch more it would eventually show up I give it a shot
---
It's an Atom shop item you can claim for free :)
---
I use junk shield...  i do dump my good junk at camp, but yeah...  I need my bag because thats part of my armor...
---
No longer available. Just gave this away yesterday.
---
Can you please specify what the bug does?
---
On PC the thing I see the most is the "Magic Suitcase" in the Watoga Train Station near the vendor. About one out of three times I'll find some sort of gift left in that suitcase. Multiple 1\* legendaries / plans / stable flux / chems / bulk junk galore. You name it I've found it in that suitcase.
---
I always put my known plans and 1-2\*s in there myself just to keep the magic happening.
---
No longer available. Gave it away.
---
You have to admit, that's pretty funny.  Gives me an idea.
---
That's fairly mild, when you think about how some get their kicks destroying camps.
---
not relevent,but related.just when i see dogthatkills. came across this last night,and 1s later,supermutant hammering the cows.put him down but never noticed his hound munching away at them.coo's are now down below half health.took 2min to get the crook cause the cows would knock me away from the gutsy.first tinkle,and their away (hope they know where thier going,cos i aint figuered that out yet).pack of dogs turn up at kill all the cows in 1s. 2min before all this,just taken out a bear and a deathclaw together,both high level,and , they were easier than the fecking dogs......bummer.
---
Want a better 76.
---
Would advice you to wait for the vendor machine, prices will definitely drop for some of the better gear.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bjppzf/sentinel_and_cavalier_lets_talk/
---
At least they have acknowledged the fact that there is a problem with loot in this game.
---
The 'Legendary Vendor' is supposed to be the dev's answer to this problem.
---
We shall see.
---
Said that the SBQ fight is a net loss. The only saving grace is that the adds can spawn as legendary, otherwise is just marginally better than tossing those resources into a river rather than at her.
---
Because it is from the atom store. Anything bought from the atom store cannot be looted by another player. They can only pick up regular stuff
---
I deleted a fully modded set of X-01 power armor on accident once. I was tired and in a hurry it had the camo paint job. it asked me if I wanted to discard it even but I didnt register what I was reading till I pushed the accept button..
---
I think it has more as there are a lot of new variables that are introduced by other players. I have characters at lvl 185, 64, 56, 14 and a newly made I think is still in the singles. By doing different builds and playing the first completely solo until his 150s and teaming with the others I have had completely different experiences.
---
It's a little sad that the factions were all lined up to be joined one after the other rather than choosen between. That makes the total story quite the same quest-wise for all characters, but the playing experience has a ton of difference for me.
---
*Three friends and I.
---
jesus christ. Just when you think all is well lol
---
Don‚Äôt play survival, problem solved üòÇ
---
It's all about min-maxing. The legendary effects are balanced to help players combat bullet sponges. Players only get up to ~350hp as opposed to 5000+. This is why PVP combat is so fast by comparison. 
---
I'm not evening going to talk about critical VATS shots.
---
If you want to survive while running, you need dodgy, serendipity and the rest to be able to withstand more than a couple hits. It is important to note that you cannot return fire while sprinting and suffer a stagger when coming to a stop.
---
You're missing the important part.
---
They never took the workshop for themselves. They used it as a way to circumvent the slap mechanic and kill me across the map. It was a manipulation of the games systems to grief another player.

---
Currently you cannot stealth attack enemies that are fighting other enemies. So if you come up on  group of super mutants fighting scorched, you can only do normal damage. It will show the full stealth damage but then immediately heals all but the non sneak damage. 3.75 x less effective.
---
Yeah, I wonder.. Part of me is wondering if the Keg is in the game as well. As it appears in your C.A.M.P's Misc. Structures section but you need the plan to be able to build it.  
---
I've been hearing rumours that apparently it's already in the game, but I've yet to encounter it.
---
How do you feel about moths?
---
One of the things I've done, and it's especially effective when the person is in their camp, is to note their gamertag then log off. On Xbox you can search for somebody by their username and then join that world. So i search for them and join their world again.  While the game is loading in and everything's laggy I jump into where their house will be and then the walls and stuff will form around me. To them it looks like I'm just walking through their walls right into their building.
---
Did this to a dude like a week ago and I just walked around, used his benches, etc.  He actually got on his power armor and armed a weapon cuz he assumed I was going to destroy things but I have no intentions of doing that. I slept in his bed, walked over to his locked door, and I got on my mic and said it "locks are stupid.  Are you going to open this or do I have to break it down". He then opened the door and I walked away.
---
Yup, possibly just an example used for the Inside the Vault article about brewing... Or it was meant to be in the game but just hasn't appeared... So I honestly don't know.
---
It‚Äôs a good idea.  The way the purifiers work at the moment seems a bit hit and miss
---
Everybody hits a wall right around this quest line. The best thing to do is to keep working on some side quests, do some events, get better gear, and farm some levels at White Springs until till you're strong enough to move ahead in the quest.
---
It won't always be this way though... Once you get through the growing pains of establishing your build, and get to the point of being able to one shot everything, you'll start to wonder if anything can even take you down anymore, and when stronger enemies will be added to the game. 
---
Enjoy these times while they last.
---
Indeed but not enough for 3 scorchbeasts lol, yesterday i was in camp changing something and they arrived...i'm just 60 and not so geared i had to disconnect OMG, that was funny anyway :D
---
I have very High hopes for the legendary vendor, but i just have this feeling that it‚Äôs not gonna work how we think it is. And it‚Äôll be underwhelming, but we will see, yes. As for the SBQ, if you‚Äôre farming her for the flux or the improved repair kits, it can be worth it.
---
Love it!!
---
It's not great.
---
So basically, defense relies on perks, not armor?
---
Fun fact: you can reload a weapon quicker and more reliably by swapping to another weapon on your wheel and the right back. You will have to watch the changing animations, but it is usually faster than the reload animation.
---
That was...lol :D
---
this looks like a rather naff silly easy quest.NOT SO. only had it twice.1st.got the cows all the way to the farm below top of world,unhurt.
---
bear popped out of nowhere and took my head off, first wipe...failed.
---
this wee quest now has my utmost respect.  cheers
---
I was hoping survival was going to be what extended the end game, but from what I just saw its a buggy, laggy, unbalanced mess. What a disappointment.
---
I love survival, sucks running into someone who just stomps you due to god tier roles but it happens. I will say I've only had 1 or two experiences like that, most have been fun fights with back and forth play. Finding with everyone being op how you use your environment and team mates counts for alot.
---
If I recall there are 5 or drinks that were data mined that are in game but not available......
---
One of the most memorable experiences to be had in the game. Congrats!
---
I mean I was getting kills too, but it wasnt an enjoyable experience.
---
Holy snit! This just made my morning! Hahaha!
---
Low it :)
---
I have it on my X-01 stealth, but i use the arms from the new war rider, looks kinda cool, lol
---
Ahhh, fair enough. I'm looking forward to whenever they are made available in game.  
---
Just like the Firebreather/Responder P.A paint that was data mined, hopefully that'll be made available at some point as well.
---
Thank you! This brought a tear to me eye, laughing too hard
---
Don't get your hopes up.
---
Quite the workaround ;)
---
 But once wine gets exposed to fresh air it starts to go bad...so how are you still in the  vault?
---
I agree. Except it‚Äôs not a disappointment for me. I knew exactly what it would be before it came out. We all knew PVP from the regular servers. I had no hopes for it whatsoever, and no hype, that it would somehow be anything else. And I didn‚Äôt get disappointed üòÖüëå I‚Äôm glad their focus is more on PVE right now though!
---
Who don‚Äôt ya wait for patch notes like everyone else mate. We don‚Äôt know cause patches like that can‚Äôt be datamined in advance, also Bethesda might just patch it without saying anything like they did with watoga so who knows
---
I might log back in and play in my underwear and kill people with my aae pump just to prove my point/troll lol.
---
I just spent a lot of reaources trading for high end PvP armor so I'm salty. Guess ill dump it all and stick to pve.
---
I've never seen anyone use the suitcase, but my friends and I use the icebox outside the golf club for any donations!
---
They‚Äôve figured out a way to glitch stealth boys to be permanently invisible. They‚Äôre about as invincible as can be. I should know, they‚Äôve kicked me arse a few times.
---
Was your main gripe game performance or mechanics? I have some issues with hit registration and vats performance wise and I think the stacking on stuff like sentinal gets abit ridiculous but overall I way prefer survival to adventure mode.
---
vending machines are going to do that when they are powered
---
My best SBQ drop has been a 1* Junkies Pool Cue!
---
Nice! Make a pic with Fire axe and Civil War era suit and top hat! That would be bomb!
---
Dosent the BOS recon rifle have slightly higher DMG ?
---
Not 100% sure since i have always just used that one, lol
---
Rent free....
---
No worries. I'm far from the point in my life where I can or will get offended by something someone says on the internet. I'm sure we've all looked back at our comments and thought we sounded like jerks before.
---
Both.
---
Performance was really bad. I had an exchange shooting at a guy, then he dissappeared out of nowhere. Then I was killed from behind. In fact, I didnt get in single gun fight. Every kill I had was killing someone from behind, and every death I didnt see coming. 
---
But I'm salty because I just traded my way to a high end set of PvP armor, and its just as durable as no armor at all.
---
I had 2 extremely laggy SBQ fights this week that both caused massive sound glitches until I closed the program manually through the xbox menu.
---
Ever since that change they made to stealth, was it patch 5? 6? Talking from memory here, something to do with PvP, the whole mechanic is 'borked'.
---
The issue you describe is just the latest on a series - which does not make it any less aggravating of course.
---
First you would not be able to regain stealth after entering a 'caution' state unless you server hopped/logged out.
---
They got that one 'fixed' after some time however currently you may go from 'hidden' to 'caution' to 'danger' in a blink for no apparent reason and once it happens you cannot get it to 'work' again unless you log out/server hop.
---
Hopefully the next patch will bring a much needed fix to the mechanic as a whole.
---
That. Is. Hilarious.
---
genuine question and i admit i may be missing something here. I thought ALL containers counted to your max stash ? including the container itself
---
Fantastic, the gouls and mole rat lines in particular üòÇ
---
Eh don't feel bad. I didn't assign perk points until I was level 20 something. My guns feel weaker for some reason.
---
I am not a smart man.
---
Ask somone in here if the can "hold" the dead body for you on your platform, i got the cam on 4 different characters in under 20 min's :)

Best gun a AAE 50 cal. I feel for you man :(

Haha that....stinks üòÇ

Yes. Looks like hitscan weapons using projectile mechanics (for cheap tracers calculation i presume).

Seriously rein in those high hopes chap. Better to be pleasantly surprised than gutted....again.

Do you mean the turret‚Äôs budget cost or the camp‚Äôs?
---
I live with my house integrated into the waterfall near the crashed airplane. I love it there! Its my favorite region design wise. The lighting is incredible and the trees are stunning. The only downside is the only vendor is by Harper's Ferry.
---
Seen it as well.  A Mr. Gutsy that acted like a Robobrain.
---
All containers labelled "stash" are essentially a portal to the same box. So yes, OP is le meme'ing

Go play FO4 !!
---
Moving, especially in reverse, while attempting a VATS melee hit can make the swing miss. All VATS does is teleport you to the target. If either of you are in motion, it may miss because either actors are no longer  where VATS thought they'd be at the beginning of the attack animation.
---
You can use this to your advantage by adjusting your movement to compensate for theirs, correcting the swing. It is just difficult to perform because of camera change.
---
This doesn't happen with ranged weapons because projectiles will lock onto the target (and are usually instantaneous).
---
Made my day

Headcanon accepted.

Yes! I also had this a few times!

I have the Nukashine paint but with war rider arms, looks awesome on X-01 :)

It‚Äôs a datamined texture file. You know how Santiago tried to blow up our boi? The red skull face is the resulting corruption that occurred
---
We value your appreciation, General.
---
Were you in adventure or survival? If adventure, then this is weird, dude was being an asshole then. If survival...well, dude was playing to get kills and whatever you might have been carrying aid and junk wise. If you can't handle that, then don't go into survival. Or, if you were in adventure, just block for session and go somewhere else
---
This post has suddenly made me want to get 76...
---
So it's a shared persistent universe right?
---
That would be hilarious to see them take hundreds of rads so quickly after they've been greedy
---
thought i'd ask.....ya never know
---
Upvoting because though I haven‚Äôt done SBQ in a while, I‚Äôve received legendary rolling pins and pool cues from legendary bosses.
---
I'll take some off your hands
---
"Not really a criticism or a suggestion"
---
Tag: suggestion. ü§î Hmmm.....
---
In all seriousness, I actually like this idea. Especially with all the brewery stuff they've had going on for the last month or two.
---
You've been ignoring everyone that actually plays pvp saying that your God armor isnt nearly as good as all the scrubs claim, then get mad that it isn't the insta-win that you were promised?
---
Sounds like that's on you dude
---
Items randomly disappearing was a bug they patched a few months ago, and then in the last patch or two patches ago, the bug came back. That's all this is
---
Found the note but just grabbed it and didn't read it.  New quest popped up immediately to "Get the Item in Burrows South."  Of course, I didn't have a clue what "item" I was looking for.  Tried to read the note in my inventory but the "Read" option was disabled.  Tried dropping the note but could only pick it up - "Read" option not available.  Went into the Burrows figuring all would become clear.  Got all the way to the final "Assaultron challenge."  Saw a quest marker on a storage case.  Took everything from the case (including Technical Data which I was already carrying, damn it!).  Didn't notice anything marked as a quest item and most of it was crap, anyway.  Quest immediately disappeared from the queue.  Have no idea what I was supposed to find or picked up.  Worst of all, burnt 400+ rounds of 5.56 mm on the resident ghouls.  :(
---
They also have found an exploit allowing the to double or even triple their special from original values also stacking their perk card values allowing them to fire faster, , trigger dodgy and serendipity more often and buff up their weapon damage making some of them impossible to kill. I‚Äôve been playing this game from the beginning and this was a glitch already patched. Yesterday I had to deal with pretty much all of them and one specifically had health of about 2% I blasted him with my tse laser rifle with 2 full clips getting about 6 Crits in vats with perk cards and was in able to kill him, a full clip of my laser does 3000 damage plus the 40% more damage. I know for a fact I should have killed him I can kill pretty much everyone else on this whole game fairly
---
My kind of shitpost.
---
Well he gave you a chance didn't he?
---
Patchnotes be damned, I want conjecture and hearsay!
---
Personally, rather than how the 'immersive' version of the Legendary Modification mod worked in FO4(*) I think it will be more like a roulette of sorts.
---
You exchange unwanted legendaries for 'chips' - the more 'stars' on the legendary the more 'chips' per exchange - then you use those chips to 'spin the wheel' and re-roll one effect on an already existing legendary item of your choice with the same odds current levelled lists use.
---
Let's say that you have a 'nocturnal/ap regen/weight reduction x' armor piece and you would rather have a more desirable 'prefix'. You use your 'chips' to 'spin the wheel' and re-roll that affix until you get the desired effect.
---
(*) For those not familiar with it one would scrap legendaries and obtain 'chips' that could be used to apply the effect to another item. Different 'effects' had different yields upon scrapping and different requirements in terms of how many 'chips' were needed to apply the effect.
---
I have the same glitch at my camp. I made a speakeasy in mine, under my camp. I recently removed it though because I needed the budget space. It was fun while I had it though üòÅ
---
And I imagine ultracite is just the upgraded form
---
Dayuum! But do you think you have enough stash boxes?
---
Calm down Satan
---
Insta win? No. Better than underwear? Yes.
---
I've been doing bbq more recently, but that's only to get a supply of the repair kits built up.
---
&gt; Faction: Brotherhood of Steal Your Trash
---
welp
---
pack it up lads, we're done here. there is nothing more to be done
---
Odd couple?
---
Just fyi the imposter event also drops them.
---
Also those repair kits have weight.
---
Agreed when it comes to the guaranteed legendary ( 1/2/3 star enemy drops 1/2/3 star item etc) but you can't complain about pool cues and rolling pins. They're part of the loot pool and it's purely based on RNG.
---
Yup just another BETA issue not fixed. Also random issue when launching the game and... nothing launches except your mouse being trapped in a small rectangle with game sound.
---
It can get you "Signs and Letters" xD
---
Let‚Äôs be frank, as someone wi5 20+ pvp characters all geared to the teeth I can confirm that PA is more annoying to verse then other SA users, Sentinal assassin be damned when a good PA build, never gets staggered, takes more crits to be killed and can often kill me before I kill them, the best of which I‚Äôve seen was a VE Gatling plasma PA build, you just couldn‚Äôt kill him, not with any amount of crits
---
What you talking about? I've been out since the beta testing. I'm just saying that we are all vault dwellers at the root and improve from experience. Once the time came, we had to leave and start a new world.
---
Whether it's an alternative way to buy tokens, likely at an unfavorable rate, or a required expenditure along with spending tokens, the game need a use for caps that has lasting demand.
---
Only thing i saw since the 2 last patch is the PA have shitty duration now, before could play a month without repairing my PA, now i repair like twice a week, sound a stealth nerf just in time for the repair kit...
---
Rekt
---
I actually saw a guy had made a huge wall with stash boxes near the scorchbeast Queen that had "Thailand rules" on it written in dog and Kitty paintings
---
I was very impressed
---
You‚Äôre in survival as a level 4, taking on a 194 level player that most likely has all 2-3 star legendary gear. He was camping a spawn spot sure, but to play devils advocate, you did shoot first. It looked like he gave you a chance to leave. Just don‚Äôt engage until you‚Äôre ready.
---
He‚Äôs level 4
---
Lol I was kicking around a sloth head for like 20 min the other day.
---
Holy shit the funny moments in this game
---
Someone has a lot of free time.
---
This is making me want to rebuild my camp outta steel boxes and wires... Or at the very least my roof
---
I just RP to hit the snooze button open end.
---
Mr Handy Butlers everywhere (Not that it is so different outside.)
---
Jammin' my Guitar, play Nuka Tapper all day long or watch the informative security slide show.
---
No worrys about getting my Camp wrecked... Instead i build a CAMP fortress out of CAMPs in the Atrium
---
As you've all left the vault i always get a nice place in the cafeteria.
---
And by far the best - free pens and party hats as i want.
---
Best reclamation ever!
---
For real thoug, PA does need a buff even if it takes me more hits to kill it then SA users, the biggest buff I think PA needs is more mods, like a really expensive/rare chest mod that is Cav or sent that reduces damage while standing or sprinting by 30% I think that‚Äôd be a great way to make PA viable in pvp in particular, also if Sentinal and Cav don‚Äôt get nerfed I‚Äôm eat my hate, even though I run so many sets with it I still want to see them nerfed if/when they get nerfed, I‚Äôd say 12% a piece from 15% a piece would be decent enough and maybe even drop assassin to 7% from the 8% it‚Äôs on, since Fallout is multiplitvie that‚Äôd give SA users probobly 85%-90% damage reduction (it‚Äôs late I‚Äôm not doing the math, fyi currently a full set of Sentinal (not including assassin) will reduce the damage you take by 62%) which is a a lot fairer then the 95-99% or whatever it is Rn
---
at this point if it is any better then selling to vendors, its a win. Do you have any idea what kind of stash space its going to free up?
---
I think they would be unwise to introduce multiple additional currencies; unless you mean that bronze, silver and the rest are merely  denominations of the same token-based currency.
---
I'm willing to bet Dobna just sits on top of Vault 76.
---
This is genius üòÇ I'm personally a fan of the fetilizer/molotov on the doorstep combo.
---
With mine...probably 700 ish
---
It's a lottery if the SBQ event even works properly. Did it earlier today and no problems. Then later tonight and the f&amp;\^%$ thing crashed straight up.
---
At least I saved most of my ammo. My theory is all servers are not created equal (?)
---
Thank you.
---
Free Range on survival is a nightmare. No matter how quickly you do the event a gank squad will run you over and kill the cows.
---
Really Hope they add functionality to it one of these days.    Watching some poor bastard "ride the lightning" would be hilarious.
---
Here, here! 
---
If we can't get worked up into a raging froth over rumor and gossip, then why are we really here?
---
...and by good people is meant loyal servents that follow any order exactly without question and won't hesitate to kill Americans for a chance to nuke China... again. And be sure not to wear anything red!
---
I dont know what to say. Practice more. It's far better to not be seen than to rely on armor to protect you as you run through open ground expecting not to get lit up by the person that is fully prepared for that kindergarten tactic. 
---
Get some stealth armor and stealth boys. Watch the map and stalk your target a bit. If the #1 player with 30 kills is sitting in one spot, they probably have a kill zone set up. Don't just fast travel to the station he is watching. Go one up a d circle around. 
---
The best way to not get hurt is to not get hit at all- not thinking that your magic armor will absorb everything.
---
Thank u guys so much i found asap an alpha deathclaw near watoga fissure site u spared me a lot of time thx!!!
---
Turret.
---
This usually is the problem
---
if its in a PA suit at a spawn point, it's 25%.  If its on a shelf nearby, then its usually at least 50%, sometimes more.
---
Some of the PA spawn points, may be generators in the same area:
---
&gt;!west gorge bridge - you'll need a key found at another site!&lt;
---
&gt;!camden park (up to 5 here if you do the challenge), !&lt;
---
&gt;!2 suits at wade airport.!&lt;
---
&gt;!one in toxic valley!&lt;
---
&gt;!2 in the ash heap (across the street from each other)!&lt;
---
&gt;!mining building in charleston!&lt;
---
&gt;!WV lumber!&lt;
---
&gt;!Garitty HQ!&lt;
---
&gt;! the arena near the 'vendor area' behind top of the world!&lt;
---
&gt;!pharma chems (up to 4 here)!&lt;
---
&gt;!nuka cola plant (up to 3 here)!&lt;
---
&gt;!son of dane compound!&lt;
---
&gt;!grafton dam (1-2 here)!&lt;
---
&gt;!near mama dolce (generator)!&lt;
---
&gt;!outside the mine near WS station!&lt;
---
&gt;!on the table next to the core processor at posiedon!&lt;
---
&gt;!widows perch!&lt;
---
just when you think you got it, there's ALWAYS something to getcha.
---
I could give you some plans and possibly a set of excavator power armor my GT is Firewhisker
---
I'm often dropping known plans and crap near folks to offer up, and previously I'd use the "come here" emote, and then shoot at the brown bag on the ground. Which, nothing convey a generous spirit like a guy firing a rifle into the earth. 
---
This is a really nice addition.
---
Is this fully confirmed as going to be implemented? And is it going to be map wide or nearby vicinity?
---
I gotta be way over that. I now run weapon and aid weight reduction gear, bear arms, bandolier, a few more cards, carry all my guns,food,aid, and store minimal junk. I have gone through everything I'm not using and modded for minimum weight. They need to go before I just wait for an event and drop the lot.
---
It wasn't me, I leave the IOU Toilet Paper note with Fertilizer.
---
I only do this on Camps that are locked up, if I can find a way in, and I will sometimes go back later and leave the Toilet paper.
---
It's just for fun, I never break anything, unless it's a Turret base destroying everyone else's spawns like the ones at WS Golf Club, for those I leave nothing but foundations.
---
None of that really changes the facts. You can say it is bad tactics or whatever, but if ass/cav bos armor doesnt do anything, what is the point of wearing armor at all? What is the point of looting or doing anything in the game then?
---
&gt;sports bees
---
What does this mean? No quests but there are more heads unlocked than what was known? Which? How?
---
Same lol! I'm waiting for the damn vendor! üòÇ

I lock my doors but I have an open garage type area with accessible workbenches, food, water, a stash and a cooking station so if someone stumbles across my camp they have resources. I want to help people out because I get the concept of the game however just yesterday some a-hole decided to come and try and wreck it all. He got up to a bounty of 25 caps before we were able to travel back and take him out. When he respawned he wouldn't leave me alone so I blocked him and left the server. Go to Survival, dickhead.
---
I think we might see the good rolls being very, very rare. I just hope the limitation is a small caps fee, and not "max 10 rolls each day". I'm really looking forward to the legendary vendor too, but I keep the door open for disappointment.
---
Found my Supply Requisition had dropped directly on top of the corpse of the Mothman I had just shot - making the Mothman's loot inaccessible, of course.  But . . . I did get a Dirty Water and a Golf Tee in the Supply drop.
---
Suppose they changed it so that you got three stars worth of stuff? Such as three 1 star items. Or a 1 star and a 2 star item. Or a 3 star item.
---
I started an event last night, and a scorchbeast flew up literally just as I whacked the first cow. Needless to say, cows aren't very resistant to SB sonic attacks.
---
Thank you so much for posting this. Now I will actively search out other people's camps and do this.
---
I would kill to see that oml
---
I carry all the ammo/meds/food/drink on me.  Just checked my stash...if I empty it completely and just put the legendary stuff back in it‚Äôs up to 756. Doesn‚Äôt leave much wriggle room for scrapüòÇ
---
I have gotten 2 from that random quest you aqquire in the taxidermy place. I dont know how many is obtainable from them but
---
They've said too many camps close together cause performance issues. I don't see that ever changing. Cool idea, but it's been suggested 200 times already and the answer is always technical limitations.
---
Aquaboy. You don‚Äôt take radiation from water and you can‚Äôt drown. Another is ghoulish which is you heal from radiation
---
A prompt on login would mean logging back in order to change your mind. But a setting or as another comment pointed out the vending machines doing it, would mean that they're able to change it on the fly.
---
This will make a nice family christmas card this year!
---
Congrats!
---
I bet you're loads of fun at parties.
---
I had one episode where I "placed" my Excavator Armour but it never showed up.  I'm looking around frantically for it . . . nothing.  Then I just happen to look straight up in the air and there it was about 10' off the ground.  I had to jump and hit "Enter" to get into the suit which promptly crashed to the ground with me inside.
---
I try to donate stuff to this one at least once a day.  Mostly plans, ammo, and magazines.
---
The blue suitcase in the Top of the World train station is also a spot I've seen people use.

Travel agent, makes fast traveling cheaper
---
The taxidermist's office ones have been known since that quest came out. So are they new or what? If it's the wolf, bear, wendigo, or owlet they're old.
---
r/accidentalsacredgeometry
---
No
---
Hard Bargain, Super Duper, Weapons Artisan, White Knight and Fix it Good. These are cards to switch on and off from but you benefit greatly in having them rank 3.
---
Fair enough. And I guess red rockets aren't always safe either, so if you're on your last leg? It might not be a real option.
---
Nope.  Camps at the Wendigo cave..
---
Pacify with perks, then tame?
---
I am going to start doing this now. lol
---
No perks it will only be at your base probably a retexture of the brahim the cat will wonder your base
---
Bot really useful in the future. As long as you own a few workshops you can travel anywhere for pretty low plus even if you needed to spend 50 caps it isnt that much if you trade with vendors.
---
Yes but I want one at my base
---
Ghoulish wouldnt be good for a bloodied build. You're power depends on how low health you are and if you're constantly getting healed then that isnt the best perk.
---
I just keep 2 bulk of everything except ammo and gun parts. I'm at max caps now too so I dont even need much room for junk. Im even getting myself away from having 300+dilluted stimpaks, and down to 4 ammo types. I was pretty upset player vending got set back. It will be so nice not to slowly loose damage card flipping while on loot runs.
---
There will never be a shooter/mmo/online game that is balanced . In that case they have to rework everything every week when someone finds a new  op build.  Im pretty sure ppl who run full sent/cav and have good guns have enough gametime to earn to be better built than someone who just started. I have a heavenly arsenal of guns &amp; armor .
---
But i also have played a little under 1000h !
---
Whenever you're scrapping items deliberately to get mods, I'd suggest checking what's available against a list. I use the one compiled by /u/jchamlin. Their thread with linked resources is here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout\_76\_all\_plans\_recipes\_weapons\_weapon\_mods/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/)
---
Because it'll let you get an easy kill from some noob who just traded up for "god roll" PvP armor, and thinks it makes them invincible.
---
Bloody Mess hands down.
---
That depends on what you're doing. For crafting SuperDuper is always good. Having a chance to produce more than one item is great. A card that gets overlooked is Contractor, cost half as much to fix and craft items. I think Serendipity works well no matter the build. Green thumb so you can 2 of every item you pick. Starched Genes because having certain mutations is helpful. 
---
RC
---
The cycle continues!
---
Pharma farma is a pretty good perk if you find yourself or your friends running low on any types of chem. Level 3 is pretty good but I keep it at 2 in order to save on perk space.
---
Are you gonna grab the civil war clothes?
---
How's the no oxygen going? This awesome time is going to get real hard to breathe in soon enough. ;3
---
Not that it matters but I fought the Queen last night and got a 3 star hand made.  It was explosive, 30% damage to animals and some kind of slower vats bonus.
---
 Not the greatest weapon but it will trade in well with the legendary vendor.
---
 That being said it is one of the only 3 stars I've gotten from the Queen in many many attempts.
---
Definitely
---
Starched genes
---
Yah, I had a level 50 one star bloody pole hook forever. Bought myself a three star level 40 version and that's what I'm running with now. 
---
My general rule is that melee doesn't need to be max level but guns kinda do.
---
I have way to many PA skins and not enough Frames to show them off
---
 Sounds like a great idea. Super helpful to the lower levels trying to get a foothold. Being a lone wolf with a team of zero it‚Äôs Funny I‚Äôm even recommending it ... the thought of people lining the streets if a town with their camps to create a community pooling resources and trading sounds interesting. It‚Äôs disappointing that every day I‚Äôm dropping spoiled food. 
---
But then again I‚Äôve been trolled and pvp‚Äôd one too many times to camp outside of the woods. 
---
I had thought about spending a night crafting a bunch of lvl 10 silenced pipe pistols and handing them out around ‚Äò76 but at this point most of the low level people are likely starting a second or third character and not new to the game.
---
7 out of 9 SBQ battles in one evening rewarded me with 1\* Wood Armor, and I've gotten Drills off the Queen more times than I have fingers.
---
I'm not sure why because I seem to have really good RNG luck with other events, but I seldom ever get weapons from the SBQ, and haven't gotten a plan I didn't already know in several weeks.
---
SBQ battles, and SBs in general should provide better rewards based on the damage done, Ultracite Ammo is expensive to make, and I go through about 2000 of each, 50 Cal, &amp; 308 at each Scorched Earth Event.
---
Thanos is End game
---
Ive never had a bad time at a party, not sure how it relates to pointing out obvious bs on reddit
---
I sometimes gather up materials at my camp too make really really heavily modded level 5-25 weapons with customs names and drop them to low levels when I‚Äôm bored.
---
But it does take a lot more time and effort then just crafting level 15 energy rifles or something :/
---
Its always been like that for me. Since the game came out. Tricentennial is on the xo1
---
I applaud your dedication. The pictures are outstanding!
---
Great. Those annoying popups in-game that direct you to the Atom Store have infected the Reddit sub as well...
---
It seems the purifiers don‚Äôt produce consistently anyway so that could help not run up to 3 full ones and 2 empty and just snag em all at once
---
Yes! I would love that! All from small containers to big water Towers! Awsome
---
Ease up grumpy, somebody gave you a break once..
---
There's only one learnable mod for the Super Sledge, Heating Coils. You probably already know it. Always check against my spreadsheet when scrapping to make sure you have mods left to learn.

---
Nice  but I iaven't seen anything that beats the blackbird paint
---
When you contest an owned workshop the first thing that happens is the current owner's "flag" lowers down to 0, this part is in game already.
---
While this happens Pvp doesn't start yet, it just kicks the owner out of build mode and gives them 15 seconds to prepare or gtfo, they can kill the attacker early and stop this via normal pvp mechanics of challenge and accept.
---
After the flag reaches zero an event "battle for \[name-workshop-place-name\]", this would be a pvp event, all players in range of the event would be entered into it, and whoever is in the workshop zone builds progress as long as they are the only one in the zone, when all players are outside the workshop it reverts to the old owner by default. eventually either someone wins the event, or it fails and the owner regains control, unless there is a huge slugfest 4v4 or other insane fight for a workshop it won't last very long, and if there is that's the point right.
---
Only players who enter the evet get put in pvp mode, and receive the entering event warning when approaching. The owner has to stick around or come over to take part in the event to be killable, and won't be made vulnerable anywhere on the map for the rest of their life. The attacker has to stick around and commit for the first 15 seconds before they get the chance to kill someone.
---
Bringing down the vibes on a good yarn.
---
Finally someone else!!! Thought I was going crazy hearing new noises!
---
fair enough. 
---
I'm a melee build, so only give a few perk points to rifle - anti-armor and the 10% dmg bonus for training.
---
Given that, based on my experience so far, best all around for me has been an Executioners combat rifle.  
---
It won't one shot anything outside the Forest, but it still  deals more damage than the handmades I've looted.
---
Because its semi, muzzle climb is easier to control for faster follow on hits.
---
I'm pretty sure there's a variant for vampire, which would run a close 2nd if I had it.
---
Ok , i have been away for a month. Then i guess they are not any new ones
---
Quit to Desktop button is end game.
---
Survival mode does limit fast travel options compared to Adventure. I'm sure that will be tweaked further.
---
Adrenalin
---
So underrated, lol
---
Rank 5, stacks to +60% damage (10% per kill) lasts for 30s
---
Kills refresh it
---
I've always heard good stories like this unfortunately I've never found any dropped bag with good loot in it.
---
Not invisible. Just a noticable difference from underwear would be nice.
---
If I'm in power armor I want to dual wield anything except big guns.
---
[deleted]
---
Exactly this.
---
Yes!

---
There's lots of perks that boost damage. Some in nearly every special category.
---
Some mutations boost damage too.
---
That‚Äôs a great idea. Thanks for the tip!
---
My favourite weapon to craft in these places is a heavily modded baseball bat with heating coils, I on't go as far as naming them tho.
---
Armor wise I craft deep pocketed leather legs
---
Thanks, I will definitely be taking this into account!
---
no one can defeat that, not even task manager.
---
bloody mess 
---
glowsight (especially if you melee)
---
good doggy
---
I frequently kill assassin sentinel people, vats headshots usually take em down in a hit or two.
---
For armour I‚Äôm always crafting iron or combat, their pretty darn expensive too be crafting and modifying full sets but it‚Äôs kinda fun. And I love seeing the players run around in their kewl sets of armour that‚Äôs wayyyyy too modded for their level just wrecking everything.
---
Where can I find that rifle?
---
There's no trade glitch or exploit. They probably just want to check out your gear to see if your an easy target.
---
My take on this is that it should be tied to luck. Because the drop of a legendary is by it's nature a luck event. 
---
So if you're rocking 15+ luck, you're basically guaranteed the star level of the mob you're fighting. If you've invested nothing in luck? Well, literally, you're taking your chances.
---
Lol I just want a buddy
---
Strydr, do you have the silo codes?
---
and again....
---
&gt;Not the greatest weapon but it will trade in well with the legendary vendor.
---
It is one of the best things you could get ! For the love of god either keep it and use it or sell it. Trading it with a vendor is going to be painful. 
---
**Hunter's**: Radtoad, Fox, **Scorchbeast, Scorchbeast Queen**, Molerat, Deathclaw, Brahmin, Mirelurks (Crab, Hunter, King, Queen, Spawn), Vicious Dog, Radscorpion, Frog, Radstag, Mutant Hound, Yao Guai, Squirrel, Cat, Wolf, Rabbit, Chicken, Radrat, Megasloth, Beaver, Attack Dog, Opossum, **Sheepsquatch**, Mongrel

With a prime receiver that thing outperforms Anti-Armor Explosive Handmade equipped with a prime receiver. Believe it or not but against the SBQ it's even better than a TSE primed.

If you don't believe me.
---
I've got a tree house in The Mire. I love it there. Most of the time I get level 15 - 25ish mobs attacking. Unless somebody nukes Harper's Ferry...
---
Someone told me that you can put Toxic Goo in the Punch bowl, I haven't tried yet, so I can't confirm, but that would be really rough on a Bloodied build.
---
you have to be out of a particular ingredient/component to track it. You go into the recipe/plan and then highlight a particular ingredient. It will then give you the option to track it (but only if you don't have any unfortunately).
---
They make Gatorhoney.
---
Really nice they gave this. Took me a while to find it in the wheel but a nice touch and proof they listen.
---
I know that spot. Thought about setting up camp there.
---
I only just started playing a couple of weeks ago so not everyone is on secondary characters! (Although I am level 30 already because I've been playing a ton) I play with my fiance and focus heavily on charisma and getting materials for food and crafting because I am not the best at combat. I always have a ton of spoiled food because I produce way more than we need. I would love a way to share all the food I make so that it's not going to waste.
---
... And next, the sheepsquatch!
---
Bwahahaha!
---
I wish we had concrete, Id build a really good looking bunker maybe when private server modding comes we can see all the other building sets as well as multiple camps and infinite budget
---
What happens then
---
That is hilarious. I lock my door only to keep wild animals out
---
Yeah, I figure if add a little flair to my post, makes it a little more interesting them the standard "here's my camp post"
---
I found a 2* bloodied deathclaw gauntlet
---
I forgot about quad ammo. That and fire rate would be dope
---
The Mothman just came to say "Nice C.A.M.P., pity if anything happened to it, if you know what I mean" but you paid no attention so his SQ buddies gave you a demonstration.
---
Yes, I had it happen once when I picked up two of the same key off an Officer like you did. The pop-up messages were very annoying. I think logging out made it stop happening.
---
Happened to me 6esterday but it fixed today
---
Yeah, these don't look as militaryesque as Blackbird which was the selling point for me
---
If people nuke the burrows icon, my house is in the blast zone. If they nuke the Harper's Ferry icon, it's just outside the rad zone.
---
Please, nuke the Harper's Ferry icon. My camp is glitched into the tree I live in and I can't access it. Have to run around repairing everything individually when my house gets bombed.
---
If I remember correctly the quest instructions say you have to defend the terminal.  Only after I did the quest 3 times, dying every time (but the last one dying at exactly the moment I "won") did I find out that you can just hide like a scared bunny.
---
Where is this locked room?
---
I was going to try out that combo last night, but ran out of time.  I definitely will look at it tonight.
---
I don‚Äôt agree with you attacking some one‚Äôs camp just because it is locked but I downvoted you for the workshop bit. I don‚Äôt find it exploitive if I am there and defending the workshop but I do think bethesda needs to fix that people can claim the workshop and then fast travel to me and attack me. They should not be able to fast travel to me to pvp.  Either I decide to fast travel to the workshop to defend it or if they get it then there is no reason they need to attack me. It‚Äôs a bad mechanic and just allows for easy griefing.
---
I play a mainly melee build, with 6 rifleman perks points to help with harder enemies like Scorched Beasts etc.
---
I often find abandoned legendary melee weapons that people turn loose because they mainly love the rifles and shotguns.
---
Just last night in the Whitespring bunker crafting bench area I found a Vampires Cultist dagger in a crate along with some junk and ammo someone dumped.
---
Only 134 base damage but once I over-repair it‚Äôll probably pull 180 or so with my Bloodied build.
---
One persons trash is another‚Äôs treasure, right?
---
Apparently it was confirmed that this will be added with player vending. Can't wait for inside the vault today.
---
I think the explanation you're looking for could be summed up with the word *frogophile*.
---
The armor set you got relies on perks. It also relies on bobbleheads, food, and chems. With just the armor and perks you are only doing 2/5.  Also you were not in your power armor were you? Armor is not applied inside.
---
Max level mobs.
---
I'm a main Gatling gun user and this is infuriating! I've notice this specially on enclosed spaces like silos, it's very random and when it happens I switch to 3rd person view (which I hate tbh as it's not aligned properly) just to kill whatever I need to be killed...
---
Honest question as I haven't been able to play the past few weeks. Can you put the blackbird on any power armour set? And is it still in the atom shop?
---
Always check the register in the crafting area as well. I try to always leave ammo, chems or whatever.
---
They need a cap sink in this game, I hope it's a camp upgrade systwm
---
You can‚Äôt trade any items from the atom shop. If you drop an item with any content from the atomic shop, the item is destroyed.
---
Exactly! I also once found about 1000 cloth scraps. It‚Äôs was a quick bulking and then i sold them to the vendor
---
I am so glad I read that until the end.
---
No.
---
I only find ammo i dont need or spoiled food
---
Or, I have a better understanding of the game mechanics for PvP. I can do 350-400 dmg per hit with my semi-auto handmade. That means, **at minimum**, I'm doing 52+ dmg per hit, without even accounting for the 70% AP between perks and mags. If you're charging me, I guarantee I can fire my 20 rounds before you reach me. If you're naive enough to try it without a stealth boy, my first shot will be a VATS crit headshot, and 2-3rd shot will be as well.
---
If you were only wearing your underwear, you wouldn't have made it to sprint from the get-go.  Stop being dramatic.
---
Thanks, but can I use it to paint the excavator armour for example, or is it unique to a specific type?
---
That is good to hear, thanks
---
Or spawn at vault 76 and run down the hill to the logging camp. So much wood.
---
Honestly, man. You haven't REALLY fought the queen until you've walked into a fissure during the fight. It's a right of passage. 
---
You are now a veteran queen fighter.
---
Thanks, I was hoping that would be the case when I got on today
---
I assumed firecracker drinks were not added into the game when I noticed they where never listed on the daily / weekly free atoms lists (Yeah I forget what the list is called, at work, lol).
---
LMAOOO
---
Part of Survival mode is threat assessment and situational awareness, as well as learning the social conventions that have established themselves among the community. If you find someone who can one-shot you without taking any damage it's either up to you to figure a way around the current problem (high level player geared for PvP camping) or to spawn somewhere else. You can't win every fight anymore: there is always a better player, a crueler griefer, or someone with time and energy on their hands to build a one-shot raider to mess around with people. 
---
Tbh, this camper seemed very polite - they didn't even fire upon you until you shot them first, and gave you a verbal warning after you kept spawning in and starting up PvP matches you couldn't win. I'm sorry that this experience ended your use of this game; but if you choose to return please consider that the chances of this happening in Adventure mode is much much slimmer these days, and you can always bounce back and forth between survival/adventure servers until you gain levels and gear (the PvP game kind of starts at lvl 50, and requires the RNG to be on your side or a heavy investment into being social with trader players for some of their gathered gear
---
Dude, I destroy them with my aae 50 cal
---
thanks i'll do this from now and throw in the occasional corn
---
How many drinks can you put in there?
---
My favorite moment in the trade glitch nonsense was some guy trying to convince me it was true with the line "I'm a doctor, you can trust me".
---
Yeah, right.  Never going to ask him for a medical opinion.
---
It used to happen all the time but now they're usually just full of spoiled stuff. Free fertilizer I guess.
---
Vault 76 - Best and the Brightest
---
If that's true, neither can I.
---
Good Doggy. With it you can basically use dog food as stimpacks and they are very common
---
Haven't seen a lemon either....
---
Oof. My main weapons has this. Hope it's patched
---
I wasnt charging. I was running across and didnt see the guy. I was hoping that bos ass/cav would be enough of an upgrade from underwear that I could survive longer than .5 seconds to seek cover in such a situation.
---
Its not being dramatic. High end armor should have a noticeable improvement over no armor at all. Stop defending that.
---
I actually got Mr. Squeeze this way, on the first try. I would recommend going to the Watoga fissure sight, too, for the Alpha Deathclaw.
---
only 14 instances - you've gotta get 250!
---
I have also modded armor To be lightweight as well. Some combinations of effect and mod can make armor weigh nothing.
---
Honestly the sheepsqautch one really surprised me with how it went. At first i was kinda just skimming through but i started to realize how crazy it was and went back and listened to and reread what i had been missing and really enjoyed the crazy conspiracy story that unfolds, even if i got destroyed at the end.
---
You act like the guy that killed you was just rolling with some ordinary rifle and no perks. Maybe your assassin's cavalier armor is going to show a major difference against some noob with a nothing weapon, but a top-tier weapon in the hands of someone who has perked it correctly and uses VATS crits is like you're wearing nothing. 
---
Crits bypass your armor, and if she wasn't using crits to down you, many setups (auto/explosive) stagger to negate the cavalier effecf. 
---
There are so many ways that the other side can max, you can't just go running in the open and expect ANY armor to save you. They're perked to the gills and exploiting your armor's weaknesses. Gotta come up with a better counter than a reddit complaint.
---
No power armor.
---
Yeah seemed like I got the pop up every time I switched between weapons.
---
I wouldn't exactly call it a fix, but I usually alt-tab till the issue fixes itself. It works best when you fast travel and alt-tab at the loading screen.
---
hi the build your talking about is what im trying to build , iim lvl 120 and have 15 perks to play with .i just wasted perks trying to get what your talking about.  is it possible to tell me what your build [is.so](https://is.so) i dont waste more..since ive been changing im dying faster .thanks i also gave many mutations and play alone
---
The servers *are* regional if you use the default ones, but there is nothing stopping you using out of region servers if you join someone on your friends list.
---
I‚Äôm sure I saw them for sale in the Atomic Shop last night.
---
Assassin Cavalier armor being equal to no armor at all isnt something you should be defending. Thats bad game mechanics.
---
I once dorpped the gun on the floor, and the bag simply dissapeared ))) Does this bug still occurs by the way? Not playing for a while. Plan to return when major DLCs are out.
---
Looks almost exactly like the legion of dawn decal from Anthem XD not a bad thing but still.
---
Always place, never drop. It also helps to read the message telling you that dropping you painted item will destroy it.
---
Not a bug.
---
Look for Gamma Gun Signal Repeaters in shops - it doesn't increase the rad damage, but it does turn the gamma gun automatic and it's very hard for someone not in power armour or a hazmat suit to survive eight gamma bursts to the face
---
you my friend are simply genius

I found a bag full of 800 pounds of scrap before
---
I play on PC but this hits close to home.. I have never been able to hear voice chat despite trying all the fixes people suggest whenever a thread like this comes up..
---
gl with your chat issues.. I hope you can clear them up someday...
---
Damn that's crazy
---
I only lock my extractor, everything else is left open for weary adventurers to use.   I would love to find this kind of present in my house, would make my day.
---
I stopped fighting the queen and my life is 100 times better.
---
For the queen I like my prime bloody explosive gatling laser. 
---
Primed gatling lasers have 1000 shots per core. So take the per hint damage and multiply by a thousand. You're doing 5 digits of damage per core. which is 1 violet flux.
---
You can't beat that with any other weapon...
---
No.  Bethesda use Amazon servers, they have servers in most regions in the world.  By default they will connect you to a server that is "near" you, but people can join other people in servers that are not local to them and maybe you will be connected to a non-local server if your "local" ones are all busy or having problems.
---
("local" and "near" in quotes because if you are in the EU for example "local" means Dublin of Luxembourg).
---
Yeah, makes you a bit paranoid, i often turn around thinking it's something behind me, lol
---
You probably should have put PVP somewhere in your title. As there is a pretty huge bias towards it.
---
What you are asking to do is to remove any of the uniqueness from the legendary effects and make them all cookie cutter boring.
---
Are some "better" than others... sure. Are some more suited for PvP than others... yup. More depends on your playstyle than anything else.  An instigating Gatling gun is pretty worthless. An instigating LA Rifle, on the other hand, is pretty amazing.
---
Junkies: Caps out at 50% bonus damage, 10% per addiction, caps at 5. You have not seen weapons hit in the thousands from a junkie build.
---
Nocturnal: The wording is shit, but it takes nothing away from the base damage of the gun, only adds to it at night. 40% bonus damage for 1/2 the day. Doesnt suffer the the terrible accuracy of 2S either.
---
Bloodied by itself doesn't scale ridiculously high. When combined with Adrenal Reaction, Nerd Rage, etc is where things start to get out of control.
---
Everything has a use, trying to pigeonhole it into a particular playstyle and normalize it all is just boring.
---
What needs to be looked at is the HOW different legendaries/mutations/perks combine and scale together.
---
Update: my buddy found one at whitesprings and messaged me. Lol I wonder where I‚Äôd be right now without him. Probably at wavy Willard‚Äôs getting pissed I imagine
---
This weeks survival weapon might be the worst weapon period ever I dont understand why they even did this the weapon is just garbage I expect better out of a survival challenge
---
ahahhahahahaahh oh man you made my day with that!!!! thank you!
---
Excellent advice. Might have to switch up my bloodied explosive Gatling
---
Ah... nothing an asthmatic couldn't handle

But as i said a breath taking expierience indeed ;)
---
I don't mind people role playing as raiders. Shoot my camp up, go for it. But don't ruin it with banal taunts like 'does your mother know you're using her computer to play?' (I sound like a boy) etc. Ruins the immersion. Say 'the Jet' ll make you jittery ' or something like that
---
Well I will check again tonight just to be certain, but I know that all the ones I have previously claimed were in the shop flagged as Owned, but not the one I need.
---
As soon as you have you soldier certificate and you DMV registration you can download the plan from the terminal on the right side, right outside the main door off fort defiant.
---
If you dont have that yet, get somone to make you one, they can be made from lv5 and up ad with all mod's it's a nice rifle, + it has a recon scoop :)
---
1: Make a new build, do it over again.
---
2: just wait for more stuff too come out and mess with stuff cuz that‚Äôs always fun.
---
3: go around collecting resources, building cool camps and armour/weapons. (Give armour and weapons too low levels and tour ur camp every once in a while)
---
4: join in on at least a few group events like fasnacht or whatever else comes out next...
---
5: if u still wanna tell me all their is left too do is grind in a game not built for grinding, go hop into survival for a while. And enjoy hearing ur stories from when u fight players and loose too higher levels then u :)
---
At least you know you can sell/trade it back to the community. Thanks for sharing your experience though. I'll just stay off survival now
---
Are you looking to sell it? Is it a plan you can learn or an actual mod?
---
Seriously, man. 90% of the time, it you want a workshop I have, I'll probably give it to you. I probably am generally done with it. If ya ask first before firing you likely won't even need to waste the resources, speaking of cooperation.
---
I had the same problem, and agree completely that the enemy leveling in the game can be very annoying early on. It does feel like the radius for higher levels to effect ~~sexy singles~~  enemies in your area is way too loosey goosey, but if you just push on, grind a little in areas with lower enemy level caps, it gets better quicker than you think it will. like everyone else is saying, early levels can be hell.
---
Is it a rare spawn?  Or is it guaranteed to spawn at one of the known spots on any server?
---
Anyway, it's pretty easy to find by server hopping, just pick your spot and hop away.  When you find the tourist shout it to the rooftops.
---
Upvote for the lulz

i neither confirm nor deny any sexual feelings towards ripped frogs.
---
Cats is right, it's only for those 4 sets.
---
I have a camp inside the architecture of the horn right hq building.
---
No.  Only the broken camera from the tourist can be used to make a prosnap deluxe.  If you lose it it's gone forever.
---
Agreed!
---
Boxed mod unfortunately
---
is that the new apple console?
---
Got this with brick walls and laminate upper floor
---
Blackbird's for that "badass black military paint" look
---
Nukashine's for that "Mr rich playboy" look. And once those Handmade skins get released, you can finally roleplay as a kingpin!
---
Ah, ok. Thanks.
---
Good to know
---
&gt; Because nothing says fun and immersion like server hopping to finally get a basic questline
---
Minor side quest.
---
IT'S AN ENEMY STAND

Yeah. And people who get creative are much appreciated

That‚Äôs freaking hilarious

I‚Äôll take free fertilizer though

Gotta get the holy trinity, mutfruit, tatos, and corn
---
Haha!
---
Yes haven‚Äôt even started looking at armour yet!
---
&gt; Would anyone want bloodworms from Nuka World to return

Fuck no.
---
Haha I play a Liberty Prime soundboard

wimpishbean! your mom is calling! its time for your nap!~ you know you get cranky after your num-nums

Where'd you find that?

Nice idea, but I would rather have rain barrels that collect dirty water over time.
---
It was on my mule so I couldn‚Äôt be able to tell yah :/
---
You want to run with the big dogs. I get that. But you bought your way up to the point where you CAN be up there. But that doesn

What kingpin would use a ugly handmade rifle, a sleek 44 is what a kingpin would and should use
---
I laughed, but when I did it was more than blowing more air out of my nose than normal but not enough for me to open my mouth with a ‚Äúha ha.‚Äù No when I laughed at this, I made a deep guttural noise in my throat that can only be described as a wet goose honking at other wet geese for mates. That‚Äôs the noise I made. Like a shitty bike horn. Like a pelican being punched in the nads.
---
A legendary noxious sheepsquatch spawned here for me. First one I've ever seen too.
---
Muscle memory will quickly adapt
---
This may sound super weird, but I went to you artstation account, and holy crap your name is very similar to mine
---
Doing this crashes my game lol
---
With Junkie's as a main modifier, it's pretty weak. Whereas if they'd done it with Vampires, the thing would have been simply unstoppable.
---
I've been using it on my one-handed fast melee character and it's okay - the swingspeed along with martial artist makes it pretty ferocious, but again, the Junkies is a letdown so you get no multiplier, because there's no way to flatten the Junkie neg effects like there is with Mutant's.
---
Ouch
---
If assassin's cavalier armor and sentinel armor weren't able to be bypassed by VATS crits or broken by a stagger they'd be too over-powered. That'd be bad game mechanics. No one would be killed. Now they have weaknesses, and boy do the people that PVP all the time know about them. That's why everyone has that auto TSE or AE handmade lately. As long as there are legendaries, there's going to be this same situation, this push and pull. And Fallout has legendaries.
---
Holy crap cant believe that runs for you
---
Only with arrows!
---
HA! btw i love the way you made a "ceiling" out of the wires, looks very cool and unique!
---
To the best of your knowledge, how often do these respawn once you've knabbed a suit from a given location?
---
What helmet is that?
---
you got my hopes up with this one
---
It seems to be the new area to drop unwanted goods for other players now its a collective pool of resources and shops. 
---
I usually drop all my ammo I don't need for someone else.
---
Think of it like a give and take, since I usually find some junk or legendry's to sell in return
---
I‚Äôm still hitting square at every stashbox before remembering it‚Äôs only X now [PS4]. And that was changed a while ago
---
One time spawned near fort defiance with three scorchbeast flying around. Another time i entered a building to see at least two dozen scorched all agro at the same time and rush me like a flood.
---
welcome to the club! we have been "suggesting" Bethesda fix this for months
---
I always try to find someone fresh out of the vault to give spare plans, recipes, and meds to.
---
What?
---
There are no big dogs. This isnt rock paper scissors. Its rock rock rock. I can kill anyone in this game and they can kill me.
---
Seems like the cargobots are robots, it should work üëçüèº
---
They said that while you have a powered vending machine in your CAMP it will be marked on the map.

It does make weird noises, I like the look on my t60, but still not used to the sounds

Plenty of kinpings have had gold-plated or chromed AK47s.    They should release those skins as part of a bundle featuring kilos of Jet.

"Minor". Daily Challenges- Take picture of alpha deathclaw. Weekly Challenge- Take photos of players, Take photos of robots, Take photo of a  mirelurk queen.

Nah, missing the quest would barely have any impact on anything at all.

In a whitesprings vendor i found an AAE level 40 hunting rifle someone must have sold
---
Yeah, a few people have mentioned that now. Apparently I'm a little behind on news. Definitely excited for this addition though.
---
Nasty half of the emote wheel. Lol
---
I run it on an Asus g750j laptop no problems. Looks good and runs smooth.  ROG!
---
oof
---
Yes! And for armor pieces I‚Äôve been modding them to ultra light or light build
---
Lol I do this after I play assassins creed. Controls are different lol
---
It will most definitely be limited and my guess is 1 or 2 a day. At no point has Bethesda done anything to make getting 3-star anything easier. They don't want everyone to easily get the best of the best. It's an adventure game. They want you adventuring.
---
I messaged the guy after the kill, asking what he used. He didnt mention anything about vats criticals so idk. As far as I can tell this game mode has busted mechanics. High end armor should be better than no armor at all. Anyone defending otherwise is crazy.
---
How does it affect me out of curiosity?
---
I could see the nukashine in a museum
---
so what do you do when you want to use those other handmades? mod them again?
---
Right out side of the enclave back entrance to. It was primarily steel, lead screws
---
U online later today to help me sir?
---
Explosive weapons are useful for maneuvering corpses too. I did this when I couldn't quite get all three in a single shot (per the camera display). I could see all three initially, but camera was refusing to detect them.
---
Sun Kissed.
---
Revenant.
---
Cola-Nut (with Nuka-Cherry is just glorious in the Impostor event).
---
Quack Surgeon.
---
1 level of Tenderiser.
---
1 level of Suppressor.
---
The 'pacifying' ones (Robots, Animals, Creatures).
---
Shit the lead and screws are great lol. Steel is easy to come by. But I craft my own ammo I'm constantly running out of lead
---
Yeah but I have two that I carry that I use now regularly and haven‚Äôt actually touched the others for months. Saving them for the vendor sales or legendary sales options
---
You can put 10 drinks in there. I did test it with a friend last night and you dont get a choice of which drink you get you just consume one at random, which is perfect for sending folk on nukashine adventures!
---
Thank for the page. Is there a list of the type of enemy and weapon's effects?
---
Ok thanks!
---
The big dogs are the ones with the skill to use their fancy gear. 
---
And you should be able to kill and be killed by everyone in one way or another. It's really coming across as you thinking that you would be able to just purchase God level abilities a d now you are crying that there are people better than you.
---
It‚Äôs bad enough the event is laggy as heck but the fact that you don‚Äôt even get a guaranteed 3* from THE endgame enemy of the whole game it‚Äôs annoying. 
---
You can use the legendary vendor as a cop out but let‚Äôs be honest, there‚Äôs absolutely no reason why we should be wasting that much ammo and time on 1 item when you can go to white springs and Wes tek in half the time and you‚Äôll get at least one legendary for sure using a fraction of the resources. Legendary vendor just makes the SBQ and all boss events kinda pointless when you can just maximize the amount of legendaries you get by killing hordes, unless they patch legendary drops some more which would make this subreddit explode, I‚Äôm not gonna throw any expectations out there and tbh I‚Äôm not even expecting the legendary vendor to be good at its release. The legendary vendor and issues surrounding legendaries in general probably won‚Äôt be solved for another 3 months at the earliest. SBQ is going to suck for a while though.
---
At least it wasn‚Äôt on fire on your door.
---
Not gonna lie, I feel a vague warm kind of reminiscence to Skyrim whenever I hear flapping in the distance and immediately go into sneak.
---
The wendigo at times spawns in the wall, you can normally hear him growling/breathing, but can't find him.

DONT GET IN THE VAN! DONT EAT THAT FREE CANDY! RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I hate how in 76 bloody mess is pretty much mandatory. I never picked it in previous games because it looks dumb imo but in 76 if you don't have it you are simply at a disadvantage.

these are better shots than the atomic shop ones.

Awesomeness and perfection

The guy who made that calculator /u/akarnokd also posted this

It has a list of enemies. I saved that stuff in a spreadsheet for personal use.

ouch! geez, i hadnt heard about this, thank you for letting us know, this explains some strange behavior my loadout was experiencing
---
its in your weapons,and has a damage.maybe not an axe but it will do damage.
---
I should have thought about that last night,rather fiddling around tring to sw. weapons.
---
You were pretty much on the money. The Daily and Weekly atom challenges, lol.   
---
And yeah, I figured as much, that they weren't in the game when they never seemed to appear in the daily/weekly challenges, but you never know.. They might pop up.. eventually.
---
HENRY!!! I left the iron on!
---
I hope so cause I really need them !!!!
---
Why do you want ores instead? Getting scrap saves you on acid breaking it down to scrap, which is the only way to use it

Sadly you can't put toxic goo in, I tried.

no one expects the molerat inquisition!
---
I got my 3* bloodied super sledge from a WS bag, I also pick up good stuff around watoga after a queen run as well. Usually pick up 3-5 bags full of junk legandaried I sell, then buy whatever good ones someone sold. 2 nights ago I bought a 3* bloodied bat, with the chain mod it's now doing over 1k damage easy. Best 35 caps spent!
---
Yeah agreed I‚Äôm always leaving gifts like plans, stimpaks and purified water to low ranks, half the time they don‚Äôt notice
---
this is the correct answer
---
The disconnections are likely a problem on your end, not theirs.  Most people aren't getting that many disconnects.  I play for about 15 hours a week and I get disconnected maybe twice in that time.
---
Server maintenance is a thing, though.  It happens.  No way around that.

I like the 'sun' esq on the chest, but apart from that I prefer the War paint

gotcha~!!! its a good idea for my mule character, ill have to do some unmodding tonight
---
Blackbird can be applied to T-45, T-51b, T-60, and X-01. It can not be applied to Excavator or Ultracite.
---
Blackbird paint was only available as a limited time Atom Shop months ago. No idea when they're going to put it back up (if ever).
---
That's cool mate very diy.
---
Thats great! Ill let u know for sure! Thanks!

---
I came into this thread with no idea what yoked meant. Not I know, side note, they are fckn beefy.
---
I've not experiened that one thankfully :)
---
This is irrelevant. 
---
The question is, how much of a difference should there be between a high end armor set and no armor at all in a game like this? If you can die in .5 seconds while sprinting in assassin cavalier armor with all relevant defensive perks, why bother having armor at all? It literally does nothing. What do you say to that? To the mechanics of the game?
---
As far as skill goes, I broke even in my session. Youre coming across like a tough guy that thinks hes so skilled that he can defend broken game mechanics.
---
This is why I don't have any doors on my camp. /*taps temple*
---
Duped items are a problem i give you that, but its hard for them to do something about it now, without punishing people who havent done anything wrong (like someone bought a duped gun without knowing). The only thing we can do now is to wait until they either balance stuff across the board (using Power Armor all the time really shows that sentinels stuff is broken AF, cuz non PA users can be WAY more tanky then me) or until they bring the 4star legendaries out (and hopefully patched any remaining duping glitches by then).
---
The question is (with all the other prevailing bugs right now), should they really invest heavily into fixing duping now (which doesnt remove all the duped items) or should they use that force to make the game better in whole?
---
BTW im still in hope that with the upcoming legendary vendor and vendor machines, everyone will have a much easier time to get hands on some good gear and thus making high value trades less lucrative.
---
Im not gonna comment cause i have no idea how they are gonna do it. But as you write its NOT gonna be a guaranteed way to grab any god rolls easier than its now. I honestly cant imagine how its gonna work, but my guess would be something like you write
---
Yup, that's what I used to to as well, but I wanted something better, to prevent the issue. I think this tool works for me, updated the OP to reflect this. Few hours of gaming, alt-tabbing, no issues at all.
---
I never pick up toilet paper. But now i might have a reason to. Idea could be to liter the roof of a fellow wastelanders home with bags on their roof filled with toilet paper. XD
---
All good
---
**Exterminator** *(PER-14)* \- Ignore 25/50/75% armor of bugs and mirelurks. Especially good against mirelurks if they are non-glowing. For glowing ones, use Glow Sight instead/as well (depending on how many perception points you can spare).
---
**Photosynthetic** *(END-47)* \- Regenerate health between 6AM and 6PM outside of combat and outdoors. Level 1 is good enough.
---
**Travel Agent** *(CHR-26)* \- Fast travel costs 30% less. You can spend more money on rare resources such as Acid...
---
I always leave pies for the neighbours with cream or water on the doorstep. :-/

---
Ive been waiting for those tile floors to come back since i started playing
---
Why leadbelly if you go bloodied? And i recommend a lever. Higher dmg and faster rate of fire
---
Thankfully I saw this  after I finished playing because I've only just met Grahm!   
---
From the small interaction that I had with Grahm, yes! There needs to be questline!
---
My guess is that the coins will not make you able to turn a 1* weapon into a 3* weapon. If you want a specific 3* handmade, you have to start with a generic 3* handmade.
---
Unless you somehow one shot it two minutes after the event started it's fair game. The build up where you escort the cows is more than enough time to get people in place.
---
Im setting up vending nearby to get better stuff! Lets subvert the system!
---
I do like the look of it for the walls, and the wire roof is really cool.
---
Beth is trying to jump on the microtransaction game, look at the Rockstar model.  Big difference is customer service.  Rockstar customer service actually responds to you and no ban is permanent, ensuring return customer.  The whole idea of ban is punishment, so players won't do it again.  Well if they are perma banned, Beth not only lost a customer in F76 and atom shop purchases, they also lost customer in ALL beth current and future products.  
---
Theres so much games out there, the one who loses in the end is Beth.  I was a big Fallout fan, spent over a thousand on the collectors edition and merchandise.  Would have spend hundreds if not thousands for the life time on F76.  Well not anymore.
---
I don't like it because it's not at all creative. X% damage increase on everything; they could have done that by changing a multiplier on the base formula they use for damage and have been done with it. Instead, we have to use 3 perks to get to the same place. They could have skipped this perk and we'd be better off.
---
Here now! It‚Äôs like Christmas!
---
Wish I had know that yesterday.   
---
Thankfully the 6 Super Mutants took most of the Sheepsquatch health and all I had to do was shoot it a couple times in the head
---
No, they can't since they are Atomic Shop items.
---
It was wood armor, wasn‚Äôt it.  I bet it was wood armor...
---
At least I'm not the only person that did this
---
My advice, with all the really good strength perks you want to leave slugger/gladiator and its expert/master variants on rank 1 (3times 10% damage for 3 points overall) to squeeze in blocker, barbarian, incisor and martial artist for a wholesome melee build :D
---
Yeah that would help spread people out a bit more, I'd probably have my camp in a different location if it wasn't so inconvenient to get dirty water without having your camp on a water source (though that would still be popular I'm sure).
---
Absolutely... I can't see them letting you add levels or stars to your weapon/armor.
---
This is harmlessly hilarious and brought me much joy
---
I'm sorry for laughing but this was hilarious hahaha
---
The camp build limit has also been tweaked (kind of increased). They lowered the amount of build budget that lights take up. Some players had minimal effects from it; but for me, i was able to add a complete other room.
---
Idk what you‚Äôre talking about man, I‚Äôm a bloodied build and it doesn‚Äôt matter how god tier my armor is, if you hit me with a base lvl radium rifle I‚Äôm gonna die in 3 seconds. I die from glowing ones without getting hit sometimes just because my rads get to high. 
---
Everything has its pros and cons already Bloodied build crybabies are the worst we are literally at less than 30% health the entire time we play man, how is that not balance. If you can‚Äôt win in PVP either spend the time learning how to counter their builds or play PVE where half your enemies don‚Äôt even shoot at you.
---
However I will say that sent/cav is kinda crazy for a third perk they should‚Äôve def been a primary one, but PVP in fallout is new to Bethesda and it‚Äôs pretty obvious most of their perks and game mechanics are simply better suited for a PVE game anyway (I mean, Vats is literally aimbot), but yeah most of these nerfs you listed are booty, don‚Äôt ever let me catch you bad mouthing unyielding armor ever again bro.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat, been offline due to my studies and final push for my EIT. I was fairly overwhelmed the other day when I logged in. I‚Äôve read some of the patch 8 notes and that helped kind of put things in a time-line perspective. Might be worth a read for yourself too. :)

I'm sure a lot of people will have their C.A.M.P.S. set up in close proximity to the vendor.
---
Yeah, but thats not really an issue, cuz you can only ever attack them AFTER the event is over and at that point, they are "useless" anyways :)
---
BTW Tesla Coils will also damage the cows
---
I think most people are now saving their lower star legendaries for the legendary vendor
---
This wasn't even the Free Range event.  Just ran up the broken road from the dam area towards Braxson's and there they all were in the parking lot, and it was on.  Just another shootout in the woods!
---
That's funny, because my point is that I'm not at all some tough guy. But I do know the mechanics of the game and how to counter them. And I also know that all of the other top players know them as well. 
---
You just got owned by a VATS shot with top end gear.  That's all.  I do it all the time. Try sneaking. 
---
You arn't fighting low level scrubs. Top end gear is going to be able to punch through high end gear.
---
Having counters to be able to kill all the various combos of skills, gear, playstyles, ect. isn't bad game design at all. It's imperative game design actually.
---
OMG don't get me started on the wood armor, lol!
---
I can't tell if you're trying to use VATS or not - you seem to have picked some VATS perks but not fully specced into a VATS build. I assume you mostly manually aim and occasionally go into VATS.
---
You could go VATS/Commando/Sniper with your handmade which is really sweet in my opinion - but that's a different discussion. If you're deadset on this build, I'd recommend a couple tweaks:
---
1. Get rid of Tenderizer and bump up Lone Wanderer. If you're using a hunting rifle, things should be dead in 1 or 2 shots. That extra 5% damage after the first shot won't make much of a difference.
---
2. Get rid of Gunsmith and use Rank 3 Nerd Rage and Demolition. Move the extra INT point somewhere else.
---
3. Your build shows an unused point in Agility. Use it for max Sneak?
---
4. Even though you're running PvE, I still find Fireproof to be really useful for Scorchbeasts and Super Mutant grenades and missiles.
---
I thought I'd seen it on a datamine post but turns out it was just the combat armor. Yeah it could use something a bit more wasteland.
---
Awesome!
---
No, there's actually a large two handed bone club you can get. I bought it from one of the train station vendors.
---
Sigh :( Well I was leaning towards that but thought it worth an ask.
---
I just hope they come back next year for my collection
---
All we need is a Lincoln's Repeater skin for the Lever-action rifle...
---
ammo, I drop ammo (and fusion cores, I avoid PA).
---
Oh my god...
---
Oh, one of the random events. Yeah, fuck that guy. I've only seen the one with the robot still alive but wasn't able to protect any of them by myself. That thing has a ton of health.
---
See, you didn't answer the question at all. You just said " I know the other top players owned!". 
---
Answer the question. Should high end armor make a difference over no armor at all? Because it doesn't.
---
Stalker doubles your hitchance vs anything while you are not in combat (the moment it shows "DANGER" in sneakmode) but your shot costs 50% more ap. Its a bit confusing with stuff like "+33% chit chance in vats" legendary effect, which seems to give you 33% flat of extra hitchance, while stalker's 100% means, 100% from your initial chance (double).
---
How long did that take?!
---
r/subsifellfor
---
That was me.  I mean not this particular instance...can‚Äôt take credit for dropping a deuce on someone‚Äôs bed.  I like finding a way in and leaving moldy food and cracked bowls in the kitchen or full skeletons (all the appropriate pieces) in the bedroom, then going chameleon and watching the player‚Äôs reaction.  
---
The deuce though...
---
&lt;golf clap&gt;
---
Very good point, I know I am. I'm always surprised when I find 2 or 3 star stuff at vendor. Found a 3 star bit of sentinels in Watoga Station last night.
---
The issue is that  creation engine is quite old and not really designed for this sort of gameplay. Meaning that a standard item allocation system where each weapon was assigned a specific reference which would effectively prevent duping stright away can't be done as the engine won't take it. 
---
Making OP weapons less powerful is exactly the same as getting rid of them. People would feel cheered and get pissed off. Introducing new more powerful weapons just continues the cycle of duping. It's a problem that can't really be solved and will be a contributing factor of the games demise which will be very upsetting as I love FO76
---
My fav is Mountainside B&amp;B, there are always two of them near the train track.
---
Looks great man, entertaining vid too. I laughed at the "mad cozy" part.
---
data miners say its listed as a challenge reward currently.
---
3 fireproof + dense chest means explosive weapons tickle.
---
Stalker melee weapons are straight up useless as far as i know. You either have 95% hitchance (while in range) or 0% hitchance (while out of range) as melee. Doubling anything wouldnt do anything, 95% is the max hitchance and 0 times 2 is still 0. Unless there are hidden modifier noone knows of yet.
---
Imposter or real? The imposter is pretty weak in the legs so I have to ask. If the real one is too that's kind of neat. I spent a long time in game before realizing that a ton of robots are weakest in their limbs rather than their torso.
---
I really want to craft it. The fact that its real world counterpart would be Fireball Whiskey makes me love it so much. I hope that if and when they implement it that they use a new item model like maybe the old Whiskey bottles from Fallout 3 &amp; New Vegas.
---
&gt; The games RNG is FUBAR,
---
No it's not FUBAR.  It's random.  Some people have great difficulty in understanding what that means.
---
I'm less than 100 yards from a train station.  That would be super lazy...
---
real one
---
Huh. I assumed everyone saw him regularly.   I don't like the one that lurks and poofs away.
---
I thought if you joined a team, team mates could build at your camp?  If so why couldn't a teamate build the egg for OP?

Lower level weapons and armor are practical to use when leveling up new characters and are sought after as such to give to newer players from veteran players looking to introduce them into the game. I once found an Unyielding Leather Right Leg Lv.1 off a Legendary Mirelurk Hatchling (hilariously enough) and gave it to my cousin so she could get the bonus off low health given how hard Radaway was to get a hold of early on.
---
Before the first update that messed with camp locations, I had mine on the bridge right next to thunder mountain. It was an awesome place to harvest xp. I would claim the workshop (which was a very short jog away) and place a bunch of water purifiers. I'd use that to make a ton of diluted meds to use/sell. That, along with high level enemies and the super mutant vendor making frequent appearances, is why I miss that spot so much.
---
This particular surprise wasn't me (i'm 90% sure),however, i have been doing that exact thing for the last month or two.  I typically leave 1 tp, and 2 fert, and yes.. i specifically leave it on the bed because it reminds me of 'allways sunny in phil" and i giggle.  
---
I used to leave broken doll arms or the scorched body parts in jars, but those run out to quickly.   Fert is everywhere and TP is all over Whitesprings.

I did this once on a lowbie character to get some stuff broken down, stashed, and a fresh XP buff. The camp owner chased me around shooting at me and throwing grenades while spamming the thumbs down emote. I didn't mess with anything but he was MAD. Thankfully it was adventure mode and I had pacifist on so nothing came of it.
---
I hope it‚Äôs not an rng re roll system. I would like to trade in legendary items for tokens then buy the the legendary mod I want using said tokens. That way I can mod a ultracite Gatling laser. Which currently cannot be gotten in game as a legendary. Even if it was like 300 tokens for a mod I‚Äôd be fine would make it so I would have to turn in 900 legendary items for a god like gun of my own making. Seems fair to me takes a lot of work but is exactly what you want. I don‚Äôt want more rng on top of all the rng already in place for legendaries and drop tables.

The key thing to understand is that Damage/Energy Resistance isn't that useful past a certain point.  Enemies like Colonel Gutsy and melee attackers have an armor penetrating-like effect.  What you should end up favoring are perks that offer flat damage reduction instead of more DR/ER.
---
The main perks I have for survival are Serendipity (Luck) and Dodgy (Agility).  Blocker (Strength) also helps specifically against melee, as does Lone Wanderer (Charisma).  I also have three pieces of Sentinel armor (armor with the "Reduce damage by 15% when standing still and not moving" perk).
---
I also don't use Power Armor unless I'm in a nuke zone.
---
What all that means is that if I have low health, then Serendipity will provide a 45% chance to not get hit *at all*.  If I do, then if I'm not in a team, Lone Wanderer blunts all incoming damage by 30%.  If I'm standing still, the damage is nerfed by 45%.  If it is a melee attack, Blocker will blunt it by another 45%.  I have Action Points, then Dodgy will blunt the attack by another 30%.
---
The end result is that I can stand in front of a Scorchbeast tanking its green Cheerios and essentially take no damage at all.
---
Now, Sentinel armor (and its sprinting-oriented cousin Cavalier) is hard to come by.  You need to have luck with 3\* enemies.  One way you can sort of mimic the effect is to use the Suppressor (Charisma) perk which blunts incoming damage from a target by 30% for 2 seconds after you hit it.
---
I also use Unyielding armor.  While it doesn't increase Endurance, it does provide for more Agility at low health, which means more Action Points for Dodgy to do its thing.
---
For Field Medic try the imposter event ;)
---
I'm still inclined to fight her to get that elusive Prime Handmade plan, so I can prime weapons against her to get - er, wait, why would I fight her afterwards?
---
Okay, there is a 5% chance a regular Scorchbeast drops a Prime plan. It takes about 80 rounds on average to down one (less if they land early) so I have to kill 20 on average: 1600 rounds. Fighting the SBQ is around 1500 - 2500 rounds depending on who is also fighting along, plus \~800 rounds spent in the silo if I launch.
---
Finding a 3\* legendary item is about 4% for me, so I have to kill 25 legendaries on average to get one 3\*, or 35 if I'm in Whitesprings. A Feral ghoul takes 3-6 rounds and a Glowing One takes 10-20 rounds. Legendaries are said to spawn 5% chance so I have to kill 500 enemies with 1500/5000 rounds on average to get a 3\*.
---
Thanks for the stats.
---
Yes. It does. 
---
But there is a threshold of how high your resistance ability is going to go. Yours is higher than most but still fairly easily reachable. Especially when most of that ability is reliant on perks that are so conditional. 
---
Your cavalier is stopped the second you get staggered or the moment you reach your target and attempt an attack in mellee. 
---
Serendipity is only a 45% chance. Any autofire rifle will hit you a half a dozen times in half a second. Even if half these shots are dodged then you are still fucked. 
---
Dodgy quickly uses up your AP- which you are using for your sprint coverage. 
---
It just goes on and on. 
---
If you arn't going to rely on stealth, I would much rather go Life Saving armor and the Mysterious Savior. They may shoot you down but you'll have something like a 50-75% chance to just pop right back up. Better yet, combine them.
---
My way expectation is to walk in with a bag of 1* Wood Armours and walk out with a matching set of BoS Unyielding/AP Regen/Cavalier Light Combat Armour.
---
If my expectation is not met I will throw all my toys out of the pram, foam profusely through the mouth and mash frantically my keyboard filled with righteous rage.
---
Yeah... You're gonna be dissapointed. Sorry.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat as you, but imo anthem is 10x the dumpster fire 76 ever was, and only got about half the negative press. Can you imagine if 76 level capped you at 50 and make you kill the SBQ 100x with 1-3 legendary items?
---
It also might be that the spot you found is super cool because it is actually the location of future dlc content and you will never be able to place your camp because they've made it a no-camp zone.
---
Interesting.. So if we're to believe dataminers.. That would mean it's live now, but glitched? Bummer.
---
Thanks!  Any chance you're still gonna add the radium rifle?
---
They're out there.
---
Don't have much of an expectation, i'm to bitter by now to get hyped about anything in any game anymore (#whatasadlife). BUT i hope they do the right step and learn from other games in the way they done similar things. I kind of would like to see something like Diablo 3, where you can reroll one of the stats that is already on the legendary, but as soon as you reroll that one you arent able to reroll any other stat.
---
Now that i've written this, i realize i am expecting something... shit!
---
Yea they ‚Äòbalanced‚Äô explosive weapons (grenade launcher, fatman and rocket launcher) way too much. I didn‚Äôt realize this until my first SBQ battle, I wasted dozens of mini nukes and rockets yet didn‚Äôt see the queen‚Äôs health bar budge. Now with an explosive minigun I can clearly see her life chipped away by the hail of 5mm bullets. Meanwhile it takes about two seconds for the mini to start firing, so for close quarters and fast moving creatures the shotty really shines. It‚Äôs the way they ‚Äòbalanced‚Äô the weapon system, we just have to pick and choose the right ones for the right enemies.
---
OMG I totally want this. And to be able to put a big banner that says "CRAZY EDDIE'S - MY PRICES ARE SO LOW MY WIFE THINKS I'M CRAAAAAAAZYYYYYY"
---
You kid (I hope) but you know there will a be a metric ton of posts very similar to what you described.
---
Well I feel dumb.  I mod all the legendary armor I get with ultra light when I can and I've never once thought to check the weapons I have.  Thanks for the tip! +1
---
I know, but I can hope lol. I don‚Äôt even need this legendary vendor I have 450 hrs in game and have all the god loot. I‚Äôd be more interested in more camp budget than the legendary vendor tbh
---
Oh yeah!! or maybe a black bottle with a fireball emblem on it's label. That would be pretty cool.   
---
But alas... we must wait 'til Bethesda fixes it.. Or releases it. Orr... whatever they need to do about making it real.
---
I know this is a dickish thing I‚Äôm about to suggest, but I think it would be hilarious if someone could hide a bottle cap mine under someone‚Äôs bed.
---
Explosive whiskey is probably too much even for us to drink.  Now if it was a new type of grenade, that would be cool.
---
Damn wood armor
---
After they get done releasing the horsemen and other PA paints - will be when they'll hit us with a return of Blackbird.  Its textbook, drain everyone's atom pool and then hit them with something most will still want to pick up.
---
Yeah just keep in mind it takes lots of mats -
---
Screws and Adhesive in particular
---
Hate those sneaky Intelligence Bass. Always sticking their gills where they don't belong.
---
im doing this from now on....
---
For me at least, the plan usually pops up at one of the faction vendors at whitesprings.
---
Would be nice, but doesn't fit Bethesda's MO.
---
Yeah I haven‚Äôt been disconnected in a long time.
---
Same.
---
Hey, maybe it'll end up being the nexus for player marketplaces.
---
XB1 also
---
2lead ores = 5lead scrap
---
I want maily have more out of 1/2hour protecting one workshop. I can't make even 36ammo from lead i get there now. That's crazy, isn't it?
---
Oh, you poor thing.  Now imagine you want deep pocketed *scout armor*.  The plans don't exist, the Enclave vendor only stocks 3 random mods at a time (out of some 35 possible mods) and there is no way of telling the difference between chest mods and limb mods.
---
I'll try, thanks !
---
I am going to have *so* much stash room once that vendor rolls out haha
---
You're in survival. Git gud, scrub.
---
Like, for example, go into adventure mode, relocate yourself so you're not parachuting in on top of a spawn point, and then go back into survival.
---
Use your BRAIN.
---
This idea is almost like rerolling items in D3.
---
I can put camo on my metal armor. Came with the camo bundle. Looks alright I guess ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I want gunsmith so I don‚Äôt have to keep repairing my weapons all the time. And I probably don‚Äôt need an extra rank in demo expert because I am already going to be able to one shot almost anything. I‚Äôll be running below 20% health and am going to be getting tons of damage out of the bloodied effect! I did take tenderizer out and I also took a point out of perception and took out long shot to put another point in need rage! And I used the points in agility on dodgy so I can negate damage!
---
Except C.A.M.P.S by design can't be placed close to each other and with the random server spawning it's unlikely you'll ever see something well enough organized between a team of players to pull it off and the regular.
---
Oh great, got two stalkers‚Äô combat knives from two SBQ battles yesterday, what are the odds. They even came with the awesome ‚Äò90% reduced weight‚Äô feature, how thoughtful. ü§Æ
---
Shit I was killed at Whitespring while in menu the other day (no bounty) and half a dozen people swarmed my junk. I lost like 200 pounds of screws, springs, gears, lead and adhesive I was gonna use on new armor.
---
I found a bunch of plans a few days ago, like the decontamination arch and some weapons I didn't have.  I added a few duplicates I had and then moved on.
---
I'm level 102.  I have no idea whether I'm doing any good killing the queen, but gotta get rid of all that ammo some way.  :)
---
Yeah my first thought on pvp was "Destiny 2 is CONSTANTLY balancing pvp and everyone is always unhappy, and it's a game that was \*designed\* for pvp, Bethesda thinks they can just dump their unbalanced pve garbage into a pvp setting and think it'll work?" The hubris is just staggering.
---
My health went to zero so fast I didn't have a chance to stagger, so that cant be it. I was sprinting and assassin and cavalier were both active.
---
I messaged the guy, asking what he was using. He said he had an aae automatic combat rifle. He didnt say anything about criticals so idk. Okay, nice gun, but I have nice armor and was in sprint mode when I dropped. I dont think it was a head shot because my health went down by about 1/3 each hit.
---
Looks like armor and defense is completely irrelevant in PvP. The only good defense is camping in chameleon, and that is a result of bad mechanics, like high end armor being equal to no armor at all.
---
Bosses at work look down on people who play FO76 at their desks.  Reddit?  Less so.
---
I have this and cannibal so I don‚Äôt have to worry about food! After a kill I‚Äôll just eat the goodies and get no radiation! And I‚Äôm using the hunting rifle just because of personal preference! And I know the lever is better but I‚Äôm going to be one shotn everything anyways so I chose this!
---
The blue visor gives me the clone commando feels
---
Some of those guys probably would still contest the workshop just so they can fight.
---
"Words of wisdom Lloyd, words of fuckin' wisdom"
---
I think he meant CAMPS ya‚Äôll.
---
Still have the lmg going? How much would you want for it?
---
Well yeah, I don't mean them being right on top of each other or walking upon five neatly arranged camps, but that overall if you're looking for a player vendor you might have a better shot in that general area.
---
Okay but that wired roof is one of the coolest things I've seen.
---
Can i ask where you've heard that anthem is no longer been supported?
---
I usually get a small bounty and hide inside the CAMP, and when people come over to kill me they destroy it.

---
 &gt; Okay but that wired roof is one of the coolest things I've seen.
---
I don't understand why there isn't a larger no build area around WS. Why it doesn't extend to the actual outside wall is beyond me.
---
Nitpick:  There is no such thing as "Passive Mode."  It's *Pacifist*.
---
This is the answer. Every armor set should have a counter.
---
My mules are carrying all the wood armors rolling pins and tire irons they physically can. I hope I can get hundreds if not thousands of tokens out of those garbage and use the tokens to reroll my god tier stuff and make them even godder.
---
I use Weapon Artisan whenever I repair my weapons; I don't bother with Gunsmith at all.
---
If you got rid of Gunsmith, you could move those points into Perception and max out all your Rifleman perks.
---
I've accepted that Fallout 76 is nothing more than a skinner box.
---
With that said.....after 800 hours of play if I can't turn all of the junk legendaries I have on 4 mules into a couple of pieces allowing me to finish this build .....this mouse will not be going after the cheese anymore.
---
The replayability in this game should be about making new builds to try out and that can't be achieved with this loot system.
---
I've noticed since the vendor cap upgrade that less good stuff gets dropped. I think before, one you tapped out the 200 caps, you had to do something with the extra stuff.  I've even stopped dropping armor and guns since I'm able to sell most of it in one trip.  I do still drop lower level stuff 5-20 level in areas where newbies may be.
---
Anthem is a new game, fallout 76 has an entire generation of people who know the brand name, and expect a certain kind of experience from it.
---
Yes.  You don't need memorable characters to have a good quest.
---
Apparently Geralt's story was not as interesting as you say, since you don't even remember his name and it's used many times in the story.  At least you got Rose right.
---
This again highlights my original point.  This all seems to be a decision you made prior to playing the game and that made it impossible for you to actually appreciate it for what it is.
---
Should start leaving fertilizer and a flip lighter on people's doorsteps.
---
She could use the instigating rolling pin she just found, but she‚Äôd have to wait until the valerian steel sharp mod to come out in a future update.
---
HE CALLED THE SHIT POOP
---
I had my 3*explo railway gun in a paper bag at WS omg thank you so much !
---
Think you be able to add the legendary effects that were in Fallout 4 but don‚Äôt drop in 76.
---
Well that was my initial thought too provided they had the egg blueprints able to build, but it would seem you cant since its an Atomic Shop item even though it is for free
---
Anthem didn't have a grumpy, older, dedicated playerbase, used to decades of solo play to contend with, either. Fallout players have had years to hone their skills at critiquing Fallout games.
---
There is a cheat I ran into where people drop to 1% hp but won't go into downed
---
The sorting is not stable, i.e. when things sort equally the order they are displayed in is not fixed.
---
Would be nice to be able to set proximity sensor on turrets.
---
3 upper management at anthem quit and they took future updates off the website. Just my bold prediction.
---
Haven‚Äôt played Anthem in a month or so. What‚Äôs all this about stopping support? Is that confirmed or just part of the BioWare ongoing silence?
---
I do agree though. 76 received an outrageous amount of hate compared to most releases lately. Imo anthem only offered a small portion of the gameplay available in 76 from the beginning. 
---
76 has quite a few layers of gameplay and I‚Äôm still interested at 700 hours. Where as Anthem gets boring after a few runs imo.
---
True
---
I agree it's stupid that the only build with any chance of actually bringing down a sbq is bloodied. But if you nerf it the sbq encounter becomes impossible. I'm hoping the new legendary perks will buff the other builds so that things other than bloodied become viable.
---
I'd like to have a list of there gt's. I've had them attack a few times. Last time was this past week. Me and my friends were at whitesprings, I was heading to his camp and then it shows he got killed by one of them. So I told my friends to leave the server and block him
---
Yeh sorry caps lol
---
Hope we can some info on him today in the inside the vault
---
I'd like to get about 5k out of it
---
Likely a daily or weekly honestly. Though that could easily change. Just what its flagged as right now
---
I jumped into a SBQ fight yesterday and she just flat out disappeared from the sky when she died.  Far as I know nobody found the body.  At least I wasn't disconnected so I got some event rewards, but to get not even the chance at epic loot stung.
---
I made a rust inspired airlock that uses a pressure plate to trap people in.
---
and if they break through the secondary door behind that,I have pungee traps and turrets waiting.
---
Hi, I'm addicted to workshops.  If I pass by one I have to claim it.  I have to build it up.  I am constantly overburdened with stupid ore, which means I need acid, which means I need another workshop, which means I need gears, which means I need another workshop with junk.... I AM A WORKSHOP JUNKIE.  
---
I really want better alerts and a timer for pvp!! Or the ability to relinquish to another player so I don't have to die if I want to pass/relinquish it to someone else.  Sometimes I just don't care to keep it, even though I put all the resources and generators and water and food.
---
If u shoot it all down its like 300-500 bounty.
---
Not to be rude but start off by reading the notes Betheda posts.  It pretty much sums up everything.   Welcome back.
---
Damn Shame, That could have been a lot of fun.
---
No, you don't have to activate any transponders at all.
---
Where tho
---
Not just that, how's Red Dead Online doing? I have to remind myself that it still exists.
---
I've killed 4 or 5 now and I always cripple a leg (or two) and then headshot to the end. Works quite well.
---
I could swing that, lv 50 I take it?
---
I dropped a 3 star lvl 40 mutant hatchet to lvl 39 today. I bet he loved it.
---
Now we need a "wait a minute" emote.
---
How does weapon artisan work? Like does it fully repair your weapon, and how often does it work?
---
I‚Äôve seen some really curious ones, like inside WS next to the vendors there were paperbags with bulked stuff and random junk and even flux. Doesn‚Äôt look like someone just don‚Äôt need them any more, more like they met an unexpected end then never made it back, and whoever killed them didn‚Äôt pick up their junk. How does that even happen? Can someone‚Äôs PS4 crash and cause them to drop all their junk? Just very bizarre paperbags with useful stuff.
---
I won't be satisfied until they let me cash in my horde of 1-2 *'s to make my current weapons/armor 5 star.
---
Would be funny if we could find it and he‚Äôd be like ‚Äúwtf is this‚Äù if we tried to give it to him. 
---
Still annoyed we couldn‚Äôt find it for strong
---
Grahm sometimes has it, or the BOS Vendor
---
I honestly think both these armors are fine......in PVE. 
---
It's my opinion that survival mode should have no legendary weapons or armor.  This would make the game way more "survival" in my opinion.
---
So the moocher boi didnt get an easy legendary, shame
---
I had hopes that Anthem would be fun... I have 60 hours in that game... I am approach 400 in F76 even after taking a short 2 months break earlier this year.
---
Anthem is a shitshow with no direction from what development team is left for it.
---
Fallout 76 was a shitshow and still has some snags, but at least the developers haven't given up on it and we are getting new content continually.
---
That makes sense and I hope you‚Äôre wrong
---
I doubt that. They have had a hard enough time balancing the game for PvP with the current legendary effects.
---
You transferred it before then, and realized it was gone when at the camp, thinking it was deleted at that point.
---
He called the shit raw fertilizer!
---
I completely disagree. The inclusion of legendary weapons in their current form (nameless dropped items that really do not have a legend at all) completely moves this game more into a "loot shooter" style game instead of a role playing game like it should be.
---
People play role-playing games for years because they are quite literally immersed in a story that is being continually created as they play. Some of those games don't even require or have loot mechanics. 
---
Fallout is at its roots an RPG, the OP is dead on about story.
---
I'm the same, I'll go out of my way to let people get hits in but if they don't contribute I couldn't care less if they don't get a drop. Some peoples entitlement is nuts.
---
Looking at how much stuff they've borrowed from other games, i still think it'll be some variation of how the Grinder worked in the Borderlands Pre-Sequel. 
---
You fed the machine three compatible things to get one random roll new one at the higher level, and could use a special currency to guarantee a better result.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao05VMVgBhc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao05VMVgBhc)
---
It doesn't hand out god-rolls but does make it a tiny possibility, and it keeps people grinding and keeping the trash legendaries to recycle instead of paper-bagging them or selling them to a vendorbot for a pittance.
---
I think it goes to show that sometimes what you do in failure defines you more than what you do in success.
---
76 didn't do as well as Bethesda would have hoped, critically or financially.  But instead of cutting their losses and nixing it, Bethesda doubled down, promised a year of new stuff, and has largely followed through on it while stabilizing and improving the general game.  Yeah, we have some missteps here and there, and there's still a ways to go, but everything is headed in the right direction.  Back in the trying weeks after release, we stuck around because we all saw *something* in the game that was quietly brilliant, and with each update, we see a little more of that come to the surface.  The potential was always there.  Better late than never.
---
EA?  They decided to cut-and-run.  It's what they do when faced with adversity (and angry shareholders).
---
Disconnects seem to have increased again since Patch 8.  Claimed a workshop this morning and after paying 25 caps, got a Server Disconnect.  Restarted and thought everything was OK since the workshop was listed as claimed but didn't pay close enough attention.  Went to grab some ammo from an ammo can and stopped myself because I suddenly noticed a gun turret that I hadn't built sitting idling.  Double-checked and the workshop was claimed alright . . . but by someone else!  Lost my 25 caps and would have gone "Wanted" if I hadn't caught on.  In the next hour I had another Server Disconnect and a "Log off immediately for server maintenance!"
---
The mechanics arn't broken because someone with high end gear got through your high end gear. You were both on a level playing field. You were just at a strategic disadvantage. So you lost. 
---
If you got the jump on him you probably could have won. 
---
I can tell you exactly what happened though. You were moving from cover to cover and he was firing at I'm guessing medium range? He simply used his auto rifle in VATS (probably a near 100% chan e head shot) to fire on you. Crits arn't even that necessary because the first and/or second shot of the barrage staggered you with either the explosions or Tank Killer. Than the rest of the shots blew you to hell. This would have all happened in a few seconds so probably felt like you were being one shot. 
---
That's a common but fairly specific set of circumstances. If the dude had a Lever Action or shotgun or other slower rate single fire weapon you probably would have been fine. Hurt for sure but you would have survived. 
---
Are you running all of the DR/ER peeks too? Is your armor upgraded?
---
You can't just rely on fancy effects if the armor itself is just paper and you are super squishy inside.
---
I have a feeling the faceless men taught her the secrets of better RNG,  she probably has all god tier leather armor on too
---
Simple answer.  NO
---
Upvote
---
It's in the blunt weapon crafting menu.
---
That's a fantasy of mine IRL. Like, I seduce a girl, take her to her room, tie her up. Once she's tied up and naked, instead of carrying on with kinky sex as she imagines, ruin her day by taking a shit on her chest. After cleaning myself up, phone a family member on speaker and leave (someone has to come untie her). I even have my fake name ready for that moment, John Khara.
---
Well thank you, I did not know that.
---
 I don't pay attention to the whole Meta thing to see which weapons are better than others. I just use what I find.
---
 Using a quadruple explosive handmade with vats bonus, anti armor handmade with vats bonus and a mutants lever action rifle.
---
 I don't use the trade channel.  I only use what I find.
---
I was getting ready to hop on the other night to go out and scavenge for screws with my step dad and he ended up getting cornered in small run down building outside tanagra town with two L80 legendary sheepsquatch. I'm only level 58, he was 92. I had just picked up a lvl 50 Gatling laser off a deathclaw and I'm lucky I did. I burned through 8 fusion cores, 200 shot gun rounds and 300 5.56 from my handmade while my teammate picked him off with a laser rifle. I ran my fusion cores down until I had just enough to make sure I can get my power armor back to base and then we went out with the all rise (1*) hammer and finished the two of them off.
---
That was a struggle... On a side note, when do you start getting legendary weapons with more than 1 star?
---
Maybe .. Or maybe not, we'll never know. Hopefully, it'll be released at some point. One can only hope.
---
Yes to everything, but I dropped instantly. 
---
But thats fine. If you like that high end armor is the same as no armor at all, enjoy it.
---
Except the vendor will spawn at a different location each week (like Xur, according to the data miners) so setting up camp next to him may not be feasible.
---
EA had nothing to do with Anthem's failure; it was and is 100% on Bioware. They dicked around with no direction for 4.5 years before crunching for 1.5 years on what was released. Hell, without EA's CEO, they wouldn't even have had the flying mechanic in the game.
---
Yes, for once, EA is not the bad guy.
---
It's like shooting fireballs from the palm of your hand.. and your on fire, the lands on fire... Hell the fire is on fire..  
---
But in all honesty, I want to be able to make this eventually.
---
They're not going to add more. They want you to spend real money on atoms. They're becoming more and more greedy.
---
&gt; Aquaboy. You don‚Äôt take radiation from water and you can‚Äôt drown.
---
When is this really an issue though?
---
I found a bag full of 1&amp;2 star leg armour and weapons at the station once. About 800lbs worth of stuff.
---
Hell yea this would force people to become friends  or interact with them
---
I do.
---
I am trying to keep my (actual) expectations within the realm of likelihood.
---
Yep!  Dog food is my only food source because it doesn't spoil and it feeds me, with good doggy perk, like a quarter of my bar.
---
I bought both games on release for full price, I regret getting Anthem. I knew even with 76 things would be rocky because of that letter Todd Howard put out. At the time I thought that was a mistake, like they were showing weakness and were going to get review bombed for it, but now I think that was definitely the right way to go.
---
As cool as Anthem felt when it worked, it's not a great game in any respect. The dialogue trees are meaningless and the story is a cliche riddled mess that seems to drag down the pace of the game. On PS4 it feels like Loading Screens: The Game. That and I am completely burned out on this "looter shooter" trend of doing the same exact content a hundred times for random drops. It works for MMOs because there's a whole world of it. Not for something that's in glorified early access and has nothing better to do in it.
---
I just gifted a kick-ass level 1 pipe pistol to a level 2 player the other day, and they actually didn't run away and figured out to come LOOK IN THE DAMNED BAG.
---
'Bout time.
---
Anything less than this will be an utter failure and will force me to quit the game for about 8 hours minimum.
---
shh bby is ok
---
I used to shoot at the bag too but i guess putting on a demo of how the TSE Handmade works kind of scared most of them off.
---
At least they brought their own TP and didn't use your sheets!
---
It‚Äôs a problem.
---
I've got this thing now where I try to Tab out of every menu I see.
---
Broken. Annoyingly. If you‚Äôve ever fast travelled to a one of those locations as part of a event or something, before you discovered it then it won‚Äôt apply.
---
I always ignored it in previous games because of, well, the mess but as everything meatpiles in this game it doesn't really matter.
---
Swimming in some areas or when building a camp in toxic water
---
Yeah it‚Äôs really unfortunate. What do you suggest to stop this?
---
I got one of those recently as well, but mine is a supressor's splodey damage and one more that I can't remember at this point in time
---
I‚Äôm right there with you, I have over 800 hours played and multiple friends with 600+. Not one of us nor anyone we know, have had this happen to them. This smells like 900 hours guy that was ‚Äúwrongfully‚Äù banned even tho he made reddit posts of picking up 30k spring and everyone just read his post and took it for face value. Instead of clicking his name and looking at post history.
---
Agreed, anything less than this will cause me to flood the vendors with garbage and completely destroy the rolling pin market.
---
With all the negative press (and most notably the now infamous Kotaku article) i'm not surprised 3 upper management have left.
---
I'd put my guess on the future updates been removed due to the delay to their roadmap plan ( more details here  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/bgkgl3/update\_on\_anthem\_from\_the\_development\_team/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/bgkgl3/update_on_anthem_from_the_development_team/) ), to claim this is showing Anthem as "no longer been supported" is a tad excessive.
---
I played FO76 at launch as well as Anthem at Launch, and have to say both games got some unnecessarily high levels of hate, but comments such as yours (mentioned earlier) are exactly the kind of things that throw fuel to ever raging fire that is game hate.
---
I'm no delusional fanboy for Anthem, ( it's what i'm playing atm but that's due to getting a new puppy and Anthem being an easy pick up and play game) and it will take some serious work to get into a better game, but it's no worse than FO76 was on release (need i mention the constant sub 5 FPS moments on console?).
---
Both games released in a subpar state for a supposedly AAA title, that's undeniable however.
---
Well i go in murder sprees with my minigun and T-60 P.A.
---
kinda like when I used to run from nuke zones, now I run to them :)
---
  Although I did get that little rush last night when SB caught me in the open -  I only had a tree to hide behind.  That was a fun fight.
---
Some players are also probably hoarding it for the Legendary vendor.  I know I was, to a point, then I realized that running around with a full carry weight and a full Stash was really annoying.
---
I sell legendaries im not using. Can‚Äôt wait for the legendary vendor. Just 21 days now, right? ü§©
---
I think they will tie into the atomic shop...   we shall see.  I hope I‚Äôm wrong
---
That‚Äôs really awesome. Wife and I used to game together on the weekends. years later gaming is not where we share free time anymore. 
---
I like the new gift emote and need to remember to use it. I mostly have everything in surplus but fusion cores.
---
I landed in from a fast travel, ran up the hill and got the rewards lol. I was like oh okay. Never even saw the Brahmin or the Sheepsquatch ü§£ just fast traveled back home and read my new schematics lol
---
Now that you mention it there are some similarities, yes.
---
The fact that I played D3 for 3k+ hours might have something to do with it.
---
One thing that game had in spades was RNG so it might have inadvertently become my source of ideas for RNG heavy mechanics.
---
Dude theres something brown sticking to your nose
---
first thing you need: go to fort pricket and grab a civil war top hat and the union uniform. (and a black powder pistol, in case you go see a play)
---
Weirdly, I've come across both my Instigating and Bloodied Meat Hooks at the Artisan's Corner vendor.  Just 1\* goods, but I think anyone knows that in the right hands, both do ridiculous damage.  That Instigating Meat Hook does something like 1,400 on the first hit for me and has become my go-to killing weapon, saving the durability on my Bloodied arsenal.
---
It's ok but....was so damn difficult doing the animation with the characters pointing the damn finger to the ground ? Most of time, people are trying to help don't even find the bag and run away......
---
Yeah....everyone will be selling their repair kids.
---
-sorry couldn't resist the pun.
---
It stays on the same server
---
Awesome!!
---
At least it wasn't a drill
---
If you're getting quoted 120k caps, I assume you're talking about a **legacy** legendary gatling laser?
---
Completely unrelated in a way but I saying the same thing between Destiny and Anthem. The ‚Äúit‚Äôs a clone but it‚Äôll do better than Destiny by miles‚Äù and the childish ‚ÄúI hate Bungie, they lost a lot when they gave up Halo and this is their own doing. Now they have to compete with a company that knows what the players want‚Äù so much of that has come back to bite me hard but my wallet and wife are extremely grateful I didn‚Äôt get Anthem day one (or at all) as I was waiting for reviews. I learned my lesson with No Man‚Äôs Sky but despite that I still got Fallout 76 day one PURELY for the collector‚Äôs edition and didn‚Äôt care if the in-game experience left more to be desired. After 2 weeks after launch I didn‚Äôt touch the game again until halfway into Fasnacht, a lot has improved since and can enjoy the game more often in my free time now.
---
So that‚Äôs my unrelated but related story over and it‚Äôs amazing how Anthem had one job to make a deep and immersive looter shooter but told Bethesda to hold their beer instead. Luckily Fallout isn‚Äôt delaying features for months without communication, 2-3 weeks at worst.
---
Lol bruh i server hopped all day to find this guy... no luck
---
Mines glitchy from party chat preferences. Party has to be set to in game, then you have to leave and delete all party chat groups/invitations. Then in the in game menu change it to either auto or proximity chat. Took me 3 months to figure this out.
---
I killed over 70 deathclaws
---
Sorry for late reply, but actually I think there was one thing. Everything on my computer is the same.
---
But, I have mobile connection. Usually I've used an USB stick, because it's more reliable. But roughly at the same time as this problem started, I needed to get a wlan for my smartphone. So I switched into to pocket mobile router which can create wlan for the phone to use. It has battery and it's connected to my computer via USB, the wlan is only for the phone.
---
It doesn't really make any sense why that would have any effect. In both cases, they are connected to my computer via USB, and both apprear as virtual network interface. Both of them have their own IP and give my computer a private IP, and either way the operator has NAT anyway. They are both acting as router/gateway anyway even though the USB stick can only serve one device.
---
But the timing of changing that device, roughtly matches to when I started to have this problem in Fallout 76. So there's good chance it has something to do with it. 
---
Maybe the operator doesn't have an NAT actually? It's a bit hard to test. Maybe the've give up on it. And the game would require ability to be connected from the internet to function completely. Maybe it's just the wlan router doing it's internal NAT, and because it can serve several devises, it doens't know which one should receive any outbound connection. And the USB stick automatically passes anything from the internet, to the computer.
---
I couldn't exactly see any settings that I could edit.  The wlan router does have some, but all the firewall features were off already.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to turn my 300 rolling pins and 500 wood legs into massive amount of chips and use them to reroll my three-star stalker‚Äôs MG42 into another bloodied explosive one üí™
---
Okay there is a new trick for my trolling bag.. :D
---
im the opposite, i want MORE high level enemies, scale them up to lvl 90!  we need a challenge!
---
The fissure site between Watoga and Fissure Prime has a dead one next to it.
---
I dissent from all 3* dropping 3*. However I do agree the sbq, the most resource intensive fight, ammo intensive fight, should always drop a 3*. 
---
If all 3* dropped a 3*, there would be little to no point in farming the queen. Just a whitespring run and get all the goodies. 3* should be rare and the "final boss" of the game should have that guarantee.
---
Currently it's about ~10euros on those game keys gray market websites.
---
Well, I couldn't say no to the 3,000 rounds of 5mm someone left behind.  Thanks for that, whoever you are!
---
Also, it's nice not needing to craft syringes for the Endangerol Syringer.
---
There was one server where someone went through and packed seemingly every container with 1\* goodies.  I don't recall if ended up taking anything, but I thought that was kind.
---
Wow... im going right now lol
---
If it worked this way, you'd basically be forcing everyone to run a max luck build.  Legendary gear makes or breaks the end game, and everyone should have the same chances at them, regardless of SPECIAL stats.
---
Now if only those chances weren't so miserably slim to begin with...
---
Well you \*can\* drop it but a popup appears saying "if you drop this it will be destroyed"
---
2 &amp; 3 star bosses if you're lucky.
---
I believe ores would save on weight as well.
---
No clue what that means, but I suppose that's what people have said.
---
To me, they say its a "vendor" so I think its literally just gonna sell a random stock of legendary weapons/armor ect...  
---
I think you have to cash in legendary items to get the tokens to pay for these items, with 1 token for every star of legendary you cash in.  
---
  
---
An explosive weapon might be like 500 tokens for instance, so you need to cash in 500 stars worth of legendary items to get a single point of explosive effect on a weapon, or something to that effect.  
---
Of course I could be entirely wrong, but the name "Legendary Vendor" makes it sound like a normal vendor like we have now, but with specialized currency and stock
---
"It should work ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è "
---
That said, if you want to take them down in a faster way, go with something like the Gatling Gun.  The most I used to have was a Lever Action Rifle and that thing took forever to plink their HP down.  The Gatling Gun hits just as hard, and fires at a very steady rate.
---
And in case the megasloth in cranberry bog challenge turns up again there's a dead one of those ate fissure prime.
---
what is the point of this post? do you not like floating bases or something?
---
 we could do waaaaaay more crazy building things in fo4 than 76
---
&gt;Comment 
---
I have been playing fo for decades and have never used the blocking ability. I guess I should learn.
---
&gt; I found a Vampires Cultist dagger
---
Oh, I'm so jealous!
---
plain L45  Cultist dagger is my standard weapon - with a vampire switchblade as backup.
---
Would be really nice to toy with a vampire cultist dagger....
---
Is this fact?
---
How come this is a new phenomenon? They should reverse that ish lol
---
One of us.
---
 Been gone for two weeks, wondered what was going on, read this, saw they just flat ignored the community on repair kits, am glad I‚Äôm still gone.
---
See you in maybe a few weeks. Borderlands 2 still fun.
---
Late to the party, but I would also buy the fuck out of it RL.
---
Since they increased the max caps for vendors, I'm seeing paper bags less and less.
---
This seems to happen to me every other time I get a code piece
---
They drop off starred legendary enemies with more than one star. -Sometimes- Don't count on three stars actually bothering to drop three star loot 'cause a lot of the time they dont &gt;&lt;
---
I expect something like Patn of exile: You get token from legendary, and you get a reroll for afixe/prefixe, with a lot of RNG involved.
---
On a side note, I don't mind having hard time to get 3\* legendaries, I just want more (various) end game content at this time.
---
i clicked on this expecting to actually increase my ingame store space
---
And if it does take the form of some kind of re-roll, don‚Äôt get too annoyed if your almost perfect 3* turns into something worse
---
Tytytyty alpha at fissure worked
---
I typically use my dragon on the thrusters, then anything other weapon whenever it's crippled.
---
I‚Äôm EST and only on during the afternoon
---
I find random camp modules with nothing but a stash box closer to them than that.
---
I've been reading a lot of comments on this subject the past couple of weeks, and some of the things stated as known, as well as most of the speculation simply baffles me, Consider these facts as you read and ponder what may come next week.
---
1. Nothing has been published (or Data Mined) describing how the system will work.
---
2. Speculation about Coins &amp; Tokens comes from a brief statement by Todd Howard about "How it may work" before the Developer's even got started on it.
---
3. Every legendary Weapon has 5 Perk Slots, Data mining and existing Mods tell us that includes slots for a Prefix, 2 Major, &amp; 2 minor Modifiers, so unless 5\* weapons are slated to drop in some future added content, why would we not be getting the ability to add additional Perks to weapons.
---
4. Due mostly to Duping, but also to the hoarding of legendary weapons, there is currently a massive amount of gear in the game, that according to Bethesda, causes server instability, so it's in their interest to remove as much as possible.
---
My Speculation:
---
1. Gaining Legendary Tokens, Coins, Points, or whatever currency will be used, will require turning in a lot of existing legendary items.
---
2. The legendary Vendor will Likely sell Legendary mods (Major &amp; Minor Modifiers) that you can add to existing legendary items, the program mechanics were already in place for this in FO4, so it makes since that they would utilize that rather than create an entirely new mechanic.
---
3. Whatever comes will make some players happy, and others Furious, (Oh wait, that's not speculation, that's an absolute fact)
---
That's my 2 caps worth, anyway.
---
looks like you missed this thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bjazzq/bug_and_proof_of_disappearing_power_armor_pieces/
---
If it‚Äôs completely RNG, there‚Äôs no way I get consistent wood armor pieces from the imposter sheepsquatch out of a dozen battles, because the wood armor pieces is a tiny percentage of the overall gigantic loot pool. There‚Äôs really only one scenario - the poor loot quality is 100% by design on Bethesda‚Äôs part.
---
horribly still.
---
I've picked up camp plans and (unspoiled) flux at artisans corner.
---
Found an almost full fusion core in a trash can last night.
---
Find a cool new place, I know that sucks but I‚Äôve learned to deal, I found a dank dark hole where PvP players can‚Äôt physically get to. But it‚Äôs also the perfect place for player vending. Lots of traffic. And I have a Nukashine punch bowl out. Life is good.
---
For Sure. That would be swell!
---
Related, a few weeks ago I happened along a group of traders who all had their bases somewhat lined along the golf course. It was interesting and they said it took a few hours to get everyone in.
---
YMMV.  For me, the last week has been awesome.  If anything, I'm getting more crashes than disconnects, mainly when entering buildings.  But as long as I have a friend, I'm able to rejoin the server just fine.  The servers themselves aren't failing and kicking everyone off, like they did in the past.  It's client-side crashing these days, which is probably a more manageable problem.
---
Hah. That's awesome. THAT is how you mess with someone in game... not by destroying their stuff. This is perfect.
---
I'm dying laughing here.
---
Honestly... Bethesda would never do this because people like me would just use it to farm caps. If they did, they'd have to remove purified water as an item you could vendor and I wouldn't be okay with that.
---
I agree with you, I just don't see it happening easily. I pray and make daily sacrifices to the RNG GODS!
---
Maybe they are cleaning up some of the super items . Did you buy it or find it yourself?
---
At least when I break in to people's houses, I only leave propaganda flyers
---
You get judged by /u/Fluxxen.
---
Yep, that's it.  Just them.  BUT THAT COUNTS!
---
It means the laser is explosive, which is a perk that was removed from future drops of laser weapons as of that patch a while ago.
---
Found it myself.
---
I don't recall if I mentioned this, but I run on wireless as well despite being on PC. It's just not feasible for me to run a line to my room nor to set up in the same room as the internet set up.
---
I have a theory that my issue stems from not having forwarded ports. I wonder if moving my PC temporarily would allow me to forward those ports, or more importantly; if I did that would they remain forwarded once i move my PC back to it's usual location.
---
What about a square area AND the possibility to build closer to each other...?
---
Would be cool to walk through appalachia and out of nowhere you stumble across a small player settlement
---
Want some? I‚Äôm on PS4, will gift ya a bunch.
---
How weird I literally made a wired roof for my husband's camp last week!! Fallout 4 nostalgia
---
Yea, it was a 3* TSE. I found it waaay before those patches when going around the world.
---
RNG is a bitch
---
everyone wants the gjallahorn, not eveyone is gonna get the gjallahorn
---
No worries
---
You better have STASH written in big neon letters on the side.
---
DO NOT use the in-game function option to "Find Another World". More often than not it spits you back out on the same server.
---
Go to the main menu and re-enter from there. Sometimes to try and guarantee a different server I'll scroll through the Atom Shop for a few seconds, then re-enter.
---
Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Sorry.
---
I finished leveling up an alt last weekend, dropped my nuke on Whitespring, wandered around killing things and gathering flowers for about an hour, didn't crash once.
---
At the cost of, didn't get \*one\* three star ghoul to spawn, once. Got a lot of legendaries but all one star. :shrug: I guess I'll take it.
---
Haha! Good luck! ;)
---
yeah ive had all these issues on ps4,  like you said only way to fix it is to totally restart
---
I have been running around with this PA on and never noticed this. That is awesome!
---
It took me several tries and spots and nights of server hopping until I stopped running around and just started switching servers. 
---
My best advice is go to the teapot and keep server hopping. They spawn in a corpse inventory lying on top of the lower picnic bench.  
---
If the corpse isn‚Äôt there jump servers.
---
And he has a brown ring around his neck

[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Brewing\_and\_distilling](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Brewing_and_distilling)
---
Change your Bethesda password. Don't you think it's odd your god tier weapons vanish and nothing else?
---
I quit every night for 16+ hours . Fk this game
---
120k? for one gun? '
---
after 400 hours playing, i kinda feel like finding another game to play, that shit is ridiculous
---
Everyone keeps complaining about this but keep forgetting the "fix" to this is the legendary vendor and it's been in the works for several months. 3 stars are supposed to be rare, if we got 3 star drops from every 3 star mob then you're essentially making everything else worthless.
---
I've only found one and it had a pack of duct tape, 3 loose screws, ballistic fiber and a boxing glove, left the glove for someone else, I'm happy with my ski sword modded with metal shards, but I still thought it was pretty cool.
---
So i went to my camp, still had the gun in my inventory and logged out.
---
And when i was logged out i transferred it ? because i had the weapon when i logged out.
---
This is why some people went ‚Äòmelee build‚Äô, not because it‚Äôs more enjoyable, but because ammo is costly and so is repairing weapons. Melee build is the ultimate answer to all the hassles. 
---
Now if you think about it, melee‚Äôs only real expense is energy (muscle work), so if you run a ‚Äòmelee build‚Äô, you should need a lot more food and water to maintain the strength and AP. There‚Äôs an idea for you Bethesda to make the game more interesting.
---
Get the government to subsidize game development, so that game companies can operate on a not-for-profit basis?
---
AMEN
---
I don‚Äôt really know what to expect, my current impressions are either Rerolling the current prefixes of a weapon either all 3 at once or 1 at a time OR you‚Äôre selling legendaries for currency that can be exchanged for a new Legendary with preset and random legendary effects like a lucky dip at [X Tokens] per depending on the weapon you‚Äôre buying and the legendary effects applied.
---
Example a level 10 Instigating 10mm Pistol would cost 2 tokens for the gun and 5 tokens for title prefix, making it cost a total of 7 Tokens.
---
In comparison A level 45 Two Shot w/Explosive and +15% Reload Handmade would cost 10 tokens for the gun, 10 for the title prefix, 10 for the primary subfix and 4 for the secondary subfix costing a total of 34 Tokens
---
I literally just got a zealots LMG with 25% faster fire rate and primed it based on the above persons work, the thing slices through scorchbeast and I'm not even perked for heavy guns.
---
Why? It's still literally the best place to nuke for legendary loot. Just because you're getting shit loot doesn't mean it's whitesprings fault lol. If you want to farm legendaries, it's the place you go. If you're not talking nuke zone farming, then there are a few other options.
---
Do you know, in around 400 hours, I have never seen a 2 star legendary, it's the weirdest thing, I see some 1 stars and loads of 3 stars (that drop garbage) but no 2 stars. I'm convinced that all the decent drops come from 2 stars!
---
So many challenges are broken. Especially for people who started playing early on.
---
I I think I have it. What platform? I'll check my stash if you're on xbox
---
I think I'm well on my way to earning grin and bear it....
---
I was quite amused by some of the Tombraider trophies...stupid stuff, but I was compelled to get them :
---
Was that necessary?  Kill a small animal (squirrel, etc) with an explosive
---
Rotiserie! - kill an in flight chicken with a flaming arrow
---
Another for tossing a bottle in the air then shooting it with a pistol before it hits the ground.
---
There's enough strange things in FO to do stuff like that....
---
Although BGS is doing some of it via dailies (kill a wendigo while wearing a clown costume, etc), just with no trophy....
---
I also imagine it'll be similar in overall results but not nearly as pretty of a UI. I believe they've already referenced that you turn in legendaries and get coins in exchange and then you use the coins to re-roll other legendaries.
---
I hope no one pays you that much, ever. They are 5-12k area depending on 3rd perk.
---
I LOVE YOU! ty! :3
---
How does it get fixed simple answer, quit being stingy pricks and give us fair challenges and a fair payout, period.
---
I'm really cynical that they'll change anything even if players complain. I have been wrong before, so I hope I am here. They keep setting thier daily challenges for example to be alcohol related or related to the new camera mechanic. To me those are useless because they're not fun. It's all a grind. 
---
That's all most games have turned into since they want you to spend countless hours to grind so that you can buy stuff OR spend your hard earned real money (or parents hard earned money in the cases of the yutes). I'm sorry, I've worked my butt off to make this money and I spent $60 on this game and I don't get to keep enough of it as it is. If there's an easy challenge like drink a nuka cola yeah I'll do that but I'm not going to spend an hour hunting an animal to take a picture of it in an area of that map I have no need or desire to be in. I get that they're challenges, and they're intended to he a bit of an unofficial side quest but I'm not about the time I have to sink into some of them. No thanks. I'm an adult, I don't have time for that.
---
Did ISS the other day, some asshole spammed the corpse with explosives and it was invisible to begin with. I had to spend 10 minutes looking for the corpse to finally get my loot... I got super lucky with a 1* junkies rolling pin. Lovely, time well spent.
---
Someone plays 100 hours here and there, randomly gets OP weapon (almost always an explosive).
---
Another person plays 600, every day, and has a much better perk build and armor but still gets face rolled.
---
That's not random that's broken. I don't need a gjallahorn, just something equally strong. Or even a counter (fireproof park doesn't do it). Right now there is only 1 option and it's reliant on luck.
---
neat tool! thanks for this!
---
Let me guess, you have a nice view into the golf club house yes?
---
Did they confirm that was for the legendary vendor, I thought that was an assumption? BUt either way, people will have their bases near by.
---
I'm not that annoyed at 3\* enemies having the ability to drop non-3\* items.  I'd obviously prefer it the other way, but it's not like they are tougher to beat, or that I did anything special to encounter them in the first place.
---
It should be commensurate with work.  For bosses specifically, like the Scorchbeast Queen and Imposter Sheepsquatch, there should be a guarantee of one.  You expend a fair bit of resources with the SBQ.  The initiator pays almost 2,000 to fight the Imposter.  Why be stingy?  Besides, it's not like all 3\* drops are useful.  Let's be honest: most aren't.
---
I have a tool box full of Drills
---
That locked room should be interpeted as future place (of minor importance) for the election event. Isn't that clearly so. The room is some presidental suit or whatever, can't remember, and the election is likely for president. So once you get elected you get to the room and there's mayby fancy sigar there. Probably nothing noteworty to loot, as any loot would likely be handled as event reward.
---
Or if it's never released/opened, you could imagine that's where Modus fusebox/mains swictch is located.
---
That dude deserves a lot more recognition. That calculator and the list of vs effects is probably the most useful thing that was posted on this subreddit. 
---
Also for some reason it never occurred to me that i can still use heavy guns even if i'm not perked for them... Thank you :D
---
Dude, you are a totally refusing to see the point. 
---
Like, not just disagreement, but total blindness. 
---
I get it though, you thought you were buying the ability to be invulnerable like Superman while anything you glance at dies, a d you are having some buyer's remorse. 
---
Your fancy paid for armor isn't useless. It's not the same as underwear as you say. It's top of the line but there are top of the line options in weaponry, perks, and skill that can punch through it. 
---
That's a good thing, not a flaw in the design. Superman isn't completly invulnerable. He still has a few very well known weaknesses. Because otherwise it would be boring. For everyone- but especially the person that actually can't be hurt.
---
Me too... Literally, I wrote this post more for myself than anyone else.
---
I have to say, as a whole FO76 at least had some good parts to it compared to what's going with Anthem.  Yes, I took a few months off because of major connectivity issues (where every time I zoned I would get disconnected - fun when doing certain quests that reset) but Bethesda has at least done something to try to improve the situation.  While communication may not be top notch they at least show they are listening.
---
Bioware on the other hand...
---
Is it bad that I read that with an orks voice in my head from warhammer 40k lol
---
That would surprise me... If anything they may allow you to buy "coins" but I don't see that happening.
---
I‚Äôd be ok with being able to put sentry tread on PA as ‚Äúlegs‚Äù
---
What did it originally say?
---
So I assume there is no fix then.
---
A similar thing has happened to me since a couple of weeks ago. I can barely hear my teammates in game chat. But they can hear me fine. Upon log in, chat volume in settings defaults to 0. And pushing chat volume all the way up in doesn't fix it. Turning headset volume all the way up doesn't help either. I've reset my PS4 and rebuilt the database. Nothing helped.
---
Same on PC, was wondering why I recieved team invites from other players but couldnt see them. Didnt know had to relog till playing with a friend.
---
how is it ok you can one shot someone with an explosive shotgun but cant with an OP melee? how is that fair to melee players?
---
Nope they dont care at all. Bethesda created a game specifically so they could watch and laugh at your misfortune...
---
The very well may be. Whatever way it is... it won't be an easy exchange.
---
It's not my only one. And I'm on XBox.
---
Guess they have to protect their profit... Bummer. Otherwise I'd build them for you
---
NO, I was just going to ask for a picture tour but then read you moved it.
---
You're telling me. I get on every once in a while to screw around. I don't play rigorously. It was just a weapon I used to screw around with low level enemies.
---
1 rank of power user and it hardly touches fusion cores
---
marsupial + jetpack = glide looong distances and climbs great
---
Who shit the bed?
---
It's yours, yup lvl 50. I'll dm you my gt in a bit
---
I'll give you 10K if you're on XBox.
---
Assassins is outright useless when players are all wearing duped magic armors in pvp. Make it +30% at least to be somewhat useful. I see lots of ‚Äòassassins‚Äô  garbage dumped at vendor bots every day.
---
&gt; TLDR; In my opinion, one of the biggest issues facing fall out 76 is that in the late game the only way to make yourself top teir powerful is luck. This needs to be changed so that dedicated players to the game are rewarded for loyaly playing every day. Give us a pathway to getting stronger as opposed to making us gamble for power.
---
Something something ... Legendary Vendor is coming
---
With severe restrictions on how often you can reroll.
---
I don't think this game has any end game content as the game itself isn't designed to "end". I like that they have been adding interesting content every few weeks, and a lot of unannounced side quests and whatnot. The true end game content of this game is simply... adventuring.
---
i can feel you 
---
honestly i never had a big issue with the rng as it is because im not interested in pvp whatsoever and thats why i really enjoy the game because exept for the sbq or the sheepsquatch imposter you can get along with a decent build without legendarys if you want to
---
however i can see how people who want to play pvp are dissapointed
---
the thing is that when it was announced that 76 is gonna be online there was an outrage of fallout fans who stated they dont want pvp in a fallout game
---
thats why the pvp elements ended up so poorly imo
---
the pvp servers are a good solution thats implemented quite wrong i think 
---
the servers should be free from any legendarys at all and you shouldnt be able to transfer your andventuremode characters
---
Fingers crossed
---
Part of the multiple build issue is the stash limit. It's hard to collect things in this game in my opinion. It would be fun to have full sets of enemy specific armors and such.
---
This is awesome!! Mind if we share on the Fallout twitter next week? :)
---
Enclave officer hat, Welding goggles, camo bandana and hunters longcoat
---
I didn't get explosive weapons to drop till I bought one.
---
oh he was just raging against the machine
---
I have seen a ton of people trading their ass/sent gear for unyielding/sent . Idk if they just want to pve more or they know something I don‚Äôt
---
Abe Lincoln looks like Keith Richards 50 years ago........
---
I can't find my drill, I think my daughter borrowed it.
---
Oh, wait, you're talking about in the game...
---
Absolutely... I don't see it having an "undo" type of feature at all. I'm already getting annoyed with just the thought of the amount of posts about the legendary vendor ruining someone's build.
---
&gt; With a prime receiver that thing outperforms Anti-Armor Explosive Handmade equipped with a prime receiver. Believe it or not but against the SBQ it's even better than a TSE primed.
---
Most things out perform AA. I have no fucking clue why it's such a popular legendary. That being said, it's not better than TSE. TSE is a 65% damage increase and hunters is a 55% damage increase against the right mobs. Remember, that website isn't gospel truth, I've found several incorrect things on it. For instance, it says that lever action rifles shoot .5 times per second. In this case TSE applies the explosive damage twice, but the website doesn't do that due to how it's set up.
---
I guess I'm always too slow because people in the Uranium Fever always one shot the supervisors. I guess I  gotta be fast enough to squeeze one bullet through their shotgun pellets.
---
Nah its just a few bastards that will do that. Good shit OP let em know.

 &gt; This is awesome!! Mind if we share on the Fallout twitter next week? :)
---
I know that there is some attitude with some players that tilting the loot tables in our favor would be making the game too easy, but the way this game is structured and the fact that there is still a LOT of duped god-tier loot floating around, something needs to be done. It's a video game, and any player should be able to organically (ie, not buy duped gear online) aquire max level gear eventually.  The way RNG works in this game, you're never really guaranteed anything. A level 200 guy has the same chances at good drops as a level 80, and that's just not how it should work.
---
We have axes and black powder rifles that's all we need
---
I found Ft Defiance (the Asylum) well before I found Abbys Bunker.  
---
But when I cleared Abbys, I got a quest to "find Ft Defiance".... and the diamond marker for the quest in on Camp Venture (which I haven't discovered yet)
---
While hunters isn't that bad, fibblezz is misinformed, hunters/explosive is not stronger than TSE.
---
That clears up nothing...
---
No problem! thanks a lot :D
---
Definitely nice to be able to mix and match the skins. I've seen some interesting combos. I noticed the weird sound effects pretty quick. The bone skin for the excavator makes weird sounds when you do the super hero landing also.
---
kill them, and holotape their last words
---
Or is it so that your mom doesn't walk in on you.......again?
---
..but it's hilarious!  thanks for the lulz
---
hi, thanks for the reply  i have vanguard 3*  just switched from 3* unyielding.. dont like running low i never really used it .i am always in PA .now i want to use armor .still have my unyielding just waiting to complete my vanguard. im rebuiling my guy and like melee and shot gun.but need sniper for scorched beast . i dont know how to build my guy. that why i like yours it take me for ever to kill a scorch beast and there level 50..i just want a better build . i dont want a god build .just want to explore and not to worry about  relying  on stims and rad x all the time.. i go thru them alot and always thirsty.. i understand the concept a lil just wasting perks trying to get my guy working properly  . didnt realize you can mix  armor.. im at work so i cant tell you my cards .i keep adjusting them.curious whats your stats i know i have 15 on strength and 6 on luck(2 starched jeans and  3 on  class freak and 1 on serendipity
---
You gon give it to them?
---
This is hilarious!
---
Ah ok. Thats very interesting and i forgot about fallout 3.
---
my favorite "NPC" in the game by far. Really makes up for how annoying Rose is.
---
Use the trading subreddits and trade for what you want.
---
The Crew I run with gets a lot of that, we are efficient, and well organized 6-12 players most evenings, we do a lot of events, and launch a lot of Nukes.
---
We take out the Imposter very quickly, and have Killing the SBQ down to about a 3.5 minute average which means you have about 5 minutes warning to get down there and get involved.
---
If you show up late to find the event complete, too bad, go launch a nuke yourself, or get there early next time.
---
Enforcer perk is bae
---
You should still secure your account. Don't you think it's a bit of a coincidence that when you found out you had a gold mine of a weapon it suddenly vanished from your inventory?
---
I think this might be the way it goes. I was thinking he probably will sell items with fixed stats, similar to the legendary weapons they reward in survival. Each star gives you a token and the stuff he sells will cost a set amount of tokens.  Like selling the medical malpractice gun (but I bet they are un-named) for 50 tokens or something. Either this or he will sell mods for each type of legendary stat. I bet his stock resets each week as well.
---
With it set up this way it gives players a chance to get a legendary with known stats and levels.  It also makes a player log in and play to continue the grind.  
---
As long as the stuff he sells is decent I will use it.
---
For something that was free? :(
---
Then again id gladly build stuff like that for other people. I want everyone to have the War Paint PA. Even though im F2P I decided that was worth a buy as its cool :)
---
RP is such fun to have, sometimes when I get surrounded by ghouls and when they slap me on the back they end up committing suicide lol
---
I have very low expectations...read none...for this until we are told exactly how it works. I fully expect it to be a pricy cap sink though.
---
It does tho. How many posts have you seen crying about it? You just don‚Äôt know how to use it
---
Damn, so If I buy an EU key, I cant play in NA. My friend and I want the game but we dont want to spend 40+ on it since it seems rather unstable and not a good thing to invest in but 10 dollars for an EU key sounds good but were both NA.
---
How am I supposed to secure my account, exactly?
---
I get you. A wile back I lost my legendary machine gun and MY CALIBRATED SHOCK X-01 LEG. I was SO upsetty. I messaged support and they responded with basically "to bad, so sad". Not really that, but you get my drift. I rage quit for a good 2 months, until my friend (who is a Bethesda employee, but works on a different game) spent a ton of time farming a new one for me. &lt;3. He told me that they probably don't have the resources to do that sort of thing "yet". PERSONALLY I would think that would be a high priority for them.... but what do I know.... &gt;:/
---
All other way of doing this is adding light or ultra-light to armour pieces.
---
Search for this question and you'll find it's been answered many times.
---
Yes, by end game I mean, more places where we can do something effective past lvl 50.
---
Each time I log on, I see that half server is in whitespring, this does not feels right.
---
Wat?
---
Well when you add jetpack on top of marsupial you can reach even higher spots too high for only one of them.
---
I run a bloodied / low health build.  I have all unyielding armor pieces with deep pocketed as well as maxed out rifleman and sneak attack.  I also have the radicool perk card which ups my strength with higher rads levels.  I dabble in two handed melee and shotgunner with level 3 enforcer for when I've been discovered and need to immobilize enemies.  When my health is down to about 30-40 my strength is at 27.  I can carry 410 pounds outside of power armor (level 3 strongback helps).  I have a level one sneak perk too.  I rock a vampire's combat shotgun, two lever rifles, one mutant slayer's and one anti armor splodey one.  I have a bloodied spiked fire axe and my trusty spiked wiffle bat.  I carry a 10mm splodey troubleshooter's pistol too just in case.  And a bloodied handmade which I only use for the big enemies.  I am mutated to the moon and back too which helps
---
they go for about 1k on the forums don't blow your caps.
---
Well you can listen to a holotape on an assaultron dressed up as a sheep snu-snuing a man to death.
---
There is that.
---
I pretty much agree with everything you say, but just for fun:
---
1&amp;2) Todd commenting/speculating on how it might work... literally is published, it's how we know he said it ;) 
---
3) We already have the ability to add a 4th star to some weapons, so I'm not sure having available slots makes a valid argument for what the legendays vendor will be. To that point none of us know.
---
4&amp;1) It most definitely will require turning in large amounts of items for a return of a single piece. In whatever method that exchange occurs.
---
2) That would be nice, but doesn't fit the MO of what Beth has done with this game already.
---
3)It will be a mod post restricting the related hate posts, a mega thread of hate sharing and a Beth is listening sticky post to share your thought. Very similar to the repair kit news.
---
I see what you did there and have return my 2 caps as well.
---
be well
---
Ghost launcher? haha honestly couldn't find an exact reference for what she was carrying so ended up just piling a bunch of crates and stuff
---
I need those. My PSN is the same as it is on here
---
Not just the stash limit, but the fact there's no shared inventory system between characters. I've got 20K 10mm rounds on me, and I want to transfer that over to a new alt and go with an Ian build (leather armor, 10mm pistol) but to do that I have to find somebody I trust to hand over all that ammo and my gear. 
---
I shouldn't be forced to have to give other people my gear to hold onto just to transfer it between characters. Or be like my friends and buy a second account to have a transfer mule.
---
Whaaat no way! What's yours if I can ask?
---
It looks like it has the classic 12mm pistol molded on it. I am hoping we get it and more classic fallout weapons as skins.
---
How did I "use it wrong"?
---
Bos ass cav armor, full health and relevant perks, dropped instantly. How did I use it wrong?
---
üëçüëç
---
How does the star level work. Is it based on your own level?
---
Good luck with your support ticket. I had this happen to me (several times in fact) and I was basically told by support that I did something and they couldn‚Äôt help me. Even though the gun in question was placed securely in my stash not to be touched until I had finished my dream perk card build for the weapon. 
---
I hope you get another god tier weapon somehow.  We (the fucked) have to stick together. Cheers
---
Now only if I could find the standard Raider armor plans to craft them
---
ü§£that's promising
---
Not at all, imo. It's only in honor of America turning 300, hence the 1776-2076 on the chest, as well as the stars from the pre-war flag on the arms. The Enclave doesn't use straight-up American imagery for other things, so I don't see them doing it here. They'd just use their own insignia.
---
I was so excited for Red Dead online. There's literally no content in there and they keep trying to push boring PVP gamemodes onto you.
---
Bethesda website has all the updates if you just checked lol. Bloodied build.
---
Sure, but many of the gjallahorns weren't RNG; they were duped. Those who played and traded early got gjallahorns for a pittance of caps. Those easy cap deals are long-gone, but the imbalance remains, particularly in PVP. 
---
The legendary vendor might get us out of this hole, but it may not be enough. We may need to wait until random 4\* and 5\* items compete with ideal 3\*'s.
---
I imagine it'll be more on the simple side... Beth doesn't do complexiety. Just looking at the changes they've already made to the game... I assume similar to my OP that it'll be 1 prefix at a time and only 1 or 2 chances a day. I don't see someone sitting there with whatever mechanism it is, doing it hundreds of times until they get their perfect combination.
---
Change your Bethesda password and password lock your Xbox account.
---
I've heard someone say that you can aggro the white spring bots and then hide in the camp and the bots will destroy the camp. Saves you getting a bounty
---
Exit to menu and continue, boom, you'll spawn outside.
---
My complete speculation is honestly that the LV won‚Äôt be as over powered as people are hoping. I don‚Äôt think Bethesda will make it where everyone now has ridiculous god tier guns. The only reason this would happen and make the game still balanced is if enemies received a major lvl buff. Or maybe the you can only re roll it‚Äôs current legendary fixtures all together. (Example: you re roll a 2* handmade. After a few rolls you get a two shot and a Assassin trait. You can re roll but you can‚Äôt keep the two shot, you need to re roll the traits completely, the price increasing every time you re roll in a day)Either way my stash has a over flux of 2-3* legendaries so why not give it a shot.
---
I was literally just wondering the same thing as I got the last recipe I didn't know.
---
I disagree, I don't think it'll involve caps. I think they are trying to rid the world of the millions of excess legendary items that people are just sitting on because we were taught through earlier games to hord. This is a friendly style purging of the servers. :)
---
Items sell better if they are still together and not scraped out so complete glass bottles will sell but glass shards won't (unless you bulk them). 
---
Scrapping is good if you need building supplies, but not good for selling.
---
Thanks man. I've gotten to a point where I've lost so much to this game, including:
---
-Over 50000 rounds of 5mm over several incidents.
---
-3 Incidents of losing my entire suit of Power Armor (Ultracite, all parts upgraded).
---
-7 incidents for each power armor piece individually.
---
-This weapon.
---
-Over 12 Prototype Hazmat Suits.
---
-The entirety of my Stash Box being cleared out twice.
---
It gets to the point where I don't think I can ever get it back now.
---
yeah i know but there's alot things to read and i just want to know about 2 things  ü§î and thanks god they didn't nerf bloodied build  üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I honestly just don't care at all about the player icons. I know I can change it but I have no desire to do so.
---
When i see peoples camps i usually drop something i dont need or want for them.. If there camp is nice that is. If its not i should do this.
---
If that's what you believe, sure. I play on a team and we regularly make thousands of steel and lead a day for consumption and for sale. It is entirely more profiting doing it our way than the old way of farming for the items. 
---
If you think of this game as a job, then you really need to get out more.
---
Man I dislike guys like you! 
---
OP doesn‚Äôt want to see a bunch of click bait videos of shit that some dumb youtubers think is important, or a boring list of patch notes about how Bethesda fixed a bug for crashing when entering the wendigo cave with a dildo up your ass.
---
OP wants to know from the people who actually play the game, and what new things they have experienced that were cool.
---
Hey! Feel free! Do you need me to post it to RT or do you do a kinda fanartfriday thing? :o
---
Not that I‚Äôm aware of. Trying to do the same to earn atoms.
---
Well, of course that helps lighten your stash too...
---
I don't know where that 65% damage increase is coming from.
---
Also this bit right here
---
&gt;Most things out perform AA
---
Is wrong. AA is better than TS vs highly armored targets, such as the SBQ. TS is only better than AA vs weakly armored targets.
---
It also depends on the type of gun used...
---
Maybe that calculator isn't 100% accurate but it's still extremely useful.
---
I juggled some cards to get under my carry limit, then forgot to re-enable it. Then wandered over to Swan for his daily murder, he was a 3* legendary, and fuck me is it a different fight if you can't kneecap them!
---
ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It'll be interesting. To date, minus the Encryptid event, everything has been pretty low level. Even the burrows was less of a challenge for low level players than what was implied.
---
Curious about this as well. I have a full set of sentinel and most people I can resist all or most damage. However I come across some people that seem to kill me in one shot. I don't mean vats crits or staggering first. Legit repeatedly normal shots one hit ko from not just exploding laser weapons but explosive heavy guns like the .50
---
I'm saving all my disappointment for when I discover that whatever system they implement doesn't let me get legendary effects on my scout armor.
---
Big bend tunnel lots of guns to scrap too
---
I'm right across from Morgantown Station/behind the Airport. Lots of people come by, between going to the Vendorbot, low levels on the main quest, and people doing Collision Course. The Scorched at the Airport are annoying, but it's good overall, plus there's a small garden in back.
---
https://youtu.be/PSV2ZswJ3wI
---
Off the top of my head, the big ones are.......
---
Brewing quest line and ability to make / brew alcohol
---
Encryptid quest line and event
---
Sheepsquatch Event
---
New PvP mode - survival
---
New Camera - equip like a weapon
---
Player vending is coming next week and the legendary vendor is coming at the end of the month I think.
---
morgantown (event - lots of scorched) and wade airport (mutants).
---
Glassed cavern was favorite
---
&gt;Do they actually care at Bethesda?
---
I'm starting to think that... no, they don't. They've not commented on missing gear for a while now, despite all the posts we've had. Maybe I missed it, but I swear I've never even seen the CMs post that they're aware and looking into it.
---
I've had my power armor's legs go missing while I was wearing the power armor. I never touched anything on the armor, yet the legs go missing. Yeah, I can replace it, but at the cost of 10 flux to rebuild my mods. I've developed serious trust issues with the inventory system -- a lot of players have. Hell, every player I routinely play with in game has had SOMETHING go missing.
---
This is a huge issue. Bethesda needs to own it and treat it like a serious issues.
---
The secondary effects will probably bring on a new great depression.
---
I doubt those lazy ass robbots never gets thereüòÇ
---
Haha true, but durability works reminds me of Zelda:BOTW. It does encourage you to go out and find more weapons/gear.
---
I'm not 100% on this but I think wood and steel are "common" plastic, acid, ceramic, and lead might be "uncommon".  
---
If you go into your junk tab in the pipboy and do componant view (RB on xbox) you can tag specific materials, makes collecting them much easier.
---
Hear! Hear!
---
But we aren't talking about the other fallout games, we are specifically talking about fo76 because it is nothing like any of the other fallout's ever created except for possibly Van Buren which never got released.
---
You also even just admitted it yourself that fallout didn't popularize post apocolyptic settings, Mad Max did.
---
I haven't even gotten a response from a support ticket since the BETA.
---
Was that pre or post change? Did it have 5 acts or 10 acts? Because the entire game got overhauled and all the areas changed up.
---
I'm not talking about the ones near the actual resort lol theres usually a sentry  bot and an assaultron or two that's right behind the golf course very close to where the camps usually are built
---
I‚Äôve got to ask, do they even play their own game?
---
I‚Äôm always sooooo disappointed in their ‚Äúbalance changes‚Äù they never address anything that actually should be looked at.
---
Look for posters on the walls there‚Äôs 2 for new quests one looks like a party invite and that will unlock brewing and one looks like a ware wolf looking thing that starts the sheepsquach quests both are good quests I prefer the squach ones because they where longer and more in depth
---
Thanks. I've seen over 200 of these posts already. It would be neat if anyone decided to look for themselves first, but feel free to dislike me all you want. I don't care either way.
---
I dunno I've got a full set plus several defense perks. While most people I can resist most or all damage, several players have found a way to kill me with ease.
---
I agree with the overall result of your speculation. Beth doesn't make changes to make this game easier for the high level players, they aren't trying to appease the very small minority of players that are on the search for GOD level everything. This is about ridding the excess legendary items that so many of us have been hoarding.
---
I've found s standard acoustic guitar, a banjo, and a violin (wall mounted in one of tower estates in the ash heap.)  now safely in my stash.
---
What other guitars are there ? (and do you remember where you found them)
---
It looks so nice \~&lt;3
---
I can't wait for Death Rider though. It's gonna be really nice on T-60!
---
wow now this is good sht thanks alot üòòüòçüòç
---
Carpets are invincible
---
Really, displays are pushed even further back. What the fuck...
---
That involves trading which takes a long period of time and a lot of people refuse to do any trading because of how screwed up the trading interface is and how easy it is to get scammed doing it.
---
You can make far more caps by killing workshop holders now than by trading, and this is coming from a trader that doesn't pvp.
---
Ooooooh vending machines!!!!
---
You just described a linear gameplay reward curve for linear story based games. This is a Multiplayer Online Game. No Multiplayer Online Game in existence gives you Endgame Items just because you played the game to its end.
---
If you google Randomness in Itemization you will find THOUSAND Topics about this. And everytime some Casuals are complaining about exactly the same thing you did. The only answer someone could give to this is the exact answer every game dev gave to his customers: If you don't like the hardcore gaming farming experience you can do whatever you want, you don't need todo this to play this game. The experience stays the same with or without thousands of game hours in farming stuff you maybe want or need.  
---
Item Randomization is the Only System that actually works in a Multiplayer Online Game. Some People got their final weapons already after 2 hours of gameplay. Hell some can get their weapon of choice just by buying them online and they just farmed ingame currency easy peasy. You want to get "top tier powerful"? Do the same like every other player that already is "top tier powerful" and yes if thats means you farm 4 years for your weapon of choice thats the way how its works.
---
I'm on XBox, but thank you. I have a ton of weapons that people think I'm a hacker for, but just have had the same character since BETA and used to grind pretty hard when I still thought this game was going to be saved.
---
Yeah. I‚Äôm really close to moving on. I‚Äôve got my fair share of enjoyment from the game - I don‚Äôt feel like I wasted my money even if I quit today. I‚Äôve lost 3 weapons to this bug. If I lose another I‚Äôm done
---
I mean... we've all got to have something to look forward too. ;)
---
I wonder how they'll handle it if you are at 25k caps (or close to it) and an item sells. 
---
Good to have an update, though a bit disappointed nothing about scrapping extra perk cards. I guess likely when legendary player prestige comes out maybe.
---
Nah. Washington gets all the credit for one little fruity tree. Lincoln [made a living at it](http://housedivided.dickinson.edu/sites/lincoln/the-railsplitter/) for a while.
---
how can it cost 120k if the player cap limit is 25k
---
And you may still be able to get both posters in the atom shop for free if you don‚Äôt want to go searching
---
Top notch!
---
FO76 was built on top of FO4. It was never going to be HZD levels of beautiful, but now that the most flagrant bugs have been tamed, that core Bethesda Fallout game shines through.
---
Anthem was built on top of raw Frostbite. It was required to be beautiful, but now that the initial blush of infatuation has worn off, the lack of a solid game core shines through.
---
I don't envy BW Austin's task of, basically, taking a bunch of art assets and a flight system and creating an actual game out of them. At least the FO76 team knows what game they are making. "Fallout 4 multiplayer with no human NPCs." Simple. Even NMS always had a clear central vision. What is Anthem? Really, what is it? There's no elevator pitch. It's just a handful of stuff duct taped together, some of it cool and some of it not as cool.
---
Hopefully, BW Austin pulls it off. I give them about the same odds of turning things around as Star Wars: Episode 9 (that is to say, not great odds). Once you F up a released product, you're in for a painful creative battle to recover.
---
But high propensity for limb damage after an attack.
---
Really?  That's interesting and could be very useful
---
Ha Ha Ha I needed a good laugh.
---
If ps4, got any for sale RN? üòèhehe
---
Used to be able to make a foundation bunker but they patched it
---
\#hotcakes
---
It's not a hacking issue, but it seems to be a problem with the in-game menus. The filters that display weapons, armor, junk, aid, etc are just that -- filters. The entire inventory system is still loaded in the background, and it seems like if you drop something (e.g. spoiled meat) and then go to drop something else the game can select something *else* in the menu screen. You've got an item highlighted, but it's selecting something else in the menu system.
---
This seems to be why a lot of people end up missing items. They do an event like Uranium Fever and then go to mass scrap all the weapons they pick up for steel. On their screen they're ONLY scrapping weapons, but behind the scenes, it seems to sometimes select other items from the game's inventory list. So you could scrap a combat shotgun... or your power armor.
---
Right! I'm feeling so inspired right now, but that has to kill build budget. Maybe a less dense version might work.
---
Anytime I start a play session or switch servers, I run through WS looking for people's drops. What I've found over the last 5 months or so:
---
\-50+ one-star legendaries in a single trash can. Vendor fodder for days.
---
\-hundreds of plans, including a couple sheepsquatch staff the last couple days
---
\-rare outfits (colored asylum uniforms, bos outfits, sheepsquatch imposter, etc)
---
\-2,000+ stimpacks and 1,000+ super stims in one bag. Took me forever to sell them so I could FT again.
---
\-Enough 2mm ammo that I've never had to craft it.
---
\-A few dozen fusion cores at once.
---
\-100 plasma cores
---
\-A bag with close to 1000lbs of broken down junk when I was low level. It was a crafting godsend.
---
I also check all the vendors as you never know what people think is worthless and sell. Two days before the energy weapon buff I found 3 explosive energy weapons including a TSE gatling plasma at a WS vendor.
---
Last week I found a container in the lobby that looked like someone was maybe trying to use it for character transferring. I'm sorry, but if you're doing that in this public of a location, you have no expectation of it being there when you get back.
---
With the easiness of farming vast number of legendaries, the payout can't be good from the vendor.
---
ie. if we get one token per legendary star, it might cost us 100 tokens for re-roll on one item. That re-roll would in no way guarantee a better than you had.
---
A pathway? Like the many marketplaces across all platforms? 
---
I've had a pretty good return on the time I've spent farming plans/mods, and have been able to make a considerable amount of returns by leveraging those in the markets, and then turning those gains into more profitable trades for myself.
---
Legendary drop rates **suck**, badly, but you can't place all the blame on bethesda, if you've spent hundreds of hours playing and don't have anything to show for it.
---
Then other will take the workshops. Even if you quit taking the workshops, other people will take them and they will be able to farm those new people taking those workshops for the caps. 
---
Also, you are doubting the amount you can make killing people who take workshops. You can get 200 caps a kill easily and it takes less than 10 minutes to kill them, ontop of being able to do that many times.
---
They may also not have lead to sell, most people who use ammo ends up low on lead due to crafting ammo. Outside of shotgun builds(which costs 10 plastic for 21 shells :( instead of 2 per 18 bullets) lead is the biggest bottleneck for ammo.
---
Its just they want a discussion, not a boring list of patch notes. It‚Äôs like a fun way to learn the new stuff, while not including the boring shit from the notes.
---
And god forbid you try to learn anything from youtube, and every video has that stupid rainbow background (border?), you know you are getting into some shit.
---
If you don‚Äôt want to help him thats fine but don‚Äôt even bother commenting, just go past the post.
---
well do thanks. ü§óüòò
---
Serious question: Do you guys actually care about the legendaries and number of stars and stuff? Everyone seems to talk about it but I really couldnt care less. I use All Rise and a bat I wrapped with barbed wire and call Lucille, as well as random guns I pick up then scrap later.
---
# FALLOUT 76: INSIDE THE VAULT ‚Äì PATCH 9 PREVIEW
---
This week, we‚Äôre sharing a preview of a few of the highlights coming with Patch 9, including details on Player Vending Machines, Legendary Exchange Machines, a new Survival Beta scoreboard stat, and balance changes. Read on to learn more about these upcoming features and changes, and be sure to keep an eye out for the full patch notes when we release Patch 9 on May 7.
---
### PLAYER VENDING MACHINES
---
With Patch 9, we‚Äôre going to add personal Vending Machines that aspiring entrepreneurs around Appalachia can use to turn their C.A.M.P.s into makeshift markets. These vending machines will allow you to turn a profit by selling items you‚Äôve made or found during your adventures. You can also visit other Dwellers‚Äô C.A.M.P.s to pick up new gear for your collection.
---
Once you build a Vending Machine, you can assign items to it directly from your Stash and choose the Cap prices you‚Äôd like buyers to pay for them. Items you place in your Vending Machine will remain in your Stash, but they will also display a new vending icon next to their names so that it‚Äôs easy to identify what you‚Äôve marked for sale at a glance. You will receive a notification whenever a buyer snatches up one of your wares. Caps from your sale, minus a nominal fee of 10% to maintain a healthy in-game economy, will be added to your Cap balance.¬†
---
Of course, to run a successful business, you‚Äôll need to advertise! When you build and power a Vending Machine, your C.A.M.P. location will appear to all players on the map as long as you aren‚Äôt currently Wanted. When others hover over your C.A.M.P. on the map, they‚Äôll see your name and player icon, as well as the number and types of items you have marked for sale. If you‚Äôve got lots of goods or rare items, and set fair prices, your shop will likely have a few new visitors.
---
We can‚Äôt wait to see how your C.A.M.P.s and trading evolve once we get vending machines into your hands, and we hope you‚Äôll share your thoughts with us once they go live next week.
---
### LEGENDARY EXCHANGE MACHINES
---
The Purveyor is a new Mole Miner vendor who will be making her way to the Wasteland later this month, but she doesn‚Äôt deal in Caps. When she opens the doors to her shop, you‚Äôll be able to exchange a new type of currency, called Legendary Scrip, for legendary items. To help you prepare for the Purveyor‚Äôs arrival, we‚Äôre adding Legendary Exchange Machines that you can use to break down your unwanted legendary items and turn them into Scrip.¬†
---
Once Patch 9 is live, you will be able to find Legendary Exchange Machines at Train Stations around Appalachia. Load up your inventory with the legendary items you no longer want to keep, place them in the machine, and then collect your Scrip. The higher the star-rating of your legendary items, the more Scrip you will receive. The more Legendary Scrip you have when the Purveyor arrives, the more legendary weapons and armor you will be able to buy!
---
We will have more details to share on the Purveyor next week. We hope the addition of Exchange Machines will help you free up some storage space and fill your wallet with Scrip while she travels to the surface.¬†
---
### SURVIVAL SCOREBOARD UPDATES
---
Previously, we asked you to¬†[weigh in on a poll](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/336683/poll-which-survival-stat-is-your-favorite?language%5B%5D=en)¬†to determine your favorite Survival Mode scoreboard stat so that we could make adjustments based on the community‚Äôs preferences. The results are in: ‚ÄúPlayers Killed‚Äù received the most votes, with ‚ÄúLongest Life‚Äù and ‚ÄúXP Gained‚Äù tying for second, and ‚ÄúEnemies Killed‚Äù coming in third. While ‚ÄúPlayers Killed‚Äù was the clear victor at 63%, there were enough votes in other categories that we wanted to create a new stat that takes more than one into account when ranking player performance in Survival Mode.¬†
---
With Patch 9, we‚Äôre planning to implement ‚ÄúSurvival Score‚Äù as the new primary stat for the Scoreboards. Here‚Äôs how it will work:
---
* You will receive one Survival Point for every Experience Point you earn while playing in the Survival Beta.¬†
---
* The total number of Survival Points you currently have will determine your placement on the Scoreboards. The three players with the highest Survival Scores will be highlighted on the Map.
---
* On death, your Survival Score will be reset to zero.
---
* When you kill another player, 75% of the Survival Points they had prior to death will be added to your Survival Score.
---
   * For example: If your Survival Score is 500 and you kill a player whose Score is 1,000, they will lose all their Points and you will receive 750, for a new Survival Score of 1,250.
---
Thank you for your feedback and for participating in our poll. We believe Survival Score will offer a more well-rounded way to evaluate your feats, while also giving PVP-focused players a clear way to rise through the rankings and chase the excitement of fending off challengers.
---
### WEAPON ADJUSTMENTS
---
In addition to everything mentioned so far, we‚Äôre planning to make a few adjustments to weapons in our next update. Read on for a preview of the weapon changes you can expect to see on patch day.
---
##### PLASMA WEAPON BUFFS
---
Plasma Guns aren‚Äôt currently as strong as we‚Äôd like them to be, and we wanted to give them a bit of a damage boost to bring them more in line with the other weapons at your disposal. The following buffs should help your Plasma Guns pack a little more punch across the board:¬†
---
* Base Plasma Gun damage increased by 30%.
---
* Base Enclave Plasma Gun damage increased by 10% to 30%.
---
##### EXPLOSIVE SHOTGUN BUG FIXES
---
We‚Äôre also implementing fixes for a pair of bugs affecting shotguns that have the explosive legendary effect. The first was causing them to deal double damage, rather than the 20% increase the explosive effect is intended to provide. The second issue was causing the Pip-Boy to display lower damage numbers than explosive shotguns were actually dealing to your targets. While these aren‚Äôt true balance changes, it‚Äôs important that we address these issues to bring more consistency to both the displayed and actual damage output of explosive shotguns.¬†
---
##### FLAMER AND CRYOLATOR AMMO CRAFTING
---
Finally, we‚Äôve heard your feedback that Flamer Fuel and Cryo Cells can be hard to come by. We‚Äôd like to give you more opportunities to stock up on ammo for these weapons when you visit workbenches, and we are planning to make the following changes:
---
* Flamer Fuel created via crafting increased from 5 to 20.
---
* Cryo Cells created via crafting increased from 15 to 25.
---
### DISPLAY CASES ARE COMING
---
As some of you may already be aware, we‚Äôre planning to add display cases so that you can show off some of the items you‚Äôve collected, such as weapons, bobbleheads, and magazines, in your C.A.M.P.s. We‚Äôre excited to bring this feature to the game, but it‚Äôs going to take a little more time and testing to make sure we get it right. As a result, display cases are going to arrive a few weeks after we release Patch 9. We know many of you are waiting to be able to flaunt your collections, and we appreciate your patience.
---
We hope you‚Äôve enjoyed getting an early look at some of the changes coming with our next update. As with previous updates, we‚Äôre planning to post the full patch notes when Patch 9 goes live on May 7.
---
Don‚Äôt forget! We‚Äôre streaming Fallout 76 every week on Wednesday at 1:00 p.m. EDT. Tune in on¬†[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda)¬†or¬†[Mixer](https://mixer.com/Bethesda)to join members of the Community Team as they take a look at the latest game content and explore Appalachia.
---
Until next time, we‚Äôll see you in the Wasteland!
---
The published comments were not from Bethesda, and several I read were embellished versions, I also watched the interview on YouTube that it came from, and he made it sound like a half baked notion of what they might do.
---
ps4 :(
---
No worries, I was also disappointed by the TSE nerf but have since gone full bloodied and it is awesome
---
Sure if that was the only thing they did, that would be true, but then they added in repair kits, and next they are adding in fridges for camps to slow spoiling foods, and the ability to turn one type of ammo into another, and the ability to stash things in your stash without having to visit a stash.
---
If it was only that one thing, you'd have a point. Unfortunately it isn't just that one thing, it is repeated continual additions of p2w items.
---
I'll shoot you a DM :)
---
Maybe you could answer their question then, and everyone else's as this literally gets asked every couple hours.
---
The biggest downfall of this game, for me, is that we can't decorate with junk. Why have a tub if I can't fill it with cash? I looted all the stuffed toys from Camden Park but I can't put them in my house? Can't put a teapot or coffee pot in my kitchen?
---
Decorating with junk/food/etc was my favorite part of settlement building in FO4. :(
---
Go out and get a Tesla rifle with the charging shotgun mod.  A white will do, even level 25.  Point vaguely in the direction of the baddies, shoot, watch the lightning arc all over the baddies, profit.  Super fast and easy way to tag mobs and lots of em at once.  You dont even have to be close to accurate.
---
Awesome. Thank you!
---
Thankyou!!
---
Thanks for letting us know.
---
I'll keep an eye out!
---
Soon! Check today‚Äôs Beth update - preview for patch 9, they mention the display cases that are coming soon.
---
I read in the next patch that they're going to remove the limitations where foundations must be placed on a level surface... Hoping that can allow bunkers
---
Sounds like you were ina server with a bunch of higher level players.   Were you trying to do roses missions? Those are tough at low levels for sure.
---
Cool.
---
I finally got my first TSE (lvl 40 pipe PISTOL... yak) from a 3* ghoul in the garage at Whitespring, just a week or two ago. 700 hours in
---
Agreed.
---
Thanks, your awesome! But xb1 and regretting it. 
---
Picked it up in January solely to continue my FO addiction since fo 3
---
Holy shit, that‚Äôs more than a month straight of FO76. Props!
---
Send them a code or solution to the situation that works better than what they have. BOOM PROBLEM SOLVED
---
Mediocre game? ROFL, D2 was one of the most popular games when it was new. It was popular and had active servers ran by blizzard for over a decade after they released the game.
---
So not sure what you are talking about with "mediocre game that had no future" when the game was the most popular game they came out with and rivaled WoW in popularity, AND had active servers until pretty much everyone moved on to other games over 10 years after the game was released.
---
Where are you getting this idea that it had no future when it outlasted most online games, sold more than all the fallout games have combined, and literally funded blizzard enough to where they could afford to create WoW.
---
Green Thumb, Super Duper (max), Chemist - great for crafting healing and drugs.
---
define "low level quest" there are not to many of them, id say most are mid level quests (30-40 range). at that point most mobs wont be 3x your level
---
They have been answering there tickets I went to the post you mentioned and Beth's response was pretty accurate they can't discuss account details in an open forum that's pretty normal and probably even mentioned in the rules of the forum
---
It appears that Dense would probably be better for what you are wanting since it's for explosions. Asbestos is flame invulnerability. I still don't know why the car explosion doesn't hurt me though.
---
yeah that is a very good point, the duping really fucked this games economy, the only explosive weapon i have i found recently after like 400 hours , its a lvl 30 explosive revolver, so basically worthless
---
10k?
---
Hmm, is it available on the Switch, and can you still use the item lists like on the PC to block the majority of item drops from showing up?
---
Or just make the hand pump turn out water as fast as hammering the button standing in water.  Seems like an easier fix anyway.
---
This is just what the losers want, attention.  Anyone who knows them knows they‚Äôre a bunch of idiots, and there are multiple groups hunting them down constantly.  All you can do is keep getting video of their exploits and keep reporting to Bethesda.  They seem to not want to do anything about it, but the more people that do maybe they‚Äôll pay attention.  
---
And don‚Äôt worry, their duped stealth boys will run out soon.  They go down like flies without them.
---
I would love to! But honestly at the moment I have a lot of other projects and freelance work going on :c Took a quick look at your work though and your doing a great job! Keep me in mind for the future :D
---
To young? I worked in game development for midway in the early 2000's. I'm probably much older than the majority of this subreddit.
---
Yeah, speaking to his half-baked notion... All I'm saying is technically, that's published, and I've gotta assume Todd is from Bethesda. In reality, I'm more just giving you a hard time, because #fun.
---
yeah its feel like all my time farming legendary weapon was wasted i still have some good one but they dont do anything  üòî
---
Lets talk about the 5* Hell even the 4* weapons that drop.
---
Will those be included with the vendor?
---
I worry about the shotgun matter.
---
Hopefully I won't go from 'boom' to 'plink plink' but given past 'rebalances' I am now awaiting the patch with a renewed sense of foreboding.
---
Better make the most of the two toons I have geared as shotgunners (one stealth, another 'in your face'), I might need to shelve them after next patch until I can re-spec them.
---
Lmao maybe what we should do is get a post together that is pinned that had regular updates? Not patch notes but like the general interesting things like ‚Äúoh a dungeon was added‚Äù or ‚Äúthe new PA skin is up‚Äù that people actually care about.
---
Then you could link that post whenever someone asks!
---
I would honestly love to do a vintage style poster of these two with this as the tagline on it haha
---
Morgantown airport, Grafton events, and Waterpark
---
Yes I'm aware of all that. Maybe I can clarify.. I don't feel like I need a specific item. Just an opposite or equal power boost so I can even compete. Right now, there is multi star exploding weapons and then everything else. It's very unbalanced (at top tiers of late game). I don't have a 'choice' to use the multitude of other 3 star items I've had drop because they are nowhere close to that God-tier power level. 
---
In mmo's like WOW or whatever, players at least have some amount of balance and variety in the late game choices. 
---
I do not want a play X hours = get x weapon set up. That's lame and I like the adventure of not knowing what you'll get. What I dont like is having a level 51 roll through my completely kitted out lvl 176 in 1 shot because he got a lucky drop and I didn't, and there is no counter.
---
Let me again stress that I have put in a ton of hours on this game. I grinded server hops for 3 jet packs and a stealth boy. I'm about that life! And, yet, here I am unable to compete in high level pvp because I'm not lucky enough.
---
Nailed it in one. Had no issues six months ago on my other account. First I got killed by level 32 ghouls/legendary ones that didn't even render, then when retrieving my loot they were level 3. Then back to level 32.
---
They aren‚Äôt in the featured section. It‚Äôs in the middle of the camp section. Or you can find it in the building interface and it will give you the option to buy it when you try to build it.
---
I have been leaving a skull in a bag. I always do a healing salve and mothman egg run, so I grab the skull off the table at Point Pleasant.
---
Me and my mates, mate.
---
&gt;  Caps from your sale, minus a nominal fee of 10% to maintain a healthy in-game economy, will be added to your Cap balance.¬† 
---
Another Money Sink like that isn't maintaining a healthy economy. No Game can maintain a healthy economy and never will. I want my 10% caps xD? It's a wasteland omfg why is my vending machine eating my 1-2 caps that i could have used for food and beer.
---
ok, i  challenge you to point out where OP is whining as you put it
---
im so tired of people like you in the internet
---
Haven't tried with the Eggs, I also missed out on the first 2 since I was out of town that week, but...
---
I have multiple accounts, and have been able to build other Atom Shop Items in the Camps of my Alt accounts.
---
I have not tried building Atom Shop items in other players Camps, but my accounts are not linked, so I don't see why it would be any different.
---
I don't fast travel. That might be because I'm always carrying around 1500-1900 lbs. 
---
I find it makes the game more interesting as I encounter far more random events this way.
---
You mean I have to socialize? Sad face
---
Oh yeah, and the lumbermill full of mutants in the far northwest corner
---
agreed - honestly it was the first thing that caught my eye then was like ohh hey a bunch of stash boxes
---
Because there are a lot of butthurt bethesda boot lickers in here I pissed off by pointing out the glaring issues in this game. So I got a little following of angry boot lickers mad I'd dare say anything negative about fo76. Since it is such a PERFECT game with NO ISSUES.
---
My expectation is that we will have a low end economy around caps and another on legendary tokens.
---
I'm excited.
---
Have them send me my $100 or a canvas - Whoops, Nylon - Bag or item of equal value to reimburse me for the money I spent with the expectation of a fully-made game and properly worked code. BOOM PROBLEM SOLVED.
---
lol apple logo on an Xbox.
---
As someone who hasn't played in months, are you now able to increase your stash space by placing more stash boxes?
---
Oh no itll be something crazy priced and 99% likely not effected by charisama or hard bargain
---
Yes it is, especially after the T virus escapes out of raccoon city.
---
I don't know if it's the next update or not, but they are planning on letting us decorate down the line with items from our inventory.
---
Same, been noticing this a lot on survival recently. It's not stagger and it's not crits. I'm curious how people are completely negating sentinel armor.
---
No it wont. It will allow for better placement of your camp but...stacking foundations wont be possible. It will make the legnth you create greater in terms of how many blocks can be floating off of one foundation but i highly doubt they will let you barricade your lvl 2 empath/cap bank in a bunker again.
---
Well I‚Äôd rather them get them right then have them be bugged and my power armor goes missing.
---
I'm not sure what the 5th star will be, but we already know what the 4th star is... the mod for scorched damage.
---
Good idea but I'd rather join a G.A.N.G than a G.O.A.L
---
So at one point Bethesda was talking about faction war, but they haven't said a peep about it in a very long time.
---
Welp. My explosive shotgun is going to be the first thing I trade in at the legendary exchange machine.
---
This is still coming alongside an end to players damaging your CAMP, right? If your CAMP's location is on the map now, I would hope there's some guard against both players directly damaging it and kiting enemies over to damage it. I expect not, but a man can hope for at least the first one.
---
I expect to convert my lvl 20 1\* ghoul slayer's leather chest piece into unyielding ap refresh sentinel combat armor. I also need BOS mod for my new godly chest piece so bethesda will provide the plan via watoga vendor at a humble price of 200 caps
---
I'm not being a douche, I'm a trader and I don't even PVP, I'm just letting this person know what the money making guides are saying. Which is currently to kill workshop owners for the CAPS since bethesda greatly increased cap drops on kills recently.
---
Finding the repeater/relay schematics.  I believe it's the first Rose quest. Never had an issue with it spawning level appropriate mobs before.
---
What will we ever do without you?
---
I do too but they do make mistakes üòâ
---
I'll be interesting for sure, but I doubt that caps will play a roll.
---
At level 17 I "soloed" a level 71 chameleon deathclaw at Whitesprings.
---
I just sniped at it and then ran to the front gates, hid in the guard room, and took potshots while all the Assaultrons wrecked his shit, haha.
---
It took me 530hours to hack 50terminals which counted, same with 20magazines. Please no more bugged frustrating shit. I thought i became mad before i get platinum
---
Eh
---
I've found 6 at lvl 170
---
Oh could I ask you a question then? I'm constantly running out of ammo (I am terrible at aiming) I want to say I mostly use .45 and .308 ammo at the moment. Is there a good place to get the lead to manufacture these or find these kinds of ammo? Lead seems to be my hold up at the moment.
---
I mean I farm the water anyway. I don't do it for caps. I like to give a few purified waters to other wastelanders. I mean if I have all this water why not share it with other thirsty wastelanders.
---
I regret not pulling out...
---
5 bucks says thats the first thing they make sure of lol. Bet they get super tired of the backlash.
---
Absolutley, since you can invent time travel and take back the amount of time you spent playing, woop, "wasting your time" playing the game anyways or even talking about it. That may be worth it for everyone!
---
I don't think you read a word of what either myself or OP wrote.
---
Agreed, most of their new content doesn't seem to be impacted by S.P.E.C.I.A.L.S. or Perks.
---
&gt;Really? I run Uranium fever, pick everything up, and just the cooked meat alone is around 200 caps. I run this event at least 3-4 times a day easy. 
---
They can average that many kills in an hour. Not all day.
---
&gt;PVP is a gamble for the most part. You might be killed and lose your caps instead, or not. So you go after weaker players to give yourself better odds, but really you just need that hit. Surely attacking a high level player would yield more caps, but at higher risk. What it really comes down to is getting that hit of juicy brain chems the easiest way possible.
---
No, you literally just trade the caps off to your mule between kills so you can't drop any. Just keep about 30 caps on you to afford fast travels and you can easily clear 2k+caps an hour doing it.
---
Creating a non-deterministic sorting algorithm is quite the achievement in of itself
---
There are level-appropriate areas of the map.  If you stay within the areas for your level you will be fine.  If you jump to events in higher level areas you will die a lot.   Same for Whitesprings.
---
it'd be fucking stupid if it was an instant I WIN EVERYTHING button
---
I just break in to take selfies and repair my gear ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Used it today to gift a player a legendary handmade I got but didn't need,way better than trying to chase them down.
---
You ever try leveling up first?
---
You and me both, friend. You and me both.
---
so promising. nice.
---
big bend at 25?  
---
   Does it scale up/down?  
---
L30-60 scorched first time I went through ( granted &gt; L60 at the time).
---
what an incredibly minor thing to whine about
---
Sorry, I can't. Too busy having a dildo up my ass. Maybe someone else will talk to you.
---
The wasteland is tough, it will break you, it will remove weakness from you, or you will like the OP, perish from it.
---
Stay strong Appalachia, we need people who can handle a molerat.
---
It absolutely will not be, not even close. But seeing some of the posts over the last few days... That's what people are expecting.
---
No, you can clear 2k+ caps an hour killing workshop owners. You just kill them and keep server hopping to find the quick easy to find people and you can easily clear way more than you could trading.
---
I'm not trying to justify anything, I DON'T PVP, I am a trader. I'm just letting people know why it is happening.
---
Gonna need to boost the cap limit.
---
Happy about fuel. Now just need to work on durability for flames and cryo.
---
its almost like opinions vary.
---
He said he noticed one of his weapons disappeared when he logged into the game. My entire Fallout 76 crew and Discord have been fighting this issue for weeks now, and have experienced the same problem. I related our experiences in that we think the issue is ultimately tied to the way menu filters work which can cause people to drop or deconstruct items incorrectly, and thus could explain part of why he lost his weapon.
---
My comment was entirely related.
---
Holy shit that's a good Inside the Vault
---
I also worked out at the gym for 2 weeks straight during that time period. That sounds even more bad ass.... LOL.
---
you aren't getting a "healthy economy" in a silly game like this. Go play EVE.
---
Don‚Äôt go into the wendigo cave with that!
---
You're right, I should probably be complaining about "rEpAiR KiTs P2W!!!"
---
There is the sacrificial mod for the machete as well.
---
But i mean natural drop wise. OR are they going to introduce more legendary mods so we can make 5*?
---
I personally know 3 people who have sent in dozens of tickets with ZERO response...  So how can you say they are answering tickets?
---
I‚Äôll be farming white springs all weekend so I can get those legendary scrips ready to go.
---
And what parameters did you expect a fully working game? Did it start and run on your console?  Did you play it anyways and complain the whole time without researching how the UI was corrupted? Or did you just send little angry doo-doo messages over and over to a forum that's engulfed in "my personal opinion on the thing that I don't understand but should be right because I know what things should be"?
---
&gt; Is wrong. AA is better than TS vs highly armored targets, such as the SBQ. TS is only better than AA vs weakly armored targets.
---
It's not wrong, you clearly don't know how damage works. AA is good on low damage high output full auto type weapons. It's very poor to completely useless on snipers melee and vats builds in general. When you stack your damage up to massive amounts, you get minimal to no damage reduction regardless of target and their armor, even the SBQ. That threshold is around 1500 damage, which is incredibly easy to get with crit/vats builds and melee builds.
---
That 65% damage number is quite easy to come up with simply by thinking. Two shot gives 25% damage increase, explosive is 20%. TS applies explosive twice, so 40% damage increase. That's why TSE was so bonkers strong before all the huge numbers nerfs and why it's still so strong now. If you have the explosive perk TSE is still the strongest weapon combo in the game, though that's a lot of perk points for minimal return, you'd be way better off spending those points elsewhere.
---
I'm not saying the calculator isn't accurate, I'm saying its straight wrong for shots per second and doesn't take a **lot** of other things into account, hell it doesn't even have some guns let alone all their mods and whatnot. The dps side of the calculations is calculated entirely incorrectly. You're right, it's nice and can be useful, but take it with a pinch of salt instead of proclaiming some things are better than others based on its inaccurate calculations.
---
I can't wait for that calculator to be finished, but right now, it's just a for fun thing, don't trust its numbers.
---
I mean that is better but still not enough.
---
Maybe you get legendary tokens/"Scrip" per every 25K caps?
---
Does anyone think that the legendary currency will be tradable?
---
No, it is pretty much random. Some places have a CHANCE of spawning legendary creatures.
---
Just make sure you dont loose you Mods or the things you cant craft. 
---
Other wise im gunna do this right meow
---
So you know three cheaters who where told they cheated and who keep flooding the service department crying about being banned
---
Yes! Recon scopes and stuff too!
---
Legendary drops have been nerfed without a doubt. The watoga protections were stealth nerfed, Whitesprings was nerfed, and scorchbeast queen isn't worth it. Not to mention the still massive food/water drain.
---
Probably right lol
---
I agree with you..wtf do we have to pay tax for selling stuff is there a new unknown damn government and wtf collects the tax..sorry but that blows goats
---
The hand pump is insanely slow. Even if you spam the use button it still takes like 10 seconds between collecting dirty waters.
---
Best place for fluids and mass if you want some stable flux.
---
Last time I saw Grahm I did not see Moo Moo, if anything did happen to her I will find who is responsible and send a nuke up their a\*\*.
---
I found about 30 bloodied explosive shotguns and some explosive laser rifles. Back when duping was at it‚Äôs peak. I took one and left the rest.
---
Yes! I was so happy to see this. I had to explain to my boyfriend who does not game that all we had was a come here emote. Then, shoot at the bag or jump up and down. Which ends up with the other player running away. He said well. Yeah. Someone shooting who is higher level I would run too. Lol
---
Better than the last time I did it -- failed because nobody would take the pylons.
---
Difference is, Bethesda isnt an AAA company. Nor does it have a track record of uber quality games that the anthem devs have. But they're pushing on like the little engine that could.
---
always ask the same. 'will i shit on it if i mess with it'. so far ...no. the shot gun mods quite good,and,you can always remove it.(hmmmm  ,might need the plans for that.). mine is fitted,don't want to put it back.
---
*I'm also not talking about other fallouts, as they didn't have zombies*
---
there have never been zombies in FO games or 76...  do you mean ghouls?  like in all the other fallouts? remember the mission to Necropolis in FO 1?  
---
I find your lack of knowledge disturbing, it makes your arguments carry less impact
---
Hit up lucky hole mine with some excavator armor, you'll have more lead ore than you know what to do with.
---
Yeah but what we really need is
---
"Sorry"
---
"Thank you"
---
And, Point and laugh
---
Yeah for some reason I forgot all about that lol
---
so now you are jumping RE games to prove your point, sad
---
The shotgun mod is bad ass but it cuts your range big time
---
Better damage? Don't care as much about distance.
---
Well it couldn't have been him, he's all the way over on the other side of the map.  
---
Wait a second ....
---
If their marketing team is more competent than their developers (pretty sure they've never played a video game before) it will be black friday (no pun intended) and it will be like all the limited time items since launch.  They will make a killing from a few of them blackbird included.
---
Kind of unfair if it requires tons of legendaries to be turned in. That rewards dupers who didn't get caught in ban waves.
---
I just hope he has a good combat shotgun I‚Äôve been looking for one for so long
---
I think they expect you to add Atoms skin on everything in order to protect your stuff ;)
---
I've already built my permanent camp in anticipation for the vending machine so I can leave my door unlocked and everyone has both a shop and fully functioning camp away from camp :)
---
You need to engage in the social aspect of the game: someone has the gear that you want in the world, and they probably want to trade it or sell it. If that's not an option for you: this game can reward hard work and dedication, but it's very different from a lot of other mmos. I fight in PvP with nuka/pumpkin/MIRV grenades and gamma guns and I can hold my own against TSE raiders with full Sentinel gear, and I was able to solo the White Spring golf course with a crafted pump-action and a fire axe at level 35 (3rd rank of Enforcer is amazing). This game rewards finding creative solutions to problems, and the greatest problem out there is usually the people who can metagame better than the rest of us
---
Yeah if someone is around you can't do sneak attacks. Thats how it is for months.
---
Yeah I just made my way there last night. Not bad amount of XP. Thanks!
---
Nope, doubtful, but I bet you can buy it or a way to increase the amount you get in the atom shop.
---
It'll be interesting!
---
I think it‚Äôs sales down to your level, I used it to level up during the x2 Xp weekend
---
Slowing making my way up to the Waterpark. Probably next time I get on I‚Äôll be there.
---
Are you melee? Be my Strong Abe Daddy
---
I could be wrong, but I'm expecting more like the number of stars to be related to the number of coins.
---
Something like 1* pays 1 coin, 2* pays 10, 3* pays 50; then when spinning for a new one, you pay double for that tier (100 coins to spin for a 3*, etc.)
---
Something where it's not impossible to move from 1* up to 3*, but definitely difficult.
---
Ha. I've only just started seeing legendaries. My step father is an all day every day player and he's never seen anything over 1 star.
---
"Spins", lol
---
Maybe I‚Äôll wait till I‚Äôm at least 30-35 before I attempt that haha.
---
But you just said they answer all the tickets (are you now admitting you are a liar?)
---
You failed to answer my questions (in a sad attempt to deflect from them)
---
1. How can you say they answer all their help tickets?
---
2. Do you work for Bethesda?
---
3. Do you see every help ticket?
---
Since I already know the answers (as you are clearly a moron) you do not need to respond
---
Even when I was across the map from the workshop?
---
yea, roses quest will take you places a low level has no business being.  
---
IMHO, You should not really be on the eastern side of the Divide until about level 30, perhaps more.
---
Enemies in the middle and east side of the divide are always high level.
---
You can do whitsprings, starting about L27 if you have a good weapon.  It'll be tough, but you can do it.
---
Enemies in the western divide will scale up depending on other players in the area. 
---
(So if a high level has been through, you will get high level enemies).  Path of the wind and top of the world scale.  So do places in the ash heap.
---
Server hop or revisit the area later, and you'll get significantly lower level enemies.
---
You should probably stay in the forest/toxic valley until L30, then the ash heap, then the divide. @ 45/50, points east.
---
Mmmm. Well, maybe I do care about range. Did AWOL Armements last night and could do damage to multiple Gutsies from across the parking lot.
---
Will be online later, shoot an offer
---
&gt;	Edit: I did a lot of reading and if I‚Äôm going to get better at slaying and tougher to defeat I need to grind at least 1,500 hrs into legendary looting.
---
It‚Äôs a looter shooter, not Counterstrike; hours of grinding count for more than raw skill. That‚Äôs just how it goes, and if that doesn‚Äôt work for you then you‚Äôre indeed better off with a different game. I‚Äôd suggest Destiny 2: even if it also has a meta, skill trumps it every time.
---
ROFL, like it still won't be bugged when it comes out. Hell, look at the camera, it got pushed back, then it comes out and has such a massive bug that it can send you flying just by using an emote.
---
I didn't read anything about a reroll (which I know was a rumor), or what exactly the Purveyor sells.  Sounds like we choose between selling legendaries for caps to vendors or other players, or turning them into scrip and hoping she sells something worthwhile.  I worry it'll turn into another chore like Whitespring where you hop until the vendor has something you want.
---
My gut says "Stereotype" costumes in today's social climate are a magnet for bullshit, and are to be avoided by devs at all costs.
---
God i hate those sooks
---
Oh wow, "Legendary Scrip." Nice that they're referencing [old coal mining town history for that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_store).
---
If supervisor appears during uranium fever, everyone goes into danger mod. Doesn't matter if you're sneaking or you are doing the event on your own
---
I understand what you're getting at, but you can literally get 10-20 legendaries in a WS nuke zone. Getting them is too easy. They (for the most part) already got rid of all the excess the dupers had, this is getting rid of the stock piles we've all been keeping.
---
Honestly? I think you have a point.
---
Explosive shotguns are OP, glad they are being balanced. Plasma buff wonder if that will make them finally useful.
---
I like it üñ§
---
But I forgot my pen
---
Shit the bed again
---
typical
---
Thanks. Have to think on this one... don't have the plans, so couldn't change it back. Love the bloodied effect on this rifle. Does amazing multiple dp on lvl 50 robots
---
White tuxedo with Wolf‚Äôs fedora. *M‚Äôlady.*
---
Every armor I have in my stash that is not what I'm currently wearing gets ultra light mod
---
Any source on that 20% base increase from explosive? Couldn't find anything about it. 
---
Also TS only gets 25% of base damage. The second shot doesn't get affected by the receiver you're using. Only by perk cards. On a hardened receiver the real % increase from two-shot is about 21% 
---
Chances are the second shot isn't even affected by prime receivers either.
---
It‚Äôs a bigger step then nothing so it‚Äôs enough for me for now...
---
Who the fuck upvotes this shit? More whining from salty cheaters.
---
I have done all that and more. I've been playing since lunch and I really took my time, didn't rush, I was super slow because I knew this would happen. Obviously I only play survival which is what is keeping this game alive.
---
Knee capping large creatures is one of the reasons I play Fallout.  Assultrons, deathclaws, super muitants, etc all fall to a shotgun at the knees.  Enforcer and tormentor rule for knee capping.
---
Oh. That‚Äôs it, I suppose. Thank you so much. lol
---
What? Where did I mention any specific resident evil game? I didn't. If you want to go by the lore of the game it was post apocolyptic prior to the first game as the T virus had already gotten loose prior to the first game lore wise.
---
Just make sure you have enough acid to smelt it all. But you can come away with 200+ lead easy
---
Is it possible to get the firecracker whiskey now, or still bugged?
---
&gt;we‚Äôre planning to add display cases so that you can show off some of the  items you‚Äôve collected, such as weapons, bobbleheads, and magazines, in  your C.A.M.P.s.
---
But... I have some instruments (trumpet, accordion, etc) that I was hoping to put in display cases. Will I be able to display them in my C.A.M.P.? ::lower lip quiver::
---
Does anyone know if when player vending drops will my tamed animals at my camp be safe or is someone likely to just straight up kill them like always?
---
I wish people could openly talk about how unstable this game really is here.  It is a big messy shitshow, and I really like the game.  I do agree that game stability should be properly fixed.  I have had one of the new dlc missions glitch on me and I‚Äôll never get the loot from it.  Super unhappy about that.   I feel you, sorry about that
---
I think this is what most expected, itll probably be similar to how destiny 2 does it, the vendor comes once a week and offers pretty good weapons with a revolving inventory each time. Doubt itll be a reroll, but I definitely think itll have worth it legendaries
---
Honestly I think there should be a challange for a workshop. If an invader comes in to claim it, the host should get a prompt to accept defeat and forfeit the workshop to the invader without pvp. Or a second option to defend the work shop from the invader thus engaging pvp between the two parties with the victorus side gaing control with a cool down time before they can be challenged again to help prevent spam attacks. If the host isn't at the workshop, they should have a 3 minute timer to return to the workshop and make their choice or automatically forfeit the shop if they dont return.
---
That's a nice path. Don't forget to do the missing kid quest at the Waterpark to get that awesome lvl 40 machine gun.
---
I'm trying so hard to not "hope" there's just so much I'd like that's better than what I have, but I don't want my heart broken.
---
I wish player vending had its own stash of caps. Now I have to play my mule to sell my items üò≠üòÇ
---
I don‚Äôt know, they already threw a shine still into the game...
---
&gt;there have never been zombies in FO games or 76... do you mean ghouls? like in all the other fallouts? remember the mission to Necropolis in FO 1? 
---
No, I'm talking about the scorched, which is absolutely zombies. It is literally a disease that you catch by coming into contact with others infected with it. Causing you to become hostile and dangerous to those not infected.
---
Do you even know what a zombie is or do you think it has to always be the "dawn of the dead" type to be zombies? Did you forget I am Legend? Those are considred zombies in that movie and novel as well. 
---
So no, not talking ghouls because radiation isn't contagious. The fact you don't know the lore well enough to know that the scorch plague is pretty much the exact same thing as the zombie plagues in other games and movies, such as I am legend, The Last of Us, etc.
---
Yeah, and technically what I am talking about wouldn't be a nerf. Armor still has the same exact stats, but perks and weapons have the ability to do more damage to it..
---
That was a great Inside the Vault. I can't wait!!
---
It will probably be the usual luck of the draw. Which may not be too bad it could prevent someone from hoarding all the really high-level equipment and then selling it back to us at a phenomenal increase in caps.
---
I expect the same, with only the formula being up for debate.
---
That‚Äôs thing I can‚Äôt hear people at all or talk like every time someone else is in game chat it just has the X beside the mic icon as if I I have them muted and I tried to mute and unmute them still doesn‚Äôt work
---
Got that one. But thanks
---
I got trapped in someones house one doing this... thankfully they were nearby and let me out.
---
The one remaining member of the "government" is Sam Blackwell.  They wanted to find him, but they never mention succeeding.  He's still out there.  And was probably working with some of the Free States members to try to eliminate Eckhart.  Of course, in the process he found out about MODUS and their plans.
---
I think the person in the crate was Blackwell.  He was part of the team (knowing the layout) that infiltrated the Enclave and tried to destroy MODUS (thus why MODUS was damaged) but didn't get the job done before having to exfiltrate.  Most of the team was probably killed, and Blackwell used a loading crate for an about-to-leave cargobot to escape.  Possibly loaded with a cryopod (though that's questionable.)
---
He knows he can't defeat MODUS and the Enclave directly at this point (though he probably isn't aware that MODUS killed everyone in The Bunker) and sees the Weather Control System at the ATLAS Observatory as the potential weapon that could do it (completely flooding the bunker, for example.)
---
And thus the 'Nuclear Winter' is simply what happens when that system is improperly activated.  Possibly Blackwell set it up to activate on a timer (so he had time to get out of WV) but when the systems failed the timer stopped.  Something re-activates power, and the system activates.....and the Nuclear Winter begins....
---
It's certainly a possibility......
---
Lol, yes exactly, as they are dining on their fallen comrades
---
Thanks
---
I've been playing since lunch and have 2 alts in the hundreds because I only play survival now and leveling up is super fast.  Eventually everyone gets to the point where there is nothing else to do. Hopefully at some point they will release proper new content.
---
Typing and emotes do 99% of it for you. That being said, I'm pretty sure the golden age of trading has passed. It's almost impossible to find anything tier 1 now that doesn't involve mules, greater than max caps, and/or promise of sexual favors.
---
Ohhhh forgot the /s sorry!!
---
Have they added CAMP invulnerability yet?  
---
I'm not putting a vending machine down to advertise my CAMP to all the griefers.
---
Thank you tooooo
---
It's how I've seen it most referred to. Not knowing the exact mechanism, that's a fairly accurate approximation.
---
That is odd, because I've seen level 5 legendaries before in flatwoods, a legendary mongrel dog in that cabin by flatwoods with the pack of dogs in it. But that was a while ago maybe it can't spawn there anymore. Not sure if they changed that. 
---
If you want to see more legendaries, go to nuke zones, you'll see a lot of legendary ghouls in nuke zones.
---
I would rather have a choice than another RNG re-roll.
---
I also think the explosive weapons in the game are too popular and hope the purveyor isn't giving them out like candy
---
This
---
Lww
---
I claimed one last night and build a huge structure around the actual workshop bench. Everything else is unlocked, but no one can actually steal it from me without having to destroy the building, haha
---
I have been saving junk three stars.  Looks like there is no particular reason to do so, because we will be able to sell one stars all day long.
---
Yeah, bethesda announced that 20% damage increase when they changed it. Go look at the patch notes lol...
---
I really need a teddy bear book shelf.
---
I still think they should have just permabanned them. Bethesda giving them hopes made them post same thing over and over and I'm getting a bit sick of it
---
Yeah i already understood what you meant with your first post :D Blizzard is a very old company with a very old history of complains about its games. I bet random itemization, endgame content and balance topics are pretty common in every mmorpg. Such games just grew with time and thats what made them what you know from them today. 
---
Fallout 76 is not even a year old and already faced all kinds of complains. Hell this game is getting hate for content that is not even released yet and everyone is complaining about its balance and unfair rng, but in some years **if** the games still exists i can bet with you again that noone ever will talk about this again and laugh about people that are still complaining about weird tse explosive weapons that are believed the strongest weapons in this game. Pvp is something that always will have its up and downs even in Wow or other Mmos. I mean do i really need to explain this :x? Look at League of Legends and other Mobas. \*cough\*  In the end we just need to keep trust into Bethesda and their game studio xD Hopefully they don't ignore this game, because it's not profitable anymore and just shutdown the servers.
---
Yea rng re-roll would such for this, and I dont think you should be worried on the explosives, technically the game considers them one of the rarest weapons, so itll forsure be expensive if they come out
---
What is you're shotgun? Someone else might buy it if you're just gonna toss it :V
---
You can take all 3... I've done it multiple times.
---
Agreed, that was extremely fun and satisfying (after stealing a couple items)
---
I don't think Anthem would exist without EA, and we'd be playing a completely different Mass Effect: Andromeda.
---
Hmmm, I've yet to (as far as I know) lose a single thing that wasn't dropped, I wish there was a good way to verify the glitch though for people having trouble. But also people have been known to come onto this reddit and lie about things many times so I could see why Bethesda may be apprehensive to do something about it.
---
Gangs And Nasty Griefers
---
That's how I leveled early on!
---
Very true.
---
Another post that seriously makes me wonder how many people in this forum actually play the game and how many are just trolls who don't play it at all.  So many posts complain about things that I never encounter at all and the ones that complain about things that I actually do encounter get down voted.
---
Yeah. I know what you're talking about. Sometimes if you toggle between auto and area, one of them will work. But not most of the time. I do wish they would fix it.
---
It all depends on where I am and who is around. If I'm at WS and I don't see anyone nearby on the map, I'm using my quad shotgun to take down everything in the least amount of shots. 
---
If I see other people there, then I'll use a rifle (while still using shotgun perk cards), so that I can just tag each enemy and let others get their hits in. More often than not, one of those other people is using a really strong melee weapon and killing everything while standing in front of the rest of the mobs, preventing others from getting hits in.
---
So survival mode remains garbage with the scoreboard still revealing your position ob the map. What a waste of an otherwise excellent mode.
---
I have mine filled with normal wine that I just picked up in the clubhouse at the golf course.
---
Back when the game first came out. My friend and I were at his camp. We were getting out stuff together to got out into the wasteland again. I noticed I had spoiled food in my inventory again. I thought to myslef, "Is this the equivalent of taking a shit in the game? I asked my friend and he said," yeah I can agree with that. It makes sense...Wait why are you asking this?" I replied,"Because I'm taking a shit on your bed!" 
---
We had a big laugh about it and began shitting on each others beds for a while until I found the port-a-toilet plan. Now we always drop out spoiled foods in there. God I love this game.
---
If you read it (which I doubt you did) you would see that I am claiming that SOME of the suspensions were false (as Bethesda is not perfect).  
---
 Is Bethesda perfect and incapable of making mistakes? (Yes / No)
---
Is it IMPOSSIBLE that Bethesda accidentally banned innocent players in their broken game? (Yes / No)
---
Im willing to bet, no mTter what bethesda does this subreddit will be a shitstorm anyways lol
---
Wires use build budget?
---
They're pretty terrible, honestly. The letters aren't filled, there are large gaps in letters, the lights are a dim yellow.
---
From a distance, it's impossible to read what it says. Not worth it, IMO.
---
Problem is in destiny all legendary items have locked stats so it made sense. When you can have a hundred different roll possibilities on a weapon this doesn't work at all. Should have been like division where you can re roll 1 stat. With so many variations it could take 2 years to find what you want.
---
&gt;Flamer Fuel created via crafting increased from 5 to 20.
---
That....still isn't nearly enough to make flamers viable is it &gt;_&gt;
---
But what an excellent use for that one star wood armor that no one uses.
---
The announcer today there's a legendary exchange machine that you put them in exchange for script the more scrip you have the better stuff you can buy from the legendary vendor when she arrives also the more stars your legendary weapon has the more script you get.
---
They did it this way to prevent congestion on the day the legendary vendor arrives you can already have everything exchanged in show up and buy what you want

luckily no one on earth cares what you think
---
OP might get fake internet points for a fake story, OH NO! WE MUST STOP THIS TRAVESTY!
---
If I have to choose between 3* Ghoul Slayer's Lead Pipe or 3* Nocturnal Wood Left Leg... I prefer to try a reroll on my most useful items rather than buying junk.
---
Someone else already said it but yeah, it‚Äôs bugged. My icon has been the Nuka-Cola Cap for the longest time but people often see the Vault-Boy
---
I got the 50 terminals using a reload at one of the bunkers.  Took only a few hours.
---
Will we be getting that C.A.M.P. passive mode protection with the vending machines? Because all I see are people putting their camps on the map and having others come and destroy them. 
---
Also can we please do something about this ridiculous 25k cap limit? 
---
There is no logical reason for us to be capped to begin with. If you are a vendor or trading out in a wasteland why can you not make all the money you want. How does that possibly effect any kind of in game economy? Can someone explain that?
---
Even if we just double it to 50k it's a lot more reasonable.
---
What do you mean? It can work just like in survival mode, with legendaries coming every week, albeit better. Pretty sure bethesda has an idea as to what rolls may be good together like in survival, it wouldnt be an RNG inventory itd be pre-selected
---
+1 I love a good recursive acronym
---
white knight is only for non-PA builds though
---
Back when the game first came out. My friend and I were at his camp. We were getting out stuff together to got out into the wasteland again. I noticed I had spoiled food in my inventory again. I thought to myslef, "Is this the equivalent of taking a shit in the game? I asked my friend and he said," yeah I can agree with that. It makes sense...Wait why are you asking this?" I replied,"Because I'm taking a shit on your bed!" We had a big laugh about it and began shitting on each others beds for a while until I found the port-a-toilet plan. Now we always drop out spoiled foods in there. God I love this game.
---
For real what is this shit? Taxation is theft Bethesda.
---
Should be able to sell it for 500 to 1000 caps because legendary vendor is coming and there is a market for all 3 stars items
---
Not bad, not bad at all!
---
Yeah, sure... however... one can argue that 'shine is a part of the economic history of the area. "Toothless, shoeless hillbillies", while historically accurate, is just inviting the kind of internet debate that does nobody any good.
---
Great change for plasma weapons. Laser weapons still need a bit of love (they're not terrible, but they're still not in a good place). You never see anyone running around with laser gear, even legendary. The occasionally gatling laser, sure, but...
---
Interesting to note that the legendary vendor is mentioned as female. Up until now the mole miners were basically just an unknown creature that could be anything under that armor. I wonder if she‚Äôll have a voice of some sort.
---
We does this make me think of Drax in Guardians of the Galaxy. I stand so still I become invisible. Hehe
---
I do play... Daily actually and today alone I've had two separate people one with uranium fever another With jail break. I killed every mutant and just let the last with the nuke hit the door purely because they came to the event I watched them run round the front to the edge of the event and they stood there they weren't afk because area chat was on. Maybe you're just lucky or maybe I'm just unlucky but it happens either way
---
There are so many specific builds where stuff just won't work. Not a single weapon that has dropped or they have announced for the future of survival fits my build or is even close.
---
Well well well how the turn tables lmao looks like no re roll system but instead you turn in legendaries for tokens you then buy what you want.
---
These PvP servers are all dead. Noone is playing bevause they know the mechanics are broken.
---
I've yet to find a single legendary hunting rifle and I want a good roll on one so bad :'(
---
Who cares.

[Me when this update drops and I'll finally be able to sell all my known plans and piles upon piles of junk I don't need:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMuYfScGpbE)
---
correct
---
I always get sweet drops.
---
Just got a bloodied war drum. 2* 
---
Usually a armour peice for showing up to the event with the flux included. Plus other loot .
---
We do have to think about the things being added which is going to affect the over all drop rates legendarys are more common in weird places.
---
Im seeing more legendary creatures in every location. 
---
Also go kill a Legendary Strangler Queen more often do somthing different maybe that will help there is alot of odd events and challenges that do drop wicked loot and thats were i got recipe for radaway was heart of the swamp .
---
People do afk some events. The worst case was Fasnacht, but I've seen people afk Encryptid as well. Makes sense, since there are lots of people running around killing enemies anyway, and if you die you respawn in the circle so no harm done. People do this when they want to farm the event for rewards.
---
Well if you absolutely feel you must participate in a voluntary transaction I'd go with the 3* Nocturnal Wood Left Leg.
---
But mostly if what I want or am interested isn't in the shop I will be patient and I will still do what I do now, farm Whitesprings and West-Tek and try my RNG.
---
But if that scrip is burning a hole in your pocket, go for it.
---
Everything else IS worthless
---
The Legendary Scrip you receive from Exchange Machines is all yours and cannot be traded--except to the Purveyor, of course!
---
You get more scrip the more stars the weapon has.
---
Those things are actually pretty viable with the right perks. For some reason (bug? feature?), pipe weapons benefit from both pistol and rifle perks if you slap a stock onto them, so in theory you could boost the damage by 120% plus the 60% damage boost from demo expert.
---
I did find a two-shot explosive 50 caliber machine gun. All it does is eat up my ammo.
---
Yes im so excited either way!
---
Watch out, the point is flying right above your head.

---
Damnit can we just get rid of the top 3 player map markers in survival or call it deathmatch mode and make a proper survival mode?!
---
Ive not had a good one drop to be fair, just that one in a vendor
---
You're probably right on the second half, to some extent at least.
---
I love floating bases.  I never played fo4.  The point of this post is evident in the post.  A long time fallout player was urging caution at building them.  People on this sub said that‚Äôs paranoid, it‚Äôs fine.  End of discussion as far as I‚Äôm concerned.   Are you still confused?
---
It's really not, I 1 shot everything with my 1 star legendaries except the SBQ and ISS. You can't kill anything harder than already dead.
---
I believe they do... Now I'm not sure?!?
---
It's going to be all 2* mid tier weapons/armor to help out the casual players.
---
Pets?!?
---
&gt;Caps from your sale, minus a nominal fee of 10% to maintain a healthy in-game economy, will be added to your Cap balance. 
---
I have it on good authority that that extra 10% goes directly into Todd's account.
---
I doubt this item is worth less than 8.000, but thanks anyways.
---
True.  But I can scoop up 15 1*s in each play session.  So I don‚Äôt think I will go out of my way to find and keep anymore junk 3*s.   I will just play the game and scrap....err...scrip....the 1*s.
---
This is getting downvoted but I seriously want to know why? 
---
What benefit does a 10% tax provide?
---
I know right! It's absolutely stupid. I was so excited when survival got announced. I thought we were getting a proper survival experience. Turns out its just deathmatch mode.
---
BGS get rid of the frigging map markers in survival mode or make a blooming proper one!!
---
600 hours here an i have yet to find god roll weapon either. But i have found enough decent weapons and armor that other people would want and ive treaded my way to a bloodied explosive handmade and some other really nice pieces. The market on here is really good and there's one on Facebook i buy things from. Keep grinding until you get that unicorn to drop.
---
Nah, but yesterday I found a junk bag next to the overseer‚Äôs camp that had 6 most empty fusion cores and like 600 lead ore. I took the cores and some of the lead, and put the rest of the junk in the chest at the camp for others.
---
They definitely do
---
More stash space please!!! If vending machine stuff has to be kept in a stash, we need room for it!
---
Low level legendaries definitely still spawn. I run Leader of the Pack every time I see it because it guarantees 3 level 5-10 legendary items. I over-repair them, full mod them out, and then hand them out to low level players as gifts.
---
The other night I went to Lucky Hole and the was a 2 star level 1 radroach in one of the little cabins outside. He rewarded me with a 3 star level 1 instigating pipe bolt action with faster reload and bonus VATS crit damage.
---
L50 junkie's explosive combat. Not really my first choice but it's the only explosive anything I've ever found
---
Shotgun barrel will make dmg modifiers reliant on shotgun perks. Same with the semi-auto/auto for rifleman/commando.
---
You claim to be doing most of the work, but how can you be doing the work when you are watching what everyone else is doing?  I couldn't tell you what anyone else at an event is doing because I am too busy killing stuff.  You are complaining about people being spectators but you talk  like a spectator.
---
Right! This is so freaking heartbreaking to watch play out. I can't believe it
---
Invulnerability goes live the same patch as vending machines. As long as your not hostile to another player your camp is safe :)
---
So you've seen the kinds of items that are going to be sold? You know that they're junk?
---
I did it, got ingame challenge for 76, but not PS4 one
---
\&gt; Caps from your sale, minus a nominal fee of 10% to maintain a healthy in-game economy, will be added to your Cap balance.    
---
So basically I'll need to charge 10% more than what I want to get for an item.
---
&gt; Sorry that you couldn't understand my comment.
---
Sorry that you can't understand that if the Purveyor doesn't have items in inventory that interest you that you can be patient and just wait or sell them to Regular vendors/players, put them in containers or just plain drop them.
---
Less RNG and more player autonomy.
---
Read the post. The last sentence, in particular. Thanks for your participation.
---
Just wondering, where is this located on the map?
---
I would be in favor of rerolling perks IF it was expensive such as say you trade 50 stars worth of items for a random reroll on a perk. This would give a chance at getting the perk to make your item what you want but still random chances with lots of collecting to pay the cost which would mitigate any worries about flooding the game with OP gear.
---
Silo codes get posted every week online!
---
...and I've already got a bunch of shotgun perks I can lay on. Hadn't thought of that. Damn, this perk shuffling!
---
ITS POOP AGAIN!
---
Because 1 they're no where to be seen 2 area chat like I mentioned üòÇ when you can hear them coughing, chewing and breathing I know they're there and when the events failed bring up the map and shock they're still where they ran off to
---
^^^ This one understands Capitalism
---
That woud be completely fair.
---
pretty sure it doesn't. still counts as rifleman (semi/bolt).
---
What happens in West Virginia stays in West Virginia
---
I just really don‚Äôt like that the vending machine items have to stay in your stash, taking up valuable space. Why not have a vending stash that is separate, and cannot do anything but hold items for the machine? Something besides taking up that real stash space. 
---
You would almost have to have a separate character just for vending, then have to move items and caps around. I hope this storage mechanic is reconsidered in the future, or the stash space is increased.
---
And lots of rifled to scrap and sell...
---
They could have at least made it optional. If you want to play the game like its deathmatch then turn opt in for the top 3 show down via your pip boy.
---
You still don't understand the point of this post, do you?
---
Well, I tried. Hey, if you didn't get it, you didn't get it. It's fine.
---
I switched at about level 30 to primarily sledgehammer, ski sword and use guns for sniping. 
---
At that point combat started to take less time and now I have more ammo than I know what to do with. 
---
If you don‚Äôt use it start using the feature at the crafting table to flag junk with lead it. It has a name, but I‚Äôm having a brain fart.  If your not currently using it you‚Äôll be surprised. Batteries, toys, pencils, or dumbbells in the hotel north of Flatwoods. 
---
Alternatively take the workshop at the old ammunition factory and power it up. Free ammo as long as you own it. I took it a couple times, but always get chased out of workshops by other players.
---
So the Purveyor is Vivian Garrahan, right?
---
So your comment makes no point..it only benefits you to save 3*. Doesn't matter if you can find more 1*, you can also save any 3* you find and also turn them in, for better returns.
---
It sold well, that's it. 4 million copies sold in a bit over a year, 70million worth in the US alone by 2006. So explain to me how this game is supposed to sustain itself when *it didn't sell well*? When it was on sale for less than half price by black Friday?
---
See, there's nothing *actually pay to win* in the game, and you can cite all kinds of things not actually implemented in the game like fridges.. but we don't know how those will be implemented. Likely it'll just be another crafting station.
---
Yes, there's crap repair kits you can buy for 50 cents (or less than what you get by daily atoms for free),  which only noobs might buy, or people trying to support the developers.. but why buy those when you get 3 **good ones** for killing the scorch beast queen? Free of course.
---
What are you really spreading except scare tactics? Anti consumerism? You don't have to buy anything in the game. I've gotten countless skins and shit, all for free. Basically you're full of shit, trying to compare a game that has nothing remotely in common with this one, *because it did so well*.. but let's be real. That's almost 20 years ago, and any/all online games were new to players, that's why we played shit games like that one.
---
I've been saving loads of legendary weapons. I don't know why,  I've got loads of caps and really good weapons that I use. Just don't want to throw anything away. Help!
---
modern renegade + 2 shot weapon, or laser with splitter is pretty good too
---
Are you PMing everyone that disagrees with you lol
---
Not to worry. 3* Legendary creatures drop the same 1* crap.
---
This stuff bothers me so much. At work people would cover the Dell logo with an Apple one from their iPhone and it was so cringey
---
escape artist in agility allows me to repeatedly sneak attack the queen with melee attacks with countless people around.
---
Oh, then also get VATS perk. It‚Äôs basically auto targeting.  Not as good as the old games but it‚Äôs an option for you.
---
Oh I know. I have a handmade TSE and have demo (meh) and another character that I built entirely around pipe weapons. If only it was a bolt action, not a standard pistol...
---
Anthem was much better at launch than FO76 was at launch. Sure FO76 is better now after half a year of updates. Do you feel good about yourself now?
---
u/Valseek: Question about the Plasma Gun buff: 
---
Is this also affecting Plasma Gatling? And/or is the fix for the single-shot issue + disappearing ammunition coming with Patch 9 for core-based weapons?  
---
You sure are a grumpy little one.
---
It needs to come back
---
I saw a guy last night going camp to camp on PC.  This was in Adventure mode, going camp to camp and one shotting people around the map.   He got near 900 cap wanted in the hour I was there.  Complete dickwad.
---
It does not do this. It‚Äôs still counts a rifle.
---
Aw, no problem! Thank you for posting! Yes, it's that last sentence in particular that I'm asking about, actually: you mentioned "buying junk" which implies that you have an understanding of what you can buy - can you expand on this point? What kinds of junk are you talking about?
---
You are the one making a huge deal about it, I basically just gave the 4chan answer more politely.
---
Theyve pulled a couple of the lead devs off of Anthem to work on Dragon Age 4 which sounds like its going to be just like Anthem and probably just as much of a dumpster fire. Dont think theyve halted support for Anthem completely but it looks like they are starting to give up.
---
I hope you make camps invincible for this patch or this will be a pr nightmare.
---
It‚Äôs still a rifle perk dependent gun. Shotgun mods don‚Äôt affect it.
---
Yeah totally on bored. The soil floors from 4 would be another big bonus addition
---
I just want to find him once.
---
It's been happening a lot to me lately as well and I play every single day. Just because you havent had it happen to you doesnt mean it doesnt. 
---
Less and less people will take pylons at encrypted. The last 3 times I've done it, it failed. And I was taking multiple pylons. There were at least 7 people there. 
---
Did free range and had a level 55 just linger behind the cows the whole time. Only came in at the end, took one hit on the sheepsquatch, did nothing to protect the brahmin which two of them died. 
---
Did uranium fever. Dude literally put power armor on and idled there til the event was over. 
---
It happens a lot.
---
I agree with you that is how they are probably going to do it. 
---
I would like to see you get tokens and you choose which effect you wish to reroll. For example, if you have a Two shot weapon all ready, you may just want to reroll the other two effects. 
---
I would also like to  see the ability to use tokens to level up or down a weapon. I could turn that level 35 TSE handmade I got into a level 45.
---
why are you being a dick about it? geez, lighten up, its a video game man wow
---
Maybe the Chinese were onto something...
---
I'm gonna keep my powder dry until we get more info but I'm wary about where it feels like they're going with this legendary vendor scrip scheme.
---
I mean yeah, cool, fine: break down legendary items into scrip, exchange the scrip for new legendary items. I get that. 
---
But previous interviews made this sound like we'd be trading in our legendaries to re-rolling for legendary stats on gear we've got. But this sounds like another X-01 Calibrated Shocks moment where we scrap like I dunno 50 2-3\* weps and save up I dunno like 2,000 L-Scrip and head on out to the legendary vendor who has a semi-random assortment of glorified garbage and so we have to server hop and server hop and server hop and go back day after day after day until we finally (FINALLY) find that one thing we're looking for. And I'm just not sure sure about how much I want to deal with 'those' mechanics yet again.
---
Just go play adventure. People will still PvP you there, trust me .
---
It is entirely their fault, they keep shoehorning divisive mechanics into the game with poorly planned announcements and marketing. 
---
It is inevitable with poor communication that people are going to be pissed.
---
yikes
---
Are we getting the backpack stuff when it comes out?
---
Too bad we can't also charge a "convenience fee" for using our vending machines :D
---
??? Really. False advertising!!!!
---
Legendary Exchange Machines

I am going to be a couple of hundreds of pounds lighter now.
---
Go to glassed caverns and kite a king in to the last cave, there's a queen and hunter next to each other by the fissure.
---
No ones stopping you.
---
Think of it as adding a Micro-transaction to your Vending machine :)
---
Mine definitely works as does the people I play with.
---
You‚Äôre right it does!
---
Apparently if you drink from it, then immediately start spamming collect, you can get a bunch quick, with the risk of catching a disease.  
---
If I had a better source of disease cure (or ever remembered to use the sulfur drinking fountain in Whitespring), I'd probably be OK with that.
---
Glad it's not just me then.... Or does that make you a troll too üòÇüòâ
---
Totally missing the point
---
We need a money sink, as you can see caps are very easy to gain, at the point that a lot of legendary weapons and armor sold from other players require trading with same quality gears and/or a big ammount of caps, this mean caps are worth nothing atm, if we have more kinds of money sink, cap can be a more valuable resource and can be the actual value instead of trading items
---
(see my note below)
---
you really are a horrible person arent you? you just like to argue for no reason on the internet? 
---
i actually feel sorry for you, i hope you can get help with your anger issues, but i bet you just keep spouting hate
---
Have you guys considered letting this be a tradeable item? I think it would work as a great form of currency for people who max their caps or don't have ammo to trade. Or just as a great item to buy off people who want their shot at certain rolls for certain weapons/armor.
---
Either way, I think this will be one of the best new features in the game yet!
---
That's a good idea!
---
Yea the factions are so underwhelming now, you can just join them all and the entire faction is just vendor selling robots
---
You shouldn't need to got to reddit to build your character.  That's ridiculous actually.

"Death is a preferable alternative to communism." - Liberty Prime - Micheal Scott
---
Should've just kept farming that during double XP weekend, lol.
---
This! How am I supposed to show off all my Mr Fuzzy‚Äôs and Teddies?
---
Yeah but it is still Bioware, and EA. Anthem as a concept is a great idea and it would have been a great game if Bioware didnt have terrible management. These are the people that made Dragon Age, and Mass Effect. People expect a certain kind of experience from them as well.
---
But does the queen register in the camera? That's the problem we had. It wasn't about getting the king to the queen (which sucked), it was the fact the queen wouldn't register in the camera at any range or angle. The spawn and king photographed fine.
---
This is what I did: In South of Watoga (that little shack with pond), I killed king first. Then I got close to the pond to lure queen out. Led the queen until the king's corpse. Fought the queen in that spot. When the queen spawned the little hatchlings, I killed the hatchlings near the king's corpse. Then kill the queen. Basically just stack all the corpses close by for the camera. Dead corpses count for the challenge.
---
upvoting for using the word 'whinging'
---
No, no. The last sentence of the *post*, in which I say "this are only my impressions, of course, and I hope I'm wrong".
---
I like the automatic mod the best since you can spam all 15 shots until a mass of mobs are dead, using bloody tesla too.
---
CALL ME SIR ONE MORE TIME!!!
---
I hope your wrong too but I'm not getting my hopes up. At least we'll be able to clear some stash space anyway!
---
Was wondering about the cap increase too, but they nerfed explosive combat shotguns so I don't think anything is worth that much money anymore.
---
If they register in the camera. Our queen refused to register for the camera under any circumstances.
---
I went to Autumn Acre's Cabin and there's two lvl 80 and a 65. The three made for a nice snap shot.
---
Wil this player vending include power armor?
---
I placed my CAMP here, too. My place is built around the hay bales so I can use them as a natural wall to enclose my generators and water pump. The enemies that spawn by the pond have decent junk and there are a lot of decent nodes nearby.
---
Agreed
---
Much needed stash space indeed.
---
Farming is half the fun in this game. If you are able to get god rolls that easily it would totally kill it for some people
---
This guy fallouts.
---
Help is on the way!
---
I have been saving up junk 3 stars for two months.  Such was apparently not worth my time.
---
I hate to break it to you but you can do that with non legendary weapons and a proper perk loadout.
---
Are you still interested in doing the silo together? 
---
Tonight or tomorrow morning?
---
I'm not saying it should be easy. Just that it should be *possible* to reroll.
---
She has wicked calf muscles.
---
Yeah for me as well. I even went and discovered with an alt, it said it discovered it but didn't register, so idk
---
at least I can loose a couple hundred pounds and even collect more legendaries. thank you so much for adding this in. I was already come close to max carry weight and didnt think i could make it to the end of the month.
---
dupers fucked this games economy, and it will never recover fully thanks to those cheaters
---
&gt; When I want to sell something, I'll just decide the price I want to get, and then I'll increase it so that -10% results in the price I want.
---
You are correct. Welcome to Capitalism.
---
&gt; The explanation "maintain a healthy in-game economy" - what does that even mean?
---
Players will be selling booze, chems, ammo, armor and weapons in a supply and demand style. Price it too high and it will fill your stash and you get no caps.
---
Price it too low and you don't get your time worth out of it.
---
Hopefully they will tweak fuel consumption rates as well imo that is where the real issue is.
---
Yep, makes zero sense. Unless it's adding to the game's bot vendor's caps. Then you could get the fee back at least.
---
Almost all games have this sort of 'fee' on similar things and even real life. I don't mind it. It's only 10%.
---
Keep this morally bankrupt Trash off the Beth forum
---
I'm at 400 hours in, max caps just from selling junk. I have unlocked 95% of camp and weapon plans. I have nothing to spend money on. I've been fast traveling everywhere just to use some. 
---
I'd love to have a vendor shop but theres really no point in it with a low cap limit.  Dont know why that's downvote worthy.
---
WHO POOPED THE BED? WAS IT CHARLIE OR FRANK?
---
What can I say, when people can't understand simple concepts... man, that pisses me off.
---
It didn‚Äôt really explicitly say but I do really hope we will be able to sell known plans. I have so many I can sell and will be pretty bummed if that‚Äôs not part of it.
---
That one is generally caused when you are crouching for some reason.
---
u/BlitzBurgh216
---
Not good. Put it this way. On one forum I'm one who really really panned Fallout 76 (plus has a lot of people who already have a lot of hate for Bethesda), the Fallout 76 thread topic is still somewhat active (especially when updates happen). Even when updates happen on RDR2 (and this forum likes Rockstar games in general, at least a lot more than Bethesda), we get  few responses usually saying still nothign to do in the game.
---
At least RDR2 had an excellent single player. Even if R\* is going to ignore it in favor of MP. I'm kinda hoping at this point MP fails so bad they actually try to make some more money off it by putting out SP DLC (I'll buy that R\*, I ain't paying a dime for your microtransactions though). I didn't have much hope before, I still don't, but this gives me a little more hope that it is possible enough to hope for at least.
---
I don‚Äôt I tried that I will have to try it
---
Yes, I was hoping the vending machines would be separate, hopefully they increase the size soon.
---
Without sounding rude how is Bethesda not seen as a AAA company? 
---
  In terms of the ‚Äútrack record of Uber quality games‚Äù I‚Äôd say both developers have had some pretty major successes/failures under their belts?
---
I have the blue head lamp with mine.
---
Its Perfect, wouldnt be enough shine without it!
---
Devs. Devs care.
---
It's the type of negative publicity that they actively try to avoid.
---
Lol.. At least it was not on fire.. Thereby being hot and steaming. But person is creative tho
---
They better, or I'll still play and be mildly peeved about it.  Maybe mildly peeved is too harsh as I really don't have anything to sell at the moment, but I'll be something that may be construed as almost being upset.
---
Running around the same place is always boring. FYI you'll get just about as many legendary spawns taking walks in higher level areas. Hell I found a 3* leveled super mutant in the Asheap the other day. Running smacking helpless robots was boring.
---
I agree Anthem was better at launch but was lacking contentment after 20 hours of gameplay. I feel great, thanks for asking!
---
Yeah its funny, I bought 76 at release. Got mad and deleted it, prayed RDO would be better.
---
RDO comes out. Play for two weeks. Get mad and stop playing. Prayed Anthem would finally be the new online game to play.
---
Anthem comes out. What. The. Fuck. Delete Anthem. 
---
New 76 patches. 76 roadmap. New 76 content.
---
Redownloads FO76. 
---
Finally. A fun new online game.
---
Yep, hopefully they give us proper factions at some point. Progress is so slow though I am convinced we are dealing with a skeleton crew over there.
---
Did the body break up due to perk? The head and the other body parts can be separated or blow up due to perk and I believe only the head is recognized by the camera.
---
&gt;You need to engage in the social aspect of the game: someone has the gear that you want in the world, and they probably want to trade it or sell it. I
---
There  are only a very few select items that are viable in PVP.  If people acquire them through grinding, they don't want to get rid of them. 
---
Everyone is looking for the same stuff.
---
I got a feeling shotguns are about to go into oblivion. I use mine primarily to cripple enemies,but they were reliable at close range.
---
Is that a bug though? Look at all the enjoyment we are getting from it :)
---
I see the hunter and the Queen. Where is the King?
---
I agree with you.  But trading has been the remedy for poor loot system design.
---
i suppose the reasoning is... they still need to track the items, and if they make it separate, we'll just fill up the vending machines with all our hoarding.
---
I HAVE TO PAY TAXES??!!??  THEN WHY ARE WV'S ROADS SO BAD????  LOOK AT THEM! THEY'RE IN RUINS AND I GOTTA PAY TAXES!!!!  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING WITH THE MONEY????
---
Oh, hold up.  Sorry.  My bad.  I actually meant to post this in the /r/WestVirginia subreddit.   My rant as nothing to do with the Fallout 76 update.  Looking forward to it.
---
Nope. 3 whole corpses.
---
Well maybe us trolls can play together so we actually have people who do the events properly.
---
Absolutely. I‚Äôd suggest waiting until you have at least 5 of the same map to make it more worth your time.
---
Reroll's gonna make it so easy to farm god rolls... I got bunch of 3 star items that could use some reroll like bloodied/40% bashing damage/vats cost 25% reduction and stuff like that. That's a god roll item if reroll is allowed
---
Gah... So exactly what we all thought... NOT. I don't think I mind this system. We'll see how it works out.
---
Besthesda is hoping you can't mathz.
---
Enable 2FA on your Xbox account.
---
Let's hope there isn't a cap on the tokens one can accumulate from the legendary vendor.
---
Too bad it seems Bethesda does not in this case. I can't believe they tried to turn player vending into a caps sink.
---
My level 50 legendary 3* pickaxe with vampire faster swing speed and End 1. 
---
Poof gone
---
I don't think it's cross-platform though.
---
600 lead ore would make my year
---
The complete axing of private lobbies is what kept me away entirely. The only reason my group even still plays GTAO at this point is because there's so much (sometimes literally) invested in it.
---
üòÇ Feel free to add me if you're ps4
---
Wait what kind of bloodied weapons?
---
everyone that leaves every day allow the entire vault to be filled with fresh air every day
---
With encrypted can't it be damaged while it is invisible? Because we got it really low when I took 2/3 pylons and when I finally died they killed it and the corpse was using the stealth invisibility so it was hard to find, making me think it can be damaged without the pylons activated and that why people are to lazy to use them. If not then everyone that does the event that doesn't do pylons are really dumb and can't read the event objectives.
---
I'm okay with being wrong. And I hope you are right that "items" isn't pre spec'd weapons/armor but useful legendary mods.
---
Im ok with them straight up removing ALL duped items, people can cry all they want but they never should have gotten those things in the first place
---
its really the only way to save the economy, which is currently fucked
---
I'll agree with you that they don't have the track record of uber quality games (at least when it comes to the game running smoothly) but I think most people consider Bethesda AAA honestly. But yes, I'm actually surprised people were surprised 76 was janky. Since when did Bethesda ever have a rep for games that didn't have a lot of bugs?
---
Legendary Armor is such an RNG and fashion nightmare. :( So hard to get the right stats + armor type combinations and it's to a point where you simply can't earn it, there's just too many dice rolls to be possible.
---
Gtfo of here with that misinformation. If they're OP then so are the 1500 damage gauntlets.  My explosive shotgun does upper 200s.  Big deal.
---
Yep, display cases are supposed to be on the way.
---
as it stands...........its shit.
---
try moding it with hardened reciever and piercing mag. not so shit !
---
should bring the damage up ......a lot
---
piercing mag is ,i think 40% anyway. then should get better price.
---
personally, 8/10k for a shotgun ?  madness !     wouldn't pay 10% of that for any gun. but thats just me.
---
It's a 10ÔºÖ imposed sales tax that goes to Bethesda - sucks for the Free State rollplayers, eh?
---
Oh ffs. Please tell me this is a piss take?
---
Have they really no clue?
---
...to maintain a healthy In game economy?  Maybe I missed a patch or two but since when did we ever have a healthy in game economy to maintain? I don‚Äôt call a 1400 vendor cap healthy.
---
Whoa... automatic sounds great. Did you get a plan or mod? Remember where you found it? And oh crap, time to shuffle perk cards again!
---
The rifle barrel on the skin looks like the Chinese Rifle we still dont have in game yet.
---
Country Roads took you home to the place you belong.
---
&gt;But trading has been the remedy for poor loot system design.
---
Which means the poor loot system design is the problem.
---
Yes, I was also hoping they would be separate, having a shop inventory and your own personal playing stash share the same amount is disappointing. Hopefully they will increase the stash size soon or even better have a vending machine allowance.
---
Thanks for the suggestions so far :) I was considering further south towards the Ash Heap or up towards Morgantown, I'll do some scouting soon and see if I find something nice. My first 2 camps were behind the Morgantown station, I really like the area and having that garden nearby was helpful.
---
It's 10% I don't have to pay in the markets, especially for 10k+ priced items.
---
There needs to be a cap on the fee, why would I pay hundreds of caps to sell something, when I can do it for free somewhere else? 
---
Another piss poor decision by Bethesda, IMO.
---
Phantom Pooper is the hero we all need. Please tell me you‚Äôre on PS4.
---
Ranged should always be a little lower then melee imo, melee has yo get right up in there and is at a greater risk then just exploding everything 30 yards out
---
&gt; I totally understand balancing weapons but when my explosive shotgun is getting around 250 points of damage and my bloodied Machette is over 400, something seems off.
---
Yes, melee, especially bloodied melee, is ridiculously over performing and needs to be nerfed a bit.
---
It's a fee for convenience.  You can always still directly to players. It is worth 10% to me so I don't have to wait around on players to show up when I could be out getting more stuff to sell or use.
---
Its only a level 40. 5k max to someone who really wants it.
---
It's going to be a system where you, I guess, put in weapons and you'll get like a ticket to bring to the legendary vendor to buy legendary weapons with. The tickets are like currency.
---
Yeah that would suck I‚Äôd be okay with that only if he also sold mods so you have random three star legendary weapons and armor while also being able to purchase mods to create your own.
---
So you pointed the camera to the queen's intact body but it didn't register with the camera no matter what angle you tried? That is very strange indeed.
---
Why would it not be worth your time? You get three times more currency for those items than a one star.
---
Agreed. I'm rocking a 2-star level 35 raider chest piece because it's literally the best version of what I want that I've come across. Would love the 3rd star and level 45/50 for a chest piece with aid reduction... But so be it.
---
Theyre allowed to like the game. It's not brown nosing to thank Bethesda for a game they enjoy
---
Not to mention it was critical for a FO:NV speedrun.
---
&gt;1* wood armours
---
Is there any other kind?
---
I think I got it from scrapping teslas.
---
Get the sneak perk card and get rank 3 plus get escape artist.
---
Didn't "Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia" do this episode?
---
***WHO POOPED THE BED!***
---
It's not necessarily non-deterministic, the "hidden" part of the sort key is just something we don't know, like the memory address of the objects, that could change as objects are inserted and deleted.
---
Yes, this is stupid, but if there is one thing we know about Bethesda it is that they use very, very, strange coding techniques.
---
Dude please shut up
---
All of the four horsemen skins can be applied to all PA types and they override the PA's model.
---
For example, if you put Black Rider on a X-01 set, it'll look exactly the same as it does on a T-60 set.
---
Sometimes I hate being right... :(  
---

"Caps from your sale, minus a nominal fee of 10% to maintain a healthy in-game economy, will be added to your Cap balance. "
---
I was gonna say I noticed I didn't seem to be hitting a cap and keep seeing my camera pictures as loading screens, didn't know PC did that though!
---
No,
---
Melee has a much higher risk of disease, radiation, and even hunger/thirst tbh
---
I imagine people would just fill a separate vending stash and set the price of everything to 9999 so it never sells, using it as free storage. Which would make the game run worse.
---
So much for your assurances, heh :p
---
Found a bag full of legendary weapons and armor once. All 1* but some good stuff found my chameleon armor in it. üòÄ
---
That's fine, they aren't saying you can't still trade between players. I'm sure a lot of people still will be trading between players. It's more of a 'convenience fee' that is also taking caps out of the game to control the economy. I think it's a good idea.
---
The survival rewards have been pretty mundane in the grand scheme of min/max builds.
---
Her. Bethesda is calling the mole miner a "her" so that's a thing.
---
Bethesda for the love of all that is good hire an economist. You have no freaking clue what you are doing. Taxing sales will only drive prices up. You already have an idiotic cap ceiling. Open an ECON 101 text for God‚Äôs sake. You are making things worse not better.
---
/u/Valseek
---
Yeah, but when I tried to do that the ISS just killed me, leaving all the pylons free again.
---
Rinse, repeat.
---
I wonder if that's how or why she seems to have retained some vestiges of humanity instead of going full mumbling shotgunner like the rest.
---
I already have a nice farmhouse near Watoga, with a rooftop club and a workshop downstairs. The vending machines will fit perfectly between the pool table and jukebox
---
I'm purposely exaggerating your stance for humorous effect, you twit.
---
Yep. Zoomed in, zoomed out, raised and lowered the camera multiple times, 4 people. Not the first time I've seen it. I've spent 10+ minutes trying to get Freddy fears to register in the camera too. It finally worked in pretty much the same spot and angle I started with ü§∑
---
Maybe?   I agree with the risk of melee, but a double barrel round to the chest should hurt more than a bloodied machete.  Or at least on par with the other legendary perks.
---
I will totally take you up on this on the PS4!  I just ordered the game, should have it soon, and I want to live in power armor, helping people out and leaving weird displays everywhere.  I'm glad to see they expanded the options from 4.
---
That's 4 hours every single day avg. No days off, but I actually did the math wrong. You'd be looking at more like 6 hours avg every single day over that time period. No days off. 
---
If you played 700 hours over 4 months , it is almost identical to the number of hours you'd work full time over that period at the avg full time week of 37.5 ish after unpaid breaks.
---
Do you have escape artist, covert operative and stealth perks?
---
Also I highly recommend Gun Fu....you can tear through mobs with headshots before they even know you are there...
---
The only way dedicated players ie higher lvl players are rewarded is if lvls add base hp and stamina points as well as a small % of defenses, or give us more perk card points instead of 15 being max and 50 points total.
---
Oh, I didn‚Äôt catch that.
---
Where did you see that?
---
How much you want for it?
---
LOL-  your 2nd post got deleted as well  
---
No one cares what cheaters think
---
Step 1: Promise a feature
---
Step 2: Implement it in a way that violates said promise
---
Step 3: "Balance" things by making them a chore to do
---
Step 4: Delay a promised feature for months to still deliver it broken later
---
Sometimes I wonder if they want the game to fail.
---
I agree, but instead of nerfing, buffing up the existing legendary modifiers would be a better way than trashing other build ideas.  In the end we will all end up bloodied melee till the next wave of nerfs.  Thats not good balancing.  Or buff the enemies a bit more.
---
As a Fallout fan, I laughed. Also, you forget to mention a group of fallout fans dedicated to the original games that hate Bethesda simply for the direction they took Fallout when they got the IP. So anytime Bethesda fucks up, they get loud and rejoice and try to fan the flames.  
---
(and I'm not saying I don't have beefs with 76 but it's mostly for the lie about only having cosmetic microtransactions. And because I worry about Bethesda turning 76 to something like GTA online, something that could be so good but has some obvious problems that were built in on purpose to sell microtransactions).
---
Not everyone in the Wasteland is a dick. üëç
---
I was hoping we might get to buy legendary effects we can put on our weapons, looks like we will get what u said a lot of stuff we probably dont need.
---
In my experience it can not take any damage while cloaked. I could be wrong. I believe it can once two or more pylons are taken. But not if none are. 
---
They also need to greatly increase the timer on this event.
---
Yes. I've played FO3, FO4, FONV and FO76. I always collect every teddy bear I come across. Except in 76 now I collect one of each stuffed animal...I have been waiting weeks to put them on display. 
---
Didn't they say something about linking the decorations to CAMP budget?
---
If you weren‚Äôt such a dumbass you‚Äôd realize I‚Äôm not the OP
---
The problem with trading is if your looking for pvp or pve legendary most times it is a duped item and the person is already rich on caps and wants some other legendary item or rare outfit which you probably won't have for it.
---
Yep I got the challenge done the way I said.
---
There is a world of difference with how the devs approached the situation though. Before Fallout 76 came out they flat out told us there will probably be a bunch of bugs. Anthem spray painted a turd gold and hoped no one would smell it. 
---
Content wise FO76 had soooo much more then Anthem did at release. Gameplay of Anthem was smoother at release but once you got into it there was/is hardly any content in the game. There are a handful of guns and abilities with randomly rolled stats and effects that alot of time dont actually do what they say. There is one linear storyline and a handful of boring ass repetitive side missions. Even their cosmetics are lacking. Theyve released recolored and resized decals as completely new items in their shop. After hours and hours of grinding for legendary gear players found out that their level scaling made it so that the level 1 starter gun you get is stronger than any legendary gun you can get. Im no game designer but that sounds that some serious incompetence to let something like that happen and go on for months after release.
---
You get the tickets by putting in your legendary weapons you don't want and you'll get like a "it's worth this much" ticket.  These machines will be at train stations and you take them to the legendary vendor to buy better weapons. Meh I guess... I'm kinda disappointed
---
I'm wondering this too, my plas gat is unusable atm. Hopefully they fix the invisible projectiles too.
---
I don‚Äôt accept random trades because I‚Äôve had people attack me after doing so. My guess is they wanted to size me up first, so I‚Äôm leary of people doing this. I also had someone keep following me around trying to trade with me...it was so annoying. And last week I had someone show up at my base (very remote area) asking for fusion cores and ammo, so I decided to go ahead and noticed they had no weapons on them. I grabbed some fusion cores out of my stash and dropped them and he didn‚Äôt pick them up...instead he wet to my stash and came back holding a weapon. I grabbed the fusion cores and left the world. I wasn‚Äôt going to stick around to see what he was going to do at that point. I also blocked the person.
---
If there are shotgun/ammo changes, reducing the amount of plastic needed to craft shells...
---
&gt;Did free range and had a level 55 just linger behind the cows the whole time. Only came in at the end, took one hit on the sheepsquatch,
---
The only way that you could know this is if you weren't protecting them yourself because you were to busy watching what others were doing.
---
Miners stuck in their suits. That's not unknown.
---
I don't think there's any connection between the key and the servers it uses, Amazon's network is set up to chose the "nearest" server.
---
Agreed, I really need one of these.
---
Is there a date for these things? I cant open the link.
---
I wish there was a way to lock in items that you want to keep so that you can't accidentally drop them or sell them.
---
I agree with you but because of slap damage and map markers the excitement and stranger danger is non-existent. A big part of the PvP survival experience is heart pumping random encounters with other people you meet in your adventures.
---
Very helpful and useful seeing as I'm struggling with my stash
---
Probably. Adding a specific race of creature instead of robots, a gender as opposed to monotone synthetic voice, and an independent affiliation instead of generic faction servant is a clear strive closer towards the NPCs people wanted at launch. At the very least, I expect she will have the regular mole miner grunts with a different voice. Expecting dialogue might be a bit much, but you never know
---
Awesome find! üëç
---
Glad it worked for someone.
---
Agreed...even something like only adding 50lbs. I'm overencumbered, and out of stash space.
---
Exactly! The player community was a welcome change from the varmint rifle weilding assholes in RDO too.
---
It's going to be like Baro in warframe. Guaranteed
---
If they are high damage but hard to aim, I can see them. Being useful.  Hard to hit because of projectile speed.  Sometimes you cant even see the projectiles too.
---
That was yesterday's challenge, do we have it again ? If you looking for an alpha, hopewell cave is the best bet, I hit it quickly, less than 5 servers hops for each of my characters.
---
Those would be good as fixed hubs, but would like the option to place our own as well.
---
Yes, that is what you get for a totally ignorant comment.
---
You state they should all be permabanned when some of them might be innocent (that makes you a moron)
---
I was thinking the exact same thing, there is nothing in the article about damage to your camp..
---
Lol.. My god ... Hire an economist? They'd tell Bethesda to make a cap limit and have plenty of cap sinks to avoid hyper inflation. Which is what they're doing.
---
Any possibility in getting the Encrypted timer extended a bit. Less and less people are doing the event, and some outright refuse to take the pylons ever. 
---
With the swarms of bots and so many deaths, there is really sometimes just not enough time to complete the event. 
---
Other events give you a full 25 minutes with no where near the amount of enemies or work. And the. Theres a 3 hour cool down and 2k cap cost to try again. 
---
Can we please get a little extra time here? It would allow more people to come in and give players a shot at beating it.
---
I'm on the reduce damage output and reduce bullet spongy-ness of PVE opponents.
---
The only downside is that Melee is so good at farming Whitesprings with relatively low repair costs and no ammo costs.
---
I would miss that
---
&gt; Buying/trading for items procured by illicit means irl carries consequences regardless of whether you know it was procured that way or not
---
Yeah, that's 100% false there chief.
---
I've been living in the Mire on my main character ever since I first found the area! I'm currently down by the crashed plane site with a lovely camp over looking a waterfall next to a lead extractor. Since it's on a cliff it's quite peaceful and I seem to never get enemy spawns, even have a random encounter location right down the way.
---
You haven't made a point that anyone couldn't understand. You instead proposed some fallacious concept wherein someone is being forced to purchase some piece of junk as opposed to waiting for an item that will actually benefit them and even took it a step further by attempting to pit that against an alternative game mechanic that is ALREADY broken and the root of the issue. You think an RNG re-roll would be better when its the EXACTY same RNG that has led to the legendary equipment issues this vendor is an attempt to mitigate? Whats the definition of insanity again?
---
There is a common denominator in this entire exchange, and its you.
---
I play Xbox and PC fairly regularly on Fo76.
---
On my Xbox, The VATS bug is just as bad as before. I have to pump 4 shotgun shells into a level 21 ghoul's head to kill it. This was one shot before. IDK wtf happened here lately, but its been real bad for me. As for crashes, no issues on xbox.
---
On my PC, the VATS bug has been kinda random and not as bad as the old days. BUT the crashes have been ferocious. One about every 20 minutes, last Monday night, I stopped playing after the 5th crash. Over the weekend too.
---
If you weren't such a dumbass you'd realize that I never said you were the OP.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ well played sir/ma'am.
---
Well when I died there was probably 1 pylon active. But they were damaging it because it died invisible and since I took the 2 pylons and most randoms didn't want to take the pylons don't think anyone took my place. Yeah the event timer needs to be 20 mins and they should have done a tutorial mission for it were you could solo it the first time so people that did the storyline would know you need to activate the pylons. Imagine if this was like destiny raid and you were trying to beat it and no one else knew the mechanics to beat the boss and you died cause everyone else was dumb or ignorant.
---
There‚Äôs got to be a way. Maybe once you drop it in vending you could only ever change the price or destroy it? That way you couldn‚Äôt use it for free storage. Something.
---
I gained like 2 levels there because I found a level 71 deathclaw. Took a potshot and then hauled ass to the gaggle of Assaultrons guarding the entrance, which also had a small building next door. Hid in there taking pot shots while the Assaultrons did all the heavy lifting, lol.
---
With ammosmith 2 that's 36 rounds, with super duper potentially boosting that to 72. That's a hell of an improvement over the 18 you could possibly create now.
---
Thanks for the tip. 
---
&gt;Weapon Nerf: The Explosive legendary mod‚Äôs damage bonus has been reduced from +100% to +20% of **base weapon damage**, with explosive radius damage.
---
So it's 20% damage boost without any modifications. It's working the same was as TS in this case.
---
A handmade has 45 base damage. 20% of that is 9 points of damage. Since the weapon is a TS we can add up another 9 for a grand total of 18 point of explosive damage.
---
25% of 45 is 11 points of damage. so we can add that too.
---
An unmodded TSE handmade deals 45+11+18=74 damage before any armor reduction.
---
Adding a hardened receiver changes the base damage to ~56. Adding the TSE bonus goes up to 85 damage/shot before any armor reduction.
---
The SBQ has 300 DR. 
---
With tank killer and perforating our handmade has 61.60 % armor penetration. This means we're going to deal about 37-38 damage on a SBQ/TSE shot.
---
Now if you do the math for a SBQ you'll notice that a Hunter's explosive handmade deals about 39 damage/shot. 
---
If you add up the +60% from demolition expert TSE deals 56+11+28=95 Hunter explosive goes up to ~96 effective damage.
---
The values are so close to each other that it's not even worth wasting so much time talking about this. TSE, AAE, HunterE are all within 2-3 points of effective damage. 
---
In the end bloodied explosive is the best of all. No reason to argue and no reason to be snarky. The guy i replied to did stumble upon a treasure that's comparable with TSE stuff.
---
But here‚Äôs the thing. It‚Äôs kind of like loot boxes. Its not really earned because of the RNG aspect of it. It‚Äôs more ‚Äúhope you get really lucky‚Äù. People can grind and grind for hours, and rarely ever do you feel rewarded. I get that the legendary vendor won‚Äôt make you over powered, giving you anything you desire, and it should be that way. But the big thing is, you never feel rewarded by getting lucky. You feel rewarded when you take down a three star, or a scorchbeast queen, and you get good stuff. That‚Äôs rewarding. Nobody wants one star wood armor, so we shouldn‚Äôt get that from a three star.
---
In my expectations.
---
Well that says more about explosive than it does lasers tbh.
---
West Tek all day every day.
---
I've been hoarding known plans for this exact reason. I think I've got close to 12 pounds of known plans (.25 a piece...thats about 48 known plans) for this reason. Though I'm only selling duplicate duplicates....my wife and I plan on buying another tv/xbox and playing together, gotta save plans to share.
---
Its almost 6months and no news on the nylon canvas bag, I'm wondering if we are event getting them now.
---
It's the same thing for displaying stuff. Got 5 power armor skins you want to show off? That's 50 weight coming out of your stash.
---
Didn't know the idea has been pitched already, a bit new to posting here. Do hope they work out the Technical issues that will allow players to build closer together one day. Would love to have a next door neighbor. ;)
---
Shotguns were never meant to have that kind of power, it was clearly stated it's a bug, so what is the issue. They need to fix the bugs.
---
Top quality shitpost.
---
Buy a serum recipe. That will knock out a huge chunk of your cash. Then craft said serum and sell it in the vending machine to get your money back.
---
It will be the same patch (ever upwards) so I believe so. I just remember the prvious inside the vault went into details about that, and it was slated to release with patch 9 (May 7)
---
Yea but that gatling plasma kicks like a mule. I can be at a safe range with that laser gatling.
---
Can you put so a scriper in harpers ferry? There is no train station anywhere and no stash box as well
---
Yeah it could be that Bethesdas server is trying to connect directly to client, but fails because there is router in between doing NAT.
---
Do you have any idea about what ports? Like I said Im not using wlan, but because the mobile router has wlan, it would not know to direct all traffic to the computer.
---
The settings I can see from the mobile router are quite less than that of ordinary router. I can't even see my computer from there as it's directly connected to the device, not through wlan like the phone.
---
I am fully anticipating being completely underwhelmed by the system and having to scrap junk legendary items for some weekly named legendary the vendor sells that is a mid to low tier item. I was hoping you could buy the equivalent of a legendary mod to attach to a previous item. It looks like that is not happening.
---
Sorry that you are salty about this discussion.
---
May I suggest you take a walk? Sounds like you need a bit of fresh air, friend.
---
My points have been made. If you didn't get it, you didn't get it. No reason to be mad about that.
---
I can already imagine the line at the store
---
Absolutely not, unless they gut or fix the explosive lazers this is the most idea. They're already the power houses of pvp
---
If they want a cap sink they should make it possible to buy legendary scrip with caps.
---
Try clearing you cache .. hold xb button down, pull out power for 30-60 seconds.
---
Definitely been getting more square pink colour crap all over, but nothing like this that prevents me from playing ..
---
TSE Laser rifles and pistol are deadly as hell. Have you seen the priced on them?
---
Sure, the rarity of the items boost the price but they wouldn't be that high if they didn't work.
---
Grab concentrated fire for x2 weak point targeting, covert operative for x2.5 sneak attacks, and mister sandman for x3.5 nighttime sneak attacks.
---
Also consider stacking critical hit bonuses like eagle eyes, better criticals, and blight soup.
---
How would you make a proper "survival" mode? Genuinely curious, though I have a few ideas of my own.
---
Do what Businesses do, increase your price by 10% and pass it on
---
\*no opinions were presented in the previous comment\*
---
Really, do you even play this fucking game. I was constantly on the cows, herding them, and protecting them and its abundantly clear when you see the gamer tag lingering behind the herd the entire time. But I guess every sub needs a mouthy jerk to start arguments.
---
Yea, this whole one stash space for everything you can do is really broken.
---
Itll be like the vending machines in borderlands 2. Always crap.. even the item of the day is crap.. untill that one fateful day yer buddy checks it and omg most epic thing ever wooooo!
---
Or like in destiny.. you wont have enough seashells to buy the hot freshness that fisnt get nerfed today...
---
It's a bit of a joke that they only doubled the laser rifle durability, it's still leagues behind all the other energy weapons (and in relation is further behind than before the buff). They better at least buff the laser rifle durability with that next update
---
Improvement? Sure. But still not anywhere close to being competitive with other weapons :V. 50 is what, one enemy?
---
That sadly is absolutely not surprising. Notice in GTA for the last few years Rockstar really doesn't want you playing in the private servers. Almost anything that makes decent money has to be done in a public server (even though there is no real reason) and many times is designed to make it easy for griefers to fuck with you (and you don't even get much money for destroying a shipment, R\* knows griefers just like to piss people off so don't even bother trying to get regular players to fight each other). I think they regretted ever allowing private servers (but couldn't take them away once htey were there). RDR2 online is new and they haven't set the precedent yet for private servers so decided to not even start having them.  
---
(one of the things I'll blame microtransactions in GTA for... R\* wanted to sell them so they don't really want you to be able to  make much moeny without frustration. Griefers add a lot of frustration so they encourage them. I mean everything about the game design encourages them. To forcing you to do the money making stuff in public servers to making it so dieing does really nothing to you and spawns you right next to the person, to actively telling people to go fuck with some one's shipment, to passive modes that are absolutely pointless... go passive and all you can do in the game is drive and buy clothes.. can't even defend yourself against NPCs).
---
I do agree they should find elsewhere to dump caps but the scrips would be too op to just buy. What is the sheep for? 1800 caps every time lol.
---
I'm actually kinda stoked. I've got a legendary plasma flamer that I always found useful in tight spots with aggressive sudden ghoul hordes (i.e. Nuked Clubhouse) so I'm really happy to see it get 30% better overnight. I just hope that the new DMG boost doesn't adversely affect the deterioration rate cuz the thing's already pretty flimsy as is.
---
Planning the Appalachia tea party as we speak

https://youtu.be/v0XKqiNLlLk
---
Your gaslighting needs some work, friend.
---
Honestly if they could keep tracking of people's inventory of what item was sold, dropped, traded, stashed, used, etc. Then if something was gone from a bug, they could technically have an employee add the affected player give him a time and date to login and console command the item lost and give it to them, maybe it would be too hard for ammo and consumables, but legendaries and rare outfits not so much. But, I guess thats too much work for them when they probably still haven't got rid of the dupe items and hidden methods.
---
Why not both? Melee for farming and whip out that explosive shotty when you need real damage. All the damage perks for both weapons are in strength it's a very easy flip
---
Today's inside the vault stated that "legendary exchange machines" were coming in the patch next week. We'll be able to start unloading legendary crap and accumulating "legendary scrip" for 2 weeks prior to the vendor appearing.
---
Dude, if I knew, I'd tell you. I can show you chat screenshots if you really want.
---
I assume people trade 25k caps they stored on alts and trust you won't run away with the caps.
---
I went to Highland Marsh in the north mire there's always a king and queen and lots of eggs.
---
Anything else you want to add?
---
Doesn't seem like a good fix for an already inflated in-game economy though.
---
&gt;Not just that, how's Red Dead Online doing?
---
Nowhere close to being an apt comparison.  RDR online was released alongside the single player game, which is game of the year material.  It wasn't released as a stand alone title.  The online component is basically an optional component of the single player game.
---
Had Bethesda released a single player game with a separate and optional online mode, people would have been much happier and there would not have been such a huge backlash.
---
Nah keep digging, chief.
---
But ya gotta be 40 when you go back to complete the quest to get the L40 weapon....
---
I finished it at about 17, so mine was L15.
---
  It wasn't until after that one I learned to go ahead and initiate quest whenever and complete the tasks in the course of normal exploring, but don't go back for the reward until you are a much higher level.
---
I'm being told it was a Legacy Item now. It was a 3* TSE.
---
It literally flashes across the screen, multiple times, to take the pylons. People just dont want to. They want to be in the action killing things and dont care if the event fails. 
---
It should in no way be as difficult as it is if people actually followed the instructions.

---
No. Draw a supply demand curve with a ceiling below the equilibrium point and tell me what that does.
---
Plasma Weapon buff so more people use them and thus more enemies turn into bugged unlootable goo piles. :)
---
Great idea! Wish I had thought of that.
---
I think this feature was mostly a "player request" sort of situation...so I doubt they had any prior planning about it. Much like others said, I'd rather it be delayed then broken upon release...that way people like you can't whine about how "bugthesda bad"
---
the chemicals in the water turned the friggen frogs gay!!!
---
Well you came to the right place! ;-) I've got 1000s of hours in many of the top open world survival PVP games on the market so I'm fairly familiar with what works and what doesn't.
---
‚Ä¢ Absolutely no markers whatsoever for players on the map. Putting a bounty on a players head could be an option but it should be done at a vendor and cost a lot. The problem with the current scoreboard system / map marking system is that it is a distraction from the core game play. The reason PvP is so tense in survival games is because the encounters are random and unpredictable. While I'm not opposed to a stats board, marking players on the map for doing well has just put me off playing survival entirely. The markers are an artificial construct and a distraction from the core gameplay. There‚Äôs nothing to fear in terms of players finding each other organically. I never use the map markers to find players and I bump into them all the time because players go to farm the same locations and events. 
---
‚Ä¢ Survival mode should require a new character and they should be bound to this mode. Allowing free migration between modes completely defeats the purpose of its existence other than to strengthen the idea that it serves as nothing more than a quick fire death match mode. I'm all for character story and quest progress getting saved across characters but but when you start in survival you are a level 1 character with nothing, otherwise what's the point? 
---
‚Ä¢ Remove the marking system for when a player has their weapon away or not. Let the players organically decide who's friend and who's foe. It also makes it impossible to 
---
  hide in foilage or in cover nearby.
---
‚Ä¢ Buff environmental hazards to make them more dangerous. (rads for example should be lethal) 
---
‚Ä¢ Make the weather more extreme with more brutal rain storms and frequent rad storms. 
---
‚Ä¢ Lock character builds to make them permanent. No more jack of all trades, if you want players to engage in more team work then give them a reason to. If you have players who have focused builds that can't be changed then you will see actual builds form resulting in more interaction and trade. Re-rolling could be an option but it should be extremely costly to do it and only available end-game, not something anyone can do constantly or it just defeats the purpose. 
---
‚Ä¢ Revisit the damage and health system to make them feel like they have an impact on game play. Head shots should be lethal and a broken leg should take a long time to heal without the proper treatment. injuries should have real consequences both visually and practically. Right now they add nothing more than tedious searching through a long list to find the meds in order to get rid of notifications on screen. 
---
‚Ä¢ Revise the hunger / thirst system to make it actually important and not just another tedious thing in the background. If the bars go empty your character should die. As they get low you should 'feel' the impact through character movement and visuals. 
---
‚Ä¢ Strip back the HUD, keep it as minimal as possible with as little distraction as possible. No crosshair or first person player markers. The only way to get any sort of UI handicaps is through attachments for weapons and armour pieces. Quests should have minimal info and require the player to explore properly without their hand being held. 
---
‚Ä¢ Buff enemies to be more lethal. Non-boss enemies should be less bullet sponge but deal more damage. 
---
‚Ä¢ Reduce the accuracy and increase the recoil of all weapons to make combat last longer, especially in PVP. Also reduce NPC accuracy to balance their increase in difficulty and increased weapon damage output. 
---
‚Ä¢ Negate server hopping significantly by only allowing it to occur once every hour. If you leave a server and boot back up the game in less than an hour then it should put you back on the same server. The game is pretty much built around server hopping right now as that's what pretty much everybody is doing to farm end-game. The result is access to endless resources and a broken economy. Something needs to be done to make it unappealing or stop it entirely and at the same time, make players want to stay where they are. If server hopping gets fixed this would have a huge impact on game play and like locking character builds, it would encourage a lot more team play and trade as a proper loot economy would form where things are in demand. Server hopping the vast majority are doing constantly to farm and that just seems bizarre to me that we spend so much time going to the main menu to jump servers every couple of minutes. 
---
‚Ä¢ The loot economy should be revised to make some things a lot more scarce. Currently if you know the map you can so easily get everything you need. Meds in particular are far too easy to come by. If server hopping is negated and loot is scarce then proper trade will form as there will be supply and demand. 
---
‚Ä¢ Player versus player combat needs a lot of attention. The gap between god tier and new player weapons and armour needs closing significantly. Now I'm not opposed to legendary items but in survival mode the effects need to be nerfed significantly so that they only provide a very small advantage. Either that or the legendary effects should only effect PVP targets. When in PVP, the legendary effects should do nothing. If PVP is to be fair in the long rung then a new player with a pipe pistol should at least have a chance against a player in full assassins combat armour. In a PvP encounter the main factor that should determine the winner should be wit and skill otherwise there will be no long term life for survival servers if new players don't have a chance. 
---
‚Ä¢ Feeding from my last point, power armour should be the god tier outfit that is damn hard to take down by anybody. In order to balance, PA should be a much rarer sight. Fusion cores should be extremely rare, drain faster and PA should cost a heck of a lot to maintain. Manoeuvrability could be nerfed significantly to give other players a fighting chance or at least the ability to escape. This would mean folks wouldn't be roaming in it all the time. It would be saved for proper use during events like nuke zones. 
---
‚Ä¢ Slow player movement down and reduce jump height. Also increase the AP cost of jumping so the game feels less arcadey and our characters feel more naturally weighted. 
---
All the ingredients are in the game already for this to work. Many of the systems are already in place and just need modifying. Fallout true survival could be absolutely amazing. Everything you do in the game would matter and have real consequences. With this particular rulset, you could afford to go a little further with what the player drops on death as well. Maybe as well as a few aid items and junk they might also drop a random unequipped weapon or armour piece just to make it that little bit more intense.
---
You need 3 different animals in your viewfinder, I had 1 queen, 2 hatchlings, 2 kings. It didn't work when I had 1 ween and 2 kings .. 1 had 1 radroach, 1 king, 1 queen, had to go back to my footage to confirm.
---
I PM'ed my videos, so you can pause on the viewfinder when I snap the pics. 1 Main video and 1 video link in comments for 2nd vid
---
Epic...made my day, enjoy your Gold sir.
---
Yeah I think the bug has to do with moving items quickly in menus, like when I am fast selling items or fast transferring items from my stash ie note plans it sometimes grabs weapons or armor/outfit pieces from stash into my inventory. I think the bug with Mama Dolce's feed the people event when I was affected, might still be bugged were I tried to fast transfer the food into the dropper and it took my equipped weapon into the dropper too. Thing is whenever I tried to fast sell items it would say this item can't be sold, but it never sold any item I didn't want taken though. I never fast drop items, so I guess I haven't had issue of losing item yet.
---
I'll be honest, I have done this, once, mostly accidentally.
---
I feel really bad about it.
---
Sorry OP
---
I've not seen a TSE laser rifle, but I have a two shot laser rifle and it just doesn't do a lot of damage compared to weapons like the handmade. Creatures also have high energy resistance as it is. Yeah, the laser makes up for some of the damage with fast fire rate, but it's still pretty fragile and underwhelming compared to almost any other gun.
---
I don't quite think comparing basic weapons  to their TSE counterparts are a fair comparison at all. TSE can turn any fast firing gun into a monstrosity, but the amount of people who have a TSE laser weapon are probably in an the extreme minority.
---
It's less of a cap sink and more of an inflation control. Without the 10% deductible, the cap availability in the market would grow non-stop and end up inflating the prices, hurting new players and making it an elite club only.
---
I think that's mostly because people forgot that the removal of explosive energy weapons is only temporary. All of them are incredibly overpriced at the moment because they don't drop. Afaik explosive teslas, gatling lasers/plasmas are still much much more expensive
---
Today's Inside the Vault has details on player vending. 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bjw0q1/fallout_76_fallout_76_inside_the_vault_patch_9/
---
Relevant chunk in case you don't want to read the whole thing:
---
&gt;Of course, to run a successful business, you‚Äôll need to advertise! When you build and power a Vending Machine, your C.A.M.P. location will appear to all players on the map as long as you aren‚Äôt currently Wanted. When others hover over your C.A.M.P. on the map, they‚Äôll see your name and player icon, as well as the number and types of items you have marked for sale. If you‚Äôve got lots of goods or rare items, and set fair prices, your shop will likely have a few new visitors.
---
I don‚Äôt understand how this would effect the economy
---
I have a vampire's gatling laser. It takes a while to kill the bigger enemies but I am functionally invincible
---
After you buy all the recipes then what? I hate the flux grind so making serums is just more work than reward. I can get like 40 caps for a bulk of steel which is abundant and I dont have to farm nuke zones and carry heavy ingredients and craft. 10 bulks of steel takes like an hour or two of game play while I'm doing other things and can be just as profitable.
---
It‚Äôs easy to tell no one is doing anything because no bullets are coming out of their guns and they aren‚Äôt moving. It‚Äôs not rocket science there you go there‚Äôs you explanation, the answer isn‚Äôt complex, it‚Äôs not hard to tell when someone is afk it doesn‚Äôt require a detective
---
Does anyone actually spend that for a crappy one star and white wolf fedora?
---
Just fyi, super duper only counts the original value. So a proc will get you 56 fuel from a single craft. I still agree though, 4x improvement is much much better even if it's still a bit short
---
Taking caps out of the game to deflate the value
---
I‚Äôve been doing exactly the same thing. I feel that vexing our plans would be amazing. I have like 5 sets of the small letters and I want to spread that around, but I would love to get some caps for it as I‚Äôm notoriously low on caps and am too lazy atm.
---
Bye, have a great time!
---
You mean like a queen, a king, and a spawn? Yeah, that's what we had, as stated previously. The queen. Would. Not. Register. In the camera.
---
This bug makes me think of a moment were I was at whitespring and I killed a legendary no star ghoul and checked its inventory it had no legendary weapon but it had 5.56 ammo. Then later I saw next to the ghoul was a handmade rifle on the ground that ended up legendary. So, the item was dropped from the ghoul and spawned on the ground; making me think this bug could be related to lag on the servers? Cause most servers I login it takes few minutes for everything to load like events, fast traveling to your camp instantly on login, moving, etc.
---
I'm pretty sure they did before the build budget update, but I thought it changed after it.
---
A quick question ask gets the same results and I get to converse with the fine people of this sub. Present company excluded.

I say we boycott caps and replace the in game currency with perfectly preserved pie ü•ß.

Grab Ballistic Bock too, you can offset the loss of condition by having the maxed ranked weapon artisan in use when you repair your gun, and also having rank 5 gunsmith up.

---
Thanks to /u Skye_Wolfe for his help tweaking it.
---
I run both The Fixer and a lv 40 Instigating Sniper Rifle with 50% extra limb damage, as well as a full set of Chameleon gear that I scraped together I haven't found better for the sniper rifle but I'm able to kill most normal and legendary mobs with it. Staying put and not moving is the key sometimes.
---
for the first few days... forsure.
---
Is it really? My flamer shows something like 60 dmg per "tick" in the pip boy. Feels like if you have a decent effect and conserve ammo, 50 could last you a few higher level enemies at least
---
&gt; Will we be getting that C.A.M.P. passive mode protection with the vending machines? 
---
From my understanding of previous notes/comments the answer is YES, unless you are wanted...in which case you lose the passive protection.
---
&gt; 25k cap limit? 
---
Genuiene question, but how have you earned that much? I've put in several hours into my main character, and I think I'm yet to hit 10k total (I'm counting everything I've purchased...I currently only have about 2.5k on my character). Though I will also admit I've still got a lot of exploring, questing and looting to do (hit level 50 during the double XP weekend, still havent done nuke zones or anything yet though)
---
Bugs should be fixed, yea.  But I would just like more information around the bug that states the damage im seeing in the PIP boy for my shotgun is lower than what its reporting.  if in the end the bug reduces the explosive effect to 20% and ups the base damage so its a wash, then cool.  But if its also known bug that the PIP boy is reporting the base damage incorrectly, how far off is it?
---
Same, I'm glad it will be fixed on Tuesday.
---
It doesn't fit on the pillar either, ended up placing it on a welcome mat, and putting the mat+bowl on the pillar...
---
I've been noticing that a lot, too. Not with legendaries, but that I kill an enemy and it drops its gun on the ground. 99% of the time it's on the body, but sometimes it just seems to appear next to it. Could be easy to miss, or get blown away by explosive damage.
---
I always join in when I see it or buy one when I hit 25k. I have been having decent luck with the sheep. Got an Executioners explosive lever with vats fill from it the other day.
---
I dont understand the in game "economy" at all. 
---
I get that between players, rarer armor and weapons are more expensive and that gets sort of de determined by the community. 
---
But where is there any benefit from cap limits per player, or taxes on items sold. How does that effect anything else in game at all.
---
I raise you one

---
I don't whine about "bugthesda bad" I never have. My complaint is that this has been supposed to come out with player vending, which was to be released April 9th with sheepsquatch. Vending was pushed back until this next week, was a month really not enough time to figure out display cases?
---
Good point.  Just need to invest a bit in the melee perk cards and shuffle the deck.  Thanks!
---
Good point. Maybe that means it's going to be as exploitative as the original company stores. With the 10% 'commission' on player vendors and the already huge buy/sell spread at the vendor bots, I feel like we're already there.
---
I mean, I‚Äôm nuking my own camp from orbit after *that*...
---
I have two 'shotgunner' toons.
---
One is stealth, one is 'in your face'.
---
Is the ones I have the most fun with therefore is the ones that see most 'activity'.
---
Somenow I knew that this was too much fun for the fun police and it wouldn't go unnoticed. Not kidding, I told my friends on discord numerous times 'I am having too much fun with these toons, it worries me'.
---
It would seem that once again the fun per hour limit has been exceeded and it has to be reined in.
---
Tinfoil time, this is because of PvP isn't it? because none of these things matter on PvE.
---
If they limit the number of rerolls per day I'm just gonna quit to be honest.
---
First - dupers are not really taken to task, and allowed to keep at least 1 of each duped item they had, so there are people with hundreds of GG items spread out over their account.
---
Second - dupes were never taken out of economy, nor were the millions of duped caps.
---
Meanwhile, legit players like me with multiple level 80s and a level 360 that have been grinding 600+ hours at the game can only manage to get a few OK 1 star weapons - every time I get a 3 star, it's garbage. Everything that Bethesda has shown me so far is that "it's OK to cheat, as long as you don't cheat TOO MUCH", so cheaters have been rewarded.
---
If they handicap the one way that a legit player can get good items, I'm fuckin done. I'm sick and tired of cheaters being rewarded. There's absolutely no reason for this vendor to have a cap on the number of items you can turn in or the number of rerolls you can do per day.
---
I think what they changed is you get the budget back if you scrap something with a wire attached to it. I believe before the fix, the budget cost of the wire was stuck in your budget.
---
Everyone uses the plain old one, it seems.
---
i've yet to see anyone stealth through that fully. you got any videos?
---
That's weird
---
I have lost slot of ammo each time I get on. Really shitty for my automatic build. I spend a bunch of cap on ammo and Bethesda just takes it away from me.
---
WTF
---
Because ass/sent is just as good as underwear. Might as well get the +2s.
---
This is a great tip, I have been hoarding Ultra-lite armor but not many weapons except the lightest melees!
---
How do you folks think it will work at the vendor once we have some Scrip to spend? I'm sure we all want very specific weapons and armors (I know I do for Pistols) so I'm wondering if it will even be better than crossing our fingers and hoping for good drops. I'm a little worried the Vendor might only have "common" Legendary items and so finding that *one* thing we want will still be a hassle.
---
Good things! Question about the display cases though - is that the only decorating we‚Äôre getting? I was hoping for setting out items like FO4 (I need my Fuzzies and Bears!) ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
well patch highlights are out and the legendary vendor is explained. [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3ExPLDXM5fgLJm9WiWLGrK/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-patch-9-preview?utm\_source=Community&amp;utm\_medium=Social](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3ExPLDXM5fgLJm9WiWLGrK/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-patch-9-preview?utm_source=Community&amp;utm_medium=Social)
---
Yeah, this needs fixed. I've made my build around being able to land sneak attacks and it almost never happens in events. Imagine the outcry if bloodied didn't work in events.
---
Ah, that probably why its so expensive, I think tse don't spawn for specific laser weapons, flamers and cryolator. That really sucks man.
---
I really do think they should nerf player damage in general or come up with some really hardcore pve mode. Nuclear winter was it? Pve is a pure joke.
---
Ehh, I figure they're just a little touch to tell others a bit about who you are/how you play. Just one more thing to add some "flavour" to the game.
---
In a franchise where I have prostituted myself out to buy ammo, this would fit in perfectly.
---
Did they die after he showed up?
---
How? I go to danger after my first shot and everything aggros on me. I have 22 agi and full chameleon armor.  Finally gave up trying and just jump in PA and switch perks to heavy weapons for that fight.
---
My last few have been pitiful. Drill/Syringer/Nocturnal Junk. I won‚Äôt sink 2k into an event where I literally could get crap.
---
True, but if you remove the event quest from your map/data when you join it, the info won't be tracking so its possible they don't even see the text. And the flashing on the screen they could just be ignoring it. I hate when people are farming the bots for that small change exp and end up blowing me up with the eyebots when I'm doing the pylons. Its kinda like overwatch were everyone wants to dps and no one wants to tank or heal so you lose. Selfish people in a selfless event lol.
---
Nope we killed him in less than seconds and all 3 were full hp. Hopefully I run into the event again later tonight.
---
Hah! 
---
You fools are just doing what the MAN wants...drinking water...pfft... 
---
I'll stick to my trusty inert flux, the thirst quenchiest. 
---

Ah bum it didn't keep my formatting.
---
Bloodied  pump action shotgun, bloodied crossbow and bloodied pipe rifle also been collecting unyielding armour ..
---
Not sure of the actual,stats as I‚Äô m not at home .. on PS4
---
According to the latest vault article, this might be it. I was personally hoping for a re-roll on one of the legendary effects of your own choice on the weapons you already have.
---
But in this case, it will only trigger A LOT of server hopping unless the vendor is fixed.
---
There's a guaranteed spawn for one atop West-Tek tho
---
Also with Bloodied and full Unyielding armor your luck shoots up astronomically, and so do your chances of getting one from the machines
---
They're not hard to farm for is what I'm saying lol
---
Random number generator. Keyword is 'random'. It selects a RANDOM value.
---
I've even gotten the exact same weapon twice in a row before. That's what RNG is.
---
No. You're pushing the 76 thing. 
---
Me and the other person were discussing RE and Fallout. The context of their impact on Post apocalyptic games and such is an easy tell that we are discussing the franchise impact, not individual titles.
---
And you need to learn how to read. I did in fact state that Mad Max is a major driving force behind the popularization of Post Apocalyptic themes and settings. It's influence is in a lot of works.
---
I however also pointed out that in gaming, Fallout used it as inspiration and popularized much of the aesthetic, themes etc in gaming. 
---
Because even prior to the fallout Franchise, I'm sure plenty of games had that post apocalyptic feel, but none have had the success/popularity of Fallout, nor nearly the same impact on gamer culture and game design as the Fallout franchise has.
---
Why are you even bothering to post? It's not like you're adding to the discussion. It's not as if you're saying "Well, this franchise actually had this impact" or "This source of inspiration had this effect"
---
You're just trying to argue semantics, with nothing of value, nothing interesting to add.
---
From your perspective I completely understand. There were a couple times I got 1* knives in a row and was ready to be done with ol sheepy
---
I havent had any issues with consent.
---
It is almost impossible for sure. (sad face)
---
I am ok with this 10%
---
Im sure they will adjust it if need be..
---
&gt; Before Fallout 76 came out they flat out told us there will probably be a bunch of bugs
---
You mean after multiple betas where this was obviously shown?
---
&gt; Content wise FO76 had soooo much more then Anthem did at release 
---
It has more locations to explore due to being an open world game and the main story questline is longer due to having to traverse the map on foot. Daily quests, workshops, and grinding gear are all present in Anthem.
---
&gt; There is one linear storyline and a handful of boring ass repetitive side missions. 
---
Subjective, you could say the same thing about FO76.
---
&gt; Even their cosmetics are lacking. Theyve released recolored and resized decals as completely new items in their shop.  
---
And FO76 had good cosmetics at launch? Its only been the past couple months where actually cool stuff has been put on the atom shop. Also the least of my worries.
---
&gt; After hours and hours of grinding for legendary gear players found out that their level scaling made it so that the level 1 starter gun you get is stronger than any legendary gun you can get. 
---
Yep, definitely, a design issue choice that was terrible but was fixed within that week. 
---
FO76 had just as many baffling design choices and I experienced worse technical problems. Sure it had more content in the sense of things to explore and places to grind loot, but that doesn't mean much when it's a chore to slog through the game. If you think FO76 was better at launch, good for you, but let's not pretend both games weren't the worst AAA launches this year.
---
I expect 2 vampires two shot explosive wood armor.
---
And I better goddamn get it.
---
Or else.
---
*shakes fist angrily*
---
So people will either mark up prices or just not use the machine, especially when it comes to rarer items.
---
So what if your selling an item for  1 cap.
---
Thanks I learn something new about this game all the time even at lvl 290 and didn‚Äôt power lvl. Found 3 new locations the other day was nice to get excited about the game for a sec.
---
Need a "Praise the Sun" emote to go with this paint
---
Earn it? People have spent hundreds of hours in this game and have gotten nothing but trash. If you didn't buy a duped weapon your chances of getting anything remotely good is small.
---
So wait. This comes out next week?
---
[minus a nominal fee of 10% to maintain a healthy in-game economy,](https://i.imgur.com/wNVvkwK.jpg)
---
I've done stuff like this to people that lock up their house. There are some tricks to get into someones house even w/ a locked door. I'm not there to damage anything, just really need to scrap junk or repair a weapon. whatever.
---
if I find my way in, i'll drop some spoiled stuff and a propaganda flyer.
---
From the picture, it looks like poop under the bed also.
---
Over 300 pounds for me! However the vendor turns out I'll at least be happy about this.
---
My guess is that the main purpose of this vendor is to remove a lot of crappy items nobody wants from player inventories and give them a slight chance to get something great.  To that end I am expecting you to be able to turn in legendary items to the vendor for some kind of point value and then "spin the wheel" for a random legendary item for 5 - 10 points.  Something that bascially takes out 5-10 items and replaces it with one but you don't know what you are going to get.  They love random drops (with the probabability of 1\* being like 90% 2\* being 9% and 3\* being 1%) and this would go right in line with it.  Kind of like how the grinder works in Borderlands the Pre Sequel.  It's a gamble
---
That way there is no reason to server hop constantly trying to check the legendary vendors inventory for anything good and everybody has a chance to get something better but nothing fantastic is guaranteed.
---
People would still complain. And I'll use RDR2 as an example. People are absolutely complaining about the MP element and how R\* keeps fucking it up. Except most people have already gotten bored and just moved on (not good for an MP game). The only benefit of having the SP game is that people are quicker to just move on (they at least had a fun SP game). But it certainly isn't saving the MP game.
---
I'm level 149 now. I've got over 400 hours in. And I've bought almost every plan possible. 
---
Honestly since beta I have constantly scrapped and sold every day. I also use the perk to get extra chems from chem boxes and I loot thru flatwoods and Morgantown daily. All those chems actually turn a pretty decent profit. I dont use anything but stimpacks, radaway, and disease cures so everything else gets sold. I also sell every one star legendary I pick up unless it has a super great prefix.
---
Also glowing blood can net a decent profit. So I collect that as well as golf outfits at whitesprings which weigh little and sell for 17 caps each. 
---
I've never sold to other players yet and at this point I cant lol. 
---
I've hit the cap limit 3x now, and just try to fast travel a lot to use some.of them up. But I'd love to be able to sell all the 2 and 3 star items I've collected thru vending.
---
Interesting? You just wanna see dem mole tiddiez doncha?
---
I think it‚Äôs just buggy sometimes. I had one a couple days ago where the event completed after escorting the Brahmin and the Sheepsquatch just never spawned at all. Everyone stood there for a couple of minutes totally confused.
---
This seems like a great patch!
---
So, this has me worried:
---
&gt;When she opens the doors to her shop, you‚Äôll be able to exchange a new type of currency, called Legendary Scrip, for legendary items. [...] [P]lace [your unwanted legendaries] in the machine, and then collect your Scrip. The higher the star-rating of your legendary items, the more Scrip you will receive. The more Legendary Scrip you have when the Purveyor arrives, the more legendary weapons and armor you will be able to buy!
---
So this sounds an awful lot like the Purveyor (WHO FOR SOME REASON ISN'T NAMED HANS MOLEMAN WHICH IS A FUCKING TRAGEDY) will be an awful lot like Destiny's Xur:
---
* Collect a special, separate currency;  
---
* Wait for the vendor to arrive;  
---
* Exchange currency for items from the vendor's inventory.
---
This means the following:
---
* There will be **NO REROLLING** of your existing legendaries;  
---
* There will be **NO UPGRADING** of your existing legendaries' star ratings; and  
---
* There will be **NO ADDING STARS** to your existing gear.
---
I'm so, so glad I've been managing my own expectations for this vendor. Phew! At least player vending sounds dope.
---
No one said stealth through it fully. With 1 point perk card, ANYONE can melee attack the queen and get x2 melee dmg repeatedly. Need over 80 rad resist to not take rads from her though.
---
Notes are out explaining the Legendary Vendor. https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3ExPLDXM5fgLJm9WiWLGrK/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-patch-9-preview?utm_source=Community&amp;utm_medium=Social
---
&gt; The more Legendary Scrip you have when the Purveyor arrives, the more legendary weapons and armor you will be able to buy! 
---
So we will be buying items, not rerolling one of the stars on our current legendary items? How will the items available from the Purveyor be determined? 100% random?
---
A **plasma flamer**?
---
Erm... How do you equip/use it??!
---
Xbox here and I've tried and failed.
---
If there was a guarantee of a three star drop, even Nocturnal crap, I would try
---
Default Lucio main here. I feel you!
---
Arguably, once the vending machines are operational we can sell our surplus and thus reduce the amount of stash space needed.
---
Yeah, so makes me think people that lost items it might have accidently dropped like you said and either dropped through the map to be lost to the ether or they don't notice it dropped and fast travel away/ server hop. But, who knows it could just been deleted from their inventories entirely. I don't know if this could be related to missing weapons, but when you favorite a specific item like 10mm it sometimes gets replaced by a 10mm you picked up and its possible people could be dropping/selling/crapping the wrong 10mm if they didn't pay attention.
---
The taxes should go into an in-game lottery system where we can spend more of our extra caps on lotto tickets.
---
I like breaking into locked camps and just leaving a bag with salt in it .
---
Yep.  I remember selling an explosive flamer (can't recall 2 shot or not) to Watoga train station thinking "it's already fire so it can't be that much more of a help" for some STUPID reason.
---

---
So we will be buying items, not rerolling one of the stars on our current legendary items? How will the items available from the Purveyor be determined? 100% random? I have a bad feeling I'm going to turn in my hundreds of saved up junk 3 star legendaries only to have nothing good be available on the vendor =(.
---
Optimist POV:
---
it brings a portion of trading back into the game, and will likely remove some of it from ebay et al.
---
Makes it "safer" for both, in that no fears about disappearing dropped bags, improperly swapped items, take the money and run, scams, etc.
---
Especially If player vending machines are centrally located, then sellers will need to be (acutely, perhaps) aware of other people prices.  For identical items, buyers will go machine to machine and price compare, likely buying from the lowest priced vendor.
---
Ergo, If you price something too high, you will likely not make the sale, and the item will gather dust in your inventory.
---
If prices are not affected by (hard bargain and grape mentats) then it equalizes buyers.
---
As such, market forces will moderate pricing, likely stabilizing the market.
---
That you get rid of unwanted items, and buyers get stuff they want/need, then its a win/win.
---
You still have the option to keep an item on your person and sell it the same way as you do now (haggle), 
---
but I would guess buyers will be checking vending machines first.
---
I had an explosive flamer once :D Should have kept it for such a high demand moment.
---
wowwww that would suck but it was pretty funny LOL
---
Levity. I like it.
---
Don't know why you're being downvoted. Caps are a horrible currency and we badly need a currency like the Chaos / Exalted orbs from Path of Exile that are consumed by players to craft things, to curb inflation.
---
I reached level 100 yesterday while doing the monster mash event, I‚Äôve been doing it a lot but I guess I didn‚Äôt reach level 50 while doing it. Just to have another idiot that plays this piece of garbage confirm what Alan said about the monster mash event. No one knows of any workaround? I actually have to level a second character to lvl 100?
---
What's that mean?
---
in theory yes...  tbh, i'm just bad at inventory management, and want more space to enable my hoarding and lack of wanting to waste time micromanaging my inventory
---
Is there any info on this anywhere?
---
Geez leave some jokes for the rest of us.
---
Xbox damn..
---
How do you know they are there?
---
My chameleon gear and sneaking.. pftt ive watched events and once or twice helped an active event.. but im not a hero. 
---
If you die... well.. i might sally forth and see what yer goody bag dropped.. but cmon man.. yer out right telling people how to play the game. 
---
I get it.. yer salty.. but.. some of us like to watch! ;)
---
The plasma gat is only bad because energy weapons don't have armor penetration. Once they fix armor pen, they will be the best dps weapon in the game.
---
Amen to that. Such an eyesore every time I visit my camp.
---
I'm pretty sure you're not playing the game the way Bethesda intended, which is fine. As the late, great Bobby Brown said. "It's my prerogative." But let's be real, you're expectations don't align with the game mechanics. No where did Beth ever say you will get the best of everything and exactly what you want. That's just not how this game works. For example... The fasnacht event. They stuck to their guns with the extremely limited rare masks. Add to that, they've "adjusted" legendary loot already and it didn't exactly get better. I'm sorry, but that's just the reality. At least how I see it.
---
Finally, someone who‚Äôs willing to shoot the damn thing instead of calling it their god!
---
yeah there is still no fix, Bethesda will probably never fix it
---
I tried to do Encryptid once (Finishing the questline &amp; it started then), but \*everyone\* seemed to show up and I was lagged out so hard for most of it.
---
Somehow we failed the event, even with a ton of people and guys staying on the pylons. I think it was probably the timer
---
Game developers will continue down this road of creating a false grind for the sake of longevity.  Its far harder to come out with actual content ie. well developed stories, than it is to create a grind for the best things that players might want.
---
There's also the issue of bad design surrounding legendary drops, but the reality is that its this way because it slows down progression.  Most people are done with the story and after you do an event a few times, there's really nothing left to do...  aside from hunting down elusive stuff that's been made rare to create the grind.
---
Look at Fallout 4 - I played it for a long time, but stopped playing before the DLCs came out and I've never been back since.  And the only reason I had like 200+ hours in FO4 was because I spent a ton of time with settlements.  But after finishing all the alternate endings, there was just little else left to do, the game dies and I moved on.
---
Aww gutted thought with a name like llewellyn I'd found a fellow welshie  player üòÇ
---
You've touched on the inherent issue of people making wild assumptions based on nothing and then being furious when the content is actually released.
---
Right now if you go over 25K in a trade the caps just dissapear. It freaking sucks. I've done that a few times now and lost a few thousand caps because I forgot to xfer caps off.
---
Personally I think just having a vendor who repairs gear for caps is all they need to add.  Then you have a choice to scavenge the mats to repair to 200% with perks yourself or pay caps for a quick 100% fix to get back into the action.  Heck, it could just be another tab in normal vendors inventories showing you how much to repair each piece of your gear.
---
I know, I know.  Teh repair kits! Ugh. Once again, stupid repair kits no one wanted in the way of fixing a very large glaring problem in their game.
---
80 rad resist is super easy but rads without a power armor or hazmat suit you still take a fair few rads per sec.
---
What if you start a party outside of the game?
---
That would actually be awesome....and a lot more in depth than my own ideas.
---
I feel like those changes may be damn near impossible though, as it seems like for the survival vs adventure mode, Bethesda changed a pacifist flag or two. Your changes would be a lot more work intensive....though it would be cool as hell
---
My deathclaw gauntlet does about the same damage as my TSE shotgun.  Granted, my build is shit and isn't terribly set up for either.
---
I'm on PC, that's not a thing.
---
Thats an exaggeration...
---
I've been running more of the in your face type shotgunner as well, with 3 perks in FireProof and Admantium Skeleton.  Great fun so far using enforcer to blow out kneecaps the finishing them off with a melee weapon.
---
I'd assume so - just take the pieces off of the frame and you can sell / trade them like anything else.
---
Only thing so far is the Patch 9 notes:  https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3ExPLDXM5fgLJm9WiWLGrK/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-patch-9-preview?utm_source=Community&amp;utm_medium=Social
---
Meh, people usually don't agree on much on this sub. I'll take the downvotes, it's much better then someone sending me a long-winded rant I will not read
---
It's just explosive. Explosive was doing way more damage than intended. Was very noticeable on survival - nothing one shot me except explosive shotguns.
---
Will level of the item and/or level of the character who turns in the item have any effect on the quality or quantity of scrip received?
---
Capture as many workbenches as you can and defend them. You should be able to rank up pretty fast.
---
In a game where I can sit on my porch and play a banjo for that matter also...
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States
---
It‚Äôs cute you don‚Äôt experience America‚Äôs underbelly. Yeah, it‚Äôs definitely true. Law enforcement can levy an asset seizure vs your items and take them regardless of how you got them. 
---
But off topic posts don‚Äôt belong here.
---
Book character :)
---
In Warframe you get prime gear that you can sell for a special currency called Ducats. Every two weeks a vendor named Baro arrives that has things you can only buy with Ducats. Certain weapons, a quest, some cosmetic items, and primed mods (which make your gear more powerful) can be bought from Baro.
---
I like the idea of collecting upgraded legendary weapons and armor but there is so little to do with any of it, why bother?
---
It's so hard to multiply pricing by 1.1....
---
-*slow clap*- that was figgin hilarious! 
---
Sadly i have only one upvote to give.
---
But you earned it lol
---
Its not as crazy as you think. Barely anything I've suggested would need new art or animations or anything just tweaks to the game rule set and difficulty.  
---
This is what I thought was coming when they said 'suvival mode'. Survival games are challenging and often unforgiving with high risk, high reward scenarios. Even Fallout 4 had a 'survival mode' that was significantly harder than this.   
---
What they have released is just a carbon copy of adventure mode with slap damage off, less fast travel and a top 3 scoreboard. A total missed opportunity if you ask me!
---
We're going to need a Cap limit increase as well with this... i know many players now sitting on or near that 25k mark.
---
Ah, but there could be a quest where you help her discover the truth about the contest and finally give her some peace. (Yes, I've been theorymongering about this for a while now.)
---
That just inflates everything even more...
---
Personally, I like the idea of a buy-out type system over pvp. I like workshops. They give me plans that I can't afford from vendors. The pvp aspect of them is totally unnecessary. Twice I've been at Poseidon Energy workshop only to be insta-killed by someone 100+ levels higher than me, be forced to give up my hard-collected junk because they simply won't let me retrieve it and watch them take the workshop and not even use it.
---
You raider üòâ nah I'm not salty but when I'm the one doing the event and the mouth breathers or crunchers are there being blatant about it it's like whyy üòÇ
---
Yup big let down.  I don‚Äôt want to just buy a legendary off a vendor, I want to boost up my own favorite weapons.  Reroll stars and the like.  It can still be a grind, even need a little luck, I‚Äôm ok with that.
---
I laughed more than I should have..
---
Yes exactly.
---
Ahhhh
---
Not very long, it's just straight forward. I think that section took me a few hours, some extra time due to the bug when you jump instead of connecting a wire.
---
Turns out it's that's where she will be coming from
---
LEGENDARY EXCHANGE MACHINES
---
The Purveyor is a new Mole Miner vendor who will be making her way to the Wasteland later this month, but she doesn‚Äôt deal in Caps. When she opens the doors to her shop, you‚Äôll be able to exchange a new type of currency, called Legendary Scrip, for legendary items. To help you prepare for the Purveyor‚Äôs arrival, we‚Äôre adding Legendary Exchange Machines that you can use to break down your unwanted legendary items and turn them into Scrip.
---
Ôøº
---
We will have more details to share on the Purveyor next week. We hope the addition of Exchange Machines will help you free up some storage space and fill your wallet with Scrip while she travels to the surface
---

---
Hey, you found my gauntlet that I dropped!  Mind returning it to me?  Pretty please!
---
Although I had some lingering hope that we could re-roll stats or upgrade, I thought that would be too good to be true and create god-tier items rather quickly.
---
Buying items right from them for a separate currency doesn't sound too terrible as long as she has good stuff.
---
It‚Äôs a perk in STR, not the wonky blocking mechanic. Three ranks offers 45% melee damage reduction. It‚Äôs good.
---
You are right it's her tunnel
---
Yeah I read. Looks like we're buying randomized legendaries from the vendor, not rerolling items. Guess I'll be turning in all those "almost good" weapons after all. Also sounds like 99.9999999999% of the time you're going to find her and her inventory is going to be nothing but garbage. I'll accumulate 10s of thousands of "legendary scrips" and have nothing to spend them on. Sigh.
---
I agree but we need to build up to that or the servers may have issues. The next update should be 1000 and the next 1200 and so on. That way they can see how the servers handle it. Jumping to 1600 right away could cause huge issues!
---
I've been on Discord chatting with people, and randomly heard "Ooh, a paper bag!" immediately followed with "What the hell? That's \*my\* gun! But I didn't drop it..."
---
Something is going on, and Bethesda needs to own up to it.
---
That's why I'm clinging tightly to my Gatling Plasma, Flamer, and Cryolator now.
---
It stops caps from becoming worthless. Hyper inflation.
---
Just like with this game, I'm going to give Anthem time. A long time before I get back into again. The gameplay and flying was so solid, but the direction they had with it was clearly what hampered the game. I wish Bio the best, but I don't think they deserve to be hated on, especially after that article went out calling out their leadership.
---
Well 3 months on and I am having the same problem as well as  World challenge&gt;Discover Locals within .....&gt; Discover the Cranberry Glad/Valley Galleria and Grafton Dam and Collecting various issue of magazines none of which register.
---
I put in a ticket to Bethesda support who told me to:
---
Restart the Game
---
Power Cycle the Console
---
Clear Save Data
---
Uninstall and Reinstall the Game
---
Which I have done, all to no avail.
---
I'm trying to not make the same assumptions. It literally only says items. It doesn't specify what those items are.
---
Ah that makes sense, thanks for the link!
---
...120k? f-k me, i got 98caps from a train station vendor...
---
Same issue here...I've completed that event for 3 times now.
---
Agreed. Me personally, I was only thinking modifiers for food/damge/rads/fusion Core drain and player locking like you mentioned.
---
Maybe if/when they release private/mod servers, well see something like this pop up? I'm assuming thats still on the horizon at least
---
Are the stash crates indestructible? Like you could build a fort using them and not worry about enemy players?
---
Was discussing that with a friend last night.  The game really loses something at high level where we tromp around the wastes as gods.  Would have been cool to cap levels and slowly increase the level limit with new add in and expansion areas.  Debated going back to my old pistol build to change it up some and add some risk, or run bloodied for the lower HP pool risks.
---
It's definitely improved a hell of a lot since launch. There's still a ways to go, but it's getting there.
---
It was a long story about how when they were a kid, they used to poop in their moms bed. Mom wasn't pleased, so they through them in an insane asylum when they were 16. Long story short, they now use Fallout to literally shit everywhere and claimed they were the one who shit on OP's bed, but someone called bullshit (no pun intended) and they threatened to go shit in that person's bed in real life.
---
Thanks, i should've explained in my post.
---
Honestly, the fact that the Purveyor isn't named Hans upsets me the most.
---
Oh totally, I get that. I just personally can't be bothered with it.
---
Unless you‚Äôre doing pvp, some legendaries are decent. Game is not that difficult and you can get by. PVP is clunky af in this game so I just kill from a distance.
---
Lol even small, low budget game producers get the simple and basic stuff done right. It blows my mind that they‚Äôve published fallout 76 when they did. The game isn‚Äôt even a finished product 7 months after it was released üòÇ just embarrassing, truly the last game I‚Äôll ever buy from Bethesda
---
Never sink Loot filter and the different strictness level is in the options in terms of Loot filter. The game is not for switch. Just came out for ps4 but has been on xbone for a couple years iirc.
---
You should be nicer to pelicans.
---
The legendary vender appears to be destined to be placed in the harpers ferry train station.
---
I was going to say that! I doubt we will see anything like this come from the dev team but most certainly once private servers and modding drops. I guess it all depends on what 'mod support' means for Fallout 76 as I have a feeling it will be heavily moderated compared to Fallout 4. The fact that the servers will need to be rented from BGS suggests this.
---
Ok but explain how they become worthless. Legitimate question here. I dont understand how one player having 1 million caps and another having 1k makes caps worthless? You've obviously worked hard for every cap you earn. Not saying there should be no limit mind you but I dont understand how their idea of economy works.
---
Get well rested as soon as you log in for an xp boost. Join as many events as possible.
---
I used to be an adventurer, like you. Then I took an arrow to the knee.
---
I would commission it. Do you have an online portfolio?
---
A lot of people have "mule accounts" where they give themself any stuff they don't really need but still want. I'm not exactly sure how you can get two characters in the same world but I'm sure there's help out there somewhere
---
What's the New Vegas line on whether the Legendary Vendor accepts Atoms for payment?
---
...oh come on.  Half the reddit is thinking this...
---
Can you only get some rewards at certain locations? Because I‚Äôm doing the one at Aaronholt and I‚Äôve only gotten the club, the spiked, electrified, and poisoned mods for it, as well as the horned, electrified, and spiked mods for the shepherd‚Äôs crook (I got the crook plan and the shard plan from the bbq shack event). I might just be unlucky but i got almost all of those in the first day and ever since then I haven‚Äôt gotten anything new.
---
Sure, i can dig this
---
You have to land the actual kill shot, unfortunately. Just participating isn‚Äôt enough. I got the reward, but I also got lucky with two other players involved.
---
if vending machines have a separate weight limit, it would perform a similar function - the weight of the items you are currently holding for vending would no longer count against your stash, as they would be in the vending machine container.
---
That anything in the machine is subject to sale at any time may help prevent using it as extended stash space.  
---
They would have to do some sort of controls though - otherwise you know there will be people who   
---
 would price an item greater than the cap limit in order to prevent its sale - effectively making the vending machine extended storage.
---
  With the secondary question of how is vending going to affect cap limit?  If you have 20k caps and someone buys &gt; 5k worth of stuff from you, what happens?  Is the sale of the item that puts you over 25k declined?
---
or
---
they only allow you to make X caps per day?
---
You have to select the person's name and a menu pops out allowing you to accept the request.
---
The only let down with those Legendary Scrip, is that we probably won't see a lot of legendaries in common vendor from someone who decided to clean his stash or after a SBQ event.
---
I quite liked that, and I actaully bought some cool item in such occasions
---
Wow that sounds very Fo76 ish.
---
That's it, I'm relocating to the Free States!  Harpers Ferry here I come!
---
Holy smokes my boatload of rolling pins and golf clubs are now a gold mine, since the scrip is not item-specific üëçüèª
---
I don‚Äôt think you start getting the mods for either until you get the weapon plans
---
Damn this is pretty dumb, and even more infuriating since the last thing I did last night was solo a SS random event...
---
Overseer is a human. purveyor is a mole miner that‚Äôs a female
---
I think 76's swampfolk clothing would look similar to a [cranberry farmer](https://img.rezdy.com/PRODUCT_IMAGE/71040/047_lg.JPG) (with a more post-apocalypty vibe). Farm clothes with waist high waders, patched together.-
---
I'm pretty sure they are destructible, but I haven't tested it in pvp. (although the lower parts of the stash boxes don't show bullet holes, for some unknown reason. And i think they used to be indestructible in the early days? At least they were popular to block off workshops.)
---
It makes me not even want to have crops in my camp
---
I would like this but limited to a point, I wouldnt like coming back to camp to find 500 weight of water
---
Ps4? And i gave it to my freind sry
---
In warframe, there are weapons called prime weapons. These are usually stronger than their normal counterparts.
---
You build them by running missions to collect the parts (barrel, receiver, stock, and blueprint).
---
If you get unwanted pieces/duplicates, you could either trade them to other players, or put them in Baro Ti‚Äôkeer‚Äôs box for a currency called ducets.
---
Baro appears every 2 weeks for a couple days and has a selection of rare cosmetics, rare primed mods, or even special ‚Äòprisma‚Äô weapons. You buy these from him using credits, and ducets.
---
That‚Äôs what I was afraid of, from my experience my shotguns seem ‚Äòabout right‚Äô pre nerf my DB was hitting around the 700 mark, now it‚Äôs around 300 &amp; the damage I‚Äôm dealing seems to fit with that.
---
The patch notes also indicate the shotgun damage was being incorrectly reporting in the PIP boy.  Wonder how far off that damage was?
---
Thats why i prefer the stashes. If you drop stuff, the paper bag is gone for sure after a while. In the stashbox i hope it will there until serverreboot or someone picked it up. But thats just my speculation :)
---
I mean that‚Äôs what they were, but at this point they‚Äôre some other creature entirely. I don‚Äôt if there‚Äôs any way to see what they look like without their miner clothing besides the face.
---
I will tey to get it back tho
---
I've conquered everything in pve and have great legendaries for that. Can solo burrows, nuke silo, sheepsquatch. But, when I go to pvp I get shat on by Exploding weapons every time. That's the frustrating part, I'm OP in pve but get owned in high tier pvp. (Btw my build is heavily pvp focused)
---
That‚Äôd be interesting.
---
Naming is account side doesn't show for other players from what I've seen.
---
I agree but I had to plant some for my Grape Mentats and some Crit food. It looks terrible.
---
Yeah I've olny just hit lvl 50 and everytime I've encountered a sheepsquacth everyone is more than happy to share and help! This guy had no class he could have shot it and helped instead of bitching! Good show OP lots of good people out there but it's the few crappy ones that stick with you. Happy hunting vault dweller!!
---
1000x yes.
---
Or even effects specific so does crappie Hunter and mutant weapons and armor are worth just as much as the bloodied furious and then yielding legendary effects to the machine
---
Mole miners were/are human.
---
You seem really invested still
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs the same with the ‚Äúkill a legendary deathclaw‚Äù and ‚Äú kill the SBQ‚Äù. Good luck landing the kill shot with 12 others involved.
---
Seems that way.
---
Fox,..Er, I guess Disney now, would probably be all too happy send their lawyers a calling.
---
AA is the third best legendary effect for gauss rifles, in my opinion. Outclassed only by instigating and bloodied. It is devastatingly effective with sneak attacks and will one shot many enemies. The only real drawbacks are the low ammo capacity and slow fire rate so you'll need an alternative option if you get swarmed.
---
I disguise my corn by putting the resort vase in a way that looks like the vase is holding it. It‚Äôs expensive though
---
Big question, can the Legendary Scrip be shared between my account players?
---
But legendary bulk is tradable!! ;)
---
Yes...very annoying
---
I drop a lot of fusion cores, plans &amp; 1* items in the trash can outside Artisans Corner (where all the crafting stations are) in WS. I‚Äôll leave a bag with a purified water by the trash can, just to get people‚Äôs attention.  (PS4)
---
They said they were doing double what they were supposed to be doing, but I think that just meant the explosive portion, so not THAT far off.
---
I think its called a money sink...pulls money out of the game to maintain the value of money and the gamers incentive to make more of it. I am not for or against...although, I am sure tweaks to the % tax will be made over time.
---
Yoah brudda, i have interest in dem mole tiddiez not gunna lie
---
Because it works like real world money. Good and services are traded for money, but if that money appears out of thin air for completing quests or looting. Then it's value decreases.
---
Cap limits force people into using the caps when they reach the limit. This continues Caps being used as a source of trading. Which helps the in-game economy not becoming stagnant
---
Srry but i don't give a damn if you're getting killed in pvp by them. I kill way faster with other weapon and i don't pve to suffer because pvp guys cry.
---
Yea they literally just made bloodied explosive the same value as my stalkers‚Äô rolling pins as long as the number of the star is the same.
---
Like it respawns later?
---
&gt; They want you to earn it.
---
Exactly what needs to be "earned" in this game? 
---
Can you name one single piece of worthwhile equipment that is not gated behind RNG? 
---
Sure, there is the occasional Survival challenge which rewards unique weapons but the conditions of these challenges are, again, mostly based on luck. Acquiring a good weapon might take just one Whitespring loop - or a hundred, no matter how good you are (or how much you suck). Skill and knowledge about the game is a total non-factor here. 
---
Considering Bethesda's track record, I don't think the Vendor is going to turn out to be a bad thing - however, I predict that it's not going to reflect (at all!!) how people who have put a significant amount of time into FO76 (or who just feel very passionate about it) actually play this game! It's going to reflect how the devs want us to play the game, because at some point it might have sounded good on paper. And THIS is why FO76 has been (and continues to be) such a monumental disappointment for many of us. There is a huge discrepancy between what sounded good in theory and what the actual in-game experience turned out to be. Bethesda seems to have completely lost touch with its playerbase... either deliberately or due to a series of very unfortunate decisions, going way back to FO3.
---
I can't wait to exchange 200 Legendary Scrips for a 3* Nocturnal Pipe Rifle with %40 Bashing Damage.
---
Not really, man. I'm bored at work. Responding to you is just another thing to pass the time.
---
And mole miners used to be...
---
I think it is crazy stupid that I can sell something to a vendor, their cap limit lowers, and I get nothing when I am at max.  It is my own fault as well for not noticing but a hard stop would be nice.
---
How is the promised feature "broken"? We havent even seen how they will actually be handled, all we know is the stuff we are told until they are released. I dont see anything that goes against "promised" feature.
---
I owe my soul to the company store.
---
There needs to be a way to get caps away from the players and out of the game otherwise nothing can move, and prices will sky rocket. Hence a cap limit, with cap sinks. You can Google hyper inflated economy for a more in-depth answer. I'm just on my mobile and heading to work atm.
---
He has a caps limit, too......wait, does he ?!
---
So were half the things we fight in this game, big deal. Tbh idc about the lore for fo76 I don‚Äôt like the whole only terminals and holotapes thing, and the lack of options.
---
Why buy from players when you can exchange your rolling pins for your dream legendaries at the purveyors shop ü§Æ
---
Yeah, I have a location each missing on two different zone challenges. 
---
I put in a ticket because I had a bunch that should've checkpointed the challenge, and all I got was told to unlock them on a new character. Two of them I discovered on my newer (post BETA) character didn't checkpoint the challenges either.
---
Sneaking a low level (lv7-12, she leveled from the exploring) through Ash Heap, Cran Bog, and up into The Mire was a pain
---
I'd like to see an increase too, since between vending and CAMP decoration, the Stash is being used for more things.  Perhaps a round 1,000.
---
Either that or, as exploitable as it may be, have things for sale or on display be weightless.
---
The random spawn sheepsquatches may be easier to solo kill if you're having trouble with too many people in the event.
---
Ledgenary vendor will be 90% wood armory,10% knifes/daggers. I am siked to cash in some instead of selling em for 5 caps!
---
Tuesday!
---
That explains how 1 knew where I was at, I just joined a hardcore server and already died and dropped good stuff I'm just trying to work for the weekly special item
---
Maybe three scrip for a three star item and one scrip for one star item, so it‚Äôs not that difficult anyways
---
When I see a sheep I ping everyone local and let them know over voice, if they dont come at least they have fair warning
---
Have not fought a queen inside the rad zone since November. Gotta launch it offset so v9 or delta are not in zone. Delta pref since cooking and power armor station
---
I'm not a "pvp guy", was just stating the fact. I've never used them in PvE, but I have to assume based on the math I've done that they are indeed very inferior to other weapons.
---
I feel so bad laughing at this but the lead up to the discovery is just epic. The Nuka Cola Dark thing.
---
Still, that's messed up man.
---
I have my entire camp open except for my bedroom door because that's a sacred space here in the Wasteland. I put a few military cots in my "workshop" for weary travelers because do you know how hard it is to wash those WHITE linens adorning the VaultTec bed?
---
Do you know any spots they like to spawn? Im pretty new at this game still and i'm not sure how everything works yet.
---
Oddly, the Cranberry Glades aren't actually known for cranberries, but the color of the grass that grows in the waters. Still, I imagine the swampfolk having wader-style clothing as they have to slosh through the deep waters that exist between the bog and the mire.
---
Let's see who can get more steel in 24 hours then? We regularly do 8k-10k steel a day. It's not that hard.
---
Like I said before, I play on a team (like numerous other people). By all means, keep thinking you're right. Ill keep my way of doing things and rack up easy caps and ammo... while you waste ammo to get mats to make... ammo.
---
You want to play the game efficiently yet you have to server hop numerous times and only have one other account. Much efficient. Super impressive.
---
You think what you said here makes any sense, but I assure you it doesn't
---
Thank you. Makes sense.
---
There's no prerequisite to find it that I'm aware of, you just have to find it.
---
Found mine by accident in from of the moth man statue in point pleasant. Just look for a dead tourist laying in front of tourist spots. There are several YouTube videos showcasing possible locations to find it. Good luck!
---
Thanks. Appreciate the answers.
---
From what I understand, the camera itself is 'world loot' so other players can grab these off the dead bodies. The best idea would go somewhere with a camera and continue world hopping until you receive the camera.
---
lol same here, exhausted mules on suicide watch
---
A lot of the time people want more than just legendary items. For example I want every outfit in the game. I have 3 sets of PA with 3 different paints and types but I need a t51b right leg like, asap. Some people will pay good money for rare items. Or even just crap they have extra of or have modded.
---
So question, on the roadmap when they discussed 
---
"New Features: C.A.M.P. Decorating, Player Vending, Functional Camera ‚Äì Use items from your stash to decorate your C.A.M.P. "
---
Do they mean the display cases? If so that's going to suck, I've been correcting certain things in the hopes of being able to place them.
---
It's a fun little joke, their back legs have gone smol and their front legs have gone swol
---
Then the items offered better be damm good if they're that valuable
---
oh man, it's going to be hard to capture the bizarre essence of the rant. It was this guy complaining about people who lock their doors and asserting that he was going to destroy any camp with locked doors that he saw, except that he was using his phone dictation software to type the post, so it went on for a while and a lot of it didn't make sense. I know it doesn't SOUND that bizarre, but it really was.
---
Correct point OP, and somewhere I already was.  I was really hoping we could upgrade our gear, even by sheer luck (turn in 5 2-star legendaries, reroll a 2nd Star on a piece of gear of your choice).
---
Now I‚Äôm betting we‚Äôll have to server hop to find different purveyor inventories of legendaries in hopes of that AAE weapon or whatnot.  Frankly a gear reroll option can work in this same script system, not allow you to god roll on a whim, and still provide end goals for people that don‚Äôt end the fun of finding new gear.
---
And don‚Äôt get me started on upgrades of lower level gear.  Was hoping some favorite weapons could see fresh use.  Good thing I was expecting a system like this.
---
You have to expand the trade emote on the emote wheel.
---
Took me 164 levels to find Super Duper and now I don't know how I crafted without it.
---
Definately a facepalm moment when I realized how many rounds of ammo, food, and chems I would have had if I had been using the perk all along.
---
If they do go this route, hopefully some of the more popular/useful mods may be implemented by BGS. For example, I think every BGS game has had an "unofficial patch" mod that fixes a lot of stuff. Something like that could be done by Bethesda, or maybe we'll see "mod store" type of stuff like in FO4...though I hope the latter won't be the case
---
And 50 server hops later I haven‚Äôt found an AAE weapon... 50 more will do it!  
---
Server hopping as a concept for gear acquisition is absurd.  It‚Äôs the dumbest form of gating.
---
Black powder rifles.. while short on range pack an amazing punch. A dragon.. even more so. 
---
I usually open with a volley from either dragon or black powder. Then switch to my lever action. Ive enioyed the night bonuses immensely
---
The only negative thing with that would be players exploiting the "extra space" with their heaviest items marked up to the highest price allowed. They could have a ridiculous amount of resources or legendaries for trading with the new vendor.
---
True, but so far the hardest stuff to get in this game is legendary items, now they make it so easy that you can just walk in and buy them. Instead of the usual killing and farming we now go shopping üõç
---
Cheers..for some reason it crashes. Never mind ..Ty for the reply. üëå
---
I wouldn't be surprised like you say that it will be 1 or 2 every 24h and it will keep track of this account wide, else people will just create multiple characters just for that.
---
Genius!  This will be less of a problem once the legendary vending machines go into effect, but until then I'm sure I can save some weight.
---
Sincerely,
---
500/240 lbs on person 800/800 in Stash
---
I havemtvquite gotten the right legendary black powder or dragon just yet, but soon...
---
The medical supplies place east of crevasse dam spawns one.
---
You obviously have never used a double barrel shotgun.  Range is a real factor and you may get two enemies in one shot with a wide spray up close,  but not a whole group.  This subreddit is a trip with the misinformation and exaggeration.  And with bloodied,  I guarantee a gauntlet at even 50% health does more damage than an explosive shotgun.
---
Low key. I want to be the vendor that new players come across to find good deals on good weapons
---
Walking the road from Watoga to Harper's Ferry.
---
I may have to look into that
---
Good question. 
---
Is this actually for building the Economy or just adding economic Entropy?
---
but why not? people can sell legendaries to each other, so it makes not much sense... or legendaries become untradable in next patch too?
---
I feel your pain I used to be a fatty my stash was at 800 and I was always overweight even with calibrated shocks on excavator power armor and the 100-pound login glitch. I made a mule for my 2* and 3* Legendaries and bulked and sold most of my stash I don't miss my 70 something bulk springs and gears I keep my black titanium and nuclear material around a 100 and check for missiles and mini nukes they add up fast also check for ore I had over a 1000 lead ore on my character it adds up.
---
Sadly, it seems like the latter.
---
[](/celestiablush1)Aye, you can tame certain animals with the rank 3 animal friend perk. you can only do it if they spawn alone in random encounter spots.
---
Will the player vending machines show the location of my CAMP in survival? I occasionally hop to survival for the weekly legendary guns and I'd stop doing that if my CAMP was visible there. I'd rather skip a few legendaries than having to dismantle vending machines everytime I relog to survival...
---
Servers schmervers  
---
If they were really worried about 'server stability' because of items in circulation, they wouldn't made their first major content expansion revolve around dozens of different recipes you keep sitting around at all times just on the rare chance Biv happens to ask for one of them. Or their first seasonal event revolve around dozens of costumes sitting in stashes waiting to accrue rarity value, and unique camp decorations that say, 'I was there!'  
---
That's a bogus excuse these days.
---
As far as I know, the BoS recon rifle is a standard hunting rifle with a full set of mods: Hardened receiver, stabilized long barrel, aligned stock, stinging magazine, suppressor and a short recon scope.
---
I'd normally recommend the perforating over the stinging magazine for the hunting rifle.
---
I picked up a level 50 bloodied machine gun and was like this is cool. I updated it to a prime receiver .308 and it now takes Ultracite shells? I go to make them and omg it takes all sorts of flux etc. I was able to make 100 shells and now I need all this flux!? to make more.
---
Can we buy flux or this ammo somewhere just so I can see the gun in action?
---
This sounds quite interesting, I like it.
---
You said "we", so that means you and your friends (I'm assuming 4 of you?) get 8-10K steel in "a day". I get 800-1000 in one clear of harpers / west tek, which takes 15 minutes. If the quota I need to hit to out farm all 4 of you is only 10K steel, that will take about 12 runs. 15 minutes (max) per run, 12 runs, that's only 3 hours of farming. I play 4-6 hours per day on the weekdays, 10+ on the weekend. Good luck lol.
---
You can get a mod for plasma rifles that turns them into a flamethrower.
---
10% fee will go towards robots cleaning the wasteland üôÑüôÑ
---
1. you 2nd and 3rd stars never work together. so it is basically a 2 stars weapon
---
2. It is level 40. You can sell it much better price if it is level 1 (because prestige system is coming or someone want to level up their alts) or level 50 (because...most people are now 50+ level?). 
---
3. Usually people only buy explosive shotgun or non-explosive for vampire.
---
The demand for this item is almost nonexistent. You can try if you can sell it to someone who is new to trading tho.
---
See I try there but it takes so long to get through it it's not worth farming.  Where exactly does the legendary spawn in there?
---
Really? What do you encounter?
---
Dang, I haven't seen that perk card yet. What SPECIAL stat is it? Charisma like FO4? I'll put my next 3 points in there so I'm ready, haha.
---
The top three thing is only showed if you‚Äôve gotten a kill. Shouldn‚Äôt show on map. Atm, sights still go invisible in chameleon and you still appear as a blur, just as a way to balance being invisible
---
Whoa. I hope you use a catch phrase whenever you have a kill like "You're history...."
---
Just added you. Sorry I'm late.
---
Who would put a bloodied explosive into that machine?
---
You have to be the one with the killing shot, so what I'd do if I were you is find a random spawn location and server hop. That way you're the only one with a chance to get that killing blow.
---
There is usually at least 1 multiple star legendary every time and if you have a good build you can kill them with ease. I can go do a full run in under 7 min
---
I have a feeling the 10% cap fee on sales will wash out in the end when people are pricing stuff so they don't go over cap limit. It would probably suck if your math is off and somebody buys up your product, and you don't get some of the caps from a sale due to being at max. Once you hit the max you'll have to find a way to deplete caps in order to keep running your store, or make no money at all. The 10% fee won't completely mitigate that, but it will help some. 
---
Also, there will be plenty of competition (probably everyone on a server, for every server) so it will come down to what people are willing to pay for something. If your competitor sees what you are charging, they will just nic your customers by offering lower prices. 
---
Your best bet when setting a price will be to travel to each CAMP with a vendor, makes notes of what they are selling stuff for, price your stuff cheaper so it moves, and then make a post on a subreddit advertising your business.
---
Eventually people will see your pricing, and set theirs lower, so you set yours lower.... and so on and so on. Only items that have a true value, like the stuff we craft by hand (ammo, aids, ects...), will probably stabilize in cost since each component has a true value. Other items like legendaries are going to be set at whatever the going market price will be. At that point the loss may come from time you spent grinding for the item, unless you apply a value to your time like an hourly rate. But even then someone's time may not be as valuable as yours so you may find yourself undervaluing just to make a sale.  
---
Since we can't really improve the quality of the items we sell, like using off-brand vs. brand name stuff (ex: everybody makes the same stimpacks, so no one is better than the other), the only way to get costumers will be hitting the right price points so stuff sells. 
---
The people who will benefit the most are those with multiple accounts that can run at the same time and can spread their vendors out across the map and servers. Literally saw a guy today in white springs with three accounts, same name on each except it was 1,2,3, simultaneously online. These guys will be your big money players.
---
I also suspect we will see the multiple account, hardcore traders with massive cap limits and stashes going to each vendor, buying all of their shit, and trying to corner the market. For instance, if I sell ammo I will go around to every vendor and buy up all of their supply. Then resell at a slightly higher price knowing that I might be the only one selling ammo on the server at that moment. 
---
It will take time, probably a few months, before the market and economy actually starts to establish itself. Some people will be the go to guys for stuff, while others will whither and flounder till they just become wholesalers to big buyer/reseller types. 
---
Really rare and high value items will most likely still be sold on subreddits and forums thru auction. Like a rare painting, it will only be worth what someone is willing to pay for it. 
---
What I really want to know is how charisma, hard bargain, and grape mentats will play into this. I can't imagine using buffs and perks to lower a player's set price... but I haven't seen it mentioned otherwise.
---

---
 &gt; Whoa. I hope you use a catch phrase whenever you have a kill like "You're history...."
---
Let‚Äôs hope player vending is released. I still wouldn‚Äôt mind waiting longer if there‚Äôs bugs. The last thing I want is someone to manage to dupe somehow through buying, alter prices, have items go away or something along those lines. 
---
I do hope that they make a central hub rather than having to go house to house. It would make pvp servers easier to troll if they don‚Äôt. Plus I don‚Äôt keep my house open for anyone and it‚Äôs impossible to get in unless there‚Äôs loading lag lol.
---
Lets see a full 60% extra shotgun damage and 60% increase in explosive damage on my max lvl pump action shotgun with a bloodied effect does currently (529) about 30% less damage than my max lvl bloodied death claw gauntlet (748) using mutations.  This does not take into account other perks for unarmed either.  All this at 40% hp and only 2 unyielding  armor parts and no chems.
---
Shotguns do not need a nerf in pve, nerfing them more would lower their damage output below most automatic weapons even for the automatic shotguns.  Melee meeds toning down a lot.
---
I found a bloodied gatling gun with a 25 percent faster fire rate in watoga once.
---
Lmao. 10%. Cap sink. Pretending caps matter in the first place. You're cute.
---
It shortens the range considerably, but it seems to hit more enemies when it does.
---
I've had both and I can live without it.
---
Thankfully not, had some ass trying to steal the ammo factory hiding in bushes invisible, managed to kill him thanks to the dot.
---
It'd be best to just wait for more information on how the system will work rather than attempting to conjecture how it might.
---
If you're unsure of the system, offload the legendaries you will be scrapping to a mule to get the weight off a character/out of a stash.
---
They REALLY need to implement something along the lines of the WoW Item restoration service. There isn't day that goes by on this sub where someone isn't missing something near and dear to them. 
---
Something that just like the WoW system, if the server has no record of them ever having it, they can't just request it. It keeps track of items being sold, disenchanted, or destroyed. (Granted those would have to change to adapt to Fallout 76) but the general concept is a sound one.
---
No, "we" meaning the entire NN team I play with (17 on XB1).
---
You're also under the impression that it's a waste to do it our way, when we can do it both ways lol. It's not like we just sit in our camps smelting down ores and farming for acid just for this. We can easily do both.
---
You continue thinking you're right. It's obvious you don't know how to play efficiently.
---
At least he wiped..
---
You should poop on his bed.
---
Extended time on Encrypted event

Fix the broken challenges that have been broken since launch

Souvineer/teddy bear displays

Fix corpses vanishing upon death
---
I'm actually pretty excited for this. I was worried about people not finding the vending machines, I'm glad that they will show your camp on the map
---
They better, because I went into a empty camp building once only to find a Deathclaw inside wanting to rip my guts out
---
This is madness. I didn't know, thanks for the info.
---
There's also a random spawn West of Watoga, South of the Antique store.
---
That is correct. I believe it has to be either a random encounter, or you get lucky and two spawn during the event and you kill the 'non-event' SS. That's how it counted for me, at least.
---
Ubisoft, makers of the assassins creed series. 13,000 employees.
---
EA, an enormous conglomerate, and Bioware's parent company, has nearly 10,000 employees. Same with Activision and blizzard.
---
Nintendo is one of the biggest companies in gaming. 6,000 employees.
---
Take 2 interactive? 4,400 employees
---
Rockstar is a company recently compared a lot to Bethesda. 2,000 employees. Capcom also has 2,000 employees.
---
CDPR, makers of the Witcher series and directly government supported in their country. 800 employees.
---
Bioware, creators of anthem. Mass effect, etc. Supported by EA, 800 employees.
---
Bethesda. Created Skyrim, modern fallout. Etc.

Only 400 employees. That's basically a single smallish office building. And they create games with ambition the likes of which is downright stupid considering they aren't much bigger than indie studios and don't even have stock. And it shows on release,
---
√áa cr√®ve les yeux
---
Your kinda on my thought process. It's still so vague. Is this inventory she has going to be random, global per week, or will it be a pick your perks where better perks cost more tokens?
---
Cool to see plasma guns and the flamer/cryolater get some love. 
---
But why the hell haven‚Äôt you buffed the Shishkebab yet?
---
This takes the cake for creative camp builds. It's too bad you probably don't have budget for decor
---
Weapon balance seems nice. But lasers? What about the lasers?!
---
It's not a mechanic yet, and nobody knows details. Adding stars is speculated but not likely. The reroll feature debuts in a few weeks with a legendary vendor names Purveyor. Google for sort of more info.
---
Worked for me.   
---
Southern Belle event anyway.  When I ported in, the duo running the event had both died a Yao Guai was killing a brahmin and the Sheepsquatch had just spawned. My appearance was like the Mysterious Stranger, appearing to save the event :D  
---
I got credit for the daily (and another meat pie recipe)
---
I know which ones I'll be scrapping upfront, its mostly the 3*s that I'll hold back from scrapping until I know how this is going to work.
---
I second the desire for Enclave Gas Masks with hats, also a backtrack on the 10% deductible from Player Vending since it‚Äôs a Vending Machine that you go up to, and put money into and not an Auction House
---
I've added mod kits to a legendary which has added a star. However the re-rolling I've no idea what that means....
---
Yaa i just cant see the game handing out godrolls  to everyone. There has to be some catch
---
Wait so it takes 17 of you farming for a full day to get 8K steel??
---
Most people was expecting the Legendary Vendor to allow you to "reroll" - which is to change one Legendary effect on a weapon/piece of armor for another, probably random.
---
maybe the 10% will be added to an overall bank...say the vendor bots stay at 1400 collective cap.  You buy out those 1400 caps, and then a few items sell from vendors...maybe the 10% goes back into the bank, making it so you can re-sell to vendors same day?
---
FIX. BULK. SCRAPPING. F. F. S.
---
No one assumed, [Todd Howard said the word "roll" and "customize" when describing the legendary item exchange system](https://youtu.be/rfyViQ9Uo_M?t=3225) and people thought he meant reroll existing legendaries to something you want, rolling and customizing have nothing to do with a legendary vendor.
---
I know, I'm sort of on the side of the fence that thinks this is going to be the ultimate troll.
---
they should add the ability to where if you sit on a toilet you get raw fertilizer and -2 lbs for a short period, like how you get an XP bonus for sleeping
---
I agree that rerolls would eventually lead to ideal items. As for "god-tier items", their mere existence relates to more fundamental flaws in the game balance of items and the history of duping. As for whether god-tier would be reached quickly, that all comes down to how much things cost. Astronomical costs are still possible under either approach.
---
I expect thirst and hunger to be increased by 30% drain rate, I like to keep my expectation based in reality. Lol
---
For teaming to work without having to exit the game.
---
There doesn't seem to be a reroll system. You get Scrips, and then you buy from whatever the Vendor has to offer in her inventory.
---
Now I gotta move my camp out of my delicious hiding spot to somewhere frequented so I can sell stuff. I'll miss my little valley :((
---
Nah after they reduced it last time, turret cost is perfectly reasonable.
---
I just hope CAMP immunity comes with it! XD
---
This is funny cause last night I went to that farm, killed everyone, and the spawns didn't count.
---
Im afraid so also.
---
Nobody can explain it because nobody knows how it will work.
---
Ok that must have taken forever!! But I LOVE IT!!
---
You keep getting placed there because there are probably no more than 5 players on the server.
---
Survival has been quite the failure, in my opinion.
---
RIP Explosive shotguns
---
Every Point in Agility improves your Sneak, so having armor with an agility modifier is also good, as well as using a weapon with +1 Agility, My Agility is 20-21 most of the time, and my Sneak ability is great.
---
Be careful about teaming up when you're trying to be sneaky, it seems to somehow break your stealth if a nearby team mate is discovered.
---
Use only Silenced, Melee, or Unarmed weapons, using Grenades will also get you discovered, definitely make sure you have the Chameleon Mutation, and as far as I have been able to tell, having more than 1 piece of Chameleon Armor doesn't change anything, instead, Opt for pieces with +1 Agility.
---
My level 212 Character doesn't even get highlighted when someone is using Berry Mentats, and in a side by side comparison, my shimmer effect is much less than others with lower Agility.
---
I have even been accused of cheating by several players because they were unable to find me, and got killed several times, with Stealth comes great Power, it's a very underestimated build.
---
People have to be right even when it's obvious what you're saying.
---
May a quilt of teddy bear/fuzzy skins?
---
Yep, not being able to customize legendaries is disappointing, but as you said, managing expectations has made this disappointment ... expected. The other downside I see to this system is the secondary market of looking for nice starter legendaries from the whitespring vendors will be gone. I've geared out several alt builds this way.
---
I only got FF to work when I was inside, which I didn't really understand but whatever lol.
---
Yeah, this nerf surprises me.  YMMV, but I'm not seeing tons of players running around with shotguns these days.  Melee and Gatling Guns though...
---
I should know better lol. You are also right.
---
Psn L3lue_kush
---
It would be cool. But you can't place CAMPS even remotely near to each other.
---
Yes, but if Bethesda is making 10% Caps from all player sales, they will very quickly hit the 25K limit.
---
What can Bethesda buy with Caps anyway?
---
:P
---
The rumor I've seen was that multiple-projectile weapons actually dealt +20% explosive damage per projectile (or +160% damage) rather than the +20% overall as claimed in the pip-boy. The patch notes suggest that something else was going on, possibly a single explosion per shot with +100% damage.
---
I've never had an explosive shotgun to test, so I can't confirm either way.
---
I might have one as well if want it
---
No, we do 8-10k steel a day to fulfill orders and ammo needs. We've done upwards of 400k on a Saturday when we had dozens of orders for steel or ammo. Not all that steel was smelted, as some of it came from scrapping (oh no, you can do both ways!!)
---
You have two accounts lol, stop talking about being efficient. I think I have two accounts that just have bloodied/AA weapons on it.
---
Sure... and the banjo has a historical context for the area, too. Without negative stereotypes attached to it. 
---
Honestly, I think it's a small issue, too. However, I can totally understand why a company would avoid it. 
---
Imagine if "Baptiste" in Overwatch was released as a practitioner of Vodou. Or we could find a "Minstrel" skin in fallout, complete with blackface. It's a modern world, and with that, comes modern sensibilities, and a shit-ton of negative press for anything that might be considered offensive, *especially*  anything considered culturally insensitive.
---
A few things, I think using the word earned wasn't exactly what I meant, and some are definitely taking it out of the context I intended. By earned, I mean it was hard to get, you didn't just have to kill a handful of creatures and BAM GOD roll weapon. It's putting in the time and dedication to MAYBE get it or something good. 
---
Also to your other point, there's an opinion amongst us players that have hundreds of hours in the game that we are more entitled to get what we want. It seems as though we are in the minority of the overall player base and the changes Beth does make more represents the overall player base. Your comment "It's going to reflect how the devs want us to play the game" is a reflection of that. The devs are going to direct the game in the best interest of its overall player base and just because we don't fit that criteria doesn't mean we're right and they're wrong. But that's just my opinion.
---
I agree.  I'm beginning to think these refer to the same thing, and that it will just be specific display cases, not any item anywhere.
---
Nothing was officially said about rerolling; lots of people have discussed the theory of rerolling current legendary items though which may have caused some confusion. What we did have officially before the Patch 9 Preview is from Pax back in February explaining how you can sell Legendary items for tokens that can be used towards legendary items later on which again may have caused some confusion then as well with the choice of words used to describe the Purveyor‚Äôs features
---
I always try to help, but sometimes I enter an event and nothing fucking loads. I can see other people killing empty air, so I know there's something there, but I can't see shit.
---
A BE Gatling Plasma is already the best weapon you can get in the game anyway (Expecially with the shotgun barrel) so what's the point.
---
\*heavy respirator breathing\*
---
haha!!
---
Psn: chlebostrom 
---
I will buy it for 1000caps if you are online
---
Still bugged as of today. On ps4. Would really like to complete the challenge. I deserve those atoms. Lol
---
&gt;double barrel shotgun
---
You're forgetting the pump-action shotgun, and the combat-shotgun.
---
Those can be modified to be viable at longer range.
---
Same, I wanted to be able to reroll a legendary effect or add an additional effect (for a very high price obviously) and just keep spending scrip on it until I got the rolls I wanted. They can make the best effects rare, just as long as I have something to work towards and I can use up these hundreds of garbage 2 and 3 star legendaries on my mules.
---
Oh you noob. I‚Äôll join you Chle
---
Thanks for posting this
---
I love this idea.  Might I suggest that fast travel be free to friends to encourage the social aspect of the game a little bit.
---
Im coming with you
---
All the highly desirable weapons and armor will still have to be found in the wild.
---
That 10% there just to remove caps of the economy Bethesda will do nothing special with it will get nothing in return
---
Right? I guess pushing it back a week wasn't long enough. It did give them a week of more literally impossible challenges to not pay atoms for though.
---
What about an inactive storage of sorts? Something that wasn't accessible without "*turning it on*". Somewhere you could store items you do not regularly need access to. Such as legendaries you plan to sell (which do take up a lot of weight) and rare materials or junk you are saving for whatever reason. Something that the server would not have to actively process for your entire play session, but only once you "activate" it through some ingame menu. Maybe add a lock to it that once unlocked you have access to the items. This could retain server stability, while also giving players access to more storage.
---
It appears you trade in your starred items for coins used towards buying newer equally sh.tty, quite possibly sh.ttier, or most likely sh.ttier than sh.t starred items.  Don‚Äôt believe me? You‚Äôll see.
---
Those are very good points and would make the survival a lot more appealing to me. Right now I don't have the desire to play because it really seems like it's a death match mode. 
---
One thing I'd like to see changed in both adventure and survival modes is how Wanted status works, people can completely destroy your camp and server hop with no consequences. Wanted status should lock your character for a given amount of time in that server, even if you log out/shutdown your PC
---
It happens. We're all just excited to see all the Strange Stuff :)
---
I speculate we'll be able to use scrip to reroll his name to Hans Moleman for sure. No doubt about it.
---
I'd say "If" they fix the armor penetration on Energy Weapons.
---
I've been hoarding all kinds of legendaries for weeks waiting for the legendary vendor. The fact that they're releasing the Legendary Exchange Machines early, allowing me to break down my legendaries, is a godsend which will free up a ton of space for me. Thank you, Bethesda!!!
---
Tax then we should have a tax date and receive 60%
---
 back at the end of a set amount of days.
---
I was fast scrapping and that fucking beret didn't have square next to it, because i was in PA since log in. Fucking bethesda can't script single .... Whatever i fucked up :D
---
I wonder how much damage from ememies will further be increased after this upcoming  patch.
---
oh. huh. wait really?!?!?!
---
Yeah, probably. The Legendary Vendor will be useful for those who conform with mid-tier stuff.
---
I use a vampire plasma flamer sometimes.  The problem is ammo consumption, I had build my camp at a copper ore node to keep it fed.  It is effective as it is, if the damage gets buffed then it just may become my default goto weapon.
---
Sounds about right, I came out with almost 1000 scrap once I smelted it all down.
---
I believe it will be scrip towards a weekly named weapon like the survival awards. I am sure the data miners will have it figured out by next Wednesday. I was so hoping it was a legendary mod you could add
---
‚ÄúNo one assumed.... People thought he meant‚Äù 
---
People ASSUMED. Period.
---
I believe the nerf will only affect the Double Barrel SG, as that is the one that was still doing massive Damage after the last Nerf.
---
The other issue was the displayed damage for Combat &amp; Pump Shotguns did not account for the Explosive Damage, which has been a bug since the very beginning.
---
I think we have a definite answer now as to how it will work if you haven‚Äôt seen yet
---
Yes the Camera is messy when it comes to ¬´¬†recognizing¬†¬ª. But I personally did the challenge without killing them, I took a nice picture of an angry family running after me.
---
&gt; In the end we will all end up bloodied melee till the next wave of nerfs. 
---
Well, bloodied something. You can even do bloodied pistols and it's still pretty good.
---
the 10% fee is to keep the vendor robots from attacking your camp, it is called "protection" money
---
I feel mixed on the legendary vendor. Right now, there's a nice secondary market of players searching whitespring vendors for nice, cheap 1\* starter legendaries, sometimes you get a great 2-3\* gem. Normally, this would just be replaced with the new player vending. Except, I see most players now selling the vendor trash to the legendary vendor instead. I see the cheap starter legendary market drying up with this patch.
---
I‚Äôve scrapped my PA doing that before üòÇ
---
You have a point there mister
---
My luck is trash but if you're on PS4 check the cash registers in front of the vendors.  After I hit 1400 caps for the day that's where all my 1 stars go.  Sometimes dozens of them.  Also any extra plans I find.
---
However, my very special lady friend found almost  1200lbs of junk and weapons including an bloodied 3* minigun and a 2* bloodied lever action.  Good thing for me she was more excited about the t51 nuka cola paint in there than anything and gave me the guns.  Love that girl =D
---
I wonder how vending will work with junk. Will I 
---
1)  can it be sold to players?
---
2)  If so, does it need to be bulked?
---
3)  can I set aside a fraction of a stack of junk or other stackable items (e.g. purified water, gunpowder, etc) for sale but still keep a separate stack  for personal use?
---
Dude! that's hilarious. I'm laughing way too hard. TY!
---
I use a Furious Flamer quite a lot, and its pretty competitive with my other weapons. It ticks very fast, racking up furious stacks quite quickly, plus it can hit multiple enemies in close quarters. Like most weapons, as long as it has a decent legendary effect it's pretty usable.
---
See... I lock my house BUT all my crafting equipment is in an unlocked barn, I have food available for all (and my camp is in an area that constantly resplendent a variety of meat), and I have an unlocked guest cabin that‚Äôs very comfy. I keep hoping that people will figure out to kindly leave me my private space since I‚Äôve totally opened the rest of my home just for guests.
---
Why are you complaining about the game when you havento manually scrap weapons, armor and outfits. And it directly tells you what scrap if any you get.
---
Yes. It does.
---
Another server hopping feature to the game. Vendor item selection will be 99.99% trash like rolling pins and similar. It will be similar shit show like hunting X01 jetpacks and calibrated shocks. Bethesda never fails to deliver broken features to this game and this won't be exception for that.
---
BGS gods want their tithes!
---
Yeah. Path of Exile's (PoE) economy is amazing. The fact that the currencies (chaos and exalts) are inherently valuable for crafting really anchors the economy. I would love for Bethesda to consider that model. PoE also shows that you can allow crafting and still have exceptionally rare items.
---
I got some. Be on later
---
Cool pic!
---
Would have been nice to get all the spawns in one place. RNG did not love me last night. 30+ death claws with no alpha either.
---
Still no legendary pipe revolvers?
---
I was a pistol build before going shotguns.  cut over the week before the great TSE Nerf.  Fun week!  A buddy handed me a bloodied 1* Western revolver the other day, and yea, the damage is actually pretty decent at 1/4 of my HP.  Would be a challenging build to run with, but could be fun.
---
Display cases coming shortly after the Purveyor releases
---
LIVE FREE OR DIE!
---
xur doesn't take a special separate currency though
---
not anymore, anyways.
---
While you're probably not wrong... You and I and everyone else literally have no idea. All they say is "items" they don't specify what the items are or the rarity of them.
---
Invest in tenderizer, stabilized, and one gun army.  That will make it eat a whole lot less ammo per kill.  If you fire it like a semiautomatic weapon most of your rounds will hit and you will probably cut your ammo use in half.  I use a two shot .50 all the time and I rarely go full rock and roll with it.
---
Agreed. However - as always I hope we are proven wrong
---
Sadly I think the reason might be because tradable scrip might instantly replace caps as the game's primary medium for exchange. There isn't much demand for caps right now.
---
All about that legendary scout armor, it looks so cool but theres no real reason to wear it yet
---
Come on, it's broken? What exactly is broken about it?
---
I'm not sure this is a bug...shouldn't stepping on nails hurt you, even if you're the one that put them there?
---
I have hope. It'll be interesting to see what "items" exactly means.
---
People wouldn‚Äôt sell BE for scrip, but by the latest information the only thing that matters at the recycle machine is the number of stars. The power and rarity aren‚Äôt factors when we exchange items for scrips. Now people should go out and buy as many cheap ‚ÄòLegendaries‚Äô as they can afford. Wood pieces and rolling pins are awesome since you get a ‚Äòstar‚Äô for 30 caps, instead of 300 for a one-star gatling gun. By measuring all Legendaries based on ‚Äòstars‚Äô alone, Bethesda is destroying the market already themselves.
---
Haha saw a little lvl 37 waiting at the ¬´¬†entrance¬†¬ª of the Uranium fever event. The guy left once it was finished, what a coincidence right? A true hero, a real gamer.
---
I would of thought that you could buy a randomized 1-3* item instead of fixxed legendaries. That would prevent server hop spam while giving you potentially a reliable drop source for 3* items
---
I think it will be more like the Torgue machines in Borderlands 2.  You could acquire at least one of the best weapons in the game from there (the Double Penetration Unkempt Harold).
---
There is square next to item you are wearing. But i joined server in PA so it didn't show it. I was hurry scrapping to get on another place, so i didn't check what i am scrapping. Btw you got nothing from scraping costumes so why the fuck they are scrappable???? 
---
It is my bad, but this game is terrible done. It may happen to you tooo soon, or never.
---
Login on a desktop with an account, log into a laptop with a different account, trade with oneself.
---
But a story doesn't last forever, and if a story does last forever then people complain about that (look currently at the Walking Dead). Of course story is important, but that won't be keeping the majority of people playing the game. I consider loot and character customization much more important in an RPG than the story told, because the loot and stats (or perk cards in this game) determine what type of character you are, and unfortunately this game doesn't have any choices you can make that determine storywise if your character is good or evil. 
---
The OPs complaint is people aren't into the story, and that's because there is no story. This has been the biggest complaint everyones had with Fallout 76, that it lacks any NPC interaction and any compelling story telling. If the legendary loot grind didn't exist, a lot less people would be playing the game.
---
I tend to find scrap a lot.  I regret not taking all the steel I found in the last good bag, there was over 1000 pieces.
---
Right, I'm thinking year 1 and Strange Coins. "Pffff, why would anyone waste their exotic weapon slot on a rocket launcher?"
---
Sounds like a Cardassian vanity project if you ask me.
---
If it was mostly silver it's probably the one in the atomic shop right now.
---
Mostly blue would be the nuka quantum skin.
---
Sure, but those things do weigh lots when they aren't on a frame, and some people might want to buy or sell a whole set all-or-none.
---
The currency will probably be Atoms.
---
I run assasins / sent with 1 chameleon/sent it it‚Äôs made a world of distance . It sounds like you aren‚Äôt sneaking , unaware of chameleon/escape artist mechanics and maybe don‚Äôt even know how to use your cav set
---
This is also a game where launching a literal bite-sized nuke at somebody on your team doesn't hurt them.
---
But I do see your point and agree.
---
It absolutely needs adjusted.
---
F-ing Cabin Campers. To Hell with em'
---
This is so beautiful. I‚Äôve only once had someone do anything fun at my camp. And even then , all they did was break in and sit next to me on the couch. The world needs more shitting on beds.
---
One of these  ? [https://imgur.com/a/ljv4gFy](https://imgur.com/a/ljv4gFy)
---
Works for me
---
The sad thing is, you're probably right :/
---
That‚Äôs my opinion. One smallish stash space for weapons, junk, aid, vending, displaying items at your CAMP, etc. Yes, I consider that somewhat broken, or at least able to be improved on.
---
If you don‚Äôt agree that improvements could be made to the storage scheme, that‚Äôs up to you.
---
Another good reason to hang out there. 
---
Go team robot, just dont shoot any of them
---
&gt; You have two accounts lol, stop talking about being efficient. I think I have two accounts that just have bloodied/AA weapons on it. 
---
Wait so how many accounts do you have? Why would more than 2 make me more efficient? Or are you saying 2 accounts is inefficient? I'm sorry I'm confused by your statement.
---
&gt; No, we do 8-10k steel a day to fulfill orders and ammo needs. We've done upwards of 400k on a Saturday when we had dozens of orders for steel or ammo. Not all that steel was smelted, as some of it came from scrapping (oh no, you can do both ways!!) 
---
OK, so to beat you, I need to farm the equivalent of 1/17th of 400K when I have a full day off, which comes out to roughly 24K steel. Although if we were really being fair, you wouldn't be allowed to farm harpers ferry or west tek, since those are the spots you've denounced so heavily.
---
It is there to allow players to get rid of items. Don't blame the game because you can't spend the literal 2 seconds to look at what is selected and go though the two step system to scrap gear.
---
It's like Dwarves in Lord of the Rings!
---
Yes but if you read what they wrote, they specified armor and weapons displays. Nothing about the kitschy items in game.
---
A spawn is basically a king, queen and hatching, that said either not, sure why, but same thing.
---
Not one of those :) I have all of them (do NOT tell my wife).
---
Well, I've uninstalled the game at last anyways and from the past changes and additions I feel like I wont miss anything. So far all their addition have been so low effort and limited so I doubt the vendor will change anything. It's probably just another addition to the repetitive weekly cycle of doing the same things over and over and over again.
---
Ignore my account name, I don't downvote things I agree with, which is your opinion of increasing the cap.
---
The event squatch worked for me. You may need to get the killing blow like some other challenges. There are random spawn sheepsquatches too that may be easier to kill without other people around.
---
That is baller as hell.
---
If you are on PC I buy weightless wood armor!
---
I do this to, only my camp is at a random event hotspot so it's usually justified and some unlucky super mutant gets a face full of exploding shotgun pellets.
---
Not a current item, and not the quantum - I have that one.
---
I've actually never seen this one before but it was pretty for sure.
---
&gt;"...you can basically...somewhat customize and roll for the legendary that you want."  
---
(I heard 'legendary', not 'legendaries', if that makes a difference)
---
Parse that.  I'm not sure exactly how I would.
---
That 10% deductible is to try to soak up some of the caps since they ruined their best chance to soak them with repairs because Bethesda just had to add repair kits for cash.  Swear none of their dev's have ever played a video game before.
---
Emergency Protocols - the jet pack is a novelty.
---
why does the black rider (famine)  look cooler than pale rider (death)
---
This. I hate the entitlement of some players. I have a few perk loadouts, depending on if others are around or not. for example,  if im at the white spring golf club...and i dont see anyone else around (i check the map first) i go with my more powerful load out. If you show up halfway through me soloing the place...dont get mad at me, for not standing on the bus waiting 20 minutes before killing everything. That being said, if i see others are near by, even at a neighboring house,  i lower my weapons damage and try to lure everything out to give people a chance to tag it.
---
And if i happened to spawn in as someone else is xp running... i have a choice...try to tag what i can or catch the next one on a server hop... in a game that's literally an endless grind,  why do people act so deprived if they miss one xp session somone else started?
---
I didnt even touch on nuke etiquette ... if someone goes through the trouble of running the silo... why not wait for them before vaporizing everything.
---
Ill end my rant here lol
---
lol what did it look like. The only others I can think of are the Nukashine one or the Quantum Skin that looks similar to the one in FO4
---
No, the Plasma Gun damage buffs won't affect the Plasma Gatling, as it already has some of the best DPS among heavy auto weapons. 
---
Also, yes, Patch 9 includes a fix for the single-shot Plasma Gatling issue! I'll check in on the ammo issue and will let you know if I hear anything new.
---
WTF are you commenting on this for then?? Move along, please.
---
All I want is a way to get legendary scout armor.
---
:|
---
I don't believe they are putting much effort to this new vendor. They most likely just copy-paste existing vendor mechanism and add randomly selected items for its inventory which cost different kind of "money". These items will be most likely using the same loot table like normal enemies have except they are all legendary items. With this mechanism we can expect that there will be 1 good legendary item for every 100 poor legendary items and maybe 1 exceptional good legendary item for every 500 legendary items. This is my wild guess based on previous updates how cheaply they try to make these new features.
---
You already said that, I'm curious *how* it's broken.
---
"I want more stash space" doesn't equal broken.
---
I want that dead wendigo in a clown costume to never reappear, and then to never speak of it it again.
---
Would be nice though to have a community list of bugs since launch and have them all addressed as a 6 month anniversary item.
---
Stuff like this make me really happy they are give to make camps immune to damage next update.
---
They do t at your camp, only at Workshops. I assumed there‚Äôs a hidden implication that you step over them...
---
I‚Äôm torn between being irritated and respecting your commitment.
---
When you sell items, you'll get caps AND more stash space!
---
I wonder what happens if you sell something that puts you over the cap limit?
---
Currently, Patch 9 will bring projectile visual effects back to plasma weapons.
---
  After additional considerations, that's where the scrip thing may come in.  
---
It may be a 40# legendary (like the bayoneted triple tube missle launcher), but if, as the BGS post implies, you get a fixed amount of scrips per legendary star for the item, then setting stupid high price doesn't protect you from the item being sold - because it wont let you set the stupid high price to begin with.
---
If that were the case, then caps are removed from the player legendary vending equation.   
---
You'd still make caps from non-legendary weapons and other items though.
---
fixed ratio scrips for stars is a form of price control, and pretty much eliminates outside the game "real money" markets (ala ebay.)  
---
Going to be interesting to see how the two (legendary and player) vending systems work in reality.
---
I had it work with an event one but like many of the kill x style challenges you need to strike the killing blow for it to count as your kill. Which can be a bit of a challenge given how hectic the event can be.
---
I think Bethesda still would like players to group up and trade over the vending machine being used. I think like it was said above the idea is to create a caps sink as the legendary machine is designed to reduce the number of open legendaries on the server.
---
This sub is going to get real quiet in the next 30 days.
---
Theres only two that are silver that I know of. One is in the atom shop right now with blue symbols on it. The other silver one was the excavator paint job from a couple weeks ago.
---
The fact that there was a very popular mod for F4 that was simply *No More Floating Razorgrain* should have been enough of a clue for Bethesda.
---
I found 2 good weapons (that I still have and use to this day) from paper bags, one in Watoga the other in the Whitesprings. The first was a 3* Max level Bolstering bat with 40% power attack damage (why would anybody ever get rid of this?). The second was a 2* Furious Western Revolver. It packs a wallop, but I barely ever have ammo for it so it's more reserved as an emergency weapon for me
---
Mine was in the corpse, so I don't think it's world loot?
---
haha exactly i probably sold or dropped 500,000 caps worth of good stuff and never knew but i bet kids came by to pick up my poop sack and hit the lottery
---
but the seller would also need alts just to hold all of those caps, making the whole process a jumbled mess. Also, the 120k caps is max caps for 4.8 characters on 1 account. so the buyer and seller would have to make and empty out 5 accounts to trade 1 weapon.
---
I'd suggest finding a spot you know where it should be and just server hop. I used a few different spots before getting tired of looking naturally and server hopped Wavy Willard's until the tourist was there.
---
Could've sworn that I've been hurt by my own punji boards at my camp, to the point that I just don't use them anymore. I could be mistaken though.
---
Every week Bethesda website has inside the vault. Basically since the beginning of the game. Even on weeks they dont do content updates they still do inside the vaults.
---
Ok. Replace ‚Äúbroken‚Äù with ‚Äúnot implemented as well as it could be‚Äù or ‚Äúnot thought out to the fullest extent‚Äù or ‚Äúnot able to adequately handle all of the new stuff they are throwing at it‚Äù.
---
I started to write my opinion several times here, but after reading through the replies, I have nothing new to add to what has already been proposed by others.  I do want to add two things.   Personally, I feel that Workshops need to be contested in Adventure simply because they are a server wide resource and no player should control one any longer than they can actually hold one.  Secondly, even if nothing gets done here at all by Bethesda to address the main topic or if they even see it as an issue, Workshop PVP needs to be restricted to the Workshop area and all team members should be required to be in that area during conflict.  If this rule or something similar isn't implemented, then it leaves a very large exploit for the camp smashing scum to continue to harass players after the no camp damage update kicks in.  All it takes, as I understand it right, now is to be hostile towards someone to be able to wreck their camp. This won't affect players unless they claim a Workshop, but it is unfair, IMO to claim a Workshop and have to worry about some griefing douchenozzles on the buddy system claiming a Workshop just to trash your camp.  I guarantee that's exactly what these little shits will do if given the opportunity.  I hope they close that little exploit up even if that's all they try to fix about the Workshop PVP system.
---
*Free States has entered the chat*
---
Probably not, if only because I would assume they'd bring back the Overseer in the Fall for Wastelanders.
---
&gt;!also the lines for the Purveyor in the game's files are just differently pitched mole miner noises, not actual lines. !&lt;
---
Where have I denounced them? I'm denouncing your idea that ore mining/smelting is a waste. 
---
I have about 6 accounts, usually to store the nice stuff people trade us for steel and/or ammo, as well as the extra caps.
---
If you wanted to buy a full set of sent or cav armor, you wouldn't have enough caps to do so. It'd take you multiple days to obtain a full set. How is that more efficient than someone who could buy a full set in 5 min?
---
Nope, don't bother answering. You're always right and there's absolutely no way someone has a better way of doing things.
---
the seller must be an idiot imo. He would need 5 characters just to accept all of those caps with the current limit. and the buyer would also need 5 characters maxed with caps just to buy it. and yes, can you please send a screen shot, i am very curious
---
So yeah.. how set in stone is that?  I am sure many folks would be willing to sell / buy "scrip" for caps.
---
YES! And consume your cranberry juice! And Leadership bobbleheads! 
---
Also, the mothman events are pretty easy for a new player looking for an XP boost. When I was a low level I ran that event almost everyday. Still do when I see it pop up.
---
You mean ESO guild leaders do with the leftovers from the Trader bid.  
---
ESO does not have a guildhall system, it has a creatively manipulated personal housing system to 'fake' guildhalls.  
---
Good idea though.
---
Good news! According to the release, when you build a vending machine, it will show your camp's location on the map. So no need to move. People will just have to make the long hike to your store.
---
So your PhD is economics?
---
South of the Watoga I‚Äôve always found (either dead or alive, yes) a king running around the broken houses, and the queen spawning in the pond. And it‚Äôs usually just a matter of time (without dealing any damage to the queen) for the spawns to appear. If it‚Äôs a week challenge, I hope my comment will perhaps help you get it done with your friends.
---
And yeah me neither, that alpha Deathclaw did not show up, I killed approximately 18 if I remember correctly how many runs I did. I was really frustrated! I don‚Äôt like to kill so many Deathclaws, I‚Äôm afraid people will come later and be disappointed to find a dead Deathclaw...
---
Thanks for the response and I feel you on the subject of the wanted system. Server hopping if so heavily tied to end game right now I just don‚Äôt see how they will make it less appealing without doing something drastic
---
I knew I saved nbn this guy for a reason.

I suspect you're right; that no amount of scrip will allow you to add \*'s, but I would like to see it since that would reinvigorate crafting weapons and armor.

Plot Twist: (and minor spoilers for those of y'all that haven't found the relevant location/holotape)
---
During the incident where the Overseer was attacked by a Mole Miner, she collapses and is on the brink of death.

Something comes over the attacking Miner and it has a change of heart, takes her to the underground mines or wherever they're located, and saves her in the only way Miners know - by turning her into a Miner herself.
---
This became the Purveyor.
---
(all speculation of course no one knows who she is lol)
---
It‚Äôs a tough one. Part of me welcomes some mod moderating on Bethesda‚Äôs part as it‚Äôs going to be very different from fallout 4. The mods need to be stable for multiplayer and not put too much stress on the servers. For that reason it might end up being very limited. I‚Äôd love nothing more than to play this game in a hardcore survival mode but we will just have to wait and see. Who knows? Maybe nuclear winter will be the real survival mode?
---
(1) It's more of a convenience fee. Preventing you from sitting on Reddit/Discord all day (at times) just to try to sell stuff.  
---
(2) It gets rid of 10% of the caps in-game per transaction which will help the economy out by making caps have actual value. (People already have 25,000 caps on each of their 5 allowed characters)
---
If its a % fee i guess i could see it existing so that players dont overcharge.
---
Something simple might cost 100 so thats 10 cap fee but if they try to charge 1000 then its a 100 cap fee.
---
Might be totally wrong though as i havent read much on the new stuff coming soon
---
I did reply but it went as a main comment for some reason. 1) area chat was on so. Mouth breathers and munchers I can hear they aren't afk 2) when the event finishes they're still there on the map and leave shortly after... Funny that You're telling me I don't play or whatever, however there are several people in this thread who have had exactly the same thing. So I'm going with you're just lucky you haven't had lazy players. Not arguing with one person who seems to want to try and  say I'm not a player but a troll.. Yeah OK then. Tbh I like fo76 wouldn't play it if I didn't there's not alot I'd bitch about, but annoyed me not once but twice in one session it happened with two different players. But hey ho crack on
---
What I'm wondering is value.
---
Will scrapping a Three Star item be worth the same amount of Scrip as scrapping 3 One star items? For lugging things around, are you better off holding onto a Three star Sledgehammer, or 3 one Star Golf Clubs?
---
Just a cap sink. Trying to make caps more valuable. Same as the encrypted event
---
Ah okay this makes a lot of sense. Thank you!
---
So by "consequences" you just meant the stuff can be taken back? If so, I guess that's fair enough. It certainly seemed that you were implying it was a criminal act to unknowingly purchase stolen goods.
---
PS: You're the cute one you silly little chuckle fuck.
---
Yeah wise mothman is a great event as you get xp boost from that too
---
Oh..... now I know.
---
Parts, gotta skin each piece separately
---
You monster
---
Hunger and Thirst meter go back to normal
---
I have never once had this happen. So it must be PC. But this is a shitpost. You probably accidentally dropped it or sold it. One gun doesnt randomly disappear, and why would it have to be your favorite most valuable gun? Wouldnt the odds be astronomical compared to all of the potential items you have In your inventory?
---
 This guy is a god
---
1) You sell legendaries. **Check**
---
2) You get tokens from selling legendaries **Check**
---
3) You will roll and customize for the legendar"ies" you want. **YOU ALL ASSUMED**
---
Ding Dong Ditch! Appalachia style! üòÇ ...I am sorry though, that‚Äôs yucky!
---
Goo/ash piles were fixed quite a while ago.
---
Odd Thomas, love them booksüëçüèª If I had gold this is where you'd get it
---
You most likely have to be the last one to get the final shot making it your ‚Äúkill‚Äù. There was a sheepsquatch as a random encounter during the event and I didn‚Äôt get it either and then I didn‚Äôt get it once I killed him again for the event. That‚Äôs because I wasn‚Äôt the last hit.
---
exactly this... and the variance in value of selling it through my vending machine or trading it in for script. It'll be a formula that the community will eventually figure out.
---
But they seem to seek out other forms of controversy
---
I remember the days when our stash limit was 400... 
---
How the hell did we even manage???
---
Awesome, thank you! I‚Äôll be on until 4:50 EST today and then I gotta head to work
---
meh. now i need to give all stored legendaries from my twink to my main before i start trading it
---
Such a weak excuse. Its not user error.
---
Sprinting in ass/cav armor, killed instantly isnt user error. When that is the same result as no armor at all you are dealing with broken game mechanics. How do you explain that? What does sneaking have to do with this?
---
GT XxxJewBoy79
---
But he spoke in plain english and the first two points of the system are still true, while the third isn't. How is that assuming when literally 2/3 of the system is exactly what he said, and you're saying people are ASSUMING based on the words the lead person on the project said? What?
---
I am not seeing the blue symbol one....if you're at the shop screen, could you tell me the name?
---
To help keep the economy stable lmao
---
If you're on later ill shoot you a message when I'm off work and logged in
---
I‚Äôd stick with ‚Äúlight‚Äù, imo. It‚Äôs nowhere near the weight difference you get on weapons (on some armor it might only be a 1lb difference) and Ultralight has very expensive materiald
---
what is this 10% fee nonsense? didnt april fools already happen?
---
PS4 here and I build in my girlfriends camps all the time.  Just have to be in a group and on their friends list.  Sucks you use their budget but we have little fun building battles and stuff all the time.  It's kinda cool honestly.
---
Edit: my gf has had many camps, I do not have many gfs XD
---
That was my thought as well. No way am I putting my camp on the map if some survival server wash out can level it because he's bored.
---
Or the actual weapons as dlc
---
People won't pay "nice stuff" for steel or ammo on PC. Caps, that's it. Caps can't buy sent or cav armor on PC (nor can ammo or caps), it's strictly weapon/armor trades only. I do realize it's different on console though - I've seen plenty of good weapons traded for 25K+ caps on the forums for PS4 / Xbox.
---
I wouldn't buy cav or sent gear for caps even if I could though, because I have no interest in pvp.
---
You've made a lot of mistakes in this thread and shown your lack of knowledge. You also keep moving the goal posts. First it was 800-1000 steel, then it was 8,000-10,000, then it was 400K. Now you're telling me you have 6 accounts filled with godly AAE, AA25, BE, B25, sent and cav gear, etc. You've made up a lot of bullshit in this thread to save face. I'm done talking to you.
---
Yup. Just for shits and giggles I made my X01 Emergency Protocols Torso the Patriot paint scheme, and the rest of pieces are Nuka Quantum. You can go a different scheme on all 5 pieces if you wish.
---
No, they're for sure glitched in this game, I know how to use them from playing FO4.
---
Ahh man, this would be really unfortunate. I hope it's a random selection of legendaries each time you open the dialogue, or some shit like that. It would suck it we all got the same ones.
---
I'll take an image for u give me 2 min
---
I just remembered the name: "Path to Enlightenment" at the Landview Lighthouse. 
---
I think you can spawn the event just by traveling there like Line in the Sand, but not sure...
---
Tibia had/has a system where when you engaged in PvP your character would get locked for 10-15 minutes, and couldn't disconnect, even if you alt+f4 it would stay online and could be killed. I feel like this is a necessary change. 
---
Almost daily we see posts here complaining someone got his camp destroyed and the offender server hopped, that happened to me already and when I went to fight the dude, he just disconnected, leaving me salty ASF. I have no problem with pvp in adventure mode, I think it adds to the sense of danger, but not being allowed to fight back is what makes me mad...
---
Server hopping is the big villain in this game, although it's 'necessary' sometimes (tourist camera I'm looking at you!). I think that it also plays a role in server stability, but can't confirm.
---
Oh, I don't doubt it. The cap of 5K a trade and 25K are very little, though I could see why that's the limit due to space. 120K for a single item? Pretty steep. It's becoming like the CS:GO/PUBG Skins for hundreds of dollars all over again.
---
Not I and I can‚Äôt find anything out from Bethesda about it.
---
came to post this same thing, is it a bad joke? isnt april fools already over?
---
i honestly cant believe Bethesda is doing this
---
so whatever price you want for selling something, just increase the price 10%
---
if anything Bethesda is screwing over the players who BUY things, as everyone will now increase prices by 10%
---
The big draw of the queen used to be the (rare!) chance she‚Äôd drop Mutation recipes. Now that that‚Äôs been replaced with jetpack recipes (as far as I understand), she really has no appeal for most high-end players.
---
They are talking about the random spawned real sheepsquatch, not the imposter. So if anyone shows up, it's just luck.
---
This is the nichest issue I've ever seen
---
Hatchlings are spawn. Same difference.
---
I cant believe it was 400 once.
---
My name and title would be "Papa Woody, theoretical degree in physics"
---
well honestly i 100% quit if this is the case. Friends already all uninstalled permanently.
---
The ultimate weapon!
---
Thanks, that increases the appeal for sure.  I just want that skull mask on my nukashine armor when the next one comes out heh
---
Awesome, man. Thank you so much for the response and info.
---
You don‚Äôt even need 2 computers. I run dual clients on the same desktop every time I play, for perk sharing, fast travel, and activating Strange in Numbers and Herd Mentality.
---
Just get incisor and the weapon swing speed maxed and that'll work for pretty much every mob. Maybe max pain trainif your on PA and just use the melee to clean up what you knock down
---
From reading all of the comments on here, it makes sense. Bethesda is just trying to make sure that caps don‚Äôt lose their value. It‚Äôs also a convenience fee. This isn‚Äôt anything that Bethesda is doing, because really it doesn‚Äôt benefit them at all to screw us over in this way. It‚Äôs just to make sure that the caps, which is basically the only currency in this game that is actively tracked, doesn‚Äôt lose value.
---
i cant believe they didnt do this? am i dreaming right now?
---
Eh, without hard numbers I‚Äôm hesitant to believe this.  I have a BE DB and a BE Pump.  To me the pump is superior in damage and spread.  I suspect it‚Äôs what someone else listed on this thread already.  Each of the shotguns pellets do the listed 20% explosive damage.   Which then equates to the likes of 180% additional damage if all pellets hit.  I believe they want to bring it inline with all other guns, a straight 20% damage increase.  Gonna be a giant no bueno.
---
That'd be cool! What would you have to achieve in-game for you to receive that title? :D
---
IMO my explosive pump felt too weak after the first patch for explosive weapons. I haven‚Äôt tried it out in Survival mode or against other players so idk how they do for that avenue. When I‚Äôm going up against enemies they soak them bullets up
---
i bet they have angry grunting mole-sex
---
When you play on a team, it's not hard to get these things. Feel free to come on XB1 if you'd live to be proven wrong.
---
We know you don't like being shown you're wrong. There's absolutely no reason you couldn't do both ores and scrapping guns/armor for mats, and you've yet to provide any reasonable excuse for why that would be a waste.
---
Nope, it's only "I'm right, there's no way to do something better"
---
Get a grip LOL
---
It‚Äôs so I can justify my 15% markup!
---
Thank you for the reply! Much appreciated.
---
For a second I thought you had also named your character "Cheekbones."
---
That would absolutely happen
---
The economy would crash.
---
A lot of players would be mad because they spent 150K+ on their armor before there was even a mention of this vendor.
---
Nah man, it wasn't mind.  I was just kiddin' around.  Kind of you though!
---
It should definitely be increased
---
And i'll just quit, because it will never be amazing let alone perfect gear without server hopping thousands of times. Friends already gave up on the game because of these repeated disappointments and i'm getting there too. Legendary vendor was the last hope and collecting legendaries for it is the only reason i've played in the past month.
---
I bought them. Like the other poster said it's pretty dim and half the bulbs are burnt. So if that's a look you're going for, then  it works. Personally I love them because I built an old dilapidated cult church and it fits the aesthetic well. Neon letters wouldn't have worked as well.
---
Ok these arent my images, but the bottom.one is the excavator chrome skin
---
https://imgur.com/a/WpqSw4w
---
And this is in the shop now as nukashine 
---
https://imgur.com/a/mjC7HsI
---
Agreed. If that's the case i doubt player vending will be as big as was originally expected. Most people will probably stick to subreddits for buying and selling with 0% fee.
---
well the other thing it doesn't seem to care about is level.  I have been buying any low level 3 stars since they announced their plan and you often see those.  I wasn't sure if they would factor what you got in the Scrip as number of stars and levels, or just stars.  I took a chance they would ignore levels, so those are cheaper and give you equal credit, which is cool.  I thought armor would be different type of scrip to make you have to collect both, so I am still not sure by the announcement if it is just one big pool to use?  Thoughts on one big pool, versus an Armor vs. weapons pool?
---
I think having vending be the link is perfect. Not everyone wants to vend and some people will want to keep their little slice of Appalachia to themselves.
---
Seems good to me as they are planning.
---
What am i going to do with all the extra space now? I hope to not crash the servers with the 100's of tons of lego's i am trading in!
---
No it sure isn't but it is possible!
---
A degree in physics, theoretically.
---
To counter act this loot issue.. All Nuke zones should be "Double XP"!! I enjoy my 3 star legendary bloodied Baton like the next waste lander but come on :) seriously double xp the nuke zones!
---
Probably just launching a nuke
---
This is why all of my CAMP doors have a keypad on them. Although that really didn‚Äôt stop that one Scorchbeast from getting in.
---
Think of how many nukes are going to start flying at Whitesprings and Harper's Ferry now!
---
I have mine at the top of Seneca Rocks... so I guess no bueno?
---
The 2.5 billion dollar little engine that could.
---
It's possible the legendary vendor moves around like Grahm. Dataminers on the m76 discord already posted she has multiple spawn points. These could all be the abandoned train stations though as shown in the trailer
---
I know, it sucks. Can't believe they went this way. IT'S A MOLE MINER! His name should be Hans!
---
And there is a atom challenge to scrap 76 hats
---
Have a look at today‚Äôs inside the vault ... each vending machine will show up on the map with what‚Äôs for sale
---
I thought the CAMP was invincible when you‚Äôre on pacifist mode?
---
Everybody complains they're worthless so why be upset that they're taking 10% of them
---
I‚Äôve seen it at my close personal friend Resin‚Äôs shop several times and pretty sure sunnytop too.  I think it‚Äôs in the raider vendor cycle.
---
Im still in the mindset that more space wouldnt change anything. People would praise having 1600 stash limit a while, then dump more stuff they dont need into it and a few weeks later threats would pop up asking for even more space.
---
However, i think the stash could use a system where (except for junk) you have slots for weapons and armor, like 50-100, being able to stash away heavier guns without considering their weight would be a big improvment.
---
With upcoming features like vendor machine (to get rid of the better gear you have) and the legendary vendor (to get rid of random 3star gear) the load in your stash should lessen.
---
Raider vendor at White Spring and seen it dropped twice  at General Steakhouse.
---
Player vending and invulnerable camps drop at the same time. They're both in Patch 9.
---
I'm pretty sure they've previously mentioned that they're fixing the camp damage this patch in a previous Inside the Vault article.
---
Rad
---
Thank you! It wasn't either though :/
---
With only one computer you can do the following steps
---
1. login from bethesda launcher and press play 
---
2. Choose character and enter world
---
3. Press alt+Tab to get to desktop
---
4. Go to your fallout dir and launch Fallout76
---
5. Login with your mule account
---
6. Choose character and social tab menu to enter your first chars world.
---
7. Expect lag
---
8. Do your thing
---
I like that, idea! And it's a pretty big feat!
---
It‚Äôs a random spawn, and he‚Äôs meant to be dead. Normally there‚Äôs an albino death claw and scorched around too.
---
Hell yea 
---
Go save Grahm
---
Then get him his suff back 
---
Then you get some random legendary gun or armor but the quest should be rewarding you once a week a legendary and then u can go do the quest agen for a different reward every week
---
In the update thread, people are speculating it's Vivian Garrahan.  That might be an interesting, if somewhat sad, twist.
---
**#1 server stability**
---
This reminds me of Rapture.
---
Now I realize that you were moreso directly answering u/Bobanate's query as to how people normally do it, and that my response was kind of unnecessary.
---
I doubt it due to the theory she becomes the first human NPC for the Wastelanders update.
---
 A good theory I've seen so far is that The Pruveyor is actually Vivian Garrahan, the benevolent CEO of the Garrahan Mining Company (where you go find the Excavator plans from)
---
I‚Äôm so glad they‚Äôre not implementing REROLLING legendary gear 
---
I‚Äôm one of these players.
---
My inventory (not including my stash) is worth at least 350,000-400,000 caps.
---
If people could turn fucking stalkers pool cues into sentinel assassins armor I‚Äôd be pretty frustrated.
---
Almost every game does this
---
Good point, except vendors will build in the fee and charge the consumers just like irl .. so that's 1100 caps for that weapon instead of 1000. The consumer loses, the vendor does not .. but you might be right. it stupid if you ask me, but there is probably a reason.
---
Also used in Fallout 2.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Kokoweef_mine_scrip
---
So you're saying legendaries will only be sold/bought with scrip? Even through normal vendors and other players?
---
There's always some aspect in each update to complain about
---
I was thinking that too. Oh well.
---
Well RIP I just sold my full collection of Bobbleheads to save space for legendary items
---
I think a better arguments are the unique items from the Survival Mode challenges. These are pulling on the collectors stash strings. Especially with these heavy weapons coming.
---
then no matter the stash limit, you'll eventually be where you are today. 800 is fine. Accept it, adapt to it and become it.
---
Where is this stated? I haven't seen that.
---
Like all of the stuff I see in this ITV!
---
One thing I haven't seen many people talking about is the survival changes. I understand the reasoning for them, but I think the "reset score on death" mechanic will be abusable, like it was in the first iteration of survival. Making it only reset on PVP death only is probably necessary, otherwise people will just regularly reset their score by jumping off of high locations so they're never the top 3.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt expect to turn in a nocturnal pool cue and have a chance at ending up with gear that someone paid 100K+ for.
---
That would crush the community.
---
I'm googling but not successfully, there are brotherhood of steel paints that have symbols on them and I believe a tricentenial paint job but that ones mostly red white and blue.
---
Did you get reinstated
---
I remember having to pay for extra naps on l4d and l4d2 what crack are you smoking I'd love some
---
I am struggling to describe it :/
---
It was silver X-01 with symbols like this on it in Cyan:

---
=O=
---
(I don't know how that will format :/)
---
Thanks for all the tips guys, really helpful and appreciated.  I wish I could reset my perks and start again üòÇ
---
Yesss just give all the crops a dirt root base that sinks in the ground. Make fence posts longer and sink into the ground while your at it too.
---
Yea. I‚Äôll still believe it when it‚Äôs out. Last time they waited until the day before to say hey it‚Äôs not coming. But I‚Äôm glad they said that it was due to bugs. They need to complete ideas before releasing them.
---
Why wouldn't it?
---
I thought she somehow became that drill thing - Motherlode I think? That would make sense too though
---
Wow, been playing for about 2 weeks now and have had the exact opposite experience on Xbox. Second day playing some high level guy was able to kill me while I was trading. Everytime I try to take even a single small workshop (like Tyler Dirt Track) the moment I claim it some 150 something pops in and nukes me instantly to take whatever little junk I have. Every random that has found my Camp immediately starts breaking everything in sight.
---
Same here. And I am having difficulty with what search terms to use :/
---
Player vending just won't work without your camp being a map marker, but your camp being a map marker won't work without removing camp damage.
---
They said what they are doing, they are trying to remove caps from the economy. Plain, and simple. Same thing with the vendor, they are trying to remove items from the game. The same reason we have a stash limit, and character limit. 
---
I imagine hosting a game like this isn't going to generate a ton of income, especially when you need to pay to maintenance it, upgrade, bug fix, and add content. Which also costs money. So with the cost of paying people do those things, and server costs it becomes a money sink. Shocking news to the gaming community, online games need servers, and that costs a lot of money. Even more shocking the more items that need to be tracked, the more stress you put of the servers, as well as the storing that information, plus the new items created every second the game is running. That data builds fast, thus costing more money. 
---
The game doesn't have a set number of items ever, but you can't just let players horde, and fill all their ults, and have a crazy stash limit, that costs money. You need to remove some these things to keep servers running good, as well as not to spend more in running the game, than you make. Which at this point I imagine is what is going on, this game is more of a money sink. They already lost sale before game even game out, and its mmo styled Fallout, with no subscription, no paid DLC. While still fixing, and adding. I doubt they sell enough atoms to covers all these costs. So them trying to remove caps, and items from the game is perfectly fair, since as time goes on it will only be more costly in server costs to not remove them. 
---
Tl;dr Servers are expensive, as well as having too much data becomes costly, and taxing on the server. The cap tax/removal, and item removal are to keep servers running a bit better, and to make the game last a bit longer. The tax is for the health of the game.
---
Players: hey Bethesda, server hoping as a gating mechanic is lame as hell.
---
Bethesda:  introducing the purveyor, so you can server hop until you finally see that legendary you want.
---
Would much prefer a reroll system on individual stars and and the ability to upgrade low level items to high level.  This is our time to say what we want out of this vendor in reason.  If you do your permutation math then a vendor stocking random 3* rares is likely going to be a long road to your personal god rolls just on server hops alone.
---
Will do üëç
---
Depending where I am and how pressed I am for time I either drop my excess legendary items either in the Artisan's Corner (the shop with the crafting stations) or in the ice cream cooler by the golf club. Usually 20+ legendaries after a few hours of grinding. I always hope someone who appreciate them will find them!
---
They could leave the nukashine armor paint it's only black
---
Except that there are plenty of people out there who want absolutely nothing to do with PVP, don't want to have to rebuild any of their C.A.M.P., and really hate losing caps because you would rather have "better rewards" in Adventure mode. It takes literally three seconds to verbally ask someone if they want PVP, without having to take any damage from you whatsoever. Also, taking advantage of someone's mutation (that they may have not even gotten for PVP, but for PVE). 
---
Also, no one should HAVE to hop servers because you think you're entitled to PVP in a (now mostly) PVE mode. If you don't want to use a melee build in Survival, fine. But stop using it on players in Adventure who are just minding their own business. It isn't cool.
---
we have to see, this might be better at the end of the day.
---
It makes about as much sense as paying caps to fast travel. Who am I paying this to?
---
What is the betting that scrip become the new currency? "H: 1000 Scrip  W: 100 caps each"
---
I once had this experience when I was lvl 20 at Silva homestead, but with orbital strikes, he was over 1k caps I think
---
Dam right I will haha
---
Very true. It would be cool if you could just display it in camp with a fusion core and everything ready to go, and if you buy it, it unlocks and you can enter it.
---
No. They're single use items, and have to be either i  your stash, or inventory.
---
Well, of course.
---
Controversy = buzz.
---
The wrong type of controversy is a death sentence.
---
Yeah that's the one, not sure about how the event spawns though. I've always joined it once it spawns.
---
Have u been reinstated
---
where's the likely spawns at? i can easily solo one
---
Cheers dude üëç
---
u/Valseek: so are our CAMPS going to be immune from player damage with player vending?
---
I agree. Also another 200lbs stash space for those items that i will move from mule to main to being sold. And also they could fix some bugs and make better ui so you don't scrap costumes, oh i am still mad. Hah
---
Yes, the ability to load holotape games into arcade style cabinets would be awesome.
---
Also port the earlier holotape games into 76 as well
---
Any word yet
---
All my item prices now have an added 10% surcharge to cover the cost of a 10% fee
---
A lot of players would be mad if you could buy legendary traits by turning in shitty legendaries because they spent 150K+ on their armor before there was even a mention of this vendor.
---
There is no way you should be able to turn in a nocturnal pool cue 75 times and have a piece of armor I spent 100k+ on.
---
Just no way.
---
That would cause the entire hardcore community to quit.
---
No worries I'm the weirdo who does Desktop + Laptop XD
---
Oh I don't have issues killing them I just usually go to farm spots where you can just pop in and go right to the legendary kill it and then server hop. I'm level 180 so I don't really care about XP at this point
---
See.  That's the point that doesn't make sense to even have a 10% surcharge.  It doesn't "remove caps" as was previously suggested.  All it will do is increase the prices that people are charging so they can get that 10% anyways.  So if that's the case, it makes sense to have an actual reason to have that charge.  This will not remove caps from the economy.
---
&gt; ) I have all of them
---
The Black Rider one hasn't been released yet.  How do you have it?
---
The perveyor sounds interesting, though I'm a bit worried it will have an RNG inventory.  This would probably quickly devolve into server hopping to try to get something good to spawn in her inventory which imo is not a good or compelling game mechanic.  
---
Hopefully I'm incorrect.  In a perfect world you could "make your own" legendary with enough Scrip.or have some way to narrow down the available options at least based on the perks you have equipped.    
---
So like if you have 9 ranks in rifleman, you have a high chance at rifles in the perveyors inventory.  9 ranks in melee it will mostly be melee weapons, etc.  5 ranks in demolitions = high chance at explosive, tons of "low health" related perks = high chance of bloodied, tons of addictions = high chance of junkies, etc.
---
Watoga was never my favorite for legendary drops, so I'm liking it even better now, not a bunch of other players gathering the Dog Food &amp; Nuka Cola I go there for.
---
I'm sooo damn glad this is being introduced in advance - my stash is looking pretty darn full rn.
---
The pump has the best explosive spread of them all, followed by the DB then the Combat.  Regardless of what‚Äôs listed on the pipboy screen.  Testing the spread on the side of a building works best.  The pump with explosive is a beast mid to long range... was a beast? Who knows after Tuesday patch.
---
NNE right up the top. There's a fissure just S of it from memory.
---
Which is why I'm holding on to a set amount of caps. I'd like the nukashine one and i could afford it and the one horseman I want.... but I'm giving up on nukashine just in case blackbird comes back... I'd kick myself if I couldn't afford it again :(. And Bethesda is making sure I won't buy caps (it's my choice but I absolutely refuse to spend money on microtransactions that are not cosmetic only... and no, saying for convenience doesn't make it any better, it's still the same problem as pay to win mts... it encourages bad game design).
---
Hahaha no.
---
With all due respect, what is there about "friendly creature wearing a heavy trench coat and a gas mask" that indicates the Purveyor's gender? I daresay I'll get downvoted for this, but I genuinely don't follow your line of thinking.
---
Yup. My inner hoarder makes me grab every stimpack I see. Even with Perks, I'm carrying 30lbs of those dumb things right now. No room in the stash to offload. Given the opportunity, I'd drop them in the vending machine and price them at 1000 caps apiece, knowing they'd be forever safe from someone else buying them. Vending machine would just be stash mark II to me.
---
Same thing happened to me last night. Two code pieces on one scorched officer. I picked them both up and every time I fast travel somewhere it pops up on the screen like I just picked it up for the first time.
---
Will the Legendary Scrip have weight?  I think the mining Tokens from Lode Bearing weigh 0.1 each, that stacks up quick.
---
Will there be a Legendary Exchange machine inside the Whitesprings shopping mall, or will we have to go to the station there?  It's not far, but the mall already has everything else so it just makes sense it should have one of these too.
---
Even better, they spawn in behind you , you cant see then but you still take rad damage and get diseased.....
---
I really hope not.
---
I see you're a man of culture as well. You have Razorgrain and Corn growing to replenish that Whiskey as well?
---
Hahaha okay
---
I will just be happy i can finally unburden my 9 mules with their stuff!
---
I think, personally... that armour and weapons should require "in game/ physical" racking and display. If you can't fit on your walls, you can't have it. 
---
1) it would drive the hunt for plans and mats.
---
2) it would limit collection of armour and weapons to Camp size, which would grow organically as characters level up.
---
But, raising the limit to some arbitrary limit would simply result in players hitting that limit right away, and then THAT would become the new "too small". A small stash is a good game mechanic.
---
I‚Äôm new to the fo76 Reddit community, could you link one of these trading subreddits?
---
Repeat after me. Inside the Vault Newsletters are not comprehensive patch notes.
---
10% of everything you sell will always be removed from the economy.  There will just be more removed with the higher prices.  Once I raise on my prices 10% I don't really care if they take money and delete it from the game. I'm still getting my price it just hurts the consumer.
---
And if you can turn in your five 3* stalkers pool cues and get armor that I grinder out 100K for I‚Äôll quit.
---
No one is gonna be happy here. You want high-value viable items for a nominal amount of effort.
---
I want my high value items to retain their value because I put a substantial amount of effort into grinding for them before any mention of the vendor.
---
their loss I would say.
---
As long as people don't ruin my own fun with toxic behavior they can be afk, I don't care actually.
---
They want there to be incentive for players to still trade FTF so that every player camp shop doesn't become vending only and reduce player interaction.
---
My SPECIAL is (give or take) 15, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 8.

Pay attention to what you're scrapping?

This! Soil floors could come in addition to this, I'm tired of coming to my camp only to see my Brahmin and crops killed by invaders
---
So far I've only ever gotten a queen there (well ever since the challenge anyways).
---
Riiiiiiiiight. Judging by your shittiness in this thread, I highly doubt it.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt believe AAA refers to the amount of staff they have, while Bethesda May have a much smaller employee count they‚Äôre definitely one of the giants of the industry.
---
Bethesda flat-out says it's a she in today's ITV
---
Thus my post since that was pretty unexpected
---
The elite club already exists, and if you deal in caps, you‚Äôre not part of it lol
---
The Spread on SGs is affected dramatically by Aiming vs Hip Fired (Vats is the same as aiming), So my Combat SGs have much better Accuracy &amp; Spread than the Pumps, But the Double Barrel has by far much more Power, I have an Instigating Explosive version of all 3.
---
A little of everything. Usually there's a 3* somewhere along that route.  The Sheepsquach sometimes shows up.
---
Its confirmed in the recent ITV, I suppose It was also assumed since most coal miners are men.
---
Pretty much all heavy guns eat ammo like crazy, so you'll want ammo smith 3, erm the stabiliser perk increases accuracy and negates something else.. can't remember off the top of my head. Bear arms will reduce heavy weapon weight. Bandolier reduces ballistic ammo weight I think too. The 50cal is a lot of fun, I usually use that or the plasma gatling (I've got a 3* explosive legendary one though, don't think they drop anymore and I'm not sure what the regular ones are like).
---
Absolutely. My stash is overflowing with Grape Mentats.
---
Isn't the standard ( not prototype ) x-01 silver? Nobody really uses it so it's kind of rare.
---
They said "large areas" for " community building" I'm guessing white springs greens?
---
The alpha deathclaw challenge falls into that almost impossible. Especially if you are not the right level for them to spawn (after all I'm pretty sure the game takes into account your level on which ones to spawn... so instead you have to hope the right level person gets there right before you and either you get there soon after or the body doesn't decay before you get there).
---
I mean, comparing the two it's not like either comes out looking good. Like if I'm in a car with a guy who's screaming about aliens and covered in shit people will probably avoid both of us.

I don‚Äôt.  I‚Äôd like to turn in say 5 3 star junk legendaries to reroll (or add) the third star of an existing piece.  Maybe the roll beats what I have, maybe I take a crack at it 5 more 3*legendaries down the road.
---
I don‚Äôt like the idea of a vendor selling legendaries because the amount of item and effect permutations in this game is nuts.  We‚Äôre likely going to end up with a server hopping ‚Äúmechanic‚Äù that makes x-01 jet packs seem a walk in the park.
---
Theuve already said its some sort of token
---
This is genius lmao
---
All science perks unlocked, and Nike launched while they are equipped.
---
Really? That‚Äôs a shame. I was kind of hoping trade war interactions to take place.
---
I tried to forward them and i was told by the system i need a wired connection, which is why i suspect that the forwarding may not even matter if i unplug the connection and go back to wireless like i currently have.
---
the ports are; 
---
&gt;TCP: 80
---
&gt;TCP: 443
---
&gt;UDP: 3000-3010
---
As per a few month old support email from bethesda. They said there was connection loss reading in my system files, or w/e the diagnostic data you gotta send with your tickets is called. Then they told me to check if those ports were forwarded.
---
Sorry, I mean that I have all the ones that have been made available so far :)
---
Apologies for confusion.
---
What I meant was that it's not any of the Horseman skins, and it's certainly live, because the question came from seeing someone in it.
---
Server hopping is also entirely optional
---
r/HornetGaming93
---
This is actually really good advice, I'll try this!
---
Max Headroom vibes
---
I will definitely concur I'd rather no challenge at all rather than ones that just rely on complete luck of the draw to complete (hey, let's see if you can find an alpha deathclaw... ie hope the game spawns one for you and hope you are near the level you need for one to spawn).
---
You can take the positive out of this...they bagged it up for ya! On a serious note, this it great...lol
---
I thought I was the only one having the issue with crashing!
---
Make a friend on the server. Place your items in a world stash. Switch characters and re-join your buddy's server. Your stuff *should* be in the world stash you left it in.
---
Not 100% guaranteed, but usually works. That's why you are sending stuff you don't use but might want some day, not your 3* supersledge.
---
Even if someone on charge says "we're going to do X" or "we're planning on doing Y" doesn't mean that's etched in stone. They aren't taking a blood oath. They're telling you want they know*at that time*. 
---
Things change.
---
I don't know if the argument "I had to work really hard to get where I'm at and so should you" holds water for me, mostly because I don't care if another player can get the same high-level shit I'm rocking for way less effort. As a matter of fact, I think it would probably make me appreciate my stuff *even more* because I remember every bit of effort that went into collecting it.
---
Ultimately, I want new players to have it easier than I did.
---
&gt;If people could turn fucking stalkers pool cues into sentinel assassins armor I‚Äôd be pretty frustrated.
---
I mean, that's not how people generally expect rerolling to work, more like the base item stays the same and the legendary effects change. But yeah, turning garbage into gold in that fashion would obviate a lot of endgame content.
---
I‚Äôd be okay with rerolling provided that you:
---
A: could only reroll all 3 perks at once with no controls
---
B: were locked into only rerolling one perk on each armor or weapon
---
I think it‚Äôs going to be one big pool. When creatures drop stuff they never differentiate an armor feral ghoul and a weapon feral ghoul, so the value should be interchangeable. You‚Äôre right they didn‚Äôt even mention level so it shouldn‚Äôt be a factor here. Just go ahead and collect as many garbage Legendaries as you can and laugh all your way to the bank when the purveyor goes live üëå
---
It is, but it's quite dull, and has yellow. The one I saw was bright, and had green/blue symbols on the chest (maybe legs etc too, but I noted the chest part).
---
Looks lije somthing out of minecraft.
---
This does require buying the game twice, right?
---
Survival mode being a glorified deathmatch mode, the camera that was delayed causing you to go flying, the various C.A.M.P features that didn't work at first, etc
---
The list goes on. This chart isn't inaccurate by any means
---
There‚Äôs also a different drum in the wild we can‚Äôt build in camp, like the mouth harp.
---
Unless you pop in with an open area mic saying "wait for meeeee", 90% of the time I'm up to my ears in enemies and I've got tunnel vision trying to protect the brahmin.  I'm more than happy to share a legendary kill, but most of the time I can't see someone coming in late.  I had a cool pair of gentlemen pop in during the walk today, asked them if they'd clear out the farm while I kept herding the brahmin, and it was a good, smooth experience.  They actually took care of the brahmin when the bloodbugs started spawning in, then focused on the squatch.
---
I usually just drop the plans, sheepsquatch parts and 1\* gear I get anyways.  Late comers are welcome to have it.  
---
I did get a 1\* anti-armor handmade rifle yesterday, and I did keep that for selling in my vending machine next week.
---
That sounds like a " you" problem.
---
Haha, sorry for laughing, but if pacifist is still an option in survival, that is very stupid.
---
OK?
---
I would like to think that instead of rolling her own (legendaries) she'll re-sell the ones we junk for scrip. So instead of hopping vendor to vendor to vendor on the off chance someone unloaded something we might want they'll all be centrally located in Berkeley Springs with maybe a few at the vendors 'cuz I'm sure that after a while there'll be folks who'd rather have the caps than the scrip.
---
Also while I'm thinking about it: I'm curious if the legendary::scrip relationship is affected by the same Hard Bargain/Grape Mentats/+CHR buffs &amp; perks or if it's all based on \*\*'s only.  Also: is my 3\* level 20 bloodied knuckles worth more in scrip than my level 50 1\* LMG. Cuz if so: dumb, but w/e.
---
At least it‚Äôs not an Atom fee üòÖ
---
We see what your real focus is haha. I think it'd be awesome if they had a factory that you could fix and it just creates dog food all day. Now that would be something to own
---
I have only seen him at the lighthouse quest.
---
The "Don't tell my wife comment" referred to the fact that I bought atoms to make sure I can buy all 4 horsemen :P
---
If fixing bugs makes it dead then you were just relying on an op weapon
---
Thank you for stating this. I‚Äôm a ‚Äúfilthy level 70 casual‚Äù, Sure the game had problems on release that needed to be addressed, but if you want some sense of satisfaction in your gaming life, be happy with what‚Äôs at hand. They (Bethesda) have a plan, and balance is a part of the plan.
---
nope is was not mentioned (i really hope they will add camp immunity or grief will destroy every shop)
---
You turn in a stalkers pool cue, get the scrip, then reroll your ‚Äúexterminators heavy combat left arm with lockpocking and under water breathing‚Äù into a sentinel assassins heavy combat left arm. 
---
That‚Äôs what I meant.
---
I disagree with your argument about making it easier for other players because then you can ‚Äúremember the hard work‚Äù you put in to get the gear.
---
I think it‚Äôs fundamentally flawed.
---
When people see me walking around with my 3* VE laser rifle and full set of sentinel assassins gear, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúremembering‚Äù required. It‚Äôs right there. 
---
The only reason I have it is because I worked and that‚Äôs apparent.
---
I hope so otherwise it is just grief city
---
I had a tricent, and when power armor edition fell below 120 I got that which came with another tricent edition
---
That's a lot of junk!
---
Goodsprings?
---
I think you misunderstand me. I know she's female, I know that it was confirmed. My question to you is why your initial description of her (see: "friendly creature wearing a heavy trench coat and a gas mask") was what made you assume she was male. That's all I'm curious to understand your thought process on.
---
Is your camp safe from being griefed as long as you‚Äôre in pacifist in this next patch?
---
The first week she‚Äôll be selling Gjallarhorn and people will question if it‚Äôll be worth the scrip.
---
I share those thoughts sometimes, Pete Hines specifically said cosmetic only as well so it‚Äôs a broken promise that has irked a lot of players
---
It certainly isnt because it shouldn't be allowed as survival is literally meant to hurt other players why would I /not/ want to hurt other players
---
What the hell is goodsprings
---
PLAYER VENDING IS FINALLY COMING
---
***#AHHHHHHHHHHHH***
---
Still bugged.  Between that and Mountain Honey, my booze collection is not yet complete.  Been grinding Biv every day and still haven't gotten Mountain Honey, but have several dupes of almost everything else.
---
LMAO, that's amazingly hilarious!!!!! That person is a comedic genius!
---
Raider opportunist tomatoe tomato.. but i will agree with one thing. 
---
Stop eating chips and playing shity music with the mic on!
---
It shouldn't be I had it on because I use a tesla rifle in adventure and it triggers pvp with people who it tags
---
Haha, so I'll just be a big ol bullseye on the map? My pet deathclaw wont stand a chance...
---
Yes ladydevann stated it was yeah.
---
Imo, it would be nice if the travel fee partially went back into the daily Cap pool.
---
I traded a 90% weight with explosive that someone didnt want because back in the tse days. I paid 500 caps lol
---
Yes, they are a smaller company and do try to be very ambitious for the size they have. But... they are still compared with the other big companies and the general public consider them as one of the big ones and they are expected to compare with the other ones (note people keep comparing them to such, in fact Witcher fans keep trying to use their game as the one to beat as that is the one they keep comparing Witcher to, CDPR is more seen as the up and coming newcomer and Bethesda the old guard). As some one says, they are definitely considered one of the giants. Which goes to show how impressive that is honestly.
---
That's a good question, is it a shared pool like Atoms?  Or does each character have it's own purse like caps?
---
i would love to build more permanent towns with my friends!
---
Good, it was needed, especially in survival.
---
Agreed... I don't claim to be a Filthy Casual... I have over 650 hours in the game, but I don't don't grind legendaries, or the SQB or White Springs, I just do the events and spend most of my time making serums, PA mods and Painting PA's for free minus the materials. There's so much to be done, if you just play the game.
---
I‚Äôm assuming this is towards my comment about no communication, I was aiming that at BioWare to clarify any misunderstanding. Bethesda has been very communicative which I and I assume everyone else cherishes
---
Ah, I see now. I was thinking they had it on for some reason. I'm an idiot.
---
I know it was confirmed, I was just wondering about the way the OP framed things. While it's a surprise because most mole miners are considered to be men, the initial post framed it as a sort of "this character is friendly, wears a heavy trench coat and a gas mask, of *course* it's a man!" which is... questionable. 
---
I only wished to know the thought process behind that phrasing, because it reads to me in a very specific way. Hence why I was expecting downvotes, but I guess my comment wasn't particularly clear in what I was trying to say.
---
TODD **LYING FUCKING BASTARD** HOWARD

Will there be power armor displays maybe added next month possibly?
---
If youre on ps4 i can give a 3*deathclaw gauntlet
---
ROFL, I'm not angry at all. I'm actually laughing about this that you completely forgot that the scorched were zombies and are trying to claim proving you wrong about something is somehow meaning I'm mad? That doesn't even make sense. Why would I be mad when I get to prove you wrong after your smug "your argument carry less impact".
---
gotta make the flux from materials you get in nuke zones and then make the ammo using the flux
---
Yup. Glad I picked up a furious handmade the other day though
---
That would honestly make me happy.
---
I don't even have an explosive shotgun. I just saw that massive nerf, and figured that's grounds for a RIP, especially to the price of these weapons.
---
I think your expectations are going to be close to reality, the real purpose is to get some of the thousands of horded weapons out of the game, and this will likely do just that.
---
I do however happen to believe, that there will be true premium weapons available, and hopefully some mods that can be applied to existing Weapons.
---
If people can't get good Items for their existing stuff, they simply won't use it, Bethesda has to know this.
---
So sad, RDO could have been awesome. But of course Rockstar was chasing that GTA money and just kept trying the same thing with it that just didn't work as well with that type game.  Well, at least I was wrong with my original prediction that they'd ruin the SP in favor of focusing on MP. While I still would be shocked if they put any more SP support in they did put out a really good SP game. But they are totally not surprising me with how they are handling RDO :(.
---
A ton of people just have perfect gear from dupers, so rerolling would've been the best way to counter all the BOS Heavy Sentinel Assassins.
---
Proof? I play in America with a European account and In 200 hours I have not had any evidence suggest that I was in a regional server
---
I just had my first intruder in my camp last night and I‚Äôm a little bit traumatized. I did not expect to see a mole rat coming up my stairs üò∞
---
I had the every resource extractor at the Charleston landfill workshop going and I set an alarm for 30 minutes knowing the server would crash so I didn‚Äôt wanna waste my time and supplies. It crashed in 25 minutes... I haven‚Äôt played since. It‚Äôs so upset...
---
Why I love this game.
---
Whoosh
---
Hurried and did free range at southern belle by myself, only one there and got the daily
---
Bought it for 14 bucks, has to be cheaper now.
---
I hope you're also using three ranks of Serendipity in Luck.  While below 30% health, a 45% chance to avoid damage entirely with three ranks.  Three ranks of Dodgy (Ag) will also reduce 30% of incoming damage at the cost of AP.  Low health builds are so strong right now, probably even more durable than running at max health with the proper perk loadout.  Add in an emergency protocols power armor torso mod....an additional 50% damage reduction and +25% speed when below 20% health.  You're basically unkillable in PvE.
---
Why haven‚Äôt we gotten a cap limit increase? With how the economy is god roll armor and weapons often go over one characters cap limit. We should at least be able to carry 50k if nothing else.
---
Happens to my friends sometimes. I do the same to fix it but maybe try switching from status to online to off and then back that may work.
---
There wasn‚Äôt as much of an emphasis on armor in the duping days.
---
It‚Äôs rare, and that‚Äôs why it costs so much when you can get a TSE anything for just 8-15K Caps.
---
Fair enough then I was gonna say I never remember free dlc on hardly any games. I never pay for dlc
---
Hey I made a unban appeal a while ago I haven't gotten a response can you help me?
---
Well, you can advertise your location on the map and how much you have on sale.  Some locations will naturally get more foot traffic, but I'd be equally interested in seeing other CAMPs.
---
He definitely thinks everyone‚Äôs a moron if they don‚Äôt rally to his side. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised.
---
I was smoking crack for playing on xbox XD
---
If your talking about junk you can pick up off the floor or a container, it respawns after 24 hours. If your talking about things you build to extract resources, things inside won't go to the next server including anything built.
---
It might just be me, but the comment of:
---
"Caps from your sale, minus a nominal fee of 10% to maintain a healthy in-game economy, will be added to your Cap balance."
---
Is literally just make believe and serves no real purpose.
---
I thought the ‚Äúdouble damage‚Äù was just the 20% applied to the little pellet shots fired from the shell, giving the impression of ‚Äúdouble damage‚Äù?
---
I doubt it? I think it was just "You have special bullets". 
---
Like that Big Chief brand exploding round advertisement you can decorate our camp with. "Your bullets explode because you use exploding bullets"
---
I know the feeling.  Went back to my camp a few nights ago and found a super mutant upstairs trying to break down the wall to my bedroom.
---
Because it‚Äôs called survival, not deathmatch. But I get what you mean, I just don‚Äôt think that having a game with a lot of possibilities is a bad thing, after all we‚Äôre so many players, and a minority of us have special ideas and needs, let them enjoy some interesting gameplay styles.
---
Oh its going to happen sooner than latter.
---
Looking forward to seeing how it all pans out, can barely move for the crap I‚Äôve kept until find out.
---
It's gonna be nothing but Legendary Barbed Walking Canes, isn't it?
---
If u r on Xbox, I am in need of friends to group up with. Only have 2 people on my friends list that play, and they are never on.
---
What the hell is a gun zombie
---
Heh, No Man's Sky is the poster child of showing if you double down and keep going you can turn things around. The fallout from that game was far worse than 76 even (or anthem or any current game being discussed. You still have a few bitter people over that game though I still contend a lot of those people were not paying attention and making up their own ideas of what the game was going to be). Most people will admit they did a turn around (with some of us griping they're moving away from the original promise we liked in the game but I still have to admit they definitely garnered some good will even from many people who originally panned them).
---
Where did you buy it?
---
&gt; In terms of "massively" multiplayer online products, Fallout 76 stands alone as one of, if not THE easiest to conquer in terms of end game "progression". Players beat the first and final boss of the game a mere day after the game's release. 
---
Not that it detracts from your overall point, but they didn't just fire up the game on release day and beat the queen a day later. This was a group of people who had all leveled up between 45-70 by playing basically every single hour of BETA.
---
Wanna build deadly pitfalls and other traps, and on the end of it, put a selling machine with loot for 1 cap
---
That's what I figured, but maybe now they're essentially dividing that damage bonus based on the number of pellets.
---
Someone's been playing New Vegas recently
---
You gotta be kidding, right? You mean you expect people you meet and who you initiate trade with, to put their go-to-weapons in their stash, so you‚Äôre not disappointed if they don‚Äôt sell the item you want?? Or are you talking about vendor characters?
---
Happens to me on Xbox too
---
Did they fix the assaultron head yet? Or just ignore the fact that it eats all of your fusion cells completely?
---
LOLOLOL.  This is hilarious.  Good thing they didn't also leave a flip lighter and a can of turpentine.
---
&gt;You turn in a stalkers pool cue, get the scrip, then reroll your ‚Äúexterminators heavy combat left arm with lockpocking and under water breathing‚Äù into a sentinel assassins heavy combat left arm.
---
Ah, gotcha, that makes sense. Well, I mean it actually sounds like that's how the vendor is going to work, kinda; if there's a well-rolled legendary and you have the scrip, you can just buy it. We don't know what the exchange rates are going to be, so that's all speculation, but there's potential for fuckery.
---
&gt;I disagree with your argument about making it easier for other players because then you can ‚Äúremember the hard work‚Äù you put in to get the gear.
---
Eh, different personality types I suppose, all good.
---
LETS LAND OVER THERE BRUDDAS
---
Does 20 genuinely make it full-time viable? I have an in-progress flamer build I need to decide if worth going back to.
---
It's ok. Bought the plans last night. Thanks though.
---
Well played!
---
In what regard?  I don‚Äôt server hop for gear.  Let‚Äôs say however an AA exploding fast reload mini gun is what I want.  Just to get that one roll on the gun is a 1/23, 1/6, and 1/9 chance.  So a total of a 1/1242 chance for that weapon.  Granted we don‚Äôt know exactly how purveyor inventory will be sorted, perhaps we just build what we want for the right amount of scripts.  If it is simply a normal vendor inventory, then the amount of permutations in this game is staggering.  Server hopping it almost a joke at that point, so then one gets to the point of really needing more details on mechanics on this system, dosed with a healthy amount of cynicism based on how the game currently works.
---
Tell us something that we don‚Äôt already know.
---
Or better yet, give us the planting boxes from Fallout 4 which is guaranteed still in this game, but unused.
---
I do it sometimes for fun, but only when I'm kicking around in the forest.
---
I‚Äôm somewhat okay with how it sounds like it‚Äôs working.
---
The vendor will have to have that armor on him to buy it.
---
So it‚Äôs kind of like that particular armor and material will have to be rolled with both sentinel and assassins in his inventory.
---
That‚Äôs an incredibly low chance.
---
I‚Äôm okay with an incredibly low chance, because that‚Äôs what you have when you‚Äôre farming for gear.
---
fingers crossed!
---
Tse laser packs a hell of a punch.
---
Who would want to play without hurting anyone.....
---
OK, watched the video.  Its in survival.  
---
And if you truly are level 4 and the other guy is level 190-something...why are you starting shit and expecting to not lose?
---
It seems you have a very unrealistic expectation of the game.
---
O yes sorry I was just informing people that inside the vault is a solid attempt at keeping the player base informed and excited for the future. For all the flak they have really tried pretty hard to make things better.
---
Scorched, not that hard to figure out considering he says that later in the paragraph....
---
Gun zombie
---
Lmfaaoooo

Because no one is twisting your arm to server hop is whst i mean, yeah maybe you do want it, but in life not everything is there where and when you want it, i dont have the new camara yet, and im not server hopping to get it, ill get it when i get it.  Others say you *have* to server hop but thats just to get it there and then
---
Nah man, it‚Äôs getting ultra annoying at this point. These dudes could just do a sinple search here on reddit and they would find everything they ‚Äòre looking for. Instead, you have dozens of posts like this per day, from people who are just to lazy to do a quick research themselves. It‚Äôs not about not wanting to share information, it‚Äôs just not our job to feed multiple people  per day with the exact same answer.

I met someone who had a jetpack on their excavator power amor, once.
---
You are a God! üôèüòÅ
---
I watched the birth of the Team Fortress 2 economy and its ludicrous prices for polygons. ($4000 Burning Flames Team Captain says hello)
---
Nice to see Bethesda going down the same route. This is gonna be amazing to watch unfold.
---
Deflation in the supply of caps equals more value per cap. Equals lower prices.
---
I'm actuality it means you add 10% to your price.
---
Alrighty bud. When an object approaches a massive gravitational field, such as those present in black holes, the atoms are stretched vertically and compressed horizontally, often becoming a long and thin string of particles. The term for this is S*paghettification.*

If you get the hand pump

‚ÄúDrink‚Äù from it

During the drink sound and animation you can spam the collect button and it collects just as fast as any pool of water.
---
Unless it's a supermutant. They can smell you better if you're clean. I mean... look at how they live ffs!
---
I would think that the ammo weight is more of a problem.  But then, for Cryo Cell ammo, I know I can hit up Lucky Hole Mine for Crystal.
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt even know.. perhaps a guy who likes the feeling of being a hunted rabbit.
---
I never saw a test. There was a wide agreement that shotguns were dealing far more than +20% explosive damage, but the +20% per pellet idea was a guess.
---
No one even does the encrypted event anymore besides the ultra rare level 40 who hasn't done the quest yet
---
A lot of people didn't; they bitched and moaned on here until the devs raised it.
---
Personally, my first character was melee and had 0 reason to hold onto legendary guns I was never going to use, so I sold them, and I never got above 400 on it till recently(turns out I had around 150 Purified Water stored, and 200 Radaway).
---
On ranged characters I do tend to easily albeit briefly go over 400 or 500, but after some ammo/nade crafting I'm back down.
---
It‚Äôs a Fallout 76 subreddit, not a ¬´¬†I know some stuff¬†¬ª subreddit.
---
Only when they have shops! And a billion weapons for sell so it‚Äôs clearly a mule. If I meet a player randomly in the world, of course I‚Äôm not going to ask them to go put their weapon away.
---
Oh, well in that case
---
Trench coat and a gas mask
---
That's literally all that needs to be said. You use a bulky trench coat designed for guys and a face-concealing mask in real life, I gurantee everybody's gonna assume you're a guy, since the aforementioned bulky coat hides all distinguishable traits and the mask...well, it's a mask
---
&gt; I liked the stories they included in notes and holotapes but after 200h there's nothing left to do.
---
Dude, you got 200 hours out of a $60 purchase. If you've run out of stuff to do go play something else for a while.
---
Tell me something I don't know.
---
This will help survival mode so much.
---
There‚Äôs so little incentive for cooperation as a default in survival.
---
Everyone is so dang trigger happy lol
---
Bruh
---
I would be happy getting that bloodied two-star Handmade I accidentally dropped in the icebox with the rest of the whitesprings vendor trash this weekend.
---
Sadly none yet amigo
---
Looks like they‚Äôll be a tad more affordable now eh?
---
Agreed, if you only have to kill a couple of 3 star legendary to get the best gear in the game, the shelf life get cut to the point that it‚Äôs no different than a pay to play phone game. 
---
I appreciate that - Even as a casual player (with ~70 hours of play).  I have mid level gear, and still struggle with some enemy encounters. This makes the game a challenge, and fun, when/if I can walk through anything, then the game has lost its challenge, and I‚Äôm no longer interested.
---
I never pretended I could provide you with such information about the game.
---
He's just wondering why the initial responder would automatically assume that all mole miners are male, and be surprised that there would be female mole miners.  I personally never really thought about it, but it would make sense that there are males &amp; females, otherwise, how would they keep their species going.
---
So you crutch on stealth boys? Scrub.
---
There could be titles connected to crafting weapon types, building X number of unique things in a camp, hidden quests (like the TNT domes), earning X money from trading or vending. The list goes on and on...
---
This got me too. Love it.
---
I am fine with that. As long as the tokens don't weight 12lb a piece.
---
It cuts down on all the caps that are in circulation and makes for a healthier in-game economy. If this wasn't a thing then everyone will eventually end up with max caps and nothing to spend it on.
---
Bruhhhhhh
---
Thanks, you mean changing the status to ‚ÄòAppear Offline‚Äô, then back to ‚ÄòOnline‚Äô? I‚Äôll give it a try.
---
IMO the survival changes in survival are a step backwards, they are fine as they are now. People who play survival for the extra experience will kill themselves when they are highlighted on the map like they did when survival came out.
---
It could be a mixture of a few. I traded with a guy who had a few different skins mixed together.
---
i've noticed if you build ontop of a hard coded animal spawn, they will randomly spawn inside your house.  
---
had this happen to me in a river, moved my house about 100ft away and never had the problem again. plus the benefit of being able to snipe molerats off my front porch!
---
That‚Äôs good to know, so it‚Äôs probably not a PSN issue.
---
Is there any possibility that there will be Energy Resistance piercing perks or legendary effects in the future? I personally think that'll make all energy and plasma weapons much more viable than a flat damage boost.
---
Lfg? I know of the game hub thingy. Go to multiplayer and ppl post shit up
---
Scrip cannot be traded.
---
Honestly, more RNG was exactly what I was expecting.  Creating a system where players could grind their way towards making and upgrading their perfect gun, sword or full suit of bespoke armor just seemed too much like rewarding hard work with actual results.
---
I'm guessing it's going to be a system of dumping your unwanted crap in the vending box for scrips, finding the legendary vendor, looking through a dozen lootgen pieces, finding nothing, server hopping and repeating endlessly, much the same as trying to kit out an X-01 suit with the mods you like.
---
When creating something that players want is too hard, just fall back on the tried and true RNG god.  Let his fickle nature caress your tired fingers and make all those creative juices just wash away.  The player base will be "satisfied enough".
---
Seriously though, I was never expecting to actually be able to make exactly what I wanted.  Clearly BGS has a massive boner for random chance.  The perfectly preserved pie has been proof of that since day one of Fo3.
---
Yeah that's it I hope it works for you
---
It‚Äôs been confirmed that they cannot he traded.
---
&gt; but to do that I have to find somebody I trust to hand over all that ammo and my gear. 
---
I got lucky, sort of. I gave my daughter a copy of the game, and she decided she does not like it. So my mules are on a separate account I can log in and trade directly to.
---
They shouldn‚Äôt nerf anything at this point.   People put a lot of effort spec‚Äôing into builds.  Making those builds moot defeats all their hard work.
---
Vault tec power armor paint?
---
Are we allowed to have any fun in this game? or is that only reserved for bloody melee users?
---
All is good
---
&gt;!I secretly just want to make sure everyone is informed in an attempt to get those prices to drop so I don't have to save up max caps to get a splody shotty.!&lt;
---
Your just proving my point that you are ignorant of the mechanics . If you are sprinting and not invisible than they can crit you and crits bypass those legendary effects
---
God his smile makes my skin crawl. Whoever designed him needs a damn raise.
---
Lol, sounds like you crutch on auto aim vats. Who's the scrub?
---
I run a Stealth Build, and in my regular Armor my Agility is 20-21 depending on the weapon I'm using, some of the things I've learned over my 212 levels about Stealth are;
---
1. If you're on a team, and in close proximity to team mates, your Stealth is broken when they are discovered.
---
2. The last patch introduced a new bug where I am sometimes in Danger for no reason, and the only way to fix it is to FT or enter/exit a building to cause a re-spawn.
---
3. Using more than 1 piece of Chameleon Armor doesn't improve Stealth, I have tested this thoroughly, but using Armor with +1 Agility does.
---
4. If your Agility is high enough, Berry Mentats will no longer highlight you, tested that last night and 19 agility seems to be the point, but this may be affected by other players perception, need to do more testing. 
---
5. Simply equipping an Un-Silenced weapon can break your Stealth, this includes grenades.
---
6. Mole Rats have the highest Perception of any enemy in the game, and Mole Miners are at the opposite end of the Scale.
---
7. It is possible to maintain Stealth (Hidden/Caution) for the duration of Uranium Fever, I've done it both alone &amp; with others, but not while on a team.
---
Yeah its called Looking For Group on the xbox home tab.
---
I‚Äôm curious to know if you‚Äôll be able to fast travel directly to an advertised camp. And if so, if it will cost caps.
---
Survival only , murder hobos need to leave adventure mode alone.
---
Easy way to get rid of left over flamers too!
---
The single player is so big I can‚Äôt imagine needing any online play.
---
That is awesome...thanks!
---
That may still happen, we can tell from today's article that the vendor will indeed sell legendary items but we have no idea if re rolling items will happen or not. Or what other functionality she may or may not have. That won't be announced until next week's inside the vault. Everyone needs to chill until we get the exact details on how it will work
---
If your on xb1, ive got a spare mountain honey recipe. I'm just after the damn firecracker whiskey.
---
&gt;Agreed, if you only have to kill a couple of 3 star legendary to get the best gear in the game, the shelf life get cut to the point that it‚Äôs no different than a pay to play phone game.
---
Which is why we see the grinders with hundreds of hours complaining. I completely believe they've missed the overall aspect of this game. Adventuring. And now they complain the Beth isn't changing the game to fit their expectations. It's maddening.
---
Wah my build is broken and now they're actually making balanced! Wahhhh
---
Yeah. I was so excited for it after playing SP. Ended up very disappointed..
---
I totally agree. These game have always featured unlimited inventory, for them to impose a limit is understandable but sad
---
Yea, I think they got banned or something lol. Idk dupers died a while back
---
Just don't want to get killed when resting or is there another reason to block access? I've had some people get like upset at me for entering their camps and I never understood why. Now I just use benches if they're outside and try to leave quick as to not upset anyone but I really want to see what people are building out there.
---
Ok now place is nuked by somebody that does not know no need for nuke.. well done that somebody! Outstanding move!
---
Jesus lord. The first chance I got to launch a nuke, top of the world was my immediate location. I know it wouldn't effect her, but damn it just felt good.
---
I understand now! I personally wouldn't make that assumption, which is probably where my confusion came from, but I do get your line of thinking. I suppose this is just a lesson in the idea that male is not necessarily the default, nor should it be. Thank you for taking the time to explain your thoughts, it's appreciated. :)
---
Why?
---
You realize its not truly random though right?  Things are weighted, inside of that RNG.  1 star items are weighted much higher than 3 star items.
---
There is no rerolling and no adding stars lol.
---
From today news it also seems you'll just buy new lehendaries with a new currency
---
I've been rolling an alt character to try bloodied builds, and so far, I can't stand it. 
---
I can see why people like the massive damage and 30+ str and agi, but non-bloodied stealth sniper is just way more fun for me.
---
I might be in the minority, but I feel as if a lot of the legendary effects need a rework, or rebalance at the least.
---
Great. Now you have me picturing a used-car lot complete with those colorful triangle pennant strings and ugly SALE signs.
---
I understand it's a joke, but I feel like explaining the math behind it. If you put a weapon up for sale for 500 caps, then the 10% fee is 50 caps. Add 50 caps to selling price and the 10% fee becomes 55. You will want to charge 11% more to compensate for the fee.
---
I am thinking it wasn't this one, but I can't be sure. As /u/bcasto801 pointed out, mixed pieces could produce the effect, I guess.
---
Some of the things you talk about though are some of the reasons I personally hate the Legendary system to begin with anyways though. I don't see anything remotely impressive when I come across people who have amazing legendary weapons and armor, nor do I ever feel any sense of reward for myself by getting something good, because you don't actually ever "earn" a good Legendary, you just happen to finally get a lucky roll in the RNG system. There's nothing inherently awesome about killing a million Legendary ghouls. The "work" you do to get a good Legendary is totally arbitrary. It's a number that's set by the developers behind the scenes, you're working for a dice roll, not for any of the Legendaries you actually get.
---
Buying Legendaries for a lot of caps from someone else is slightly different, because you're working toward something tangible by hitting a certain cap threshold for a particular item. But again though, it's only that way from the beginning because of an arbitrary system you have no control over.
---
And I get that it's an online game and all that, and that Fallout 76 isn't the only one that does it and such, but that doesn't mean I have to enjoy RNG systems, and I think relying on them too heavily kills any chances of innovation that might actually result in a more meaningful system.
---
Depending on how much extra carry weight the backpacks give it may solve this issue. Stash boxes could be for just your scrap, and vendor items. With the backpack we may be able to carry all our spare aid and ammo rather then storing them in the stash boxes. We will see
---
I think you might be right. I'll keep an eye out and screenshot the next time I see the guy :)
---
Not sure if this helps but make sure you don't have your camera equipped when you use your emotes. It will either teleport you or make your game crash.
---
Yes, that‚Äôs another story. I get your point.
---
Are we able to sell ammo and aid items?
---
Would be nice to fix floating objects in general. This has been an issue since they used the same engine for Morrowind back in ‚Äò02.
---
I think adding such functionality would merit its own bullet point, so  I assume not.
---
Glad you did, I was about to give it a try.
---
Regicide!!
---
You're right, i'm all for buffing bad vs nerfing good, but you don't even need to spec into anything for explosive shotguns to one shot most enemies currently.
---
There is one over near Flatwoods, it makes Salisbury Steaks, or other things, pretty easy one to defend as well.
---
It wasn't in a paper bag, but on the vendorbot in Artisan's Corner one night, at the height of the duping period, I bought my first TSE handmade, TSE combat shotgun, and QE double barrel shotgun.  I suppose someone just wanted caps and had tons of them.
---
Pacifist keeps you from dealing damage. It never kept you from taking damage, but since you don't deal damage, you don't accidentally enter PVP.
---
That‚Äôs what I figured, but we‚Äôll see.
---
It makes sense. What happens to an economy when there is a method to create cash, but no method to remove it from circulation? 
---
vendors already perform this function. Ensuring player vendors do it as well keeps that economy from crashing. 
---

Why isn't this real? Because sacred geometry is never accidental.
---
Reddit is not the place for it. No one here gives a fuck. They just down vote and call you a cheater. People in the new section are literally cancer.
---
Zombine
---
If all that sell via vending are getting a 10% tax then it doesn't have to do with cutting down on the caps. It's an arbitrary fee and wont increase the value of the caps economy.
---
Except you can't get it in the game, explosive energy weapons don't drop any more.
---
I want to level up legendary weapons/armor. Got too many good rolls three stars low level items. I don't want to sell that furious faster pitchfork, I want to use it.
---
This lol, I was hoping not to be let down.
---
‚ÄúBrave Sir Robin‚Äù maybe? (For repeatedly sprinting away from battle)
---
https://youtu.be/BZwuTo7zKM8
---
Kind of bummed the trading machine isn't at whitespring, I think a "hub" would be very welcome here.
---
Lol you can crouch to simply avoid being vats, that‚Äôs not a excuse but nice try scrub. And I don‚Äôt worry about scrubs like you anyway, if you‚Äôre at range my BE laser will melt you in a hit or two, and if you‚Äôre close up my auto bloodied Tesla will instakill you with me just shooting it at the floor.
---
Cat piss is the worst, straight amonia.
---
I‚Äôm not going to deny that the trading system is a pain in the ass, but I made like 8k caps yesterday selling nothing but junk. (Also sold a couple of weapons, just full disclosure.) 
---
I guess you can kill 40 people who have workshops to make that, but that seems like a waste of time and resources imo. Also, lots of server hops. I did that a bunch last night while looking for plans, and 9/10, there were very little workshops taken. :/
---
Oh that‚Äôs a great strategy! I sincerely hope it‚Äôll work, because the prices are becoming ridiculous. A few days ago I was hoping to get my hands on one for 15k caps, on the ¬´¬†auction‚Äôs post¬†¬ª (? Sorry I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs correct) it was the highest bid. But in the end, the owner posted ¬´¬†it‚Äôs sold for 26k, on another post I made¬†¬ª. I was shocked! ¬´¬†Fortunately¬†¬ª someone else traded his explosive combat shotgun for that same amount of caps... Just to say that I agree, the prices need to drop.
---
Agreed, caps are already damn near worthless at the present time
---
Much better.  There are many people just like yourself wondering the same thing. If you‚Äôre thread doesn‚Äôt get a lot of traction there are some that have.  But they are updating the game every 1-2 weeks. We have a really cool update coming May 7th with new content.    You just missed a double xp event last weekend. But there will be more events soon.
---
Like all those badly designed challenges we're getting of late too.  I'm skipping on various daily and weekly ones.  Would already have spent for atoms if it wasn't for the recent bad challenges and clear atom store cash grab tactics.  I just don't like being strong armed.
---
At this point I just want the Ultracite prototype since its the only PA I don't have a paint for, I'll stick with Blackbird for the main 4, and the Bone Raider on the Excavator.  Aside from that all I want is the Corvega purifier and a skin for my Handmade.  The rest is all gravy I don't need, but would have been happy to spend money on had Bethesda not gone off track with the atom store (and repair kits despite me not even needing them - wrong is just wrong).
---
ok i solo'd a free range and i got credit that time
---
I updated my post to clarify what I meant, so I appreciate you pointing it out. :)
---
Screenshots?
---
Caps tax on items you set to sale.
---
Yes that‚Äôs right! Now I know :)
---
Don‚Äôt forget a higher risk of damage taken too
---
I‚Äôm still not buying your whole argument.  If people wanted to be insulted, the banjos, steel guitars and shine still would have been enough.  I‚Äôve been through and worked with enough West Virginians to say that the whole Wrong Turn analogy is close enough for some (not all).  Besides, Bethesda had no problem putting a bunch of inbred hicks in Maryland in that DLC.  If they were so nervous about backlash, they could probably get away with pulling it from Steam and such even now.
---
If you can fast-travel there.  If not, CAMPS near f-t points will still get an advantage.
---
I'm going to hold my fire until it's actually out.  I'm going to trust what Todd Howard said and if it turns out not to be true I will be exceptionally disappointed.  It won't stop me from playing the game but it would cause me to have much more doubt about what they tell us in the future.

---
Link to the previous Inside the Vault that states:
---
&gt; This is a change that will prevent other players‚Äô attacks from dealing damage to objects and structures you‚Äôve built in your C.A.M.P. so long as you (or your Turrets) are not hostile against those players. We‚Äôre excited to let you know that we‚Äôre currently planning to roll this out with Patch 9 in early May.
---
I got one as well. It's not a dupe because i never had one. I also had a full set of raider pa attached to another randomly appearing chassis in my inventory. Not mad at all about it. No sir! And coincidentally on the same day i've set myself to collecting a full set of each type. Uhhh thanks for the headstart, bethesda?
---
I asked the guy and he didn't say anything about criticals so idk.
---
Every time I go to the train station in the bog I think it would be cool if the pinball machine was working.
---
I see where you‚Äôre coming from.
---
Bethesda RPG‚Äôs have always been RNG based though.
---
And most people don‚Äôt get the gear they want from getting it dropped themselves, they get comparable gear or lots of desireable but less valuable gear and trade it for the gear they want.
---
Certain Gear is valuable not because it‚Äôs anymore rare than any other gear, but because it‚Äôs value in terms of functional use increases the demand for it; so when you see some one with endgame gear you should know that there‚Äôs no way they got every one of those armor pieces to drop for them.
---
I started playing again on Friday. Maybe played 10 hours total before that. Started my new character this past weekend and am up to level 25 and having a good time. For sure give it another go.
---
https://youtu.be/57Ao4dZQgIE
---
Be careful! DownvotingMan is on the loose!
---
From newvegas I‚Äôm guessing.  Typo he said he meant whitesprings
---
This is how it works. 1 star enemies will drop an item that has one effect. 2 star enemies can drop items that have one OR two effects. 3 star enemies can drop items that have one, two OR three effects. Of course you're more likely to get 1 star items but certain effects don't have a higher/lower percentage of dropping.
---
Servers crap out enough these days that it could have disconnected everyone.
---
I'm going to have to find good stuff to sell then. My C.A.M.P. is a pain to get to of you don't drop a good 100 feet onto it. At least it's centrally located.
---
Hell yeah
---
Sounds like you want this game to be more survival based, but that's not gonna happen since it's wanting to attract RPG players
---
Get someone to craft you a level 50 fixer if yours is only level 30. If you‚Äôre on PS4 I can hook you up
---
Lol no it doesn‚Äôt
---
Oh yeah. I'll just crouch there on a melee build and wait until everyone comes to me. Good plan. Anyone who talks a big game on the internet is usually pretty bad at whatever they're boasting on. 
---
You get melted by guys in stealth and you're mad that you can't use your auto aim. You wanna take out your frustration on me. All good man. I get it
---
I am on XB1!  GT is dashsixteen, I'm usually online after 10 PM Pacific but can make time to hop on earlier to grab this from you.
---
Oh yeah
---
Great I‚Äôll try it tonight
---
Gamers will pick the most optimal way to do something even if they hate it. Game design 101, make the optimal path the designed path.
---
Damn must have missed my golden opportunity. Shush I had known what armor sets to buy when they were cheap üôÅ
---
We still have to farm the legendaries though. It will be nice to be able to have a different way to obtain good legendary items other than player trading. I trade a lot and still get tired of the ridiculous prices or exact same sent/Assasin, AAE or bloodied God rolls everyone wants as a trade. I just hope Bethesda makes you actually work for and grind the new currency, not swap a couple junk legendaries and boom, instant rare gear
---
Isn't it standard procedure for a live service game to do that, though? Several main devs/producers/whatever move on to other projects and the dedicated team for the game continues moving forward.
---
I am, and the groups I play with are "Filthy Casuals" and the "Minutedudes" groups.
---
It's a Mature group, no children allowed in Party Chat, I'm one of the older ones at 58, but we have a lot over 30.
---
Everyone is helpful and generous, you're welcome to join us, just look me up and join the party, be a team player and your friends list will grow quickly.
---
i'm terribly fond of Rose and Modus both. Great designs.
---
That reminds me an awful lot like Star Wars Galaxies, and I loved that mechanic. I would love to see something like that!
---
Typing things like "for sell" is jarring and distracting to me, but YMMV.
---
Damn must have missed my golden opportunity. Which I had the game knowledge to know what armor sets to buy when they were cheap.
---
It's not a nerf if it was a bug. You sound like one of those Gatling Gun players bitching a few patches ago. Can't wait until they fix the pipe rifle and meat hook bugs so we can reaaaaaally read some salty posts lol
---
Yeah I know, I have not actually done the full imposter quest. I've fought 4 legendary Sheepsquacth so far. Never got a decent legendary drop. I encountered him at Whitesprings 2  and the Herd quest and just randomly.
---
They really need a rework all around, I'm on my 3rd character trying for a Vats sniper build but Ive lost steam on it. Fatigued by the game at this point. Tried the melee route on character 2 and had no fun with it. Don't want a skyrim experience in my fallout. 
---
Essentially everyone is using the same 2-3 builds which is the problem and the gun play has always been terrible, which is why everyone had a TSE and now it's antiarmor explosive or bloodied. Every other perk is almost useless and they want to talk about "balance" I guess if we all wear the same armor have the same build and weapons than its balanced.
---
yep.
---
I gotta upgrade MY door as well.
---
I got beavers and molerats and stuff like that just traipsing in and out and whenever I come back, I INVARIABLY find my door OPEN
---
I was about to say they are doing double damage i was wondering why my gun was so strong
---
I got a full set of ultracite and raider and i'm certain i didn't have a single piece of either chassis included. I had my x-01 and a few pieces of a t45 on another in my inventory. Ironically, i found them the same day i decided to collect a full set of each PA. On one side, i'm worried bethesda will find out and brand me a cheater even though i did nothing but log on. On the other, i'm worried that if i email them about it to try avoid being banned, they'll delete them from my inventory. Oh the humanity!üò´
---
seriously bethesda , you nerf shotguns anymore im done with this fucking game ... already nerfed my primary weapon into the floor , now your saying your removing half of that damage also WTF
---
If you were sprinting with cav armor and got 1 shotted then it was definitely a vats shot . This is why invisible vats builds are best in survivor . They can just sit in stealth and build crits . if they don‚Äôt kill their target by the time they are spotted they have sentinel to lower any damage that isn‚Äôt a vats shot
---
All that plastic though....
---
First they add taxes to my internet purchases! Then they add taxes to my video games!? HOW DO I ESCAPE TAXES?!

---
I'm just coming back to the game after a few months, I've done the event, but haven't found him randomly yet.. not sure where he spawns, people give vague descriptions, lol.
---
Maybe don't build around a known bug?
---
Yeah you're probably right. It sounds pretty fucking stupid to combine someone's time spent over 6 months on an activity and represent it as a straight time frame without pause.
---
im going to say they wont let us sell it through the vending machine.
---
I'm debating whether to just add a vending machine to my current grounds, or reconfigure my whole CAMP into a store and relocate.  My current location is a pain to climb
---
I'll also point out that the full details aren't known yet on how this vendor will work. While the scrap and then buy idea is a given due the the notes released today there may be additional functionality that wasn't mentioned yet. Wish everyone would chill until we get the inside the vault next week with the the actual info
---
Me?  I don‚Äôt use a shotgun build.  But thanks for your input.
---
I‚Äôm still not buying your whole argument.  If people wanted to be insulted, the banjos, steel guitars and shine stills would have been enough.  I‚Äôve been through and worked with enough West Virginians to say that the whole Wrong Turn analogy is close enough for some (not all).  Besides, Bethesda had no problem putting a bunch of inbred hicks in Maryland in that DLC.  If they were so nervous about backlash, they could probably get away with pulling it from Steam and such even now.
---
Yea those OP weapons and armors were never meant to be a common sight but thanks to dupers you can‚Äôt even play pvp properly unless you buy a set too. It‚Äôs just plain ridiculous. I don‚Äôt think it will be instant rare gear, it‚Äôs probably gonna be RNG based just like x01 shocks and jetpacks. You have to have sufficient scrips then hop server like crazy to come across the ones you look for.
---
&gt;It freaking sucks.
---
fucking bullshit is what it is. they don't give you any kind of warning either. even post-transaction.  super fucked up.
---
Funny thing.. i've never repaired a single piece of PA from day one. My durability never goes down. AND i got a couple random full sets show up in my inventory. If this game is terribly glitched and unfair, i'm getting the white privilege version of it.üòÇü§£
---
Love it!
---
Prickett's fort
---
Could be.  That was my first thought when they said it would be female.  It is a story line that hasn't been resolved yet, after all we never found the body.  I suppose she could be in one of the other DLCs that will drop later this year.  I hope we find some clues as to who the Purveyor is\was after it drops.
---
They are destructible
---
this makes me wonder if it would run on my Vega graphics laptop....lol
---
Even the ones I'm wearing get ultralight.  I'm mostly in power armor anyway, just have a few Legendary pieces handy for crafting and special circumstances.
---
Cap limit should be rise to at least 50k as everyone is close or already in max caps at moment.
---
Kind off, the moment you log off your impact is gone with you.
---
Nice. I keep about 20 on me; then by the time I'm close to running out; I craft more with Chemist and Super Duper.
---
Bye Felicia üëã
---
seriously. it's baffling how short sighted people are.
---
*wElL y nOt JuSt gIvE uS uNliMiTeD StAsH sPAcE*
---
We're long lost twin brothers. Same here.
---
Agreed, we don't need RNG based mechanics. We need a system that forces players to farm and work their way to the gear. That way players can earn it instead of getting lucky and would give players more to do in the game. Just don't make it quick or easy to get the top tier gear
---
I‚Äôd like some clarification as to what the backpack will hold? If it just holds more junk then fine. However, if BGS drop yet another clanger and it also includes non equipped stuff.....
---
I‚Äôll get my coat
---
Heh, you should see the roads in northern Ontario. You're paying taxes so they don't get this bad. Still not sure where my taxes go though.
---
Yea an important question before I possibly screw up by have my alt go cash in all my mains legendary loot!!!
---
It only costs 2 plastic and I had like 800 at the time
---
I'm 26, so that's perfect. I will look you guys up :)
---
Very nice set up.  My crew and I got ours weekend before last.  They ended up side by side about 15 ft. apart and I set my photo up from the front and off to one side.  I got dusted by another Scorchbeast just as I took photo and it looks pretty cool, but the one furthest away is only outlined in the green mist.
---
20 flamer ammo per craft is still very disappointing to me. I wanted to use my flamer, but this still doesn‚Äôt make it worth it.
---
after the TSE nerf doesnt fucking feel like im doing double damage at all ... takes like 5 shots to kill a level 50 supermutant ....so by that logic post nerf will take me 10 shots to kill a level 50 GTFOH im level 300 thats fucking stupid...
---
This. I get tired of killing people because I won't trade with them so they throw fits and destroy my camp. üôÑ It's like they're scared of survival or something.
---
clearly that's what they want. i seriously don't get this shit. when they nerfed explosive before, they rendered shotguns useless unless you are perked out for them. even then they are just good. now, who knows. i don't buy this shit that they weren't reflecting the nerf. i felt that shit when it happened.
---
This is the first time I‚Äôve heard of the miracle water in Whitespring. Thank you! Seeing those disease notifications pop up forever annoys me.
---
 Certainly matter made of atoms and molecules is subject to this effect but the atoms themselves are much more resilient. Pulling atoms apart from one another is far different than pulling them apart. 
---
 Long past Shotguns ... can we fix explosives?
---
I'm not super excited about the legendary vendor so I really can't be too disappointed when it finally goes live -- I just want to place where I can dump my ar$e tier legendary gear :-)
---
Not nominal. Having 7 characters full of legendaries should get me more than your 100k, considering i have 50k that can't buy the items i want anyway.
---
Well the two times I encountered him at Whitesprings was from a government drop in the middle of some mannequins. It was a empty box but summoned the lvl 80 Legendary Noxious  Sheepsquacth, hes a beast to tangle with. Other time was the protect the herd event. Once we got the cows to the farm he spawned on us. Fourth was just a random encounter I think it was at wendigo cave during whatever event spawns there. I hope that helps you!
---
And I‚Äôll spot you crouched and chameleoned and one shot you, nice try.
---
Actually I‚Äôm the guy on my team that always ends up having to take out the stealth boy guys, why? Because the two weapons I mentioned obliterate them with no effort.
---
You get butthurt you got vats constantly and can‚Äôt understand the mechanics of how to not be vats without a stealthboy, again you‚Äôre just a scrub, and your stealthboys will run out, regardless, I‚Äôd still mop the floor with you with no effort. I know this because all stealthboy spammers I‚Äôve encountered have no skill, that‚Äôs why they spam stealthboys.
---
I use bloodied so im doing alot as is and tse is not that strong as is its nice but its not the quick to kill gun set up
---
Wish they would implement a system based on what you scrap. Want a bloodied God roll, make players scrap a certain amount of bloodied weapons plus the script for it. That would also promote player vending and trading as the 1* weapons that are rarely wanted will actually be valuable to the market for scrapping
---
I was just saying this exact same thing in another thread.  Legendary drops are everything in this game, yet anyone over level 50 has the same (extremely slim) chances at good drops.  It makes the end game feel really stale, because that good weapon you found at level 75 is still your best gun at level 130.  It makes it feel like there is no real progression much beyond level 100 or so.
---
I'm in UK (BST), GT:Pehetez I'm usually on daily after 5PM, weekends all day if the wife's out. I'll keep hold of it for you.
---
Yeah I have serendipity and dodgy, just my strength perks have been maxxed out for so long I didn't even think about it. I have like 12 points of carry-weight related perks in str right now.
---
I'm just going to add a vending machine to my current campgrounds and see what happens from there. I hope they raise the level of caps because for those of us that are already at our cap limit a vending machine would make no sense.
---
yeah this is bullshit.
---
I really do hope it's a real grind to acquire/create your perfect piece of kit.  If the vendor hands out god-tier equipment with minimal effort, then the power balance of the game shifts enormously.  All future enemies start becoming bullet sponges, players that don't have the time or patience to grind out an AA/E/Reload handmade rifle or B/SS/STR melee weapon start falling even further behind the power curve, and the divide between the haves and have-nots becomes an impassable canyon.
---
I consider my character to be in the "have" bracket with top-end weapons that I ground out either through pure luck and stick-to-it-iveness, trading with other players for gear that I can use for gear that they can use and so on.  I'm certain that most of my time since BETA has been spent farming and acquiring legendary gear that I continually upgrade through player-to-player trades.  I don't see the vendor replacing that system, just supplementing it.  If I see something nuts like a [B/SS/STR mole miner's gauntlet](https://imgur.com/GXcKxJ1) show up in my RNG list, I'm going to use my scrips to buy it and try to trade for something I can use that shows up in someone else's RNG pile, assuming they're similarly minded.  Let's use an [AA/E/Per hunting rifle](https://imgur.com/0qijS48) as an example.  That would be a very valuable piece for me, but the gauntlet does me no good.  1/1 trade happens and both parties are very pleased.
---
There‚Äôs more high level content with the addition of The Burrows, Free Range and Encryptid events. The player base is also very active.
---
I've got [my favorite](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/23bs9o) picked out. Now to figure out how to earn it.
---
&gt;  So explain to me how this game is supposed to sustain itself when it didn't sell well? 
---
Because they don't have to support massive servers like blizzard did for diablo 2. Instead of having to have servers that could regularly handle 10's of millions, fo76 has to have servers handle what a million max? It isn't expensive at all to run servers that small in comparison to the server costs to run ones that could handle 10's of millions concurrent users.
---
&gt;See, there's nothing actually pay to win in the game, and you can cite all kinds of things not actually implemented in the game like fridges.. but we don't know how those will be implemented. Likely it'll just be another crafting station.
---
Sure if you ignore literally what bethesda has stated in the ITV releases. They plainly stated that they were looking to add fridges, ammo swappers, and ways to stash without going to a stash into the atom shop. That is why I stated those things, because they were specific things that bethesda has already said they want to add. So it isn't some wild speculation, it is listening to the devs.
---
&gt;What are you really spreading except scare tactics? Anti consumerism? You don't have to buy anything in the game. I've gotten countless skins and shit, all for free. Basically you're full of shit, trying to compare a game that has nothing remotely in common with this one, because it did so well.. but let's be real. That's almost 20 years ago, and any/all online games were new to players, that's why we played shit games like that one.
---
Shit game? ROFL, dude you are in the fo76 subreddit. This game doesn't have a single review above 60, d2 doesn't have a single review below 80. They aren't the same because diablo 2 was actually created and released back when triple a developers only released finished non shit games. 
---
Sorry your view on what is good and bad is very skewed if you think d2 was a bad game and fo76 is a good one.
---
There is a story, and a ton more to be told. But people are way into the legendary hunt more than the story for the most part. But some of us are all about the story they are telling.
---
You are probably correct that less people would be playing, but that in itself is kind of a shame given the roots of this franchise.
---
I have it, great quality, much larger than expected and the recipes are really good.
---
ie: mystery meat wrapped nukalurk is actual a fantastic bacon wrapped scallops recipe.
---
Happens to me all the time down in the Burrows. I guess whatever area you enter that triggers the spawns is placed incorrectly/too close, or it could be due to server lag. Makes it super annoying for a ranged build to clear it.
---
I understand they don't, but they should.
---
Truth
---
Nah. You're the one picking a fight on the internet with someone you've never met. You're obviously super salty. Winning doesn't make people as salty as you are. Writing a couple paragraphs about how cool you are. Lol. Take care dude. I'm done with you.
---
Oh god I just imagined that, venturing deep into the mines and you just hear that. Won't hear their angry noises the same ever again.
---
Less even, I paid 2000 for my TSE lever action
---
So 36 fuel with ammo Smith and 46.8 with both ammsmith and super duper.
---
It also gives the Quest Failed popup like 10-15 seconds before the timer runs out.
---
As post below. Forgot to reply.
---
I was really hoping they‚Äôd give the purveyor the ability to level up legendaries.  Hand over an exploding shotgun lvl 15 and 50 scrips,  bam,  level 50 exploding shotgun.
---
The extra are a leveling tax.  Fits with the theme of the ‚Äúcompany store‚Äù the purveyor is running.
---
Guy above is wrong and thinks he knows better. Beth sent me an email saying ‚Äúthey‚Äôre still investigating and working toward a safe way to return the characters/ account back to the world without issue and to be assured once a safe method is in place the account will be reactivated and an email sent to the account to which it is linked‚Äù
---
**He is actually level 54, not level 4.**
---
Watch his loading screens, it says so, and he is losing 13 caps each death (54\*.25 rounded down)
---
He is tied for 4th on the leader board.
---
Can someone post the text?
---
My kingdom for 800 plastic
---
Worded perfectly
---
Of course. People are saying that instead of Legendary items, maybe we will be able to buy Legendary "mods" with certain effects. I doubt that's the case, but it goes to show how little we know so far.
---
I legit had no idea of this bug. I've been slaughtering things with my level 40 explosive shotgun thinking I just lucked out with this shotgun that would out damage any of my level 50 weapons. Figured it's damage output was due to the weapon mods and really well placed shots.
---
This makes a whole lot more sense though, because I'm a horrible shot. Even with a shotgun.
---
The Fancy Lad snack cake recipe is quite honestly one of the best cakes I have ever tasted and I literally crave them months after experiencing them.
---
The recipe book is legit.
---
You are likely correct, although we can't be positive. The Strong Force is needed to hold the makeup of atoms together, but we can't be for sure that the violent forces of a black hole don't overcome the Strong Force. 
---
Afaik, we haven't intentionally spaghettified anything lmao.
---
Liked this feature back in my WoW days.  I support it.
---
only junk
---
True, I'm hoping Bethesda implements a unique solution that works to benefit the game. I'll keep my fingers crossed until the next details come out
---
WRONG. Stop hoarding all the extra small stuff. If you're the type of person who needs 10 armor pieces and 10 guns that you actually swap between, then you need to get weight reduction perks and figure it out. 
---
Vending will make it easier to dump the don't toss/don't use guns and random items that take up the stash, but you're asking for more stash so you can sell more. 
---
Go play with bitcoin or something.
---
This kid reminds me of the wow kid that tried to stick the remote up his butt
---
Or you could *ask* someone if they're interested in PVP, and if they aren't you could leave them alone.
---
Crud.  I forgot about the cap limit.  I usually manage to stay at about 24K but buying plans for things, but....
---
&gt; Certain Gear is valuable not because it‚Äôs anymore rare than any other gear, but because it‚Äôs value in terms of functional use increases the demand for it; so when you see some one with endgame gear you should know that there‚Äôs no way they got every one of those armor pieces to drop for them. 
---
Fair point, I'm getting a better picture about what you meant earlier then. I was misinterpreting it as more of a general defense I've seen a lot about RNG systems and grind.
---
&gt; Bethesda RPG‚Äôs have always been RNG based though. 
---
Only to a certain extent though, and only for more specific circumstances. Before Fallout 4, RNG systems in their games were much more downscaled, and participation in the RNG was never really necessary for player advancement or end-game optimization. The best weapons and armor in the games were things you got by completing certain quests or exploring certain places in the form of artifacts, buying them in fixed places from a store, or in the case of Skyrim, making/improving them yourself. And still, even when something was part of RNG, it had a more tangible system. If I go through a dungeon in Oblivion or Skyrim and come across a high-level boss, they are wearing the badass armor and wielding the badass weapons against me as I fight them. So when I succeed in killing them, it actually feels like I earned it because it felt like a legitimate part of the game world that this boss had made or acquired a certain set of gear. But in Fallout, it gets incredibly jarring to fight ghouls, scorched, and mutated creatures that drop these extremely powerful weapons and armor (or in some cases, ridiculously useless ones) that clearly don't play any part in the experience of fighting them for it.
---
They said its gonna be coming in a few weeks after patch 9
---
Yea good idea!!!! A lot easier for me to help noobs poor little guys don‚Äôt have to think I‚Äôm trying to trap them anymore
---
The gauntlet isn't OP. The build surrounding them is. That build typically requires you to be nearly dead at all times. It's a pretty fair trade off, all things considered.
---
Yea you can mix and match indiviudal pieces, however they do all look like the same style of power armor. Like regardless what armor you put the plague paint on it switches it to the X01 style armor in appearence only. So it will look like you mashed together multiple power armor types if that matters to you.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs getting pushed past patch 9...said they‚Äôre still working out bugs
---
I am a gamer i dont do that becuse its shit, hardcore gamers will yes, but games are never or very rarely built around hardcore gamers.  
---
Im not saying its right but people hust need to have some patience

I wonder what whitesprings will look like next week

do you know where i can see the other horseman paints?

---
Don't see how I'm being "shitty." I've been very civil in my discussion, not even swearing. And I'm not quite sure what it is you're doubting, the fact that actually happened?
---
tse was nerfed to shit for all other guns but shotguns it was still viable ... cause it doubled the pellets and w/ splash damage could still pack a punch , but if this essentially cuts the baase damage in half from what it is now ... its going to make every shotgun in the game worthless minus bloody ones ....
---
ctrl + F  Fallout story
---

---
"you guys have phones right"
---
just use the holo in your pip. Same exact thing.
---
What about energy weapons and not doing any anti armor
---
Dude I could give a shit if some level 200 with way too much time on his hands wants to give me shit i most likely already have. I want npcs, I want meaningful, engaging quests with serious choices, I want a game that doesn't stutter and look 10 years old.
---
While you may be joking, it seems like the vendor will just have a randomized set of legendary items with various costs in script. Not like you *have* to spend any scripts til you find what you like.
---
I had turrets for a while but found they are  mostly useless. Half the time they don't even engage anything other than mole rats and when they do they rarely hit their mark.  If you have a large camp having one too alert you when there is trouble is ok, but anything more is a waste of budget in my opinion
---
One thing that is wrong about that tse didny double the pellets it added one which added more base damage
---
Power user and power patcher both max rank, all ranks of heavy weapon user, I had bear arms rank 1 and full charge maxed (2 ranks) but swapped them all for traveling pharm rank 3 and bandolier rank maxed. For luck, I'd reccomend bloody mess max rank, one gun army max rank and luck of the draw max rank.
---
Some gamers won't and some will do it non stop for hours. The problem is a large amount will and that makes your product look bad.
---
shouldnt hafta run around at 20% hp just so i can deal some decent damage with my primary weapon
---
I have bought a whole bunch of pointless plans because of the cap limit.
---
At least I can pass them off to friends or my other characters I guess.
---
So do you need two separate accounts to do it?
---
World of warcraft kid was epic
---
This would be pretty cool.
---
Just gotta make sure you've stocked the shop with items worth the trip!
---
I‚Äôve built a camp that can only be accessed from one direction then used 2 elevated missile launchers. I also have 1 heavy turret. Everything is always dead before it reaches the outer entrance to the compound lol.
---
"rear wheel drive" - kill 100 players with BE handmade wearing -8% from players -15% while standing set
---
I don't get this either. I keep mine unlocked. Why is locking even an option if people can't steal... or can they?
---
Well they have to "serve and protect" their own financial interests
---
Na man. I redownloaded the game and try to load up. Still got the same error message. I‚Äôve just cut the loss playa
---
This is now meta.
---
Of course it will be randomized. Mid to low-tier randomized.
---
I‚Äôm the same.   I‚Äôm in the Mire and it took a weekend to build my CAMP because of the landscape and architecture.   I‚Äôm not going to uproot it just to sell typewriters.  
---
I figure that I‚Äôll use it to sell items for select clientele  I. e. legendary stuff, serums, ammo, fusion cores, and power armor.  
---
I might just specialize in Power Armor and modding it.  There are always pieces that people are looking for.
---
Plus, I can build just about any weapon.   So maybe a Weapons, ammo, and PA shop...   the Mire is a good place for one of those....
---
Happens a ton since patch 8. If you are trying to join players in a team, you can fix it by having them dissolve the team and create a new one. Once they are out of the team they will show online.
---
They could limit the PvP to workshop area only, remove caps on death, so the only thing you can lose is the workshop itself and any junk you might be carrying.  As much as I'd like to see PvP removed completely from adventure mode, I doubt if Bethesda will go that far.
---
Alternatively, a non-PvP workshop contest initiates a defense event, and if the owner is MIA, and the person who initiated a contest clears the enemies, then they get ownership of the workshop.
---
TL;DR - Workshop contesting should be about resources and workshop ownership, not PvP and caps.
---
Dude I love it üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
as far as i know camp dmg gets finally disabled in adv mode. I guess I like the idea of being able to recover my loot after getting killed at encryptid event by the imposter sheepsquatch. Others still can get my junk but they have to lockpick it and risk a bounty. 
---
junk isnt worth much so its not a big deal to lose it but it is a RPG and especially at a group effort event it may lead to an interesting situation.
---
Saw a guy with an amazing flea market build on youtube search Miz Tracey on youtube she has ton of great vids
---
because
---
Then stay away from here and stop complaining
---
You don't reroll  and you don't buy weapon effects. You just scrap useless weapons for scribs and then you can buy random legendaries with random effects with that scribs.
---
The thing is, I‚Äôm on PS4 pro that‚Äôs hardwired to my router. Been playing since beta and never disconnected this much before. Nothing has changed at my end.....

Dude I got an update from Beth support a couple weeks ago saying that ‚Äúthey are still investigating and working towards a safe way to return the characters / account back to the world without issue. Be assured that as soon as this has been confirmed and is live an email will be sent to the registered .Net account to inform you straight away.‚Äù If you want proof and I‚Äôm not just talking crap feel free to dm me and I‚Äôll send you a screenshot of the response they sent meüëçüèºüòÅ
---
I just wanted to reroll a mod like Diablo 3  and/or add a random mod to a 1\* or 2\* item.  That and the surprise shotgun nerf really killed my enthusiasm for the game again after I just got back into it. These patch notes made me sad.
---
I was unaware the mods add storage thanx man!!! I was wondering where the ghost weight was from
---
yeah, we know that now.
---
I don't need to point out anything to you, OP already stated that it was a joke. Keep trucking buddy.

I should have started locking my doors when someone went and turned off every single light in my home and closed the doors. every single light in my full garage, 4 bedrooms, bathroom, living room and dining room, etc ...every light in every room.
---
Fucking. This. From Aid Supplies, to Junk, to recently starting to hoard legendaries and what not? My stash filled up today, and my inventory only lets me have like 15 points if carry weight to spare. I need to live in my power armor, and I am surviving on buffout and radstag meat to explore.
---
:D  
---
Up until you tell me that you're running an auto-rifles dodge build. Then I don't like how close we are.
---
Oof. You do realise it‚Äôs going to be lifted at some point?
---
sorry bad english , not double pellets but the extra pellet damage counts as the same damage as the other 5 pellets /then post nerf that was dropped from 100% to 25% but if they lessen the base damage of the original 5 by 50% then the additional pellet that is only doing 25% damage now will be even fucking less ....and this makes me a sad panda
---
Change your build. Shotguns are whack already. Can‚Äôt imagine using them after it gets nerfed
---
What's wrong with the pipe rifle?
---
I put 10 missile turrets on the roof of my very boxy house. 
---
Enough to take down any NPCs including the scorched beasts that hang out next to my house, occasionally manage to kill the PC who gets to close in survival mode (until they sneak in and blow up the generator). The update a while back really lowered the cost of turrets.
---
Yeah and they are highly priced so you cant reroll legendaries infinitely :x All that collecting of legendaries by some people that have "500" on every character will feel like useless time invested for some and we get another shitpost wave and complains about that xD
---
I have 2 accounts, I've heard you can do it with one with a little finagling
---
Eeesh.... i was hoping they'd mention something about those legacy energy weapons that'll vaporize ya even when they aren't vats criticaling ya.  That and maybe let us know if there arw more pvp servers so we can play again different people. Feels like we see the same under 75 names over and over again...
---
Yeah it is, but it was very poorly timed. It was announced almost simultaneously with them pulling their roadmap off their website because they wouldnt be able to stick to the timeline they set out. Reading between the lines it looks like Bioware is throwing in the towel. Im not sure that its necessarily the case, but its discouraging at the least.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt be able to 1 hit anything over level 10 really. This I wanna one hit everything attitude is just lazy.
---
I used to have 4 or 5 turrets. Now I have 2, based on where the enemies approach my camp. Just scrapped the 3rd one the other night.
---
I could probably get away with none, but I like them as an alarm so I can go out and shoot. Plus I'd rather keep enemies away from my structure so that I have fewer repairs. Plus I like for my garden to have some protection. 
---
Many people have none. I suppose it would depend on your location and personal preference. Some have said they don't want to give up XP to their turrets for killing AI enemies.
---
Just a heads up in case you didn‚Äôt already know, the custom name only shows for you, not for other players.
---
lol already changed my build when they nerfed TSE ...dont really wanna do it again ....would rather just play something else at that point...
---
Events like that you should always put your junk away in your stash box. Make a run to the nearest train station and stash everything.
---
Nah, I'm not moving my home.  I've been here for months, and gone through many iterations to get everything to how I want it.  Plus my location makes fast traveling around the map easier.  People can come to me if they want to buy.  I'm not anticipating there being a mad rush of people buying from each other anyways.
---
Nah you just put a post up acting like you‚Äôre anything but a total scrub because you spam stealthboys, I felt like enlightening you.
---
No go back to server hopping vendors for those stealthboys scrubbo, you‚Äôre gonna need them!
---
The last few times I've been soloing it and prime gets nuked, I've been getting team invites from other down there, so I join the team until it's over.  I thought that was a good idea...you get the extra XP for being on a team, and if you get booted you can join back with your team.  I had never thought of that until that started happening.
---
They must've changed some stuff. I still have my PS4 but its pretty much exclusively used for Siege by my buddy. Built the PC never went back.

I think it‚Äôll just be another gambling thing . Put 3 tokens in and get a 1% chance for a good roll 24% decent roll and 75% you get shit on a shingle
---
You mean the opposite?
---
Works with both pistol and rifle perks. Same with meat hook and unarmed. I encourage everyone to use these so that they get fixed. Bugs get fixed faster if the community uses them to exploit
---
Who deals in caps anymore? Peasants do. Real men deal in Pre-war money.
---
Well there's no rerolling and the legendaries get turned in for scripts and all we know is you can buy "items" with Scripts... No word on what "items" entails. Is it pre spec'd legendary weapons and armor, or is it legendary mods to add to weapons and armor...
---
Bethesda has been amazing at listening to feedback with this game
---
That‚Äôs awesome I want to try lol
---
But they can just ignore you...
---
Like most systems, this isn't designed for the bleeding edge types. It's designed for your average player who wants new legendaries, not someone who is trying to squeeze an extra 2 Dps out of their TSE minigun
---
Code reseller, probably kinguin. Or mmoga.net, I usually browse several resellers. Bought it before the Steam release though.
---
What did they change in survival?
---
Not if you take ever workshop in ever server you go to
---
Technically bloodied is currently heavily relied on what looks like a bug to some degree:
---
Radiation is decreasing usable health instead of maximum health, this breaks multiple game mechanics that depend on current health for calculations such as perks and armour that uses stimpacks under threshold.
---
It just happened that Bloodied mechanic is in players favor in this case, so people don't see it as bug &gt;_&gt;
---
I did the Scorch Beast Queen for the first time finally, and the body disappeared after being vaporized lol.  No loot
---
AFAIK, Camp damage was reduced down to 0 with the last patch.
---
Lol, of course you do. I love your zig while everyone else zags style, Karth.
---
I haven't played in awhile they changed the caps from 200% to 25%. I get it 200 was to much but at least make it 100%
---
Been preparing since it was revealed with the road map... I have a stash full of useless 3 stars and some 2 stars. :( Now I play the waiting game for a bit more.
---
r/DMT has lots of great sacred geometry posts
---
I want to sell plans and mods only (for now). I spent quite some time creating a cool vending CAMP 200 meters from the Whitespring station (next to the power plant, as it has some raider-like structures which really suit the camp). However, not that much people pass by and recently a lot of people build their CAMP next to the Whitespring station, which I understand, but it‚Äôs gonna be a problem. Would be easier if we could ‚Äúshow‚Äù our camp or vending machine on the map so it gets interesting for people to check it out.
---
Next to that I just hope we can set our own prices and that these will be saved for everytime we log in.
---
Plague one is gone already. But that‚Äôs okay it you look like a walking herpes sore lol. War rider is available for 4 more days.
---
200 meters is 218.72 yards
---
K.
---
I mean I guess be that guy
---
Are you talking about the Imposter Sheepsquatch Event or the real Sheepsquatch event? I run a bloodied build with a bloodied LMG and full heavy gun perks. The real sheepsquatch goes down in a minute or two.
---
Place your conduit on the corner point of the wall and you‚Äôre good. It‚Äôll awkwardly move around but it will eventually go green to place and you can link two sides at a 90 degree bend
---
Also puts more stress on the servers, you'd think they'd realize that by now.
---
Oic. I dont play survival for caps. I only play to add a little excitement.
---
I really loved everytime it went up
---
Aaaaaaaaand‚Ä¶. you feel the need to tell everyone... why?
---
So, go, man. Go play something else then. Or is just the attention you require?
---
yeah they give us the ability to maximize daily caps by pooling the vendor cap limit to 1400....but then they do this?
---
are the only 2 on this sub who see the issue here?
---
I really like this idea
---
And we are also getting the backpack quest line where we can trade badges in for camp stuff, yes?
---
Been rockin the same TSE shotgun since level 78. Im level 200 and still rock it. Im just tired of crappy legendary drops. RNG needs to be fixed.
---
My Weightless left leg with 25 rad resist, the 25 shows up under item stats, right under ballistic and energy dmg. But my Weightless left arm which is suppose to have 25 rad resist, the number doesn‚Äôt show up at all.
---
Currently, that means I'd be able to buy at least 2 items.
---
I mean this makes it better but I still don't think it is viable. Fuel consumption is still way too high
---
And yep, the overseer camp would be a nice spot as a lot of people use it to trade / drop plans. But wouldn‚Äôt it screw up the experience of new players? I loved finding out about all the gear and heavier weapons the first 40 levels or so.
---
Cool idea bro
---
I love how they have a second model for razorgrain that's even LARGER for some reason XD
---
It's tough enough to find space for the "small" version
---
That‚Äôs something at least
---
What? No, that just means you don‚Äôt like the way they have it set out for you. You can go around the rules and do whatever you want, but it‚Äôs not up to them to bow to you... they have the way they want it, and if you don‚Äôt like it you‚Äôre FREE to find other ways. They don‚Äôt OWE you anything.
---
Also, server hopping is a time-honored tradition. Fallout 76 is just one of a long line of MMOs to have people do it. Again, still entirely optional.
---
Then play something else lol
---
I don't know.  
---
It is pure speculation of how player vending could work in tandem with the legendary vendor, based solely on my interpretation of the publicly available information on the how the legendary vendor works.  
---
With a dose of "and it may mitigate some other issues as well' thrown in.
---
Given some of the problems I've read about with player trading as it exists, and knowing there is an ebay (et al) real money market for in game weapons (and the potential abuses and fraud therin) - outside of BGS control, and which may be detrimental to the overall health/perception of the game, how does BGS fix it?  
---
In game Legendary values (Scrips) are based on the number of  \*, not the player perception of the actual item.  
---
A 1\* L30 rolling pin has the same value as a 1\* L30 drill has the same value as a 1\* L30 SMG.  
---
With an additional modifier for the level of the weapon.
---
And if that's good enough for the legendary vendor, why not the player vendor as well?
---
Previous iterations of FO had fixed prices no matter where you traded.
---
Controls prices (moderates in game economy), reduces out of game trading for real money, eliminates the "I grid and grind and all I get are these (expletive) 1\* ... "
---
Looks like prices are higher for USA region. Thanks
---
Does anyone know if this will also effect laser beam splitters?
---
Go rifleman/commando and find a good TS/AA handmade/lever action/10mm smg you will melt stuff
---
It's for the super mutants and cryptids.
---
That's probably everyone. That's how much you get unless you engage super duper.
---
Damn it, I knew I should've held on to my legendaries! I didn't know the patch would be this soon. 
---
Back to the farm.
---
awesome thank you.
---
yeah but dont forget! bethesda just allowed us to maximize caps by pooling the vendors cap stash to the daily 1400, thereby exponentially increasing the amount of caps people get every day (as we dont have to travel around to each vendor anymore- which WAS a cap dump as we had to fast travel to do it)
---
so they created the increased inflation!
---
but now they are trying to undo that? 
---
maybe they DO need to hire an economist
---
On free range earlier today no one helped defend the cattle, I had to herd and defend while they watched, we made it to the squatch spawn with one brahmin at 25% suddenly all 5 of the randoms wanted to "help". The squatch didn't even spawn yet and the brahmin got killed. We failed and everyone started angry emoting.
---
That... Sucks...
---
Lmaoü§£ü§£ü§£
---
My guess too. Just wanted to light a flame under this reddits ass so we can someday lol
---
Bruh do you even perk cards
---
thats why you main something that was originally trash. im a big guns build and have decided to do so since level 20ish. the auto big guns (like mini gun) where hot garbage way earlier on, now with the right prefixes they are way better
---
yup, they are pulling a bungie and not balancing pvp apart from pve
---
it really ruins things when they do this in games...
---
ITV should be communicated through emotes and voice recordings until text chat is added.
---
**Event: Free Range**. The Legendary Sheepsquatch(es) often (2 out of 3 events at least) do not have any legendary loot, not even a Drill or Syringe (just the regular sheepcrap). I fought them several times at all 3 farm locations. Winning, losing doesn't make any difference.
---
I have armor that grants me 100% protection from fall damage.  I zipped around the area for a bit, and then my game stuck me into the ground.  Had to fast travel to get out of it.
---
We used the infinite carry weight exploit.
---
Was doing the photograph 10 players challenge. I walk up to this team just hanging around their base. Whip out my camera and wave hello before I snap their picture. All of a sudden I am standing on top of a mountain. 10/10
---
So much this!!! I am running an arcade off of terminals right now but this would be so much better.
---
I would pay atoms for this big-time.
---
Also if you haven't seen it I am running a Zeta Invaders Tournament tonight on PC if the holotape games are your gig.
---
dude im a diehard fallout fan , hell I run the fallout modding group on facebook and moderate 4 others ...really trying to love this game but fuck they are making it very difficult with the constant fuck ups.....
---
something similar here, ended up underground just falling until I crashed. Shame because the camera with emotes go hand in hand
---
Grinding is different it requires alot of player interaction and you need a mic to make trades easier. You could save up for serums plans, marsupial, twisted muscle, adrenal, and speed deamon etc. Sell well and are not too material intensive takes about 17days of vendor selling to get 1 plan. But they seem to sell well when vending especially to med level players. Then by time you hit cap Max you end up trading for over powered stuff.
---
Really? How much is it? I always thought we germans were unlucky with the price policy of computer games. On mmoga it is still 14,99 ‚Ç¨.
---
I‚Äôm allowed to be a smart ass once in a while right?  Sorry dude.
---
Is Legendary Scrip shared between all your characters? Or is it a per character currency?
---
I never knew the xbox app would let you do this.  Thank you!
---
You can store it I assume. That's a more minor annoyance than a loss.
---
There is even a ‚Äúcome take a picture with me‚Äù emote haha. Awesome quality control as usual.
---
No sir. I switch between a sneak Rifleman/Commando build.
---
"LoOk aT HoW WELL I ManaGE My ResOUrcES, loSErs!"
---
and PS thats kinda what reddit is for lol ...just FYI ...when 90% of the subreddit is people bitching about them fucking shit up every patch ...who should you be talking to? ...me or the creators of the game? telling people to just deal with it ...is kinda stupid
---
It's political correctness gone mad.
---
Black Rider hasn't dropped yet. Its my backup in case I don't end up with enough atoms for war.
---
If it wasn't for duping, most people wouldn't have god level weapons or armor. But...I have an instigating Grognak axe that cuts through the ghouls at Whitespring like I'm harvesting razorgrain. And a 3*lvl 68 Scortched literally walked into my camp with it. Then I got a Bloodied Handmade. Again, super lucky. After 400 hours and 145 levels, I broke down and bought my tse combat shotgun and my tse handmade from reddit. I don't blame the game, per-say. But 98% of the legendaries we get are rubbish. I don't know what to expect from the Purveyer, but at this point anything would be an improvement.
---
‚ÄúNothing is certain except death and taxes‚Äù
---
ATOM store profits &gt; Bug fixes
---
I can buy a EU key for $15 or so, but US keys are closer to $40 on the sites I've checked.
---
Then don‚Äôt scrap them until you have more information.
---
I still remember passing on it. Finally got one to drop from Atheon about a month before they nerfed it. That weapon was so perfectly broken.
---
Thanks, I know that one, and actually posted about it elsewhere in this thread.  It's not consistent, and I'm not a fan of diseases, so I try to avoid it (and yes I know about the sulfur fountain in WS).
---
I have tried it, and it does work, but not quite as reliable as a good old-fashioned...toxic, irradiated pool...
---
What are peoples favourites, I can't decide, they all look good, I am thinking of one of the last two. Not sold on War Rider ..
---
It's unlikely the caps teleport into wallet, so maybe the machine holds credits?
---
We pay taxes in America and our bridges are still in a frightening state of disrepair.
---
The fuck our taxes going?
---
Heh, my Primed Executioners Gattling plasma is called the Regicider. :)
---
It‚Äôs funny how the person complaining about a minor change in a video game is accusing others of being overly sensitive.
---
This has nothing to do with me or anything they "OWE" me. This is about business, marketing and publicity. Do you want your game known for having shitty game mechanics? The more features in a game like this the worse people will rip on it in social media. More people rip on it the less money you make. FO76 has too many shitty features like this which is why I can't get any of my friends to play.
---
You want my ign or?
---
Gotta love that ‚ÄúBioWare magic‚Äù.
---
I've been doing it, but it would be nice to have a specific conduit that bends
---
&gt; Hey Bethesda, can we pretty please get the ability to sink ~~crops~~ **all CAMP items** into the ground so they aren't floating?
---
FTFY I can't take a crap because I'm concerned about the stability of my port-a-john. 
---
My fences can't keep deathclaws out, the gap under them is so big.
---
All perimeter fencing is just about useless because it is all too long to find a flat enough spot to place it. **Anything that is meant to go on natural ground and not a foundation needs to have about 25% of its lower structure be capable of clipping through the ground.**
---
I'm lvl 185, been playing since beta. I've recently realized this as well. I now have a full set of mutant slayer armor and a nice AR. 
---
We've all been chasing that God roll pvp stuff but all forgot about pve God roll
---
there's a train station at Harper's Ferry?
---
Np!
---
What
---
Some diseases last an hour.
---
Why do people use a full set of chameleon armor? I only use one piece and I get the effect. Does having more than 1 piece allow you to stay invisible while moving or is there some other benefit to stacking those?
---
**L O D S OF E M O N E**
---
...Die
---
Added you. Thought I'm not very useful at sbq, silent sniper build with no legendary. But I have keykard and quest
---
Would love to say the background SB was talent, but nah, just lucky, my fav shot is this one - 
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/36ZAl8D](https://imgur.com/a/36ZAl8D) 
---
Sadly the Missile taking off in the background looks really janky, but still a lucky snap
---
I have full right to be mad about terrible servers. There's giving praise to Beth for good things, then there's flat out fanboying about it and worshipping it. There's always room to criticize something you love because you want it to be better.
---
It's not world loot, it's on the body of a tourist with some other things that will trigger the quest. The issue is that finding the tourist body is kind of rare it seems since it spawns sporatically at 'tourist' locations. Like I found mine at the water park laying against a car in the middle of the parking lot. You could just server hop until he appears because it will spawn right in front of you there.
---
It's not minor it's game changing
---
ikr .. smh .. what can I say ..
---
You have two options with a maxed out STR to gain the defensive bonus of Blocker.  The least offensive is to sacrifice a QoL perk like Traveling Pharmacy, Pack Rat, etc for a three rank blocker card.  An unarmed build really only needs 9 str to max out DPS perks, but of course 15 is preferable.  That means you have 6 points to mess with.  Personally, I'd keep Traveling Pharmacy, as chems add up quickly and contribute significantly to weight issues.  Pack Rat, Sturdy Frame, Strong Back and pretty much all the other weight reducing perks contribute far less in terms of actual "stripped down/light as possible" carry weight.  You can sacrifice Pack Rat easily, since workbenches are pretty much everywhere and scrapped junk instantly becomes a fraction of its original weight.  The benefit from Blocker is far more important when you're getting gangbanged by a pack of ghouls or a couple yao-guai.  If you need to fast travel, just pop Pack Rat or other weight reduction perks back on, unload at your stash and prioritize offense/defense when you need to fight again.  I only have a 190 carry limit on my sniper, and swap out traveling pharmacy for blocker when I do a Whitespring or Burrows loop.  I'm overencumbered immediately just with the weight of 40 stimpaks, 10 radshield and 15 radaway, but I also have Lone Wanderer and a couple pieces of AP regen legendary armor that recharges my AP rapidly.  AG in the low 20's doesnt hurt either.  Just standing still to aim and shoot at a small pack of ghouls usually leaves me with a full bar afterwards.
---
They should charge the buyer 10% on top of what the item is selling for as the fee and not take it from the sale and the person selling the item. 
---
For example, I‚Äôm selling an item for 1000 caps. Buyer pays 1100 for my item. Bethesda gets 100 and I get my 1000 caps.
---
haha thanks!
---
Yup I told myself I'll just play FO76 until RDRO gets its shit together... guess what I'm still doing.
---
Anthem is in very bad place now - deep loot issues, players leaving in droves, Twitch viewership in barely hundreds, goalposts getting shifted indefinitely and this just in: lead managers no longer working for BW ( [https://twitter.com/gamblemike/status/1123694127005220873?s=21](https://twitter.com/gamblemike/status/1123694127005220873?s=21) )
---
Super Duper only boosts the base amount, so the max is 56. But that‚Äôs still a lot of fuel though.
---
Any change in a video game is minor.
---
He's not dead
---
My girlfriend is afraid of bridges for that very reason. Canada is in the same boat sadly. Though from what I've heard, not as bad here.
---
At least most of our taxes go into health care though. So it's harder to complain about the disrepair, knowing most other places have the disrepair and none of the health care benefits.
---
You probably should sleep, as your title states "player reading".
---
I like the pub idea. I have a lot of drinks stored up. Whitesprings maybe, block those Missile launch homes near the golf shop and set up there. Offer refreshment and call it The 19th hole.
---
I picked up a bloodied Mr handy buzzblade someone dropped at a queen fight.  Still getting used to running a low health build, but omg this thing is crazy.
---
Ya to real life but in my free time it's a big change to my favorite mode
---
Oh ok what system
---
Kind of off topic bit it's always hard for me to keep a straight face when someone is angry and they say "but fucking".
---
I wonder of their suits were incorporated into their bodies. Like that story about the morbidly obese person who sat on a couch for so long they had to cut the fabric to avoid ripping it out of their flesh. 
---
So by the time you removed all of their suit, you would have done massive damage to their flesh and still would know what they truly looked like naked.
---
Any update for suspended accounts?
---
I have used a mix of turrets and the punji boards. If you know where the enemies spawn, you can place the nail boards down and the turrets will finish them off.
---
It was, was there in the beginning cutting my grinding teeth lol.
---
If you don't think you'll use them , they can be scrapped for steel and other materials. So don't just drop them. also you can sell them to the vendors for caps.
---
Do you need to make caps? I can make max caps in one or two sessions selling weapons armor and aid.
---
If on PC sanityii
---
I like the solution of only pvp in the workshop build area, in adventure land.
---
The problem I see with how it is now is, someone can contest your workshop while their team mate shoots you down anywhere on the map. Once they kill you, the first guy can step out of the workshop circle and not actually take the workshop. rinse and repeat until you server hop.
---
As a workshop owner, you have no way of bowing out of the fight, at any point, even after being killed, except to server hop. At least with the workshop boundaries, if someone tries to take your workshop and you hop back to defend and realize you are out gunned and/or get killed, you can leave the area and let them have it and they cannot continue to kill you.
---
If it‚Äôs any consolation that really seems to be a server death message.   I‚Äôve done that with friends on server, we‚Äôre not even together grouped or whatnot, and we all lose connection.
---
True!
---
Although what is this sulphur fountain you speak of :0
---
No I just want the caps to pay for ammo and fast travel
---
Read the inside the vault they say it there
---
It may look like I'm AFK at the Encryptid but I assure you I'm just staring at a frozen screen waiting for my turn to move.
---
there's player vending now? haven't logged in in weeks
---
You just said Reddit is for bitching. That‚Äôs exactly why I wouldn‚Äôt listen to reddit when making a game. All it is is bitching and moaning.
---
Remember when people were bitching about constant updates? Now all they cry about is ‚ÄúI want another patch!‚Äù
---
Yes! I think i need to start doing this as well I wish I could get an unyielding set with some type of pve benefits tho!!
---
Have you managed to get a new one? I've got one lay around somewhere.
---
**HOW DARE THEY** suggest improvements, **DIE COMMIES!**
---
No they don‚Äôt say jack and we should not be charged to use something where are the damn caps going? So now I have charge a extra 10 percent on anything I sell to compensate for it
---
To pay for the vending machine and accompanying services.
---
I‚Äôve also been saving.
---
My stash box is full of 3* legendaries weighing less than 3 weight units each.
---
But I don‚Äôt want the system to be re-roll based.
---
Did you accidentally use an emote? Because that will do it.
---
You should try taking Travel Agent, Ammosmith, and Super Duper. Ammo is expensive to buy but cheap to make.
---
On paper maybe, but given Energy Resistance doesn't have any equivalent for Armor Piercing that Ballistic does, does that really play out in practice?
---
I‚Äôve seen quite a few camps (even open ones) destroyed for no reason and even read on here more... 
---
Must be true players that got there asses handed to them In PvP mode and now back in adventure mode...lol
---
Yeah, looking at it a few minutes ago. Super excited. :D
---
I'm told that War also never changes.
---
Also Scrounger.
---
Yeah, I just did exactly that got a load of scrap and kept hold of what I think I'd use in the future, thanks! Whilst im here asking for help what the hell is this karma about? I've read a few post and that word gets thrown around alot.. üôÉ
---
If you follow the tracks on the map, slightly west there is a boarded up train station, if you peek in through some of the broken windows you can see the shelves that were behind the legendary vendor in the trailer.
---
Ik but I only have a few hours to play a night so I want to pvp when I'm on because that what I like to do
---
I accidentally did this once with Uranium Fever; was farming mutations at about level 50 and when I went in for a shower, bam! Rewards. Putting on the power armor just seems like overkill though, since you only have to be inside the mine to get the credit.
---
Pro'lly
---
Same issue here, done it twice and nothing.
---
The more the merrier, having a party increases the number of legendary monsters!
---
The camera is buggy. You can use it with emotes to randomly fast travel.
---
5 more days! 5 more days! 5 more days!
---
It's great to know how much longer I'll have to hold out trying to cram all this stuff in my stash. I keep having to make tough choices of whether to get rid of another legendary item, or deal without certain supplies. 
---
But only til next week...
---
again
---
Is that with the laser splitter? The explosive should apply to each beam, so in that case it would indeed pack quite a punch
---
Exactly this and my thought as well! I see many getting their arses handed to them now coming back to adventure mode to grief...
---
Glad this is fixed!
---
I know :D but it happens. The element of being a thief and a way to retaliate kinda fits a rpg game in my opinion.
---
I could build a mountain from my 1 star legendary wood armor.
---
Bugs definitely need fixing.
---
However there is a pattern, and is not flattering.
---
There are in the region of 120+ bugs reported, documented and in some cases the solution added to the report. They have not even been acknowledged, let alone fixed.
---
They fixed the bug that caused fusion cores to 'replenish' upon login/server hop but forgot to fix the bug that causes ravenous drain on fusion cores when using VATS/Power Attack.
---
They rebalanced two shot to 1.25 shot but left the 'spread' untouched.
---
They rebalanced Demolition Expert with no regard or thought given to actual explosive weapons.
---
They fixed some PvP related malarkey with stealth and broke the mechanic in the process for PvE. As of today is still broken except they introduced a further bug with the last patch. I guess fixing that is not urgent.
---
I could go on but I think you get the idea.
---
Said that is just fruitless; is like when a new film from a beloved franchise is released and the writing is shit but people love the franchise so much that they keep filling the gaps themselves in order to make out that the script makes some sort of sense - often, sadly enough, doing a better job than the writers themselves.
---
Although this by itself is endearing it gets to the point that frustrates the living daylights out of me.
---
Either way, yes, you are right, bugs need fixing, but all bugs, not just the fun ones.
---
r i p
---
Anthem's gameplay takes a giant steaming pile on FO76's, which is where those posts came from. No one could have predicted they would drop the ball that badly.
---
DO NOT trade in legendary items for scrips... yet! Why are they letting us do it early? I feel that they will base the shops on how many scrips people have in their inventory when it goes live.
---
Ultra light mods. Weightless becomes 0 except the torso pieces. 
---
Just remember to collect fiberglass aluminum and cork.
---
I agree. I hope this isn't just one more mechanic that encourages server hopping.
---
Reroll seems to be a perfect system that so many other games implement. It's exactly the same as having the shop contain random items, but you reroll your own item instead of rerolling the server.
---
I hope they let us reroll items.
---
If I had to guess, bugs. They delayed player vending last month due to issues they never told us about. Back then they also didn‚Äôt mention the 10% thing. Maybe it was something similar to that bug I vaguely remember from new Vegas where you could buy one bullet then sell it, then you got all their caps (I know I‚Äôm butchering that, it‚Äôs just an example). It may have been something like if you sold an item to a player and then bought it back at the same value, it confused the game and duped the item, so they made it to where that couldn‚Äôt happen by decreasing the overall caps you receive. I‚Äôm sure it was some coding issue like that, but I‚Äôm no programmer and don‚Äôt work behind the scenes at Bethesda, just guessing
---
Great question. 
---
Do shotgun perks affect laser rifles with the splitter? If not, I would assume not, but I suppose we'll just have to wait and see, since I don't believe it mentioned it.
---
I'm curious about Flechettes.
---
Oh my dear lad...(or lass)...
---
Round...gazebo? out the back door of WS, before you get to the tennis courts (and ghoul-farming central).  There's a drinking fountain there.  Some say it's nirvana, or the elixir of life.  Some say it's just toxic water with fluoride.  A few, they whisper that it's panacea.
---
It's clean water that cures disease, go drink it.
---
It's a shotgun, an already devastating weapon IRL, that fires explosive bullets.  Why wouldn't that shred someone?  Granted they were very overpowered before.  This seems unnecessary.  If anything they should buff other weapons instead of picking on shotguns so much.
---
The footprint for the vending machine looks a bit larger than I'd hoped.
---
You can add all the features in the world, and fix every conceivable bug, and someone will complain.
---
Once everything is perfect, someone will complain 'it's too easy' while someone else complains 'it's too hard'.
---
If you can get it down to just those 2 complaints, it's as perfect as you can get.  Until then, you're just SOL reading the forums.
---
That's funny, considering I had a tse pump action before the nerf. Key word had, I sold it because the game became boring within a half hour of trading for it. One headshot to a lvl 65 scorchbeast that landed took it right out, although granted I did have it primed. I doubt the double barrel would be much different, but you are correct, I have never used specifically a tse double barrel.
---
Ah, both times I've done it there's been 2 of us unloading 50 cals on it so it's been a coin toss I guess. Unlucky both times. The funny thing is I ran in to 3 of them in the wild yesterday. Not one today.
---
It is mostly stable and a lot of fun.  Pick up the (deathclaw) gauntlet again and try it out.
---
Must be me. I dont even know of this event
---
I like to budget out my time. Sometimes I‚Äôll use the first hour or last hour I play to resource gather or I‚Äôll just do what I want for a few days and use an entire session a week to gather up what I think I‚Äôll need for the week ahead. Think of it as a small investment in yourself and what makes you happy. I guarantee It will make your play sessions more enjoyable.
---
IGN dannyvrsty. See you soon
---
It‚Äôs planned to be released May 9th
---
I've been using a tse Shotgun for awhile. Please tell me which button I press to do this?  It hasn't worked since they were nerfed hard.
---
He is to me... you‚Äôll have to ask him for the details.
---
my razorgrain is the worst part of my camp :\[
---
Yeah I knew about that part, which has some advantages I guess, but thanks for the reply.  I just want to use the skull mask on my blackbird armor when the death skin releases
---
"i JuSt SeLl eVeRYtHinG tO vEnDoRs." 
---
I bet most of us are maxing out stash space because we are hoarding legendaries for the new system. I never used to go over either until worthless legendaries became worthy legendaries.
---
Which part? Or are you telling me the guy I was responding to was exaggerating and I took it seriously?
---
Nah to much I'll just kill people
---
After scrapping a chair I was able to place 2 wires (I was 100% budget at the time). So that might give you an idea on how much they cost.
---
Great question!!!!
---
Right.
---
But how long until they start selling scrips for cash in the Atom shop?
---
Sounds a lot like they fit the same criteria as repair packs.
---
yes - does this mean they are nerfing them again?  lol I thought they already did that...
---
I imagine this will be a lot less of a problem once people can offload the crappy legendaries they are hoarding.
---
Sometimes I wish the devs would remember that it is PvE players who are keeping the Fallout franchise alive, that keep fixing and modding Bethesda games so they remain fresh and appealing more than 7 years after release, that are porting old and beloved games to newer engines so people can enjoy them more than a decade after publishing.
---
I for one am starting to resent PvP.
---
I use a TSE combat shotgun, I waste a ton of ammo killing things.  Not sure if we're playing the same game?
---
Be careful you might end up owing at the end of the year
---
Anything to increase grind/play time. That's what it's for.
---
Oh man, thanks for the head's up! I haven't made much use of the camera yet since my gallery is almost full anyhow. 
---
 My game just seems to crash every time I press R1 to expand the menu?
---
Doesn't prevent scrapping because of a mismatch in client vs. server inventory index, or does it?
---
Sorry, maybe *people* shouldn't build around a known bug, you pedantic little shit
---
I still have the only explosive energy weapon I ever found, a nocturnal explosive gatling plasma. It's hilarious how powerful it can get
---
So you would rather ruin the enjoyment of what other players like to do because you‚Äôre not getting exactly what you want?
---
Theres a set place at the end of the tracks west of harpers ferry for it. All the weapons are on shelves and you can see them. I dont see that anywhere else.
---
Oh thank god. 
---
We're twins, and not the same person.
---
Left mouse button, or I believe r1 on a controller
---
Your build is off.  I have a buddy that can walk through my repeated shotgun blasts and merc me with one hit from a gauntlet.
---
The camera is a anti pvp tool
---
Yeah I haven‚Äôt served hopped but I‚Äôm close to that achievement and all I‚Äôm doing is hacking the one in the WS resort each time I visit there which is 2-3 times a day.
---
I love my explosive plasma gatling and wouldn't sell it for any amount of caps
---
I always lock everything, even at workshops but I have a separate building so other players can use it if they happen to come across my camp
---
How much of your camp budget did that take?
---
It could happen, but it‚Äôs unlikely someone will do that. It‚Äôs happened to me, but given how many people I‚Äôve had at my semi-permanent camps, it‚Äôs such a low percentage, less than 1% did anything destructive. One jackass in a nearby camp threw an artillery grenade inside my shop once, but I saw it happen and hopped servers real quick, only 2 shells hit and destroyed some stuff. But if you don‚Äôt have enough junk to make minor repairs, what are you even doing in the game?
---
I always leave my known plans and recipies in bags and trash cans around the stations
---
Caps sink.
---
Pretty much every single MMO with an auction house has a fee.
---
If there are no caps sinks the value of caps will slowly go down. 
---
Vending machines will become a major source of income, having a fee helps with inflation. 
---
In my opinion Fo76 needs even more caps sinks... If we have tons of cap sinks a TSE energy weapon will naturally go down in price but it will keep it's value. (value =/= price) This thing also helps with the caps limit. 
---
Read more on inflation if you're actually curious. 
---
A 10% fee won't stop inflation but
---
They mentioned in an "inside the vault" that they would be bringing protections for unwanted camp destruction. Your camp cant be harmed unless you have an opened pvp versus that player or if you have contested a workshop
---
I am sorry but I won' t be able to reespond for next next few houres since I have to do something, IO thought this might be handy for any people that want to help us
---
I only recently found out that has a beam splitter. Suddenly my nocturnal gatling plasma can take out the impostor sheepsquatch solo
---
IDK my spare aid is probably at about 200lbs, I don't think the backpacks are going to cure that. 
---
My stash problem goes away on the 9th when I can finally trade in all those crappy legendaries I've been saving.
---
It will show on the map that you are selling items, says so in the patch notes
---
There‚Äôs almost always one at the fissure site east of Watoga. It‚Äôs dead but it counts.
---
For me, No Man's Sky was such a vague offering whenever it was shown that I didn't pay much attention to it, and I wasn't surprised that it couldn't followthrough.  They stuck with it, made it better, and now I own it, even though I've yet to play it because 76 hogs the "chill out game" slot.
---
&gt;If there are no caps sinks the value of caps will slowly go down.
---
it's already non-existant
---
Ah, I see what you mean now haha sorry about that. Hopefully, that will never come. I feel like repair is not in the same league as basically buying legendary loot. If it DOES happen, the uproar would definitely be heard
---
Isnt the pionner scout questline and backpacks supposed to come out may 7th??? I thought vending was gonna be last according to the roadmap?
---
Sarcasm seems to be lost in text here.  My shotgun can't kill entire groups in one shot unless they're super low level enemies.  It used to, but got nerfed.  I'm fine with that one.
---
why can't we have all the switches and controls from Fallout 4? i liked making my circuit pathways
---
What bug?
---
I was also wondering about this. . .
---
Did anthem have a whole line of youtubers making a living off glorifying every mistake the game made though?
---
So bethesda should simply just say fuck it and give up? It's a thing that's improving the economy, just like they said...
---
No idea but I've never seen a full set before, looks good!
---
I personally don't care that Bethesda went back on their word and changed something in their design slightly. I can't wait to see the system either way. I'm saying that the lead developer said one thing, people thought it would work that way, and I replied to the idiot who was so shocked people were thinking a new system would work a certain way and thinks they were making **wild assumptions**. It's like when Todd said "it just works", but it clearly didn't just work, hence Todd lies. There's nothing wrong with being wrong, but stop putting down people because they didn't get what they expected. I literally post evidence about why people are upset showing why they thought the system would work a certain way, and I get downvoted and people say I'm wrong. Now that's the internet I know and hate.
---
You forgot the period at the end of your sentence.         Just being my pedantic self.
---
I have 400lbs of plans... I can't wait.
---
I mean, I don‚Äôt like wasting materials on repairing stuff griefers do... I‚Äôm also mostly worried about my decontamination shower considering the materials it would take to repair it.
---
I am a water operator and I love this idea üëç
---
Star Wars Battlefront 2? When I switched over to that for 6 weeks I was trying to roll when I came back as well.
---
Nah I've been playing dark souls 3 a ton
---
&gt; But, raising the limit to some arbitrary limit would simply result in players hitting that limit right away, and then THAT would become the new "too small".
---
Agree wholeheartedly. What they need to do is give us outlets to prevent us from just hoarding things, like the new legendary vendor. I can't think of fanything else that is extremely demanding of stash space, but which we actually need to store. You can fit week's worth of ammo and aid in an 800lb stash, even with saving a handful of alternate guns, armors, and PAs. 
---
Resource management is part of this game, and increasing stash size to higher amounts just takes that aspect out.
---
Still a pretty awesome picture overall.  Lucky shots nearly always render the best responses imo. I really do think the launch/scorchbeast sequence is quite possibly the coolest thing I've seen from this game though.
---

---
Group play. Id rather have it be an option than not. It should give you a notification that you are in oacifist mode when you load into survival though.
---
Fantastic! Thank you. This is exactly what I was looking for. ^_^d If possible, would it be ok for me to take a picture/screenshot of your shop? I can grab it myself when you're playing next, or I can use any you already have and credit it appropriately.
---
We pay so much in taxes that we have a surplus of money and can't figure out how to spend it.... Roads are still shit though. This is the worst I've seen them. 
---

---
Is it forest or urban camo?
---
I have started a new character and the achievements are still locked. (I have completed requirements for locked achievements)
---
Edit: parenthesis addition
---
Forest
---
I have a double-barrel explosive too, and it‚Äôs overpowered as fuck, to the point that it completely distorted that character‚Äôs build. I hated using it, but I felt I had to because it was so ridiculously effective. 
---
Now I can maybe finally leave it in the stash and go back to heavy weapons.
---
I've been crafting and saving ammo for this very purpose :(
---
I'm pretty sure volunteering to help you get around a bannination, could possibly result in a bannination.
---
aw I was hoping it would be greener. Mask as well. Well thanks for the picture and I guess it doesnt matter that much for me then. :(
---
Y‚Äôall need some M√∂thman
---
If they weren't limited time, everyone would say 'Well, I don't have enough caps now, but I'll start saving up and get it when I do'.
---
Since it's limited time, they now say 'Well, I don't have enough caps now, and it's gone in a week, better get the credit card out'.
---
Not being cynical, that's literally the reason, to get you to spend a 'little' extra cash for the things that are in demand.
---
Seems like every game has flipped on itself in the past 6 months. F76 started out looking like it was on its deathbed already, and despite the shit like repair kits and watoga nerf it's still an overall positive experience. Meanwhile I slept through the evening so I could wake up for the midnight launch of black ops 4, and spent the 7 hours before my classes playing blood of the dead. Yet now black ops 4 is so horrendous with its recent updates that I'm seeing a large amount of traffic of people going back to ww2 instead. All of the games that were hyped and praised on launch seem to be doing rather poorly now. I'm not necessarily happy to see any of them fail, I'd love to see a thriving industry where nothing but great content is produced. I just wish people weren't so reactionary with any new releases because then situations like this happen
---
Shh...
---
May as well just use a commie whacker.  With all the weapon nerfing it will end up as the strongest weapon in game.
---
The vending machine costs atom correct?
---
Yeah I dont get it either it's not like it's actually helping bethesda or anything lmao.
---
No doubt.
---
But it seems like the shitty RNG legendary grind could be interpreted as being inconvenient. I've personally played nearly 800 hours and have yet to find any good roll gear.....I could see people getting frustrated and reaching for their wallets. This is what videogames have become.
---
Oh now you‚Äôve struck a nerve. Yes... when it comes to the decon shower, fuck people that destroy that. It‚Äôs been the only thing that got destroyed multiple times and I had to spend days without it grinding to get materials together again. I now put the decon shower in storage until I need it, then store it again. Totally feel your pain there, but everything else is simple enough to repair. And like I said, most players won‚Äôt mess with bases, but it‚Äôs always a risk
---
&gt; the varmint rifle weilding assholes in RDO too.
---
All I could imagine was Sunny Smiles
---
There are other ways to annoy people other than destroying, the locked effect is for water purifiers and restricting access to farms and stuff. It would have been to not use on doors if it can be used on purifiers and resource generators.
---
except they're wrong? a 10% fee means jack when most high-end trades are exactly that, trades. no caps involved.
---
nothing's gonna change because caps are a commodity for convenience. people are gonna sell ammo, junk and aid. not godrolls. if anything they're making things worse because less caps are going into the robotic void.
---
10% of  1100 is 110. You‚Äôll get 890 caps out of this.
---
Yeah I can already tell you that no one here cares, and a lot of people would prefer that those who were banned, stay banned. We will never know for sure whether there is actually anyone who was "wrongfully banned" personally I'm one of those people who doubts that anyone who was banned is innocent, just because I've seen a lot of posts of people going "but I didn't dupe" and when asked what they had, they had 100k+ Ultracite ammo. Which is impossible to obtain in such a short amount of time legitimately
---
I would really like this confirmed too! I haven't had any trouble with griefers yet and I'm in a pretty trafficked spot, but I worry about advertising my location opening up a can of worms :(
---
Had a lot of fun making it!
---
By far the best looking set in the game in my opinion. I use either combat or marine (depending on what I‚Äôm doing) purely because there are no legendary scout pieces. It‚Äôs a shame as given the option I‚Äôd go for scout any day.
---
Paging /u/Valseek hopefully - can you give us any insight or further updates about the delayed decoration update?
---
Does this mean there won‚Äôt be weapon racks or the ability to place things in shelves?
---
I think there was a lot of us questioning this specific line.
---
Hey, sorry for the late reply. And it's no worries; I'd rather this cover this in the open to be as transparent with people as possible. The angle of the story is meant to be positive, more of a counterpoint to the negative press the game has gotten over the past few months since launch. Instead of harping on its bugs and technical issues, it'll focus on the ways players have improved the game themselves since launch, either through helping Bethesda spot problems, working together to make it more enjoyable and immersive or what have you. As for the tagline, I'm not sure just yet. I pitched it to EGM, but they get the final say on that based on how the piece comes together.
---
I never encountered that myself so I can't say.
---
A bunch, but not too much! It‚Äôs so worth it!
---
Or you could just increase your selling price by 10 percent..
---
Is there any confirmation that this is actually what's happening?  That it's staggers and not, for example, her AI just bugging out searching for a place to land?
---
I‚Äôm curious to know what everyone‚Äôs strategy is for bulk junk, I like to keep 10 bulk of everything
---
You're not supposed to get the money pot when landing on free parking.
---
I think they enjoy screwing over the end user.
---

---
Give me scaffolding and planters so I can make vertical farms!
---
How's this - you get 1 token for every star you turn in.  You re-roll one chosen stat for 25 tokens.  Or 10, or whatever.  May take you 1 try, may take you 30, but you can always go farm up more crappy 1-star things.
---
If the cost isn't too bad, I'd be OK with that.
---
Now, if you get 1 chance a week...forget it, ain't got time for that.  But if I can re-roll all 250 of my tokens trying for explosive on my bloodied handmade, I think I'd that'd work.
---
Also, you can buy 10 tokens at the atomic shop for $10!  &gt;.&lt;
---
You can hop in my world and check it out if want, for sure. My psn is same as my username on here. I don‚Äôt have a mic so I can‚Äôt chat, but you can dm me on psn or on here if you have any questions. And glad I could help, I wanted to really show my own roadmap of what I liked about the game because I rarely hear about the overall experience, just the issues
---
I don‚Äôt get that many disconnects but I get the PS4 blue screen crash once every 1-2 hours. I‚Äôll also occasionally get disconnects and where the game completely freezes and I have to close app, but blue screen happens a lot. I own 100+ other PS4 games and none of them blue screen at all.
---
I'm unsure but we've tried it by having everyone running it cease fire and eventually she'll stop doing the same animation over and over, going back to her original routine, whatever her next attack is. (flyby dropping shit on you, etc)
---
sad it's getting delayed, but happy to see the display cases mentioned.
---
This is exactly it.   60%+ is just stuff we‚Äôre holding  for the vendor
---
its to help reduce the issue of everyone who plays the game more than casually having 1 billion caps atm.
---
Do you even read?
---
This is actually why I stopped playing. I was sick of being over burdened and didn't want to get rid of anything. I want to keep that 40mm auto grenade launcher even though I only sometimes use it...
---
They complained and ruined mine so yes
---
Well... yes.
---
It just reminds me when you sale something on eBay they always take 10% or something like that. But on a game yeah it makes no sense
---
They must be expanding the places you can build. I have another friend whose camp is literally inside Wilson Brother's Auto Repair.
---
INSIDE of it.
---
No problems thanks for answering and I hope you understand why I'm asking. I can certainly contribute.
---
Sounds like you already have the stuff you need, good for you. Some of us didn't play when duping allowed us to buy/get everything super cheap. Now most top end stuff is basically impossible to get unless you trade for other op items(even with 50k caps).
---
 A vendor with items that we server hop constantly for is either lackluster or a dumb way of getting items (i.e. # of tokens dont really matter just server hop rng). I dont see an upside whatsoever to that solution, also strains the servers.
---
Locking one slot to be rerolled like diablo doesn't make your items worthless, it just lets people actually put in work to improve their gear.
---
After a few weeks I stopped following all of the fallout-related youtubers except for MATN, who at least gave fair criticism while playing the game *and then dropped it without continuing to make a new complaint every week*. I'm sick of seeing stuff recommended to me with titles along the lines of "GUESS HOW MANY INNOCENT CHILDREN BETHESDA KILLED THIS WEEK?" with that picture of the vault boy with an inverted smile and thumbs down. Every. Goddamn. Thumbnail.
---
Not if you are on console.  One copy can be played on both systems simultaneously.
---
Pain train and melee is fun as hell
---
Thanks, hopefully that will get some clarification.
---
Please tell me you have a lever action called the Lincoln repeater
---
I mean, it's RNG, but in 500 hours I've found 3 Sentinel pieces and a Cavalier on my own and i don't even farm.  If you've invested 800 and found *nothing* good, I question what you're doing.
---
Party at the Whitesprings!
---
Does that single shot fix also for the regular laser gatling gun?
---
I have a couple handmades in my stash.  I don't have a weight reduction armor piece and they weigh 8-and-change for me.
---
But yes, this is sound advice.
---
Also pop "lighter build" or "ultra-light" mods on any and all armor pieces.  An ultra-light mod will typically drop arm and leg pieces down to 0.  (I'm sure it still has weight, but likely less than 1)  I hunt down golf balls just to keep my stash's cork pile at 100 units.
---
Even if I craft a large pile of ammo numbering in the quad digits, I rarely need more than 10 bulk lead and 400 steel.  (with \*\* ammosmith and \*\*\* super-duper cards) Both are really common materials, and there's no need to hoard them in tonnage.  Hoarding 1000's of units of steel or lead makes a large dent in your stash.  Make a run through the Burrows or West Tek, grabbing all the guns, soup cans and rat poison and you're walking away with probably 200 steel and 70+ lead.  More if you equip the Scrapper card when breaking all those rifles, missile launchers and hammers down.  West Tek is a steel mill and Burrows is a lead factory.  Make your ammo when you find a tinker's bench and don't hoard the raw materials.  A pile of ammunition weighs way less than the raw materials, even with no weight reducing perks.
---
I was disappointed that scrip wasn't in the game, so I'm psyched about this.
---
Growing up we always had old scrip around.
---
I‚Äôve been playing for 1.5 months lol.
---
I‚Äôd be cool if one slot was locked for re-rolling for sure.
---
As long as that slot didn‚Äôt get reset when an item is traded.
---
For all the bitching about this game... it's light years ahead of many others that received far less salt. Conan Exiles, anyone? (Just to keep it in the "Survival genre"). 
---
It's not a Nerf if the original stats were a fuck-up to begin with. The sole reason anyone is salty about the shotgun is that it's not the OP powerhouse weapon it was. Of course a game like this is going to face constant balance changes.
---
Then idk. Maybe people just had higher expectations for f76, so the disappointment set in harder. I don't think that would be misplaced, given how big of a name fallout is, but still
---
Yeah, it's pretty sad.  It feels like people who play more, get to a high level and get high damage output are looked down upon.  I don't get it.
---
This is epic.
---
There‚Äôs a steel guitar
---
Sounds like she hit you so hard you got flung up in the sky. Bethesda must be introducing new physics mechanics
---
That must be a great anti-scorchbeast weapon. I wonder what will replace explosive when they have fixed whatever they want to fix.
---
Dear lord you're thick.
---
People do trades because the caps have such a low value.
---
Adding caps sinks = increasing the value of caps = people begin selling items for caps.
---
If you can't understand why caps sinks are good don't bother replying. You're wasting my time.
---
How did you get it under the world?
---
It's not in a cave or anything, and when you look out you're literally looking into the abyss.
---
I didn't know Scanlan Shorthault was in Appalachia.
---
Water dispenser would be nice too
---
Obviously won't kill a group of mutant warlords or gulpers or a scorchbeast in one shot anymore, but with the right build it will still one-shot a majority of max level enemies even after the patch. I was thinking about scorched, ghouls, bloodbugs, etc when saying that
---
It is a caps sink. They have too many ways that introduce caps into the economy and too few methods to take them out of the economy.
---
That they think this is going to make the econony healthy is really the scariest thing about this because it totally wont and it is a weird way to do it.
---
Why cant u use the us version?
---
Added u where u at
---
And the currency tokens will weigh 2.5 each  
---
And not be stackable, for your scrolling pleasure
---
It‚Äôs economics. When the currency is In Surplus it cause the value of that currency to be worth less. Meaning you need more of it to make a trade. If it is more scarce then less currency is needed to make a trade (player to player)
---
Since the duping back in December many people have toons at full caps. This is a move on Bethesda‚Äôs part to trying to weed out illegitimate caps from duping exploits from the market.
---
Hopefully this will make it where certain god roll items no longer require 25k+ or trade only.
---
It‚Äôs supply and demand, maybe it‚Äôll be good for economy. Maybe it won‚Äôt
---
I did actually lol,so thats the reason lol
---
Level 67 on Xbone and I've had a recent bad run of feral players trying to demo my CAMP. Had to put locks on it, which sucks for anyone wanting use to use my gear...but if you jump servers before too much damage is done, usually your CAMP should be fine in the new server. Pacifist mode on CAMPs is coming - the sooner the better.  I tend to drop Ammo / Plans / Low lever gear etc in the blue suitcase inside Morgantown and Watoga Train Stations or the rubbish bin outside the crafting area in Whitesprings.  Always pays to check any 'container'. Not 100% confirmed but I also pick up any dropped 'baggies' and place the contents into a container because if that person logs off, the baggie will disappear and if its in a 'container' should last until server resets......?
---
D you have a list of usernames of confirmed complainers to Bethesda or is this just a blanket policy?
---
It reduces the amount of caps that exist which makes the caps more valuable. I think that's a good thing.
---
Hey, just wanna say, it's your own fault for assuming and getting your expectations higher. They were never gonna give you the ability to just add or change legendary effects on your items at will. That would make it too OP. it's always been called a "Legendary VENDOR", implying you can buy/sell stuff, not anything else. it has never said that you can reroll effects etc.
---
So, if you're disappointed based on no information received, this is all on you.
---
I'd like to think it will be something along the lines of the plasma spaz perk from fnv (and maybe 3?) where things can blow up in an energy explosion on death. They said they will remove explosive energy weapons from the drop pool until they make the adjustments they want, so that makes me think whatever it is will be applicable to all explosive energy weapons, before and after the patch. It probably won't be a whole new effect in that case, just a variation on "explosive"
---
Again now the buyer is who will end up paying for this cause whatever I would normally price it for I‚Äôll be adding 10 percent onto it
---
Best thing I've seen all day lol
---
I haven't spent any atoms because I've been waiting for the black rider. The skins are based on the four horseman of the apocalypse from what I can tell and I love death, who the black rider is supposed to be. I have around 2009 atoms, so I think I have enough
---
I've found lots of stuff that is useable but nothing that anybody would offer 50k caps for.
---
I still have yet to accumulate an entire set of 3* Unyielding armor. I got my first 2* Handmade the other day......a Hunter's w/50% Limb damage.
---
Basically what I've been doing is running around like a rat inside of a box chasing a piece of cheese......a skinner box I believe is what it is called.
---
Umm... did you even read my post. That‚Äôs basically what I was saying.
---
Would prefer more build budget tbh...
---
I‚Äôm not sure if it will work but you can maybe try to use amazon. Maybe changing your currency will work. The other option is eBay or go on google and buy a copy from the UK. You‚Äôd have to wait for shipping but by the time you manage to find a code, it would probably already be at your house.
---
It really didn't take duping to hit max caps ever
---
I will soon he is a new character
---
Yes because I'm on this Reddit thread 24 7 and I really care that much here let me give me a second and I'll send you the list I have
---
shh!  Delete this post now before they get any ideas!  ;-)
---
No one has 1 billion caps. At max they have 125k per account.
---
Sounds like a bit of a dick move, do need a hug or something? Will that help you feel better?
---
Do you know if the missing damage reduction is still true?  Been thinking about running a 19% bloodied PA build but this would make it a lot more squishy than I could tolerate.
---
Also, how easy is it to use xedit and finding modifier values for specific perks/affixes?  I was interested in checking some like the exact cap/damage increase per shot on Furious.
---
You selling any of those handmades?
---
Yeah, I know. There's just other people in the thread giving their expectations still. This was aimed at them, not you.
---
Why are you getting downvoted?
---
No I just want my caps for the kills but other then that I'm pretty happy thx for asking
---
I have an [art blog](https://pumpkinpirate.tumblr.com/) but my [boyfriend does vintage style posters we sell](https://www.etsy.com/shop/UrsocsDen/?section_id=25524724), I could do something together with him sometime!
---
Jeez. I had nearly 1500 about a week before the first one but didn't know sbout the rider paints. So (like an idiot) I brought some camp plans. Now I am back at 1000 or so. Figure I will just drop the 8 NZD to get 500 when I next get paid.
---
Oh that's a great name and location for it!  I'm opening my own, haven't settled on a final location but I'm thinking outside Morgantown, close to Biv to aid players in quickly completing those dailies.
---
go in the market and ask anyone if they would EVER trade a BFFrVATS handmade for caps. people don't deal in caps because legendary items will **always** have more value, among other things.
---
a 10% sink isn't gonna change anything.
---
I was there. LOL  
---
Thanks for posting. Funny thing is I could hear the noise but couldn't see them.
---
It used to 1-2 shot majority of the enemies in the game.  I agree that was way too overpowered.  This nerf just feels wrong.  Who knows, maybe I'll find something I like better?  I typically gravitate to shotguns in most video games.  I prefer stopping power over high fire rate.
---
Yep, to the legendary vendor ;)
---
Wow. You do actually have a list. Haha. No thanks. I‚Äôm gonna go have a fun day with my kid. I won‚Äôt be back on for several hours. Try to have a better day. And I‚Äôm am being 100% sincere. When we all do better, we all do better.
---
It's an out of season April fool's joke.
---
Seneca Rocks isn't as hard to get to since jetpacks and marsupial are much easier to obtain. My previous base there rarely was able to be placed up there surprisingly. Atleast you don't have a mirelurk queen spawn scaring off customers. Lol
---
The Mire makes it easy to place crops, somewhat
---
Its still like 60 bucks while eu is like 16 to much for me atm. sadly im disabled out of work so im trying to see if i can get a eu code maybe to work so i can play with him
---
Oh I know it.  I didn't start putting thought into my build until it was too late, and now I have to do a bunch of moving around.  Side question, is the gauntlet considered one handed melee or unarmed when it comes to perks?  Do you happen to know?
---
Is there any cost to getting these vending machines?
---
Agreed, it‚Äôs extremely unnecessary.
---
Ty for the info \^\^ i might have to do that see if i can find a used one or somthing idk
---
Pretty sure it's unarmed.  It can't be used in PA either.
---
Then make the 3 star legendary enemies rare?
---
Better yet, don't have a rating at all!
---
It's more that they got it to work, so they're wondering why it's not working for him.
---
10% of everything you sell.
---
Dang that sucks. I heard about them in december, and I stopped playing a few months back, and I'm planning on starting a new character when black rider drops
---
You got banned, contact bethesda not us
---
If only I knew. People don't like thinking so the easy solution is, "Ack, they're lying," and just discredit it as, "DoN't bUy DuPeD wEaPoNs!!!!iiii!!!!"
---
This is why we can't have nice things :(
---
Yeah the damage was done
---
I think Black Rider is next week. I only started playing about 3 weeks ago.
---
Wow also at sites like kinguin? I bought 4 of 5 fo76 Keys for my Friends but we all live in the EU. So cant help you awnser your question. Good luck with that.
---
I use two heavy turrets to protect my bar, one at the bottom of the steps and another overlooking the crafting patio on the side. Then one shotgun turrent on the inside next to my fusion generator because I get the occasional enemy somehow getting in their
---
Just me.  Not for much longer either.  Only because I like shotguns.
---
Wooo!!! Display cases am excite!
---
Damn kids these days .... I remember carrying my 400lb stash uphill both ways in the snow.
---
Seriously though, it's hard to imagine. I probably have 400 in steel, stims and fusion cores.
---
So your QE DB is for sale then huh?
---
I once found over 1200 pounds of 1*s which will be good for trade ins
---
Do tell, I haven‚Äôt heard about that.
---
The thing is, 76 actually HAS content and had it at launch. Decent main quest, several factions with full questlines, huge map, deep crafting and customization. Anthem looks really pretty and the gameplay is fantastic, there‚Äôs just no content there whatsoever. At least when you run out of quests in 76 you can farm, camp, craft, grind out thousands of unique legendaries and (now) farm more than one end game boss. Anthem has none of that and 76 has everything any other fallout has except npcs
---
I would expect display cases and be surprised if it's anything else.
---
What poor communication? They release weekly update posts detailing what they have planned. A roadmap with dates of when they expect to release content and what content will be in it. Long, detailed patch notes when there are updates. And community managers replying to our comments on the subreddit. Plus, they actually listen to the players, well, for the most part. (gift emote for example).
---
What's leading to people getting pissed is that they're setting their own expectations in their head of what's coming, when nothing like that has been announced, then getting annoyed when it comes out and isn't exactly what they thought it would be.
---
i havent tried that one ill take a look \^\^ and thank you for the info \^\^. yea its still high here in the states ive seen everywhere else its cheeeeep. so im seeing if there is some work around or a cheeper way to get the game \^\^ thank you so much tho for the info =)
---
I‚Äôm level 20, haven‚Äôt been playing long, just decided to sell all my useless legendaries today for a few measly caps....
---
Unlike actual modern monetary policy the supply of caps \*is\* the wealth.
---
Caps in circulation is more like a gold standard as opposed to dollars today which are by fiat.
---
By reducing caps in circulation each actual cap gains value. Yeah, it's fuzzy ‚Ä¶
---
Nice. What platform?
---
Might be an issue with the rate - I think it will be easy to set a single item for 100 caps, but I'm not sure you can set 100 items for 1 cap.  It will depend entirely on the UI.
---
Anything at 1 cap per or more, and you'll be OK.  Otherwise...maybe?
---
I ran melee using a Ski Sword until I finally got a gauntlet about ten levels ago, and most of my perks are geared towards one handed melee still.  I hate having to switch over to my sword again when I get into my PA.  It sucks.
---
Craft and scrap to unlock mods?
---
Or a 3* Fatman with 40% bashing and power attack with 90% weight reduction.
---
If you craft a bunch of radium rifles and undercut the vender bots even by a little, they'll sell due to the attachment plans being so rare to acquire while sceapping them.
---
I hope so too but it will kinda suck having to stash all the ammo first
---
Ps4.
---
Damn right!!!
---
I got to level 200 without ever getting a TSE (and it was a personal goal of mine to get it from a killing a legendary)... Never got it... Ended up buying my Gatling TSE (I called him Slayer) from another player I know. The goal is complete, but I don't feel the personal satisfaction of earning it. Now I'm at level 273 and still yet to see it organically drop.
---
I am hoping it's just buying and not selling. I don't want my storage being taken up by crap items. I wonder if the hard bargain perk card works with the player machines
---
Dang I'm on xb1
---
I was able to get the challenge at the farm without the camera registering any  of the individuals. Here is what my "winning" photo looks like...
---
[https://imgur.com/bVsfcVb](https://imgur.com/bVsfcVb)
---
That‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs incredibly easy to sustain max caps though, other than fast traveling there‚Äôs nothing you really need to buy other than some plans and the recall key for ISS
---
I think they mean for the machine itself. To build or buy the plan in the first place.
---
Oh well. Happy hunting out there.
---
You too.
---
Good riddance
---
I meant selling ammo in my vending machine and buying ammo from someone else‚Äôs vending machine.
---
It took me a while to figure out. I waved at someone in the Mire and next minute I'm falling off a cliff on a different part of the map. I even found myself suspended 100's of meter above ground in a part of the map that's not even open. I'm tempted to start using it as a free (surprise) fast travel. Just have to remember to make sure I'm not carrying any junk. Lol
---
some weapons are worth crafting for scrapping and learning mods. but generally even 1\* legendaries are better than regular weapons.
---
Search this exact topic and you will find your answer. People ask this question daily.
---
&gt;They want you to earn it, for it to be special
---
It would be a lot more special if I didn't have to worry about it disappearing from my inventory due to a bug...
---
But then my stash of shotgun shells will lose value!
---
Was that before or after the budget update allowing 10 turrets and 50 lights?
---
I feel you. Sometimes when I play fo76 I too wish I was playing something else.
---
It's almost like we're expected to go out exploring the world and interacting with other players instead of seeking numerical perfection by repeatedly doing the same thing from server to server.  What kind of sadistic game would ever do such a thing?  It isn't like they drip fed content they never outright announced like the real sheepsquatch, keep expanding emotes requested heavily, added a camera with a sightseeing quest, altered legendary drop rates in the most over grinded locale, made a drink that drops you in a random place on the map, have consolidated vendors to the one locale players have used as a hub already, or outright said that raid style and game content is a to be released later priority.  Saying they don't want us to have perfect roll gear is like expecting us to enjoy the game beyond power gaming it, and that's just crazy talk.
---
Just go take pictures of a few people, there‚Äôs about 15 different criteria you can fulfill for the challenge
---
I hope not. Spent 12k on crappy legendaries with explosive on them. But my fault
---
If I had a penny for how many times I've seen these type of posts...
---
I mean, my tse shotgun is already useless and they are saying it's currently doing 200% more damage than it should. I can't even kill myself with this thing let alone something else.
---
They did an amazing job with the animation. I hope they fix it so you get to use it soon.
---
 I'm getting 150 out of my Regular Serrated Combat Knife when its repaired to 200% and although I have several Legendary knives I use it a lot. 
---
 I can just toss it when it gets to 150 health and make another. ;)
---
Gets better every patch. Keep in mind 90% of the people here have been playing since beta and never cared what the press said. If you like open world do-whatever-you-want-and-kill-stuff games it‚Äôs great üëç
---
I don‚Äôt get what the big deal is.
---
r/woosh
---
Wow. Aren‚Äôt shotguns SUPPOSED to be, you know, SHOTGUNS? I‚Äôve been hanging on by a thread here Bethesda. It‚Äôs like you WANT us to all stop using guns and go min-max Melee builds. Last I checked, this wasn‚Äôt For Honor.
---
Check out today's inside the vault issue!
---
To ‚Äúkeep the in-game economy healthy‚Äù. But if that really were the case there wouldn‚Äôt be a 10% deductible in the first place. It‚Äôs a vending machine, not an auction house so I don‚Äôt understand why they‚Äôre treating it like one
---
Why would anyone use a repair kit at a bench? 
---
I agree with you on the old setting! Now it doesn‚Äôt even show info like it did after unless you back off the bench.
---
That‚Äôs reassuring! Thanks for the info!
---
I didn't even know you could do it through the Pip-Boy.  Huh.
---
Still, I agree, the new repair workflow is needlessly awkward no matter if you use the kits or not.
---
The only thing I find annoying is selling an item for less than 10c = greater than 10% taken. I‚Äôm assuming they would have to take a cap from every purchase, so if you have hundreds of diluted stimpaks like me you would have 20% taken from selling for 5c
---
You can buy the eu code, then make your friend use a VPN and set their location to EU
---
Join a trade subreddit and maybe you'll get somthing out of that but don't expect much its a pretty terrible weapon. But hey goodluck
---
That'd be true if there were a fixed amount of caps in the game. But every quest you complete, or looting containers or mobs, creates new caps as a reward. So it's like they're constantly printing new money, and taking away a small amount of the existing money won't make any difference as far as scarcity.
---
I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on it but I‚Äôve got a feeling there‚Äôs an underlying irony of this relating to the in game lore.
---
They still have it in options to prevent you from hurting friends if you turn it on.
---
If you and your buddies are mobbed by a gang of scorched you can still freely blast away with your TSE shotgun since it won't injure your buddy you are traveling with,
---
Oh wait really?
---
Damn it...
---
It's needed. The issue is that the ability to generate caps is infinite. The vender ALWAYS has 1400 caps for you personally to receive for what ever you want to sell. So over time the amount of caps held on characters goes up and up and up. So many caps in circulation leads to inflationary prices on the trade market and so now a 3* bloodied explosive handmade sells for 70k caps (yes. People have multiple alts with max caps) when months ago it would go for 25k.
---
Bethesda needs a mechanism to destroy caps and decrease the inflation. I honestly think we need multiple rakes.
---
Eh I feel like that's still the point of survival to risk it all friendly fire included
---
That would be an Atom fee no?
---
Sure you would,  a repair kit doesn‚Äôt require any resources so if you try to repair something in the workbench and find you don‚Äôt have the resources to do it, you can use the repair kit without leaving the bench
---
What would of made more sense is to come advertise here, you had the challenge available for the and you waiting for a while as long a they don't despawn like people did with the camera person. I rarely respond to messages, the latest scam is " Are you busy ?" on XB1 which changed from "Hi", so better to come here and tell people which platform you on if it is a tough challenge.
---
Will you still get caps for your kills? Because I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôll still be able to enjoy your pvp regardless really.
---
 The TS will leave you with a very inaccurate weapon.
---
The 10% is entirely a cap sink, a mean to ensure some amount of caps leave the economy. The cap value is set by the player, nothing about it is hard set in the game, so nothing about a player buying or selling it should cause that kind of lose of value, especially not a consistent 10%
---
Thanks for posting this but how exactly does one prevent turrets from attacking players who will forcibly try to get attacked? 
---
Seems to me they could just make sure a turret attacks them and then your CAMP is destroyed as they‚Äôve been doing. 
---
Any ideas how to prevent this other than not putting down turrets?
---
I think this is probably the wasteland equivalent of letting a bag of poo on fire and leaving it outside your door. At least they didn't set it on fire?
---
i want a casino .. i earn my caps so hard that i want to waste them all in a couple of minutes without profit
---
So just use a vpn to activate it and it will work?
---
It kinda looks like people are expecting a instant win button and just get 5 Star everything get any lendary effect you want with no effort into anything super easily which will just ruin the game these are the wrong expectations to have
---
It will work as long as you have the VPN activated I believe
---
Lol no sir.
---
I personally hope so.
---
I used to be vehemently against duping but after 800 hours and nothing but mediocre legendary drops without mods like in Fallout 4........ I'm ready to get some duped gear.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it‚Äôs not long...
---
I‚Äôd say I‚Äôd put money on it but seeing as the only currency in game is caps and they‚Äôre becoming worthless, perhaps I should say I‚Äôd put 2 backpacks on it üòÇ
---
I think part of the reason is to keep players from buying and reselling items. For example, if I find someone selling an item for 220 caps and buy it. If I try to turn around and resell it at a higher price I have to sell it for at least 244 caps to just break even now.
---
This legendary vendor is gonna suck so much not looking forward to it anymore.
---
I‚Äôm a super noob when it comes to actually using my xbox, despite having it for years, how would I join this group? I‚Äôm lvl 104 in game, I‚Äôve just never really used the social aspect of my Xbox.
---
That's not a guarantee, things have been delayed before.  One would think it would be priority, given we're now drawing attention to our camps.
---
First ever documentary video evidence of scorchbeast mating rituals...
---
Until they release patch notes there's no way to know for sure, however my assumption and understanding is that as long as you don't fire back at the attacker the then neither should your turrets.
---
I have a floating camp so I just use a few missile turrets near the only entrance and never have issue repairing anything by my crops
---
So let the game ask me if i want to repair with repair kit if i don't have enough resources but have kits. It's one time in 10. i'm okay with that. I'm not okay with choosing between kits and regular repair every time. I come to my workbench, it's obvious i want to repair with it, otherwise i could just use pipboy
---
It says if your turrets turn on the player they can destroy your camp... so I still see a big issue here... 
---
Is the standard now to not have turrets then you‚Äôre safe?
---
Where do the 1400 caps that the vendors have come from? Why do they always have 1400 caps when all they do is buy stuff and rarely sell you anything?
---
Because the games economy is not a real economy with a limited pool of money that gets transfered around. The games economy is basically inflationary. Money is printed in infinite amounts on demand, which drives down the value of a cap in trading, and drives up the cost of items. Item values in trading have easily trippled in the last few months. We need a way to remove caps from circulation and a 10% rake on trade sales is a good start.
---
Well that's not entirely true. Obviously they can't just fix the general amount of caps in the game but that doesn't mean this fee is useless. Yes it doesn't really change much but i think it's a good idea. Maybe they'll increase the fee.
---
I read it as your turrets wont attack them unless YOU‚ÄôRE hostile towards them, they cant initiate PvP with your camp anymore
---
Faster and cheaper than fast traveling ü§£
---
Ah those were the days!  Everyone had Excavator PA too just to get that extra 100
---
Why would they remove the option to choose kits or repair every time. They want you to use and buy as many kits as possible so they‚Äôre going to shove it in your face. This wasn‚Äôt an accident
---
All of this please.  All of it.  
---
The bullet spongeyness of enemies can become very tedious.  I crippled a sheepsquatch, both legs, and now have to spend 5 minutes pumping ammo into its head while it struggles impotently to hurt me.
---
Excavator PA
---
Not sure but won‚Äôt the turrets attack a player if the player attacks them? Say if you‚Äôre not at your CAMP.... 
---
Thanks for the reply, just trying to figure out details! Thanks!!
---
I don't think Bethesda would roll out player vending without first implementing the change, it would put them in a bad PR position again. But you're right nothings set in stone, I'm just conveying what Bethesda has already promised.
---
why are you here, then
---
I love the poster wall idea
---
Reality is often disappointing
---
Is the issue with the grounded mutation not being affected by the class freak perk to be fixed in patch 9?
---
So?
---
And *still* don't benefit from armor penetration modifiers.
---
Great post! I always leave something nice if I enter another players home, usually Sugar bombs or something. Last night I left a fresh glowing steak medium rare and bubble gum for bad breath after the steak lol :) I actually killed some ghouls and Liberators attacking the place as well..
---
I'm assuming they wouldn't attack back, the attacker wouldn't be able to do damage to them so why would they attack back?
---
All we need now are some Wanamingos!
---
Thoughts
---
There seems to be a lot of mindless down voting me for pointing this out. As if the team at Bethesda hasn't already thought about this..... people think they can just put their fingers in their ears and down vote me and hope this goes away.
---
The extremely unfair RNG is an inconvenience on those who want end game loot. 
---
Weapon repairs is also an inconvenience.
---
Players with full sets of Assassin's Sentinel armor and 3* Handmade weapons have spent months assuring us that buying armor and weapons isn't pay 2 win.
---
You heard it here first......... legendary scrips will be sold in the Atom shop by years end.
---
Cool! I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre doing this! I have an open camp build so anyone can use it and even get free water or whatever I have even growing but still had it destroyed twice... kinda stupid when we have survival servers they can do that all day on. 
---
Thanks for the info! Appreciate it!
---
We have by accident...
---
Yeah that's the way I'm interpreting it too.
---
add flair or sticker or even button that leads you right in the atom shop when you're using workbench, i don't care. Right now this is the worst way to show us repair kits exist in the game
---
I think you missed the hyperbolic point with your literalness.
---
What happens when everyone has 125k caps because of how easy it is to max out? Trading dies. The barter system doesn't work because it is super super rare that so one wants my super rare item AND has a super rare item I want in return.
---
Good call, I checked yesterday so: the 50% damage reduction perk seems to be there right now. 
---
But I didn't test in game yet
---
About xEdit: basically it's the same logic than Fallout 4 or Skyrim, so if you know what to look at, it's not very hard to get an insight, but beware because many things can also be applied through papyrus scripts, and unless you decompile them in order to go deeper into the code you can't be 100% sure about something.
---
Ive literally tried giving plans to dozens of low level players, with very little success(most of them seem confused by what I'm doing), I completed the game already, and the plans which I have duplicates and triplicates of are the only thing that was ever overencumbering me. I think I'm just going to give them to a friend and have them give them to a low level character I just started playing.
---
Lets see just put a player vending machine on a long path over a cliff with nothing but spring board traps and enjoy them trying to get there.
---
Yes at Camden Park and occasionally at the Responder vendor in the town of Grafton (not the vendor at the train station).
---
That's how I got my T-51 shocks, also saves you flux as that is difficult to come buy early on.
---
Happy server hopping.
---
So sick of these posts....
---
Will the vendors items be instanced?  I could see all the good things getting bought up by people who server hop.
---
Only herpes. Those are like diamonds.
---
Yes Phoenix at Watoga got plan, but is about 5k. Some ppl will craft it for you way cheaper.
---
as a rare drop, possibly. how rare? you are better off buying the plans or trading someone to install them for you
---
I'm assuming this way why player vending was moved back in the first place.  We'll know for sure on Tuesday.
---
I‚Äôm not familiar with the process especially when it says that about the turrets attacking the player. So I was wondering if they could trigger that if you weren‚Äôt at the camp say... 
---
I don‚Äôt PvP and stay in adventure mode but I‚Äôve had my open camp to everyone destroyed twice for no reason. So just trying to get the info straight.
---
Bummer I was hoping for the ability to add stars to a named weapon like the fixer
---
Brotherhood vendor bot in the city or whitesprings.  5700 with hard barging and grape mentats
---
Were you the guy harassing Skyhumper aka Clown Daddy while he was fighting?
---
That has always been an available camp spot
---
Can‚Äôt till after the kids go to bed -.-
---
Good point. Haven‚Äôt thought about that...
---
Yeah, it's in Charisma.
---
This is patently false. No assumptions are made when it's actually what was directly said by Todd Howard. Unless Todd is actually incredibly stupid(he's not) or has a tenuous grasp of the English language(he doesn't), he flat out lied.
---
Is it really that big a deal? Probably not. But we don't need to pretend people are just making shit up as they go.
---
There are people out there on reddit who have worked just as hard as you maybe more so and still don't have anything to show for it. Getting god tier gear is 50% hard work and 50% luck. Re rolling allows those who have +40 3\* crap to turn some of it to being worth something.
---
Stack in small med and large bundles 25 50 and 100.  Add bulk  fluxes screws nuck asbestos ect
---
Finally our stash loose some weights..
---
It works. But I think you still can get it faster from a water source.
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten a repair kit yet but could placing the option right at the beginning cause you to accidentally use a repair kit? Or is there a confirmation after you click it?
---
Great, thanks for letting me know! Thats definitely important. 
---
And hm. Since I didnt look at code for Fallout 4 or Skyrim it sounds like it'd be daunting to do so for FO76, especially since my only coding background is SQL. &gt;_&lt;
---
Let me guess, 2nd place means they beat your fucking legs with hammers?
---
Im not sure i know what your talking about lol i strictly run around in the enclave officer trench coat and the hat is optional, i play on PS4 as well if that clears anything up
---
THE PHANTOM SHITTER IS BACK BABY AHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
I would agree with "not implemented well". Especially since a number of items are unrealistically heavy specifically so they could make perk cards to decrease their weight.
---
Cool, thanks for the link! I kind of lost track of what was still in place with a few things being delayed and some ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù etc.
---
Hm, they are extinct but this takes place before.
---
Lol how is this the same?
---
 What is wrong with you? Its what we are here for. ;)
---
 I had 3 the other day, lying in the parking lot.

---
I noped out as fast as I saw them lol
---
Well, considering that would count as a pay2win item which they have already stated won't be coming to the atom shop, I'd guess never.
---
(Repair kits aren't pay2win, they're convenience items)
---
Right?
---
Same here on Ps4, it's really irritating.
---
And that's what makes perfect gear special for those of us who stick it out, and put the time in farming. Realistically, the game has been out long enough that you should have gotten or traded for your "perfect" gear by now.
---
They seemed to not want privacy XD
---
Where is my Marine Assault helmet!!!?
---
I‚Äôm sorry, I have to disagree.
---
There are systems in this cane that yield a definite reward.
---
I have been playing for 1.5 months.
---
It‚Äôs all about the grind.
---
Of course there are varying levels of success but it‚Äôs still very much an input-output relationship.
---
On average, someone who puts in a similar amount of work that I have into the same systems will have a similar output.
---
Finally, I'll be able to log in and play again without being seriously overencumbered with a full stash from all the legendaries I've been hoarding.
---
So I'm not the only one.....

You literally said ‚Äúpeople thought he meant reroll...‚Äù and he didn‚Äôt say that. People assumed he meant that. That‚Äôs literally the definition. I don‚Äôt see how you are missing the contradiction in your statement.
---
We already have an answer and it isn't that trading dies, the currency changes to things that actually hold value, as it already has in trading for high end items.
---
Just as creative as "Uuuh i'm so tired of these posts" mimimimimi. 
---
Trying to be edgy, huh kid? 
---
Go to sleep
---
But PVP players with duped sets of Assassin's Sentinel Armor and Bloodied SS Deathclaw Gauntlets have argued for months that their armor doesn't give them an advantage. Just gotta stagger them is all.
---
Got there a nice family snap there too yesterday
---
IMO... having to choose what to keep, what to dump, what to craft, what to sell, what to toss and what to give away... all the "Space management"... is a HUGE part of survival games.
---
Being forced to decide which weapons to keep, and knowing you CAN'T keep them all... is a great game mechanic. You can't have it all. If you can... then why bother with any of it? Just blow the doors off and allow godhood. All the gear, all the stuff, all the ammo, all the builds. 
---
If anything, I simply wish the inventory menus were more user friendly, as opposed to one long alphabetical run-on list.
---
Well, as far as I'm concerned Super Mutants were created by the Master inside the Mariposa Military Base but I can see past that, so I don't really care about a justification for adding Wanamingos. 
---
But honestly, I can live without them. I don't need every other thing in this game to be a nod to the other Fallout games.
---
Exhibitionists!!!
---
Next week's photo challenge...
---
That's what I was hoping too, but there was nothing about it in the article.  I'm a bit disappointed that with all the player anticipation, they didn't go into more detail.
---
He didn‚Äôt say you could reroll your existing weapons. Unless there is another video out there I haven‚Äôt seen. People just took his words and ran with it.
---
Well said. These casuals want everything handed to them for no effort. You have to work to complete with the big boys.
---
The whole point of having to manually empty the output is so that it takes at least a minimum amount of effort to mass produce water. Of course the limited storage makes it pretty much irrelevant how much of something other than the ultra rare mats you can produce.
---
Bloodied sneak melee build I did it solo the other day easy. Take my fury and whiskey, Took all the pylons while getting my adrenaline stacks up, and popping stims. Snuck up behind him and one shorted him.
---
It was me. I do this all the time üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Hoping it will at least let you re-roll the legendary effects of existing weapons rather than just selling for tokens.
---
You and /uSlashCross need to do a team build store...
---
Too bad its the most efficient farming method in this game. Unless they made some pretty major changes to the core of the game, it will always be.
---
Crossing my fingers for them using an exponential math formula, to buy levels: lvl 1 = 10 scrips, lvl 2 = 100, lvl 3 = 1000.  To sell is probably 1/10th of that so selling: lvl 1=1 scrip, lvl 2 = 10, lvl 3 = 100.  I think that would work, looks reasonable, I am hoping it's that.
---
Hey weird question: If you leave the tapes in your CAMP terminal does it remember/save it in there when you log in/out? Or do you have to load them back in?
---
I probably shouldn't be, but I'm weirdly paranoid about losing my games.
---
I'll give that a try then, see you in a few months when I finally find them üòÇ
---
i hope so, i got nearing 9k shotgun shells ive been getting ready to sell off
---
There's no in-game reasoning behind it, or explanation of how it could possibly happen.  Who's taking 10%?  Where do those caps actually go?  If I'm in a ditch and set up a vending machine, someone finds my ditch machine and spends 200 caps there - where do the 20 bottle caps that I don't get go?  Are they fired into the sun?  Does a fucking gremlin come along and collect them?
---
It's nonsense we didn't ask for to solve a problem that isn't real.  Player vending IS the cap sink.  They don't need another layer in it.
---
He probably got the event rewards, which are better than yet another 1 star, so idk what has his jock strap in a knot.  And if he didn't, then he didn't make it in time for the event, and surely wouldn't have made it for the squatch.  F that guy.
---
I‚Äôve been going to war all day with these guys man.
---
They‚Äôre so bitter.
---
Like what if a new employee with less experience and similar education was promoted to be their boss at an employer?
---
Bullshit.
---
They just can‚Äôt grasp that in this game you get out what you put in.
---
RNG is the least reliable system, and there are other in-game ways to spend your time that can wind up being more lucrative.
---
I‚Äôm trying to do a Solo Melee build with power armor. Not sure if I want 1h or 2h Melee (I chose strength/gladiator to start but would be willing to do 2h) and Idk what I want for a seasondary weapon. Maybe rifle or shotgun. Any recommendations or links??
---
If I put my holotape games into a terminal can another player steal them?
---
You still can not hit "R" to open a goo/ash pile, you can only hit "E" to remove items 1 at a time from the small display. So you have to basically loot the whole thing or at least most of it to get to/see items not on the initial display.
---
Better than not being lootable at all, but not "fixed" IMO.
---
I would love for the tax to be "implemented" by Mafioso style My. Gutsy's floating about the map. Maybe their headquarters is enar Mama Dulce's or an Italian restaurant in Watoga. 
---
Godfather style dialogue.
---
etc...
---
Pretty much exactly what I'm saying.  Oh but you were trying to make fun of me because I called out your inability to both stop hoarding weapons/armor/junk you will never use and constant complaints that there isn't enough stash space.
---
You really are a loser.
---
The large one is actually easier to place than the small too
---
"item must have support" my ass small razorgrain. The big one can go down, you're green. Just fucking place.
---
Do you remember when the burrows was going to be a challenge for 2 level 50+ characters? Or how about how every time we get patch notes people have to go back and start listing all the stealth nerfs?
---
Quantity does not equal quality communication. Our community manager is more likely to comment about how poop in a bag left on someones bed is hilarious than to address any question on repair kits and there is a dev tracker to prove it.
---
As far as the roadmap goes can you name one major roadmap release that has hit its initially communicated release date?
---
We need better and more accurate information from Bethesda
---
üòÇ so to everyone 1500+ isn't OP but 300 is.  And please don't cry about "Im two hits from death." With the right perks and Unyielding armor,  you're just as strong and deadly at low health that I am at full. Stop being such homers.  Guess that bloodied shotgun then must be literally the most powerful gun in all of video game history since bloodied is OP and obviously shotguns kill thousands in one shot.  What the damage? 2000-3000? üòÇ
---
I dont get how this works when its not a real currency? Dont caps randomly spawn in the game, so theres an unlimited amount of caps? The only reason I can see for the 10% is to keep players from buying and reselling items at a slight upcharge for profit.
---
Oh you mean the same update that made adventure players invulnerable to slap damage... have fun...
---
I asked a similar question yesterday and got some great answers. Take a look at [this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bjn906/what_do_you_guys_think_are_the_best_perks_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
your innovation impresses me.
---
That's an interesting question though that I don't immediately know. Were there any super mutants before the Master (going by just original game lore, Bethesda changed stuff with Fallout 3 and on)? I mean obviously FEV and all existed in the vats but before him were any accidentally exposed (to enough of it to Super Mutant them) really ever?
---
Ya but I can take all the workshops I want
---
Yep, its cause of pvp. The explosive shotguns are still way overpowered in pvp. Had an explosive shotgunner one shot me in survival mode last night). It also destroyed 2 pieces of my power armor. (I was level 45 in the 25 excavator still and the killer was around 165, got the notice that his level 205 party member was contesting my workshop on the other side of the map right after dying. Not a really time efficient way of earning 45 caps).
---
This is a really fun idea! I love it. I would like my title to be "Lady Devann, the Radiated."
---
haha
---
So it's something new? Good, I was wondering how I played all the others and never heard of it before but honestly I've never gotten as "into" the other Fallout games before. Thank you for the info
---
Post nerf is a different discussion.  Anything explosive was OP then.

 &gt; This is a really fun idea! I love it. I would like my title to be "Lady Devann, the Radiated."
---
Rebuilding something I guess lol
---
I like Combat Knives. They can be made to hit very hard and they hit very often. You might find the endless DPS useful. The Heavy and Medium slow, and fairly slow, weapons allow you to be easily staggered while the knives just keep hitting.
---
 Its probably an acquired taste but I love em'. 
---
 Glowing Steak is +10% Melee and the Twisted Muscles Mutation is +25% Melee.
---
It literally does not matter how much stash weight they give you, it will always max out.
---
I used up all my flux from the nuked zones already, bummed me out. It's not a very common thing (flux), I think I will take off the prime receiver and sell the gun to a vendor. Before I do I will burn through some ammo I have already for it.. Thanks for the response.
---
Increase luck
---
I can say this wasnt me.  I dont leave toiled paper.
---
10% is way less than what the vendor bots take from your sale and make available again.
---
Remember it's almost 10k caps per player week organic cap growth
---
Heh?
---
There isn't a shotgun nerf
---
They're fixing the damage display in your pipboy
---
Its like one more button to press...
---
I personally think it‚Äôs worth it for $20. Hell, even at this point I‚Äôd pay $30. There‚Äôs a lot of content. Especially if you‚Äôre on console, the trading business is booming. With upcoming updates there will be player vending, backpacks, etc.
---
Didn‚Äôt they say these vending machines are only for selling in the description?
---
Negative replies. How refreshing and original
---
I suggest you read the latest inside the vault, looks like it pretty much confirmed what i said
---
&gt;Why would anyone use a repair kit at a bench?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I agree with you on the old setting! Now it doesn‚Äôt even show info like it did after unless you back off the bench.
---
I could see using an improved repair kit if you didn't have the right perk cards, but again, why you'd be making that decision in the workbench interface escapes me.
---
All depends how much time you want to waste, or enjoy, based on you pov. If the option to server hop is there, and it's faster and easier than finding and killing for loot, then people are going to do it. Even people with some sort of twisted sense of morality about it. You can only take so much before the quicker option looks appealing. 
---
I for one, and always have been, happy to put my actual gameplay on pause to server hop and "farm" the gear I want to obtain. Then I play the game with my build already set.
---
Just the number of perk points in general?
---
The posters are brilliant! Looks great!
---
Advertising!  "Prices include the 10% BGS tax!"  And of course you'll add 20% and be a legit vendor.  I'd hire a mercenary Deathclaw guard to eat anyone standing in line at the Complaints &amp; Returns counter......
---
I dont care how many 'coin' I can spend a day...just please for the love of god let me cash in the 8,000 lbs of legendaries I am hording, I would really love to level and ALT and try some different play styles, but right now they are all crushed under the weight of an armory.
---
You might use a repair kit at a bench if you don't have the materials necessary for a workbench repair.
---
Thanks for the replies, I wasn't sure how I missed this in the other games but I also never had the time to invest in a FO game like I do now, became disabled last year so yeah... it's my alternate reality you could say.
---
Does luck actually effect how good the drop will be? For example, 3 star weapons and armor?
---
I got 7 out of 10 from 1 picture at a scorched earth event. Funny thing is I was only trying to photo the mirelurks there.
---
Exactly.  So how is that any different then a shotgun build that spends 9 perk points on strength and 3 in explosive perk to take a 175 damage gun up to 300.  But I guess since its not the meta and bloodied and the cool thing, its somehow less valid and fair?
---
You are talking about the other photo they have on today's inside the Vault. That one is actually a set of vending machines for selling stuff at your camp. This vending machine says legendary up on top and looks like it'll be sitting outside of the train stations.
---
That's the machine that you put the weapon in and get scrip out of. 
---
It isn't re-rolling anything. Scrip needs to accumulate in the player base before the vending piece comes out
---
:(
---
MMOs and a lot of other games have been doing this for years. FFXIV, NBA2K, WOW, and many others have always had a tax and 10% is standard.
---
Its a mystery but since ive added 3 more points i gotten better stuff
---
Trying to school me and you don‚Äôt even know basic math. Lol. While you didn‚Äôt even catch what I was suggesting I‚Äôll go ahead and correct your math. 1100 - 110 = 990. Thanks anyway.
---
Thats the thing though, if your happy to server hop then do it, but dont complain that you 'have' to server hop, its an option
---
Now that makes more sense than anything I've heard all dayü§£üëçüèª
---
 I hunt them. Its my primary purpose and I'm good at it. Gives a guy something to do in the game and I'm always happy to see them. ;)
---
The 10% goes Todd's character.  He can hold unlimited caps.
---
There was definitely mention of one, possibly in the latest patch notes.
---
That's been builadable all along. You can also build inside the house near the Nuka cola plant
---
Right?!
---
As soon as stash weight went up, I just removed a weight reduction perk card and slapped a bunch of shit into my stash. Bam. Full.
---
But as least I have damage resistance out of PA now, haha
---
Are the ‚ÄúFOUNDATIONAL‚Äù C.A.M.P. Adjustments still on the way with Patch 9? Mentioned in this link:
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/tr/article/4gWcpeopiSywMb5GCpPAem/inside-the-vault-new-survival-challenge-rewards-and-more-april-18-2019
---
I havent seen anyone confirm it gives you better legendarys but people with high luck claim they get better legendarys hopefully someone data mines the game and find out cuz im interested as well
---
That does clear up the stars, Thank you, I had no idea why some had one or 3 or none, now I want to fill them up, better get crackin'üëçüèª
---
Yeah, the fact that there are resources that cant be bulked doesnt make any sense.
---
yeah no mention of that, weird
---
-*whispers*- there's not one
---
Can we get a fix for melee weapons not actually doing anything?
---
I just lost a ton of junk because the player that attacked my workshop was apparently immune to melee damage. 
---
My first hit did 3/4 of his health bar and the next 6 hits did absolutely nothing at all. 
---
That's some Borg shit. Wrong universe.
---
IMO they need to offer a subscription service that opens up an unlimited crafting stash that holds all junk items just like they have in ESO.
---
This brings in more money to the game and solves the problem forever.
---
So it‚Äôs related to in-game team setting then? Yeah i don‚Äôt think it happened this much until recently. In the past I thought it was just lag.
---
I bet this would work well with the "assigned" component of the new punch bowl/display cases/etc.  Just assign a holotape to the machine.  Even better if the exterior of the machine changes to match the holotape.
---
Must be nice. I went through 30-40 film.
---
Could very well be. But a machine doing that wouldn't have any need for a slot for coins or for the conveniently place to 3 slot machine reels at the top-left.
---
You know, they've snuck things into every update of this game one way or another without explaining everything, could very well be that machines used for both.
---
I highly doubt it. I ran a 12 luck build for over 100 hours and never got a single 3 star.
---
I've got 14 luck and still get garbage
---
It mentioned a way to display bobbleheads in the last into the vault -- I am also very stoked for the display case.  Wondering if they are easily replaced if someone attacks the camp though?
---
I saw this the other day and did a double take.  Thought it was a mistake.
---
however much space they give us we will fill it and cry for more.. there must be limits...
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm curious about as well. Is this just some urban legend or is there factual data to support a high luck build leading to better legendary drops.
---
Was on an Adventure server last week or so and there was a high-level (200+) with a Wanted Reward of 5000 Caps. Pretty sure that's the max, given I expect they'd have had a much higher price otherwise lol
---
Yep luckily i play solo most of the time, then on that special occasion, ‚Äòmain menu‚Äô happens.
---
Will decorations and player vending allow you to place items for sale on shelves and tables?
---
They literally said it's dealing 100% extra instead of 20% and they are fixing it. Thanks for the downvote though.
---
I am not saying that people who play and grind this game will have nothing to show for it but that even with a group of 10+ player averaging level 230 that you can still be missing important gear. 
---
Example my friend is looking for a bloodied explosive shotgun faster reload (any shotgun) for a month and a half and has yet to find one for sale, I am looking for a max level instigating explosive faster reload lever rifle. We have yet to find any available except for the ultra rare one being sold for other god tier equipment which we also don't have. Both of use have decent equipment and max caps and a lot of staple flux and yet we still haven't found one.
---
All we can do is grind and hope to get lucky on reddit.
---
That‚Äôs weird. I get 3 star legendaries probably 2/10 times I do a run through of the burrows or something. I don‚Äôt even have a luck build either, mainly melee
---
Don't those also have like global market or something (it's been awhile but I'm sure you could search for items to buy)? FFXIV is the only I played and it makes in game sense there, you're charged a fee by whatever entity is indexing all the things for sale.
---
See, I‚Äôm expecting the reverse of your situation...
---
They went back to adventure because the cap reward wasn‚Äôt worth the risk
---
Nerf shotguns again, sad
---
They've said the machine converts items into scrip.
---
The scrip is then taken to the Berkley Springs train station that isn't on the map yet to be given to the Female Mole Miner that is selling legendary items.
---
Also a way for them to see how mich scrip is in the world, so they can price accordingly.
---
I got a zealot gatling laser and I'm trying to get a prime receiver for it to make it an ultracite zealot gatling laser. Is that possible or am I dreaming?
---
Data only confirmed that condition of the drop is only effected by luck.
---
I‚Äôm sending you a cease and desist: I thought of Abraham lincanator first
---
I am more bothered by you not knowing the rules of monopoly than the 10%.. lol
---
Some guys I was playing with yesterday said as my level goes up, 3 star will become more common. I‚Äôm level 90 and they were in the 250s, but they said eventually the drop rate gets better. I hope that is correct.
---
Just have some faith luck works lol where do you farm ledgendarys at
---
Tonight I will make a John Wilkes Booth character and find you...
---
See, I‚Äôm expecting it to go similarly to the evolution of WoWs legendary system in Legion, where it goes through three or four revisions, not quite getting it right until the very end, then being made obsolete a couple of months later.
---
Hey there, we are actively investigating this. Can you reply to this with your ticket number?
---
11% of you only add 10% you wouldnt get that initial %100. For example. You want 500 for something? If you increase by ten percent youd sell it for 550. If you sell it for 550 ten percent of that is 55 which means you get 495.

 &gt; Hey there, we are actively investigating this. Can you reply to this with your ticket number?
---
This is sick. I don‚Äôt understand how people are so accurate with the creator. I try and make it look like myself and it ends up looking like the most generic dude on the planet. Great creation!
---
I'm doing this every time I fond someones camp from now on lol
---
Nope. Just read the article on the Fallout Wiki (my memory was a little bit fuzzy) and the Super Mutants were created by the Master. He experimented on wastelanders by exposing them to FEV and some of them turned into Super Mutants (albeit mostly with very low intelligence), while others didn't. He reckoned it had to do with radiation contaminating the FEV effects, which is why he needed Vault Dwellers, since they were pretty much rad free.
---
His lieutenant had an other theory. The bombs that hit The Glow caused the FEV tanks present at that location to be released into the air, while also being mutated by the virus. All the Wastelanders that got into contact with it were basically vaccinated against it from that point on, hence why he thought that Vault Dwellers worked so well for creating smart Super Muties.
---
So before that, no Super Mutants.
---
Get the  luck of the draw perk to help with durability. I want them to fix the heavy gating for the energy weapons. Getting stick in an animation where you gun is stuck sucks.
---
Well then, we both have great minds and great minds think alike.
---
I‚Äôve also heard that the higher the level the more camp budget is available, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs not true
---
Identify what actions are part of the event
---
Assign them values
---
Award rewards from the event directly based on point totals. 
---
Yes, this will cause problems for people that disconnected in an event. But it will also eliminate the AFK'ers sitting around waiting for rewards and the problem with not being able to find the SBQ or Sheepsquach corpse to loot.
---
They just want you to use it on accident.
---
It might be location
---
My weights in nukes and missiles.
---
Cant sell to vendors but dont wanna drop...
---
(I did, painfully)
---
Junk for me stays under 200lbs usually
---
Actually sold off 90%of stuff just for like 4 plans
---
And trying to track down the base lights ):&lt; spent like 2000 when all i needed was high tech lights set
---
Such is the two tiered loot system.
---
Caps are worthless so you need good gear to trade for good gear.
---
But you don‚Äôt have to rely on RNG to get the exact two items you want, you just need to procure items of similar functional value to trade for them.
---
You can do this by grinding or trading players in game who are unfamiliar with the fact that caps don‚Äôt even have fiat value.
---
Thanks so much!
---
That‚Äôs like saying have faith Bethesda will fix every single bug in this game......... pipe dreams.
---
Yeah I read the entire thing too. That really has nothing to do with what I posted.
---
How many of them were there? A hoard of Legendaries sounds really intense.
---
I have a theater at my camp. Abraham is expected to come over for a movie.
---
Good point. I shouldn't give the impression that I got this in one shot. I took a bunch of photos while backpedaling around the farm. But not 30-40 shots, more like 10.
---
Really?
---
That blew my mind. I wonder what other weird places can be built at.
---
Please do it would be a fun interaction gt: tuskedcargo99
---
It won‚Äôt help
---
Damage is ridiculous
---
Its not from 9 to 20, its from 5 to 20, meaning that it will be 36 with ammosmith, thats probobly good enough but we wont know until the patch
---
It was supposed to be a reply to a different comment....
---
You have to load them back in. Other players won't even get a tape you load in.
---
That is one of the issues I think arcade cabinets would fix.
---
So at my events people need their own tapes, which is why my current life in game is constantly looking for extra copies of all the tapes.
---
The shotgun is OP at the moment. Not the perks that make up the build. That is how it is different. Read what the page said again. For starters, it is showing the wrong number for damage in the pip boy. But I don't need to explain it, the page explained it rather well.
---
For reference though, my 40 shotgun? It is decimating everything in my wake. Or was before I left for work. Explosive is it's only legendary effect, and it outshines -everything- else I have. I have no explosive or shotgun perks. Shotgun Boom is OP without perks atm. Gauntlet is not.
---
Wait now were complaining about pvp stuff in the pvp mode wtf
---
I wasn't upset about the initial TSE nerf, it made sense.  This just feels unnecessary.
---
Agreed. I still think 20 is a little low but quadrupling your ammo is gunna be very noticeable.
---
I mean that's always going to be true. But it wouldn't happen as often.
---
I mean, it‚Äôs literally only an issue for that single enemy. Every other enemy takes plenty of damage from my grenade launcher. In fact, it basically has the same damage as my shotgun, albeit with a much slower rate of fire.
---
The issue isn‚Äôt explosives balance or me doing damage, although explosives are certainly underpowered... especially the heavy explosive weapons. The issue is either the queen has ridiculous explosive resistance magnitudes higher than any other enemy AND shotguns are bugged against her, or both are bugged. And that‚Äôs assuming that you even have to do a % for it to count, which is still hearsay at this point. It‚Äôs possible that what I‚Äôm doing/using has nothing to do with the problem and it‚Äôs just random.
---
The game has too many balance problems, and weapons are a big part of that, but in this case I think it‚Äôs the queen that‚Äôs the problem.
---
If you're in a group you can't damage that person anyway.
---
You make it sound like Bethesda just went down a list and starting banning people for no reason. Live games generate logs, logs are reviewed and characters on accounts that are showing up in said logs are investigated. Every single game company who runs a live game does this. 
---
Sure sometimes false flags are thrown in logs, but that's why when you get an email telling you that you've been banned etc, you have the option to repeal. If they have many logs of you being an ass or doing something against the terms of service, then enjoy the ban.   
---
Don't cheat or do anything stupid that are against the terms of service, that I doubt most read, and you wont get banned.   
---
People can cry all the want. Random Internet "White Knights" can try to come to their defense, but you just end up looking like an ass. I'm sure Bethesda has a list of names for these people who go on their forum to cry about their ban. Deleting their posts or locking them so others cant comment helps keep the trash down so the real issues can be seen faster. 
---
Half of these people that cry "I got banned for no reason" did something to get banned. These are the people who destroyed the economy, used cheat engines, duped, or did something else to violate the TOS. No one cares if they are a paying customer. Misuse software, get banned. Read your TOS.
---
Where do you guys farm at you probabaly farm the wrong places
---
That's almost as bad as the Wood Ticks, Wolves, Rad Roaches, et al opening a door just to come and attack you -.-  lol
---
Happened to me yesterday. All I could do was sigh... *(well,and promptly bash it into meat paste with my Power Fist, naturally!)*
---
Doing bd damage to sqb or sheepsquatch is not the only way to be usefull in those events.
---
As a sneak build your in a great position to do crowd control so the heavy hitters do not have to worry about them. Hop on a roof, crouch, kill.
---
As you gear up better and refine your perk loadout to optimize damage then move into more of a boss killer role or continue to assist with crowd control.

No man, I‚Äôm not trying to be edgy. I‚Äôm just tired of lazy people like you. It‚Äôs not our job to convince you to buy the game.
---
They reduced it in a previous patch? I haven't been paying attention so I just stopped making turrets period. Going to have to try them again to keep those Anglers off my fucking lawn in that case. Lol.
---
That‚Äôs the majority of where I go.
---
I feel like players should be able to craft larger stashes over time. This way, new players learn how to manage it a bit while our friendly neighborhood level 300's get the buff they need and something to work on.
---
If you do the work, it‚Äôs your kill!
---
So from what I saw there were like 5 but they were not legendary so thank atom
---
Ah. See, I'll hang out with some rando in Survival, but I'm not teaming up with them and letting them know where my camp is.
---
Don't carry much junk or aid, contently spending my caps so i can't loose 'em. You can kill me just fine but I'm not paying all those mats to repair my camp.
---
Dang that sucks I get the best legendarys there
---
The 7th.
---
Selling any??? Lol
---
Read it once I got to work, and definitely pleased with this change. Less pleased with them nerfing my explosive shotgun but I understand that one. A 40 shotgun with explosive shouldn't be outshining literally everything in my arsenal.
---
Although this method uses ballistic fiber.
---
Shotguns were destined for the trash can in Appalachia.  :(
---
You can't get stealth bonuses on SBQ fights. Too many people/mobs around. Just swap some stealth perks out for damage/utility, and start taking on adds and doing what you can to the queen in between waves. Revive anyone who goes down, wail on the sbq when she lands. 
---
You'll be fine without focusing on legendaries.
---
That's cool! Hopefully soon we will have new animations - anmitunes come to the instruments when we play them, some new riffs and tuneage :)
---
But that still require lots of luck to get that one god roll that allows you to trade for another witch you can trade to get what you want. Most are likely to get a visit from Todd Howard himself then get a god roll item even off by one or not max level makes them just OK.
---
We have put in the hours grinding nuke zones and queens and still end with a pile of crap.Re rolls would let you get a chance to change that and from that +40 pile of crappy 3* you would gain 2 or 3 god rolls.
---
I got and sold a 3 star quad tesla for 25k and I have a bloodied sickle with swing speed im on xbox
---
I agree! We do need limits! Thats why I said keep the limits, but cut our current system if "literally everything goes here" into two more focused groups, it will get the player back to playing the game content sooner an be more rewarding when they need to micromanage.
---
Almost every other survival game has either storage you can always expand by taking up more space and resources or storage that can only hold certain items like food, scraps, and tools. 76 has neither and thats the issue we keep running into. It lacks the control of having an X amount of slots you can fill and has no options not to have everything in a single pile.
---
One day, I hope to see him.  I've got a dragon with his name on it.  üòâ
---
Also aid and ammo take up more space in stash than on your person if you run weight redux perks. Another note is stable Flux weighs 1lb each. I discovered I had over 100 in Flux. I reduced my stock to 10 each.
---
Join us...
---
One of us, one of us, one of us!!..
---
Thank you!!!
---
If you compare the flamer vs a minigun the flamer shoots faster but the minigun is more viable(more dmg higher range) + the ammo crafting for the minigun is about 150 i think
---
So it only can be tones if you now do 20 ammo
---
And for flamer ammo you need acid I think... good L√ºck in farming enough... the workshop with 3x acid dosnt produce enough
---
Todd Howard's toon needs your money because he can hold unlimited caps.
---
Even 1000 would be nice. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Well for FFXIV, only people on your server can buy from you. The servers are still pretty large, but 95% of the player base can‚Äôt purchase your items.
---
I heard they are adding a protection against griefing,where if you're not in a pvp conflict with that conflict they cant damage your camp
---
"\[Username\] of All Trades" for crafting a certain number of each type for the various crafting skills.  Not necessarily one of each specific weapon/armor.  I mean one vegetable, one meat, one blunt weapon, one edged weapon, etc. where you're still "master of none."  It would be fun for my main since he's built as a support class.
---
Also, "Doc \[Username\]" for combat medics.  That sort of thing.
---
You're waiting on player vending to make use of a stash?
---
Dude, go on the market subs. That's way better than what this will be.
---
That means nothing...we all already know that.
---
If this change was being included in the patch it would have been announced in the notes.
---
Could you please link it? I believe you, but I would just like to have to spread around, because people have been in the dark for a long time, it just means more  people lose hope by the week. I'd honestly recommend you make your own reddit post with that to let people know.
---
This is how I feel about the Mole Miners as well as the Scorched. When I'm not in a party, I'm sneaking around the map and I'm not sure if you've heard the Scorched speak to themselves but it makes me kinda sad to hear them say things like "Warm... Again" or "Hurts inside" even the "You at not us!" gets me sometimes. They may not be able to think for themselves much anymore but they can still feel!
---
Yea, as long as there's no fast-travel, it's generally available to build in, even if it's a completely furnished structure. Which I appreciate finding these places. I've been setup for a number of months now at the small 'camp' where the picture for that free "Keep Out" sign that was free in the Atomic Shop a couple weeks back. :D  
---
(Of course, there are exceptions like Wheeldog pointed out, where they've oopsed and you can manage to find a spot high enough that's outside the "No Build Zone".)
---
I am as well. I swear the best weapon pick up I‚Äôve gotten so far was a stupid level 25 1* vampires handmade.
---
Your right it worked \^\^ Thank you so much \^\^
---
That vending machine... It even makes your camp visable?! I-I‚Äôm gonna cry *[Sniff]*
---
Are you on PS4 by chance? I need to see this place. First you had my interest, but now you have my erection.
---
Probably gonna still have them after the shotgun nerf on the same day LOL
---
Unfortunately no I was going too but got distracted by the Queen then forgot
---
Dang bro how long youve been playing and what level are you
---
I want a mic!!!
---
Spoiler alert, Eddie is crazy.
---
Why do you need that many?
---
Still... it dosnt change the fact that you won‚Äôt have 5 seconds fun with a flammer because it‚Äôs 20/36 if you ever tried a flamer and grinded to get at least some fuel to use it you would be 100% shure that it won‚Äôt be enough
---
At present, if you're at 25k and pick up more caps, they just disappear. I haven't seen anything to make me think they're changing that.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3ExPLDXM5fgLJm9WiWLGrK/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-patch-9-preview
---
Says may 7 now
---
Not sure, less than 2 seconds, 10 railway spikes in magazine
---
An update: Turns out updating my drivers turned off the gpu settings frame rate limiter (I'm running fo76 with vsync off, interval=0 or whatever the setting it), it really didn't like running the map at 900fps for some reason lol. 
---
With the limiter back in place my map mouse movement is smooth again.
---
Not your issue as you say you've already got it locked, but if anyone else comes across this, this was what was happening for me.
---
That would still be pay2win.
---
Why grind if you can just use cash to buy legendary scrips to buy legendary weapons and armor?
---
That is specifically what they said wouldn't be coming.
---
I gotcha, at least on my [dev tracker](https://nukacrypt.com/devtracker/6) ;)
---
Edit - Though updating your name just made all your recorded comments show up as posted today. Will have to fix that today.
---
I‚Äôve lost a weapon before due to a trade scam. I submitted a support ticket asking if they could restore my items, but they said they still lack the tools for item restoration. Like what kind of online game lacks item restoration tools?
---
I feel like the travel fee should be taken from your hunger meter. It'd make sense, but that's a regularly renewable item.
---
No you have to scrap the weapon to get mods or just find the plans for them around the world
---
Only way to get there is a bullet to the head.
---
Here man : https://imgur.com/lDKVCIw . I would but any mention of bans or suspensions just gets hate and abuse and negative bias as if you‚Äôre automatically guilty.
---
My framerate is limited though gsync. Vsync is forced though control panel and I disabled it in game with the command.
---
I agree. We do need limits. Just even simply dividing those limits into two seperate piles will vastly improve how players interact with those limits. All other survival games have ways you can or need to divide everything you collect such as Minecraft and Rust have slots or games like Ark you need to put food in a refrigerator. 76 has nothing like this and just our catch all stash. I think it would be better for everyone if we had to spend say 5 minutes in scrap and 5 minutes in gear organization every time we go to camp as opposed to the current 20 minute balancing act we have to play at camp.
---
But I see weapon mod plans for sale sometimes, but only mods that I know the weapon plan for, never plans for weapon mods that I don‚Äôt know the weapon plan for.
---
If you're on PS4 and can get 10 Violet Flux I'll make you some
---
Are we going to fast travel to the vendor‚Äôs C.A.M.P? If so, will it cost caps? Otherwise, not everyone is willing to fast travel to find nothing good, maybe first days as everyone is unloading on legendaries, but it can‚Äôt be free either, low level players maybe travel there and end up stuck there unless they fast travel back to vault 76. Hopefully they figure out that part with something simple or clever to overcome this.
---
I really want those vending machines to come, so much more trading will occur after they implement them, basically eliminating the need to be a dedicated trader in a subreddit.
---
I drop technical data.
---
If on Xbox I can make you one
---
Also add that if you own a workshop (and not in a pvp battle) you can still be attacked.
---
*Lay that pistol down, babe. Lay that pistol down.*
---
*Pistol packin' mama, lay that thing down before it goes off and kills somebody*
---
I‚Äôm on PS4. I have a Gatling plasma, I‚Äôm just looking for more weapon mods but can‚Äôt ever find any. I also don‚Äôt own the weapon plan. I thought there was a correlation.
---
I sent it in a PM.
---
eh i think itle be fine and people are just over reacting, while i dont agree with the "nerf everything" mentality (really i think they need to start buffing things) , imo they are just bringing shotguns down to other ranged weapons level, compared to being up there next to melee
---
Did that really happen?
---
if you don't want to would you like me to? I'd only want to do so if you were completely comfortable with me sharing that link and crediting you
---
Yeah that's too bad. :( In addition to a nice new CAMP asset, it'd be nice for an easier way to access them.
---
Also...I had no idea you could even GET additional copies of the games...I have yet to even acquire all of them myself. x_x
---
Not true, everything that's high level takes way more shots.  Liberators, low level scorched, mole rats, and most other small rodents / bugs do one shot though.
---
Bethesda Support sucks honestly. They only tell you what you want to hear to shut you up and never actually do anything to help you.
---
When I asked them about item restoration, they told me they lacked the tools to restore items. Really? It‚Äôs an online game, but they still haven‚Äôt developed tools to restore items users have lost.
---
Ya no problem man if you think it would help people go ahead!
---
I would love an app so I could view my stash and the rest of my stats away from home, would be great if we could view the atom shop on mobile too. I‚Äôve missed so many atom store limited time things because of not being able to get to my console in time
---
That could be benificial, but like I stated in the top of my post that would either destroy the client stability causing constant server disconnects or require Bethesda to rewrite the entirety of the way the game handles inventory rendering. Realiscially speaking, I wouldn't cross my fingers over either of those happening since its clear the limits are thee to keep us all from having way too much.
---
Someone gild this man, I‚Äôm broke until payday. ‚ÄúYeah let‚Äôs make this shit more cumbersome to use and take way longer because fuck doing anything but sitting in your camp thinking about your workbenches‚Äù. 
---
I‚Äôve crafted one whole Nuka shine. It‚Äôs not really related, but i wanted to say it.
---
Actually, it's at the end of that inside the vault article... They said it's being pushed back a few weeks.
---
Or donate it to prize bot!! Then he could actually give you money! Lol
---
I am glad I am not the only one bugged by this
---
Since it released. Currently level 118.
---
Player vending sounds better than I anticipated. The fact that they're putting player shops on the map along with some kind of summary of what's for sale is some nice icing on the cake. No need for us to relocate to be found.
---
That's the legendary exchange machine.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
They really should just buff other weapons.  Majority are really garbage and they shouldn't be.
---
Lol dang
---
5mm and .50 come in stacks of 100, 180 with Ammosmith, and 360 with ammosmith and super-duper.
---
I think 20 flamer vs 100 5mm is pretty comparable. Still a little low for the flamer, but still a massive buff from 5 flamer fuel.
---
I'd love to see bulk options for everything and make them all save a little weight. Seems silly that it isn't already in game and only two items actually save weight.
---
... every time you repair things. 2 times more buttons to press.
---
Considering your camp will put an icon in the map when you activate your vending machine... I don't personally see this as a huge issue.
---
Most I've seen have said they're staying where they are now.
---
I did see a video where a guy and his buds located a griefer's camp.  He built a camp close enough to be in range of mortars.
---
So, he built about 4 or so mortars, sneaked up to the griefer's camp and chucked multiple artillery smoke grenades at his camp.  It was glorious.  Initially. 
---
Problem is, it became a stalemate with the griefer attacking his camp, so in the end, not much was done as the generators powering the mortars kept getting destroyed. 
---
An improvement on the idea would be get three other friends to cover all points of the compass, all sneak up and toss the marker grenades at once.  The griefer might get one, but not all of the camps.
---
Dragon apparently does 4x damage if all four bullets hit.
---
As a title/mount/cosmetic collector in most online games, I wholeheartedly agree that we need more achievement-based content like this! Titles seem like a no brainer, but then I still can't display my character's name at the moment.
---
Oh you're right. Bethesda better change this before they start getting lawsuits for sprained thumbs lmao
---
Its like 10 acid, some oil and steel, there are actually certain enemies you can actually kill to get acid, kill a bunch of them and you get tons of acid, and honestly, with 36 per craft (potentially more with super duper) you will only be running out of fuel if you are using the flamer as your main weapon
---
I'm thinking the challenges are baked into the game and release on set dates. Not saying g they shouldn't be tested, just that it would explain a lot, like the challenges that still show up on time when the actual content has been pushed back.
---
Yes? I have no reason to lie about it. I and most of the active players on my Discord have lost items recently. Items that have never been selected somehow end up sold, dropped, or deconstructed. Look all the posts on this subreddit, man. Tons of people are going through the same shit. It's a known issue... to everybody but Bethesda, it seems.
---
Guys i would stronger recommend to just sell ammo, and just a little for 3 days to test how it's this machine going to work.
---
I suspect that hundreds of people tinkering around with these machines would create or discover some bugs because they are interacting with your stash directly.
---
Because i don't want people to take everything in my stash for some scraps in exchange or taking other things that are not for sale.
---
Wow rage much
---
I‚Äôm sure if you just remove the wire going from your power source to your shop it will remove the icon from the map.
---
Server hopping is magnitudes more efficient than not. By all means, do it the wrong way, whatever works for you. 
---
But server hopping is the right way to play, in terms of how the game is designed to be played. And it‚Äôs unfortunate, because server hopping is super lame. 
---
It‚Äôs the same issue with fast traveling. Sure, you can not fast travel. But then you‚Äôre missing out on any events across the map, and you‚Äôre spending time running around watching your AP bar fill back up when you could be grinding out loot. 
---
I get that there‚Äôs more to this game than the grind. I try to walk everywhere and change server as little as possible to stay immersed. But... that‚Äôs beside the point. Point is, server hopping and fast traveling are much more effective ways to play, and not doing so is gimping yourself. And that sucks.
---
You're just a sheep until they're ready
---
Any of them had a crown symbol? Normally for a hoard event there‚Äôs at least one legendary boss.
---
Yes it absolutely would require this. ESO went through the same thing. I mean same company right? Surely they can do it right? *Nervous smile*
---
I think that's pretty much a given, but what about the picture of an alien weekly? Scheduling and plain incompetence are surely holding hands in the supply closet if you know what I mean.
---
How is ammo pricing going to work if you want to sell it for less than .5 a cap?
---
Most players would think so.
---
Bethesda could make the same case as repair kits and claim it as a convenience for those who don't have the time to grind for 1,000 hours to get the loot required to be competitive in PvP. Of course there is also a huge sector of the current player base that has already made the argument for Bethesda that weapons and armor don't really effect PvP and that it's more about skill.
---
You must be blind then!
---
&gt;DISPLAY CASES ARE COMING
---
&gt;As some of you may already be aware, we‚Äôre planning to add display cases so that you can show off some of the items you‚Äôve collected, such as weapons, bobbleheads, and magazines, in your C.A.M.P.s. We‚Äôre excited to bring this feature to the game, but it‚Äôs going to take a little more time and testing to make sure we get it right. As a result, display cases are going to arrive a few weeks after we release Patch 9. We know many of you are waiting to be able to flaunt your collections, and we appreciate your patience.
---
I too would like to know this. And also, don't have a mic, if that is okay.
---
Awesome. Thank you.
---
I usually fast traveled to it. It usually did not trigger for me. Until yesterday.
---
I've done the same. A hunting rifle that was 20+ is now only 6. I also stripped material mods from armor and made them all ultralight.
---
you actually can't. i'm pressing repair kit repair by accidet a lot of times a day. Good thing you have to choose, which repair kit you want to use, even if you don't have shitty one
---
Agreed, but at present, you're not selling things for potentially thousands of caps without your own intervention.  If you sold a TSE weapon for 20K caps in your vending machine, but were already at 22K caps in your inventory, how would you want the game to handle it?
---
I had an issue with the valley galleria at some point, apparently.  I just unlocked it with a new character today and got the atoms for The Mire.
---
My whole approach to player vending involves buying and selling holotape games. Haha
---
I was going to but PS4 has this ridiculous limitation of 50 photos.
---
I think you'll start getting lawsuits for bad jokes first
---
You can fix it by walking a character there that hasn't been there before.  It sucks, but it works.  It's helpful to have a friend in that area, but not too close, for the free fast travel.
---
They need to make all notes that are not essential to quests, non pickupable. There are hundreds of notes you accumulate, each with it's own name. I know they take up no stash space but if it's a server load issue that prevents them from expanding stash, get rid of notes. 
---
I'd also like a stash that is ONLY accessible at camp. No need to strain the server all over. But a small stash to keep excess weapons, chems, and junk that we dont need to access on the fly.
---
I went to the Quarry and the Queen popped out of the water. I circled around to the storage shed to the North and... much to my pleasant surprise there was a King! Pacified him while I got the Queen out of the pond, then went about trying to get them close enough. 
---
Finally did, and knowing I was lacking the "Hunter or Spawn", I snapped the pick anyways and.... "COMPLETED!" o\_0
---
Apparently there *was* a spawn somewhere in the weeds!
---
Points is: It worked for me (on PC).  
---
But I empathize with her either way :\\   
---
Did she make sure that, while 'aiming' the camera, the little Identification in the upper-right? Not to patronize either of you, but it won't register the photo otherwise, and sometimes it takes *forever* to actually show up -- even if you're well within range.
---
Which, let me gripe about the distance in which you can ID something with the camera... -.-   
---
Hey Bethesda... WHAT FRIGGEN GOOD IS AN UPGRADED LENS IF YOU'RE TOO FAR AWAY FOR THE GAME TO REGISTER WHAT YOU'VE ZOOMED IN ON?!?! ^((I'm using the 105mm for the record))  
---
That is all.  
---
\[/rant\]
---
I won't put anything on my vendor machine that is worth over 10k. Most of the stuff will be plans in the couple hundred caps range, so the "tax" is more than worth it for me to be able to go out and loot more valuable stuff than what I am selling.
---
Right, through an auction house that in at least the cases of WoW and FF (11 and 14) has an in-game group with a reason to exist in the lore that is operating and advertising those services.
---
This is something we build and maintain ourselves - and the lore is that there is literally no one alive out here except us.
---
Agreed! I also hate that the only way to alphabetically see your stuff is in bulks. Waste Acid is under Molded Plastic. I know it's a bit OCD but I like my scrap in order.
---
You are stuck being defenseless until they initiate it against you. 
---
I think there needs to be some corrections to the way contestation happens, because currently, almost every advantage is given to the aggressor. You stay vulnerable even after the workshop is no longer actively contested, and can be attacked anywhere on the map.
---
With in-game items already being removed from the world to account for that - from which we get less than 25% of the value back in caps so the value's already been reduced dramatically for anything you sold to a vendor bot.
---
This is the answer I choose to believe.
---
Risk reward ratio is pretty good tho
---
I'm not talking about how I want it to be, just how I expect it to be. ;)
---
An increase to the cap limit would be nice, but it doesn't sound like they're giving us one unless it's to be a surprise. 
---
On the bright side, having a cap limit will probably keep prices from getting too high.
---
Duping caused massive inflation of the in game economy.
---
I didnt know there was an app coming to be honest
---
You could focus on critical hits or grab a hunters/zealots prefix gun and add a scorch killer receiver to increase damage against SBQ and her minions.
---
Apparently the queen is both an animal and a scorched. So either of those two legendaries work.
---
You are just joining the Free States for "my soothing voice"
---
Level 124 and 95% of drops are just awful, but then again getting those rare 3* legendary items was never meant to be easy.
---
Does everyone get a free plan for it or do you have to find it in the Workshop menu?
---
Apparently the machines need power to show up on the map
---
You don‚Äôt have to server hop to enjoy the game, but you do have to server hop to grind efficiently. Yes, of course it‚Äôs optional, but that‚Äôs not what people mean when they say you ‚Äúhave‚Äù to. They mean that it‚Äôs by far the most effective way to play. Because it gets you exactly what you need in ~5mins, as opposed to running around the game for hundreds of hours and hoping.
---
The issue is that the game is built around it, despite their attempts to keep servers out of the picture. Not that it‚Äôs mandatory.
---
Ok, but do not touch my chip
---
I made it, thanks again.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bk0tnl/update\_on\_suspended\_accounts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bk0tnl/update_on_suspended_accounts/)
---
What do you mean camp away from camp?
---
Couldn‚Äôt u just build a bunch of terminals and use those like arcade machines? I think it‚Äôd be more fitting for a character in the apocalypse to make something out of what they have than to just magically find restored arcade machines.
---
if the system is the same like the preserved cake chance it would be fun 
---
i only got it 1/100 tries lmao
---
If it happened to you on more than one occasion (also with ISS), then maybe it‚Äôs related to the total damage output. Say if a 50 cal bullet does 150 damage, when the weapon fires at 30 rounds per second, that‚Äôs 4500 damage per second. If a grenade does 500 and you can fire at 2 shots per sec, that‚Äôs total 1000. I just pulled random numbers out of my head to illustrate the point. The problem is not the grenades themselves, it‚Äôs the total damage output in a given period of time before the queen is killed.
---
There's an easy solution, every account that has been banned for duping should have their characters deleted and made to start again, it's not difficult.
---
The only thing I can think of for an actual reason for the 10% is to keep players from buying and selling items for a slight profit. I.E. if I buy something for 200 I have to sell it for at least 222 to just break even.
---
Theoretically there's unlimited caps, but it takes time to collect them, whether from doing events, farming cap stashes, or selling to vendors.  So caps would naturally accumulate over time, creating inflation, but there are other controls already in place.  Fast traveling and getting reduced caps back from vendors are two big ones, they take a steady supply of caps back out of the market.  Selling to other players bypasses the vendor sink, so this 10% fee is a middle ground where there's still a sink but it's easier to sell.  I think it's a fair compromise.
---
I know right? They need to add a value to nukes and missiles or at least let us dismantle them. It hurts just kinda dropping them.
---
Honestly I'm about at the point you are at usually hovering at &lt;510 of my stash because I will never give up my screws and collect cosmetics with 65 of gear on me, but I know its only cause there's a lot of Junk I just don't touch and I don't have anything left I want to build at camp or gear I need. I think we are not part of the majority of players that do want to collect and grind for better loot or more building. The issue is in mid and late game where we would be considered "end game" at least for now.
---
NBA 2k and other sports games with an auction house charge 10% and there is no lore built around that.
---
I don't think anyone knows for sure.  I'm guessing not a chance that happens.
---
Well you can still get them by buying them from other players, but yeah you can't get them by dropping anyway.
---
Not even that. Just delete the huge amount of same items and let them keep only 1 of each.
---
Now I want to know who did it so I can give him karma. lol
---
The amount is still pitiful imo. 20 fuel (36? with ammosmith) will get pissed through in seconds. Should be hundreds like .50cal or be full tanks like plasma &amp; fusion cores
---
You probably encountered one but didn't realize it. \*\* legendaries are generally better than \*\*\* in terms of drops.  The \*\* generally drop \*\* loot where \*\*\* generally drop \* crap armor.  If you picked up any \*\* legendaries most likely they were from an \*\* enemy not a \*\*\*.
---
To be fair a lot of duplicated god tier items were removed that would also increase the price of the remaining ones
---
Funny at one point in time you grew up with this person in vault 76. Too bad our vault wasn't a murder cult.
---
A buddy of mine showed it to me last night. We were in a team and a friend was in our world but showed in the main menu, and we showed the same for her. He dropped me from the team and she was now available to team but my buddy who was still on the first team showed in the main menu. As soon as he left that team we could invite him to the new one.
---
Theres not.
---
yeah give us a simple place everywhere scrip with just up, down, left and right for camp mode ;)
---
and fuck console players lmaooo press f
---
Ironic that they would choose a slot machine. 
---
It will be an interesting day when Bethesda is called to testify before Congress about the introduction of gambling mechanics into video games
---
They've proven they can do that, there is no reason these people should still be banned, just laziness.
---
Yeah what is it with some doofuses????  Had one offer to trade.  Only wanted my best hand made, i said nope.  Then he pitched a fit and was whinging that i had a lot of loot, yeah being l00p + you grind out a fair pile of stuff.  But did he want any of the one or two star weapons, nope just my one three star.  The dm on xbox was annoying, esp the profanity, my friends kids play as well and dont need to see that.  Utter wankspangle...
---
Even if you lock your doors, there's almost always still a way in. My personal favorite way to sneak into peoples' bases is by opening a window and activating furniture or a workbench on the other side. Not to grief, just to use their workbenches or stash. I do like to leave a pile of ammo to let them know someone got in, though.
---
No. Vending is in caps. Anyway it was a response based on world immersion. Technically, they probably want to remove some caps from the economy.
---
So an automated farming system in Minecraft.
---
Doesn't cap limit prevent any kind of real inflation? I have no issue with the 10%. Im just trying to understand how an economy works in a game. I thought the 10% was to prevent players from buying and selling for slight profits.
---
You need to create a separate post for this!! Great job sir.
---
Ah, good to know.
---
I did but it got downvoted to oblivion. I'll post again so make sure you upvote :-D
---
Oh I'm right there with you. It would be amazing if we could turn in say a dozen 1 star for a decent 3 or something like that. I have 9 mules now that are nothing but weapons and armor I've farmed I'm saving with the hopes it will work that way. I have learned that fo isn't really geared towards a no life player like me who grinds for hours a day. It's for the general gamer and that's fair. I think it's my expectations that have to change vs the game itself. I am hopeful but realistic.
---
TIP: build a water purifier camp , sell water and buy the items
---
They already did that before a lot of people got suspended. Don't know if it changed anything, but I know Bethesda already tried that.
---
I am able to sell quality 1* stuff right now. You could just put it in your vending machine instead of exchanging it for scrip.
---
Super duper only doubles the base amount and ignores ammosmith.
---
&gt; Do you remember when the burrows was going to be a challenge for 2 level 50+ characters?
---
They misjudged it. That's all. It was their first thing like this they released. And whilst I was also very underwhelmed by it, I'm sure they'll build up off this in future for the other dungeons.
---
&gt; Our community manager is more likely to comment about how poop in a bag left on someones bed is hilarious than to address any question on repair kits and there is a dev tracker to prove it.
---
They are still only community managers and there's only so much they can talk to us about, so much they're allowed to. They're going to have to keep quiet about certain things, especially big things like the repair kits. One wrong comment from them about those could be a PR disaster and result in them getting fired. And, in case you didn't realize, Bethesda addressed the concerns in the patch notes for the update that released them.
---
&gt; As far as the roadmap goes can you name one major roadmap release that has hit its initially communicated release date?
---
yes. Everything except the camera has been released on time. Might have been one other thing that got a slight delay, but very little has.
---
You are looking for problems where there aren't any. Bethesda have been communicating well, especially compared to many other games companies.
---
I would settle for just seeing our actual character names in the game. I mean, we're supposed to roleplay and be the NPCs... that was the whole premise (and rational for no NPCs) when Fallout 76 was announced... and the very first step of roleplaying is your character name, not your account username.
---
Otherwise there is no point to even naming our characters.
---
It would also be great to be able to rename our characters. We can change our characters' sex and appearance, but we can't rename them?
---
I'd be willing to pay 50caps a month for a storage unit of say 1000 lbs.
---
Will do bud!
---
Anything worth over 10k is worth the time to to find a buyer on Reddit and go through the trouble of arranging a meetup.
---
To tell the story again. There was 4 of us. Every conceivable angle, zoomed in, zoomed out, shooting without the marker, trying to get it to pop up, etc. Raised and lowered the camera multiple times which has helped before. Kept it aimed for several minutes, etc. The spawn and king would register in the viewfinder, the queen would not.
---
I have a feeling that the only remaining American fallout streamer uses Melee, so they don‚Äôt fuck with it. Everything else though? Fair game -_-.
---
I used Gender neutral names for my characters, haha
---
Yes. We definitely still need a way to decrease inflation no matter the cause. Right now I cant get a super nice handmade because I don't have another good roll to trade for it. I can't buy a god roll anything right now with my caps because everyone is cap maxed and caps have consistently lost value over the last few months. So what we have are only people who have good roll weapons trading with other people with God roll weapons. Anyone else is left out of the high end economy.
---
You really need a trusted bud and a mule character. I fought it for so long, thinking that was playing against the nature of the game. Now that I tried it, holy shit, it‚Äôs the ONLY way I can play this game.
---
I wasn't aware my shot gun was doing double dmg
---
Stupid question... how do you change the emotes on your wheel? :|
---
i think the problem is the terrain, because it's not flat, and you have foundations for you camp but not for your resources.
---
Some dirt foundations to place crops and other things would probably help since i don't think they could give us the ability to move objets precisely and much less to be able to smooth the ground xd
---
Easy grandpa he‚Äôs just a bot
---
Any fix in the works for plasma goo puddles and laser ash piles making legendary items disappear?
---
I just sent u a friends request sir!
---
Or Bethesdea might just tear it down for shits n giggles
---
Lulz......is this a shit post?
---
I understand it sucks for newer players are people with less hours in personally I've never trade it for anything I have a full-on yielding character 3 and 2 Star gear I have a full weightless character to Star and I have almost a full Sentinel character all found myself
---
The new meta will be to fast travel to a vendor camp, then find the nearest Scorch Beast and train it back to the camp.  Mob led griefing FTW!
---
Ok.  I‚Äôm hopping on now for a few  min.  Can you come to my camp?
---
There ya go -

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bk0z1a/bethesda_please_consider_making_a_proper_survival/
---
Give her a thumbs up please and a nice comment! :-)
---
No word on the laser weapons? They are still made of cardboards
---
Kinda. ESO uses a completely different engine and thus every single mechanic works differently and the game is handled by ZeniMax but published by Bethesda. 76 is STILL the same engine that has been stuffed full of addons since 2002, hence why there legacy issues still exist. 76 iss made by Bethesda's Austin branch to my understanding. So maybe we will see major changes eventually.
---
Hasn‚Äôt released yet, same as the handmade one.
---
I disagree. Can you go buy a piece of heavy sentinal armor (something good like vanguard or chameleon) for 2k? Can you go buy a TSE handmade for 2k? The duping actually brought the value of those items down because there were so many going around, it created price competition and made end game weapons and some armors available at a more entry price point.
---
Right, but that would mean she has very high explosive resistance, which is what I was saying. That still doesn‚Äôt really explain why my shotgun doesn‚Äôt work either, despite unloading in her face. 
---
I tried again last night and plinked away at her with a crappy Gatling gun that barely did damage, and apparently that was enough. At this point, I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs just bugged. Either because shotguns/explosives don‚Äôt work, or because it just randomly won‚Äôt give loot. I don‚Äôt think my damage output is the actual problem.
---
1400 Atoms.
---
I think the new backpack will have something like this
---
They said in Adventure mode not Survival
---
This post was more just me bitching that we can't reroll lol.
---
if anything it did the opposite. Supply and demand. Duping actually increased the supply, which means reduced prices.
---
The issue is one of cap sinks. Especially with the consolidated vendor pools, it's very easy to rack up 1000+ caps a day. That means in less than a month of play you can max your caps. Especially once you've been playing for a while, there's very few things worth buying for caps- most highlevels have the vendor plans they want, vendors don't have shit for them, the only things they're chasing are rare things other players have obtained. And if all the players are at max caps, nobody wants to buy or sell with caps because they don't have a use for them.
---
That's the reason the Imposter is a 2k buyin- they're trying to manage getting more cap sinks into the game.
---
Unless you can gamble something that you can easily turn back into dollars, Congress isn't going to care.  
---
And no, selling your gear on eBay (against the ToS) doesn't count.
---
huh that‚Äôs funny, the robot at the train station offered me 60 caps for mine
---
Never... alone...
---
I have a matched set of rolling pins thank you very much. Exterminators and troubleshooters both with +40% power attack damage and 40% less damage while power attacking. Fully pimped out they do..... Not much damage since my 2 characters are rifle and shotgun/medic/crafter. I need to make a melee character. I've got so many weird great melee weapons.
---
It‚Äôs called reading the road path, fridges have been mentioned lots in the passed. Read updated on Bethesda.com.
---
That was an interesting video. Seems at some point Bethesda should start offering some type of exchange for caps to Atoms.
---
Duping created an environment where you suddenly had a lot of very wealthy people with an unlimited supply of caps to throw around. This drove the cost of everything up.
---
Basically the equivalent that printing money has on an economy.
---
You can get it for less than $60 if it's a disc copy.
---
I wonder if you see a lot of sacred geometry while on DMT
---
exactly. this just makes it easy to sell lower value items while you go out and actually do stuff.
---
Well shit. Someone else said yes.
---
Inside the Vault released today (5/2/2019) confirming that legendaries can be redeemed for a resource that lets you purchase other legendaries. Coming May 7th. 
---
Looks like your farming will pay off!
---
Coming in late is not that bad... It's when YOU start an event and have a bunch of douches destroy the boss unnecessarily fast and you don't get to get your 1 star exterminators pipe wrench
---
I think the legendary trader will help balance a little. I've got a ton of legendaries I'll feel less bad about selling if I know I'm potentially getting a better one.
---
The conversation between MODUS and ZAX (&gt;!President Eden!&lt;) was a cool little treat, once I realized who ZAX actually becomes.
---
Really I can‚Äôt wait to get this event on finally. Thanks for letting us know is in the game and works.
---
While leveling, sure.
---
At max level, it's all about the mods so you can mod your legendaries, so yeah, think of a gunsmith as the guy you take your shiny new legendary to to customize it to your liking.
---
She*
---
I've killed it before, I'm just wondering why he didn't show up this time
---
Remove legendary all together..
---
Ill be there with u soon as i can! Ill keep u in my friends list too, u are the only one who offered to help me lol üòÇ
---
Make sure to reward those that complete the challenge with good prices at least, I would probably crack open a beer and watch people die to traps like that
---
Thats a shame :(
---
Supply and demand economics decreased the prices of the gear that was mass duped but it drove the cost up for items that were not duped. Look at what Railway rifles are going for now...... it's a result if people with gigantic pools of caps who profited from selling duped gear and serums.
---
The same thing that happens when the fed prints money.
---
The day I compare Fallout 76 to an arcade basketball game has not yet arrived sir or madame.
---
Right my anti aa explosive only does 280 and im running adrenal at low health. They should leave it as is.
---
I just did that site last night! Got the queen, king, and little baby lurks together like a family! Also remember, they don't have to be alive to do this! I remembered this after dying once and continued to die (partially thanks to ol buddy TheDoyNextHouse *Great Name lol* ) in survival mode a few times!
---
So it's possible! Go to the Mire to do that thang.
---
ALSO! Gripe time! All my loot bags went into the air and disappeared, so lost a bunch of stuff last night! Mine cause of last laugh perk blowing my ass out each death! Went to sleep mad but satisfied with the challenge! There's my thoughts, cheers and love y'all!!!!!!!323n!!
---
But you can‚Äôt accidentally use a repair kit and need to buy another one if they remove the option.
---
I know, but in this case I have the correct answer.
---
Dense mods can only be learned from plans found in game, not through scrapping. There are several others like deep pocketed and ultra-light, which are also only learned through plans.
---
There's a hundred things that make no sense in-game.
---
This game has a serious inflation issue due to a lack of ways to get caps back out of the economy (remember, you can make 1400 caps a day from vendors, that's less than 20 days to reach max caps, with very little in game to spend caps on once you've been playing for a while) so they're trying to come up with new ways to get caps out of the economy. It's why the sheepsquatch costs so much to summon.
---
FO76 is extremely lore breaking. Doubt they'll bother giving any explanation for the legendary vendor.
---
"Some of the best"
---
It's plasma, should anything be higher?
---
Fucking agreed.
---
Yep. At least ¬º of my team has this problem each night.
---
The only problem with completely removing legendary effects is that the PVE part of the game would have to be completely rebalanced for survival mode.  
---
If they only worked against PVE targets then the PVP conundrum would be mostly resolved.   
---
For PVP to proper work legendary effects would have to not work in PVP, perk cards would need rebalancing and mutations either removed or also rebalanced.
---
Even if it's useless drops, they should at least be 3* useless drops.
---
You know it's going to be like a 1 to 100 exchange rate scrap 100 stars have enough to buy a 1 star
---
So bummed. I had been planning a Flamer support character and just recently decided to go with melee instead since flamer fuel is so hard to get. Hopefully they decide to fix friendly fire soon..
---
Hey, I'm still saving up for more of those expensive plans. Those complaints are jerks.
---
There is a confirmation, but its also pretty damn easy to buy them accidentally... its like it was done on purpose
---
Yeah no way they would do something like that on purpose /s
---
Anyway yeah that‚Äôs what I was getting at. They probably put it there so you‚Äôd accidentally use a repair kit when you didn‚Äôt want to
---
Crafting literally 5x as much is a big deal. At least you can use it pretty regularly. Not full time, but events for sure.
---
I like all these ideas. I'm on the fence about the legendary items though. I think it might be ok without them. Pvp would likely be better.
---
This would definitely be my new c.a.m.p. location.
---
I agree, the people who comment that are almost exclusively people who took advantage of the dupe meta
---
The option exists because you stand a chance at *accidentally* using it and thus feeling the need to purchase more
---
If it drove everything up then why does a TSE handmade go for 2k now when it started at above 10k?
---
Yes it introduced far to many caps into the market and it crushed the value of some items while driving others up. Another example is the hunters long coat. When that first was discovered it went for 10k and now most people wont spend over 2k for it. 
---
What really drove the prices up what the drop rates in the game. I'm not saying everyone needs a top tier item each play session but hear me out: Why is it the queen, you know the only end game boss for the first 5 months of the game could drop drills, syringers, wood armors, and anything but a 3* item, especially now when shes an absolute bullet sponge. Furthermore, 3* enemies are not all that common and yet they too fall into the previously described queen stat. If the game would guarantee the item had as many stars as the enemy then there would be more stuff of value floating around which may or may not lower the cost. People dont come off of good 3* gear now because there is no real good way to farm 3* items.
---
Gone indeed.
---
Killing the SBQ or Imposter Sheepsquash repeatedly isn't earning it?
---
You understand a lot about the game just by the fact you have to add "not being sarcastic" disclaimer to the post so that people don't get you wrong.
---
It‚Äôs not just basketball, almost any game that has a market feature has a tax. I used that example to show you how widespread it is.
---
There is no rolling
---
I'm in PSN?
---
Hahaha!  That's why I love this game!
---
In the sheepsquatch event you can take one of the 3 pylons, hide and dont get killed. Only think you need is enough stimpacks. When the sheepsquatch get visible hit it with a distance weapon to get your loot.
---
The best way to make everyone happy would be to have them only work when fighting in PVE.
---
PVP should ignore all legendary effects for it to be fair and balanced.
---
Sorry for not using bold on "adventure mode".
---
My first and only time in survival, I went to kill a wounded player and did no damage.... Until they liked me
---
If I were an attorney working for Bethesda I would have advised not adding a slot machine into a game that is a skinner box. If they are ever called into a courtroom and tasked with defending their game against being a slot machine they are going to have to answer for...... actually putting a slot machine in the game.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
*spends hours farming legendaries mindlessly*
---
I worked hard sitting on my ass playing video games.
---
The cost of railway rifles right now have nothing to do with that. This game has an issue with a lack of cap sinks. Literally this game prints caps every day (1400 a day). Anyone who's halfway interested in making caps can reach max caps in &lt;20 days JUST from vendoring shit. At that point, why the fuck not pay 20k caps for whatever random weapon you want? There's nothing else to spend the caps on and any "new" caps you gain are going to waste, so might as well reset your pool and have an interesting weapon in exchange.
---
I've got 2 accounts. If I really wanted to, I could make 14,000 caps a day (2 x 5 characters). And have not much to spend it on, because everyone else is also at max caps and thus doesn't want caps in exchange for anything actually worthwhile. Like, yeah, I could go ahead and buy plans for every power armor mod plan at the vendors... that'd keep me busy for a few weeks, but I don't even want those plans.
---
I have an even easier solution: stop breaking the rules, assholes!
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm not trading anything in until I better understand the mechanic. Might have more value selling it through my vending machine.
---
I play every day and in all train stations I make a point to use the colored suitcase (or tan, if there isn't colored \[or container closest craft station, if no suitcase inside\]). I leave stuff there, and in Flatwood's Overseer chest all the time. Not just excess Junk, either, but Plans and Recipes.
---
If I have a worthwhile Legendary, I make sure to track down the closest level to the item (higher *or* lower), and personally give them it. Otherwise, usually a higher-level ends up just vendoring it. I don't care if the person I gift it to sells it... if that helps them more, then by all means! 
---
I've just seen too much of things I'd left, get dumped into the vendor, is all. I used to collect the PA around Watoga while I was trying to get my own complete set, and I'd leave them and the frame inside the train station. Come back 30mins later and the frame(s) now bare, the armor inside the vendor :(
---
Load into a different world where your camp can be placed. Check your stored space. Chances are it wouldn‚Äôt disappear unless it was dropped on the ground.
---
What part of  "i mostly use it to cripple enemies" your little brain cannot comprehend?
---
We need outfit mannequins
---
How else would you "customize" an item when you first roll on it? By rerolling.
---
That's what I've been telling for two months now. People were so way over on their expectations how RNG is going to be thrown out the window with Purveyor.
---
People need to go and farm 5k candies from monster mash, then see how great that reward is. Heh.
---
Because they were mass duped.supply and demand economics . Inflation is different.
---
On console I never get problems like that, just the periodic shutdown that happens in the worst place possible.
---
Please, don‚Äôt be dull.
---
Don‚Äôt strawman my arguments.
---
This whole conversation, *subreddit even*, is in the context of playing a video game. 
---
So if I mention ‚Äúhard work‚Äù I‚Äôm talking about hard work in the assumed context of the video game.
---
Just stop.
---
The weird thing is that shelves and tables kind of already have this property. You can slightly sink decorations into them, and you have to pull them up to get them to actually sit on the table. You‚Äôd think it would be easy to make it work this way for crops too.
---
You're right, basically that's how it is now.  Last couple months I was aggressively buying any good item I could.  Now those same items are impossible to buy with caps.  Been about 2 weeks since I was able to purchase anything good.  
---
If there was anything to use caps for maybe I would get off my stash of guns worth over a million caps, most of which I've never fired.  Two sets of PvP armor I haven't even worn yet. There are many like me, and they aren't using the massive amount of quality items they have hoarded either.
---
This is theft by all means!!! No taxation without representation!
---
even if you press it accidentally, repair kit choosing window shows up, so you can always go back
---
So what you're saying is, when changes are made to a game, there's a chance that someone will find an exploit that didn't exist before.
---
I think you may be onto something, stop making changes!
---
Seriously though, sure there are exploits, but they can't fix them until 1) they know about them, 2) can reliably reproduce them, and 3) figure out a way to fix it.  There are problems associated with each of those things, so it's not nearly as simple as you might think.
---
My wife and I do the same thing. I love when someone has their camp locked down right but I find my way in still. We leave Salisbury Steaks.
---
One time in survival I found someone AFK at the Welch train station and I left them some Salisbury Steak so they would know how close they came to a pipe pistol in the head.
---
I have a tse handmade but I‚Äôd like something good in return, it‚Äôs my only tse and I‚Äôm really close to being able to use it. No caps or PA
---
I am curious if you will be able to sell ammunition as well as items. I collect tons of ammo that i never use and usually just drop it but am aware that others might like to get ahold of it for their weapons.   Granted im sure a lot of people will sell much more rare items like serums, gear, flux, and what not but i would like to see ammo as well.
---
Add us: Papertattoo and frizzyliz316 we will be on in 20
---
I agree, please remove it. I won't rename items at workbench either, I'd do it in my Pipboy. I just wanna repair quickly again. :(
---
TSE handmade for 2K now is because of the TSE nerfs.  When they nerfed TSE's allot of the TSE weapons dropped in value right away.  They became allot less effective, so why wouldn't the prices drop?
---
No, this is terrible. Please, *PLEASE*, believe me when I say you're missing out on huge opportunities. If Scrip were to be tradeable, the player economy would revive.
---
As it stands, so many players looking to trade high-end legendaries are stuck maxed out on caps, sometimes for multiple characters. If you were to make Scrip tradable, loot would be able to move around much more smoothly and more often than now.
---
Please tell the team to make them tradeable. The player economy sucks, and player vending will definitely not fix it as long as caps stay maxed at 25k or stay the only tradeable currency.
---
If you'll be on later tonight I'll see what I can offer you in game
---
I‚Äôm telling you, it happens. People get frustrated with lag and just start smashing buttons. I‚Äôve mistakenly plowed through a confirm screen or two. 
---
I also don‚Äôt really know for certain if what I said was right, but it makes sense
---
The cap limit does help because, well, people can't horde unlimited amounts of caps.  But there are other things of value that you can horde to bypass the cap limit.  Serums, for instance, can sell to vendors for 400 caps each and with the right perks weigh very little.  There are also Weightless legendary pieces that can weight literally 0 with the right mods, so you can hold an infinite amount of these and have essentially limitless caps stashed away.
---
The only true way to prevent inflation is to take caps out of circulation.  That way, even if you do horde other items, your total net worth gets chipped away over time.  Some people might still accumulate value faster, some might lose value faster, so it's a delicate balance that must factor in the entire economy.
---
You might be right, the 10% might be to help prevent day-trader-type sales. "To maintain a healthy in-game economy" is kinda vague.  But I'm more inclined to believe that actively removing caps is for inflation control.  No reason it can't be for both though, they aren't mutually exclusive goals.
---
Just because sugar bombs is your daughter and wife, and you're her uncle doesn't mean I can't love her. I am her brother after all.
---
In the same vein, will server-hopping change what the Purveyor has available? I am already reloading / save-scumming all the time to re-roll vending machines in Borderlands games (only there it's worse: you need several reloads to even be **offered** a legendary item), so I'm not totally against that, but it would be disappointing nonetheless.
---
Do you have anything in specific?
---
Good point.  The problem is we need effective cap SINKS in the game.  We really don‚Äôt have those beyond plans/serum recipes.  The imposter circuit board is a step in the right direction, but the difficulty  combined with existing, unfixed/unaddressed issues of legendary drops (bother disappearing bodies and the true intent of 3* mobs) make it a ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù approach for most.
---
What one really gets down to is to drain caps, you need to convert caps to legendaries.  The purveyor is an excellent opportunity to do this, but it seems they are going a route that may just make this another item with currency problems, unless trades become tse combatshotgun for 2000 scrips (that is, a replacement currency).
---
I‚Äôm really not hopeful on this ever being fixed, sadly.  I think the purveyor is going to be a missed opportunity when it‚Äôs the first big chance to really address this AND put an in-sight goal for legendary gear for players, that isn‚Äôt endless server hopping.
---
Thank you! This game is huge. Free DLC? Consistently listening to the community and providing reasonable solutions? Some of us are not programmers. We have no idea about the EFFORT and TIME these HUMAN BEINGS  spend trying to develop and foster a platform for our enjoyment. Didn't like the product? Tough luck, kid. Life lessons galore on the U.S.S. entitlement.
---
Maybe they should make it so our junk is stored only in our c.a.m.p so it's not taking up space or allow us to rank up are camps to obtain perk cards that reduce weight for stored items
---
Yeah! Sounds great!
---
Spoiled food still gives diseases. At least it does on herbivore so I'd assume the same applies.
---
Yeah but you summed it up right there, i dont see pkaying the game as a chore so runni g arpund for hundreds of hours and hoping to get something suits me a lot better than the instant gratification generation that now play, i dont think people should be able to get super weapons in 5 minutes, but thats clearly just me here, but i would much rather get a cool ass 3 star super weapon after working my ass off to get it and not have it just handed to me
---
No it doesn't apply to spoiled meat. I didn't understand the second question.
---
Cost a lot though to get the rights
---
You will get dysentery. And no.
---
I mean.. obviously
---
well, you can, just dont use dude
---
Or a Syringer, I still get those in place of Legendaries even though I coulda sworn I read a patch note a while back claiming to of fixed it.
---
I have all kinds of legendaries. Couldn't start naming exactly what I have but in game you an look for yourself and see if you want anything for that handmade TSE.
---
They deal the same damage? That seems bugged.  Instigating will deal a stupid amount of damage in one shot, so I'd stick with that.
---
Lmao @ Sugar Bombs
---
Plenty to pick from that are public domain too!
---
How many times do you edit your comments? Every time I get a notification from you it‚Äôs something shitty and incoherent, then I go to the thread and you‚Äôve backtracked on half of it. I‚Äôm not debating semantics with someone that has to take multiple attempts to form a point.

People took the very few sentences he said, and wrote their own hard and fast rules on what they expected. Period. Sounds like you did too. And you got let down and your feelings are hurt and now you are bouncing between lashing out and covering it back up. 
---
*heavy heavy eye rolls*

The salt in this post
---
Psn is rammsteingeorge
---
Also, yes to the second bit. If you combine it with lead belly ionized meat becomes the best thing ever.
---
Any lever actions? Good shotguns? Chameleon armor?
---
Alright!
---
At that point I'd be killing them all so they dropped right next to each other, and then try once more. Corpses ***DO*** count for the challenges! :) At least, unless they begin making ones that state it has to be alive, which would be OK by me.
---
Don‚Äôt forget Radicool. 
---
Even if you don‚Äôt want a true Bloodied Build, carrying some rads in your health bar will boost your strength, raising your damage output in all weapons and at also lifts your carry weight.
---
10 lbs overweight to fast travel? Take a few rads and boost your carry weight to get home.
---
They 10% tax is the sink hole to drain the excess out of the economy. The idea to raise the cap pool doesn't work because it creates more inflation and the rich get richer and the poor never get a chance to catch up.
---
The economy was never designed to be flooded with top tier gear. People were supposed to to keep that stuff for trade only. Instead people duped their handmade and sold a bunch and then turned around and bought TSE laser........TSE flamer........TSE dildo......etc......etc.......
---
Printing money.....or in this case caps.
---
In a recent update one of the notes said they would reduce the repeat plans we were getting. Not sure if anyone experimented with acquiring but not learning the plans. May be the solution.
---
On the bright side, you have a higher chance of acquiring serum plans now right?
---
I agree! The notes are probably a huge slap to the client and server that I never see people suggest to get rid of!
---
I'd need to look at the exact way 76 handles the stash, but basing it off FO4 and the linked workbench system it just accesses the same pool. Like in FO4 lets say Sanctuary's storage is "Bench1" and Red Rocket is "Bench2". Once you link it with a traveler, it will combine them and accessing the storage at ether place is now accessing a pool called "Bench3". By making them this way there is only one pool that items are accessed from, Bench3 in this example, but can be accessed at two places. At no time there are two Bench3's being duplicated or else it might give a kick to performance. Bench1 and Bench2 stop existing but FO4 also kept track of what items need to go to them again if the link was ever broken. I HOPE 76 doesnt keep save which stash deposited each item as that would be so much needless code I would scream.
---
I HOPE 76 has all stashes link to the same pool and not ever being duplicated/adjusted on the fly, but I cant be sure. The video I wanted to make to show these legacy issues was on Fallout 4 I was going to make 24 workshops and 23 containers, the 24th being my players inventory, all containing 150 items with over half of them being unique and the other being duplicates like junk to replicate all the players and stashes on a regular 76 server. Doing this in FO4 we'd see the game grind to a halt much like 76 does proving its just a engine issue that I hope Bethesda will address some day. If I ever will take the time to make this is still up in the air, but wouldn't be offended if someone else did since its been like 5 months of me sitting on my hands.
---
Oh cool
---
Maybe Todd was telling the truth, but they went a different way but kept the gambling art look of the machine in the game.
---
I appreciate the advice with lead belly, I'll try it out for sure and thanks for the reply definitely was hoping it worked lol
---
Oh well, diseases here I come.
---
Ouch could have cashed them in and used it to get one you wanted. But from now on you will know
---
Bring prices down?
---
That item worth 90 caps I'm now going to be selling at a mark-up to 100 to compensate for the 10% tax.
---
not as fast as pre durability buff patch, but yes it still breaks stupidly fast compared to other weapons
---
I agree! If they expect us to spend this much time playing the game, at least give us some simple quality of life changes.
---
I agree, but I'm glad that it isn't.
---
Dang, alright thanks for the answer. Spoiled meat is a no-go then
---
That's only fair, explosive shotguns were doing twice as much damage, insteast of the supposed 20% more.
---
Get a TSE flamer and be really, really surprised when it's time is up, too.
---
Just a shot in the dark here OP, are you a Minecraft player?
---
This is what I do. My laptop can run the game but not well.  Just enough to transfer stuff.  I actually bought a second copy of FO76  and use my mule (which will eventually be a non P.A. build) to hold about 500 lbs of legendary stuff and 100 fusion cores.  Planning on making more mules this weekend to dump all my crap legendaries in prep for the legendary scrip machines. You know you'll need thousands of scrip to get anything decent from the legendary vendor.
---
That's because that patch only fixed laser weapons with the word rifle in them.
---
Did Gearbox get called into court for their slot machines?  Boderlands has had slot machines forever.  
---
Second life has full on gambling with currency you can sell back in states where gambling isn't outright illegal (Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Tennessee don't allow it).
---
The difference between 'games of skill' and 'games of chance' come into play sometimes, when real convertible currency is involved.
---
Plenty of games include gambling, it's perfectly legal pretty much everywhere if you can't directly convert your winnings into money.
---
From the video you posted ‚Äúsomewhat customize‚Äù and he emphasized somewhat. Sit down with your emotions.
---
It's a hate crime!
---
Or have a friend help!
---
While I can understand the sentiment for punishment,  as someone who does have their account suspended for duping, I personally wouldn't start over. Not out of spite or anything, but I already experienced a lot of what the game has to offer, and would rather experience another game if it came down to restart or don't play. I'd understand and even encourage a mass deletion of items as it's only fair, and would definitely still play , but an entire character wipe would make me not want to play. If that's they're judgment hey fair enough it's their game.
---
Well yeah if you want to have two accounts. Only few players go that far. Having two or several chars is enough for most. And then you use other players to transfer the stuff.
---
I know, right? Watch this...
---
Alpaca

pre TSE nerf I was 1 shotting level 50 supermutant , post nerf took 5-6 shots ....with this nerf your lookin at 10-12 shots ....that's just asinine...
---
Ironically no one has realized I dropped a bag on the ground in front of me when I use it yet. -.-
---
Thank you for expanding on your answer. Sounds like the 50 cal mods for hunting rifles.
---
I agree
---
Done
---
This is fairly standard in online games. If you look at WoW or ESO's auction houses for example, they typically have two things:
---
* ***A listing fee:*** This is usually paid back to the seller once an item has been sold, but is forfeited at the end of the listing period (however many days the auction is listed). This is usually some sort of nominal deposit to ensure you don't just dump items you don't need into a 30 day listing with no plans to sell it simply to free up your inventory/circumvent inventory or bank restrictions. In FO76, you don't really need this as items are stored in your STASH which has limitations placed on it already and listing items doesn't circumvent these.
---
* ***A "house cut":*** This is a tax which is usually around 10-15% (sometimes higher) to help mitigate the otherwise inherent tendency of online game economies to inflate into infinity. In the real world, the government makes decisions on how much government-backed currency to print (among many other levers) and this in theory helps to keep inflation steady at a small %rate. In online games, money is poofed into existence out of thin air...it is not controlled on a supply-side, but rather controlled by how many and how active participants in the economy are. Trading for caps to other players may take the caps out of your inventory, but they do not take caps out of the overall economic ecosystem...so without some taxes and [gold sinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_sink) to help move currency out of the economy, the currency becomes devalued.
---
That's the basic idea anyway!
---
 This game also has what I find to be a unique issue: the bottle cap...cap. With a maximum cap on the number of bottle caps a player character can carry, you've essentially paralyzed many people who may otherwise be sellers to sit on items or revert to a bartering system in place of accepting the in-game currency. I think this was an attempt by the developers to limit unbridled inflation that we see in other online games, but without enough effective gold sinks you will still have players essentially hoarding their caps until something new comes along. 
---
The Whitesprings plans and Serum recipes are definitely built to be gold sinks, but I think FO76 should take a note from other MMOs and allow for:
---
***PAID RESPECS***. Charge a huge price (price it based on the number of SPECIAL points you've acquired) and PAY CAPS TO RESET THEM. No option to partially reset, charge a whopping cost for the convenience and watch the caps flow out of the economy.
---
Had someone do this to me once actually, but instead of raw fertilizer they placed a bag of toilet paper, cooking oil and cream on my couch.. still not sure what to make of this, but I scrapped that couch afterwards obviously.
---
You just replied twice to my unedited post, clearly you're the upset one here.
---
So because they were duped the price was set high at the start? I dont think so. Caps are so easily obtainable in this game that it is insane to think a gun like that regardless of the nerfs would go for under 10k. I have yet to see a TSE anything drop for me and I have around 700 hours in. I've gotten a bunch of other explosive stuff but never a TSE. Inflation is there because the game has been out for 6 months and does not have a good way for endgame players to farm 3* items to sell at decent prices. I'm sorry but that is just how I feel.
---
TIL
---
A camp rank system would be a little fun. Maybe base it off of some challenges, how much we have built, or total plans earned. It would be the perfect time to implement a completion list for those plans too! That would at least reward the player for the 20+ minutes they spent in the camp.
---
TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION 
---
NO FUCKING WAY, COMMIE!!!
---
/s
---
Those + need a cry emote. üò•
---
agreed I can also see this as a way to conduct trades. like make the item you want to trade at max cap and hanggel from there
---
Yep, that's how it's been for ages now. And the price for EU code has been about 15 euros for ages now, doesn't really look it's going up or down.
---
I don't know how it's restricted though. I can play on US server just fine, of course it could be the login servers are handling the restriction.
---
That‚Äôs strange indeed. Yet they now want to nerf explosive shotguns even further. Don‚Äôt know what they are thinking but apparently no love for shotty and power armors.
---
Just move your camp. Instant repair.
---
..
---
Soooooo....
---
You‚Äôre agreeing with me. Okay.
---
Added
---
Thought they changed that?
---
If you're on PC I can donate steel.
---
Please tell me, where I can buy modifications for Enclave plasma rifle? Or plans? Modus doesn't sell it. I'm sure, this gun have a lot of modifications, but we can't learn plans from scrapping or buy mods. All I found is just a scope in Watoga Station...
---
I'm hopping on now plus since your lvl 17 I might need to tell you how to put the excavator pa in your inventory because it is lvl 25
---
Console peasant I'm afraid. Cheers for the offer though!
---
You edited it, you nerd. Reddit doesn‚Äôt flag a post as ‚Äúedited‚Äù if you change it within like two minutes I think. Which you know already. However. Continue being wrong.
---
These are just ‚Äúspeculations‚Äù not facts so I‚Äôm still having a bit of enthusiasm
---
I agree just like back in fallout 3
---
Please read the number from ingame!
---
Come legendary scrip, and I will lose majority of the crap I have on my mule.
---
Okay!
---
With Carnivore, you still get diseases from spoiled meat, and it provides 0 food. Strangely, with Herbivore, you can eat spoiled anything (meat, fruit, vegetables, etc) and not get diseases and you get food benefit. I guess the game considers all spolied food (including spoiled meat) as plant food.
---
Listen, I‚Äôm not here to nitpick... but that‚Äôs definitely a suggestion 
---
....also, this is definitely me nitpicking
---
Are you hitting right on the deathclaw statue? They are on that same line.
---
Did you learn them? Or hold them?
---
I like the way you are thinking. Haven't tried survival yet and wasn't really planning to try it. But what you propose interests me. Reason why I don't play now is when it launched initially I read all the complaining about losing aid items and caps. People sure got rich the first couple weeks. I just waited. 
---
Now, it's a one shot or two shot gunfight. Again, not my thing so I just wait. What you suggested sounds like a really good idea.
---
Learned
---
They were 3 dead bodies within 10 feet of each other.
---
Scroll through them and when you see one that shows an option to expand just hit R1. Hope I explained that right üôÇ
---
Well, what you‚Äôd rather is beside the point. The game is designed so that server hopping and fast traveling is the right way to play, again, in terms of how the game is designed to be played. 
---
People who server hop and fast travel aren‚Äôt just looking for ‚Äúinstant gratification‚Äù. They‚Äôre playing the game how it was designed to be played. You‚Äôre the one who is doing it ‚Äúwrong‚Äù, if there even is a wrong way to play a game (which there isn‚Äôt).
---
I recommend trying it out, and seeing just how effective server hopping is. Then maybe it will put things into perspective. I enjoy running around playing the game too, but I can server hop for five minutes, get what I need, and then run around playing just fine. They aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive.
---
No, you just tag the materials you need and go murdering and looting corpses.
---
5 days to collect as many as possible!
---
Yeah, back then you could one shot any regular enemy without even a specialized perk setup. You at least needed a strong build along with a tse shotgun to one-shot a scorchbeast. I doubt you can still do that now. Doesn't change the fact that explosive shotguns are still easy mode though
---
Where's the player vending machines?
---
Oh good idea
---
Do you have a deathclaw statue? If so, I believe the eggs would be an alternative there. Sorry no pic.
---
The other thing you can do is to toggle all buildable items. Then it should be easier to find.
---
Mine would be ‚ÄúLeafa The Mighty Cannibalizer‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs by design. I killed SBQ four times yesterday, definitely did most damage, got two stalkers‚Äô knives, one lead pipe and one piece of armor. Pure RNG? Absolutely not. Legendary drop has been nerfed two patches ago when they removed all watoga bots from legendary pool.
---
Please add this. I've lost two weapons through accidental drops. I know I'm not alone in this. There used to be a mod to prevent this but the author stopped updating
---
this would be cool for the items that you have added as your favorites.
---
I think they are doing it this way to keep the players who still have 1k worth of glitched stuff to get around it
---

Hehe... on PC. :)
---
The mystery meat pie recipe from Toxic Larry's uses spoiled meat I think. Unless you're eating it for a Biv quest?
---
Thank you for taking the time to read and your kind words are appreciated!
---
Hope so, gotta check it out
---
Which is a lot more effort than a repair kit.
---
75
---
Could be worse. Could a syringer or a drill.
---
üòí
---
Uh it's only good. We are constantly getting more and more caps, with nothing really good to burn them into. This vending tax is good to reduce a little bit of caps. We'd need other things too but this is good start.
---
Funny the irony is I have a free states tag on my name üòÇ.
---
Oh, I totally didn't know that kinda a game changer for me. I might end up becoming a vegetarian all of a sudden.
---
I really just want to avoid having to worry about food and just eating whatever plan was to use butchers bounty and carnivore to eat on the go.
---
No. You can use my spreadsheet to see what is learnable from scrapping and what requires a plan.
---
I just name mine, and my armor as my so and so, seems to work relatively well, but always check before you sell stuff, or even stash it if you're concerned :)
---
Ionized meat is good without having a useless perk like lead belly.  Considering how easy radaway is to get, and the fact you can have a decon shower, lead belly is a waste.  By the time you're strong enough to source ionized meat you should be able to mitigate the rads.
---
They implemented something kinda like that recently. If your item is favorited, it‚Äôll have an extra pop up screen asking if you‚Äôre sure you want to sell. On that screen, the confirm or back out buttons are switched so that if you‚Äôre just spamming sell, it won‚Äôt let you until you decide to by hitting the other button.
---
My Turrets auto-attacked a wanted player last time one went near my camp while I was in pacifist so I wonder if players can use that to proc ability to damage your camp still. There's also training mobs to your camps to get them to damage it and you're not messaged that it's under attack. (I've heard it exist that the game will but I've never seen it personally)
---
Well, that makes sense, because explosive weapons in general are very strong. Shotguns in general are very strong. Again, it‚Äôs the queen that‚Äôs the problem here.
---
I don't think shotguns need to be this overpowered. You already have enforcer to trivialize ~80% of the enemies in the game if they can even survive the first couple shots. We don't need explosive shotguns also getting a fuckton higher boost than any other explosive weapon
---
Or not. I guess alpaca bot died.
---
My thought was the tokens gave you chance or random roll on an existing weapon. That was the way I understood it when it was explained by Todd Howard. A chance to achieve your ‚Äúdream‚Äù weapon or armor piece. Idk the details of it, like if you can have one chance to add a star or if it re writes a star idk. Any thoughts from anyone else?
---

---
to bad they are the same exact weapon with a different stock/grip attached...
---
also you got proof? cause i feel your claim would be huge news if a dataminer provided proof that the decay __rate__ changes based on the stock. as of current theres no proof of different rates, just different max values
---
Nah, just wanted to eat spoiled meat because I always have lots of it lol really don't want to worry about food on my second character
---
Taking time to craft food and micromanage it gets tedious (although fun sometimes surviving) wanna avoid it.
---
Think they were mentioned as a possible atom store item or something to that effect.
---
I believe that one the plans are learned, they are removed from the pool. This prevents you from having to kill the queen hundreds of times for a 1/17 chance to find the plan you haven‚Äôt learned.
---
I'm on PS4. Not sure but I think the wheel should look the same for you on PC. The option to expand to the gift one is under the trade emote.
---
He always does that!
---
Nope, still works. Some fuck nugget did the same shit specifically to my rad shower a week ago. Moved camp over a tiny bit because I didn't have the flux to repair.
---
Probably but like I said in the post after I saw the ‚Äúgroup approached‚Äù I dipped (aka ran away really fast) so I can‚Äôt answer that. Really sorry.
---
Duplicates will not drop if learned , I found that out after learning half
---
Does naming them prevent this? I honestly can't remember. I know putting a skin on will prevent it, but I know those aren't exactly common. A trick I learned in FO4 was to put a symbol like a hyphen in front of the name and it will filter those to the top, easy way to filter your favorites.
---
One of the the best new games out right now.
---
It's mostly annoying to have break the habit of actually repairing my stuff instead of wondering where the hell 3 random repair kits came from. Frankly, if I use one, it won't be at the bench. 
---
Idk if it's been stated before, but the repair kits are a distraction. I spend my time scavenging and punching things to death. I find it annoying to be offered a shortcut when I just spent the last few hours scavenging and punching things. In the higher levels it's not even useful when I spend that time to 2HKO 8 Glowing Ones consecutively and barely break a sweat or my Power Fist. 
---
Bethesda, if you want me to spend Atoms, give me a mountain bike. I'm dead serious.
---
Oh sweet. I'll give it a try. For some reason I thought that got changed recently.
---
Hope someone important sees it.
---
I'm honestly just shocked at how mad you are over this.
---
O really I've never even noticed that, how many item can you favorite though I thought it was only a certain amount?
---
Joining you!

PS4.

From the preview picture there are slot machines, so you've been proven wrong even more. Ouch.

Vending was already supposed to come out, but was delayed, and rescheduled for May 7th.

---
I never said anything about content. It's always been there, but the issues at launch were more gamebreaking issues like the damage bug, dupers, infinite scorchbeast spam, constant disconnects/crashes, infinite load screens, etc
---
Aw, okay. Figured if you were on XB1, I could help.
---
I think it's more of the push towards micro transactions that is the game changer.
---
Those states that you reference also have strict laws on how high of a take that a casino is allowed to structure the payout on their slot machines for. The casinos theoretical hold on a slot machine is only allowed to be as high as 130% percent in most states. Is that RNG that Bethesda uses fair? Or is the game rigged so that you're unlikely to get what you want so they can keep you around for the micro transactions?
---
As gaming companies and their CEO continue to push the limits of profit it is inevitable that Congress will need to intervene at some point.
---
From the post today you can only scrap them for scribs which is a currency to use with the new vendor
---
It's the thought that counts. Ty regardless.
---
How does that prove anything?
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm trying to figure out what the dog helmet / armor is for?
---
Can‚Äôt pet or adventure with [this dog](https://youtu.be/T9HgQopMYgQ), but at least you can have one at your camp.
---
Me too! I guess it's just a matter of gaining some exposure so fingers crossed enough people like what they read :-)
---
This is the exact opposite problem I‚Äôm having. I finally have all these caps and no one wants to sell anything anymore. They just want to trade one item for another, making it impossible to get the stuff I really want. The cap limit needs to be raised or something.
---
They fixed that. You don't have to leave the bench and return to get info to display now.
---
A dog? :)
---
&gt;They want you to earn it, for it to be special and it to not be guaranteed.
---
So how many hours of grinding and farming are enough to consider it "earned?"  What about a player who finds a level 50 God tier weapon at level 40, and another who is level 200 and has yet to get one? How exactly does this factor into the idea of it being "earned?" As for the vendor my expectations could not be lower.
---
I was planning to under price things I sold vending, but if we are going to loose 10% of all our sales, I guess I'll have to over price a lot of it. üòû
---
I think this will make it a lot easier to get equipment for newer characters. Lower level characters cans save up caps to buy a decent weapon/armor to farm legendaries easier, then sell the legendaries they obtain for caps to purchase a stronger weapon/armor.
---
Not possible you can gat a primed recover and get a primed zealots Gatling laser. An ultracite Gatling laser is a separate gun with separate mods. It has its own primed receiver. Making a primed ultracite Gatling laser.
---
&gt;Are we going to fast travel to the vendor‚Äôs C.A.M.P? 
---
I would assume so, since they will be marked on the map. Even if not, pretty much any camp is going to be near a FT target anyway.
---
&gt;If so, will it cost caps? 
---
Very likely yeah.
---
I gave you an upvote as well
---
Now we need toilet paper guns.  To TP other Camps.
---
Updated.
---
"Buy"? Seriusly, just do the queen and you will have more kit that you can use!
---
Thank you very much :-)
---
Ya that's kinda what I want to happen like how the skins are. like they dont even show up now unless you take off the skin. And they won't show up in the trade menu or vendors which I like alot.
---
you get better loot doing events which is sad.
---
Right. Don't need no P2W repair kit.
---
That you could roll and customize... your legendaries... you still remember what discussion is about right?
---
So you're saying we should pay money to make the game easier?  
---
If only there was a name for that ;)
---
Why would it cost atoms? They have never said that
---
It did that to me last night... I‚Äôll check again thanks!
---
You trade in weapons for scrip, which can be used to purchase weapons from the vendor. I assume the sold items will be the same globally, so you won‚Äôt be able to server hop for better rewards. You will not be able to reroll legendaries.
---
In the patch notes I read it says they made them last twice as long, which doesn't sound like much of an improvement.
---
I mean, there *is* a gold .44 skin
---
I forget who said it, but quoting an earlier post from today.
---
It's not a nerf if they're fixing a bug. It was never meant to do that much damage. They are simply fixing a mistake/bug.
---
Yeah, but it was out for like 24 hours
---
Aren't they obsurbly strong because the explosives proc on every single pellet and can do crazy damage without a specialised build?
---
Or is this a cunning shitpost?
---
Noobs die from an explosive weapon. They go and cry TSE shotguns are OP Bethesda please nerf. When they actually got deleted by a bloodied explosive handmade.
---
It doesn‚Äôt prove that you could reroll existing ones though. Do YoU StiLl ReMeMbER WhAt DiScUsSiOn iS aBoUt?
---
Wow, a p2w FO76 troll in the wild!
---
Don't be silly.
---
The tame option, as far as I know, only works on creatures who show up as a random spawn AND are by themselves (try just west of South Mountain Lookout and in the parking lot of Cranberry Glade). As for them getting back to your camp, it is the luck of the draw. They can take minutes to hours and can die en route. Try to server hop after a couple of hours and see if it shows up. Best of luck.
---
I would like to see something like this in F076  [https://bethesda.net/en/mods/fallout4/mod-detail/4014791](https://bethesda.net/en/mods/fallout4/mod-detail/4014791)
---
No. he was, you were his dinner :)
---
I just leave
---
But what about mutation serums?
---
Players selling so many duped weapons that the only thing they could spend their cap stash on was super expensive serums......and then they turned around and sold those for even more profits.
---
If you think that Bethesda bean counters didn't crunch the numbers on the economy when they designed the game.....I don't know what to tell you.
---
Duping was the outlier that the bean counters failed to account for.
---
I know, right? He must be playing with some weird house rule. It‚Äôs called /free/ parking lol
---
Your question is a little vague so I'll try to answer what I think you're asking.
---
If you drop stuff on the ground, by selecting 'drop' in your pipboy, those items appear in a paper bag at your feet. Those will disappear if the server crashes or you switch worlds. Same goes if you put stuff in a world container (overseer's stash, duffle bags, metal boxes, etc.) that's not your stash (containers that say 'my stash'). If you build structures at your camp, you will still have those, but if someone else has a camp in the same spot as you when you switch servers, you will get a message at login telling you your camp cannot be placed. If you choose not to go to a different world, the next time you place your camp, all those structures you built will be under the stored tab and can be re-placed without material cost. 
---
Now, I'm wondering if you're asking about workshops vs camps. Workshops are public buildable areas. There are a dozen or more around the map. The things you build there are built using the workshop's own material budget (until it runs out). When you switch servers, those will be gone and you don't get anything back for them. Even if you've used some of your own materials building there.
---
Let me know if this doesn't fully answer your question and I'll try to help more.
---
They did fix it. Then they unfixed it the patch after that. Lol.
---
Bravo for your honesty! I understand why they banned everyone, it changed the whole economy of the game, on xbox at least. There for, I wouldn‚Äôt have any of the top tier weapons I have right now without people like you, who bit the bullet so the rest of us got a taste of something we would likely NEVER get. So it may not be a popular opinion but thank you for your sacrifice! I hope they don‚Äôt just delete your account.
---
Stealth is pretty useless unless your by yourself. It might be worthwhile to level up and invest in other perks, that increase your damage and don‚Äôt depend on stealth.
---
I‚Äôm on xbox one..
---
Sounds like a popular Nuke target.
---
Actually, if you think about it, this doesn't break the lore.  If FEV was in the experimental stages pre-war, then the use of it to create Super Mutants with non-irradiated individuals pre-war wouldn't be out of the question.  Additionally, the Master operated on the west coast, while this is on the east coast.  It isn't out of the question to believe that separate facilities on opposite sides of the country could have similar results without being connected.
---
Duping destroyed the in game economy?
---
Yes I agree.
---
They can still take it. You only need to be within the build area of a workshop to take them now. That's why they're such griefer magnets now. They can sneak into the outer edge of the build area, start claiming it, and immediately drop you with a VATS crit to the head before you even know they're there.
---
It pop up and im happy as hell
---
The flamer has a massive potential dps, and is intended to be limited by the ammo. I think that the buff to ammo crafting is great, and makes it about as powerful as other heavy weapons overall.
---
Charlie Bell
---
I'm sure that this would be great but it would make farming water way to easy and could be exploited easily
---
I use it sometimes. I don't prefer it in any sense but idk, it's there.
---
Thanks! Any plans to add a radium rifle?
---
A bag full of black titanium and nuclear waste. But that was because some yahoo got mad at the vendor and tried to shoot him with an explosive shotgun.
---
because endurance is kind of a meh special stat. most people only use it for fireproof now
---
Lol look man I'm at work and can not look through my stash box at the moment, so other than knowing I have a shit load of legendaries..... We will have to talk more in game.
---
I wasn't either.  It sure doesn't feel like it
---
Not yet. I can't deal with non-ballistic damage yet.
---
It's fine how it is stop complaining
---
Exactly. The problem, I believe, isnt top teir guns, its not being matched with players at the same level.
---
Yeah, but it would still be nice to have,  my armor isn't on the favorites wheel and I'm not a PA user so I always have to be real careful when I 'm in my hazmat suit selling stuff at Whitesprings during a nuke event for instance.  It would be nice to just have the option of locking certain gear from being scrapped,  sold or even just from showing up in a trade window.
---
More like troll
---
There's also the issue that the game has been out long enough where daily players have been able to acquire decent legendaries by now, and are only interested in player trades for the "god-rolled" best-of-the-best legendaries or legacy legendaries. Look at the trading subs, I'd say 95% of posts with actual decent legendaries never get a bite, but a god-rolled weapon or Sentinel/Assassins armor sets will have a ton. So people are there, just most arent interested in most things anyone has to offer. Player vending should help trading amongst the people who arent frequenting the trading subs or discord
---
Thx!  Better to server hop when I'm desperate enough for things I want unless I'm not in a party or took over any workshops.  :3
---
So this would make it a useful stat and increase the average overall HP of players
---
no it isn't. I'm not complaining, it's just feedback
---
Make sure to only farm locations if the enemies are above level 45. Enemies drop legendaries near their level, rounded down. This means that a level 42 wendigos will drop level 40 and 35 legendaries. I‚Äôd recommend farming west tek (if supermutants are above level 50) areas in the cranberry bog, and enemies in the mire. AWOL Armaments always spawns a 3 star legendary Mr. Gusty, and I‚Äôve found it to be the only consistent 3 star legendary spawn.
---
Because they are doing double damage versus the intended 20% additional damage.
---
Not a Nerf but a bug fix.
---
The patch 9 notes said displays were coming. Bobblehead displays were mentioned.
---
I usually use them during the queen fight just found out i have 12 lol
---
I would see it as a prototype only made in WV using local parts to upgrade stock T-51b suits.
---
One thing I was disappointed with the idea of the Atoms Cats wasn‚Äôt just the lack of paint jobs for suits other than T-60 but where are the post war janky welded on suit parts?
---
Kinda like how the raider PA looks but parts made for the other suits. Like I love the look of T-51b and 45d but they‚Äôd look pretty cool with make shift repairs to them. That and being able to ‚Äúclean‚Äù them to make them look like they just came off the assembly line.
---
It‚Äôs a bug fix. Not a nerf.
---
&gt; as she has good stuff.
---
I am pesimist here. 
---
I expect something like the legendary quest rewards: a catalogue of mediocre legendaries that 100% of the users can easily get.
---
Is it ironic I had to google what that means?
---
This gave me an idea. What if bethesda added another game mode: prankster. For those of us too nice for survival mode, but not quite nice enough for adventure mode. üòÇ
---
I've noticed a spike in griefing particularly in the last week for me.
---
Had painstakingly spent ages on making a main camp never to be moved again, a lot of frustrations in building it, but when it was done it was actually the best camp I've ever built (it's probably my proudest moment in the game).
---
Then two players come by, one was trying to trade with me (while I was just finishing off some changes I had made) repeatedly kept saying no, they went inside (I have it unlocked so anyone can use the facilities), then their mate shows up and starts destroying my camp. My hubby managed to kill the guy, I leave the server to ensure minimal damage, and the first guy killed my husband. Both blocked. Funny thing is the guy who tried to destroy my camp had tried to bait us about a month or two ago by showing up "begging" for help as they got griefed (but we knew better and declined). Then just two nights ago (hubby didn't block the guy at this point) the griefer spotted hubby on a server we were on and we jumped, got followed, do the free range event, they show up to it (there was a player doing the event with us that we know), after the event was finished I server hopped again, but hubby stayed as the griefer was trying to get this guy we know to start a fight and in area chat saying the other players there were calling everyone very unsavoury names (putting it nicely). He tried to attack the guy we know but pacifist mode was on and the griefer got the shits. Needless to say this griefer has been reported too.
---
There was another incident where a wanted player approached us and had a teammate in stealth, we were on a team with some guys we just met and literally killed us within seconds (both hubby and I play in pacifist so it looks like the guys we teamed up with for a bit weren't). 
---
We trust no one. And we don't like to PvP. We just like doing our own thing and being left alone.
---
So I kinda feel like an idiot, they were to the left of the deathclaw statue. Thank you to u/X--Henny--X and u/WarmheartedMagic for pointing me in the right direction.
---
I went through the whole Floor Decor menu and would always scroll to the right because I figured they always start from the left. Now I'm wondering what else I've missed in the build menu.
---
I took out the SBQ yesterday and didn‚Äôt get a single repair kit üòî
---
max HP isnt too much a factor with enough stimpaks or healing factor. most people would prefer luck
---
I don't think the game will ever be improved to the point where this is an option. I'm not trying to burst your bubble, just don't get your hopes up. It is a cool idea, but it's not going to be possible for 76.
---
Lvl67, havent been bothered to do it after all the backlash about the event / non-participant clingons etc...
---
Yup.
---
Yeah, it's a shame you can't. I wanted to do that after changing my looks recently and was bummed that I couldn't. I wish players could actually see the name too :T
---
This is so cool, I love it.
---
Ah yes, like the tribal armor from fo3 or the ncr armor from new Vega
---
I think the game was headed to this state from the start. The really good gear is...well really good so it takes a lot to trade it away from someone. Especially if they are on the fence about parting with it anyway. People, myself included, tend to overvalue things they find. I'll use myself as an example, I found an AAE vats fill black powder rifle. I think it doesnt hold a cap value because the 3 perks work great for my build despite it being black powder. To someone else its work about 6k give or take because its black powder. Once you start realizing you can easily make over 1400 caps a day caps become less value. That isn't the dupers doing that is the game design itself. Why should I take 3 days worth of selling junk to vendors and playing for a gun that I have only had drop once in 700 hours?
---
its primary ballistic weapon with a small amount radiation damage
---
&gt; In the end bloodied explosive is the best of all.
---
Yes and no, it's not hands down the best in every situation. It's capable of outputting the most consistent high dps. That being said, there are several other legendaries that can match it and one that exceeds it. Instigating, for solo play on non raid boss mobs, is the best damage you're going to get. It's the key to 1 shotting everything with average gear. My rifle toon can 1 shot lvl 80 scorchbeasts with my instigating dragon if I have a crit built up and manage to sneak near enough to the scorchbeast to get vats going. Furious on full auto weapons is just as strong, it only takes 30 shots to be the same exact damage as bloodied. That happens **really** fast on certain guns like miniguns and the .50 cal, we're talking like 1.5 seconds, or for slower full auto guns, up to 5 ish seconds(excluding the gatling gun, it's hardly a full auto weapon, I have semi auto weapons that fire faster lol). For fights like SBQ, executioners is a very strong affix. For instance I have an executioners plasma gatling and none of my other heavy weapons can really live up to it in the last 1/3 of the SBQ fight.
---
Onto tse... Once you factor everything in, TSE does more damage, end of story. Idk why you keep fighting that, its a fact. You can do your own bad math over and over, but at the end of the day it's still bad math. A handmade TSE on a toon built like my rifle toon with adrenal reaction at 50% hp deals 193 damage per shot while hunters/explosive deals 180 damage per shot. That's on the scorchbeast queen, that's pre armor, and that's demolition perk included. If you remove the explosive perk the gap closes quite a bit and they're almost even. As you said its a few damage either way, and since the explosive perk takes 5 points for such a minimal gain I don't see any reason to take it over other things.
---
That being said, basically every legendary that is a damage increase and has explosive is comparable to TSE stuff in the right situation, just some of those situations suck or don't typically occur.
---
Dogmeat!
---
20% xp boost
---
Even the torso peices, its the heavy armor varients that can't go down to 0!
---
Ha...ok this is kinda funny....your narrative made it even better!!! I used to leave pies in houses where I used their stuff but worried if they didn't find it soon enough, they'd find a bag of spoiled fruit and would be offended. Ha
---
I'm looking forward to giving away stuff for cheap. I don't like dropping legendaries, even if they are low level and don't fit with my build. I would MUCH rather sell a lvl 0-40 weapon or piece of armor for one cap to someone who can use it.
---
Nice. I guess I've only been finding heavy variants, or only noticing.
---
yup. 1 queen kill gives you 2-3
---
Yeah, they definitely don't make it easy to figure out. My friend had to show me.  In edit mode, highlight the door and an option for Lock should appear
---
This is the funniest thing I've seen in a while
---
Technically this isn‚Äôt a nerf but a correction of the previous nerf. I don‚Äôt think it needs it. I thought the previous nerf was too much to begin with.  Having players of similar levels wouldn‚Äôt solve it. I‚Äôve met level 150 plus played who don‚Äôt even know what the hell they are doing. Haven‚Äôt completed the main story. Don‚Äôt even know the enclave exist. Mutations what are those? How do I get them. How are people so high level and still don‚Äôt understand the basic game functions? All they do is run around and kill a bunch of basic things or just sit on a workshops extractor for ten hrs thinking thats how to get resources. These are the same people who don‚Äôt have any legendary gear and complain that they are too weak and why all new content is tailored to them.
---
Bethesda said it,   ‚ÄúThe first was causing them to deal double damage, rather than the 20% increase the explosive effect is intended to provide‚Äù
---
What's also ironic here is that you mention that you have 2 accounts.........
---
But it's Bethesda's fault that the economy is screwed up?.....LOL......okay
---
What Bethesda should have done was set the cap limit at 25k per account and not allow some players to accumulate $125k.
---
You exploited the system and now are crying for Bethesda to allow you to get even wealthier while new players with 1 character try to catch up......... sounds like Venezuela fits your needs.
---
Some rough sounding encounters, blimey. 
---
I can certainly appreciate that. Alas, only one PS4 in our house currently. If I could drag my other half on, I sure as hell would.
---
Guess people have gotten bored of Survival maybe? I don't know. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I really hope so. I have these legendaries I get that I‚Äôll never use, but wouldn‚Äôt mind selling them to someone who‚Äôd appreciate them. Some decent ones I can‚Äôt even sell for 300 caps, that‚Äôs how bad the trading market is on Reddit.
---
That‚Äôs definitely true, I don‚Äôt want everything I have locked from scrapping to appear on the wheel or be limited to 12 items to lock like you are now.
---
Lol not at all. There‚Äôs a sub dedicated to TILs.
---
Lol, responds to say they can't respond.
---
I got some spare steel on Xbox.
---
I hate to break it to you, no you can't. Show me the non-legendary weapon/perk loadout that 1 shots a lvl 80 scorchbeast because my vats/crit instigating dragon can barely pull it off. Besides your second point is really only proving my point. It's not trash just because it's not 3 star.
---
As a melee player, can we not drag meat hooks into this please??
---
It actually says so in the Atomic Shop description, and I have a friend that got the Plague Rider used it on his Excavator.
---
(Just keep in mind it changes the appearance to the one in the shop regardless of the PA type, so even an Excavator instead looks like the X-01 frame when using Plague Rider etc).
---
I can't assume what hard work in a video game means to you. There are actual games that require both time investment and practice to achieve an actually respectable goal. Time spent doesn't equate to hard work when the action spent in that time can be done half-asleep.
---
By we you mean me.
---
The only thing I can think of is that both post has the word "trading" but does that actually trigger the auto-modderator? Seems a bit extreme.
---
PS4, cheers for the offer though.
---
People have advised moving the camp a few inches, so I'll give that a try.
---
I was writing out a long response, but you're being obtuse.  It's not gambling money, so it's legal.  If it stops being legal, that's different, until then it's fine.  If you don't like things the way they are, you are more than welcome to try to convince your congressman that Bethesda is taking advantage of poor gamers by letting them gamble their imaginary currency for imaginary goods.  Have fun with that.
---
Higher luck increases the durability of armor and weapons that you find. It also recharges critical hits faster in vats.  I‚Äôll take that over 10 extra hp any day.
---
Ah, fair enough then.
---
Had someone overlap onto where my camp was set.
---
When I got there they had a locked door... BUT they had left a chair just inside the window... sit in chair glitch into house and wait. Once they came back I waved hello and told them what happened. Also felt I should inform them if they want to keep their stuff locked don't put chairs where they can be sat in from outside. 
---
Glad they didn't shoot me on sight. When I do this in real life people always seem to scream and try to shoot at me.
---
Junk should be weightless in the stash... Taking them out of the game world should be less of a strain on the server as it should only need to keep track of a numerical value, unless it's being used for the upcoming decoration mechanic, it doesn't need to be rendered at all!
---
You can‚Äôt assume what hard work in a video game means to me, so you assume that (while talking about a video game) I mean hard work *outside* of a video game?
---
Lol this game is so much more than RNG, there are better systems to obtain end-game loot.
---
If you haven‚Äôt discovered those systems but are questioning my knowledge of this game I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.
---
I well aware of what a higher luck provides. But endurance is a stat the representative of the body which is why I mentioned it.
---
Dude, your logic skills are fucking exceptional. 
---
Everything you just said is a baseless assumption.
---
Bethesda failed last night.  SBQ event kicked off and no SBQ showed up for the party.. Lot of disgruntled players at that one.  But the game in general has been getting better and I'm much more confident this game is going to be pretty good in a couple of years.
---
Serums got removed from the drop tables in favor or repair kits.
---
Probability distributions tell us that there were never supposed to be this many good weapons up for sale.
---
Yes if not for duping limited supply would have drove prices to 25k (Bethesda never should have allowed players to accumulate more with mules) but then again people wouldn't have sold most of these awesome weapons if they couldn't easily make attain another awesome weapon or even worse just dupe themselves a copy of their awesome gun before selling it.
---
This is why bases should be instanced.
---
One of my characters lives south of the nuka cola plant in the house with the radroach with a bowler hat, walking cane, and wedding ring. It's a mess inside and I can't do anything to clean it, but I thought it was great when I found I could use it.
---
Just give me a 100 pound account stash so I can trade items between toons!
---
You exploited the game mechanics and you want Bethesda to accommodate you.
---
Now see, when you resort to name calling it means you just lost, bigot...Literally Hitler.
---
Collected both sets and gave up when I found out the mods dont attach... I'm a horder so pockets / deep pockets is what I wanted, Marine Armour seems to be the best until mod glitch is fixed :waiting:
---
My best SBQ drop is a 1* Junkies Pool Cue, apart from the month after the Two shot nerf, explosive nerf and global weapons nerf I killed the Queen every day, sometimes multiple times a day!
---
I once got a 3* Gamma gun. Can‚Äôt remember the rolls, but they were good. The only thing that might stand a chance in PVP against sentinel/assassin types. Couldn‚Äôt sell it. Ended up selling it to a robot vendor.
---
When the legendary vendor comes, I wonder if that‚Äôll free up the market again. Everyone will want to buy 3* to get something from the vendor and maybe things will actually be sold again from those who suddenly need caps to buy 3*
---
Scrip, I love it. Cant wait to scrap the 4000 lbs of junk legendary items. Literally every single drop I've gotten since beta.
---
4000 lbs is 1816.0 kg
---
1400 Atoms to buy the machine and 10% of the gross?
---
We are the testers. You just filed your bug-report. Too bad our pay fuggin sucks.
---
Second d that. I eat io meat all day long.
---
Spite, for some reason imo
---
A syringer is more useful, at least it can be scrapped for a mod plan!
---
When the game first came out this was a big reason i took a nearly half year break. i got so damn sick of sitting in my camp for 40 minutes after only 20 minutes of actually playing. It's partially my own fault because i'm a horrible hoarder who wants to hold onto all the resources i can, and the high mat prices to craft/repair don't help that at all. There have been countless times where I have been staring at my junk after 20 minutes of micromanaging asking myself "Where in the name of Liberty Prime is all this weight coming from?" only to find out after 20 more minutes of searching it was the mountain of gunpowder i had. The increased stash and leveling into weight reducing perks helped this a lot but i'm starting to experience it again as i find plans for higher level items that again demand that i hoard all the junk i can. A system like this would be a godsend when it comes to just finding out where the hell your weight is coming from.
---
There is a dedicated trading sub. 2 actually. We don‚Äôt need trading posts in this sub
---
Woah! So no more serum recipes? Or do they drop somewhere else?
---
With the amount of dog food I eat in this game,  I wouldn't be surprised if I was turning into one.
---
You mad or something?.....why so much butt hurt?......
---
I said it's ironic that they chose to use the symbol of a slot machine in their game that uses skinner box slot machine mechanics to keep players engaged and spending money. I don't understand why that upsets you so much.
---
Holy fuck the internals are incredibly stupid. What a dumb, dumb design.
---
Oof
---
Some weapons can be literally 0 weight too.
---
and at least 187 more people
---
Check the score again.  People have little patience for cheaters.
---
If you're honestly trying to champion the downtrodden, gather them up, present the evidence of their innocence to Bethesda, and take it from there.  You're not going to convince people here that you're on the right side, and no one here can help anyway.  You're wasting everyone's time.
---
Runescape has infinite currency and an economy
---
I know that, but I wasn't asking for a trade. I was just trying to discuss in game stuff.
---
Don't speak for me.
---
Yeah, that happens to me, too... next time, being more ammo.
---
Only can get them from the enclave for 18k caps. I imagine this was done to give players something to sink their caps into.
---
Then message a moderator to get it reposted like it says. Automod isn‚Äôt perfect and it was already said it may flag incorrect posts by mistake.
---
Lame.
---
Sorry, I meant where was it stated that the vendor inventory fix was coming with patch 9?
---
I agree. I think the game was prematurely released a year to soon but with xp balancing and putting legendary mode in, it should hopefully keep people occupied until they come out with a more focused DLC.
---
The queen and sheepsquach still have their bugs and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs server related. Such as the sheepsquach dying and always stuck in her invisible mode so you have to find her with the camera. The queen has had intermittent issues since the start. Some could be server related but I‚Äôm leaning more toward that when you have those rare queens that spawn absurd amounts of adds, either the PS4 or server itself can‚Äôt keep up with the processing needed. It could be a combination. Kind of like them saying legendaries will always drop legendary loot. Then you end up with a drill lol.
---
I was literally finding it every 2-3 server hops. Maybe I just had an insanely lucky run, idk
---
From what I've heard they altered the mode where killing other players drops less caps and aid items. So really what's the point in playing survival when you can go onto adventure mode and try to kill another player for the level amount of caps? The Devs should've just altered the aid drop imo. I tried survival once and that was enough for me lol. My main isn't built for PvP hence why I get my arse handed to me lol.
---
We bought a new tv and Xbox just so we could play the game together. So much more fun!
---
Honestly, I don't care for the exact method with which the legendaries are generated. All I really want is legendary urban scout armor. If I can get that, I'm happy. Don't really care what effects, obviously I have preferred ones but I'm content with anything.
---
Thats too bad ...but good to know . Thanks:)
---
I have seen an increase as well but next week shouldn‚Äôt matter so don‚Äôt build till update patch.
---
It‚Äôs happened to so many people, you‚Äôre definitely not the only one.
---
k bro
---
Players should only be able to have as many mutations as they have endurance points.
---
I am sure this would give a lot of breathing room, but at the same time its fun to leave a "I.O.U. All the beer" note in the junk bag of the guy that just tried to raid your workshop.
---
I've noticed when selling to vendors or scrapping out of my "main menu"  that yellow highlight will jump up or down at any time and this has nearly caused me to scrap something very important. I think that's what's happening as far as many disappearing weapons and items is concerned. I do believe there is a glitch that is causing items to go missing but perhaps this is also a part of that problem.
---
I have some stuff, and I'll be on in a few hours,  let's see if we can trade?  You're welcome ro check mt post in marketplace if you like.
---
The simple solution, IMO, would be to identify high-quantity items (more than say, 20 of any one item, or more than one of any identical legendary) and reduce the quanity to maybe 5 (except identical legendaries, reduce to 1).  In the case of ammo, anything higher than 5000 on a suspended account can be dropped to 5000.  For junk, reduce all quantities to 500 or less for loose items, or 50 for bulk.  Again, this would only apply to suspended accounts.  
---
This isn't meant to be punitive.  It's meant to restore order and server stability.  If accounts with ridonkulous duped loot piles are reactivated, it the sudden influx of crazy quantities and such could cause problems like we had before things were optimized and stash limits were increased.
---
 I'm not looking to be applauded, or pat myself on the back, I know what I was doing was against ToS. The thing is everyone I interacted with walked away happier. We were in a utopian situation where we had infinite resources and could create even the rarest of resources from thin air, and with no definite way to acquire these 1-in-a-billion or whatever number - rolls on guns, outside of unimaginable luck, we could make them for everyone. As well as duplicating nearly all the plans in the game and saving people hundreds of hours of searching, and I mean why not, we had no reason to be stingy, it was win-win for everybody involved. I understand people were selling things for real world money , which I don't condone, and I understand the plight of those who could potentially "miss out" by not knowing the right people, and hopefully they got to share in on the benefits at some time too. I'm sorry if the situation left someone scorned, but the goal was for that to not be possible through providing people whatever they wanted, and in my experience, we did a pretty damn good job. I guess what I'm trying to say is I wish people would look a little more into motivations instead of just "duper bad" and try to see some nuance with it, because I don't regret it and would do the same thing in the situation we were in.
---
1600 is not happening, keep dreaming. I predict we will get another 200 additional like last time. For a total of 1k, I wouldn't complain. Anything would be nice. 
---
I remember when they raised it to 600, then 800. It was awesome! For the first week, then we were  back in the same situation lol. (Stash maxed)
---
Maybe they're hoping that we'll go to repair our stuff and realise we need to farm for ballistic fiber so we'll use the thing that they charge money for to skip the tedium.
---
I've got an explosive shotty, it's even anti-armor.  I put a lot of spare cards into shotgun stuff to try it.  Aside from frequently killing myself, I found that it wasn't nearly as effective as I'd been lead to believe.  I don't one-shot anything higher level, and end up jumping around like a frog trying to kill even a couple glowing ghouls without exploding myself in the process.
---
I still use it on occasion (and still will) if I need to do sustained damage (until I find a decent 50 cal or something), but for day to day killing I'm sticking with my sneaky sniping.
---
It's not super awful, even with the way it's set up now the Combat Shotgun deals about twice as much as an Assault Rifle, but on one hand one's an automatic 30 round rifle, and the other's an 8 round semi-automatic, and that's the part that gets my gears going.
---
Where have I asked Bethesda to accommodate me in any way? In what way have I exploited game mechanics?
---
Too be "fair" this is a RNG drop so it is what it is... also what is you perk point in LUCK at ?
---
I would if I actually got loot from the queen and not the never ending loading screen when I tried to loot her. 
---
Happened twice this week, and once with the Impster Sheepsquatch; still a bit bitter.
---
I know that feel. My build currently has such highlights as 'Team medic, inspiration, chemist, pharmacist' I'm geared for co-op with my one IRL mate who has the game. üòÖ Certainly not pvp.
---
Yeah, second console and finally getting married is top of the list for us when finances stabilise.
---
The posters totally made it!
---
With the event you get 2/3 advanced kit by default, so it's weird. I have actually 50+ of them!
---
All I know about player vending is that Ballistic Fiber is going to be a pain in the ass to farm.
---
what happens if your player is at max caps with an active vending machine and someone tries to buy something? will the items be greyed out? will the buyer still be able to buy items but seller wont receive any caps?
---
Didn't realise that was due soon. Works for me.
---
Cyro ammo yes. My best gun finally more ammo
---
Everyone I try to use my Gatling laser it always bugs out and the queen stops taking damage.
---
I killed the Sheepquatch and got a 3 star walking cane...lol gonna go for the old grampa build! lol
---
They said today and ppl found in the files earlier that vending machines will make your Camp visible when you power them, so power to a switch, then to the vending machine
---
Someone with some comman sense
---
Yes, given the game is skewed in favour of melee builds with 15 Strength,  everyone else is at a carry weight disadvantage.
---
Either up the stash or change the game mechanics to not favour melee - at least as far as carry weight goes.
---
Hopefully the new backpacks will also help
---
I have never really gotten anything good from the queen. Nothing that i've ever used. It's just a good spot to waste a lot of bullets and time. It's not even hard. Just depletes your ammo and degrades your weapon. But hey, it doesn't crash as often. She still bugs oout of bounds on the map from time to time. Again, waisted bullets for no reason.
---
I actually felt bad for what happened to this deathclaw.  I wanted to leave him alive, but there was a scorchbeast circling outside.  I crippled his legs and was going to run away so others could photograph him, but the scorched started flocking in to attack both me and him.  I kept killing them, but eventually they overwhelmed him.  It's like they knew he was an easy target since he only fought back from the front.  After I saw that he died, I took revenge on the scorchbeast in his name.
---
Thank you for teaching me something. I appreciate you sharing this with me.
---
I swear on the great Todd above if we get taxed I‚Äôm ripping out every single eye out on a snallyghaster.
---
Wow I love this!!! Your incredible.
---
Oh can't remember
---
That part is actually lower than I expected.
---
Gw2 is set at 15%   
---
VAT (tax) in Ireland is 23%
---
I was actually expecting it to be 15-20%
---
Hmmm I didn‚Äôt see that post today! That‚Äôs lame as hell.
---
Right now I'm running a stealth commando build and my automatics chew thru ammo like crazy. But the build is a fun one. Just really wanting to get into some powerarmor.
---
It says you are offline.
---
Not allowing us to move to mules? So just have one character and that's it? Why not? Its fallout and I for one have always collected in fallout games, that's like telling a child to not want to open their Christmas gifts.
---
Since this is what showed me how to fix that shit and I was still getting invisible crap on atomic store and had to bumble around figuring it out...
---
People of the future, go to Fallout76.ini look for the line

Yay! Congratulations for when the wedding day comes!

We went budget wedding and married in Vegas üòÇ
---
The legendary system (as currently predicted) will not cost any money, no one will be spending money on it.
---
If you CAN buy the legendary currency, it will won't be 'gambling' legally.  But I will be *fiercely* against it at that point (pay to win).
---
What upsets me is people trying to make arguments using false flags.  Your complaints about the system, the game, and even the company is fine in my eyes - you can be against re-rolling stats, microtransactions in general...hell, you can be against killing imaginary animals, and I'm fine with that.  But when you are (willfully or ignorantly) misleading about what it is, yes I will point out where and why you're wrong.
---
Sorry if I grew up before fake news became the order of the day, I just don't sit well with it.
---
If its complete crap, combined with the bugs, camp issues, non-incentive pvp and the so called "high level team themed" dungeons....well...that might be the final nail in the coffin for me. The game in its current state is not bad but that in itself has run its course of playability a long time ago. I know there are many out there for just the lore and exploring and that is great. I have already been practically everywhere though, I even kept all the notes you can pick up. I like some of them, what can I say.
---
I don't hate the game, but its server hoping as being its main highlight does not keep me interested for long.
---
This is the same general letter that went out to people for the last few months that was shared a few times. 
---
So far from my understanding, there hasn‚Äôt been any changes nor any ‚Äúfuture‚Äù plans as the email states. 
---
Bethesda also hasn‚Äôt addressed this officially at all so I wouldn‚Äôt expect to see those characters (I say characters since they can create new accounts) for awhile. 
---
Even chatter has stopped altogether about them, maybe they hope they‚Äôll just go away?
---
I was given two free repair kits after killing the scorch beast queen but I still just repair the old fashioned way
---
Dude. Are you narrow minded or what? It doesn‚Äôt matter if you DUPED or picked up duped goods or whatever you‚Äôre in the same boat it‚Äôs not morally right... what about all those guys who killed dupers and ditched it in the lake for the lol‚Äôs... should they be banned and have characters deleted too? hope you never get an injustice in life then maybe you‚Äôll understand it sucks to be treated like scum with no tangible proof.
---
Have max cap of 25k caps across all of your accounts.
---
You people are crying about inflation and ignore that Bethesda needs to cater to the casual player who isn't maxing caps on 5 mule accounts.
---
Most people aren't gaming junkies.
---
One of my friends that got hit abt the same time I did just got unbanned but they knocked all his stacks of weapons down to one instead of like 300. But I haven‚Äôt heard anything from them in nearly a month and they pretty much said for me to stop sending tickets bc it didn‚Äôt solve the issue any faster.
---
I feel like the game makes a joke of itself with weapons like this.
---
It's stupid.
---
When you fix something it shows no info. Tab back one screen and info shows. Before you had to exit the bench completely.
---
Honestly, I'd be happy with a reasonable stash limit for the vending machines, separate from the main stash.
---
Oof... Is pressing X to collect all and picking up a brown bag a rule break of the ToS? Nah cool didn‚Äôt think so lol. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a suspension.
---
I'd say it's just a poorly-configured bot.  If it triggers on the word "trading" alone, that's just lazy programming.
---
I get it but why was this double damage never mentioned before? My AAE pump does 280 with adrenal at low health, I dont see why it needs to be even worse. Is it possible some do not have the bug? Its just so out of the blue and disappointing.
---
I always come back to check this sub to see if this has ever improved. It's a joke that there is stash limit this low. It's me and my friends #1 reason for stopping. A game built on scavenging, even before FO76, and all the sudden you are forced to spend more time managing a math weight equation than actually playing? Absolutely ruined the game for me. 
---
I'm okay with a limit, but that limit has to be very high...like 5,000. The fact that Bethesda tries to reference this as "server load" issues shows that the game is either poorly coded, or they didn't dedicate any resources to servers.
---
I have multiple inactive accounts on WoW...some dating back to 2006. If I login to them now, I still have a full bank, guild bank, big slot bags, and massive item stacks, on probably 20+ characters. Accounts I haven't paid for in a decade, still have a every single one of my stored items.
---
All "storage" is just a text file. It's ridiculous to me that Bethesda has an inventory problem in 2019.
---
Fixed!
---
Yeah I had to check for myself last night, I assumed they were only for the type of armor the most resembled.
---
Have you noticed if your stash is full you can't put anything into the fermenter?
---
I don‚Äôt think many that were banned were actual dupers but they had items on their characters that were on the hit list. 
---
The day before the banhammer came down there was drop bags literally all over the place from dupers dumping stuff. 
---
If someone had a stack of 5+ duplicate TSE weapons... chances are high they were duped since the drop rate was so low when that all went down.
---
Thank god, had to search up circuits for gours today cause some assgole destroyed my turrets, just to have them destroyed again 10 mins later by another griefer
---
Ahhhh I didn‚Äôt realize they were a reward for the event instead of a loot item. I‚Äôll have to double check when I get on next!
---
2 hours of play time and 3 server crashes not a good day to waste your time doing workshops I just found out twice...
---
Bots aren't people, they can only work with what the mods give them.
---
I'd bet if you messaged a mod, they might approve the post once they've looked at it.  Or, use a different word.
---
I‚Äôm holding off until the patch just to make sure so for now I have a small functioning camp and use White Springs for everything else.
---
And server hop to get another hundred.
---
Your AAE pump SAYS it does 280.  That's the problem.  What it says is supposed to be the 120%.  What it's actually dishing out is 200%.  The gun's hitting harder than it was supposed to.
---
edit:  To clarify, it says it's doing 280 but it's actually doing 467.
---
I grew up with an Atari and I can assure you that predatory micro transactions were not part of video gaming.
---
I'm sorry if you are a fanboy but any gaming company hooking players in with RNG slot machines should be held under the same microscope as a casino. There should be a gaming commission overlooking them and, as I stated above before you went fanboy on me, Bethesda should be embarrassed when they try to explain to a committee that they aren't using gambling mechanics when they put a fucking slot machine in the game!!!!!!
---
I hope so, I liked the old way, it was easy!
---
Just a note, someone did make an old repair mod. I'll find it later and add it here if people want me to.
---
Not a bad plan actually.
---
Legendary scrip could be a potential game changer depending on the quality of the gear offered once the legendary trader comes in.
---
It‚Äôs been introduced, it‚Äôs just nothing drastic like a full respec. One point per level
---
You‚Äôre better off making a new character
---
Game‚Äôs much better now though (from someone who took three months off)
---
Thing is they have a list of 200 ‚Äúrare and most duped items‚Äù and have already removed every single item (leaving just 1 of each) so the question is why are these people still suspended when measures are already in place...
---
Thanks for the info! I missed the bit about power...
---
I respectfully disagree. It's not that bad to respec the same toon, and higher level means better rewards.
---
Is anyone else not a bit curious as to why the vendor and the ability of being able to trade in weapons arent being released at the same time? My guess is they want to use it as a way to determine what the value of the weapons that you can trade in for will be. 
---
Also how much of our budget will this machine take up? I noticed after the last patch that the base budget seemed to be reduced as when I logged in several items inside my base had just disappeared. Really hope this doesn't happen next time.
---
sort of, I get that its a bug but it feels like another nerf.  Why was this bug never mentioned before? Its just very surprising and disappointing. Obviously ill get over it but wanted to make a post and see how others feel.
---
It‚Äôs 10%
---
Unless you‚Äôre selling things for four digits, you‚Äôll hardly notice it
---
The convenience alone is well worth it to me
---
Happened to me before. Eventually went away by its self
---
Just gonna question it, but exactly what rewards are you getting pass lvl 50 that are considered ‚Äúbetter?‚Äù From what I know there isn‚Äôt anything better pass lvl 50 besides getting more perks and the occasional respec for different builds.
---
Ah ok. That would be cool
---
Mate you are reviewing a game almost half a year after it was released, do you think giving this review will change anyones opinion? I doubt so
---
man that sucks then because it doesn't feel like it hits that hard unless im super low health. All good I guess I just love shotguns and its the best one I got right now so im disappointed as hell.
---
Actually, I wish people would come to my camp! I don‚Äôt know why. I don‚Äôt like to be on teams but I like having some level of human interaction because I really miss it and wish we could have companions, or even pets. I don‚Äôt know why I lock it. I think it‚Äôs just the idea of having a ‚Äúprivate‚Äù space. It‚Äôs just something strangely comforting. Plus there‚Äôs nothing usable in that space that isn‚Äôt already available to use in the open areas of my camp. The one time that someone showed up while I was there, they wanted to see all of it so I let them in. They liked what I‚Äôd made and it made me really happy. I‚Äôm probably weird.
---
Armor and Weapons? Lol what kind of question is that. Higher levels=better loot.
---
Aw, man. I'd actually give them money in the Atomic Shop for just a full respec. Do you still have to level up to redistribute points?
---
Had someone create ultra light level 20 armor for me at the overseer's camp, gave me something to look forward to and set me up real well!
---
My main culprit was the junk that doesn't bulk. I routinely use the tinker bench to bulk up any resource I have over 200 so I can sell it. I never thought to check if there was any junk that didn't bulk. Then I accidently stored my junk before scrapping it so when I was going through to dig out the scrapable junk I ran across a few materials I had over 1000 of.
---
Nah, but im assuming it'll cost atoms. Unless Bes said it was a plan that could be bought with caps.
---
but yea thanks for clarifying as I was unaware of how the bug actually worked.
---
Yes please
---
He got it. Thanks so much.
---
Is this like Heaven's Gate?
---
It seems to me the only ones doing the "griefing" are the people on this sub. Shitty post after shitty post, including yours, I find it impossible that your story, as it was told, is true. Whatever they did to you, I'm sure you deserved it. And weren't you leaving? Why are you still here? Bye?
---
Normal price from Bethesda is apx 10% of what they will ask for the same item when you buy it from their vendor. It could be less than that on some items.
---
Noticing everything stops off at lvl 50 there is no ‚Äúhigher levels=better loot‚Äù pass that point.
---
Wish that was the case with all the ultracite dups I have...
---
The formula for calculating damage is ridiculous. It's pointless complexity has most likely been the underlying reason for some of the bugs Bethesda's games have suffered when attempting to extend the mechanics to cover new elements in game play.
---
Lol man you got real upset about this. Sorry this bothered you enough that it kept festering and you had to come back to make an additional comment lol. Take care!
---
Yep.
---
It's not a slot machine.
---
Depends what lvl are you
---
I am lvl 45
---
That may be the problem, but I'm not going to jump to a conclusion. I messaged a moderator, so we shall see.
---
I'm not crying about inflation... I was saying dupers didnt directly cause it and it could be fixed by introducing a guarantee drop rate for 3* items. 
---
Also I dont know who you think I am but I dont have 5 guys with max caps. 1 I have max because I sell to vendors every day and see nothing interesting to spend them on and the other 25k I have because I run a shop where I sell 1-3* gear for a fair price. Most of it isn't the stuff that takes the cake but some people dont need everything to explode, swing faster, or be cav or sent. Obviously I do pretty well not by duping but from giving back to those that need decent gear. Most of my 1* items go for under 500 unless it's super rare, 2* is around 1.2k and 3* just depends but generally 2-3k due to the rarity of 3* items. Plans for face value, mods for 100 caps, and chems for 5 over what my main gets from the vendor. 
---
The casual guy gets his benefit from coming across the decent people in the wasteland willing to give him items or sell them for cheap. My group gives each other stuff all the time and helps out guys wondering through who are friendly. The game doesnt need to be centered around them, if that was the case the top end would be more shallow than it already is and those casual people would see the friendly "gaming junkies" disappear.
---
I agree completely
---
Yeah, someone else suggested the same thing. I already messaged them, so hopefully they can help me out.
---
i like how they said it doesn't affect balance at all, ignoring fact repair   kits are junk you can buy + additional instarepair anywhere you want
---
Oh how I miss the place anywhere mod from FO4.
---
This is great. Thank you.
---
Really neat, thanks for the tip! Even a 4x plus level 50 in characters, I learn something new.
---
/satire
---
And yet here I sit trying to buy a 3* handmade but can't with my 50+k caps because everyone wants a different god roll item for it that I don't have and those that do have it want a different god roll item I don't have. High end trading is basically a game of those that already have god roll items trading with each other while those that don't cursing the current trade system. It wasn't always that way. You used to be able to buy into high end trading with caps. Don't tell me the current system works.

Are you on xbox?

If so thats a vampires cultisy dagger u found no use for and dropped
