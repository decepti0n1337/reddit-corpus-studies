They nerfed legendary effects like two shot and explosive for all weapons.
---
---
---
Do you need the Crystallizing Barrel to make it effective?
---
I'm level 120 w a ton of 3* drops. I get more legendary GG's than I get the vanilla version. I'm wandering around with a fun TS now.
---
All my regular armor gives me reduced weights on everything. I‚Äôll look into the mods though
---
I'll see you a plan for 1k
---
Because the time difference to see which pillars are active is broke. The quest tracker can take a long time to update to let you know somebody took a pillar so by the time people get to one they realize it's already taken, so a lot of people assume somebody else is working on it.
---

---
Plus there's a bug that causes the imposter sheepsquatch corpse to disappear if the bot explodes so people get greedy and try to focus on it to ensure they get loot. If they lose track of the body and it explodes they get nothing.
---
It sucks to jack materials, i don't even do that when people instigate but yeah they drop 5+ each so you get 10 - 15 each time.
---
I see you‚Äôre a man of culture.
---
I just finished Scorched Mirelurk Queen #15
---
if you're on PC there's a really useful inventory management mod "Better Inventory", so you don't have to rely on bethesda's crap
---
Thank you fine sir. You are a scholar and a gentleman.
---
That explains why people are going around 5 shotting me at level 60 with their explosive weapons üò≠  should nerf the damage dealt to players but still do a 50% damage increase to npc, does that sound like a good idea?
---
Running native at 4k red and sustaining 50 - 60 fps except at nuke events or anytime the servers are chugging (for whatever reason). Rubber banding had gotten worse so it makes sense stuttering would also be a problem.
---
This is low tier bait whining.
---
Dang. If on pc I could have gave you one.
---
Regardless of if it continues or not, the questline doesn't have a pointer past the bunker tapes other than a trigger making the hidden nuke tape visible and using it to trigger then end of an invisible quest.
---
Now there may be a bug that prevents it from ending, the reports might not be BS. 
---
I have not tried to confirm this myself (probably will in the future) The Grafton Cache tape is treated the same as the Silo tapes in the quest scripts and is told to trigger
---
`"The Overseer is scouting Appalachia looking for a way to secure the nuclear silos. I should look for any logs that she leaves behind."`
---
rather than
---
`"The Overseer is scouting Appalachia looking for a way to secure the nuclear silos. I should look for any logs that she leaves behind."`  
---
So there is a very good possibility that players who skipped Grafton may have skipped a bug.
---
Who knows, we'll find out in the future.
---
More then happy to help üëç Enjoy the workshops!
---
My full set up on the cryolator I used was crystallizing barrel, recoil stock, and glow sights.  The barrel was nice since I could avoid the melee range charge on her.  Not sure if it‚Äôs necessary though :)
---
if you havent found the plan yet i think i have a spare i could give you
---
Did they nerf the damage of melee weapons as well? Everything now seems much less powerful than it used to be!
---
You cant do anything with them
---
I think its from West tech disposing "nuclear waste" to dispose of evidence of failed expiriments
---
Lvl 1 eyebots spawn after the nuke zone is gone. I've seen that twice. Low level legendaries are useful if you sell items and run into that situation.
---
Also mine was a quad, so I was able to keep pressure on her until she froze and then just a couple bursts every few seconds to keep her frozen.
---
They spawn frequently in my secret spot, it‚Äôs a 1/10 chance for that either that or the 3* legendary Fog crawlers spawns and they are not fun to fight without power armor...
---
This isn't supposed to be like the previous games, you sarcastic twit. 76 has it's own charm and appeal, and has PLENTY or what made previous fallout games great. It also changes a lot. It's like a spin-off, accept it or go wait in a corner for fallout 5.
---
Thanks good to know!
---
Flamer Healing good? I have not tested yet.
---
20 hours, but sometimes the display will glitch and say 0, try to sell something and it'll update.
---
Half my maps just don't work. I open them up, head to location and find the mound. I walk up an literally get no dig prompt, so i'm probably gonna wait a few more weeks before i do them all, really don't wanna burn caps fast travelling
---
Thats epic
---
Did you check the whitesprings cook robot? He might sell it.
---
I got a 3* Furious Pool Cue.
---
Same situation in the old mill towns across the deep south.  They were great places to raise a family 30-40 years ago.  But once the mills closed, they turned into ghost towns where the remaining residents slave away for minimum wage at some low-skill job pining for someone to make America great again.
---
That is most certainly false. As I pop in for less than 5-15 minutes many days and the caps are fully restored as long as its been 20 hours since I cleaned them out.
---
You can't always trust the display cause it glitches.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve learned that people on survival can‚Äôt be friended. They‚Äôre all out to kill you. Kill them first, fuck up their house.
---
Do you have a key card to launch?
---
We could see her name on a body texture in game files, we also can see there isn't in any part of the map so in my opinion she will appear in a future content update.
---
~Level 160 heavy gun medic , GT: KnowledgeHound. I‚Äôve just come off for the evening so will be back on around 12 (midday) BST
---
I have a TSE dragon ?
---
This is why i love supressor and supressor weapons. It really lowers those gutsys kill potential.
---
I run bloodied so i can 1 hit them but when there's a group of them it's a scare lol
---
And you‚Äôre a douche
---
I finally got to kill a Flatwoods monster when I found him near a treasure mound in the Ash Heap. For that alone, it was worth keeping the maps. 
---
Plus, all the rare plans I got... to think I used to just give away my treasure maps
---
It‚Äôs horrible for melee weapons
---
What have you been feeding to those scorchbeasts?
---
Right ? No matter where I place mine it is under constant attack. Mole rats, super mutants, scorched, ghouls, and one time a scorch beast that was a long way from their home. Oh and robots. All low level but still annoying as my turrets dont seem to start firing until damage is done.
---
no, but I'm heading to the bunker to get one now
---
I'm looking to do it now but thanks
---
I‚Äôve never settled in whitesprings, once in Toxic Valley, once next to the Nuka Cola factory, once at Helvetia, and many other places in the forest
---
To be fair, the event is less than a week old and they haven't had a chance to do their normal patching yet.  Take a deep breath and maybe just hold off on clogging up inventory space with creepy costumes for a couple more days.
---
If they ignore the major bugs the last patch added next Tuesday, I'll take up pitchforks and tiki torches with you.  I don't see that happening.  With something as complex as a video game of 76's scope, it's not like they just fix a couple lines of code and drop the mic.  It takes time and teamwork to find the root of the problem.  It's a minor miracle a game of this scale works at all, having mostly been reworked from an aging system and convoluted code designed for solo play.  I mean, check out [this craziness](https://imgur.com/aYgWpC4) I got while being staggered trying to stim a friend.
---
You have to find a secluded spot and also elevated.
---
My main concern was other players .I sometimes hear mutants trying to get to me but they can't.
---
I have not had to move camp for over 2 months. Never been attacked.
---
Just keep shooting until it says "killed" and even then don't trust it as the person can go down an self-revive via perks-legendaries, i got killed by it earlier on, i also had a weird one where i downed the guy, but he's sliding around in camo effect throwing grenades an shooting whilst stuck in the downed pose waiting for a revive. The weirdest shit i've ever seen
---
Says the whiner eho couldn't hold a workshop. Sorry, baby. Better luck next time.
---
Also it will make any cats you find very angry at you
---
And pain clinics. I‚Äôm from Corbin.
---
Send me a private message?
---
Whenever I'm in a team I use my suppressors gatling gun to just tag multiple ones over and over. If it stacks correctly then it should be either 50%(additive) or 44%(multiplicative) offensive reduction. 
---
I'm not sure how it plays into DR and DR pen calculations, but my field experience leads me to believe it reduces damage before DR is taken into account as it feels like enemies much less than 1/2ish damage.
---
I farmed White springs for a little while with it and it tore through the high-level ghouls before I had a chance to take a hit
---
when you have two Industrial Purifiers in your CAMP, I would Love the ability to craft food with it. wood is hard enough for me to come by as is.
---
odd, i guess this patch broke nukes.. or you are stuck with the countdown timer issue
---
Awesome. That hate Cats and i love dogs but there are no dogs (friendly) in the game.
---
I'll keep your input in mind going forward. Have a good one.
---
If you're a level 3 lock pick and hacker, you can bypass the pipe repair.
---
I also received the t-51 jet pack plans
---
Sry I'm fairly new can you elaborate a bit? Thx for the help.
---
1. How do you tag the imposter?
---
2. What's the perk under which SPECIAL?
---
3. Why whitesprings?
---
And you‚Äôre the exact type of 12yr old I would expect to encounter in this situation... if not... sorry I can‚Äôt spend 12hrs a day in a game to level up and defend if I‚Äôm attacked... it‚Äôs just not worth it to try... I simply hop servers
---
Last time I launched a nuke all you needed was the code and the keycard. Do you actually need all the codes that drop from ghouls now?
---
Oops. Missed it. 
---
Lemme see if I have it.
---
You do realize that running test servers and monitoring those servers costs more money right? I mean I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt considering the crying ass rant you just did, but that shit costs more money.
---
Yes. Yes. I fast traveled to the event and it failed before wolf finished his speech. Last time I played I was the only player to activate a pylon. The entire time. It seems like this event is utter chaos. I use so many stim packs and get crap for it.
---
You can stack up to 2. The rewards are slightly better for 2 as opposed to 1 but any more than 2 (it doesn't matter if it's 3 or 4 or 17) and it won't make any difference.
---
If you're a lvl 3 lockpick &amp; hacker, you can bypass pipe repair. Saves tons of time and ammo.
---
What melee weapon, if you don't mind me asking?
---
this!!!!!    +100
---
I don't. Have probably given it away a number of times. Wull keep you in mind if I find it soon.

One (is The Loneliest Number) Lyrics
---
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
---
Two can be as bad as one
---
It's the loneliest number since the number one
---
No is the saddest experience you'll ever know
---
Yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know
---
'Cause one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
---
One is the loneliest number, worse than two
---
It's just no good anymore since you went away
---
Now I spend my time just making rhymes of yesterday
---
One is the loneliest number
---
One is the loneliest
---
Valley Galleria didn't unlock for me either and neither did Berkeley, even though I have  een all around the town and also up in Berkeley Springs West and held the workshop there twice!
---
Fair enough! I'm sure there were many quests/sidequests if not full questlines you hadn't finished but you have to track them down. Many aren't discovered as easily or organically as past games probably due to the lack of npcs. I'd be truly shocked though if you had done them all at 35.
---
What's the countdown timer issue?
---
Food for days (with good with salt)
---
I did not know that, luckily I have both maxed out
---
All u need against him is VATS
---
The whole UI of this game is jacked... R2/L2 changes tabs... in some menus, in others it's reversed. Triangle is for jumping, except when you're following a friend and then of course your'e trying to trade. And it's ALSO for attaching wires, but maybe you have to try a few times cause we're really not sure if you want to jump or attach that wire to the next connector. Up on the d pad is for getting to your favorites, except maybe you really meant to scroll up and down in that corpse/container that passed in front of your cursor for .0001s and now you can't access that badly needed stimpack. Oh and it's super useful to be transferring / consuming items and sometimes your cursor will go to the next item UP in the list and sometimes it will go to the next item DOWN in the list.
---
Oh come one it isn't that hard. It's just click, T, R, E now. Those keys are in a line next each other. You can just put one finger on each key and press them in sequence. Or use a macro like me. Macros can solve so many issues when it comes to menus and number of tedious button presses.
---
They definitely aren't going to change it back.
---
Vampire's Sledgehammer. Level 50, 3* with Swing Speed (that's the important part).
---
Can't get on rn. Will you be on at like 12 est
---
You had a workshop that they wanted, probably also needed. Chill. Acid is one of those things that, for some people, is hard to come by. When you have a workshop, you're saying you're down to PVP if someone comes along wanting your workshop. Either play in pacifist mode and never take workshops or get over it, dude
---
Thanks man i appreciate the insight! I feel like you are like the majority of players wanting to help! I will def. do that rather than give anyone the opportunity to engage in PvP
---
That hat is pretty pimp..u don't like it?
---
I demand hot pink
---
Purified water is my go to as far as health without using stimpacks. It's free after building the purifier at your camp and I also carry corn soup as it helps hunger and thirst.
---
The +3str/end one would be way too strong. Intelligence is the worst special stat and -1 is negligent with class freak. And -0.5 chr might not even register for many people.
---
The current ones that give special stats reduce str or end/str as losing those stats yields a more noticable drop. Intelligence is situational at best and you can always use meds when making new items. 
---
Hoarder would also be meh. 
---
The energy weapon one is interesting as many energy weapons are subpar. Only a few are good and its mainly limited to the heavy ones that just spit rounds at you. Maybe change it from -ER to take extra damage percentage wise like +40% damage from energy weapons. Dropping to 10%.
---
I have two now I want to give one of them to someone
---
I tried jumping on the shack too, but, like you, I died a few times up there and no one revived me. I'm beginning to think my successful goes at it were because I was running through my stimpaks and because others were on the pylons as well. 
---
I think it's a fun event. I just don't have the stimpak supply for it. Lol
---
Another player just helped me out on how to farm acid without the workshop... trust me, I don‚Äôt want PvP so I‚Äôll go this route from now on... I‚Äôd be fine with it if PvP weren‚Äôt so unbalanced
---
My sister did social work in parts of WVa where the mining companies had left and nothing came in to fill the void. She said it‚Äôs essentially the same as a third-world country.
---
Co-op healing perk for flamer?
---
Gotcha
---
But is yours legendary?
---
Gatlings are my fav weapon to use as a daily beater. Would get a legendary one regularly at white springs about a month ago, now super rare to get one. I just bought the plans to unlock the mods and there are really only 4-5  useful ones - customized grip, bayonet, speedy receiver, long barrel, drum magazine. still haven't figured out how the sight ring thing is supposed to work. I'm so used to eyeballing everything I can pop the heads off scorched, ghouls and mutants from quite a distance. My Gatling is a better med range sniper than my actual sniper rifle in everyday use.
---
That's what I am afraid of doing lol
---
a while ago a lot of older nuke cards would give your a super long count down timer until you could launch a nuke again. a friend of mine had it and he was stuck with about 170 hours before he could launch again, even if the silo was ready
---
At the moment I think it's clear that the matchmaking server isn't the same as the host that manages the instance . It doesn't take a lot of coding knowledge to tell that there's no way for that matchmaking server to 'look into' the host and check if that spot is free (which is why the game needs to load you into the world before running any further checks). It's a side-effect (one of many) of retrofitting the old single-player engine to allow multiplayer.
---
(I'm sure that someone will say, "but you can join your friends/avoid blocked people thou". That's a lot different... each client reports it's current instance back to the matchmaking server, and that's what the server is basing matchmaking on - it's not looking into each instance to see who is in each one.)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm not saying it's not possible\*... but it would be a massive overhaul to the architecture of the game. It's the sort of thing you'd expect to see as a part of a 5-year anniversary relaunch, not as a quickly fix in the monthly content drop.
---
(\* In theory you could have the camp report back to the matchmaking server with a host and if were a player, and update location each time it's placed... And when the game 'saves' your character record a camp lactation that could be cross referenced each time you go to log in. But that would more than double the load on the matchmaking server, add more time to the time required to 'save' a character, increase latency across the host, massively increase time to load in and lead to a whole raft of new connection issues. It'd be a bit of nightmare.)
---
I know the perfect cave.  Two entrances.  Good spawn nearby.  It's up on the north east east of the munitions factory.  If you Google fallout 76 caves you'll find out. I'm too lazy.
---
I carry the x01 with jetpack and the excavator armor in case I get bogged down with loot. Also have a t51 set with a jet pack. Just like the x01 better and on my case it has better stats than the other armors I have
---
Follow the road out of watogga twords bog town. Plenty of underground locations under the road
---
That would make no sense. Want me to waist my ammo and or durability on my weapons while people sit back and watch? People would just sit back and reap the benefits and if you play the game enough you know this man! You have to do 5-10% dmg to them to get loot. Terrible idea! Lol
---
I can help walk you through the process. I've got all the cores so it'll go fast.
---
As someone who really hates EA and who used to put bethesda games into a category of their own, it pains me to say, at least EA's games work...
---
Any idea where *** gatlings drop more often or by whom? I want a *** vampiric w/40% increased fire rate and 50% limb damage.
---
They only drop from enemies inside Nuke zones.
---
Technically I think we have one of those already, idk if it's on the base skin but the Prototype skin in the Atom shop has a Taggerdy's Thunder logo on the shoulder; which I'd argue is *technically* a BoS logo in the sense that Taggerdy's Thunder founded the Appalachian BoS/became a unit of said chapter.
---
I still agree though, a more traditional Brotherhood paint job would be nice for the Ultracite.
---
So far I've found at least one place in Toxic Valley that spawns at *least* the BoS Chest Plans (so it stands to reason it may spawn others as well). The Armor Bench in the Penitentiary that is due right down the main hallway right as you walk in the front entrance and past the stairs leading up to the warden. I've also read that random BoS plans can spawn in the wrecked train car East of Watoga in the Flooded Trainyard , but so far the best I've found there is the BoS Officer underarmor (all black, pretty cool looking if you're into that kinda thing). 
---
I have a suspicion that the plans have a chance to also spawn just Northwest of the Overgrown Sundew Grove in the Cranberry Bog. There's a small cropping of trees with some trenches in the middle of them and on the South side is two skeletons with an ammo box and duffel bag. Some armor plans that are very similar to the same spawns I saw in the train car seem to spawn next to the duffel bag with about the same frequency that they spawned in the train car. 
---
Hope this helps somebody!
---
Oh my god. How do you find that out? I nuked somewhere back in February and it's been an issue ever since.
---
I actually think the Hunting Rifle in this game sounds more badass when you mod it with a .50 Cal receiver. I mean, listen to [this thing going off](https://youtu.be/0kAPhCFQFrk).
---
I've launched a nuke solo a few times, I just want some help to get through it faster and to actually kill the SBQ. She's the bigger problem I need help with
---
Make it where if you die with no caps you start dropping equipment(weps/armor). That'll stop hiding caps on mules.
---
after thinking about it, i can see Neanderthal being a bit too strong, hoarder is supposed to be meh, its just carry weight bonus with a penalty of not carrying a lot of stuff
---
Hmmm‚Ä¶ Who woulda thought?
---
No but the codes expire weekly... people post the codes but it takes a few hours after the reset before they get figured out
---
he told me about it. he complained to bethesda and they reset his timer. since then he sold all his old cards. and got fresh ones
---
For some reason it goes straight to my inventory which somehow annoys me. I had 20 Purified water when I went out to explore West Virginia and I got 51 Purified Water after hours of playing
---
I got a group that lives to take her down
---
I just want cranberry nuka cola, a new favorite of Watago residents lol
---
I've picked up two AA and one TS. Both single stars. I've never picked up a normal one. Adding insult to injury, you can't scrape a legendary for mods.
---
Ooh very nice. It's just nice to know what else is out there. My main is kinda a jack of all trades, but I lean toward two handed melee with slugger perks since finding my lvl 50 instigating super sledge. It's getting kinda boring, though. I wanna smack things with different things, damnit! Lol
---
This happens to me *every* time I inspect a weapon, then I have to re-enter the bench if I want to see weapon stats. Needless to say I hate it.
---
What are the mods? I've caught 3 legendary drops and no vanillas that I can scrap. I'm really curious.
---
If I could make batches of cola in larger quantities than I can purchase in the WS then that would be fantastic. 
---
They should do a whole Cola Update similar to Brewing where we can craft cola and use the mixing stations like we could in Fallout 4
---
Ya that would be heavily exploited
---
Na we failed. And yea pretty much
---
I have 10 white wolf fedoras
---
This game has raids?
---
Front sight, comfort grip, speedy reciever, long barrel, bayonet.
---
This happened to me too. Boo.
---
if you guys are able to help me now/soon that would be fantastic
---
Speedy seems nice.
---
Joining you. Dr Fischer MD. I'll bring my group over
---
Thanks!
---
Had me in the first half. Not gonna lie.
---
Use Molotovs if this happens again. For some reason the fire can hit enemies stuck in walls, buildings, and underground.
---
If you wanna count the SBQ as a raid boss than kindaaaaa?
---
Alright thanks so much. What day is the reset?
---
I think Perly Peepers would do the work
---
I don't know how to contact them about it. I have the missile silo Holotape and it's not showing I'm locked out of anything.
---
The most pathetic argument. You have to play to be better, that's simple. You simply want an easy mode game. Not 12 hours a day, just when you can. If you can't hold a workshop, guess what? You dont deserve it. You aren't entitled to it. Go play and level until you can.
---
fantastic, I'm hoofing it over to Site Alpha to save caps. But I'll fast travel when I get closer
---
Found one here ([Pic1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/567143410398658581/unknown.png), [Pic2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/567143472231088158/unknown.png)), twice. Had to channel hop because first time 3 Yao Guai instantly devoured it before I got there.
---
Look up captainoob on yt. The sights are bugged. Thanks for the awesome feedback!
---
Strap on the Tesla torso mod and run through the enemies.  Easy peasy.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúone-shot nerf‚Äù it destroyed single slug or swing weapons. Melee and Powder weapons got hit pretty hard.
---
No shit, right? üëç
---
you fucking dump if you think that investing in your own product is bad idea.
---
I like it. Make it random from the weapons/armor equipped to avoid players carrying extra junk weapons in the hopes of losing one of those.
---
I would be very interested
---
Go to The Thorn. As soon as you spawn, run due North for 7 seconds sprinting. That is one of two spawn locations for a random event where a megasloth is fighting some yao-guai. You have to be quick to kill the sloth, and the random event is a bit rare. It requires a good bit of server hopping, but be persistent and you WILL eventually get it. This same spawn at The Thorn also has an identical encounter location due East, also 10 seconds at full sprint, which can have the same random event. Check them both. Eventually you will get the sloth. ;) I did.
---
I will.  Want to pick some up for alt characters.   Thanks.
---
Platform? If you're on xb1 lll hook you up for fun.
---
I'm a level 83ish and I was constantly having low levels make camp near mine. When ever I'd see em on I'd see what gun they were using then make one a little above their level but fully modded. I'd drop it with 250 bullets and just stand there until they picked it up. Always love seeing their excited movements as they realize just how much better that new gun is. There's has been times I'd drop power armor with a full core and full low level raiders for em. Never gets all seeing how excited they get. Almost like I'm reliving my own excitement.
---
Isn't the shopping cart turret have fixed rotation? You can shoot it's back whole day and it won't notice you
---
Is that why they charged us for the game? If they don't have the capital to create test servers then they should never sell the game. It's not the consumer's responsibility to pay for their servers that has to do with their model and their pricing model not us.
---
[removed]
---
Yeah, in the back.
---
Cool :)

Monday
---
His point is that grinding is not part of the traditional fallout experience and is not a fun aspect of a game in general, and he made the person choice based off grinding becoming necessary after a certain level.
---
Don't play?
---
I use T-60 for the Brotherhood paints
---
It‚Äôs absolutely not that I can‚Äôt hold a workshop. I have plenty of weapons and defenses to do so, but when someone is able to one shot no matter the armor available it‚Äôs completely unbalanced. I have the level and strength to defend, but that‚Äôs not my point. Don‚Äôt be a dick is all I‚Äôm asking... and clearly, you‚Äôre incapable of that.
---
Unless you need to do a sneak quest.
---
The biggest problem is that not all specials are created equal. 
---
There is a reason why marsupial gives carry weight not str. 
---
Overall str, end, agi, and luck are the only ones who give pretty tangible benefits. Intelligence and charisma have little to no combat effects. Intelligence has awful passive effects. Chr is only really useful until you reach the threshold of a card to share and for solo players has little benefit. Perception boosts accuracy but usually its not noticable since if you're building a rifleman build you'll probably be fine and weapon accuracy plays a big part in vats. 
---
So overall I don't see a way to implement any  strength/endurance mutations without having a major drawbacks.  The biggest thing is class freak, trading any special point at a 4 to 1 ratio for str or endurance, maybe even agility is probably gonna be worth it. 
---
Class freak and mutations are already strong enough as is. 
---
The energy one and some of your others that have more unique effects are great ideas though, kudos. Thats what we need more of, unique ones that wouldn't be good for most builds but add versatility and options.

I see.  Thanks.
---
I don't know about you, but a one-star instigating lever gun is more than decent enough for me.  I can count maybe a half-dozen enemies that can survive more than one headshot.  Scorchbeasts, Mirelurk Queens, Behemoths and similar very-large game.  Add in Better Criticals perk, and the list gets even smaller.
---
If you are getting one shot, it is on you.
---
I can‚Äôt help but laugh when people use liberty prime quotes and don‚Äôt notice what they love about LP is everything the writers were trying to criticize
---
mod fixes this
---
I'm down.
---
I‚Äôve explored every section of the map and I‚Äôm currently level 37. There‚Äôs still quests to do, but without npc‚Äôs to make you want to continue a not so entertaining quest, why would I do it? I‚Äôm not doing it for anyone but myself and I‚Äôm gonna get much out of it. 
---
Some of the quests I really enjoyed, but overall areas don‚Äôt have enough mystery or draw behind them to want to explore them to the same degree as previous fallout games.
---
Controversial opinion here but I don‚Äôt care you just press one extra button.
---
Hmm. I wonder what went wrong then
---
go to the bethesda help forum or the contact page. the holotape will not show your timer, only the silo's
---
Nah it should be random, not just a way to strip them of their good weapons. But add that layer of risk where they wouldn't even want to risk it, but could.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt know why people care so much
---
Mine are all PAC (Power Armor Chassis)  and whatever Armor is on it, since I can‚Äôt display them and repainting is cheap I don‚Äôt really see a need for more than three suits... hell I can barely justify two since I mostly just use T51
---
Tag means to hit it, doesn't matter if it's with a bullet or a fist. You want to tag it so that you get the loot when it's dead.
---
It's called 'sun kissed' and will remove rads from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. when exposed to the sun. Works great! Only use radaway at night or in nuke events. I usually sell my excess radaway at vendors since I hardly use them anymore.
---
I dont really understand why you drop aid at all.
---
Hahaha it‚Äôs off the cob
---
I've almost wondered if the servers that get empty never get totally closed off or shut down, and that could result in certain regions ending up attempting to connect to a bunch of partially-shutdown servers.
---
I would like y to repair a to confirm x to use repair kit... Having multiple kits might be the problem?
---
I‚Äôd pay for nv radio
---
And my face
---
I totally agree granted that they have the ability to do anything. Personally I don't like joining events that I can't actually help with. Makes my rewards feel undeserved.
---
TBH I think that as of now. It's not too bad, but could use improvement.
---
Let's take 50 Cal
---
With supper dupper and ammosmith maxed it's 180 per craft , yet he "mag" holds 250.
---
2mm
---
Same setup. Crafts 24 and the mag holds 5-7 Max.
---
Shotguns
---
Same setup craft 12. Mag holds 20 (auto).
---
If they would Ballance it for autos mags then single shots would have way more ammo than needed. Just as bad the other way imo.
---
I agree with ya on the cost to manufacture is still high but can't think right now how to Ballance it fairly across the board.
---
I currently am spec'd hvy/pa build or a stealth sniper  with out changing cards. But I'm do I wish for more 50 Cal ammo or 40mm when I craft. I gave up on shotguns a while ago
---
I am on Xbox. SaltyMeatSlacks. But I won't be on for a couple days. My wife has family in town this week. But yea. That'd be cool. I've been farming white springs and uranium fever for a while and that sledge is the best I've found for my build, if I can even call what I've done a proper build. Lol
---
thank you man
---
Good on you, that's the spirit! However, perhaps I could direct you to eyebot control? Perhaps you'd like to be conduit?
---
Really, I appreciate anyone who is at least TRYING! By going after the lower level bots it frees up those of us that can do serious damage, so get your tag in and start plinking! üëçüòÜ
---
I am ok with your suggestion. However any camp that has turrets within shooting distance of White Springs deserves to be eradicated.
---
Hey, I'm already lugging a 50 cal and a fatman. Might as well bring a Cryolator too. Cheers for the heads up.
---
I am absolutely torn. Then I should of wished for an explosive pump action shotgun or an automatic explosive did they also make it break easily? My dragon once got smashed after firing it 3 times....
---
I personally haven't experienced this problem I play for a good 3-4 hours on week days after school and find plenty of legendaries I believe RNGesus is not in your favor.
---
I'd be pissed.  I love fighting for a workshop, I've had more fun taking workshops and defending them from "raiders" than I have in the very limited questline
---
how does this look like for a revision?
---
 Neanderthal - +3 STR, +3 END, -4 INT, -3 Charisma, -3 agility (cannot be used with egg head)
---
You have to crank it faster!
---
Thanks! Time for some treasure hunting. :)
---
No, I was farming solo. I'll be trying this next time I play on a team
---
That feels...."cheaty".
---
Its techincally a glitch/bug? Its supposedly only has a Firerate of 20 - 30.
---
Refreshed at about 44 hours, so that's consistent at least. Interesting!
---
ehhh, how?
---
Sighting tips. Get a hit before zooming, or while aiming the healthbar will pop up if on target.
---
I have a few, but with all the mutations I want all I could really do with them is sell what I make for...more caps.
---
Dunno, just being helpful.
---
I'm thinking all outfits from 3 and new Vegas lol fuck the "lore" don't get me wrong I want the real fallout experience. They are all great games but It would brings loads of nostalgic awesomeness to the atom store!
---
Its not much of a speed increase, but it helps a lot.
---
Primarily I farm watoga and that for sure has been nerfed
---
I burned more caps than I needed to but I wanted to get done quicker so I fast travelled everywhere. Had I walked between some sites I think my cap spend would have been a lot less.
---
Did you name the weapon by chance?
---
Hmm idk know but I love it! It's more accurate than the mini gun doesn't spit out as fast but it's more steady. I have 3 different ones aa tse and ts which as the speedy receiver and makes a huge difference...
---
Seems to be 44 hour reset cycle with Cap Collector
---
My group is in and ready when we are. I can lead through this
---
Wow...I've done it several times now and we've taken it down every time. People understand the pylons now and once the group understands that it's fairly straightforward to take the imposter down. It's tough but not SBQ spongy tough, though it does deal more damage than I ever take with the queen!
---
I usually use a weak but high volume weapon to tag everything without one shotting everything. 10mm machine gun will severely reduce enemy health but allow others to kill off the enemies so everyone can share. Kinda a-holey to run in wipe everything out and leave lower level guys nothing.
---
44 seems to be accurate with Cap Collector
---
Gatling guns have a slow startup, but when they do start up they fucking wreck.
---
Thanks for the confirmation. It makes the perk card a little useless unless your not planning on getting on the game for awhile
---
Its called RNG friend. There is no "Legendary Nerf" as you say.
---
Unfortunately you think you've got it bad. I recieved a 1* star Ghoul Slayer right leg from the Queen last night.
---
Like I said, RNG is a hell of a think.
---
TLDR: Pray to RNGesus.
---
Agree.
---
Since this post was the first hit I got on Google, I'll make a list answer the questions I've seen and have had:
---
1) You can get plans to craft the lvl 50 version, you're not stuck with the lvl 30 you pick up
---
2) If you know combat rifle mods already, you can upgrade/mod this for your needs/build
---
3) Perks DO affect this rifle, at least with the lvl 50 crafted version I tested (sold the lvl 30 shortly after getting it)
---
4) It's probably not technically considered legendary because it's craftable, despite that you can't scrap it.
---
Hope this saves some scrolling.
---
Got to love when Sheepsquatch turns into a metal in a field of piles of metal...
---
I just trust my gut. Someone seems decent, they get a deal. Someone is an ass or is pushy, they get a price mark up if anything.
---
It used to be a problem before, then they fixed the bulk autoscrap in a patch, then next patch after that bulk items got autoscrapped again. So they either rolled back that part of the patch or it's a bug
---
Will be worth more after people use up their free summon.
---
Sounds like you pissed off some lvl 200s
---
I mean at least it wasn't an auto stem wood leg. So there's that ü§£
---
Yes I would love to have a this and also gun racks and power armor racks to show off your goods!
---
I've slightly seen this problem recently... I think they are nerfing due to the upcoming Legendary Vendor Patch. Although, I have gotten some decent legendary loot lately, uranium fever seems to be the most nerfed.
---
Yeah that's me, my mindset is this "caps are a currency, you get it to spend it, so why not spend it an speed things up" an then 5 minute later "i regret doing that, could've spent those on ___" 
---
Fuck my life?
---
Yeah, I am trying to figure out the price I should be offering for The Fixer plans. It's the one drop I want from that event,  and the one drop I can't seem to get.
---
I usually search market history.  I should really write this stuff down
---
I have like 120 maps saved up. Perhaps I should use them lol.
---
My legendary run consist of watoga, robco, general steak house, westec, white springs. I get any where from 25-50 legendary enemies ranging from 1-3*
---
I'm pretty sure it's because of heavy guns and design oversights.  You can craft 100+ .50 in one go, but .308 is less than a couple dozen at a time with a much higher resources expenditure per bullet.  An odd choice, given that the LMG eats up .308 at a ferocious rate.  It really makes no sense that you can't craft both at the same levels, aside from either making heavy guns impossible to feed or sniper rifle ammo ridiculously easy.  It probably would have been a better idea to err on the side of generosity for sniper rifles, considering that the .45 lever gun is king of the hill.  Easy ammo production might offset the recoil and slow firing rate of the hunting rifle and make it a compared debate to the lever gun.
---
Those two lines you've highlighted are identical...
---
Yup. Gotta buy the plan. Never found a good place to farm multiple handmades, levers, gatlings or mg42s.
---
Tuesday, brotha man.
---
Nah.. I actually got that from the Sheep. But it was leather. üòé
---
It's depressed because the state depends on things like Morgantown, in where the college is its life.  With the threat, and in many cases removal of the coal industry from the US, WV went from booming to bust... because that is where they made their money. 
---
My family was originally from Morgantown, my uncles and great uncles were coal miners. They worked their asses off to give their families a better life, my cousins down there are/were the chief of police and fire. 
---
If they didn't have the jobs they did, I know for a fact they would not be there any more.  
---
I have fond memories of Morgantown growing up, it was backwards in so many ways, but it was a place where you could walk down the Main Street and people would smile and greet you. Today, not so much... its run down, drugs and alcohol have taken over, and depression is not just a word to describe the area, but the people. 
---
You go outside of Morgantown, and it is almost as bad as DC... Washington, DC for those who don't know it, there is a place where you go, visitors visit the shining city, then you walk a few blocks past the tourist areas you start seeing boarded up houses, buildings, entire blocks just vacated... it's depressing.
---
I really wish people would realize that...
---
Morgantown was a great place...and still is to some extent, but boy... with how everything has changed in this country, places like WV has been hit hard... and it shows.
---
Ohhhh. That‚Äôs going to take awhile. Your haul should be epic!
---
I think people would load up a bunch of the lightest less valuable gear to avoid losing anything they care about. Either way it's a good idea and Bethesda should get on it asap.
---
Yeah dude, buy stuff. The plans are expensive.
---
Cool. I probably wont have the flux required by then, but we'll see. Hopefully a nuke or two will go off before now and then.
---
I‚Äôve lived in the Mire plenty of times, if you just take care to avoid the water without proper protection or utilize Natural Resistance you‚Äôll be fine. I think I get sick more often if diseased enemies more than I ever did from the water, and I lived right on top of it twice. 
---
.
---
I've got 1H and 2H melee weapons. I got a pickaxe  today from WS. My only 3*.
---
U can have up to 5 characters
---
but thats just a game mechanic don't complain just let him take it or server hop...
---
Well they blew up the dam with mininukes.
---
That 20-40 hit point lifestyle üò•üëå
---
Get both.  Ultracite is not hard to get.
---
I had about 200 pieces and sold half to a vendor for 600 caps. With the Ultracite pa you can install the rebar torso mod which works great.
---
I have one ultracite pa, 2x x01 and an excavator which I carry around with me when I'm overweight.
---
Though yeah - get a few perk cards regarding repair, weight etc.
---
This 100% similar to sunshine billings food plant? Where you choose between different cola's for a shorter/longer production time. I can see this being a popular workshop
---
I figure my time is worth more than 90 caps, so I don‚Äôt regret it. That‚Äôs the way to look at it, maybe.
---
Buying bonuses that expire is seen as a worse thing for cash shops, not better.
---
Like the other poster said, just move your C.A.M.P. device around inside the boundaries until you spawn somewhere better... it takes a couple fast travels to actually change though, and you have to leave the cell your camp is in, so just travel back to 76 then back you your camp. If you spawn in the same exact spot the game hasn‚Äôt noticed you moved the device yet and just worry about something else for a bit.
---
You are invited to Lake Yao Guai
---
Exactly what I did! By making this post, another user clued me in on how to farm acid without taking the workshop! Huge help and worth it. Not whining, just glad I got this insight!
---
Yup. They need more worshops that produce things. Ballistic fiber or screws anyone?? Lol
---
Bug. The game displays an incorrect fire rate.
---
Wish they'd fix that. Along with the front sight ring not being aligned with the center of the screen in first person.
---
I second this. 100% needed.
---
I think I sold those off immediately. What do they do exactly?
---
It totally sucks that this keeps happening to you. Sorry
---
That said, I‚Äôve been playing every day since beta and I‚Äôve never once had anything even remotely like this happen to me. I‚Äôve always built large, extravagant camps that you can see from very far away. I‚Äôve built near popular destinations like white springs, the overseers camp, and Watoga to name a few. No one ever tries to attack my camp. I‚Äôm almost a little offended at this point - why isn‚Äôt my camp grief worthy?!?
---
Seriously though, it seems as though you‚Äôve upset someone at some point. It‚Äôs the only thing I can think to explain why this always happens to you
---
I've had my camp, always in the forest, destroyed twice in one location and once in another by higher-level players.  Everything in my Camp is unlocked, I don't even have doors, and all the water purifiers and props are easy to get to. Doesn't seem to matter.
---
Could you send me a pic of your build??
---
My first camp I used for about 90% of my actual progression only finally moving to a more forever spot after 10+ hours of surveying the map and getting over the "but I do already like my spot". It was on a cliff overlooking a great place to get food and water easily, perfect for beginners. However, I avoided ever fast traveling there just because it would either put me way up on a rock that would be impossible to reach otherwise and need to spend 5 minutes carefully climbing down not to break my legs or inside the hillside on a rock forcing me to jump off into the void under the map till the game decided to teleport me at the bottom of the hill making it faster to just travel to the closest actual landmark in the first place. A mat would have solved literally all of this.
---
Even in my new camp it always just puts me 300 feet behind my main building. No where is perfect I guess.
---
It takes that gun forever to empty a magazine. If you timed that wrong, it's your fault, unless you're in a fight w the SBQ.
---
By tag, they mean shoot or hit
---
That is, unless someone else does it before you. Then it could be 1 am est. Who knows, could be midnight, could be Wednesday.
---
you hit like a radroach
---
I‚Äôm moving into heavy weapons perception and agility
---
So that I can switch from heavy weapons to rifle stealth. Lolz
---
If you're on PC, press enter, twice, while hovering over the event icon. For some reason it doesn't work with mouse clicks...
---
It's clearly added so when repair kits comes out, you go into the repair menu and select one button for "workbench" repair and another for "repair kit" repair.
---
I don't see the big deal either
---
Is it weird that I hit all three pylons AND shoot the crap out of the fake sheepsquatch?
---
That's pretty much as I do it too. But, there's a feeling that I'm not as capable a salesman as I'd like to think I am. Was tooling about looking for the random vendor bot, was over by lady Janet's ice cream, here he is. I contact someone on my friends list and he and some if his mates show up talking about the Hunters long coat, and how it's selling for mega caps, where I sold one a day previously for just a little more than what I paid for it.
---
It's my go to weapon for my heavy weapons build.   I have  a two shot and an anti-armor buy the anti-armor is my favorite.  Gatling gun combined with stabilized perk is great for daily use in most PVE situations.  It works with the heavy weapons perk and consumes ammo way more slowly than most heavy weapons.  The speedy receiver mod makes the fires rate much better. But of course you have to scrap Gatling guns which are don't drop that often.  The good news is that you don't need them to drop often to get mods because there's only a few mods total.
---
I think you're thinking of the minigun
---
What are you taking in trades ?
---
Idk how one would go about selling an online game used. I'm fairly certain that the code would be tied to the account they started and couldn't be transfered. But I don't actually know how that works.
---
Why do people come here screaming in caps and swearing like a 12 year old on Xbox Live like that's going to solve anything?
---
If you have a technical problem, the people on this sub (and even Bethesda themselves) are happy to help. But all you're going to get is snark and downvotes if you just throw a tantrum like a child. Grow up.
---
No it‚Äôs good that you do
---
Thats what we want though. We want them to think they can fool the system. And they will...sometimes, but it'll get them to risk it. If it was just equipped items they never would risk it so they wouldn't ever lose items. But if they think they can stock up and cheat the system then they risk and it might just be an 8 or 10% chance of losing something good like a TSE, but that way they get punished for their avarice and hoarding.
---
Well fuck me runnin, you‚Äôre right.
---
same, its been happening all this week since the new patch
---
Turrets, Stash Box, Resource Collectors - in that order. LOL Learned my lesson the hard way too.
---
whats your psn ?
---
No
---
Have you done the lying Lowe quests? It makes a lot more sense once you do! üëçüòÇ
---
Same but they turned right around and did me a solid by giving me plans I had been searching for for ages. I think the main issue I have is telling people no lol.. just have to remind myself that this is the wasteland, and I need those caps!!
---
I just want a hardened .50 receiver...got a 50 cal refined atm.
---
There was a lengthy thread earlier this week about exactly these ideas. Tbh if you could get:
---
-ballistic fiber
---
-nuka cola
---
-springs/screws
---
-booze
---
-dogfood
---
-chems
---
-etc.
---
People would pvp for these workshops!
---
I have hesitated renaming because I feared some bug would be unleashed that would delete all my PA s.
---
Where the MREs?
---
I drop spare ammo in the register in front of the whitesprings workshop vendor. Used to be in the suitcase in watoga, but not as common a place to visit, and freezes out lower levels kinda.
---
Share the wealth then!
---
Seriously though, I wish I had that problem. I'm always broke. I can't afford plans or serums like everyone else. I can barely get 2,500 caps, let alone 25,000!
---
3x the content
---
Oh yeah, many times since the last update. Xbox 1 x.
---
Okay lol. If this is a complaint, it‚Äôs a silly complaint.
---
LMAO, Bethesda fixing shit.
---
Go buy Skyrim for the refrigerator and whatever else they half-ass it to and see the same fucking bugs from 2011.
---
They already have your money. You aren't getting a fix, mang.
---
DEMOCRACY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE!
---
I have an Alt named ‚ÄúThe Bank‚Äù that lives in a CAMP called ‚ÄúThe Bank‚Äù which is a bank that has a lot of traps in it ;)
---
Someone has, there's a video up on YouTube of it.
---
Yep, my copy/paste skills were lacking when I did that. Took it out until I reopen everything and locate the Forms I was looking at when I found it.
---
WHY IS EVERYONE DOING THIS RIGHT BEFORE GAME OF THRONES
---
It's not like we're repairing hundreds of things at once either. When most people have to repair it's 5 things or less. So those extra two buttons would add literally 5 extra seconds to the time it wouldve taken.
---
I think the whole "press Space to cancel, press Tab to scrape favorited item" thing is more of a pain. Tab is ALWAYS back for everything else. Why make it space for this thing?
---
Since you seem in-the-know, how do you feel about the larger magazine mod?  That‚Äôs the only upgrade I‚Äôm missing and I‚Äôm trying to decide if I care.
---
100%, right now workshop pvp is only done to grief or just hunt in boredom when people don't have the balls for survival mode
---
Or here's a good idea repairing armour and weapons only take steel
---
Good! At least you're contributing. You could branch out and become a conduit if you've got stims to keep yourself alive or help revive folks too, but hey, if you're taking out those damn buzz bombs you're doing your part!
---
Lol no one is gonna be on
---
You know, i found a max level meat hook the other day, 3* with increased power attack, decreased damage while blocking and I don't even remember the other one. I was thinking of trying that out for a while, especially considering it benefits from both one handed and unarmed perks and I'm at 15 strength. I've got a lvl 50 furious buzz blade, which is great in a sb fight, but it's honestly just boring.
---
This is how I play the game. I've been going since beta in my free time, am level 92 I think with my main, but I'm just trying to use whatever is most fun at the time. Like my junkies explosive gatling. I have zero heavy perks, it's just fun.
---
I noticed it still takes damage just a lot less when invisible.  What I find dumb is ppl trying to melee it when visible. That's how you get killed.
---
It's all good.. Since I got a decent minigun I occasionally forget about the existence of Gatlings too lol
---
I joined one without knowing what to do. I just killed off eyebots and gutsys, and nothing seemed to happen when it ended. Soooo.....I may give it another shot if/when I see another one. 
---
But yes, massive chaos. LOL
---
That's what happened to me after I named mine lol
---
Mannequins
---
Even if all three were -4 with class freak you would be trading 1 agi,chr,int for 3str and endurance. Its still pretty  powerful. 
---
Maybe include some big weakness you can't class freak away.  Like +2str,+2end, -4int and because yourr a neanderthal you communicate poorly and thus lose the ability to benefit from teammates shared perk cards.
---
I think this is how I get most of my visitors, lol.
---
Hell yeah, release that inner raider! As someone else has stated, once player vending comes, prices should be more obvious. So, another month if possible being a rube ü§§ü§§üëà
---
Totally accurate except we ended up running out of time and haven't seen the event since
---
My suggestion is try the Savage devide. Loss less people, lots more room, better locations, only downside is you'll need a few turrets to take care of pests.
---
New boss?
---
Sheepsaquash
---
Somewhere along development they decided to not make 1:1 scale. So stuff is going to be cut out.
---
Well not just this, as mines are closed, the air shafts are filled. But, there's lots of cracks and crevasses in these here hills... air gets in. Often, they smolder for years, instead of burning. Preston County had one not long ago, as did Marion county. the Marion one was right next to a major commuter road. I saw an underground mine fire catch a slag pile ablaze one day, and it appeared an abandoned concrete building was on fire. But I was 10.. .so take the burning concrete for what it's worth.
---
I'm on Xbox 1X and I have been having the same problem. Hopefully it'll be fixed in a patch soon or hotfix I guess.
---
It's coming with player vending update.
---
Only time I see camps get attacked, is if they're near Whitespring or Charleston station.
---
Riot Shield with Power Arnor seems cool
---
got a two shot Handmade, and a 2 shot Combat rifle last time i ran that one, but have only ever received fedora and sheepsquach outfit (body, not head), before that.
---
Awwww. I wanted to get my fix man
---
Saving my *** bloodied gamma gun for this exact purpose!
---
Could you or someone else please tell me why on earth it‚Äôs worth so much? Apart from its rareness. What‚Äôs so good about it?
---
I had this issue once and I have the items to a friend who then was able to do it. I'm aware it's of no help to you, hopefully someone can attach it for you, or provide a solution.
---
My onion? Not worth the added weight. Clip is already 250 and it reloads in like 2 seconds.
---
From my experience the eyebots come AFTER a blast zone dies all lvl 1 some even legendary , I got the protectrons once and I have no clue why that happened
---
Reg. Binoculars but with zoom using Q.
---
It also tags enemies that you fiund using the Pearlpeepers
---
It's more work but if you master the rhythm you can get a significantly faster fire rate by tapping the fire button instead of holding it down with the gatling gun. Can't just tap spam but once you get it down it's 75,% ish higher rate of fire. Takes a little getting used to.
---
Neon electric blue/lavender

Players who fetishise the Enclave or Legion are so fucking absurd I can't tell if they're just memeing or not.
---
I wonder how poor Josh Sawyer feels looking at the Legion LARPers.
---
My Fist Camp was near a Fissue site, beside a Raider camp, then I moved shortly after realizing it was a bad idea to have it there (scorchbeats)...then I moved to Lewisberg...again...bad idea...higher level enemies spawns and whatnot. So then I moved just SW of Bolton Greens, between two hydro towers. It was ok but every spawn in I was attacked by level 1-6 scorched and mutants...or Protectrons or commie robots....and wasn't a fan of being on a hill...made building hard...Now I'm at the bottom of the Savage Divide, overlooking cranberry Bog on a cliffside and I rarely get attacked...my most recent attack was today with 3 level 10 wolves...which has been the worst attack there so far....previous record was 2 level 5 molerats.
---
You're being really dramatic dude. Its actually kind of ridiculous. The *superior* repair kit is earned by playing the game. The basic version you can get with atoms, and I doubt they'll even be more desirable than the earnable ones.
---
Yes. I keep ending up in the river next to my camp.
---
"  Please resolve this problems with the game. "
---
Can't see it happening anytime soon.

Tse Tesla ?
---
Mine gets trashed often too, I run a shop that deals flux, so once in a while some bloodied sob starts breaking my camp down to goad me into pvp for free flux.
---
It‚Äôs so goddamn annoying.

You expect logic.  Lol.

This is why I deleted this gem.

If your gonna beat on the immune robot im gonna let it get you down and when that happens you wont get a nice healing stimpack and the embrace of my healing perks im gonna eat you im gonna rip you throat out with my bare teeth and im gonna enjoy it
---
Can confirm am fallout alchoholic
---
The only worshop worth getting is the ammo factory. And that one just barely. 
---
I would defend the hell out of a ballistic fiber workshop.
---
I quit. You all should as well.
---
Still does.
---
Someone (maybe captainoob) showed that as legit with the right build. I think it was swing speed and he used sneak.
---
Steel farming for life.
---
Everyone has been saying the last patch broke mods. Hopefully it‚Äôs fixed soon
---
The only reason i use it is the long mag of the regular one drives me crazy obstructing the view. The extended one is a drum and protrudes far less.
---
Hell yes it is
---
Why would they? They already have the code for checking in place, they only need to let the game check before the player actually loads in himself.
---
Aka "connect" to the server via main menu like usual but before you actually start loading the server gets the "set camp here request" and does the usual attempt at placing the camp (doesn't even need to appear on the server itself) and if it's successful it starts your usual "connected to server. Loading..." thing and if not gives you the same choice as usual if you still want to connect to this server or look for another one
---
I got all the mutations the old fashioned way, minus one of the bad ones that I eliminated with RadAway.
---
Think I'm gonna try that for a while. I like one shotting most mobs with the sledge, but slicing and dicing has a nice sound to it.
---
5th try for that and the asylum, I was holding my breath each time as I got near.
---
my response was a joke lol
---
Do you know if the freeze affects her when she‚Äôs shielded or only when she‚Äôs ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù?
---
Known bug
---
I only got three from the billboard. Checked twice.
---
It's five days old and a lot of people are doing it for the first time.  You're right - they don't know the mechanics.  I stumbled into it myself, and within twenty seconds of starting the event, there were a dozen people there and I couldn't even tell what was going on.  Add the exploding eyebombs, and yes, some stray rounds are getting wasted...
---
I‚Äôve done it 3 times now to be safe, gonna do an edit.  It takes her being vulnerable otherwise the balls seem to just stick and not freeze.
---
I'm kinda surprised that WV didn't have their own regional flavour, like Cranberry.
---
In honor of the GOT premiere tonight. Tell Sheepsquatch, winter is coming.
---
Not really. If a game does not perform well over time ( and multiple patches ) then it deserves a roasting occasionally.
---
Well the reason most people get angry with PVP is that it's usually unwanted and unbalanced
---
Cloth is in just about everything and acid most people don't use so you could probably get it off someone
---
Workshop suck. Only use them to get what I need if no other option is available. Set up with minimum stuff (no turrets) HIDE on site or nearby. Clean out extractors immediately dump acid into stash and  hide again. Never take a workshop then travel around you will be murdered for sure.  Even doing the hide and harvest method, an asshat will eventually one shot you in the back, just takes longer. Block asshat, jump servers repeat until you got enough then jump servers to ditch the workshop. I now avoid workshops totally - just built on an acid vent and collect acid slowly but never have to use a workshop ever again.
---
those bugs has been adressed since beta. this game becoming annoying, and you cant tell me that they are doing fine. fucking blind people. if you dont see those bugs doesnt mean theyre not in the game and dont make people mad. grow tfup.
---
But ...but ...I like pushing buttons üòá 
---
Lolol but yep it's much worse now they should put it back the other way
---
Some people are just sore losers some don‚Äôt understand how pvp works and freak out when they realise they lose caps and junk. I think whatever the case people like that shouldn‚Äôt participate in pvp.... or they shouldn‚Äôt be allowed mic‚Äôs
---
17 flavors is probably just a marketing...I bet it's just the excretion of a slurm queen.
---
There is a .308 LMG in the game. You‚Äôll burn through your ammo so fast with it, but it packs a punch.
---
They broke mods in the last patch. I made a post about this and it is also a problem for armor PA and weapons wether melee or range
---
Event reward
---
Disagree about the luck part.
---
With drum mag it reloads faster too.
---
i have been buying and saving maps for weeks..have about 600 right now lol
---
No just a pipe pistol
---
Lol
---
Met him in Whitesprings. I think he can walk the entire map. O perhaps it's a random occurrence and the game chooses a player to spawn him nearby. So he can appear anywhere.
---
But they were in passive and physically came off it to do PvP after being asked if they wanted to.
---
Genuine theory here. If you notice the screen it brings you to says "workbench repair." This will be next to the future option of "repair kit repair" which will cost atoms. So now if you dont have materials you just use atoms instead...
---
Cool. I just had a 3* quad cryolator drop two days ago. I‚Äôm glad to hear there‚Äôs a good use for it.
---
I have 2 pieces of armor that reduces weapon weight by 20%. If it wasn't for those, I would be screwed. I run between 2 and 4 rifles depending on how I feel. An extra 150 pounds by using a backpack would be a godsend.
---
\+1 strength combined with 20% redux effects = awesomeness to me. Even more so when I can add deep pockets to them...carry weight for days.
---
Awesome PSA!  This is really good news 'cause unlike the SBQ, she seems to be immune to Enforcer.
---
Just use spotify, i found a playlist of every fallout song i play it instead of the radio
---
Whenever I‚Äôm low on wood I just throw on woodchucker and go to to I think it‚Äôs called Sylvia and sons logging camp, an easy 3-400 wood in one visit, all nicely stacked close together. 
---
Place only spawns a couple typically easy to kill enemies too.
---
Well, you could buy all the mutations on the cheap, too, but that's not having the ability to make them. Then there's all the power armor plans and the fancy camp items at studio 68 or whatever. I mean, if you wanted something to spend caps on so you could repeat the cycle.
---
I know MODS are buggered right now. But learnt plans, or unlocked modifications were ok. I can modify my guns with ease, but haven't tried anything with armor yet. I'll assume you have all the required perks set up. I still forget to swap my makeshift and power armor perks around.
---
Spotify is kinda buggy on my PS4 and with a game running on top of that. Plus I'd like to still be able to hear in game things, Spotify tends to be very loud over top of what I'm doing
---
They probably thought they might have stood a chance and were just too cocky. They lost and instead of remembering it's just a game, they lost their shit.
---
And it's does NOT change the count . Put one on mine and it's still 250
---
Oh, wow. If 40 took me 4 hours, you‚Äôre looking at like 60 hours to dig then all! Of course some of my time was documenting the results so you should be able to go quicker. But still, it‚Äôs going to take awhile!
---
War doesn‚Äôt change, neither do people. I do a lot of genealogy and love the stories I dig up with the names. We‚Äôve advanced our society so it‚Äôs a lot easier to stay alive in (and way more fun), but humans behave like humans no matter the century.
---
What in tarnation
---
Or a master baiter?
---
You loot it or just wait for event 2 end?
---
I'm speaking generally, not just in reference to this specific incident.
---
Ahh so that's how they do it! I always wondered if shotgunners just had to twiddle their thumbs when it came to scorchbeasts that didn't land by themselves. Definitely more tempted to switch to shotguns now.
---
lol..yeh and its going to take a lot of space up..i will b in a team of 4 too and they also have maps lol
---
Fast travel mats exist for workshops...no idea why we cant for camps.
---
That my friend is a nearly perfect item to stash away for the legendary vendor...3 stars and very low weight!
---
ahh no worries
---
Check your apparel and notes, you may have received something else as it doesn't always show on screen what you were awarded for the event.
---
I‚Äôm constantly hitting the wrong buttons when I go to repair. Pretty annoying.
---
And since you all get some of the loot from each other when you dig if you‚Äôre close to each other, it‚Äôs gong to be a TON! Wish I could be on that team :)
---
Since its on nexus mods is it only for pc?
---
You know you can grab more than one pylon, ya? I've had to do this a couple times because people didn't know what to do.
---
In the church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster pirates are considered to be spiritual beings who‚Äôs demise directly relates to the increase in global warming.
---
thanks so much for the help man, really appreciate it. 
---
I accidentally held A for a split second longer than I meant when I went to revive someone, whoops
---
Sweet! Just got a legendary cryolator for my heavy weapons user. Been wanting to test that puppy out, thanks :)
---
That is a dead meme that was used in youtube rewind, but still funny
---
Yep.  I think the only reason the north has largely escaped this fate is the continued development around Morgantown (being a college town) and all the Marcellus/Utica development along US-50 and along the Ohio that's brought in enormous amounts of money to the area.
---
I‚Äôve got a tse dragon as well
---
I got like 60 of em was thinking bout selling them but not after reading this lol good write up brother ty
---
Aye I can‚Äôt attach the sacrificial blade mod to the machete
---
This is one you definitely want to stash your junk before you FT to it...I'm fairly high level, 165, and I've died a couple of times. I also have two pieces of life saving armor,  so that helps quite a bit too
---
If the artists at Bethesda have ANY knowledge of real world weapons they wouldn‚Äôt require us to scrap the scope when we want to use a reflex sight then remanufacture the scope when we want to use it again.
---
Just asked the same question myself. I hope somebody knows, I haven't seen any other ones (aside from the 4 we have) in other people's camps either.
---
I've never once had someone level my CAMP. Is this kinda stuff limited to console or something?
---
This spreadsheet is the best I've found that lists event rewards:

Both coats seem to come from Mire events, it seems. Specifically:
---
Daily: Queen of the Hunt
---
Daily: Idle Explosives
---
Event: Heart of the Swamp
---
Event: Always Vigilant
---
Daily: Waste Not
---
Daily: Play Time
---
Event: Irrational Fear
---
Event: Its a Trap
---
I own both but bought them. Paid way way way too many caps.
---
I wrote to a couple tourism boards and suggested creating travel packages to places in he game. When I get to Boston next year I plan on visiting some Fallout 4 locations. There must be others interested in visiting game sites.
---
When I was at Virginia Tech in the 80‚Äôs I forgot we used go to a friend of a friend‚Äôs house in Beckley a few times - until I hit Beckley in Fallout. It looks enough like the real place that a bunch of memories came rushing back when I saw it.
---
This happened to me as well and I put in more than usual damage so idk what is up with that
---
Before I was low level and could hit her with a pipe and drop a 3 star gun
---
Did you shoot/hit or damage it at all in any way? It doesn‚Äôt drop loot if not.
---
Lol ok.
---
Good idea! Where‚Äôs your camp with an acid block? That‚Äôd be perfect
---
they are not available yet...there are 100 posts about this already
---
Try and put the steel beams under the stairs setting along the outside of the overhang, it looks realistic and cool as crap. Also they're indestructible and are great for cover
---
Where's does it say that? On my screen it says boiled water, wood, razorgrain.  For razorgrain soup obviously lol but I don't see radiated water.
---
Well...crap. Way to not tell us, Bethesda. :(
---
Also your camp looks great, my comment suddently stopped
---
I shot it a lot. I‚Äôm not a very high level but I definitely hurt it.
---
Not a single enemy I killed in the blast zone dropped any loot.
---
Cheers, I'll be sure to try that.
---
Theres 2 on each one 2 on map and 2 on billboard to tthe right
---
The guns in fallout are made by the survivors for the most part, and out of steel and other heavy shit instead of the plastics you‚Äôll find your guns are made of. It actually does make sense and fits with the story of the apocalypse.
---
Phone app? Discord?
---
Pvp is super unbalanced atm. When you have to hit him 50 times and he only has to hit you once, that's more than enough to make someone rage quit. Some people say you have to figure out how pvp works but srsly this is just bad game design.
---
I looted it. I did notice that I never got an end of event set of rewards. Knowing my luck it bugged out.
---
No problem! There were vultures around so I didn't want you to loose the loot.
---
I wonder if a ‚ÄúFallout ‚Äò76con‚Äù in Charleston would ever work?
---
In fallout 4, replacing a mod with another put the original mod in your inventory and you could switch between the two as much as you wanted. Not sure why they changed it.
---
That‚Äôs bullshit then!? I‚Äôd be pissed!
---
I have two 3 star legendary railway rifles both with 90% reduced weight feature, both still weight 6 pounds. I guess the non-legendary version weighs like a real locomotive.
---
Well, Huntington pretty much is the OD capital of the state, so your sarcasm isn't really warranted.  Haven't been back there in years, and don't have much desire to either.  
---
The biggest problem the southern counties have is the downturn in coal. Most of these counties relied heavily on wages and taxes from the mining companies. There were also jobs transporting it to wherever it was being used, usually a coal fired power plant. Many of these plants around the state are transitioning to natural gas as it requires less work to supply long term (no prep plants, barge docks, railyards, etc.  just a pipeline coming in).
---
Good recommendations in this thread. Gonna have to farm these spots.
---
How about a way to pump and store dirty water?
---
fishing is not in the game yet sir.
---
Happens to me all the time, without failure. Pisses me off I have to back out of the work bench every time.
---
Well you got the drill and got screwed, so just wait for the legendary wood and build a cabinet to store your fedora's
---
Hell yeah I‚Äôm pissed. I‚Äôve been to so many nuke events and that‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve seen people bring the queen down, and nothing.
---
I get you, but also enemy AI in this game isn't incredibly sophisticated. It's not hard to design your CAMP so it's set up to defeat spawns
---
Thats the idea with a rain catcher, would be lore friendly since the radiation currently in the wayer has to come forom somewhere. Maybe its not too bas in the rain but when it collects its worse or something?
---
Met too. I am quitting until it is fixed, or at least a work around is presented. I had not solved the riddle yet, the patch came, then I lost the quest and can't reactivate it.
---
You didn't die and respawn did you? If you do then all damage from you is  null and void.
---
Well in Fo76 they also let us use the lead in pencils (carbon) to make bullets.
---
I feel like you should meet /u/Veingloria
---
No I didn‚Äôt die once while the event was active
---
Good to know, thanks
---
Also, once you mod it with the "flaming" mod, it cannot be taken off....not that it's a bad thing or anything...just an fyi.
---
Just ran it on my level 30. Ended up conduit on all 3, which seems to happen a lot. Died less than everyone else which was funny.
---
Up vote for laugh
---
Same thing happened to me where I was stuck at 5/5 motors and couldn't progress to the next stage of the quest. Relogging fixed it.  These problems are many months old.  Gotta love the substandard support.
---
I'm thankful for you guys pointing out things to try.
---
If you know where you're going in the silos don't stop to engage any robot you don't have to.
---
There is an assaultron ( or two ) in the final stage I don't think you can avoid but I think you can out pace the earlier ones.
---
When I launched my 2nd nuke I ran into a 3 star legendary assaultron in the launch room which killed me. So I respawn outside and run back in and take the sob out ( just).
---
It‚Äôs so stupid.
---
This also happened with the encryptid event
---
Good know.  I've yet to launch a nuke.. But was thinking about it today
---
Hmm, iv had them not spawn a legendary but never nothing at all.
---
I know, right. You‚Äôd think the GIANT ROBOT armed with WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION spewing AMERICAN PROPAGANDA would be. You know. Not exactly subtle.
---
#getting downvoted for this post? confimes exactly what I was saying
---
I do the same thing, personally, no reason to go to a location if you only have 1 or 2 maps of a location.
---
If it's not your not playing it right.
---
Someone already summoned. Sorry
---
Yup they probably feeling guilty for screwing us over and removing the meat piles with hardened mass it, probably part of the change where it is now instanced per player.
---
The rads are what gives the taste.
---
Assuming and speculating are two different things.
---
Exactly why I carry 2x of almost everything. Hate going to the repair shop all the time. Even though finding two exact identical legendaries is nearly impossible, there are many similar ones that function about the same.
---
And that tingle in your pancreas, don't worry its just the radiation helping with cell growth.
---
UnlikedMurder, I play the game quite a bit and I use melee weapons along with others.  This would make it much more enjoyable.   So what if players sat back to reap the benefits too.   There would be nothing wrong with that.   Most enemies in the game can be killed with one or 2 hits with the proper melee build.   Obviously with the exception of a few stronger enemies.  I currently try to do minimal damage so everyone can get something off of the enemies.  But most players don't do that.   So this would make it so much better for everyone.
---
your lucky, I think my game is broken, not had a hardened mass or High radiation fluid drop for months now. even at whitesprings
---
I'm going to do a few things before I try to make the assaultron recall if you and your guys want to stick around for the Encrypted event
---
Omg thats a great idea! If only i could see the damned thing...
---
Literally running in circles the entire time.
---
I have my camp in top east of toxic valley on a junk n lead extractor and it's rarely attacked. water is super close I just walk there pop radx  spam the water to get like 200 water than go to camp to boil with super duper on then put it in my stash and use whenever I need it in the future. I also get the lucky whatever workshop with 3 acid resources and grafton steel mill and I never run out of ammo materials to craft üôÇ
---
It will also hit any nearby robots.   At least when I tried it before.   That never ends well.   lol
---
I got tons of all of them tonight. Maybe it has to do with the patch.
---
Ah!
---
Now that you mention it I didn't find any in the meat piles like I usually do.
---
Meh. It would make more sense but really that would be a waste of purified water. Use it to craft 4 diluted stimpaks per Regular stimpak and sometimes 8 with super duper on.
---
You would pay good money, but Bethesda wouldn't pay for Swingin on a Star so it was removed.
---
Just wondering, you don't build a C.A.M.P. as a shop for yourself? It's fun making one!
---
There's a mod for it, I'm pretty sure I got it. It's a different ammo reciever
---
For some reason, it reappeared for me. It been ages since I finished the questline but it appeared anyways. I logged out and logged back in, it was gone. Really buggy quest it seems
---
No, not weird at all, I do the same!üëçüòÇ
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Can you post a picture of it?
---
If I could hear Wolf over all the f@#$% pylon humming, sheepsqaucth baahing, eyebot exploding, mr gusty "kick your ass"ing. Then I probablynwould have had a easier time understanding it.
---
So pretty much I cant join the BoS?
---
Super duper?
---
" Maybe you should think before saying stupid things? "
---
You should take your own advice.
---
My first time was chaotic and I died a few times but I actually got decent rewards. I didn‚Äôt understand how the pylons worked until the second time though. The first three events I got good three star weapons, 2 of them gave me nothing even though I did a good 20% of the damage and the rest were shitty 1-2 Star legendaries.
---
Can you wear it over your power armor. I've got my excavator to +500 carry weight ...still need more üòè
---
Hey, we're doing tours of areas in the game that are true life places. We did the Asylum last Sunday, today we didn't do a tour but we're going to do WVU, Hillbilly Hot Dogs, etc. If you have ANY interest in leading a tour of ANY area or place on the map please, let me know. IF you are not on PC we would still be glad for a write up or recorded message or anything. People really really loved the Asylum tour. I had no idea how depraved that place was
---
You should do mayor for a day after you hit lvl 50. That way you get a lvl 50 all rise.
---
It \*is\* really fucking annoying - why did they change?    
---
Did they make it annoying on purpose, another way to promote "Repair Kits"?!?
---
Seriously?
---
I haven't gone to toxic valley yet. Still plodding along in charleston.
---
From southern WV and currently in Pikeville KY. Small world. 
---
Hey, the economy here is awful, sure, but people here have felt taken advantage of for years by politicians, coal companies, and the media. We‚Äôre sort of used to it. 
---
There is a common theme in popular culture that if you are from this part of the country you are probably uneducated, dirty, obese, and on something. The truth is these hills are filled with some of the nicest people on earth. Most of have all of our teeth, we‚Äôre not all obese (you have never run a 5k until you‚Äôve run a 5k through these mountains), and we are not all addicted it something. 
---
The local high school has a 95+% rate of its graduates going on to further their education. We‚Äôre an intelligent industrious people. We just need corporations besides Walmart, dollar general, and Patriot coal to realize that. 
---
Seriously, I practice medicine and I‚Äôd much rather practice here than most of the places you all are from! Haha! Really, though, I lived in Texas for awhile and the people were *almost* as nice, but I couldn‚Äôt wait to get back.
---
So, I know it comes from a good place, but y‚Äôall stop feeling so sorry for us. Just tell Amazon or Google or somebody where we are. We‚Äôd love to show them what all those years in the mines taught our people about work ethic.
---
Maybe, but when there was the passion fruit shortage people noticed the difference when they changed the recipe, so who knows.
---
Because what's going to happen is the repair kits will display first in the menu and then you'll have to bypass them to use a workshop repair.
---
I kinda always thought this.
---
Currently 5 days and counting, unfortunately.  Did you do anything different to fix the issue?
---
It actually is fucking annoying - \*every\* time I have to repair something it's both different, and, an extra step, for no good reason.
---
Let‚Äôs do this. I‚Äôm joining your game

Didn‚Äôt say it was a bad idea, assface, I said it costs money and people.
---
I agree to an extent. During a nuke people do get selfish. Usually when this happens I just go ape shit and kill everything as quickly as possible. Because fook them, that's why. They dont care, I dont either. So I guess just try to be the first one there is only advice i can offer. I know it sucks but i dont ever see bethesda doing this. If someone on a 4man squad cant get a single hit on a ghoul before there killed it's just meant to be. Not trying to shit on your parade but it's a dog eat dog world man. Fallout 76 is a savage world. Just saying. Lol
---
Thanks for understating my problems, I appreciate it.
---
The southern part of the state is rough and only gets worse the further south you go. The lack of good paying jobs has caused a lot of issues. Most work is either minimum wage or state/local government outside of the major cities. The mines used to be great for the local economy but coal is dying off.  These southern counties relied heavily on it and were hit the hardest by its downturn. 
---
In addition to the economic woes, the state is plagued by public corruption. Embezzlement, election tampering [1], government officials dealing drugs [2], etc. 
---
[1] Notable case:  Lincoln county sheriff arrested for ballot stuffing. Pled guilty. 
---
[2] Mingo county sheriff shot dead in his cruiser. Federal officers descended on the county government and uncovered the sheriff was involved in a drug ring and used a local judge to silence someone who may speak out.
---
Never had mine attacked by griefers but often super mutants, mole-rats, goauls, and mole-miners. Most of the time my turrets handle them, until I get there except my crops and brahim are killed and need to be repaired.
---
Yep!
---
The flaming chainsaw is the most metal thing in the game.
---
I learned to press "T" to repair, just leave it that way, Jesus fucking Christ - just add a NEW option for "Repair Kits" there's absolutely no reason they need to make it different/extra step to do it the way we did before.
---
Hey, if you're soloing an event, go nuts, blow everything to pieces. But temper it back when there are lower players involved. At least put the explosive weapon on secondary slot. Tagging and moving away is always appreciated. Running across a room to tag a 3 star, only to have the two TSE shotgun players each shoot once and ahnialate it is a pain in the ass.
---
Had a guy do the same thing but there was a enemy nearby so he coulded FT. Had to find and kill that damn cat for him...
---
Hookedonphonics.Com
---
"Wow cool robot!"
---
Nope. Just logged back in the normal way.
---
Because it's an annoyance - life already has enough annoyances, why ad another one here when it's *totally unnecessary* \- they could add repairs kits without taking away the existing method of pressing "T" to repair at a bench w/materials - just add another command to repair with a kit.  Seriously!
---
sorry man, finished it a little while ago. But I'm trying to find the Recall Keycard Circuit Board to start up the Encrypted event
---
it‚Äôs really dumb to set a fixed ceiling for all players, the limit needs to grow as players level up. I‚Äôve reached 25k long ago and stayed at the level ever since, usually I just leave stuff i don‚Äôt need at trainstation in those suitcases. Paperbags aren‚Äôt very reliable.
---
With the last part of your comment, I have that issue and a similar one when sorting stuff by weight. Consume something, then the list gets re-sorted for whatever reason.
---
If it was sorted by weight correctly the first time, then items shouldn't jump up the list several entries.
---
There was absolutely no good reason to break how it was already working, they could have simply ***left it the way it was*** and added another seperate command to repair with a kit, no good reason to stop people from being able to use what they had learned (press the "T" key to repair).
---
"Why doesn't it load the server map to check for C.A.M.P. placement before it loads the server map?" That's just not how logic works, son.
---
Second this wholeheartedly, works like a charm. Used it on the SBQ, and now the Sheepsquatch. Makes life easier.
---
Yes. I really need purple PA.  Needed it.
---
You can get wayyy higher. Unyielding gives 15 with a full set. With 15 charisma and a full set, that‚Äôs 30. That doesn‚Äôt even count mutations, alcohol and perks.
---
This mod worked for me: [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/285](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/285)
---
It would encourage people not helping I can assure you. Fortnite STW has a major AFK//Leecher problem because you get rewards regardless of contribution.

This is an Ice pun.

Sentinels with melee: "Come here so I can stab ya!!!"
---
same issue i noticed in my camp. first started after i moved a rug. It goes away if i change the floor from one of the atom shop versions to the normal wood or metal / mesh floor :(
---
oof
---
That would be something! Help the economy of the small town, and make it a tourist attraction, where at the same time make known Fallout76 game and the small towns of West Virginia to tourists.
---
Some countries are doing it, like Thailand takes tourist on a boat ride to see "James Bond rock" or Tomb Raider movie sets in Cambodia or the Shire in New Zealand or even Harry Potters Gloucester Cathedral in England. 
---
Why not?
---
I think it should depend on how badly damaged the armour is. 0-25% should be steel/leather, 26-50% should be both, 51-75% whatever else is used for armour and the last % should add screws.
---
Technical or not, it totally breaks pvp. when you see your enemy go down to 1 health, it's natural to congratulate yourself on the kill and move on. Your tactics change on how low your enemy is and so on and on but these are never the thing in fallout 76. You just have to keep shooting until you hear the caps rolling in. I bet bethesda is aware of this since people were bitching about it since day 1. Maybe it's a difficult thing to fix? who knows
---
I also reload and still haven't figured out why we need steel to make ammo.  Maybe they're substituting steel for brass since it's not in game?
---
Have about 30 of them will have to get some digging soon.
---
People think it was a joke when natives here have said that, as a person who lives here, this post is really accurate! Come here yourself if you don't believe him XD West Virginia is so beautiful but omg is the economy here pathetic.
---
Ok
---
It would be nice if Paint Cans actually had a purpose and Armour Racks would be awesome.
---
I'm sorry, but the only people legally allowed to remind anyone that \*Nothing But Trouble\* exists are the members of Digital Underground.
---
Good ol Becky. The shitty downtown isn‚Äôt too far off from the game.
---
Go back to the taxidermy place and check the bird upstairs with all the pictures and red string on it. There should be three more quests since you already did the picnic one. Interact with the white sheets of paper on the board.
---
I would *love* to be able to launch a nuke one day in the game, but I don‚Äôt even understand how to go about doing it.  I‚Äôm stuck on a BOS mission (I‚Äôm assuming progressing the bos missions will get me closer but jesus fuck watoga is hell)
---
I‚Äôve actually only failed once out of maybe 12 times, because I took my time getting there and no one seemed to know what to do. I think that‚Äôs where most of the problems arise from, players not knowing what to do and having their voice chat off.
---
The imposter might do crazy damage but it actually has very low health, which is the opposite of the SBQ who has a massive health pool and does crap damage. It‚Äôs almost like a glass cannon. I could probably solo it with some preparation, without any legendary armor. All I‚Äôd need is stims and my explosive prime gatling or .50 and to sit up on the house. My weapons are only explosive too, if they were tse it‚Äôd be even better, and I already do a good 20% of the damage to the imposter in a group and that‚Äôs while I‚Äôm on crowd control at the same time.
---
I'm from across the border in PA. I always liked going to Morgantown or hiking in the woods down there, so I've been showing friends where I used to hang out.
---
I have a friend near Ripley, he's taking me to the Mothman Museum next visit!
---
They should add a terminal with a chair or a chair that that auto opens the pitboy to the atom store
---
Using China rather than Russia as the main antagonist was actually pretty forward thinking when they started writing this universe in the mid 90s. We were still in the early post-Glastnost cold war, and most of the west still seriously distrusted what was left of the USSR.
---
PM me on reddit?
---
Boiled water is still irradiated, you just dont get sick from drinking it
---
This is true also, many west Virginians are so friendly lol
---
Ps4?
---
You buy the rest. People who play the game way too much use a bunch of other characters to sell to vendors and make loads of caps, then buy what they want on the reddit marketplace. Still takes a while and is boring but way faster than finding everything you want by yourself.
---
Yeah I guess my buffer tube, stock, and vertical grip (which aren't a game option), some of my red dot, are all that's plastic but I still don't see it adding up to +13 lbs.
---
Wow I didn‚Äôt know you could turn in two for a better chance
---
Oh yeah it only needs the best armor you can‚Äôt get, plus some high dps. I‚Äôm level 52 and played over 110 hours and I have nothing that can do hardly any damage. I‚Äôm pretty casual so I don‚Äôt go hunting the best builds but even so, I should be more effective against it and I‚Äôm just not.
---
Didnt get he Sloth one and gitta go to work. Left me a little salty cause I did find one fighting YaoGuai and I got a few hits in but they killed it. Didnt get any credit so was kinda irked. Not a big deal though, others were easy.
---
Yeah...I too got a fedora...but I'm low level and only got a shot in or two in on the sheepsquatch...as I too was just trying to be support guy. The next time I tried to focus more on shooting the sheepsquatch and got a mask. So I wonder if the drop conforms with how many shots you get in??? Just a thought...but man that event is a bitch! But fun franticness.
---
Oh doy lol well I feel stupidüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
1. C.A.M.P in places that people usually don't travel to. Ash Heap and Cranberry Bog/Savage Divide transition cliffs are pretty prime spots.
---
2. Stay away from standing bodies of water. If you think its good to place a purifier there, be sure that 15 other players thought the same thing.
---
3. Crouch while you're in your C.A.M.P, it keeps your dot off of the map. General rule of thumb is a stationary dot in the middle of nowhere is someone unaware at their camp, and is a calling card for ~~cowards~~ "raiders".
---
4. Keep a low profile. The less of a luminal and acoustic signature your C.A.M.P gives off, the better. A fully enclosed fusion generator puts off way less noise than multiple gas generators and less ambient lighting than a windmill.
---
5. DO NOT ACCEPT RANDOM TEAM INVITES. Sorry that the few spoil it for the many, but when you accept team invites from randoms, always assume its a strike team looking to hot-drop on your C.A.M.P after kicking you from team to wreck your work.
---
Oh doy lol well I feel stupid üòÇüòÇ
---
Just force close the game and when your at the main menu before you press play got to social and join somone on your recently played list.. problem solved üëç
---
Loading in
---
Just steel to make life easier
---
U cant join recently played with people, only your friends. I've tried already
---
Focus decrease spread while spliter increases spread I personally use the focus.
---
Loved maybe, but definitely not respected. They've been ridiculed for their bug ridden games for decades, this is really nothing new. Bethesda is famous for relying on the community to make unofficial patches to fix their games for them, it's basically a meme at this point.
---
Xbox app, I would guess
---
I've done it from social on the xbox menu (sorry forgot to specify that) there is a recently played section there.
---
The ghouls don‚Äôt spawn near the robots. Don‚Äôt run toward the bots and you‚Äôll be fine. I do this when people hide on buses with tse.  I‚Äôll run through the entire golf club to draw them out, tag everything at the same time
---
My Games is where the custom ini file goes.. The file is there twice because the one(s) in Program Files are the master files. And the ones on My Games are per-user settings (in the case of multiple people using the PC and playing Fallout 76 each can have their own settings).
---
Ohhh. I play on playstation and I don't think we have that
---
Ah ya idk how any of that works on windows or PC lol
---
It would be nice to hand my lvl 5 tse revolver to a alt and have something to do with the excess plans I have
---
Yeah bring on the endless load screens
---
Also Radiation fluids and glowing mass are doubled at times .. it's going to be random.
---
Have you seen the documentary from Huntington called Heroin(e)?
---
Its wild.  Crazy thing though, they don't show Marshall (the college that fills about a quarter of the town) At All.  Not a bit of green or the Marshall M.
---
Just like with getting into the stash, I will be pressing the wrong button for a while
---
Ok just to make sure we are talking about the same thing, I got a tooth mask thing that looks kinda like a deformed nutcracker.
---
That's what I'm using right now and it shreds on my 2shot plasma
---
But now I know to lok at the top east of toxic valley for a good camp position  :p
---
It gives no body an advantage over anyone else. At all. A player can repair his weapon instantly? Whoopie. He wont have to spend the 30 secs after 100 one-hit fights to repair his weapon.
---
It is not even minor.It gives a player absolutely no advantage over anyone else, it just allows them to not have to travel back to their camp to repair a weapon once.
---
The issue is that it opens up more abusive psy to win? I think you mean it MAY open up, in which case we would be outraged. Essentially, you're convicting thought crime. They arent allowed to sell repair kits because they MIGHT sell other stuff later. Guess what. They can still sell other stuff later.
---
Im not buying any repair kits, because I dont need to. I save materials. Im good. I guarantee, no player will be at an advantage over me because they can repair something faster. And if we are in an SBQ and they are a significant damage dealer, I PRAY they have repair kits, so that we have a better chance of winning.
---
No but that‚Äôs the part people don‚Äôt understand, Hi, I‚Äôm your neighbor the west (Pikeville Ky) honestly a lot of the towns and such in FO76 look a lot better than reality. We relied on coal too much, mountain Democrats and bought votes and only getting things done because you come from a big family with a patriarch or matriarch that can convince the whole family to vote for someone...that‚Äôs real fucking life in these mountains...
---
Personally I've always been a nig fan of the Brotherhood, i have a flag hanging on my wall.  So it has a high value to me simply because it's one of the few BoS related items/outfits.  As far as in general, it's because they've got a .03% chance or so to drop, so they're very hard to find.  Duping made them easier, more so on some platforms than others, but their rarity *is* why it's expensive.
---
I second this one...well..we knocked it out..then when we all ran up to loot it it blew up. Everyone died..on respawn its body either went to the 19th dimension or just blew down the hill a mile...but no one could find it. Pissed off a whole server lol.
---
And what the hell did they do to the friend's list? Used to be Alphabetical now I gotta scroll up and down to find a friend in a hurry
---
By the way I know its dumb but if your a conduit and "downed" the boss is still able to be attacked. Its actually cheaper on stimpaks to use scout life 4 "double bleed time"  long as the eyebombs stay away should only about 10 stimpaks plus any revive bonuses
---
I don't see u
---
Found 2 legendaries today in Fort Defiance, never seen any there before.
---
I still find a few at Whitesprings, but only low level ones. The only time I see more quantities is during the nuke zones there. Haven't scored anything worthwhile from West tek in quite a while.
---
Hey how‚Äôs it going, I‚Äôm from Floyd County right next to them lol, it cracks me up when I see posts about this. I love hear and it‚Äôs honestly far worse than this game could ever make it seem... entire houses built out of OSB and tin...but the people here..so many of them will love you no matter what, they‚Äôre just used to being forgotten or walked all over, they have nothing left and just want to live and die in peace
---
My camp lies on top of the cliff overlooking the entire cranberry bog. I can see nukes go off on the SBQ (rare nowadays but I see it sometimes)! First week or two or my camp being there I had a non stop dog problem &amp; my turrets would let them get half of my base before they decided to shoot. Been about 3 months at my camp spot &amp; I haven‚Äôt honestly been attacked in 2 months probably. That first dose of dogs learned their lesson &amp; now I live a peaceful life on my mini lake
---
I'll add that to my route :D
---
It's amazing, I got the double bar attachment on mine as well.
---
Don‚Äôt hate on my home state.
---
I can't figure out how to upload a picture of it lol but it's North of the butterfly and east of the big house thingy and in the patch of woods on the map just above the water lol ya I can't survive without GPS lololol
---
I built. Character around super sledges, with the intent of getting the all rise. Once I hit level 50 I do the quest, go home, and when I click it to move into my stash, it instantly dissapears. Never got it back.
---
Marine tactical helmet isn‚Äôt too bad... 30 ish caps with perks and mentats.  Serums if you can craft them
---
Isnt +210 the cap for excavator?
---
My biggest problem is 1400 daily cap limit at the vendors. I have zero troubles finding stuff to sell for 1400 even with the current vendor prices.
---
Same! West Tek always had a high chance to have 1 legendary at the top of the facility or the R&amp;D portion but i've had a dry streak there for a long time now since the patch. Only find legends at whitespring now for the most part.
---
Mothman omelets
---
Only issue I've ever had is mine got nuked once. I'm currently on one of the rocky ledges overlooking the train tracks a bit south of white springs station. I put it there because its just outside the blast zone for when people nuke the area. Worked great except the one time somebody nuked the resort itself instead of the usual  spot that keeps the golf club in the blast area.
---
I live in Ohio and it‚Äôs alil depressing seeing how the economy has shaped certain areas of the state. The only reason I visit these days is they do have some great white water rafting so there‚Äôs that I guess.
---
Personally I kill all the mole miners / super mutants/ scorch spawned by top of the world and just sell all the guns. 15 - 20 mins tops plus 5.56 ammo and shoty shells depending on whom spawned
---
That‚Äôs the god damn truth, there‚Äôs such potential in these hills, people that will literally walk 20 miles a day picking up pop cans to make 40 bucks, climb 10 miles of mountains to dig up ginseng, break their hearts in coal mines
---
But no one knows we exist, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs wrong...we‚Äôve been forgotten by even the people we end up voting for...
---
I was hoping for PA or camp blueprints since I‚Äôm over in weight. If you don‚Äôt have those maybe some ammo could work.
---
My old school Mosin weighs 8 lbs, with a big, old school Abercrombie &amp; Fitch optic. My Winchester model 97, VERY old school, is about the same.
---
With the heavy use of plastic and aluminum in the game, weights used are well beyond ridiculous.
---
I will have to take a look when I get there.
---
Thanks I‚Äôll look into it :)
---
I did hear whitesprings, west tek , and watago had the higher level legendaries nerfed but I haven‚Äôt seen confirmation on that.  I haven‚Äôt read the latest patch notes either
---
I used to eat at that Tudors every chance I got.  And I went to the Walmart near Oak Hill constantly.  A little bit north, and Summersville dies behind the mountain while the Walmart on 19 does well. 
---
Huntington did something similar too:  when the Interstates came through they forced them away from the town, instead of through the town like Charleston did. Huntington suffered for decades because it was 10 minutes away from the interstate exits.
---
I love my home state, and the people have really been taken advantage of.  And I think a lot of the old money doesn't want anything to change.
---
I have killed about 5k of robots since tuesday no Legendaries in watago period.
---
Xbox app
---
West Tek run easily yields more than 1400 cap limit.
---
Stock up on rubber.  I think you need three for the helmet
---
Amazon employs around 700-800 in Huntington, including some high paid careers :)
---
I don't recall seeing multiple fluids, only hardened and glowing. I may have just not noticed it tho.

If you‚Äôre running stealth build, you HAVE TO have sneak. Either lvls 1,2, or 3, but you MUST have that perk card for enemies not to see you. If you‚Äôre running EA and sneak lvl 3, you may as well be a ghost (speaking from my own experience, my character is a vats/sneak/crit build.)
---
Nivember.
---
&gt;Anyone familiar with online rpgs understands how necessary a wiki page is for new players as well as veteran players for reference.
---
Thank god we got that important point cleared up. I don't know about you, but I think this changes everything!
---
Yeah, I got it.
---
Ok thank you
---
Stealth is always fun! But I play stealth in every other game so I figured I might do something else for a change. If it doesn't work out, I'll definitely back to rifle + stealth as a last resort. Good luck!
---
i feel bad for laughing at this. I hope they fix this problem friend, it definitely sounds frustrating as all hell.
---
No problem friend :-)
---
Sprinkled in with the other vendors in the basement
---
Now that I think about it, the weights might not be exactly what the weapons weigh but what they feel like when holding them. For example, the tri barrel for the minigun adds something like 18 pounds. There‚Äôs no way it weighs 18 pounds more than the other barrels, but it does extend much further which would make it awkward to hold up, because the weight extends away from you. I hope that makes sense.
---
If anything west tek has become my new W/S, especially after the last patch
---
Man that shit irks  the crap out of me. Low lifes going around taking people's hard earned fiber optics. Yeah I know I should have stashed them before I went to the event, but still, its' shitty to take people's stuff. IF the game told you who was taking your shit, that would be AWESOME because at least then we could shame them over the mic
---
Unfortunately the darn thing triggered for me just as the holotape started. I‚Äôll have to give it another listen so that I can try to avoid dying 10 times ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
You haven‚Äôt truly quit until you stop lurking on the dedicated game subreddit.
---
It is just 3 extra quests right? Asking because I wanna be sure I‚Äôm not missing out on more of those head bust trophies
---
GOD I want those plans lol.
---
Steel can be used to make penetrators and also for cheaper casing than brass, maybe that‚Äôs why the weapons fall apart so quickly lol
---
And I STILL have 0/5 motors crafted for the final warnings quest, when do you plan on fixing this? u/Ladydevann
---
What's boring is when the dickshits show up and oneshot you with some overpowered build with no chance to retaliate.
---
Damn it man... this breaks my heart! I‚Äôve been farming that quest hoping to put a dead mothman above the entrance to the bridge in my camp :-(
---
That's handy if you need a little, but it sucks when they keep hitting us with the make 50 booze dailies so you need 200 dirty water at once.
---
Thanks for the info guys. I think I'm gonna move slowly over to shotgun (luckily the S.P.E.C.I.A.L layout for shotguns isn't too different from heavy). Once that build is done I'll get some demo perks to switch into every now and then when I want to rampage haha.
---
I will when I finish work tonight üòä
---
This is definitely happening. Been confirmed!
---
Oh also, didn't they remove the explosive scaling with demo expert? Or did they just nerf it?
---
I‚Äôve never seen confirmation that it‚Äôs coming with the player vending update. Last I saw they said ‚Äúa future update‚Äù and I‚Äôve asked for a source a couple times. I checked the ITV posts and they haven‚Äôt said that either unless I‚Äôve repeatedly missed it. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre wrong, I hope you‚Äôre right, I just want to know you‚Äôre right!
---
Thanks for the response man! From what I can tell, this is the best looking medic build so far bc it plays to both of its strengths, Vats (for the medic legendary effects) and charisma for the obvious healing 
---
Point is thanks a lot! Even if u don't follow it anymore!
---

---
You this game isnt your game right? PvP is still a thing in adventure mode through workshops. If you dont like it I suggest YOU play something else.
---
Greetings fellow excavator user, I would use the red headlamp on my armor since I really liked the spoopy atmosphere it creates at night, IF I COULD!(beth, I know you're busy, and I'm happy to wait, but pls gimme different lamps for X-cavator pls)
---
I noooooooo! I feel your pain, my friend. :(
---
Oh shit I guess I forgot to pick one up at the taxidermy office! Thanks compadre :-)
---
It a game it don't have to male since
---
You care that I know you don‚Äôt care because you actually do care. That‚Äôs what I think, if you‚Äôre really concerned about it. I think you‚Äôre pathetic.
---
Everyone is talking about how people hated the game because it was different from other Fallouts. Uhhhhh no I hated it because it was full of bugs and I blue screened constantly.
---
Yee I'm pretty sure
---
I‚Äôve heard certain servers seem to have a higher legendary rate and I‚Äôm inclined to believe it. Some servers there‚Äôs nothing but once in a while I‚Äôll find a server loaded with 3 Star legendary‚Äôs...., and they drop drills because that‚Äôs my luck. But yeah I have every reason to believe some servers have a higher spawn rate
---
I run with 4/5 Armor pieces with reduced ammo weight. Putting on bandolier rank 2 shaves 6 lbs off. I am the bullet farm.
---
This is part for the course for them,they have always released buggy shit.The modding community has been fixing their single player games for years.Now they have a persistent world they have to maintain...and the fact is,They just suck at it.How stupid is it for modders to have to make a mod to switch the buttons back around on the scrap confirmation window??Total and utter incompetence.Theres bugs in this game that go all the way back to fallout 4,you honestly think this is gonna get better?...lol.Every bug they "fix" they introduce 5 more, bring back old bugs already "patched".Sadly this he will always be a shit show until private servers are released and make dders can fix it with community patches.
---
Have a cooler that keeps your meat fresh longer but not as long as a fridge. That would be cool.

Bright followed by red tactical. All the others are for screenshots.

My experience involved three goddamn scorchbeasts descending on the event and all the other players fucking right off. Event failed. Again.
---
Here's a little tip I just found out myself yesterday. While I was looking for tarberries I found myself in need of boiled water. So while looking for tarberries near watogas filthy river, I just kept spamming the "r" key to get dirty water. I thought I would have around 50 or so dirty waters because of how slow the process of gathering water from the water pump was. Turns out after moving so much while pressing the r key I gathered 500+ dirty water... Keep in mind I spent less then 5 minutes walking around in watogas dirty filthy river.
---
Completely agree with you on this, but this weird they made it longer to repair at a workbench despite the repair kit not needing one.
---
So I've messed around with this a bit, the big problem is that you can chem stack on any build. Junkies benefits from addictions, sure however if any build took the same "chem cocktails" they would still have higher dps plus they don't have to worry about the downsides. It's just all upside for anything else. 
---
Anyway, here's a five chem suppression cocktail. Order matters so figure out that too.  
---
https://imgur.com/a/lBYPjxY
---
That link just proves that you can have 5 addictions and suppress them all at the same time. Think of it as a hint, you'll get the rest.
---
Baiting is in the game ;) Rose gives you an explosive master baiter.
---
I'm really big on black and blue, so having a matte black X01 with blue headlamps is my dream look.
---
ICE TO SEE YOU
---
I wouldn't care if there wasn't the extra 1/2 second or so of lag between input and response.
---
Actually, I would care, but it wouldn't be quite so irritating.
---
I use a red headlamp and couple it with woodland camo X-01... Predator Suit design. I personally like the red because it's able to light up areas without taking away from the ambience of a dark room or the woods at night
---
Does explosive cryo still freeze?
---
It really helps against the SBQ as well.
---
This happened to me a few hours ago. Rip my junk. I've never had an infinite loading screen in this game until today, and I've played since beta.
---
That annoys me *every time* still also.
---
 It's already coming, you're playing an online game, suck it up. If they couldn't damage camps then you could trap other players with no escape options, you could build road blocks at map choke points, hell, even just the white springs turret towers other players would have no option but server hop. 
---
Having your camp bombed into the dirt is less game breaking than having to quit and rejoin because somebody made the great wall of whitespring.
---
How about when you go to try to trade with a robot vendor and instead draw your weapon out...
---
Ouch that too would make me mad.
---
i use purple on my T60
---
This is bethesda were talking about
---
Sorry i shouldve put an /s
---
Consider your self lucky then chief
---
Right! E for our stash, R for everything else
---
I didn't realize that wasn't just how it was now. Its happened to me every single time since the update, had no idea it was a bug.
---
so having 1 purifier vs 3 doesnt change the rate of production? what the fuck??
---
Hoping they add Scaffolding like minecraft when they do so we can get to those tricky spots.
---
This, plus the "news" screen when opening the game have made my gaming experience worse, even if they are small changes, it screws our muscle memory.
---
Wait what? Why? I'm a new player and I put my base on the golf course around there so I could fast travel to the shopping mall for free. Not sure if anything spawns within shooting distance of my spot though.
---
Oh and dont forget that to open your stash you have to use E , not R as always.
---
Heavy Weapon builds should have:
---
1. Heavy repeater of choice (.50 Cal, Gatling, Gatling Laser, Plasma Gatling)
---
2. Missile Launcher with Quad Barrel and Targeting Computer mods attached.
---
(Aggros the SBQ on you when she flies away, makes that fight go faster because she will come land directly in front of you)
---
3. Cryolator (for putting the big nasties on ice)
---
Happens to me too, hope they revert workbenchs back the way they were before this patch and we wouldn't have that problem anymore.
---
 Praise the overseer
---
Yeah WV is a shithole. I‚Äôve lived here almost my whole life (live in a city called Fairmont a few minutes away from Morgantown). The cities are decrepit, the rural communities are awful (especially after that flood). The only areas that are nice are the very few suburbs, but other than that this place is plagued with poor infrastructure, but our government doesn‚Äôt have the economy it needs to aid in development.
---
I would definitely recommend to outsiders to visit, not move to, West Virginia
---
They are team leader's active quests
---
I guess: is the Red Headlamp *actually* effective at lighting up whatever you're looking at up close? The default Headlamp (again, for the Excavator Power Armor) causes a flat white-out of your target. Great for exploring, god awful at anything within 5 meters.
---
I"ve been wondering this myself. I have a tse cryolater and a tse tesla, not sure if they do anything other than explosive damage
---
Good to know, I was using rifles until a few days ago when I got a nice gatling gun. Decided to give it a try and regret nothing. I've been experimenting with all the different heavies since then, so I'll have to keep this list in mind.
---
Oh, I hadn't thought of using artillery. I put my base right at the closest point I could to the sheepscrotch event. Didn't even think to build artillery
---
I hope they do this but this would require resources for someone to program the animations needed so its unlikely they will be doing it anytime soon unless we up this post more!
---
More grinding.
---
Where does this take place and what the hell is conduit?
---
If you are on ps4 maybe I could add you and you could shoe me in game?
---
I want a dead cat one like the ones in the crazy cat lady‚Äôs house were all the cat bowls areüòä
---
I've never had an issue with it since it isn't as bright of a light
---
PS4, I bought the fixer plan off a guy here for 1200 caps. Another guy offered it to me for 4000. Since the sheepsquatch is part of the game now, where this plan can be readily obtained and farmed, I don't see this plan skyrocketing in price. But likewise, since the event has a barrier to entry, it makes the actual event more rare. I personally value the plan between 2000 to 3500 caps. But ultimately supply and demand will dictate the price.
---
Poor in the south is different from being poor in the north. It's terrible.
---
I was pissed when they didn‚Äôt include Huntington, Wheeling, Fairmont, or Elkins
---
Fairmont would be cool with all the bridges, and Elkins would be nice because they could‚Äôve had something similar like the fasnacht festival but for the Forest Festival
---
As for Huntington it would be nice to of had Marshall University
---
Yeah.  So etimes the entire ammo bench won't even work at all.
---
Depends on what you're looking for, really?
---
Also. Tip for those traveling from out of the area. Call it appa-latch-uh you'll get a warmer welcome in a lot of places.

I've been using the Missile Launcher lately in SBQ fights for testing that and it's never let me down.  Only problem I have is running out of missiles
---
I'm sorry! I have my ex bfs Xbox not ps4 üòï
---
My experience has been:
---
Spawn in.
---
No one doing anything productive, so I've gotta grab all 3 pylons.
---
Sheepsquatch is vulnerable, everyone else is still doing fuck all.
---
I die because I've gotta solo the Sheepsquatch while taking constant damage from all 3 pylons.
---
My game crashes as soon as I respawn.
---
I'm sorry! I have my ex bfs Xbox not ps4üòï
---
If you're on ps, I'll build you as many as you can gather mats for.
---
That wouldn‚Äôt be bad, like a rain barrel camp item
---
If you do one of the power plant events and get it running you can claim the workshop and it has a fusion core processor. It takes 100 power to get it running.
---
Churns one out about every ten minutes or so.
---
Take over a power plant
---
I've never had enough ammo to test it
---
Meh hard to tell, after announcement  they making adventure mode players unable to damage other players camps a lot players destroyed my camp near the monorail to try and get me to pvp.
---
All good.
---
My bad. I submitted a suggestion titled  ‚ÄúHow to improve inventory simulator while operating alcoholism simulator: add superfluous button clicks and mask information‚Äù
---
If your going to sling Flux, you gotta have bodyguards man.  Every dealer knows this.
---
Yes! I‚Äôd love to talk with you about your thesis. I‚Äôm an English professor doing a related project.
---
This. I have a bloodied HW build. My 50cal does damage to it while it‚Äôs cloaked. I might as well; I can‚Äôt afford to be a pylon with the health drain.
---
Where in the bog.. Im looking rn
---
Yaaassssss!
---
I use them so slow I get a bunch saved up. I'm now mainly out of power armor son I get even more.
---
I dont even use radx anymore and i usually sell it to venders along with other chems that i find in the world unless its psycho or grape/berry mentats
---
I love the larger magazine mod.  No real disadvantage with it at all.  Just means having to reload less often.
---
I farm lead ore with my excavator armor at the lucky hole mine. My camp is near an acid deposit and built an extractor to get acid to smelt the ore. I farm steel by killing super mutants and other enemies and scrapping their weapons with the scrapper perk equipped to make steel.
---
You can make batches of 180 rounds for the gatling gun with ammo smith equipped and even more with super duper.
---
Best gun for everyday use for a heavy weapons build. I also have a 50 cal, but I set it aside for the queen. I make ammo for it as resources permit.
---
If you‚Äôre in xbox I can set you some
---
The perk that gives up to 30% chance to produce two of anything you craft/cook/smelt/ etc.
---
Nice
---
I've collected every teddy bear several times now because I keep forgetting you can't display shit yet. 
---
Irritating as hell.   I want a line of teddy fears over my bed dammit.
---
You have to shoot at the feet. Splash damage  makes demo expert work great in combo w enforcer (cripples them they do they stay stationary).
---
You can produce them at power plant workshops... Also you find them a lot at higher levels.

I come across them by wandering around. I just unloaded 10 onto a level 25 yesterday.
---
I love quad weapons. Quad gauss and quad lever are what I use.
---
Enforced is the key. It crippled. Aim for a wing.
---
Ya I'm on xbox. I've seen a couple of normal pieces of armor but I've never seen a legendary one. Curious how u get them
---
I'm on the other side of the savage divide, I set up camp next to a behemoth spawn (far enough away that I don't have to fight him if I don't want to). I've had a grand total of 2 scorched attacks, a singular supermutant, and 2 wolves.
---
The savage divide is actually the safe divide tbh.
---
Fuck that.  They need to revert and leave ws the fuck alone.  
---
It's literally the only fun thing to do in this game.
---
But if you use repair kits it's not a problem! Only $19.99 per kit in the Atomic Shop!
---
Its about turrets being used to tag targets at the whitesprings clubhouse to get loot from them since most players use it for EXP and don't like to compete with turrets so as long as you don't have turrets at your BASE that can hit inside the clubhouse your camp is fine.
---
You kill legendary enemies or complete events to get loot drops for the legendary items, bos is a mod for combat armour you‚Äôll have to find the plans or someone that offers mod services to mod them up
---
I used to take the time to build a big camp. Multiple rooms, stories, and buildings, etc all decorated appropriately. I eventually got tired of it being ruined, so now my camp is nothing more than a wooden platform with crafting stations situated next to a cliff-side and guarded by many, many turrets. Seems to work a little better that way, plus even if it does all get razed to the ground, it only takes a minute to rebuild a platform and some defenses.
---
P R O T E C T  A N D  S E R V E
---
It's fucking Irritating as hell for farming.
---
That makes complete sense. How about fixing mats so that can't happen BSG?!
---
Yep steel cased wolf shit lol
---
Its just luck based, some players are bored with lack of content or the grind and find trashing other players camps fun or easy way to try and force someone into pvp especially when they destroy your decontamination showers.
---
Ah ok that's cool. Didn't know it was a mod. Could I possibly get a legendary one from the technical data or line in the sand and such?
---
If you have the caps, buy a tse. They're still available and it changed my game. I struggled until I saved my caps for my precious shotty.
---
Yeah, this change to make way for repair kits sucks angus.
---
Which vendor did you get it from? Or was it from another player?
---
I would advise find an unpopular place to camp, my camp near monorail location is trashed a lot since its a really common spot thanks to the junk pile near it.
---
You‚Äôll be able to show your vending machine on map by powering it  :)
---
You‚Äôre best bet would be the monster mash event as it‚Äôs a armour loot event as long as you‚Äôre ok against level 62 ghouls
---
was going to comment this exact thing lol, glad I‚Äôm not the only one who knows about that place
---
I also get good combat armour drops from scorched earth the sbq fight
---
Love me the dual bar chainsaw.
---
I accepted your friend request.
---
It's a heavy weapon if that's what you mean.
---
It was datamined. Since Camps with vendor stalls are gonna be visible on the map, they're making them invincible to player damage.
---
Oh ya no worries lol I'm almost in the 160s. Just getting bored of farming the same spots and I've seen that armor sell for alot so I figured I'd figure out how to acquire it and roll the dice a little.
---
Well, China in Fallout WAS running extensive espionage cells in America......almost to the extent they are today in real life.
---
You know what killed the sheepsquatch... The Ice Age
---
Oh I see, good to know, thanks!
---
Curious why boiled water is an issue? If you have water purifiers that go in water then you have water anyway. If rads are an issue there is a hazmat suit on top of posidon energy plant next to charleston, you can just stand in the watter and spam collect until you have desired amount. For me it's usually 200 dirty water converting to 100 boiled water. I also always have lead belly 3 equipped so rads from eating aren't really an issue.
---
If it's because you have too much purified water then I suggest selling it as it's worth a lot of caps.
---
Ok cool does it also scale off the full auto perks?
---
The fedora pairs well with the dirty tan suit. Combined with Cannibal you could have a Hannibal lecter at the end of Silencne of the Lambs thing happening.
---
Selling ammo would be overpowered imo. Even one cap per is broken, think how much .38 you might have. Selling fusion cores though, I could get neun d
---
I read a book called "The Glass Castle" and a significant portion of it takes place in Welch, West Virginia and the description of life there in (I think) the 1970s was extremely rough and sad.
---
I did not know it! That's great but I would like to have a location for CAMPing it would be very cool
---
Having a quad barrel tends to do that, I stick to use it as a backup and hit up molemen for spare missiles if I feel like it.
---
The bos plans spawn at the raider camp with the arena on the armour work bench, keep in mind if you go to find it do not pick up the plans until you‚Äôve found the plan you want or it won‚Äôt spawn for you for 24 hours also the bos plans are rumoured to be returning to vendors this patch
---
Sadly, in our representative democracy voters tend to get the government they deserve.  And that comes from someone in an area even more fucked over by politicos than WV.
---
Ive got the ones that go on the ground not the in water ones. I have decided to basically spend the first 10-20 min that I play tonight gathering water.
---
These will be greatly useful, I have 15 strength and 5 levels of strong back with most of the weight reduction perks, and as soon as I have a couple weapons and power armor peices in my inventory I'm overencucumbered
---
You might find some of the info here helpful  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bcvvmy/encryptid\_event\_solo\_guidetips/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bcvvmy/encryptid_event_solo_guidetips/)
---
Kind of funny how this game gives you the same emotions as being in a failing marriage.
---
It would be fine if we could actually PvP. Having someone show up and them oneshoting everyone with no chance to retaliate is no fun.
---
I was thinking with the armor rack hopefully other players wouldn't be able to waltz up and take it off the rack lol
---
Ha 90% of what‚Äôs in your inventory/stash was taken off of dead bodies
---
Ahh I see, to be honest you only need about 5 minutes to last you a while, or I do at least. A large stockpile will probably do you good. Good collecting my friend
---
Brb studying this
---
Only 1000 atoms for the simplified menu

Seriously.

Ah ok ty
---
Thought it had to be just me, like 6 steps per repair.
---
Toothy man mask?
---
Yeah, we're doing family trip there this or next year.
---
Just got some. Are you online?
---
Lemme know when you‚Äôre on
---
Marine tactical helmet: (3)rubber (1)plastic (1)glass and use max super duper
---
This would be amazing, the bottom floor of my camp is completely inaccessible to anyone but me (keypad entry doors) and has all my crops, junk extractor, and water purifiers, but when someone FTs to my camp they spawn inside of the locked area downstairs, and i have to enter the code just to let them out, not to mention they can take anything they want while they‚Äôre down there.
---
Totally agree :)
---
Well yeah it seems annoying to peep at that Sheepsquatch when she's running in circles around the house
---
Your welcome!
---
It‚Äôs silly. Bethesda can‚Äôt just not do stuff because someone might be an alcoholic. Hell, should I be offended because my pet rat died and the game forces me to kill rats?
---
üëç
---
If PvP is ever going to be done right, then upon death ALL inventory items should be dropped. Don't want to lose that op duped weapon, don't use it. Risk it all or go play something else.
---
&gt; narcissistic assholes 
---
Well, to be fair, you just described the average griefer. :P
---
Do you have to buy the game again to set up a mule?
---
Thanks.
---
Thats sucks. I've got about 500 last night and was not sure if its worth grinding 5k, I guess not.
---
Nope.  There aren‚Äôt as many quests or events as there should be, but there‚Äôs enough to get you to 50 so long as you also commit to exploring the entire map.
---
An asshat that wants you to buy a repair kit that‚Äôs who.  Someone that shitty probably has a name like Todd.
---
Yeah, I just had a fat man, and a small stock pile of mini nukes I'd been saving gathering  dust in my stash. So when I saw scorched earth event go off I was just like, "Well might as well.". Worst mistake I've made in a while.
---
Yeah, makes you wonder what VaultTec was really thinking would happen after filling a vault with what are essentially griefers. A last bad joke on the world?
---
It‚Äôs really sad. Handmade is the absolute king now
---
My only complaint of WV is how damn difficult it is to get Sudafed. After 5 different pharmacies they finally took pity on my partner and I and let us purchase it without a prescription. Its a lot cheaper than back home though.
---
Thing is, if they would have just given a timeline like every other game out there... like your 24 hour ban 72 hours, 30 day ban or perma ban I personally wouldn't have a issue with it. Played a lot of other games where people cheated , exploited , ect and were soft banned and got another chance. Bethesda however just left a when we decide to delete the items, delete the character or perma ban you.. then said your account would be released in a future patch.. Kinda like saying .. when we lose all our customers and are in dire need of money we will lift the bans.  ok maybe not but it's ok to believe it. those weight issues were dealt with already with the you cannot sell, trade, drop, pick up or use anything until you delete items to the legal limits.  on the Feb 14th patch they said they deleted the duped items down to 1 duped item per person or something like that.. Sooo.. release the accounts.. if someone is hoarding 1500 lbs of aluminum, let them use or sell it.. big deal really.. even if they make 25k off it, they will spend that and it will be gone from the game. I know people that were inadvertently banned for picking up a bulk item after seeing a bag of crap laying on the ground using the R key and R to get all... not really even noticing the ammounts they just picked up until they tried to move. oh I know the nay sayers but that is ok.. I saw it happen to at least 1 friend. A 70 year old lady that was pretty clueless what happened and dropped the items.  any rate I'm not writing a book to bring out hate and trolls. I believe people have a right to screw up and learn from it. they should be given a second chance... this isn't real life folks, but these are real life people.
---
+40% swing speed and 3* martial artist has yup swinging a sledgehammer like a combat knife. I love it. I picked up a junkie‚Äôs sledge with 40% swing speed for 69 caps at one of the Whitesprings vendors.
---
Yes they did
---
Thankfully they don't have an Atomic symbol next to them.
---
Honestly, I see that as a "Pro" not a "Con."  Server-hopping to farm isn't really fun, immersive or the intended method to play the game.  Fallout 76 isn't supposed to be your standard MMO that's all about the grind, it's a Fallout game which is meant to be immersive.  I get that it's a thing people do but the more they create barriers that make it harder, the less people will do it and then the less that will be something necessary to do in order to keep up with the in-game economy.
---
Not that I‚Äôm aware of.  Mine increases with heavy gunner :)
---
I‚Äôll try farming for the handmade then. Oh boy, here‚Äôs to a life time of farming lol. are explosive legendaries still even worth farming?
---
Speaking of autostim and life saving, how do those stack if u have multiple pieces?
---
Unless it's been recently changed the max server population is 24.
---
To be fair there have been a lot of datamined things that haven't happened yet.
---
Bruh.. U kno the risks
---
They have the protect part down, but apparently their serving game could use some work.
---
Truth, last time I crashed out of the SBQ fight right after it died. Incredibly frustrating.
---
True
---
I dumped about 8 today, they're everywhere.
---
They did for sure but be prepared to be downloaded but all the people that say has to do with RNG. It's not it's Bethesda being dicks as usual.
---
I get that.  I think this may have been added and intentionally excluded from patch notes so that it didn't cause an uproar when it didn't work 100% of the time.  I'd like to see it implemented so that when you crash you go back to the same server, but when you "quit to menu" it gives you the option to "avoid previous world" or something like that.
---
A.  There are NPC‚Äôs.  How many named robots did you encounter?
---
B.  Lvl 35 isn‚Äôt advanced, so it‚Äôs irrelevant.
---
C.  You went after Ganon without your sword of power, then quit because it was too tough.
---
Never vendor a SS weapon. If you have the patience for real people, they sell for a lot.
---
I've had a few endless loading screens as well since the most recent patch.  Wonder if these things are related?
---
I heard that it's being renamed to Jita in an upcoming patch.
---
Build base of nothing but artillery... you can fit 16 artillery just fine ;) They'll fire in sequence for extra mayhem
---
Almost feel like ditching all my rifles because they all weight 20+ lbs! I'll take my 1-2lb heavy weapons (with perks) everywhere.
---
I‚Äôm super casual and not really worried about rolling in caps. If I find anything worth selling I‚Äôd consider it.
---
4: Endangerol syringer to debuff her
---
5: Optionally tesla rifle to hit everything
---
Ok, buddy.
---
I've rented the game twice this last month because I don't have the money at the moment to buy it outright. The first time, I ran into a guy around level 140 who gave me a nice weapon and lots of ammo for it. He invited me to a team and helped me out with whatever quests I was on. I don't have a mic, and he was super patient about me typing everything to him in messages. 
---
I rented it again about 2 weeks later, and that same guy messaged me almost immediately asking if I wanted to party again. He ended up giving me a ton of blood packs and more ammo. He did the same for a bunch of other people we came across. 
---
I don't know when I'll be able to buy the full game, but I hope I can one day and repay him. Super nice dude.
---
Hope you enjoy this one star drops.
---
If you'd enjoy playing it, it would not be useless.
---
As I understand, bos progression will get you closer. Strangely, I think I would now be able to launch one despite not having completed Rose's questline. Apparently there are multiple ways to progress in the story.
---
Where'd you got it!? I've been trying to get this mod for months /sad
---
Oh yeah for sure. AA is the way tho
---
bethesda logic.
---
Nice!
---
You would be right not to believe it, since according to a [datamine from a few months ago](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19ZhGrawX03LlZtS9smKLqcC2LT875f5V_qPFefn79OM/edit#gid=0) it does not exist. Unless bethesda decided to suddenly add it in the last two or three updates, it still does not exist.
---
All my point was that all the challenges being related to alcohol were an annoyance. They don't need to have EVERY ONE that way. Thankfully they're getting away from it.
---
Still, your analogy is awful, because a pet rat dying is part of life, but people do suffer daily from alcoholism. I'm not saying they shouldn't do anything; all I said originally was that it was a bit much.
---
can i ask here that people don‚Äôt wear the impostor sheepsquatch outfit TO the event? it‚Äôs frenzied enough, if i see something that looks like a sheep i‚Äôm gonna shoot it or chase after it and hit it with a hammer why distract or make people waste damage on you
---
Got a 1 star wood arm
---
This has happened since launch...
---
sounds like the reds got this one too.
---
I let the riflemen use the Endangerol barrel lately, those 3 weapons are enough for me to bring to that fight. But yes those are excellent tips.
---
Take all 3 power plants for a few hours.
---
Same thing happened to me. I tagged the sloth with 1-2 bullets but the yaoguai killed the sloth and I didn't get the credit. Which is weird because I was able to loot his corpse... I think we have to do the killing blow to get credit?
---
I assume you can mule on a single account, you'd just need a friend to help transfer.
---
Use power user perk for added fusion core life
---
No, you can do one every 5-10 seconds, and still be fine. Actually one every 2 seconds is fine... just don't spam dig them..
---
I played around with it for my second play through.   The problem is the bullet sponge that higher end mobs are.   That being said I got a TSE 10mm and it felt rather viable except for end game content such as SBQ, etc.   pistols lack the punch you need for the harder stuff even with all the cards
---
That is so lame. I averaged around 400-500 candy per time so I did this event at least 11 times and that is the reward? I can get that for killing some rando non-star legendary enemy. Just super frustrating
---
What is AA?
---
My wife and I have been collecting them for a while and digging them up while recording the results.  When I have everything compiled and summarized I‚Äôll provide my results here as well.  She has learned a ton of weapon/armor mods out of it and gotten at least 25 of the single action revolver ivory grips, hahaha.
---
i‚Äôve done ‚Äúcall for help‚Äù and watched people run over to me and i think they‚Äôre going to stimpak me but they just wait for the timer to expire and grab my bag
---
Was he guys gt snakethefatkid if your on Xbox ??
---
They're already extremely good against robots, and they have a LOT more aoe radius than the other explosives.
---
I used to live just near Burning Mountain, in Wingen, New South Wales. The small national park it sits in was just a couple of kilometres away. There's no burning visible from the outside because the seam is right down beneath the substrate. The local pub, however, used to have framed on the wall old-timey ads for medicine made from Burning Mountain coal tar.
---
I got two accounts and way back before they nerfed them I stockpiled them en masse
---
 Ah. I was afraid of that.. that sucks because I like the feel of the single action :/
---
Also the Excavator, we haven‚Äôt had many paints for those
---
Why doesn't it end well, the robots are a minimal threat, I farm sentry bots for power cores all the time.
---
hmm.. how about 
---
Neanderthal - +3 STR, +3 END, -4 INT, -4 Charisma, Too dumb to read shared perk cards and cannot benefit from them (cannot be used with egg head)
---
My 2 unyeilding leather armor disagrees.

The imagery is perfect. Super mutants are perfect enemies to carry shields too.
---
But it does nothing for limb damage
---
There's literally no advantage to riflemen bringing endangerol. They don't benefit from damage (really, 1 damage isn't going to go up from perks), and they don't get reduced weight from riflemen perks.
---
If you are boss hunting, bring endangerol. Simple as that.
---
Yeah, I've been meaning to grab one to do some more testing, but that's pretty much how I understand/remember it. A lot of folks have trouble with them, because they shoot them straight at an enemy, or downwards from above, or use vats (which goes back to shooting directly), which makes them split pretty much immediately, resulting in having a bad time.
---
The whole thing could use work.  It's all very frustrating trying to do anything other than make a box house on a flat area.
---
You can trigger them, and players can trigger them. Walk away immediately, ideally backing away from them as you place them.
---
Gotta love the engaging PvP of one shots
---
identical stars/features?
---
I think most people that quote LP are at least aware that it's over the top. But maybe I'm just around more discerning folk.
---
Are you talking about Centralia?
---
Oddly enough, I saw that suggested in the ‚Äúofficial hint book‚Äù someone gave me...  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Although it sounds like where they have the camp setup may have a lot to do with getting blasted daily.
---
1 star, level 50.
---
Definitely nerfed.
---
The game has been extremely stale the last 5 evenings. I hope the pay 2k caps for the Encrypted event wasn't the justification for reducing legendary spawn rates
---
you can only drop 2 mines?? anymore than that they exolodes straight away
---
Not really communist China is5ge antagonist in tone of Cold War movies
---
Hopefully you can flag your vendors on the map or it's going to be hard to sell anything.
---
PS: Workshops have their own material budget. When the text is green, it is using from the workshop materials, not your stash. 
---
It is possible to power up and connect most/all of the extractors for free, once you have contractor. Cheaper still if someone powers up the power plants.
---
Oh yes 1 star is easier to find identical ones, I was thinking 2-3.
---
That one is really good in my opinion. Its a solid upgrade for a good portion of players solo, or those who don't team with chr builds. But with the dungeons coming out the drawback makes you think what you might lose in those high level co-op events.
---
I hear you on that! I took pleasure from farming legendaries, and then selling them on the market subreddit. With the decreased legends I find myself just mindlessly killing stuff for nothing haha
---
Turn on subtitles
---
Lol it was in my build menu the other day. Check again. Not sure if it‚Äôs a glitch or not but I have one
---
Bloodied explosive
---
Mods are bugged after last patch
---
I was drunk and it took me 20 minutes to repair 3 weopons.
---
Well yeah, it‚Äôs over the top, it‚Äôs a massive death robot. But that the robot is used to critique that which it blows out of proportion (ridiculously excessive military spending and imperialism) flies over a lot of heads
---
I have found legs and chest plans at the blackwater mines camp.. not in the mines, but there is a building straight across from the one with the power armor station. in that building on the ground floor right next to the armor station there are 2 wooden kegs or wood barrels.. the plans spawn on the right hand one beside the armor station. can prolly get almost every armor mod plan from that place. only thing i havent gotten there was the dense.  if you server hop though, be sure you give the Lag fest server time to load all the items because it may look like nothing there and you stand a minute and things start to appear and disappear. as the checkpoints and server loads.
---
Oh well of course, each star added, multiplies the rarity by a large amount.
---
I think they also may have upped the likelihood that finding a fusion generator while exploring will have a full fusion core still in it, unless somebody on the server already picked it up. There one right outside of grafton that I‚Äôve often found to still have a fusion core inside of. Power armors found in the wild used to be a really good way to farm them, but now they always are only at 25% from those locations, making it basically worthless
---
That's what I was wondering it's been pissing me off as some have been working and some haven't I guess it's nice they haven't just dissapered after trying them. Have they said if there working to fix them?
---
I am from West Virginia, close to Charleston. I always tell people that it's an incredible place to visit, but a terrible place to live. I was most recently there last August for my wedding, and it was actually really depressing how fast everything there is dying, even over the last few years. Almost all of the businesses I grew up with have closed, and Charleston itself was just sad.
---
Everybody CHILL
---
I play survival on and off for the exp, and I actually didn't have much trouble with this challenge.  Seemed like most people were just trying to get it done too, and welcomed the help.  I did have people kill me a few times right when the event was over heh.    
---
The last 10 there were like 4 people playing together independently, each of us traveling to the next event when it popped up, and giving the thumbs up.
---
You're not taking me to the cooler!
---
Great for stealth builds, not really worth it for anything else IMO
---
Yes that‚Äôs why I said two similar ones are good enough for me.
---
My husband hates clowns and I want to surprise him with a clown doll at his camp!
---
It is? You mean to say Ron Perlman wasnt kidding when he said "war, war never changes"?
---
For all the people crying nerf, why did I have a run with 8 legendary ghouls at the Whitespring today?
---
Nevermind that out of those 8, I got 4 pieces of wood armor, but I did end up with a decent AA Meathook.
---
Yeah, like furious Bowie knows, combat knifes, or switchblades, seen one you seen them all.
---
Cool party.
---
That must be what's been happening. Thanks, is there a perk like Light Step that removes this threat or is it a bug?
---
Ice what you did there, pretty chill.
---
Good bot
---
That's probably from picking it up all over the place, it's a fairly common item surprisingly. If I'm not crafting a lot of chems, I can easily drink only purified water and still accumulate too many over time.
---
I often don't grab the 5 purified water sitting in my industrial water purifier because it would actually just burden me with more weight.
---
I had this exact issue for two months, I went to Bethesda Technical Support and submitted a ticket. Within a day I was playing again.
---
you are right, the buildings should be in much worse shape, there was a nuclear war for frig sake
---
No I didn't. 
---
I knew I'd drop *some* AID on death, and that's why I only carry around 10 Stems ect, but if I had 100 of an item I didn't think I'd drop them *all*.
---
You're missing chem fiend, and possibly biocomm mesh. They greatly extend the HoT effect of stims. Healing salves also work (and benefit), but have no animation. Same with foods. Feel free to stock up on glowing meat and use that to heal with too (or other foods) and hot key them. Carnivore/herbivore help with that.
---
You're missing suppressor/tenderizer, endangerol, cyrolator, and optionally tesla rifle to hit EVERYTHING. Eyebots? What eyebots? They die.
---
I also have the endless diluted stims. Just become conduite supreme, jump on the shack, and kill the boss (and everything else) after debuffing it with endangerol. Optionally hit it EVERYTHING with tesla / explosives, and boss with cryo.
---
Its pretty much gg ez once you're conduit and unkillable with endless stims on the roof.
---
Well, I have been finding around the same amount in Whitesprings, but only whitespring. Every other usual spot i hit up which usually had legends seems to be dry. Makes it less appealing for me to explore the world when I can camp whitespring :/
---
My philosophy is that I bring one kind of debuff and someone else on my team brings the other, but hey that's the advantage of having a regular team.
---
Would it be better to replace 1 point of action boy with gun fu?
---
Because this game has balance issues.
---
Yea those are pretty close. Mine is same weapon but slightly different models, like a zealots explosive minigun and a tse minigun, a one-star bloodied supersledge and a three star supersledge. The look and feel are nearly the same just specs are slightly different. Would be nice to have identical pairs but that‚Äôs very hard to come by.
---
Happened to me with core assembly for my excavator PA. As far as I know there's been nothing stated and the FO76 subs I follow are where I found out that this was an issue from the latest patch. But hopefully this gets fixed when the borrows come out on Tuesday. Hope this helped bud
---
They seem to time out and pop on their own. I tried to set up a perimeter but noticed they were all exploding
---
Agreed! I thought this was already a thing and was disappointed shortly after buying the game and playing a bit
---
I'm still looking and cant find the actual metal building set. Just metal diner doors and others like that. Vendor Phoenix, Whitesprings, server jumping all no go. I keep running around hoping to find Graham, hopefully he has one.
---
Online for a bit mate.  I tried to join you but the world was full.  Added you.  Feel free to stop by!
---
That‚Äôs the canned dog food. Same exact ingredients.
---
You're bugged out. I have 500 rounds in mine.
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs annoying, but more often than not I appreciate the free mole rat chunk/Mutt Chops delivery.
---
I would choose action boy, but I also only have used gun fu when it would still lock onto friendlies and neutrals. Haven‚Äôt gone back to it since the last update, where that was apparently changed. If you‚Äôre looking for good agility perks tho, go with adrenaline. Probably one of the best, especially when fighting large groups
---
I'm a level 33 learning the game still too can help u take out higher level enemies and drop u ammo and resources if u need...PSN Weeksauce17
---
Yep. I've been on the silos with a team. Gutsy's will float right on by me when I'm in sneak mode and go attack someone else.
---
I looked it up. It‚Äôs pretty good! Not a fan of running around with low health but not to bad if you got some sort of auto-stim. I appreciate it. Thanks!
---
Its hard to keep ammo on it though. You can't farm it off of enemies and it burns through them fast.
---
Fallout 76s loot is okay but I would have to say division 2s loot system is by far the best I've seen so far aside from Borderlands.
---
Freeze!
---
Shhhh, we're talking about Anthem. üòù
---
yes
---
Great idea! We will have this in the atom shop in NO TIME.
---
Was a plan I either got from an Event or found in the world, it's one of the few that can't be learned from scrapping.
---
Yes, but you have to be crouching for it to work.
---
There are subtitles?
---
the person who is wanted is losing the caps from their pool of caps so its not an exploit as they can only give each other caps to the value of what they have or 25k max limit.
---
Not hard to be better than pure shit, but yeah i agree
---
With the carnivore mutation though, and you don't even have to do anything, just keep killing things as per usual, and drink all the booze (zero rads), cola, and water you loot.
---
If you also use the butcher's bounty perk to search the animals you kill, you will have a steady supply of food beyond what you could eat, and probably beyond what you can sell if you don't have an extremely short play session.
---
A few things:  
---
1) When collecting a bounty, you get half the bounty as a payout, split between the team. 
---
2) If the wanted player is broke, they incur a bankruptcy penalty that lasts 4 hours and causes a 50% reduction in PvP damage for the duration. 
---
3) Any bounty collected comes out the wanted player's caps. If you have a bounty of 500, you lose 500 on death (or all of your caps if you have less). The player collecting the bounty gets 250 caps, split between the team if teamed. 
---
The only way this could be considered an exploit is it doesn't let the aggrieved player get revenge or be avenged by another player.
---
It did I appreciate it
---
o: but what if anthem pulls a 76 and gets better loot?
---
See i always find it at vendors but even with maxxed hard bargin its sril around 2000 caps
---
There's a billboard advertising it in Watoga, but Bethesda is just being a tease.
---
 Ok, please don't take this the wrong way, but those are all prime raid turf. 
---
From a dynamic play perspective, now that the game has been out for a while lets say you picked it up today. You're going to exit the vault and see ungodly high level players still living in the forest. 
---
You'll either avoid (smart) or approach (optimistic) responder players that like a nice casual experience will be handing out food and water and plans like it's candy, while raider players are wandering around being dicks. "Bloodthirsty psychopaths that terrorize Appalachia" 
---
At low level, any hostile player SHOULD give another player pause, but unlike other survival games (rust, ark, Conan, etc) you can flag to opt out, but a raider then destroying the camp in an attack works just like super mutants attacking sanctuary. You have to go home and repair the damage, and at lower level the repair cost will be basics of wood, steel, glass, maybe a bit of copper, if you've got loads of turrets then you'll be gear and oil poor and likely reduce the number of turrets, in a unique way for each player. Do you build 5 small ones for greater coverage? Or 3 in a triangle of crossfire for efficiency? 
---
At higher level players can put up much more of a fight, and the risk may not be the reward of hostility, meaning just like in the other fallouts a raider becomes less and less of a threat, but the maintenance cost of a high level base is again, higher. It pushes higher level players out of the forest for the lower maintenance cost, and creates a new dynamic, competing for prime real estate. 
---
Toxic valley has a smattering of resource nodes, low level enemies, and lots of flat open ground, even standing water for purifiers. If not for Grafton mayor its prime real estate, except for free fast travel but that's the downside. 
---
Nuka factory, helvetia around the faschnacht parade, and much of the forest are high traffic, high camp density hunting grounds. 
---
To quote Jurassic park 2. "This is a game trail, predators hunt on game trails"
---
did you tag her enough. thats the only reason.
---
It takes me everything to get 1k per day : /
---
Well once they actually make a decent world map and not bland forest everywhere, then I might consider it decent lmao.
---
You ever played a game that didn‚Äôt have subtitles ü§î
---
They're supposed to be releasing a new stronghold soon, I'm gonna check it out when It hits.
---
which vendor?
---
I made a suggestion about this a while back, it would be a great way of diversifying the boring regular, cherry and quantum we find in the wastes! 
---
It honestly makes no sense why the other variants are non-existent in the wild, excluding the WS and the frat house. Why is quantum more available than say, dark?
---
Many.
---
You're asking for something that has been officially confirmed as upcoming changes. I get that you're venting but this post adds nothing but clutter to the sub.
---
I‚Äôm gonna be trying this build out once I level the character up enough.
---
Gonna be trying a vats/bloodied pistol build, with some chems if needed. 
---

Lmao I find that hard to believe. 
---
But yes fallout has both dialogue and surroundings subtitles
---
Little trick for you hit drink at a water source then spam collect. It goes much faster and you can collect as fast as you can push it while your character is drinking. 
---
Hope this helps make it a little less tedious.
---
That's horrible.
---
Martial Artist of course. 
---
Just kidding. They changed that. Personally I think it was that way intentionally and actually made sense that faster swing speed would equate to faster cranking on the Gatling gun.
---
The term is "developmentally challenged". Whether that applies to Mary and Chelsea or to Bethesda, is up to you.
---
I know it's been a really long time since you have posted this, but now after this time what is your thoughts on mysterious savior?
---
Yep. And the nuke zone must still be active as well. 
---
The glowing ghouls and converted flora will still be there after the zone fades but the item drops won't happen.
---
Mine was like that originally, but no one ever did any damage so I expanded it a bit. It's in the forest by the river and next to low level mutant/scorched spawn who do occasional damage to my crops.
---
Blue and Red paint cans are required to repair the commie whacker. 
---
How do I know this?  I used to use the bladed variety of it to rather comical effect killing wanted players.
---
I I use a crafted Gatling plasma on occasion with rifled barrels, Prime receiver and beam focuser, does 112 dmg per shot.
---
Of course I'm running a heavy gunner vanguard build (All three heavy gun damage perk cards, maxed, Bullet shield, 3 star Stabilized and 3 star Bloody mess, one gun army.
---
It is an insanely powerful weapon, but ultracite plasma cores, so I usually don't get it out unless I'm going to be actively PvPing.
---
I would love to get my hands on a Furious or AA Plasma Gatling, just to see how nasty I could make one.
---
Sudafed is used to make meth.
---
200 atoms
---
Yeah the enemies definitely are contagious but I always stock up on innert flux or purified water before i even venture into the mire. The water there is definitely Aids
---
Especially the whole automation taken over and replacing workers but doing a shit job is too true
---
Did you try to use the launch screen?  
---
I ran into this a while back. Evidently on a previous visit to that silo I had acquired a banked card (if you put a card in but don't get to launch its saved for the next launch). It just beeped at me. A double beep every time I tried to put a card in. So I tried the launch computer and it let me target and launch (I'd already entered that silo's code that week).
---
Agreed. I‚Äôm a southern WV native and moved several years ago to a more developed and financially stable area in VA. Honestly? I miss home.
---
I'm on Xbox and no one ever even tried to damage my camp
---
It loads the whole server and then the players and then their camps and then you. How's it going to check if there's a camp on your spot in the server if it doesnt load the server and players first? What you want to happen is too complicated for Bethesda to implement, they can't even get the game updated correctly.
---
I had thought Mary was mentally ill from the way their story ended, but I hadn't considered the possibility that they both were "challenged". Would make this quest a shade darker for me. And we all know Bethesda is wayyy behind on their development
---
me:so I joined this religion and...
---
freind:Im gonna stop you right there, is it another cult?
---
me:"shows photo"
---
friend:bro where do I sign up
---
What platform?
---
This is what I did, and then lay off your caps run, be a bit more lazy, don‚Äôt stress to get the full 1400 every day.  This is actually harder now with the big pool but the idea is sound, whatever you were grinding for cash, stop.
---
Arcade cabinets including these games would be awesome, and arcade cabinets do already exist ingame as well, so they could add a little functionality to them. There are a few at Bolton Greens. It would be nice if they added unique skins to the cabinets as well for each game, but that's not entirely necessary. Could also add chairs to sit at them as well.
---
I think it actually does tell you now. I got a brief pop-up message after getting killed by the samsquanch saying "Fartknocker007 is looting your bag" or something. It was so brief I barely caught it and I'm not sure what the exact wording was. It must be new.
---
Out of all of the complaints, as a minmax farm kingpin, this is the one that honestly bothers me the most as a person.
---
I need Todd to explain the design process around this one.
---
XB. Sorry just added it to the post
---
first off, not spending 30 seconds repairing in combat IS an advantage, ESPECIALLY if it's "one hit and you lose". If you can't see that you're an idiot. Weapons don't just break outside of combat. I could be wrong on this one, but I'm pretty sure weapons take damage even if you miss your shot. No one has a 100% perfect accuracy unless they're aim-botting.
---
Second off, you apparently haven't noticed that repair kits DO NOT require you to carry the junk needed to fix the items you repair. This means you potentially have more carry weight open for loot.
---
Third off, yes they COULD sell other stuff later. But they may be less likely if they know their fanbase won't stand for them breaking their "cosmetics only" promise. Look at the canvas bags. People were absolutely PISSED and now as far as we know, they're giving those people those canvas bags (we'll have to wait til August to see if that's actually true). If we let them think selling repair kits for cash is ok, they WILL assume they can get away with worse. Hell, from what I'm hearing, I can't even in good conscience buy the Rider power armor skins I was looking forward to because someone datamined that the Plague skin comes with a helmet that applies Detect Life on everything around them.
---
Finally, the repair kits themselves aren't the issues. I'd love to see them in-game. BUT NOT as something you can pay real cash for.
---
Mar need help
---
I'll have to check that out. It's not like I'm going to go after them and try to get my loot back but I think people should hear the name of the thief so they can be forewarned!
---
Ammo's a problem if you go pure shotguns too. Shotgun shells are particularly expensive on plastic. Personally I mix in some stealth rifle for ammo saving.
---
Range vs Scorchbeasts isn't usually a problem as they fly close enough, although I would recommend carrying at least one shotgun with a long barrel and no muzzle mod.
---
This happened to me tonight, but it was aid that was eating up an extra 50ish pounds.
---
This is the pol-ice, put your hands up and snow body gets hurt.
---
Found my new hobby.
---
The overseer so I could pistol whip her for leading me on a wild goose chase and never being there
---
My analogy is not awful. The death of my dog haunts me to this day. Alcoholism is a part of some people‚Äôs lives just as the dying of a pet is. Don‚Äôt belittle my pet‚Äôs death because you think your problem is worse.
---
How about adding a few colors available in game by creating dyea out of fruit and other junk? Oh yeah, because you guys are willing to shell out money for single colors, we won't get that, we will get 100 atom paints. Good job.
---
You're the reason they're selling repair kits. Just stop with your laziness you Bethesda shill.
---
There are gun racks...
---
In Fallout 4. Not in Fallout 76 as of yet. Maybe it'll be something that gets introduced into stash box item decor.
---
Just restart your game a few times til it pops up again. This happened all the time with my main quests.
---
I‚Äôm loading up in your world, I run low health build though so won‚Äôt be much use as a conduit
---
thanks! Proud of my little train station.
---
To take this one step further, I‚Äôd like to see a setting where you could decide what takes priority: Finding a server where your camp can be placed, or joining a server that has your teammates.
---
That's pretty accurate. I experienced one additional awesome circumstance last night:
---
SHEEPSQUATCH IS VULNERABLE
---
Two hundred other robots are swarming, but the 'squatch is on break. Gone. The thing just vanished until the timer ran out. 
---
What a waste of an expensive recall card. Hey, maybe they'll start selling them in the Atom store.
---
I've been having the same issues with any brotherhood quest.
---
Ya boi just bought an explosive cryolator with the crystal barrel, and had no idea of this. 
---
Bless this post.
---
If you want to give me a few thousand caps to give you room for more, I'd be glad to help as many times as you want.
---
Kidding aside, what about a storage character?  If you want to have one that you can have online at the same time, get a second completely different account, new license.  There are ways to buy licenses from another country for $20 or less, and add them to a different account.  Once the account is activated, it can be logged in / used anywhere.
---
I mean if you'd rather not go through all that hassle you can unload 8000 caps on me... ?  ;p
---
While I agree with you, Anthem is not exactly a high bar to surpass
---
That... has no basis. The new workbench method IS related to the repair kits though. They needed a way to make it so you can repair outside of a workbench, so they did the obvious choice of linking repair to the Inspect menu and checking for repair kits. Workbench Repair is just the game saying "you have 0 repair kits so this will cost resources". They have no reason to make it so you can spend atoms instead of repair kits or materials because that is the purpose of the repair kits: to repair without resources or workbenches. It's a great idea minus being able to pay for them in real cash.
---
While you do have the option to change the headlamps on other sets of power armor, you simply can't with Excavator as the mods simply do not exist. So... you're stuck with it unfortunately.
---
It always bugged like that. Skip the transponders and just go to the final destination. To prevent any spoiler, you can look up where the final destination is from the Net.
---
I got the damage bug again while at the mainframe core step of site charlie (right before the launch room). That place is cursed, I tell you
---
thanks! I‚Äôll try that!
---
This is infact fair. As someone who shares a name with her husband I believe that makes her legally my wife tho so like maybe don't. I'll pay you.
---
rose for sure
---
Yea it's honestly not too far removed from the wasteland here in real life. The main difference is the radiation. I live just outside of Charleston, the biggest city in the state, and the roads are still littered by abandoned trailers and rotting houses on the side.
---
This is so f-ing stupid.  Sorry you got crapped on.
---
when i get close to the limit i go to a vendor to buy plans that i do not have, currently Serum plans from the Enclave and power armor mod plans. mostly to push caps into a sink, yes i know i can maybe get em cheaper from players.. but i do it anyway
---
I'm a 100+Charisma Gunslinger and I do fine end game, I'll post build. I'd drop Charisma for Crit Luck7 Per, I can half hp a SB as he crawls out after the TSE nerf but the main thing I do is clear out packs and cripple limbs. 
---
I carry a absurd amount of pistols instead of reloading, IE Single Action and other top tier weapons seem pretty viable, PVP Assassin Guns are fun too since no one knows what a gunslinger does and you do pretty good against melee boys and serendipity users because of your burst+Firerate+Limb+staggers. You can even punch through the Stimpack PA spammers

---
It would make more sense, if they just let us chop wood.
---
I'd like that. She's cool but the reveal would be a 1000000x better if she was a chill human stoner u know?
---
Yeah mines are pretty useless here. Their range is severely overreaching (in an attempt to compensate for lag) but then the timers are way too long and it just makes it almost impossible to ever hit anything. It feels like trying to hit things with the time bomb or long fuse dynamite in fallout new vegas. Not to mention you can trigger them yourself, they can glitch out and blow up, and that you can only have a max of 2 out at a time. The only thing I find mines good for is emptying vendor inventory
---
WV also had a historic flood almost 3 years ago.  The area I'm from was hit really hard, most of the kids still don't have proper schools.  That flood made a bad situation even worse, for a lot of people.
---
Lmao no clue that was 4 months ago, i have not played that game in months.
---
Lmao you‚Äôre wrong man, and you‚Äôre here for no reason spewing your useless opinion at people who couldn‚Äôt care less, you‚Äôre the definition of pathetic.
---
Can you not craft the motors or do you already have them in your inventory?
---
Maybe they reset you to a point where you can pickup the materials?
---
It‚Äôs all fucked from before. They had to change it on us.
---
The cranberry bog has a ton of camps with power armors sitting around, each one has a pretty good chance of having a core inside. You will also find them in ammo boxes from time to time. Legendary or crown enemies with gatling lasers will usually drop cores too
---
On top of that, power armor drain is incredibly slow, so unless you're getting rid of them for weight purposes or also using a gatling laser at the same time, you should always end up with a net gain in fusion cores even when traveling in power armor
---
Yes, except if you've managed to get an abundance of something even if it was previously rare, it would very likely change how you would use it.

If you suddenly have more purified water than you can even sell to vendors, it's value to yourself drops significantly.  The real question is, should it be so much more effort to get boiled water than it is to passively farm purified water? And if the superior quality water is abundant to you, why couldn't you use it wastefully?
---
Although, with a decontamination arch (to remove the rads from collecting dirty water), a stove, and a natural water source at your camp, it's easy to get hundreds of boiled water if you want it. I make like 50 whiskey at a time, and that requires 150 boiled water. It's just that boiled water takes a higher minimum effort to get, but your potential output is actually much higher than purified water. It really comes down to a storage issue.
---
I need flux!  I got a jones, man - and caps!
---
There are lots of ways to find cores, plus a perk that helps you use them more slowly.
---
GT?
---
I always got these ballsy level 1 enemies trying to walk into my camp.
---
Yes but it's not an infinite supply, after 2 extractors and a few turrets you will be using your own resources. If you need to defend from players, the limited resources the workshop comes with is next to nothing.
---
I know that. But if someone comes into a pharmacy congested and stuffed up I wouldn't think were gonna cook up some good ass meth, I would think this person is probably congested and miserable and just wants to take the straight sudafed and actually be able to breathe. No high quite as good as breathing.
---
Mine crashed the moment I clicked to read a note.  It crashed again because I dared walked forward too soon after logging in when it crashed the first time...or was that the second time?  I lost track.  I don't remember why it crashed the third or fourth time today.
---
Yes. Worth it.
---
Surething karma it it helps plz :D
---
Also, you may encounter lots of beasts on the way, so may want to equip fireproof perk. They can't really touch you with the perk on.

Gameplay loop problems

I use a purple on my t-51b, it's a pretty nice color scheme. I personally just like the way it looks, but the purple is dark enough that it never really has this glaring blaze in your eyes. I also have a red tactical on my x-01 just because the glowing eyes look cool but I've used x-01 for maybe 5 minutes out of my 300+ hours so far
---
hey thanks!
---
I don't disagree with you, but, depending on what you're cooking it is better to use that expensive stuff.
---
I wish there were a way to make purified water boiled, just the same as with making boiled water purified if you have a dogwood filter.
---
I understand the survival implications of it but when you have industrial purifiers pumping out tons of water, why would you boil down that dirty, infested, irradiated water. It is much much safer to use the purified water when cooking.
---
And avoid using VATS or Power Attack.
---
Even though it doesn't provide any additional functionality - still drains AP at the same rate - or damage what doesn't require any additional power while in regular armor (or naked for that matter) devours your core while in PA and there is no perk card that slows down the onslaught.
---
Thanks for the write-up. I save up my treasure maps until I have several per area, then knock them all out. I've found some good plans from them, stuff the vendors don't have. 
---
Lighten up your inventory before you go and bring some carry weight buffs, for sure!
---
Pretty sure magazine spawns are completely random. I tend to pass by that little radioactive shack above whitesprings pretty often and have found at least 10 different magazines there
---
Grew up and am still a resident of W.V. No offense taken. It isn't great here, economically.
---
It's funny, I thought the same but all the games academics I follow all dismiss Fallout 76 entirely. They're all big into labour politics too.
---
I was surprised that Moundsville and Wheeling weren't represented. Moundsville has the Penn and the Mound. Wheeling has a rich history as the former capital of Virginia.
---
The Silent Hill fire was based off of Centralia but they place the movie/games in West Virginia.
---
Used to have the Purple before the Headlamp changes. I had the opposite problem back then and just couldn't see *anything* with it. Swapped it back to the base light when I had had the chance.
---
Get the plague carrier mutation (forget the exact name). If you can't be healthy, let no one be healthy.
---
Mmmm. Thats what I was partially worried about. But thanks for the info. Definetly will check that out, and try my luck.
---
I disagree.  I am fine with PvP to contest workshop ownership, BUT: they need to make it so that if someone challenges the workshop, you can just let it go without going into PvP.  I want PvP to be in the game, but it needs to be completely consensual and there needs to be a way to make it fair for the people trying to take the workshop so people can't just camp on them.  I'd be glad to own workshops of I could just let them go when someone challenges them without allowing them to PvP me.

---
For me, the stuff clogging my stash turned out to be gunpowder and certain junk that doesn't bulk (asbestos, silver, etc).
---
Yeah, sadly I believe that's how it works. I recently started using a minimalist perk build to get rid of all the aid and ammo I'm hoarding, one of the perks I'm using is the one that gives an audio cue for nearby magazines. I found I think 3 holotape games this week, while I only found two in about 300 hours of gameplay before that. It's just luck, and the more magazines you find the more likely to find the one you need
---
Thank you for this suggestion!  I'll give it a try, and see if I get any results.
---
Yeah OP's post is too extreme. Simply remove the automatic PVP consent of workshops.
---
I'd use a blue if we had it, but this is the closest I can get so I'll accept it
---
‚ÄúGREAT, MORE ASBESTOS‚Äù
---
Just wanted to say thanks for convincing me to buy the game. I can't remember the last time I was actually excited to go home and play a game. I'm 27 now and thought I was just too old to have that feeling again. 
---
I'm still playing solo, too, so I figure it can only get better from here.
---
I've seen this event pop several times but haven't been tempted in the least to partake. Seems from the posts here that if you're lucky enough to have a team that knows how to bring this big bad down so that you're not leaking stimpacks like a sieve, it doesn't even overly matter because you're still getting a one star wooden appendage drop. Whoop. Dee. God. Damn. Doo.
---
Ive trashed exactly two camps, outside of joined pvp.
---
1: to get at a hiding bounty.
---
2: griefing a griefer.
---
Guy had repeatedly trashed a low level player camp. Was asked to do something about. He ran back to his camp, had a buddy wipe his bounty. I followed, Leveled it
---
But seriously, if you're going to pvp and use your base as a defensive structure, you should expect it to get torn up.
---
But torching someone's base just because you can, is probably the least creative troll in the game.
---
that would be the best scenario. some people just don't care for PVP and would gladly hand it over to avoid a fight, but there's currently no way to do so without letting yourself get killed and losing caps. It's dumb.
---
One of the new ones,.
---
Having Contractor maxed let me build quite a few extractors, turrets, and a fusion core generator while only barely dipping into my personal resources.
---
I hit the limit, then started buying every plan that looked entertaining. When the player vending patch comes out, I can craft weird junk for stock. In the meantime, I can drop marsupial serums in overseer's caches and watch the noobs bounce around.
---
Unfortunately no, I've tried everything and if you search "early warnings" in this subreddit you'll see I am most definitely not the only one with this problem.
---
If .50cal or 5mm production gets nerfed I will find you and kill you. :)
---
Besides power plants, knowing where the generators with cores in them might be and where power armors might be, I raid those every chance I get.
---
Yesterday I helped a stranger defend his power plant.  He invited me to team and let me grab some cores since he was full. I made him some missile turrets to help him defend it better after he invited me.  So try being helpful?  Try asking someone that already has one?  They might tell you to go pound sand, but they might not.

It is a way to stop the economy from breaking.

Ok first off sorry for such a late reply long day. I was mistaken in which receiver I have it is the refined not a hardened sorry here is the screen shot.

Actually the first Resort, build in 1778, must have been a bunch of cabins near the White Sulphur Spring. You can see some of them in Paradise Row, Alabama Row and Baltimore Row.
---
In 1858 the White Sulfur Springs where known beyond the region because some american presidents decided to stay there.
---
This led to the construction of the first big Hotel, the Grand Central, better know as "The Old White"
---
The construction of Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in 1873 led to even more fame and guests. The Railway bought the hotel in 1910 and added "The Greenbrier Hotel" which is the basically the central section, the Bath department with the grand Indoor Pool and the golf course.
---
In 1914 the Resort was renamed "The Greenbrier" and opened for the first time year round.
---
1922 the obsolete Old White Hotel was removed and in 1930 The Greenbrier Hotel was substantially rebuild with a new Main Entrance. Virginia Wing and the iconic North Entrance facade. The number of Guest rooms where 500 at that time.
---
In 1950 the US Government began constructing the ERC under the West Virginia Wing, which was extended at that time. The Bunker was decommissioned in 1992.
---
In August 2009 the new owner Jim Justice started construction of a casino, which opened in 2010.
---
2015 the Greenbrier Chapel was opened on the North Lawn. 
---
I¬¥m not high enough in level to look around a lot but I think both the casino and the chapel are not in the game. Not sure.
---
Yes. I think they should have seasons and no legendaries.  That would be fun.
---
or if they had level-based matchmaking
---
You get a random 3* weapon from doing max. (or at least that‚Äôs what I got). Got a PoS 3* cane. Was doing it to level and was curious. So yeah, dont waste your time. Better off just trading it for pencils - it‚Äôs what I strted doing after that.
---
While mildly dismaying, I do appreciate the answer. Guess I'll have to keep my fingers crossed, then. Sticking with the Excavator set for a good while to come, what with its (still) bugged +100 Carry Weight and rather fantastic Bone Raider skin.
---
There's a Heavy Weapon Stand near the new Event Location, in the shack.
---
Haven't seen them elsewhere yet, but I'm still looking for other types too.
---
You can craft Nuka Dark, the plan drops from biv
---
I got a 1* leather left arm. I would have been somewhat okwith a crappy 3* at least then maybe it could turn out helpful with the legendary vendor. This 1* crap I could literally get anywhere
---
Oh look another one.
---
No they haven't. I've had servers where whitesprings was bare bones empty and servers loaded with legendaries all within the last week.
---
Doesn't affect energy damage whatsoever. Kinda disappointing tbh.
---
Can you place the cabinet down somewhere else, put your stuff on it, select the cabinet in edit mode and move it where you want it? (I don't use cabibets, but thus works for other things.)
---
Cryolator can freeze new boss.
---
Two shot anti-armor? Is it even possible to have those on the same gun??
---
Actually, I noticed something. I'm sure it was tested, it had to be right. So, I noticed that the stats won't disappear every time. Its seems like if I repair quickly after inspecting, the stats remain.
---
So it comes down to the problem of testing like a tester, and not a player. Because the tester wants to get things done quickly, they wouldn't see this bug.
---
I loved recon sensors when I did PvP in my PA. The tags remained regardless of what weapon I used, I could use red dots, and the tags didn't disappear on respawn so I could keep track of anyone in range. 
---
My only complaint is it would also tag friendlies.
---
Cheers mate, appreciate the intel.
---
I'll take the power plant workshop, skip the annoying powering up event, and just slap a fusion generator down to make cores.
---
Did you get my pm?
---
You're a hero! thank you
---
Still have zero failed attempts, I read everything then followed the steps. It's really just mechanics, please do not get this slightly tedious boss fight a nerf. Although I will say after farming it many times the past few days , the loot seem like very little hit and a whole lot of miss . How many wolf fedoras can one possibly need, should of at least been more rare. But last night I got a bunch of pa mod plans.
---
The workshops with water labeled will run that many purifiers.
---
Now it does. Originally the 16 base damage made it nothing but a way to get rid of excess 308. 
---
The Prime mod for it is essential though. Making 86 rounds per batch as opposed to 21 makes using it bearable, the only extra cost being a piece of UC and fluorescent flux (which WS is overflowing with)
---
Have you started?
---
Bump, still wanting pals
---
griefers are getting bad
---
I think it can also use .38 but not sure.
---
Works flawlessly with better inventory! Thanks!
---
wait, this game has mines?
---
Fully agree
---
I can get you your fix... but it‚Äôll cost you...
---
Nah they are going for the gauranteed money route,not everyone will buy paints,because they really aren't required.But....if you nerf repair perks ,increase the decay rate of weapons and armor and introduce instanced dungeons with special loot.You now have a need and the perfect vehicle to drive sales of repair kits.Com'on guys it's really not to hard to see what they are doing.This has probably been in the works from the start.It wasn't "feedback from the community" that made these materialize....just,LOL.
---
Yes, they freeze!
---
Another one? So I assume people were making threads about this? I rarely use this sub-reddit so if people were observing usual spots with less legendaries, I'm sure something is up. Like I said, whitesprings will always practically have 1-2 legendaries. The issue is that other usual legendary spots, are dry. Spots that usually had at least 1 legendary every route; notably Watoga, Watoga Municpal Center, Gulper Lagoon, etc. I've had really bad luck there all week and i play several hours per day. The only guranteed spot is Whitespring but that gets extremely boring farming over and over.
---
It used to be. Now it does somewhat respectable damage. With a heavy build its quite useful, especially if you get an AA, Furious, or Bloodied one.  Even a 1* makes a huge difference. 
---
Priming it also helps with ammo production and increases its damage a fair amount.
---
Fuck toy
---
There are two possible spawns at that location. Behind the shop's counter and in the shack out in the back. Using the perk card to find magazines by audio clues also helps to pinpoint where they spawn. Up to three to four possible spawns possible at the Sons of Dane compound as well. Underneath or on top of the north west gate tower, inside the basement of the home, or in the Buck's Den Taphouse.
---
So, has there been a reason listed for the player cap limit? Duping is the only thing I can think of. I get making the vendors have limited caps, but the players? Seems a bit overkill.
---
&gt; depending on what you're cooking it is better to use that expensive stuff
---
Not necessarily these days, most wineries use price as a marketing tool rather than an indication of quality. source: Used to work in wines.
---
That in on itself is considered a late game item and still has the ability to break in canon. Remember, this is the universe where the actual currency is determined by having purified water (caps)
---
Well, someone bought foreclosure on the cheap in Detroit.
---
You're probably gonna want tank killer. 
---
Also you have a ton of utility perks you probably could replace with more combat perks. 
---
Also if you're worried about hit points take put 1 point from agility, move it to endurance and get level 4 lifegiver its equal to 9 levels of hp. It'll take you fron 260 to 310hp.
---
Briefed?
---
What intel did you get during the briefing?
---
Perception/Refractor- energy resistance perk is big help against sheepsquatch impersonator (assaultron) currently.
---
Yeah I didn't think they'd make sense either, but the force from a nuclear blast would destroy buildings. But also the Overseer talks about how disappointed she is in the dwellers for securing the silos and using them too. So that explains why the buildings would fall into a worser state if we're dropping nukes too.
---
At the cap....cap now would be the time to be a completionist and by all the plans off the vendors.
---
We shall agree to disagree. You may see it as something akin to a spin-off (and for the record I do believe that was their intent), but The product currently feels like it is Fallout 4 with a ton of stuff stripped away in favor of adding some light multiplayer aspects.
---
Go buy a Serum plan, you‚Äôll have room for more caps in no time.
---
Good for you, stay strong! It's only a couple atoms anyways, no big deal. I'm not an alcoholic but I'm definitely sick of the excessive alcohol challenges. Honestly though, I have more fun with the game when I ignore the daily quests anyways, unless they're super easy / something I'd do anyways.

if you plant your plants first then put a mat down and move the plant on the very edge of the mat yo can pick up the mat and move it inside

I went bright but have since gone back to default. Bright was too bright and I had to intentionally look away from what I actually wanted to see to prevent it from being washed out. I'd like to find blue for my X01 but have had no luck yet.
---
No, they are both Main effects.
---
Finally got calibrated shocks for my x01 and can‚Äôt even use. Anyone found a fix for this or heard anything about a fix coming? Pretty awful bug that is affecting a lot of ppl it seems.
---
Did a search for pictures of Harper's Ferry.. major game flashbacks lol. Looks like they mapped the town and the surroundings. Even the weird patch of ground by the church. Can really appreciate this as my camp is near here.
---
It‚Äôs griefing just fyi.
---
but it's not like you can get any good legendaries there, at least for me
---
Its like two buttons but agree. Inspect then repair that's dumb.
---
My game has been crashing a door a few days now. If I am lucky I can get past the main menu. Tries to use data reconstruction on Ps4 and it may fix it for a few hour or I get an error saying the game is corrupted. Already deleted and reinstalled 3 times. Now I am fully formating the hard drive to see if that works. Basically the hot fix for patch 8 screwed my system up hard.

thank you for the validation friend
---
My advice move 1 point from end and take cannibal and sunkissed one point each.Add 1 point to charisma and take Max rank lone wanderer.Get rid of your food weight perk in agility and maybe marathoner and take adrenaline,at least 4 points.Find some way to add 3 points of bloody mess to luck.Just my opinion.
---
Pantsed?
---
I vote yes.
---
This sums it up perfectly
---
Todd, who wanted to pad the play time.  Guarantee it.
---
Its hilarious that people still defend this game and bethesda üòÇüòÇ  A lot of us have not played since last patch due to the lag/stagger issue. And all hundreds of other bugs that people write about. Its been out since November and still a big chunk of players cant play after new patches
---
No they changed it to make room for the oprion to use repair kits, not to persuade you to use them. We will inspect the weapon/armor at a work bench, then select how we want to repair it from there. It is less convenient, but it's not a ploy to get you to buy more repair kits.
---
It's almost as if they didn't test it before putting it out.
---
collecting dirty water from a pond or stream or other standing water source goes lightning fast.  There are also ways to trick the water pump into letting you do this.  
---
Aqua Girl/Boy does nothing to prevent you from getting rads while collecting water.  ***WHY!!!!***
---
I agree though, logically, anything you can use Boiled water to make, you should be able to use purified water to make...although perhaps not the reverse?  I understand, programmatically and logistically these are two different things, but it shouldn't be hard to allow Purified to be substituted for Boiled in a recipe without allowing it to go the other way.  Then again, I don't know the code involved...so maybe it is that hard, since they are two different base items and all....
---
I have a furious gatling plasma, and it is amazing. It is my go to weapon on pve when I feel shooty.
---
They also fucked with how plans/recipes are sorted in your inventory and in vendors.
---
Yup literally 10-20 dirty water pr. second, with a mouse macro I could do 50 before the server disconnected me :P
---
Yeah then it would just be like any other shooter game, boring.
---
If you go to the Shack at the event area, there is a computer inside that also explains what to do, but with more flair. (in the context of experiment explanations and lore)
---
By the time you hit higher levels there will be perks that help you conserve their usage and you‚Äôll have access to areas that have a lot just lying around.
---
My advice is to not get to hyper focused on it though, as again at higher levels PA begins to get outclassed by legendary armor and weapons, and with the right perk and legendary combos you can just slap a PA user around.
---
But who chooses "inspect" on the weapon/armor first instead of just mashing the "repair" button after seeing the condition on the left?
---
There's a lumber camp in the east that yields 200-300 wood
---
Splitter is definitely better for close range, but how close do you really need to be with the gatling plasma? I much prefer the focuser so I can keep my distance for the reload.
---
Christmas
---
Yes. You want in?
---
They made it this way because when the add the repair kits, it will be tied to the inspect weapon feature. Inspect it in your inventory, repair it with a kit. If you are at workbench, inspect it, repair it with resources, dont have the resource, you can still repair it with a kit from there
---
I don't mean you always use the expensive stuff, i would only use a more expensive wine if A) i enjoy the taste better than the cheap stuff. And B) whatever I'm making from it will retain that flavor.
---
Obviously, if I'm making something that will lose most of the wines flavor I'll just use cheap wine.
---
What I'm getting at is even the small purifiers aren't late game and its not like it's super canon destroying or immersion breaking to think that some of the 'richer' of us or some of the nicer fancy recipes you can get from whitespring *wouldn't* use purified water over boiled.
---
I just think the game should allow us to make the poor choice to use expensive water in our food over that nasty ass boiled dirty water.
---
Or do you think those rich assholes in tenpenny tower from Fo3 used boiled water for all their food?
---
No way they did with how stuck up some of those people were. 
---
And if rich butts 200 years after the war aren't using it. It makes even less sense for people, not some 20 odd years removed from the war not to still have that pickiness and want to use the 'good stuff'.
---
I think they have fox jerky
---
Except it's adds a tiny amount of "playtime" that ads up over time so they can pad the play time.
---
Every little bit "helps"
---
Well they already have plenty of special in luck, they should just swap out the looting perks as needed. And only throw them on when low in a specific resource. Probably the stimpack one since stims are super easy to craft with chemist and tick blood. Especially if you dilute them.
---
True.
---
I think the folks of Point Pleasant would have a different opinion after what he did to the Silver Bridge.
---
Alright. Lets take a step back here, because maybe I am missing something important here. Instead of countering points as that is obviously getting no one anywhere, im just going to ask about what in confused about. This is all calmly asked questions for discussion, not insulting or demeaning. Im just trying to understand.
---
1. If fights are essentially 1st hit wins, how is it an advantage? Fights arent constant battles like in CoD. 1 dies and has to respawn. There is plenty of time to run, respawn else where, fast travel and repair at your camp, etc. Thats why im confused how there's an advantage. The only benefit is the winner doesn't have to go fix his weapon. The loser can just respawn else where.
---
2. I know repair kits dont require junk. And yes it allows the user to have more space in their carry capacity. How does this effect anyone but that player? They can carry more stuff...woo hoo. How does that give them an advantage over other players? Like I can carry 625lb right now, how does that effect you if i have 550/625 rather than 600/625.
---
3. I agree. They fucked people over and its messed up. I am pissed for those people that didnt get their bags. I have no idea what the fuck Bethesda was thinking. I understand people arent trusting them a lot right now. I am only disagreeing/not understanding the pay-to-win arguments. If the argument is "they stated they would only sell cosmetics" then yeah, I agree that they lied. Thats fucked up again and people have every reason to be upset. I can see that gray road being created. It will lead to things like $10 for 10 bulk Ballistic Fibers. I understand people would be upset. What i disagree with is that it makes them better. It just eliminates some grind. They dont get the experience from it. So on this point, I understand your side completely. I just dont care if they want to skip the grind of getting junk or not. I will still grind, because I like leveling up lol.
---
I dont really care for the idea of repair kits. Add them or not, in the store or not, I probably wont use them (unless I found them in game randomly, but I wouldnt go searching for them).
---
Thank you for taking the time to discuss this and help me understand the reason people feel they are disadvantaged and the things I may be missing.
---
This is it....I'm creating a new faction called,The Briefers!
---
We will force you to strip to undergarments or destroy all your stuff.
---
Does it have a condition before it spoils?
---
Hard to say. Nuked Whitesprings seems about the same. Watoga, which had always been good for me, is lately giving me zero legendaries. But then I hit West-Tek and got a 3* power fist in the parking lot - instigating, 40% faster swing, +1 strength.
---
this is why i drop stuff off at my stash often. I'm only 37 though so I don't have nearly as much junk as other people.
---
Just looked and fox jerky does exist but yes it also has CND
---
Are you kidding me? 1 bufftat and 1 mentat. Glad I risked my life getting chased by several overleveled creatures to get here
---
Im actually fine with this, it takes a little bit to get used to, but once you do it doesnt really make a difference. And at least I'm not pulling stuff out of my stash by accident anymore
---
How do you know it was players and not AI?  Did you see wanted logos pop at your camp?  If not, then it was probably just spawns triggered by someone being in the area.
---
Seriously! I no I am
---
Yea see, I'd like jerky that didn't spoil. I mean people do dry out the meat to become jerky that way it last longer and doesn't spoil. So having meat in your inventory that doesn't spoil would help and like I said benefit carnivores or just people in general. If you don't like carrying around canned goods that is. Personally if non spoilable jerky were added, that's all I'd carry for food
---
So I don't know if this bug was fixed, but I'm trying to find something on a similar issue... I completed the quest, and received reward, exp, etc. Cleared out from data and everything. I used the camp as a quick fast travel point, and now the quest has respawned in my data "Complete basic training" as part of the main story line... and won't let me even restart the quest. I don't have anything from completing the quest prior on me, and am wondering if my main story line just won't progress for this character now?
---
I think he's just saying have their effects negated for PvP.
---
Mine's in a nice and extremely isolated spot south of Bolton Greens. Surrounded by trees and hills. Also adjacent to a nice critter spawn point for chickens, radstag, and foxes. Since its in The Forest, I never get anything higher than level 10 Super Mutants that get mowed down. Prolly have to move when Player Vending appears to attract customers, also tempted to make a place deep in the Mire for the excitement and mood.
---
Anyhow, yes, sounds like you're direct on a spawn point, just have to move down a ways and then place all your turrets to face the spawn point for extra protection.
---
I‚Äôve noticed it on &amp; off recently. Think it‚Äôs still part of rng, but happy with getting extra mats where I can :)
---
Then where will I get all my 1* pieces of wood armor?
---
I like that but I‚Äôd rather having a canning station where you can put different meats in
---
There is also a terminal in the but that should explain more or less what needs to be done.
---
6. Always assume the world is out to get you
---
7. The doctor too, trying to dull your senses
---
8. You're not paranoid
---
That would also be awesome! Being able to seal in meats like radstag and brahmin so they didn't spoil and acted like dog food but gave you more food percentage would be super useful.
---
Level doesn‚Äôt mean skill

You realize there‚Äôs other games that have this feature right? And it would be much easier for you to go play those games than waste your time writing out your opinion that won‚Äôt have any effect on what happens to this game, especially when you‚Äôre telling people if it‚Äôs going to be ‚Äúdone right‚Äù like your opinion is the end all be all, when in fact no one cares or agrees.
---
No, he means briefed.  
---
It‚Äôs another way to say he got atomic wedgie‚Äôd.  
---
I wouldn‚Äôt lie to you, would I?
---
That‚Äôs one of the reasons I love the series honestly.
---
Its because of the incoming repair kits. When you hit "Rapair" you will need to make a choice whether to repair at the bench or repair using a kit.
---
Some of the default controls are from the other game, but are still bad and always have been
---
My thoughts too which seems difficult because I think thats the only random event with a sloth. :/
---
[The only thing I have to say to yelpers and their reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDlR_ccnZww)

---
I don‚Äôt run even one point of sneak but I do run a full unyielding set and my player is still a ghost, hugging supermutants without them seeing me.
---
So I wouldn‚Äôt say the sneak perk card is a ‚ÄúMUST‚Äù.
---
If anything though, escape artist is the ‚ÄòMUST‚Äô.
---
With every set but the default wooden shack set (planks bulge out too much while every other set is or almost completely flat), you can place two doorways facing into eachother (doesn't work with any other windows, flat walls, etc). They snap into place quite easily, and you can simply change the walls via the replace function. Powered doors and garage doors will also snap into doorways as well, and you can get some interesting results with those.
---
they had a 500 cap bounty and were near whitesprings anf long gone by the time i got back to my base, i didnt even know i got attacked
---
They should bring back the cola mixer machine from the nuka world dlc.
---
This is not true at all.
---
I'd LOVE this feature so bad!
---
I been doing it for days. I don‚Äôt know why they messed with it, that‚Äôs not one of the things that needs fixing. üòë
---
The worst part is you have 10 people at the event and only 1 or 2 are going for the pylons. Everyone else is just there to mooch lol
---
Didn't say I have OCD because of this you fucking moron,  jt the fact I do makes me unable to wear unmatching armor, I can't have odd number so I drop aid items and even bullets when I see them odd. I only open my pipboy when I need to due to the pure fact I don't like odd numbers, I hate seeing several different containers in my camp all holding the same shit. This is just a start and nothing compared to what disturbs me in reality. So come down off your purch and keep your fucking beak out of my business.
---
You need to do more damage. I‚Äôve killed the queen over a hundred times, solo‚Äôd her even, never once did she not drop me loot.
---
I carry them all the time. My stash is full with mods, 3-star legendaries that are worthless and i save for the legendary vendor and misc stuff
---
All junk and ammo is always on me because the perk only works on the direct player inventory and it would just take up too much space in the stash.
---
Is your base at WS?  If not that means nothing. When your base is under attack you get a notification in the form of a quest.  
---
Having a high bounty like that can only be gotten (in adventure mode) through destruction but that doesn't mean he wrecked your camp. For all you know he could have pissed someone off in survival enough for them to put a bounty on him (its possible to pay to place a bounty on a player in survival).
---
That's also not OCD.
---
?
---
&gt; Well, Clarice‚Ä¶ have the sheepsquatches stopped screaming?
---
LOL HAHAHAHA
---
That is why I love this game. Sometimes it's so silly it's lovable.
---
Eh, got a 2 star Furious Deathclaw Gauntlet with swing speed there last night; not god tier but a pretty decent drop for WS I thought.  My buddy got a some 3 star leather leg he was super happy with, just depends on what you consider good I guess.
---
Boil it and nuclear material together.
---
way to take being a grammar Nazi to a whole new level... lol.
---
The mats themselves aren‚Äôt really the problem in that scenario. In theory, the placement restrictions on every camp item would prevent the mats from being placed in spots they shouldn‚Äôt be. However, Bethesda would have to fix all of the exploits that allow players to circumvent those placement restrictions for that system to actually work. Fixing all of those bugs would not only take a lot of work, but it would end up pissing off a lot of players who use things like the rug glitch to build some more creative structures.
---
You can still (rarely) find them by the Pleasant Valley Cabins. I just found the arm plans there today.
---
Here is a more combat oriented build.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=9c438c8&amp;d=ic4i12s72ar2ao0pd2pk2pl2sb2sd1so1l71sp1pp2ee2c71an2a31lt2lk2&amp;w=l62l92ik0i30ij2i61i71ia0im1i50iq2in1l02at1ag2pa0pc2ps0p90pr2sf2ss2s52si2sv3sj2&amp;n=&amp;m=
---
  I optimized your shot gun damage perks and took out the pack rat since ideally your junk is in your stash not on you. 
---
I kept the aid and chem benefits, i threw on some more stealth skills ideally the tsctic would be to charge up vats crits snd use throse from stealth and try to knock out enemies one at a time. 
---
I notice you have starched genes but no mutations, i left it there assuming you wanted the option.
---
Don‚Äôt rush the vendor just be Patient and wait
---
It's FAR better to just die and respawn.  You spawn almost right at the event.  Waiting/hoping for someone to stim you is a total waste of precious time.
---
my base is south of whitesprings
---
While I was desperately spamming the "HELP" button after getting the second pylon, right before someone else ran over, I some dirtbag POS right next to me looting someone's deathbag bag, and then running around to all the other bags, too. So he's just there, stealing shit, sponging the event, and couldn't even spare a damned stimpack to resurrect the person on 2 of the pylons. 
---
I've got a Vampire's shotty, so once I start hitting stuff I'm fine, but before then I can be pretty easy for the Squatch to kill, especially being on 2 pylons.
---
I think Bethesda knows about as much about weapon weight as the do releasing a patch. Which isn't much since the can't release a patch without breaking stuff that worked fine and then acting like nothing is wrong.
---
Dont forget those Walking Canes.
---
he was over at Blackwater mine by the time i went back to my camp
---
And rolling pins.
---
I was 75 and my mate 70. I run a vats crit sniper with a few pieces of assassins armour he runs a power armour kinda standard rifleman. 
---
So the initial encounter near whitesprings was a running battle and it kept up like that when we wound up on the border of the divide and forest. The groups we fought ranged from lv 50s to lv 100+. We had a few advantages, the biggest was we seemed more coordinated which allowed us to draw our opponents out or sneak up on them whilst they searched for us, we used alot of baiting tactics to reduce our opponents advantages such as numbers. The other thing was we retreated when being close to being overwhelmed which kept us in the fight. Alongside this we all ran into a dudes camp and he and his turrets went off on everyone so it descended into a free for all that we took advantage of.
---
The siege scenario meant we had the high ground, and worship defence kept spawning in meaning mobs (like a horde of glowing snallygasters) would chase people out of cover for us to drop with rifle fire. The elevation prevented people from targeting us with anything but explosives so we had the advantage especially as my vats meant acquiring targets was easier. Melee builds had to clear open ground and make it up a small fire escape to reach us which usually resulted in them getting killed pretty sharpish.
---
Basically were bushwackers.
---
Yeah the new repair UI  choices suck donkey dick.
---
Yup found that tonight.
---
agreed its super annoying.
---
\*you are suffering from diabetes\*
---
Whether he‚Äôs referring to PvP or PvE my comment still stands.
---
May want to consider moving. Also, there's a Yao Gaui spawn on the golf course, a fissure not far from there, and Scorchbeasts regularly appear near the resort, sometimes multiples. This is to say nothing of the countless ghouls there that could have been led there by a jerk or a low level fleeing in terror.
---
There are 4 Unsolved quests in all.
---
I started the event earlier and run a bloodied melee build so I can literally 5 hit the squatch. I do shit because I had to be the conduit or no one would. I was in game chat like tf are you guys even doing you‚Äôre spraying at an invincible npc. And no one acknowledged it at all. Just kept wasting their ammo so I said fine and stopped being the conduit and we failed the event lol
---
One of the female skeletons in the frat house ... any of them ... preferrably brought back in a drunk state.
---
But yes I‚Äôve had lots of people steal shit that dropped too
---
Your luck affects the value of your treasure, I tested this at one location over 4 maps for it and the higher you get your luck the better the loot, I used bobbleheads, drugs, food and armour pieces, it seemed to make a difference in the weapon type and meds I got.
---
You on x box?
---
yeah
---
WinterImmersion, add me I'll get you sorted out.
---
was able to repair but I can't even afford to repair weapons
---
Yeah I don't get that at all. Total waste of ammo, and they're giving all they got for nothing. I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone even tries to shoot the thing when all the pylons aren't covered.
---
So he's lying? Or he found a bugged gun?
---
If you use auto stim with a low health build you‚Äôll be out of stims very quickly.
---
You on right now? I've got plenty to toss out.
---
yeah, gt is my Reddit name
---
Yep, i'd like the concrete set from fallout4 too, vertical half walls etc etc
---
The cherry on top for me was "Suffering from The Blight" as your corpse started to cool.
---
It is getting pretty bad here. Taxes and utilities are going up while jobs are disappearing and wages staying the same. Drugs are taking over the people's lives who chose to stay here.
---
I still love my state though. If you like anything outdoors this is a great place for it.
---
Be there in three
---
The game is made primarily for consoles despite it‚Äôs main audience being on PC.
---
Okie dokie, that's good to know. Thanks!
---
Whether or not a build is viable is really only relevant in competitive games, so are you asking about pvp? If not, use whatever you want if you think it's fun, hell you can unequip all your perk cards if you think that'd be cool and it'll still be viable.
---
Its how I have built my syringer collection.
---
P.S. [this map works well](https://fo76map.com/)
---
A fair point. I know of a certain homicidal clown who's quite fond of his bloatfly syringer.
---
Bad suggestion, dense mod + fireproof 3 = zero dmg from the explosives, even a 2k dmg bloodied fatman. And any half decent player that does any PvP has these 2 things.
---
A better suggestion, a crit shot to the head with a high dmg gun, vats crits ignore legendary effects such as assassin sentinel.
---
I would very much appreciate this.
---
My buddy's base: You fast travel to it and you end up inside the place perfectly.
---
My base: You fast travel to it and you end up half a mile away for some reason.
---
How creepy was it down there? Like most people always say they never want to go to West Virginia because of how scary it is down there.
---
I've always always been obsessed with mountains and forest areas. If I could I'd move in the middle of a forest and just claim a spot and live my life. (Technology would be hard to give up)
---
Apparently a lot of people get the "Hills have Eyes" heebies type feeling out that way.
---
It's a bag snatcher event for the dirtbags. Fortunately most players I have encountered were quick in helping out.
---
Plus you can't apply mods
---
Me too! ProTip: Weapon reduction armor. Armor equipped= I weight 210 Power Armor= I weight 540
---
So far not bad, but i still have issues with the missing content (player vending machines, Beararm, and the Sheepsqauch itself) but this update in itself does add some good. I'm new to the subreddit so i probably wont get any attention and that's fine. I personally still have hope for F76 all we need is more INTERESTING content and less corporate decisions (repair kits and lunch boxes).
---
It was in order to provide item naming. Was not worth the feature.
---
I find it really crazy that they have the exact same thing on the Fallout 4 creation club, but not in Fallout 76. There's an ELEVEN color power armor bundle (which includes chrome and onyx) for a whopping 800 credits, or 100 credits credits each bought separately ( $8 and $1 respectively).  
---
Looking at the skins in the Atom Shop... yeesh, and people thought $8 for a bunch of simple skins was pricey. Atom Shop was a mistake, they should have carried Creation Club over so at least modders could get paid too.
---
Well this site would have been good to know about when I made my five builds. Had to look up all the perks. Figure out the special allotments and leveling. Never even occurred to me there could be a site out there to streamline all that. -__-
---
Yup. Ah well, what can ya do? Hope you're not in the middle of a plastic run when it starts.
---
I lost my Gatling fun and Fatman then when I travelled home, I found the Fatman but not the Gatling gun : (
---
I ain't gonna lie. I snatch death bags. But I also stim anyone i see that needs it.
---
I have checked Gulper Lagoon at least 15 times (past year)... have never seen a Lego there.
---
A canned food  machine would be cool too like making a canned food out of radstag. With all the aluminum out there and lasers, you can practically sterilized food and the aluminum can for making a canned food.
---
I have no evidence, but my West Tek drops have taken a quality hit.
---
Agreed, enforcer had no effect on it that I could tell whereas the SBs and SBQ get the full effect
---
I've been playing Conan Exiles lately, so I thought I was just getting the controls confused when I came back to, but now that you mention it they did change that!
---
Not only would they do it for the obvious (acid) but player kills are also worth more caps in adventure than in survival. There's also a ton of fucked up mechanics that allow griefers to trick players in adventure
---
It was a complete mess at launch. It's still quite a bit messy and I don't agree with all the changes that happened. My biggest issue right now is there's a real lack of a dedicated gameplay loop, so it's not hard to outpace the new content. The core loop for much of the game is A: accumulate junk B: spend junk on repairs and that gets old pretty quick. I'm trying to extend some of the continued play value by being involved in trading and PvP, but with little being added in loot diversity and survival being an exploit-ridden mess it's hard to get more out of it.
---
Dude this happened to me, soooo damn annoying! I spent like a half hour checking bodies
---
Whitesprings got nerfed in what gets dropped.
---
Was going to downvote you after reading your first sentence but you then brought up good points. Maybe just point out why it‚Äôs a bad idea rather than start off sounding like you have no empathy.
---
Sorry I should have specified, just pve I don't have much interest in competitive game anymore let alone an action rpg
---
But with enough agility and ap regen you can do both at the same time anyway ;).
---
I notice that while weapons disappear, armor doesn‚Äôt, which seems super weird. Haven‚Äôt power armor yet
---
Dito
---
Imposter Imposter Sheepsquatches.
---
Good lord...
---
How do you fail the event? I‚Äôm trying to figure this out as every time I try to do it it fails.
---
Hes asking about cap stashes not vendors. I almost told replied with the same thing you said
---
It's a hit or miss there, but you'll find a legendary gulper there occasionally out of the 3-4 that spawn there. I would start my route with that spot, then move to "abandoned waste dump" as that spot also had a hit or miss of 1 of the 2 deathclaws being a legendary. Then i'd move to watoga, watoga municipal center, etc; but this past week i've had dry streaks in every spot. Currently farming whitesprings and looking for more locations that have a high guranteed legendary
---
Ah opps. I was busy at work, I did a dumb. Didn't pay attention
---
I think most people replying to OP thought he meant vendor lol I know I did for some reason
---
There's that and despite the nerf everyone is offloading caps so they can play survival without risking losing caps. I loved survival mode, but when it started getting populated by capless kamikazes it became pointless.
---
Brain.exe stopped working for me lol.
---
Yeah, very true.
---
I've seen it in the vendors, where the \[known\] are no longer at the top, but for my inventory its been the same, known at the top plan or recipe in the list alphabetically
---
a lot of people get confused about legendary prefixes. like i saw a guy try to buy a Bloodied TSE Handmade. 
---
Bloodied and Two shot are Major effects, thus cannot exist on the same weapon.
---
Game should be fixed more before new content ! Its your own fault for hoarding
---
it makes sense if you ask me, makes it so people would by repair kits, just to avoid 2 extra cliks.
---
Yikes
---
I got an Assassin's lethar leg with +1 Strength and 20% reduced food/chem weight, not too long ago at WS. Only kept it because of the extra carry cap and redux perks.
---
Worth it for my power armor alone tbh
---
If you don't want PvP, don't take workshops. You have to agree to getting pulled into PvP when you claim the workshop through dialog box.
---
Hopefully it is and it‚Äôll give us a way to get a better alien blaster
---
I feel like a ghoul npc would be the mist obvious to implement. Especially since it‚Äôs only set 25 years after the bombs hit. Enough time for the ghoul mutation to take effect but really not long enough to have most ghouls go feral. Just another inconsistency with lore continuity I suppose.
---
Rip in the chat boys
---
A high level probably went in there for a horde event and left that behind
---
Any 2 shot tho
---
Those turn out good regardless
---
You opt out of PvP by turning on pacifist mode and not claiming workshops. PvP contesting workshops is an intended gameplay mechanic. There's no entitlement to uncontested workshop ownership.
---
I love the coming PA skuns, but more armor and weapon skins (not just paint) are what I'm hoping for.
---
Ok. Nou i understand the 308 vs .50 damadge setup better. Maybe because the rate of fire of the.50cal is higher so the made the damage lower ? Just a guess.
---
Nope
---
They actually had a good reason for this iirc, it was something to do with performance?
---
&gt; Why do people still attack you in adventure mode?  
---
I've only killed 1 wanted guy in pvp so far, and I can only speak to my experience as a new player, but survival seems like a shit show atm with a bunch of OP people who've been playing the game since launch and have full sets of legendary god mode armor and insta-kill weapons. As a level 30 something that still uses basic crap, they could probably just sit there and I'd run out of ammo before they die and then use the paddleball on me til I ran out of stimpacks and died myself.
---
Sooooo to me, workshops seem like the best way to experience pvp in the game without trolling/griefing people, since it's a clearly designated pvp thing. I've only defended (unsuccessfully) my own workshop from a player once, but it was fun.
---
Is that the most expensive one?
---
A lot of spawn points are still bugged and put mobs underground. It happens even without CAMPs nearby
---
Some of the areas wil have higher level enemies if higher level players are nearby. You can find a map listing the areas and possible level range.
---
I have had similar problem a few times. Enter a area and the enemies were in the mid teens. Come back 10mins later and they are in the 30's.... 
---
Just have to keep an eye on the map and other playes nearby.
---
We all have a little homicidal clown in us. Mine sings the virtues of the Napalmer.
---
The bag snatching is becoming a trend. The last few times the event was triggered while i was playing, there was someone just running around to grab peoples dropped loot. 
---
 If thats why ur there, then youre a scum bag.
---
Yes, the amount of times I have seen this brought up! Can't believe there  STILL is no fast travel mats to camp.
---
I swear they buffed the quantity and nerfed the quality.
---
I know right, the rewards are varied though so I might ha w just gotten the shot end of the stick. The other ones were very good.
---
Guns types i'd like to see again.
---
anti material rifle
---
9mm pistol and sub-machine gun
---
assault carbine
---
recharger pistol and rifle
---
Obligatory snarky reddit reply. CHECK!
---
I spread the joys of Nuka-Cola to the masses, or at least whatever pieces of them are left after they receive their gift.
---
Thats no lie. Im at a point since the atrocious fasnacht event and the non existant drops that im really struggling to see why i should spend another second on nuke zones, or any of this new content or this game sadly. In a week ive seen this new event 3 times and got 3 chest pieces only 1 was 3 star and it was lvl 40. FML
---
players can destroy your camp if you are in pacifist mode, at least until they add pacifist camp protection.
---
Yeah, true - I haven't played a PA character in ages, but I remember the pain. That would make a big difference.
---
Shhhhh.
---
Plus the sound or chat in game is bugged ,effing game is more broken than before
---
Still available if you want to organise a time to do this, it‚Äôs 6:48am as of posting this
---
It is a tad annoying, I've only been playing since Fasnacht so it's not as bad for me, as I only had a few weeks to get used to repairing with one button but yeah the way it is now is annoying, hopefully they change it back.
---
some thing happens to me, I soon as I open the elevator door game crashes to dashboard (xbox), I dont bother going there anymore.
---
Mutation serums.  With Hard Bargain 3 I get 450 each from vendors. There may be ways to make it even higher with chems, mags, food, bobbleheads, etc. 
---
I just bought 2 recipes last night and in an hour Whitespring run and a quick dip into Fissure Prime I was able to craft 5 grounded serums.  Could have done more but WS was pretty cleared of glowing bastards.  Sold 2, 3 will eat my limit tomorrow.  I paid 1500 for the recipes, so I'm nearly back to even on my investment in just a day.  It's kind of a chore to farm High Rad fluids/Glowing Mass as it almost has to be a nuke zone, but you get to farm legendaries and xp at the same time.  By far the most caps for an item I've seen.
---
is there any loose date for it?
---
Do they still? I thought two shot modifier decimated Vats accuracy. But I honestly don't know.
---
I'm closer to The Top of the World.
---
You are prolly in their spot. Just move.
---
find and other stop for you camp, I get its annoying but at the end off the day is up too you. other than that it sound a little me me me me me  post.
---
Move your camp about 2 inches and it repairs everything.
---
Yes please, I mean where I spawn now is not bad by any means but I would prefer to spawn right in front of my house.
---
I personally like being in vats, hitting right on the dpad and popping a stimpack (instead of changing target) cause the game dropped vats due to los.... yay wasted stimpack
---
Nobody is gaining something from reviving. You waste your time to get to him and make you a target, only to revive him in the middle of the battlefield. Just respawn. You're already at the edge of the battlefield
---
3* canes are my favourite, actually if I had to choose between getting a decent 3* super sledge  roll or a not so decent to meh 3* cane, I would choose the cane.
---
nothing beats whacking things with the candy cane skin on, unless you don‚Äôt have the candy cane skin then it‚Äôs just a PoS like you said.
---
no, it will come out when they decide to release it.
---
Wait a minute, once you reach 25,000 caps you can't make anymore? Forgive me, I'm new and was not aware of this. That is quite unfortunate but it will incentive me to go for it and buy plans instead of holding off..
---
Not sure about that and they reduced the second shot from 100% to 40% but on my 2 shot guns they do considerably more damage than normal variants
---
If I remember correctly they had something like that on Fallout4‚Äôs creation club, so the modelling and animations exist already and could easily just be imported over to 76 from there.
---
It‚Äôs just a matter of crediting the mod author I believe, since creation club items are just Bethesda endorsed monetized mods, right?
---
I added you I would gladly take some stuff off your hands I got the same problem, Im just buy random plans now to keep me under that 25k limit
---
It was for performance but they just needed to remove the "open" option.  They didn't need to swap the buttons.
---
I wouldn't mind the workshop PVP so much if it isn't always like 2 level 150s with marsupial one shotting my level 30.
---
I lost the Ba Ba Black Sheep quest after signing off last night. I just closed the game and started it back up, connected to a world and it was back.
---
I disagree...If that's all they can do it better than them squatting on top of the shack...at least they are getting a gunner back into the fight that much quicker. I appreciated it today when there was only a couple of us doing any real damage to it, I went down, got revived and barely missed a best shredding it. Unlike last night when I was out of the fight for a lot longer and several other fighters went down. I'd rather that if folks show up for the event they do whatever they can to contribute, but hey, to each their own.
---
People are actually downvoting this. What is this subreddit ü§£

I started this weekend so im as new as they come, but so far my experience from 4 is carrying ober for the most part.

Some of the most fun to be had in this game is being a gun-fu gunslinger, having a quad western and going full Leeroy Jenkins at a Distant Thunder event.
---
Uh... you‚Äôve already been proven wrong by games like Counterstrike. People pay HUNDREDS and even THOUSANDS for aesthetics. Many, many people choose to play the hard way rather than paying for what you seem to perceive as a necessity. It‚Äôs not. We all play right now with normal bench repairs, and many of those never took repair perks. It‚Äôs easier to farm the resources than constantly swap perks.
---
It's to sell kits man. Make the job more annoying so we'll shell out.
---
Keep building and don't stop.
---
Lucky Hole mine is all you need to know.
---
Yeah Bethesda is probably gonna read this post &amp; immediately rush to release a buggy legendary vendor.. all because page305 has asked
---
Glad I helped someone out!
---
Every time someone kills me in a workshop they just roll out and don't even build anything there. People are just using the workshop PVP as an excuse to one shot lower level players. I've never had an experience where we were fighting over an opportunity to hold a location and mine resources.
---
There is 4 in total including the picnic panic one.
---
Probably may with the vendor update
---
Alright. I can see the confusion I think. 
---
1. As far as I've seen, weapons degrade when you fire them, not just when you hit. If your opponent can avoid your attacks long enough for your weapons to break and you DON'T have a repair kit, you're in trouble. However, if you DO have a repair kit and you're fast, you can duck behind cover and repair it for no cost. It is a VERY minor situational advantage, but it is an advantage nonetheless and the problem the more logical people upset about this have are with the principle of selling ANY sort of advantage whatsoever because it "opens the door".
---
2. The carry weight thing wasn't meant to be the main focus of that point, but to address it, that means you can carry more weapons and aid. The main focus of the repair kits not using junk is more the fact that if two people break their weapons in the middle of the woods while in combat, the person who paid real money for the repair kit will have the higher advantage because they can repair on the spot without worrying about having the resources. Worse, if there IS a workbench nearby but the person without a repair kit doesn't have all of the resources necessary to repair, they're still screwed. Even worse still, if the person without a repair kit DOES have the resources, the person with the repair kit merely needs to repair a single weapon and guard the workbench, automatically winning that conflict as the other player is forced to leave or die.
---
3. The people focusing SOLELY on repair kits being "pay-to-win" aren't looking at the bigger picture. Literally just putting the basic kits in the loot tables and NOT in the atom shop would fix the entire issue.
---
To summarize, the pay-to-win aspect of the repair kits is extremely minor. The actual threat of them is that you can buy them for real money, giving yourself that tiny situational advantage and telling Bethesda "this is ok".
---
She left you behind cause you were to dumb and she left you to rot in a break room. She didnt even have the decency to kill you. That was her responsibility and she left it up to some strangers. If theres any justice in the wasteland she will be turned into a centaur.
---
The real reward is the chems, xp and 0 weight food
---
I agree. But stuff of THIS quality is what people will willingly buy. Not simple recolors.
---
Np haha yeah like I said, go whatever build you want if you're pve! You might kill slower than an optimal min-max build, but as long as you're doing damage and have stimpacks/radaways to survive, you'll kill them all the same.
---
Actually no, with contractor rank 2, you can get all of those up easily. I can easily get all the extractors up, powered by either a fusion generator or the power plant.
---
I'm a tard and dont know how to name my power armor. So.ebody please help me
---
I‚Äôm actually right next to Ohio Adventures and use it as a store. But I also want to hit the road and meet more players lol.
---
you are living my dream, my average is either wood armour or pipe weapons, i have sinned in the RNG Gods eyes
---
hold a power plant workshop can give you power cores and a few hours that you hold the plant will give you enough power cores to run PA for a while
---
Yeah I agree page305 knows when to push updates
---
I feel like the result isn't fighting a good fight for the right to use the workshop resources...the reality is "let's make sure nobody can use the workshop so we can enjoy fragging lower level players not in a PVP mindset." God forbid somebody get's caught up in the multiple tabs and menus you have to scroll through to get anything done. That's truly satisfying sport right there. "Hey I killed that guy in a menu putting down a stash everyone can use with my leet skillz, stupid nub."
---
I agree.
---
haha what happen!
---
In engine, unless they currently have a way to state "Ingredient X can be either A or B" , which I doubt, they'd have to duplicate every boiled water recipe and swap it for a pure water version.
---
They don't want to play survival because they can't jump unprepared players as easily that way.
---
Don't underestimate the bolt action pipe gun.  I still occasionally use a 1 star 2 shot bolt action as a sniper rifle for range.  Wood armor should just be removed from the game or only drop at low levels, but here we are.
---
Well I never claimed *I* soloed the queen.  But if you got off your soapbox and just searched 3 simple words in google, you could have cut that wall of text out.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo46JIqUx6I
---
Very true. Then in that case screw it. It‚Äôs good for a powerful damage output but I just don‚Äôt think just build is that good if you‚Äôre going into combat knowing damn well you‚Äôre going to get hit a lot or take a lot of damage. Especially against the Sasquatch imposter or scorch queen.
---
I did but the stored blueprint bugged
---
Stat buffs/debuffs don't affect perks. Only base stats do.
---
so I had to make it over again with took a hour and a half
---
I‚Äôve done it like 5 times and always failed. It‚Äôs because time runs out before you kill the sheepsquatch.
---
You can keep all your perk cards.  You just lose the bonus for the extra special stat that it affects.
---
Hmmm. No visual timer or am I blind?
---
This happened to me yesterday, I was thoroughly confused because I live in a peaceful non-spawn zone so I have like 3 turrets so how it died? No idea.. definitely was NOT my turrets though lol
---
Only way I can think of is by having a recipe for each water type, but with the purified version having a "getcomponentcount" (or something) for Dirty and Boiled Water at 0, so it only shows up if you don't have any of the lesser waters.
---
Otherwise you'll have people accidentally crafting soup with purified and getting pissy.
---
Had no idea they were in 4. I think when I played through it, and by the end of my playthrough, the creation club was just starting out. I do believe several mod authors did pretty much go with creation club exclusive content (they no longer made non-creation club content for free).
---
That's why 90% of the time all the workshops are unclaimed. Why would a level 10 character risk wasting the time and resources on building a workshop with some level 50+ characters are just going to roll up and destroy everything for fun and then sever hop to reroll loot spawns?
---
You can also nuke her too, I was doing the I Am Become Death quest and was about start the SBQ event but just as preps were being made someone started the Encryptid event so I launched it there and got the Ground Zero Trophy in the progress as well, so I managed to hit 3 birds with 1 nuke :)
---
Well I had a blast lol. I just need more stims now.
---
I found this video to be very useful. https://youtu.be/IbLK42Y2_Og
---
Keep crying man. If you can‚Äôt take criticism, maybe stay off the internet. Trying to turn it around on me doesn‚Äôt change the facts of the situation lol. Sad.
---
I miss not having Marital Artist for another 30% speed. It was so damn fast.
---
Opposite here. I had a two shot pump &amp; handmade &amp; after the nerf I don‚Äôt use them. I‚Äôm melee only because I don‚Äôt have a gun worth a damn lol. The pump used to one shot things not it‚Äôs like a 5 shot. Used to use maybe 5-6 rounds of my handmade to kill most enemies, now it‚Äôs half of my 85 round drum.. they nerfed it way too hard because griefers used them but they need to balance PvE &amp; pvp separately because since the two shot destruction I see way less SBQ‚Äôs because everyone used two-shots for it besides niche melee builds &amp; such. Just enjoyed the old days of going in a nuke zone &amp; blasting my two shot pump into a crowd of glowing ones :-/ some of my treasured 76 moments
---
Ok,  gotcha
---
If they put this camo skin the atom shop with it im all in for the PGM Hecate II

thanks guys that's all i needed to know! case closed.

Sadly, I live relatively close to Morgantown, and the economy of the small town is exactly as you described. Drive out Rt7 to Hundred, and that road and some of the locations should give you an idea that it isn't just southern West Virginia that is terrible. It is the entire state with the exception of a few big cities and areas based near the interstate. It really is a shame, but Dollar General truly is and has been the driving force of much of the state economy with the coal mines being the only other dominant driver of financial stability. This state is "wild and wonderful," but most of the state doesn't have access to high speed internet if not for satellite internet.
---
So do want to fight workshop owners because you want the workshop, or because it's an opportunity to PVP?
---
Maybe it's already in game and we just don't know where to find it yet
---
Look if you want a decent 3* legendary you‚Äôre going to have to buy it off of eBay like everyone else did. It‚Äôs funny they were called losers for spending 5 bucks on a weapon. But meanwhile others spend months searching for a decent weapon to drop. Meanwhile it takes you 15 mins of work time to earn 5 bucks
---
Nah it would have definitely been found by now or data mind but maybe who knows that could be really cool
---
There is a mod that fixes it already lol it's so fucking good
---
Also the Event:Line in the sand, at Allegeny gives 3 fussion cores upon completion.
---
its too late for me. ive already maxed my stash and im nearing a 1k average carry weight with 25% ammo reduction/weapon weight as well as having the armour reduction perk lmao
---
Dayum man think I know what's getting patched come maintenance
---
They reduced the second shot down to 25%, not even 40
---
Awesome, sounds like fun. I've been avoiding survival cause I'm only level 30 something so far and have no fancy gear.
---
When are you fixing the broken mod system! I want my jet pack on my x-01 armour that I bought fair and square from MODUS!? It's pretty useless to me in my inventory!
---
Fair, just a bit of frustration venting of my own, tired of anyone who had the slightest ingest in pvp being called a neck bearded incel.
---
Good advice!
---
Something about  the new event just really infuriated me.  Not the failure of it, but he successful completion of it.
---
Everything there was accurate for me until "event complete" - for me I died repeatedly, the multiple random players were wandering around aimlessly doing no damage to the sheepsquatch until we failed the event.
---
Honestly, grenades render most builds moot. A good grenadier player is terrifying. All explosions. All day.
---
What I'm saying is be a psychotic prankster
---
You don‚Äôt even have to get the power plant running to do that. Just use your own generator
---
Heard about people doing this, but haven‚Äôt run into it myself. I completely agree that anyone who goes for this is scum. It‚Äôs incredibly easy to get any kind of scrap (except for maybe ballistic fiber, but who carries a lot of that around?). 
---
The event is intended to bring people together to fight a common enemy, not for you to be a cheap POS. In case you can‚Äôt tell, I‚Äôm not a people person.
---
I just found a 3 star crossbow and at level 186, i decided to use this weapon for the first time. Its fun,half the times it gives you back your arrow, but its too bad that you cant attach any modes.
---
Everything above killing it is about right
---
It was a nightmare. Many way higher than me (160) players were just running around shooting the robots with explosive weapons and not becoming the conduit. They stole a lot of kills I could have used to prop up Adrenaline. Ended up being the conduit on all 3 pylons, died 3 times and spent 12 super and 20 regular stimpaks. I got a lvl 30 sh1\*t armor. I rather farm the queen.
---
The MG42 lmg is an absolute monster now. Unfortunately .308 is just too expensive to run it all the time. It blows past every other heavy weapon now in dps. I'm in the ballpark of letting remain as powerful as it is with the drawback of not--cheap-to-make-ammo, but a slight boost to how much .308 you can make would be nice.
---
Flamer seems to do perfectly fine damage, but the fuel is beyond unsustainable at a max of 9 fuel with ammosmith. Seriously needs to be buffed to a much higher value and balance how much it takes to make that much, while remaining cheaper than it's current state.
---
The gatling laser needs a buff along with the minigun, and both have the same stats. They use way too much ammo for a less than acceptable performance. It's an absolute waste to bother using, unless you have great legendary effects.
---
Powered melee weapons need major buffs in just straight up more damage, like the ripper, chainsaw, drill, etc. Atm there's a bug where over-repairing those weapons buffs their damage dramatically for some reason, and even with the large damage buff they're not op at all, especially with the constant direct contact you need with the target.
---
Pistols could use some love, and some more than others, especially the alien blaster.
---
I'd also like it if weapons like the broadsider weren't a COMPLETE novelty.
---
I'd also like for the harpoon gun to have a faster reload and the option for a expandable magazine like the broadsider. The damage is perfectly fine for it. A quad capacity harpoon gun is surprisingly good.
---
That was extremely well explained, thank you. I do understand now. I also believe a compromise can be made. Although the advantages gain are minor and situational, they should still add them in game.
---
I would be ok if they kept them in the atom store and also made it a static reward for some random daily quest. I feel that that is a good middle ground. We have a guaranteed 1 per day and can save them if we want, or we can pay money and get some extra.
---
*completion* ugh
---
My camp is next to a SB spawn, and they seem to like landing inside my camp. Unfortunately they dont like to leave after
---
Yup. Xbox1 here and same.
---
I knew all my years of working with Nick Valentine would pay off 
---
Also why am I being down voted
---
If no one was doing the quest at all, then that means everyone agrees with your statement.   However people do the mission, so obviously they think its worthwhile to do.   So what needs fixing?
---
Well, for entertainment maybe? You can only grind West Tek so much
---
Yeah. Definitely always stash all junk before coming to this event. There is a very high chance of dying multiple times and never finding your dropped paper bag while doing this event.
---
If you just stash all junk before, the dying does nothing and don't matter anymore.
---
I think they reduced how common it is. I had found 7 of them before my first character hit 50. Only place I remember it was is the place with the raider arena. Not sure where in the town though.
---
I disagree. I personally love the idea of the 4:1 ratio of having to collect dirty water to craft into boiled water for all these daily brewing challenges. There's something about collecting 200 bottles of dirty water for 30 atoms that makes me optimistic for the future of this game, and the franchise :)  
---
That was a joke. Down with boiled water! Here here!
---
I have my CAMP right outside the Overseer's CAMP and get multiple visitors a day and have never had anyone cause any issues o_O
---
Yeah I just started messaging people in my games and finally found one. Appreciate it though!
---
It happens to often around me, this is the seventh time. Might need to change base location, between the scorchbeasts and the mothman I don't feel very welcome.
---
Fully agree with u dear sir.
---
Int is absolutely like a joke
---
Took my answer! So take my upvote! She would be so chill as an NPC. Also just want another reason to go back to her, another quest line or something. Hell I'd take more music or dialogue on her station.
---
Sorry but I've NEVER have found anything useful in white springs since after the like first patch after beta release. It's a waste of time to farm there imo. I don't even like doing cheap levels by nuking over there.
---
Sorry I just got home I can get online if you‚Äôre around if not I‚Äôm sure we can work something through.
---
Grenades are fancy too :(
---
Sometimes it takes DAYS to "catch up" to whatever it should be. When I had a deathclaw pet, it died 4 times, and each time it took 10% of my budget, but I had no idea cause I was at max. When I moved my CAMP a day or two later, I suddenly couldn't build 40% of my stuff. 
---
After I was in the new CAMP, the deathclaw vanished one day and never came back. Still 40% over. 
---
Sent in a report, got the usual BS back from support. Gave up. A few days later it went back down.
---
My camp is right near a bobblehead and a mod spawn. They havent respawned in over 2 weeks now. Something was definitely changed.
---
I mean there's an xp curve thats related to intelligence, but the gains arent nearly as good as I feel they should be.
---
But if you have a very mentats already, I dont see a reason not to use it. Generally nets me an extra 40xp per biv quest
---
this man knows how to party
---
&gt; before you actually start loading the server gets the "set camp here request" 
---
It doesn't work that easy. The game can't check for the camp if the server isn't loaded, including all the other players. Otherwise, the devs would have already implemented said feature.
---
If I had to make a guess these are probably alt accounts made for pvp specifically. It makes sense to use a meta build low level in survival because less caps lost while using your main high level to experiment with different builds. Also a bunch of people show their builds on Reddit.
---
You‚Äôd think so. It seems like every hostile person I encounter -looking- for a fight is some combo of legendary op items and invincible. Some guy with an exploding shot gun waved at me today. He probably couldn‚Äôt hear me call him a douchebag for having that weapon that every player uses. Why does Everyone have one. It‚Äôs boring and messed up.
---
Intelligence doesn't affect XP, just like in fo4
---
You seriously think this post was meant to coerce corporate Bethesda owned by Zenimax to change their plans? [http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Satire](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Satire)
---
Right, but none of the builds I have ever seen public are capable of these effects... so it must be a huge secret... that spreads quickly in a certain community.
---
I remember Playing borderlands 1 and there would be timed sales for weapons and armor, etc. at the vending machines. It was great.
---
&gt;not a waste of time though as people want the feature 
---
Well people want a lot. They would still need to do changes to the game that are simply unnecessary. They rather invest their time in bugfixes and new content. Besides, doing heavy changes to the code could result in gamebreaking bugs.
---
Oops thought it was 40
---
Still does some good damage
---
I recently had surgery, and was able to do little more than lay on the couch and play fallout 76 10+ hours a day for a month.  My build is still shit.
---
1k?! Will vendors let you trade with them in game?
---
Ok off topic but I‚Äôve heard your name before. Are you a patron for a let‚Äôs read channel?
---
I can guarentee it does, since berry mentats give int buff an I recieve more co when under its effects. 
---
[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3bgy1/psa_intelligence_increases_xp/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) to a post looking more into it.
---
The funny part is, nobody runs high int,  but we are supposed to be "the best and brightest" in vault 76
---
At some point before the Lying Lowe questline update I saw a glitched event called Sheepsquatch Horde on the map. Joined it and it turned into a feral ghoul horde, but my point is it‚Äôs always possible they‚Äôll add a real Sheepsquatch to the game.
---
Honestly I think if a weapon damage perk is in a certain special category it should receive a damage buff for how high that stat is
---
Create a mule and unload the caps to them. It's just a tedious process and you need someone else you can trust.
---
It‚Äôs a combination of things and it‚Äôs fair when it‚Äôs all said and done. It doesn‚Äôt feel good when you‚Äôre one shotted, but these guys are using alcohol, chems, Armor specs, bobble heads, magazines, mutations, and perk cards altogether. I‚Äôve seen it. I think you just have to have a good understanding on what does what and a good prep plan.
---
Misc, sort by weight
---
Fucking eBay players. Oh but don‚Äôt make it p2w! The horror! .... I have a suspicion that every time I hear someone cry about p2w it‚Äôs one of these types that bought a duped weapon right out the gate.
---
run run fast before she deletes your character!!!!!!
---
That would be awesome. And we could unlock patches along with the titles. We could add the patches to our backpacks that well be getting from ever upwards.
---
I can't even put a mod on a gun anymore since the update. I bought the NV scope from the enclave vendor to put on the gauss rifle and it wouldn't work regardless of how many times I've tried. The message is something like "are you sure you want to remove the current mod and replace it with this one?" I click yes and it doesn't change anything.
---
I can imagine, how you gonna get ban for exploiting. haha.
---
I‚Äôve been there but for every jerk there‚Äôs 100 good lads

---
So where exactly does one buy a repairkit?
---
They are not showing up in my atom store on the XOne?
---
Pete Hines is a damn liar, and both he, and Bethesda, should be taken to task for their shitty business practices.
---
If you're on PC I can meet you in game and open the door for you if you cannot find it.
---
I thought the strategy was to drag it out for as long as possible to try to get a few legendaries to spawn. So,..don‚Äôt speed up the process unless you‚Äôre about to run out of time. 
---
Sorry you didn‚Äôt get to tag the wendigo :/
---
Requests to balance repair frequency and costs, as well as food spoilage and such have definitely popped up a lot and still do, but I can't say I've seen anyone asking for the solution to be a non-cosmetic purchase in the Atomic Store. These are two completely separate issues.
---
Yes, a lot if us (pretty much all of us most likely) want these balances, but we want them in the core game, not as an EA-esque cash grab in the Atomic Store 
---
And it's not just about repair kits; if Bethesda goes back on their word about the Atomic Store being cosmetic-only with the repair kits, then the door is open, and they're free to add all kinds of QoL and game-enhancing MTX.
---
Huh, they should update the text in game then. Even still, yeah not enough for it to be worth it.
---

Escape artist is bugged for around 2months now. Before you could use daggers to stab enemies to face with sneak multiplier (with 20+agility). Now it just don't work, only way to lose danger is to run away and hide in shadow for few seconds. Stealth is anoying, because it works only half-way. I would suggest you two hand melee, or automatic gun build.
---
I'm with you on this one, it's the blinding red light every few seconds until I kill them that gets me. Definitely needs a consistent cooldown.
---
I just went here, cause I've been wandering around for AGES looking. And there was a chicken, and it was tameable! lol
---
Sorry I‚Äôm on Xbox but found someone to unlock it. Just edited the post but I appreciate it.
---
I have 2 mules that are maxed in stash and on themselves with legendarys. I have to transfer stuff to my mules ever other day because my stash will fill up. I save 300lbs for legendarys in my stash.
---
I am not but I have been known to do that sort of thing... I am a NASA guy, former professor, and have a small child.  Usually I help out educational type channels or podcasts.
---
My numbers were just a rough estimate they were just so many I was amazed.
---
Like making energy weapons stronger with high int? That'd be nice, since energy weapons are trash. I can't even use a laser for wiping since it somehow isn't stealthy. An actual laser doesn't make sound nor light.....
---
I never failed an event yet with my main, but I take 2 pylons. I went in with a friend earlier with my pvp alt and you right. You can only take him down 3/4 health and he heals right back up without pylons. It's kind of deceiving because it only seems you're doing damage.

There wasn't anywhere else in Huntington to put the Interstate, unless they wanted to buy up half the city and displace a bunch of people. Although now it seems like half the city is abandoned houses, so maybe that would have been the better option.
---
You don‚Äôt actually want to play any instruments. You ONLY want the juke box running so that it spawns more ghouls &amp; a better chance at more legendary ghouls

Main thing is to load a server with friends who know what they are doing. It's easy then.
---
https://borisplaysgames.wordpress.com/2019/04/11/fallout-76-how-to-defeat-sheepsquatch-minor-spoilers/
---
I killed her more than 100times and I know, that she was super buggy. Sometimes you can hit her how you want, but once she die, for you don't get loot. 
---
Thats why nobody farm her. If you launch nuke (7-30minutes) u have chance, that too many afkers/noobs join and you don't do egouth damage, she can fly away in midfight before event ends, server may shutdown, and you can be without loot in the end (only reward from event).
---
I was honestly surprised when I realised int didn‚Äôt actually do that. Surprised and disappointed.
---
For real. 
---
Although, I'd never even seen that plant since whatever quest, and had totally forgot it existed, so at least the game reminded me? I guess? lol
---
Players may just be too lazy to change weapons so if TSE or melee insta kill is just inevitable.
---
Ivory Grips, man I got 2 of those plans...from one map....and then I got yet another on the next map in the same spot...then did an event and got it yet again.
---
&gt;employees need to shop where they work for the discount. 
---
That's like working at a WalMart and using your WalMart discount at a Safeway.
---
I'm most excited about the vendor to take a screenshot of the massive line of players that will be wrapped around the building waiting their turn.
---
had the same problem a few years back, so instead of playing games for a months I went out every weekend and got home at stupid hours off the night.
---
then she said something about it, and then I asked her, so I asked her which one is worst going out and partying or me staying at home and play games. Lets just say I play without problems now and she plays with me now.
---
I do have a comprehensive understanding of what's going on, and my concern is that the numbers grow quickly once an exploit outside of the intended buffs for such combinations is recognized.  All things said and done, stacked armor, chems, aid, and magazine use shouldn't account for &gt;100% dmg reduction. Even if it did, it wouldn't make sense for large amounts of people across survival to be using all of their resources to murderhobo low levels and builds that lack damage immunity.  That's my question- how does the glitch or OP build info move so fast, including amongst the rookies and those with low resources?
---
It would be good advise if workshops were not absolutely useless and a waste of time.
---
I did a run of about 20+ maps the other day, I got at least 6 plans for T-45 Motion Assist Servos and about 2-3 for T-60,  T-51b helm plan and several other plans that are common to find. These were all savage divide or in The Bog. I've been hunting for Deep pocket Leather limbs....as I have deep pockets for literally every other armor piece...I do remember getting Deep pocket plans from maps though in the Toxic Valley area. I still have more maps (about 20 still) might have to do more hunting....

Do scare crows actually do anything?
---
If you go to Hillbilly Hot dogs, take some pepto or tums with you. Great food, but you might need a little something later for heartburn.
---
People will be sitting for a good 20min the first day then the excitement will go down
---
They are not even in the game yet you brain dead codpiece
---
Cheers, have a couple of low levels we are helping. Will give it a try.
---
I don't get why you don't get wanted levels for that. Make the text red for theft and only add wanted for adventure mode, or something idk
---
Yeah I found by The Thorn. Cheers though :D
---
They don't have these yet? That's sad.
---
Some of these guys are doing thousands of points per hit for damage once these items are stacked with their build. That‚Äôs enough to be one shotted. And if you‚Äôre running around as a Bloodied build without the proper protection or strategy, then it‚Äôs too easy for some of these guys to pick you off. Even with full health, if you‚Äôre not kitted out yourself, you‚Äôre done for. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a glitch. I think people have found out a way to stack all of these things together for their benefit and heck yeah their going out knocking off low levels.
---
actually made me laugh
---
I hate to be a spoilsport, but the real sheepsquatch has already been datamined.
---
This advice is clearly not for people that find workshops useless or a waste of time. Quite the contrary, there seems to be a decent number of people that would like their workshop experience to improve because they enjoy additional base-building, fast-travel points and acquiring CAMP plans and resources.
---
So I'll take that to mean you think this is good advice. Thank you.
---
Once I came upon 8lvl guy in his camp, I thought i will let him live, He killed me with two shots from shotgun (thru my 200level and sentinel armor, haha). TRUST NO ONE!
---
Atleast it's not all bad, with high Int the Power Armor crafting is pretty good and with Int+Per you could make a decent Grenade Spam build.
---
yeah, there's no logic behind this...
---
Yeah have that a try unfortunately didn‚Äôt have it for me
---
Except Survival has brought the exploits to the forefront. I'd wager Bethesda wanted this. They wanted game breaking exploits in PvP exposed. 
---
When the longest life leaderboard was still a thing, I saw two different guys who were using a glitched camp to draw people in, then kill them. 
---
1) A house near Grafton. He dropped his camp beside the house. It has no entrances and no open windows. There's no way to enter and no way to see them, much less hit them (excepting a very brief singular hit in VATS). They were glitched inside said house and had a large bounty to attract victims. 
---
2) Hitboxes on the power line towers are messed up. The trusses are considered a solid object as far as hit boxes are concerned. A shot fired at the open area will not pass trough and grenades will bounce off of thin air back at the thrower.  Since the owner has control, he can control where openings appear/disappear and take advantage of this to kill anyone. He was camped at the WS spawn point.
---
I mean, to be honest, I'm more shocked at how good some buildings in 4  and 3 look, than anything else...I know houses that haven't been maintained for 20 years that are just moldy piles now.
---
I have the food, aid and ammo weight reduction cards active at all times and that pretty much gives me what I have now. Will the backpacks have a trade off? Anyone know what it is?
---
Nope.  
---
"see event" "fast travel to event" "see my desktop".
---
They are still in the game. Idk why they don't show up though
---
The way I think of it is that the weight of certain items like guns are inflated due to how much they are worth in terms of stopping power. For example the old Resident Evil games where a pistol or a shotgun could take up one slot, but when kitted out with mods later on in the game it would take up two. The actual size of the gun may not have changed much but the **importance** did because it was significantly better than what the player started out with. That idea can be applied here, but instead of limited inventory slots, it's weight. You put a beefy mod in place on your favorite high level gun and there's that cost of added weight to try and balance it out. Whether it does a good job of it is a whole other ordeal.
---
Same here. In one instance, I was playing with a friend and so I was able to rejoin the server after closing out the game client and signing back in.
---
Talk about frustrating.
---
yes I have seen it for the past 2 days after nuking WS. free caps anyone!!!!!
---
A shame
---
Please help people. I just got back into this game 2 days ago and need so much help on various things.
---
its a global bug
---
I actually like that. I used to pull first item from stast by accident quite often.
---
I am not running around searching for bag to take but i must admitted a took some that where not mine to when i saw them.
---
but, honestly i didn't seen much cause i aint got no time searching bag while fightings the Squatch
---
I think you're misinterpreting my argument/question.  Survival servers are useless resource or caps-wise for folks like this, and there seems to be an inordinate number of them.  If they were superstacking, they would have had to be making 20 alts from day one just to store the chems and aid... 
---
So, when God-rolled weapons and armor and several decades of non-amateur gaming experience are all out the window... Something is broken, and I am trying to figure out how people know so fast.
---
Huh that's a good point. Never thought about that because I've done the event maybe like only 10 times and never got a legendary ghoul. Thanks for the heads up
---
I have the 1st level of food, junk, and chem, then maxed on armor and ballistic ammo perks. The only trade off I can think they would do is no backpack while in power armor.
---
Well thanks for telling me, now at least know why because I just bought that mod.
---
Yes, this was a bug that was introduced with the last update, effects everyone and all mods.. no doubt bethesda are gonna get round to fixing it.
---
Caps aren't shared between characters so you create a mule character, find someone trust worthy and transfer your excess caps to the mule.
---
Aquaboy/girl = no rads and can't drown
---
True on the power armor part, but that's only one time use benefit and then you can remove the int, and if you don't use power armor, like for stealth or fist melee builds or people who hate the sounds it makes and the UI that blocks your view, you don't even benefit. As for the grenade thing, that's perks rather than the actual int or per stats, you'd only need a base 5 int
---
There are weapons with mods that do more damage to enemy players. And mutations as well.
---
You can get the plans to make them from the event
---
Yep. Also sometimes when you‚Äôre trying to mod something it doesn‚Äôt change it. It lets you do it but doesn‚Äôt apply the mod. And as someone else said sometimes the stats disappear altogether.
---
Not related to repairs but since the patch i‚Äôve noticed that sometimes if I drop something it disappears out of my inventory but the bag doesn‚Äôt appear. And I went to collect my dropped loot yesterday, could see the bag but it wouldn‚Äôt register it so I lost a whole bunch of junk. So frustrating.
---
Awsome thank you
---
do it from pipboy
---
You ever try buying things costing 6k+ caps?... might help...
---
20 hours after, it seems- it's a daily quest.
---
No problem. The one from the quest is only level 30 it's craftable upto 50. If you get stuck I can make them.
---
Actually this is incorrect. When you click play you are assigned a server instance and then it checks to make sure you can join it. During that check they could easily add a check for your camps location center and the radius around it and if there is another camps radius within yours then just find another server.
---
Well, you have 100% more success than I have. 
---
Event pops. I fast travel. Eternal Loadscreen. Every time.
---
Ow okay. Thanks! I thought you can still access the building in those 20 hours reset.
---
Find a PA stand and server hop. Also later on Watoga has like 5 PA and a fusion genny without even entering a building. Plus there's a perk that makes consumption go WAY down.
---
Subtitles are also great for locating legendary scorched or super-mutants
---
I haven't played in a while. I stopped using Mysterious Savior sometime two patches ago, I think. Whenever it was that Adenal Reaction got broken and fixed again.
---
It still seemed fine, but I would "die" several times in a row and it was a pain in the rear....
---
It would be nice not to obtain parasites when I fast travel home. Plus it is in the strategy guide! Bring em back, plz?
---
I'm interested in one.
---
It glitches occasionally, just quit and restart and it should be back to normal.
---
if you have junk on you when you travel to the event, walk over to a bush somewhere out of the way and drop your junk. Play the event and then go back and pick it up. You're probably gonna die at some point and the bag will be out in the open for any greaseball to plunder
---
What event is this?
---
Actually not 20 hours after completing, but everyday in same time. From my experience, when i do it at 8PM on friday, I can do next one at 8AM saturday.
---
Let us close the door while in the porta potty using it and play our holos! Just like real life!
---
Stability wouldn't be that bad if you could relog to the same server. It's infuriating that we can't. Why should we invest hours of play into end game if it gets tossed away with a random crash.
---
you can definitely access the building, get downstairs to BIV and interact with him. The only difference is that you can not trigger a new quest before the 20 hrs reset timer after you completed the daily.
---
The intent doesn't matter. The game doesn't stop you from claiming a vacant workshop because you want to make a maze out of the build space instead of collecting the resources. Likewise, as Bethesda stated in patch 6: "The ability to contest a claimed Workshop is intended and encouraged behavior as part of Workshop design."
---
Hell I already camp across the river from there if anyone wants a free beer
---
So its not just my armour? Its effecting lots of things you're saying
---
Love it!
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Can they bring back the [G11](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/H%26K_G11) as well? That would be so fun to use like in Fo2!
---
from the pipboy, inspect the item and then you're given the option to rename it from the options at the bottom of the screen.
---
Every f-ing day you login and haven't done it yet
---
I wish they did this for other quest reward weapons, it would help their relevance later in the game if your picked it up early.
---
Oh yeah, those melees. Such a joke right now, im hanging on to a 3* ripper just hoping they do something with them. I dont think ive ever used a flamer, ive maybe only seen 1 or 2 entirely
---
Theyll definitely fix this. So just stash the mods you want for a fewdays. .
---
I found the stats disappear for weapon repairs , but stay when I repair armor.
---
It affects all mods for power armour, armour, and weapons after the last update. No mods can be applied at all
---
Why tho?
---
Made a post about this myself a while back. I‚Äôm camped near twin lakes and every time I spawn it‚Äôs in the lake and I end up taking rad damage. I‚Äôve moved the CAMP all around but it seems to spawn me away from my camp and no where useful!
---
Yes, all armor and all mods... they broke it with the last update.
---
Until I asked about this yesterday, I honestly thought I was helping out by completing the event for everybody else.  I've done similar many times over.  Now, I realize that people don't have the same goals as me.  If you have a mic, turn it on and say something.
---
whats inside?
---
If you fix yourself on top of a river with a floating camp, off a 1 grid ladder foundation, from the shore with a turret at the top, that should help. Also yes move you're camp from that darn spawn point!
---
Not in my main character's. There's 15 PA and at least 30 of each stable flux (except violet, I'm filling up on that after making loads of calibrated shocks).
---
How do you figure that. Unlimited fusion cores, lead, steel, acid are useless. Don‚Äôt think so....plus plans and other rewards. And XP. What a waste of time.
---
Alien blaster ammo and a fusion clip. There‚Äôs a little story to it, an alien is cryo freezed in a container. Really wish more of the domes could be opened but there‚Äôs only 3.
---
Fassnacht brought out the nice in the community and this one brought out the bad.
---
how many do you need?
---
You know what must be done.
---
Also class freak perk card reduces the negative effects by 75%. Worth getting.
---
Biv resets at Midnight GMT, vendors reset after 20 hours (first/last purchase?).
---
I wanna join them, too bad ther're on PC.
---
BTW, what's the name of their outfit? sorry but my game is in another language, so I have to translate it from english cos I probably already have it in my stash.
---
The actual reason this is happening isn't changing over time - it's simple:
---
As to their OP defense:, they're using duped sentinel/assassin armor, reducing their damage close to zero. The only solution is to stagger them (disabling the sentinel effect) and/or deal other kinds of damage and/or drain their AP so they can't vats (cryo and plasma grenades but more importantly: a fast fire rifle w/Tank Killer or quad shotgun w/Enforcer). The same basic principle applies to people using cavaliers - steal their AP so they can't sprint and stagger them. Also: serendipity to reduce damage, and possibly dodgy (but only for those who don't need their AP for VATS).
---
As to their OP offense: most of them are using the same tactics I described above, some coupled (of course) with bloodied builds to push up damage. Most are also probably spec'd into all the relevant damage perks - e.g. for automatic rifles, at least one of each commando card plus tank killer plus non-weapon-specific cards like tenderizer, bloody messy, four leaf clover and better criticals (for VATS crits). Base weapons are often very good, like bloodied or anti-armor explosive shotguns and handmades, but really, even with a simpler weapon if you're taking so little damage you can kill most things.
---
I have a sentinel armor set I've cobbled together over time - nothing duped or traded - and I thought it  was going to be horrible because it's just a mess of nocturnal and ghoul slayer's and other crappy pieces, not even heavy in most cases. But when I started doing testing, well, it makes you all but unkillable except against a team using the same armor. Suddenly, my high-end metal bolstering/vanguard felt super squishy. IMHO, sentinel/assassin needs a nerf.
---
Let me get this straight, the guy tried to fuck the imposter (assaultron) and then got killed by it..
---
The person who wanted to introduce repair kits.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought but I get an ‚Äòunaccessible‚Äô notice
---
Are you sure? I was selling things to vendors in less than 20hours window.
---
Free ammo and rad-free food can be pretty convenient.
---
nope but the modders will.
---
I was thinking about that today when I got .50 cal reciever for a hubting rifle. The Anti-Material rifle was so much fun in NV
---
Np, lots of people mix up the 2 receivers. If you get a standard 50 cal receiver it will deal the same amount of damage as the best 308 receiver. 
---
Serverhopping at harper's ferry is how i usually get my receivers.
---
What I meant is making the .50 Cal MG (Not LMG) be able to feed .308 as well with a different receiver, would be useful if you don't want to spend your entire ammo in 20 seconds.
---
Scorchbeasts are not classified as scorched, so those would work only on mobs which u can oneshot with any weapon at cap level.  Also new event have only robot enemies and new raids wouln't have scorched as enemies too i belive. Not worth to adjust Scorchkiller receivers, but you have nice point.
---
Seriously? Not likely.
---
New Vegas was the best place for that to be played with, and they didn't.
---
For shits and giggles? I don't remember seeing any Dalmatians in Vault 101 either.
---
Love this idea, than i can finally switch weapons between my melee and rifleman.
---
My god. TIL
---
it's the Monster Mash event at Watoga High School (right next to the train station)
---
Monster mash, inside Watoga School
---
Keys are in the sinked safe in toxic valley, near the boat where the blaster is.
---
&gt; When you click play you are assigned a server instance and then it checks to make sure you can join it.
---
It does, but it's not doing that check on the host, I don't think. The matchmaking server tracks that itself. 
---
I am open to the idea I'm totally wrong, but I don't see any hint the matchmaking and hosts are in any way linked beyond simple tracking. Tracking which user is connected to which host isn't something that checks on what's happening on a host. And nothing else in the matchmaking checks the state of the world.
---
I loved to run a high Int build in the other FO's because it actually did give you better options ( or different ones) when interacting.
---
That out of the way, 5 points are max ( because makeshift warrior).
---
It's a pitty.
---
Also crap because you don't want to invest points, as you will eventually Just find legend√§re weapons that are groundbreakers.
---
I feel you should always have an advantage if you craft over anything you find.
---
But perhaps this changes a bit with the legendary vendor.
---
Or the popular. I don‚Äôt care about other people mentality.
---
Some enemies are too tough so the workshop requires level 2 turrets, which require power. Hence it adds up to have a good defence in place, plus locks also need the resources (screw. great) so they don't get stolen by visitors. At the end of the day we shouldn't be limiting ourselves how to play a game, because it's unstable.
---
This event reminds me Raid Finder in WoW. Bunch of clueless people who didn't bother to read 4 lines of text, run around when Iam forced to do the mechanics ...
---
Okey thanks
---
i hae seen them on xbox from 100-200 nothing higher than that.
---
There are many enemies that are scorched. Scorch death claw, scorched mirelark queen, scorched wendigo. It's not just scorched humans. Also I aim to help players get a more unique experience in the game. Did you know that the scorchkiller mod lets you fire blue? It's very visually appealing (objectively obviously). So it can provide good usage as a side weapon that you can use exclusively to kill scorched enemies. I do thank you though for reading my post and liking it :)
---
Hopefully i got a blueprint for one!
---
I just keep dying just before it does, it dies while i'm on the respawn screen, see a group of players celebrating when i spawn back and i cant find the sheepsquatch body to loot cause everyone fast travels out when i start to get close, happened to me twice now, frustrating as hell
---
I would of expected a 1\* hunters item since my account is seeded for that to be priority drop for everything, but ghoul slayer is close enough.
---
Far too much work for a simple item adding.
---
I wish they would do something like that. Removing slap damage because of griefers was a good move. However, when i see people doing this it makes me wish i could still hit them for some damage.....just to say , hey, get the hell outta here!
---
Wait so if you have 2 artillery guns and you throw one flare both fire?
---
I do remember hearing a rumor that greenhouses were plausible dlc/content add in the tail end of the year. I‚Äôll
---
most paid 60bucks (i did on launch) it wasnt worht that before, but I do think its getting there now. I would still look for a cheaper one somewhere
---
mh that's weird, i think you are experiencing a bug. Because you're supposed to be ALWAYS able to access the tattoo parlor, no matter the daily quest reset timer.
---
Seems like the game doesnt know you completed the nukashine quest yet. Because that's the only reason for the UNACCESSIBLE door.
---
Rather than server hopping, try to reboot everything, consolle, pc, router... I hope you manage to fix it. Or wait for tomorrow's patch.
---
I would also give a try to get into PI house in morgantown (where the nukashine quest starts), and see what happens.
---
&gt;the Brotherhood didn't start using that tier of armor plus color scheme until almost 200 years later
---
That logic doesn't really work with this company. There are Mariposa super mutants running around in West Virginia 100 years before their creation in California. They retconned the BoS lore to make them fit into this game, despite it not making a very large amount of sense, and they also added the Enclave even though they don't leave their Oil Rig for another few decades.
---
You can go visit anytime. You just can't get quests.
---
It's a shame that damage scaling probably makes that second shot less noticeable since it counts as an independent projectile.
---
Wow thanks for that. The video was great!
---
Yes my CAMP is called "Parasite City"
---
Even that was kind of dumb, [known] plans should be at the bottom. Why clutter the top two thirds of the post with stuff I don‚Äôt want to buy?
---
Hopefully you will be able to freeze the actual sheepsquatch too
---
I still didnt go to crashed UFO, I assume you can get the key there?
---
Could just set a timer on your phone if you have one. Way easier to manage.
---
Thanks, but as I don't have the time to sit behind my console all day, unlike you, there is no way I could have known.
---
I think it's first sell now for vendors. I'm definitely not having to wait 24 hours for Biv. That's why I thought it was the 20.
---
Yeah, best to walk into that event with nothing, and come out with something
---
In the very least group up for shared stims/freebie revives perk, and etc
---
I'd love this :)
---
That too, there are plenty of selfish a-holes in this game using the weak excuse of...
---
‚ÄòI‚Äôm role playing a raider‚Äô
---
Cool
---
That and having a 3rd grade reading level. Like the game tells you what do.
---
So, you want a prime receiver then?
---
Without the rads there's nothing to power the special side effects of the food,
---
Obviously if it looks like you‚Äôre going to run out of time for whatever reason then by all means jump on the instruments but yes ultimately you want the event to run for the longest possible time for the maximum number of spawns
---
Raiders get my furious laser rifle to eyes. One thing I noticed is a lot people aren‚Äôt build energy Resistance. Especially the sentinel blah blah blah builds.
---
no clue, but probably. only thing that i've been able to find is what todd said during PAX east where we trade them in for tokens or something that allows us to "reroll" for effects.
---
im a melee first/ non auto rifles 2nd build, I have weapons artisan max, makeshift warrior at 4 and gunsmith at 3 and I can go 1 week maybe a little more without having to repair them. I do play 3 to 4 a hours a day, 3 or 4 days a week tho RL get on the way. I aslo farm nukes/SBQ/events when im on, so i would say 80% of my play time is killing stuff.
---
Not yet but soon (tm)
---
All the things we‚Äôve taken for granted through fallout games stripped away with fallout 76 there must be a reason for it server side.
---
That's actually a very bad idea.
---
the main reason i feel (but could be wrong) a lot of ‚Äúdisplay‚Äù features were taken out were potential for duping glitches (or more of them anyone lol) or a glitch where players could steal other players displayed objects. in any matter it is bethesda‚Äôs job to figure out how to make it work so... fingers crossed
---
I bring up prime receivers here. Also prime receivers require flux ammo, thus making them harder to maintain than scorch killer mods which don't take special ammo.
---
Seems to appear only during a nearby event. Heart of the Swamp, I think.
---
The cynic in would would say I‚Äôd imagine they wouldn‚Äôt want to put the effort in.
---
You forgot the "/s".
---
Let me guess.  You had a bitch base behind the WS gold club ?
---
or Yulai for us oldies
---
The patch notes also specified that semi-auto weapons were increased by 2x, not including auto. I guess it's speculation, but it seems to me they would have had to increase it more to avoid them breaking much faster.
---
This and the Scorchbeast attacks are hell for migraine sufferers like myself
---
The Scorch Killer works on the Scorched, as in, the zombies. Not on other scorched animals.
---
Yup, takes a few weeks, 4Gb patch and breaks a bunch of other stuff....but okay.
---
I was disappointed the unique binoculars don't let you track it while it's being sneaky.
---
but hey i get to show off my overpriced outfits!
---
I'm running with 8 fully modded handmades (legendary versus types). 8 x 22 = 160 lbs right there. AK 47 weighs 12-14 lbs IRL.
---
So people aren't allowed to disagree with someone? What are you
---
i would try to add bloody mess, tenderizer, tank killer, adrenal mutation to start, but you have others that will definetly help but you would have to make some QoL sacrifices.
---
Source?
---
Are you properly logging out?
---
Noticed that if I quit to desktop, that the server remembers all the stuff I picked up, even the next day.
---
In game files.
---
put a floor down on both side off the wall and you should be able to turn it the way you want it no problem. yeah it takes and extra step but it is what it is.
---
don't get it if you're a sneak build though, it sucks.
---
Got a furious + fast molerat gauntlet.
---
Tested the DMG potential to 300 - 500+ -ish. I haven't tested it on a sentinel OP person, but I chewed two players, looted and left before he could auto-rifle me.
---
Only viable strat for me.
---
How many?
---
Its a known issue, devs are aware.
---
a melee build could fit pretty well with the character idea, maybr unarmed. i can imagine a deathclaw gauntlet on someone who loves nature since it‚Äôs basically just bone and deathclaw gauntlets are pretty good end game weapons, like even if you‚Äôre not going for a bloodied and with an instigating deathclaw gauntlet and the right build you can one shot almost anything except the end game bosses
---
They could make static mannequins for every outfit, but only the ones you own are available in the building menu. From the looks of it I think the real reason is that camp building just wasn't much of a priority in 76 either. Which is strange considering they must have realized how essential it turned out to be for a lot of Fallout 4 players and that they underestimated it's potential.
---
No matter how many times I do it I still fuck up the clicks... NO I WANT TO REPAIR THE ITEM!
---
Just one lol never mind though I just got one from someone else
---
Worse yet, without the ability to see condition after the first!
---
i definitely agree with you on that. coming over from fallout 4 to 76‚Äôs camp building there are some improved aspects for sure such as the workshop being a little more forgiving, but the number of structures limited just sucks. where are my big damn barn doors?!
---
I play in the game on xbox and I can definetly say it is not dead. 90% of the time I want to play with some frineds I have to wait to login. where did you get this from?
---
There is also paladin which is basically the same as officer and elder which is shit
---
Had a same incident last night, I was doing uranium fever alone until these two high level guys come in and kill all the terminated managers without letting me get a hit.They were spamming TSE shotguns. At one point I got knocked, and did the help emote and all they proceeded to do was loot around me before taking all my junk once I died. I sent the guy who took my loot a message asking for my junk back and I got back was ‚ÄòNoooo‚Äô. So I tried engag√© pvp with them but the pussies had pacifist, and quickly left the server. It‚Äôs a shame because that‚Äôs the first bad experience I‚Äôve had in 250 hours
---
"BUY MY REPAIR KITS".

Man, they really don't know anything make an online RPG or just bunch of trolls are working on their department.
---
Purified water should be able to produce 2 boiled water for the cost of 1 wood.
---
excellent!
---
You should get 10 Atoms for that.
---
Put your settings on the lowest they will go until you finish the event, or hang out in the area for a bit.  It pops constantly during prime time, just server hop till you get it done if you have this error.
---
It's such an odd decision, isn't it?  I'm fine with not having a preview, but why on Earth change to key?
---
Heh.  Yes.  They're the only things I've named, but so worth it.
---
Greenthump, animal &amp; Wasteland creature friend, scrapper, really nearly every team card, all the disease resistent cards.
---
Melee with gauntlet and the right melee perks
---
Armor chameleon or weightless ( this really depends in Playstyle and mutations)
---
I am playing a witch, know every recipe and brew the hell out of them.
---
I can help
---
Same here. Plus I can't repair my 3* Grognak axe anymore. It's just not there when opening the workbench
---
Troubleshoots prefix help with this?
---
Check the Map for player locations, visit Train Stations, Red Rockets... 
---
Go to where the people are!
---
Well at least they listened, right?
---
And a beer.
---
The same person that felt you were enjoying swapping all your perks every time you repaired something at a workbench.
---
welcome to slot machine 76 ,enjoy your stay
---
if you complain you will get people that say that you want the game to be easy lol
---
Yeah I have a same problem. The fuck they smoke in there...
---
Someone needs a nice refreshing Nukacola and a bowl of nutritious Sugar BOMBS!  (now with more sugar!) to start their day off right!
---
I tried to get hold of that flower to craft them for my bar for a while but I had to give up. It was even more sad due to pickaxe being one of the only two light up signs that's available in the atom shop. Having that I do want to offfer them too.
---
Really great that they changed it!
---
Mothman is a demon of the night, a false God and will be punished for his crimes against humanity. I will slay him and all those that oppose the Almighty Father!
---
Not only the creative people being laid off--they'll just stop making those games.  The Fallout series will be deemed not profitable and they'll put their money on other franchises that may not be as good.
---
 lets face it the game is easy, and yet you still want it easier. whats next you want the xp too even tho you didnt kill it. 
---
man the ME ME ME ME ME post are on a all time high here.
---
Think it's sorted by weight now, luckily my mates a big lad :)
---
I think that the spawns are rotating locations. I would get plans and a bobble head every other time I went up north to the crosshairs. Now it‚Äôs been a week.....nothing
---
the loot system is worse than even wow  battle for azeroth and whats even sadder is that people defend it,after 5 months they finally announce the first dungeon for the game,LIKE WTF THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE AT LAUNCH
---
Just place water purtifier with concrete bottom in any dirt.
---
This is even after you have logged off? Strange I have made 6 different characters all max at different times of the game and never encountered this. But I find that some bugs are unique to some people.
---
this is because the game to this day lacks any form of gear progression,bethesda NEEDS to add dungeons and raids for people to farm for gear not RNG stacked on RNG with even more RNG to get a piece of gear that is good for you
---
Many times when you fight SBQ megasloth spawn around. But when i was walking around trying to find one, i had no luck.
---
Quad and instigating are definitely my favorite. :) Armor wise Vanguard and +50% Durability.
---
So no pre-built purifiers like the Charleston landfill?
---
I believe water &amp; crops have increased production, so you'll have to plant crops &amp; build water filters.
---
I still wouldn't be happy if they're available in the atom store at all, but considering the basic ones are atom shop only and the only free options are dropped from enemies guaranteed to break your weapons (and thus make their drops pointless for anyone with the repair perks in the first place), having the basic ones be a common daily reward would definitely be at least SLIGHTLY better.
---
Glad we could come to an understanding.
---
true
---
boxes,bins,suitcases etc  all empty. And i have not found an abraxo in a week.seems like crafting components have taken a nerf. I understand the server recources are finite,but please Bethesda, if your going to make balance changes, give us the small print.
---
The UI needs a total overhaul
---
Dyer chemicals at the base of the trees in the river....watch out for the gulpers tho.
---
I‚Äôve been server hopping for officer plans and this one Assaultron gets so defensive when I go near a spawn point for these plans, the other time it was a couple protectrons during a fight with a schorchbeast that turned up during one of the Enclave events
---
It's just that us building nuts want to build as big as you can and not waste budget on turrets. I only have one at my CAMP and it's helping out with catching the dinner mirelurks that always appear when I spawn or run back home.
---
oh nice, did you just keep server hopping ?
---
Okay, thanks for the help üëç
---
A high intelligence also raise your weapon and armor durability. With 10 Int and the perk cards for it i have 2 bars of ''health'' on my weapon and especially power armor. I can sit under a SQB for hours and nothing breaks.
---
With a high perception you can see players miles away from you even if they are behind a hill or behind a object. This is valuable because most of the time you cant see players names or their position on the compass with a low perception build. Stealthed people are also visible as soon they are moving and they stay visible afterwards as long as you look in their direction. Chameleon visuals still work if they stand still, but it should be already to late and you V.a.t.s. em dead. This is pretty much a Pvp stat to kill all the stealth builds 90% of Players use. Berry Mentats is just the cherry on top.

Yes it is, if you die during an event you get reset. Same thing with the sheepsquatch event. If you die and you're unable to hit the imposter again before it dies you don't get credit for it.
---
Have seen one in between Rob-co and Generals Steakhouse. Would be close to border of the Bog but should count.
---
Yep I found a fab location overlooking Whitespring, but every time I came back there were Supermutants inside waiting to kill me...I have now moved further down the range.
---
hotfix after the update, maybe had something to do with it.
---
I actually got 3 Zealot Gatlings in 1 server....2 at Whitespring and one elsewhere....one was a 2\* at least..

You will pay atoms straight up. Workbench repair and repair kit are literally just a title for junk or atoms. You aren't going to have to goto the atom store to buy a repair kit, you'll be able to purchase them straight from the inspection screen. The same way when you're building in your camp they have all of the atomic shop items you don't have as an option. If you click one a little screen pops up saying "purchase for 600 atoms?" My point is they changed the repair to make you see the repair kit option every single time you repair.
---
True that. Powering it up is the cheapest way to get the fusion generator.
---
It might be the dropped connection event if you have done the enclave stuff.

Thanks a lot, I had to server-hop just once and checked less than 6 spawn to get it !

That's where I've been the last couple of months for my main character. I think mirelurks tastes like big lobsters. That's what I hope at least...
---
OP is basically asking for pacifist mode to apply to enemies. Where are we drawing the line between QoL changes and entitlement seeking? This is part of the game. It's a hostile environment and you have to defend from it.

Possible VATs, also I'm not sure if there is any current FPS bugs presently active.
---
VATs is a obvious easy cheese for ranged players, but of course countered by Invisibility.
---
There could also be any perk that increase effectiveness of a very specific strategy of course to quickly dispatch players.
---
Thanks for tips guys seems a well communicating team is a key requirement here with some perks/weapon advise to take on board. To ReddiTimH if you or anyone else pulls this off as a one man job my hats off to you! As others mentioned once your a conduit even in high lvl power armour you can be taken out with a couple of slaps from this beast...

nope , not done any enclave as yet,and its been there for 3 sessions

Now imagine a camp loading bug/glitch and you loose that 20k caps Leather Coat.....mmmmmh, i prefer having them in my stash

I was accurate in my assessment, no need to be protective of an idiot with nothing useful to say. Like yourself.

Calling someone out for a stupid and pointless comment that does no benefit isn‚Äôt defensive. Kind of like telling YOU not to make stupid quips isn‚Äôt either

I found some gulpers, is it a random spawn?

&gt;so let‚Äôs say you just completed the BOS quest line and got you self a fresh suit of ultracite power armor but you want the plan though

Ultracite PA plans are at a BOS terminal. Just like X-01

Yea, no wonder it's random, everything in this game is

I was using a 1080Ti and a 7700K prior the my pc ugrade. I can‚Äôt remember what frames were my lowest and highest, but I do remember a lot of dips. 
---
Have you locked your framerate? If so, what are you playing at? 
---
Yesterday I was in whitesprings and as I crossed the golf courses I was doing a solid 22 fps for more than 5+ minutes. 
---
I‚Äôm also playing at 1440p, both on the old and new rig.
---
No idea. I was prepared to give the game a second chance but if this is all they've managed after 6 months then I'm not optimistic about this game lasting much longer.
---
You have zero credibility. Backtracking and irrelevant videos. If she was so easily soloable, you would've done it. Getting back to the real point, none of these are videos are claiming she takes more ammo, nor are all the videos even solo.

Learn to give up. You've lost completely.

Some peeps still have their turret camps placed slap bang outside the back door of the club.  Seeing as we can‚Äôt actually have a turd in a flaming bag, I‚Äôm now placing 1 spolied meat and a Molotov right outside their door and hope they have the intelligence to get the gist.

i was, last 2 days thats all I sold the stash I had for the vendor.

The Enclave retcon doesn't bother me as much as some of the other's. I think it makes sense that there would be multiple hidden bunkers that the pre war government would use, especially on the East coast where most of the federal government is located generally. While the highest ranking memebers went to the oil rig, others could have gone to the whitesprings, especially since the real world equivalent is/was set up to be a bunker for the federal government

Oh thanks

Reminds me of going round in circles following the quest diamond for the ruined skyscraper mission in FO4.  The pathing to quests doesn‚Äôt seemed to have improved. It‚Äôs almost as if they‚Äôve used the same game engine from FO4, surely not ? üòÇüòÇ

get someone to hold him on place and server hop. On every login he will have different outfits for sale.

I would love that idea ( speciall stash box with maybe 100pounds) to transfer among you other accounts should be good enough. it surely would beat doing it with a friend or having to jump on 2 xboxs to transfer stuff
---
But wouldn't you need to grind for coal to smelt the ore?

Nobody uses it for filters, so I can see Bethesda doing something else with it instead.

Handy tip, but will eat budget fast if you have a bunch of plants.

Sadly, if one wants them in *Handmade*s, that still a [hundreds](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=51003341) of legendaries to kill.
---
I have to say... This dlc felt like more of the same flat storytelling. I struggled to get into it and there is still no real or meaningful interaction between the player and the game world. I would hardly call a series of "go here, read that" or "go here, search that" objectives a "QUEST". 
---
The plot was interesting enough, but I'm sure I'm not the only one who felt deflated after playing it...
---
PS for PA users: Do the Mistress of mystery questline, and convert stealth boys into phantom devices. They work while in PA.

That's price bot, fast kill him, before he gives you 100 pre-war money.

Downvoting because I‚Äôve had my camps repeatedly trashed.
---
It‚Äôs not at WS or near a spawn resource or noteworthy location.

Assholes will find it, feel entitled to break into and destroy stuff.
---
But it isn‚Äôt high tech. The computers are massive and shitty. Even the monochrome pipboy only has 64k (according to Fallout 4).
---
Managed to catch him on a friends server and do this. Had the same thing twice then the server crashed.
---
For this to be a lasting multiplayer game, they need to have more than two challenging battles.  I'd like to see dungeons, for both teams and single players, that take hours to beat...after failing a dozen or so times.  Most of the current game is just there to scratch an OCD itch.
---
Good to know it's not me. This has been really bugging me
---
I believe the lode baring tokens are just for random ore. Amount you get depends on which amount you turn in
---
I had just completed the encriptid event for the first time when it said my camp was under attack. I couldn't find the body to loot and their bounty kept going up, so I had to leave without getting my loot to go deal with them.
---
I killed them over and over and they kept seeking revenge. I must have killed them 7 times before they gave up.
---
Oh yeah you getting your wild applicahia on right.
---
I was tempted to reinstall but after this post I‚Äôm completely against it now. I play on PS4 and that used to consistently crash to the point it was unplayable - I‚Äôm expecting the same thing. Really doesn‚Äôt seem like the devs care about this game üíî
---
If that's the case then this helps a lot, I keep spawning inside rocks
---
Happens with the Phantom Machines too, (Mistress of Mystery questline)
---
Bulking only helps with aluminum and lead anyway, everything else it has no effect on weight and i believe some stuff weighs more

Yes I did. Ran north of the spawn for several seconds and bam, Megasloth!

nice camp.

Robots outside of Watoga do remain hostile. Though robots *within* shouldn't

Oh, I see! I too sometimes wish I could have one more C.A.M.P., maybe smaller in size and be moved around easily... My C.A.M.P. is too big now,  settled on cliff side and not designed to move. Vending machine coming in May would bring a total change in economy in Appalachia. Looking forward to it.
---
Just happened to me today. Lost all of my junk. So happy I moved my flux to my stash the day before.
---
I'm on PC and although the stability is better nothing of substance has been done to improve the base game.
---
But it doesn't even have to be good sentinel gear, level 5 wooden pieces would work. I've seen garbage sentinel pieces in vendors at train stations people sell to them.
---
Best armor? Dude any type of sentinel armor works, even level 5 wooden pieces would work. You can easily find those, hell I found pieces of garbage sentinel gear for sale at venders because no one cares about low level sentinel pieces.
---
I know arseholes exist but there‚Äôs no way you have to rebuild every day u less you‚Äôre at whitesprings.
---
Yep.  Another new bug.  Pretty cool stuff.
---
Stash your damn junk. 
---
I've never understood how this concept is so baffling to all y'all who drop sooooo many things and then come here complaining.
---
If anyone thought for a second 20 players were just gotta walk around nice and calm trying to find "their" deathbag, while leaving all the other free shit on the ground....you need more human interaction cause that's not how the species works. üòê
---
99% of the posts on this sub qualify as that.  Literally the same shit being said over and over.  Maybe one post every 48 hours actually contributes something new and not already discussed to death.
---
The matchmaking has to check multiple states of the world due to things like occupancy and if there are any currently blocked players on their server or if you are a blocked player of someone on the server.
---
I'm hording outfits in hope of this.
---
You can not do any of the things you are suggesting.  Road blocks? What game are you playing, the zone the camp is allowed to occupy and the mandatory space between player camps completely prevents anyone from blocking access to anything ever - most places this could even be attempted have huge zones around them preventing camps.
---
You can never be trapped in this game.  Switch servers.  Not to mention what would have to happen for you to stand around long enough to get "trapped" by a player that could actively keep you in combat to prevent FT...
---
The utter nonsense of your post astounds me.
---
Understand why you say that as it's a constant frustration when the server disconnects you. However, trying to log back in and find a server where both CAMP and Workshop(s) can be placed is probably asking a lot in some instances (depends on the popularity of your CAMP spot).
---
Placement of turrets: if all else fails pop them on top of the extractors which protects from most melee and animal attacks. They get shot at from long range regardless.
---
That explains a lot. I typically avoid Watoga, even though I did complete mayor for a day, so the robots don't shoot at me. Too easy to get caught unprepared in a scorch beast fight.
---
He just wants lamp
---
One would think a short cookie message would suffice...
---
Also if they are going to sell stairs for real money they should make this small QOL improvement.
---
They've know about the quest bug for months and chose to let one spawn at the new hotspot for server hopping. It's really on them for not thinking this through (or fixing the bug).
---
If brick buildings in the game would be damaged and destroyed I would agree, but It's only the brick buildings that players live in that can be destroyed. Why? If I had the choice in real life I would just remove the planks boarding them up and move into one of the pre war buildings. We don't get that choice in the game but have to build our own house. In FO4 the walls you built couldn't be destroyed. They were made this way it was said to prevent players from building walls around other players to trap them. That was easily prevented by fast travelling or server hopping. Now we get walls that can't be destroyed by players and the reason to let them be destroyed is removed. They could as well be invulnerable to NPC as well as they are in FO4 and all the other walls in the game are. There's no logical reason to make them destructable. Have you managed to destroy any fusion generator that's already in the game? Why should ours be?
---
I think the only things that need to be possible to destroy are the same things as in the world at lage: turrets and defenses.
---
Indeed. Like most websites do.
---
Plash generic stash boxes as a turret base. They seem to place much easier than turrets, and you can     make "towers" high enough to protect the turrets from wolves, rats, and moles.
---
me best
---
me smash
---
It's probably rather random, but I just completed a One Violent Night event (at the Sons of Dane compound), and killing the crowned feral ghouls dropped anywhere from one to three stimpaks. Plus I got a few for completing the event. Think I walked away with around 15 more stimpaks total. This likely isn't a consistent way to do it, but if you see the event pop up, it couldn't hurt to give it a go!
---
Well for me when i reached max caps my desire to play the game went away slowly, i tried going on a new character but eeeh and instead i tried to become a vendor to buy as much ad i want and be able to get it back fast but now i have alot of trouble with my inventory. Always full of blood packs and stims and since i have no friends to help me swap it to my mules well i havent played the game since. Even as of right now im playing mkxl
---
I was just kidding. But you know, they knew about duping for months too.
---
Farming west-tek on survival server with 2x XP weekend.
---
Always crystallizing.
---
Too situational, but thank you. I need a method I can do all of this week
---
Yup, I always close out completely when I'm done playing for the day. My routine has been the same for a couple months with no issues, don't know why the sudden development... though I suspect it has something to do with recent maintenance downtime that happened on the 11th, a couple days after the 9th patch.
---
Tasty eye beans
---
If you look, there's actually a few dirt piles inside you can drop a small purifier or crops on. I've used them for a few marathon defense sessions.
---
They are heading into the right direction (i think) but they are moving a bit slow. They do listen to the community and make improvements based on our feedback, that is very important, though many things we've asked should have been in the game since early days, not 6 months later. There is little end-game content and now they made daily challenges even more difficult and it makes me not wanna log in and do them anymore.
---
Oh snap! That's cool to know. :)
---
I have orig PS4 and game don't crash at all. They did one hell of job in terms of stability. Fallout is way smoother than apex for example.
---
yeah and the worst part about it is now low level player deal more damage to high level players
---
You can buy the paint from Chad too.
---
But you only get  the weight bonus with the full set.
---
I've never once had my CAMP purposely attacked by someone. (Well, someone other than a friend of mine who nuked it as a joke). Right now, I have my CAMP behind the Morgantown Station. I have it there for low level players who come through the area. This way, I can give them supplies I don't have any need for and maybe help them out against the Scorched in the area.
---
Never had my CAMP destroyed. The only times I've heard of players getting their CAMPs destroyed are if they are either on the Whitesprings, in range of ghoul spawns, or next to random encounter spawns, as CAMPs there block the spawns.
---
Pair it with sentinel or cavalier and you‚Äôll be just fine.
---
Unfortunately, my build doesn't allow me to carry too many guns so i only get my good ones which one-shot mobs. Sometimes during certain events i try to punch the mobs or pickup some random gun but it doesn't always work.
---
At a PA station
---
Facts of the situation is you keep sharing your unwanted input, that‚Äôs sad.
---
Demolition, Stability - major int perks for heavy gun builds.
---
I've successfully trap killed in this game, and have posted both the method and camp itself, and without camp damage there would be no way out besides quitting. 
---
Bethesda went on record saying the reason for camp damage and location restriction was to prevent player trapping and objective blocking. 
---
As for my wall of whitesprings example, in the divide there's plenty of tight passes that would be easily blocked forcing other players to go large distances to go around. The area around big bend tunnel is a perfect example. Place a camp down the road from the freak show and block passage all the way up the mountain. Having to quit and restart in order to keep playing is more immersion breaking than having your house able to be damaged in an apocalypse/ survival game.
---
Yes! Agreed. The amount of times I spawn in a nukezone and die instantly is ridiculous
---
If it were some indie game I'd be so much more understanding. The energy required right now just to manage inventory and plus the added ammo burn, gun damage and fusion core burn takes any fun I've had in the game go away quickly.
---
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who is way more annoyed by this than I should be. Also the fact that I have to hit a different button to access my stash is way more annoying than it should be too
---
I have never had that issue with anything, over 1k hours played.
---
There are 5 different ones if i remember correctly, and if you include the wise Mothman from the event
---
It‚Äôs really hard pressing an extra button
---
Every time for me, almost the same 1k hours played. Many SBQ runs iv died at the last second and missed out of her loot. Sucks big time.
---
And? It wouldn't be an issue if the repair kits weren't being added to the Atom Shop. Even if they weren't added to the atom shop, they would still have made this change. You people are focusing on the wrong aspect of the repair kits.
---
Completely wrong. Because you dont complete the event
---
That's because they nerfed pretty much everything. From guns damage to armor durability perks (wtf???), now they even made it so that you can't sell your inert flux to not make caps too fast.
---
This would also make it possible to have a stair, in the middle of my house, that's not surrounded by that stupid mesh floor.
---
No seriously can you explain why it‚Äôs such a big deal? I honestly don‚Äôt get understand not trying to be rude
---
Yeah, I made a post asking for a weekly suggestion thread to filter out these redundant requests, but it didn't get any traction. There was an over 1k post the other day requesting displayable power armor, something the devs already said they would like to do eventually. It's honestly on the mods to fix though, which seem to be almost non-existent.
---
Yeah, world spawns are definitely not guaranteed. This, for me, is cap stashes spawning but acting like I just looted them within the last 24hr when it's been 3 days now. Same thing with other world items I'm farming.
---
One example: I'm farming the handmade rifle for mods that I found reliably spawns in a spot. I loot it and nearby ammo containers. Days go by and no rifle but also the nearby ammo containers are still empty too. Things seem to refuse to reset.
---
Love those light weight  3*s trash. People sell them all the time btw.
---
Let‚Äôs agree to disagree and just let Bethesda decide where the line between QoL and frivolous entitlements is
---
Coming at every engagement with the exact same tactics seems like it would be incredibly boring.
---
Farm west tech
---
Seems like west-tek is the go to. Okay thanks :)
---
I've had good groups and bad groups. I chow energy damage reduction food before the event which seems to help on taking the pylons. 
---
I've gotten 3* and 2* loot as well as 1*. Once we couldn't find the body. The best item was an unyielding sentinel arm.
---
Where's this loot?  I'm approaching it.  Hey!  I've gone past it!  Turn around.  Ok, getting nearer, but still can't see it.  Damn gone past it again.  Look all around, can't see it.  Stare up in the air in exasperation.  Is it a bird!  Is it a plane!  Is it superman!  No, it's my fucking loot, nearly in orbit.
---
I may give it another go... I just don‚Äôt want to come back to empty servers and what have you. Has that been your experience?
---
No, there's a quest/event for getting them to spawn at Dyer Chemical, but they can spawn outside of it in the same river, but only at night. It's not always guaranteed they'll be there though.
---
I never keep my ammo in my stash and its always full lel
---
Got him yesterday and he died about 30 seconds later.  There was a holotape on him about the bots being tampered with.  Then I crashed.

Survival servers were death before last patch, but on adventure there are still loads of servers ready for serverhoping. Many people leaved, but comunity is still alive.

Before suggest somewhere, can you tell me your build please?
---
Very good :)
---
oh yeah that‚Äôs what i do now. in PA i can melee 3 or 4 hits on it before it kills me. and hopefully keep its aggro focused on me so the snipers on the roof get a few shots in.
---
Definately. It's not me downvoting your comment. I have no problem with different opinions. I just stated mine.
---
Oxhorn regularly DMCA's videos and channels criticizing him.

If he's not a shill then why is he so afraid of people saying he is?
---
*Waaah I have to press extra buttons!* Naming your weapons is worth it. It‚Äôs fun!
---
&gt; Maybe it can't be done yet for the same reason we can't place objects onto other objects?
---
What...? Plenty of items can stack on top of other items... 
---
There were functional planters in fallout 4, or that was a mod at least. It's definitely quite doable either way. Hell, the campfire for whatever reason acted as ground for placing crops and foundations.
---
You can get raider plans from treasure maps and t-45/51b/60 PA plans from distant thunder events. They are rare though.
---
Ah brilliant thank you! I‚Äôm wondering if my problem was/is related to using PS4 Pro...
---
I was victim of a Scorchbeast attack and as I have Aquaboy perk I dived in the nearby lake and went underwater. I could tell it was still attacking me but the effects were minimal. Would seem therefore that water does help in that scenario. No idea whether it saves you from bullets though.
---
Why would they change something that was not broken as if the game does not have enough time consuming aspects they have now made repairing your equipment far to complicated
---
Bethesda why are you messing with the loyal players who stayed with the game should you not be promoting the game to get more players instead of trying to make people want to quit the game
---
None of the things you've listed are part of the world state... It knows who is on each server, but it doesn't know where on the map they are or agar they're doing. All of the matchmaking information is kept on the matchmaking server, not the world host.   
---
Think of the matchmaking server as phone book. It can direct you to an address, and you let them know when you move, so they can update the records. But the phone book doesn't actually know what's happening inside any given address.   
---
As I suggested above you could start including camp details in the information being fed back to the matchmaking server, but that comes with the risks I suggested about (mainly double the load on matchmaking).
---
I was there yesterday and all the robots were attacking it. They weren't doing a lot of damage, but they at least kept it from attacking me
---
The player object associated with the matchmaker has a location associated to the camp. Since the matchmaker already knows what players are in the world it also knows where the location for the camps for those players is. Doing a quick bounds check on a server of at max 24 people will not slow down the matchmaking much at all.
---
Nope.  Induction furnace.  Runs off electricity.
---
Yes. I have a round I go. I used to do it daily and it would have spawned, but lately there might be one or two out of more than ten that has respawned. Most cap stashes turn up empty still after one or more days.
---
That‚Äôs not me doing yours, that‚Äôs just how this subreddit works. I can‚Äôt think of many subs that are quite as obtuse as this one
---
200 atoms would be a fair price for stuff like this. It'll be 800 or 1200.
---
That's not correct.
---
Biv's quests reset at 8 PM eastern EXACTLY  everyday.
---
It's not a 20 hour timer like other things in this game.
---
Thanks
---
I am pretty sure that a lot of people even doesnt give a f\*\* of pylons and wait.
---
I usually directly go to one pylon, and if I die, nobody replace me ever, I have to go back to one pylon each time.
---
Pretty pathetic I would say.
---
That would be totally sweet. I mean, badass.  That won't be totally badass.
---
Unless they solved it since, mannequins are stationary NPCs that, at least in skyrim, sometimes started walking around. 
---
That'd probably be really frequent in 76.
---
Thanks I‚Äôll google it.
---
That‚Äôs been an issue since the beta, at least for me. If it‚Äôs sorted in any way, it gets jumpy when interacted with. But then I think I had the same bug in FO4, so it‚Äôs annoying but not that surprising.
---
If they made them part of you build limit, then they would be like furniture, and other players can't nick that. Maybe? But I don't think they'd make stealable Armour Racks, no one would ever use them. XD
---
Try going for a fun but challenging build, staying away from anything too high power. I'm currently doing a PA unarmed build and it has brought my will to play back. It can be very costly to completely change your stuff up and once you hit that moment where the stupid build starts to work it is so fun. Currently beating the shit out of most enemies if I don't fuck up and having almost as much fun as I had starting, I recommend it.
---
That's a good point, didn't consider that.
---
I got 1K at the moment. Im selling at a 1:1 ratio
---
This made me think that it‚Äôd be cool to open up a pa suit and a skeleton just drops out the back
---
i play survival a lot and this sum up every thing you need to know,
---
like mentioned above stagger or vat crit will counter the Assassin sentinel and assassin cavalier players, if they use stealth boy then just run or hide because there nothing you can do against it, you can't vat or stagger what you can't see.
---
the thing is you are always at huge disadvantage when going against those players because they take 0 damage while you take full damage unless you have the same OP armor set, 
---
and about you getting one shoted, you just got vat crited.
---
FYI, i have a full bloodied build with all the perks and below 20% health and i still can't one shot most players with BE Gauss rifle, crazy i know XD
---
Why don't you just log out at your camp? Or a train station?
---
Most of the time I don‚Äôt even think about it lol
---
Hey, that's what I started doing a couple of days ago, I got tired of being 3-time pylon champ and everyone still not beating ISS down so I figured if it works on SBQ it'll work on ISS. 
---
Good to see others trying it out.
---
I will give you my last purified water.
---
I will offer you a tse handmade.
---
I will gentle massage your radiation engorged feet.
---
But I will straight up murder you for 3 screws.
---
Ok I can be on at 5pm ET today.
---
Unwanted? The only reason you‚Äôre still here is because you‚Äôre dying for my approval. Don‚Äôt lie to yourself bro. And look, you can‚Äôt keep using my insults back on me like somehow that changes anything. It‚Äôs embarrassing. Quit while you‚Äôre way behind, crying because someone called you out for bickering lol. What a crybaby lolol. 
---
You‚Äôre so mad, I bet you‚Äôll just keep crying at this rate. Let‚Äôs see.
---
If you can get a hold of a load of cranberries, you can make food that gives you a small exp boost for an hour. The is loads near the alpha site I believe. 
---
Also have a team mate like myself with inspirational 3. Every little helps. XD
---
Always be well rested!
---
They would have to use up your build limit for server stability wouldn't they? Otherwise yeah, I'd love all these. My little hut needs more interesting d√©cor.
---
r/PunPatrol  need backup! to many puns...
---
Except for White Springs. It looks great. Those robots do a wonderful job. Lol. Especially for being nuked constantly...;)
---
hahaahahaha get it he made a pun how awful shame on him!!!!!!11!!!1111111!!!
---
Im running bloodied and unyielding gears, but at the moment im leveling to get more and more perks

Im sneak 1-2 shotting
---
I absolutely love my camp, I try not to brag on it too much but with freehand junk decorating I‚Äôm almost certain I‚Äôd never leave my house lol. 
---
With every update I‚Äôm hoping the decorating will be here but it seems like we won‚Äôt be getting it for a while. I‚Äôll post some pictures of my camp so everyone can judge it haha.
---
I know you didn't ask for it but fun fact: Phantom devices can also work while you are in PA, unlike normal stealth boys. I'll see if using it from favorites in PA is also bugged next time I get on.
---
I have also seen where someone said it will probably be auto decorated by hitting display from a menu, they said they‚Äôre assuming this because if you look at your fermenter it says ‚Äúmark items to display‚Äù or something along those lines.
---
So I linked 4 seperate videos on people soloing the queen and you gave up? Just blew them off as if they are "irrelevant"????  They are more relevant than any of the worthless words you have said yet!  
---
Hmm... the point was "Is the queen solable."  4 videos say she is.  You say "Irrelevant".  I guess anything you do not agree with is "Irrelevant".  So anything you have to say is pointless.
---
They are gold compared to the washed out yellow
---
And a hotfix to the absolutely ridiculous core drain in VATS so we can use it without needing to carry all the cores in Appalachia down there.
---
Unfortunately all my stuff for sale weighs A TON, so can‚Äôt travel too much. Hence my desire for a space to rent lol.
---
You brag a way! :D I worked hard on mine, I'll rave about it till I'm dead!
---
Yes, I love the decorations they do add!
---
I read on another Reddit post that apparently Armour Racks have been mentioned somewhere. They were vague, but maybe it's true?
---
I'll keep an eye out for pictures. :)
---
Ooh thank you!
---
Nobody.
---
I imagine the Devs were like "well here's a concept" and someone was like "yes that's what Reddit wants? Ship it!"
---
This is the first time I‚Äôve heard of this in relation to this patch. Is it verified broken or does it just feel off?
---
That's fair. Admittedly this post was kind of a rant to make me feel better. When it initially started happening, I tried just rolling with it. But after getting parasites over and over again...But I feel better now. And I like my camp. I finally bit the bullet and bought some antibiotics recipes. Now to get the REST of the disease cures...
---
I believe it is now law to have the ability.  Part of disability‚Äôs act stuff.
---
except that meat is worth 5x as much as melons and I can fry and sell it for 500-800 caps a day and melons and most soup sell for 1 cap and I can just stop by my camp pick up 20 melons with the pick 2 plants perk giving me 400% food and 300% water for 5 secs of work and a ton of caps from frying and selling meat I find
---
Oh that's interesting! It would make it easier maybe? Using objects in Fallout 4 for decorations could be a nightmare.
---
But...I am a sneak build... :(
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox you should stop by some time. 
---
I‚Äôm just hoping for freehand decorating because like I said I‚Äôve got my two nightstands and they‚Äôre begging me to put a 10mm pistol and a box of ammo on it. I‚Äôve also got a little perch that NEEDS a sniper rifle against the wall lol
---
To be honest its hit and miss. It is just as bad if not worse in some areas in the northern part of the state too if you had taken 19 south out of Morgantown the whole trip would have looked like fallout.
---
They are different, but making Team Mates blue or another bright colour would be easier.
---
I tried that once. Did the whole event by myself, claimed the workshop, and within 3 minutes some level 230 rolls up in power armor with some kinda explosive weapon and murders me multiple times. Haven‚Äôt tried it since.
---
Watoga spawns a decent number of Fusion Cores and once you past level 50, the *Power user* perk saves a lot. When I was between 10-40, I run out of cores frequently because of VATS usage drains them badly (I was using a Hunting Rifle and I would frequently miss very close or charging enemies, it was essential). But now I don't use VATS anymore with my Handmades so I have accumulated quite a lot (see also *Batteries Included* perk).
---
For your level, find the bridge keys in Camden park and go to the [New River Gorge Bridge - West](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1298), under the bridge and into the maintenance rooms. There is usually a power armor with a core as well as a core lying in a side room. Also if you have picklock 2, the trailer at the end of the [Wade Airport](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1040) has usually a power armor with a core. The same airport has 2 possible power armor spawn points as well as a possible fusion core in the control tower.
---
Haha wow you really do live in your own little delusional reality don‚Äôt you? How‚Äôs that played out for you in life there eh?
---
I'm convinced the engine has some kind of complete lack of error checking or some memory-level corruption or something really fucky deep-down.
---
I just can't explain all the totally random crazy shit bugs that randomly appear like this.
---
Yeah and I can't tell you how many times I have seen the sheepsquatch go into the shed to kill who ever is trying to hide in there. You can't run and you can't hide. It will find you...lol.
---
You can see them BEST at night, but harvest them during the day as well.
---
It's not an event so how are you meant to repeat it?
---
patch broke it.. it isn't on the high priority fix list yet.
---
I like the Mire. Mostly because it's perfect for roleplaying my character. I use a wilderness survivalist with a knack for invention. I hunt for all of my food. Which is why parasites is the bane of my existence.
---
 I finally bought the antibiotic recipe, and got the Mire's disease cure the other day. Now I guess I'll be using my Strangler blooms for disease cures instead of Radshield.
---
AND THATS EXACTLY WHY, I stopped doing monster mash..
---
Oh I totally agree, I think the way it needs to work in my opinion would be for shelves and the stash box containers/ shelves have the auto decoration, I totally agree that hand placing everything in 4 was a nightmare especially when it would just fall, So I‚Äôm totally for auto static decorating shelves (think do it yourshelf but you pick individual items). This should not take budget as it just makes stash items visible. 
---
The second option is you can freehand decorate by removing items from your stash but by removing them they will take up budget (or stash box weight) and this prevents people from throwing thousands of items on the ground just for hoarding purposes.
---
I stim everyone I can get to..
---
If you are PlayStation I have all the mods for handmade rifles.....mod it for free.
---
I do alot of damage to her when she's on the ground, I don't have sneak bonuses but my normal attacks on my bloodied super sledge are 1k+, I knock small chunks off her life when I hit her. If I die, I get reset. Seems that way with most players though.
---
also, the ones who 'stopped' playing, - still camped out on sites like this,after 4 months ?
---
If you don't like it,fair enough, now just go away.
---
It is up top right of screen.
---
If expierience has teached us anything, it is that Bethesda should never rush anything. Ever.
---
I was pretty disappointed when they delayed player vending, but now I think I'd rather have something properly integrated than a buggy mess. But oh well, maybe it's going to be a buggy mess anyway. Still Bethesda should take the time they need to make good content. And not try to release unfinished stuff just to release something.
---
That is definitely a fun fact!
---
What's your Gamertag? I'll have to come say hi!
---
Yeah, I'd love a Nuka Cola display, Quantum alone is an awesome decoration!
---
I was farming at Harper's Ferry (since level 25) and Watoga with my sneak build character. I didn't get any trouble about it. Plus I got some nice legendary and caps.
---
Also whitespring can be good for exp grind but it's hardly a bit for sneaky, thig ghouls are so angry. :P But you can handle it with Blocker perk. Plus you can get chems.
---
I didn't tried but my friends farming exp by workshop defend events. They are taking 3-4 workshops and defending them in a circle. Plus they are getting junks and event rewards includes camp plan.
---
I‚Äôm currently using the hardened silenced .50 hunting rifle. Abit disappointed the damage output.
---
The perc Perks help but.. woulda like better overall dmg.
---
Team America said it best, I think.
---
"Assholes just want to shit all over everything..."
---
Currently ive been doing white springs. But respawns are a bitch
---
I always log out at camp, never seen this as an issue.
---
Yes I think I see it, run and then see it is a player..
---
When you first click repai the screen looks like a glitched out menu then at the very bottom it says press V to change name or R to repair. I restarted my game 3 times before I realised that is not a bug.
---
There‚Äôs a weird small push in the community to  be okay with leeching, it‚Äôs weird. People want to be able to sit at Queen, and not do crap, while making her harder to kill, and get all the free loot for just showing up, and making things harder for those doing all the work. It makes no sense. The people actually fighting spent their time, and resources to fight, and I‚Äôve seen a lot of event fail because to many leeches, but for some strange reason we are suppose to be okay with it, because they bought the game too..... 
---
I‚Äôve seen a huge decline in Queen lately. I also see a lot of dps will leave if they see to many leeches, it‚Äôs to the point if I launch a nuke, and see too many leeches I just leave, and launch a new one on another server. Since 9 out of 10 times there are too many leeches and the event fails. It sucks burning several hours of farmed ammo for nothing. Just so some entitled person can try to get carried. 
---
There really needs to be some sort of damage threshold done to prevent this crap, because on Xbox farming is becoming unbearable. If the dungeon is your team only I‚Äôll be farming that from now one because how annoying leeches are. They swarm out of their little mud hole the second a nuke is launched.
---
It fixed some repairing freezes for me but I'd prefer the old way
---
Same thing happens with the Vault-Tec garden table.
---
This is what I feared. I'm not the only one this recent development has hit. Was fine for a couple months then recently after a patch or maintenance, *bam*, The grind has intensified. New bug it seems?
---
I did the same thing but I took serious dmg while underwater and wearing prototype hazmat suit
---
Note this was several previous patches ago.
---
Oh man thanks for the offer! but I'm on PC :(
---
I love theorycrafting builds! I'll be back, OP
---
best would be to move your camp in a location that is not traveled too often or not reachable very easy; also not locking anything will reduce the chances of getting it trashed
---
Wise, regular, vengeful, glowing and scorched I believe. Don't take that as gospel its been a while since I've found a Mothman.
---
I'd be fine if we could just craft acid, for example, letting wine spoil, cook toxic water into acid, etc. (25% of my daily runs are for Abraxos and Yao Guai so that I can craft ammo.)
---
I wonder if this has to do with how aqua boy applies radiation immunity in water. I‚Äôve never considered it could apply as an effect only when your in the water rather than somehow just not letting the waters radiation affect the player.
---
Hmm in that case I‚Äôm not sure. I am usually tanking her and staying alive from my full set of unyielding sentinel, but still die sometimes from poison dmg or a bunch of enemies smacking me while I‚Äôm staggered, I‚Äôve still always gotten credit though.
---
Every VATS activation consumes around 5% of the FC.
---
Same amount as Power Attack.
---
It has been an issues for several patches but the last one seems to have made it extra egregious.
---
Everybody gangster till the mannequin starts walking
---
Yeah, that's true actually, the same amount of objects are in the world so should be fine?
---
Both ways have me hoping they get added!
---
I think it‚Äôs a diminishing return. You need high intel early to craft, and hack. Once you level up to 50 or obtain the max char points, 56 not much need.
---
I‚Äôm gonna drop a few and respec to other perks and see what happens.
---
got that and we all have them moments, like wtf Bethesda!!!!, anyways if you play on xbox im willing to help with you. 
---
p.s. glad you feel better.
---
The computers are not great, but their AI (Rose, PAM, Robobrains, etc) is remarkably advanced compared to our world.  And if they've implemented it 64k of RAM, it's insanely good.
---
We can only hope! I‚Äôm just waiting for an announcement
---
I should be awake by then. See you then
---
I‚Äôve also been hoarding bobble heads and magazines just in case, and bought the magazine rack just in case lol
---
They‚Äôre actually relatively easy to craft and if I put a little time into it I could easily grind out the resources for a couple weeks straight worth of serums to sell, so thanks. I just need to get the recipe for one now.
---
Yeah, about right.
---
Try picking up something you like of off the 76 Market. You can afford anything now and most of them cost around 10k caps for a good tse.
---
Ok just a suggestion I thought of.
---
I'd pay for Handmade paints so I can visually distinguish my 8 guns from one another (like red, green, blue, orange, purple, etc).
---
I think, sadly, there is two factors that hinder this: 1) adding cosmetics requires paying devs/artists a thousand dollars apiece, increasing the run/dev cost of the game; 2) you earn atoms via in-game challenges so barely many incentives to buy atoms.
---
So I didn't get your mean so if you talking about respawn time, you must hop to next server instead of wait to respawn. Or if you talking about this ghoul horde are crowded for handle, I must suggest you to use blind spots for ghouls.^^
---
Jennlee252117, just shoot me a message!
---
Meant its always empty.
---
Server hopping doesn‚Äôt work for me. Perhaps im doing it wrong
---
I don't get it. I've recently passed 950 hours in this game, have 5 characters at varying levels all with Camps at different locations. Not once... *not once* has my camp been attacked by another player. I feel for those whose Camps have been attacked, but for the life of me I don't understand why they are being attacked.
---
Unless it's a turret Camp at Whitespring, then I would happily burn your Camp with Fire. Also I know some people get mad if you Camp near Charleston Train Station, thereby messing up the Bot Vendor Spawn.
---
I've heard this so many times yet his inventory never changes upon server hopping.
---
Honestly the state of the environment 25 years after the war is quite realistic. Wood rots, especially when not cared for/repaired/protected. Stuff collapses, especially during stormy weather and wont get rebuilt if no one is around.
---
The shape of the buildings in the other games that take place hundreds of years after the war ... that is what is unbelievable. Because in such a huge timespan, any wood used in construction would have rotted completely, any paper lying around as good as dissolved or rotten as well (holes in roofs, broken windows, humidity, mold ... there simply should not be any books, notes, folders left in the ruins especially not in a readable state)
---
And even metal constructions would surely break down over 200 years. Erosion is a huge factor that destroys concrete too. And dont forget that the foundations of some buildings should probably have taken a huge damage due to the earthquakes from the war and in the time after that should have resulted in almost every house either sinking into the ground as its foundation shifted out of balance collapse as most buildings arent made earthquake-proof in the US anyway.
---
tl:dr there should be almost nothing left of the old world 200 years later aside from seriously huge and sturdy stuff. Anything else should be either nothing but a pile of rubble, completely gone or at the very least completely covered in grass, vines and whatnot.
---
Hope and sunk cost fallacy; both powerful motivators in their own right, truly dire when in tandem.
---
Also the experience varies wildly between those who have a more casual approach to the game and those who take it as a second job (so to speak).
---
The latter bunch will have a much more severe exposure to the hundreds of glitches, bugs and niggles that tend to grind you down over time.
---
White springs golf club has changed managers recently and they‚Äôre struggling with temperamental chefs and combative wait staff.
---
Personally I find their purportedly fine dining experience and minimal choices, lacking.
---
Lolz
---
yep Elder is kinda cheezy .. flat grey with white. nothing fancy or eye pleasing. but it is top tier paint if you like the BOS ranking and want to show you farmed the tech documents.
---
This game has reasonable critiques and the launch cannot be excused, but look past that and accept this, the devs gave a fuck. They fixed it. Not many devs do that nowadays. They are committed and it will get better.
---
Wrong sub
---
No way. My primary grenade is the Nuka-Grenade. If you give me easy access to Nuka Colas I'd make stacks and abuse the hell out of them. I'd rather use those on special occasions.
---
I run it for some perks, but my special is like 15 strength, 9 perception and 11 int.
---
Everyone who was screeching about wanting more confirmations before we scrap anything or use any materials.
---
If I go in a back alley will I find an antigovernment robot trying to sell me goods?
---
I‚Äôm not gonna lie, that is horrid, it doesn‚Äôt even look like a moth let alone a man, more like a random monster. I‚Äôll just take my pop figure thank you.
---
Oh understand, not it's not your fault I'm sure. Must be someone killed before you. If you are on pc, we can check it together.
---
I don't deal well with poison either, I'm in PA with protocols. Idk man, iv always thought that's just the way it was.
---
Annoying the heck out of people.
---
I'm am not sure how they stack of if they stack
---
I've got an AA Gatling Plasma lvl50 if you're looking for one to buy!
---
The cards aren't affected by the stat reduction. Also you got marsupial first time? Good for you!

Keep hoping the fo76 dragonbat chasing bait and switch disappearing legendarys horde boss never appearing confusing menus game improves. I like to complain and I hate your post. Thaaaaaaaanks

Im not really intro mood to spend 800 caps just to anyone someone xD
---
Well, ever since brewing update, it's a little hard to see, but in the new main menu screen video, the camp that's essentially just a patio with no roof has 3-4 new objects on the left side. Amongst them is what appears to be a nuka-cola fountain. In the Appalachia spring trailer, there's a much closer look at these 3-4 new objects. My best guess is that it's a fountain that we'll be able to craft nuka-cola at, or a nuka-cola mixer for new drinks. 
---

Nothing to see here Bethesda  ( better stock up before the nerf comes)
---
Nah, they wouldnt have mentioned them at the event a few weeks ago. They're sneaky. They'd want us to forget
---
That sounds like a weight relief measure, you cant have that if they want to add increase weight items in the atom store.
---
To each his own.  Saw a base built behind the clubhouse that had sirens all over it.  
---
Annoying AF, but funny too.
---
What?
---
Applying mods appears to be broken right now...
---
Players attack camps in adventure to get a bounty, then server hop into survival to bait players to them so they don't have hunt for opponents in PVP.
---
And lazy griefers will keep doing it as long as it keeps working.
---
__Keep hoping the fo76 dragonbat chasing bait and switch disappearing legendarys horde boss never appearing confusing menus game improves. I like to complain and I hate your post. Thaaaaaaaanks__
---
They should make mines invisible to vats and be able to be placed in camps, so we can have mine fields
---
Hmm I hadn't considered that. I guess I need some ammo diversity. Min/max isn't my priority so I suppose I could mix in some rifle perks as I've got loads of .45 and .308 saved up. Thanks for the tip!
---
Literally a wall of shit text lol.
---
That‚Äôs just alphabetical since it‚Äôs listed as ‚Äú[Known]‚Äù.
---
 ‚Äú[‚Äú comes before any letter or number in alphabetical order. It‚Äôs still dumb and I don‚Äôt know how tf they broke alphabetical ordering.
---
What in the name of Atom?
---
This plushie is almost 30$ AND it looks like it was thrown together.
---
There‚Äôs always one at Tanagra Town, but that‚Äôs Mire
---
What is the first prefix on it?
---
Take this across to r/fo76bazaar
---
I only play games that are literally unplayable.
---
I'm just a builder. I love the camp building, and I don't want to change it all.
---
Save lots of caps and hope a player has them for sale.
---
I don't appreciate missing my entire top floor because some mutated bat decided to pay me a visit.
---
&gt;  If they were superstacking, they would have had to be making 20 alts from day one just to store the chems and aid...
---
Other way around, they've either pulled their Beta era accounts with huge stock, some may be dupers or like me no one else on their team could be bothered to deal with aid/drugs/bobbleheads/gun types they don't use. 
---
That's not counting say the damage a rifle can do or melee. 
---
What's your build?
---
Once I get the magazine achievement I'll be doing the same.
---
I have the boys uniform if that‚Äôs what you want
---
Your problem is the 85 round drum, it gives you zero armour penetration, change it up to the stinging or piercing mag and things are different.
---
I though they were just stranlger pods during the day, but bloomed at night?
---
Done!
---
WHY IS EVERYONE YELLING ^or^whispering all the time?!
---
Yeah was thinking that. And cant im on ps4, but thank you anyways
---
Alright then. Time to get home defense.
---
Oh you are welcome then. I suggest you to try Harper's Ferry, I guess you will like it then. :)
---
Once you have done the quest, harvesting the blooms becomes unlocked permanently and you can go to the river behind dyer chemical to loot more at any time. If there isn't any, swap server :)
---
Yeah I thought they bloomed at night, but I thought the quests just require the pods. Had to do it a couple of times, bcuz of the gutsys.
---
you could buy them..............wotoga BOS vendor.
---
I've got ultacite armour................not one single plan/mod drop........ever !
---
I had this helmet. Got stolen when UI glitch dropped it on a corpse and someone stole it on me before I could reset the loot UI.
---
Looks like so.
---
**Watoga** city is nerfed, but the Clinic still has a 50% chance to spawn a legendary for me.
---
**Whitesprings** is down and far less 2-3\* enemies. For nuked WS, I get a 12% chance for a 3\* enemy but they gave me 2\*s. For non-nuked WS, 22% for a 2-3\* enemy but I get only 4.5% 3\* drops.
---
**Harper's Ferry** is also down, maybe 1 legendary per visit on average.
---
**West Tec** is up for me, almost always at least 1 legendary enemy and sometimes up to 6. However, I didn't visit WT much before as I did not have the right equipment (Mutant slayer's Handmade) and had repeatedly little luck before Patch 7 there.
---
Thank you!
---
Makeshift warrior rank 5 is 50% slower weapon breakage and there is a perk to repair up to 200% condition. 
---
My fire axe lasts me an age.
---
When I was level 15 I was always in the footsteps of a high level players trail, so the enemies would be hell to fight. The ghouls were the worst.
---
The mods for the PA yes, but I want JUST THE PLANS. Like the miner miracles quest where you get each component.
---
The very first time I tried this I got the megasloth encounter but didn't get credit for the kill.
---
Did it a hundred more times never saw it again.
---
FML
---
Yeah I know, so problem that I don‚Äôt have perks? Durability still like old times? Ok then appreciate
---
Madigan or the Overseer. Two badass legends with great motives and tales.
---
I've also found you can mod legendaries for addtional effects...
---
for example, I've successfully added piercing magazines to a vampire rifle, and a larger magazine to another legendary.
---
Also found when you add a mod to a legendary, you'll get a message that the current mod will be detroyed (even if you are replacing "standard reciever"), but it does not appear to remove any legendary effect(s).
---
I had him held and checked a good 15 times and he never had the coat. After that I found him a couple times naturally and ended up with two of them.  So it can just be bad luck sometimes.
---
The overseer left me.
---
Holy shit, man. Thanks.
---
I gave it a go last night and it seems this is a winning recipe. I was able to clean out a vendor's caps after a quick run through Ft Defiance.
---
It's gonna take me a bit to Max my caps since I only get to play one day a week, but this is a good start.
---
So much of a big deal WV made an ineractive Fallout map on their tourism website...
---
There is no rule against posting sales or trades here. Though OP will get quicker responses from r/market76
---
Yes you need them in your inventory but if you have multiples you can use them back to back . I wouldn‚Äôt spend caps on them tho , it‚Äôs just mats and junk
---
If your looking to tame one it has to be at a random encounter site. I got mine behind the southern lookout tower.
---
Thanks I'm on Xbox though
---
you can just deposit the candy at the terminal, so no need to lug it around.
---
Yes, you actually need them on you when you go to the location.
---
I wish they'd stop fixing the non-problems and fix actual issues. This was annoying beyond compare. At first, I thought my game had bugged out when I couldn't get back to the regular weapons screen. Turns out, I have a few more buttons to push. I'm glad I'm not the only one having the weapons stats disappear" issue, though.
---
ahh ..got you....400hrs+  ... never seen...but the parts are scattered all over.
---
Yes, and to not make it too op as a feature the bots should require batteries or fusion cores which they drain the more you use them.
---
Enjoy the ban and then never hearing back from Bethesda
---
I try to collect all the different types of axes and machetes and I keep finding myself using vampires.
---
Yes, you have to have map in you inventory, go to the location it shows and look for small sand hill and click on it. Map disappears and you get random items. If you got multiple maps form the same location and number, you can click that many times how many maps you got and got random loot for each map. So it's wise to collect them and dig when have multiple similar maps.
---
My understanding of it is that it‚Äôs a newly formed team of devs running this game so it‚Äôs their baby and people care about their babies
---
Instigating and swing speed for melee. If the first hit doesn‚Äôt do it at least the rest will be quick!
---
Idk about far too much work, it takes 2 seconds. But yeah, shouldn't need a work around for an object used elsewhere in game.
---
a little trick that i've found, is that if you back out of the menu quick enough after repairing the menu wont bug out.
---
So press T then R and tab out right away before the info panel has time to update.
---
(works for me on pc anyway)
---
Hopefully they will fix this silly bug during the next patch.
---
It costs more to have little white kids sewing shit together than Asian sweatshops
---
Congratulations. I got 15 over the last 200 hours. Once I found my first and stashed it, they kept coming at a decent rate (\~ 1:77, an uniform chance would be \~1:110). I played 850 hours total and had about 2500 loot drops, not a single TSE anything.
---
(I'm still looking for a Two-shot Handmade as the 25% bonus damage is better than an Anti-armor's 50% ignore.)
---
I'm baffled they still haven't implemented that in the game itself.
---
It‚Äôs easy to dupe camp items. So easy that if you check your stored items you may have duped a bunch accidentally. It‚Äôs just not something they control well
---
Okay. Thanks for the info. You are definitely on it.
---
This guy said he can‚Äôt find the energy to get out of his pa to craft . Holy fk you are a lazy pos , go away
---
I literally just go from event to event, this weekend I got from 72 to 86 by doing all the events, stopped once or twice to farm materials, but it's not bad leveling xp if you can handle the repetition
---
Its PvP? I was the only person in the evtn when ive done it so didnt realise it was pvp
---
For sure its fine
---
Snazzy.
---
well the repair menu bugs out every time so the number of players is irrelevant to this specific issue. There is just a coding error inside the repair menu file.
---
How they didn't catch this during testing is beyond me tbh.
---
What's Pickaxe Pilsner again?
---
Ahh I see I never played beta so I can't really say but I'm almost certain most melee builds have this and is almost always in all of them.
---
Don‚Äôt listen to the op . Game is running great,severs are always populated and new content is rolling out .
---
That would be ok if you had enough mats on hand to repair everything.
---
  If you don't, then a repair all would a) fail (and) you'd still have to look to see what was repaired and what wasn't and b) repair things in some order other than what you would prefer.
---
That said, MHO is it would have to be configured so that it repaired the most damaged first, least damaged last.
---
Thanks for the info buddy. Yes I do have it, bought it from responder random bot in charleston.
---
I thought it was the travelling leather coat, which I still havent seenyet. Anybody has a pic of it? Where can i find it?
---
I've done it twice so far, it's hilarious fun and you get some nice rewards.  Dare to try, dare to win.
---
Ignore the negative nellies.
---
I want armor paint and their flag
---
Servers have never been remotely empty and I've been playings since release on ps4. At the very least, a server could be at half capacity.
---
They also need to fix the Gatling Laser. Before the update I only had to reload it every time I switched weapons. Now EVERY SINGLE TIME I reload, it shoots one bullet, has to spin up again, then has to be reloaded halfway through the clip. I assume it's from any cores you have that aren't 100%, you have to reload once it reaches 0 charge. It is completely fucking broken now, not this annoyingly broken.
---
As someone who built their entire build around heavy energy weapons, what the hell am I supposed to do. Shoot 1 bullet, spin up again, shoot 50 bullets, reload. Shoot 1 bullet, spin up again, shoot 70 bullets, reload. Rinse and repeat until you've used every core that isn't 100%.
---
Now if only the Perk Loadout Manager mod would be back how it was... Nukesdragons loadouts are unplayable!
---
Has anybody actually gotten a good drop from this thing? I got a one star leather leg
---
You can have as much as I have for free. Pay if you like I don't mind if not. Add me same name as reddit on UK times.

---
same    ...  they wern't bright enough,then they went too far.(just a little dimmer would be fine), or , have it back off when close,would be great.
---
A final alt observation: when doing a nuke run at the Whitespring, it quickly becomes obvious that you cannot compete with those folks with mutations and what not.  They run faster, jump higher, etc.  They get to all the bad guys before you can. You are always late for the party.  I'll keep playing this character off and on as a change of pace.  He's been lucky so far.
---
First time, it was mostly like this, except we failed because of bad teamwork on everyone part. The 2nd time, we failed despite my best efforts to clear out Gutsy's while others held the pylons; the higher levels in PA kept getting destroyed and had a hard time hitting it.  Every time there after, Pylon 1 has glitched out to where nobody can activate it, the option to activate it doesn't even show up, for anyone, so we litterally can't complete it.  I tried server hopping and trying it on a few other servers and had the sae experience.  So I've just given up for the time being.  PS4 btw.
---
Personally, I don't care about the event all that much anymore.  The lack of an actual sheepsquatch boss is dissapointing and from what I've heard of people who have completed it, the rewards are lackluster.
---
&gt;all it ever has is a clean space suit
---
... Meanwhile, this is the *only damn thing* I want from it, and after over 100 encounters, still nothing. =P
---
I have been investigating this myself going threw all my mods have 0 for PA that have worked 0 for regular armour that work 0 for guns got one to equip on bat and one to equip on a knuckles... Would only make since for the most useless mods to still be working... Gonna test this bag dropping theory tonight
---
Scorchbeasts are annoying, and their loot still sucks, but they're not op. If you want to completely nullify their screeching damage, you only need to equip Fireproof rank 2 from the endurance perks.
---
Don't forget to scream on Mic "DONT MOVE IM RELOADING".
---
Yeah I just want the plans for the components. It‚Äôs cheaper to own and support.
---
Brilliant all these positive comments definitely make me want to go back, ty :)
---
I only drink boiled water and use the purified water to craft stimpacks-diluted.

200+ hours and have yet to see any

An alcoholic beverage. You can learn how to make it through the "wasted on" daily quests from biv.
---
The Super Mutant thing makes plenty of sense. The Master did not create all Super Mutants. The FEV did. None of the East Coast mutants- Capital wasteland, Commonwealth, OR Appalachia- have had anything to do with the Master. The presence of Super Mutants is explained in-game as a West-Tek/government experiment. Their presence makes sense. And likewise for the other two factions, it‚Äôs not a retcon if we don‚Äôt really know what they were up to for the first years of their lives. There‚Äôs like a 70 year gap in BoS lore between Maxson founding the order and the events of Fallout 1, so them getting satellite comms running and establishing other BoS chapters across the country is perfectly reasonable with all that time to themselves. And the Enclave was a secretive PRE WAR organization that ran the entire country. You really think it‚Äôs impossible that they had MORE hideouts than just the oil rig? Raven Rock didn‚Äôt just spring up overnight. So I‚Äôm afraid i have to disagree with you saying bethesda just shits all over the lore.
---
The few times I‚Äôve played you grabbed the masks and grabbed the candy. Anyone wearing masks was pvp able and you shot and looted them for their candy.
---
It is 100% established in-game that this is exactly what happened and why they‚Äôre in Appalachia.
---
I have one durability perk (10%)  and one repair perk (120%).
---
In general, I've noticed different weapons "last" longer.  My 1\* vampire machete seemed to go forever, as does the cultist blade, blade of bastet, and death tambo.
---
Grognak anti-armor axe, deathclaw gauntlet, and assualtron blade...not so much.  They need repair much sooner than the others.
---
I think there's a glitch or something that keeps them from spawning for some people after they finish that quest.
---
Basically everything except for meele needs a buff. It‚Äôs so sad to see every single high level player using nothing else but meele because we all know it‚Äôs the most powerful thing in the game.
---
You don‚Äôt seem like one.
---
Oh, that‚Äôs strange, cuz I was attacking with Grognak and it destroys faster! 
---
Guess it‚Äôs weapon problem
---
To require you to spend a perk card to lighten it
---
Downvoting if this removes the rename, and scrap warning capabilities. I‚Äôll do the extra step just to prevent me from scrapping something more important.
---
Treasure maps give a guaranteed weapon and a guaranteed plan.
---
I'd want them just so it's something else I could display in a store.
---
Wow. There sure are some real a holes in this game. Thankfully most are decent people
---
Gatling Gun a thousand times over. Minigun only does about 12 damage per bullet (no perks) at a high fire rate - it uses heaps and heaps of 5mm ammo, while the gatling gun does around 85 damage with no perks at a slower fire rate, but the fire rate is still fast enough (with the speedy receiver) to kill groups of enemies. Minigun is really crap itself because there are not many mods for it (gatling gun has way better mods) and, as already mentioned, it wastes 5mm ammo very quickly.
---
Pretty sure it detects enemies and sends a signal when they're nearby. You can use it by keeping all of your defenses offline until enemies show up.
---
No you were just being a smart ass.
---
The same person that said "Let's add the repair kits to the Atomic Shop"
---
Lolz it‚Äôs only worthless if NO ONE BUYS..
---
Okay, good to know. I was thinking they could just be like statues where there's no interacting with them or scrapping them to produce an outfit though. If they can remove an item from your camp when you request an Atom store refund I'd guess they could do the same if you got rid of an outfit that's on display. Like every outfit would basically function as a building plan.
---
This looks like something I would have made for a 5th grade art project the night before it was due.
---
Also a very common reward.
---
Yeah when you hear someone else shooting the gatling gun is sounds very awesome
---
I suspect this might have to do with what PERK cards you have equipped. I had the same issue trying to attach an Excavator mod when I was low level, but without Power Smith.
---
I haven't tried attaching that mod again, but maybe you need a higher Gunsmith level? Worth a try.
---
It'd be great for anyone who uses flamers. Fuel is stupid expensive to craft.
---
Are you on PS4?
---
  Asking b/c I have (at least) 2 melee and 1 ballistic bloodied legendaries taking up space in my stash...
---
I wish I had something to sell you, cuz I'm not really a cap farmer and am trying to save for various plans, but the only real thing I have worth selling atm is the instigating super sledge and I just can't part with it. So many memories of one shotting death claws and glowing honey beasts. Usually I just dump legendary stuff I can't or won't use at train stations. The good karma I'm racking up doing that for non farmers or lower levels beats the caps, imo.
---
The one gun army perk is a crappy perk - a 12% chance to stagger and cripple a limb is not worth 3 perk points
---
I use be handmade. If u have another bloodied handmade ill take it off your hands :)
---
It's very tedious!
---
Ah well, good to know its not urgent
---
I've encountered this as well, but I had no heavy gunner perks - you just need to do a heavy gunner build with a gatling - that's when you can easily 1v1 scorchbeasts
---
Stick your generators on foundations. I think the main issue is that there isn't any "dirt foundation" that allows you to build purifiers and plants on flat ground.
---
I've made to post about them nursing legendaries and everybody just downvotes me. It's obvious they did it it's pretty shity of Bethesda.
---
You sound like someone who doesn't know what is good in Fallout 76 and what is not. Everybody says the gatling gun is the best - besides, the 50 cal machine gun has only one mod (prime receiver doesn't count and wastes too much ultracite and flux to make the ammo that gets used very quickly) that only increases the damage by a tiny bit. Crafting 50 caliber ammo costs the most out of all the ammo, and the 50 caliber machine gun just consumes ammo way too quickly.
---
That happens to me quite a lot, I believe what happens is it is taking you into a building to show you the door that leads out to somewhere you have a quest marker. 
---
So, if you have a quest marker somewhere in the outside of the map...it will sometimes take you inside to show you a door that leads back outside to somewhere that is slightly closer to your destination. It's bizarre but from all the times it's happened that's the only thing I've been able to figure out that it's doing. 
---
If a building has a door nearby that is slightly closer to one of your quest markers, it will tell you to go into the building so you can leave it again and be a little closer to the destination - strange glitch but I think that's what it's doing.
---
I was disappointed when I discovered this too. I got it for my other legendary lever action, so it's not the worst news, but I do wonder if it's intentional or not, and what the reasoning is if it was.
---
lol. I've got the sneak to disengage perk thingy.more often than not - they do exactly that. I don't even need to shout. still do tho.....usually a 4 letter word begining with f.
---
Displays your dominance.
---
I‚Äôve sold the legendary dragon 3x in a week. That thing is SLOW AF.
---
You gotta be kidding me... Why would you use the minigun?! It is so crap! Gatling gun has a better fire rate, better damage per bullet, better ammo consumption and better everything else! I don't even know why Bethesda added the minigun into Fallout 76, it just wastes ammo too much
---
Get used to it. This is typical Bethesda. Ignore actual bugs and screw with *working* game mechanics in a way that breaks them.
---
I swear, Bethesda is nothing but a bunch of monkeys with typewriters at this point. 
---
I shudder to think of how they‚Äôre going to ruin TES6.
---
I wish I could upvote this more , I'd rather try for 3 days straight fail a hundred times, use all my aid and ammo and know that I'm going to get SOMETHING good when I'm done , the way t is now, I don't even fuck with the harder stuff, like the SBQ anymore bc of this reason , it's just not worth it
---
I would be interested in reading something like that.
---
10 out of 10 need.
---
...better ammo consumption for gatling gun! Don't use the fcking minigun gatling gun is the best heavy weapon in the game
---
I dont know what would be more terrifying. This or a [Cazaclaw](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58606)
---
Which effectively makes phantom machines worthless.
---
Suffering from Success
---
The same cuck thats adding repair kits in the text update
---
Im pretty confident pvp is 100% broken fucked. Im using full sent/ass and get 1 shot by level 32s.
---
Shame the sheepsquatch head is glitched. I hope they fix it soon.
---
Then what is life?
---
I would guess it does.
---
&gt;Unless they solved it since
---
Bethesda doesn't solve anything, they let the fans do it for them. Can you imagine how polished this game would be if they let the mod community release unofficial patches?
---
It depends.  Bullets from enemies can still damage you if they hit you; the water doesn't lower the chance of being hit, but enemies can't attack while under water(except Mirelurks) and they actively try to stay in shallow water, so if the distance between you and them is far enough their accuracy will suffer.  For players in Survival, being in water doesn't really help cause VATS exists.  For Players in Adventure mode, it doesn't matter because they can't target you unless you are hostile towards them or wanted, at which point VATS exists.
---
The sonic attacks of Scorchbeasts can sometimes collide with the water or other objects in the water resulting in you taking less damage, and sometimes they clip through everything between you and the Scorchbeast(including trees when fighting them normally, which needs to fixed).
---
It's not as great as hiding underwater in Skyrim.
---
You can also craft level 20 Gatling gun according to a youtube video of a low level guy who found a lvl 20 gatling gun. What a lucky bastard he is
---
Applying mods is bugged right now for some things.  I can‚Äôt mod my dc gauntlet either even with all mats in my inventory and makeshift 3 on. This really needs fixed tomorrow
---
The science perks need to have some kind of bonus beyond crafting. Perhaps they could make it so the science perks give energy weapons bonus armour piercing.
---
Well I disagree . You need int for power armor/heavy weapons / durability/ nerd rage / explosives/ xp gain/ durability 
---
Just because you play a build that doesn‚Äôt utilize these things doesn‚Äôt make it a joke
---
plausable - I keep going back like a donkey- mabye there IS something there this time. I get sidetracked with greatest of ease.
---
We need a higher limit and some better cap sinks, like consignment on item sales, maybe an auction house in game. It would push high value legendaries to higher marks.
---
If they want caps to remain low, they need to drop a zero off some of the values.
---
Bang goes my PVP strategy!
---
Yes. I need to put dense on my metal torso but can't because of this bug. I seriously hope they fix it
---
Can you post a YouTube link? That sounds cool üëç
---
Only 8 US Government Supply Requisitions?! I've got around 150. Charred and Gangrenous ghouls drop heaps of those holotapes for me
---
Also, you should have a friend join your team so that other players don't loot your supply drop
---
I get your point, but I am enjoying FO76 immensely, yes it is not perfect, no game is, but in the end it's Fallout, and even if it is now online, I like it.  
---
My only gripe would be the inconvenient disconnects, but it's getting better.  
---
However I do not feel the need to whine and complain excessively as some do, I do not seek the acceptance or praise of others, I like what I like, that's that.
---
wait though... Hear me out. Fallout 76 is a video game and weapon weights were decided on with balance taken into account and to improve gameplay experience having to make choices on what you actually carry with you rather than making them acurate to real life. As this IS A GAME AND NOT A SIMULATOR.
---
If you have the union uniform equipped which appears to have a backpack, will you just be able to modify that?
---
fuckin a that's funny
---
Finding a minigun? That's  easy. Just go to west tek and at least 3 super mutants drop miniguns with 100-500 5m rounds
---
sorry for the late reply I‚Äôll be on today to pick it up
---
All of the problems you've listed can be fixed by equipping the right perks. Except the end game content. But they are working on it
---
I was on a server last night where there were a decent number of camps at Top of The World. Everyone was super cooI it was like a hippie trailer park lol
---
Yeah duh
---
It happens every time to a feature they just added into the game ... Seems like something that should of been caught as they already were specifically working on the feature.
---
I would love for this to happen. The only caveat being that when up pickup the colas, you have to provide the caps yourself.
---
That was exactly my experience and a reason for this post.  I was was chilling one Saturday morning, trying to do my daily and weekly challenges in peace, and claimed a workshop as part of that.  Within minutes, a level 200+ in power armor rolls through the workshop, kills me instantly with what felt like TSE automatic rifle and is gone without claiming it.  I lost over a hundred caps without even a chance to wave.
---
I‚Äôd rather use workshop for mats I need than running around looking for junk with magnifying glasses next to them
---
Ok, goldilocks.  Take a look at your video settings to see if tweaking the balance helps.  It did mine by a lot.  I also turned down a lot of sounds because the clunk grind clunk of PA was driving me batty.
---
Yeah ammunition factory can make a lot of 5mm because each bullet is very small
---
they have said they are looking into it on one of their past posts
---
this one specifically -  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/QtVQlF3lmGXkLAZ8GV4VJ/inside-the-vault-survival-mode-beta-overview](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/QtVQlF3lmGXkLAZ8GV4VJ/inside-the-vault-survival-mode-beta-overview)
---
Yeah munitions factory doesn't make 2mm ammo only makes ammo for normal weapons (because gauss rifle is classified as an exotic weapon)
---
Fuck, I run backwards away from everything anyway. Totally going to see if this is a glitch I can enjoy!
---
Yeah sometimes if you're lucky super mutants that have miniguns will drop 500 5mm rounds
---
Me, who does have high INT: Am I a joke to you?
---
He just IS lamp now
---
This would be nice.  If you don't have all mats you wouldn't do it, but if you do then it's one click. Same for weapons, but only repair all favorites so I'm not repairing bullshit pipe pistols I picked up.
---
Idk what you are going for but perc and str don‚Äôt really go together. if you want to min/max pick a build and cater to it as much as possible . If you just want to pve than it doesn‚Äôt really matter , the game is super easy
---
I've been getting nothing but vampire guns lately. In the last two days, all at Whitespring:
---
Vampire's Ripper
---
Vampire's Lead Pipe
---
Vampire's Lever Action
---
some Vampire's axe
---
And a couple more I've forgotten.
---
Aside from the levergun, they've all been quickly sold to vendors for a pittance.
---
None of them are as useful as my Vampire's Handmade, though.
---
I have two different grognak and they break at different rates. I use power hit more with one I think tho so never mind. But they break hella fast compared to my spear.
---
The fasnacht event, this pods, mothman, etc. I'm learning a lot of cool things about this wonderful country thanks to this game.
---
My siren brings all the girls to the yard?
---
Agreed. My two highest stats are Perception (14) and Intelligence (15). I wanted to make a build that focused on using rifles as a primary weapon and did a lot of crafting. All my other stats are basicallly set up to support one of those things. 3 points in luck for super duper, a few points in agility for stealthy sniping, that kind of thing. I'm now lvl 84, and what do I find?
---
My ability to craft weapons and armor is useless (even with higher durability) because everybody just wants legendaries. And since you can only craft mods ONTO weapons and armor, rather than making them standalone, I can't even sell mods to higher level players.
---
I get absolutely NO benefit from the mod system, so I spend most of my time gathering springs and screws to build low level weapons to break down to hopefully learn mods that anyone with 5 Int can make anyway.
---
Even with maxed perks and hardened recievers, the faser firing rifles I remembered being amazing from FO4 (like the radium rifle) don't do jack, meaning I'm screwed in close quarters.
---
Short answer: I don't.
---
I love lamp.
---
My pacifist is always on by default.  Workshops are part of the game and if you like doing challenges that you will eventually have to claim them every once in a while.  My whole point is that the current PvP mechanic is broken and being exploited.
---
Use a spotlight will the turrets it helps . And I usually place a flamingo way across my camp circle from my actually building , so the enemies go to it first, hit it, and trigger turrets
---
but it normally means if you‚Äôre camping at a train station with a TSE gun waiting to kill people
---
The sadness üò¢, though
---
Congrats, they are very rare!  I was farming ultracite in the Bog  Saturday and jumped out of a ditch and came face to face with a level 1 Wise mothman.  I was setting up for a photo, (didn't have the heart to kill a level 1 creature) and he transported/flew away.  I have killed a vengeful, stalking , glowing and plain.  I have only seen the Wise once now, ( haven't done the quest to summon the Wise yet)  I need the Albino and Scorched for the whole list.
---
I would rather them make a plan for repair kits(or a cap cost)and make the cost in materials outrageous than to see this bullshit coming into the game.  If you need repair kits to keep your stuff repaired then your not really the audience they should cater to. Because anyone who plays somewhat regularly has an over abundance of materials.  The only application this makes sense for would be the longer dungeon setup like the burrows. 
---
My point being that you shouldn‚Äôt really need the option in the work bench. Just leave it as an inventory item that when consumed or used fixes your weapons/armor.
---
I got my hat from the soil event in Flatwoods.
---
Someone had a nuke party at the Fasnacht parade two events in a row. Blew up the bots both times.
---
Losses regarding to what? Fallout 4 sold very well. 76 was a passion project, rushed but still.
---
I swear I have the worst luck playing this game, I never find good legendaries to use or to trade that people want because most I pick up are trash and can never save up because I‚Äôm always needing to buy supplies. I get happy if I can hold 3k on me at any given time. 
---
I‚Äôll gladly sell you a regenerating wood chest piece for 25k if you want some help relieving those caps /s. Lol
---
I've got a feeling that that's a new anti-exploit measure in the game. I had the server crash and roll back inventories with a friend and teammate nearby holding the server while transferring stuff to an alt. It doesn't happen if you join a friend's server, don't team up, and with the friend nowhere near you. Granted, this information doesn't exactly help with holding the responder bot, but maybe someone can narrow down what triggers the server kicking you a bit further: a teammate nearby, or a friend nearby? What if you're on a friend's server, and a random player holds the bot?
---
I use a Miner's hat when I'm in a tunnel the ones with the light on the front it's directional and I find it easier to see whatever's around me.
---
Ok thanks for the info
---
most of this answers are wrong...In my case, the servers are online, my main character is online, the second one what for i just bought a game, registered, this one gets this message, and i cant log in with that, so no, it doesnt mean necessarily there is a maintenance.
---
Is this available yet, I want to buy it if so?
---
it is coming May 7th, along with the "Ever Upwards!" questline
---
Shannon rivers from the order.
---
She deserves a chance to reboot her daughter Olivia, or save her team from raiders.
---
That quest ending always gets me. üò¢
---
Really?  I've been playing since beta with several people and I have yet to experience what you are describing.  In my opinion, current workshops PvP is nothing but a playground for high-level griefers.
---
Just nw of sunshine meadows industrial farm is a junk node on the river bank
---
I'm on the Xbox 1X and I have been having that difficulty since the recent patch.
---
Im sorry but its driving me nuts.  They are called  cryptids.  
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptids
---
Anyway I like your theory.  Hopefully we will see more of them in the future
---
Bump. I have 2 grognak axes. Both depreciate FAST AF.
---
Niggles: cause slight but persistent annoyance, discomfort, or anxiety.
---
Thought it ment something else but glad I looked it up. Ty for giving me a new word to niggle my gf with.
---
Just north of Berkley springs. A junk pile right next to a small pond. Downside is that there is 3-4 toads that spawn there, plus side free food off them.
---
U would need 50 ballistic fiber
---
Sorry for the super late response, but if you want it i'll give it to you for free. It just needs a home lol PC : Majistek
---
i've got one of those..........still in the box......test fired once....sorry 'how long ?'.....
---
might be ok as first strike with multiplyer, and what a range (if it had a scope).
---
but it was a vendor buy at a 'bite your hand off' price......more caps than sense!
---
stripped away so they can sell it in the atom shop later lol
---
You can sell the serums to vendors for exactly 500 caps why would you bother with selling to player's for less unless its out of the kindness of your heart
---
It's available only as a mod atm.
---
Go away thats mine lol
---
everyone else
---
I think you are right.  If PvP stays in Adventure mode then it should be completely consensual.  Good points.
---
Fast forward to 3:23 to see the glowing ghoul on the track.
---
why are we screaming
---
Also applies to some parts of Louisiana.  JUST SAYING, BETHESDA.
---
Hopefully they don't pull an Andrea Yates on this game.
---
I have been making my caps back really fast with this method after buying some cool stuff
---
I've died several times right as it ended and got nothing.
---
Ghouls are legit terrifying. I had one jump up and wrap its legs around me and devour my face while playing survival mode in FO4. Some high level ghouls spawned nearby too but after watching a level 68 ghoul rip through a super mutant like paper, I decided to stay clear.
---
Maybe the mod community could just make a game themselves?
---
Yeah you gotta watch out for  that.  
---
Yeah farm the power station or farm the pa spawn locations.
---
If Bethesda would give us a FC recharger, I could finally ditch all my partially charged FC and only run a few.
---
Why not implement the gtao style, clan mates are yellow, friends are blue. The colours line the circle of their name on the map.
---
you know this isn't that crazy of a theory.. wording of the teaser says we will be "customizing" these things. the picture is a makeshift backpack made out of a small crate fastened to a rack/sled. it's possible they will let us make it out of a cooler like the other commenter suggested.
---
Wrong sub lol
---
I‚Äôve dropped off FO76 to play the Division 2 these last few weeks.  The bugs this game has have honestly frustrated me as well but it seems to be a growing trend of problems with gameplay, bad assumptions to gameplay and just overall glaring issues that can frustrate even the most seasoned players.
---
I myself have had games that I enjoy immensely but when bugs and problems start to hinder play, I can only hope that a fix is on the horizon.  Bethesda in my mind should have patched bugs and glaring vulnerabilities/exploits first and worried about adjusting gameplay and balance second.  The reason is simple, without a stable platform, the rest of the fixes are noise and distracting.  Plus if the game isn‚Äôt more stable with how it works, all those adjustments won‚Äôt matter if you can‚Äôt play the game.
---
Wait...Every...day?
---
Is it behind the golf-course house?
---
If they weren't being added to the atomic shop I'd bet you anything they'd cost materials to make, and a repair kit would be the same as a mod. A tangible item that takes up inventory space. So no, I dont agree with that.
---
One of the lead champagne mixed drinks also went from corpse seed juice to carrot flower nectar.
---
Thanks, I'll have to try this.
---
Interesting. I have a Vampire's Hunting Rifle on me and a couple more rifles stashed. I do get Vampire's often but unfortunately, a Vampire's Handmade is still out there.
---
 FINALLY AN EXCUSE TO DO MY SHITTY MR FREEZE COSPLAY! "Okay everyone, chill"
---
They should also makes friends a different color.
---
Just need the right set up
---
No worries. I will do my best to remember to hold on to it for you.
---
AFAIK, mobs that spawn to attack your base will treat them as other things they could attack.  So if you have scarecrows out a bit of distance, the mobs will aggro on them first.  So that can slow down the mobs for your turrets to shoot at them.  
---
They're pretty cheap to maintain, so they can serve as a decent barrier if you like the look of them.
---
Ultracite anything has a 20% bonus damage against scorch and -10% damage to everything else.
---
If you are killing scorch beasts or the queen then ultracite is better. For general use the regular laser rifle is better.
---
I used to live there too lol, nice view and access to non perishable food is good
---
I'm tired of the people who are tired of the Bethesda please posts.  We are paying customers of a franchise many of us have played for over 20 years and are very passionate about the game.  We have ideas, and want to share them.
---
Besides, each patch they release makes even more bugs, so we have to report them.  And there are alot of bugs. Hence, we need to make alot of posts.
---
Once Bethesda fixes the bugs, then alot of these posts will disappear.
---
I hope you understand now why those types of posts are actually NEEDED.  We are trying to SAVE this franchise.
---
Yeah awhile back I picked up a 4 shot dragon as a drop. Freaking useless against a SB, *this was solo and quite a few patches ago. 
---
I‚Äôve since sold it and any other black powder weapons. It‚Äôs even money whether I scrap or sell.
---
I‚Äôve got ammosmith maxed and I constantly need steel or caps
---
ü§£ü§£ I literally just posted one as you posted this. Lol
---
i literally never find ore anyways so what‚Äôs the difference
---
I knew I was spelling it wrong but this stupid autocorrect kept changing it when I get out of school I‚Äôll fix it
---
She‚Äôs a bullet sponge. But Bloodied melee weapons destroy her. Especially unarmed. People in my server killed her in 3 minutes yesterday. It‚Äôs not a difficult fight but there has to be one person with a queen killer or effective melee build to get the job done.
---
oh right..it doesnt say that anywhere on the weapon details hmm
---
What console are you on?
---
Yes because everyone had Gatling plasma and a bunch of ultra cite weapons and lvl 100's and 200's
---
Once again, someone fails to understand WHY people are angry about the damned repair kits. It's not how the repair kits work. It's that some lazy dick with no interest of playing the game properly can drop cash for items that provide ANY sort of advantage. The repair kits open the door. It won't stop there.
---
Upvote for happiness
---
I main blackpowder weapons and let me say, it's fantastic! It's slow, it's tough, but man my gun fights sound epic, and switching back and forth between weapons to fire fast just feels awesome! Sorry I really love my set up and don't get to bring it up much.
---
I had the same problem. Try purple headlamp.
---
I've literally seen the queen go down in 5 minutes.  So, maybe your friends just need a better build or stronger weapons.
---
I saw it.very next post......still laughing
---
xbox
---
Always cranberry relish and well rested. You can get 9 spawns of cranberries at Aaronholt Homestead, sugar (snaptails are everywhere along the water in the forest). Gourds are the one thing I plant at my camp. 
---
I like to sweep through West-Tek, Steakhouse, and Harpers Ferry, mostly for the great exp, and mostly because I despise Super Mutants. In between I hit up my favorite events. If there is a lull then I'll travel to Grafton and that almost always pops Grafton Day(again) or Protest March.
---
I was doing events to get Sole Survivor.  Did the scorched one at Morgantown airport, some fist spec guy was there, conned white, waved, carried on.  Hopped over to AWOL armaments, and he showed up, was red con.  I didn't noticed as I was dropping all the gutsys.  Hit him at least 5 times, did not do a damn thing.  He waved again, I imagine laughing to himself IRL "haha that sniper thinks he can kill me!"
---
No idea how to drop someone like that.  PA guys?  Not even a concern.  It's the people outside of PA that scared me in PvP.
---
I think they are just trying to advertise the game, like putting "Fallout76" next to the word "incompetence" in every dictionary.
---
Ive made this suggestion for months and have gotten flamed for it. It makes no sense that i can't "boil" purified water, or just simply use purified water.
---
I did some research, i live in the mountains and  rely on a pump to collect dirty water to boil...and it takes a few minutes to to collect 20 dirty water(that gives me aprox 10 boiled)
---
However gathering from a river, i can spam collect and get 3x the amount in a fraction of the time.
---
Either make wells work the same as river collection or let us use purified water.
---
You're looking at it the wrong way mate!
---
What you see isn't abandoned houses and wrecks of cities.... It's FREEDOM! FREEDOM! FREEDOM!
---
... mainly the freedom to screw over people unpunished, but hey, that's still freedom, right?!
---
No it's not. People do this here, all the time.
---
wait wtf
---
Well just some plans for the PAs I use, like jetpack for t51 and reactive plates for Excavator. I'm not gonna buy stuff that I never use. Some plans aren't available for purchase such as ultracite pa and x01 mods. Bought weapons and recipes yes but even when my account was down to near 0, it was filled to the brim again in less than three weeks.
---
There‚Äôs already planters in Raleigh‚Äôs bunker. It should be an easy addition
---
I‚Äôve got the TS cryolater, saving caps for the .50 but I may table in exchange for cryo plans
---
Short question: and then ur here because?
---
Yes, I have similar experiences with stashing items affecting loot chances.
---
we dont need any mermaid outfit how are you going to walk
---
BUMP AND UPVOTING.
---
Fallout 76: Queue Simulator DLC
---
Pleasure :)
---
I think is perfect to describe what plagues the game: niggles.
---
One doesn't constantly CTD, or fall/walk through collisions, or face the dreaded 'Disconnected from the server' or any other severe game-breaking bug (or at least I don't in any of my accounts/systems).
---
Is just a large collection of small, often very 'localised' bugs and misbehaviours that once you have passed a certain - perhaps unhealthy? not sure about this one because I am guilty as sin of it - amount of hours played makes you feel like you have walked 22 miles through rough terrain wearing boots one size too small with small pebbles in them.
---
22 miles is 35.41 km
---
So I took my lvl 158 stealth sniper there figuring there wouldn't be much he could add to the fight and decided to hold two of the pylons.
---
I basically sat there in my X01 armor (with a stealthboy mod torso) and shot anything that came my way (making sure to tag the Sheepsquatch)
---
Here's the thing: my character has the grounded mutation.  
---
I used 20 stimpacks for the entire fight holding two pylons from start to finish.
---
No life?
---
Uh yes we do. Maybe it's only for water? Maybe it's just mermaid leggings? Idk I just want a mermaid outfit.
---
Sounds like a godly perk I'm still trying to fit it in my build.
---
Good bot.
---
Im waiting on unicorn power armor myself
---
had a level 15 2 shot way early on,then a l50 single shot,and loads others.
---
never actualy used any. Now i'm thinking, lose the dragon, its only weight,and......oy... mr. vendor - thats a dragon...could you up the price to maybe 2 bags of sweeties
---
I‚Äôm down! What level are you??
---
Seriously?  You want Bethesda to *rush* something?  That's going to work out well.
---
That would be fun.
---
yea the current bethesda engine cant handle anything moving
---
man, im the opposite, if anything the whole game has gotten alot worse since the last 2 patches
---
Me and My brother would be glad to have ya
---
There's is even a flair here for trading.
---
Personally, I'd rather see trades handled elsewhere, but only because I personally have no interest.  Usually there aren't enough trade requests to clog the board, so I would guess it's really not a big deal.
---
Might get more traction on one of the other boards, but it doesn't seem to hurt anything here.
---
What platform are you on? I have a load of cores from the last power plant I took, and I'm happy to share.
---
I mean, the dying part I can definitely relate to, but since the game tells you exactly how the mechanics work, I cannot relate to not understanding the pylons.
---
*raises hand* yep also cant stand this
---
 Its perhaps one of the worst  updates/bugs we have. I'm used to pressing the same thing everytime and they are now just messing with us.
---
Could be, or the damage is lagging and kicks in after a few seconds. If not that, are the players just spawning in or fast traveling? Also, the damage gets buggy for shotguns at a distance. I‚Äôve seen all of the above.
---
hopefully tomorrow they will have a new patch for all these issues, as they are affecting everyone!
---
I would be down. If the game is going down for maintenance or a big update I will be on as soon as the servers or update is done. GT BigBangTheory73 hit me up when ever. Mostly around daily playing.
---
want the 4shot ?     ........ and indeed, the sound IS awsome
---
I am able to attach mods to **unmodded** power armor parts. I was able to craft some calibrated shocks for T-51b and attach them. However, the T-51b has a red tactical light mod already, and I was not able to change it to headlamp bright.
---
Let me teach you a trick that's going to change your Wasteland life. Crouch down in first person mode and look right at the nozzle of the water pump then hit drink and immediately spam collect water while looking at the stream of water coming out of the faucet. This will allow you to collect dirty water from your pump as if you're collecting water from a standing water source. You can easily collect 10 plus Waters per pump this way.
---
Me and my pal can help we‚Äôre starting it around 330 400 mountain time
---
I dont really understand what you're trying to say?
---
They kind of are.
---
https://www.falloutmiami.com/
---
https://www.f4nv.com/
---
How do I even counter that though? I have nothing that can stop a player like that. I don‚Äôt even have a complete set of power armor, I haven‚Äôt worn power armor yet at all tbh. I‚Äôm collecting pieces but I haven‚Äôt assembled a set I can use yet. Not that it would be of much use seeing as I don‚Äôt have many fusion cores.
---
**Ranged**
---
Mainly the versus types, aka. *Exterminator's*, *Hunter's*, *Ghoul slayer's*, *Mutant slayer's*, *Troubleshooter's*, *Zealot's* because the 30% damage bonus is better than *Anti-armor*. I'd also like *Two shot*, *Vampire's* and *Executioner's* against generic enemies. *Quad* could be good but I find less and less use for it with *Drum Mag*'d *Handmade*s.
---
**Melee**
---
Anything with *+40% swing speed*.
---
**Armor**
---
*Weightless*.
---
What I had done is I had let the mole miners fight Freddie for a bit, then went and killed them at low health
---
Man as a foreigner this sounds like a TV-series. It's fascinating how different parts of the world really are, for ill &amp; good.
---
Sneak rifle crit, carry a shotgun to stagger or a gamma to irradiate those with exceptional armor.  Always use an AAE.  A few mutations for maneuverability and perception buffs.  Have tried various pieces fo SA and CA but never had a full set.
---
I have a few weapons that people have offered pieces of armor for, but I have been reluctant to give them up because I was hoping some balance would be instituted by now. Maybe it's time to try a full set and make better use of Stealth boys...
---
PA is horrible for pvp
---
Because some folks have no life.. they‚Äôd rather complain and play a game all day they hate then look and find something else.
---
I find it‚Äôs just easier to block trolls than empower or give them their 30secs of relevance.
---
To be fair if you make it 0.01 caps per ammo just like the fact ammo is 0.001 wieght
---
Actually, I can make frag grenades out of fertilizer so maybe you should just drop nothing lol
---
No shit sherlock. You're one dense mofo. The fact they're funneling you into an area you have to constantly see something that'll cost you real money is shady as hell. This is just the icing on the shit cake that they're adding this. They're changing the mechanics of the game to get you to see the option as often as possible. I simply stated why they changed the work bench repair mechanic. It's literally to put the option to pay real money right in front of you as often as possible.
---
Save the franchise? It doesn't need saving. Don't exaggerate.
---
Play it and see
---
Yeah Red and blue so i can pretend to be like Optimus Prime
---
Oh you silly sausage!
---
What about something like Mass Effect Andromeda?
---
Hi YoUaReSoHiLaRiOuS! This is lituenant YoUaReSoInTeLlIgEnT. Hands up for trying to stop people from living their jokes. Let them be.

---
&gt; I've been hunting for Deep pocket Leather limbs
---
Amen, brother, amen.
---
I didn't try Excavator, but I am definitely seeing it on T-60 and T-51b.
---
I'm glad someone is benefitting from it ; )
---
PA is pretty bad for PvP right now. Emergency peotocols is what I would pick though if you have to use it.
---
Seems to go in cycles for me.  My first Vampire was my 3\* Grog, which I still use. Got a 3\* Vampire sniper rifle  in stash that I want to sell sometime (I'm melee), but lately I mostly see 1\* and 2\* Vamp knuckles, boxing gloves, pipe wrenches and the like.  I have gotten 3 Vamp Deathclaw Gaunlets since I've been playing, I usually add a 3rd claw and turn them pretty quickly
---
Updates often, way less buggy and smoother gameplay. The game is full of content.
---
Srry dude
---
Sure, that's removing the preview. They didn't have to change the key
---
Agreed. I‚Äôm digging the increased vendor caps.üëç
---
I have a rule, no selling pipe or melee weapons, or junk mats. SCRAP ONLY.
---
All machined and legendary gets sold.
---
or.......gremlins
---
oh you poor sweet child, hold onto that innocence! never let it go!
---
What annoys me more is when the say in the voice chat ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just roleplaying as a raider chill out bro!‚Äù After u ask why they do it. Each time it‚Äôs like ‚Äúif ur roleplaying a goddamn raider get out of that stupid Ultracite Power Armor u numb skull!!‚Äù
---
molerats are casuals
---
Yeah that too! Blargh
---
It is a lot better than launch. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs perfect by any means but the game has come a long way since launch. I don‚Äôt think it would be a bad idea to give it a try. Although some of the quests are still pretty dry with the lack of of people.there‚Äôs still some cool quests as well.
---
Wood garbage, rolling pins and tire irons are all the loots from a dozen endgame bosses I've killed since latest patch. They absolutely changed the loot pool to shit. Makes me wonder what they are cooking this time, maybe legendary tokens in the atom shop?
---
I like the crystallizing barrel a lot more than the regular one myself.
---
It adds ballistic damage so you should get an armor piercing bonus with stabilized too :)
---
Lvl 160 stealth build.  More than happy to slink around the shadows and provide cover fire.  GT bowman700.    I'll be on probably about 7pm EST.
---
It‚Äôs improved tenfold there‚Äôs still plenty of bugs but it‚Äôs much better now what platform are you on i could help you level
---
Okay, okay, I gotta day it now.
---
Level 69‚Äî nice :)
---
That would be great! I‚Äôm on PC. I‚Äôll give you something for them if you want. I only have a few hundred caps but I have way too much of certain junk or a couple legendaries I don‚Äôt use. It would also be great if you have any level 25 or 30 power armor pieces, I don‚Äôt even have a full set I can wear lmao. If not no worries
---
I wasn't in a team or anywhere near anyone, it was just a good old fashioned bethesda server crash.
---
Adding links above.
---
I got lucky today, after killing what feels like thousands of legendaries I got my first three star with even okay stars.
---
Now I carry my vampiric Gatling gun everywhere.
---
Am I missing something? Wasn‚Äôt it always e) and r)? R to transfer something from preview and e to open the box?
---
All though my father and step mom arent vets, 60 and 51, I got them into fallout and we have great times playing together. It gives them something to do besides watch the terrible news and political b.s. Its been great to see them borh enjoying there later years playing fallout with me.
---
I fall into scorchbeast rifts alot, once you fall in, your bag stays down there
---
It totally would.
---
I don't think they are handmades.  
---
IIRC, I have a bloodied LMG, bloodied cultist blade, and one other bloodied melee.
---
I may also have a couple pieces of unyielding armor.
---
IDK if I'll be on tonight, but I know I'll be on Tues approx 6p - 9p EST.  
---
aj ninetyeight.
---
Ah thanks.
---
Are they going to fix the mod bug on Tuesday?
---
it‚Äôs decent if the enemy‚Äôs don‚Äôt have full assasins sentinel and i did everything to farm full assasins sentinel but I just cant get it I‚Äôm tired of grinding I i did this long enough even before survival mode maybe about 4-6 months I just get garbage drops when it comes to armor(for my second char)
---
For my main ( heavy gunner ) power armor is necessary because of the perks and I know I probably would never outclass a full assasins sentinel with any of those mods but I would like to balance it with any of those mods as good as it can so I got to find out somehow
---
I was hit by a bullet in the water yesterday by another player.
---
[Reloading, what reloading?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp5Rr-XXTDk&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
We used to just press r to open it up
---
A lot of them do, you'd be surprised how many professionals mod as a hobby. Quite a few people get their start by modding and get hired because of their mod portfolio, it's especially common for those folks to keep modding as a hobby.  
---
Total conversion mods are also a thing, though I think they were more popular in the morrowind days.
---
Nah it‚Äôs an Assassin level 1 deathclaw gauntlet
---
Have you also been nearly unkillable to others and one-shotting them too?
---
Is buggy but not unplayable like people might say. It has many stories to check out if you're willing to read or listen to them. I like F76 simply because it's the kind of multiplayer where you get to meet new people rather than an invite-only co-op which I'm surprised many people prefer over the other.
---
I have a camp set up over a patch of black titanium.  I seem to keep getting more without picking it up.
---
I have an AA Vats crits assault rifle (yes, the bad one) that does 50 damage.
---
I've faced sent/ass, and they die in 3 shots. How? Vats crits and chameleon pieces (with 24 AGI)
---
It's the best counter right now. However, there is a horrible new armor set nobody has collected yet, immune to all of that.
---
Any experience with the mod? 
---
Did you maybe compared it infame to other mods?
---
Idk, personally PA is basically a tin can when it comes to any explosive weapon at all, youre better off without it, even without sentinel armor, just assasin armor would be way off, and thats easy to get
---
I'll add you when I'm back from work in about 3 hours depending on traffic?
---
Dang, I'm on PS4 or I would drop a bunch for ya. Sorry man
---
.....I feel like there's a reference here that I'm missing.
---
Like I'm fine with how rare good stuff drops , but if I kill a sbq I shouldnt get a fucking 1 star mutant slayers wood left leg , even it's just like a 2* pump with some half ass decent perks that's be fun to use in the forest or something , or while farming junk in lower lvl areas
---
Not on consoles it won‚Äôt
---
I just got the game the other day, 30$ at Walmart. I'm actually enjoying it as much as any other fallout. The having to drink every 10 min is annoying, the constant rads are annoying, and having to press a dozen buttons to repair a weapon sucks. I like to explore and read. So far lots of entertainment.
---
There would be riots. Even if you couldn‚Äôt build additional turrets, it‚Äôd be the next repair kit. 
---
I would say that a second camp would be p2w in my opinion... that DOES give an advantage in a variety circumstances.
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it, I appreciate the offer
---
My gf watches me play since she gets motion sickness playing FPSs and she commends me how I can have fits hear in there with bugs like getting stuck in rocks when fast traveling, opening doors to have then instantly close, ect. She asked why dont I just play something else and and I tell her I love the funny glicthes. Like the break dancing boxes with cloths in them, rivers not rendering water, ghouls blowing up like robots.
---
Bethesda has so many bugs but some are just too funny to miss. I can deal with my character stumbling backwards like he stubbed his toe every now in then. :)
---
I've done multiple WS nuke events and have also noticed greatly reduced HRF.  
---
I don't think its a RNG thing and its not because its now instanced (I killed/tagged my fair share ... Molotov anyone?).  I think they nerfed it.
---
sounds good
---
You counter Workshop attacks of griefers by blocking and server hopping. 
---
I preemptively block highbies near me ALWAYS. 
---
You never engage w/highbies or others, in adventure mode. NEVER.
---
At your lvl, and if you want PA you gotta farm PA spawn sites.  Start at aaronholt head NW then Work south. Keep doing this till you have a set to cover a PA Chassis. Doesn‚Äôt have to match, just needs to protect.
---
When you have a complete set, at lvl 25, do miner miracles to get your own PA station. 
---
Work smarter, not harder.
---
Agree. It'd be ok if it didn't take so long to get from the pump, we can do without this particular piece of immersion. 
---
A dirty water collector or changing the recipient is long overdue by now.
---
Oh shit, that's worth knowing.  Thanks!
---
got to wonder tho ....if gouls are iratiated already........................
---
had both of these. looked at the stats and binned them,for better or worse there gone now.
---
I don‚Äôt know if this is it but I have sorta the same issue I think the game thinks your in stealth so does times x damage but then relishes and gives the health back
---
Personally? No.
---
I had reflective plates on my t51 before survival for nuke zones and bloodied melee attackers. It worked pretty well. However, the people I know who use PA who make it work use emergency peotocols due to the damage resist below 20% health. They are also bloodied builds.
---
Damb.
---
List? Their is a list? Where is this said list?
---
There are 5-6 posts daily about this. Check them or try out the game
---
At first I thought this was a troll post, but this is clever. Will try it sometime.
---
If there are Verdant season announcements, then there could be one for when shops have new inventory...
---
Well, wasting caps on a full set of cavaliers to occasionally pvp would be pretty stupid...  
---
I never said it was a pvp build. Because for pve, sentinel is obviously better.
---
Did you exit all the way out of the game and restart it back up? I once place down a set (DEFINITELY placed), and it seemed to fall through the floor. Totally gone. Relogged and nada (couldn't use it for 20 more levels at the time so I wasn't to pissed). Played again the next day and there it was in my stash. 
---
If it's gone for good, that really sucks, man.
---
How?
---
Mine is just east of the Station, not able to hit anything but the occasional miner that comes from the mine. Am I fine?
---
You can smelt ore at chemistry stations..?
---
All you need is acid. You can farm them helmlock.
---
Hells yea....that right there folks is quality.
---
Surely you jest, sir.  What's the armor combo?
---
Not with fireproof level3 and dodgy and  this one luck perk not shure how it‚Äôs called it helps a lot 
---
It‚Äôs more ore less like that :
---
I die in 1-2 seconds
---
Enemy‚Äôs die in 3-5 seconds (if full ac sentinels)
---
It‚Äôs still good and I still can kill them but try to sneak up with powerarmor xD they‚Äôre gonna hear you from far away
---
yeah really this is just a PIA now....
---
Those are good...but my legendary lead pipe is amazing!
---
worded that just in case you were serious.
---
I'm on PC, but I do have the Ripper plan myself and have done this before.  They are just rather costly to make, which is why I wondered if they had a dedicated drop somewhere in the world.  I'm not aware of one if there is.
---
Ah! I see you‚Äôre a man of culture as well.
---
I wonder if the red or blue lights are functionally dimmed?
---
I have one I'll sale you let's negotiate.
---
Absolutely!  My group will be doing it a bunch I'm sure.  Hit me up!  Gt Abinsursec2814
---
Weightless sentinel. Invisibility and sentinel effect, meaning no vats, and if the set is marine or trapper, no radiation kills, leaving only heavy guns stagger to kill people, which nobody uses outside PA, because armor.
---
Meaning, Weightless sentinel is virtually unkillable. A major buff to PA would be required to come close to countering this set.
---
* That is not feasible!*
---
It looks cute.
---
That is what the ultracite mod on weapon work bench says.
---
That about sums it up :)
---
No way it's intentional as it's losing them atom sales from people like me who would've bought the skin after getting the weapon
---
Thing is there are some very valid Bethesda Please posts that would totally improve this broken game (that has a non existant end game &amp; most of the few really good Please Bethesda posts drown in the Sea of usless posts), And players need things to do in a fully operational game, yes its tiring seeing the same posts... But the only ones to blame are Bethesda.
---
Im tired of usless posts that drown the informative and imaginative posts.
---
[Yes](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al0bl3/fallout_76_patch_notes_january_29_2019/), Two Shot now adds only 25% damage and Explosive adds only 20% base damage.
---
I'm a grown ass man and the only games I play these days are FO76 and Overwatch. With all my friends having families &amp; careers it gets a tad lonely,, but I enjoy them still :-)
---
Sometimes it's just lag, if you go back in a bit and check again the legendary item will appear.
---
Other times, a drill or syringer will be in place of the legendary (which I though was supposed to be fixed earlier, but I still see reports).
---
But yes, there are still times when no legendary loot spawns.  I've seen that on mobs ranging from 0-star to SBQ.  It's unusual, but it still happens.
---
Yea man. The one time I did it, I beat some dude wearing crazy power armor, 100 levels higher than me. Killed him probably a dozen times during the event. I felt a little bad but.. I didn‚Äôt.
---
as of last night 'gm't something similar, just hiccups, about the same frequency.
---
I'm an old git......no social...... play solo.
---
I Agree with the majority of the comments thus far, It‚Äôs unbelievably better than launch. It‚Äôs not perfect, but I absolutely love it. I recommend it to all of my friends, but still no one believes me enough to buy and play with me. But it‚Äôs whatever, I still enjoy it.
---
I hear you, let's hope it improves over time, but I'm not stepping away from it, I will play other titles from time to time, but I will always come back to Fallout. I have played Division 2, and liked it, but it seems more loot focused than Fallout, which for me is the experience, and the gear/loot is just extras to help you along the way.
---
Okay thanks for your help
---
I just hope someone tested them all xD
---
Because I want the best of it ...
---
the dmg reduction sounds awesome but does it outclass ap refresh with dodgy?
---
Or does it outclass everything else since dodgy reduces the dmg and the mod reduces the incoming dmg?
---
H√§ndmade l√§mps will cover expenses. Illuminate yourself.
---
The mighty Nocturnal boxing glove is king of slaying mothmen
---
are we seriously asking for mermaid costumes.....oh my.....
---
Huh.  I always wondered why the Atomic Shop hats weren't open like that.
---
Clearly Bethesda needs to hire some usability experts or at least some ux/ui designers. Their engine was cool 13 years ago. It's the epitome of worst practices now.
---
I say this with love.
---
There's also stalking. Didn't know there was a scorched variant though.
---
I'm looking forward to it. GT is K9MPSGT
---
Hmm so u have no friends on social yet u still lag
---
Wouldn't enforcer and my combat shotgun then be useless?
---
And sadly I thought about this but have never seen one in the wild... was hoping it simply didn't drop that way.
---
Sorry for the spelling error, thanks for the catch, will change.
---
Good luck in the future
---
it's a microcosm of life isn't it? some really exceptional people, a whole lot of average Joe's who want to be left alone, and a small handful of assholes who try to gum the whole thing up..
---
Killing legendary critters at that level isn't too bad. Look for the Horde event in The Forest region, it'll spawn 3 each time pretty sure.
---
It just happened. Was fun while it lasted.
---
More camp budget, if not including defenses, would be a stretch to call P2W.  I can see some arguments people would make, but I can't think of any that convince me personally.  I'm open to thoughts though.
---
More stash space I'd argue is crossing that line.  A second camp, even a small shack-sized minor camp, I'd say could easily be considered P2W.
---
Do you play in third-person mode?  I have the same problem seeing objects in that, especially with the bright variant of the headlamp.  But in first-person, they look fine.  I ended up using purple headlamps in general because they are a bit dimmer, but if I'm going to visit a place like Lucky Hole Mine, I just do it in first-person.
---
Turn in Technical data at camp venture
---
Preach it brother.
---
I read about that, and it does work really well, except **every** time I try it I catch a disease. Yeah, disease cures aren't all that rare, but rad x and radaway are everywhere. They should speed up the pump. I mean, I can cook 100 mutt chops in 20 seconds, but collecting 100 water from a pump takes 10 minutes?
---
Also two shot only adds one additional projectile to a dragon instead of doubling it. The same with shotguns.
---
Fucking cool.
---
Very true my friend.
---
Conversations and interactions are what have kept me in the game for so long. Fallout 76 as a fallout game would have been dropped and forgotten along side brotherhood of steel if not for its playerbase
---
Both have great perk cards, too
---
Not entirely, but the fact is, you can‚Äôt hit what you can‚Äôt see. A shotgun user will always be gunned down because there are really no sneaky shotgun builds that work well on players. You‚Äôd have to unload entire mags.
---
Block them as in blocking them in game? What would that change? And good idea about the miner miracles quest, I‚Äôm like level 27 now and totally forget to do it
---
I just bought it a recently because it was on sale, I was surprised at how over exaggerated the internet echo chamber of hate was (when I put it that way, I really shouldn't have been surprised lol). It's pretty much what you'd expect from any other normal Bethesda game to be honest, really fun, lots of bugs, crashes occasionally but not super frequently; though the most recent patch made it less stable for me.  
---
If you like the modern fallout games you'll like it, can't speak to the amount of content, but so far there's plenty to do. I've constantly got so many quests it obstructs my screen and I have to untrack them lol.
---
*You‚Äôre just lazy ...*
---
Bonus points if you buy 5 of them too bad I had to sell my 4 to make room for my luxurious place.
---
Yes? Whats wrong with that?
---
Exactly!
---
From what I heard, one shot fires 4. Wouldn‚Äôt a two shot fire two bullets at once but virtually 8? Because it has 4 barrels. So you‚Äôre saying in the first blast it fires 4 but in the second shot it fires 1 bullet? That explains why before patch it was so powerful.
---
The best way to combat the 1 shot is better armor and defensive perks.  Most ‚Äúone shots‚Äù are of the explosive variety so fireproof is an absolute must.  I don‚Äôt run it in adventure but it‚Äôs required in survival and if you max it out it limits explosive damage almost in half.  
---
By the same token, you need to ensure you have anti armor measures to deal with the OP element.   Tank killer combined with maxed out rifle perks can really present some challenges even those with a decent build.  My auto handmade is practically 100dmg per shot and with tank killer and armor piercing ammo it‚Äôs amazing how quickly you can cut someone down even from a fair distance.
---
Sell them to the vendors. I can get over 500 a piece off one serum

Go back and level up in other areas. Or make friends with someone who will carry you.
---
I don't think it does but PA really isn't that great right now even with EP. I can two shot someone in x01 with my bloodied 1* lever action and have yet to find someone really "tough" in PA although I'm sure they are out there.
---
I have 4 pieces of SA but I run a bloodied rifle build and with dodgy and serendipity, I can avoid a lot of damage. However, energy and rad weapons are my weak points right now as are most bloodied builds.
---
With skeet shooter I can consistently damage players from far away (Also given the double barrel has the best spread) but it could be a issue with shotguns in general. My buddy runs a Bloodied vats rifleman build and his damage goes through all the time. So weather close or at distance for me the damage won‚Äôt register or randomly will.
---
I think I just scrapped the same gun for it
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you can't scrap it, correct?  
---
I made one, looked through the available modifications, saw almost nothing, and I thought I noticed you can't scrap it, so no learning new mods.  Which makes it pretty useless for most people.
---
To everyone giving this hate, Mothman has existed for much longer than Fallout 76, and there have been many different alterations over the years in West Virginia. For the people living there, Mothman is like the boogeyman. Can you tell me exactly what the boogeyman looks like? Even if you‚Äôve seen a different artists rendition? Dicks.
---
I got my daily done at NAR Repair yard. Sloth random spawns that attacked the Super Mutants there. Totally random though as Ive seen all kinds of things(deathclaw, mirelurk kings, Yao Gai, etc.) spawn and attack there.
---
If you have a Disc Replay or similar store they have it for 30 bucks. Just bought mine last week
---
So it can be unlocked by scrapping?
---
I've never finished it. I got to the part where you get the quests for the artifacts and said nah. Should I do it?
---
Lolz.
---
You asked HOW to counter griefers, and I told you.
---
Quick! Someone send Todd Howard INERT 308 and 50cal.
---
We'll see if he can figure it our like they did when someone sent him a box of Bobby pins
---
I see you Bethesda employee hoonterion
---
I've had the same issues trying to attach mods to my lever action; it goes through all the steps perfectly but doesn't attach.
---
.. apparently it's a bench glitch that Beth hasn't fixed yet, which seems odd, cause it's a pretty major problem in my opinion
---
the legendary description of ts is that it shoots an additional projectile, meaning that weapons that shoot multiple projectiles simultaneously only shoot one more, meaning that the a ts dragon shoots 5 projectiles simultaneously.
---
well then its settled, this hasnt happened to B1SH1Op so therefore it's not an issue.
---
They're all RNG after patch 5. I managed to pick them all up pre-patch, and have found exactly **1** hunting rifle plan in the wild since then.
---
I'm on XB, or I'd install one for free. Good luck.
---
Not sure, I've not tried and I've still got the plans sat in inventory.
---
My level 1 Anti Armor walking cane with swingspeed and barbed wire mod is just like my grandma's!
---
Exactly I just exit and enter again and dont have the issue
---
With skeet it's not too bad.  My shotgun has range over 200 and accuracy over 100.  And of course I look for red gamertags to shoot...  Does the distance/damage scaling also scale chance to stagger?
---
There will always be high level people turning up, unless you just happen to find yourself on an empty server. 
---
It isn't designed to be a destination for lower level players.
---
If it's on PS4 I'll melt the area for you if you want, haha.
---
Ive been playing that game too between boredom streaks of fallout. Really like their build limit. But i had actually built a city so big my boat harbor keeps losing random chunks . But actually i just did the new questline and failed and apparently its gonna cost me 2k to retry. So raged i might have to go build another conan empire!
---
Getting stealth mode me was almost like getting marsupial the first time around.  It‚Äôs a game changer.
---
...and spacebar!
---
Just got a two shot the dragon. What legendaries do you have? Any non explosive heavy weapons?
---
But it's not, you simpleton (since you don't want to be civil, I won't bother). They would have to make this change regardless of repair kits being in the Atom Shop or not. In order to use repair kits without a workbench, you need to change WHERE the repair option currently resides. Right now, it's limited to the workbenches and going into the Inspect menu first. That inspect menu is how they're allowing repair kits to be used. When repair kits are available, whether they're in the Atom Shop or not, you will have to go into your inventory, use Inspect on the item you want to repair, and then select Repair there. It's the simplest way to code the new method. You are an idiot if you don't understand that.
---
It's absolutely adorable
---
What do you mean by passive? That it's not shown in the dmg number?
---
I‚Äôm not going to tell you whether you should or shouldn‚Äôt, complete the quest line.. You asked for an Ingame recommendation of an NPC, and I‚Äôve responded who and why.
---
For better or worse, it's not unneccesary. That's probably going to be the same screen where you use repair kits. Down the road you'll choose bench repair or use repair kit.
---
^^^^^
---
This.
---
*fires shot and ducks behind cover* "RELOADING!"
---
Preach it
---
For me it's the other way around. I was able to play on beta or at launch for 8+ hours straight without issue, later (jan, feb, early mar) whenever I tried to play I got disconnected after 10 minutes or 1 hour. 
---
But most annoying are random freezes. Game stops for 0.5s to 5s for no reason every few minutes. This happened to me since beta, but now is more often and longer than ever. Nothing seemed to help (ie. reinstall, lowering settings). Otherwise game runs fine with stable 60fps dropping to 40 in urban areas just like FO4 does (I've got i5-3570K /wo OC, GTX1060 6GB, 16GB). 
---
I just gave up, I really don't like to grind/farm things, and I can't gather supplies (limited storage) or earn levels (if you plan your character there is no advantage in having level greater than 50). So there is no reason for me to venture out anywhere.
---
For a short while a few patches ago the rewards from SBQ and even level 65 and 80 SB were decent, I got some explosive weapon and plans from their loot drops, I played most during that time. After latest patch everything is absolutely shit, 3 star legendary mob became so rare and their loot is usually worthless.
---
^^^^
---
What's the double time perk called?  Never knew there was such a thing.
---
I fight autocorrect all the time so I feel your pain.  I didnt mean to come off like a jerk it was just so consistent I thought it was an honest mistake.
---
I bet it changed so people buy repair kits
---
I can't help but think you're either not looking very hard or just not paying attention. That shit is everywhere. Especially in the Ash Heap and Savage Divide.
---
You can get the plans and upgrade them.  There are similar to the Mistress of Mystery gear, which also isn't classified as Legendary, but has Legendary effects.  The system may not allow both upgrading and Legendary status on the same item.  They probably kept The Fixer at Lv. 30 so even low-levels could get a useful reward from the quest line, but they probably should have given out the plans with it because it's not very clear that upgrading is even possible (which is why I keep finding The Fixer at vendors, I suspect).
---
You already have the key, so all you have to do is hop servers and check the dome - many, many times.
---
I personally redownloaded Reddit so that I could post about the thousands of issues there were with the game, and see if it was just me experiencing them. So naturally, I‚Äôm still a part of this sub, and once in a while I see people spreading misinformation, and silliness. And I suppose in the back BACK of my mind, Im hoping I will see an honest post one day telling me it‚Äôs actually worth my time to come back to the game. I keep looking after the updates, and every single time, there have been more issues introduced when they squash any. I don‚Äôt have much time to spend, and I really don‚Äôt like spending hours managing my inventory and the rest of my time avoiding things I know to be bugged.
---
How do you know how many hours you've played?
---
its just random, random people are assholes
---
it could happen to you tomorrow, next week, or never
---
Sorry it's not a perk, it's Scouts Life 4 magazine
---
Nothing is wrong with that. People are just judgemental and rude
---
I for one fully support our mermaid roleplayers in the wasteland.
---
This is already confirmed...
---
Always upvote for Tom Scott!
---
This guy friggin knows his niggles.
---
Okay you just clarified what I asked. Seems interesting to see many single shot weapons like the handmade shoot double when The dragon doesn‚Äôt. The more I look into this game the more it makes me laugh.
---
she counts as a legendary, she's able to regen
---
I highly doubt they're going to make blips disappear when you claim a workshop anytime soon, if ever. Hell, it used to be that if you claimed a workshop you didn't have your player icon put up for the world to see, they changed that to ***encourage*** PvP contesting for them.
---
pointless post is pointless. but thanks for cluttering up this thread
---
yeah im probably just blind
---
yeah? i havent seen anything, can you source me?
---
If you keep an eye on your map there will be an event "Path of Enlightenment" at the Landview Lighthouse. This one will require you to gather 50 bio-luminescent from the frogs and fireflies in like 15mins. This'll spawn the purple eyed one (Wise I think), won't attack even if shot. Just stands there.
---
Nah your good
---
So that's what was used on an event yesterday?  It was glowing whitish-blue.  GOOD FIND DUDE!
---
Yeah that makes since but it shouldn't happen that fast lol. The whole server came to fight her and we had her at maybe an inch of health and then she flew up and circled around with a full bar.
---
The game could be perfect and people here would complain that it was too perfect. 
---
There are bugs, but it's a great game. 
---
Much better now that there's a designated PvP server.
---
It's cosmetic (and noisy) only, no real use, so not a priority if you're low on caps.  
---
If you build one in your camp, plug it to a pressure plate switch, so your visitors can't let it on for hours.
---
is this rare or disputed? saw one this weekend.
---
yeah, its very annoying
---
Ummm, . . . you don't need to go into the Rusty Pick (just sneak around it). 
---
You need to go into Belching Betty. You're going to be facing scorched, not gutsies and mole miners.
---
The people that made it so we could rename our weapons in a Fallout MMO
---
i would like to know that too
---
Also exists as a plan
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:_Hunting_Rifle_Refined_.50_Receiver
---
1. Buy the neon letters
---
2. Buy all serum recipes
---
3. Buy all PA mods plans for all PA
---
These are 3 of my cash sinks. Getting to 25k caps is easy. Staying at 25k caps is hard
---
Yeah, 7 studios worked on this abomination, and then gave it to a group of yellow devs to manage because they all knew it was a lost cause. Todd knew even after all of his hype.
---
??
---
lvl 1 bloodied pipe wrench
---
I am Low lvl around 36-37 but my GT: Mullins11B18 if anyone wants to group and shoot shit, will get mats tonight to get ready for tomorrow. Need a lot of lead for 45 ammo and healing salve (forest).
---
That‚Äôs awesome, where did you encounter him?
---
Anti-armour rolling pin for the win.
---
Rusty pick had the quest marker on the door for whatever reason, and I just reloaded the game and it was filled with level 10 mutants. Cleared them and moved on. 
---
Is there a reason for the crazy level though?
---
I just gave up on that daily about 15 hops and no luck by NAR train yard. I work 12 hrs a day so I just felt like I was wasting my precious time at that point.
---
Fantastic!
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L5c8ZKCCf4OaNglGc516dl9AFxYWnMUDuhQbHjrlQkQ/htmlview
---
Looks like it should be a possible combination.
---
Perks don't fix a bad UI.
---
And perks still don't have loadouts.
---
Same thing as coming across a safe that needs picking, I can't think of many other games where I have to go through several different menus to swap what I need at the present time.
---
Damn, so I still have no use for my fucking corpse seeds?
---
bethesda logic :)
---
Even worse, it is designed for consoles. It is muuuuch worse on keyboard, all the design choices seem made in spite of players
---
I know you get SOME mounted head plans by doing the new main Lowe quests in Lewisburg, then some more side missions if you go to the train station there, and read the 2 extra white paper notes. I just don't know if these are random, or if everyone gets the same ones. I got 4 i think from completing everything.. but as for drops, I havent; heard of any either. Supposedly, there is going to be a part 2 add-on from what Ive been readying on here
---
There's no crossplay.
---
I'm playing on PC and the servers I played on weren't heavily populated at all.
---
It isn't included in the text that tells you its special effects.
---
if it doesn't work, also try queen of the hunt. it lists it as possible reward on that one too.   Also I got the marine protected lining from distant thunder yesterday. suprised the hell out of me. I'd done many runs on distant thunder and don't recall getting any lining from it before. (maybe they added that to the drop pool?)
---
AND THE BUTTONS TO SCRAP A FAVORITE ARE BACKWARDS WTF
---
I server hopped at whitesprings this weekend and i was able to farm bobbleheads and magazines like normal, sometimes they would be there, other times not
---
not sure about cap stashes though!
---
Outside of Nerd Rage, most of Intelligence is devoted to "Postponing things I have no interest in doing," like slowing the decay of weapons/armor/PA and likewise over-repairing them.  It's not the most exciting stat in the world.
---
I think they can only be bought at vendors. In all the time i scavenge around apalachia i never came acros a serum recipe.
---
I hope i'm wrong tho and hope someone can tell us that they can be found somewhere.
---
I‚Äôll come back but Division has VERY similar issues as Fallout ironically.  Enemy spawns in middle of nowhere right in front of you, nerf issues with weapons, AI issues with enemies, lag issues from time to time, stuck characters, etc.
---
Sadly I was thinking that someone reskinned the problem list of FO76 and put it in The Division 2... uncanny.
---
Definitely agree that the sheepsquatch has brought out the baaaaad üêë
---
I'm not going to go through the perk menu and swap out perks I need just for enough damage or to avoid being overweight just for a single fight. 
---
It's quicker to quit the server and rejoin.
---
Everyone, now that they changed it.
---
SBQ drops
---
The last two I joined failed, not sure if is due to too many leeching or just not paying attention.
---
Caps are so easy to come by and other players will happily sell you any junk item you want. The xp gain from a workshop is negligible.
---
I know that guy...B****ayBill [For Privacy Purposes]
---
I second this, tge friend list bug is a total mess and needs to be addressed as soon as possible
---
I would say the same, its a lot better than at launch, but with the condition of getting on sale, as I would not say it would be worth the full price, even though I did pay full price at launch.
---
id love this too, then i wouldnt have to bother my friend to help with muling protection as i drop stuff in world boxes and change characters to pick them up
---
Ah ok nice lol
---
Yeet yeet brother give me a min to find it
---
I didn't mind as much before the game got updated, but now there are additional layers to the menu system which just makes it more and more annoying.
---
Not only do I have to get out of PA, I also have to swap perks, I also have to make sure to transfer my bulked items otherwise they scrap and I also have to go through menus just to repair a gun.
---
There's still no "bulk all" or "craft max" option so I have to sit spamming spacebar for 10 minutes on each bench.
---
You can‚Äôt find them in the world unless a player drops them in a container ig, I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre sbq drops. I know serum recipes are. Just trade for them on reddit
---
Hmm so can't Vats them, been developing some tactics with my group on dealing with Assassin Sent users and we always deal with them who use stealthboy spam.  Couple of new ideas were formed last night and I know we will be testing them today.
---
 It's definitely good advice.  When the game came out workshops were decent.  Now not so much.
---
Can they not attack you if you block them?
---
You can become mutated naturally.  I got marsupial that way.
---
Would be interesting to see
---
153 seems a bit low. My lvl 45 Troubleshooter's Hardened Lever Action Rifle has 171 damage with 3x3 rifleman and bloody mess 3. Explosive effect should add 20% more thus around 205 damage. 60% demolition should give \~226 damage total.
---
 Selling 1400 caps worth of garbage a day should give you the caps to get any junk you want
---
I would like to see them changed for adventure mode except the azzhats who put them around WS, they should be open game for artillery and orbital strikes all day with no penalties!
---
No need to do it now since the nerfed the Top Hats.  :(  It's not really worth it.  Now I hit up the Blackwater Mines and loot everything I can get my hands on.  700 pounds later, I go sell everything to the White Springs Station bot.
---
To be fair there is a long list of stuff they need to work on
---
Hyperbole
---
I'm just looking for stuff to farm, I've got all the mutations I want right now. Just tired of farming same old stuff lol
---
Great post Rocket 
---
I used to get frustrated and annoyed facing the overpowered group but then I decided to modify my offensive and defensive techniques. 
---
I basically run a full maxed out explosive shotgun build and a full maxed out rifle build.  My explosive shotty is good for stagger and my auto handmade rifle is excellent for range.  I also run full fireproof to defend against TSE and full tank killer to cut through armor.   
---
Using stealth boy has definitely helped and we‚Äôll as the other muts like eagle eyes and speed demon and marsupial and adrenal reaction.
---
Looks nice my dude. I think I just recently found my new home as well thought I would live at whitesprings forever but I decided to move.
---
OK. You have a legitimate issue. Automatic respawns inside an event need to be turned off in Survival Mode.
---
That said, the anger and hostility with which you wrote this post is really distracting from your point. I'm near level 300 and I didn't even know there was an XP glitch involving traps. Not every TSE gun is the result of a duplication bug. I find that my RNG seems to favor Two Shot and Explosive weapons. Not always on the same weapon, but almost common drops for me.
---
Yea, playing by urself can have its benefits but I do wish I could hang out with some more friends every once in a while.
---
(Plus I have a heavy strength/charisma build üòÖ)

SILENCE FOOLISH MORTAL

Even more fun when you hit R to reload mid fight and it opens the item transfer screen on the corpse on the floor!
---
Soooooooo many fallout fans say that 76 is the end to fallout and for you to comment this gives me hope. Hope that some serious fallout fans still remain and that we arent all screwed by the shenanigans of these just joined fans
---
Those posts are always a lost cause. They could email Bethesda directly for a tiny bit of hope but here they might never see it.
---
And before anyone asks - no, you wouldn't be practically invulnerable with the Vampire's Ripper.  Vampire only happens when you start using the weapon, not on each hit.
---
You have my interest, and also another cooperating team to hunt spammers if you like.
---
I'll be getting murdered over and over tonight by a friend also.  Nice to see that active research mindset!
---
If you are waiting and relying on others views, you have missed so much! No its not perfect, sure there are problems but it is a blast! Depends on what you want to get out of it, if you are a griefer or want to cheat, well you might and to look elsewhere. If you are coming for fun, come on in the water is fine....
---
No, it is a bug everyone (ore nearly so) is having.
---
Not making a mod that you know the plans for- applying a premade mod you bought at a vendor or found in the world.

Good job! It's nerve racking the 1st time! And if your on ps4 I'll help you kill the queen I do it a couple times a day or if you just need advice on how to kill her
---
Thanks. I still haven't seen a way to work it into what I carry, between my AA lever action and TS handmade. But maybe I'll try it out. Someone made me a level 50, but it's still weaker in dmg than my others.
---
There‚Äôs a guy on my friend list called George, not going to state his full id. But he has to be over 60 as you can tell by his voice and the things he says. Nice guy
---
Congrats! I still have yet to launch one but I will very soon. The two times I went to do it, it bugged and I couldnt replace the mainframe cards and had to leave the quest. Lets see if the 3rd time is the charm....
---
Question: If it is true that "after the updates, and every single time, there have been more issues introduced when they squash any ", shouldn't the game now be more unplayable than it was in , say, the B.E.T.A?
---
Not being sarcastic or anything, I am asking a serious question. They create new issues in patches, yes, but saying they create more issues than they fix in every patch feels a little hyperbolic to me. I am afraid I cannot follow what you are trying to say.
---
Your assumption is correct. I have 5 characters on one account. One main, one alt build, two mules and a semi-naked character for testing mechanics.
---
At least when the Legendary vendor comes around, you'll be able to deposit these in hopes of something better down the line, so it's not a total loss.  But I think Bethesda means to keep gear ridiculously rare and randomized.  I mean, even when you do get a 3\* item, how often are they 3\* *useful* perks?  Not very.
---
Notice some of the cars are Vault Tec colors.
---
1) Treasure maps in the mire / savage divide for sure. 
---
2) It also spawned for me in the clarksburg shooting range plan spawn the other day but I already know it so I left it.
---
Why did you go to an event with your junk? Especially an event as hard as Encryptid?
---
Good one, my dude. I was being nice and to the point, informing the OP that what is asked has been confirmed, good job with your ironically hypocritical, passive aggressive post though.
---
again and again and again and again.  for days and days and days.  have fun!
---
was going for comedy but I was a bit pissed that I died about 100 times to some kid skipping school.
---
I've experienced this in 3 places in particular:
---
Lewiston (mobs L48+ mutants and a wendigo)
---
Gharity Mining, (mob L48+ mutants)
---
Path of the Wind (mob L48+ mutants)
---
3rd or 4th attempt at those locations yielded L6 scorched and ghouls and no mob.
---
For you to say this gives me hope that some old fans still remain for these new fans say that fallout and bethesda are just bugs and thats what all their games are but true fans dont see bugs, we see light and this game breaks that light. Fallout 76 has more issues than any bethesda game ive played and while they have solved some a lot still remains. You keep pushing man, i believe one day your voice will be heard
---
Are you shitting me? Skeet shooter is that good? I was just thinking about using some of my banked level ups on it this weekend.
---
I will let the downvotes speak.

Yeah, Stalkers explosive radium rifle

I use 4 leaf clover maxed and get a crit every 2-4 shots. I spend more points in better criticals and bloody mess to maximize dmg
---
I spend a bit of time on this sub daily and it can get pretty toxic, but reading these little gems keep me coming back.  Glad you had a good time with your new friend.  I'm just 59, but I have made many friends with younger people playing online over the years and am glad Fallout 76 finally opened up this opportunity to play with and share the Fallout experience with others. Thanks for sharing yours.
---
It should

&gt;  a team of two people over level 200 (obviously their main character  
---
This might be hard for you to believe, but some people only have one character and have been playing since beta. You don't need exploits to level that high if you put all of your energy into one character, as opposed to having a main and four alts.
---
Bad luck for me. I'll keep looking.
---
That was the experiment...and the Overseer, that poor, idealistic Overseer, was the test subject...
---
Repair Kits
---
Considering you‚Äôre missing the entire point, I‚Äôll elaborate. 
---
OP is talking about ‚ÄúBethesda Please‚Äù posts. You know, the massive amount of posts that say something like ‚ÄúBethesda please can you give us ‚Äòinsert trivial thing here‚Äô‚Äù
---
Now, you‚Äôre talking about bug reporting, which is pretty different if you even thought about it for a split second.
---
And make it so I can steal them! Muhahaha! 
---
Sorry tried to be evil, I'd honestly take a picture if I came across a camp and seen that. Would be neat-o. I always check out people's camp when I cruise by.
---
nuka orange... Rad resist without supressing mutations
---
Nope. It's a 3* bloodied combat knife that I have.
---
Whitesprings is where you go to farm one star legendaries. Otherwise, you have to actually play the game and hit up locations and events that spawn legendaries. 
---
I get a lot of good stuff from horde events, AWOL armaments, one violent night, and just wandering the eastern half of the map.
---
First of all, PvP is disabled during events, so DOUBT.
---
Second, all creatures in the Forest are set to low level forcibly with no level scaling, so DOUBT.
---
Again I've been playing since beta and I know "it's possible" to achieve. Please don't let me venting in frustration distract you from the real issue. Ill go ahead and remove that portion because it seems to be distracting those who are easily distracted.
---
There are a few really good crystal ore spots.  Just two sessions I managed to gather like 200 crystal ores which makes 400 crystal junk.
---
Helps with laser rifle repair
---
Too bad at the end of the dungeon you will most likely get garbage loot you have seen 100 times already.
---
The penitentiary in toxic valley is pretty good, as are miners in ash heap.  The miners will give you black titanium in their scrap, which you'll need for the excavator power armor missions.
---
Duh. Sorry.
---
Got them thanks
---
That is how the legendaries gain health. Sometimes you don't see it slowly increase due to lag.
---
it happens - lewesberg at level 25 - wave after wave of min 22 level s/muts,thats 22minimum  most 68 main battle tanks and 20 odd per wave. I died........a lot.
---
or Huntersville.............swamped...more legendary main front line armoured tanks,with the air full of lead and laser fire...........all on me.cause tiggers like to bounth.

christ this game can heat up. as my son commented "this is online gaming at its best".

truth be told  I had a ball !

Yeah I think I bought one for 1960?

Yep, and the "is it worth me buying or coming back to this"

I think what this person means is that ‚ÄúMermaid‚Äù might be too offensive to some people. I believe the proper terminology nowadays is ‚ÄúMerpeople‚Äù, or ‚ÄúMermaybe‚Äù, or Mermaybenot‚Äù.

I say go for it! Lets add fish fins so we can swim faster in the water! Come to think of it, I‚Äôm surprised this isn‚Äôt already a perk card.

Skeet just keeps the pellets clustered.  The actual gun is that good.  Long barrel and scope go a long way.  I feel like a shotgun sniper sometimes.

Great photo op

Get the chemist perk and dilute all your stimpacks. You can sell them for buttloads of money.
---
Wait, what?  Are we blaming everything on repair kits now?
---
Oh, no - even when you're 60 years old, you could get into a game and have a blast - As I get older, I find I don't have the patience to sit through a movie if it's not one I'm really interested in.  I'm almost 50 and being busy taking care of kids, pets, and always have my smart phone distracting me, but I still love video games.
---
I expect that without getting into PVP you'd get at least a few good weeks of daily playing FO76.  If you do figure out how to make a good PVP build, then even more.
---
I'm playing since beta and I play most days.  I'm starting to get frustrated that there aren't a few more areas with more variety of tough opponents  like Super Mutants.  I hate Cave Crickets and don't enjoy (much) the tedious nature of Scorch Beast Queen battles.
---
I had been hoping, that by now, DLC map expansion(s) would be released.  I want new areas to explore.
---
I also play a free Q3 mod game called Urban Terror since 2001.
---
I almost didn't play Fallout games because I was so mad that they were "wasting time" (my opinion) working on Fallout instead of making Skyrim II!  üòú
---
But, I'm glad I went ahead and got Fallout IV because I really had fun w/that game (especially love the Nude Mod üòù).
---
Anything past 16 charisma is pointless. It stops getting better @ 16 charisma.
---
I'm always up for a run.  GT glenn4moose.  Probably won't be on tomorrow night but the night after I should be around 8:30 PM EST.
---
Yeah, my family is like that. It's kind of cool in a way, because the community comes together to take care of it's own. My aunt Thelma would make extra food, and take it around to others. As my uncle Buford once said, you have two choices. Either become a coal miner, or a soldier. We've got nothing else here.
---
just for what it is worth, i finished all the missions months ago. I was just a one time thing. Well twice, I made an alt.  anyway, I hope you can let go on the mission a bit, after all none of the rest of us are doing them either.  
---
I have been a long time fallout player, so I would make a second player to go through the full story with, If I was stuck in your unfortunate circumstance. But I defiantly came across a few people who completely ignore the story, so you should be able to play the same game we all do with your main. Don't forget to play the game because of your bug. I let that happen to me for a while myself.
---
But keep up the bug reporting, seems like the community is going to be needed to find so many of these "something hiccuped" bugs.
---
Your title is clickbait
---
But 90% of the posts are "Bethesda please move the door handles up 2" on the door, these don't meet OSHA codes!" or some other bullshit. The market, so to speak, is so flooded with Bethesda Please posts that the good ones will never be seen by the  community managers and the sub community itself stands a chance of just becoming one big whine fest as people just stop participating in the forums to escape all this crap. 
---
I would like to see strategies, build discussions, stories, people breaking down the damage and resistance numbers, etc., than another "I want to be able to hang my photomode pictures on my walls in my camp!" I'm so sick of seeing that particular post I just downvote them on site. If Beth hasn't seen it yet, they won't. They are either going to do it, or they won't. Stop fucking asking for it. 
---
We need to re-institute the "Bethesda Please" mega thread to post all suggestions there, and let the upvotes decide.
---
Also check your keycard. If you're planning to use one you looted 4 months ago, you won't have it anymore, it expires too...
---
You shall not be ignored!
---
It‚Äôs a glitch that‚Äôs been happening since the last update/patch
---
Okay Mr. I-refuse-to-be-even-remotely-positive-about-anything.
---
The endurance tree hardly has anything remotely worth using to put a ton of special points into, so it's easy enough just to keep Fireproof permanently equipped. If you have more than 5 points in Endurance... I really question what you even think you're doing.
---
"Bethesda can we please have x"
---
I would like more building items, outfits and skins as much as the next person, but it would be really nice if the moderators of the sub could make a megathread every week for this sort of thing. It would be a lot easier for legitimate bugs to be better highlighted, instead of lost in all the cosmetics posts.
---
I trying to get that ball rolling (down a slippery slope)
---
Yeah, so much here is just suspicious.
---
Bloodied is a different set-up all together; you would want the low-health perks as the priority. Assuming you ( u/webbkyle03)  are a high AP bloodied-sniper character, try swapping 4LC for Psychopath and see if it benefits you more often?
---
Your grandmas pretty hardcore gamer.
---
That's kind of the point .... you're not SUPPOSED to be able to kill people in the event - but you can exit the event and exploit that opportunity to lay waste to all of the people stuck in the event. Instead of DOUBTING why dont you just try it out.   
---
Who cares what level the creatures are? what are you talking about? Clearly you weren't reading. PLAYERS were there killing other PLAYERS.
---
Some self inflicted wounds there too. When retraining in growing high pay fields like wind or solar energy (and many others like coding, IT, accounting, etc) was offered, coal workers refused. I assume on the silly notion that coal would make a comeback.
---
I'm on a cliffside myself and I've noticed there are 2 spots I fast travel back to.  If I get unlucky the first time - I just do it again and go to the other one.  2nd time is quicker too...
---
"so much" is suspicious? lol what is suspicious here? if you doubt try it out.
---
This game is full of amazing people, yeah some are asshats, we shoot and kill each other at in Survival but also can have some really special moments.  My group last night, seen a guy had the ammo factory and we were going to just take it from him (This is in survival, we go by it's red it's dead)  Well turns out this guy just started and learned about the ammo factory from youtube and google (He was trying to gather resources easier)  We explained to him this is a PvP hotspot in both modes, gave him lots of tips as well as items such as plans, we crafted him the best level 10 armor we could.  Crafted him a 10MM SMG, around 700 10MM ammo, aid and what have you.  Also made him look nifty with a space suit!
---
Agree, it sucks
---
Just buy any and all plans that seem mildly interesting.
---
Not gonna lie, I just browse these subreddits because it makes me feel less worse about buying Anthem.
---
What's your charisma level? I only get 430?
---
Very nice
---
I can craft mods and attach them if it's one I know how to craft, but if it is a mod I bought or found, it just won't let me attach it to any of my weapons/armors.
---
In the menu, go to challenges. Then go to World (I think?) and you're see a challenge of xxx/7600 hours played. And if you complete that your reward is 20 atoms :-)
---
thanks a lot,
---
and not at all! idk if you read the comments, but they say that the data mine reflects backpack mods having names like "high capacity/armored/refridgerated/insulated," that's a little more than suggestion imo. pretty much outright confirms that these backpacks will have special modifiers.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 I can sell you one.
---
Ohhh, yeah, that one... I didn't count that one =) It's an event, not an encounter.
---
 You noted that one says fill and the other says refill, but you missed the more important distinction.  One says hit and the other says kill.  Also bloody mess and starched genes are the only two auto picks in luck.
---
To all of the people "doubting" I can go ahead and record a video for you. Make sure you like and subscribe to me when I erase your "DOUBT."
---
Bethesda please
---
You are fine
---
I managed to find a spot for my camp that never gets attacked, is in a cool location, and is relatively near to whitesprings and watoga.
---
Around 12-14 depending on how low my health is and hard bargain adds another 9 charisma. I think the goal is +20 charisma for full effect.
---
You can't damage people who are in events even if you exit the event. Source: tried and tested myself during Fasnacht.
---
Fully agree what is the point of making all these outfits available to find and collect but nowhere to display them, what was the point!!!
---
Same with PA, we are getting differnet skins/paints etc for most of the PA's but again we have to hide them in our stash box, crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Check the challenges in game. There is a challenge to play 7600 hours and it shows how many already played.
---
The explosive shotguns can typically do a lot of damage.  My shotty can dish out about 300dmg and with fully perked enforcer, fully perked adrenaline, and adrenal reaction it can dish out a lot of pain.   Using fireproof perked out can help defend against it along with the right armor which many have discussed.
---
How‚Äôd you figure this out? Not saying you‚Äôre a liar, but I‚Äôd like to know more.
---
Until Bethesda patches the issue, you can fix it by using this mod: [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/285](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/285)
---
I'm using it and all is as it should be again.
---
I used to do the big bend tunnel alot
---
When I read this post my mind automatically used the guys accent from the ‚Äúwhy are you running?‚Äù Meme.
---
I'm one more "I want to be able to hang photomode pictures on my wall!" or "Let me store my power armor on the rack!" post away from just unsubbing. Every damned day with those two, and they aren't even functional requests. It's aesthetics. There are functional things that need fixing, massive QOL improvements that can be made, but those are being hidden under mounds and mounds of bullshit that won't have any real impact to the game. If you want to be able to display teddy bears all over your room, do it in RL. That's a thing you can do. I, for one, want functional laser rifles. Let's get that request front and center. How about a missile launcher that actually devastates in a way that makes the weight worth carrying it around? 
---
Game balance, CAMP functionality, quest bugs... these are the things that we should be bringing to Bethesda's attention. All this other crap is just flooding the sub and hiding the important stuff.
---
That was true. During fasnact. Im gonna go ahead and record a video for you, make you like and subscribe to all my content for making me go through the effort instead of just trying it out yourself.
---
It‚Äôs possible. I have a vampire Gatling with those two stars.
---
Pretty sure that's the player vending. The idea being that the vault dwellers found old soda vending machines and repurposed them to sell their stuff.
---
I'm 400hrs+ in , and only level 90. you don't need to level up to enjoy this [game.you](https://game.you)'ll get there, but if your smart with your perks,,it doesn't matter much.
---
I should add, I prefer to see whats down that road,rather than following quest lines. Still get there.
---
Your source is outdated. Try updating your research.
---
First one i saw, scared me shitless at level 20.
---
This, unfortunately, isn't surprising and sums up most of my experiences with this game, but don't worry you can now craft all kinds of booze!
---
I have had my camp wrecked once and it was the other night on survival.  A group was following us around and we kept trashing them.    So they decided to take a low blow and hunt for our camps.  Then they came back and started gloating about how they burned our camps to the ground.  (Tip, you don't have to use resources, you can pick your camp up and place it back down)
---
The cryo counts as heavy?
---
Throwing all these insults at a teenager and accusing them of cheating makes you sound more immature imo.
---
Im level 120, and can easily see how someone who farmed whitesprings before the nerf could hit level 200 without any exploits.
---
Sorry you are jealous that this kid gets to play more than you and as a result of that is a better pvp player in fo76 than you. 
---
I‚Äôd be laughing my ass off if some grown man was begging for his life over a video game, and I‚Äôm not even a teenager anymore.
---
I drove across Ohio several times. Eastern Ohio may be some of the prettiest land in the country. Rolling hills, deep valleys, bridges and trees galore. I'd live there if there was any work for me.
---
You are wrong. Everyone's map markers are the exact same colour.
---
I crafted two a Fixer and a Combat rifle at the same level. At level 20, a combat rifle deals 36 damage, while the fixer deals 43 damage. 43 is 20% higher than 36 (rounded down)
---
Always keep your shower in your inventory.
---
For around 2 months or so, in a 6 hour session, there's a 50/50 chance that'll I'll get disconnected from the server only once that day. I think I crashed once about a week ago. For ps4 at least, they've made vast improvements in stability. For the new Encryptid event though, it clearly has a ton of issues like some pretty hard lag sometimes, and causes server disconnects if you're participating (no apparent effect when it's running and you're somewhere else though). You still might a get a day or two here and there where you might crash or disconnected more than once a day though, but they're very rare for me. I have a friend though that typically crashes once a day though. So it's a bit random for everyone, but in general it's very stable now.
---
PSA: If you have a couple of points of END to spare use Cola-Nut and Nuka-Cherry. Is glorious. Honest.
---
They are not different. They are all the exact same shade of yellow.
---
I might have exaggerated everything for comedic value. Except him sounding like cartman.
---
Wait, you can craft Fixers? Is it like the Mistress of Mystery weapons?
---
I was kind of surprised to see more than one single digit level players in WS over the weekend.  
---
Give my experience(s) in WS, you should probably be in the upper 20s and have a good weapon (and/or a higher level escort for when you get into trouble)  before venturing too far in, especially during a nuke.  
---
The northern road approach is going to run you though some mutants, and from the SW you'll find a pair of L62 ghouls at the lookout tower, L30 robots at the statue, and a SB at the fissure...
---
Except the "unruly" golfers (L1-9, from what I have seen), nothing in WS is going to be under L32 during non-nuke times, and L42+ during nuke events.  
---
Not counting the SB that occasionally decides to attack,  the highest I've seen so far has been a L91 deathclaw, and the toughest a pair of L68 radscorpions.
---
i think  its the assasian's handmade (+50% damage once your opponent reaches 40% health) I've gunned down everything from scorched beasts to legondaries with it, I pair it with maxed out tank killer and maxed out glow sight and expert rifleman
---
it does better than my TSE handmade
---
YMMV
---
Ik this is a month old but I'd live this, my character wears the explorer's outfit with a Ushanka and Gas Mask w/ goggles, snow is what I want in any game really
---
The perk thing is annoying , I‚Äôll give u that
---
Good doggy?
---
Rejuvenated?
---
Aquaboy?
---
Lead belly?
---
I only have 5 points and going through a bunch of menus to exchange between Good Doggy and some specific perk to stop fire damage is a complete waste of time. It's quicker to just quit the game and rejoin.
---
The sheepsquatch impostor drops plans for it. I bought them off another player.
---
That‚Äôs... very insightful.
---
People don't understand how poor the south is. It's why they vote red because the blues keep telling them how much privilege they have.
---
Great description ha ha ha
---
Correct....but at end game....even with a 1\* instigating lever action....most mobs are 1 shot kills and if you only need to refill 55% of the crit meter (Crit. Savy active) then you don't get the full benefit of psychopath because your meter never drops below 45% which is why 4LC is better
---
I honestly think its 100% random, you will get streaks both ways
---
this weekend my regular teammates were not playing, so i server hopped at Whitesprings
---
Soem runs id get no legendaries, some runs very few, then bada bing some servers it was like every other enemy gave a legendary, with 2-3 stars all over
---
when i find those servers, i stay on them and milk them as much as i can

My grandfather was a coal miner in Hazard Kentucky.   He lived through the collapse of the coal economy there. My father was a cornbelt farmer, and lived through the collapse of the family farm. I was tool and die maker in the Rust Belt, and lived through the collapse of manufacturing.  All throughout America are small to medium sized enclaves of abandoned people and places.  Some could even say rural America has become the new ghetto. Here in my current residence of Indianapolis, I see enclaves of people and places that have been largely cut off and cut out of society.  While the story is told in West Virginia, most people can relate to it on a personal level.  The problems highlighted in FO 76 are America's problems.
---
They absolutely did not in any way, shape, or form have to change the way a workbench repair worked because of repair kits. There is no absolute reason they need to be in the same menu. They did it in the hopes that if you see the repair kit option often enough you will use it. End of conversation buddy.
---
Yes I am, I am also tired of "Anyone else \_\_\_\_\_\_" posts but that's a reddit thing, not a fo76 thing.
---
I'm from the UK and I'm a 1st Gulf War and Bosnian War veteran. I'm a spritely 52! so I do confirm it's not all kids on here!..saying that I never actually grew up. If I pick up legendary items for lower levels I make my way to flatwoods rather than dump them. The community in this game is brilliant towards each other...keep it up guys!
---
Do you mean Friends?  People in your group are a different shade of yellow (that‚Äôs its own design problem) but to say they‚Äôre ‚Äúexact‚Äù is factually incorrect.
---
I was going to see if you needed a team, but after looking at your post history, you're clearly a racist and terrible human being so good luck gaming on your own.

I'll keep that in mind. I only have 2 points in end for Rejuvenated but i could switch it for Cola-Nut
---
Armor paint can only be done by technical data turn in or buying the plans from another player. Vendors do not have the paint plans.

My critical bar fills after 4 shots using my unyielding armor and 9 luck points. I find it more of a hassle to press the critical button. I only use that on scorch beasts and stuff. Good luck finding your perfect set up!
---
We need a pensioners guild!
---
I still do that......loads of ammo and junk,but at 90, xp is crap
---
If you use berry mentats you can still see a red aura around a fully stealthier player fyi
---
I think there are two types of people in the world - ones that can go to bed with a sink full of dirty dishes and ones who cannot.  One type of person thinks it's no big deal and can wait until morning or whenever, the other thinks 'that's not right' and it annoys them.
---
For me it's the latter.  There isn't much reason to add an extra step when the prior method worked fine - there is beauty in simplicity.  The other part that irks me is there is touch of lag between the input and uptake.  It's not major, but it's a hiccup.  The hiccup for me breaks the rhythm of things and is just mentally jarring.
---
It isn't the end of the world, but it also isn't refined.  Sometimes those little touches make the difference.
---
What if you wanted to use a repair kit while in the workbench? If they didn't change it, you wouldn't be able to, and then people would complain that they have to drop out of the workbench to use a repair kit.
---
Who's Gary?
---
Pa sucks for pvp but if you must use it, emergency protocols and targeting HUD is king here. Without those there is basically no purpose of using power armour in pvp. You can also replace both of those benefits with serendipity 3 and berry mentats respectively. Serendipity 3 doesn't work in power armour so dont try to stack it with emergency protocol
---
Add me in game now if you play on pc (Setvin) to speed up my video evidence procedure. Or just believe me.
---
So what else in the fo world requires intelligence ? To have any damage perks besides explosives and energy weapons wouldn‚Äôt make sense
---
I found a 3* nocturnal dragon, i have a vats rifleman build, so thought id try it out at a fissure site. With nerd rage activated, and a critical ready to go, a vats critical headshot on a scorchbeast dropped it to about 10% of its health. At nighttime it kills them in one shot. (Nocturnal affix). 
---
Against the SBQ, i can see her health bar drop a bit with each shot. But it breaks, long before the fight is over. Even with The gun at 200% condition, i only get 20 or so shots before it breaks. Since i use nerd rage, i dont run the gunsmith perk. That would help keep it from breaking though.
---
After last patch, i didn't event encountered 3\* legendaries in nuked WS :(
---
Crits are good for PVP too
---
Geez. Calm down.
---
If it‚Äôs a lost cause then why do they keep dumping money into it?
---
Requests and feedback are desired by Bethesda but they should all be in the same thread or on the suggestions forum on the website, not a new thread for each thing here.    
---
Also we're past calling this game "Broken" with "non existent endgame".  It has a long way to go to reach its potential but millions of people are still playing months later with hundreds of hours of playtime.  Endgame is there even if you don't see it.
---
Looks like my plan for the day is to hunt down a cryolator
---
Can someone explain this mining bonus? Does it only work in certain spots or with certain resources?
---
Exactly this. The only reason they changed it was so we see the repair kit option while repairing often enough that they hope we will cave and use them.
---
yeah its getting worse and worse, its sad i used to non stop defend the game, now its doing all it can to make me hate it
---
cmon bethesda, its been long enough, get your shit together and fix this game ffs
---
&gt;  but since nuclear plants wold melt down as soon as humans vanished... well that's getting meta
---
Not really. Modern reactors will shut down rather than melt down if abandoned.
---
I can't look forward to any dungeons until the legendary drops are fixed (3üåü bosses should drop 3 üåü gear, always).
---
Not the above commenter but I feel the same way. For me it‚Äôs that, while they squash bugs, there are still tons of bugs from the ‚Äòbeta‚Äô and even though they‚Äôre adding more content a lot of that content is being added to an unstable foundation. 
---
I got excited around patch 5 I think it was, which ever one they made the big CAMP changes, and I got back on after not playing for a week or two. I only lasted two hours before putting the game down till the next patch. 
---
They had made great changes to CAMPS and budgets but didn‚Äôt fix some of the bugs with building. I had started building a new CAMP and ended up with a couple walls I couldn‚Äôt remove no matter what I did. They just stayed floating in the middle of my CAMP. 
---
The worst are the disconnections, freezes, and crashes. Still, any time I capture a workshop my game disconnects. The two times I‚Äôve tried launching nukes, the game has disconnected. Basically, any time I initiate a quest/event that involves a number of other players my game disconnects. 
---
I still play a couple times a week but my desire to play has plummeted. I‚Äôm hopeful that in 6 months to a year it‚Äôll be a fun game to play.
---
No worries lol
---
Yeah man I was a fat teen growing up and it never really felt cool being teased about that. Now I‚Äôm somewhat grown up and walk around with a six pack but I still
---
feel like a ‚Äòfat ass‚Äô because that was literally one of my nick names as a teen. And damn straight I would‚Äôve played fallout all day if I got to miss school lol.
---
My point is, the best way to deal with griefers in this video game, and it is a video GAME, is simply to leave the server (I mean how hard is it to find another messenger event) or become the griefer. 
---
I choose the later, but every now and the I find a true slayer, and I‚Äôll simply leave the server. No sweat off my back.
---
Thoughts of Mothman
---
Idk
---
Fill me in, why does the community hate turret bases?
---
It‚Äôs to make you want to use repair kits.
---
Hacking.  But terminals that require level 3 hacking, with no lockpick alternative, are quite rare.  And to be honest, when faced with a level 3 hack, I don't even try to solve it "correctly."  I'm Marsupial, which makes me a bit stupid, and the words are 10 characters long.  I just keep picking random words and back out and try again until I solve it.
---
Supposedly, it also dictates the length of durability bars on equipment you find.
---
Username does not check out. Lol
---
I'm a little late but I've very much been enjoying the community. Most high-level players are actually really kind and generous to new/low level people. I haven't had any griefing problems yet and my interactions with other players have ranged from neutral to really fun. I'm hoping to find a group to play with at some point!
---
As far as servers go I haven't had issues with waiting for servers and there are always people online and actively playing. That's a big plus in my book.
---
&gt; and no one does anything about it.
---
Nobody can. Several documentaries on this, they have considered every angle and no one has any idea how to put it out. The few ideas that have even a small chance of working are so expensive it would break FEMA and the state together.  
---
And it is a huge sinkhole waiting to happen now that a lot of the coal that provides bedrock has been burned away. This means the land will not be safely usable until it all caves in and settles.
---
It is a fascinating event, and a bad situation all around.
---
This is my daily routine I follow to level up about 2-3 times a day.
---
1. Get fully rested xp boost: 5% 
---
2. Eat cranberry cobbler: 5%, now you're getting 10% xp for anything you do for about 1-2 hrs.
---
3. Go to Whitesprings and murder everything(not the robots cause they will murder you) and pick sweet loot to either keep or sell.
---
4. Go to West Tek, murder everything, pick up sweet loot to either keep or sell.
---
5. Server hop, rinse and repeat til you to required level or get bored grinding.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Right on bro :D share the knowledge!
---
Like to keep yourself on your toes I see
---
Pretty good.
---
it's okay, but nothing you would sell
---
It's true.
---
Yep I run a low hp build, I run Sent/assassin armor on a sniper build. The low hp dosen't budge most of the time, you only have to worry about taking rads from sources. You'll be so tanky that you can take a hit for miniscule damage, then stand still, and you'll take basically nothing all while gun fu-ing every target in vats range.
---
I am so glad I I‚Äôm not the only one who dislikes the new workbench and a delay bug caused me to lose my dragon I loved that gun so not happy  üò° please leave things alone that work just fine,
---
yeah it seems the last patch really borked something
---
Maxed rifleman, Maxed Expert rifleman, Maxed tank killer, Maxed sneak attack, calmex.    
---
Hidden status showing.  
---
Using a 1\* lvl50  hardened hunting rifle (112dmg?) with anti-armor.
---
Headshot on target with the 2.5x damage notice from sneak.
---
Target's health did not change **at all.**  
---
(Note: I actually shot twice to make certain it wasn't server lag or something - both shots had the same result)
---
The problem is that these invulnerable builds do not suffer in damage output due to the existence of TSE etc.  Yes, you can beat them, but doing so requires very tailored builds that have no value outside of killing these SA/CA invulnerable builds.
---
100% agree with you.
---
if i get one more white wolf fedora I swear to god
---
Read his comment history, I wouldn‚Äôt want to play with him.
---
This is really cool. I'm at work so can't sit and watch the whole video, but I wonder how many people a system like this can handle a day? Seems like it works pretty well for a smaller population like a college, but could it adequately serve a general city population, or would that just turn into a train system?
---
Neato.
---
Wait what!! Dude someone deserves a legit thank you letter holy crap!
---
Would you happen to be color-blind?
---
The colors on the map are different.  I ran a map engine through a color blindness simulator, and the colors converge on Tritanomaly and Blue Cone Monochromacy, and are identical on Tritanopia and Achromatopsia.
---
Vampire is pretty nice to have.
---
Corpse run. Or have a friend there and fast travel to him.
---
Please go back to your echochamber over at r/fallout
---
See it wont even let me craft them when i know them and mods that i bough i cant attach
---
It's obviously better, but I still don't think either card is very good.  Instigating lever action is far and away the best one star item in the game, it doesn't need help from gimmicky cards.  Also level 425, so I'm well aware of the end game.
---
if it's in range of the club, it deserves to burn. however, any chance you're in nuke range? cause.. that'll destroy it.
---
they wont fix that, but there are alot of great new items to buy at the ATOM store! hooray?
---
your logic is sound. unless ALL can 'MAKE' said items,keep them off.
---
I don't know why the "Known issues" isn't still stickied, and why there isn't a "requests thread", also stickied, that is edited by the mods regularly so that their original post includes all suggestions. If people look at those two things they will see both what has been suggested and what Bethesda is currently working on. That will free up post space for more new discussions.
---
Do cranberry relish for +10%.
---
If you unequip the lockpicking perks when not picking locks then thats on you boo. Dont blame the game because you cant minmax every single aspect at all times.
---
I wouldn't be too sure about that as the current vending machines you see here and there (especially around train stations) were seen being used in pre-beta footage for player vending at camps when they were talking about it (some stream or video). So it's not unlikely that they'll just continue to use them. Plus, we have no idea what the assortment of lockers are (fridge maybe?, appears to have copper tubing which can be used in cooling mechanisms, but at the same time, that's as good as the image quality gets from the video), that new terminal and whatever it's function might be, and then there's the cabinet underneath the soda fountain that might serve some other function or could simply apart of the fountain itself (doubt this though).
---
What's also interesting is the red sign with the cap and "sale!" on it. They mentioned that they were implementing a way to make your camp visible on the map for other players, so I wonder if that specific sign might enable that feature (or it could just be a sign, but the shape of it seems to unique).
---
Also, behind everything else and in the window is what very distinctly appears to be a gun rack from fallout 4. 
---
There's a ton of ambiguous stuff in this image.
---
Come over to the filthy side where those aren't allowed. r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Welch and Mount Blair were good to me around 30, although sometimes a lot of the miner's were already dead. 
---
I did Pleasant Valley the other day at 35, mostly by staying up on the cliff behind it and sneaking a lot. Had lots of high level super mutants who were surprisingly not spongey. Definitely go a level out of that.
---
Dense, you just have to get stupid lucky at a vendor, find someone else who can craft it, or buy it in the aftermarket.  You can't learn it through scrapping.  Dense mods randomly come up at the Watoga, inner Grafton, and Camden Park vendors for me.  Marine Dense isn't too uncommon, but the Combat Armor one?  Good luck.  I've found *one*.  Same with Leather and Metal.
---
And no, their "representatives" at Whitesprings don't carry mods, so don't bother looking there. üòí
---
missing the hex values.....keep looking

---
Yep - even at level 90+  always at the low end of caps. I'm doing something wrong  :-)
---
Let me check when I get home from work, I know I have some, but I don't remember exactly how much.
---
I'd be willing to all of it for a decent price.
---
1500 hours in and I still like it :)
---
Do the Unsolved side missions. Check out the post boards in train stations, I've already unlocked almost all the mounted heads
---
Holy hell, op is a scumbag.
---
Thanks for the heads up dude....
---
Google maps tells me that I'm about 2 1/2 hours from there.  Whelp, looks like I'll be dragging my wife along on a little road trip this summer!
---
Whoever designed the UI in this game is... Well... Hoo boy they're bad at it.
---
also, i noticed since the last patch, simply running from one location to the next causes the whole game to not load in the new area properly- simple example, i ran from the whitesprings resort main entrance over to the whitesprings train station.  After the last patch, now when i run there the whole parking lot is empty, the walls of hte train station are gone, and it takes a  long time for the game "catch up"
---
sometimes even when you simply run to a new area, the game is so far behind, all of a sudden you get hit my invisible enemies that attack before they are even visible on your screen
---
Ive been playing since november and this is the worst its been yet, every new patch breaks more and more of the game geez
---
It aint' a Bethesda game if there aren't quests that are permanently broken for you. I'll never be able to kill the 10 "unrulely golfers" at the golf course.
---
OY.........get off the frigging grass
---
The way things are now, we need a process to turn meth back in to sudafed, since meth is easier to get.
---
Always "love" those in F2P titles.  That was one of the number one posts that grinned my gears in the Planetside 2 subreddit.
---
if I can get this new characters build done before launch I'm def down, GT is Invader Down
---
Destiny players are way worse TBH. I hate going to that page.
---
Wow. 
---
Ridiculous.
---
because BGS can't UI their way out of a paper bag, apparently.
---
It's literally all people are doing right now. It took me about 10 minutes, the first event I joined had people griefing it. The people who say "oh that clearly can't happen" obviously haven't played the game in a while. It's clearly happening. Join survival mode and try to get into an event see what happens for yourself.
---
Maybe at pleasant valley station. It's be close you would have to travel and see if camp covers the junk and the stream behind it.
---
The main reason could be not implementation.
---
I play sometimes with 3 senior citizens ain‚Äôt joking they even crack jokes between themselves about being old ( I‚Äôm not that old lol )
---
Supposedly, they drop off the Scorchbeast Queen.  I've never received one though, and I'm beginning to think that in order to have a chance at one, you first have to get past the ten thousand Prime Receiver plans she drops.
---
First off, I can't imagine why anyone would get to a workbench to use a repair kit. It doesn't make sense. But they could easily have added it to the screen as an option at the bottom. The little screen pops up they says Material cost steel 3, alum 2, X for yes L3 for repair kit. I'm tellin you man, they want you to be familiar and comfortable with the inspection screen where the repair kits will live when not a work bench and seeing the kit button so you don't ever forget about it while you're questing.
---
 Not to the point where I'd make a post about not liking those posts.
---
Ah, damn. Guess I'm stuck with a level 30 Fixer for now.
---
Oh man, did you notice my comment is 4months old? Of course i now have more than 200 of this useless things.
---
wandering long enough in applachian, i have ton of boiled water don't use.   
---
If the recipe have dirty water, build a faucet thing and equip a hazmat suit on?
---
Also happened near Watoga.   Legendary Ghoul got me there with an explosion after I killed him.
---
People should be punished for posting shit like that.
---
We had manta man
---
*l√§mp
---
i agree, all our adventures and memories are in those pics, it kills me to delete any of them
---
since a whole new quest is about taking pics then i seriously hope they listen to us and give us ALOT more pic space
---
The wife and I are already talking about going back to the state for a fallout themed vacation, I would love to see a fallout convention in the state.
---
It could be dead of winter and I would still go even though I hate those icy country roads.
---
Maybe instead of buying them at the atom shop, you could build them. I'm still on the fence about this. I have a tse dragon that even after repairing to 200% it still breaks after about 12 shots. Great for level 50 to 80 scorchbeast, but not SBQ.
---
Delayed to May.
---
We're still working out a way to do event timers. The issue is there are certain events with "fail" conditions that can skew the timer, so you could potentially fast travel to an event and have it fail.
---
Because one can like the game and yet be objective to its issues.
---
Time to get tested for color blindness, buddy.
---
Charleston is the biggest city in the state :p
---
Thanks for this!  Forgot about that perk!
---
Hi level player walked by? There can be some really high level stuff around there (compared to the mine you're heading for). I ran into 3 level 30 something wendigos around there. I was able to hop onto the roof of the Rusty Pick to take them out (marsupial not needed), but I would've died if I stayed on the ground. 
---
I went west around the Pick when I went to the mine for the quest. I did not need that noise at level 25.
---
Whoa, looks like OP is legit human garbage. But is also a racist Republican who hates Donald Trump, a true unicorn if I've ever seen one. And also really into Gossip Girl.
---
OP contains multitudes.
---
yeah after the last patch its as if the game doesnt even want me to play it anymore, its like im constantly in fear of when the game with crash next
---
Those goddamn repair kits
---
Oh I hate those radscorpions. I tag them for the experience and kite them over to the robots to deal with.
---
I am muslim man with good build, Praise Alah! Play for me!

GT: Alahakbarababi
---
Did you read my entire post? I did describe how the glitch allows people to spawn kill you. When your character is dead literally the only way to leave the game is to alt f4. Me "leaving the game" means I don't even get to do my quests. Literally the legendary quest is "do 20 events in survival" and thats basically gasoline for this glitch. All the noobs are running around like stupid getting merced trying to get a stupid legendary weapon while higher levels group up to kill them. Im not the type to shut up and leave. I honestly felt like I took the high road considering how fucked I am. If you dont like it well... take your own advice.
---
Lets do it!
---
Gt:Alahakbarbabi
---
Putting the players icon on the Workshop is fine. 
---
The player's location updating in real time create unnecessary advantages for would-be raiders, though. The process changes significantly if I have to actually haunt a claimed workshop until someone pops up, and remote sniping becomes almost impossible to do predictably.
---
We are aware of the stats disappearing and are investigating this
---
Unless im insane im 99% sure the enemies scale to the level of the player they spawned for. So if a lvl 100 ran past the area before you got there then the mobs are gonna be super high level.
---
Does anyone know if you can obtain the .50 receivers from scrapping regular hunting rifles or do you need to scrap .50 rifles?
---
You get the last ones as random rewards from events / quests. I got my shielded plan from doing the Rose radio quests with my alt.
---
If the game were released as it is, it would be "good but needs work" category. It feels like a fallout game when you play alone. I think people really underestimated how discombobulating it feels to be rushed by other players through content.
---
Your highly unlikely hypothetical scenario has me convinced.
---
I just wish they provided a plan when they provided the gun.  It would cut down on confusion and make players feel a bit less ripped off ("LOL, Lv. 30 gun?  WTF").
---
Thank you! I thought I was going crazy or just couldnt find the quest line to get it.

Reading all the feedback on here. thanks for giving your thoughts on this change! I will convey this back to the team.

Playing on Xbox, mostly solo player, having a great time exploring and collecting stuff. Give it a shot.
---
Pretty sure until you leave.
---
That reminds me of Beta Ray Bill, the alien Thor character from Marvel comics.
---
Also, the CMs have stopped talking to us since repair-kit-gate.
---
The A-holes are a necessary evil.  It makes you appreciate the good people that much more.
---
Is that the one in the ash heap?
---
Recruit help from someone who is higher level.  Being near Whitespring there's almost always going to be higher levels nearby triggering those spawns.  I was lower level when I did that mission also and there just happened to be a level 100+ in there.  If you're PC let me know if you need help, I'm avail today.
---
The military camps in the cranberry bog usually all have at least 6 in the form of ammo bags and military duct tape.
---
I‚Äôm almost 53 and love gaming fallout 76 is my first taste of online gaming,  I don‚Äôt get out much due to a back disability so it‚Äôs nice to connect with people u don‚Äôt feel so alone, maybe it‚Äôs the time of the oldies üòÇ
---
&gt;any chance you're in nuke range?
---
No clue. I've only ever seen nukes hit the south east corner of the map, I didn't know they could drop other places.
---
Military Camps/Bases - look for military duct tape and ammo bags.
---
Camp McClintock is the lowest level place where those reliably spawn.
---
Fallout at it's full potential, people "living" the Wasteland. I love it.
---
How do you activate the excavator missions? Also what level is the excavator power armour?
---
I don't want uncontested workshop ownership.  I want a challenge issued and I choose to defend or relinquish the workshop. 
---
It should work like this:
---
I own a workshop.  Player contests my ownership.  I have choice to accept the challenge (initiate pvp right then when I accept) or I can choose to give ownership to the challenger without starting PvP.  There should be a time limit to the decision.  Maybe 45 seconds to decide and if I accept PvP I'm transported to a random location outside of the workshop far enough away to not be killed on transfer.  Then I'd have a limited amount of time to go into the workshop area to hold ownership until I'm killed or I take out the challengers.
---
The transport would happen away from the challengers and their team that might be in the area.
---
Otherwise, if I choose to give up the workshop or if the challenge times out without a response, or if I accept PvP but I don't go to the workshop to hold it... Either way the ownership reverts to the challenger.
---
Fort defiance has a fair bit if you want lots.  For my needs I just hit sons of dane, there's always two ammo bags in the beer house and a tape too. Just going there once in a while is enough for what I use.  Also I know the thorn has some, as well as that place where you do the obstacle course.
---
Definitely would be p2w and a lot of people wouldn't bother buying in that case.
---
I've found them turning in Technical Data at Camp Venture.  But it's very rare.  Out of maybe 8-10 turn-ins since they became available, I've only acquired one paint (the Knight one).
---
Not really worth it either, IMO.  The change is very subtle.
---
My first interaction with other players in this game was when I joined an event (don't remember which one) with some high-level ppl. I just shot at the enemies (dealing little to no damage) and got hit and critically injured. One of the high-level fellas helped me up and left me some plans and aid. No one had mics, so we just exchanged heart emotes.
---
There should also be a way to "quit" a workshop without having to quit the game.
---
What is there to disagree with? Sounds like you‚Äôre part of the problem LMAO
---
This may seem obvious, but do you sit through Biv's dialogue?
---
Sometimes he has to give me 3 spiels before I get a quest, but I play the drunk advocate and listen to his ramblings anyway.
---
I am still unsure about how the repair kits will be. Bethesda have not really explained the Atom shop kits very well....It is able to be interpreted that these will be a 'plan' that can be unlocked from the atom shop which will therefore not really make it a P2W item.
---
"Basic Repair Kits will be **unlockable** in the Atomic Shop using Atoms you‚Äôve purchased or those you‚Äôve earned for free by completing in-game challenges "
---
Bethseda just  have to give official statement, temp bans are now perma bans, lose customer for all Bethseda products for life.  Plenty of other products out there.
---
This is fucking sick. Thanks for the story man put a smile on my face !! Fallout is the best game series of all time.
---
Patched out.
---
Military camps if you‚Äôre simply searching. If you have a decent amount of caps I would say also hit up various vendors for bulked ballistic fiber. It‚Äôs usually around 299 for 10 ballistic fibers if I recall correctly
---
I played at launch and stopped for a couple months. I just recently got back into it with these new events happening and it's definitely a lot better now than it was before. I can build what I want in my camp without feeling like I don't have enough budget, even camp stash feels good. The game still needs a good amount of quality of life added but it's on the right track, I still have an enjoyable time but I enjoy just looting and building up my camp or workshops.
---
I feel like there's should be a token damage amount so people can play as raiders and it doesn't cost too much to fix. Some dicks came and blew up my rad arches the other day and while I don't mind people trying yo get a bounty, I do when it can cost me so much to replace. Just set a token amount and we're good
---
The golf course is one of the most common nuke sites due to the large number of ghouls
---
I went to fort defiance but I couldn‚Äôt find any weirdly enough. Thanks for the advice though
---
I have. I will try that again today. I have tried talking to him first before looting, making more nukashine while there too.
---
Fort Defiance should be more than enough. There are something like 6-10 there. Make sure to invest in "Scrapper" and "White Knight" if you can spare the points.
---
I‚Äôll drop by there. Thank you for the response
---
if you wanna know some prices from actually traders, i would suggest going to the f76 market reddit. you can do price checks there
---
Really? You think that the fan base wouldn't buy a game with good lore and finally a multiplayer world?  We all knew it was a Shit at launch and we all bought out anyway.
---
Please explain what this problem is. And people can disagree with whatever they want. I have the same issue you do but I don't go and whine on Reddit because that achieves nought
---
Awesome, some of the other areas I can stay alive in, but the lower level areas are safer obviously. Thank you
---
Why is that?

Currently using a two shot laser rifle, short barrel and a square quad splitter thing on the muzzle, it's pretty powerful against certain creatures, but lacks against things like suped up robots and gulpers. The quad muzzle spreads when fired from the hip which helps at close range, but is still as accurate when fired while aiming.
---
Sniper barrel sucked, slow fire with less shots. Not worth it.
---
You're using *Sentinel's* for *melee*. You understand why that's stupid, right? You're literally never going to get a benefit from it unless a melee enemy charges at you.
---
Also on a shotgun reload during combat reload more than one damn bullet.
---
Yeah, most likely a general shotgun bug from the sound of it
---
holy fuck yikes
---
I have a decent amount of caps so if all else fails, I‚Äôll do that instead. Thank you
---
From my understanding, sneak attacks are disabled in pvp, the bonus damage anyway.
---
Read the top comment.
---
No because the good ones go to the top and they put the good ideas in the game.
---
Perhaps, but most ARs in vats laser you as soon as you show up.
---
The stagger is flat, but it doesn‚Äôt happen reliably enough to counter those Weightless sentinel effectively, and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs unbeatable.
---
You only have a chance to beat Weightless sentinel, not a certainty.
---
Handmade
---
Yep we do. But it's not really the same.
---
Let's get it for weapons too.
---
I have both perks, but haven‚Äôt leveled them up so I will definitely do that. Thank you as well
---
you should be able to boil purified water to make boiled purified water and have the outcome of cooking have fewer rads.
---
That‚Äôs what I resorted to one time when all my armor was broke. Be sure to equip white Knight when repairing to lower the required materials
---
I've not hit that yet, but I can foresee that moment relatively soon. I plan on starting to buy plans I haven't got, regardless of whether I want them.
---
Once that is done, I'll start on the serum recipes. 
---
Or maybe the other way round.
---
You are still in the takes a bit of time to level portion of the game. 
---
Dont worry, levels will start coming faster soon.
---
At close to 30 with a good melee weapon, you should be able to do a WS nuke run (or two).  Lots of Xp (and better weapon drops) there.  
---
  If you havent already done it, The mysteries quest will take you enough places with enough critters to gain several levels in the process.
---
Again if you haven't already done so, start the Excavator quest.  
---
It's going to take you some time to collect the materials to build it anyway.  While you are there, go through the residentail towers across the street.
---
Theres a large number of mutants at the Pennetentary, 
---
WV lumber, grafton steel, and grafton dam have lots of mutants.
---
 Last time I was at Red rocket in the North Divide, there were lots of mutants there as well.  
---
Pleasant valley resort has both a large number (and a wide variety) of enemies.
---
  Anything on the western side of the divide may spawn higher level enemies - but go to the middle and east divide, you are guarantees higher enemies (and more XP), but it's easy to get too far over your head rather quickly.
---
Recon compass markers will always disappear when switching to a weapon without a recon sight. Only way to avoid this is to wear PA with the recon sensor mod on the helmet, that way the gun you're using is irrelevant.
---
Good doggy can be pretty decent when you've amassed a ton of dog food, which you can do via equipping Can Do and search trash cans at Whitesprings. You just get a ton of dog food and other canned food items that way.
---
Rejuvenated is probably one of the more worthwhile ones for another 50 hp, and the disease resist is okay.
---
Why on earth are you using Aquaboy and Lead belly though? 
---
Aquaboy/girl is so damn pointless with how damn near absent water is in this game. 
---
Lead belly is beyond pointless with how absurdly abundant radaway is, and it's far too easy to get all the water you could ever need for drinking with just 1-2 water purifiers, so you can completely avoid rads from water.
---
You should just toss Lead Belly entirely and equip Fireproof.
---
I'm kinda getting the impression you haven't progressed past level 25.
---
People complained it was not bright enough... I didn't see a huge issue. Then a patch came to brighten it because of the complaints... Seems they turned it up to a billion lumens with that patch...
---
I've had my build set up that way with Sent/assassin, dodgy, fireproof, dense mod, serendipity, etc. since the second month the game was out. Some people who have built this way, with pvp in mind were unable to fully display it until non restrictive servers were a thing.
---
I wish I thought about this when it happened lol, but everyone on this post has given a lot of good advice so I‚Äôm extremely satisfied with that
---
Hey I bought one because of this post! Thank you for giving me the opportunity to support WV locals :)
---
1-shot would be BE black powder rifle. 1200+ dmg with faster dps than the dragon.
---
BE handmade for full out DPS and AP magazines.
---
Guess you weren't today's winner.
---
My Bloodied explosive Gauss rifle says 1057 on paper before any buffs, and below 20% hp on my build.
---
yea was bugged.. had to log out and back in and that fixed it
---
Damn :/ I‚Äôve finished Roses quest line already without getting it. 
---
Will farm Uranium Fever some more then :) thanks :)
---
I think her quest is to secure the silos for vault tec
---
Just go to the trading discord and you can spend them in a few transactions...
---
Retirement goals. :)
---
If we could make them with no restrictions, then it'd be better. I still wouldn't be 100% happy, but it would be an improvement from the current planned implementation.
---
No kidding. Ridiculous! I thought this plushie was adorable personally
---
I‚Äôm cool with Bethesda charging real money for cosmetics. That‚Äôs what they said the shop would be for.
---
This game doesn‚Äôt have good lore though it has holotapes that at release didntnolay while you wore PA and make it impossible to hear lore and your team mates at the same time.  I sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt have paid $60 on a preorder knowing they were going to go pay-to-win less than half a year later after releasing the buggy mess we‚Äôve already paid for and had to live with. I‚Äôm already never preordering a Bethesda game again, they can very easily make it so I never buy a new Bethesda game again as well ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I agree they need to be significantly different colours (IE Blue/Green), but you should probably get checked for your colour sensitivity. They are different shades of yellow
---
Can just confirm since I'm ~34(was Friday) I'm melee all in withespring after the weekend I'm now 65(Sunday I did 15 lvls or so, just crazy), westtek and her mutants is good but not with 30 xD I did also the uranium fever when it's was there a vampire weapon helps a lot. Now I have a 2h with 40%ss and under 40%health 50%more dmg that kills all self a glowing deathclaw lvl 91 was death with 4 heavy hits or so (not the sbq =D)
---
I mostly just reload whitespring to save some caps  and carry weight was also a problem. But the vendors are Near so perfect spot.
---
Thanks, where abouts do I start the excavator quest?
---
When wearing the arms you should receive double the ore output whenever you find nodes you can interact with in the world.
---
It‚Äôs easier later. I felt like I was drinking constantly lv 20-50. If you‚Äôre on XB I can give you a bunch of purified water. Welcome to the wastes.
---
For my build it‚Äôs an explosive lever. I think it‚Äôs doing 650-700 dps. It‚Äôs currently my favorite gun and my bloodied death claw (I know you said not melee) that‚Äôs doing about 1500.
---
I joined the 25K club over the weekend.  Kind of feels weird.  I've thought about buying the Marsupial recipe too, but at the same time, the SBQ does have a chance to drop these plans, and I'm skeptical about being able to collect caps quickly in the future.  A lot of this came from the since-nerfed Civil War Top Hats.  I don't really *struggle* to sell 1400 caps a day without them, but it takes a lot more time to do so.
---
I guess making the serums would pay for themselves after about 40.
---
Did you double check the receivers, I know the fixer comes with the calibrated(?) as standard...
---
I got a furious deathclaw guantlet with 40% swing speed and 90% less weight and then a 2 shot lvl 45 handmade from whitesprings right after. The Todd was with me last friday.
---
People are complaining that you have to enter the Inspect screen to repair now. You REALLY can't see people complaining if they have to leave the workbench to use a repair kit?
---
Even the plan would be good, I‚Äôm level 180 and played since launch. Really don‚Äôt know how I haven‚Äôt got them yet. I‚Äôve had many marine mods and pretty sure I can do the dense mod myself, and ultralight. I can also bos mod all combat armour I thought I should be able to do ultra light. And I‚Äôve built and scrapped many armour pieces.
---
unlikely is still possible. It was unlikely that the PC BETA would delete itself on the first day of the BETA, but it happened right?
---
I think he means just how all the teammate map markers are yellow it can get confusing, so having different teammate colors instead of yellow
---
I think this is a bug? Some finished it by finding the last holotape at the Mountain House thing. I found that holotape before i found every other holotape, maybe thats why it never got triggered?
---
Yeah, my build requires moderately high INT just to power the perk cards I need. If they buffed what INT does for you, I'd enjoy it. But the 5 stacks of gun nut and 3 stacks of demolitionist are what's keeping my points in INT.
---
Are you on PC/PS4? Legitimately wondering, because I‚Äôm not seeing disconnects more than once per day on XB.
---
"I haven't played since "x" amount of time. Is it worth getting back into?" As if an entire subreddit dedicated to a game will tell them it's not worth playing.
---
I think it's open ended and we haven't heard the last of her.
---
Sometimes yeah but since Bethesda is reading theses post its kind worth it lol
---
No, because these people care about this game and many have valid points.
---
When the resonance is big enough, maybe things get changed.
---
They are. Weekly in survival mode you can do the challenge to earn yourself anew weapon. What they do need to do next is up the Stash Limit so people who collect unique items like me have room to stash them all. For now I‚Äôm just stripping the weapons and armors of all their parts so they weight less in storage.
---
The issue is less the advantage and more the fact that you can pay for an advantage of any kind, as Bethesda promised no non-cosmetics. So yes, I would be.
---
Only way i have managed to get an indoor farm is to create a foundation set 3 x 3, then put doors all around it, remove the central piece of foundation and one edge piece of foundation, turn all the doors into walls and then put 1/2 wall under the now-floating wall. this will give you a 2 x 1 piece of ground.
---
In no less than 2 other comments, he has stated that they are exactly the same color, and down-voted and rebuked anyone stating otherwise.  Either he isn't accurately communicating his issue, or there is some other issue which is preventing him from seeing the difference in color.
---
You can make 25/35/45 versions of it. I just kept my level 25 until I could make the 45 version.
---
Good to know. Thanks for the explanation.
---
I thought you could play holo games on the terminals you can build. Can you not just sit it on a desk next to a chair?
---
This guy got downvoted for having the correct answer. Just store your junk and dont loot the bodies until it's done, and there's nothing to worry about.
---
Oh good call. Thank you for the heads up! What a nasty person.
---
I think you again are mad about the addition of the kits, not the kits themselves.  Why are you still playing and posting?
---
One of the report options is ‚ÄúBethesda plz‚Äù.  If enough people report a post it should get removed
---
But plans turd
---
&gt; usually a 4 letter word begining with f.
---
Funk? We got the funk.
---
So true. Gotta have a bit of variety haha.
---
The default Fixer receiver only buffs crit damage.
---
I'm certain that's the player vending. I'll bet you 1000 atoms (this is an honest, friendly offer).
---
But all the other stats have great perk cards AND passive effects. Per/Int builds are getting the shaft just a bit compared to others. Especially considering that the builds perception and intellect are generally built around, rifles and laser weapons, are also gimped in other ways, such as no weight reduction for rifles (25lb gauss, anyone?) and lasers just being generally sucky altogether.
---
Congrats! My wife launched her first nuke on her birthday and then the SBQ overloaded the server and kicked us both out, but I think we should all be congratulated for a job well done perpetuating the endless cycle of violence.
---
we crawl out of a vault into a pockmarked hell of murderous robots and new-age crystal zombies and our reaction is 'heyyyy I know what this place needs is MOAR NOOK'
---
What makes you think webbkyle is bloodied? I'm not saying it's not the case, but I don't see anything in the post to indicate that.
---
Remember that only 100% fact on that is that i got mine from those rose quests. Other info is just someone else claiming something that i can't verify.
---
It has It's problems but I fucking love it
---
My GT: Tops Bloobie. I‚Äôm always on and down to play so just HMU :)
---
my base is at the top left of that hill  when they show him rolling in to morgantown
---
Most of them don't play, and just like to rag on the game for jollies.
---
Well, those are perks. All stats have good perk cards. His point is the passives for INT and PER aren't up to par with the other stats' passives.
---
It escalates the more Artillery pieces you have
---
Go build 4 Artillery pieces. Do it. Trust me on this one.
---
Head over to /r/Market76
---
You'll have much better luck
---
I play with a couple of people who are retired, met them in game and joined their discord, absolute top lads to play with and really nice guys in general
---
Ok, fine, it's a woman.  She's probably not color-blind.  She just needs a better monitor.  Forgive me for not going through her damned post history.
---
Yea I don‚Äôt think it will ever stop tbh. I had a problem with super mutants at my camp when it was in a close position to your camp. I moved it slightly down the hill to the right, plus there is a copper deposit right there so I have a life time supply of ore to convert and sell/trade so that kind of sealed the deal for me at least.
---
Yea, the other end is near watoga as well. Its the cave where the firebreathers mission takes place.
---
The handmade seems to most powerful according to everyone. Why?
---
Ok, I just interpreted what he said in the title as what I said. But that makes more sense
---
It's still West Virginia. What were you expecting? Texas? Philidelphia? South Carolina?
---
I am a gay Muslim man that‚Äôs likes monies and Donald Trump but really disliked Gossip Girl.
---
Let‚Äôs play together, my GT is ‚ÄúGayMuslimTrumpyLuvr87‚Äù
---
This is a symptom, but the problem is that this game is still lacking a LOT of basic things that any other online game would have.
---
Hey, I get it. Trust me, I live in a poor area up north. It's funny how the people with the least, are the most generous in sharing. My family down there makes food to share with everyone near them. I actually really learned what generosity was when I first when down there. Were it not for the anti LGBT attitude, I'd consider moving there when I retire. 
---
Plus, it's kind of hilarious when you get to the towns they live in and you see your family's name plastered on everything. ^.^ 
---
Thanks for your work down there, I know all my family and the people there appreciate the medical help. We've buried a lot of family from black lung.
---
This game really does capture that old school MMO feeling where it wasn't always just about a loot treadmill and endgame it was about your experiences, the journey, the people you meet, building bonds and friendships, and learning through others.               
---
This game allows for the most unique experience I have had in a game in a long time. It's something that has been lost in the spirit of modern games. I love seeing stories like this because these are the kinds of things that are the exact reasons I love this game. Thank you for sharing. Stay safe in the wasteland my friend.
---
Are there any specific third star requirements for a 3* BE handmade? Also, do you have a link to a build to use with a BE handmade?
---
i could kill the mutants easily and other enemies. i just dont wanna waste my resources on these robots that are suppose to be neutral to me.
---
Just head into the basement where Biv is located and talk to him. You‚Äôll get a daily quest to find recipes to make more alcohol.
---
It‚Äôs cool
---
This, it sucks
---
I have scorched taking pot shots at my walls all day from a hundred yards away. It‚Äôs annoying because their too far away to find in VATs so I carry a recon sniper when I go to my base and snuff them out real fast before they start blowing down walls.
---
Yup yup :) won‚Äôt hold you responsible for whatever time I spend not getting it :) that‚Äôs on me ;)
---
Thanks :)
---
Hell yeah! That's how us new age responders handle things out in the waste! Thanks man and congrats to you guys as well
---
Maybe don't rush the vendor, but let us convert  legendaries into tokens in preparation.  
---
Hopefully the tokens have little to no weight.  
---
I'd love to convert all my hoarded goods into tokens and just have a stack of 1star, 2star, 3star tokens ready to use at the vendor on release day.
---
My family is near Garrett down there. I haven't been down to see them in awhile, but I really miss the hospitality down there.
---
You‚Äôd be glad to have a xenophobic racist? Disgusting
---
I just now buy it when I can. I've got to do something with all these caps asince I'm always hitting the 25k cap limit
---
Why would you go into that event with anything droppable on you?
---
That‚Äôs a great Legendary. It‚Äôs light enough to keep as a back-up and Vampires is very useful if your low on health and backed into a corner. You should look for the Sacrificial Blade mod for your new machete. It will add another star and Poison damage.
---
That sounds really great. What kind of third star should i go for with a 3* BE lever?
---
Highest base damage
---
If you run nerdrage you **need** a bloodied sniper rifle. You'll be ending everything in 1 shot.
---
Happened to me too. Finally killed a hulking megasloth before the bears did and I was able to loot it. No credit. It was with a tesla rifle so I thought maybe the tesla arc didn't count.
---
I've also seen it as a rare spawn at Creekside sundew grove, pretty much in view from the fast travel point looking at the grove. But tried that for a while yesterday and no luck.
---
Maybe this will be the lucky one. Best of luck to you and thanks alot!
---
It‚Äôs not whining, it‚Äôs amazement that i even have to have this conversation lol
---
Do you have any 5.56 for sell?
---
I can‚Äôt believe these cunts removed it again. I mean just grow up
---
Remember though, that after the announcement more players would be looking for any legendary weapons so if they didn't nerf it a little then no one would have a chance to pick up any or be able to have a normal encounter in any area where a legendary might usually spawn simply because farmers would be server hopping to clean them out.
---
I of course would love to encounter more legendary weapons but would it be fair to newer players entering an area for the first time only to find everything has been killed every time they come there? 
---
If there are areas that can be constantly farmed then the best equipped high level farmers will only end up being able to gain more and more equipment and leave others who can't keep up with the farmers lagging behind.
---
It might be just as well to have it a little nerfed until the vendor comes in and we see how things go from there. They may yet make more changes to legendary enemies after the vendor comes in.
---
That is great. Do you have a link to a build that i should use with the handmade? Also, what second and third stars for a 3* handmade?
---
repair-kit-gate..... hehehehe
---
PC! The last time I played a couple days ago I got disconnected twice in a 2 hour play time. I was just capturing workshops and it crashed. I feel like the two are related. 
---
I‚Äôve seen huge variations though. My brother sometimes can barely get his game to load. One of our friends couldn‚Äôt get in game at all the last time we tried playing. 
---
One time we had some sort of domino effect where our friend‚Äôs game shit the bed, then my brothers game kept crashing to desktop, and mine froze and I had to restart my computer. We ended up switching to AoE2 after that...
---
We all have great computers and good connections too so it‚Äôs really strange.
---
Go to garrahan mining hq in ash heap.  You'll see a poster advertising excavator armor, activate it.
---
Thanks for the laugh.
---
I can't think of a single gaming subreddit other than this one that has so many positive and inspiring posts like this.
---
Yeah, me too. I've been too way too many funerals for family members who died of black lung, or lung cancer. 
---
Up here, we have the auto industry which is dying out. People are hurting everywhere, and I wish the corrupt politicians in both our areas would do something to actually help the working poor.
---
540 of them
---
Never heard of that happening.  I don't play on PC.
---
Okay, thanksüëç
---
I have a 63, a 32 and a 25 I think? Still haven't seen probably half the map. Haven't finished the story. Haven't even gotten the vast majority of plans. Love survival and adventure. This is my main game nowadays. Got a nice small group of friends to play with too so I always have someone to roll with. Am absolutely fine roaming alone too.
---
Yea I have to hit interact on him like 5 times before he tells me something useful or gives me a quest! It‚Äôs actually kind of annoying.
---
I've been to way too many funerals for family members who died of black lung, or lung cancers. It's awful. :(
---
You can report them as Bethesda Plz posts, but it doesn‚Äôt change anything. The mods here aren‚Äôt very good.
---
Do you want it close enough to put industrial purifiers in the water, or just close enough to do water runs and not have to use a pump to get dirty water? 
---
Near top of the world, just south of the train station, there's a junk node. Just barely further south still is a great pond with all sorts of plants around it. The pond is definitely within quick walking distance, but not close enough to build in the pond and get that junk node. 
---
I love this spot, and will be moving there soon once my acid stores are up from the spot I'm at now. Being really close to the train station helps my keep my stash weights down and my caps up.
---
What's this problem I'm apart of? Please explain
---
I can do dense combat on at least one of my chars but I can't remember for the life of me how they learned it. Same with all the BOS mods.
---
This guy is missing the whole point of posting bugs. To get them fixed. Blocked ü§£
---
Seems like PC really got the short end on 76.
---
Yeah, in the past few months I‚Äôve only got one or two decent legendaries. Almost all my equipment comes from further back. I was wondering if it was just bad luck, but it seems like it really was a nerf. 
---
Given this nerf, I half expect the legendary vendor to only take atoms as currency, in a similar fashion to the repair perk nerf being followed by repair kits. If that were to happen, as much as I currently enjoy the game, I think I‚Äôd have to make myself stop playing.
---
I'm only on xbox but I appreciate the hand my man. But yeah it was very nerve racking there were about 3 separate accounts where I was thinking "Okay I'm about to die, I'll come back with someone to help." Lol
---
The problem is this is where they get feedback. If you post a request or idea to them directly, you get nothing. It is firing in to a void.
---
If you post here, one of their PR people may at least acknowledge it has been seen. So everyone comes here.
---
What is the planned implementation?
---
There's a chance someone was just there before you.  It's all in the upper floors as well, none on first floor.
---
Not when I really wanted to know, but thanks for your valuable input.
---
Just met an older gentlemen and women yesterday while playing survival. We took the Munitions factory and most of the workshops on the northern edge of the map. Had a blast! They even helped me get the Sole Survivor.
---
Where‚Äôs the mountain house
---
My camp has never been attacked. Not once, ever. Where are you putting your camp dude?
---
alright, I'll let you know next time I'm on.
---
I‚Äôll give him a few minutes this round of trying.
---
‚ÄúAll the fallout game‚Äù I about lost it. Idk why that was funny.
---
If you haven't picked it up, now is a good time. Most of the most egregious bugs have been fixed, and we're finally getting our first dungeon - The Burrows, tomorrow. The Purveyor will be out in a few weeks as well, which will mean that we have a better way to grind end game items, and more control over what we get.
---
My advice is to just play it, preferably solo. Go through the main story quests and do all the side quests, discover all the locations, listen to all the holotapes, etc.
---
76 is wonderfully depressing. I know that sounds weird, but I really enjoyed my time being immersed in this broken world.
---
My first thought too hahaha
---
I don‚Äôt have a link but you can use a website were you can make your build. The second and third stars can be 4 or 5 different perks from a table.
---
Man idk what mine is off the top of my head! I‚Äôll look as soon as I get home and report back!
---
This
---
Assembly code rather than some lazy ass high level BS.
---
Yeah, we had a paper mill up here that closed and the immediate area where it was has never recovered. The auto industry is shuttering a lot of places, and everyone who worked there, and counted on the jobs, or ran businesses near plants, are out of work. 
---
But our political class here would rather bitch about any/everything instead of helping the communities attract new businesses, and help us out.
---
First question what is low lvl for u? Lvl 10?lvl30?when u lvl30 u Hope for high enemy's(With PA+a superhammer easy times there self with lvl 62 ghouls self the wendigo is a joke) if u get with 30low lvl enemy's it's waste of time. I started with 30, 3 or 4 days ago now I'm 65.
---
I don‚Äôt know much about KY politics, but I know the problem in WV is everything is regulated at the state level and everyone in state politics in WV has big ties to a coal head, so the problems just perpetuate. Nothing will be fixed until either powers are redistributed to the regional or county level, or people finally elect people with their interests rather than the biggest names.
---
He posted this response before mine, chill.
---
Cool. And no payment required btw. Just here to help my fellow wastlanders.
---
This guy wasn't full of juice.
---
I see raider linings at vendors quite a bit
---
I thought they patched that bug. I had a neutral scorched beasts attacking my generators over and over and after the latest patch it has stopped.
---
i understand what your saying but the change was night a day after the update, i farm daily  
---
the day before the update it was normal and the day after it was very different
---
I got online for the first time since the latest update last night and I don't even want to admit how long it took me to repair items üòÇ
---
Bethseda needs to give an official response.  But not surprised with their poor planning, design and customer service.  They are turning a AAA title into a crap fest.
---
I dont actively hunt legendarys,but if ones path crosses, ok. But,its now at the stage of,
---
"is it worth it". I got 3 \* 3star the other day - all  1 star junk. ammo,weapon , health.....
---
would have been better to have dis-engaged and ran away.the cave crickets took some beating.
---
best legendary drop me me to date (at level 90).........a level 25 1\*handmade 100% vats accurate if NOT in combat and half your AP.......from a bloatfly.garbage.
---
I can see why you would want to manage your time for video games with something you can truly enjoy. There is a grind to 76 moreso than any prior Fallout game, but it is also the first game of its kind to be even half this successful. So bugs are going to happen. That isn't to say they aren't damn annoying though. Current new bug with crafting stations really sucks.
---
How much do you want for them?
---
Could be, could be something on our end, or something in between. 
---
I know of plenty of PC players who have never experienced any of this. I‚Äôd assume my experiences are on the more extreme end.
---
I asked the same thing, and was told, if you don't follow it in exact order it bugs out and never completes.
---
Should be 17 holotapes, and several notes.
---
the basic repair kits are exclusive to the Atom Shop. the improved CAN be earned in-game... by killing the two enemies in the game that will break a ton of your gear while you hope the server doesn't disconnect for once.
---
I recomend a sneak crit build

My main is a Bloodied combat rifle. So far its the best ive found. Most things are 1 shot kills, and if not, its got a fast fire rate. Still looking for the bloodied lever action though. 
---
I dont actually use the dragon, just wanted to try it out on some SB‚Äôs. I recently found a 3* Bloodied Gauss rifle, but RNGesus made it a level 35 only....of course.
---
You are misinformed.  I regularly get my 3.75x sneak damage in Survival.
---
It doesn't suck because it doesn't look like Mothman from FO76, it sucks because whoever made this sucks at making plushies. This looks atrocious.
---
guessing its for the sb only. but like i said. something wrong with the whitespring robots
---
Everything is negotiable... but 540 rounds of 5.56 I would say 500caps
---
I'm with you on this. I take a quick stop off at any location that has the closest Stash box, store my junk. Then I head to the event. Saw poachers do this the first day and was like NOPE!?!?!?! F\* THAT!
---
Everyone thinks decorating ‚Äòfrom stash‚Äô is going to be allowing you to sit teddy bears Nuka cola bottles down anywhere. Hate to burst bubbles but it‚Äôs going to be a bobblehead stand and those lazy mounted gun display racks, that never center guns, from fallout 4. They are not going to put a CAMP model of two hundred different items in so you can place a plunger next to your toilet
---
The Burning Mine &amp; Gauley Mine are both good (especially for coal). Wear an Excavator Power Armor and you can increase your yield.
---
Anyone else want the Assault Rifle to be good?
---
A lot of the guns are trash or super op. The balance and the bugs need to be the forefront before they focus on camp items or tiny UI tweaks.
---
QOL for pacifist players is not the priority.
---
Ill bet around 80 copper scrap by hitting 2 sets of veins that I know of, one right next to the whitesprings train station (it‚Äôs on the rocks leading up to blackwater mine), and another that‚Äôs leading up to the dog that‚Äôs next to the two dead lovers Easter egg. Make sure to have excavator armor so you can pick up around 12 per vein!
---
There are 4 different ones. First two can be bought from vendors, last two not.
---
But can you imagine if it was shit *and* pay to win? It might have been the straw that broke this thing.
---
thats the one....................................................maybe
---
Was probably me and no im not old and didn't go to Vietnam but i did save 15% by calling gieco.
---
"Is it worth getting into this game that costs nothing to get into?" lol
---
Forgot I had anything and got excited when the event popped up on the server I have done several Sheepsquatch events and never had my bag stolen.
---
yeah its very distracting, this bug came from the most recent patch
---
I do happen to be a bloodied build but never tried psychopath but I don‚Äôt think it has any benefit over 4LC. I think it actually puts you at a disadvantage because you have to kill them to get the chance, whereas 4LC is based on each hit. Idk I like it but if you use both I‚Äôve read people having multiple crits in a row but I like my dmg modifiers
---
Trying to repair the KidSecure ID and I have all of the materials, but I'm [getting an error telling me that I don't have all of the materials.](https://i.imgur.com/XVdt0zj.jpg)
---
F
---
Left side has fiber, right side has jackets (sell) and exp. Elevator leads to some bunk rooms that have fiber too.
---
I have a sniper. I also found a 3 star instigating Dragon with weight reduction. ( I forget other star, bashing I think.)
---
This is the perfect opening act. I have it assigned to a key, and my furious VATSlever gun is the main sniper. When I know I will need more damage, I open with the Dragon, then fast switch to the lever to finish it off, if it even needs it.   
---
Vanish, reload dragon while I run get a snack, then choose next target.
---
&gt; 3* Bloodied Gauss rifle, but RNGesus made it a level 35 only....of course.
---
Oof. I like the lever action but for a crit build I'd prefer the hunting rifle. To be fair something like the lever action would be better for building up crit shots, then switch to hunting rifle for that crit. At least for fights like SBQ and sheepsquatch. I wonder when the community will start calling sheepsquatch SS.
---
Don't reload. Switch to another weapon, reload when its over.
---
And that tells us very little about how they will work or be implemented. For all we know it will be a plan that we make repair kits from or it could be a one time use item bought from the atomic shop. All we really have is conjecture from players  and whiny youtubers.
---
I've managed to get a suppressors supersledge now, but I hadn't planned for it when I made the character. Now if only I could finish final warnings...
---
Not a fan of bloodied. I‚Äôm not that  attentive in watching my health get low before I kill.
---
I am stashing the assassins gear when found in case I ever pvp
---
I want to try bloodied. at what health % does the max damage kick in?
---
That was quick.
---
Working as intended in-game after only 30 minutes of this post.
---
m8 why are you so angry about this? you start swearing right away, its a video game, relax
---
Yeh just when we didn't need it.
---
wot e said
---
It would be very helpful if someone who has parsed through games code could chime in to let us know the statistical differences. 
---
In game my Ultracite Laser Gun does less base damage than my regular Laser Gun. Some people say the Ultracite has a faster fire rate. I‚Äôve also heard Ultracite Weapons give bonus damage to all Scorched, but I‚Äôve not been shown any proof. 
---
Just so anyone reading this knows.. Ultracite weapons and regular weapons with a Prime Receiver attached (converted to Ultracite ammo) are two different things.
---
Not much to go on and might be mis-interpretation but if he were bloodied, then a better card would be Serendipity for the low health boost. The OP already states that Starched Genes, Class freak and Better criticals are already equipped.
---
Bloody mess is the other good card to have.
---
I have been using the following for a while and where I found 4LC to be better than Psychopath
---
2\* Starched Genes
---
3\* Class Freak
---
3\* Better Criticals
---
3\* Bloody Mess
---
3\* Critical Savy
---
1\* four leaf clover
---
Obviously I‚Äôm mad at the inclusion of pay-to-win mechanics such as the previewed lunchboxes, repair kits, and unstoppables health bonus for buying outfits I never said the kit itself was the problem it‚Äôs how they are selling the kit not making it purely an in game drop item.  Do you also think they should make being able to craft serums or add a special +5 strength and endurance atom shop underarmor lining as an atom shop purchase?   I still play because I have friends playing this game, luckily about half have transitioned to also playing sea of thieves where the devs actually communicate and listen to their fans, and I doubt after the next few months with all the new games coming there will be many left in this if Bethesda keeps ignoring theirs and just nerfing crap acting like that‚Äôll fix their game.
---
I play because it clears my mind from a day of work / life. The game isn't complicated, fairly repetitive and every now and then you get a good drop and your like, "Yay, I got a good drop.". If everyone is honest even "hard" events aren't really hard after you do them once or twice and notice the pattern. So it allows you to turn off your mind for a little while.
---
Sure the server disconnects which lead to a few minute roll backs, Bethesda's questionable re-balancing changes, and new bugs / old bugs added back in are frustrating, but in the end I laugh at the insanity of it and mindlessly go back to killing mutants and trying to get rare underarmor and plan drops.
---
I‚Äôll be honest, whatever the game decides to gift me, im gonna try out. I dont use the markets, so its all rng for me. That might change with the player/legendary vendor though.
---
I mean... no. There are thousands of people who come here every day, what do you expect? :-p  Of course a portion of those people are going to want to make requests, and frankly that's part of the purpose of the forum. The popular requests float to the top... and there it is.
---
Everyone wants to voice some thoughts now and then so there's no fair way to control this short of completely shutting down all requests. And that would be stupid. 
---
Not meant in a mean way but this type of post is more of a problem than that type of post, because this one serves no function but complaining into a void. xD
---
Here here!! This post is exactly right on.
---
I offered up an easy way around that in my last comment. Did you read it? You honestly seem like you have a reading comprehension problem man. I'm not even trying to insult you by saying that. It's like you're ignoring 50% of what I say. Ill break it down, and then for real if you don't get it, I'm done with you.
---
Enter work bench by hitting triangle for repair. Select your weapon to repair and hit X. the screen pops up and says Material Cost 3 steel, 3 aluminum, 5 ballistic fibre. X for accept, Square for repair kit, O for cancel.
---
On playstation it was square to open the transfer menu, and X to take items out. Now it's X to open. I guess they thought since people kept taking the first item out they thought that people would still keep pressing X. Now it's different and we all finally started using the right button üòÇ
---
It runs from the 9th to the 15th. I haven't finished it yet, either.
---
Trying to decide if I want to give up the 15 lbs of stash space for an assassins lever action.
---
And "That" gun while you are adding weapons too please Bethesda!
---
Meh too late. It‚Äôs HEAVY AF to carry or store.
---
See, and A LOT of Fallout fans didn't want online multi-player. This is what it's all about. I remember waiting for Fallout 4 to come out and mentioning multi-player. I'm surprised someone didn't hunt me down and slit my throat.
---
Probably. Also, they changed most containers to only load when you are viewing, before any available containers would load their contents for each character in the area and that was causing huge lag spikes, especially during fights like SBQ.
---
Ooh nice, Thank you!
---
O searched till I found a legendary witht he 90% weight reduction. Totally worth it.
---
You're thinking Scorched Killer or maybe Prime (Prime increases damage to everything and does bonus damage against scorched &amp; scorchbeasts), not Ultracite. Ultracite Lasers are not just a normal laser with a specific mod, they're a completely separate weapon. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if if the ultracite laser does more damage to scorched and scorchbeasts, because its listed damage at level 50 is lower than the listed damage of a normal laser rifle at level 45.
---
Hmm, it's difficult for me to use a build planner. I had rather have a completely created build like the one from the below comment. I don't know what kind of legendary weapon traits i'd put on the handmade. Most people go for explosive. Still in doubt about the third start though.
---
Yes! Saw it in the beta and have never seen it again.
---
Ah, Thank you!
---
I found a 1* instigating dragon (+50% initial dmg), and a 1* executioner dragon (+50% dmg when tgt under 40% health).
---
They're a great combo
---
It doesn't help when you're one of the conduits and no one is healing you when you down so all of the people just keep shooting at the sheepsquatch while it's invulnerable...
---
Lumping all requests together in one thread would be terrible. It would turn into an absolute mess when people start to debate or converse about certain points related to individual requests... this is why every request needs its own thread so it can be discussed by the community in a coherent manner.
---
Also, Reddit is a place for discussion and that's what requests often involve. Discussion and disagreement and consensus. So it's silly to suggest that request posts shouldn't be on this forum.
---
yeah its really really bad since the last patch, very disappointing
---
but at least the ATOM store works amiright?
---
what.
---
I think you're over reacting. They have definitely gone back to a "hold stuff back until it's done mindset" as we saw with the delay in player vending. The repair screen is most likely built to accommodate the repair kits, and I think the blank screen is probably because the code is trying to load a repair kit option that doesn't exist in game yet. In the grand scheme of things, the game is getting better with every patch. They are overall doing a great job.
---
go above the big bend tunnel (wotoga side),almost to the top,you'll find a pool.Loads of copper ore and some lead.not saying where the iron is cause that MINE.....paws off.
---
I often see him around Charleston station... there‚Äôs also a mr handy that has some cats following him!
---
true but they could easily solve the whole thing by saying "no this is how it works"... but they haven't. They haven't denied it at all.
---
Bug or unstable servers, I don't know.
---
I don't see why it would become bugged if they haven't changed anything to do with cap stashes.
---
This is the best comment I've seen all month, take my upvote
---
Sorry for slow reply it‚Äôs pc.
---
Just woke up if you are around still
---
I get irradiated down to 20% health and use level 3 Serendipity perk and some other Dr/Er perks, and a few pieces of unyielding armor ive found. I very rarely die in adventure mode,(except against the SS imposter), and even in survival i dodge most of the incoming damage. Im about a 3:1 kill death ratio in survival. 
---
I don‚Äôt particularly like the build better than some others, but these are the items ive got. If I find some good AA or TSE weapons, i will most definitely try those builds out as well.
---
Because lumping all requests into one thread would be an absolute disaster. Each topic needs its own thread so we can have coherent discussion, not chaos.
---
Gotta think it through, man. :-p
---
It‚Äôs possible. I have a Bloodied 25% Faster Fire Rate 15% reload speed Gatling Gun. I don‚Äôt think the 15% reload speed increase does anything if you already have Speed Demon FYI. At least the faster reload is barely noticeable if you already have Speed Demon.
---
amazing this really shows that this game isnt the shit show that people make it out to be
---
Aye it is. Surprised the cost hasn‚Äôt been balanced yet.
---
Yeah im getting tired of the same bs, the sent and ass should have diminishing returns, yesterday fought whit a guy who was completly invisible so I couldnt crit him, later he was jumping in place (i dont how that work) BE Gauss didndt do nothing, gamma didnt work, and tesla whit tank killer finally could take some hp, but as soon it get close to 0 it fully healed in less that a second 3 times in a row, I dont know how is that even posible.
---
No even using smart scope agains inv, tank killer perk sent, radiation damage, and event crits and tankiller dont work, its ridiculous.
---
&gt; starting not to be fun anymore 
---
This is a problem for me that has grown steadily worse over time. The constant nerfs are certainly part of it. 
---
But the frustration for me really culminated in this latest event with the latest patch   
---
There is just something about this event that is really off putting to me.  
---
Part of the problem is that it's presented as the final quest for this latest download, but when you get there, you can't start it and to find out why, I had to go on reddit
---
But I finally got the quest and successfully completed it and felt very underwhelmed by it.
---
Red, blue, or purple lamps help this a lot.
---
I keep seeing some that are things that people posted back at launch, like some almost word for word reposts lol
---
tank killer, rifleman, glow sight are goid ones for the handmade, i have couple of different handmades including a TSE, Assasian's, and piercing
---
thats a good fast-switch set.
---
They are already looted by someone else?
---
I NEED IT
---
I play exclusively on PC, so your PS4 controls just look like letters to me.
---
You have to examine a poster for Excavator suits.
---
Go to the mining HQ building in Charleston.   I think there are posters there, but its been a while and I dont remember.  (In any case, clear the building for some things you will need later, XP, and another side mission).  If you didnt get the excavator mission here, don't worry, for travel time efficiency
---
Leave there, go WNW to a nearby mansion with the big lions out front.
---
Mysteries quest line starts there.
---
  From the mansion, go to the southern side of the ashheap and examine the sandwich board posters in the parking lot of the mining building.  You should get the excavator quest when you do.  Then go across the street and clear the towers.
---
You should be a few levels higher by the time you get to the top of the tower, and the quests you've picked up in te process will bring the next set of levels very soon
---
Noticed this while back and I thought it was because the Black powder weapons actually reload within the first few seconds of the animation, and by switching back and forth you are just cancelling the animation.
---
But its a bug... makes me sad it'll probably get fixed but otherwise good to know. Take my upvote!
---
Check my post time, asshole
---
I mean, if you back out to the item list it will show you the condition bar. Then you can still tell which items to repair. The lack of stats on the repair menu is really just a QOL thing.
---
Not sure where that Easter egg is but Google is thing.
---
Thanks! :D
---
I will confirm the BE blackpowder is very powerful, but the BE flechete harpoon is way better. It beats it in all aspects.
---
A gun I would say is the most powerful is the BE gatling gun with most damage perks. It saves on ammo, unyielding armor allows high amounts of vats use, and the right perks can allow 500 damage to go to 829 per hit. You can kill everything with this beast.
---
Bought one from the bot at the rail station at watoga.
---
Yeah I saw it in the BETA.... and then I killed them all.
---
Two patches ago they also nerfed the frequency of Legendary creatures spawning in watoga civic and EMS.  They also reduced the frequency into the ground of a legendary spawning during Bots on Parade event.  I used to run it all the time because it was nearly a guaranteed legendary at the end.  now I've seen about two legendaries spawn in over 20 attempts. It makes me think like "oh guess we'll lose AWOL and violent night legendaries next".  I'm going with the idea that they're trying to smooth out what activities people do so that you're not relegated to just running those legendary spawns. Instead rerouting those to events, new events like encryptid.  Which I'd be okay with except: SHIT LOOT.  I'm MORE okay with the amount of crap drops when we can get drops more often.  It just feels like less and less chances to roll the dice with each patch. I hope they figure this out soon, because at this point we need treasure goblins.
---
I did the same thinking I‚Äôd get the mask. Nope!
---
Try the Sarsparilla star caps quest in New Vegas. You will be overwhelmed by the prize.
---
I am with you. I believe their internal roadmap for profit is to throttle in game legendary enemies in favor of selling legendary tokens in the Atomic Shop. I hope I am wrong, but they increased weapons and armor degradation before they announced repair kits, increased spoilage rates and have announced refrigeration (implied in the Atomic Shop). It doesn‚Äôt seem too far fetched legendary throttling is to sell legendary tokens for money. Again, I hope I am wrong.
---
Too much L√§mp
---
You can‚Äôt but them on, you have a to find them of a legendary enemy
---
silver shroud with wrap around goggles
---
I always farmed Legendaries to sell.  I mean, 95% of them are worthless vendor trash.
---
Then, right after the vendor patch, suddenly there are no more Legendaries to farm.  I have ran Watoga probably 50 times since and haven't seen a single Legendary.  I would think this was just affecting me, but when I check the map there is nobody in Watoga anymore so i think everybody gave up there.
---
It *night* be coincidence, but I'd wager it's a stealth nerf they don't want to talk about.
---
You can keep the iron. I need copper for my energy weapons :D
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
Lol. I just replied here, called her SS Imposter, a little bit more subtle. Lets see if it catches on!
---
Yea I‚Äôve seen him twice! I took a picture both times. I‚Äôve also had the mr handy with the pack of wild mongrels and he gets upset when you kill them.
---
There's a stash in the bunker right next to the power armor stations.
---
think i prefer the regular laser
---
Lol that‚Äôs my spot! But on the pond and not next to the node.
---
Right! We need jobs for those people....! And me! I live in Htown and drive an hour away to make a decent wage.... but I love living in WV! I love the people, I love the mountains, and I love that it‚Äôs just a nicer way to live life. I grew up in CA and came here at 18 and now my life is more stable and better than many of the people I went to HS with! But luckily I‚Äôm highly educated and have a great job. We need jobs for those that don‚Äôt have access to them and we need to get corruption out of our politics in this state. They only look at coal to save us, which is fine... until it runs out. They take all the wealth out of our state and leave nothing for the rest of us.
---
Yeah it was just I‚Äôm a bit thick so I put mr handy by accident
---
There‚Äôs a copper vein in the field north east of watoga and south of quarry x3.
---
Heck yeah, silver shroud.
---
Also like the vampire.
---
No, it doesn't l. It's bug for me, it NEVER shows me the condition bar again.
---
I imagine that Vault 76 is located in Ritchie/Gilmer County area. That would make Parkersburg at the black mountain ordnance works. Which is actually a pretty sweet part of the map.
---
Apparently the recipe is a secret, so we wouldn‚Äôt be able to.
---
Yeah it was an eyebot but I just put mr handy because I‚Äôm stupid
---
No, like ammo boxes and creates, they are player specific.
---
So either *I* am not getting anything, which means it's only affecting my account, or they are just empty.
---
All what platform?
---
Yup got one from a robot at watoga I'm on pc.
---
This seems like a confirmation bias thing. I'd be interested to look at any data you've collected though.
---
Right now I'm wearing the union outfit with a metal helmet and gas mask with goggles. It actually looks pretty deese
---
You on PC?  I have one on my survival only alt, I might be willing to part with it if you have anything decent to trade
---
Look it up. It legitimately happened and was the reason the PC beta got extended. A ton of people with slower internet couldn't play the first day because they had to re-download the entire game. I have ridiculously fast internet, so I was thankfully able to download it and get in within 30 minutes.
---
all these quest items are [craftable.You](https://craftable.You) already have the plans.Only thing is.....you need the old one....sorry. try find the summerset special.....its better.
---
I have a friend that I play with sometimes, who I met selling fuel to him, 3 per cap. So yeah there are some people who use it for sure.
---
If you have some useful plans I would recommend dropping them at the Overseer‚Äôs stash. I always drop my known plans and extra ammo there for the new players.
---
I been farming it with my reduced weight faster fire rate vampire cryolator. Dodgy and canned coffee , also suppressor . 
---
Dodgy 30% damage mit. Suppressor is another 30% damage mit. Canned coffee keeps ap good for dodgy . I take all pylons and hose that sheepbot with icy life drain. Demo expert and nuka grenades work well for ad control. Pretty easy to solo this way.
---
Is it an actual vein, as in several nodes, or just a single one?
---
My favorites are the jumpsuits with a leather cap.
---
4000/day on average they say.
---
Why are you complaining. This is exactly what the sub is for. Don't you want the game to improve?
---
I had a nominal amount of junk someone poached, but they died immediately where I died, so guess who got the poacher‚Äôs loot?  Karma baby.
---
Addressing the game maker in the post title comes off as a cheap ploy to flag that post as 'important' and most all of them are anything but. 
---
It's a child repeating 'mom, mom, Mom, MOM, MOM, MOM!'
---
I hate them. Send Beth an email or go the official forum if you want to share your half-baked ideas about what you would have done differently were you the developer.
---
You‚Äôve noticed this too? Yeah almost every duffel bag I‚Äôve looted over the last few weeks has had only Prewar money. The only one that  I believe has given me anything recently is the duffle inside the Whitesprings Clubhouse. The one on the floor near the kitchen.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt make sense in the lore.
---
Hit and miss. someone got over 500 steel from me the other day.  Free your mind and body of the burden of junk.  Let the loss of it just wash over you.  When you learn to take the "sweet, now I'm lighter" approach it'll change your play for the better.
---
Go to Watoga.  There are 4 different PA spawns:
---
- Roof of high school
---
- Crashed Vertibird in the center of town
---
- Roof of Civic Center
---
- Transportation Center behind a locked door
---
Melee and strength bobble heads and magazines?
---
1st time over the weekend.
---
Also check how much gunpowder you're carrying.
---
Exactly. Don‚Äôt run into a damn shitshow with all your junk.
---
Really? 2 days of farming Watoga 
---
And no arm
---
Yep I‚Äôm online now
---
Just saw him a few days ago near charleston. First time seeing him
---
I almost forgot about the Rad Shield and Mire location disease cures. Sounds like you have your shit together. I commend you
---
I kind of understand why. You cook with boiled water in real life, but what they should do is add "Boiled Purified Water" as an item and give us the ability to craft it at the cooking or chem station from Purified Water and Wood Scraps. 
---
Food that normally has rads when cooked with regular boiled water should have no rads when cooked with the boiled purified water.
---
Psn the same as your name here?
---
 Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast
---
Damn pre-war money. It seems like that‚Äôs all I find nowadays.
---
I first thought you'd say Falklands to keep to the same era...
---
Slot machine 76 haha! It's a total RNG bonanza isn't it.
---
I used to call black desert online black slot machines online to annoy my mate who played it all the time :-D
---
I do too. At least statistically. That green laser though. So cool.
---
This events is excellent for Quack Surgeon perk card from CHA tree. Just bring lots of booze and let's get this party started!
---
PM‚Äôd it to you now
---
I know this is a dumb question but what does meta mean in this situation?
---
There bare some in the White Nationalist movement who feel Trump is not evil enough.
---
ah mines explosive so i dont see green..but its fun to set things in fire lol
---
Once you have the key you can just server hop at the tnt dome, the tnt dome key isn't single-use
---
and the ally   and the silver   gauss uses so much
---
Oh yeah, i know. But i meant like which legendary traits would you recommend yourself? Like explosive, or faster fire rate or anything at all?
---
Honestly I'll take it over the original "I hate this game" posts that use to dominate the board.
---
Yes this exactly. Sums it up. 
---
Good post Jstengah
---
Ah, That's for single shot, right? For auto i'd use commando?
---
&gt; Slot machine 76 haha! It's a total RNG bonanza isn't it.
---
yeah and the saddest part is that people defend it,if you want some proper gear progression and actual progress that doesn't make you feel like you are wasting your time you will them claiming you want an easy game (hilarious considering fallout 76 is a casual mmo lite)
---
Bobble heads 1meelee 2 strength ... no magazines
---
Really just a t shirt, slacks, and the Halloween mask. With my mole gauntlet on
---
Where are you gonna get another Grant's saber to make a sword?
---
I dunno about meta, but I'll give ya 10k caps for that there aae handmade.  I doubt you're looking to sell tho
---
I feel super high class stepping out of my pa in my super clean New Years tux amongst a bunch of filthy peasants in clown suits
---
yeah its just as buggy as it ever has been, wither the game crashes, or the SBQ just flys off away from the event...
---
its very frustrating and a waste of time
---
Brotherhood Bomber Jacket with a Faschnacht Beret
---
Good on you guys for not being shoot on sight, i tend to take that attitude for granted because i put my weapon away constantly, so I'm not red. Had 2 guys chase me out of the ammo factory earlier tonight. 2 to 1 I'm not going to contest, so i snuck out of there and left some nasty nuclear surprises
---
I'm just checking out the sub to see if the game has improved, when the next updates will come out, if it's worth playing etc. Just because I'm not playing this game on the daily and am very critical of it doesn't mean I can't interact on this sub.
---
At some point  your stash is full and you have max caps.   I feel i cant do much because i am somehow stuck. I cant sell stuff anymore and the stuff i wanna buy is not available. So no more legendary hunting for me.  We need more events like SBQ.  So ppl would spread their activities.  I hope the dungeon thingy wil be good tho..
---
Speaking of that do you have to find the plan for the mole gauntlet or is it a quest item?
---
Normally it resets after 20 hours. Its odd
---
I'm just saying its a little useless to post them here.  It's not really a good discussion, because the target audience is not listening or looking here.  Very rarely do any of the CMs post here.  There is an actual feedback/suggestions place on their official forums.  This is a place for fans of the game to get together and discuss the game together.  
---
It's the equivalent of getting together with your buddies and talking about how you want to see a change in government but not actually voting.
---
I‚Äôve been getting quite a few at white springs while it‚Äôs not nuked  lately. One to three stars on a melee build.
---
oh my god.
---
I do similar except I use grim reapers sprint instead of bloody mess.  I may swap that out tho as it doesn't seem to proc often enough to be worth losing 15% more potential damage
---
This is my opinion, and you're free to disagree, but I think that allowing players to stack so many rare consumables for such ridiculous bonuses leads to poor gameplay. Clearly they want to level the playing field to some degree so that anyone has somewhat of a chance - that's evident in how they are boosting low level damage output in pvp and trying to prevent people from being one shot. However, with the current "meta" builds, the average player has absolutely no chance. No, I'm sorry "just stagger them" isn't a valid strategy when you die in 1-2 shots. And this goes a bit beyond PvP item / consumable balance, but just generally, I feel that time to kill is way too low. The best PvP experiences I had were contesting workshops on Adventure in the early days when no one had power armor. You had time to heal and retreat if you wanted to. Whether you wanted to spend the stimpacks to win was a tactical decision. Now, stimpacks have a cooldown so that's more balanced. Although, they forgot about Nuka Cola which heals for even more and has no cooldown.
---
And once you stack all of that damage and have full assn/sent gear and a AAE shotgun or handmade or legacy laser shotgun, you ARE damn near unkillable except for random staggers or going against another player with that gear, and it comes down to RNG, where the RNG is heavily weighted in your favor. My problem with this is that it makes for boring gameplay. It forces a very specific meta where you need to run one of 2 or 3 builds (slight variations are possible of course, but the core of how the builds work is the same) to be viable against the top tier players, and acquiring the gear and consumables needed to run one of those builds either requires going to ebay to purchase your gear or trading duped items. Power armor cannot be used, meaning heavy weapons are off the table, and the most efficient PvE builds are also worthless in pvp. It's rather unimmersive that I can stand there taking hits from behemoths and 20 super mutants and barely flinch, but a player can 2 shot me, yet it might take 50 shots before I get a stagger that allows me to do any damage at all to him. 
---
Again, this is my opinion, but this isn't a fun pvp experience to me. The only consolation is that the players who are in this tier, that have access to all this gear and have thousands of these duped rare consumables left, even after the dupe ban / delete waves, are pretty rare.
---
I like the old patched three piece suit (female). I run around like a sociology professor tho took too many shrooms at Jack Frost, it‚Äôs a blast
---
Think I just got it by killing mole miners. Dont remember the name of the area,  but there are a lot in the southwest corner of the map. Looks like a big industrial area.
---
If the camp is something people come across a lot, the chances of it being destroyed are much higher.  
---
I used to make elaborate camps where people could use them, and to show them off. Too many assholes. Now I have a single-foundation portable camp I can drop where I need it. And I still drop it away from any major area, off the beaten path. The upside is I almost never get "your camp cannot be placed" notices.
---
Shit! I'm friends with that guy! I knew he was older but i didn't realize he was a vet. Going to have to let him know he's Reddit famous lol. He could be the next "skyrim Shirley" lol
---
Haha classic
---
Yeah I've tried that trick, it works (for now) but just looks bad too :)
---
My personal favorites are:
---
1). Bomber jacket with any baseball cap
---
2).  BOS engineer outfit with the brown cowboy hat
---
3). Either of the full enclave armors (all parts included) 
---
4). Any of the mascot costumes (currently rocking the sheepsquatch mascot outfit)
---
Bullshit.  You have the SBQ head?  And a behemoth head?  What do you mean when you say "almost all" exactly?  There are over 40 of them
---
I would take Scattershot 3 instead of strongback. All my shotguns are 2lbs and under fully modded. Not sure if you had 3 in enforcer but it is fantastic.
---
He‚Äôs a random trigger that can spawn in Charleston
---
Right on. Those things kind of sound like the Cabal from destiny if youve ever played
---
For rapid sniping I use a BE Lever Action.  700 paper damage, 2,625 sneak damage.
---
For high-armored targets I use a BE Hunting Rifle.  655 paper damage, 2,456 sneak damage, but it also has 40% additional armor penetration.
---
And for CQB I use a BE Handmade.
---
A BE Gauss or Blackpowder would have more alpha, but their DPM is much lower compared to the above and your chances of survival start dropping as your targets become aware of you and start closing distance.

I stand by what I said I don‚Äôt give a fuck about Muslims and ilhan Omar is a threat to our national security as well as Muslims in general. I‚Äôm not racist or xenophobic religion has no place in the US and Christians aren‚Äôt devout like Muslims so yes I do want that dirty piece of shit to get out of my country. Has nothing to do with killing feral ghouls and shit on fallout but you can choose to be a white knight on Reddit it‚Äôs no going to change the fact that even Democrats reprimand ilhan Omar, and I would rather be called xenophobic for saying she should step down and leave the US, than be praised for being an antisemite like omar. You‚Äôre probably a holocaust denier or something but as someone who is 50% Ashkenazi and had relatives who died I can confirm it did happen and dangerous rhetoric like hers and trumps is what started it. So no I want her out because I will always choose my people over anyone else because everybody can‚Äôt win and everybody can‚Äôt survive.
---
Meaning objects (junk) can't be placed, like shelfs, tables, etc. (although they say that is coming)
---
Every one has this issue. It‚Äôs a bug introduced with the patch.
---
Problem is, Wolf talking while you are dieing. They could have at least wait until Wolf is done before spawning it.
---
my favorite combination is:
---
1. black overalls (AS)
---
2. field scribe hat
---
3. sunglasses
---
4. veil
---
&gt; Instead rerouting those to events, new events like encryptid. 
---
So we can stock up on those sweet, sweet White Wolf Fedoras.
---
Fuck that event.  I did it a few times, but after getting the same bullshit worthless drops, I just quit.  It is 100%, undeniably not worth the ammo I use during it.
---
I'm from the BETA, it's not as bad as the BETA. Might find a glitch or bug but it seems like it's much more rare now. 
---
Content is interesting, I can set a goal for myself and play for weeks depending on the goal (since I've done almost everything). There are not that many quests but there are events to occupy you. Quests seem to be added with every major update, soon we should be getting a quest about campers or something that will add backpacks.
---
There are 2 new real quests, one is the nuka shine quest line where you get to craft alcohol (pretty much potions) that can buff you.
---
The other new quest is the sheepsquatch quest line which brings a few side quests for you to check out(nothing special just some story and a plan or 2), and a cool new boss that's a lot more fun then the SBQ. You also get some cool outfit stuff for killing the boss.
---
If you're like me and like the lore of fallout and finding out more id say jump in, but if you're looking for a game with hours upon hours of quests to occupy you, I'd say not yet.
---
I get you, I got a few weapons I can part ways as well. Happy hunting
---
Everyone I have spoken to that said "it's a terrible game" then admitted "I don't own it yet, can't afford it."
---
Western outfit with a baseball cap. :)
---
Never played it. I use it because I can pretend I have a wolverine hand. That or freddy kreuger.
---
yeah bethesda broke mods with last patch
---
If you're using the Bright headlamp, yes, change it to regular and it's not too bad.  For some reason people complained they weren't bright enough, now Bright is like a freaking halogen lamp.
---
What, you  don't want more White Wolf Fedoras?
---
Game is mostly dead, because there is no end game content at all. You can literally play game through in 4-5 days. After that there is no challenge and dying is almost impossible if you don't kill yourself by accidentally with explosive guns etc. Current end game content is only for people who love to hoard more useless junk to their stashes, which are not even needed to anywhere or take selfie pictures from themselves by wearing different kind of clown costumes.
---
Most of the bugs are still in the game that were on launch and new patches that should fix them bring mostly just new ones. They don't seem to be using version control check either on Bethesda so old bugs circulate in the game.
---
Don't waste your time or money to this train wreck. It won't be any better. There is a lot of better games already out and coming.
---
It's a pretty good piece for PVP! As a rifle user definitely want to get it.
---
I guess the better question here is when does this challenge reset - I had heard that weekly quests reset on Tuesdays at 4 pm CET/10 am ET/7 am PST and wasn't sure how accurate that was
---
Costs me more in stimpacks than ammo. I want to get the unique items from it then stop doing it.  I may just buy those things from other players though tbh.
---
All depends on your build, I like explosive and reduced weight, but you‚Äôll want others if you‚Äôre a vats build for example
---
There are 2 on the far West side of the map just. 1 just North and 1 just South of Black Mountain on the river bank. Both right on the water!
---
I love using these instead of the pipboy light, it's nice they are modable.
---
Sorry to tell ya but most of those items are pretty sub par.  I think the only one worth trading for is your vanguard combat armor arm piece.  I wouldn't be able to give you a 2 or 3 star gauss for it, but I do have a 1* anti armor gauss I'm not using.  Or a 2* instigating/limb damage assault rifle.  What do you want for the arm?
---
Lol. If you like the multiplayer games like this then you should check it out its a pretty cool game
---
Yea, I think you have a tail or an assassin after you.
---
You have to pvp and beat these people numerous times to break their will.
---
I was an assassin for a while, and I would take out, and send others to take out assigned targets. The business is super profitable if you have a good client.
---
Some general rules that can help you combat, stop or avoid assassinations:
---
Carry 0 caps or junk.
---
Don't wear Power armor
---
MEGA DON‚ÄôT wear Excavator Power armor
---
Replace your base in the same spot if you sense a griefer.
---
Don't use decon showers ever.
---
Kill the assassin. (Hardest part but best advice, they must die in order to stop their interest)
---
Send a message once killing the assassin to him that says: ‚Äùgg ez‚Äù say nothing else or block afterward. Do this to the sender of the assassin if possible.
---
Use the assassin as a conduit for revenge on the sender.
---
Once next to Helvetia, once next to Flatwoods, once next to point pleasant, next to the nuka cola factory
---
The info you seek is only shared in cliques. They quit sharing info about those glitches about a month ago from what I can tell. These people you seek to learn from are cap farming. I've tried complaining on here before about players using such glitches, but was told no such glitches exist, and that I was making shit up. Sounds to me like the exact thing you'd expect people to say to protect their little known glitches, keeps them off of bethesdas radar. So they can farm caps and sell them for rl money.
---
There's a copper vein and several nodes at Solomon's Pond.
---
It‚Äôs happened to me
---
Cool, thanks. I'll look into it.
---
When I don't like a game, I don't play it. I don't go on forums about it, I don't talk to my friends about it, I just forget about it. Then again I'm an adult so YMMV.
---
I don't play Survival, but Youtube and Discord is how the information spreads so fast. Someone figures it out, posts about it on a FO76 Discord channel. Then a Youtuber wanting hits makes a video about it. Some of the Youtubers are so lazy they just cut and past the text and don't even bother actually making an actual video of them doing it. Once it's on Youtube it's a day or two before everyone knows about it and is doing it.
---
Ah, Thank you :)
---
Skirt upshots?  Is this what we've come to?
---
Well.. Don't know if these are the "current prices" but bought TSE Handmade and TSE Combat shotgun for 15k caps each in past 2 weeks. And sold the shotty for 20k yesterday.
---
Yep this really blows.  Finally found X-01 calibrated shock after a thousand trips to the vendor and I still have to wait more until this glitch is fixed üôÑ
---
Enclave officer uniform with a crumpled fedora.
---
In game drops or as rewards would be my preference, too, but you get atoms for completing challenges which is kind of like a reward really.  
---
But you don't have to pay anything. You get atoms for completing quests, not just cash right? Like legendary drop for playing, you get atoms for playing.  If they took away the option to buy atoms with cash instead of grinding, that would end all this drama I guess.  Of course I'm sitting on like 8000 atoms because I think buying stuff is dumb.
---
Ooh, that is interesting. Thank you!
---
2 star instigating hunting? I‚Äôll take that off ya
---
I've seen an eyebot with rats, a protector with muts and a Mr Handy with a line of cats.
---
Pretty entertaining.
---
Theres flair on this sub already fir bugs and suggestions, i dont know if theres a way to filter out these, but quite frankly i prfer seeing player requests instead of just bugs, if this place gets filled with bugs its just negative content over and over, and they will make this sub as toxic as the main fallout sub
---
Yeah! Saw it once [Eyebot of Hamelin](https://imgur.com/gallery/iT0e1cr)
---
I've done this before but eventually you'll have so much lead you'll be rolling in it. Then you move to another deposit.
---
I was able to do the same thing, but with 4 x 1 dimensions.  Great little trick to avoid having to repair these damn plants every....single....session
---
No. Keep wanted PvP in. 
---
Gotta say, I mistakenly ended up wanted yesterday, for the first time... and it was fun. Some dude stalked me for about an hour. I could hear him, knew he was there... could NOT find him. It made the game tense, exciting... I knew how it was gonna end... but, man.. it was fun.
---
I think you mean Santa *Claus*, not Santa *Clause*.  Unless you're really into Tim Allen.
---
During events you can‚Äôt even PVP other players in Adventure or Survival so players jumping on the roofs sniping other players isn‚Äôt even possible unless there‚Äôs a wanted person in the event.
---
They were here for the Repair Kit fiasco.
---
this is the reason i keep a vampire blade of some sort on all my toons, its lightweight and health on hit can save you in a pinch.  or if your running low level stuff its godmod and saves your bullets.
---
At least it wasn‚Äôt some dick waffle firing a two shot MIRV at random in all directions...
---
All the jumpsuits
---
What? I just didn't recognize them as button inputs. Just confusing random letters.
---
No, assault rifle.  My only good hunting rifle is a quad vats critfill and I use that when I'm not using my instigating limb damage gauss.  But I figured it's close to what you're looking for so you might be interested
---
Same
---
man I want the statue but I can't get enough atoms
---
I've noticed that there's a LOT more senior citizens interested in gaming than I thought.  While running the unsolved cases quests, I was in an area with an older gentleman that sounded like he was of retirement age, and helped him find the last clue he was missing.
---
I mean, I'm in my 40's and definitely don't feel too old to be playing video games.  I grew up with computer gaming starting way back with the text based DnD games back in the 80's.  When I got Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game while I was in college, I knew it was something special and unique the first minute in.  I'm glad I can still enjoy new iterations of the universe over 20 years later.
---
Gaming is just an activity I enjoy, like some people are into fishing or knitting.  You're never too old to fish or make a scarf, so why should gaming have an age limit?
---
Drifter outfit.
---
Although I have pretty much every outfit found in the base game. Its very detailed, looks perfect for the wasteland, I roleplay as a rogue hunter so it fits to that theme. And best of all, I don't see so many people going for it even though it's found in the wasteland.
---
I stopped playing fallout 76 when it was unplayable for me, I kept getting the power armor glitch, that is fixed and im back now, its frustrating at points, not for glitches but other things.
---
I waited 3 months before buying it. I found it on eBay "New" for 23 bucks. 127 hours later and it's still pretty fun. Im glad I waited though.
---
it's really hard to get for some people, like me...  
---
Turned it in everyday for 2 characters, 2 times a day for each, after the update, still got none. T-T
---
I wish. I hold my finger down too much with my 50 cal. I have back up weapons but.. Sometimes you have to bring out the big guns.
---
üòÖ
---
Probably used 2000 rounds in today's session.
---
I did the Encryptid event once where the Imposter boss didn't spawn. It was just 15 minutes of killing adds until the timer ran out and I swear it was the best event I ever ran. So many 3 star gutsys to tag which dropped loot better than the boss ever did for me. Wish there was a way to just bug it like that every time to farm the trash and forget about the boss.
---
Bummer PS4 I'd have bought it
---
I know mate - I‚Äôm patiently waiting to see if a proper survival mode gets released with real rewards and challenges. So much in this game is broken, especially the loot economy.
---
I love the witch costume. I think it freaks out newbies when I fast travel to overseers camp and drop them some gifts.. "was that a.. Witch??" ü§£
---
Look some challenges, there are some pretty easy  (kill 76 scorched with a plasma gun) or take photos in the forest, hope this will help :)
---
You've made so many assumptions to help justify your stance its obvious that you're always defending your warped sense of reality. Maybe you should stick to video games since reality doesn't seem to be your cup of tea.
---
there are no dumb questions! with meta i meant in this situation there is always some kind of legendary mod combination on weapons that most of the playerbase prefer. from what ive seen its tse, be and aae weapons. i just try to value each of them to see what i would be able to buy.
---
Well for me the berry mentas is buggy and  don't work or take a long time for the effect to be active so it isn't a reliable way to sports stealth players.
---
I even just used it two berry mentas today and no aura was active.
---
I have seen like 5 lvl 1 legendary items in the past 2 weeks. They dropped off of lvl40-60+ enemies...
---
And when 76 was Announced there was the "not my fallout" tend that cropped up for a few weeks. 
---
Personally I'm loving the level of split between survival and adventure. When I'm dicking about chatting, meeting new interesting people, the restrictive consensual pvp is enough to give a taste Of a wasteland, survival is semi authentic, Mexican standoff at every event, paying attention to every shot fired, listening for player weapons. 
---
What i want to see is the legacy mode and upgraded perks force a survival conversion. You wanna be a legend? Play with other legends. You'd see uppity level 51s thinking they've got the best radicool nerd rage unyielding bloodied swing speed dagger min max build they can theory craft, and still be stomped into the dirt by older craftier wastelanders.
---
It is not "lot of better". When on launch it was level 95 garbage, then now it is just Level 93 garbage. So far they have done anything to improve what was major problem since launch- Shallow and boring game, that has no existing endgame. 
---
Even the quest lines they put into game, has been watered down to idiots, I complete them in less than 2 hours, not even turning my brain on. They haven't been even able to fix even simple and like SI of design things like "Missing text chat" or "Decent trading dialog". But what they have managed to figure out, that game need another camera.
---
I couldn‚Äôt imagine being this sure about something I‚Äôm wrong about.
---
Yikes. Dumpster fire material right here.
---
Haha. Man I was walking around flatwoods and saw the monster and thought it was a player. Did a double take and bout shit myself lol
---
i dont have one like stated in the post, would 10k caps be the normal price? i would then try to buy one by myself.
---
Have they? It‚Äôs had minimal content so far. Most of the announced stuff has been pushed and is only a few minor quests.
---
Instrument weapons also work
---
At least you didn't fall into a fissure site with several dozen bulked items!!!! Lol I hate Mondays....
---
I had 125k (all 5 characters at max). Then I bought a few weapons, and I'm down to 25k.
---
ty for the response!
---
I hate to break it to you, but it seems some raider has stolen all your furniture
---
I made my camp there when i was lvl 20 or something. Near the river, close to the broken wall with the sentry bot. I've been living there for pretty much all of my playtime.
---
1. Not once did the Whitesprings robots attacked by camp for no reason. If you hit them by mistake and you're on the other side of the whitesprings area they will attack your camp. Otherwise they won't do it. Sometimes even if you aggro the whitesprings robots their HP/Name will still show up as yellow so you won't know you aggroed them. They will attack your stuff in this scenario and only if you get really close their HP/Name will turn red.
---
2. Sometimes scorched/mongrels get close enough to attack the camp. If the robots start attacking the mobs they *may* hit your stuff by mistake but they'll stop attacking as soon as the enemy died. The damage caused this way is minimal.
---
3. Sometimes mutants/behemoths get in range and will start attacking your camp. They are the main source of damage.
---
4. When i had turrets i noticed that sometimes people will lure ghouls from the golf club/houses and fight them near my camp. Those ghouls did a lot of damage, but everything was fixed once i removed the turrets.
---
5. The only time i had my camp razed to the ground was because someone nuked the area and i was too lazy to log out.
---
6. Snallygasters never got close enough to deal any damage
---
7. Scorched beasts won't attack your stuff if you don't have any turrets.
---
I think i covered all the mob encounters in the area. My suspicion is that you aggroed some bots without realizing and they started attacking your camp.
---
That sounds insane!
---
I've also heard that they stack. I might be making stuff up, but I have 4 pieces (all limbs since I use Stead Fast) and I swear I barely get seen even when I'm right in front of the enemy or they bump up against me. But I also have 3 ranks of Sneak and Escape Artist and 15+ agility.
---
I've noticed the decline of decent legendary drops too, especially since the last two updates but it's not just that which has been tweaked to create a supply and demand to possible atoms and atom shop items etc....
---
They've tweaked thirst,hunger and food spoilage to plug the demand for a refrigerator 
---
Purposely took the ability to sell ammo to vendors or Break excess ammo down into mats....why? So they can sell ammo converters 
---
This legendary vendor isn't also going to be a simple affair.. Were going to "sell" legendary items for tokens... 1 star for 1 token, 2 star for 2 etc... and I'm placing a bet now to buy the legendary we actually want will cost 100-500+ tokens to buy or atoms for  xyz tokens
---
What do you mean random stuff
---
I will not accept any team invites from players I do not know.  
---
What get's me is why they don't send a message to me saying why they want to join, whether they need help with something, no just the invite, always sets off the alarm bells in my mind. I tend to play primarily solo and do occasional events, but playing in a team outside of an event? Nope.
---
I had the same happen to me so I put that quest on hold for a long while thinking I was too low level. Just went back at lvl 40 and only ran into lvl 14 or so scorched. Higher level player was probably there.
---
From the stash. Teddy bears bobble heads etc.
---
It's hard to say.  No one wants caps anymore so inflation is out of control.  Aae handmade are pretty high demand too so I wouldn't be surprised if someone wants 25k+ and that's only IF they even accept caps.  You're more likely to find someone who will trade it for a specific rolled armor, which is basically as hard to find as the gun itself... good luck to ya
---
Oh ok
---
Sadly, I have no idea. However, if it turns out it is, just have one of your friends who did the quest line to put the brewing station in your camp. This unfortunately doesn‚Äôt unlock the nukashine recipe, but you should be able to craft other alcohol.
---
Oh it never had any lol
---
It's so nice and central! Especially questing from about 25-35, it seems like it's right in the middle of everything. And that sweet, sweet junk. 
---
you can always fast travel to vault 76 for free, so having your base in the savage divide really gets you into both zones for free, and then it's cheap to travel anywhere from there. So ideal until you need to get into the bog.
---
I realize I could have worded that better.
---
I meant losses in regards to game features/mechanics between Fo4 and Fo76. In other words, Fo76 is less the single player game than Fo4, and what little it currently has in terms of multiplayer features in no way compensated for what was stripped out of the game.
---
I don‚Äôt think Fo76 is a bad game though. I‚Äôve put a hefty chunk of hours into it and have enjoyed my time for the most part. At the same time though it is glaringly obvious (to me at least) that Fo76 is a shell of a game compared to Fo3, FoNV, and Fo4.
---
Good job, but now some players and I can't complete the NukaShine quest :(
---
I track down bounties and play the micheal myers theme song
---
I have had the opposite, in this aspect. People often your grouping for fast travel to you or your camp. It does not happen often, but so far those who have traveled have created something I didn't have in the camp. Power Armor station when I was lowbie. Decorations are common. A poster, or rug, or something like that. One guy left a massive power armor statue last night.
---
Has nothing to do with trump or race. Islam is a religion i have no qualms with Asians or middle easterners but I do have qualms with Muslims that are killing my people and gloating about it in Congress, if you had my experiences with Muslims you‚Äôd see differently but you don‚Äôt. I‚Äôll never forgive them and that‚Äôs my right, I have the right to want my government to uphold my beliefs, and I will continue to voice them because they aren‚Äôt falling on deaf ears and I‚Äôm not the only person who feels this way. 
---
I don‚Äôt expect you to understand because you‚Äôve probably not had your family members massacred for no reason besides being Jewish, but I did not forget and I believe Muslims and Catholics have destroyed our planet and filled it with evil, it‚Äôs disgusting but one step at a time and the first is removing her from her post and exile
---
It was actually intentional. I went back and forth between the two. I was going to go for Santa Claus, but my basic train of thought is similar to the Legion and Caesar. I read some books, twisted it for my own use, and then branded it as my own.

Always been horrible, since beta

i have never aggroed them or anything, i could have gotten so many clips of it happening. when i hover my crosshair on them to see their name, it shows white. i have NEVER hit them everytime im at my camp cause they are there for protecting my camp from super mutants and such. next time it happens i‚Äôll upload the video on this thread and i‚Äôll show yall i aint kidding.

Yes, as a new player, I prefer to look at posts about tips and strategy on my lunch break. All of these posts on this sub should belong on /r/bethesda or something similar..

Bloodied Vats Crit Fat man. 2500+ on stat card
---
That is amazing. Do you use the survivalist mask? We need folks like you as the "E" in clause. (see above).
---
I'll pay you for some violet if you're on PS4.
---
I can confirm that is incorrect information. Maybe you have Hard Bargain 3 equipped.
---
Guns &amp; bullets #7 ?
---
Hah, nice.
---
If it's going to be like the Legion, there needs to be several different pronunciations of "Claus" too.
---
I get annoyed that mods you find or by sometimes have no real way of discerning what they're for. And I agree with you, more figures need to be available. Especially when alot of effect have samey descriptions.
---
I've been seeing loot in them like normal.
---
they are containers but i‚Äôve noticed that they can be moved by explosions.
---
You can build a terminal in your camp and play the already in game holotape games on it
---
Maybe... just maybe, this person doesn't read every post a person makes.  Good of your virtue signalling to notify him though.  You gonna dox him too and report it to MSNBC?

---
These days they are called such if they are too much of a coward to go to the PVP servers. If you are griefing on adventure, you are, without exception, a neck bearded incel coward.
---
I really hope they scrap the idea of putting repair kits on the shop for tomorrow's update.
---
You forgot the part where the game hangs when you respawn. When you log back on the event is gone. Not finished; gone.
---
This is what I was assuming. Disheartening.
---
Fallout is judging our reality and I'm here for it.
---
Ahhh ok! Now it makes sense lol. I‚Äôve seen a lot of people say this and I‚Äôve been wondering. Thanks for the info
---
Tell us that story about the bridge again.
---
I can see it now, my response to the topic thread turns into a jumbled mess of one hundred branching conversations as redditors argue over my minor suggestion, my notifications explode, no one can follow the conversation anymore... all because I thought it would be neat to keep a flower garden at some point in the future.
---
Coming
---
Aren‚Äôt you also playing the same video game? I don‚Äôt think that anyone should kill anyone but that‚Äôs not reality, reality is what we live in and in reality people will always die, but if I can help it I will always choose the people I love and that share my blood over those who wish to take it away. 
---
I refuse to strive for a common peace for everyone because it is unobtainable. If we have a year of peace we will have 5 of War it‚Äôs just how we are as humans, but all life wants to survive and I will choose my survival over anyone else‚Äôs. Because that‚Äôs my responsibility to myself
---
Let me look I'm not sure how much I have.
---
Nah im ps4. Thanks tho
---
You stay on how much hours?
---
"Clause", and "Klouse" for sure.
---
I think I can make my enforcers that help re-educate "krampus"
---
Even if they were twice as common as they are, it wouldn't be enough.
---
The Free States vendor bot is cool though.
---
Honestly i found new several items at vendors. Only thing i didnt find yet is the imposter outfit. The best loot in game is at a train station cause someone else sold it. Thats how i farm legendary items. Server and train station hopping. Cause lord knows no enemy i see is going to drop a fkn thing of any use. In 500 hours my best real drop is a troubleshooters cultist blade. My best vendor buy is sentinal armor and an explosive laser rifle all max lvl. This game has a serious RNG problem.
---
Tomorrow is the update that might add them, tho I hope they scrap the idea for the shop.
---
Probably a few
---
We ran it for the first and quite possibly last time last night. The questline was quite good, we enjoyed going around the map with something to do! Unfortunately the excitement crashed to a halt with that dumpster fire of a boss fight for very mediocre loot. Its more cost effective for us to farm the queen than this mess.
---
How did that even get out of Bethesda? Someone actually approved that mess.
---
Zealots works on Scorchbeasts. So I‚Äôm not sure where the disconnect is, but clearly how things are labeled and how the game actually plays it are different. (Source: comparison testing with a plain hunting rifle vs a Zealots hunting rifle. Yes, I did repeated tests and accounted for range and location variables)
---
I haven‚Äôt tested SK mods, they‚Äôre just ‚Äúeh‚Äù to me so not worth my time.
---
Shit someone building a maze is more fun for all parties involved vs someone who jerks off on jumping someone with PVE perk card load out in a menu.
---
Since miners max at 40, haven't you always gotten 35/40 lvl loot? Never gotten 30 from there. Also never gotten a mole miner over 40 that would have dropped lvl 50 equipment
---
that's my route. each "star" base has from 1-3 military ammo bags to scavenge.
---
Heh, i figured dude. it just amused me. 
---
Since not far into the beta, my camp has been in pretty much the same spot just outside Watoga. I've redone it a few times as i got new stuff, and once when somone wrecked it completely and i couldnt be bothered paying to fix it. 
---
Wierdly though, despite how convenient a place it is, in the whole time i've been playing, ive only not been able to place it like.. twice. Though there was a time when a church to atom got built just across from me, complete with loud area-chat preaching &gt;&lt;
---
One doesn't wear a loincloth if one doesn't want the attention :)
---
I will not accept random team invites, always smells like a set-up to me.  
---
I'm not paranoid, because since Fallout 76 is online, people are people, and some like to play as a raider, which is just another way of saying "I like being an a-hole, and role-playing as a raider justifies my actions." No, it doesn't.  
---
If you want my help, msg me and state your reasons, I might help, but it's highly unlikely I will.
---
Happened to me twice so far
---
Are you sure it is a player doing it? Could it be monsters?
---
Adventure mode is player vs Environment with exception of workshop claiming. The environment is deadly in Appalachia so you have to plan where you're placing your camp.
---
 If you see the yellow circle with a black crack down the middle: it's a scorch beast  spawning area. If you are placing camp anywhere near one then you are asking for trouble. Swamps have mire lurks in them, super mutants have certain spawn areas too so you have to scout out an area first
---
You‚Äôre taking it completely out of context.  I said I was confused as to how it happens, not that its impossible
---
If you're on PC, there is a mod that reverts to the old way of scraping stuff while in the craft and modify screens.

I have done that fighting SBQ it's easy to fall into a fissure site when you are looking at the sky.
---
RETREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAT
---
It is a terrible trope here.
---
The sense of entitlement that assumes both a unitary person behind the game and that they are beholden to your demands are gross.
---
Is this sad?  Or hilarious?  Or both. I have found a few gems that were sold to vendors, and I too have sold a few marketable high-value weapons to vendors just because weight.  But good tip. I'll check on lewisburg train each hop to see if I can snag the imposter gear.
---
Well I'm very happy to hear that lol, I have covert op. Equipped on my build, that's awesome!
---
Hi very, I'm Your father!
---
If they go this route, I am done with Bethesda forever. I'll never buy another BGS game.
---
I don't have a great setup of legendary gear - mostly 1/2-star stuff with a handful of 3-star items with sub-optimal combinations of effects. All of it was purchased from a vendor where some other player sold the item to it. Despite investing over 200 hours in the game and having killed countless legendary monsters, I have yet to see a single item I wanted to keep. There has never been an "aha!" moment where I found a drop I really needed, which is disappointing.
---
I've been holding on to a lot of low-weight legendary drops in my stash in hopes that the legendary vendor will let me sell them for something more desirable, but I'm keeping my expectations low for now.
---
Same goes for PA and weapons
---
I too like to live dangerously
---
1st online multiplayer experience for me too! 52 years old and finding lots of kind wastelanders willing to let me run with them.
---
The extra claw mod cant be learned my friend but vendors at watoga and harpers ferry usually have it.
---
I meant more like the really negitive like "this game's shit",and then find out,they gave up 2 weeks in,their gripes were, for the most part,trivail, but their still trawling reddit 4-5 months later.
---
the maths don't add up. Yup,its far from perfect,but its getting better.
---
next update tommorrow,we'll wait and see.
---
there are loads 4/5/6/7k hrs+  playing.its not that bad.and your comments are just as valid as the next guy,for or against.
---
got real sick of the constant game bashing that wasn't in any way constructive,so please all,less of "this object is floating in mid ait.This games shit". play or,not to play yoric

Make a big enough foundation, and you can grow crops inside. I have a 2x3 opening (6 squares) in the middle of my main floor that I use to grow corn, carrots, and razorgrain.
---
I'd like this so we can craft consumables that have no reads.
---
Every patch I log in and see if they've actually made changes to make this game playable. And every time I do they spawn me underneath my camp (stuck), and the game crashes within 30 minutes. it's REEAAAAALLY fun to invest in a workshop and then lose it immediately because your game crashed.
---
When the software you've purchased can barely run without crashing, it is *by definition* unplayable.
---
Most likely with vending on May7. Also, don't get your hopes too high thinking it will be like Fo4 where you can place any item anywhere you want. It will most likely be limited to display stands for weapons, armor, bears, bobbleheads, etc. based upon statements made.
---
We shall see though.
---
Sounds like something a synth would say.......
---
It's not enough though. It's not worth mining most ore because the acid required to smelt it becomes a huge grind. Much easier to grind it in otherways, like killing mutants and scrappign weapons for steel.
---
You guys still playing this game?
---
Here‚Äôs another thing about reports of ‚Äúunkillable players‚Äù. Some may be pure bullshit based on misunderstanding. Source: I was an unkillable player last night, through no action of my own. 
---
I was on my level 44 alt,  finishing off the events in survival challenge, and I‚Äôm at an event in Morgantown. Some 115 shows up with a TSE handmade and starts trying to blow me away. Well, he‚Äôs on open comms and starts talking, wondering why I‚Äôm not dying, speculating I‚Äôm hacking... eventually he said fuck it and left. 
---
I‚Äôm in normal, non-legendary gear. My secret? He was in the event with me, of course. Autojoined, and thus auto-teamed. And apparently not smart enough to realize that and also realize you can leave the event/team.
---
I will rename mine tonight - to pay homage to yours. F
---
This is OP
---
Of course not, this is where the feedback counts, so this is where they will get them.
---
It would be nice to get stickied threads for new common problems, like not being able to attach mods now, but the Moderation team is pretty stretched, and nobody wants to help, just complain, so this is what we have.
---
That's probably one of the best ideas out there but I'd also like to have like weapon racks to store weapons and display them
---
I got there at level 8 and had a go.
---
You don't want to know how long it took me to kill the level 62 that had spawned at the gate.  While perched on a wall out of the way of its attacks.
---
Similarly, the miner tokens from the "Lode Baring" event in the Ash Heap are not worth holding on to for the maximum reward, in my experience. I've done three turn-ins of 100 tokens (which weighs 10lbs, btw) and have gotten a recipe I already knew and a handful of junk every time.
---
Got the crafting plan at lvl 20 it really helped me out a lot was stuck at the Wendigo  cave until I got the plan, it also makes sneaking better.
---
Were all dying for a picture with damage numbers.
---
It's not as fast as the semi method for the gatling. Hit the trigger, let it rest, hit it again. You can go about 2 times faster with this method, and the mags are huge and easy to reload anyhow.
---
I'm familiar with that one. I'm looking more for harvestable nodes so I can amass the ore more quickly...and not have to deal with Sierra Bravo attacks and fog crawlers as much (I hope).
---
Cross the bridge with train tracks from Harper's Ferry.  When you hit the radioactive tunnel, look right and you should see some stairs.  Follow them all the way up.  You'll eventually see a one of those junky signal towers.
---
If you keep following the rock and stairs you should see the copper veins.
---
Strategically the top cliff is amazing for a survival mode camp if you don't mind not being able to farm or produce water.  I even built a dog house for the dog with a sleeping bag in it.
---
Not much violet flux, do have a ton of Yellowcake, Cobalt, and Crimson flux.
---
Buy stuff. Thats what I do. üòÇ
---
Before playing 76, if someone stopped me on the street and said "name three things about West Virginia...go", I would say moonshine, hillbillies and coal.  A very ignorant, stereotypical description for sure.
---
My view of the state has certainly changed from scary hillbilly backwater after playing and enjoying the game so much.  I was really familiar with a lot of the locations in Fo4 because I grew up in Connecticut (Boston is only like 90 minutes away from my parent's house), and I'd love to take a vacation with my wife to West Virginia to see some of the real-life areas that I've never physically been to, but have a deep connection with through the game.
---
Fallout 76 is an example of reviewers changing their scores based on internet sentiment rather than putting out a score.
---
The game was pretty fun at release. It's had a lot of bugs but the game is easily a game you can play for dozens if not hundreds of hours.
---
It's only better today than what it was.
---
The most impressive thing here is that you've actually managed to kill something with the cahinsaw. Like, i think you might be the only player to have done so.
---
Currently rocking a miner uniform until I find something more sleek looking.
---
I'm too young for the Falkland's lol
---
people only dislike the turrets there, none cares if you build there with no turrets
---
I'll be on in about 5 minutes
---
Same here. Dufflebags only have pre-war money in them now for me also. I'm not sure what happened or when it did.
---
Yeah I assumed it would be like that. Hopefully we get mannequins though. I‚Äôd love you display my outfits and power armor. Even if it still takes up stash space.
---
What? It's a shooter looter, most of the game is walking into places and encountering locked boxes. I can't think of another game besides Fallout 1 where you had to equip/unequip items just to lockpick stuff.
---
my bad corrected it
---
yeah, kinda sad that I may never be able to complete an aspect of the game. 
---
Did fasnacht, did, sheepsquatch, didn't have enough time to visit nukashine.
---
Maybe melee needs a buff? Who knows.
---
Ironically this post is immediately followed by a ‚ÄúBethesda pls‚Äù on my home page
---
buff everythimg, nerfs are bad, theres already a bulletsponge problem, adding more bulletsponging is not a fun mechanic
---
Honestly it depends, is the game too easy? Is it just right? Is it too hard? People have different opinions on it. Personaly I enjoy a challenge so I would Nerf the melee. But I know other people really enjoyed one-shoting things so that is a reason to buff guns. I don't think there is a simple answer.
---
This sub is nothing but bitching for the most retarded reasons now. Nobody discusses the game anymore.
---
I was assuming it'll change with the Burrows update tomorrow morning.
---
Furious bash damage Dragon.
---
Thank you
---
Sorry dude, maybe they will reopen it sometime in the future. I missed all of fasnacht and I have to wait a whole year until it‚Äôs open again, so I feel you.
---
I modified the default power armor light texture to be larger and 50% dimmer on PC. Might upload it on Nexus.
---
Idk why but hot female characters with sexy costume in MMO's are usually dudes
---
Same here. No loot.
---
LOL.  I had a feeling that the three tiers of rewards were the same lootgen pool that 1-3 star legendary enemies have, only requiring much more work.  I used to do Monster Mash a lot with a buddy that was obsessed with it, then got completely sick of it and generally ignore it now.
---
Those lockers in the Ash Heap were bugged and were never supposed to have the key. You have to go through a fun little mini-quest to get it. Very similar to the new dome 7 quest in that they both have very hidden locations and one-time passwords. Here's a full walkthrough to get it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7pSKBuVIiE
---
Yes you can
---
Everyone thinks themselves informative and imaginative. Therein lies the problem.
---
Tattered rags with faded visor
---
Not going to happen. If they want to travel for free, they can use their CAMP or Vault 76, otherwise, they can walk or sprint to their chosen destination.
---
Well i have nearly 240 hours played and for most of that time my camp was at whitesprings. Those robots never attacked me for no reason. If i did aggro them they did attack, otherwise mongrels scorched and super mutants were the only ones attacking it. 
---
Would be great if you could provide a video and as i said, you need to get close to them, give the robot a hug. If it turns red its because you hit one by mistake. Just hovering the crosshair over the sentry bot won't do the trick.
---
The easiest way to aggro a bot by mistake is with Two-shot weapons. Even while using vats, one of the 2 bullets may hit a bot.
---
Also sometimes they're simply not spawned so the mobs i mentioned above can attack your stuff.
---
And now it occurs to me that my character currently looks like Krampus.
---
https://i.imgur.com/lGdmUHT.png
---
And one with a pack of feral dogs. Dogs will attack though.
---
Buff everything else. Melees are the only things that do insane damage besides those insane legendaries people find
---
There's a couple of them, I've seen the pied piper eyebot around Charleston.  In the Northwest corner on the road by the farm I've seen the one with all the cats following the Mr. Handy.  I've also seen the two tourist Mr. &amp; Mrs. Handy bots, with the Mrs. Handy complaining they've taken a wrong turn in  Cranberry bog.  I thought it was going to start some kind of a quest but just funny dialogue was all.
---
You can repar it to 200% and then it makes 40 damage very fast and for gul killing in the withespring its very good.
---
that is adorable
---
I bought FO76 last night for ¬£8.99. at that price I wasn't too fussed if it was bad or good. Played about 4 hours so far so I'm feeling good about my purchase. 
---
Had a couple of random crashes to desktop which is annoying but other than that runs ok. Gameplay so far is interesting and I'm looking forward to putting a few more hours in.
---
I'd say buy it if you can get it cheap in a sale and see what you think.
---
And you sir...... username checks out lol
---
I find the biggest disparity is the definition of griefing. Camp flattening Bethesda has heard the community and its getting removed *if the player has pacifist on* which is ideal for player vending. 
---
A team of 2-4 sending a hit squad after a workshop owner out in the middle of the wasteland is 100% fair game. The 2 big changes is it should be instantly noticeable, not the dinky little "gorge junkyard is under attack" text that pops up now, and in adventure workshop pvp all members of a team involved in pvp with another player be flagged on the map. 
---
Ideally to the defender it would be *bum dum dum* quest started, eliminate attacking player(s) to defend your workshop. 
---
They open the map and see 1 hostile flagged player dot at the workshop, and 3 on their doorstep. Their camp would be at risk because they chose to engage in workshop pvp. If they reject the quest to eliminate the other players, they surrender the workshop, pacifist reactivates, and camp is no longer at risk. If they fight they accept all consequences of that fight, win or lose.
---
My definition of griefing is witch hunting and bridging, doxxing a player name, sever stalking, toxicity in the lines of racism on voice chat, not playing a hostile character in a wasteland setting
---
i agree!! one of the most confusing and disappointing things in this game were waiting to find a assault rifle, as they were the best in FO4, only to realize they are actually horrible weapons in 76, no reason at all to use them even on my maxed rifle character, handmades and lever action rifles are far superior, which is wierd
---
it should be the other way around!
---
I was alos very very disappointed that the fatmans are also nerfed very badly, they are mini nuclear explosions!!!!
---
Duuuuumb
---
Wow! TIL, I just use cranberry cobbler cause it was a recipe by default and didn't bother adapting to anything else.
---
Now I can get a bit more boost. Thanks.
---
not In my experience, I've killed others with sneak attack damage in PVP
---
I ran a nuke yesterday and got two 3\* pieces and a 2\* machete.  None were great, but it seemed normal enough.
---
I've been having trouble sleeping lately, so I took a quick circuit around the place around 5am and got a shit ton of single star junk off diseased ghouls, but didn't see any starred enemies.  I usually get a couple, at least.
---
It's the old damage bug. Notice how it gets worse the longer you're in the game.
---
It's less serious, but it's damage not registering. It can reach up to 90 percent of shots (none crits) missing on direct hit.
---
It's typically only prevalent on enemies when your damage is inconsistent or rapid.
---
Fair enough. I shall take your word for it, and continue smashing things with a hammer regardless though &gt;&lt;
---
Yep
---
good points
---
"I Am Become Death"? there is are so much many bad horrible grammer there here
---
Damn, that's some grinding dude, major props.
---
There are a few things that should be "corrected", like Gun Fu being a gun only perk, rifles need weight reduction options, and mutations have almost **0** negative affects on melee builds. 
---
I'm more looking for balance than nerf/buff specifically.
---
That's why I was determined to explore the map as much as possible, to unlock all the locations for fast travelling to or spawning at. It certainly helps.
---
I always appreciate it when people keep an open CAMP especially if they are in an area where I'm doing a bunch of quests in the area or am encumbered. Some people have that design like you say and its pretty cool to see what they build
---
Oh god that fedora is exactly what I am talking about.  Oh and the one star piece of leather armor dropped for me.  And the three start pitchfork that dropped on another occasion that I did it.
---
The wasteland never ceases to amaze me!
---
I was out in the mire trying to find a mega sloth to shoot the vox syringe with. I had never seen a mega sloth before. I found one, which was a hulking one and after 30 seconds of the vox dart being active the mega sloth was still kinda glowing pink. I decided to kill it and then realised why it was still glowing pink.
---
Behind me was a mythic flat woods monster, whom I had also, never seen before, 180 hours in.
---
I loved the fight between it, cause it bamboozled me when it teleported and reappeared. 
---
After I killed it, I finally received the 160 atoms that were waiting in my challenges tab, and then the unexpected happened...
---
A group of fog crawlers literally came out of nowhere, which I had also, never seen before. A large one and 3 small ones were chasing after me before I decided to plant my mini nukes into them.
---
So in the space of about 10 minutes I basically had 3 boss fights and had no stimpacks left on me. I accidentally used a nukashine whilst attempting to heal and blacked out back to the top of the world, where my camp is literally only a mile down the ski slope.
---
I had to question wtf happened in that short amount of time
---
wow here's bethesda teaching us about west virginia
---
Im starting to think they should buff all guns and 1h melee and just add some more challenging continent. Say a boss for the new dungeons that has 1/4 of a sheepsqauch health vs a team of 4.
---
No worries, I have 2... just let me know
---
Deletion of pvp essentially makes the game server hopping for the ammo factory.
---
It deletes risk, in simplest terms.
---
Well said.
---
As a West Virginian this is one of the main reason's I like this game. I'm really happy it's changing some perception for people who play
---
I am here not to trigger people here, but to sound my thoughts on this, however unpopular they might be. 
---
I don't care for the Repair Kits. If they want to add them to the Atom shop for money: let them.
---
It is without a doubt a feature that DIRECTLY changes the gameplay. Most of my time with the game I scavenge for resources to repair/build stuff. It is part of the main game loop and adding something like this is a huge change to that loop. Effectively removing it. 
---
But again I don't care for them. So yes people who would have bought it will have a much easier time with the game. They will go grind out the legendary locations, summon the Queen or the Sheepsquatch and doing whatever else they would like. Will it affect me? Not really. Trigger the queen and sheep? Sure, easier for me to join. Farming legendary spawns? Sure, it happens right now anyway with TSE and what not so it won't change (yes they won't need to step out to repair their stuff as often but still they will eventually run out of steam and I will just server hop). 
---
The advantage that they will get can be pretty noticeable, I am not trying to downplay it. But does it affect us? 
---
Let them farm more time and do more events, let them become stronger. Eventually we all will do the same events and they will make it easier for us. The problem here is that they will go so fast through the end game content and be ridiculously over-powered sine THE GAME IS BROKEN AND UNBALANCED (yes they will get even stronger for PVP, but cm'on, it is ridiculous how broken PVP is so why bother). In the end, I fail to understand why would anyone even bother paying for stuff in this game since the end game is awful, nothing to do, so many bugs with each patch and overall empty experience. 
---
P.S: I always have high hopes for the game I come back for each update and log to see and feel how the game has changed for the better, since I believe there is so much potential. Look at the Division 2 and it's state on release, they are worlds apart, and it is with a heavy heart that I say that the game might be irredeemable at this point.
---
PS 2: As many have wrote here: Bethesda just tried to get as much money of the 2% people that stayed playing this game.
---
yeah that is a thing too, and you are right as far as i can tell, simply closing the build menu and reopening fixes it
---
i don't own the game but i feel like it's improved a lot from launch ( patch notes )
---
i really hope this comes to game pass
---
Thats what I'm tryong to do with the Union outfit. Play as a soldier or something
---
Thanks, glad it's not just me!
---
Yikes, hoping they can quickfix it here soon
---
It will definitely be tied to stash
---
What I'm hoping they might be able to do, but this has not been mentioned and is kindve a pipe dream, is shelves that behave the way they did in skyrim where you place items in them and it organizes them and displays them, but that might be a bit too intensive on the server to not cause issue.
---
The problem is, bathesda tends to make bosses just by making them a bullet absorber. That just makes it so that people waste ammo on an enemy without a good reward. If they made a few bosses that had interesting mechanics for killing it and that gave rare items or multiple legendaries that that would work.
---
From what another poster told me, they hope Tuesday they will put the minor patch through to fix  it
---
here is data mined screenshot of sheepsquatch at minute 10:03.Also,seems like very few ppl has no0ticed this but in the challenge to kill all cryptids,the sheepsquatch was added.Check it out yourdelf in "challenges"

I'm level 168.
---
Good doggy is enough to act as a shitty-stimpak when you're low on stimpacks.
---
Rejuvenated gives you +50 AP regen. I care more about AP regen than the health benefits.
---
I use aquaboy because there are still some parts of the map that are underwater and because you can't "swim" in power armor, your only option is to walk underwater and die. So I leave it equipped usually.
---
I don't even understand how power armor protects the user from the environment but doesn't let you breathe underwater.
---
I'll give Fireproof a try though. 
---
My main point about the perks is that changing stuff like this, especially lockpick perks is ridiculously annoying. Even with profiles it would still be atrocious. They should've done stuff like lockpicking in other ways.
---
And fireproof or not the scorchbeasts are still going to be shitty spammy enemies. There's no reward in bothering to waste the ammo.
---
So even if they're not OP by damage, once I've chewed through a ton of ammo, I have to change perks to TP to a bench, then change perks to super duper, then change perks for weapon repair, then change perks for ammo production.
---
Send Memes!

31?take a power armor a superhammer from mutants (lvl 30 weapon)  go to whitespring and kill the ghouls hope for high lvl ghouls some lvl 42 and some 62 that's what u looking for. And your lvl is good for this lvl from the enemy's. I did it by my self over the weekend and I'm now 65  if u get a weapon with vampire u pretty set. U get all stuff u need from them. It's great just the server hop can be frustrating at times. If u looking for some quests... Idk :)
---
this might be one of the best posts i have seen.... ever.
---
This is exactly what goes through players heads when they nuke a players camp. Then when they get bored they go play some fortnite and talk about how they can‚Äôt wait for fallout to be more like fortnite.
---
ohman i was addicted to fo shelter when it first cameout
---
Yeah the servers are quite fragile. But that would be nice.
---
I'm tired of the "x monster is too hard and too unrewarding because I don't know how to play the game and can't handle a tiny challenge" type of posts.. those asking Bethesda to hold their hand every part of the way.. just see tomorrow where people who expect to solo the new dungeon, where they can't, and come and whine here.
---
If a player can't be bothered to explore the map sufficiently to unlock enough of the locations and therefore the fast travel/re-spawn points it's their choice, but expecting others to support your free travelling is a terrible mindset. Make the effort, reap the benefits.
---
You can be addicted to things that are bad. Just ask a drug addict.
---
I ***just*** got my first legelndary hunting rifle yesterday (*explosive/executioner*) from a vendor because somebody sold it.
---
Been looking for one forever, any type.  That was the first legendary hunting rifle I have even seen.
---
I am in the same page as you, they are going full pay to win with the legendary vendor.
---
I will admit, I don't have any experience with the harpoon or the gatling outside of rng pick ups.
---
I don't run heavy builds.
---
I'm tired of dismissing them too
---
There's a steel and copper vein within camp-building range of each other - very roughly speaking, it's above the lighthouse, to the left of Gorge Junkyard and to the right of Vault 76. There's a crashed plane in a hill leading to a cliff; the nodes are on the cliff itself
---
I'm in my 60s and still working. I've been a gamer since...well, the 1970s. I am definitely a lot pickier now with what games I play, because I just don't feel up to learning new, complex systems (like Cold Waters) or "twitch" games where I have no hope.
---
FO4 is one of my top-5 favorite games/universes, and while I held off until last  month getting FO76, I'm having a blast. I estimate I have about 60 hours in, but I'm only level 14; I enjoy taking my time exploring and scrounging and building a nice bed and breakfast. Sure, I'd love a few more levels, but having fun after a day of solving problems is what I'm after.
---
I'm on PC. If someone starts an Old Farts guild, I'd be happy to join.
---
I swear to Atom that it waits until I forget it's going to come up and go to click on social, then Bam! Spalsh screen! &gt;&lt;
---
Nice looking camp! I was looking at possibly building in that area, not there but around there, does your camp get attacked by the SB in the area, even without turrets?
---
how do you get it to **3**.75?  Max I can get is 3?
---
2.50 from covert ops
---
2.65 with mr. sandman
---
then stack calmex
---
I greatly doubt that a soda fountain of that size would be for player vending...
---
I think it would make more sense if the the locker, terminal, soda fountain, and cabinet were all one single unit and was the player vending machine. They all also seem to be on top of single metal base, and the main menu video screen also has them arranged as if they were actually a single model. With that in mind, I guess the lockers are for weapons and apparel, terminal is for seeing what's on sale and for how much, the soda fountain for drink (and maybe food?), and the cabinet with the small drawers is for small/junk items.
---
Trip Advisory must be run by Super Mutants
---
You don't think that would be more appropriate on The Dragon?
---
That's what annoys me when people go "Fallout 4 had them why doesn't 76!?!?"
---
Because Fallout 4 didn't have the added variable of online servers that cause things that work properly to break because "fuck it yolo"
---
haha wrote "super-mutant cowards" at first but edited my post
---
I found a few but most just want to join for another camp spot, I had Someone help me launch a nuke but he didn‚Äôt have a mic which made it tough but funny üòÇ trying to figure out what he ment. I can‚Äôt wait to build up some friends to play with on a regular basis listening to others talk about the fun they have sounds great
---
You forgot the part where you get disconnected from the server.
---
how it happens? assholes grief people, that is how
---
its random, some kid got grounded so he's pissed so he decides to destroy everything in a video game to feel better
---
just pray you arent in Timmy the Terrible's path of destruction
---
I have mine on acid node. Lead and steel ores are easy to farm, but you need acid to break them down.
---
I used to use the "bright" version, had similar problems, then tried out the "blue" option.  It's much, much nicer.  It's a gentle, pale blue color, almost like the plain version, but softer toned.  The only time I miss "bright" is when I'm in a really, really dark area like a mine.
---
The problem is that headlamp mods are pretty hard to find.  Check the mods list at the vendors in Watoga and Harper's Ferry.  I got mine from Phoenix.  I use T-51b, and he often has T-series mods.  Obviously the bunker is the place to go for X-01 and Ash Heap vendors for excavator versions.
---
Make your own ammo it‚Äôs easy.
---
Legies or not running a loaded glowing ones WS by yourself is fun as hell.
---
I must admit the new event with a sneaky, bloodied melee build is... tricky.
---
Not because of the regular foes or the Impostor but because of the lag.
---
I can take sizeable chunks of the Impostor's health with every hit... I just don't seem to connect many; mostly pawing at thin air and giving away my position.
---
Not sure how that's helpful for this but here you go: http://www.asciitable.com/
---
About 50% of that was my first time doing it, mainly the dying and respawining, but I knew how to complete the event, it is just not that easy to avoid being one shot... After completing the event three times my experience is more like
---
- **Start the event myself after spending 1900+ caps**
---
- Alright, I hope someone shows up!
---
- **Wait, while the pylons acquire their target**
---
- Sweet, five people showed up, all above level 100, and a few level 75 people! great!!!
---
- **Activate the pylons**
---
- Alright lets do this ~ *I proceed to activate all three pylons by my self and jump on to the roof of the shack an use a stimpack every eight seconds or so while killing bombbots and taking pot shots at the squatch*
---
Several minutes and several dozen stimpacks later
---
- **Event Completed** *Bloodied Gatling Laser as a reward from the squatch, with three effects, double limb damage is one of them.*
---
- AWESOME, best drop I have gotten in a while!!!
---
This was my most recent experience.
---
What, no one misses the junk jet?
---
I‚Äôve actually had lots of luck with legendaries since the patch.  Only thing that was noticeable right away was Watoga.  I had 2 spawn at West Tec last night, one outside and one inside and several at Whitespring...none in the main building though.  Actually got my first 3 star as well at West Tec yesterday...3 star explosive mutant slayer combat rifle.
---
and they can see a red aura around you - in fact, they will see the red aura long before you see them.
---
&gt; I don't even understand how power armor protects the user from the environment but doesn't let you breathe underwater
---
Umm... power armor does let you breath underwater.
---
Vampire is a great bonus.  I have a Vampire weapon and it keeps me overflowing in Stimpacks.  Good for cash flow!  Nice find.
---
Ammo Smith.  Had no issues since I got the perk.
---
Hey, I'm in California, and I'd be happy to join you guys if you're still looking for teammates.
---
Same. I really look forward to them perfecting this online version of fallout and then in a couple years when the next fall out comes out it being the greatest game ever made.
---
My best recommendation is to get different rifles that all require different ammo types. And I would recommend getting a .50 hunting rifle. It does less damage but because of the .50 machine gun you get so much from crafting.
---
I have a good supply of steel, gunpowder and acid. Just the lead driving me mad. I need to find a good farm location for sure.
---
Veterans - The Veteran Fallout Community is a group of retired, active, disabled veterans making the wasteland a better place! 
---
Any vets want to join, send me a message here or on Xbox GT: SaltClaw
---
That's why I prefer to sit in a tower and pick people off with a Gauss.
---
Ammo smith and super duper perke
---
Farm Legendaries with my Machete and then post them for trade, usually 25 shells per star, even if it is a 2 shot
---
I do! I love awesome camps an players that in "character". I'm going to build a trading post in the forest region soon. I've been waiting for player vending so I just kept my base near the middle of the map for now.
---
I have thought the same thing
---
Har the same happen to me, tried everything.
---
Had to do get all keys again...
---
I figured that there was something up with it when I noticed a huge damage difference between it and the regular combat rifle. 
---
Now I hope we can legend regular weapons so I can make a furious fixer with explosive rounds....
---
Statue is bugged for me. Lol. It shows purple and black boxes instead of explosion animation. Put in a ticket, have to wait and see what they say
---
Do you know if the mutation serums are fixed and they can be used?
---
Where is it located?
---
Ooooo would you be willing to sell it?
---
My CAMP is situated on an acid resource node but yeah i agree, its still a pain, i would rather be on a junk node but i just need the acid for smelting, yet i have about 80 left over power from ky fusion generator i could be using
---
The only advice I have is the one that you have already given yourself.
---
Either have a hybrid build were you can farm for ammo and mats to make more with a melee 'setup' and then switch to ranged when needed or specialize - that is what I did - and have a pure 'thumper' toon to take care of these matters (I also farm aid items at the same time) and then your dream 'ammo chomper' toon that can consume ordinance with reckless abandon where/when appropriate.
---
Yeah and for the fat man they literally add a fat dude sitting on it
---
On the map I don't really see the reason for this as it takes me 1 second to identity who's marker it is. But in the compass, it would be a good QoL change. On the other hand, it would break the color scheme of things.
---
If you ever go into the Mire and spawn to the Harpers Ferry Point turn around and walk along the bridge, maybe we are in the same world and you can benefit from a little resting place with every stuff to craft etc
---
I downloaded it for the 3rd time a few days ago.
---
I made a record and played 3 hours before I got depressed and started feeling suicidal.
---
I plan to redownload it again in a few months to try again.
---
*soothing voice*
---
Lately I‚Äôve like the wild man outfit + imposter sheepsquatch helmet for maximum caveman vibe
---
The ability to exchange it would be great.
---
You are exactly where I am. I am concentrating on melee, sniper when needed, and shotgun.
---
I have some good melees I use 99% of the time. I have a couple of good snipers for those times I need them. Finally, I have a really good shotgun.
---
So I only need to keep shells and .308 rounds. I can craft .308 anytime I need it, and I seem to be able to find enough shells while traveling to keep those stocked.
---
Other than that, I have start just dropping or not even picking up anything else.
---
Ammo Smith and super duper then hit up Lucky hole mine for 2-3 Server hops  with your excavator power armor then go to the Mountainside bed and breakfast and kill the two static spawn Yao Guai for acid for 10 server hops and you will have about 100 acid then smelt  the Ore at the chemistry station one word of caution the Ore weighs .1 lb so the weight will add up fast.
---
Good idea and something I use to do but I leave it on for low lvls without radaway, had one ask for radaway from me yesterday since he was a far as you can be irradiated after you die from radiation damage and just sent him to my camp. Surprisingly I see people coming a lot for the shower and just wave to me.
---
Well cap stashes don't refill for me during the week. I don't spend a lot of time on during the week, only the weekends. I don't see another reason why they wouldn't refresh for 96+ hours but work fine on the weekends when I actually play.
---
Oh boy this "It does less damage" thing again...
---
Standard 50 cal receiver:
---
https://i.imgur.com/YYTvame.jpg
---
Hardened 308 receiver:
---
https://i.imgur.com/zU5Zimk.png
---
Same amount of damage. There's no downside to picking a 50cal rifle. Just use the regular 50cal receiver not the refined one.
---
It's a mmo that is about surviving in the world after a nuclear holocaust... I'm not sure it's supposed to have an endgame. That's the point. It's hardly broken at this point.
---
Nice ..
---
Seen it twice!  The last time was around Harpers Ferry
---
The Dollar General thing is disturbing. I'm from the PA coal region and it's the same deal. I could drive to ten different DG stores and not be further than a half hour drive from my house.
---
The economy is really a result of the fact that if it weren't for coal there would never have been so many people living here. Not enough people left after the coal jobs dried up, but then those that did sunk the housing prices for decades and/or left crumbled houses behind as a burden for the rest of us. It's getting better here than it was in the late 1980's though. I think that was the peak of the abandon stuff.
---
This might help you understand: https://www.wired.co.uk/article/manhattan-project-robert-oppenheimer
---
Oooh I never tried Harper's Ferry. I'll add that to my route. Last night i had some good luck with West Tek, I found around 4 legendaries inside and 2 outside.
---
Ay I wanted to open a nuke cola vendor too
---
Ok, that is news to me. I have always been told it does less damage. Never gotten the receiver myself because I don't use the hunting rifle
---
You have to get the plans
---
If you have any mods installed, they can interfere with the display of lots of things (I tried one once, immediately turned all power armor into *bright* glowing pink or purple).
---
Idk tbh, I lost my last bloodied weapon to a bug. It's pretty low. It might never stop going up until you're dead. When I had my bloodied gatling gun I stayed around 50% hp, as I don't like how vulnerable nerd rage makes you. With healing factor and adrenal reaction with about 50% radiation damage I was very tanky whilst dealing solid damage.
---
I get that. But when equipped the coils don‚Äôt appear.
---
I have to keep remi ding people of thst everytime i see people moani g about not being able to place unlimited items or have enourmoud camp budget ect.. Or being able to build camps next to each other.  
---
As someone who pushed my PC to the limits by using the no build limit mod on fo4 i can garuntee it is not wise to have the same building budget as that
---
Oh, I misinterpreted what you said
---
All events should get a buff to legendary creatures.  At this point most people have access to good weapons to try their hand at farming. 
---
I would love to see more stealth buffs instead of nerfs.
---
I know you mean sell ammo to Vendors but you could always sell to other players.
---
I can‚Äôt find any good laser rifles ;(
---
You can abandon the event to initiate PvP.
---
Seen it happen loads on Survival, not so much on Adventure.
---
It‚Äôs all good
---
Fallout 76 endgame itemization is not in a good state right now. Too much RNG, no feasible way to work toward specific items except mindless grinding. I've been grinding Cranberry Bog events for weeks because supposedly the Ultracite Gatling Laser plan can drop from those, but the chances are exceedingly low. 
---
Same with Whitesprings/West Tek legendary grinding. Too much randomness. I feel like Bethesda probably realized that just throwing RNG and incredibly low drop rates at problems isn't a solution, which is why I'm tentatively optimistic about what Hans Moleman the legendary vendor will do.
---
I only run Watoga now for magazines, bobbleheads, and the Emergency Medical Services building. They should have made it where legendary protectrons are hostile regardless of whether or not you completed the mayor quest. So instead of easy legendary pickings there's still a challenge, the other non-legendary robots would remain friendly et cetera.
---
What are the other stats on it?
---
Excavator PA + Lucky hole mine for lead.
---
Steel is so common that you might think it grows on trees.
---
Acid by farming snallygaster or just be careful to always loot these: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Acid#Fallout_76
---
Gunpowder from west tek or acid+cloth.
---
Always use super duper and ammo smith.
---
When i first read your title i believed you're having issues with storing all that ammo, not that you don't have enough of it...
---
yeah this was an old bug, it looks like its back ugh
---
You are talking about player position icon, while OP is talking about the markers you can put on the map. OP is correct, they are the same color.
---
I was able to finish it in about 8 hours, the challenge resets in 10-12 hours, be quick friend!
---
I kept popping in hoping Anthem would improve enough for me and a few friends to grab it on sale and jump in.
---
Or at least see promise of upcoming content.
---
So far the search continues,...back to West Virginia I go.
---
Forget legendary effects. Fully modded armor + perks should be more than enough for 90+% of this game. I‚Äôm not concerned about staying alive from point a to point b. I‚Äôm concerned about when point b doesn‚Äôt die in just a hit or two. Speed demon makes a difference here too
---
And a good portion of this game is getting charged by melee attackers, lets be real.   As for ranged there is really just colonel gutsy(ballistic) that will do a significant chunk of damage.
---
When you need the drastic damage reduction from the legendary effect it‚Äôs probably when something is going to take a while to kill. I mean I enjoy tanking the sheepsquatch. How‚Äôs that fight go your way? Do you sprint the queen to death?  
---
Also if your sentinels is powered, ap refresh, it makes for a huge combo with dodgy. You do understand, right?
---
Children will be children.
---
VTU Jacket and VTU cap. 
---
Maybe a Bomb Collar.
---
It‚Äôs not just sometimes. The sheer number of times everyone on their own sees a drill or syringer as the ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù loot is astounding. They must be the top two most common legendary drop.
---
Me: launches nuke, gets to site, gets booted from server, giggles.
---
I just want to return to the server I was on when I get DC'd and I'll be happy üëçüëç
---
Yeah, people keep saying it does less damage... that's why i even have the screenshots always ready.
---
Standard combat rifle stats with a bonus to stealth and sneaking move-speed while held.
---
I did mean vendors but hell if there is a player who wants me ammo lets do it haha.

---
Lol nice dude! Im friends with him too! Add me lol 
---
Trelmari-
---
Yesterday because it was so laggy the sheepsquatch never attacked me. I just walked up and whacked it to death with my death claw gauntlet. I guess lag can be good too. Apparently I could see him but he could not see me.
---
Happened to me after the Fasnacht update and had to do it all over again.
---
Forgot to say im on PS4, so no mods.
---
Thanks tho
---
You can buy the white pots at whitsprings and use the old rug trick. Just watched a YouTube video the other day on exactly this. Can't remember the guys name though. Some British fellow.
---
That‚Äôs interesting as I have an AA auto handmade rifle with all rifle perks, tank killer, piercing ammo, etc and I‚Äôve not encountered anyone yet I haven‚Äôt been able to knock down.  
---
Keep in mind w/speed demon and a 25 mag clip I can pump out a lot of lead and reload very quickly and my dmg goes almost 100 per shot.   And the long barrel setup w/scope allows me to fire w/plenty of accuracy from fair distance to avoid a melee or stagger gank.  
---
Love the handmade!
---
17 is such an arbitrary number; why not 15? 20? 25?
---
8:00 pm Eastern
---
Hmmm. I wonder what the actual stealth numbers are.
---
This locations also has some lead ore veins just south of the where you get on top of that ridge. About halfway to the friendly Gutsy in the woods
---
Shitty open letters and petty requests dont foster  worthwhile discussion.
---
It‚Äôs not for sale, but if I do sell it I‚Äôll come back to this post and let you know. üëç
---
It‚Äôs the same resource issues for fusion cores. Whether to farm with resource generators or grind for locations.
---
If steel really is an issue, then mine mole miners, or scrap lowbie weapons.
---
Requiring a smelter just adds another resource I don‚Äôt need to get steel.
---
Same.  90% of the time I take a drink and spam water, only to be hit with dysentery.
---
The Forest disease cures are the easiest to acquire, since everything can be found in large quantity in the same general area.  Travel to Flatwoods, equip Green Thumb perk and follow the river north collecting hundreds of snaptail and bloodleaf until you hit Gorge Junkyard.  From there, roam around the wooded area just east of the main road heading back down to Flatwoods, passing Slocum's Joe, Gauley Mine and the Overseer's Camp collecting the orange mushrooms that grow between the river and the train tracks.  After doing it a couple times, you'll learn the "hot spots" for the shrooms.  By the time you get back to Flatwoods, swap in Chemist and Super Duper, use the bench inside the church, and you've got enough disease cures to last for weeks.  A 30 minute endeavor at most.
---
Beats me
---
&gt;they have nerf'd uranium fever which was very popular, you now will never get a max level drop from the legendaries it's always 40/35
---
For what it's worth, this has always been the case. Mobs won't drop something that'a higher level then them, and since the mole miners are capped at 40 their loot is as well/
---
Same, I've even had the whole application crash once while fighting it.
---
Forgot to mention suppressor as well.  Couple that with stealth boy and it‚Äôs a pretty effective approach
---
I'm talking about MAP MARKERS not the dots on the map that show where other players are. Do you even know what a map marker is? And just for the record, I didn't down vote anyone. You do know that other people can also down vote on here right?  Also, I very accurately stated my issue when I asked that MAP MARKERS not all be the same colour.
---
You can make ammo. It's not that expensive with the right perks. Or just give up guns altogether.
---
I guess this is Bethedsa's late April Fools joke. Sorty, too far?
---
Speaking of which, I made a post earlier about the .50 cal receiver. Have you got the plans for one?
---
Done the event twice now and I think I'll pass from now on.
---
Gunpowder- acid and cloth for more gunpowder than you‚Äôll ever need
---
Lead- cans, mine lucky hole mine with excavator armor
---
Steel- scrap every enemy weapon
---
Infinite common ballistic ammo.
---
Trust me, I was well past 20p hours before I knew this. I'm about 400 hours now.
---
This is joyful :)
---
Who do I need to sacrifice for the Gods lf Lag to bless me? ;)
---
Thanks. I‚Äôve gone into a silo before got all the way to final launch prep and had them expire on me
---
Same thing happened I had to close the game and reopen it
---
The best legendary farming I've done recently was when we nuked the Sons of Dane compound during One Violent Night. Wave after wave of ghouls for 20+ minutes, and at least 20% of the were legendaries.
---
On a related note, they need to create/add level 50+ version of all the enemies. It's dumb completing that event and getting a level 40 from the Wendigo after spending 10 minutes smashing level 60 ghouls.
---
This would be good to know, I'm still dumping mine at Whitesprings Station suitcase.
---
Is your google broken?
---
THERE HAS BEEN NO LEGENDARY NERF.
---
Jesus Christ I wrote up an explanation of this not even a full day ago after people wouldn't stop whining about it.
---
The ONLY thing that has changed since the last patch is that Bethesda broke whatever makes sure a spontaneous legendary enemy gets MARKED as a legendary enemy after mutating.  All of the Legendary enemies you THINK have been removed from the game are still spawning JUST AS FREQUENTLY as before BUT they're just appearing names as normal enemies.
---
There have been NUMEROUS and FREQUENT references since the last patch of people getting legendary drops off of "normal" enemies and I myself can confirm that while farming Watoga EMS and clearing out all of the trash on the way to the boss for ammo and chems I have REPEATEDLY gotten legendary drops off of enemies that otherwise were not marked as Legendary.
---
The ONLY reason people think that spawn rates have been nerfed is because people are LAZY and simply vats scan an area for anything with Legendary in it's name and then move on or server hop.  ALL of the legendary spawns you would usually get are still there if you'd actually bother to kill anything that didn't have a star in it's name.
---
STOP crying that "Bethesda is evil and nerfed legendary spawn rates/drop rates/star ranks!".  If the shit people complained about every single god damn patch ACTUALLY happened then at this point you would only see a legendary enemy once every other week by now.
---
The encryptid is by far the more annoying one because the imposter always decides to focus me and just one shot me while I‚Äôm running around turning everything on.
---
Cool stort
---
My take on it - equally as frustrating during both events - more resource critical for the gun builds since they extend sooo many shells to defeat the boss. All those rounds need replaced afterwards and those who don‚Äôt participate/ contribute to the end goal should be banned from the event.
---
Uh, no. Level 1 raider armor with Sentinel's/Cavalier's depending on weapon being used will always be better than level 50 fully modded non-legendary BOS armor.
---
I'm just saying, why would you use Sentinel's with melee? You're literally never going to get any positive effects and expect to actually kill enemies efficiently.
---
I think you're just starting to realize why Sentinel's and melee is pretty counterintuitive, and you're just trying to justify your armor. You literalt went from saying you have an amazing combo to essentially saying "Who cares about legendaries?" But, whatever, dude.
---
And since when did we start talking about Powered? You're claiming that the Sentinel's and Powered combo is good with melee. Might as well just use Powered, it makes no difference.
---
I have seen it a few times. I like it and laugh everytime i see it.
---
Definitely. The only time my explosive cryolator comes out of storage is for SBQ runs, and it still does wonders on her.
---
That too because it's such a simple thing I dunno how it'd be impossible to implement that.
---
A weekly suggestion megathread that gets stickied is something a few other subs have done, and it should be here as well.
---
Considering every time my camps been destroyed there‚Äôs  always been a wanted group right next to it
---
I killed one of those in the mire area, instead of turning into a greasy pile like other mothmen that guy just laid flat on its belly, I took screenshot of it too.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the consideration.
---
The server gods. It was actually weird. Just walking up anticipating getting destroyed and being able to whack it into oblivion. Got my seventh or eight White Wolf Fedora.
---
I saw him for the first time the other day
---
Tons of legendary stuff needs buffs like this. People wouldn't get so mad if legendaries felt......legendary.
---
The last couple of events, I've been lagging out all the time. It's *literally* unplayable. I try to hit a pylon, tag the 'Squatch, jump on the shack, and take out the robots, but even that's only going so far at this point. I'm only doing the event for as long as it takes to collect all the outfits, then I'm calling it quits (I only need the Impostor Mask/Outfit, got the Mascot Outfit 3x instead. Fun!).
---
160ish hours and ive remade too many times. Level 24 again and enjoying it still. Im looking forward to the future!
---
Iam looking for the plan if anyone has 1
---
You‚Äôre not going to be allowed to sell ammo. If they‚Äôre nerfing hats because they‚Äôre selling for too many caps there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôre going to let you sell ammo for even 1 cap per bullet.
---
Encryptid, because it requires more caps to start if you by the card
---
Probably never
---
They should alter the imposters program to go after players who stand still to long with out attacking. Have it focus them down.
---
Either my hunter's coat with a gas mask and beanie. Or my traveler's leather coat with the assault hood mask
---
They probably should have edited the original post to make it clearer. Most people replying including myself didn't understand them. And they weren't pleasant at all in their two replies.
---
Sounds legit. xD
---
Yea that‚Äôs happened to me too. Says sheepsquatchs but was ghouls
---
I kill plenty of things at range w/my explosive shotgun.  Skeet shooter makes a difference but it‚Äôs the long barrel and scope setup that can make it decent at longer ranges. 
---
That being said, my AA handmade rifle takes distance shooting and accuracy to another level.
---
there is an event called Heart of the Swamp (I think?) which causes the pods to bloom
---
I found a bloom in broad daylight with no event going so I'm sceptical... though the event could easily have ended just before I landed on that server
---
If you have the PLANS for the mods they work fine. If you have only purchased mods from vendors but do not have plans, then the mods will not apply correctly. It is 100% consistent and a ridiculously annoying glitch. Do not tote that it is inconsistent as it is and should be fixed ASAP.
---
That I agree with 100%
---
That's a keeper for sure!
---
yeah, it only makes sense. all beverages while you're at it. im either forced to keep the station in the same place as my cooking station, or am forced to run up and down stairs.
---
Stash has been full for weeks.  Had my supply of freshly accumulated ultracite from down south - that's the only bit I really missed.
---
I hope someone at Bethesda sees this thread, it‚Äôs good to see that amongst all the haters of this game there‚Äôs also a lot of people who‚Äôs had really special experiences thanks to it. I still haven‚Äôt experienced something similar but it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not very confident speaking English, at least I try to drop items for lower level players when I‚Äôm around Flatwoods.
---
I've never seen plans for any 50 cal receivers. 
---
I always get mine from harper's ferry. 
---
Hasty seems the most common, refined/critical the next in rarity and the standard 50cal receiver seems to be the rarest of them all. 
---
Me never seeing receiver plans might also be because i rarely do events and the wikia says that's the source for such plans....
---
Yeah I've been messing around all morning trying to figure it out and as far as I can tell there is a delay of anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds in which the perks take effect- which is new. Hope this gets fixed when the fix the server stability issues
---
Lots of new weapons in survival mode.  The new lever is pretty solid.
---
Shit, with some perks I've gotten to 5900 DMG a few times. This was a few patches back. Since this latest one it's been at 4000
---
You can also find 100+ crystal at Lucky Hole.
---
Sweet, you on PC by chance and whats your IGN?
---
Yes... yes to all those things.
---
They sure can, if I had one I could make it work for me. 
---
It‚Äôs just weird take so many players have one. It‚Äôs been the case from day one. I just can‚Äôt believe how many people brought their gear over finding it in game.
---
Have been using a jetpack, spring traps, and bird bones to travel a bit, I really need to get some shots from up there. Can easily get from the Mire to Whitesprings or Watoga. Have another pointed more towards the Top of the World/toxic valley. You get a great view(like being in an airplane) and can find some new spots to explore. I let my character have a treat whenever I manage to land on a helipad or the top of something really really hard to reach.
---
There was mention of a utility item planned for the future called an ammo re-cycler, it was in the ITV edition that mentioned fridges and repair kits. From the name I would imagine we will eventually be able to turn 10mm into 5.56 etc but I doubt there will ever be the ability to sell it to vendors, maybe through player vending though ü§î
---
I could be wrong, or maybe it's just the locations I tend to frequent but, shotgun ammo is never a problem. Aside from that, and the obvious materials needed. Use super duper + ammo smith max ranks. I primarily use 5mm these days for important or higher lvl stuff, and shotgun for trash/caps runs/resource gathering. For 5mm you get 180 rounds per with ammo smith + a 30% chance at doubling that everytime with super duper. Eventually you'll be swimming in ammo. Last I checked I have over 5k 5mm, over 15k Ultracite 5mm, and 3k shotgun shells.
---
came to this thread hoping to see an answer to this, I've been wondering.
---
thanks
---
I did not give that a thought, approx. 2000 for a card would make it worse.
---
Workshop is fair game. Camp is not. if you are going after camps, you are a griefing neck-beard incel coward. Full stop.
---
And that is why he's suggesting CHANGING IT.  Go claim a workshop in Survival if you still want PVP kicks.
---
Four legitimate solutions to this problem that do NOT eliminate PVP are:
---
PVP doesn't activate until both sides have entered the workshop area (prevents distance killing)
---
Option to give up the workshop upon contestation or upon death and assignment to the contester (prevents multiple kills unless the defender wants to continue PVP)
---
Automatic loss of the workshop upon death and assignment to the contester (prevents multiple kills) 
---
The option to abandon a workshop when you're done with it (without server hopping)
---
I have a melee character that uses pistols as a backup ranged option, found a furious/limb damage laser, modded it to my liking, and I was less than impressed.  The damage is incredibly low, even with a sniper barrel, and the durability is just horrific.  The mutant's Western Revolver I was previously using is way slower, but one bullet is probably equal to 5-6 shots of the laser, even with the furious effect scaling it up.
---
I tried swapping into Guerilla perks, adding in an auto barrel and was similarly disappointed.  The dps is better, but the thing breaks after a couple reloads, even when repaired to 200%.
---
They really, really need to give lasers a hard buff, at least the rifle and pistol versions.  I have no experience with heavy lasers.  My opinion is that there is absolutely no reason to use a laser pistol when even a .44 revolver is way, way better.
---
im trying to say that it is childish and they will not be ending up putting it since it is a waste of time for bethesda
---
I'll check Harper's ferry. I've been receiving mixed signals about whether I should go for the refined, or the basic receiver.
---
&gt; I don't even like doing cheap levels by nuking over there.
---
They also nerfed the XP from the ghouls,from 400+ down to ~100, so you can't even effectively power level there any mroe.
---
To those talking about a megathread. Counter offer open up a new F76 subreddit just for those. That way everything is seperated in a coherent manner and we can see other stuff. Or make a flair for it then we can unsee posts with that flair.
---
If you are on ps4 I can sell 30 fusion core for around 1500 caps. If you are interested my psn name is hunter91603
---
The only thing breakable at camp should be turrets/defenses and doors. If a wanted player tries hiding you can break the door and disable the guns. That's it.
---
Oh yeah that whole area is worth a trip in Excavator for sure. 
---
And spend some time with the dog, he seems so lonely.
---
I think it may stay running until the server resets.
---
THinking this b/c (at least with posiedon) when I first started playing, there are many times I went there, plant was running, defenses still up, the workbench was listed as unowned....and the processor was still outputting cores.
---
Beth may have changed that at some point - same cenario, but no cores in the processor, no matter how long I waited.  
---
When I claimed the workbench, I started getting cores. 
---
   As long as I survived the "defend from..." waves,  the longest I kept the workbench was about 3-1/2 hours.   In that time frame, nothing needed repair except defenses.  
---
Last couple times I've been by, the plant was running, workbench unowned, defenses set up, but the previous claimant had put high concrete walls all around the fusion core processor; lacking marsupial, could not get on top to check for cores.
---
Xbox, going to PC shortly though...
---
You tried and it's appreciated :) Long story short it turns out my ISP suspended my account without notification.  It's all sorted now but what a paaaaaaain XD
---
People seem to have this thing where they believe that Bethesda is intentionally doing this. The fact of the matter is that you are just getting bad rng. In the entire map creatures have a specific chance to spawn as legendary. Enemies Between level 0 and 10 its a 1% chance, 11 and 20 is 2%, 21 and 30 is 3%, 31 and 40 is 4%, and 40+ is 5%. Nuke zones double each of those chances. Everything else is based on rng.
---
I will glady support any child eater let's do this
---
I suppose at least its better than the whole "Thank you Bethesda" posts there used to be on here with people thanking a multi-billion dollar games company for fixing some bugs they should have fixed before release.
---
I‚Äôve only seen maybe 3 since beta
---
As soon as people realized that they take a peek here or there, people have been posting that shit nonstop. It sucks too, because if there was an actually well-thought-out suggestion, it would get buried and thrown into the same dump of ‚Äòplease add more rain‚Äô or ‚Äòplease let me sit on the toilet‚Äô type of ‚ÄúBeth please‚Äù posts.
---
that has to be a bug, I dont see why they would time the nukashine thing it never seemed like a event rather then just additional content. The parade on the other hand makes sense as a event.
---
that would actually be so awesome
---
Just some advise for another heavy Gunner. Put your camp on an acid node. Use excavator PA in luck hole mine. And scrap all weapons you find for plans steel. 
---
Yesterday in one 30min run of lucky hole mine walked out with 200 lead ore. 670 steal scrap. And since I camp an acid node I'm set for 3 to 4 queen fights useing my 2 50 Cal's.
---
Just a note. I usually server hope the mine a few times till I'm over weight and then break stuff down. Also I bulk all my lead/steel/acid.
---
Currently have 50 bulked lead and 45 bulk steel and sitting on 120 bulk acid. I should be good for this week.
---
Interestingly, I've seen an increase in decent legendary drops from the SBQ lately.  Three explosive weapons in the past five SBQ's between me and two buddies I often kill her with.  And that's in addition to the multiple Jet Pack plans she's been dropping.  Very interesting to see the loot tables changing, and I'm sure we'll continue to see changes.  Keep your hopes up, and remember that you don't need legendary weapons, especially not top tier legendaries to play the game, have fun, and make a difference in the big battles.
---
It happens to me and I'm on PC and have no mods.  (Never had any mods.)
---
You still looking man?
---
well its just like the fermenter it adds the weight to storage
---
Or the I-35W bridge in St. Paul
---
Maybe the dumbasses were incredibly bad shots.  I was taking weapons fire way before the crews of Mr. Gutsies started showing up.
---
Might look good on an M79 too.
---
I have about 1500 I am willing to sell for 1 cap a piece my psn name is hunter91603
---
How do you know? Do you work for Bethesda? I didnt think so. Everyone is allowed a wish, fulfilled or not. You dont need to make a point of raining on others dreams.
---
Yeah, plus the mat for crafting it including some flux so you have to farm a nuke zone so you with have to find a nuke zone or make one meaning you have to go through the same nuke process as the queen
---
I don't. I was overpowered by a pack of high level ghouls and that's how I got my mutant powers and I used that to escape. Now I'm trying to level up fast so I can get the starched gene perk so I can keep my powers. I love it.
---
Refined: https://i.imgur.com/lIPMv8E.jpg
---
Basic: https://i.imgur.com/YYTvame.jpg
---
I do think it's a bug and the damage values are reversed, but anyway, 2 points in damage is negligible so go for the one you are lucky enough to get.
---
What's also a real problem is how many players never keep themselves up to date with what's going on with the game. Because you would know they said they are going have some way to convert ammo added to the game.
---
If a large portion of these post are requesting the same features, it probably means more people care about those things lol.  There are a lot of FO76 players who like full immersion and building their character visually.  It would be pretty funny if two different teams in Bethsda work on these request.  Atomic shop/ buildables vs game dynamics.  So putting one over the other in order of importance might be pointless lol.i do agree about a lot of the Nerfed guns &amp; launchers though.
---
That would help. Or make them pulse or blink.  Something. I struggle to scroll around the map to find them every time.
---
um.. bethesda dosent have time for that
---
One thing to note, if I am the conduit and die, let me bleed out. I can stay the conduit for the remainder of the timer before I respawn. I do this often for the greater good. If you stim me, I usually die immediately and respawn.
---
Bethesda, please remove prinsessanna‚Äôs post.
---
Helvetia happens once a year, you can brew alcohol any time!
---
4 of my 5 attempts ended this way...
---
I do this as well, and I leave a little extra room for indoor water purifiers.
---
That will work!! Apparently the new cameras will be out by then!
---
I‚Äôm on PS4‚Ä¶
---
no its childish and if bethesda researches there revenue for this they will not gain that much
---
I see all that, but in the new staircase they added.
---
Witch costume and patrol man sunglasses, only as my characters eyes look hideous.
---
Assassins is only +10% when pvp isn‚Äôt it? Two-shot is about +20%, Furious can reach +50% in follow up shots. Bloodied is like constant +50% when your health is low enough. All those options are more powerful than assassin alone. They should really buff assassin‚Äôs legendary effect to make it worthwhile.
---
It fits with the theme of "sightings" and it really being something else.
---
What is this, December 2018?
---
That isnt a glitch. Its intentional, like if someone said they say sasquatch but when the hunter gets there its just a bear that stood on its hind legs for a few seconds. Ive had it happen a couple times now.
---
100% agree on this
---
It seems like it's always 3 time for me. He'll mutter 2 lines of random bullshit, and then say something like "has it been a day already?" and the event notice will pop up.
---
I've found some info
---
It seems like it works like this
---
Say you have a piece that gives you 50% chance to heal at 20% health right? And you have a full set of 5, it wouldn't add to a 250% chance but rather, you'd get 5 chances at 50%
---
It works the same for the other effect I asked about the self revive one
---
Yes, that's quite true! And it did make me curious enough to actually revisit my abandoned workshop.
---
Sorry, didn't read the Cliff Notes about the Encryptid event.  That's why I  showed up "alone."  Big mistake, eh?
---
They should add a drying rack that is placeable in your camp that you can put meat on
---
Valid question, I don‚Äôt even look in these containers anymore. Is it always money? I don‚Äôt think I even find ammo in them.
---
Good.I gonna join in hour/two
---
Interesting
---
The community is rather split right now.  There's the P2W purists, who think that anything non-cosmetic is evil no matter what amount of benefit there is.  And then there's the non-purists who don't care as long as they can play the game without buying the items as long as there isn't a *significant* benefit to buying items.  
---
(There's a few people floating around who don't care if the whole thing goes P2W, but they mostly stay out of it because they'll get downvoted to hell)
---
The contention is the 'slippery slope' idea, that once they start selling little things, they'll start selling big things too.
---
By the way, you do get atoms from playing, but there is a finite amount you can get without effort specifically to get them.  At ~300 hours, I've gotten maybe 5000 total, without going in every day and looking for the challenges to complete.  If you're spending them on skins and other cosmetics, you'll probably have a great deal less than that.  If you're spending all your atoms on cosmetics, and you now want the other things, you'll have to either devote hours a week to farming, or spend money.
---
What we need is an ability to bulk ammo for it to become valuable to the vendors. Just like we do with some junk.
---
I get what you mean but you complaining about the complaining isn't new and kinda the same thing lol
---
thank you
---
no  but i do know how bethesda works and are very close to bankruptcy so making this will not really work for bethesda anyways you better put this in r/ChoosingBeggars they will give you a better opinion
---
my only gripe with the repair kits in general is the atom store is suppose to be COSMETIC ONLY to say repair kits doesn't go against that is to be dishonest with yourself.
---
I‚Äôm stuck in the past
---
I'd rather it be late and functional than thrown together, randomly take 3\* pieces and not count them, crash the server when trading in too many at a time, or eat your anti-armor/explosive rifle when you try to add a third effect to it.  I would lose my mind.
---
No you still can't hurt people who are in the event. Who started this rumor?
---
Yeah so it's like getting extra Dice rolls instead of adding the numbers together on those pieces
---
I honestly kinda hope there isnt a real sheepsquatch. Am I the only one that finds it kinda silly that there are all these pre-war cryptids that suddenly have emerged after the bombs dropped?
---
Go spread your negativity somewhere else troll.
---
Way to comment on a thread from 4 months ago just to show everyone how selfish you are. Such a champ.
---
Uh, yeah, as I said the game reminded me they existed? Otherwise I had zero use for them.
---
No, you can server hop.
---
It‚Äôs risky. I accidentally cured mutations taking Radaway Diluted with the Pharmacist perk on and had to re-do all my mutations. Had Starched Genes permanently on ever since.
---
That's just random. It's not an anti-exploit.
---
No, it wasn't.

"Franklin BBQ comes to WV"
---
Mods are broken.  Will have to wait for fix hopefully tomorrow.
---
Im having the same issue.  This is now a known issue on all platforms.  They will probably patch it tomorrow
---
My experience is that I find far fewer legendaries on random enemies, but a great many more on enemies in events. And better ones in events. 
---
Even the Defend Workshop quests seem to have about a 50% chance to spawn a 2-3* at least once. 
---
So maybe stop farming random spawns and start doing events?
---
Np. Good luck :)
---
Bethesda has specifically asked for that type of feedback and this subreddit is one of the main places they look for it. If you're sick of those posts, that's what /r/fo76FilthyCasuals is for.
---
Elevated works.  In the last two months I've only had to repair a neon sign and to kill one scorched that got inside my bunker that holds my junk extractor.
---
Having the generator elevated helps a lot as they seem drawn to it.

---
I really hope that Beth reads this post bcuz any new PA skins will sell quickly like how I bet Excavator PA did and if they ever allow us to give armor/PA custom paint jobs it'll be golden
---
I'm tired of just about all of the 76 posts complaining, praising, making wishlists, comparing it to No Mans Sky or telling us what should be in the next game. The game was released what 6 months ago? Will it be another 6 months before the amount of posts slow down to more than every 15 minutes?
---
We get it, enough is enough.
---
I'm a melee build - I keep an (executioners) combat rifle around for such purposes.
---
Served me well so far - I've taken down 4 SBs with a combination of the Executioners Combat rifle 
---
and either
---
bravery or stupiity - not sure which - when the SB lands, I go in with a (non-legendary) cultist dagger and get a bunch of hits....
---
Have also take out a couple cargobots with the same rifle - scored my first nuke key card this weekend.
---
I think it's funny that it says removed yet  I keep getting comments in it.
---
YES!!!! shut up you whinging snowflakes. ,:)
---
It is insane. I was roleplaying as a union soldier with just blackpowder weapons. I specced fully into rifles. I love them still, but they just can't beat heavy weapons. The BE harpoon is at 1200 damage, has flechetes so it's a shotgun, the ammo dupes on enemies hit by it OR the explosion including dead bodies, it reloads faster than black powder, has more durability, has a long range scope, and unlimited range practically. The blackpowder is slow to reload, 1300 damage, and only gets a bayonet that does barely any damage.
---
can you elaborate the 2000 caps part? Don't know what are you referring to
---
Alright awesome thank you all so much :)
---
I thought it would probably be a known issue but wanted to make sure.
---
You know if you don't pull the trigger you'll reload the whole thing...
---
What platform are you on?
---
iv used a few pistols and i have a tse laser rifle  with the beam splitter mod on the laser it fires 4 shots in one..it is definitely op..kills lvl 68 scorched in one shot..i guess the nonexplosive laser pistol/riflles arent too good but wair till u use a tse laser rifle..they are awesome. they do break fasr but last a lot longer than they used to.
---
I suppose yeah, I never really have a shortage of stuff to sell though, it's so easy to max out on the 1400 cap vendor limit.
---
That is a cool idea
---
Thank you for your comments, gents!
---
Makes sense to be with all them legendary enemies
---
If you were on ps4 I could just give you a hasty .50 mod .
---
You're not going to be able to fight this self perpetuating circle jerk.  People believe they're entitled to god rolled legendary weapons and gear and since they can't get that of course it's part of Bethesda's master plan to for some reason make this game more worse and get people to stop playing.
---
This guy had his head far enough up his ass that he complained about Uranium Fever being nerfed to not drop level 50 gear and then had to rush in and change it when people pointed out it had NEVER dropped gear that high level.
---
You are very incorrect in this. Stop spreading misinformation.

You sure its only double?  My full set of excavator pulls 4 ore each harvest.  Some spots in Lucky Hole mine will give 16 - 20 a spot.

Acid is my biggest issue....got all the ore and no way to smelt it.

Great stuff

Thanks anyway

Lucky for you it was not me I would of recognized your "Bounty Baiting" tactics. Depending on where your friend was located I would of bludgeoned him to death and then waited for you to pounce upon your prey but little would you know I was waiting for your attack. When you ask me why I would reply because I am the Joker.

( All this would of happened in slow motion with lots of background explosions)

So much more fun over there, I don't even know why I come to this unmoderated mess.

Np
---
For me it was like night and day.
---
Full disclosure: although in hindsight it should have been glaringly obvious I didn't have a moment of clarity 'by myself', I just took advice from another fellow player that posted about it in this sub.
---
For like a few hours, perhaps, but then they stopped paying attention.
---
If you kill molemen or deathclaws you get black titanium as loot or from scraping the loot
---
Oh sorry man that is sold
---
They have been "fixed" for a long time. You can use as many serums as possible (except for combinations like Herbivore and Carnivore together etc.). I've have created at least 3 new characters since it was fixed and chugged down a dozen serums at one time with all three characters.  
---
To stabilize your mutations though requires avoiding radiation and/or healing radiation or you can just equip level 2 Class Freak.
---
&gt;random bullshit

You shut your whore mouth! Biv is the best!! :)

That's the coolest story OP. I love it. I was trying to toss around in my head why he'd be so drawn to fallout but he lived it basically. He was around in the time of anticommunism which was a plague of paranoia across America leading to a lot of what's depicted in fallout, like the Patriotic propaganda, the sing-songy cartoonish ads and warnings. Just watched a civil defense video from the ~50s-60s of a turtle singing to students about what to do when they see "the flash". Being a very serious topic but conveyed with children's cartoons, you get this eerie emotion. And I think that's what fallout does best, basically an alternate timeline commentary that he must understand and enjoy immensely. I'm personally glad we can at fallout instead of taking the historical path in the cold war that coulda led to that being a reality. He's probably grateful too, as I'm sure it's something that worried him at some point as it did many.
---
&gt;p on those sweet, sweet White Wolf Fedoras.

&gt;Fuck th

It's really insane.  The loot drops have been getting steadily worse in this game, Bethesda has been repeatedly called on it, and THIS is their response. I mean... wow.
---
Lol I guess I was some people say since it was emptied others say since you first interact guess I just have been starting it later and later every day. A set time every day would be best for people like me. But the way it is now I guess gives and advantage to those more vigilant players.

My friends quit because there‚Äôs no end game unless you like to role play
---
*event completion intensifies*
---
Review bomb: Overrun with too many hostile  super mutants. Frequent need to server hop to get the plans you need. On the bright side the Brotherhood of Steel recently did major renovations of the sewer system.
---
Yeah, very.
---
I'm also pretty tired of the "Anyone else tired of [x]" posts.
---
Tbf, there's almost never anything new or interesting or creative posted here.
---
Nice.
---
not a troll and this is the internet you better learn to deal with this stuff
---
I made two loops of white spings yesterday and ended up with over 25 legendary items including 4 different guns that would be viable primary weapons...but the armor is always crap.
---
That's a really good one
---
I'm saying the whole thing is the player vending platform, not just the soda machine part. Everything you see there is one piece that you place down.
---
It's never been easy to do the rug trick, but it's still there.  I don't think it got harder, but I've always build on non-level ground and always had issues with it.
---
It definitely works better on flag ground, and there are some limits on how close together the crops can be...on a small rug, at beast I can get 2 crops on one rug, I've done 3 but that's rare and not worth the time.  For big models like razorgrain, 1 per rug is as much as you should try for.
---
I rebuilt my camp this weekend (twice, don't ask :P ), and was able to put corn, carrots, tatos, and razorgrain on the roof of my camp on mats.  And my Bromin as well, though he tends to wander around a lot...he's been hanging out around my weapons bench a lot lately, which has me worried...
---
I switched completely. Its great having primary weapons weigh less than 3 pounds each, and hold a lot of ammo. I probably have 6 heavy guns, compared to the weight of 1 Handmade.
---
I name guns after the people who give them to me :)

"My mods aren't working - is anyone else getting this bug?"

This kind of thing which has stopped from trying.  However, I‚Äôve been doing my research and read on here how it should be done.

So today was my first attempt at the sheepquatch....now I‚Äôm not saying that I‚Äôm some god tier player, I know for a fact I ain‚Äôt - I‚Äôm actually pretty sh1te.

Maybe about 6 other players turned up and at least 2 of em new exactly what they were meant to be be doing with the pylons.  My health got quite low a couple of times but I just kept my eye on the top left of the screen to tell me when the ‚Äúquatch‚Äù was vulnerable.  Managed to get some pretty hard hits on it and took some good chunks out of it.  Finally nailed it and got some useless loot :(
---
I think it‚Äôs pretty safe to say that the key to the quest is teamwork.  Hiding in the shed or running round doing nothing other than picking up other peeps drop bags ain‚Äôt the best way to complete it.
---
honestly it really sucks because im a dataminer and i only try to get the information out to people. i think people should know how the game actually works since its already such a buggy mess.
---
I'm thinking its for the upcoming Repair Kits.
---
I'd be happy if we could just break it down, even at half the value.
---
Counterpoint: this is rebalancing BECAUSE of the legendary vendor. Consider this: right now a god roll is like a 1-10,000 chance (I‚Äôm not talking a *specific* god roll). You need a lot of chances to get one. 
---
Now, we don‚Äôt know exactly how the legendary vendor will work, but if it essentially allows us to trade in any legendary to then point-buy a specific legendary, well, now you only need 10? 20? 30? Drops to then just ‚Äúbuy‚Äù the exact god roll you‚Äôre looking for. So they want far fewer legendaries floating around, to balance that. 
---
I do agree that all of these unannounced tweaks, especially before the vendor goes live, isn‚Äôt cool.
---
Those bears all over fill me with joy.
---
Considering the time it takes to activate them, versus crouching... 
---
Use both. If perks can't hide you, the stealthboy will.
---
If you don't have the time (fave wheel bug, etc), turn a corner and crouch.
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
I'd love to have this feature when they implement player vending. I've been collecting clothes to sell, and it would be awesome to display some of them around my shop!
---
You‚Äôre the first person I‚Äôve seen to actually say what I‚Äôve been kinda expecting to be true. I‚Äôve been on a mission to get bright headlamps on everything and couldn‚Äôt find one for the excavator no matter how hard I tried.
---
Did the event three times.  First was successful, second this exact thing happened and I was stuck at the loading screen as it tried to re-spawn me (I could hear the pylon noise), and the third I died and during re-spawning it crashed to main menu.  :(  Since patch 7 I haven't had a single crash until this happened.
---
If you go to a pool of water and just mash the collect button you can get a ton of dirty water super fast. Not sure if everyone know that or not. Not a solution, but does make things a bit faster. 
---
I do wish clean water would work as boiled water, it‚Äôs more valuable so it won‚Äôt mess with economy at all.
---
Simple solution that ive done on two encryptid events, bring the "sheepsquach" into the hut when it starts following you.....voila hiding players no more
---
Haha, that would be an interesting tactic to watch in action. I would circle mine with nuke mines.
---
I'm saddened to say I've done this. However, I usually wait until the event has been over for a couple mins then I search around for some bags. I know its sleazy but most of them are not going to be picked up by the owner. The amount of times u die doing this event most ppl dont even know that they should he looking for their bag. Like the other comments said, dont bring 100lbs of junk to the event and you wont have this problem :)
---
Are you getting warning pop ups that your camp is under attack?
---
Nice, love the tree. :)
---
Lol hiding
---
Bethesda please take care of all the bethesda please posts
---
This. Use crouching for those "oh sh\*t" moments, and stealth boys and phantom devices for when you go in hot.
---
Fire in the hole already increases grenade speed.
---
&gt;I don't know why the "Known issues" isn't still stickied...
---
Only two stickied posts are allowed, and currently it's last weeks Patch Notes (those always get stickied) and the megathread the was stickied when they sub was flooded with posts about the repair kids (necessary at the time because god damn was this place a shitshow).
---
Visibility and sneak are two different mechanics. Stealthboy, besides giving you visual camouflage, increases your sneak somehow, but enemies might still notice you, and how easily they notice you depends on your sneak.
---
I have a character that has like 3 times the "harder to detect while sneaking" in his armor, around 30 agility, and sneak/escape artist perks. Without stealthboys, I can walk into a monster and they will fail to notice me while I'm obstructing their paths.
---
Theres also perception against sneak PvP check that defines red dot visibility rules.
---
As a fairly lower level (L46) i also find this madding. I may not being much punch with my shitty weapons but I give it a good old try and help revive players ect. I dont understand why they don't help even with just a melee weapon if they need to save ammo annoying a fuck but thats online gaming for u
---
Doesn't that then make you wanted?
---
correct, i prefer single shot
---
Yeah there is, it‚Äôs the route you take thru the vendors. 10 bf for 300 caps, cheap and at 300 or less caps it sure beats ruining around looking for ammo bags and tape.
---
So, exactly how is that different than the comment threads of posts?
---
First time playing a Bethesda game?
---
Frat Party poster was limited Time, same as Sheepsquatch.
---
VT safety posters are from an Overseers Cache, Tricentennial posters are from Tricen Edition/Upgrade.
---
Uh, the advertising ones can drop from Workshops, Random Spawns or Vendors.
---
Did I miss any?
---
Another easy spot is across the river from the Overseer's CAMP. And you wont get attacked by molerats or dogs.
---
 No, If I'm taking a workshop, it's for a challenge. They're useless, I don't need them.
---
If you want it, take it, but leave me the fuck alone.
---
Hey bud!  I am on PC too and would love to explore with someone who doesn‚Äôt rush through. Look up ansidrop online. Would love some friends that still play!  Lvl 61 casual.
---
Honestly, I have so much crap now that the last thing I need is another mess of steel or rubber. Unless they are carrying stable flux or ballistic fiber, it's staying where it's at. 
---
As noted below this makes for an awesome lure in any event. Kill them, go camp the bag and wait for them to come back for it and snipe or backstab them.
---
Wisdom ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
You're right, I completely forgot that perk existed.
---
At least you wait for the owners to leave this guy or gal was literally watching the Players die then picking up the bags.
---
Any post beginning with "Dear bethesda" is annoying as fuck.
---
Nice! I've been waiting for a while to find the time to grind for the key codes (final year of university doesn't lend itself well to my FO76 cravings) and to spend a few hours in the nuke zone afterwards. I know you can get the codes online each week, but I want my first time to be hard-earned!
---
My arch nemesis
---
I'm 52 , a genuine Atari generation kid...  
---
I loved games back in the days and still enjoying them 
---
It was 2 years ago I played any video  games until fallout 76.... 
---
I think my wife does not know I still live in the house.  .ü§£ü§£. 
---
Remember ,all you young folks, one day you will be 52 and some teenage wizz-kid will help you around in Fallout ' the next generation while in the meantime your wife or husband will not understand why gaming is such fun ...
---
Thanks to all of you for making this the best game ever...
---
&gt;Each topic needs its own thread so we can have coherent discussion, not chaos.
---
So, exactly how is that different than the comment threads in posts?
---
If you require all top-level comments to be a suggestion/request, and all discussion about each suggestion/request to occur underneath that comment, it's really no different than a post. Except it doesn't clutter up the subreddit with repeat suggestions/requests and gives Bethesda's employees a one-stop-shop to see what people are asking for and how popular a specific request is.
---
nah, I had a post one of the redditors didn't and even though it broke no rules, they squealed to a mod about my post and had it deleted. When I said it broke no rules I was banned. Not the kind of place I want to participate in. The rules are all in such a grey area that the mods just ban anyone who doesn't suck them.
---
yeah I'm tired of the posts, but a lot of those posts exist because Bethesda needs to do a better job of anticipating our needs when it comes to their games. Reddit is a good place for feedback and it's better than their forums because of the attention upvotes and comments bring to an issue or a request
---
A scorched one at the SBQ nuke zone seems like the best bet
---
That's not really how this works.
---
First of all, not "everyone" needs to feel the same way for something to be a problem, just a majority.
---
Second, just because people are doing it doesn't mean they thing the rewards are any good. It's brand new content, of course people are doing it. I'm sure most of them would agree that the rewards are shit.
---
You should check out r/fo76bearhunt
---
Gotta sell those fucking repair kits, eh?
---
isn't that a moderator issue though? if there are duplicate asks then mods should be on that
---
&gt;that would be an interesting tactic to watch in action
---
Happens all the time in survival. I'll watch the kill feed and if a lot of people get killed I look for the bags on the map then fast travel and wait near them
---
in order to trigger the main part of the event again in case yo uwant to farm it, you gotta buy something that costs around 2k at the vendor and cannot be obtained any other way
---
Thanks for this. I was wondering if I could help by bring the conduit even if I might die easier.
---
I've kept a combat rifle or two around myself for such things too, nothing more than the standard however. Sure it works, but I still say we grenades would be a nice alternative just so I can run a more "melee purist" style without sacrificing all range.
---
I can't believe ppl r freaking out about these repair kits??? The game is already ptw. For $15 you can buy all the mutation serums online, you can buy god-tier duped weapons and armour, modded pa sets, ammo, you name it. Duping has destroyed the game in every way. It has made survival mode practically unplayable for the average player. It has inflated the value of many items. The games already pay to win who cares about repair kits?
---
I get that people have suggestions and ideas but it gets real fucking old when all you ever see are ‚ÄúBeThEsDa PlEaSe‚Äù threads.  Especially when a duplicate thread is made a day or two later.
---
Why not add a single thread that is stickied dedicated to suggestions and ideas for the game?  I am sure it would help the Community Managers a bit because everything is pooled into a single thread.  
---
And maybe it is just me but I would rather see new weapons and content than some fucking pictures in my CAMP.
---
Lucky you. The only 72 year old Vietnam vet I know is my racist neighbor, and listening to HIM talk makes me rage.
---
Yeah I don't need to sell ammo, but please just let me scrap it for gunpowder and lead.
---
Its a known bug since the update many people cant use mods without learning them If xou are on Pc I can maybe help you :/
---
I'm never wasting flux on crafting fusion cores, way to valuable for that.
---
Text based DND games. By chance did you play MUDs?  Medievia?  I lost a lot of time mudding!
---
Ritual mask and straight jacket, I also get a huge bounty and make large mazes, and when people come to collect they go in but they don‚Äôt come out, and when they start wrecking the walls I just log out, base disappears and they fall in to the deathclaws waiting under the base.
---
I'd rather they make the game super stable and fix existing bugs before adding in more.  You can't build a quality house on a shitty foundation.  I'm all for fun and fancy things, but some fundamental aspects of the game can still use some shoring up.  I mean, my sniper *still* randomly goes into perma-danger that requires a quit to main menu to fix.  Incredibly annoying when it happens midway through a place like West Tek or Whitespring and my DPS is cut by more than half.  Fast travel to camp \[danger\].  Inside the bunker \[danger\].  Inside the Whitespring Hotel \[danger\].
---
I don't run a melee build so it doesn't help either way lol
---
That fight is a nightmare :(
---
This dude was super nice and honestly he was an open book but he took interest in the things I was saying and he seemed like he really just wanted someone to sit and BS with.
---
&gt;lv. 40 from a 3 star...
---
um... you know the level of the legendary drop is always based on the enemy level right? If it's a lv15 3 star legendary, you're going to get a lv 10-15 legendary drop...
---
You say it in your post as if you're not aware that's how it works.
---
&gt;You can also be able to catch hackers easily if they reach this limit rather quickly.
---
How does earning money quickly make someone a "hacker", and why would you even suggest such a thing? I made over 20k the other day after unloading some stuff to other players, and I would be fucking pissed if I got banned for it.
---
Love these suggestions! For fun (&amp; evil), I'd change the "Charitably Chaotic" one to be a 25% chance you blow yourself up. &gt;:D
---
(okay, maybe 10%)
---
Yelling the exact same words over and over again at people and screaming that they're wrong without attempting to clarify isn't serving you any purpose other than to garner down-votes.
---
Thanks to u/fnix_no, we actually have some idea what on earth you're talking about.
---
Since you opted to be condescending toward people who were trying to be helpful and just understand what the hell you were talking about, 'Map Markers' is also a reasonable generalized term for literally every single UI icon that appears on the map.  This observation is also backed up by the resounding consensus within this thread that everyone thought you were talking about the player dots.
---
If you want help from people, then try actually being helpful instead of repeating the same nonsense over and over again and going after people who are trying to understand and help you out.
---
And yeah, they should probably change the color on the player map pins.  For that to make sense, they would also have to recolor the teammates individually to match their pins.
---
*Left 4 Dead flashbacks intensify*
---
Try /r/elitedangerous sometime. :)
---
I love my lvl 50 fixer with automatic receiver.
---
Are you camping at the junk pile above the elevator (with the buildable pylon)?  I'm near there and I've never seen anyone griefed there.  I've seen camps there damaged by wildlife, but not by people.
---
Or are you camping close enough to the pile that others that have that spot can't place their camps?  If so, there is plenty of clifftop there heading south, and if you build a little way down it will eliminate that problem.
---
Finally a good fucking suggestion, fucking a.
---
Where even can you find coal? I got a few pieces ONCE in a couple different mines but that's just such a small amount (and I've played enough to get to like level 140).
---
I also forgot, enclave events don‚Äôt count  and neither do defend workshop events.
---
The jet packs dropping are neat , I got t 45 51 and 60 jet packs all back to back Saturday. I would have liked to see some more ultracite mods drop. They need to remove the chest arms and legs plans from the loot pool , anyone can learn them all at once for free on the terminal in fort defiance . This would be a great place to add ultracite emergency protocols, and calibrated shocks.
---
This is the thing, it's super inconsistent and seemingly random
---
How about:
---
"I don't like the new repair function!"
---
"I can't see the durability once I get into the new repair screen!"
---
"I never get 3* legendaries from my legendary grind sessions!"
---
Like, I get it. These are problems. But maybe comment on one of the other hundred of posts to this same stuff? A single post with 3k upvotes and comments will probably raise more awareness than 3k posts with 1 comment.
---
This was just purchased.
---
Oh no, it's really been a shitshow and there's no denying that honestly. But it's also got plenty of potential if Bethesda stops screwing it up.
---
Someone else asked about the advertising poster set a couple of months ago, and got a myriad of random answers, meaning that they probably are just a totally random reward/purchasable. Some said Whitespring vendors, others like me got them from claiming/defending different workshops. I got them at the Gorge workshop, but again, it's rng.
---
I briefly got into MUDs during college, starting with my first semester living in a dorm with a bunch of engineering and science majors.  They were fun for sure.
---
I might buy some of the others, but I need violet to make ammo.
---
That would be useful. Like very useful. I'm not good at texture modding otherwise I would know what you did but I am good at making actual mods
---
You dont. There's absolutly nothing preventing you from always having the perk active.
---
All I want.
---
LOL, agreed. :D
---
Equip sun kissed, stand in dirty water and collect till over carry weight then boil. Usually keep like 150+ in my stash.
---
Just please don't place it west of the Overseer's CAMP (across the street and toward Flatwoods) because you'll interfere with the random event spawn point near the concrete node/pickup truck.
---
I would have no issue with additional CAMP budget/space, as long as it didn‚Äôt apply to defenses. A second CAMP would be a distinct advantage though.
---
Might buy some of the others, but I need violet for crafting ammo.
---
Bloodied gear, I think damage goes up proportionately the lower your health is. The lower your health the higher the damage. 
---
Please advise if mistaken.
---
Ive been trying for months to get a paint other than initiate. but so far I got initiate twice and after the 2nd one, I havent got any other paint. and now the usual farming spots have been picked clean for 2 weeks straight ):
---
Plus, the version made with purified water should have a lower rad count.
---
The Freddy fear bear should be in the front with a megaphone!
---
I'm talking about the map marker, not the player icon/dots that show where other players are. The map markers are all the same colour on the map as well as on the compass. I do a lot of running in this game and at times it can be hard to stay on track without having to constantly check the map to see if it's your own marker or a team mates that you're following.
---
I've still run into max-level 3 stars in WS, though I haven't been farming there much since the patch.  Watoga I *haven't* seen any outside, though my sample size is too small to matter.
---
But both seem to have a lot more low-level mobs these days, not sure if it's a change to the spawn or if more low level alts are heading there (I see a lot more in WS than before for sure, haven't noticed them at Watoga yet).
---
You can. Sometimes you do get immediately respawned, but that seems to be only 30 percent of the time. I know it works because I can still look and see the green lights on the towers I started. Doing my best Spock impression.
---
I just don't understand why we can't substitute purified water for boiled water for crafting
---
You should also get the energy ammo one. Cuts down the weight of fusion cores
---
I seen the cats fresh out of the vault during beta. Sadly, I murdered them, lol. Haven't seen them since.
---
You actually did a little overkill, but thanks.
---
It's not just you. I run a regular route to farm cap stashes and some locations are missing since the last patch, and some seem to spawn like one out of 5 times I visit the location they should be. I've also noticed the amount you get from each stash is getting lower; I would routinely get 30-60 caps from most, and now they are in the 10-30 range most often. When you get one above 50 it's a rarity indeed.
---
It sounds like your real complaint is with the subreddit mods. They need to remove duplicates. That's the real problem.
---
Putting different issues/requests into the same thread is a bad idea because then each request just gets buried.
---
Each unique request should have its own thread. It works if the mods remove the duplicates, but it sounds like they don't.
---
The suggestions forum on the official website is where requests go to die. At least here on reddit, people can upvote an issue, and as long as duplicates are getting removed, then it's not an issue.
---
Why 8 caps?
---
T-51B with calibrated shocks is what I use in nuke zones. Cheap to repair, extra carry weight and good rad resistance.
---
Remember to uograde some under armour too.
---
I use Excavator with shocks to carry large amounts of stuff around or mining.
---
Okay I wasn't sure, so any mod we have we should be able to attach without PERK cards?
---
I think it's either T-51b or T-60 have extremely base repair requirements, I can't remember which off the top of my head. Got a set just for that reasoning, slapped a stealth boy on the torso &amp; some of the camo paint. 
---
Excavator is good for lugging items around, a full set will give 100+ carry weight, can add calibrated shocks for another 100. Frankly I'm still using my level 35 for combat &amp; having zero issues with it.
---
I mostly use X-01 just for appearance however. You get the plans as a reward as well, so no hunting those or parts down.
---
The durability only works when you craft it or if you have the weapon smithing perk equipped which is a 5 point perk. As for perception in PvP, I don't do PvP. Not that I don't want to, I just can't justify risking all of my aid items every death since I need to carry them due to the stash system still needing a rework (making junk, notes, holotapes, cosmetics all non-items and just numerics to save on server load). Though it is still true that it doesn't work on NPC'S which is important. You also say miles away detection and even while they are sneaking, if that doesn't factor their agility and stealth perks and stealth boys in then it's also broken in a bad way as well
---
I found that the T60 is pretty easy to find between Watoga spawns and FT Defiance. Might have to hit a couple of the BOS outposts in the Bog, but I find it covers damage pretty good and seems to be the easiest and cheapest to repair.
---
R.E.S.P.E.C.T
---
I have like 900 waste acid on pc. I always forget I have it and then when my stash is full I wonder wtf is going on
---
If we could have a cave it would be even better with the overgrowth. Bodies of different types like vault dweller, raider or scorch would add to the evil lives here visage to our built homes
---
Could you imagine getting plans for explosive ammo?
---
Screw TSE, gimme the plans for explosive ammo and I‚Äôll chamber it for my .50, my 5.56 and .45.
---
I don't know that I would call this proof, so much as clarification (everyone here thought she was talking about the player dots).  But thank you for deciphering that mess.
---
Vampire+swing speed combat knife. I want one soooo bad
---
I'm saying they need to be looked at because I can one shot lvl 68 scorched with a plain, non legendary lever gun.  Having a god-roll laser gun from the imaginary future be about as good as a plain lever gun with anachronistic ballistic technology doesn't seem right.  On my sniper, there needs to be a really compelling reason for me to lose Mister Sandman sneak attack boost in order to consider using a laser or plasma weapon.  Since Bethesda acquired the franchise, energy weapons have been way behind ballistic weapons.  They were very good in Fo1 and 2.
---
I gave you an upvote dude, the other person next to you also. I've seen the same y'all are saying. I kill everything I see moving . Tons of legendary shit on unmarked enemies. I really want the basic part plans for ultracite armor( chest arms and legs) to be removed from the queen loot pool . As they continue to waste space in the rng grab bag.
---
If it makes you feel any worse I tried explaining this to someone yesterday and they used "but data miners are finding all sorts of stuff Bethesda isn't telling us about in every patch" to rationalize their legendary nerf conspiracy theory
---
Subtitles are great, especially when your teammates are constantly whining.
---
Personally I would like a different model for when someone drops stuff. If they drop junk I can't tell if I'm picking up someone's stuff while they're still respawning or if they were getting rid of extra weight
---
Kind of a loaded comment, but you're not wrong. It's everyone's responsibility to make this place not be a dumpster full of flaming redundant content...
---
* Mods do need to keep retiring suggestions to the Bethesda Plz megathread and follow through with deleting the duplicates. This shit needs to be cleaned up.
---
* Community members need to do a better job of finding similar posts and adding to those, instead of just creating new ones every day.
---
I have max sneak and escape artist, plus one piece of shadowed armor, plus a piece of chameleon armor. Your ideal build would be all of those things, plus weighless chameleon armor, plus the chameleon mutation. Maybe a piece of shrouded wood armor too. 
---
Then pop a phantom device before you start shooting.
---
To be clear, don‚Äôt just talk to him, bug the shit out of him. He‚Äôs a lazy old drunk, it takes a bit to get him on track.
---
Lmao yea we are but at the same time unless we say it then it most likely isn't true
---
this is *the best place* to discuss because then you get to see how many people want the same thing. Discussing problems or needs is also discussing the game.
---
Bethesda definitely comes here to look so it's not like not voting. Their community managers go looking in multiple places because they know not everyone will use the same thing.
---
Yea, that would be a good idea.
---
Yep. You will need sugar, gourds and I think it's purified water. A fellow Wastelander kindly planted some gourds for me at my camp. I collect sugar when I see it, or I pick a bunch of snap tail reeds (by the river near Flatwoods) and just make sugar. If I run out of ingredients I just make the cobbler though. I put on green thumb and Super Duper and share it around with my squad or other Wastelanders I may encounter since it will go bad before I can eat it all.
---
Nor have they confirmed how they'll work. 
---
You want to guess? Go ahead.
---
But don't spread faulty/incomplete information like it's gospel.
---
Sorry, but that just doesn't really hold up. This game has made it to where even if you had no access to any water but the purified you had on you, your character would choose to not cook with it so they had it to drink.
---
Back atcha.
---
Strangely, some creatures will *still* spot you immediately.
---
yeah the mods should handle duplicate posts
---
No worries! I figured I would ask :)
---
There's a Bethesda please megathread that they used to use to retire this exact sort of thing. The mods just haven't been doing it lately... really since last patch, which caused a flare up of the "Bethesda Plz" disease. There's treatment, but no cure.
---
I'm on PS4 so that might be the difference.
---
Nice! More accurate
---
There are many, MANY acid nodes throughout the map.  Find one that's out of the way and put your camp there.
---
&gt; also tempted to make a place deep in the Mire for the excitement and mood.
---
If you want a spot with some excitement, pull up the online map and find the junk node just north of Harper's Ferry. It's just down the hill to the east of one of those giant power line towers, so it shouldn't be too hard to find. I was camped there for a while and was greeted by all sorts of things: glowing stingwings, anglers, level 60+ mutants, level 60+ scorched, max level radtoads, etc, and there's a guaranteed wendigo spawn just a bit further down the hill.
---
It is also seems the diseased moniker over rides legendary in the naming scheme?
---
Mustve gotten 20 1* at WS last night but I think I saw one 2* &amp; one 3*. Rest all said diseased. Nothing was good, but the drops were happening (and it helped mean clear the vendors rapidly).
---
All I could think of reading your comment.
---
https://i.imgur.com/KvkIj7p.jpg
---
Wow, nice!
---
beats my 0 and disconnect. I just shut off my xbox after and walked away.
---
It‚Äôs up in the HUD quest list to the right if the objective to kill the sheepsquatch (assuming you have that event quest enabled from your pip-boy data menu).
---
Well Bethesda did say this is the number 1 place they check for feedback. Wouldn't it be dumb for us not to take advantage of that?
---
To be honest I still have a 12 int because I didn't realise it doesn't help having more than like 6 for perks, since, while I keep getting almost exclusively int perks, they are all out of combat perks that I switch out to when I need them to craft. If they at least made crafting items able to be upgraded to legendary, and fixed item management, then 100% I would shuffle my 2 points from str and end
---
I‚Äôll be off from around 3:30-5:00 eastern standard time
---
also depends on play style I'm a crafter build so I tend to scrap all the guns and other things I find for materials and sell meat and random food for caps so I can then spend them on more plans and recipes
---
Yeah, but eventually you run out.  I used to buy all the whitespring plans, but now I know them all.  I'm working my way through all the power armor plans now.
---
&gt;If Beth hasn't seen it yet, they won't. They are either going to do it, or they won't. Stop fucking asking for it.
---
you don't know that.
---
How come you have to say it in such a mocking tone? I was very excited when Bethesda announced a new Fallout and sorely disapointed when I found out it was a multiplayer spinoff that strayed from what Fallout was. Sure, you can play an imagination based roleplay in Fallout 76 but that isn't what attracted me or many of the original fans to Fallout. If I want to roleplay with my friends in an imaginative way i'll play Gmod or better yet a table top. I played Fallout for a nice structured narrative and world that reacts to my choices.
---
Even more salient how does someone win Fallout?
---
This drives me crazy too
---
"No, I just spend all my gaming hours playing this game and when I can't play I look at this sub instead. But it all sucks and I hate it."
---
Ah, role playing huh?
---
Yeah, but those are 1* legendaries lol
---
not only that you can build around them. I have a junk extractor near the top of the world and I put my foundations around it then sealed it off so not only does someone have to pick my front door with turrets but then lockpick my junk extractor while under fire.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs the same in the Anthem subreddit, the mods there are a bunch of whiney pricks too.
---
Please point us to the "brightness" settings. I'll wait.
---
+ damage when used underground
---
Included free crooked neck flashlight
---
:p
---
I like it though, why the hell not have it
---
Depends on your sense of humor, methinks.
---
Clown outfit, fashnacht man mask, prisoner collar, and a machete, pretty much since I acquired them.
---
 I have a chainsaw too, but unfortunately, it not effective enough in the areas I'm currently roaming.
---
Alternative outfits is the same mask and collar, but a straightjacket.
---
And one day I'll get my fav from previous fallouts - Grognak outfit.
---
If they do add it it‚Äôll be an atom shop item lmao.
---
Alright, I'll make sure to upload it later today. I'll let you know when it's up. Will add 25% and 75% brightness variants as well.
---
Eventually you get down to the stuff you'll never need.  I will never build a spinning wheel, but I have the plan.
---
I suggested this and only 1 person was for it. Everyone else thinks it would be a bad idea because caps would lose their meaning and rich people would get richer.
---
My favorite is seeing the event pop up in Survival Mode, followed many death bags around the event.
---
That can go both ways. The reason many people hate Fallout 76 is because it is not focused on being a singleplayer RPG.
---
Come for the wrecked piled up trains, stay for the free states robot.
---
"Rawr, Bethesda only needs to do what I think they should be doing. Anything I don't like is wrong"
---
It really isn't, it's really easy to get hold of and cores need one of each. 1 run of Whitespring, 1 either Cranberry Bog or Toxic Valley, bit of super duper and no more scrounging around old PA or hoping someone doesn't gank you at a power station workshop. 
---
 Plus it's a handy thing to point out for gatlin laser users who'd probably do shameful things for a 115% fusion core.
---
 Plus stash management becomes a pain in the arse when you've got 40ish of each sitting there, they weigh a lot.
---
You do understand that multiple posts saying the same thing actually shows LESS of an impact than a single post with a large amount of up votes? Sinc eupvotes just get duplicated across those posts they are mostly ignored. You seem to not understand how the world of online open world gaming works. At any time when Bethesda decides the game is no longer profitable they can just shut down all access to the servers and then where will you be?
---
The fact that the Bethesda community managers can actually be contacted and we know they see things on Reddit has compeltely ruined the value of them being on Reddit and seeing the community feedback. It's now flooded. Everyone knows their names and every post is directed right at Bethesda. It went from a good way to get changes made to just a pile of shit. We need to get these back into a mega thread and let the votes decide what makes the official list.
---
I don't want to be that guy to everyone else here trying to defend the reasoning but there is truly no logical reason for it. There just isn't, it was a simple oversight by the DEVS that hopefully they fix.
---
It goes to show that video games are for every demographic and can be enjoyed by all,. I always loved video games not only because of the games themselves but because of the fact that it brings people together from all ages and all backrounds.
---
People may hate on it but they havent lived through the awesome times people have with games for example i have met ALOT of awesome people while playing 76 alone from young kids to fathers playing with their kids and its wonderful. 
---
Another example how a videogame can bring people together is the game ark survival evolved i saw a post on the games subreddit of a tribe meeting irl which i find to be a 1 in a million chanc of any online friends to meat eachother.
---
Shrouded Wood Armour is the best armour for stealth, hands down. Increased crouch speed, the "stealth in dark places" thing and basic resistances like you mentioned. With a full set, the crouch speed is just great
---
I think mods removing duplicate posts would help
---
I have had the same happen to me when looting the sheepsquatch impostor. I went to the body to loot and a bombbot killed me and I didn't have the option to respawn. I didn't get credit for the event or get to loot. This game really knows how to abuse you.
---
Whitesprings is a low-level location. Did you expect the same quality as in the bog?
---
it's totally random, yesterday I handed in just one and got the Knight paint too, just keep at it. Enclave bunker has a few in the military room's desks; if i get any more i'll reply here and trade it to you.
---
I made another 6 flux while writing this btw.
---
I like them. It's a good way to know if that redditor is an entitled 13 year old or not.
---
SBQ. I don‚Äôt think the encrypted event scales like the SBQ does, and I‚Äôm fairly certain I could solo the encryptid event- bloodied HW build will hurt it even with all the pylons keeping it cloaked. Sure I‚Äôd die a lot, but since you respawn right on the event and don‚Äôt lose anything, just keep shooting and dying. 
---
(Uh, yeah, PSA- it‚Äôs not invulnerable when cloaked. It just has a ton more passive damage reduction. I‚Äôm guessing cloaking applies a 90% DR effect. If you do massive amounts of damage, it‚Äôll still lose health. It does go down a LOT faster when it‚Äôs decloaked though.
---
On top grass area of Whitespring Bunker always spawn 1 squirrels and 2 rabbits.
---
He means the custom markers you put down
---
You mean Executioners, right?
---
That's a shit idea, nuke yourself /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
Try suppressor , 3point charisma card, and dodgy , 3 point agility card. That's 60% damage mit as long as you are regularly hitting what is hitting you. I do both of those with a vampire cryolator . In pa I use the emergency protocols chest mod but I think core assembly would be better for dodgy( it consumes ap to mit 30% incoming damage) and a canned coffee , I solo farmed the event this weekend many times, did it with a few random groups , and with a couple friends once or twice. The only real problem for me is. All my caps are gone now lol, that shit too expensive to keep sponsoring, considering making a Appalachian go fund me so I can keep it up.
---
There is a lookout, forgot which one where there are two ports potties. In one of them is a ‚Äúmysterious button‚Äù . Push it and the music starts and the eye or appears with a parade of rabid rats following. 
---
I came across it yesterday.
---
Legitimately how I feel and look. I'm actually surprised imgur loaded. It has never worked on my phone before. Ever.
---
Lvl 1 Wiffle Bat.
---
That is all.
---
Well that's another can of worms. Energy weapons are a insult. They are out done by every weapon in the game even though they are supposedly the most powerful lore wise. I am still hoping they listen and buff them and make them capable of stealth attacks. I think that it shouldn't be a perk but rather an overhaul of both the damage, the silencing, and armor piercing as well as the issues they have ALWAYS had with goo and ash piles
---
He means he custom map markers you can put down
---
I feel like people tend to ignore things like the fact that you take less damage the closer to the pylon you are and you deal 25% additional damage while a conduit.
---
I must have missed that update. Thanks for the heads up!
---
The only penalty of death is potentially losing your junk. I'm ok with that. Junk farming at Sheepsquatch is out of hand but on the other hand don't take stuff with you that you can't afford to lose.
---
exactly. this is one of the biggest sites where they can get feedback. the way to fix this is for mods to delete duplicate posts
---
There would be less asshats that sit at the new event picking bags of dead characters. They are fucking worms.
---
Agreed.  When I go down during Encryptid, don't help me.  If someone is a conduit, they will remain one as they bleed out.  That's like 20 free seconds.
---
This ITV was probably already written before the last one was released
---
Just north of Harper's Ferry you'll find a one of those giant electrical towers with a pond at the base. Just to the east down a small cliff is a junk extractor. If you place your camp so that the junk extractor is *just* inside the circle you can catch enough of the pond to place 3 or 4 industrial purifiers.
---
yep and from playing  call of duty, i plenty fast enough on the trigger
---
By pay to win I‚Äôm talking about the repair kits that are coming, that‚Äôs the term everyone is using so I assumed it was the right one to use. My point still stands, why add content to a game when the game doesn‚Äôt even work 90% of the time? I‚Äôm tired of wasting ammo because enemies are literally teleporting during the fight. I‚Äôm tired of the game being like ‚Äúplay with friends‚Äù when even when you do play with them, the fucking constantly teleport. I know it isn‚Äôt my wifi because 90% of other games I play (that are constantly online) do not have this issue. I‚Äôm not giving Bethesda shit because I‚Äôm a hater or whatever. I love fallout. I just wish I could play the /game/ without dealing with stupid shit that should‚Äôve been fully fixed MONTHS ago.
---
That‚Äôs true, I have bought a bunch of extra x01 mods including several shocks and jetpacks. At certain point it just became ‚Äòwhere can I park those caps to keep grinding‚Äô. Dumped lots of one to two star legendaries in suitcases and sacks because of the 25k limit.
---
You have to have a repair kit to beat the Scorchbeast Queen.  Duh.  That's why no one's been able to beat her yet.
---
I think the addition of all those robots is a bit much. The creature itself with those pylons is annoying enough. And exploding eyebots? Ugh.
---
exactly - one person posting on their forum gets nothing. 100 people posting here on reddit gets notice. I think the mods need to do a better job of removing duplicates
---
You‚Äôve never been to r/DestinyTheGame then.
---
Level 107 I'm having the same problem
---
Funny enough the guy told me that the female character he had wasn't his main but was designed to look like his ex wife who took him for everything he had. He said she was nice to look at but not a very nice person lol
---
You‚Äôre probably thinking of the unique Tesla PA torso and arms  from the robot DLC in FO4. The tesla mod itself never had a visual change in FO4, that I‚Äôm aware of.
---
If you don‚Äôt want generic text posts then you guys should consider taking up crab memes from the osrs subreddit. At least then it can be fun.
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
sorry, yes executioner's, don't know why i was thinking assassin
---
Yup I was the one who made the post. The data is all in the files.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
This bit is true, and it‚Äôs been the case since launch
---
There really isn't a good way to get them. Looting every one you can find and buying bulk doesn't add up to much considering how often they're needed.
---
My melee power armour character barely uses any tho, had about 400 saved up until I chomped through the whole lot making weapons to break down for mods to get a ranged weapon to tag scorchbeasts.
---
I don‚Äôt get the p2w argument. Pay to win against who? The guy two shotting you with a tse, standing still in a dress? You think that guy needs a repair kit?
---
For someone like my teammate, who doesn‚Äôt have a lot of time to play because he‚Äôs out running his life and making good money, they‚Äôd be useful. Because that guy is just looking to unwind and hang out with his buds on the mic once a week, not worry about ballistic farming. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt buy them, personally, because I enjoy the grind, but I do buy atoms for costumes if I want one. I definitely don‚Äôt pay attention to atom daily or weekly‚Äôs, I enjoy scaving but not taking goofy hat pictures, wasting mats on useless items I‚Äôm suppose to craft, or jumping through hoops for a nickel.
---
It really is all luck, im lvl 206 now and ive never actually found a TSE altho i have found other really nice stuff. It seems that lately as well the drop rate of anything worth keeping has gone down significantly, i havent gotten a good 3* in days despite killing several 3* enemies. So it all comes down to rng and power farming. Heres to hoping the legendary vendor helps us out in our quest for ballin loot yo.
---
Ultimately I figured that out and responded to it in a couple of other comments.
---
That's why when I see them for sale at a vendor, I snatch them up.
---
Every little bit helps IMO. Thanks
---
I mean, that‚Äôs part of the game
---
I got griefed yesterday for refusing to sell shot gun shells after someone took my junk bag in my camp.
---
Yeah; I never put a full 3/Max stars into any perk cards I don't have to though, helps prevent unnecessary/unwanted duplicates through the packs. Still get master lockpick and hacker waaay too much tho
---
Random.  I've gotten one decent drop, and one passable one (1 star) that I use as my main weapon.  Almost ready to totally respec just to use the other weapon, I can't see upgrading my sniper any time soon.
---
Sad part is, I'm too weak to farm nuke zones to *get* better weapons, so I'm relying on the odd wandering legendaries to try to improve (also farmed the hell out of the sheepsquatch event, to no avail).
---
You have to get lucky, and either rebuild around what you find, or get really lucky and get what you need.  Or, buy something off someone else.
---
Yea, that's been a problem ever since the game launched, now however the naming scheme is just all sorts of messed up with the legendary name not popping up no matter if they're diseased or not.  I've even had a few enemies that were neither labeled as diseased or legendary BUT had just the stars tacked on at the end.
---
This sub shouldn't be for suggestions to Bethesda.  Period.
---
Can't you just block them? Anytime i see a group wandering around and they are wanted, i block the group.
---
I'd imagine 30 pounds if it was in game
---
Picking up junk in a workshop shouldn‚Äôt do it... but if you picked a lock to get to that junk, or damaged something in that workshop, that would.
---
The supply crate thing is from a government supply drop that someone initiated. They USED to be unlocked and instanced loot for everyone, now they‚Äôre locked and belong to the player who called them (you‚Äôll notice it says ‚Äústeal‚Äù to unlock it) and you get Wanted for ‚Äústealing‚Äù from it.
---
Thanks for the clarification!
---
It's an experience and a half
---
It's not. It's going to be a random encounter spawn and also part of an event called free range they just haven't turned that flag on yet
---
Thank you.   Sorry for the ignorance.  But what do you mean by range and power farming?
---
Also any merit to the idea that upping the luck perk will  result in better drops?
---
"I had a great idea: let us break down or sell ammo!"
---
Would be cool on one condition, one hit it breaks.
---
PS4 here. I'm level 43. I think I've ran in to 3 or 4 dick heads that shot me at 1st site. Also ran in to 2 dudes that acted like they were fucking me cause I play as a female character. I killed both of them (have video, lol) 
---
Other than that, everyone else has been great in this game.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure it was always as rare as it is now.
---
Why unarmed then? What's so special about that over other attack types
---
LOL
---
Is there a too long didn‚Äôt watch version of this video?   I got to the guy complaining about melee nerfs and gave up.  
---
&gt;force their pvp on them
---
How do?
---
yes. Failing to respawn at an event like this is honestly some bullshit.
---
I have a vampire double barrel that has been in my carry for about 75 levels. That thing is clutch when being swarmed by fast-moving ghouls. Like "One violent night" or getting overrun at white springs.
---
Ah, the G.I.R.L = Guy In Real Life "Theory."
---
"Don't wanna look at another dudes ass," is the usual reasoning.
---
After paying $60 for the game, they are beholden to something. That gets you some entitlement, doesn't it?
---
What about the value of knowing that multiple people feel the same way about an issue? You have to post about it somewhere to know that and things never change when you don't talk about them. They certainly don't change if you don't say anything or post in the endless void known as Bethesda forums.
---
The solution is easy - the mods need to do a better job about keeping each issue in its own separate thread. They need to remove duplicate posts faster.
---
If the playerbase is as positive as the one here, I will definitely check that game out.
---
They also said that the power armour edition would come with a canvas bag- lie 
---
Nuka dark rum would be a unique bottle with a unique rum- yet another lie 
---
The game will only feature cosmetic micro transaction- yet another lie 
---
So until they start producing on there promises without changing them I don't believe anything Bethesda says about 76
---
Dude can you stop providing false information everywhere? None if this is true at all.
---
Cool, I'm glad!   (Also, I'm a woman. Just fyi.)
---
:)
---
That's the thing. If Stealth Boys mimick the abilities of both Sneak and Escape Artist, that's four points I can put into a combo of Gun Fu and Adrenaline to boost my damage output. Or put into a combo of Evasive and Dodgy to keep me alive.
---
Seems your saying even though you're "invisible" with a Stealth Boy, they can still hear you moving if you don't have Sneak. Hmm...
---
Get's boring real quick if you just ingore the idiots, it aint hard.
---
I like your grenade cook idea but cooking sloer is not that advantageous. What WOULD be cool is an effect that adds some info to your grenades. Like how the one perk shows the grenade arc. A new one could be you can see the countdown timer for a cooking grenade.
---
Have you done the mission to get the excavator power armor plans? It gives you the level 25 PA suit I believe and then the plans to repair it or make higher tier versions of it. That's basically the main armor I use because you get added carry bonus with it.
---
Awesome! Same with me when i did one solo i tried fighting the queen but was unsuccessful. And sinc i always ran out of stims while in a silo i made it a priority to keep atleast 150 stims on me at all times cause i cant count the times ive never eded just 1 to win a fight cause of what ive realised is that if you are fighting something alone when you die they regain health back. But thats just me
---
Nope. Bethesda needs to know what pissed people off.
---
very true - there are many improvements to be made
---
To be fair, adding in P2W stuff is pretty easy, rejiggering net code to make a 3.5 year old game run well takes a lot of work.
---
By the way, I get no noticeable server lag on 95% of the servers I join.  Occasionally I'll join one that immediately chokes itself to death, though I don't know if that's a code issue or if I've logged in with someone's alt carrying 23847268 pounds of duped gear.
---
And it get bonus damage from demo expert , mine does 100 ballistic and 50 something energy damage
---
It's only old because you haven't moved your camp yet.
---
OP, are you over 18? This game is meant for mature audiences only. 
---
Your video is really boring. Tried to find where one might see a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù.  What I can say for sure is you never died and you just stood there the whole time. So maybe you used a bad example. 
---
No one in this video should be punished.  Grow up and get some proof that will change my mind.
---
Yup.
---
Would be happy to help on ps4!
---
Sometimes that imbalance is what makes the game interesting. I can hang with a supermutant 10-15 levels higher than me. It'll take most of my ammo and it will be hard to recover, but if he's between me and something I need I'll go for it. That challenging fight is fun and it feels good to eventually take him down.
---
An assaultron my level? No thanks. I don't need whatever that was. I'll run away and do something else. And that's fine.
---
Exactly what Phantom said
---
I feel you. On top of that, the shotgun and pistol archetypes would have some way better options if energy weapons were good.
---
What do you mean fixed? I've been using serums for months.
---
People seem to have this thing where they believe that Bethesda is intentionally doing this. The fact of the matter is that you are just getting bad rng. In the entire map creatures have a specific chance to spawn as legendary. Enemies Between level 0 and 10 its a 1% chance, 11 and 20 is 2%, 21 and 30 is 3%, 31 and 40 is 4%, and 40+ is 5%. Nuke zones double each of those chances. Everything else is based on rng. These numbers come straight from the data files and the only things that change these values are events and quests that have set percentages for legendaries to spawn.
---
Bethesda Please remove all Bethesda Please posts and comments. Plz.
---
You get rewarded a full set of Ultracite during the main quest, it‚Äôs a solid option but repairs are costly and mods are hard to come by. I‚Äôd grab that first, and then start collecting parts. T-60 is a really great option, it has plentiful mods, cheap repairs, unique BoS paints, and is fairly common. It‚Äôs got relatively average resistances, but to be honest, you won‚Äôt notice a significant difference in actual combat between most of the PA. 
---
X-01 has great rad resist which is nice in nuke zones, it‚Äôs also the only one with a Recon mod for the helmet (acts like a recon scope on any weapon you aim with). However, there‚Äôs only one source for mods, they‚Äôre random, and the good ones like jet pack and calibrated shocks are super rare.
---
Jesus then why the fuck is my game so bad? But yeah, you‚Äôre right. I know it‚Äôs not the simplest thing ever, that‚Äôs why I said ‚Äúmonths‚Äù and not ‚Äúimmediately‚Äù It just sucks because I want to enjoy this game but I‚Äôm constantly lagging and it‚Äôs the only game that ever does this.
---
It's not only in the files it's also in random encounter spawns and also an event called free range. There is a specific flag for the npc which Bethesda has not yet enabled which is why we don't see it.
---
So's the princess bed, Playtime PA paint, Toybox stash...
---
They're all childish, and Beth still added them.
---
Don't like, Don't Buy.
---
How I dealt with it was starting a new character and focusing on melee. On my original character that specialized in automatic rifles, gathering materials for ammo was a daily occurrence. On my melee character, I just smack things with a deathclaw gauntlet about 1,000 times before I need to repair it. So much easier, it's kind of not fair.
---
Indeed. A TERRIBLE change.
---
Place Sandman before you place Covert Ops and you'll get 3.75x.  You just have to remember to do this every time you hop servers.
---
The weapons are OP because you can't use them in power armor (assuming), except PA is so crippling to your speed and AP, it doesn't even begin to compare to legendary armor effects no matter what mods, and you have to carry fusion cores.
---
When you can one shot almost anything in the game, the extra damage resistance doesn't matter even a little. On the rare occasion you get swarmed by enemies you can just evade until you thin the horde. There's are niche scenarios where other things are better, but they're extremely rare, and generally not that much better.
---
Someone mentioned that the devs mentioned that the server instancing they're toying with is new to them, implying that there will be some instanced situations (and the burrows would be a good first candidate for that).  But, I don't recall seeing it mentioned myself, and a little googling I did just now doesn't bring anything up (other than 'instanced loot' which doesn't apply to what you're asking).
---
I never do mine, but scraping...!  
---
And for the shotgun, you gonna need plastics as well.  
---
Plastic:  
---
Watoga High School Cafeteria area  
---
Fort Defiance 4th Floor  
---
Scrapping Laser Rifle/Pistol (Super Mutants) 10 plastics with scrapper perk.  
---
Steel and Lead:  
---
Tins Cans hanging - Camden Park / Pleasant Valley Ski Resort  
---
And of course, super duper and ammo smith is required.
---
Been playing since release and got 5-6 god tier items, so around every 100 hours played I get a good drop.
---
And what should Bethesda do? Thiose people are doing PVP in a game that allows PVP... Maybe they are even roleplaying as raiders. Next thing people will be asking Bethesda to fix Creatures attacking their camps...
---
What I have found is there is typically a toxic top layer in most communities but digging in you tend to find the gems.  Hell even for a community built around friendship (Looking at you Bronies) It gets rather toxic.
---
Game only been out like 6 or 7 months.
---
The robots kill the scorchqueens, just toss a bullet in them and go about your business.
---
When you die though, doesn't that leave about 20 seconds or so without all of the pylons activated by the time you respawn and run back over the the pylon? I'm just trying to figure out my strategy now that I've drawn down my stimpak stash. I've successfully been pylon holder twice, but failed twice (which I attribute to a lack of other pylon holders in the event, which makes the event drag on and on).
---
Princess Bed. 
---
Toybox stash.
---
Playtime PA paint.
---
Case closed.
---
My most used workbench location, literally never seen them there. He asked if there were any GUARANTEED spawns, don't you know what the word means or did you just feel like writing stuff?
---
Counterpoint- if you really like rifles, go all in with a high damage build and use a .45 caliber rifle (lever action or combat).
---
My bloodied stealth VATS sniper with a bloody lever action hasn‚Äôt crafted ammo since level 30ish. She‚Äôs 130ish. Most things are 1headshot kills, and .45 is a very common and plentiful ammo type.
---
Thank You.
---
A few thoughts:
---
TSE isn't all it's cracked up to be anymore. The "two shot" portion got nerfed from 100% extra damage to 25% extra, and the accuracy takes a nose dive with that effect. They also reduced the damage bonus from the demolitions expert perk, so you don't get as much bang for your buck from the explosive effect either. 
---
don't concern yourself so much with the "damage on paper" as it were. I'd take an anti-armor rifle doing 100 damage over a two shot rifle doing 125, because a larger portion of the stated damage from the AA gun will actually hit the mob. 
---
Many of the screenshots you see of obscene damage stats are from people with highly specialized build/weapon/mutation combos, and for many of those you don't even need a particulary awesome weapon. For example, my primary weapon is level 40 1* bloodied baseball bat. When I'm at full health and wearing PA it does ~150 damage (+15 energy damage from the heated coil). However, I can crank the damage up to roughly 1,500 damage per swing if it's over-repaired, I'm wearing a full set of unyielding armor, and my health is in the 20% range. It's a very high-risk, high-reward playstyle, and frankly it's overkill for anything other than scorchbeasts (and the queen), but it's fun to smash shit now and then.
---
What system are you on, and what's your build? I have an assortment of random legendaries that I'd be happy to sell you for cheap if you're on xbox.
---
Cosmetic at launch. It was and it has been. Idk I don‚Äôt see how it can stay in the narrow static state. Maybe some cool things like a drone will be available someday. Or a grey headband that gives you infinite ammo for uh a week... that would be fun :)
---
Idk I kind of like it. The current voice makes it sound creepy, like there is no hope once the nuke drops or something like that.
---
Yeah I understand the instancing of loot. I'm just hoping that the burrows is instanced. I mean it'd be cool if it wasn't too I guess. I guess we'll see tomorrow
---
Hi just, I'm your grandma. Why don't you call me?
---
Maybe call.it bullet proof glass so that it doesn't break on one hit
---
The is no "one best" armor
---
Of the easiest to obtain PAs, 
---
Excavator is great for carrying all the extra loot you get in the nuke zone.  
---
It has higher rad resistance that T51, but less than T60.
---
T51 has the best dmg resistance, and t60 has the best rad resistance.
---
There are at least 16 PA spawn sites on the left side of the map.  
---
(Re) visit them; Except for excavator, thats how I collected  mine.  (You can mix/match parts on the frame, BTW.)
---
At least some people included that they didn't know if it was guaranteed, but some make it sound like it's a sure bet. I just spent the last hour checking every spot mentioned here and it must be random, because there was not a single one. I'm looking for one to complete a Challenge, just to kill one, because I've literally never seen one
---
If you want I can craft one for you. I‚Äôd have to check if I have the materials but if I do I‚Äôll hook you up if I do. I‚Äôll be after 4 today. Just message me here if you wanna set something up.
---
I always see it when visiting the train station next to poseidon powerplant i was confused the first time and was curious what would happened if i destroyed it but nothing happened
---
North of Aaronholt Homestead (north east corner of your map) is a great spot. It has a junk extractor, no water though, I just have 4 in ground ones to make up for that. The bonus of this location is:
---
* It's on a farm, so you can have all the crops you want at your camp. 
---
* Cranberries also grow there
---
* You can get honey for the kettle pot daily quest there
---
* You can get pumpkins for the pumpkin house daily quest too
---
* The shed down the hill has a power armor frame with some random PA bits on it and a fusion core. This is good for the ballistic fiber from scrapping the chassis, and getting a fusion core upon login almost every time.
---
* Brewing ingredients are all on the farm, so brewing is now a breeze
---
* Enemies are low enough level to be taken out by the base gun turrets
---
That is all the benefits I can think of for now. The only real con for me is being in the top left corner of the map fast travel to watoga or SBQ can be expensive.
---
The point of the warning is akin to the emergency broadcast system.  What would be great is being told which areas are affected, just like if it was a real emergency broadcast and it talked about which counties were affected instead of making you look at your map
---
I‚Äôve already fully justified why it works. Pve is hardly difficult so I use sentinels when I have to stand and swing at something for a while is all I‚Äôm saying. I have healing factor so small battles with a handful of enemies don‚Äôt require stims regardless.  A full set of armor modded the highest plus barbarian, dodgy, evasive, lone wanderer, iron clad you absolutely could get by without much effort I mean I fight the queen in a hazmat suit unless you have someone who knows what there doing launching at the right spot to fight outside of the nuke zone, drop zone v9 ish.
---
I‚Äôm not talking about power armor. I‚Äôm talking about the powered legendary trait that causes ap refresh speed. Dodgy and increased ap refresh were meant to be. 
---
I‚Äôm not tryin to change your mind brah, it just keeps me alive during boss fights with big hp where you have to slug it out for a while
---
Getting through the silo is my current struggle.   Got any advice for that?
---
I couldn't agree more.
---
Good idea, it should cost a lottt more compared to metal walls
---
I fixed everything. Thanks for the comment
---
&gt; your reward is 20 atoms :-)
---
lol
---
PhantomToes has the right idea.
---
Also, unless you plan to wear it constantly, I find plenty cores in the wild to keep myself stocked. While ones in generators are \~50% used up, I find plenty of full ones elsewhere. I only use PA to fast travel while overencumbered 90% of the time and I've got something like 20 in my stash. If you're going to run a nuke zone, then yeah, it helps to take a workshop first to get cores.
---
&gt; Putting different issues/requests into the same thread is a bad idea because then each request just gets buried.
---
This is the same exact thing as saying putting all issues/requests into the same subreddity is a bad idea because then each request just gets buried, which is what is happening now. You can sort the thread by new, you can see which idea are more important to the community based of upvotes and comments and popularity, all in the same way you could if it was its own post. 
---
The difference is that if it's in a thread and people aren't looking for those sorts of comments, they can avoid the thread. If I'm looking for things other than Bethesda Plz, well I'm out of luck because that's half the sub these days.
---
There's an ini setting for those of us on pc
---
I've been online gaming since I was just in my early tweens.  Actually been gaming with an older group of individuals since then 40's at the time.  Their experiences and wisdom helped shape me who I am to (Also curved the edgy little shit in me at the time)
---
yea, sadly all of my friends bought into the false "beth bad 76 bad ooga" YouTube crap from last year, so i feel you there
---
The Elite Dangerous playerbase is legendary. There are entire player organizations formed to rescue pilots, and you'll see stories on various gaming news sites fairly regularly about how players accomplished some crazy feat or had to be rescued in a particularly spectacular manner. There are trolls, but they're few in number and easily avoided by joining the several player formed groups around PvE only activity. 
---
The biggest issue with Elite is honestly the difficulty cliff. It's nowhere near as bad as EVE Online, but it's pretty tough - though it's going to get much easier in just a couple weeks as they're about to roll out a new player experience upgrade that includes a lot more help easing into the game. 
---
If you have VR, or a HOTAS controller, it's a no brainer.
---
Imo, T-60 is one of the best all-around options.  It's decent at everything and cheap to repair and upkeep.
---
I‚Äôve been there numerous times. Such a great town!! All the shop owners and such are pretty much family to me.... can‚Äôt say the same for the Free States vendor.
---
&gt;I hope I‚Äôm not the only person who has had this thought.
---
There's at least 3 of these threads every fucking day, so you're definitely not alone.
---
Super duper has never worked on brewing.
---
Also they didn't change the perk they just updated the text. It didn't apply to post-war alcohols before either
---
I assume this is why cryo grenades are given out as quest rewards for the new questline.
---
Staying cosmetic only is hardly narrow in an age where people are sick of microtransactions and the fact that a lot of people paid a AAA price for this game. we should not be paying extra for content that should just be added to the game.  by adding the repair kits to the Atom store they are breaking a promise that they made at launch.
---
That's the point.  If you ever hear the Emergency Broadcast System, that's similar to how it sounds.
---
I was overencumbered and ran there from the ash heap last night. ... My first event. Ran in, still trying to get my perk cards right. 
---
Couldn't make out the directions about keeping some kind of beacons operational. Saw the robots and figured they needed to die, but had no idea where the real enemy was. 
---
I know the payout for this event is better, but I prefer the queen event. Still chaotic, but at least you know where your enemy is. 
---
I don't totally blame the lower level players ofr hiding. I'm lvl 114 and had a couple of protective perks maxed out, and still was down to almost no hit points in less than a minute. 
---
I din't peek into the cabin, but from what I saw, everyone was trying to help in some way.
---
The other day I went in this house by the Nuka Cola factory and I found a dead radroach sitting on a toilet while wearing a top hat and smoking a cigar.
---
Add nc-ambush
---
Upvoted this to balance out the snowflakes.
---
You're welcome.
---
Useful information shouldn't be downvoted.
---
I scrapped something the other day and unlocked it! I truthfully don't know what it was, and now I'm searching heavily for it through all the armor I have :/
---
My second character is here. There is a junk node but no water either. Plenty of firecracker berries however. The only reason I mention this is because I built my CAMP into the monorail structure and it is pretty damn awesome. I love that camp, but admittedly, my other one at Aaronholt Homestead is more useful.
---
60 yr old ex cop here, love all Fallouts and play FO76 every day, level 100 and love it more and more every day. this year is my first look at online multiplayer and I'm hooked. See you in the wasteland...
---
This is the dumbest suggestion I've read on here in a long time.  So you completely want to remove any penalty for dying? The only reason to ever use a stimpak is to avoid a loading screen?
---
Death penalties need to be increased, not decreased.
---
You remain the conduit for upwards of another 30 seconds while you are on a knee bleeding out. The tower or towers remain active until you respawn. That time window should allow for sustained damage on the sheepsquatch. When you do respawn you have to rinse and repeat
---
It's funny how regular every-day tools are the most deadly in the wasteland.
---
A good build is more important than a good weapon in many cases. I get by with a 53 damage anti-armor pistol. When I stack a sneak attack and shoot a weak point, I am actually dealing 250 damage per bullet, 7 bullets per second.
---
The mechanics are there to amp your damage considerably with pistols or rifles.
---
I would not mind getting a max level pistol with more than 1 star. The only good weapons I get are under a different skill tree. My auto pistol build gets amazing melee and single shot weapons. I would love a vault to deliver between characters. These weapons are worthy of making a build around, I just don't want to respec my whole character just to use them properly.
---
I totally agree with you. The repair bug that they introduced could have been found with 2 seconds of testing
---
I don't either but I always carry a lightweight melee weapon in case my primary breaks, runs out of ammo, or I'm in a weak area and don't want to spend the bullets.
---
I kid you not... one of the coolest people I‚Äôve met playing was also an elderly gentleman who also was dressed in a Nuka Cola Girl outfit... ü§î
---
Wow. 72 and plays video games? Cool.
---
I haven't met anyone that old yet.
---
I understand why you can't sell them. Scrapping them for even a fraction of what it takes to craft them would be awesome.
---
Not just X-01. Any loose mods aren‚Äôt attaching.
---
I would make it Grafton's mayor, so that I could kill him and shut him up.
---
FO76 probably isn't quite like any other game you play (it's possible, but most games aren't).
---
No way to know what's going on...you say server lag, but it could be anything from your PC/console, to the network where you're at, to the network path you're getting between you and the servers (also, could be the servers).  If it's local ,you're looking at checking your own network card, graphics capabilities and performance, hell even caching and memory issues can cause spikes in performance.
---
On PC, if my game is having issues, I have tools I can use to diagnose the problem, on console I don't know if that's the case (never owned one).  I've run into horrible lag issues that turned out to be a node down the road a ways (well, a few hundred miles) that was acting up.  I know people that have issues with WiFi occasionally from things like microwaves or just plain poor coverage.  It's such a mixed bag that it's hard to diagnose what one person's problem might be.
---
Do you not have excavator armor to mine with? You can get a lot of copper and lead ore that you will need to smelt down. It should give you plenty in a short amount of time.
---
Lead a lucky holes mine. Copper near Solomons Pond.
---
It doesn't bother me. I like it
---
Did they change something again? After the camp budget patch it was telling me I can place a max of one artillery gun so I scrapped them all and haven't tried to place one since.
---
Allow us to use purified water instead...
---
I'm happy to mod your hunting rifle or create you a new one if you want a non-legendary.  I have all (or at least most) mods.  I'm on PC as well with the same IGN as my username here.
---
The one i seen was an eye bot playing a flute on the woods in the mire  with rats behind him
---
Whoa this is news - I got to 12 events yesterday but was wondering why workshops didn't count. Thanks for the heads-up!
---
I've found the game to crash (and not due to my PC) when there's alot of particles/smoke being produced. I think it's a server issue not being able to handle that many new animations in such a short time frame.
---
Maybe wait for more server optimizations? I don't know if there's a real fix tbh
---
Exactly. People are acting like this is so difficult to figure out
---
Oddly specific issue, I haven't heard about that one yet.  I'd suggest sending a ticket in and seeing if they have some idea what's going on.
---
Yeah I'm with you on that, I just want purified water to have a use, but this is the next best thing we have.
---
Yeah, ditto.
---
Just run laps around watoga killing robots.
---
I've had pretty much only junk, pre-war money, and ammo.
---
If you "search" them, sometimes you get more ammo, but nothing like guns.
---
Is it loaded? It's a basic mod function as far as I'm aware.
---
I'm not sure about a megathread. Each individual issue will get buried and then searching for the issue when checking for a duplicate will be next to impossible.
---
The problem with community members doing a better job is that this only works for seasoned users, which I agree with you should be done.
---
However, total reddit noobs are just going to dump their thoughts and that's always going to be an issue, which is where the mods come in.
---
Honestly, if the borrows isn't instanced, it's going to be a shit show.  I can't really see that working out even in the long run when everyone *isn't* trying to get in there all at once on Tuesday.
---
Didn't pick a lock in the first case, but I also didn't realize supply drops are now player owned so that explains the second case. Guess I'll just wander about until someone kills me for a bountiful 10 cap reward :c
---
5.56 and fusion cells are like gold to me
---
That would be dope. My username is the same as well.
---
spring traps?
---
I'll be 53 on Wednesday and having a blast teaming with my husband. Would love to play with you old farts and get that Sheepsquatch.
---
Nah, if you're buying plans and actively spending them on useful weapons/mods then you're just like everyone else.
---
If you're blowing 80caps on stims... you might be doing something wrong lol.
---
I had seen him between near Morgantwon, whilst doing the "Messenger" quest, where you follow the mr. Handy.
---
Farm Watoga.
---
I've built up 2000+ ECs doing that.
---
Not to mention they are laying around in Watoga too, there's usually few inside that locked door with the suit of power armor and a lv 3 lock. It's the one in the transit area that has two protectrons in it usually.
---
Why would you ever pay cash when you can buy all that with caps?
---
lol dude i dont even hang out with these people i came here to trade a guy then i fought him (the guy i knew) This video literally has no proof of anything in it.....
---
Ever since one of the updates, I lost all my Bears. I wasn‚Äôt paying attention to what was scrapping and I lost my whole collection.
---
I feel it's loaded because of all the things you just said. Whose responsibility is it, and if the sub falls to shit whose fault is it? Well, everyone's. But the mods do have the most power to correct it.
---
Nice place to visit, but the locals a bit aggressive.   The shipping isn‚Äôt bad though.  8/10
---
You can find a set in the shed near billings homestead. Just server hop until you get a complete set.
---
The little trailer at gorge junkyard has a set.
---
The metal building at Blackwater mine has a set of raider.
---
The arena near top of the world has a raider set.
---
Or do the exacavator quest.
---
i hope you realize powerful weapons still drop. all the duped weapons i have bought were removed from my inventory after a patch. if you cant trade weps with atom shop paints then your suggestion, by default, doesn't work.
---
It would add some clarity to the subreddit if we had megathreads for common conversations like requests, screenshots, patch-specific issues, etc.  But I wouldn't say I'm 'tired' of any of the topics.
---
Honestly I see far fewer posts about X or Y issue than I see posts complaining about people posting about X or Y issue.
---
Yeah preferably I‚Äôd like to wear it constantly
---
Close too bankruptcy what the fuck are you even pulling that idea from?
---
Flip of a coin, some say.
---
Recruiting for the vanguard
---
SHUT UP, BITCH
---
Mostly likely it's the marine combat helmet paint.
---
with seasons and fresh characters my complaints are null, just be patient :)
---
Tunnel snakes rule!
---
Took me about ~30 tries, hope this helps.
---
Haven‚Äôt noticed a decrease in legendaries but I have noticed the increase of every 3-Star dropping 1-Star pieces.
---
Hey OP we in West Viginia here boy. Its *color.
---
It doesn't matter, if it gets rushed it's gonna be broken. If we wait for it properly, it's broken anyway. What's the point in waiting? Release it and then we can report all the things that are wrong with it because the testing team leaves half the shit anyway
---
I need to recruit this beauty.
---
Kinda wished it was the was the mascot head instead, for extra funny.
---
Yes. so far as I know, mods attach without needing the card. A level 5 weaponsmith scope should be able to attach with no weaponsmith card.
---
Well bloodied and instigating can't be on the same weapon. 
---
Bloodied is more damage the lower your HP is.
---
Instigating does more damage on the first hit of an enemy at full health.
---
Then this isn't your game, plain and simple. Go play 1,2,3,NV, or 4. This is something different and that's okay.
---
So disregarding the OP for a second, does this work? I blocked a guy who was spawn camping recently, but saw no effect. This was on survival, so I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs different rules for blocking on the different modes, or if blocking someone doesn‚Äôt really stop them from from doing anything.
---
Yes everytime its crashed there was alot of smoke and often the smoke was pink and bugi.
---
I had shit weapons but I managed to get a couple of decent weapons: a TS AA Combat rifle, a TS Western Revolver and a bloodied super sledge.
---
But that was recent and weirdly enough they were all gotten within like 3 days of heavy farming in Watoga and Whitesprings.
---
cannot tell if you are sarcastic or not. the majority of pvp games have little to no risk involved. rainbow 6, destiny, csgo, you loose nothing upon death. so don't complain if people complain after being brainwashed to believe they can pvp with no loss. only games like rust have it right.
---
I didn‚Äôt see it as a promise, just a declaration of how thing would begin at launch. 
---
I‚Äôm not sick of micro transactions, what? I‚Äôve played lots of p2w and free games over time. Entertainment costs money, I spend money to be entertained. 
---
You didn‚Äôt pay AAA price for this game. Metroid was $90 for the NES and I bought that with money I made working at 9 years old. That‚Äôs a AAA price tag. Games are dirt cheap or free today. Games have never experienced inflation, they have only become cheaper. 
---
You want content? Embrace their crowdfunding operation they use to pay people‚Äôs salaries and keep the lights on and wait for their next awesome title.
---
fireproof perk, equip that shit
---
It literally told you it couldn't be placed. It means someone in that world has the same spot, and they got it first in that world. So yeah.
---
RNG is Random Number Generatior, referring to the random item that drops from the dead legendary. Power farming is done in any event that contains a high number of legendaries (whitesprings nuke zone, uranium fever, ect.)
---
Please don't change the voice, it is great as is. Actually if anything remove the warning altogether for extra fear inducing moments
---
Wasn't that level cap on the event recent though?
---
Fuck your dear Bethesda whining ass, it's just not your game
---
The helmet should beep when you get near some if that helps.
---
I see the pros for a mega-thread, but then you only get a small portion of the subreddit population commenting on a particular issue.
---
With separate threads, you then get feedback from people who would have never thought to go in the mega-thread. People who are browsing normally have valuable feedback.
---
We could probably go round and round all day on this as there are pros and cons to each method.
---
just stay away from train stations lol. survival is fun once you adjust your gameplay
---
What a joke. They did nothing wrong.
---
If Sentinel's works for you well that way, then that's your choice. I'm simply saying that most people will agree that Cavalier's is way better with melee. I don't get how you're arguing against that.
---
Once again, you're not addressing what I'm *actually* saying. I never said nonlegendary armor can't be really good. I'm simply saying that good legendary armor of trash types or levels is better.
---
I'm not talking about power armor either. I literally capitalized "Powered", with an -ed. What is your point, still? I still don't understand why you're even bringing up other legendary perks. We're talking Sentinel's vs Cavalier's for melee.
---

---
If it isn't instanced it is going to be a total disaster tommorow night
---
Perhaps if you are always in a coordinated group doing nukes, yes. But when I go to blast zones, even ones that I made, i can't get to the ferals in time to tag them because there is always a shock troop with a full group clearing them. I barely get any of the mats to make it. The raw stuff I can get with the green thumb perk but not the high radiation fluid nor the masses, at least not in bulk. It also doesn't make sense to me why a pre war item requires experimental materials that did not exist before in order to craft something that was commonly used in households to power them. Make it use uranium and gold and silver or something.
---
For maximum damage I would personally go 
---
+3 Incisor
---
+3 Martial Artist
---
+3 Iron Fist
---
+2 Gladiator
---
+2 Expert Gladiator
---
+2 Master gladiator 
---
Though personally I'm not a huge fan of the Meat Hook because it's base damage is still less than similar Unarmed weapons and those extra points in Gladiator can be put into Barbarian.
---
I am having problems with disconnects, but when it happens the problem is with my end since I can't even load Google when it disconnects. Other than that, the game's been running okay for me, and I use a low end laptop that doesn't even reaches the minimum requirement. 
---
A bit of a digression, while I don't share your sentiments about FO76, I am glad there are people that appreciared AoE2. It's a game that aged pretty well. Kinda hope it still have the popularity it had 15 years ago, but it's doing really well for such a old game.
---
atom shop paints make your suggestion null unfortunately. :( i like the idea tho
---
Thanks for the suggestions about locations guys, I appreciate it. Can I get someone to help me do a workshop though?
---
A coward dies a thousand deaths
---
Many different players can set up CAMPs on different servers in the same locations - you have to just keep taking the game‚Äôs offer to server hop and try your luck on another server until you find one that has a free spot for your CAMP.
---
Choosing to stay on a server despite another person having built on your CAMPsite in it causes it to be irrevocably packed up and blueprinted, but you can stay on that server and place it wherever else you like on the map as long as the space is free, or server hop until you find a free space where you were before and set up your whole CAMP there again.
---
Exactly. I was actually quite mad about it. I get that people normally one shot, (because TSE's and Bloodied builds are insane) but that was the strategy. Hit first and hit hard, gather your loot and run away before they come back lol 
---
I dont know, I haven't even thought about survival mode since the patch
---
&gt; We could probably go round and round all day on this as there are pros and cons to each method.
---
I'm not busy, wan't to just copy/paste what we've already said for a few hours?
---
Eyebot with radrats all the time in the Mire.
---
Yeah sneak perk and ultra light mod on all armor parts is also pretty good for sneaks
---
Uh oh, my house is literally ON TOP of that, I have a concrete extractor going and everything, I didn't think anything spawned there! LOL, What does it interfere with? Does it have anything to do with the random dead body that spawns on top of my roof every now and then?
---
Exactly and it stacks up! It won't complete four of them for me so it's 160 atoms! That's an item on the atom shop when it's on sale! Even if it's tiny.
---
That is utter bullshit, they said it will be cosmetic only and it should stay cosmetic only. If they wanted this to be a p2w or freemium game that should have been the model since day one. I paid triple a price I expect this game to be that. Bethseda doesn't have funding issues it has a disconnect from their community which is why it took them over half a year to get the game in a playable state. Stop enabling bad behavior because your a fan of the series you do a disservice to it.
---
I agree with all the negative comments so far
---
I've had "griefers" persistently follow me, randomly shoot me, in hopes that I'd fire back... I lead them to white springs and move near the robots and let the WS bots get em for me :P
---
I came looking for this kind of post today, because maybe I'm missing something? Or is someone exploiting something? Or do they have some sort of super weapons that are beefing them.
---
For example, yesterday I am working at my red rocket workshop, just gathering ore. Out of the blue this guy named Vermincide pretty much one shot kills me. I can't remember his level, but it was up there, like 80-120 range. Now I was under the impression that damage is super nerfed if you don't fight back, and I was killed with this explosive shot shot gun of his, I assume it's super powerful cause of all three shotty perks, plus explosive perk. But you be killed like that so fucking fast when in a Xo-1 PA is baffling. I didn't fight back until about the third time dude spawn killed me. I couldn't put a dent in the guy with any weapon, and with my melee I couldn't do a single drop of damage and my melee is my most powerful method of attack. I am still in awe about this.
---
This douche pickle was also doing the thing I saw others bitching about, had his lower level friend running with him to reset his wanted level. I could do a lot of damage to his friend, but dude and his weapon could stop any progress I could get against his friend. His buddy at lvl 70 something wasn't shit to worry about.
---
You know the worst part was? They acted like fortnite players. They just kept talking massive shit like they are good at the game or something, versus being two people against one guy, and they've figured out a build that does massive damage from a very powerful weapon they just happened to get lucky find, or they bought it from someone on the market.
---
It's didn't sour me from the game, just confirmed that there are a few really shitty attitude players running around griefing the fuck out of people who have some uber gear going on. 
---
Knowing that the market exists, I would not slide it past these two dipshits that they are paying to win, especially with such uber gear under level 100.
---
Yep, I get hella legendaries off of normal named enemies. I check everything I kill because of this.
---
I know, but for example, I understand that if you have adrenal reaction + bloodied, the bonuses are additive. Is it the same way with instigating + adrenal reaction when you attack someone with full health?
---
1. Get excavator PA
---
2. Just try again with workshops, i've never had any problems with that,people are mostly very nice. My main problem with workshops is that you lose them when the server disconnects, which happens a lot.
---
I don‚Äôt really understand. Do you think that spot is reserved for you on all servers or what??
---
Okay, then you probably already know about the perks that will help with that. You're going to have to wait until level 50 for Power User though.
---
It can't be placed. You just keep joining world's with your spot already taken. It's their spot on that world and they did nothing wrong, you did nothing wrong. You just got unlucky. Keep trying new worlds. There is a glitch I hope you do not encounter, it may have been fixed, but something in the camp would not place when joining and cause your camp to never place again. If your spot isn't taken and your camp does not spawn this may be the issue, but not in your current case. Good luck!
---
Yeah, they don't care what we want. Their focus is devising ways to get more money out of us. Making the game more fun by un-nerfing guns and fixing over powered enemies is not their goal.
---
Sorry, what do you mean?
---
First of all I'd recommend farming acid, you need a lot of it. Lead you can get from Lucky Hole Mine and one trip in excavator will give you more than you'll know what to do with. As for copper there are a lot of deposits around the Forest near the overseers camp and surrounding area. There are a lot of nodes dotted about. I know there are some near Welch, Harper's Ferry and Solomon's Pond to start. You don't need quite so much copper so it's easy to do the odd run.
---
Yes sir!
---
You can get to pretty high dmg with just Deathclaw gauntlet and iron fist, dont think its necessary to hit more than 1k dmg
---
That's not quite true.  I've stayed on servers when my camp couldn't be placed and it went back to where it was when I got to a server that would let it be placed.  It's only picked up and moved if you move your camp.  This happens to me a lot when I'm server hopping to get X-01 mods.
---
I purposely build in unnamed locations with bathrooms just because of this lmao
---
No need. Fermenting process isn't that long any way. You can even leave the fresh booze in your inventory for passive fermenting while you're doing other things.
---
It seems to me that they just make the hot spot for legendary spawns different on every server, so the usual spots aren't always lucrative to farm. Usually on servers where WS, harpers, and watoga are all crap I end up running into legendary enemies in random locations. Once I recall finding a pile of legendaries spawning in Flatwoods on one of these servers.
---
I think it's mostly about breaking up people's habits and making them vary their routine a bit more so they don't tire of the game.

I've been getting some pretty decent stuff lately. I got a two star bloodied +10% aiming damage harpoon gun from a two star super mutant that spawned near the big bend west tunnel yesterday, and a two star furious higher fire rate pipe rifle from the vendor nearby. Meanwhile there was nothing at any of the three hot spots on that server.
---
Using purified water for anything that requires boiled water would be great. Shit if the reason is it needs to be hot, let me boil my purified water.
---
I'm down
---
Probably. You can get the civil war reenactor, a crashed satellite, crashed vertibot, unexploded bomb, etc. at least 20 different random spawns. 
---
The clearing just past the gravel pit is the spawn point.
---
I've noticed that the higher I climb in level, the better my Legendary drops. I broke 200 last week and the drops have increased in the quality and quantity. Ymmv.
---
Incisor is propably better than a little faster swing or 5% more dmg in my opinion, atleast if you have rank 3 of Incisor
---
Tuffen up butter cup. You dont die in RL if some one shoots you in the pixels.

This is as close to a radio station as it's going to get. With the 76 dwindling player count, I doubt they're going to dump more resources into something like this.
---
Good post , wish I could upvote more.
---
Gotta farm Yao guai
---
I think that is the worst Happy Gilmore impersonation ever other then that no crime has been committed.
---
Omg. Somebody who doesn‚Äôt play. Get lost üòÇ
---
It is my game because I paid for it. There was zero benefit to that person destroying my camp except a temper tantrum in a sandbox. I lost resources and gained 50 caps. Please go back to survival mode, internet troll.
---
Ah, it‚Äôs never happened like that for me - what I wrote was just based on my own experience. If I‚Äôve chosen (usually by accident) to stay on a server when my CAMP can‚Äôt be placed there, it doesn‚Äôt give me the option to keep it on that site regardless - it just says I can hop servers or place my CAMP elsewhere on that or any other servers I join for free. Even if I haven‚Äôt moved my CAMP site yet, hopping to a server where that space is free doesn‚Äôt generate my CAMP there again.
---
I run a heavy weapon build and have since beta. I would say they have definately improved, though the plasma gatling is one I generally avoid, though that is just personal preferance, I dont like the spin up and I find the recoil a little hard to manage at any real range, but they are viable weapons. I find the 50 cal to work the best in most situations
---
there is a poster for big cheif explosive rounds
---
Exactly! lets focus on the real topics like these repair kits. Now let me tell you why they are bad for the game in 5000 words or more.
---
S.A.M.E twice.
---
You have no idea how livid I was.
---
&gt;if you plan your character there is no advantage in having level greater than 50
---
.....as long as you make a terrible plan for your character.
---
Tip: Not all good cards are unlocked long enough before 50 for you to upgrade them properly.
---
‚ÄúWell I‚Äôve been having trouble attaching a mod, but since I don‚Äôt read anything, I thought I‚Äôd come to reddit. I‚Äôve heard it works like quora. You ask a question and then hundreds of people will be at your beck and call then you go away again.‚Äù
---
;-)
---
I don't mind it. It's just a post.
---
Thanks!! I thought that with instigating maybe it was:
---
weapon damage * (100% + adrenal reaction)* 2
---
Which would make it higher than with bloodied. But thanks for clearing that up!
---
I'm not saying it's bad. I would obviously not buy it if I wouldn't like it. It's just broken.
---
That's so awesome!!!
---
I just had my first tse black powder 3* drop from the Sheepsquatch - I'm lvl 206 :)
---
Weird.  I've probably stayed on servers where it couldn't be placed 100 times since that update and no issues with it placing on the next server where it's placeable.
---
Right. I get that. But I respawn at the spawn point for the event and have to run across the field and regrab the pylon, which no one usually grabs after I die. I did this about 4 or 5 times in the last event I did, which meant the pylon was not activated in the time it takes me to run up the hill and across the field. 
---
The best I ever did as a conduit was staying by my pylon spamming stims, another player rezzed me twice and stayed nearby protecting me. So there was no break in the activation.
---
In all seriousness, it has started becoming the hip new place for people who work in DC to live.
---
I wish the announcer for the nuke was that robotic male voice from the weather channel West Virginians had growing up.  Then he could follow up with giving the weather forecast for the next 36 hours
---
IGN rjcantu I‚Äôll help you out.
---
You get told it's not a circle jerk as they repeat yt videos click bait titles. The games not perfect. It's though hard to take anyone serious when they spout random "facts" that's happened to them without any evidence.
---
Nope. Instigating Flesh Light
---
Someone did the math and determined that the vast majority of legendary drops are either armor or melee weapons. I've found half a dozen amazing power fists alone but only two or three comparable 3 star guns. I actually ended up respeccing into unarmed because that's the only weapon type I was getting lucky drops for.
---
You can join the world where your camp can‚Äôt be placed do a vendor run, quest, event etc without needing to move your camp and just use the workbenches around the map then when you log off and join another server that has the spot free your camp will be loaded into the world in that spot as normal. Sometimes choosing the ‚Äújoin another world‚Äù option puts you back on the same server and you end up with repeated notifications your camp cannot be placed so just join the world, leave, and then log back in again if you get repeated warning
---
Uh I don‚Äôt see any repair kits anywhere. Your hypotheticals, even based on what they said in one post a month ago, and virtually worthless.
---
Likely as farm hands for C.A.M.P.s that can automatically store crops into the stash
---
My friend and I have noticed that since about two patches ago Legendary spawns at Whitespring and West Tek have seemed to decrease massively.
---
Row row row your boat.. looks like a good time. I'll bring the beer and mutt chops.
---
Dwindling player count? Wut?
---
There good ones, but we get caught up with bad ones too. They game us renaming, and we start a whole thread because we have to push an extra button now. It literally takes like 3 extra seconds of your time. Once people get used to is it‚Äôll be fine. There definitely needs to be a large weekly discussion thread for small stuff like this.
---
Not gonna lie I got insane drops off of the event 3x in a row but it was pure luck. My friends have gotten trash.
---
Oh, of course
---
Did they fix the hit detection on it?
---
V(-_-)V It‚Äôs probably some unhelpful glitch on my end, then - I legitimately thought it was the game‚Äôs mechanic! It‚Äôs never happened any other way. OP, ignore the part of my post where I said about CAMP placement if you stay on a server where it can‚Äôt be placed, but don‚Äôt try placing it elsewhere for free.
---
Sweet gonna get one now also found out that lmg is also heavy pretty great day.
---
The damage you're getting from Adrenal should be calculated right into your base damage on the weapon card.
---
The main quest missions are a distant memory at this point. They don‚Äôt need to be too involved, most will only play them once or twice.
---
You can get them from BOS event quests or treasure maps. I only have a handful of parts and will need to trade for the rest.
---
We'll see soon enough if you guys are really listening wont we.
---
Your camp exists on your server while you are there. If you join a server and someone happens to be in the same spot, then your camp does not materialize. If you go to a different server, then they won‚Äôt be there and your camp will reappear- unless there is a third person on the same spot.
---
i notice sometimes the robots in watoga spawn out of the machine already dead
---
I would absolutely love a pay service that got more song licensing for the fallout IP and allowed us to enjoy the music both in and out of game.
---
Personally I want new artists making fallout themed 40s/50s music as well to break away from some of the golden oldies that are like over 175 years old at this point in the timeline.
---
My camp is under the bridge outside Harpers Ferry, besides the time a Mothman tried to kill me it has been delightful.T he Supermutants are great neighbors, they bring gifts like free ammo, mutant hound meat, and love to set off the traps on the bridge.
---
I believe so, I didnt have one until after they rebalanced heavy weapons,  but I haven't noticed any hit detection issues on it
---
I thought atomic shop only did skins?
---
You do realize there is risk to both sides right?  If you engage that person you can still die and give that person caps on top of it.
---
I‚Äôm tired of &lt;insert name of most developers today&gt; please listen! Or Just hear me out... posts.
---
TSE are rare. Most who have one got it from a duper who sold them. Don't focus on that. Since the nerf they aren't all that powerful. Many other versions do as well as the TSE.  TS AA is one that is highly desired.  
---
Find a TS that better fits your style or build, and rock with it. And a proper modded non legendary weapon is not gimped or useless. They still get the job done.
---
I never actually server hop to find things like this. I would just hit the bunker every time I log in, and eventually I got the jetpack mod. I actually have such a large number of xo1 mods it's ridiculous, and now that I finally have enough stable flux to do some of these mods it turns out I need specific perks to be able to do it and it doesn't tell you which perks you need.
---
No thank you. I have no interest in survival.
---
Anyone who's a relaxed player who isn't about constant shooting (i.e. PVP) should add me.  None of my current friends play Fallout 76 because they can't see the fun in it.  These are the types of guys who think anything that isn't an FPS is a waste of time, and not even really a "game."
---
I really need some 76 friends. I'm 36 and a very relaxed gamer who just likes to play and build and grind. TaienV on PC. PM me first so I accept the request :)
---
Eh..flash light?
---
Well that makes complete sense...Super Mutant Warlords=People from DC!
---
I think the only one I have experienced was during the beta. I was crossing the savage divide near the A.T.L.A.S. Observatory.
---
Did you get the wedding ring?
---
I'd like to politely disagree with what you have said about the bugs. As a player that have played since B.E.T.A, I can tell that the game improves vastly since then. While Bethesda add new contents, they definitely did not ignore the QoL part of the game.
---
I am in no position say too much about the camp bug though. My camp is a two level shack which I didn't really bothered with for the past 3 momths other than adding some decorations. However, the changes that affects my camps are all positive. The two main ones are grass no longer clipping through the floor and the damn turrets actually shooting at things. But I have heard a lot of problem other people have on building, so you're probably right.
---
Can't say much for your connection problem, I think this is different for everyone. Some people have the game running smooth as butter while others can't even load the game.
---
I am sorry you couldn't get into the game, however I don't think I can agree with your main argument. Perhaps it's just because that the bugs that affected me are fixed, while the ones that affected by you still remains. Different people play the game differently, so they are affected by different parts of the game. 
---
Again, that's all my personal opinion, I'm not saying that you must like the game, I'm just speaking from my own experience.
---
But you got it. You pick the fights you want. Some other people just wanting to steamroll everything and complain once there is a challenging mob that they have problems with. And they're too loud in this sub, ruining all the challenges in game.
---
Like the new sheepsquatch event. It's easy if you know how to play, it's hard if you don't.
---
I think at this point the primary complaints come from players who have some bugs they just can't stand, players who don't like the game's systems (SPECIAL cards, etc), and players who don't want to look for notes/terminals/etc and only want the game's story dictated to them by questgivers.
---
The latter two are never going to be satisfied by this game, because the storytelling is about 80% environmental and the game's systems aren't going to change that radically.
---
lol let's just pretend we did that and we can come back here when we think of something new - just not in a separate post of course xD
---
Just made my 200th this weekend.  I'll let you know if I concur.
---
Good.
---
No thank you. I'm not interested in the Mode.
---
That's the thing is even when there are low level mole miners she's at level 54
---
Thanks! I'll check that today.
---
Could be a bug.  I know they force you to move if your in a place they have reserved for future content but that's it.  Next time it happens stay on the server then hop and see if it places properly.  If it doesn't submit a bug report to Bethesda.
---
At least you are able complete the overseer's mission. I've listened to all the holotapes a dozen times, and still can't get it to  finish out.
---
Yes it‚Äôs true, I watched the FO76 panel at Bethesda Game Days streamed on twitch and Todd Howard himself said it was instanced. He said in house there were massive ques to get in so they had to instance it to the player and not the server.
---
Not sure how much a power attack is, I think 50% more.  Most damage formulas are the same as FO4 though, check out the FO4 wikis, they may have the formulas for it. 
---
Suppressors is a whole different thing though. Suppressor is just the -20% damage dealt by the target, it by itself has nothing to do with increasing your damage in any way.
---
The 40% power attacks is a secondary effect, they aren‚Äôt named in 76 (except for weird instances where they didn‚Äôt fix the naming rules, some armor will show as ‚Äúacrobats‚Äù (a tertiary effect) or ‚Äúpoisoners‚Äù/‚Äúpowered‚Äù (secondary effects) depending on what the primary effect is.
---
No they are a broken mess. They are hit scan as of now and the rifles barrel shots are invisible but make a red laser hit on contact with the enemy.  With a new core it will spin up and shoot one shot then make you let off the trigger and re spin up. If you have any partially used cores it will use those first but display a full core so it will just randomly deplete without warning.
---
Yeah I tried but it doesn't work
---
Hey, are you also aware that the commands (buttons) are backwards during the message when you try and scrap a favorited item?
---
Funny thing is I'm in a timezone where the updates come through at about 2am my time, so when I'm awake there's usually already posts on reddit about what's new, or newly broken. It's bloody funny to read all the day at work. So 12hrs later I roll in for my gaming session, and go 'Ah, that's where the bridge disappears while you walk over it. Jetpack at the ready' and yet for the next week or so on reddit, 'Omg. Bridge disappears! Do I re-install fo76?'
---
*sighs*
---
I have it on most of my pa , it does often allow a moment to stimpack up. Although a ridiculous op melee or bloodied 50 cal can eat right through it
---
It's at a point it should have been since day 1. It's just frustrating that for every step forward it's 2 steps back
---
That's would be cool, but we would have to get on the same server
---
Real world if a nuclear strike was inbound they wouldn‚Äôt tell you where it was landing because odds are it‚Äôs the first of a barrage.
---
I do too, and always take pictures for my loading screens. Only interesting things I've found so far are blocks that spell out "REDRUM", and for some reason two power armor frames standing on top of a **bush**. Must have been a strong bush.
---
I kind of hope they make it immune to AI damage as well because every time I log in I have to take down at least 5 scorched. They‚Äôre all relatively low level but they‚Äôre annoying as hell.
---
As someone who has posted a suggestion before during the Friday rush, I'd love one of these because even good suggestions and asks get absolutely buried in a matter of minutes. Ditto a /separate/ one for bug reports, same reason. Seems like it would make things much easier for devs if they're trying to keep up with all of them, too.
---
Please is an act of Nicely asking. There isn't anything wrong with saying please. Some people find it irritating due to lack of understanding. Some do not mind but instead accept it because they can understand that they are being honest and kind about it.
---
Last night was my first encounter with a pair of sub lvl 100s with explosive shot guns who lit my camp up and could one shot kill me without me even fighting back.
---
After getting killed twice in camp, once by surprise, the second right when I spawned, I just left and hopped servers.
---
Personal flair doesn‚Äôt check out.
---
Tse's aren't the best anymore. Level 165 here and never found one. 4 explosive weapons and maybe a dozen 2 shots in all that time. Really the power is in the perks. 
---
As far as legendary enemies go keep track of where you see them.  They each time you load in check the location. 
---
I ran uranium fever a lot. Most of my best stuff came from there even if it's a bit underleveled.
---
The repair kit debacle really pissed off some people, there's only 181k subs to this reddit after 6-ish months (and it was at about 150k when the game launched and compared to Apex, at 750K within 2 months), I only ever enter into servers with \~10 other people, and I haven't seen nukes launched nearly as much within the past month.
---
Is power user the perk that makes fusion cores drain slower?
---
Thanks. Not that I was gonna change mine, but I hadn't heard anything about it with 76 yet. Some of my friends got royally fucked changing there ID's in other games.
---
Guys, you're doing adventure mode workshops all wrong.
---
Adventure mode workshop tutes step 1-5
---
1. Find a workshop you like.
---
2. Start taking that workshop.
---
3. Block every single person on the map. every. Single. One.
---
Secret 4th step. Profit. Also, block. every. Single. Dot. You. See.
---
5. Never leave you shop. You live here now.
---
I'm only mostly joking.
---
I do. You might fail sneak check against your perception and they'll notice you. What you do influences your sneak value. Shooting does. Shooting silenced weapons does much less.
---
You'll need to experiment to find the sweet spot that allows you to move and fire while remaining undetected. This holds true both for PvE and PvP.
---
Weren't you aware of this when you tested the... actually never mind.
---
What platform you on?
---
Slap damage is gone, camps will soon be invulnerable. idk what else you want, with the game being like that, and being in passive mode, you will never have to pvp again unless you take a workshop.
---
Also griefers suck, I get that, but it's just a part of the game. Best way to deal with a griefer? hop server.
---
I HAVE been playing. Maybe not as much as a lot of other people but I reached level 80. I stopped because I ran out of interesting things to do and refuse to play until we get confirmation the kits won't be available for real cash. Stop being a goddamned child with that "doesn't play" bullshit.
---
I just walk in there and point at him and tap on A until he listens to me. I have sat in there for three or four minutes before to get my damn mission to pop for the Daily. If I can only get the Nuka dark recipe I would completely stop doing these. I've got all the others.
---
It would help to provide a platform. :)
---
Congrats. I tried to launch one on PC Friday night with a few people, but couldn't get passed the repair the pipes stage.  The server seemed to be lagging badly...like time ran out before it realized they were all repaired.
---
Time will tell.
---
Whole place is on edge waiting to see how repair kits are handled.
---
I can give you a hand.  I'm usually online after 8:30 PM EST.  Gamertag is glenn4moose
---
Never have i upvoted a post so fast in my life before.
---
It's not to bad since they nerfed the cap loss. If you are at level 60 and die you lose like 20 caps. The challenges have been pretty easy the last two weeks.  I got the new lever action in about an hour and a half.
---
Was gonna offer to help you build your bed and breakfast but saw that you're on PC. Love building places, got a bangin raider bar right now you can see on my profile.
---
I find it hard to sympathize with  you
---
My bad guys, XB1
---
Well, honestly, about 2/3 of the players in the event have no idea what is going on. Many are shooting while the shield is up, rather than destroying the extra bots, some are running around bag stealing, and some are just there for the loot and do nothing. The best ones I am in are where someone dies and is immediately replaced as the conduit. When the squatch is invulnerable they destroy the bomb bots and others. When the shield drops, the amount of damage is epic. Unfortunately those events are few and far between. So, yes there is a gap, but if everyone cooperated someone should immediately reactivate the pylon.
---
Depends on the build I am melee and when I get board I will destroy all the robots in White Spring
---
They're not in the Atom Shop because they haven't been officially released yet, moron. And no, they're NOT worthless. This is how things can go down if they're implemented as they were announced. You are the kind of person I made this post for. People that don't look at the bigger picture and only focus on "right this second" and "does this affect me personally".
---
Sheepsquatch is easier than assaultrons, change my mind. 
---
I've had two runs at the sheepsquatch event, both went great and I'm level 35. I feel like I was actually contributing, especially since I could man the pylons even though I'm not doing a ton of damage to sheepsquatch.
---
Degenerates like you belong on a cross.
---
Mutation perks don‚Äôt work at all been a big since day 1
---
It hasn't moved fast and it hasn't really changed and it doesn't take a lot of resources. Few (if any) of these OP players are using much by way of chems, bobbleheads etc. (source: I kill them and check their bags). It's almost entirely the sentinel or cavalier + assassin armor effects, plus perks like Serendipity and in some cases Dodgy. Once you've tested sentinel you can see immediately that even without assassin's it makes you nigh on invincible to conventional ballistic attacks \*until you're staggered\* (hence people also add a pneumatic torso mod).
---
Well with these so called repair kits idk they might go back on their word and add other stuff. Although they could add a skin like the deliverer to the 10mm pistol, but people may still see that as pay to win.
---
On the one hand, people really should search before posting. On the other hand, this sub has 10 fucking mods that don't do any actual moderation. They could easily create a "Weekly feedback, issues, and bugs" post, delete all the redundant bullshit, and point people there.
---
Heck ,they could probably automate 90% of it by picking keywords for whatever the hot topic of the week is (repair, bench, etc) and have automod remove the posts for them.
---
Also, don't fast travel.
---
Like I'll start at Big Bend East and make my way through the Bog/Watoga in a big circle hitting outer Watoga all the way to Glassed Caverns then looping back and clearing Watoga proper.
---
I give it a try one last time then.
---
They've already said how it'll work. Purchasable in the Atom Shop. One-time use. Repair without a workbench or materials. There's no faulty or incomplete information.
---
Yes, and Batteries Included makes them weigh less.
---
Just so you know if you invest in getting nuka grape and the respective perk you can heal radiation without losing your mutations, i have been using that up untill i got starched genes and it has been pretty good
---
There was no wrong doing in that video. Just some annoying player commentary and an annoying kid who didn't get the point and leave. They even told the kid to go away and TBH they took it easy on the kid and gave plenty of chances to leave.
---
This isn't griefing and kids shouldn't play 76 because they can't handle PvP (also rated M) seriously not every wastelander wants to be your friend or will be nice. PvP will happen it's part of the game. This wasn't even bad or close to "griefing".
---
Now go home son your Mamma's waiting for you.
---
I do wish there was more types of severe weather, and it happened more often.  Any add a weather reporter that would alert you of incoming severe weather that could hurt you, so you would have a minute or two to plan how to deal with it.
---
Thank you for the communication!
---
Before someone is going to say "it shows Bethesda is incompetent at fixing problems that exist since launch", he most likely means the more inconsequential ones, like photos at camp and new songs to the radio.
---
dude filter them out. its the best solution...
---
... there was a wedding ring??? *sprints back to the house.
---
Grounded isn't effected by Perks/Effects for whatever reason.
---
The Slow Cooker Perk also adds damage, and in my mind grenades wouldn't have too long a cook time anyways, say 4 seconds at base. 50%= 2, and + 4 = 6. So, say you hold it for 4 seconds on a throwable that does 100 damage. That's 140 damage, a decent increase from the former 100.
---
As for the timer, I mentioned it'd be better a UI popup to appear while cooking a grenade. There's little reason for such a small thing to take up a perk slot.
---
I tried of post like these..if folks want to say something they can.
---
You do not need to read them.
---
Need more info. So is this only a go if there's enough people? If someone fronts 200 caps is that two times? If the event needs to be server hopped to get, what then?
---
What device?
---
Just capture workshops and do the defend events. If you do ones with other people just hide out and wait for the event to end and then get the heck outta there. 
---
I did the racetrack workshop a bunch of times. Just leave the server and log back in. Capture it, defend it (takes like 2 minutes for the prompt), log out, rinse and repeat.
---
You can server hop at belching betty too.  Tends to have a PA frame/PA every 5th log in for me.
---
Damn thanks for reminding me! ps4
---
It does do that. At best, you could rig it to a pressure plate to go off.
---
The X01 mods should require any materials to attach them however since the last update you haven't been able to apply mods to PA. Well in some cases you can but it's sketchy. It's probably to do with the new stash transfer mechanism.
---
Oh I‚Äôm Xbox. Dang.
---
At the moment there is a bug and with the bug you cant install mods to any weapon armor or power armor.
---
When I look at the statue I see a screen full of purple for a few seconds. (PC no mods)
---
Omg i would nut for an instigating dragon!
---
I wish I could hook up with a few decent older guys or girls. The problem is, every team invite I get is from a kid looking to start problems with others. And the one time I did hooked up with a younger guy he put a huge swastika on the front of his camp, and was rambling on about stupid shit, or wouldn't talk for hours even if I tried to make conversation with him. I just gave up trying.
---
Do you mean you get 4 ore for every press of collect button, or just that each node lets you press the collect button 4 times?
---
A succinct description would have been more apt
---
I play sneak with escape artist and chameleon armor. It works wonders. I only have 1 mk3 stealthboy in my inventory for the real "oh holy shit!" moments.
---
Yes, I understand why someone decides to rage on another‚Äôs camp. What I don‚Äôt understand is how some people have this happen an a regular basis (like the op) vs someone who has never had a problem (like me). 
---
If we can figure out what‚Äôs different, we can offer some other advice to people that are experiencing this. Maybe it‚Äôs location, maybe it‚Äôs size or visibility of camps. Hell, I stay crouched at my camp as much as possible so people can‚Äôt stare at the map and figure out where I am... maybe that‚Äôs a solution.
---
I heard one when I was in a basement in Summerville last night, so I ran outside real quick and as soon as I crossed the door threshold, it instantly disappeared. =/
---
Xbox over here! I follow the rules of engagement. Gave a few guns and complete leather armor to level 5s and killed a few that continued to atack after warning shots. Could do with a crew that actually sticks around.
---
Are you strong enough to run through the silos? I don't use fusion cells, but I spam the collect button to pick up everything and usually end up dumping 300-400 rounds after each silo run. Given that the robots continue to respawn you could theoretically farm them for as long as you want.
---
Man don‚Äôt throwaway fuel. Someone is definitely going to want it. You‚Äôre not on ps4 or I‚Äôd buy it.
---
Lvl 40 moles
---
Yes, just like bloodied. But then instigating + adrenal reaction does provide more damage if the enemy has full health. Say (100% + adrenal reaction + bloodied) vs ((100% + adrenal reaction)*2). If weapon damage =10 and we consider max bloodied and adrenal damage: 30 (booodied) vs 40 (instigating).
---
The man said what he said.

I have time tomrrow

Clean ranger outfit, clean ranger hat and wraparound goggles.

I knew of the repercussions but decided to try and tempt fate. So far so good that this the only game ive found something happen. What games did your buddies get screwed in ?
---
Sounds like instead of changing the PSN ID, PS is just making a new account. If it was the same account anything that's cloud saving should still be there even if its not using a Sony service.
---
I just built my house by whitesprings and no issues. I'm away from my PC but I will check later today to see what my settings are. I went from 2x 980's and man was sli problematic in most games. I don't know if that has changed in the recent cards but that's why I suggested that first.
---
Both.  4 per press of collect and some nodes go up to 5 presses.  So 20 ore on a single node.
---
Last week, when one of the daily challenges was killing fireflies, my wife and I decided to camp the lighthouse to see if any would spawn for us (they didn't). While we were waiting we saw two rad storms off on the horizon to the southeast around Summerville, then after they'd dissipated we saw a third form over Monongah. Just a couple days earlier I'd run into one on my way to see Biv for my daily booze quest. Maybe the frequency has been increased?
---
Probably not, I just reached level 45
---
If you don't want PvP, don't take workshops.
---
Agreed if you differentiate death bags from discarded loot.
---
When do you whant to the dungeon and whats your GT
---
I once vats melee‚Äôd a turret where the workbench is and ended up in the ceiling
---
Just make more.
---
Sweet, now remove fuckin Flux from Tick Blood Tequila.
---
Bethesda puts so much work into PA skins and they don't realize that adding just solid colors like black and red that it'll sell out. Like hell, add all the colors. Plus, doing this will allow more people to focus on bugs and future content rather then the atomic shop. But yeah I agree with you, I'm just hoping this gets on the front page of the subreddit.
---
Thank you so much for your thoughtful and insightful response.
---
Link is blocked in the EU. Yay.
---
Thanks for the clarification. I have been bewildered since getting my Excavator armor months ago because I never seem to notice a ton of ore. I am certain that I only get 1 ore per press, but I'll have to retest tonight to make sure I didn't accidentally have the helmet off or something.

What?! They worked for me. I did an enclave event for one of mine, and I'm pretty sure it counted. And I know for a fact that Workshop Defense events work. They were literally 3 of my last 5. Although I did own the the workshops.
---
I'm a liar. It's a.38 reciever
---
From my cold, dead hands.  
---
But seriously, when it dropped I was showing it off to everyone.
---
I had this issue myself. Only solution was to move my camp a few inches, costed me 160 caps. Won't make that mistake again.
---
Hmm, it might be worth trying anyway. The first section is usually just waves of level 8 Mr Handy bots, level 30 robobrains, and the occasional level 50 gutsy. Heck, as long as you're not carrying a bunch of junk there's no real penalty for dying, so if you've done the enclave quests and can get in it's worth a shot.
---
These are literally against the "Bethesda Please" rules. 
---
Report them, the mods should remove them
---
Its not an MMO , and All MMO's have end game CONTENT. 
---
With all the bugs ,,, its definitely broken.
---
I had something similar the other day. I was at my workshop minding my own business and some douche just comes in and starts blowing everything up. I got him down to a sliver but for some reason he wouldn't go down. He actually just stood there for a while doing nothing then two shots I was dead in my x-01 PA. I gave up after 2 attempts to get it back and just went over to a new workshop. He then kept following me around the map killing me every time. I just logged out at that point.
---
yeah there was some odd "lord of the flies" shit going on there, had to unsubscribe
---
I wouldn't say nobody - there's a whole line of perks that give benefits to people you revive (or when you are revived yourself).
---
Don't mistake that for me saying its common, it's just not "nobody".
---
I had held off on launching a nuke for a long time. Until biv gave me the quest to craft some tick blood tequila. Needed some stable crimson flux. So figured that day was the day to launch a nuke. Went through all that successfully to end up server hopping to get tick blood.
---
Naww  so cute! üòçüòª
---
They should definitely reappear when you log in and take over the workshop again, 100%
---
Probably had my best run with randoms last Friday night.  I was holding 2 pylons towards the end and the SS's health was quite low and I went down.  I never call for help, just wait to bleed out.  A lower level player (30ish) comes and stands next to me and I figure they are there to grab loot sack when I'm ragdoll, but right before I time out, they stim me up and we finish a few seconds later.  Heads up play by everyone.  Crappy rewards as usual, but it was fun because almost everyone knew what was happening and did their job.
---
Still better than bloodied...
---
We have been farming it a lot anyway. This idea occurred to me as a way to afford further farming , and also help players that are struggling with it at an affordable cost. I don't want to hold up paying customers by waiting for big numbers. 
---
Within our own ranks we started pitching in on the cost to help each other not go broke. Yes we will have to do some server hopping to get it at times( that horrible cool down).  But other than that we will be farming it once an hour , maybe twice an hour if needed . No minimum number for participation.
---
That may be just fine, as long as the legendary vendor doesn‚Äôt take atoms/tokens that can be bought with atoms. If that‚Äôs the case, not only does the game become pay to win, but not nearly as fun to play. There will be no more reason to try your luck hunting legendaries, and no reason to spend time trying to build the optimal combination when some twerp can just pay to be decked out in all the best possible legendary gear.
---
I think what's most annoying is "Bethesda, give us x already" 
---
I mean, if you're being so demanding, just become a developer yourself and apply to Bethesda? 
---
I think it's not fair to them for people to demand things that most likely only a handful of people may think is a good thing to add.
---
Those posts are the main thing I look for, so I can upvote good suggestions in the hope of making them more visible to redditors and Bethesda. The game needs a ton of work, even though I love it.
---
What point in the quest are you at?

With fusion cores it's 100% easier to just take the power plants. You get 12 of them every 15 minutes, and all you have to do is stop by and pick them up.
---
You can make a case for lead ore, because there aren't a ton of ways to get it, but yeah... requires a lot of acid, and acid farming is about the dullest activity in game.
---
Another thing - the amount of resources you get from workshops, with the exception of the fusion core generators, is pretty dismal. They should be highly desirable since they're pvp hotspots. Hemlock holes isn't even very good, when you consider that you get 30 acid from it every what, 30 minutes? And I can farm 20 acid per run form toxic larry's, which takes all of 2-3 minutes per run when you count in reloading / server hopping.
---
We know where to find them. Where the fusion generators are, where the power armor spawns are. Which enemies drop them.
---
We also take over power plants. Drop a fusion generator down and skip the powering up.
---
delet this
---
No sir or ma'am  I'm really that dumb lol. I thought you were someone talking shit who dont play 76 is what i meant. Not like your a BGS shareholder!
---
I wish. I bought one a week ago from the Watoga vendor, since then I've had three drop in SBQ fights. Way to rub salt in the wound RNGods!
---
That's good news then
---
I am working on making a raider bar out of my C.A.M.P. on pc I can make road leathers that's about as much still have yet to find raider armor blueprints too. Gosh I would LOVE to see more raider style things added to the game. Need more raider style things for my C.A.M.P.
---
Yeah dont worry, new stuff brings assholes who got bored back, then they leave again. Good luck out there, dont let others ruin your fun. I'll keep an eye out for you.
---
Something seems inherently broken about the game when Power Armor is not effective for PvP.
---
I suspect not (disability acts generally cover necessities and services, and generally don't cover option/entertainment items last I heard), but that said, if they already have the script for everything written down, it's not much more work to slam out a subtitle system for it.
---
According to the wiki a power attack is 150% more damage so 40% more on top if that would be 190% damage which means my power attacks are doing 427.5 damage versus normal which is 225 damage. Not bad.
---
This has the potential to force PvP on someone who just had the misfortune of dying.
---
I have seen you comment on multiple other threads, and while I see where you're coming from, I am sorry to say that I think you missed the main point. What everyone is tired of is people suggesting things that won't impact the game much and requires a disproportionate effort from Bethesda. 
---
Take the camp photo for example. It will be cool and all, yes, but it will require Bethesda to store the photos on the server side. As if the game isn't already laggy enough, this will burden the server even further. Not worth it for just cosmetic purposes.
---
Let's look at another example. New songs to radio stations. It will be cool and all if Bethesda can do it, but song licenses don't come cheap. And does it affect the gameplay in anyway? Not really. A few new songs to the game isn't going to prevent anyone from quitting the game, because it doesn't really affect the game itself.
---
Ultimately, we are annoyed not just because of the repetition, but because of the pure ridiculousness of some of the posts. A lot of these are just good to have, but ultimately pointless. Funny enough, bigger issues like weapon balancing don't get brought out that often compared to these suggestion. People do mention them, yes, but it doesn't garner as much attention as the 100th post about being able show off your photos in xamp. I love the idea of course, but I seriously think there are bigger priorities that deserve more attention.
---
Well, from what I've heard and understand, your PSN ID is also your account number. Now, they've given us the option of changing it.. We all new it was going to be fucked up.
---
i'm hoping its just temporary, i mean if you want pvp madness there's a mod for that, if your in adventure you shouldn't be thinking shoot first then loot the corpse
---
I always take pictures with them so all my loading screens are awesome.
---
I get it! But I also understand that people want to express their feelings or Ideas as well. I think the problem here is a lot of people think this the official Bethesda reddit page. Apposed to it being the Fallout 76 community with a few great Administrators, that work for Bethesda, and  volunteer there time trying to relay issues and concerns to the Dev team. Maybe some one needs to address this problem in a post explaining the difference and where to go for proper feedback!
---
AND you'll let people know you have an unhealthy addiction to Fallout!
---
Note: Would not be a new thing for many though....rofl
---
I don't have mic, but you can add me and I'll get you through all the key fragments. It kind of only gets worse, so I'll help lol.

Come to my camp, then I'll fast travel to where you need to go to save you caps.

No worries. I was hooding you were correct. This topic has been heavily debated since the beta.

---
Set up your camp on an acid resource. I have mine on the cliffs east of Yellow Sandy's. Every time you go back to camp, you'll have 10 acid. You'll be swimming in it in no time. (Although I don't recommend actually swimming in it.)
---
If you claim your bag it doesnt flag you. Only the person that takes the bag.
---
The game has gotten better with every patch, with the exception that a new patch tends to un-fix things that were fixed in previous patches, then has a bit of turnaround before they revert those fixes. Aside from some of them being particularly annoying, they‚Äôre easy enough to tolerate and work around in the short-term while you wait. I think by the time the next expansion rolls out they‚Äôll have a lot more sorted permanently
---
I just got done reading a post about someone talking about how they take advantage of people in workshops, and how Power Armor is a death trap. Someone if you decide to take a workshop, you should be outfitted for PvP. 
---
So my only thought is that there is something inherently wrong with PvP when PA isn't effective.
---
Just cut the chase and slap an anti material rifle with explosive rounds in game and watch everyone get an 8 hour erection....
---
\&gt;    Have tried various pieces fo SA and CA but never had a full set. 
---
It basically doesn't work until you have the full set. I don't know what voodoo math is behind this, but I've tested with 3 and 4 pieces and the effects are greatly reduced. Just to give you some perspective, it takes around 5 shots to kill me with no armor, 8 to 10 with a great set of high-DR armor with bolstering and vanguard effects, a similar number for full assassins or three or four sentinel pieces, and then ... add the fifth sentinel piece ... and I take virtually zero damage until I'm staggered, so it often takes someone with Tank Killer half to a full drum clip from a handmade. I would suggest working toward the full set of SA or CA - and don't bother with trying to get top-tier stuff - find someone trying to offload their Ghoul Slayer's with +1 charisma or whatever.
---
Those muties are getting smart. Luring us there with the internet.
---
You dont need to have any technical knowledge to leave the map. To find stuff that shouldnt be accessed yet you just need to give it time and do some exploring, lol. And this is a game that was released full price... It‚Äôs so poor and devs are truly doing a horrendous job on this project. Thus the delays for everything now.
---
\*Unless\* you're holding a pylon. Then it's best to wait out the death timer, because you still count as holding the pylon during that entire time.
---
Happened to me too turned out to just be the feral dogs
---
I've got such creative names for mine....
---
!excavator
---
!X-01
---
!ultracite
---
!T-series
---
I ran out of creative names after naming my lever action ~Abroham Lincoln Repeater.
---
German here, sorry but what does instanced mean in regards of the new content or the game in general?
---
awww fat rip man! mine was a SBQ drop too
---
This has been happening to all my missions lately. I'll switch servers and it will usually pop back up.
---
Lol let‚Äôs hope that confirmation comes soon, you could be playing without repair kits Right Now! üòÄ My advice. Wait a year or two, just to be sure.
---
shhh stop telling all my secrets!!!!!
---
Personally i suggest going to some of the communities in your respective console and buying a half decent legendary from someone else to help you farm for the good ones easier. And trust me spending caps to get legendaries from other players is worth it in my opinion cause ive gotten alot better in the game ever since i spent about 500 caps on a anti armor handmade and 750 on a two shot lever action and after i got those now i have a bloodied lever action and bloodies the dragon aswell as a bloodied gauss rifle which are amazing weapons. But thats just me
---
My CAMP is located next to Dyer specifically so I could farm these. Based on my experience, I have learned:
---
\- An Organic Solution (the aforementioned quest) can only be completed once. When you flush the chemicals, it forces a few pods to bloom. This is to ensure you can harvest a couple of blooms that you can then use to craft RadShield.
---
\- Day or night doesn't make a difference in blooming, just better visibility.
---
\- Heart of the Swamp event may or may not improve blooming. I've spawned in to find blooms with no event, and have found pods while the event was active.
---
\- There seems to be a harvest timer to prevent server hopping. I have found blooms that would not harvest when I selected them.
---
Well I def admire your bravery!! I dont carry too much as I dont wanna be a victim like yourself. I bulk n sell fast if I can. Idk why ppl bein salty over this but if you ain't stressing it's cool.which is rare too so props to you for that!  I def would be salty tho if I lost more than a short scavenge worth of junk n aid!! Scrap n sell my friend!!
---
EX: A PvE player dies fighting a mod and drops a bag. They're not worried about it, they only lost 4 rubber scrap. A PvP player doesn't really care about the 4 rubber, he just wants the PvE player to get flagged as hostile. Now the PvE player is getting punished for dying with another death
---
Whoa :P Well hey I hope so and I'd welcome that change with open arms, how do rad storms look from a distance, by the way? So I know what to look for the days they bring back the rad storm daily challenge :) However I feel like perhaps I may just be speaking to a prophet of Atom now, because I think you've seen more rad storms in one sit-down than some of F76's playbase in their entire Appalachia-wandering days! :P
---
Y E S
---
That isn't how proof works, OP is making the claim that Bethesda continuously stealth nerfs legendary drop chances, this responder is saying that because of how RNG works personal anecdotes about how they haven't gotten a good drop in weeks doesn't support that claim. It's not a counterclaim, it's a refutation of the original claim.
---
Ah, didn't think about that.  I'm a bloodied melee so I'm there to take huge chunks of damage off the squatch.  I'm not too good at holding pylons.  LOL
---
If it comes to it, once you tag the boss, if you become a conduit and drop, you can wait out the death timer and keep holding the pylon. In either case, thank you for contributing.
---
Angry fast typin lol, I'm great!! how are you today??
---
Im getting tired of seeing people on this forum blast anyone who ‚Äúquit playing‚Äù or says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of this crappy game‚Äù.  From a completely objective standpoint, FO76 is a disgraceful mess that deserves every shit review it gets.  Of course most players have quit.  Every irl friend who I was playing with quit because this game as a whole is a disaster.
---
I bought the game on day one for PC, and have stuck around though all the horseshit (it ain‚Äôt over by far).  While I genuinely enjoy the game as a whole, and thoroughly enjoy the experience when the game decides to function properly....fuck Bethesda.  I‚Äôll never buy another bethedsa game over this whole 76 mess.  I tell others the same thing because this is an awful experience for consumers.  
---
I really like my time in the game, and find the game at its best when I am just wandering around and exploring.  It‚Äôs a shame that the game is still so broken 5 months post-release.  I‚Äôm not mad...I‚Äôm saddened and heartbroken over the whole thing.  I really like this game, and I still call it a landmark AAA failure.
---
I think you are spot on with you take on this, and we do need to kick and scream.  Otherwise, Bethesda will just listen to the ‚Äúthis is fine‚Äù horde and will pile on more content onto a game that *still* barely functions on a basic level üò≠
---
I agree. We should be able to use purified water, but I pick up so much boiled water on my adventures that it's a non-issue.
---
Accidentally ate someone on PC when I meant to stimpack, don't group play generally, so hadn't see that option prior.
---
Not all of it is on purpose.
---
o love the random events
---
like Vlad the black eyebot and his love who just float around talking about how much they love each other...even when one dies they keep going on...probably a bug but it fells really sad instead.
---
theres the story teller Ms. Nanny who gives you free food is the stop and while and listen.
---
the other day i came upon a tend and some dead settler surrounded by scorched out on the road, so even IN UNIVERSE there are human survivors they just get killed really quick by everything  else.
---
also: kill a responder protectron, there's a unique holotape on the body that you only hear if you somehow have looting active on their corpse (you don't have to kill them but you would have had to do some damage)
---
Hopefully the dungeon has good drops and is suitably challenging. I'm really bored of doing the grind on the east side of the map.
---
Picking up your own death bag doesnt flag you.
---
Hopefully, i think it'll focus on weather rad storms acid rain etc
---
It's amazing how can they consistently fuck up interface design since Skyrim. I don't understand it, who is responsible for this? It's not even that hard to figure this shit out.
---
When did they need the world hop respawn?
---
My wife and I do it all the time at white springs. Nobody is there in survival and it resets most of the time. There aren't as many legendaries without a nuke but it's good for power leveling and killing shit.
---
After weeks of turning in technical data and getting nothing more than a pile of bomber jackets and 40mm grenades, I finally used my mule character to feed my 15 or so technical data one at a time. On number 13/15 I finally got a paint job. It‚Äôs now time for me to rinse and repeat. I got the knight paint, but I NEED the Sentinel paint.
---
Jus play n enjoy then!! Most of here enjoy it, its def not bad at all! Spend some doin n have some fun
---
I like this idea. Especially the "I dun goofed" moment you used to get in 4 when it mutates.
---
I've had my camp in the same location for over forty levels, on a junk pile in the forest. I put too much time in it..... I don't think I'm ever going to move.
---
Aren't we getting the ability to display things soon? I need to have my bears in a safer place so I don't do the same by accident.
---
Right up until you're in them they look like a huge billowing green cloud. I know we snapped some pics, I'll try and remember to post them when I get home tonight.
---
yeah, this bug is as old as the game, i even had it in Beta... 
---
But this seems to be different. It just affects this one quest an switching servers doesnt help. I tried yesterday and today, but nothing worked.
---
Saw it a bout a month ago crossing bridge south of Charleston Train Station.
---
Im just wondering why the hell i need acid to smelt iron when theres coal or even wood (to get charcoal) in the damn game
---
It's because we want the game to improve. Posts like adding photos to camp gets reposted every damn week and get upvoted to the heavens while bugs and weapon balancing don't get nearly as much attention. I'm not saying that they don't get any attention, but not as much as these more inconsequential suggestions for some reasons.
---
Also I think game subreddits are usually more for discussion of the gameplay itself than suggestion, but that's like, my opinion.
---
Building my camp and taming broken pets &amp; trading is my end game, not even a Raid dungeon/vault on release,,, wich isn't much for a AAA TItle on release, regardess of if and when it improves. And yes it does have a long way to go, i love the game for what it is.. but im not going to blindly defend bethesdas mess.
---
Look at ESO or GTAVO ...on release they both had way more end game content for high level players to grind through...
---
Yep, make sure your entire side is on. I for some reason switch the helmet for a gas mask one day and then was trying to figure out why it wasn't working and I was overweight.
---
and for the imposter, wear the eye of ra with madem of mystery garb and use voice of set, with the eye of ra voice of set can stun robots in addition to the extra damage
---
Someone swooping in to take your death bag allows them to also kill you when you respawn. Your mechanic is just sour grapes about someone taking your death bag and breaks more than it fixes
---
I recently found a skeleton, surronded by gnomes , with a teddy bear on a folding chair (leading the gnomes??) And an axe nearby. I think the garden gnomes killed that person...
---
Are you talking about game freezing on load screens?
---
1. Hunters Long Coat
---
2. Sheepscuatch Imposter Outfit
---
3. Golf Outfit

4. Bomber Jacket
---
5. Scavenger Outfit

In excavator armor my highest return from Lucky Hole Mines was 417 ore.
---
Watch the Monster Factory video for Fallout 4 if you wanna know the lore
---
Ya it's useful as hell for dps!!
---
That said, it was my cannibal nurse character..
---
IIRC reddit mods can only sticky 2 posts at any given time on the subreddit page. Might be a rumor though idk.
---
Im on PC sorry
---
I read it a couple of times but I still don‚Äôt get your point. What has survival mode to do with all this??
---
I would be OK with the barn style windows being unbroken.
---
"what killed the Sheepsquash....the Ice Age"
---
"...Ice Age...its the name of my gun...."
---
They updated it so it can store upto 5 shots in 1, not sure fire rate helps but bloodied should help the dmg. Still really slow if you have feral ghouls running you down
---
It would flag the pvper but the person who died would still need to engage that person in pvp to become attackable.
---
Just google it and you'll either be like "Oh hell yeah where has this been all my life" or "Oh hell no why does this even exist"
---
Level 140 here and the only two shot weapon I got from a drop was a crossbow. I will soon be doing a Daryl from the walking dead build. I do have a few Anti Armor weapons and they are great.
---
Nah. Crickets.
---
Then Sentinel armor players would just cheese The Imposter....
---
that's weird, i changed mine day 1 &amp; everything is working fine
---
This is what I call a ‚Äústarling effect‚Äù problem - put a telephone pole in the path of migrating starlings and they instinctually break apart as a flock, fly around it, and then continue on their merry way.
---
Same here - Bethesda has created a starling effect by not responding to requests through other channels (especially after releasing the game half baked to a dedicated community).
---
As long as Bethesda seems to be influenced by the Plz Bethesda posts here (and I admit I‚Äôve made a few suggestion posts) then that‚Äôs where people *should* post them - why post them to somewhere where they have no effect?
---
Sorry bud, that's gonna be a no from me dog. Having them marked allows teamwork, and coordination. Yes they can mutate, but how often do people hose without restraint over riding their healing? How many have powerful weapons (psa TSE isnt all that and a bag of chips, there are many alternatives) by this point. I've met many people through this friendly gesture to wait, to have teamwork. Do not take this away.
---
 Secondly, your writing off of everyones gripes is absolutely not helping. Games do this grindy crap all the time and bethesda is no exception. Is a conspiracy? No. Are they nerfing things to drag it out or put focus on events even though the events are crap 90% of the time (I'm looking at you fedora), yes. I'm not saying your white knighting, but you are certainly writing off valid complaints and dialogue as whining.
---
Wait for them to start screeching. and that‚Äôs when you bust their shield with Thorn &amp; one tap them.
---
I'm hoping something got wonky with her loot tables and it'll be fixed with tomorrow's update. Meanwhile I'm stockpiling my T-51 jet pack plans with the Nuka-Cola paint plans I got when farming for the X-01 Nuka Quartz plans. There may be a day down the road when they're rare again...
---
ahhh thanks, i've only done it once
---
Cant read comments on this thread now but, survival pvp is dead as hell lately..
---
Its all synths I tell you
---
Plastic chem bottles and good ol abraxo cleaner. Mark it and steal it. I've also got a camp at an acid extractor and am basically smelting up my ammo needs as a big guns build.
---
/r/pokemongo has had them going for years now, so I wouldn't hold my breath too hard.
---
I'm on PC and I was configuring my game to work with a Switch Pro Controller. I spent over an hour to try and get things how I wanted them, then opened my Pip-Boy and everything went to shit. I gave up on the idea of using a controller altogether at that moment.
---
Yes, once a day you can talk to Biv and he'll give you a quest to either craft a drink and bring it to him, or drink something and test one of your SPECIAL stats through some sort of task. The rewards are mostly drink recipes. You can get the same recipe multiple times, but it's like any other plan and can be traded to other players.
---
Also worth noting, the reset on the daily quests don't seem to follow the same 20 hour rule as the vendor caps resetting. For me, it seems like the dailys reset at 8pm PST, regardless of when I last finished them
---
the toxic people only showed up AFTER survival
---
Hack the robots to make them passive.
---
Wait, what? I need to test that now.
---
I dont think you understand fully.  If they take the bag that doesnt mean they are able to just kill you cause they took the death bag. At the moment they can take your bag and you cant do anything about it unless they agree to engage you.  
---
This way if they take the bag you have the option to risk engaging or not.
---
The UI in this game in general is terrible. So many QOL improvements that could make this game so much more enjoyable.
---
Oh shit, I just picked one up from a player drop while doing the quest. How much did you spend?
---
AWESOME, Will have to do that next time
---
Big weird.. Thats great news for you though !!
---
Only if they add working showers I want this to be akward.
---
Thanks for the support. I enjoyed the game, but ran out of things that held my interest so I took a break waiting for Wild Appalachia. I was really hyped about the Sheepsquatch but considering I already paid for the game, all I can do now in protest is tell people what's going on and not play the game myself. The game has potential but Bethesda needs to work towards that potential, not just the next dollar.
---
As for future Bethesda games, I may buy them if they turn out good, but I can't blindly pre-order a BGS game in good conscience after the way this game has been handled. I'll wait until I see actual unedited gameplay from someone other than the game's developers.
---
Ammo converters for Atoms, lez go boys, Todd needs a new Lambo!
---
Sort of kidding. Sort of not. That's probably what's going to happen.
---
But you know, you can always just trade with someone. I traded 40K various ammo I had collected over a month's time for 50K .50 Cal. Still using that .50 Cal up =).
---
The dc‚Äôs was actually not bethesdas fault, well they created the game so maybe,  tho you can mainly thank the dupers for that.
---
yeah, i wonder why it can split like that :/
---
Still crying. What a crybaby. Keep crying kid.
---
No luck blueprinting it? Or at least part of it? Believe me, I know blueprints mostly suck, but it's worth seeing if it'll work for your camp. Moving off the junk pile near Pleasant Valley and onto an acid location was one of the best moves I've made in this game. Makes taking workshops more productive, plus Breach and Clear is like a gift from the gods.
---
It means every time you would load into "the burrows" that only you or your in game team would be the only one to load in to the burrows. Other players load in a different "burrows" as you or your team.
---
I actually just read the same post. I can understand that to a degree for survival, but not adventure mode. It annoyed the hell out of me that he wasn't going down after using a full clip from my 50 cal and it only took him 2 shots to bring me down. But then proceeded to follow me around the map several times just to kill me again.
---
Good to know. Thanks!
---
Hopefully that helps
---
Do you have proof other than your own experiences? I would argue that the opposite happened, since the try hard PvP ers are off murdering each other.
---
You have to bear in mind how toxic survival is becoming/became. It's basically a deathmatch, those guys enjoy it .. of course when they come back to our adventure world, they all in the survival mentality .. I definitely also noticed survival players more than normal trying to kill me, but I wouldn't worry too much. As soon as they update camps so they can't be destroyed hopefully these toxic players will go back and leave us PVE players alone, going to laugh when they do update camps .. Some guy was pounding on me when I was at a vendor, who I just gracefully ignored and laughed .. don't sweat it .. they not going to be able to do much in adventure soon ..
---
I think bethesda should fix it so you get your stuff back somehow or atleast give you your atoms back. But thanks for the info anyways!
---
Are you on PC? I have like 30K fusion cells I'd trade for .50 Cal.
---
I'm not trying to avoid bugs. I'm trying to stop Bethesda from thinking they can break every single promise they've made with this game. Literally the only promise they made that I can remember and they haven't broken is their promise to work on the game at all.
---
that's why its a discussion, these are my experiences, you have something different...well...discuss
---
You‚Äôd know more if you read Inside the Vault.
---
He is saying survival douche bags are heading back into Adventure mode and trying to behave like they in survival .. unfortunately they have been training and we adventure peeps don't stand a chance at workshops ..
---
Thank you for this. I hope it works!!! I have been playing since launch and have collected many treasure maps, and am finally going to check them out!! Hopefully they include the bos plan/mods for the arms and legs. I have been looking for these for FOREVER !!!
---
I've been buying every camp plan I can from whitesprings and other vendors.
---
This guy bethesdas
---
Ah yes, Reddit, the only true unit of measurement.
---
Im wondering why too.. i didnt cheat or anything that would have made me lose anything
---
The only time I've ever seen one was my first day out of the vault on launch day. It made me think that they happened often. Boy was I wrong.
---
Level 50 version of T-51B, T-60, Ultracite (free from BoS quest line) or X-01 (free plans, need materials to craft it) are all good options. It comes down to which one you like most in terms of style mostly. T-60 is DIRT cheap to repair though.
---
Like I said, most of the high level PvP players are all in the new mode, and when they are in PvE they are likely restocking their meds, and ammo etc.
---
Amen!
---
Thatd be nice
---
see what these people miss is that Adventure is where you go to /get away/ from the toxic death match....not do more of it...
---
Go to Fort Defiance. Pick up all the strait jackets. Sell them. Buy balistic fiber. 
---
Seriously. Its easier to farm something else and buy it. Save yourself a lot of frustration.
---
I can't find it in my inventory, I bought it too off ghram.. ;'(
---
There has been talk of maybe an ammo bench coming. And I think adding some dailies for MoM would be cool. 
---
Maybe some vigilante-esque missions cleaning up 'bad guys' i.e. super mutants or scorched

and killing people, ranting at events, as i said, they seem to think that adventure is some sort of Bot mode and were all there for them to grind loot off of. I also notice they tend to have the mikes off so yeah were their to be their free loot boxes
---
I live there too! I moved briefly to the Mire, but something about that spot called me back.
---
I've read them all... is there something I'm missing? ALl I've heard is that it's a new game mode.
---
what level are you?
---
&gt;ETA: I'm a new player, only been on for a month or two so I had never experienced this issue before. To the two users that explained the issue nicely, THANK YOU, I appreciate it. To the assholes that acted like I'm a fucking moron, GO FUCK A SCORCHBEAST I HOPE YOU NEVER GET HELP WHEN YOU NEED IT
---
WTF where did this come from?? There were no assholes and everyone was pretty nice. Who spit on your cupcake and told you it was frosting. Quit being a snowflake. You don't get a participation trophy here.
---
Oh BTW it's *edit* not *ETA*
---
Starched Genes, 
---
Class Freak lowers the negative effects
---
I may be wrong.. but I get the impression they are aware people may or may not have picked up excessive rare items illegitimately and just collecting them regardless of how you obtained them and even dropped them could have associated "ghost data". Thus even if you have 100lbs of weight, you could be still be walking around as if you had 10,000 weight.
---
The trick is to allow the "squatch" to enter the building enough so you can rush past it and get out through the door, otherwise your trapped in there along with the ones your trying to annoy
---
I usually only have this happen at Whitesprings for some reason. When it does happen it usually is just a 1 star though.
---
Same idiot who decided to exit the game you should go to the map and press Z.
---
Actually...that's just our sports teams colors.. gold and blue.
---
I see, thanks.
---
All this complaining is seriously annoying...Just a never ending never satisfied hate mob. It's a solid game and entirely fun to play before and even more so now. Beth is doing good work.
---
well said!
---
Ah ok, yes that helped. Thanks for the explanation!
---
were you able to get the masks in trades?
---
I need to craft Nuka-Cola, I am wanting to set up a shop that sells everything Nuka-Cola when player vending comes out, so iv been scavenging the mountains of WV. for that sweet succulent Cola. And there better be assorted flavors too.
---
If only there was a place to keep my junk from dropping when I die its so hard. I wish there was a container I could keep loot in that has a button that quick stores all my junk into some kind of bank so it would be safe.
---
All seriousness though losing junk is the only repercussion when we die, minecraft has more hardcore death mechanics losing a couple cans to a stranger is not going to ruin you and if you lost anything more valuable you should have stashed it.
---
Its all caused by explosive effects throwing them around
---
500 10mm rounds sells for 150 caps or something, could be a good idea, and wouldn't seem to broken.
---
Having them marked does nothing but reward the first person that happens to scroll through and sees them first.  Your argument  entirely falls apart with a simple addition to my idea, give a legendary enemy say a 5 second invulnerability window while it glows and mutates.  Everyone in the vicinity can immediately see the legendary and can get their tag in.
---
And do you not understand how a conspiracy theory works?  If you have zero proof of something yet you STILL insist that Bethesda is secretly making the game grindier for no real reason other than to fuck with their players THAT IS A CONSPIRACY THEORY.
---
Your fedora whining is a PERFECT fucking example.  RANDOM DROPS ARE RANDOM.  You're having a hard time getting the drop and see it as Bethesda making the game grindy for no reason while I have six of the fucking things and would like to see ANYTHING else drop for once.
---
Same thing happened to me. I got followed. I've invested only enough time to casually play the game. I knew people would "game it" and figure out the best way to exploit the perk system. They are essentially using a perk system that is greatly slanted to PvP that can severely take advantage of people with adventure builds. I just don't get it, how did Bethesda fuck up a perk system this bad? I have the feeling these people with PvP builds couldn't hold a candle to a lvl 50 scorched, yet here I can solo a lvl 80 scorchbeast and take almost no damage and get one shotted by a turd in a trench coat.
---
Oh so it only holds 5 charges now?
---
I guess my quad one would be more than a curiosity then.
---
If you didn't use the exploit to jump to the control room, it'll be just like riding a bike.
---
Nuke mines are fun to throw into spaces like that. It won't really damage the players... just a consistent tick of radiation...
---
Damn, 76 is dope tho take your time n have fun!!
---
We need a new sub for suggestions
---
Make it r/76Suggestions
---
Flashbacks to spamming the add-to button in Mama Dolce Feed the People quest. Ate my first 3 star armor piece early in my game.
---
Camping at a train station is going to happen with or without legendary items, and what does your replay add or counter to mine? Level does not equal skill, you can be level 200+ then make a new guy and run with level 5s; having level based match making is stupid and a good way to spilt the players (:
---
Make that count as a slap then. They can't actually attack the player who owned the bag until that player hits back. There's easy solutions to many problems people bring up with things.
---
now this guy actually makes sense!  too bad noone else here seems to
---
500 caps. IMO it's probably worth more.
---
half buried skeletons covered in moss or flowers would be amazing
---
I agree but i don't think thats solely the cause and atleast they're/we're trying to think of ideas rather than lurking to only comment without constructive input.
---
 from my point of view its the organisation of the Sub,, threads for different subjects would help tidy it up.
---
You do realize Raven rock appeared because they moved to the east coast after their oil rig was blown up? Also, the FEV was stated to only be in Mariposa multiple times throughout the original games - These super mutants also have dark green skin, which only Mariposa supermutants have. And do you really think the incredibly secretive, tech hoarding BoS would just randomly recruit people all over the wasteland? That is not how the BoS worked. You realize they are the type of people to kill you if you lost your weaponry and armor? They also do not recruit outsiders or want their help at all. Look at the Mojave chapter or the Outcasts in fo3 if you don't believe that.
---
there are some great suggestions, and i don't think suggestion posts should stop.
---
im just annoyed with how they're constantly presented.
---
"Dear Bethesda,"
---
"Bethesda, we need to talk"
---
"Bethesda, pls don't do this"
---
"Bathasda"
---
it's just all really cringey. there's really nothing to do about it though. mods barely enforce the normal rules, and even though i find it annoying, it would be a little ridiculous to expect them to enforce rules like "no including 'dear Bethesda' in titles."
---
now if you're complaining about suggestion posts for content and mechanics overall, well you can fuck right off. this sub is actively monitored and reported on by Bethesda community managers, and part of the reason that it exists is to get feedback on what the players want. it's great that Bethesda is doing this and we need to keep being loud enough for them to hear. they've already addressed *tons* of issues that the player base has brought to light here. to shit on that is just plain stupid.
---
The Destiny subreddit has to do this every once in a while because of how hungry people get.  
---
I do think we would benefit from having a place to host all our concerns for the game.
---
Ha!
---
we are called consumers, and yes, we have rights.
---
but people like you are trying to erode any rights we do have, until corporations rule the world.
---
Yuo dont need to take a powerplant workshop to get cores.
---
There are at least a dozen PA spawn sites on the west side of the map.  
---
Many will have a core.  Several will have anywhere between 2 and 4 with charge levels anywhere between 25 and 100%.  Farm them.
---
There are even more genrators, which may or may not contain a core.
---
For example, when I completed the Camden park quest, a core was one of the rewards.  There may be another in the generator on the edge of the park.  There may be another at the spawn site in the park.  And I found a 4th in an ammo box.
---
Batteries included perk will reduce the weight of the cores from 3# to 0.3#.
---
Spoiler :&gt;! climb the roller coaster.  One of the bodies has a key to a locked room at another location.  behind that door is another PA spawn site.  Usually 1-2 cores there!&lt;
---
If you haven‚Äôt start yet, I‚Äôm the queen of conduits 2 &amp; 3.  I can be on in 10 minutes.

---
The reason it is not a thing is the same reason that the military trains soldiers NOT to do this. The fuse time is an approximation, not an absolute.
---
my god and people are downvoting you for saying this 
---
this sub is fucked
---
It‚Äôs insane how this game manages to sell any copies with all the bitching and whining that stands out on this page... I‚Äôm level 101 and took a break for some Read Dead 2. But Jesus, this board is pathetic sometimes.
---
I've noticed if I take over high level workshops there are generally high level three star enemies when I have the defend events. You made a good point here. Not sure why it was down voted.
---
Last one I did it was me and one other guy. So one of us would have to hit two pylons and maybe get a hit in on the squatch.
---
We both knew what to do. Just couldn't do it. We failed. But have each other the thumbs up for trying.
---
You make it sound like helmlock is utilized at max capacity for acid farming, and there‚Äôs a Queue of waiting users to farm.
---
I think you‚Äôre looking at it strictly to farm.
---
Downvoting stands.
---
god you're a whiny little thing.
---
Very early in the game I stayed on the same server for like 14 hours. IIRC they had to be repaired again after about 10-12 hours. I don't know if this is still the case, as this was in the first few weeks. I'm still going through all those fusion cores lol.
---
I run off into the wood and drop all my stuff and then die a billion times pick up all the loot from the robots and then forget where I dropped my bag.....
---
But at the heart of it you‚Äôre crying about some over the top p2w ‚Äòidea‚Äô that hasn‚Äôt happened, getting angry. I‚Äôm not doing a disservice to it, you are, pretending all the things you‚Äôre angry about are have already ruined your video game.
---
...ruining the game...    right
---
If i die and someone takes my bag, i have the choice to enter PVP with them. It's my choice, and is not forced PVP.
---
I agree partially.
---
Some of the suggestion posts on here are actually pretty well thought out and good ideas overall, be it a QoL change or an actual mechanic. 
---
However, there are also a good bit of suggestions that are just plain stupid. We know what they are.
---
yea, loved it
---
Not a two shot but I got a 2* hunter's explosive 10mm smg sometime ago. Pretty nice, have to use marsupial to keep from splash damage when baddies get close.
---
Lolz thanks.
---
yes, yes oh god yes
---
&gt;I only ever enter into servers with \~10 other people, and I haven't seen nukes launched nearly as much within the past month.  
---
&gt; The repair kit debacle really pissed off some people 
---
There's literally 3 other observations within the comment. Since there's no steamlabs count, and BGS hasn't release a player count, we can't say for sure.
---
This is a wonderful idea! Definitely should be upvoted so Bethesda can see it.
---
 maybe we can alter the climate with the atlas
---
Do we supply our own keycard things, or do you? Is it just pay caps and join, then wait for the event to begin?
---
I‚Äôd like silenced mods for the 10mm.
---
You got leather armor?  I'm kind of jealous.  I think she dropped 1\* wood arms for me, four times out of five.
---
Nice! Thanks for the tip.
---
Assholes and toxic people have always been in the game. Haven't noticed a difference in them since survival came out, still all the same
---
108
---
Most people iv seen just completely ignored the pylons
---
What system and what are you asking?
---
Not true but go off I guess
---
I supply card . If someone triggers event before we do then no charge. Caps are only toward cost of card. If you already have a card we run for no charge.
---
Then you know as much as anyone else. Which was my point.
---
I like this idea. I wish even random mobs had a chance to drop legendary stuff. How awesome would it be to have those protectrons during the Fertile Soil event drop a sweet 3 star legendary weapon? Especially when you are just starting out. Sure it would be low level but imaging getting a sweet explosive weapon when you were level 5.
---
I think scattering hidden legendary enemies all throughout the game would be a good thing. It would hopefully get people to run different events and expand a few horizons.
---
There is nothing inside
---
FIGHT ME YOU KNUCKLEHEAD MCSPAZATRON

You realize that things need to move around if new features are to be added, right? The options are either to change up buttons so that some buttons open sub-menus, or make everything work in a radial (which is great in some games, not a good idea for 76).  
---
The bug is a bug, but this sort of change is actually a GOOD thing.  Remember, too, that the UI has to be more or less identical in function between PC and console, or else we'll just end up with MORE bugs.  Divergent UX is not a good thing - trust me, I deal with it every day at work.
---

---
Never. Take. It. Off.
---
I wonder about outfit comparability. Will it work with armor shown or just if you have to cover it up with an outfit. In either case how will it work with items that have backpacks themselves such as trapper chest piece or the union civil war outfit.
---
It's easier to pull a trigger, than to say all those words and negotiation.
---
I just saw the same type of thing with an Eyebot last night - playing flute music.  He didn't have any critters following him, though.  Thought it was interesting.  If I see him again I'm gonna follow him.
---
the gold paint works on the "Medical malpractice" which was the last weekly gun. I don't believe it's intentional that the wooden inlay doesn't work with Sole Survivor.
---
They are still random and don't always spawn.
---
Pretty sure the imposters has a hefty knock back/ stagger.
---
I'm not the one downvoting you, but you do you brother. I generally don't participate in karma points.
---
Anyway, think you're missing the point. Hemlock holes sucks for farming acid (you get 1 acid per minute there at most - you can get 10+ acid per minute farming toxic larry's), yet it's definitely supposed to be the best spot for it. You're right, it's not utilized because it sucks. I'd like for workshops to not suck. I'd like to have to fight over them, because they're so good.
---
Have you ever gotten anything more than 1* legendaries from these un named legendaries? I've mostly run whitesprings and gotten a lot of them, but they were only ever 1*. Because if not then they did nerf watoga and other places then.
---
Take a decent supply of stims and freshly repaired weapons. If you are doing it on your own most of the the robots are normally quite low level. Most of it tries to make you feel rushed but don't let it. If you have a good supply of stims you will be ok. Take advantage of workbenches where you can. Never just rush into a new room. Always check for and take out turrets first. This will make clearing/avoiding robots easier.
---
I can hook you up, on Xbox
---
Since there's more than just one server, someone can be built where you are on a different server. If you leave the server you're on, there is always a chance of someone already being built where you are. It can be annoying, but luckily they implemented the pop up about your camp not being placed before you actually join a world!
---
Also, if your camp is built directly behind the golf club, and you've got turrets, I highly recommend that you move somewhere else or just far away from the golf club ASAP. People (like me) will wreck camps that are directly behind the golf club with turrets at Whitespring with zero hesitation.
---
lol right!?!?!? i was expecting to see some posts like the Op talked about, but so far everyone was nice about it?
---
I wish the grenades would just explode on contact.....with anything. I have a fun grenade launcher but I swear the projectile goes bouncing past the enemies every time. Lol.
---
Wow!

Nah it's my 2* executioners Mr handys buzz blade with +50% limb damage, repaired up to 200% with the electrical mod thrown on it.

I'd love some advice as to what to do with her.  First time I attended we one, the second she took off headed north and never returned, and last night was horrible she only got down to about 3/4 of her life and didn't seem to want to land.  I ran around trying to clean up the mobs as it seemed everyone was to busy focusing on her in the air.  When she landed I'd melee her till she took off again and then go after the mobs but I was the only melee when she landed.  I'm guessing there are some specific things needed to take her down, but I've only just started attending them after the nuke hits(read somewhere its best not to be there when she spawns as it adds to her hp).  I haven't been to lucky with drops so I haven't the best weapon but I do what I can with what I have.
---
hmmm maybe if Bethesda actually fixed it as fast as they fixed the ATOM store then people wouldnt have to post them.....  see the logic?
---
You sound like someone who grinded an ALT to have a low-level PVP character. That's great but it was disproportionate for high levels, who were are not really ant tougher. Pretty obvious, but I guess you can keep thinking it's cuz no one is an alpha like you and we all cried about it.
---
There's been nothing discussing nuclear winter yet, so....
---
I take more pictures of random silly things the developers put in than anything else.  My favorite is the toy on the top of the elevator eating a deathclaw egg.  
---
The antlers are fun too :)
---
Same. Only way to fix it was to interact with the workbench to force myself back into the map.
---
Thanks for all the tips!
---
Folks who post are customers or potential customers. They get a voice. 
---
Personally, I'm waiting on single player servers; to be free of the console multiplayer tax. 
---
So until they release it, I ask nicely.

Hmm... after thinking about it and seeing your input, that makes sense; you're visually invisible with a Stealth Boy but still make noise without actual sneaking perks or gear. I think I'll test it when I play again; down in Watoga or Westek maybe. I'll use max Sneak with Escape Artist and crawl around to see how it goes. Then I'll blast a Stealth Boy and try again; both with and without Sneak improving gear.
---
the ironic thing is it isn't pulling the trigger requires pressiong left mouse, but unless you have push to talk all you have to do is open your mouth
---
As long as it‚Äôs not BR
---
Yeah, that sounds like a steal. I‚Äôve seen people selling level 50 Fixers for that much.
---
How about a game with no threats at all?
---
yeah i noticed that as well on ps4, sometimes they just hang there, but you cant loot them or make them make a sound if you bump into them
---
maybe another player already looted them and now they are just "server ghosts"- able to bee seen but not able to be interacted with
---
Just found Morgantown this morning so that‚Äôs perfect thank you
---
Right - I understand that some of these things don't touch the core of the game and there could are certain things that should take priority.
---
But isn't that for Bethesda to decide and not us? We don't know how this thing is implemented. All we know is what Bethesda has told us, and that isn't much. For example, when Bethesda says something about not wanting to "burden the server", it could mean anything. It could mean "we don't know how to do it" or "the current architecture doesn't support it" or "we didn't plan for that" or whatever else.
---
When it comes down to it, the underlying problem is that you'll never get rid of people asking for things - whether there is a "Bethesda Plz" flair or not. They will always do it and there will always be ridiculous things. The only thing that can be done is mod intervention.
---
This thread should really be titled, "How do I become a mod to help clean up some of this stuff?" 
---
There's some irony in there but I can't put it into words.
---
Everybody has, everyone on my friends list cannot apply mods including myself. 
---
I would say just buy and keep whatever mods you find and stash em till it‚Äôs fixed
---
Buying in bulk is so expensive like 250 caps a box.
---
That‚Äôs a lot of purified water haha.
---
Level 342, still haven't found my dream weapon.
---
Let me tell you though, I get along just fine and out dps 99.99% of the population with a 1 star bloodied .50 Cal.
---
Awwww why was it removed?  I was looking at possibly buying one.
---
Is batteries included level 50 as well?
---
I get that they do it to reduce server spam.  Delay would be fine if it gave like 4-6 dirty water per pump.
---
I'm not saying I've paid cash for anything, but you can. And u can buy caps for cash too...
---
You can bypass the pipe stage if someone In the silo has lvl 3 hacker and lock picking. Makes it so much easier
---
Awww why was it removed?  I was looking at possibly buying one.
---
I believe I have a mascot outfit, I can check my stash when I log on
---
I think the better solution is to provide end game content, like dungeons, which we are getting one of tomorrow =)
---
If you don't see how this is going to be back on their promise I don't know what to tell you
---
Hmm.  Thanks for the info.  I must find where I am off.
---
I wana say certain hits are rolled separate. Like a sneak attack 2.5 damage is not on top of an Instigating crit.  They are calculated separate then added together.  Or atleast that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve read on here
---
I ran around until I fell into a black hole
---
Just accepted your friend request, joining you now
---
While I agree, you don't think the amount of complaining on this sub is stupid? So asking Bethesda to add new features is wrong but 20+ duplicate threads of "No more repair kits" is okay? This sub is literal cancer, or does it depend on what time you make a post?
---
Those are the best runs. Makes it fun for that Fedora
---
Yea, but you can‚Äôt have 3 effects.
---
If it had more or perhaps an upgrade like more resistance, I would bite.
---
lol that news story is jank AF
---
Oh  I don't disagree with you at all. I thought it would be fixed with the hotfix 2 days after the patch  but no. And nothing from Bethesda either is annoying. Probably something to do with the new mechanics of repairs. Maybe that's coming, a mod application toolkit, a steal at 125 atoms....
---
Two shot and anti armor are both prefixes and can't be on the same weapon. Unless you mean putting an armor penetration mod on a TS weapon.
---
Yeah, ok, I was thinking of another game. My bad.

Sentinel, cavalier, unyielding, and vanguard are all pretty popular for a reason. The sentinel and cavalier are very rare in my experience. I found two pieces in all my time playing and traded for 3 others. Most of these go for upwards of 5000 caps or high tier trades.
---
People like combat armor and the marine armor as well.
---
The armor pieces that have weight reduction for items are pretty popular as well.
---
I used to run with a metal chest piece forever. It has good defense and you can mod them up pretty well.
---
Just try running through the whitesprings golf course and hope you have good luck.  Or go on the FO76 trade subs.
---
Good to know. I‚Äôve joined a few but haven‚Äôt run the full questline to understand exactly how the cards work, etc. I‚Äôll probably send a FR in the next day or two to do a couple runs :). Thanks
---
I love cats....I just can't finish a whole one by myself :)
---
Correction... crits are GREAT for PVP. My level 22 pistol/crit dude managed to down a level 122 unyielding dude with one crit to the head with a level 10 black powder pistol. It was so damn satisfying.
---
Ammosmith, super duper.
---
Build your camp on a lead node.
---
Farm lead spawns daily(and with multiple characters if transfer possible)
---
Kill low level mobs scrap guns for steel
---
Ok TY I was hopeful that I was not the only one having this problem I'll keep it piling up and try again later
---
Yes!! Make a thread, or shut up... I get it's a game that needs work, but I'm tired of hearing every. Single. Complaint.
---
Yeah thanks that's exactly what I meant xD two I saw recently is the ability to craft Nuka Colas other than Nukashine and displaying power armour in PA stations, like you say inconsequential. Bethesda have been pretty good overall at fixing things, a dip here or there but nothing like the mountain the anthem Devs are facing ATM xD
---
They will pay you in nylon and plastic
---
I'm doing the events right now. Came across 3-4 players farming a helicopter for XP.
---
Uh, no. I'd rather not die while fighting a hoard or whatever, drop any junk I might be carrying, and be flagged as hostile because some random came along and picked up all or some of my dropped loot. I play in pacifist mode, except for when I take a workshop or someone is being a dick to me/one of my teammates. If people wanna take my stuff after I die, then whatever, they can have it. Cause I sure as hell am not gonna fight them for it, nor will I be forced to be their enemy cause they wanted my junk/wanted to force me into PVP
---
Sounds great
---
100 million %
---
The 10mm has a silencer
---
I'm just curious as to what happened with the decoration option that was supposed to be implemented...  I could have sworn placement of items from ones stash was supposed to be a thing.
---
This is the sanest reply
---
Worth 20 caps baby.
---
I'm just waiting to do it, I'm on PS4 UK and looking to do the nuke quest so if anyone wants to team up hi e me a shout!
---
Is there a reason you're being a massive condescending asshole?
---
I like it. Why shouldn‚Äôt we get a chance to get our loot back?
---
You are starting to sound like one of those damn dirty Commies
---
Class freak doesn‚Äôt work at all the proof is right there above you
---
lazy or would rather spend time on the actual game?
---
Congrats on popping your Nuka Cherry!
---
Level 28, in intelligence.
---
If they just changed the events to level with the character I would be ok with that. Like if I trigger Grafton Day the enemies are higher leveled or something.  I think it's ok the random mobs are low levels though.
---
I was surprised such an obvious bug didn't get fixed.
---
It does work, at least for me it works.
---
All i want is Perk Card slots for my diff Daytime, Nighttime Nuke Zone runs and Crafting/Foraging builds and thats it.
---
But im not gonna beg bethesda for it. im sure theyre aware of it and if they implement it fine if not well ill keep shuffling cards. takes two seconds.
---
i know pc has a mod for it already but us console plebs dont.
---
But its why i just casually scroll thru this sub. too much begging and complaining
---
Also, this person is referring to the grounded mutation, specifically. Not whether or not class freak works in general or is bugged, cause class freak works and is fine
---
but at least it would be perfect...
---
Same, especially by how frequent it is.
---
Yes, there is a reason.
---
Same here, on all my PA's. My mates says it is the same for melee weapons...
---
I was salty as hell the first time it happened, and I lost a bunch trying out survival and getting spawn camped, but it was so easy replenishing everything that I've just stopped really caring too much.
---
Other than ballistic fiber and black titanium, the rest of the junk I end up getting enough in bulk within a few days that I have to start selling again
---
Its for Death bag only, not a dropping items bag.
---
When the new event pops up, stash your junk and join in. If you bother to scavange the area after the event succeeds or fails, you'll get a grip of fusion cells. Call out in area chat letting people know you're more than happy to take any unwanted fusion cells and if they've been server hopping for the event you'll have more than enough.
---
Exactly ... soon it will be the case ... I am already getting excited about it :)
---
Yeah, I know, I got that. I'm saying your suggestion shouldn't be a thing.
---
Or the stimpacks, or other players dropping any junk you might have had.
---
What reason is that, dare I ask.
---
Care to share? You need a hug?
---
Any time!
---
Well I must be one of those shock troops, which is surprising on a level 30 armed with a non legendary fireaxe. It's been made easier too as fluids/mass now drop in mutiples, not one at a time.
---
I'm strait up PVE and recently discovered emergency protocols, it goes with nerd rage like PB and J. Makes my bloody build into a tank.
---
That's the mod I would recommend, too.
---
Most gamers feel that Beth no longer listens and so likely post as a form of desperation. 
---
We have come a long way since morrowind. :/
---
I actually love this event. Its one of the few in the game that everyone comes together as a team.
---
Granted the frame rate is choppy af sometimes and I spend more time dead than alive - or getting pissed at myself for frantically bashing buttons and accidently holding down (A) on the controller (xbox) which results in me climbing out of my power armor mid-battle.... but whatever lol.
---
Nah, that's so not true ... think of survival as a training ground for toxicity .. it's just worse, but has always been there. In order for them to survival they got to be more creative and cunning .. it sounds like they having fun, but I agree with your point, it should stay there and soon will
---
I get that and all but a semi auto pistil that weighs nearly EIGHT POUNDS is just...IDIOTIC.
---
You're in the 76 subreddit. Don't bullshit cause you got called out.
---
Some of this is just bad scaling in the game, like if a level 5 comes to your zone, lower level mobs will start spawning and removing chances for a good legendary spawn.
---
Nah.
---
Yeah its 5 or 6, quad would be interesting, see if it actually stores more and let me know. 1 have a 1 star 2 shot one trying to test the dmg.
---
Have you tried wearing sunglasses while playing?
---
It would also be great if we didn‚Äôt have to lug dirty water from an open source (because getting it out of a water pump is pure torture) and have to boil it all up, then cook the ingredients we have into food. 
---
If we have a water pump installed I would be eternally grateful if we could cook and not have to collect and store all that dirty water. 
---
(Pardon the pun)...I know this is a pipe dream.
---
Was on today for a while and didn't get the event seems to be slowing down rather quickly.
---
You can revert to the old ID... sure it‚Äôs annoying.
---
Pretty much. Priorities.
---
So your reddit numbers show that the total count of people subscribed to this sub went up and that signifies that users have gone down?
---
I've been collecting various scout mods for the scout armor set I've also been collecting. Can't apply any of them, even though I meet all requirements. Had the same issue with a couple random weapon mods as well. Very frustrating..
---
Some of the regular clothes are good for female avatars. I'm currently wearing a tattered dress and a veil with black-rimmed glasses. I just found a red dress that looks good too. Before that it was the Responder's medic outfit and a campaign hat.
---
I consider the color of your head lamp in fallout to be the equivalent of light saber colors in star wars. 
---
So I use blue.
---
why not?
---
Level 200 here and I've never found a TSE anything.  I don't PVP and am melee anyway and I have had a great experience without the so called "Godtier" TSE weapons.  I think a hell of alot of them were duped and since the nerf, are not all that great anymore anyway.  I think you'll get lucky and get a good weapon sooner or later if you just keep at it.
---
Ohan yeah like if we had an equivalent to water purifiers for dirty water that could be modded for auto boiling and such that would be absolutely lovely.
---
Survival mode right now has problems. There is no incentive to team up with rando's. Every run in with people just turns into battle royale. This weeks challenge of completing 20 events wasn't that difficult but as soon as the event ended it was a blood bath.  
---
I tried to help defend other people's workshops and got cut down in seconds by turrets. 
---
I like the idea of the survival servers but right now something is missing in the execution of it.
---
Mount Blair Trainyard is a great location to farm fusion cores. You can obtain up to 5 (a 6th if you do the Battle Bot event). There are potentially 2 power armor chassis (also good for farming power armor) and 3 fusion generators.
---
I‚Äôll server hop this location if I‚Äôm running a bit low on FCs. Most of the time I‚Äôll just make a run for the cores without engaging the various types of enemies that spawn there.
---
I actually had my CAMP very close to there just for farming FCs before I discovered I can place a CAMP to extract resources.
---
10k?
---
THAT ONES COOL!!!
---
Depending on how the legendary vendor actually works, the reduced spawns might not be as bad. If it's easy to roll the effects you want on legendary loot with the vendor, the legendary hunt might be to find 3\* max level loot, instead of all the right effects.
---
That would at least negate the idea of purifiers if we have to use boiled water only
---
East of black bear lodge there is a junk node close close to water, it also has lots of animals around for meat, some super mutant attacks.  
---
I believe you can get both and junk and lead, but then you can‚Äôt get the water.
---
BOS Combat.
---
Events. I never have to farm healing items.
---
Cool. Hope it works out for ya.
---
I think this is true. But honestly you see the patch notes as soon as you select the game in the launcher, and now we have the ingame news as well. Might as well free up a sticky post for something like this.
---
Same here, will be happy to help. GT is K9MPSGT
---
Well, regarding content - it's not a game that holds your hand. Regarding bugs, it's still sometimes a game that smashes said hand with a hammer lol.
---
Freezes and crashes are still an issue, but it's not as bad as it was on launch day. For example, 3 days ago I was repairing a power station, which took me 45 min, it crashes as I was approaching the control room to hit the restart button. It was the first time in a couple months that I stopped playing from a crash, so I guess that was an improvement?
---
It's maybe 2-3 months from launch quality. I feel comfortable recommending the game to non-casual players, but it's definitely not a game for people who like training wheels.
---
Pretty sure the true end game content is going to be event/dungeon based. Such as the sheepsquatch or the dungeon that's coming tomorrow. It's the same in pretty much any MMO. The open world map is moderately difficult and all the real goodies are found in dungeons.
---
No need to mess up the open world map. 
---
And anyway, you can nuke an area and force high level enemies to spawn.. 
---
&gt;As the player base levels up, we're likely to see fewer and fewer lower-leveled players
---
Unlikely. Well, actually that would mean the game is dying. If everyone is high level and there are no new players = people lost interest = bethesda makes less monies = game dies.
---
If Fallout 76 is to be successful for a long time the map should be tuned for all levels. We need to have low levels. No low levels = no new people = game is dying. 
---
I'm strongly against any kind of up-scaling. 
---
&gt; If I head to other regions, especially the Forest 
---
How many times do you go back to starter areas in mmorpg games? The forest is a starter area.
---
&gt;As for newbies wandering into insanity, you can have the system force a respawn if a low-level player enters an area with over-leveled monsters in those early regions.
---
Sounds pretty bad for the server. It needs to check a lot more things. The more checks the server has to make the worse the performance.
---
Currently we have this system: 
---
Default level = x.
---
IF player level &gt; default level respawn mobs appropriate for player level on the next mob spawn cycle. 
---
You want to add another step: 
---
IF player level &gt; default level respawn mobs appropriate for player level on the next mob spawn cycle.  &amp;&amp; if low level enter area immediately despawn leveled mobs and respawn default level mobs.
---
Despawning leveled mobs can and will cause a lot of anger "Bethesda why did my 5 stars legendary lvl 91 molerat despawned?!?!?!". It will also use a bit more server power. Always checking for low levels, despawning, resetting to the default level for the area and so on...
---
&gt;We should be encouraging players to poke around
---
And we are encouraged to do so. One of the things bethesda is really good at doing is environmental story telling. There are lots of cool things in Fo76, explore.
---
&gt;not focusing them into the few "best" spots on the map.
---
Fo76 is still new but slowly we're getting more and more high level content. You can do SBQ, Sheepsquatch, The harper's ferry dungeon (tomorrow) or nuke pretty much any area on the map and turn it into a leveled zone.
---
which may be a reason why they go to adventure "theres no comradiere in survival, let me go adventure so i can kill who i want and not have to worry about being ganked"
---
You‚Äôre just looking for a reason to put me down again.
---
Lol.  RNGesus hates me anyway, so I might as well enjoy the teamwork for it's own rewards huh?
---
All we know is some story dialogue that's been data mined. Speculation is geared toward some kind of BR type mode.
---
Oh wow, yeah that would explain some of the random stuff I get, me and the people I play with actually have houses all along that road, this would explain why sometimes we log in and there are dead bodies in our houses or random debris scattered around outside.
---
I was killed by a mob of Yao Guai this morning, respawned at the same spot and they all instantly died
---
Never sober
---
If I recall, they eventually updated FO4 so that when you apply the Tesla coils to any torso, the skin changes. I don't think they did for bracers, though.
---
When I go to the Sheepy event I've tryed staying by the pylon but died to quickly as I've got a bloodied build so what I find that works best is to keep the robots off the heavy guys so they can deal the damage to bring the beast down.
---
Heeeere, humans, humans, humans.
---
...read what I said above, like actually read it, and you'll see why. If you die, drop junk, and someone comes to pick it up, you should not be marked as hostile towards each other. That's dumb as hell. I'd rather have someone pick up whatever junk I dropped upon death and both of us just move on with our day as opposed to someone picking it up as a way to force me into PVP with them so they can kill me for caps, or I kill them and they seek revenge until one of us leaves the server. One big thing is the new event. If I die from bots, and I drop junk, I would prefer to not die to some random PVP asshat after the event ends cause they picked up my shit after I died.
---
You probably have a bunch of people mad at you too. ;)
---
I am down. I will be on tonight. I bought 3 keycards and they all resulted in crashes. So.... This is kinda like sheepsquatch insurance.
---
ironically i had an idea like this the other day to go with my interior walls idea, what if the interior walls had the broken glass in the other spaces so when paired you get full glass just with cracks
---
Nope to both
---
Uptown funk you up.
---
Yep, happening a lot. I just figured I'm awesome.
---
Totally different games though.  (ESO and GTAVO).  GTAVO is maybe a better comparison.  I don't disagree there needs to be more content, but I'm arguing that what is there is more than enough for millions of people playing.  
---
No endgame would mean the game stops after the credits roll.  Not the case.  There's a lot to do, it's sandbox.  You make your own fun.
---
I never used the preview thing, I always need to filter my stuff cus there‚Äôs so much shit in there. Like I‚Äôve actually got no idea why my stash is always full, there‚Äôs probably 2-3 guns, about 15 missiles but no other heavy ammo, one piece of useful armour and that‚Äôs it! I swear all I have is junk in bulk.
---
Yup. 
---
Had that going on multiple times over the weekend.
---
If you go into the in game menu select challenges i forget what tab it is under but it will tell you how many hours you have "explored the wasteland" that is a total time between all your characters. I hope that helps you keep track of your in game time. Props for still being a gamer at 60. I plan to do the same lol.
---
So me calling you out for trying to put another user down is somehow putting you down...?
---
You'll win gold for those mental gymnastics in Tokyo next year, champ...
---
Isn't this pretty much everything? I've lost count of the number of times I've heard a super mutant or scorched just randomly firing somewhere nearby, then I finally find them and they were shooting at me the whole time, despite having several walls between us.
---
I wear the knight suit. Looks exactly the same as thhe soldier suit. I don't think it was ever different, just there so each rank can have its own under armor.
---
Isn't this already datamined? Display stands and weapon racks, and it's even mentioned in the  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019) 
---
&gt; **New Features: C.A.M.P. Decorating, Player Vending, Functional Camera** ‚Äì Use items from your stash to decorate your C.A.M.P.  
---
But things takes time, I guess.
---
 Vampire blade is the way to go. I have a 3\* combat knife and thats all I use in a Whiesprings nuke zone. Its so fast you can just spam the trigger button and loos little to no health from ghoul damage
---
FeelsBadMan here is my F
---
I did, you are applying something that isnt there. The owner does not get flagged at all.  Only the person picking up the death bag.  The owner would have to shot the looter to get flagged.
---
Adventure is pretty safe right now. The only real exploit I know of is the workshop thing. You capture a workshop which makes you vulnerable to pvp anywhere on the map.  An opposing team goes to your workshop and his buddy finds you on the map. I think that is pretty dumb. Workshops should only be contestable in the immediate area.
---
At launch the subreddit was at 140K, it's now at 180K.
---
Yes, the subreddit has grown, however it *seems* that the amount of posts, the number of upvotes in the subreddit and the amount of daily interaction seems to be lesser than it was previously.
---
**Again, I didn't JUST use this subreddit as a determining factor**.
---
Up until 2 months ago, I could server hop and in every 3-5 servers I would find a nuke in the SBQ area. Now - I'm finding it to be in every 10-15. Meaning less nukes are being launched
---
I'm also finding servers I'm in don't have a full 24 players.
---
I'm also finding tons of youtube videos shitting on the game for the repair kits and how it's becoming pay-to-win and tons of comments agreeing with it and stating theyre "glad they don't play anymore"
---
So if you look at **literally** any of those ***other*** sources, then yes. I would say that player count is lower than it has been.
---
I was recently in Harper's Ferry where nearly all the Super Mutants that had spawned were legendary. I think it was about 33% 3 star legendary and 50% 1 star. So much loot.
---
I haven't felt like that since I was a kid and rode my bike to Toys R Us.
---
The black officer suit is indeed a rare one.
---
Alas that did not work for me, thank you anyways
---
Amy Kelly. I loved her little story.
---
hey same thing happened to me too. AND it was the same guy, "wonking".  I think he might know some sort of god mode-ish bug or something. Bethesda has to do something
---
Works shops are pvp zones they are taking the workshop
---
gotta love bug thesda
---
Bruh you really edited your post to make it look like you never said anything of what I said. Lol. Whatever. Either way, bad idea, shouldn't be a thing. Cause the person who picks up the loot can then just melee the owner and, oops, the owner's mutation kicked in, looks like they're gonna have to fight cause now they're stuck in PVP!
---
I think this one was a red herring. I like that the mystery is ongoing. 
---
On the other hand, if this is it..........they done F'd up. Lol
---
I have been lucky enough not to have crashed yet. And zero failed attempts. Although I've had some teammates crash. When that happens we try to stop the damage to boss to allow time to get back in, sadly most ransoms don't care/ know that someone is trying to get back in. Worst case scenario, we run it again.
---
I'll take a look tonight.
---
I was kidding! üòÇ
---
Initial thought: move to a more out of the way spot
---
I'm sure the military also forbids destroying a weapon so you can learn how to make a better part of the weapon with a box of nais and some bubblegum too, but that's still a feature in-game.
---
Yes, I'm assuming it's server instability.
---
That's because this game was an alpha sold as a full release. It's astonishing how much wasn't in the game on release.
---
I think the only person here whining here is you. When expressing a point you should avoid insulting people if you want to have discussion. Just a tip
---
No problem! Greetings from USA
---
I mean yeah, for now THIS is the red herring
---
Defend workshop events absolutely do count, five of mine were that. 
---
Defend from player events may not count, but the normal ones certainly do.
---
Counterview: Very awesome because of SM.
---
Saw him during the Beta and once since then lol.
---
And how exactly would one go about doing that? I ran the silo for the first time (solo) on Saturday and it was challenging to say the least. Anything to make it easier would be great.
---
Do you still have the whitesprings jumpsuit and would you sell it to me?
---
I am by whitesprings... but very stubborn I am torn on whether or not to hold my ground or to give up, I have such a nice spot and it was a level 200 that destroyed my base for 500 caps
---
Yup, that's what I am holding out hope will change.  Appreciate the alternative suggestion!
---
And the sheepsquatch counts as a robot right? For use with Troubleshooters gear?
---
Noticed, a couple of times, a single trash mob will die when I enter an area... I'll start paying more attention.
---
No sold it for 20k a while ago
---
Fortunately, I still have that one.  Otherwise, I'd probably have to do some suspension of disbelief and hope Grant had a few swords lying around.
---
Yes
---
Yeah, bases near Whitesprings is a big no-no. Don't do that
---
Thanks!  I'll have to keep a look out with the Vendors for one.
---
To be fair, if you're using a controller, there's going to be some overlap for actions. You're limited by how many buttons you have.
---
I wish people would be patient.  I'm willing to bet all my caps they plan on releasing a real squatch. 
---
From the trailer,  it looks waayyyyy different from the assaultron one obviously.  The one in the trailer has the same mouth as the one ppl datamined. 
---
No need to bother tf out of them on Twitter about it.  There are more important things to address.
---
&gt;Fully agree what is the point of making all these outfits available to find 
---
Because different people like different things. Nobody said you have to collect all of them. Having a lot of different outfits available isn't so *you* can have a lot, it's so a lot of different players can ask find something they like.
---
That said, displaying things would be nice, and is something they are working towards, but in a multiplayer game, it has to be secondary to server stability.
---
what if I get rocket turrents they got buffed alot
---
Holy cow!!!!! 20k???? Amazing
---
30k in three days... on PVP rewards? If you use level 100 as an average that would be 1200 player kills and no deaths. I call BS.
---
not the SMG, did in NV but not 76
---
It's like the plans for the brotherhood recon rifle. You don't even need gun perks to craft it.
---
You're missing the point... Don't build near Whitesprings. 
---
And trust me, I'm being nice about how I say it, some people will be jerks about it.
---
That's happened to me constantly since I first started playing the game, in Beta.
---
Hey I like this place :D
---
I highly recommend check this guy out.
---
I know bothering them isn‚Äôt the answer, this was just my shitty hot take on the whole conspiracy theory shtick, i thought the joking tone was pretty obvious, my b if it wasn‚Äôt!
---
Patch 9,early May.
---
Endangerol syringer + cryolater + tenderizer perk help a lot to kill her. Suppressor/blocker/Serendipity help for staying alive.
---
You should present it while wearing the clown outfit too.
---
LOL.
---
Whitesprings is a place most people go to farm xp and materials. If your camp pulls in the ghouls, people will get upset and probably trash your camp. I would suggest moving your camp. It being there makes it a big target.
---
That‚Äôs why I deleted the game off my system.
---
Yes I am tired of seeing it all these Bethesda please posts and no one ever getting anything from it so you frequently see reposts every week
---
Doesn‚Äôt work for adrenal reaction both class freak and strange in number. 
---
Grounded, adrenal, scaly skin, talons, twisted muscles, and if you wanna count herbivore and carnivore. That‚Äôs more than just 1 mutation
---
Thanks the last part I use, I did grab a cryolater the other day just need to make some ammo and I will try the rest next time.  Much thanks.
---
Counterview: keep on fighting the good fight. I know there's a vocal knee jerk reaction group, but rational folk like me read your statements too and I for one am grateful. Thanks for bringing up the truth.
---
any place further away that has water?  I am just look I g for a spot close  to AS and has water
---
Dude he‚Äôs not saying you get flagged for pvp if someone picks up your junk. C‚Äômon man.
---
That would be great, keep me posted please :)
---
Big oof on my part! 
---
Haha
---
Niiiice, thank you
---
I have adrenal, grounded, and twisted muscles, along with other mutations. The only mutation I currently have an issue with, is adrenal. That means the mutation is the problem, not class freak
---
He was until he edited his stuff to make it look like he never said it but go off I guess
---
"AS" ?
---
Whitespring is general bad place to build. Defenses or not. People just don‚Äôt care if your place looks like crap, a floating piece of filth or a mansion. Even if your on the far end and not near the golf club. 
---
Look up a map that showswhere all the resource deposits are and pick one that suits your needs. You‚Äôll likely be out the way for normal people and the only ones that will come out that way are griefers.
---
This seems to get brought up daily and is a good idea. Do a search on it and you will find a bunch of really good threads in this sub over the last 2 weeks.
---
Hmm... I feel like we should report these 'fake news' legendary nerfs posts as ... oh wait it does break the fo76 rules... 
---
Rule 7: No rumors without verified evidence
---
Yeah this is bullshit rumor mongering. Let's all report this to mods.
---
I was thinking of doing it but sounds like nada might be it
---
I used to ride on it every day, back in 2005-2009 we called it the PRT (Personal Rapid Transit I think this is correct if my memory serves me).  I lived next to the basketball stadium and caught the one on the engineering campus to the main campus. Mostly it got you from one place to another that would have been typically driven to and/or walked to on other campuses if not for the difficult terrain and lack of parking.
---
[deleted]
---
Please elaborate, I have the torso plans. Can‚Äôt recall where from though.
---
That or take a tesla rifle to the fight, and all of them explode prematurely.
---
Well, that's not good. This mutation was to play a crucial role for my build. Hope they'll fix it soon (if they ever acknowledge the issue).
---
Or maybe they could just add these things like a normal studio that cares about it's small player base
---
Or i enjoy the game i want. Other than the raid bosses i go it alone
---
And simply jumping in the air negates that
---
Ok yeah I‚Äôd love to meet up! If there is any sort of junk you want let me know. Let me know a time that works for you. It may be a little hard because I live in the U.S. but I bet we can make it work
---
Im not sure how it works for survial mode.
---
I wish we could get these stickied until they get fixed. It's not just everyday, it's about every hour. I haven't posted on any of them telling them to just look at threads on the first page, but... it's getting bad. Hopefully there is  a fix in for tomorrow.
---
Same here. I have all my stuff.
---
They demolish your base again?
---
Live free or ... DIE!
---
I think I‚Äôm onto a fix but I need your help, Bethesda support doesn‚Äôt reply to my tickets for a few days now. I‚Äôm positive that this freezing issue is related to bethesda.net. I‚Äôve noticed that my game starts those freezing sequences as soon as the initial sign in is finished and rolling circle on atomic shop and settings&gt;Bethesda.net stops and the menus are loaded. As a troubleshooting approach, I want to unlink my psn and Bethesda.net account and try it that way. It may just solve this problem temporarily. It‚Äôs been a week now and still no tangible response so, help us ladydevann, you are our only hope
---
This is all 100% anecdotal
---
I must have been too focused on dying repeatedly.
---
I didn't know the Wise Mothman was for an event i saw one out in the wild and shot it. I hope i didn't cause others to fail the event
---
I was at white springs last night doing a nukefarm run. T-60 Tricentennial PA and a TD gatling gun. Ran into a bunch of good players, if you be one of em.
---
I am having the same problem on ps4
---
Thank you for going back on topic. 
---
What the other posters failed to acknowledge was I said for fallout 76 and past and future fallouts. Plus it could be a good investment for them making money off ads or like you suggested a paid version but you can connect to it for free in fallout games.
---
As for everyone else maybe if steamers and some reddit users would stop trying to grab views by negatively assessing everything you would know that repair kits thing is so not the monster they made it out to be. They are providing better repair kits in game since when is pay to win something that can also be gotten in game?
---
Sadly, I never tagged the boss but I got the fedora and lots of metal scrap from the robot corpses.
---
I have definitely seen this.
---
Well upvote the topic and maybe it will get some attention but also I agree
---
I'm fairly certain Bethesda knows about this request and may or may not have included yet for a particular reason. With caps losing somewhere of a value lately this needs to be a feature. 
---
Also, I would like to throw out my own suggestion for future updates is the ability to craft and give mods to other plans. I usually don't like giving my guns to other people, so this is something I feel would help traders by a lot.
---
Do the codes reset tonight at 8pm or tomorrow? You might want to check and not do the run as you'll get there with no code figured out.
---
I noticed the same thing as well. Recieved maybe two legendaries that were two star or better until I broke LvL 75. Now that I'm almost LvL 90, i get one stars out the wazoo and two - three star on a regular basis.
---
He did edit it but I saw the other post and it was very clear with what he was saying. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a great idea but I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre really understanding what he‚Äôs trying to convey.
---
Huh, just checked the guide (which is full of mistakes anyway). They list Dread (lv 45) and Albino (lv 55) and Glowing (lv65) as variants.
---
Ever been to r/starwarsbattlefront?
---
If you are making it, make sure you've got super duper maxed out and applied when crafting (anything really). It gives you up to a 30% chance of double being made.
---
Yep... Can't deep pocket my marine armor even with armorer rank 3, can't attach mods to melee weapons even though makeshift warrior rank 5.  Ugh
---
So you want survival removed an slap damage re-implemented is that what you're saying?
---
My fallout 76 game keeps stopping and not responding And every time I do the sheepsquatch mission this is now the 10th time this is happened and I‚Äôm losing my shit
---
it doesn't it is way soulth of it, yo gui aren't too far
---
I still don't understand how cardboard boxes and hay bales outdoors are still around after 25 years, not to mention the 200 years in other Fallout games.
---
I have no currents at my camp
---
Or hook up plumbing so we don't have to even make boiled water anymore!
---
I‚Äôm level 92, been playing since BETA, and I‚Äôve got about 220+ hours in. I played Fallout 4 for about 500+ hours and I really enjoyed it. 
---
This game is different and better in a lot of ways. I‚Äôd give it a try if you‚Äôre interested. The main and side quests are pretty good and they‚Äôre adding more content now that the game has evened out. 
---
The negative reviews haven‚Äôt held up IMO. Sure there were (and are) some problems and Bethesda mismanaged the launch - but overall it‚Äôs a really fun experience.
---
Our local news specializes in jank!  Check out [this other recent local story](https://www.wsaz.com/content/news/Man-arrested-after-jumping-out-of-moving-vehicle-during-chase-507708671.html).
---
LOL. Such a pathetic attempt. Get lost.
---
What system are you on?
---
quote where exactly i said that.
---
No what i said was Survival has introduced more toxic players to ADVENTURE Mode, and these are my experiences. "discuss"
---
Try this run, you can do it, hop servers, and find more.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbLK42Y2\_Og](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbLK42Y2_Og) 
---
Also, once you equip those perks (especially maxed out), you'll find you never seem to go through cores that fast.
---
Bases near Whitesprings are fine if they're not 80% turret.
---
Marine is good if you are doing a bloodied build, since rads are your one true weakness there. 
---
Combat armor chest and heavy leather limbs is the best for pure numerical DR/ER 
---
For effects unyielding is great for bloodied builds and solid for others as the first level kicks in early on. Vanguard is good if you like to stim yourself up often. 
---
Sentinel which reduces damage when standing still (its a 3 star ability) is best for ranged characters. Its very strong. 
---
Cavalier which reduces damage when sprinting is the best for melee characters who need to close the distance. 
---
 Assassins is good for if you're a pvp player. 
---
If you like to farm one area with the same enemies then don't overlook getting some of the slayer ones that reduce damage.  Stack 5 of those and farming becomes much easier. But thats more for a specific scenario rather than general gameplay.
---
Sure you can. I finally got that quest at like... level 90ish or so? Far past the point where I was getting max level spawns. 
---
You just have to go there when you pop into a server and nobody is there. It won‚Äôt work every time, it won‚Äôt even work most times, but sometimes they spawn in low-level. And it may help to get a friend with a low level character to fast travel there first (again, when nobody else is there) then travel to them.
---
It can be effective if played to its strengths (no stimpak animation, pain train and stabilized) but just like anything else its weaknesses are exploitable, and not all power armor configurations are created equally. Same could be said for normal armor with carry weight instead of other affixes. I think it would be broken if power armor was always better in every scenario.
---
Well, last we checked, it was a forum for ALL.  no one cares what YOU'RE tired of.   Obviously people don't feel like they're being heard. So they're taking desperate measures.  People that get on here and tell everyone what THEY'RE tired of hearing are JUST AS BAD as the people who they're complaining about.
---
Would to have this. Build a greenhouse and put plants in it.
---
As the others said, there's a huge lag between trying to interact with him and when the quest gets given. 15-30 seconds sometimes.
---
Np. If at the very least just swap servers if things look grim.
---
Technically correct! I would imaging compost being of some use here.
---
Anyone catch the  Gordon Ramsey episode where he went to The Town's Inn in Harpers Ferry?
---
Would be funny to see that place in FO76 with the crazy owner inside with a story or quest
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone has completed the overseer‚Äôs mission, and the general theory is that we can‚Äôt complete it because it will continue in added content.
---
Yeah, it surprised me too. I was walking around one of the Junkyard workshops and noticed it when close to the concrete deposit.
---
Would love an update if you get your stuff relinked properly under new name.  I‚Äôve been on the fence about it because of just such a potential issue.
---
I meant more the Assaultrons and Mr Gutsys.  I don't think I want to get close enough to the suicide ones.
---
Oh yeah lol got quite a few guns lined up for him to use
---
You have to do the small story where you get the key code under greenes house.
---
Friends don't pay attention to lore, sometimes it's exactly what you need.
---
I‚Äôd rather see ‚ÄúBethesda Please‚Äù posts than yet more ‚ÄúREPAIR KITS OHMURGUHRD‚Äù threads.
---
"Choosing to stay on a server despite another person having built on your CAMPsite in it causes it to be irrevocably packed up and blueprinted"
---
No it doesn't.  It just doesn't appear.  (Unless you decide to move it.)
---
Hop to a different server and it will be back.
---
Hey you know what though:
---
&gt;it ***seems*** that the amount of posts, the number of upvotes in the subreddit and the amount of daily interaction seems to be lesser than it was previously.
---
It can seem that way.
---
Yeah but it's worth it, it's the first thing people see when they leave the Overseer's camp, it's nice having new people stop by every day and sit at the bar, I give new players a bunch of ammo/water/food and they tell me how much they like my place, it's awesome! I'd say it's worth it, met a lot of buddies so far.
---
There are quite a few mutations that don't seem to work with class freak. Grounded is one. In my tests it appears empath is another.
---
bethesda please stop the bethesda please posts
---
I have and like my furious explosive double barrel shotgun.  Deals about 300 dmg under normal conditions.  With Adrenaline perk engaged and active it‚Äôs higher than that.  I got that through a drop around lvl 75 (now lvl 163). 
---
My favorite weapon I bought from another player.  It‚Äôs an auto AA handmade rifle. Extra mods like suppressor and longer barrel and scope.  Armor piercing 5.56 bullets and larger magazine as well.  Does 90 ish dmg and coupled with tank killer perk, eagle eyes mutation and speed demon mutation and adrenal reaction mutation it‚Äôs a killer weapon.  I do a lot of killing in PVP mode with that one and stealth boy engaged.   I can bust off a lot of shots and the distance and accuracy is pretty decent.
---
And i did "discuss" by asking you a question that you dodged.
---
You're saying Survival brought out the worst, before Survival it WAS the worst, people DELIBERATELY in groups griefing via the workshop. Murdering players through slap damage. - it's better than than it ever has been.
---
So, if you hate survival mode, what changes would you make? Add the PvP restrictions that was promised at launch? Make adventure mode the same, primary default game mode?
---
I'm curious what your actual stance is here? Are you a fresh player that only started when Survival was added?
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Ultracite_power_armor
---
Fort defiance
---
Ahh, so new this year, gotcha. Still, this game predates that law ("games that are developed after Dec 31 ect ect"), as have their other Fallout games, which also had the subtitle system.
---
As a solo player, it was a fine experience that has now sort of ended. It hasn't provided a good playground to play with others imo, or any real reason to do so. I login now when they put in new stuff for play and they haven't done much there yet - not enough to make this something i can play most days.
---
That is what  I was going for. I admit that I should of taken more time to ensure it was worded better, lesson learned.
---
They probably couldn‚Äôt find an 18th.
---
I mean with regards to the ultracite power armor plans you can learn them from one of the terminals in the asylum after you complete the BoS questline.
---
Apparently all the ammo mods do nothing.
---
But...
---
The other side of the road works too...
---
Sounds good. Ill have to remember to update.
---
If i get it figured out.
---
probably AA explosive then. I have neither, just remembering what others are saying is the best set these days.
---
Uh, yeah - I figured this out maybe a week ago. And I didn't figure it out, a friend of mine did...I'm not quite 76 hours in but I have 3 toons spanning from 25-63.
---
Yikes...I need to find me a lead node - Would anyone be an upright citizen and let me know where one is? :) :)
---
I'll buy at least some of it from you.
---
I got a massage saying my workshop was getting overrun by sheepsquatch so I fast traveled all excited then the game froze haha.
---
cool :) I'd like that (Y)
---
Yeah, I only found out by accident when I fell over and decided not to call for help, and happened to pay attention to the notifications.
---
I started noticing this as well around level 95.  I‚Äôve been getting more 2* and 3* since.
---
..you got bamboozled! :P
---
Yup
---
Or an Acid node...after reading a comment about Lucky Hole Mine? Thanks everyone :)
---
Where'd you find the plan?
---
On Xbox also looking for help with nukes/ SBQ. Tried running them solo on Saturday, got the nuke launched, but game crashed during SBQ fight. Would be great if Bethesda put clan (Raider Tribes? Factions?) mechanics in place. Hit me up on the box, same tag.
---
I'm down. What time tomorrow? Got one more if needed
---
yeah I was so hyped when the one I stood in appeared as well, print-screening and all that jazz, 2 minutes later the storm passed :P so ..can confirm your comment! :P
---
Go to point pleasant and pick up a ton of the eggs. Pretty sure you get put on a hit list afterwards.
---
They were using the repair kits as support for their argument of backpack mods. Assuming is correct.
---
I feel it would add nothing of value. Sure, we as redditors might see less, but the Bethesda readers will be just as flooded. I'd rather leave it as is and let the better ideas float to the top, but that's just me.
---
I know the ultracite stuff was just there for the proposal of the suggestion I guess
---
The fixer I received was level 30 (I‚Äôm level 100+), why did I not get a level 50 fixer
---
I'd love that, and if not necessarily in adventure-mode then atleast in survival to spice things a bit extra up in there.
---
No one cares what YOU'RE tired of seeing, folks have a right to post what they want.  If it is outside of community standards, the mods will take it down.  All the "reddit police" telling everyone what they're tired of seeing are JUST as bad.  People that have issues that they have not been able to resolve in any other manner don't care what some little internet bully is "tired of seeing".  If you don't like a post, scroll on by...
---
That would require a new item.and defeat the purpose.
---
again read the OP, your clearly not doing that as i have said in the OP "i've plaid since beta" and if you read the other comments you'd see i'm level 108
---
I'm also said, in start contrast to what you just posted above, BEFORE survival it was not like this.
---
So again, if you want to have an actual discussion read the OP in it's entirety instead of making assumptions.
---
Then we can discuss.
---
As for what changes I'd make.
---
survival should be like Survival Mode in Fo4, once you go there you can't just go back, less you loose the chance to ever go survival again.
---
Spoiler much?
---
Dang it I sold all my cryolators
---
They‚Äôve said they‚Äôre looking into ways to deal with ammo you don‚Äôt want. Making boxes of ammo that you can sell may happen. Like a box of 100 for 30 caps or something (which is about the rate most ballistic ammo goes for when you sell them to players)
---
Just happened to me today at Pleasant Valley Ski. I checked the map to see if there was another player around. Scorched dropping dead before u fire a shot?
---
Hoping w can get Nuka Cola brewing stations eventually. Love me the Cola Nut perk!
---
You can get one at max level by crafting it. Everyone got a level 30 fixer
---
Do I have the plans by default or need to find them
---
Do you have hard numbers to demonstrate or is this just personal experience?
---
I ran westtek six times in a row and saw zero legendaries last night. Woke up this morning, ran it once and found EIGHT. Never seen eight in one run.
---
Hard numbers not assumptions, please. Having bad luck can lead to serious experimental bias.
---
It's the circle of whine.
---
First the whine posts.
---
Then the whining about the whining. (This thread)
---
Then the whining about the whining about the whining. (This comment)
---
You see those threads constantly because Bethesda released a game that was essentially an Alpha-quality FO4 multiplayer mod and tried to pass it off as a legitimate game.
---
I agree, Bethesda please get rid of these posts.
---
The bug complaints were on point, but most have been resolved for most people (I still see more ps4 issues being reported than anything else, but that's just hearsay really). Most of the content complaints were coming from the "we need NPC's to spoon feed us story" camp. The game is currently lacking in end-game content just like FO4, which is potentially being resolved in the next week or so with the first "raid" style instance.
---
I say again what I said before: If you enjoyed exploring FO4, checking out all the neat hidden stories you'd find on notes and holotapes and terminals, bopping hostile critters and just enjoying the setting, you'll enjoy the game. If you enjoyed FO4 because of the player choices and how they reflected in the story, you won't enjoy it, because as an MMO-style game, player agency is not really a factor (there is talk about it becoming a thing in the future, but that is nebulous and not worth considering in your decision on if you want to play or not). If you enjoyed making settlements in FO4, you might enjoy some of the CAMP system, although currently we cannot decorate with items in our inventory (which is also supposed to be coming soon).
---
Not sure what you‚Äôre talking about. I was asking the above commenter if he/she, as a data miner, has evidence Bethesda didn‚Äôt throttle the drop of good legendary items, as that‚Äôs my main concern. This commenter was talking about spawn rate of legendary creatures. I fully understand how randomness works.
---
Commercial glass in real life is really durable. Handles hail storms and you can‚Äôt sledgehammer through them. Shots sometimes have issues depending on the window. They usually don‚Äôt shatter because of the space and plastic in the middle.  
---
But the old games had greenhouse walls so that‚Äôd be what I would want. Would go great with my house/garage camp
---
I have the hat but the game is too stingy with atom for me to buy the outfit.
---
Pair this up with the planter boxes we find in-game!  These would be awesome.
---
I didn't know that sub existed until now, thank you! It's so fun!
---
was gonna say something about setting value to 0 but yeah never though about the scaming aspect of them just taking stuff...mainly cause i always just give away stuff for free

Quad does let you load 20 instead of 5. Don't know how it is after the recent patch since I havent bothered with it.

It‚Äôs happened to me too, I‚Äôve also heard others say the same thing. I believe it‚Äôs an ongoing glitch that will probably be fixed next patch if we make enough noise.

Congrats on launching your first Nuke!!

It does, yeah. The AI in this game is profoundly stupid.

It gets really weird in Watoga because the robot dispensers still spin up, and then they disgorge a dead robot into the street

Some things are multiplicative, some are additive. The only way to really tell would be to do some extensive before / after damage comparison testing.
---
My problem is that most of the people who are on reddit and play fallout 76 speaking english and I cant spek english very good and I dont know how they reakt to my english.
---
(Iam from Germany)
---
Omg ahahah
---
I have 5 characters with a combined level of over 500.
---
I‚Äôve got some insane weapon drops... on other characters or of weapons I don‚Äôt use.  Multiple cryolaters and golf clubs with near perfect rolls.  Took my chances joining games of friends and swapping characters and moved them around.
---
Best thing I found?  Unyielding sentinel luck combat leg... off a vendor.  I think someone was trying to xfer to an alt and it went south.
---
The correct answer has already been stated:  perks and how you play the game make a big difference.  Play the game, or reroll for another play style.  Heavy, melee, pistol, rifle, and shotgun all play a bit different.  Let‚Äôs just hope the purveyor isn‚Äôt some useless gimmick and gives us a reachable goal.
---
Was on PC myself, it was rather dead though. I've been mucking about with melee on this character and she's dropping most of em in one hit so I tend to make sure the place is clear first. Did check the map to see if anyone was available to come hit on the 3* though, I will throw up the follow-me emote any chance I get with those opportunities.
---
You mean this subreddit isn't a direct line to Bethesda's developers who 100% definitely don't get told what to do by a manager who has pretty much nothing to with the design aspect of the game?
---
Adding to this. Did the event today with two others, and for the entire event there were maybe 6-7 mole miners total. No question BGS nerfed this event in the last patch.
---
also you can find terminals and make the turrents work for you. look for side rooms

"Te be fair \*hic\* it *is* a lot of bullshit generated by my \*hic\* random statement generator."

I would say its a great time to get into it.  by the time you're done the main story etc. you'll have a lot of extra end game stuff to work on as well.
---
Yeah, the spring loaded spike board traps. There are ones you can put on walls or the floor, I use the floor ones. Stand on them then active and they send you flying!
---
Yes! Yesterday it happened to me as well, for the first time ever. One of the times I wasn‚Äôt even in a blast zone!
---
I like this idea. Right now I'm using powered garage doors for this.
---
Yeah luckily
---
It does work in adventure mode though? I haven‚Äôt had an issue in adventure for a while, but it‚Äôd be nice to have this in my back pocket.
---
I said this in another reaponse: they drop from the sheepsquatch impostor
---
I will totally play with you! I'm on PC my name is kepharel my German is not that great either, but would love to play with you if you're online look me up

I‚Äôm 130 and the only thing I‚Äôve found is a two shot dragon. Meh.
---
Great post thanks for the laugh, will have to try this.
---
Shhh, let them believe lol.
---
As a side note, I find it just as irritating when, after something minor is implemented, the same people basically drop to their knees and praise the devs. "They listened!" Happens way too often with anything involving Valve.
---
This is such a lovely story to read, thank you for sharing!

Ah, I got one too yesterday. Thought that was a bit weird. Fortunately I hadn't bought the plan yet.

This lone wanderer hasn't launched a nuke yet, so it is peaking my interest.

People rarely fight over the power plant workshops in my experience. I bet you just got unlucky. For power armor, your best bet is to do the Miner Miracles quest. You'll get a free set of Excavator power armor, which increases yield when mining and has 100 extra carry weight (and get 200 extra with calibrated shocks). I think others have stated how to start that quest already in other replies here.
---
If you need cores, I'll be on for a bit tonight and I can help you take the power plants and keep them. We can take all 3, should get 12 cores every \~15-20 minutes. IGN same as my reddit name.

How much for the quad hunting rifle?

Your level has nothing to do with it, i started a fresh character no less than 30 hours ago, it's level 47. Level means nothing and again, you're wrong as someone else pointed out below adventure mode before survival was a fucking disgrace. Own a workshop? Give it 30 minutes you had a team killing you GUARANFUCKINGTEED. It was FULL of people trying to murder you gia slap damage to provoke a fight so they could unyielding/cavalier DCG you in 1. Or Vanguard/assassin sentinal. 
---
You saying it wasn't this bad is a blatant lie to justify the ranting. Everyone knows before Survival mode was added PvP in adventure mode was a cancer on the community, now they have a place to go with the occasional spineless guy too scared to play Survival and hunts on Adventure mode to be a dick.
---
And before you start going on about your level again, i have a 196, a 97, 47, 17, and multiple 5's, i've been playing since the BETA. 
---
Trust me, you don't have a clue what this was like prior to Survival regardless of your claims.
---
I'm level 194 now and never seen/found a TSE but there are plenty of great weapons out there for the casual user. I've found a Mutant's Explosive weapon, does extra damage when mutated. This is great as I'm always mutated. Hunter's Explosive Shotgun, which does extra damage against animals. Also, who doesn't want more firepower against those Yao Gaos and Radscorpions? But still, I find my favorite weapon is my instigating golf club with 40% swing speed...not just is it a killer but it sounds AMAZING on the whiffs. :)

That's crazy! How in the world would a post-apocolyptic wanderer be capable of making sheet glass wind....

I drain it as far as possible to get caps, scrap, and stimpaks.
---
Doesn‚Äôt seem to drop level 50 loot though, but hey, its good for trading...
---
I understand this point. I‚Äôm lucky if enough Mass and Fluids to craft more than 5 stable. 
---
Never have to worry about dehydration though....
---
If your looking for armor try hitting white spring with no armor a few times. A Reddit user reported increased Drops Of Armor when wearing no armor and what I saw this weekend seem to support that when rolling with just a hazmat suit. I can't speak to Quality but frequency will definitely increase which could lead to improved quality...
---
U can lock it like doors but only u can get it. ( just a theory)
---
Seems like a lost cause. For some reason people cant understand that they wont like every feature in a game, that games aren't tailor made to their specific wants and needs.
---
I would like to.
---
Does the game need another patch download tomorrow?
---
Yeah, sometimes it just does it, I was taking a power plant and all of the enemies on the outside died.
---
Just don't go throwing rocks in your house.
---
Most damage boosts from different sources are multiplicative, occasionally some will be additive but thats usually with sneak attacks which tend to be additive with instigating I believe. 
---
As for damage reduction/ increase buffs/debuffs. It looks like they apply before resistance is accounted for. 
---
So for tenderizer it upgrades the damage by 5/6/7% before comparing it to DR. And for ones that lower damage you take blocker/fireproof it seems like they go before DR calculation as well. 
---
To figure out how much % DR blocks its dependant on the damage value. Where if both are equal then its 50% reduction I believe. Its got massively dimishing returns though so stacking manytimes over the need DR only gives marginal benefits. The DR pen abilities lower what your targets effective DR is. So 75% pen means 400 is treated as 100. 
---
In pvp DR is negligent since player armor pen is so easy to get on the popular weapon types and vats criticals ignore DR entirely.
---
I haven't looked into the code so there may be some errors and this is only based on basic testing and player accounts as well as some assumptions. 
---
But you get the general gist. Its complicated, % reductions on damage are really strong because they seem to calculate before DR is compared to damage. Which explains why sentinel/ assassin is so powerful.  Most danage boosts stack multiplicatively if from different sources, so thats why bloodied builds are so stupidly powerful.
---
The lag as well as blue screens and ‚Äòcontrols temporarily disconnected‚Äô till they get permanently disconnected.. sux
---
If you go to the overseer's camp and follow the river north, there is a few nodes (3 I think) on one of the rock formations on the right bank (again, if you're in it and facing north). Not even a minute's walk from the place.
---
the fact that there's the idea of a standard procedure for outrages like this makes me sad.
---
I want to like 76 and all, but it's like watching someone take a multiple choice test and just answering C blindly on everything, even when C isn't even an option to pick.
---
Where is that?
---
Dude I'm just wondering. Sheesh.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/
---
Are you sure Adrenal &amp; Bloodied stack additively? Everything I've checked so far is multiplicative, with the exception of the weapon class perks. Nerd Rage and Adrenal Reaction are multiplicative, for example.
---
Fantastic your so lucky none of my friends play they think I‚Äôm odd but  gaming actually keeps u thinking which can‚Äôt be bad. I play on PlayStation my name is nuttynana2001 I would love to join you. I actually joined in on the sheep squatch last night it‚Äôs crazy but so much fun everyone running round like headless chickens
---
They have weight reduction perks though...
---
Sure it's nice, but too many super mutants and scorched. 2/5 would not recommend
---
As a lover of Ark, I played Conan wanting a change and defo got it. Absolutely loved that game for like a month because there is no end game.I'm replaying it now and the game still lacks an end game.  The PVP is jiust a joke.  If you love building though, you will adore this game.
---
Another note, I've been playing 76 between boredom streaks on Conan, lol.
---
Holy shit....I‚Äôve been cooking my grenades for no reason?????
---
To be fair it was awful nice of them to schedule themselves in to work without pay and add features to live products based on what some people on the internet said.
---
You and me both. I've been farming Liberators... well.. not so much farming as "seeking out" Liberators, every where I can.
---
Yes Im on the buildable Pylon and in range of blocking someone using junk extractor, but its been attempts to get me to pvp them and wildlife ignore my camp since its high enough they can't burrow in. 100% sure its people server hoping to find a camp to try and force someone to pvp, each time they will keep attacking base till I fight back and noticed multiple times they had teammates hiding and fell for it a couple of times. Even then if someone there its a lot of effort and anger for someone to fast travel up top of the hill and walk down to just destroy it instead of changing servers.
---
Same here.  It worked without any issues.
---
Thank YOU @ladydevann! The community isnt always kind.... you have to deal with ignorant comments but there are good things out there too!
---
This is what I do. Sometimes I hit the trade subs as well.
---
Ive managed to get lvl 5 1* legendarys from high lvl 3* supermutants soi totally agree. Farming legendary s is kinda pointless now
---
Hell yeah I am, people are so self entitled it's making me sick on a daily basis. No respect for dev time or priority
---
I know that if you're overweight on death, there WAS a bug that forced you to respawn at Vault 76, but it was fixed.
---
But I've been seeing a number of previously fixed bugs becoming unfixed, so there's a good chance that it's returned.
---
My dude the Enclave didn‚Äôt build Raven Rock after moving East. It‚Äôs based on a real world government facility. It was already there. They even state IN 76 that it exists AT THE TIME OF 76.
---
Even if that is true, ‚Äòstated to only be IN Mariposa‚Äô, you do realize that could easily be interpreted as ‚ÄòMariposa is the only source of FEV in California‚Äô not the entire world. I‚Äôm pretty damn sure there‚Äôs nothing anywhere in the original lore that says ‚ÄòFEV has only ever been found here, ever, it exists nowhere else‚Äô, but I‚Äôd be happy to review a source.
---
And I‚Äôll grant you, that may be true- but you‚Äôve also clearly not looked into any of the Appalachian BoS lore, because they DIDN‚ÄôT just recruit random people. The original BoS was formed of ex-US Army personnel, and Maxson used the sattelites to recruit- go figure- ex-US Army personnel. The Appalachian BoS? Largely only accepted ex-US Army. Plus, that logic doesn‚Äôt even really work? Like, you‚Äôre talking about 200 years later, when their ideology has evolved into an obsessive hoarding of technology and they essentially worship Maxson as a God. Organizations change over time. Especially in a post apocalyptic wasteland.
---
Anyway, this is enormously off topic, so I‚Äôm done arguing with you.
---
ETA = EDITED TO ADD numbnuts
---
Didn't you post the exact same thing a few hours ago?
---
Original didn't get enough attention?
---
Yeah I killed a level 16 super mutant that I swore regenerated health and then it had a drill in it's loot and I bet that's what happened there.
---
Oh snap! I did not know that! Very helpful! Thanks!!
---
In all fairness to the youtube side of things - I worked extremely hard to make a video showing the best methods for farming Ultracite ammo mats, and showed that you could craft 100K+ in less than 2 weeks, and it got very low views and hateful comments which I deleted (I don't mind people voicing their opinions, but if people are actually just going to videos to shit on a game in a hateful comment, no thanks).
---
My point is that making actual useful videos just doesn't do anything, but hate videos seem to get the views. It's why I haven't covered 76 much. I saw a guy with 200K subs post a video on how to farm a certain material, and he got less than 2K views. That's just abysmal. 
---
IDK man. People just love to hate. Then again, looking at Elder Scrolls Blades monetization practices, BGS is going down a very dark road that I don't think I will be willing to follow.
---
Many of the locations I have gone to no longer spawn Legendary enemies with the exception of one or two spots but they are rare.  The best spots are still Whitesprings and WestTek in my opinion.
---
If they lower the frequency of Legendary spawns, they should make the loot consistent.  If you kill a Three Star enemy, they should always drop a Three Star item.
---
I also heard that armor has a 60% drop rate whereas weapons have a 40% drop rate.  I cannot confirm this but as a strictly Power Armor based build, this annoying.  Especially when it is Wood Armor at Level 188.  Armor and weapon drops should be 50/50 not 60/40.
---
I would like to know more about the Purveyor and how he will function so we get a better understanding on why Legendary spawns are being reduced.  Will you be able to sell him Legendary items to get Tokens for specific or random Legendaries?  Will those Tokens be used to buy your own Legendary effects to apply to a weapon or armor piece?
---
I personally want it to tie into crafting.  Crafting weapons and armor at End Game serve no purpose other than completing challenges for Atoms.  It would be nice to craft the specific item you want and have some way to make that item Legendary.
---
I can't craft it too... I have the plan for the receiver...
---
Searching the subreddit for ‚Äúnukashine‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt seem like you‚Äôre the only one this has happened to in the past day or so. I wonder if they put a time limit of a month on it. That‚Äôs a very odd choice if they did.
---
They've improved a lot since launch but still have room for some more. I use a plasma pistol on one of my chars and it's fine. Like anything it's a matter of perks etc.
---
Probably meant WS.
---
Have you changed it back to the original to see if that fixes your issue?  The warning said you can change it back for free but that also might not work.  It's worth a shot.
---
I believe that is intentional so that you don't accidentaly scrap it while spamming the scrap button. It forces you to use a different button so that it doesn't matter how many times you press it while not paying attention.
---
23 days after tomorrow
---
Ignore him. He posts that in every thread.
---
I agree. For aesthetic purposes maybe yellow for your marker and the toned down creamy colour for team mates?  I would be super happy with that.
---
Two things. 
---
1st, I‚Äôve not yet felt the need to do anywhere close to this level of self-preservation  shit to take workshops and if I find myself needing to, I‚Äôll be fine with this game. 
---
2nd. I feel that Workshop PvP should only happen if both parties are in the workshop zone. Will stop cross map Sniping in its tracks.
---
13/15?! You jammy bastard, I must be in the 30s now and I've not even got the initiate paint. Bomber jackets coming out my ears though.
---
Ah
---
Sure thing! I'm "BozoBBozo", and typically online from 8pm-10pm most nights. I don't think I have anything to offer a level 61, but I'd be happy to be cannon fodder.
---
It's a very old bug, Bethesda doesn't know what version control is
---
i heard that watoga was a good area
---
dont know yet still in school at the moment.
---
I ran into you the other day online, you hooked me up with Nuka Cola paint jobs and some incredible items sounds like you found your end game, helping out the newbies! You rock @toxic_razz!
---
Do agree on the part "make legendary mutations actually MEAN something". With my PA + Gatling gun setup, I can drop max level 3\* legendary ghouls or glowing ones in a few shot, sometimes they can't even get the health regen. 3\* legendary should mean something, harder to fight and of course better loot...
---
It doesn't
---
Whoa found my new sub! I‚Äôve been trying to collect all the different bears I come across, I accidentally scrapped so many so I have to remember I have them on me. I hope to display them once we get those abilities.
---
Or added some lore to it. Put the fixer near a note that‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI only had time to make this shitty prototype‚Äù
---
It was a daily quest I did yesterday that has you gathering air, water, and soil samples. It started in a trailer in the southeast part of The Forest. Can't remember the name of the location. It was something like a power station.
---
Only on the small nodes, not the ‚Äúholes‚Äù that would allow an extractor.
---
I found the outfit in world yesterday. I think it was in one of the houses in Summerville.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs essentially what I do now. Just help out people who need a hand. I‚Äôm looking forward to the burrows dungeon tomorrow hopefully it‚Äôs something that can be repeated over and over for decent rewards.
---
So, shoot everything that moves? Got it B)
---
Ah, well they're being tools.  I love it when someone camps there.  It's always fun to see people's designs for the spot.
---
I'm on the cliff above that, and at least on PC, there is rarely anyone at your pylon.  Also, I've been camped there since December and haven't had any griefing problems at all
---
I‚Äôve never really noticed tbh. But honestly 25 rad resist isn‚Äôt very noticeable anyways. Only way it‚Äôs really effective is in a full set I find.
---
If you get lucky and the charred to be legendary you will get more 45 and 50
---
I agree but it would still make sense to have it work regardless. I‚Äôve been wanting 25 rad on some of the pieces so I don‚Äôt have to do lead lined limbs. It makes a difference when running around cranberry bog. Stuff like the queen, I doubt it will have much effect. So hauling around a 2 star that acts like a 1 star is a bit annoying.
---
Yeah but yesterday he didn‚Äôt misspell the title.
---
I know right it seems like nobody knows that it's the easiest way to get legendaries more show up then you in your  Uranium  Fever And its spawns higher level enemies then uranium fever
---
But GTAVO had almost nothing in it at release and was severely broken.... There were a few crappy missions, some races, and some pvp matches.... There was very little to do.... ESO had veteran dungeons as far as high end stuff goes but there wasn't much point in them unless you absolutely wanted something from them.... But endgame is a MMO thing really.... Dungeons and raids are one small portion of a game yet in MMOs that is all you do and the rest of the world becomes obsolete... Honestly I don't want that focus in this game ever and prefer they expand the sandbox aspect with way less focus on straight up scripted crap that everything else has. Endgame has destroyed online RPGs and turned them into linear grinds. I want more Star Wars Galaxies less World of Warcraft so I sure hope they don't start putting all their focus in scripted instanced crap.
---
It‚Äôd be really nice if they add some classic Fallout outfits, like the NCR Ranger outfit, Caesar‚Äôs legion armor, armored vault suits, classic fo3 10mm pistol skins and so on.
---
I noticed this while playing last night. The legendary enemies have absolutely no fanfare about them currently.  Sometimes they still say ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù but they have no stars or anything near them. 
---
I got a Vampires Western, Vampires .50 MG, Zealots 40mm,  and an Anti Armor 10mm Pistol I‚Äôm going to give a shot later tonight. All from unassuming enemies. 
---
If anything my legendary game has been better since the patch, I‚Äôm getting legendaries that are actually useful and good for once and getting them in relatively good numbers for someone that just explores around casually instead of meta-game legendary farming.
---
I don‚Äôt know why every one is say take over the power plants. 1 Perk, 2 levels of
---
Full Charge. Allows you to Sprint for no charge loss. 
---
Being over encumbered counts as Sprinting but no speed boost. 
---
I‚Äôve gone through 1-2 cores in 40 levels only because of jumping.
---
You should be able to hit the person, Wanted status does not take away your PvP experiences. Might want to chalk it up to a bug but I can confirm you can fight back
---
Thank you! I knew that I‚Äôd read the post but Google was failing me and I couldn‚Äôt remember your handle.
---
They might've been wearing sentinel assassin or cavalier assassin armor
---
I'm a kill everything person.  If I know it's going to be worthwhile. To date all the unmarked legendary loot from non-multi star enemies all drops as 1*. That's not worth my time. If it was proven fact that your new system dropped 2 and 3 star loot I'm okay with it.  However your posts are pretty condescending; you might get more upvotes without name calling and dramatic exasperation.  To sum, not everyone wants to play like you want to play.  Who are you to dictate how the game should run? That you Todd?!?
---
I saw it once near Charleston Station. Was pretty amusing watching them all wander past.
---
I've been wondering why they changed the stash transfer mechanism. I mean there was nothing wrong with the way it was before why did they change it.
---
I can't help tonight, but I can help you this weekend. At that point the new codes should be available online to use. I've done it once on my first character, but I do need to do it still on my other main one. GT is ResoluteSpark19.
---
No. It makes me happy to see people demonstrating an interest in the game. While most of the posts are mundane bullshit quite a few of them are incredibly interesting.
---
700 caps
---
That‚Äôs what I thought. Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt happen again when I actually have to fight back. Thanks for confirming!
---
No problem, anytime, and better luck next time lad
---
"I am one with the L√ÑMP, the L√ÑMP is with me."
---
By now most of those suggestions have been repeated ad nauseam
---
This is why I‚Äôm replacing the T-60 in my collection with Excavator, just gotta build the legs and it‚Äôs all done and purty
---
Same here, really hope this gets fixed this week as the scout mods pretty much double the current strength. 
---
Is there any news yet on when this will be fixed?
---
I like the idea but I must disagree with some of what you say, I'd say I've seen more "flaming" legendaries and 3* legendaries in general recently. I play about 10-12 hours a day so I'm not just making this up. It has been happening since survival had the kill legendary enemies challenge. Being able to spot the stars when your in a team is useful as it prevents someone obliterating them before everyone can tag to get loot. If people want to just go round and pick out the 3* that's their prerogative, but I can't say I've met any players who just kill the legendary and leave the rest alone.
---
This is all in your head, you won't get max level fear from enemies that aren't max level, it's been like this for an age. Find the best places and visit them. Beefing server hopping spawns is a good idea as all you're doing is hopping and cheesing it. There's more legendaries out there than before, play the game A LOT and I've really noticed this recently.
---

---
Ok, will definitely try!
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs just a little disheartening when all ur bros are persuaded by YouTube and majority too stop doing something you all enjoy.
---
I do have 3 friends who still play though. But that‚Äôs 3 out of 10 still playing.

---
I love that Bethesda is actively involved on reddit and listens to what we want
---
A max-level 1* anti-armor, two-shot, or bloodied is going to get you 90% of the way to the best ranged weapon. The explosive affix is big, but not necessary, as it was. On the trade forums, you‚Äôre going to see the 0.01% drops, but that doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúmost‚Äù players have those.
---
What stops them from following you and jumping in front of your bullets to pull aggro? The easier solution here is to store your junk as often as possible so you can minimize the junk you lose. Stop using pack rat and accept day 1 death mechanics
---
Are you sure it doesn't just craft with a more powerful receiver than the standard combat rifle?
---
Thanks for the callout, I was looking for their names!
---
Yeah it wasn't recently, but after the latest patches (I just hadn't made the post until today).
---
That being said, I finished the Sheepsquatch and relevant questlines, but kinda bummed I can't craft any alcohol since I never got plans for the distillery/related workbenches.
---
I can also say that a friend of mine did build a distillery workbench in my camp to craft something for himself (which I suspect could be what cancelled out the questline).
---
Couldn‚Äôt u count completing all the Quests as an end to the game?
---
Yes. But I'm mostly tired of the "Bethesda pls is not fair that I don't get 3423432 3 star legendaries per day why do you have to make the best gear in the game difficult to obtain reee" posts.
---
So your PvP players just follows the PvE player and can force the engagement by jumping in front of bullets if they go after a mob. It's just a pointless mechanic and I guarantee it'll cause more harm then good. Avoid it all by storing your junk often
---
Brilliant :D
---
Good news! I do have it!
---
Yes, mods and even admins can only sticky 2 posts.
---
They just have to jump in front of their gunfire when dealing with a mob
---
IDK.   that would mean it hinges on you completely not noticing the pop up.  if you DO notice it, and you hit the cancel button (which is otherwise universal in the game), then it causes you to scrap unintentionally.   
---
If they were just trying to stupid proof it, they would have made cancel still be cancel, and have "scrap" be a third different key, **Y** on xbox lets say.
---
Honestly, if you are just wildly spamming the scrap key without even looking at the screen, totally ignoring the fact that you have items mixed in that you dont want to scrap....  then you deserve to lose your favorited item.
---
Really, they should just make it so the favorited stuff doesnt appear on the scrap list at all, just like legendaries, that wouldnt be a big burden, you can only have what 12 favorites total?
---
There was a bug where you wouldn‚Äôt mutate or it would just randomly go away
---
Agree about SBQ but I've done encrypted a few times today on my level 30, held 1 to 3 pylons, not died and been the guy that brought a cryolator that turned sheepy into an ice sculpture. Noobs can be useful at that one to a degree. Just maybe not level 5 dumbasses that spam for help every 30 seconds.
---
Except if they are pacifist they can't slap. If they weren't pacifist the other guy could do what you mention anyway. I'm ambivalent on this topic anyway, wouldn't care if they add it or not. Just pointing out the holes you're poking in the idea aren't really holes at all.
---
Could be... I haven‚Äôt played in a year or so
---
I‚Äôm online now when you‚Äôre ready, PSN-SentinelMage97
---
Could also make the caps back with the stuff you find, that you don't need/want.
---
Good to know, I've been collecting outfits
---
Gave him 995 rounds didn't even say thank you. Avoid.
---
When people have figured out how to abuse wanted mechanics and electrically charged mutations, do you really think this wouldn't be abused as well?
---
Oh I apologize I worded that poorly. I‚Äôve spent the past several weeks putting in close to 50 data. I got it on number 13 out of 15 from *that batch.* I had been doing it one at a time, but when I used my mule to drop 15, one at a time, I had a lot more success.
---
It's a good balance too. I've moved to a few of the different nodes, the junk and lead one up by the space station was nice.
---
300 caps
---
You don‚Äôt HAVE TO BUY repair kits. You can still repair items, without them.
---
But that takes you just a few levels more than 50. Not much of a change. 
---
I've reach level 87 and personally I just don't see why should I bother with XP. A higher number doesn't crank me up I do not enjoy grinding events to have a bit of a chance to get some useful loot. My stash if sull of components and few guns/armors, but 99% of legendaries I've found were total crap walking cane with +10% dmg against players. Perhaps I didn't expected this game to be that much of a looter shooter. 
---
Perhaps one day, when private servers will be available, I could fine tune some settings and enjoy this game properly with a couple of friends. Till this time I just keep an eye on updates and hop in from time to time to check out.
---
Ah, guess that was before I started playing with mutations.
---
Side note, I have noticed a lot more plans in toolboxes and metal boxes and such. Used to ignore those.
---
I bought 2 copies of 76 for me and a buddy, and don't get me wrong - I'm enjoying my time playing because I love Fallout. 
---
However, comparing it to other games, seeing what BGS is doing and how they're sticking to their outdated engine and their monetization and greediness over the past year, I definitely won't be buying another game from them unless they pull a full 180.
---
And yeah, hate video do seem to get more views and such. Sorry that it didn't work out for you :/
---
Yep. For sure.
---
The mods really need to make a megathread weekly
---
I tried it but not only the game crashes but that causes a hard PC crash. Is it possible that the key is no longer valid? I have bought the game from one of those key sites
---
Happened to me so many times now, I've not even gotten to finish the event once. I opened my pipboy quick to eat some food and my game hard crashed. I died 7 times, someone stole my junk, and then crashed right after. I just want to do the event at least once :(
---
I think it is important to remember that Bethesda uses this as their primary source of feedback. They have said as much. That feedback influences the changes that are made going forward, so I don't find it strange at all that people are using this forum for its most productive end.
---
My theory is that duping and unbalanced tables early on flooded the market and they needed to pull it back. I haven't found really any new legendaries that replace the stuff I found early on. I'm OK with this, but if I were starting out, it would probably be painful.
---
I'm sitting on a bunch of really great legendaries that I want to unload, but trading is hard. I can't just give them away, but I'd love to get them out there. I'm waiting for player vending. But I think a lot of folks are like me.
---
I just want my energy weapons to  work like theyre supposed to. Lol
---
Are you looking for legendary or non-legendary? If you just want non-legendary I can make you a full set if you bring me the mats. I can make the arms and torso in BoS and the legs in polymer.
---
Heh, I do completely miss the pop cause I'm still in the habit of just hitting the scrap until my weapon list is empty in my main. So it has saved me a few times when I'm on an alt that has some no legendary favorite weapons.
---
It's in the game already.
---
You on now?
---
That's new to me ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø¬†doesn't change the fact you're a snowflake. No one was an asshole what kind of fucking pansy calls kind helpful users assholes. Get off your high horse
---
Yeah I know, I'm not blaming Beth here. As I said - the game was almost buttery smooth for me at beta and after release. I didn't even had any major or minor issues. Just the one with being stuck in PA, but used a workaround from here to fix it, so not much of a harm done.
---
Perhaps just bad timing when I've get back to game it was the peek of duping and exploiting.
---
Recently I've bought a copy for my fiance and from time to time we play togheter, not long and (sadly) not often, about 1 to 2 hours per week, but the servers seems to work just fine.
---
"Bethesda please..."
---
"Everyone hates this game but I love it because..."
---
"This new update messed up..."
---
"Thank you for finally..."
---
There would only be funny pics and videos without these posts, and I'd like this sub a lot more if that was the case
---
Right, but that doesn't mean it is. In my personal experience we are getting more players, but that doesn't make it so either.
---
I'll take "Bethesda Please" over people throwing shade at the game or company. I think I get more annoyed over people's sense of entitlement though. Like, chill out, we're all human and capable of making mistakes!
---
Everyone seen the tight rope and the viewing platform south of whiterun? Couldn't find a skeleton at the bottom tho disappointingly
---
‚ÄúOther plays may initiate PvP with you by attempting to Claim if from you!‚Äù You have to agree to that in order to claim. If you don‚Äôt want PvP, don‚Äôt agree to the dialog box and don‚Äôt claim workshops
---
I have to say first hand experience using a cryolator helps out massively. I have a furious cryolator and I kept the sheep on ice and we cleared it under 5mins.
---
I would love to have a Nuka plant event!

Don't just focus on one thing, obsessing over a TSE is not a good idea. Getting a weapon to do over 200 damage requires a lot of tricks and currently my TSE rifle doesn't break 200 or get close to it. Maximise the potential of your build and play with your cards to get the best damage but I will say now, breaking 200 is only going to be happening with super high damage guns and most probably Bloodied weapons. If you want a TSE go buy one in the trading forums, the prices have taken a dive so now it's time to buy, if you've been playing since the start you'll have enough caps to get one!
---
The serums are supposed to give you a "clean" version of the mutation that doesn't have any negative effects. (The terminals in the Enclave science area talk about this.) The way it works though is when you apply the serum, you'll have a clean version (which you can confirm has no negative effects in the status effects on your PipBoy), but whenever you log out and log back in, the negative effects permanently reappear. I've wondered if this has been fixed too... but a few months ago I wasted a lot of caps on a mutation that was clean for about an hour, and haven't wanted to risk the caps again to find out.
---
here I thought this was a legit question... and it turned out to be a pot/kettle humblebrag.
---
Yup, not sure if you are adding to what I said or think I'm disagreeing with yer views, but I'm with ya.
---
How many caps
---
And I'm ps4 too so if you want to go out shredding and look for legendaries just yell and I'll take you to some nice places.
---
I‚Äôm just adding. I think we both agree, just others think I‚Äôm pro-grief
---
Same. I milked Chally Moo-Moo (Graham‚Äôs Brahmin) and he became hostile and slugged me once with a super sledge. Life‚Äôs rough in the wasteland.
---
Easy fix if you have a friend and want to move your camp for free is to have them make a new character, travel to you, then you log out and they place the camp where yours is, then you can move for free if you only need to move a bit or are short on caps.
---
That helps. But not everyone knows or has access to a cryolator. 
---
In general it‚Äôs still good solid advice to follow. Regardless of the battle.
---
Hi, you are level 77, you are a high level
---
The receiver it comes with gives a crit damage bonus and nothing more.
---
Cianabbott07 add me as playing all alone and it‚Äôs boring!! That goes for anyone who needs a hand as I‚Äôm all finished and may well turn it off for good
---
Yes. Have had this intermittent problem on PS4 since before the last patch. Very annoying.
---
Make an offer, i have seen it vary
---
Like 2k
---
You have become the very thing you despise...
---
I can‚Äôt imagine why someone would pass up a group of enemies of any type..just seems wasteful not to take them all down even if just for the exp.
---
I also like executioners
---
I would imagine
---
Found a level 400 player. Killed him about 8 times. Most people were level 200+
---
Watoga has been completely nerfed as far as enemies the stroll around outside goes, anywhere else I'm not sure. I like people who pretend they are "data miners" just for upvotes and provide absolutely no data other than their weak lies. Server side data isn't minable and If Bethesda tweaks something like tunables it will not show up in the player side game data. Watoga was nerfed to hell, swallow this truth and get over yourselves.
---
Shooting a little higher. It's rare and sought after, the event sucks.
---
Don't you know? It's the continuation of the good ol' "Dragon falling from the sky" bug from Skyrim. It's now a recurring feature in all Bethesda games. Appreciate it. :)
---
Ok, guess that explains why it doesn't give a leveled one.
---
That is all kinds of lame. This sounds like a bug/exploit
---
There are assholes who will latch on to anything they can to make you feel bad. Your accent, your name, your shoes... whatever they can get.
---
In reality, they‚Äôre just assholes, and your English is only a problem if it prevents you from communicating. Anyone who isn‚Äôt an asshole will do their best to talk to you, or they will ignore you like they ignore everyone else who talks at them. 
---
Basically, what I‚Äôm saying is ignore the assholes. You‚Äôll never get better at English if you don‚Äôt practice, and a video game is a fantastic place to do that.
---
Just build your house with no walls, and use posts where you need them
---
I thought it was as common as the mascot uniform, I must be wrong. I just spent all my caps yesterday but I would pay 4K for it if you held it for me
---
As I said to other commenter. In general. Regardless of the battle or levels present or gear. 
---
I‚Äôd rather feel good knowing that 8+ people are capable of doing the event.
---
I'd think your purchases would be tied to your Bethseda.net account? Maybe you need to relink your new PSN ID to that.
---
Yea I agree, same area should be free for minor adjustments
---
i need to know it, becaue I want to trade a IE gun in but this information is the base of my decision.
---
Still wouldn't activate pvp unless you have pacifist turned off.
---
I will hold it for awhile, since i won't be on for about 4 hours
---
Thanks for tips...I have some follow up questions if you got a chance:
---
&gt; Most of it tries to make you feel rushed but don't let it.
---
But the robots continue to re-spawn after a certain amount of time, so wouldn't you want to go as fast as possible to fight less robots?
---
&gt; Take advantage of workbenches where you can.
---
How so, specifically?  
---
Thanks again!
---

3) during wasted on nukashine I was at the part where I gather the resources for the nukashine. But the was an server shut down for Maintenance so I logged off then when I got back in after the maintenance. The quest wasted on nukashine was gone but I still have the nukashine label on me with the quest maker on it. I tried to reactivate the quest but with no luck.
---
Is there a red railroad bridge in the background? (of the power armor pic)
---
Just east of the train station near top of the world is a beautiful lake. It even has cows last I checked. A small hop to WS from there.
---
Was a defend the workshop event going on? I've had it where I enter an event while wanted and it  would not let me fight back, I assumed this is due to the fact that during events you are not able to start PVP.
---
Also, your math is super off. It‚Äôs closer to 150
---
I am going on vacation soon and unfortunately won‚Äôt be able to play a lot, if you find another offer go ahead and take it, but if you don‚Äôt I can buy it when I get back.
---
Well, you can always just use a repair kit kekekekekeke.
---
Dude I was in a group that killed her with 6 seconds left on the clock and the stupid event failed anyway. I feel your pain.
---
I'd question the garden gnomes first.
---
Good luck. Hardly anyone has an IE gun, and hardly anyone tests. I'm not even sure if Explosive is pellet-multiplied yet, and there are far more explosive shotguns around.
---
This is a good idea that is good
---
"Did bad man touch you Chally?"
---
Bethesda, please give me a statue of Todd Howard for my CAMP!
---
the rowing bears have been one of my favorite pictures since the Beta, love finding those little guys in the world :)
---
Watoga has been 100% nerfed.  You say you got this info from data mining, but you should double check now because I server hopped over 20 times killing everything without seeing a single legendary before coming on here and seeing other people were having the exact same issue.  
---
I can't say for certain on other areas, West Tek seemed normal to me over the weekend, but the Bots on Parade event used to be 3* legendaries a good portion of the time for me and as I always, always do it because of that.  I have seen one legendary, 0 3* and 99% just crowned mutants the last week.
---
I'm pretty sure they're not really dying because they're already dead. That's just how the game places their bodies in the world when you enter the area. It only really becomes obvious when the game is lagging, which it's doing a lot more now because of the Sheepsquatch event. It's the same thing as when you have destroyed objects in your camp (like a generator) you'll hear them smash and blow up every single time you fast travel there.
---
Lol this is awesome
---
&gt;  The fact of the matter is that you are just getting bad rng.
---
I've personally farmed almost 1000 legendary items from Watoga. Every day for months, I would farm there for legendaries.
---
Since the last patch, 0. I went from multiple per day, to 0, in over a dozen runs. 
---
That's not "bad rng" that's a change to the legendary spawning of robots in Watoga.
---
I can't / won't speak to any other areas or enemy types beyond saying I still get plenty of legendary enemies at a few other locations, but I can say with absolute certainty they changed the robots in Watoga either directly or as a side effect of a different change.
---
Nice. Will have to go back and explore more I'm probably not hitting everything in there
---
Platform? I run a lot of black powder so I seem to get them all the time just gave away a junkies and a troubleshooter (it was great for Watoga) and I carry around 2x two-shot and and instigating black powder rifle. I think I got a couple more in the ol stash if ps4
---
Have you seen the dynamite catapult yet?  I'm Level 168 and just discovered that for the first time a few days ago.
---
Or at least have it make a handful of them.  Real nice perk, it just doesn't last long enough for that cost.
---
Will have to look again when I get home I know the pistol does thought the SMG also had one
---
Can't beat them - join them
---
Pretty sure it was a change they made to fix the problem that people could jam the doors of the munitions factory with furniture and barricades to prevent other people from claiming it.
---
I don't think this is tied to just name changing. I Don't have the "Looking to the Future" pose but I show it owned in the store.
---
and i can say with absolute certainty that they didnt. I'm a dataminer. The scripts are the same they were before the patch. the values for legendary percentages are also the same as they were pre patch
---
Greetings from Munich, Bavaria! :)
---
I'm just tired....
---
I've gotten a handful from Treasure Maps
---
Thank you my Friend and the same to you!
---
I lost 2 turrets bc I forgot to store them lol
---
Not sure if intentional, but yeah, setting up traps around the workshop capture point seems pointless with this.
---
Same here.
---
I just assumed they reduced them to that rate so people aren't as inclined to farm them. 
---
Except 60% longer lasting cores.
---
This was changed a few patches ago, i guess to make you go take over a power plant.
---
Having 10 rad resist compared to 0 is greater difference than 50 compared to 10. Same with all other damage sources.
---
I haven't been to where I sued to camp since this last patch, but the watchtower west of Watoga in the mountains has the remnants of a camp next to the cliffs,and three times in the dufflebag I found a Gatling laser.
---
Tried building across the street, was too slanted, couldn't put my house down &gt;&lt;
---
Can you not just destroy the objects barricading the doorway?
---
Give this a go:
---
1) Put on PA
---
2) Hit "drink" 
---
3) Rapidly spam collect
---
If memory serves PA helmet has built in filter, at least I haven't gotten a disease wearing it.
---
Just recently?
---
One of the first things i did was double check. a lot of people since the patch have been having bad rng in general.
---
any useful resources near WS like lead, steel, acid and junk that is safe
---
What's your secret to reigning over those pylons?
---
Ya like a couple days ago, they werent attached to my house tho
---
No i havent but i dont wanna change it back lol i like my new name. Or can i bounce back to my new name after changing back to my old name ?
---
Power up the Nuka Cola factory!
---
Not now. Back on tomorrow.
---
Inevitable from having Bethesda post here.
---
There are items where if Bethesda would at least say SOMETHING then those thread types would go away:  perk card loadouts come to mind.  Say no, they don‚Äôt fit our vision of the game, or say yes, we‚Äôre working on them, and those threads go away.
---
Plenty of little stuff would also go away with Bethesda‚Äôs comments on why things are that way, such as why are radstorms so rare.  
---
I like idea posts as much as the next person, I‚Äôve posted a few of my own, but I more enjoy the stories or statistical analyses posts.  
---
It seems like some want this sub to be 5 megathreads and a few FAQs and no actual discussion.
---
Just wait til more Purveyor info is released.  It will likely blow up the sub again as Bethesda has given next to zero info on how the system works, what it will and won‚Äôt let you do.  The time to deal with your customers on this is months ahead, with an explanation of your vision of the feature.  The repair kits however show how bad Bethesda is at communication, or at least internal differences within the groups running the show/making it happen.
---
Hey man, if you're struggling, just give life time. It eventually gets better.
---
Well it‚Äôs hard to tell because I don‚Äôt have any numbers. But I use an IE Lever Action and it does a lot of damage when the target is at full health. So I‚Äôd say yes, it also doubles the explosive damage.
---
I want to believe that it is in the game and just really rare to find, like a cryptid should be. Or maybe there's some secret to finding it. But no one has seen it so doesn't seem likely
---
Only repairkit disasters get megathreads.
---
I Dont even think i have a bethesda account.
---
Yes, I'm on xbox, my gamertag is ewellupp, hit me up
---
Um nope..
---
It's more fun to bring those posts down to earth by reminding them this is the F team working on it, not the A team and that No, they can't please them.
---
So if you convert the both to standard receivers the Fixer still has the 20% boost? Very interesting!
---
Xbox one
---
Yes. I‚Äôve been saying this from the start. This needs to be fixed, it‚Äôs really annoying
---
You want a different fallout fun buck besides atoms? :(
---
did you open console and type /killall
---
hahaha the memories
---
Someone down below said legendaries are just not being marked as legendaries now...I'm not sure if this is the explanation but would make sense. I can try and test later after I eat with a large sample of trials.
---
Plasma gattling is a viable tool against sneakers.
---
Plasma rifle is now a good rifle. By far not the PvP meta, but PvP-viable, even against the hardest opponents.
---
I think if plasma rifle received a slight boost it'd be in 'just perfect' damage output zone.
---
Tom Clancy‚Äôs Rainbear 6
---
Thanks, i have quite a few of those.
---
I just kinda figured it was cuz my buddy has access to all of his stuff still but he didnt change his name. And i dont have my stuff and i changed my name
---
Have we tho?
---
Xbox One unfortunately
---
If memory serves EDF 5 dosent.
---
I'm aware what the term PvP means. It's still a dumb idea.  You want to play bloodied? Sometimes it might cost you some junk.
---
I'm in full agreement. So far there's nothing I've seen that actually supports that. Maybe there's some things that can be interpreted as suggesting that if you look at them from a certain point of view, but I'm not playing Chicken Little here. Ever checked out /r/AmItheAsshole ? They have "judgement" categories.  
---
**YTA** = You're the Asshole; 
---
**NTA** = Not the A-hole; 
---
**ESH** = Everyone Sucks here;
---
**NAH** = No A-holes here; 
---
**INFO** = Not Enough Info 
---
Well, this is a case of INFO.
---
Like running silos in troubleshooters gear. :)
---
Better, like if you multiply Q x 10 where Q was 0.1/10 when it came out, now you're at 1/10.
---
^^better option^^
---
And what am I suppose to be looking at in the wiki? You can be underwater for minutes on end while in power armor. You can breath underwater without issue.
---
The amount of electrocuted people I've found is a bit disturbing...
---
I am planning my items based on this (solely my guess as to how it will function):
---
* Turning in an item gives you 1 token per star of that item.
---
* Turning in a token lets you reroll an 1 effect of your choice on an item. The reroll is random and probably some effects are more likely than others.
---
* You can not turn a 1 star item into a 2 or 3 star item. You can only reroll effects, not add effects.
---
Even some types/cases of cancer have cure...
---
It would make you wanted because you were not in PVP yet.  So people would force others to be wanted if they tried to take over a workshop.
---
I think that‚Äôs how the currency is going to work whether we like it or not, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be a cash for legendary points though as that‚Äôs a doorway to P2W which Bethesda will end up suffering for in the long run
---
No, it was on the shore on the western side of the map, near Deathclaw Island. Also learned, it's called Deathclaw Island for a reason. RIP.
---
I dont see how survival has anything to do with this. 
---
When you have a workshop, you are willing to PvP no matter what mode you are in. It doesnt matter if you have it for resources or just a simple tele. Your name literally plastered on the map so by all means someone can go there just to pvp. Whether you like it or not thats just how workshops are. 
---
As for the guy screaming about pylons, there is usually, a number of people that dont know what to do in that fight. Whether youre just a casual player or hardcore, you will always meet people that yell to do mechanics. Thats just how MMOs are.
---
There‚Äôs a pretty comon (because duped like hell) bugged Marine Sentinel Assassssin Right Leg as well. The description says +25 as well but it simply doesn‚Äôt apply.
---
I once set up a house on the edge of the space station crater for both the view and solitude (how often do YOU ever go up there???).  
---
Glass walls would have been amazing
---
Was changed back in patch 7 to stop people from making the Bench inaccessible and the workshop unable to be contested.
---
Bro. This is hilarious. Ty
---
I just remembered that I have a low level character that hasn't started this quest. I just read a party poster and it did NOT kick off the quest line.
---
Seems like a better solution would be to make it so that you engage in workshop pvp if you start destroying objects in the workshop
---
Yea but I found this piece off an event.
---
I use to notice the same thing, I use melee now so I couldn‚Äôt tell you.
---
Poor bear ;(
---
So that says it's probably not controlled on our side.
---
In the time since my comment, I went and ran Watoga, again. I killed 29 Protectrons roughly 1/3 of them fresh spawns from their tubes. The rest of them already there.
---
These would be somewhere in the mid 300's of protectrons I've killed since the patch. And surprise, not one legendary drop.
---
Those percentages you're reading apparently don't mean shit when it comes to the spawn rate for legendaries in Watoga.
---
I went from consistently getting multiple legendary enemies there, to 0 since the patch.
---
This happens to me sometimes as well...not just when zoning in. Sometimes, as I am traveling along, I will hear the sound of a nearby enemy, then all of sudden their death noise and shortly after I find their corpse.
---
Yes, should be in like 12 hours that's there is a change over
---
Ok, I think I figured this bug from data mining. There are actually two armor legendary effects with the description "+25 radiation resistance". One of them really is +25 RR, while the other is supposed to provide disease resistance.
---
I wonder how hard it would be to add a separate option for item trade, or a separate tab within the trade menu just for item trading
---
The way it works is that enemies can go into a sort of super rage mode and they become a legendary. What seems to be happening is that they BROKE the ui so that when they update they arent being shown as legendary
---
I used to set my camp up near there, even though it's a useless area, just so I could fire the corpses once a day
---
I think they are.supposes to show cloaked as well, at least one of the early reddit posts mentioned it.
---
But there is nothing wrong with a player entering a Workshop and being able to contest it.
---
Dang. Ok. Lol
---
Im more south of the course I believe. If you look at the map I'm smack between the snake and the highway marker below the whitesprings icon but I'm on green grass. Someone made the camp for me so I hope to avoid moving it unless I have to
---
Was there an actual patch note?
---
I really disagree. Seeing a legendary enemy in the wild is extremely fun because I know the fight wont be easy and I have to plan a little bit for how I will kill it and take its loot. Without the tag, I'll just rush in and have less fun.
---
It shouldn't be too hard to do something like that. They do have glass building assets in FO4. I'd really like glass roofs to make a skylight for my camp
---
I would like to see some moon phases. If they are in the game I haven't seen them personally.
---
Interesting. I wonder if it‚Äôs that then. I have a couple that should have radiation resistance but neither one shows radiation resistance.
---
Ah, then you're good!
---
Exactly. Oh there are turrets, lemme find a wall to hide behind...
---
I didn't know about that one. I've seen cats once and radrats a couple times, but no dogs yet.
---
for pa!
---
Tomorrow most likely
---
Except this method allows you to completely bypass traps and defenses
---
Protip: On a water pump, press "Drink". Now start tapping "Collect" while the animation is playing and the Collect button is greyed out. You'll collect the water as fast as you can press the button (while the pump animation is playing)!

This is not a trading sub and its discouraged to flood it with trade offers. Go to respective subreddit.

"It is a solid game"... Now you took it too far. It isn't a solid game for me. At all. I ner asked Beth for anything here. I get that there are a lot of shit posting asking for absurd stuff, but saying it's a solid game is too much for me. It has potential, it's a great idea of a game with a lame execution. It's getting better and better but sometimes I fell like I'm saying, Bethesda, please, let me play this game. I don't know if just hates Razen or lots of cores, but oh boy, a sometimes it just freeze or crash...
---
And yeah, some times I can play for 5 hours straight. Lottery, I guess.
---
But what I hate the most is getting disconnected from the m a server after 30 min of owning a workshop and build lots of turrets and what not. That makes me rage quit all the time. And yeah, it happens to me. Like a lot!
---
I have 2 3* shotguns, one is a TSE and the other is an executioner.  I seem to kill myself quite often with the TSE and mainly use the executioner.  I got both from a nuked Whitesprings.
---
F, all of the Fs
---
I can confirm this doesn't work. Definitely scrapped my excavator PA frame by accident yesterday. Luckily I had a spare, but I was a sad wastelander
---
Yeah that sounds good. I‚Äôm fine with non-legendary. If it‚Äôs not too hard can you tell me what it takes to make so I can get things together?
---
Meat hook benefits from 1H and unarmed
---
The robots do respawn and yes preferably you would want to move on as soon as you can but there are areas like corridors where you can drink , eat, heal and prepare for the next bit.
---
By work bench I'm referring to weapons. You don't want your trusted weapon to break in the midst of battle.
---
Why should we believe this?
---
What? I don‚Äôt think anyone is being an asshole. This is just a discussion. Don‚Äôt tell me you were the downvote?
---
Bethesda nerfed the repair/weapon condition perks before announcing atom shop repair kits, and pay-to-win is a fairly common negative trait of online multiplayer games.
---
&gt; succinct
---
\*googles\*
---
yeah maybe. Whatever happened to show man ship?
---
Tried it with a buddy, trick seems to be not knowing you can actually start the blasted event as its on an invisible cooldown.  :(
---
Awesome! The T51b is a hot seller. She looks great and wont break the bank in maintenance cost. We offer a fully customizable line of T51. What options were you interested?
---
DUDE what the hell?! Look at his profile hes uploading Videos where hes hackin!?!
---
All I got was bufftat and calmex. This mission sucks
---
Sorry didn't mean to imply you did, I meant that as a generalized you.
---
But that's black market selling not pay to win. Pay to win means you have purchase exclusive pay only items(atom shop in this case) Are repair kits pay to win in of itself? No, not by a long shot but it does point in the direction if we don't protest what Bethesda is doing.
---
I'd say that's fine. I with a few minutes, look at the map and see if anyone is around/coming back. After 5 minutes it's free.
---
Gunna check it out.
---
More like 19 hours, but yes, should be some new stuff.
---
Please
---
That's some old school database design right here ü§£
---
No downvote from me, and I'm not calling anyone an asshole. I'm saying this situation is an INFO- not enough information to make a judgement. So I'm not worrying about PTW until I actually see real evidence of them doing it.
---
Agreed, you should at least be getting some form of plans for it.
---
I've never looked so I thought I'd ask :/ 
---
I just saw a drawing of Mothman in the taxidermy place with two moon phases and I have found a cultist note saying meet at the ritual site at midnight so I wondered if there wasa connection.
---
Me too...just this Friday...400 hours...
---
Soldiers rushing on Omaha beach....WWII colorized
---
How? What're **your** metrics?
---
Yeah why wouldn't you or your 4 friends take clips of it as proof otherwise it's witch-hunting right?
---
400 x .25 x 8 = 800 soo that accounts for less than 3% of the 30,000 you claimed. Did you mean 3 thousand?
---
Unless there's obviously a ton of unusual /expensive loot, I just leave that alone. I'd rather miss out on loot than steal someone's whole day of farming
---
Yes.
---
Yeah that's often true but I don't think there's a need for some of these actions to even have a dedicated button (since there could/should be an actual menu to select actions from) and the menus themselves should have consistent button functions.
---
I'm not a UI designer by any means but I think the entire system needs reimagined to accommodate the new functionality they've added.
---
I think rather than having social buttons (join party, trade) bound to separate controller buttons it'd be way more useful to have a single button that brought up a social menu which would give us the option to initiate trades, invite to group, emotes, etc. 
---
The favorites button should not be bound to any button related to navigating container inventories.
---
Navigating tabs in the pip-boy / should use the same buttons consistently. (L1/R1 &amp; L2/R2 functions shouldn't be reversed between menus)
---
CAMP issues could be resolved IMO by using a build mode that utilized a flying camera and didn't rely on using the POV / controls of the player.
---
Instead of having 3 separate "modes" for crafting benches, there could be 3 separate top level menu items with key functions selected as sub-menu items with X or A or whatever button is chosen (consistently across all UI elements).
---
I have nothing to base this from other than my own suspicions but I feel like they tried to change as little from FO4 as they could get away with and I feel like they tried way too hard to bind actions to dedicated buttons.
---
It's just kind of frustrating cause this game can be fun but the little stuff like this wears me down.
---
Look at his profile.....
---
Is DCG the same way?
---
u/risingdusk do u know this question?
---
They probably got tired of researching after 17.
---
Pipe weapons
---
What does his gamer score matter?
---
Previously though people just made their workshops uncontestable.
---
Well that's good info.  You should put this in your top level post of the thread so people with the same experience as me don't have the same reaction to your statements.  I'll still test run a fuck ton of runs through just cuz I don't have much else to do in game atm and can put some numbers behind it.
---
Some seem to have that bug. If the extra rad res doesn‚Äôt show up under the kinetic and energy resistance on the left side of the picture, it won‚Äôt apply. My Marine leg had 9 rad res showing there, although it was a +25 rad res piece. If the extra 25 show up on the left, it will apply.
---
We tested it and it seems to be working now.  
---
*note: we were all in passive, and no one was hostile.  I think they can still be damaged if you're hostile with someone.  Anyone else test it?
---
Cheers! And I'm stocking up on dirty pillows in fo76 so I can make my own padded room later üòõüëç

I found a Breaking Bad reference last week. Two bears wearing gas masks on a chem station.

why are you so skeptical?

I sure hope so. Generally there is a shop update on Tuesday‚Äôs. Oh give me some black Power Armor paints. That‚Äôd be swell.
---
Oh shoot I may have phrased my statement wrong. I was referring to West Virginia but yes Ohio does have some great areas and I live alilttke over an hour from hocking hills and it really is beautiful.
---
How did you start that quest?
---
They sent out a notice saying it was pushed back till May.
---
That's where it is on Uranium fever too.
---
Lots of Stimpaks and sneaking to avoid enemies
---
I haven't, that's the problem. I can't find the "CH Monthy" newspaper in any of the listed locations, so I figured maybe finding the shack would force-start the quest
---
No. They serve a purpose and they get results. Why would anyone dislike that?
---
I just went and looked at his first clip. From what I see, they are running a bloodied build, high rads and low health and they DID take damage, it just healed really fast.
---
400 x .25 x 8 = 800 soo that accounts for less than 3% of the 30,000 you claimed. Did you mean 3 thousand? 1 toon can't even hold 30k.
---
This is true, it's a slippery slope. I honestly dont see the point in these repair kits other than for the hardcore players who dont have time to farm loot (survival). But for me I dont think I'll ever have much use for them. Running gunsmith and weapon artisan maxed out I'm almost never without mats to repair weapons. I suppose these kits may free up some perk points.?.?.?

Bethesda‚Äôs way of telling us we‚Äôve had too much to drink already.
---
what perks?
---
you really dont understand how rng calculations work. they arent fully random due to having to be comprised of a calculation. anything that is wrong with the hardware and the software doing the calculation can cause it to become even more predictable until you end up with a very low amount of randomness. this is most likely what is causing this. we dont know how they do their rng calculations and if it is seeded like some think then the rng of this recent batch of servers is bad. remember not everyone has been having the same issue that you are with legendaries not appearing. ive seen a few when ive gone over there to check the vendors
---
I did. First clip I watched looked legit
---
I like how you completely dodged the question.
---
Do you think im dumb? This guy is lvl 70
---
It's a bear hanging another bear.
---
I thought dcg did too and that's why is so broken
---
Doesn‚Äôt everything in rust reset every two weeks or something? That‚Äôs a totally different dynamic for learning plans. And are you saying you wish Fallout was more like rust? Just play rust
---
We don't need new weapons yet, Bethesda needs to continue the balance for current weapons still
---
Yes or a cry baby griever cause you and 4 friends couldn't kill them. Lol
---
I haven't used one myself, but last night I was running around in Watoga where I came across a fellow using a Gatling plasma and he appeared to be doing pretty well for himself
---
It's an absolutely awful idea for the PCs user interface to be constrained to the console versions innadocuicies due to those using a gamepad!!!
---
You still have to store stuff that is not on a foundation, if it is on a foundation you fine. Anything else is at risk as the old bug is back where it gets deleted, lost all my crops, purifiers etc.
---
Actually..anyone can go to WS at any level..all of my alts were there almost instantly..with a hunting rifle..chilling..u just have to be wary of ur surroundings and u wil do just fine
---
Oh I only thought there was like i 8 or so. My mistake.
---
I have found some that are 50% in a few PAs
---
You could get a middleman their names should be listed in here somewhere.
---
I only just got in on my first queen kill earlier today. I get sidetracked from the missions too easily so I'm nowhere near launching a nuke myself yet.
---
My reload doesn't seem like it's been quicker in quite a while.  I've had to go in a few times to double check that I've actually still got it.
---
have a silver medal my Friend,
---
am totally with you on this post cant stand these naggers hahaha :).
---
Both set your items to 5k caps
---
It‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôll make gear trades for good shit, lol
---
It should be, it should allow you to swim underwater the same way imo. I am also pro mermaid armor.
---
I wish this was posted a couple days ago. I dropped a bunch of cells at welch train station.
---
No he had bounty was afk which means he is not able to heal i attacked him he took no dmg and later he just killed me oh and these where not my friends just randoms lvl 100-200 who where too bad
---
I think each star you have on a legendary item will be worth a token. You will cash in an item and it will give you 1,2,3, tokens depending.
---
I would guess it will take a set amount of tokens to change an effect on a separate item. Each effect will cost different amounts of tokens.  Just a guess.
---
They shouldn't have items that cost 20,000 caps then
---
Bruh I just hit 500 and I think I play too much
---
It happened twice last week on the same night, before that it happened only once since beta.
---
I don‚Äôt think it is but I hope I‚Äôm not telling bs here
---
I am 100% supportive of anything aquatic or tiki themed getting added to the game.
---
Most is in the secret passageway. But theres nodes on the ceiling and tucked behind objects in many corners too.
---
Just watched the clips there is no hacking involved just using bloodied
---
To be honest no, but I'll do it right now and report.
---
I see, because as far as anybody knows the 2 other quests have either been left out or are bugged. Thought for a sec uou'd managed to find one.
---
It's probably a good idea to store the stuff that takes expensive mats to build. The rest of the stuff probably isn't a big deal.
---
Every. Single. Time.
---
How do you know he was afk? He could have been going through his menu or looking on the map. Lol
---
I thought so, and because I didn't find such analysis I asked here. Will do some (not so extensive) testing and report my findings.
---
Oh wtf and in the menu he can heal?!
---
I‚Äôve had several events fail with 10 seconds left suddenly. I think there‚Äôs a timer off somewhere, it‚Äôs doing this repeatedly.
---
Yep, I have a +%40 attack speed Cultist Dagger, and when I am in low level areas, it's basically killing shit as soon as it is in reach. It's fun watching a line of ghouls run at you, doing their weird tumbling leap attack, and just tumbling past you dead.
---
Utility melee: Well worth it, no matter the build.
---
 Yeah, it happened constantly in beta and launch. It became noticeably less frequent with time, but this patch its been happening en-masse again.
---
Just this morning it happened 3 times to me in a 2 hour session:
---
1. I went to check the terminal at the Ambush Site to see if the event was available. I had a vats lock on a wendigo and was running towards it when it and the 3 ghouls in the immediate area just dropped dead.
---
2. Going through the Wendigo Cave to get the daily challenge and clear the misc clown costume quest... again. Entered a larger cavern with lots of mirelurks only to have them all instantly keel over. 
---
3. A radstag herd had spawned near my camp. I killed the glowing one, then the two does just died where they stood.
---
It's mostly an annoying bug, because you don't get loot when it happens. It's really discouraging when it happens and you find a legendary corpse in the area though :(
---
That's awesome!
---
I was bummed out that the recent limited - time events, like Faschnact Day, didn't scale. It meant I didn't have to put any effort into competing the quest, just basically wait for it to run its course. Not only that, but it meant the legendary drop at the end was underleveled as well.
---
&gt; Workshops: You can now contest a Workshop that‚Äôs owned by another player from anywhere inside the Workshop‚Äôs build area, which should make it easier to attempt to contest a Workshop, even if it‚Äôs been barricaded by the owner.
---

---
Bro. I‚Äôm with you. I understand there are some issues but jeez.
---
Seems like it just does double of whatever the damage would be on a regular shot.  So if you have a combat rifle that does 125 damage it should do 250 on the first shot.  
---
It starts getting confusing when you and in sneak shots and stuff.
---
Instigating is good on high damage weapons where you can potentially one shot things. On rapid fire Furious is probably better.
---
Can't you use a stim from your pipboy menu? Lol
---
I meant more along the lines of it's not a very cute outfit. I'm no into neons.
---
He seems like a Legit player that has a Ridiculously good build. You just need to understand the build to see its legit
---
I only notice this with heavy weapons while in power armor
---
Well, an update is coming out tomorrow containing an endgame dungeon and new camera system. So, I would wait till tomorrow.
---
Well it firstly looks weird
---
no the only four I could do were Tracking Terror, Death &amp; Taxidermy, Best of Intentions, and Picnic Panic!! It seems like a ton of Wild Appalachia quests just aren't there?? Or aren't accessible???
---
I've bee looking for a I/E lever action. Probably my dream gun right now.
---
lol i have a character that has 400 super stims and 500 regualr stims on him he has the chem weight reduction perk so it's not a huge problem but i can never take that character to survival lol
---
Or scrap for lead and gunpowder
---
Maybe play a game that isn‚Äôt riddled with issues people want fixed?
---
Pipe weapon, and rifle perks
---
Also auto stim as well maybe
---
Correct me if im wrong but he was level 70 is that even possible?
---
 hallelujah, 
---
it's Scorch Beasts, 
---
amen
---
I have the same but as a mule that has only chems that i got from survival. So that when player selling come online, il have a full pharmacy.
---
They actually fixed a lot of the stuff people were complaining about with their last past. I think people know they listen and are trying to get their message out there. Lol
---
Yes but you probably have a life :)
---
well that's hilarious, I play PC and am middle age middle class white and male, and play with 2 other of the same. I see now you assumed I was going to attack some injustice, when I was going to offer for you to play with us, which obviously would be awkward now. And since Im negative karma on my offer, enjoy mine back
---
That's what I was thinking or an armor with a chance of healing but that wouldnt be super likely
---
Maybe you should stop scrolling at the fourteenth post
---
Unlikely
---
You aren't using any RAD-X are you? That will suppress the effect for a time.
---
There's a legendary effect on armor that'll use a stimpak automatically every 60 seconds.
---
My gamer score is 83k+ does that make me a hacker
---
Sorry to refer to Charleston as a "town". I stand corrected. In the shthole where i live, our biggest city would be equivalent to your smallest town.
---
Ya after level 50 you can redistribute your points or select new cards. He isn't cheating he's just super good at making a very powerful build. Just use a Gamma gun to counter anyone with insane resistance.
---
Just don't go into Survival. ^it's ^a ^mess
---
Dude why are you so toxic? This is so dumb
---
I hope thats right
---
That‚Äôd be pretty great, but the whole operation tourniquet thing that happened kinda makes me doubt that there are any sort of unmarked quest or secrets :/
---
Yes of course that is exactly what ive sad
---
Once you get to about level 70 everyone is on the same playing field imo. 
---
As far as workshops go they are pvp enabled. Were you really shocked someone contested you?
---
I'm toxic because you're making false claims about someone trying to get them banned and you're clearly in the wrong?
---
If you got 308 and on PS4 I‚Äôll take it!
---
We've always wondered what people thought when we showed up at low level houses and dumped our excess plans and materials, sometimes weapons and ammo too.
---
Ok lets say hes not a hacker?
---
with max fireproof and dense  chest peice you can be explosion immune
---
Damn. Don‚Äôt need electric resistance lol. Both pieces are marine pieces. I was going to add lead lined to see if it would unbug it but apparently I don‚Äôt have the mod for limbs. Which is odd being 320 something.
---
You can buy the plans at the Grafton Train station. I just saw them there today.
---
[](/kcelestiahappy)Harpers Ferry and the new Free States vendor in the Whitesprings have them for sale relatively often.
---
You just called them bad and you failed and died.
---
As far as I know, it's only affecting this one item. Which item(s) are you missing from the Atom Store?
---
If on xbox I'll buy fusion cores
---
I'm sure tomorrow will be 'Fight an imposter sheepsquatch while inarmed, naked and on chems' to make up for it.
---
Block them
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking thanks
---
Its a bug and I hate it
---
I hope they fix it tomorrow
---
Block them on their xbox profile.
---
What the hell if the whole server is on him and cant kill him that looks weird
---
A few points of clarification
---
* I'm not talking about all legendaries. I've been able to get plenty of legendary drops from non-robot enemies in other farming locations. - Legendaries being on those vendors has literally nothing to do with it. That's also the closest vendor to SBQ fight. As well as other random mobs that can spawn as legendary in that area of the map.
---
* My argument is that the rate of **Legendary Proctectron's in Watoga**is now different (less) than it was.
---
* I've still been getting legendaries at a typical rate from West-Tek, during events, at Harper's Ferry, etc. (Typically Non-robot mobs)
---
* You saying "anything that is wrong with the hardware and the software doing the calculation can cause it to become even more predictable until you end up with a very low amount of randomness. this is most likely what is causing this." isn't disproving my point.  I'm saying *the rate has changed* as can be demonstrated by comparing drop rates before and after the patch.
---
* I don't care *why* Watoga protectrons are not spawning as legendary, I'm just saying they aren't.
---
Reading through these points I'm saying that for whatever reason Watoga is not spawning legendary protectrons at the same rate it used to. You say it's not RNG but rather something else like the RNG seed that's used or something. I'm not arguing that, I'm just saying they aren't spawning like they used to.
---
Don't forget about beer hat
---
I tell you how it is. I've found a BE .44 on a dead ghoul. Traded it for a BE 10 MM because someone wanted a powerful .44 for his Atom golden gun paintjob.
---
I love 10 MM guns, so it was a perfect deal, but what I like about 10 MM Pistols is the ability to  one shot smaller enemies with free amo. They are very precise and I played them in other fallouts too. :)
---
My desire to improve its one shot killability lead to the wish for a IE 10 MM. Which I could trade in now for the BE 10 MM. But unlike the Bloodies perk, the Instigating perk isnt shown in the numbers on the gun.
---
So I fear the following effect, I hit with a 37 power bullet, after the hit the game checks for full hp, then I get 74 power but since the gun has been fired with 37 I get a standard explosion. If this would be the case, I want to keep my BE.
---
And the bad was ironic btw
---
Every indication I've seen, is that you turn legendaries in for points, which you then can use to increase the odds of getting good perk sets on your reroll.
---
With the way RNG is now, I wouldn't be at all surprised if there was a chance to reroll your 3* god weapon into a 1* noobstick.
---
So, it dosn't seem to work for the little mining nodes. What does it sound like? I cranked my volume and didn't hear anything more than the usual "Stomp SQUEEK stomp SQUEEK"
---
No problem :)
---
The whole server wasn't on him. Only a couple people at a time, very easy to kill pve characters with a PvP build.
---
If you are going for a fire build and chef I recommend getting a rolling pin and gladiator perks. It‚Äôs not always good to have a random assortment of weapons without a certain build you are going for
---
Before update buddy. 
---
Also I used another character to offload my caps.
---
Nope, not at all - what I'm tired of is not getting more than a "canned response" from Bethesda.
---
I'd like them to answer like a real person, and not like a PR Robot...
---
[Here's](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f319d2d&amp;d=cu2ic4ip2ih2id0s10l22l71ls2lt2pe2sq2s32sr2a01lu1s01s22s80cm2c12ek0&amp;w=el0e00cr0at1lm2st1pa0p80p90c52if2ie2iq2in1i71im1cf2ck0c31sb2sa2sv2) a heavy weapons/power armor build that requires level 104 (assuming you get unlucky with perk packs).
---
Yes, it includes a lot of "utility" cards that are not equipped in the fighting loadout, but those cards are actually pretty darn good to have.  Bonuses when you repair armor and weapons to 200%, swap out cards depending on what your team has, etc.
---
If you take out all the utility cards, it still requires level 70.
---
I'm on a lead node and it doesn't need acid to be used for ammo
---
You where there?
---
Same here, game crashes every time I try to go to the mezzanine level of the Top of the World to complete a quest
---
Nodes don't, but it's faster to mine ore (which does), than extract it.
---
No, but I'm pretty sure people would definitely not take the time out of their day to kill some random dude. Especially with sheepsquatch and sbq.
---
It was way too difficult before and now it's too easy. Not quite sure what the answer is to fix it.
---
Oof im deleting this probably hes not a hacker because other people teached me....
---
Lots of old bugs surfaces when they fixed the new ones in this patch, we're creeping forward but at a snail's pace.
---
There have been alot of fixes to bugs and improvements to server stability. You should give fallout another shot.
---
I tried. They‚Äôre still joining me
---
I actually want to try this now. It's not like armor makes much difference with that thing.
---
Most are 25%, but the last week I've found 50's.
---
I‚Äôve seen a lot of people that genuinely do not realize Liberty Prime is satire
---
Definitely do that, your karma is in the negatives rn
---
3 hours or server hop
---
Yup, did some testing recently! Explosive weapon damage is definitely scaled based on the actual damage of the bullet before armor is applied but after weapon modifiers are applied, so it factors things like Instigating/VATS Crits/Two Shot.
---
Interestingly, if you run the math this makes TSE extremely comparable to AAE in the case where every bullet hits, though obviously TS hurts the likelihood of every bullet hitting if you do anything other than aim 100% of the time.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 I can help you out
---
People who say the game sucks either haven't played it or are bitter they paid full price at launch.
---
Aw man! PC unfortunately! But seriously where do you get your plans?
---
I've seen the three skeleton launchers on a clifftop. Is that the one?
---
Block on Xbox, ingame and report.
---
That‚Äôs odd, multiple server hops? I‚Äôve already swapped a few times but no change in the message
---
WTS Ultracite Explosive vents. Currently have 87 xD.   
---
No but seriously it should cycle through all the plans and not be random since it takes so long to do.
---
I got a rad storm when I left the vault for the first time, I cake out directly into one, and I‚Äôve not seen one since
---
Seriously it‚Äôs making me go mad
---
It's the same shit everyone has been asking for since day 1 of the beta
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure I got it from that if not only other place I got it was the new sheepsquatch event. I don‚Äôt check my plans often but I only did those two
---
I think it would be great if they added in an alternative server where the level cap for regions is removed. It would be accessible for players once they reach level 50 and allow for events in the forest/toxic valley/ash heap to be useful and challenging.
---
Leave the game for like a minute or 2 then log in again also did you block for session or Block? If there is a way to block gamertags on xbox's menu I'd also do that.
---
is Back did not know it left.... hay now we get to look at the new splash *Scream* when we reboot the game every 45 minutes, how cool is that would not want to miss any news about upcoming game busting patches.
---
I'm still dropping 3* regularly at WS, if you're there for 2 hours and only getting 1* change servers. 3* still spawn all the time in WS
---
I'm so tempted to make a glass "guest house" with a bed, toilet and shower if they do. Put some cameras around...
---
&gt;make things interesting do what 4 did and make legendary mutations actually MEAN something and provide some sort of buff
---
Huh, I quite like that. Suggestions:
---
* **Unstable:** Immediately causes a small nuclear detonation upon death. Unstable robots detonate twice.   
---
* **Ruinous:** Enemy's attacks degrade your armor and weapons at an alarming rate.  
---
* **Telepathic:** Cannot be targeted by VATS. Looking at this enemy inverts your controls and temporarily reassigns key bindings outside of your Pip-Boy.  
---
* **Glitching:** Enemy teleports behind you every few seconds.  
---
* **Shielded:** Critical hits on this enemy cause it to gain brief invincibility and regenerate some of their health.  
---
* **Hungry:** Enemy is surrounded by an aura that quickly drains your hunger and thirst meters.  
---
* **Angry:** Enemy gains extra damage and damage resistance as their health gets lower.  
---
* **Lonely:** Enemy becomes invincible if there are more than one players near it.  
---
* **Tired:** Enemy emanates a stamina depleting aura.  
---
So a one star legendary enemy would gain one of these mutations, a three star enemy would get three of them, etc.
---
Nope it's pure rng.
---
I didn‚Äôt really realize how much this game nailed pretty much everything about West Virginia, both good and bad
---
Don't forget intoxicated
---
I do love playing I force myself to stop most the time
---
I've seen the blueprint in whitesprings
---
perfect storm, and the flamer are two decent but ammo-consuming fire weapons
---
I would keep what you have.  You are going to get better performance on the B/E. Each shot is going to do much better damage. The I/E is good for 1 shot heavy damage weapons for example:hunting rifle, lever, gauss, Super sledge, Baseball bats, missle launchers etc.
---
That's why I said Furious and explosive is probably what you should be looking for. Or just keep what you have. A 10mm isn't going to one shot much but low level mobs.
---
I remember my first
---
nope sorry nothing to see here....
---
Hopefully we get the war rider paint for t45
---
Keep going took me 5 till I found one
---
I've had a bounty placed for picking up junk in a claimed workshop too.
---
Jut to help you out.  You get it from events.  Specifically from census violence in my case.  If you need one made I can make one and most of the mods for it.  I‚Äôm on PC and I‚Äôll be one after 8pm EST :)
---
I‚Äôd say I enjoy it about as much as I enjoyed fallout 4. The quests are decent, the gameplay is enjoyable, and there is an endgame loot grind that keeps your attention once you finish all of the quests. I‚Äôd say this game is a 7.5 out of ten, as it is somewhat buggy still and can be frustrating with how hard it is to obtain good gear.
---
Welcome home and nuka quantum cola signs. And the glowing appalachia map. So i guess camp items??
---
 Im not on it at the moment to check and see if all my xtra emotes are there though. i just remembered about those.
---
But it seems as though noone else has these issues. So idk lol maybe its just me.
---
known issue they should probably fix it by tomorrow.
---
Old bug that seemed to go the patch before last but is now back. Happens to me mostly if I've entered or exited PA. To fix, open pip boy, chose another gun then choose the first again. That'll fix it. Interestingly, a self confessed duper told me this, so they are good for some things :)
---
I might just hit you up, my biggest issue is I keep accidentally scrapping mine because it isn‚Äôt legendary
---
call me crazy but i'm pretty sure i've seen that plan on vendors before, anyone can confirm?
---
Mods are down since the last update. You can thank bethesda for that. But yes you can paint legendary items.
---
Nuclear Winter (n): A period of abnormal cold and darkness predicted to follow a nuclear war, caused by a layer of smoke and dust in the atmosphere blocking the sun's rays.
---
So expect constant darkness and the need to wear some sort of air filtration system (gas mask, hazmat suit, power armor).
---
I‚Äôve been looking all over I haven‚Äôt seen any
---
I honestly can't  believe theres still dumbasses out there playing this steaming pile of shit let alone asking bethesda everything but "Bethesda, please stop fucking our virgin holes", you cucks.
---
Curious to see if the new diving suit that was teased in the images for the Burrows will be a cosmetic in the atom shop, or if it can be found in the dungeon and will have actual damage resistance
---
I would file a request for them back. I don't know how this could have happened but they usually quite nice when asking for atoms back. Worth a try.
---
Might take a few. If XB1, let me know when it starts and I'll join!
---
I do wish they had this however.
---
Where did you find all the super stims? Is there a farming location? Plans?
---
Wouldn't the low levels just server hop to high level servers and still leech off you?
---
What are the legendary effects of sole survivor?
---
Is the burrows releasing tomorrow?
---
plans.. i craft alot of them when i can the mats for superstims are rough lol
---
The chances of finding a legendary that you can use are so incredibly low it's a joke. It has to have 3 decent effects, has to be a weapon you use, oh and has to be lvl 50 ( and most of the time it wont  be ) . This is assuming that you even got a three star item to begin with since the amount of stars next to their name apparently means nothing.
---
90% of legendaries you get will be useless 1 stars, the other 10% will be drills (WHY are these still in the loot table, seriously how hard can it be to stop this from happening?). The 'legendary' system is infuriating in every way basically.
---
My suggestions:
---
- Its been said again and again but 3 star enemies should drop 3 star weapons and armor, 2 star should drop 2 star and so on. Honestly what is the point of killing a 3 star if you get a drill. I don't play Fallout to gamble Bethesda. If you want to take it a step further you could have  1 stars only spawn in the forest, 2 stars Ash heap/Toxic Valley, 3 stars Mire/Cranberry/Savage
---
- We need easier ways to trade gear with other players. Player vending will be nice but sounds like it will be limited. An auction system would be great, or a better trading interface (one that lets us trade items for other items rather than just caps).
---
- Get rid of the absolutely useless items. Sure there might be certain people who are interested in certain effects but noone wants a piece of wood armor, or a drill, or a lvl 5 machete that does extra damage to ticks or any crap weapon for that matter. I understand you can't just give out great weapons but they're not locked behind a challenge, they're locked behind ridiculous  RNG and that ain't right. You could probably remove hundreds of useless combinations from the loot pool and it would STILL be incredibly rare that you find a semi-decent piece of gear.
---
- I don't know how this legendary trader is going to work but please don't make it another grind, be generous with what you give our characters. I dont want to have to hand in hundreds of legendaries just to get one that I want. 
---
If you read all that, thank you and sorry.
---
Pure rng but it seems the higher level you get the more 3* rolling pins you find.
---
Yup! It is indeed
---
Last patch they added a confirmation step if you have an item favorited. IGN is the same as this if you do :)
---
Eh, just destroy your exterior walls until they‚Äôre skeletons. Might lack any sort of reflection but you‚Äôll definitely see inside.
---
maybe my memory is just shit but I remember back before the plan changes when I use to farm the Watoga vendor for t60 shocks I saw the plan pop up a few times but I fully admit I may be wrong.
---
Is the plan not a common drop from the event?
---
Thanks I now have something new to look for
---
I feel the same way. For a while when I'd go on FO76 boards I'd refer to all the haters as Marcy because it was easier then bothering with different names since all they said was pretty much the same any way and like her they were going to keep complaining about something.
---
There's far too many outlandish unreasonable ideas. I don't think many players can look at things from a development point of view because I see so many suggestions like "allow us to hang photomode photos in our camp" and people just don't understand the massive technical cost.
---
The value/time would be soo much greater if they instead worked on many QoL and bugfixes before moving onto that stuff
---
You can sell it for much better than 1 cap per 5 bullets if you use the trade subs :)
---
Another option we can include with this one is the good old drug Jet or its counterparts! It helps with aiming by making the character maintain a more stable aim to land easier/ accurate shots. This would definitely benefit for those bosses that make the entire earth shake (I.e. scorchbeast shriek). I‚Äôm not sure why Bethesda removed this drug from the game it‚Äôs like a novelty sticker.
---
Then they probably have a buddy finding you and rejoining your server, then they join them. Block the whole server list before you hop
---
Could also give you the plan for them, pretty sure I have it
---
I will guarantee that the atomic shop will be working after the update/quest.
---
Firstly chainsaws are far more valuable than 35 caps, secondly server hop at the watoga vendors until you can buy it for like 70 caps
---
To be fair, the term map marker is the one used in game for what was being described and having people leap to things like assuming you may be color blind (regardless of how well intentioned) it insisting you are wrong (as the op can't be expected to realize the misunderstanding any faster than those that thought she meant player indicators) can be seen as insulting too.  Not sure I feel the phrasing offer advice is the most helpful either, tbh.  Perhaps recommending that the op had explained the issue a bit more and offered some specifics to prevent miscommunication from derailing thing would have been a better option than saying they were just repeating nonsense and going after people (especially since they likely felt defensive given how things would have seemed from their perspective).  I'd also say that those insisting the op handled things poorly, they could do with considering how all the responses given might have seemed if they were on the other side (as many of those replies do seem very dismissive and frustrating in That context, since the op wouldn't immediately assume their comment wasn't being understood correctly).
---
Assassins, 10% damage while aiming and 50 damage resistance whilst aiming i believe
---
Nothin in the two hours I was circling it last night.
---
damn 130+ caps? i only ever have to pay 40 to move mine. strangely my mule has set up camp a small handful of times always 40 caps
---
So tired of people asking this question every Damned day. 
---
Do it or don‚Äôt. Judge for yourself rather than rely on the opinions of strangers
---
When does the update release time wise
---
a nice baseball bat's never failed me
---
Similar thing happend to me, I had on my investigators hat trying to find out about some mutated deer at this mans farm when suddenly a scorchbeast falls on my head, scared the jeepers out of me
---
Not going to lie, I'm a little disappointed that I haven't seen the actual home to compare this to...  did you post it and I missed it somewhere?
---
Just play for yourself and find out
---
How would they know if you are planning to do such things. You obviously aren‚Äôt going to launch a nuke and hop servers. You‚Äôd check and see and then change or commit to the game plan.
---
Ive been wondering if that is an intended thing or not.
---
Yeah, it's cheap and cheesy to be met with the splash upon loading. I really don't like it.
---
I've seen 2 in the past week.  I think they must have upped the chances of it occurring for the challenges.
---
Fair comment, also agree that anything cosmetic should play second fiddle until the stability issue is sorted.
---
Yeah good luck
---
This was very detailed, thanks a lot. Will try some things and maybe create another post with what I find.
---
Oh thank goodness yeah ill dm you please I‚Äôd like to get a new one if possible! BUT I‚Äôm still looking for plans !
---
While wearing sunglasses during a radstorm.
---
You're on social media right now, so are they ;)
---
They nerfed watoga after the ‚Äòserver maintenance‚Äô (for which they gave no note whatsoever) prior to the latest patch. I hopped more than a dozen server then asked about this in a post. Somehow they probably decided to postpone it to the recent patch, within hours the legendary bots showed up again and eventually eliminated in the recent patch.
---
Downvoting info in order to spread misinformation and hatred? Now why would our lovely group ever do something like that? Such actions are completely unprecedented in the fallout 76 community!
---
Not sure to be honest.  Doesn‚Äôt seem to mention a specific time here:
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1QMBfEfLfsdy3ho9eYMoQ0/inside-the-vault-the-burrows-and-camera-preview?sf101158891=1&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Yeah can I get a source on those numbers? I'm not saying you're wrong but there's so much misinformation spread around this community I want to stamp out the bs
---
Are you gonna be on today?  
---
We could talk over chat.
---
He‚Äôs a cute wee fella
---
I asked my parents to find some pics of the actual home (both for my own and viewers benefit) but they never got back to me with them :( . I'll be sure to share them if any surface. There's not enough Google maps data to zoom in to the place either :/
---
Like any good drunk, Biv is hard to direct and keep on task.  Just keep talking to him and eventually he'll give you his daily.  Sometime's he'll even give you two at once!
---
  
---
If Biv's reticence to give you a quest is a bug, I hope Bethesda never patches it.  I quite like his character as is, thank you very much.
---
I have gotten tired of tgem but i have had a fewnice talks over said subjects.
---
Also have to be lvl 500+
---
That would be amazing! My GT is Xwolfpackleader
---
Okay but The Fixer comes pre-modified, so it has a different reciever. Can you confirm it's not a difference in recievers?
---
Did the Deathclaw or the person post this
---
There is a workshop in the northern section of Toxic Valley, near Hemlock Holes golf course, that has 3 sources of acid. The defense is usually anglers or snallgasters, which is another source of adhesive and/or asbestos (maybe snallygasters give acid too, I don't recall). After the initial setup and defense waves, you can pull about 30 acid every 40 minutes or so. 
---
I usually hold this workshop for 2-3 hours every so often to stock up, and end up with a good 300+ acid by the time I logout of that session.
---
Yes, I'll be on in about 30
---
Yes, they are secretly lowering the legendary drop rate every update. They are also monitoring your gear usage to make sure you get more drops of weapons and armor you never use. It's all part of their secret plan so they can roll out the legendary vendor and start selling legendary tokens in the atom shop. Then they will steal epic games's spyware to monitor your computer and see how long it takes people to realize. Once the jig is up, they will sell your information to the lizard people in a quick exit scam. You're on to them though. Keep fighting the good fight
---
Fire axe or sledgehammer work well. Especially if you have some good mods.
---
Shoot I did the 'brew 10 drinks in CAMP' challenge last night and I didn't think to check if it unlocked the beer keg or not.  NOTE TO SELF...
---
Just try unequipping your weapon and try the pose again
---
Start appearing offline and block them the only way they‚Äôll be able to join you is when they are your friends.
---
Alright.  I'll just hop to your server
---
Pipe revolvers benefit from both pistol and rifle perks.
---
I've seen a line of cats but no pied piper. I pacified one but I couldn't interact with it.
---
Paying it forward is the best part of the game.
---
There's a cheesy easy vein in the rocks just to your right when you spawn in at Sugar Grove. And don't forget to wear your excavator armour!
---
delete your .ini files b4 you do the scanning and repairing "it will make new ones" if you have a custom .ini remove it from the fallout76 folder
---
I know but they‚Äôre still joining because they‚Äôre paying caps to random  people to join my game so they can join after them.
---
Has the price gone up or something. I‚Äôm willing to pay more but I thought this was the standard
---
mom can i keep him
---
Change your status to offline and make sure you're not friends with them or their friends.
---
Instigating is +100%
---
And have to kill it In a fissure
---
Thanks. So eventually once Bethesda sorts it, I will be able to paint the weapon and I'm not down 500 atoms for nothing?
---
 I find this hard to believe. No offense. Are we getting the full story here?
---
Plasma gatling is a good PvE weapon, but pvp, itd be touch to use it because of the spool time. Plasma gatling is a major mess atm since the last patch and is pretty hard to use. Also energy weapons dont benefit from anti armor so thats another downside to them.
---
Oh
---
My first 3* was a level 30 Suppressor's Hatchet. Can't remember the other mods, but its nothing anybody would ever actually use. I kept it in case we get weapon racks so I can display it like the framed first dollar some small stores put up.
---
One of my lower level characters had a Barbed Vampire's Walking Cane. I like it, but it makes me feel a little bad that my cool sneaky sword using ninja type character doesn't even have a sword because the cane is better than any I've found with him.
---
YES OMG
---
Wut, the pc bros can just server hop it and get the cans? They've always been tied to my player.. Daddy Sony probably does it for our own safety.
---
so they do double damage? since it uses two sets of perks to stack?
---
Yeah it's crazy. It's as if the game sucked and Bethseda had tons of things to fix but still moved at snails pace. Lol. If there was more to the content, there would be less complaints.
---
(That's cute)[https://i.imgur.com/704XxaV.jpg]
---
The non automatic pistol and rifle perks for the bolt action and revolver, and for automatic pipe weapons the automatic perks. You have to put a stock on the pipe weapon for it to benefit from sets of perks.
---
I was more interested in the plasma rifle, the Gatling plasma was always pretty good, it just chased frame rate drop on Xbox so I never really used it for long
---
My bad. I thought I was looking at new posts. Wasn't trying to start beef, I was just really floored  about 30k cuz I'm all about my capflow.
---
Sounds good, I‚Äôll be on around 8pm :)
---
Probably intended because if not it would be too powerful. Right now its an actual drawback is it was only like 8% more damage everyone would just stack it and roll around being super resist.
---
Right now if you have two people run it then it more or less cancles out so it only benefits those who don't run it. Which means taking it is an actual sacrifice for the sake of the team.
---
Check your internet... I haven‚Äôt had any issues
---
I know Bethesda uses reddit as their main source of feedback but the biggest thing they are looking for is bugs
---
I have a spare prime plan for said gun if you're interested
---
He glitched on the stairs long enough for me to get this https://imgur.com/gallery/rM3RZj8
---
Xbox or ps4?
---
Just found a Jangles Monkey on a stretcher in a medical room, with an Alien stuffed toy on his face. Obviously an Alien facehugger reference, in the AVR medical center. I love the story telling and Easter eggs of the scenes the designers put together.
---
Or when I found a card game gone wrong.  Box with 50 caps on it, a dead body in a chair on the left, knife stuck in the heart, 10mm barely dangling from the right hand. On the other side, a dead body and a tipped over chair who was shot by the person she just stabbed.
---
Pc :(
---
Ah I see. Well it‚Äôs all speculation at this point. What we know is that legendary item drops seem to have taken a hit, and last time this happened Bethesda announced a PTW feature following that. From there either you want to discuss the possibilities or you don‚Äôt. I happen to enjoy rational, information-based speculation.
---
More looking at 30k+, sold my last full marine suit on FB for 50k
---
Yw
---
This is my suspicion too.
---
It's loading in and the server is going "ookay radroach here, ghoul here, another ghoul there, 1 radroach is up here" and your client is all "yep yep cool great just placing them in memory now great" and the server goes "oh- and they're dead". 
---
Aaand then your client has to kill them all. Something like that.
---
Do you mean the gun plan or the prime receiver plan? The prime receiver plans will drop as you do more fights so you can't have done 87 and never received it. If it's the gun plan, you can buy it from Watoga, I wasn't aware it was a standard queen drop. The prime receivers drop each fight until you have them all btw.
---
I need the Gatling laser before I can even use the prime receiver but yeah I could use it!
---
I appreciated this. I do it too.
---
I thought yesterday's were alright. My wife and I running around Watoga in our formal wear to meet the requirements for the level up challenge was pretty fun. Though I was a bit miffed when we had to kill two deathclaws on Deathclaw Island due to the game only rewarding the challenge to whomever dealt the killing blow.
---
Use Google translator to transcribe the page into German for you.
---
It's all another liberal conspiracy
---
Your data mining is correct within the  parameters of the game.   I think the complaint from people is much more basic.  It's not a complaint about  bad legendary gear.  It's a complaint about legendary enemies not appearing at all in places where they used to spawn regularly.   Sure, the chances of getting great legendary gear were always small. But they are reduced to zero if a formerly reliable spawn point for legendary enemies now spawns zero legendary enemies. 
---
Instead of a legendary super mutant dropping a one star wooden leg, there is no legendary super mutant at all.
---
I need the gun itself and I‚Äôve looked at watoga it‚Äôs not there... is it just shitty luck?
---
Lots of ppl know the plan and there aren't any legendaries so just get someone to make u one I'll sell u the plan for 500. Someone already commented and said they could make u one. I'll even throw in a couple of pre made cores to brighten your day :)
---
Yes. I cant mod any of my weapons at the moment only repair. I would assume this would get fixed with the next patch.
---
Yup, phoenix in Watoga has it, I sw it the other day when I bought the ultracite lser gun plan during an ill-advised research project.
---
I‚Äôd love to have the plans please god please
---
Hmmm that being said, i wonder if you have a team of 3 or 4, if it stacks. So basically 2 would cancel out with stranger jn numbers buff and after that, does it stack?
---
Do you have plague walker? And same question to you OP, /u/risseless do you have plague walker? I've noticed that even without having diseases this can piss off the vendorbot and brahmin. I eventually got rid of it because I wanted that longcoat from the vendorbot.
---
Makes me wonder what they plan to sell next, maybe legendary tokens in the atom shop? 
---
The sheep boss is an effing insult to players. Drill and wood pieces from a ‚Äòthree star boss‚Äô lmao. After getting another piece of wood garbage i fast travelled back to white spring and got a three star cavalier chameleon armor and a three star bloodied cryolayor by one-shot killing two ghouls with my fire axe, took me less than 30 sec and no ammo. What a joke this game has become.
---
Hmm, Mountain Honey is the only recipe I have left to obtain.  Does it drop from Biv's daily, or somewhere else?
---
My bad I'm on xbone lol
---
Anytime my camp can't be placed I just leave that world and sign into a new one and my camp is there 90% of the time. If your camp is unable to be placed there might be another player with a property line that overlaps yours in the world you were placed.
---
Thats not the problem.
---
I understand all english texts and viedeos but I cant speak it so good.
---
Fucking huge rip
---
Wondering the same. I‚Äôd be surprised if it was the person. Humans aren‚Äôt that bright after all.
---
Maybe look for something quick to medium speed, especially if it has instigating
---
just make some? its really not hard. claim posiden power plant and have at it.
---
They‚Äôve nerfed the cores, only solid way to get them is take a power plant workshop, or buy them average is like 50 caps a piece
---
We should have a ‚Äúpost your pet‚Äù gallery üòÇ
---
If you want it, you've less than 16 hours I believe. It's a pretty decent limited weapon.
---
Welcome to  The Whitesprings
---
I know, but the thing is previously I never had to do this. I had over 100 cores without even looking at some points. Don‚Äôt really need them either, it‚Äôs just my luck of finding them has fallen through the floor.
---
I'm sorry I must've misunderstood what your post was saying. I thought you meant you wanted to check the level of players in a server before entering it and meant lowbies could also do the same thing to find high level players.
---
yup
---
For sure, I totally meant sell it lol if you can't afford it, I could always place them for you lol
---
Good to know. Making a power armor build now, kinda sucks tho. So my Irish luck isn‚Äôt failing me then!
---
How much would you want for it?
---
If you are on Xbox, I‚Äôll take Ultracite Gatling Laser plans off you (not prime reciever, the actual gun plan).
---
That's the real one!
---
The plan, like 1k seems fair. Can't get them anymore lol
---
Also have to be in the ash heap
---
Not sure, I didn't grind it myself.
---
Just get the plan and build it, I'm not sure if there is a world spawn for the ultracite gatling, that's a question for the data miners :)
---
Yes. Read the other comments.
---
Lol, I know this spot, but i do not want it here since I love to play in survival. I know i sound like a puss but id rather not get blown up, I stuggle with the resources.
---
Power plant workshop are OP now, it gives you a lot of full fusion cores, I recommend you farm a lot of them because this will get nerfed for sure.. And take the 2x durability fusion cores card, you will never scape from your power armor
---
I can‚Äôt get the plan, if I could I wouldn‚Äôt be complaining lol, it‚Äôs ive been trying!
---
Honestly I'm betting there was a bug with legendary spawns that was causing them to happen more than they should have. I'm going to do a bunch more research into this to see if there's another issue with what's happening.
---
A good AA rifle or heavy can almost reach 100% with tank killer or stabilized. 5%-14% DR isn't much to protect you.
---
I‚Äôve reset it multiple times and speeds seem to be good. I have noticed that I always disconnect while I‚Äôm working on my CAMP. Is that related?
---
I used to run energy ammo weight reduction so that cores didn‚Äôt weigh as much, since they were easy to find. Is the twice as long perk better now?
---
I have tons of fusion cells
---
The long sessions are the best as that's when oftentimes you can end up in your own server. When you find you're alone in a server the game gets really good ;)
---
No one made you read the thing. You could just pass by. They want an opinion aside from paid off YouTubers and reviewers. Stop being an ass.
---
Thank you for the advice!
---
I need to grind a bunch of caps in a short time span..I'm trying to decide where..now that vendors share the same cap pool added an interesting dynamic to the gameplay
---
Me eight times out of nine, first time was a drill. Now if i could use that drill to mount all the garbage armor on the wall and make a poor wood loot exhibit, I won‚Äôt complain.
---
Yes and no, it's good to have those things but yea I see where you're coming from
---
That‚Äôs pretty steep, I‚Äôd do 600 max. If you‚Äôre on you can just place it.
---
It all depends on how many people join
---
In my teams test it doesn't look stackable. But we only have a 3 stack so it possible the difference of two buffs and the penalty wasn't noticeable enough for us to properly note. 
---
If you have two empaths and damage percent modifiers stack multiplicative it makes perfect sense for it to be balanced to even out as √ó1.33 and x0.75 work out roughly to 1.0 times damage (actually i think you get a slight edge in defense since its actually 4/3 and 3/4 are opposites so converting to decimal always gives a small edge in defense usually less than 0.25% though) 
---
A good way to test would be to get 3 empaths and 1 non empath in a team and test damage taken. Then get 1 empath and 1 non empath and try again.
---
But I'd say it probably doesn't for obvious balance reasons as 4 empaths would have a massive advantage like a constantly on sentinel  (less powerful, but should be like 44% damage reduction net gain)
---
Are you sure you were checking every location? Either way, just hop if that's happening. I play hours and hours every day and WS is pretty much guaranteed to give me 3* ghouls. Even if it's all in my head, hopping makes me feel better.
---
The other point I'd like to make is why not try playing the game for 2 hours, go to legendary spawn points, investigate the map, I'll tell you now, you'll have a lot better luck that way!
---
I've been tired of them for about five and a half months!
---
It all boils down to a specific combo of perks for a given weapon, and a build-supplementing armor.
---
For example quad harpoons are awesome, but different weapons with high base magazine do not benefit from it much.
---
Bloodied is great, but there's a bloody price to pay.
---
I'd say majority of weapons I use are either quad or bloodied.
---
For armor its super build specific and I'm sneaky bloodied sniper mixed up with cavalier and using only two unyielding pieces. Its a strange combination but works great imo.
---
It would be sweet if they had marsupial and speed demon. Heck even those electric rings that shoot out.
---
I know, I was thinking about making a post like, is this request hour? Good then I want a pon, a jetpack and like 50 hot broads ... etc
---
Could be that only human genes could become a petrified corpse and animals just died or turned into scorched or mutated animals
---
I always use it, I always just wear my power armor X-01 with mods I dont use nothing else, 20 full cores gives me more than 1 month playing
---
I think it would be nice to be able to use the brewing station to boil water. However, don't forget you can use the chemistry station to boil water too. It would be nice to make all three of them work to be consistent. It is "brewing" (boiling) water anyway.
---
Everyone read this in a super mutant voice
---
Yes! They said that we did something to them 3 weeks ago like destroying their property and Harassed them. Then out of nowhere someone joins and destroys my base for no reason and keeps on dooming it. He proceeded to join and join my server and until I blocked him. He then threatend many of our members. He said he did it because he was told too. Idk what‚Äôs going on I‚Äôm confused and my anxiety is kicking in idk. I jsut wanted a fun clan that‚Äôs not that serious and enjoy my time. I‚Äôm completely clueless.
---
Pretty sure that the comments being replied to weren't very pleasant from the op's perspective either.  I feel that those insisting she was wrong or leaping to questions of color blindness could have been better served to consider if they were missing something and asked for an explanation prior to posting too.  No matter how well intentioned or politely phrased, those replies dismissed any possibility they didn't understand what the op intended (when change is insulting, especially when making the leap to questioning things like color blindness).
---
System?
---
What... I wish it was only 40 even! Lol, must have something to do with the amount stored I‚Äôm guessing. But hopefully they can adjust this in the future soon!
---
Supersledge. You can swing faster without marital artist by blocking after hitting your target.
---
You need well equipped personnel and usually a good nuke placement to allow bloodied builds to join the fight. This is done by launching the nuke so that the Prime Site is just on the edge of the Ground Zero Ring.
---
Yes! I have a Deathclaw Gauntlet with executioner, only really I don‚Äôt use it more is because I‚Äôm often in Power Armor.
---
Yeah. I saw that... I wasn't able to get a good shot so I didn't say anything.
---
Have you seen the Mr. and Ms. handy caught in a conversation loop?
---
Never said I didn‚Äôt check other places.  I actually don‚Äôt usually spend much time in WS for this exact reason.  My base is in Watoga.  Just making the point (one most agree with) that the legendary loot pool in WS is crap.  Literally not one 2 or 3 * legendary in two hours of constant rotations through WS last night.
---
Maybe someone should start
---
r/Bethesdaplease
---
Yes! It makes sense to make alcohol out of purified water anyway. Keep the boiled water for other food and drinks and use purified water for alcohol would be a good idea
---
That‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm sorry if I seemed abrasive.
---
I still manage well with workshop raids as well.
---
Exactly... like why have to pay again just because a few trees are in the way!
---
Actually took over that Workshop a couple of days ago for like 2 hours. Usually I don't take workshops because of the PVP issues but every once in awhile if I spawn in and my Camp couldn't be placed so I will do that for a bit.  Plus on that day somebody had taken munitions factory and set it up pretty nicely then logged off so I was able to take that and start benefiting from it immediately. 
---
When I was about to log off I actually messaged a couple people on the server that all had workshops to and asked if anybody wanted them but no takers. For these days I want to do what I've seen other people do and get a team of like four people and just go around and try to take every Workshop
---
&gt;4 did and make legendary mutations actually MEAN something and provide some sort of buff.  
---
The legendary enemies in FO4 had a buff to them?
---
I have an unarmed build and man I have so many to choose from. Robots? Covered. Players? Covered.
---
I mainly use executioners on nearly everything because it also has 40% seing speed.
---
Seems to me your clan started it, and these guys are attacking back. You might be involuntarily involved in a war man.
---
Around Flatwoods, around the path you would take when exiting that vault for the first time. Maybe even as a far north as Morgantown. There‚Äôs that highway that runs from Flatwoods to Morgantown, I think setting up in between the 2 on the highway would be a great spot.
---
*Pro-Tip*
---
If you have the perks that allow you to repair past 100%, repairing any weapon or PA torso with a core in it has the +100% perk applied to it as well.
---
Win(!)
---
Patch notes usually leave out many things that are then mentioned in comments here. Especially with sneaky nerfs.
---
Thank u sir
---
Or let me boil purified water, it's just water.
---
It was removed did si s suadtxgxg f2f ,what did it say
---
I'm not on a fissure site nor any spawn location for enemies. Its simply I get frequent attacks.
---
Is this completely unequipping to wear I'm punching? Or just holstering a weapon?
---
Fallout: Morrowind...perfect!
---
Oh man, if it was like 30 i could join. Heavy Guns build.
---
Wut? All I said was no, actually. Not an attack. But I see that I dodged a bullet. I doubt you want a middle aged lesbian Bernie Sanders supporter on your team and especially not one that's level 308
---
I've found a few scorched during scorched earth. A pain to deal with their bouncing around while trying to shoot a big bad bat.
---
I was overweight.
---
I mean, maybe?  How elaborate is your camp?  My technical knowledge is along the ‚Äòdid you try turning it off and on again‚Äô
---
I use these pretty much all the time, much as I want to wear a different hat I just find them too useful to give up.  Hoping for a head lamp mod for some of the other hats (or maybe even an option for all) eventually.  I'd love it if it was an option for things like the ranger hats, hunting hats, military helmets, etc.
---
No Problem.
---
But you might have to reconsider to wanting _both_ : Well visited but safe for  survival.
---
"Dat ain't nuttin! Hold my beer! " (Rolls up sleeves) "Heeeers howya launch an NOOK..."
---
I could say the same to you. One could just search the sub for all the previous answers to this very question.
---
Yes. By Christmas.
---
Are you stating it as a fact or a suggestion?
---
Suggestion, hoping to will it into existence
---
All of that sucks, but wouldn't be nearly as bad if triggering the event didn't cost 2,000 caps.  I mean, it's much harder than the typical event, requires  grinding just to trigger it,  but drops the same kinds of loot you get from random legendary spawns.
---
Np. Sure they could do that. It works both ways. But if the the one looking to start up an event or launch. It is ideal to check the current state of the world before the long (or not long gear depending) haul of work to do so.
---
All the events are worthless, they let you fight a bunch of 50-60+ then the boss is 40 or lower. They capped the bosses so people won‚Äôt get max level loot. Awol used to be the only one that you might get max level loots, then after many youtubers bragged about how they can farm it, its loot quality was nerfed to shit. Even SBQ and the latest sheep drop garbage most of the time. If they thought by doing this they can keep their players around for 7600 hours, their calculation is way off.
---
Thank you! Wasnt sure I would make it when all the assaultrons showed up.
---
Or one could get personal help with the lovely helpful people of this subreddit. Maybe get some tips.

Anyone else tired of the endless "anyone else" posts?

You need to stick to 1 or 2 weapons. I have 1 handed melee and rifleman. Once you get the perks for the particular weapon you will be set.  I would use your Fixer rifle and see if you can't find a good machete. The machete will fit your  chef build pretty good.

What's special about the bone hammer? I have it. Weights lile twelve fucking pounds and does 105 base damage. Found it a long time ago. Is it not supposed to be in the game or something?
---
I just farm sentry bots they still have fusion cores! Just hop a few servers and I‚Äôm good to go!
---
I was under the impression the petrified corpses happened when the bombs dropped and scorched appeared after due to a mutation.
---
If you have a mic you can find people and trade for stuff you actually use. That's usually what I do.
---
I'm not sure about the XB1 community, but on PS4 it seems pretty rare to find the event going on, I've done it for hours at a time and not find a single one
---
Making my first character a power armor build
---
Any advice on what perks would be best?
---
I've had it in my stash box for like three fucking months. I'll double check next time I log on but I may have sold it the other night to clear up space, thinking at the time, "why would I need it". Then this post. FFS. It was cool looking, but slow as hell
---
LOL! That's a great story and so true.
---
Bethesda will be their usual half assed selves and make it so you can't sell serums to vendors. mark my words ,take advantage of it while you can
---
I won t be on for like another 5 hours. But yeah, I could place them
---
Honestly, I can live with that stuff. Humans tend to measure risk vs. reward, so less risk and full reward is a no brainer, even if it's annoying for the rest of us.
---
I just hate when someone starts the event with only two or three people on the server.
---
I gotta re-install and update so I just wanted to see if it was the worth the time man
---
Until its a heavy weapon, I'm not interested lol
---
Very similar experience here, except in my case the 2 times I did it, the body disappeared before I could loot it. 
---
I went up to it and got an infinite spinning wait cursor. Walked away to loot some bots, walked back, the sheepsquatch was just ... gone. No meat pile. Gone.
---
There are more high level 2 and 3 star enemies. That is probably why you seem to find more drops. You don't find many 3 star legendaries in the forest area.
---
You're main objective was launching that nuke so that was the goal.
---
Not to give the typical IT guy answer, but you might try uninstalling (through Windows - Add/Remove Programs) and then reinstalling (through the Bethesda launcher).
---
It‚Äôll be placed in your spot when you join another world, even if you decided to stay in the other one.
---
Well i have not played in a long time and with the game having low reviews I thought it just died out
---
You'll have to place it.
---
So you don't wanna help build the community? I get I should of looked up the question before posting but I 90% of this sub is negative shit I don't see the harm in this. You know that growing the player base overall helps the game?
---
And I appreciate all the responses here guys
---
Leather is nothing to be jealous of. My ghoul slayer's baton, on the other hand, is a different story.
---
I set the trade for 6000 caps. Sell the item requested for 6000 caps and and buy the trade item back for the same amount. That way if they take off at least you got something.
---
How do you even start the fight? Every time I got to the terminal I says it can't do the quest at this time or something like that.
---
If any game were perfect, we'd screw it up by playing it.
---
What do you think about the UI bug explanation? This guy is claiming it's that and the data verifies.  I'm about to straight up do 30-50 runs right now to see what I get.
---
First one is free, after that, you need a card to trigger the event.  To make a card, you need a 2000 cap circuit board from the vendor.
---
HAPPY CAKE DAY
---
Just take over poseidon
---
Pretty good idea. It would get rid of that lazy farming method and make more people actually engage with some of the locations in the game.
---
How many people are you willing to bet just farm locations without ever exploring them properly?
---
No clue. I've seen it for sale raider shops but never bought it cause it was always below my level. (And before anyone asks, yes, I'm sure it was the hammer and not the club.)
---
It does seem to be rare, but I have no reason to believe it's not supposed to be in the game.
---
That‚Äôs great, thank you
---
It has a long cool down. Best to serverhop with group
---
I will see your baton and raise you my 3* Stalkers Mr Handy Buzz Blade.  The only 3* I have received from this event in 15 or so successful attempts.
---
That's just it I dont pull it
---
For me the wendigo kill didn‚Äôt work. Trying to server hop soon... anyone else with that problem?
---
How is nothing i said a fact. You're obviously not going to properly read what i'm saying to just get mad that you're ok with these kinds of systems for whatever reason when the more likely than not tarnish the rest of the game experience in almost every case i can think of.
---
People like me are the problem, nah people like you my friend. When did i say someone had to hold my hand. You're fucking delirious seriously bro. Go outside talk to some normal people get a fucking grip.What's fair about systems designed to get people to spend on "limited item" in a shop that's saying stuff is limited trying to get people to buy the item not in fear it will go away. You don't call that trickery. You don't see grocery stores selling bread and saying limited item get it while it's here, unless it's a seasonal thing. I can sit here and show you numerous examples of systems like these , but you'll defend or reject every single on for god knows what reason. If you would rather have so called "free dlc" but have half of the stuff we would normally get to strive for in gameplay locked behind paywalls.Tell me what reason do they have to make things limited ...ill wait for your response to this. You don't think thats a form of trying to trick people into spending their money, when more than likely you will at some point see that item back on the shop. Anthem does this constantly. Well im done anyways, people like you are very one dimensional in their thinking, and it's obvious to me that you think these are great features to have. So hope you have fun being the problem because people like you are why we have games like this anymore.
---
Some of these are decent, but some of them are way too over the top.
---
Ah that‚Äôs great. Thanks!
---
Right? I thought maybe I misread dudes post or something. For the record, I found it right outside the wendigo cave.
---
This week my kills-in-one-life stands at 25. I'm not interested in spawn-camping, I want competetive experience, I actively seek powerful enemies so I die quite often too.
---
The thing is the information is the key and the sharks are reluctant to share it as its giving out your aces to other sharks. The game is full of mechanics that are vaguely described, work as implemented, and people are generally unaware of them. If you dont play with VATS yourself you'll have hard time learning how to move in this game and what are the safe distances. Its obligatory to become master VATSer even for those who ideologically refuse to use it - it is possible to be deadly against vatsers while simultaneously denying them access to VATS, and I'm not referring to stealth boys, but you really just gotta git gud in the specific realities this environment provides. And this is a game where shitty shooters placed strategically will dominate and you have to be extremely smart about your movement. 
---
The player economy and the opinions of the majority were based on the half year period of slap damage reality. Reality where three best aggresive tactics were to stand in the way and get shot, to slap and survive retaliation because of standing still gear, or to define initiation of PvP encounter by having a buddy contest workshops. The 'meta' for such conditions has nothing to do with meta for open PvP reality. Give a seasoned PvPer a fresh level 65 character with no points spent, two 1* weapons of their selection, a set of 1* armor of their selection. Place them against a player with assassin sentinel thats medicore fighter and that has no team backup to ensure his sentinel armor can be put to any use. The seasoned PvPer with 'trash' gear will heavily dominate. The good news is that with recent changes to games math many previously irrelevant weapons are now effective, the estabilished prices have mostly little to do with actual combat effectiveness, and awesome armor that's actually useful in the map control game the high-end survival is - this armor is often very cheap. The cheapest possible survival-effective build is now chameleon/assasin/unyielding armor on a sneaky sniper that uses bloodied automatic weapons. Max PE, AGI, LUCK, rest adjusted accordingly to team composition. Also, if you are running without a team you are either prey or a legend. Get a team. Team vs Team PvP is what this game was meant for.
---
It has a very long cool down. Best to server hop
---
When you go through the door into the room with the leaking pipes go immediately to the left and follow the wall and lock pick the first door you come across. (level 3 )
---
You will bypass the leaking pipes - which is really tedious.
---
Good to see people helping each other still.   I always worry that anything I drop will despawn before it gets found.   I try to stash stuff in the overseers box in flatwoods for anyone who wants it.
---
How about just going to the FO4 style of trading where you set up the deal and it's not finalized until you "accept" it. Of course, it would have to be accepted by bother parties in this case. 
---
You each set your item to 0, then each adds it to their part of the deal. The items don't change hands until the deal is confirmed.  Would also allow more complicated trades. 
---
For this to work though we need them to fix the issue that randomly kicks us out of trade menus, otherwise large deals will become obnoxious to set up.
---
Yes completely adding insult to injury. The sheep‚Äôs drop is way worse than ordinary ghoul. I don‚Äôt remember getting so many wood pieces steadily. Whoever is behind the reward system of this game should lose his job. You make the bosses more rewarding so that low levels will play hard and hope one day they can kill a boss for great loot. In Fo76 you leave the vault and make your way to WS and that‚Äôs the place you‚Äôll ever need to be because all events and big bosses give you mostly shit. Only fight them if your ammo is taking up too much stash space.
---
The other day I found a logging trail with a Jeep that got stuck and two corpses in it, I went to the top and found their camp, I love how Bethesda does the deep side stuff
---
Yep. I've dropped them immediately after completing Scorched Earth to do it again. Overlap zones if you want, you'll not double the rads.
---
Never tried to mod one before but can you even mod them?
---
It has a unique stock and magazine, so does it even let you change the mods on it?
---
Thanks I'll look again on my next trip
---
Just a steady "Beep", though I could be wrong here on repeated testing and I may have actually been hearing the workbench in the area. Sorry.
---
Well, it seems whatever was happening sorted its self out. Thanks for the replies nonetheless!
---
Gunna go tonight then lol
---
Not even a little bit.

I am, however, sick of off topic rants against on-topic posts like \_this\_ bullshit post, though.
---
All Rise
---
Excellent response here.
---
Hi. Pmed you.
---
That's pretty awesome. You must have had the Mysterious Bethesda card equipped.
---
I had one, covered in those spikes, or spurs or whatever but blood also. Weighed TWELVE FUCKING POUNDS though.
---
Its main use is to spam through trees to kick the sneaky snipers out of their hiding. For that particular purpose they are useful. Antiarmor is indeed useless for energy weapons, but since plazmas do mixed damage, I'm not sure how thats calculated, might be more complicated. I'm not saying its great. I'm just saying they could be put to use for specific situations. I usually wear few weapons for different combat scenarios, for high-str builds this is a valid tool.
---
Found one of these not too long ago at the White springs after it was nuked. Didn‚Äôt even know they existed. I‚Äôve found about 4 different types of Mothman now!
---
I just get nylon when I loot them, odd
---
I've gotten my 3* armor pieces while just out wandering around. Fast travel is good if you are limited by time, but people who do it everywhere miss out on so much.
---
I got mine server hopping. I took me 5 days total of about   8 hrs. I got the arms next armor workbench in grafton steel on a open locker. Chest at the ¬†Eastern Regional Penitentiary armor workbench between wall and workbench and legs at top of the world next to armor work bench. Also heard you can get it from events in the toxic valley.
---
Better than paper and lies.
---
They do some really great things in the game that I feel add a great attention to detail in a playful way. It‚Äôs these little things that always get me by the glitches so my time in Appalachia is always fun.

It is

I always loved dragging bodies into a big pile in FO3. It was tough but honest work.
---
really would be nice to just have a entire suggestions thread separate from standard threads
---
&gt; Yes completely adding insult to injury. The sheep‚Äôs drop is way worse than ordinary ghoul. 
---
It's something I've noted before: Bethesda actually removing incentives to do entire quests.  "Distant Thunder" is another example of such an event. Do I really need another sit of T-60 motion assist servo plans? Do I need plans for a power armor piece that I already own? Well no.
---
Bloodied melee is one, stealth sniper, senitel something, there‚Äôs all kind of builds just what you prefer
---
They go for a lot more, especially a full suit
---
This is a good point. That mole rat could have given him a disease that he didn't have when he found the vendor.

lols there is 2 bears in a cardboard box rowing across a lake as well and some frying up fish to

I got 2 3 star gutsy in a single squatch event a day or two ago.
---
Do you have one. Cause I can pay a lot more
---
I do have one
---
Same happened to me yesterday. A fellow neighbour came around to say hi, gave my tree house bar a thumbs up, dropped a couple plans and went on his way. I regret not remembering I had dropped over 3k bullets just 5 minutes prior to that. Could've paid him back for the plans.

I agree only if all building perks become passive!
---
This had to be done because people were blocking the workbench so you had to become wanted to initiate a claim.
---
Heard flute playing yesterday when I was doing order of mysteries quest at the ski lodge near top of the world, but was too busy fighting mole miners and scorched to investigate. By the time I killed them all there was no flute playing anymore.
---
Are you using mods
---
Yeah, same. Which is why I will actively search out someone to get it. I will pick someone lowish level on the map and travel to them and stalk them (in a creepy way with chameleon, full cultist outfit, etc). 
---
Just to see what they are up to. After freaking them out a bit, I'll drop some stuff assuming they haven't run away before then (it happens)
---
Would the perk that drops a live grenade do anything for that? Never used it myself but i guess it depends on how long it takes for the grenade to go off. Still it would be nice to watch some douchbag get wrecked doing that shit.
---
You can mod it with any combat rifle mods. It doesn't have any unique parts. Those are just recolored combat rifle parts.
---
Looks like a place to fill my gluttonous sensation to rittle a enemy with endless 5mm rounds.

T51 offers best dr/er against any other Power armour.

Excavator is good for loot luggers and mining ore.

I friend of a friend got some plans like this from a guy on Xbox One called MrWaywolf. He might have some plans, think he farms them.

What's the exact location of the second card. I'm on the roof of the house with a female who died on a bed after the bombs fell.

I'm still too paranoid for any popular drop points like the overseer box/train station cash registers. I'm waiting until player vending and then I'll be selling my couple hundred spare plans for dirt cheap
---
I've been fortunate to kill her twice with good groups, it's awesome. The one time we failed we didn't have enough fire power and numerous players in the building, she flew away. It's a major defeat when that happens, we all looked at each other ???.
---
How much would you sell it for
---
I doubt they fixed it. They‚Äôre not very fast about fixing broken loot drops.
---
Crafted item durability. 
---
Dropped item durability is supposedly dictated by luck.
---
yeah look what they did to the swamp lmao. imagine letting them get ahold of a camera
---
I'm gonna try to get a group of players together and legendaries together and do a massive test, and pay the testers caps. I'm still getting all the necessary resources ready however.
---
A mutation in Fallout 4 causes the following things to happen to an enemy:
---
*     It will regain their health completely
---
*     It will get a damage boost of about ~50%
---
*     Certain enemies get a damage reduction against the damage you used most against him before mutation
---
Legendary mobs also had a chance to start glowing a certain color with each color meaning a different mutation, including
---
*     Green aura: The mob deals much more radiation damage per second 
---
*     Orange aura: The mob deals additional DoT damage with each hit
---
*     Red aura: The mob gets a huge damage boost to the boost he already gets. 
---
*     Yellow aura: The mob has highly increased movement speed.
---
This is for the x1 plans, correct? 9f so you need to go to the terminal in the WS Bunker and download them.
---
Thanks that's all I needed to hear
---
Ooh, I like the direction they're going with that. I recently got a max level AA combat rifle, but now I can choose between +26.1% damage or +20% damage and better sneak. Finally reasonable trade-offs
---
What platform? I think I still have mine, and I don‚Äôt play anymore. I‚Äôd be more than happy to give you my lvl 50 all rise if you‚Äôre on Xbox.
---
You know what sucks. I have 3 on Xbox lmfao
---
It is quite annoying when I can fast-travel to locations that the challenge is still asking me to "discover".
---
Fuuuuck
---
does it change back to the combat rifle wooden stock and default magazine if you mod it?
---
Mods are glitched rn apparently
---
Do you not have psuedoephedrine-free decongestants in the USA?
---
That's very nice from you but sadly i'm on ps4
---
It‚Äôs all I get from the queen ;-;
---
Sorry just edited it... PS4
---
Huh, well TIL, i never actually noticed anything other than the HP regain they got as they usually died too wuickly or i was too OP to feel any negative efftects of their mutations
---
I have a level 35 TSE dragon I was lucky enough to find off a ghoul. It's nowhere near as powerful after the nerf, but damn does it still destroy enemies. Only issue is how it breaks after like 15 shots
---
are you actually dumb af, of course, they were close to bankruptcy with the destruction of fo76 they lost money that they could have gotten if they made a solo game if Rage 2 and the new Elders Scrolls fail they are not going to have much money left.
---
So your saying there's no way to equip it currently?
---
I would take them all
---
As I said previously, this question has been asked and answered repeatedly. 
---
Your post has nothing to contribute to building a community and whenever I see this question posed, I automatically lump it in with the negative shit you refer to.  Venture deeper into the sub, look around and check the other fallout subs. 
---
This one is mostly about reporting new bugs or trying to make suggestions to Bethesda, so you are going to see a lot of negative in this sub.
---
I would give them for free at this point lol
---
I would very much enjoy ammo scrapping, as ammo is always a scarcity for the weapons you use most. Turning unused ammo into useful ammo would be awesome. 
---
I'm fine with it remaining unsellable, so long as I can break it down into base materials, even at like a 50% loss or something.
---
I was looking for these plans ( still are ) though luckily I got the gun off a level 80 SB at Whitesprings station after attacking the sh#t out of me. It wouldn't leave me alone as I was heading elsewhere.
---
It's a classic - the SB don't like it one bit. You can tell when someone is using this gun at a SBQ event.
---
Good to see they‚Äôve cut away most of the enormous orange vines
---
It's not like they're ever going to listen to those posts anyway.
---
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Ah, too bad.
---
Im curious now. Would you mind elaborating on what posr exactly you posted and what the redditor didn't like about it? Thanks.
---
On the destroyed  roof  near some junk
---
Nope for the game and nope for the power armor either
---
Ive killed the 80 scorch beast underground and the queen 87 times and neither fu king drop it lol
---
D1E HARD TOO, i can place all of the fasnacht stuff
---
cuz those are C.A.M.P. items and are cheap if they end up adding this it will be like 1500-2000 atoms
---
Understood. I found it.
---
Nope. Like I said, it's just a skin. Any parts you put on it will retain the original skin.
---
I got my "shielded" plan a few weeks ago from Uranium Fever.
---
I currently do NOT know the 3rd level liner, never got it. So they can be learned out of order.
---
Yep. Been waiting since last patch to attach MIRV to my two shot. Hopefully it will be fixed come the patch on Tuesday
---
Yeppers
---
Bethesda, please start removing posts on the subreddit asking for Bethesda to add features to their game.
---
Can confirm, I've seen both the eyebot and the rats, and the Mr. Handy with the dogs, both at Charleston Station.
---
Also, final note, I doubt I ever met a hacker myself (heard valid-sounding rumours, described things impossible in this game and when saying impossible lets just say I know how to legitly catapult people across notable distances). I believe 95% of the times player spot unkillable enemies its lack of appropriate tool, 4.(9)% lag, and true PvP glitching and PvP hacking is extremely rare, spreads fast and results in bans, disrupting the communites of people doing this type of stuff. I myself am called hacker regularly because people don't know that cavalier (or sentinel, which I dont favor myself) armor works like such that if you spam damage to their wearer when the effect is active their health will jump back and forth before estabilishing and calculating the final value. I have never ever met an enemy that was wrecking people around that couldn't be killed. I met guys which I had super hard time to kill, but zero true unkillables. I once met a legend that had 116 kills-in-this-life on him and I managed to score him down like twice. Somebody stole the record-taking kill from me seconds before tho. He wrecked me much more overall. He just was a fucking legend. Gotta git gud myself.
---
At least assaultron head guns are fixed.
---
I imagine it will be fixed with patch today.
---
And Gatling lasers / plasmas... ish.
---
Oh I'm so sorry. 
---
Should I be all "it's super duper unfair that people who cheated and created long lasting I'm balanced and problems due to duping specific weapons and such got banned and missed content. They only spoiled it for the rest of us, and made it significantly harder for BGS to balance new content. It's an outrage. Unban them asap, give them 5000 free atoms, and all the TSE weapons they can carry"
---
I hope your ban is never lifted.
---
How did they fix those?
---
They're not really hard to kill especially if you just go to death law island it's a like level 21 spawn
---
Any idea if it's true you get the helmet paint by scrapping the helmet? 
---
I've been searching them out for a while.  Many thanks to the other poster on here with spawn point tips. :D
---
I always wondered if some poor sod would have three corpses fall out of the sky and wonder what the frak was going on
---
So, if you change mag to a drum mag, it won't actually put a drum mag on it? The parts just stay static on this gun?
---
It seems like the explosive prefix breaks weapons down quickly as well. I have a Quad Explosive Ultracite Laser Gun and a Quad Ultracite Laser Gun with no explosive; the difference is noticeable. 
---
Is it possible that durability loss from Legendary prefixes scales with damage dealt per shot? Someone who has looked into the .esm night know.
---
Was a bug if you swapped weapons and swapped back  you would have the amount of shorts equal to how many cores you had for that weapons such as you could have 500 then swap to another weapon and have 20 shot if you had 20 fusion cores. But now it‚Äôs fixed so shows the correct amount on the core but each time after reloading you will fire one bullet and that‚Äôs it , have to let go of the trigger and fire again for the other 499
---
Indeed,  looks like ui interactions are covered by it as well.  [this](https://variety.com/2019/gaming/news/video-games-cvaa-accessibility-law-1203099440/)  mentioned a little broader spectrum of what is required.  It also says game companies are surpassing the requirements by large...because people a cool!
---
Anyone want my 1* gamma gun I just got off the queen.  Well worth my time and bullets. What a joke. 
---
On a side note, the legendary spawns are still quite good at WesTek and Whitespings (non-nuked). Now the drops are not all that good but regularly get 6-7 legendary items each run. Most drops come from non legendary enemies as well.
---
A downvote? Bethesda, that you?
---
Noooo
---
If you put a different mag on it, the mag will still be green. Wooden stock: green, hardened receiver: green.
---
No. Time-gating crafting is just a way to waste the player's time and could be more easily implemented by allowing a player to craft multiple items at once. 
---
For example, your junk nets you a combined 351 steel.  The game already computes this number when you open the crafting menu.  It divides by 30 (# of steel in a bull) and determines you can make 11.  A slider appears with options from 1-11. You choose 11. It tells you it will take 330 steel and 22 plastic, you confirm. Boom. 11 bulk steel.
---
I go to top of the world spawn, run to the cabins and grab the three tin can traps, then to the opposite entrance for three more.  Each gives you 9 cans, so 54 total.  108 steel and 54 lead per run, takes maybe 3-4 mins, plus some enemies you can farm, as well as aluminum and fiberglass in the ski poles and skis if you want to farm those as well.
---
Mods don't work currently like most people are saying. 
---
Multi cannon or repeating shot canister? I hope you mean multi cannon because I haven't seen that mod but need it now. I don't think multi cannon exists.
---
Basically x core ammo when swapping becomes (example 20 shots) that?
---
All rise is kind of a basic starter in my opinion , any 3 star is comparable where as ones with bloodied, Anti armor ,Furious ,executioners, prefixes are marginally better
---
Atoms rewarded 1/2
---
I need more lead in my life tired of running out of 5.56
---
I just call it that lol. And yes it is repeat shot. Extended magazine
---
Yep, I had that happen to me last week and even before that, one dropped right into my garden.  I guess it was good fertilizer lol.
---
Probably all day
---
Passive mode in the options.
---
Not sure gt Travis party181
---
Right? The posts should be ‚ÄúBethesda, you suck for releasing this shit heap and then continuously being greedy with your awful Atom Shop while only adding two new quests in the 6 months since release‚Äù instead of begging and pleading with this company that owes you way more than you owe them.
---
Fuck I forgot I feel stupid now
---
Well i wished i'd get one of those but all i get is crappy legendary armor
---
