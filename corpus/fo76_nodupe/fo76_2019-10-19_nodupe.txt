Yes but very poorly. 
---
Before the grass would not get removed upon placing foundation or anything for that matter now it doesn't. 
---
Bulldozed. More like lawn mower feature lol
---
---
---
I got mine from a nice,  generous person from this sub. (I traded some stuff,  but no where near what this plan is worth.  Thanks again! )
---
That is the feature
---
True, but for whatever reason explosive legendaries never seem to work for me as I tend to sneak up on enemies to make sure I'm well in range and can unload some concentradted fire and I generally end up damaging myself with explosives.
---
The thought process here just shows that you're an antisocial ass. Thanks for making the game less fun for everyone else.
---
Strangler
---
Damn right
---
Besides all the advertisements. Would you rather your gameplay interrupted to watch an ad? Lol
---
You don't have a youtube account? 
---

---
I need the video and you need a youtube account
---
If you want to build a PA suit, you have to farm.
---
I try to have 10 of each bulk, and round down none bulk to 200. Exceptions to this are Ballistic Fiber Plastic and Lead. The rest is outfits. No aid, No weapons, and some sets of armor I swap for certain situations, which forces me to use Ultra Light.
---
Nope I don't store any items
---
Usually what I do (due to the absolutely ridiculously broken idea that killing the workshop owner doesn't immediately claim the workshop, which is how these griefer asshats are able to repeatedly kill the poor lower level trying to scrape together mats) is come back, completely ignore trying to fight, and spend the time they are shooting at me deleting everything from the workshop. Sure, you can have the spot, but all those turrets, all that machinery? Build it your damn self.
---
yeah, secthegreat
---
As I read through the comments I am hearing the in old man ‚Äúget off my lawn‚Äù ‚Äúback in the day‚Äù voices, lol

---
Thank you for this insight!
---
Nothing wrong with emoji use as long as it is appropriate and not excessive. I didn't see your unedited comment
---
It signifies prestige. When I see other players with those peasant metal letters on their vending machines I feel better about myself.
---
No I would not. But i would also like a game to be stable before asked to pay more.
---
The days of camp destruction was amazing. Orbital strikes were a must lool
---
It'd work better if there was some form of scarcity. If weapons and gear was permanently destroyed after being repaired one too many times. If the environment was hostile and if limb damage didn't magically disappear.
---
Fo76 is fun, but its more looter shooter than survival simulator.
---
Laser pointer on eye glasses can get people into heaps of trouble. Maybe break a glowstick and toss it.
---
A player died in scorched earth, came back and was looking for the paper bag. I shot at the bag and they found it straight away.
---
The only purpose of that challenge is to track how many hours you‚Äôve played. It isn‚Äôt actually something you are supposed to grind for lol
---
Gotcha, I hadn‚Äôt used them before I don‚Äôt think, it just fit with the post because it was supposed to sound sort of sarcastic and bratty.
---
Thank you to everyone who provided insight!
---
Can i kill and stuff mama murphy next time i get instigating reduced weight walking cane and put in my camp
---
Actually, when we buy from mama, the scrips can be transferred over to the legendary vendor machine. Chicken n egg thingie
---
You aren‚Äôt be asked to pay more for adventure mode. You only pay more if you are asking them to provide you with a provide server... which cost money.
---
That seems like a lot of GPU for just running the video loop on the title screen.  
---
Maybe go into the game directory and run the .exe directly using the right click and "run on this gpu" option?  
---
Just trying to rule stuff out.
---
Don't use blueprints .)
---
Yes I know.  I wasn‚Äôt being mean.  I just loved it because I can relate.  The way you worded it was perfect.  Not sure how to explain it, It just was a comment made by someone who is really enjoying the game and I always think that is great.
---
And the lack of humility from BGS to ask that in the current state is mind boggling. Downvoting me isnt going to change my mind, my dude or the reality.
---
Ah ok, my bad. I misunderstood what you meant and thought it was kind of a sly dig at me.
---
 Ithing in the game let's you get 0 rads in a rad zone
---
I just prefer the way the doorways look, I didn‚Äôt come up with it and I can‚Äôt remember the first camp I saw using this idea but I also have a backwards facing bookshelf in the doorway when my machines are ‚Äúopen‚Äù that lists what‚Äôs for sale in the machine and has a few decorations on it
---
I bought 10 off of some guy on the trading sub like 3 months ago and just recently just remembered I had a couple left. I‚Äôve been keeping them for trade but I might need caps so 5k seems like a fair deal.
---
You realize that is no longer a problem right? All of that stuff was purged months ago man.
---
See I get you, this works a little in 76 but unfortunately you're so limited in camp budget and customisation options that it quickly gets boring. Once I've filled my budget there's pretty much nil to improve or add unless I reconstruct my entire camp. Which I've done many many times
---
I mean I could sit there playing simulator but it breaks the cycle to be told no constantly by the game
---
And only 800hrs in game. Not bad. Took me probably 1100hrs for the same except ones that won‚Äôt activate. Haven‚Äôt spent any atoms either and I‚Äôm around 7600. I still do the daily challenges for more atoms. My goal is 10k
---
Hopefully they'll accept bottle caps and scrip.
---
i just carry around my exc, x01, and ultracite frames at all times
---
That is when they were targeting.... sometimes deadlines need to be extended for any number of reasons. They aren‚Äôt clairvoyant. They have their development timelines and sometimes things need to be delayed.
---
I was doing the same thing too. That‚Äôs why I asked. Because I want to cut that down to 1 ideally, but 2 at most.
---
He definitely duped them if he was selling them at a loss like that.
---
From my understanding of what they've said when explaining this whole thing, is that there will be a "realms" like option, which is probably the one referred to, they host the servers, you pay them.
---
But from my understanding you will also be able to download the server software and run it on your own server, which naturally also costs money to get, unless you already have one.
---
Have enjoyed playing with you friend!  Hope for more adventures. Love this game. I pour my heart and soul into whichever one I‚Äôm playing. Be it good or bad, it‚Äôs all about enjoying the adventure.
---
Meltdown is the second of the Vault 94 raids on rotation.
---
One of my best friends in game is both those people, all the time. Gives away legendaries to total strangers. He also picks fights with anyone he can(doesn't do workshop PvP often, but some.) Kill you and take your bag, then offer you anything he doesn't need back.  Then offer to mod your weapon, or just gives you a better one. Lol
---
From my understanding, as written in another thread what they might be referring to is a service like Minecraft realms, they host the servers you pay them.
---
But also from how they've previously explained it, you will also be able to get the server software and run it own your own server or computer.
---
Here's hoping.
---
Idk but I thought it was strange that he was on a trading sub offering them up. Most duper‚Äôs stay away from reddit because they get put on blast. The guy I bought them from might have gotten them from a super idk. However I have read that people got them as rewards on super rare occasions. Obviously not 10 of them so they definitely came from a super at some point!!!
---
It does, but don't you think it's a reasonable assumption that it wouldn't be accessible?
---
I bought it grinding because the fucking item is in my official guide I bought at launch. So it shouldve been in the base game before they decided to get greedy about it
---
I didn't purchase the utility of it. It literally collects bare amounts of scrap when compared to doing a 10 min scrap run. Though it is passive so I get that.
---
Point is player probably purchased it because it shouldve been part of the base game anyway
---
Im also curious about this
---
Bloodied wins against anything that takes more than one hit to kill.  Instigating otherwise, or if you aren't running a Bloodied build.
---
Bloodied Swing Speed anything is worth its weight in gold though.
---
IIRC X-01 has the highest RAD resist of the PA. You'll still likely want to couple it with Rad-X or better yet Radshield so it doesn't reduce mutations. Few perks can help as well (or a team mate sharing said perks).
---
I had three last night during one SBQ. Luckily I had my mule logged  at the legendary vendor so I could keep logging back into the same world.  
---
Well two disconnect and one crash to desktop.
---
This is kinda funny, how does this happen?
---
I thought there was no tenderizer plan.
---
I live i a shack sleeping bag in the mire what we need is the ability to build on more prebuilt locations
---
Also used to make White Russians
---
I agree. Stash your junk, and take a shot, what's the big deal? I still lose a lot, but not always. Get killed ,learn, get better. Half the guys ( or gals) who kill me will also give me advice on better PvP.
---
Make some rad shields... they help. Or share radsponge level 1 with a friend.
---
Postponing everything to 2020.
---
I'd need way more info than this tbh to get a solid idea on your build but I would never assume that VATS won't work. I've seen it track players thru things it shouldn't because the game can be buggy sometimes.
---
Solo Empath doesn't help. If you can craft the empath mutation, take it during the fight. This'll at least clear your 6% damage issue for an hour or so.
---
Depends on your playstyle but if you're heavy in Chameleon, Escape Artist and Sneak will work wonders. Otherwise, they can be changed depending on playstyle.
---
i did, asked for login and password and crashed during login load
---
I'd hope they'd be smart enough to do something like that. They would get major backlash if people pay for a month to not even be able to use it.
---
That happens when your charisma is being forced into that higher number to make it stick you need to force it a few points past what you actually need if that makes sence
---
Cool
---
 So my lack of a single gatling is just the universe hating me 
---
*cries in heavy gunner*
---
Well I must be on the wrong server everytime because I have not experienced that emote by anyone it's always fire away and be quick enough or miss out.  I didnt say I was ok with it. Look you ha e to approach it how the situation dictates if you have 2 people standing next to it firing away at it and not stepping back you have to fire at it. That's just the way it goes. Wow I must have rotten luck with Uranium Fever because every time there are people who don't care and will kill them within 3 seconds.
---
I used to run with raider armor up till like lvl 70 or so, now I use T-60 as a level 116. I find it's decent at keeping me alive.
---
I have the x01 and Ultracite ones but never use them because of the cost of maintaining them.
---
My endgame toon only suffers from cool legendary collection disorder, other than that my stash  maybe 2 or 3 hundred.
---
I‚Äôm good on everything but food, food is just annoying for me because I can‚Äôt be assed getting any. The only food I have rn is ionized meat. (I also have carnivore)
---
It opens you up for PVP at the workshop.  Nobody ever said the entire map.  Nobody.  Nice "reading comprehension" lol. 
---
It's telling that your side relies on name- calling 100% of the time.
---
Do you have any that are ‚Äúdestroyed‚Äù and awaiting repair?
---
Scout
---
I just use excavator honestly. I‚Äôm around Level 330 and it serves me just fine when I do need it which is really only to get flux. I've tried them all and also dumped them all but the good ole excavator. 
---
In my opinion... Overall, the excavator is the best. I bet everyone that comments on here still has their excavator armor. May not use it often but they never got rid of it. It's crucial for mining that lead. That is why I think it's the best.
---
A reply 4 months later? Did you go on the subreddit search bar and type in ‚Äúlevel 62 charred feral ghoul‚Äù like I did months ago? It‚Äôs an annoying glitch, I know. Not surprised Bethesda hasn‚Äôt managed to fix it though.
---
Thanks, but doesn't it require 9 CHR to share a level 3 card? My buddy is level 11. Is that not enough? Need 12 for the force maybe (thinking in triplets)?
---
Yes please allow us to get rid of the extra items so we don‚Äôt all become extra fat till the next day. Which sometimes makes us quit playing for that day to just be able to fast travel again. Thanks a million script.
---
Sorry your reading comp is so abysmal, it's totally been mentioned earlier in this post that some of the people on this post really do believe it's not griefing to kill someone for their workshop AND THEN follow them all over the map attacking them, so yeah, I was completely responding to what was said, pal.
---
And names get called when they apply. Don't like the name, don't perform the related activity. It's pretty simple. Whining about the name calling just gets you an extra name to be called, whiner.
---
Yeah, really messed up. I die at least two times trying to escape from the rad zone. It's just radaway and running.
---
For me, it's Elder Scrolls Online, it's been doing plenty of events lately!
---
Spend it wisely and not on something shitty and half baked
---
No, it's a container. Why would a container lose accessibility just because it's not powered? Power only makes it show up on the map.
---
Lucky!!!
---
It used to do that with my bloody character depending on his health level. Lower health equals higher charisma. Use a radaway or take damage, charisma changes constantly.
---
Ditto
---
Well today I got a bloodied explosive assault rifle. Also a 2* zealots bear arm (worthless but at least it‚Äôs a bear arm) and a vampires spear with swing speed. Nothing else memorable...
---
The green ones and pink ones.
---
Nothing good spawns on that event anyway.
---
For now
---
Can confirm. Unfortunate but love it - didn't even get it from a friend, just another random wastelander.
---
Huh...I've killed him a few dozen times. Damn thing keeps stalking me...and seeking vengence, just because I ate a few (dozen) of his eggs, but he's not really good at it.
---
I really wish that certain events, Uranium Fever in particular, could only be joined with specific weapon types, such as non-legendary pipe guns. Nothing else. That would keep the events accessible to all and give everyone an opportunity to tag legendary enemies.
---
It would be too easy to put your mat in a trap room to farm easy junk bags
---
I have no opinion on the fridge other than that they should charge more atoms for it.
---
Yeah, that could be bad
---
As that dude in "How to rip off your playerbase the best" already said: You make by far the most money by artificially creating problems, then selling the "convenience" to skip them. That's the only reason why things like repair kits exist. If they found that people hate that their weapons break every two shots, they could have just taken the weapon durability out of the game. Instead they opted to make some quick cash with it. And they'll do it for everything from now on. Food spoils too fast? What a shame, luckily we at Bethesda are generous enough to sell you a fridge for just slightly less money than a real fridge! Out of ressources? Need some plans? Getting your ass kicked? The atomic store has a solution to all of your problems!
---
It's sad, but stupid people buy it, and as long as it makes more money, who cares about what they promised about lines that other companies cross but they would never do, and about staying on the right side of things and all that bullcrap? 
---
Money is all that matters, and as long as ripping people off is more profitable than consumer good will, Bethesda is going to chose the former.
---
"Paragraph full of insults... I'm not attacking you."
---
Sweet story.  If you don't think calling people names like "douchebag" isn't personally attacking them, you should **learn what words mean.**
---
Lol. Let me get this straight:  the quote I asked for exists, ***but only if you extrapolate extra shit that wasn't in the quote?***  
---
That's adding shit that wasn't there rather than reading what the words that are ***actually*** there.   That's, dare I say it?   *Terrible reading comprehension*.
---
Photos of the leaders will be available on the Atom Shop for 500 atoms.
---
Came just to say this! Beat me to it.
---
I literally live in a extremely decorated rustic shack by the river in flatwoods and Everytime i log on a put on greenthumb and skip up and down the river getting what I need for healing salve. I've got a like all natural no chems (including stims) wildlife character. So shes got a good 1000+ healing salve and canned goods on her at all times. Can't wait for the bow so I can look like a badass in my hooded rags.
---
It was Pete Hines, if i recall.
---
He was seen hacking, wacking, and smacking.
---
I never use power armour but when I do it's always excavator with dual calibrated shocks. I become overweight in every other power armour and I only use power armour when mining
---
Thats what you get for picking a lock :p
---
Dude.  You called me an "idiot" and a "douchebag" in your ***very first comment to me.***  I didn't **talk to you**, or push you, **at all** before that comment.   
---
Hell, you were mad about something **someone else said.** Lol.  I mean,  really? 
---
Yeah.  Have a nice life.
---
My significant other asked me to play Nuclear Winter on her account so she could unlock the cosmetic rewards without having to play PVP. The best part of using her character is getting to wear the Nuka Girl suit in Nuclear Winter!
---
Some would argue power attack damage, but swing speed would be the overall concessive answer.
---
Its already been announced that TES6 will be on the same engine
---
Ridiculously, I've been overencumbered since sale started at the wrong end of the map and haven't made it to spend my scrip yet....
---
Personally I wish there weren't any non-cosmetic items in the Atom Shop at all.  
---
I'm just saying that at the very least, I would like it if Repair Kits weren't in the Atom Shop.
---
I always share what I have to lower levels üòéüëç I'm just level 251 but always help. Sometimes I follow and watch lower levels and make sure they don't get killed. There's been a few times I come in and save the day, pretty cool when it happens.
---
No more floating houses. But yes, we need new crap. Indeed.
---
Happened yesterday with my T60 and today with my T51. Don't be lazy, collect your power armor after exiting.
---
Don't have any in a blueprint, but I do on my second character, but they can still build 2 more
---
Apprentice earns about that yeah I think
---
Answering the strontium/ cesium question completely - I‚Äôm not really sure if the question asked is referring to these chemicals being released in a fallout/nuclear attack situation or if they are referring to the release of these chemicals trapped in soil through previous releases. While I‚Äôm not an expert on these chemicals I do know that no-till or minimum till practices will greatly reduce the amount of erosion, runoff and disturbance of soils which would cause these chemicals to get into water systems or be released into the atmosphere. Using the living mulch method of sustainable farms helps to build tons of organic matter into the soil profile deepening the topsoil further coming up any types of contamination that has been caused from previous Harvey metal deposits. My partner and I have proven this through rehabilitation of old mining properties with no topsoil and lots of contaminated soils full of heavy metals.
---
You can always join in on the fun on FB at Gunner‚Äôs Garage Bar and Grill. We will probably be open tomorrow around 2200 EST.
---
I made one there once. It‚Äôs too cramped inside. But, enjoy!
---
Indubitably
---
I had a 190scrip and got a furious explosive handmade lol
---
I think he was just throwing a random number
---
get a pipe revolver, put a long barrel and a rifle stock on it and you will earn kills toward both 'Kill robos with revolver' &amp; 'kill robos with rifle' at the same time. I didn't realize this myself till i was 800 rifle kills in (&amp; approx 100 revolver kills) If i'd known i'd be done with both, instead im done with rifle &amp; still have around 700 revolver kills to go. could have save myself a bunch of bullets and cashed in on those atoms a lot sooner...
---
Took a look at the Facebook page and wow this is why I love the Fallout 76 community. So creative, wholesome and welcoming.
---
^ This T60 is best for everyday use for ease of repair...
---
Lever action and handmade could be fun. That anti armor combat rifle could do well with the right build.
---
Alright, that actually makes a lot of sense. Thanks!
---
At the low price of 2,800 atoms
---
Well you‚Äôre welcome anytime (I‚Äôm on haha)
---
Interesting. My buddy is actually running a bloodied build. I will definitely bring this to his attention, thanks!
---
I bitched about this months ago. Still hasn't changed. Hopefully it's on the schedule.
---
Swing speed is by far the best 2nd star you can get for any melee weapon 99% of the time. The other 1% is if you've got an Instigating two-handed melee weapon, in which case +40% power attack damage is pretty dang good.
---
I was literally in this match. My teammate and I were really confused at first as to how we got killed, before we realised that he's a bloody hacker.
---
When you start a project of any time you never have any guarantee on when it‚Äôll be done. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter if that‚Äôs creating a video game overhaul, building a house, making a sweater, doesn‚Äôt matter. 
---
Sometimes it gets done faster than you expect. Sometimes slower. Sometimes on time. You don‚Äôt know until it happens.
---
Lol. "On schedule". Not exactly Bethesdas specialty.
---
I migrated to FO76 because FO4 is unplayable now for two years due to constant crashing.
---
This is awesome, makes me want them to make fallout LEGO
---
Good point. That may be a pretty great idea, especially if they adopted sale-tactics for the mode similar to that of Fortnite. To be blunt, I've never been interested in Fortnite, however, for whatever reason, I do enjoy playing a round or two of NW.  
---
If they did invest in your idea though, I'd hate to see all of Fallout 76 turn towards a Battle Royale though. I *love* the whole multiplayer-aspect of Fallout 76, and I was one of the people who absolutely adored the idea from the start.
---
So many momma jokes, so little time... But why would *I* be jealous?
---
Man eso celebrates the release of updates so we in party mode all the time xD
---
Because Bethesda will somehow make it glitch out
---
Yes! Yes! If they had a fitting room I would have seen this. To be honest it's not that bad on my main character but I have Alien Mothman I never remove so it does not matter for me really. I think it was 300 atom worth of atoms thrown in the wind.
---

---
/u/BethesdaGameStudios_ I heard something in the gaming news about Atom Shop update but in case that was old or not including fitting room. /u/Crymour here has the best idea, a fitting room for all the character items.
---
I found two pink today and have plenty of green. Ps4?
---
There was probably one guy.
---
I quit sharing perk cards on that character
---
I kinda feel betrayed right now.
---
You've played 7600 hours?
---
I already thought way ahead of that, I've got a garage door and when my caps are full, I'll be disconnecting power to both the Vendors and the door to prevent players buying stuff
---
Bethesda does still do a lot of things right imo but most people seem to only focus on what they have done wrong lately.
---
After reading your comment I realized you make a good point. Items like the Collectron are admittedly a good idea, because they're an overall unhelpful item that are a pretty neat CAMP addition. I never considered that, thanks.
---
I'd argue the fridge should not be in the Atom Shop though. Or that there should be some very difficult, but permanent, way of obtaining it in-game.
---
Not yet. I exclude that one because of its nature; you can't speed it up.
---
Huh, I've never heard that opinion before. Nice to get to know that it exists.
---
It's not like those items being transferred would ruin EVERYONE'S experience. If you see people with Dev room items just screenshot and report, pretty simple.
---
it's "playable" but not much content until next year, imho I don't think it's worth playing atm unless you're extremely bored.
---
I got a bloodied 10 mm pistol, which I'm thinking about just selling, but other than that nothing special so far. And I just did my second run in a row of whitesprings golf course with no legendaries so as someone who doesnt have max scrip I may be out of luck unless I can find more legendaries.
---
This is planned for Y2022Q3
---
Yes if that happens I will be like: Shut up and take my money! 
---
I have a female character just waiting for the Nuka Cola Girl outfit.
---
I‚Äôm glad people sell their less desirable legendaries instead of hoarding. I have got a bunch of new items during this event.
---
I deleted one on my current character that has the issue and it only went down by 1, so I have 2 phantom vendor machines, because I don't have any that need repaired
---
Bunkers, vertibirds, fast travel mats..... Where can i sign
---
I'd prefer a legacy bank that all characters have access to.
---
People are actually surprisingly fine with paying for private servers and I don't understand why, the game released in a really bad state and we barely get content. Now we have to pay probably monthly for servers that for sure should have already been in a 60$ game that also has microtransactions. It's actually ridiculous, we're being milked for money and people don't even realize it LMAOOO.
---
I know how you feel, like its gotta be far along enough that they could be testing it on say grahm. My bet is havent figured our the instances wiping your character.
---
Show me on the Mr. Fuzzy where Bethesda touched you. It's ok, it's not your fault.
---
Ill beat u up. No more atoms
---
I'd personally like to see the many other floors they have teased get released. Like the patio tiles and so on. There was also this really nice garden sink with a wide tub and two faucets that was teased (among other things).
---
I got like 6 black powder pistols and 3 revolvers XD.
---
Complaining again.
---
When they initially broke their promise you guys said it wasn't a big deal and anyone who was against it was just a youtuber trying to get views by spreading fo76 lies and propaganda (yeayongs)..And now we're here...there's a saying, give them an inch and they'll face rape you or something like that...
---
Are we going to act like Bethesda isn't a multi million dollar company? Lmao, this isn't some indie studio with barely any money, I'm also positive a fair amount of people buy atoms. We're being m i l k e d and people like you are sadly blind to it.
---
I didn't have room, my vendors are full
---
This is awesome! I feel the same way. About grinding levels or events maybe some legendary farming or just for much needed junk for aid/ammo. I‚Äôm down for some PvP every now and then. I‚Äôve dealt with all the BS this last year and still love this game. Still play it daily even if it‚Äôs for just 30 min to get some caps from the vendor. I have faith in the future of 76!
---
Not really sure. If they were dropped, they‚Äôd all be in a sack. Maybe it‚Äôs something about the item itself. I‚Äôve never seen it done with anything else.
---
I guess this is the same little trick used when people sometimes drop hundreds of bunny masks on the ground, or tons of plague doctor masks. Some sort of multi replicating trick it seems. Which lags everything out utterly.
---
Vagina monologues
---
I've spent 1300 so far and got absolutely nothing I'd want to keep. No two shots, no exploding, no junkie, and waaaaaay too many pipe weapons. Couldn't be more upset about my piss poor luck so far.
---
3 star drops from 3 star mobs below being able to view pip-boy while sitting? Who tf decides the order? Perhaps there should be a poll to determine the community‚Äôs order of importance, rather than whatever determined that order.
---
Youre best off doing the escavator questline, you get it for free if you craft the armor.
---
Only if you also have an atom store ferado
---
Alas YR a neckbeard
---
It‚Äôs only a 3rd effect
---
I love 76 for the world, and most people don‚Äôt understand that, and say that I‚Äôm stupid and it‚Äôs  the worst game ever, and I‚Äôm just happy to find someone who feels the same way
---
I think that's the first time I ever saw someone ask for crabs lol
---
Tse submachine gun, f/ffr Radium rifle
---
Hahaha I did the same thing. A little level 8 last year smashing something in a players camp because I needed wood to fix something. I became wanted and about 1 minute later power armor Jesus came in and clapped these cheeks.
---
It's both. 
---
The greek prefix may have been its origin, but modern gaming culture now uses it as an acronym.

Noone is debating the prefix.  But the prefix evolved just as language does.
---
In language, nothing is absolute.  It's based on culture, dialect, region, history, ect.
---
Like the word rubber.  It can be a substance made from tree sap.  Or a device used to remove pencil.  Or a contraceptive.
---
You realize because bethesda is owned by zenimax, zenimax has the final say on budget spending. All the profit that were being milked for isnt being out that into the game development. That's my point numb nuts
---
We shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for features that are common sense
---
I don't think the users asked for them to charge us for servers. Games that do make us pay for servers aren't 60$ with microtransactions or are very unstable. 76 on the other hand is all 3. I find this to be extremely greedy.
---
Like the (mostly) silent majority,  there‚Äôs a bunch of people praising it and I‚Äôm genuinely ticked off.
---
700 atoms please
---
Like a week before the sale went live I got a TSE minigun. Yesterday I got mostly revolvers. I should've pushed my luck lol.
---
Have you tried lowering the graphics settings? Playing on full screen mode?

I had one clown who was extremely persistent and slow to learn a lesson (maybe it was his ego). We were close in level so (he had three levels on me  73 vs 76) He took Poseidon from me but it was a close fight and he won mostly because i put too much faith in my shotty and forgot to keep track of my health till it was too late. Since the fight was close, he had his PA on and he jumped me when i was out of my PA ( i had just finished crafting at my workshop like an idiot) I decided to 'seek revenge'. Put my PA on and went to get my plant back. We then went toe-to-toe again but this time when he got too close (he was using some modded sledge) i pulled out the Blade of Bastet, went ginsu-knife mode on him and killed him. He came back and I killed him again. And again. And again. We danced 6 times and he only got me that 1st time. Finally i just left the server and let him have it. I know that's not really griefing (because i kept killing him) but it was annoying AF that he kept coming back. Guess his ego couldn't let it go that he was repeatedly getting killed by someone lower level than him.
---
omg someone online insulted me im going to cry!!! As you've said, everyone won't have the same opinion, my opinion is that we're being milked, and as a customer who spent 60$ on an unfinished game that also has microtransactions I'm not going to be buying servers nor do I support them. You ignorant fish dick.
---
Er, can you expand a little on that? Why did you?
---
I saw a link on here couple weeks ago with streamer lose theirs too.
---
I agree
---
Seen him twice in the wild and 2x while doing the lighthouse.
---
First encounter was in one of the scout camps, the one with the poles and walkways high up in the trees. Scared the crap out of me to suddenly see him perching on one of the poles. Responded - stupidly - by taking a potshot at him and he was gone.
---
Then not 2 weeks ago I'm in the mire and suddenly he attacks me out of the blue, while walking between sites. At least he had the dust on him.
---
I know. I just thought the low-ball number was funny. Like, how does this guy live?
---
Because it only works if we are at camp or selling items to the vendor. As soon as we go do something, as soon as I take damage it unequips the perk. Too much hassle honestly.
---
Everyone has a right to their opinion. I just hate to see someone badmouthing bethesda over something they cant control. You moronic cabbage crammer
---
Missed your note at the end of the post initially, Bethesda‚Äôs change of stance really has ticked me off.
---
Donation piggybank. If I like a camp, I can drop in a few caps as token of appreciation.
---
OR we can just say we did and take your money now-Todd Snake Howard
---
This would be great, much like before release of the base game. Their twitter I think, posted images of the different groups eg BOS, Raiders etc with a little description. Stuff like that would go a long way to keeping us interested.
---
We can acknowledge a game's flaws but still enjoy it. I hate how gaming has become an all or nothing situation. Either it's a masterpiece or worse than Hitler and if we like something that is considered bad then we are manipulated shills for the evil corporation.
---
I am enjoying my time with Fallout 76. Sure I fell off for a bit as other things caught my attention. But I'm back in and finally found a groove that keeps me coming back. It's not perfect by any means but few things are. With that said, I truly believe Appalachia is probably the second best Bethesda game world map, only to be beaten by Skyrim which was damn near flawless.

Furious Tesla and vampires minigun levels of enjoyment

---
How high are you right now?
---
Name Checks out*
---
In that case, both Bethesda and Zenimax are milking us. :) It's my opinion, I have a right to it. No need to hate my bad mouthing opinion. It still doesn't change the fact that this 60$ game with microtransactions is making us PAY (most likely MONTHLY) for something that probably should have been in the game at launch. If you can't see how very stupid this is then I'm surprised you can actually use a computer properly and I wish you luck with the rest of your life with such a small INT stat. üò¨ LMAO
---
The voices you see/hear online are not always representative of the silent player base that just goes on with their lives without all the drama online forums entail.
---
Either that or you can put on your tinfoil hat and say that Bethesda is lying (about the success of these p2w features) and just tries to monetize the game further by adding appealing content to people with money to spare.
---
Without having access to those (sales) numbers you won't be able to prove either way.
---
It depends on what you want to do. Combat armor is like the combat rifle: good for everything and you can mod it fairly early in the game. BoS mod comes strong and it will always be there. 
---
I like trapper because of the rads protection and leather for the Energy resistance at cheap prices. Wood Is the best for sneaking.
---
Scout and marine I don't like, because finding a good full set and mods can take some long time.
---
I do the same thing. Im only Lvl 83 but when i see some poor soul in their teens show up at my camp (in the divide) and then wander off east I will usually hop in the PA and tail them for a while so I can help when they get in over their heads (which usually doesn't take long. lol) Once they go back to the shallow end, if i wasn't already in the middle of something, i usually go back to my camp and craft the best version of whatever weapon they were using that i can, find them on the map, FT to them, give them the gun and at least 500rds, salute, and then fast travel away as soon as they pick up the bag.
---
You got $18 because I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be back for that price
---
So you know this game is currently "pay to win" and has been since the first legendary sale on ebay. You can easily buy any weapon or armor or rare items with cash.  People that think it was repair kits or collectrons, but nope. The only difference is who gets the money. Personally I'd rather give it to the developers, rather than dupers.

Cranberry Relish is easy. Plant some gourds, found in planters at Raleigh Clay's bunker. Use [this map](https://map76.com/plants/cranberry) for cranberries. I go to Mac's Farm or Creekside Sundew Grove.
---
Transparency isn‚Äôt ‚Äúright‚Äù, it‚Äôs expected. Don‚Äôt forget Bethesda has spent plenty of time creating and implementing utility item microtransactions. I‚Äôm sure the time spent ensuring their players never stop spending money could‚Äôve been used to work on actual content instead. If they could get away with fucking you over, they would. They exist to make money. Not to be your friend.
---
The Bloodied stuff would sell, although Western Revolvers lag behind pretty much every other firearm like that.
---
I mainly just want single player, cause the servers are terrible and so is my internet.
---
How come Bethesda still hasn't gotten around to fixing this?
---
Changes to public events where you automatically spawn at the edge of the event when you die.  Great for most events not so great for scorched earth
---
Thinking Bethesda cares about this game lmfao classic noob.
---
I mean, lol. This is exactly what I am talking about. personally though I am not particular a fan of this whole "they aren't your friend" mentality. When this is said I feel like it severely dehumanizes whatever company is in question. They are people just like us at the end of the day.
---
Yes, after shifting from bloody to junkie, I have switched back.
---
According to an earlier testing thread, the higher damage percentages are somewhat squared due to the effective reduction to dr.  He didn‚Äôt provide a specific formula, but apparently that‚Äôs how F4 works.
---
Thanks!
---
I've about lost track of my encounters with him. I've seen him the most times at Crevasse and on the outskirts of Whitesprings after it has been nuked. One of my best pics, is of the Mothman on a golf green over a skeleton with his wings folded over. I found him(or he found me) once outside of one of the Sundew Groves in the Cranberry Bog and got the other best photo of him I've got. 
---
The first time I found him was around the Top of The World, just walking around the cliffs and happened to see his red eyes peering out of the woods at me. But, this is the first time I've found the 'Stalking' Mothman, it's been the Vengeful Mothman for most of my encounters with him. 
---
And, of course the Landview Lighthouse with the Wise Mothman, seen him there twice. I've been entertaining a theory that I angered the Wise Mothman the second time since I did that event with two other players, who after the event started attacking the Wise Mothman, and I didn't try to stop them, and now the Mothman minions have my number and are hunting me. Well, and I don't imagine the Mothmen are very happy with how frequently I've been making omlettes with their eggs. 
---
 Lately, everytime I run into him it's a fight.
---
If i'm over matched i try and creep in and empty all my collectors. from what i think i read the more of the budget used the higher the cost to take a workshop. you could always build a bunch of bs around the workshop make it cost more caps than its worth so maybe they just move on to the next workshop.
---
This guy gets it
---
You can make metal railing from conduit. Since it floats it‚Äôs easy.  Looks great too.
---
Wow!  I've recently started on some of these myself.  Giving meself something to do while waiting for new content.
---
Yep, splash can kill you real good, real fast.
---
That looks great!! A lot like that method people use to photograph real life things and make it look like toys (tilt lens or something?)
---
Are you planning on running it automatic?
---
Meh I'v had this happen a few times.. usually from people who drop nukes in places they have no clue has no value to drop one there.. like watago itself.
---
Wow, he went on a crash diet!
---
What‚Äôs your build? Which weapons do you use? Low or high health?
---
I recommend using dense mod on your chest armor and Fireproof perk card.
---
I‚Äôve been playing since BETA launched for the PS4.
---
Forgot to mention that. Yes running commando but would like to have the option to stick with the rifles. I switch back and forth now based on what I‚Äôm doing. Rifles for sniping and general running around. Commando for big events like SQB, encrypted or PP.
---
Doesn't matter if they release it this year or the next it's still going to be a bethesda quality release without the community to fix the bugs for bethesda.
---
It‚Äôs the engine
---
I really live in your mind rent free aren't I? LMAO Dude you really are the works.
---
I was about to log out last night, popped down to Berkeley just to make sure my scrip didn‚Äôt reset, and a lvl 29 asked if I could help him launch a nuke. I think I‚Äôd just hit lvl 290, and briefly thought about telling him I was tired and about to log out. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt because it was fun, I hadn‚Äôt been in a silo on that character in forever, and we linked up again to do some questin‚Äô again today.
---
He‚Äôs close to lvl 40 now and I got a nice unyielding/ap/sneak arm off the queen.
---
His youthful enthusiasm also reminds me of why I liked the game in the first place, and it‚Äôs nice to have someone remind me that the game is more than upgrading and grinding higher and higher level equipment.
---
Some of us do have a problem I think, I get all excited when I earn 10 cents worth of atoms on a daily, when I doubt a lot of us would bend over on the street to pick up a dime.  Today I spent around 70 caps to get enough booze to drink for a daily, that's just silly (and now I gotta hope I have an Addictol in my stash when I play later).
---
Does this say anything about our psychology about this game?  I've spent lots of money over the years with microtransactions on iPad games, nothing major, a buck or three a month if that, but I'm too stingy to spend even $5 on this game yet, and I got it for half price in the first place -shrug-
---
I WISH I had friends in game. Then private servers would matter to me
---
Exact same thing happened to me today =( I feel yo pain beezy
---
2 things came to mind
---
1: if you want crabs, go to a strip club or bar or nightclub
---
2: CRAB RAVE
---
My first time, sneaking in The Mire at too low a level, I yelped out loud and ran like the blazes.  Today, level 44, little jerk waiting for me on top of some mountain in the Mire, I can go "oh you're asking for it now man" and pull out a shotgun to lay down some knowledge on his winged ass.  Love it!
---
I'd go with something like this. [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f245dc&amp;d=lt2an2ao0a30ar2a72ic1c72e60e00p02pp2sb2s01s71lv2ir2la2l12pg2ph2pi2&amp;w=lr2lk2&amp;m=0c29f815&amp;nw=&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f245dc&amp;d=lt2an2ao0a30ar2a72ic1c72e60e00p02pp2sb2s01s71lv2ir2la2l12pg2ph2pi2&amp;w=lr2lk2&amp;m=0c29f815&amp;nw=&amp;n=)
---
Ikr!! The battle with Mothman is easily the fun one
---
What's wrong with The Messenger? They fixed the AI pathing so Mr. Messenger rarely gets stuck anymore and it has a great loot pool in the higher level regions for an easy quest. I think it even awards legendaries in the Mire and Bog.
---
Bloodied players will be weeping tears of blood and turning the subreddit into endless whining and moaning if we try to take their broken builds away from them. Buffing the 'squatch might make it last long enough for other people to get hits in without breaking any fragile powergamer egos.
---
If I knew it can do this I was going to think about getting one.
---
One thing that would help slightly is, if you log off inside the Whitespring, log back in inside of it.  It's silly to waste your power cores in PA while in there stealing vases to sell back, but it is possible to crash sometimes in this game, believe it or not, and reconnecting being outside and unprepared will hurt.  So far it's only happened once to me but I luckily had kept the PA on for that trip out of laziness
---
Bethesda also said the atom shop would only contain cosmetics, let that sink in
---
There was an interesting tid bit in their last post about Wastelanders, you can clearly see a friendly ghoul in the back of one of the photos so it is nice to know that is confirmed
---
At this point it kinda is considering how cheap it is
---
DO YOU WANT ANTS, because THIS is how you get ANTS!
---
Yeah, I don't see why they just didn't introduce some annoying quest to get a mini fridge or cooler in the game while reserving the big fridges  for atom shop. You'd still get people buying without all the grief. Still though, there is already the fridge backpack which is arguably way more helpful than the fridge itself.
---
I feel like they plan for this game to exist for only a few more months, if Wastelanders flops (knowing Bethesda it probably will) they will jump ship and start capitalizing on Creation Club in 4 again
---
That's probably what they've got planned. 
---
I thought they were clearing out the shop for new wastelanders items, but it could be they're getting ready to do a BF sale after Thanksgiving (hopefully at more than the usual 30-40% off)
---
Aaaaand... The club is OPEN!
---
Hit me up on Xbox.  GT: Kuriakon
---
Don‚Äôt go in there if you are not ready

I've been playing since beta, but the game has actually degraded over time. It used to be there were places you could go to farm legendaries without an event. Not anymore. Whitesprings and Robco and other places are empty - because there is no reason to go there. They tinkered with the events when they added public events, or it may have even been before that but now uranium fever and one violent night are rare. For the last 2-3 weeks I server hop looking for something to do but it has really become boring. Players I relied on to keep the nukes flying are no longer playing (vampirex for example) probably because what appears to be a concerted effort by Bethesda to make the game boring. No one does vault 94. No one plays project paradise. Most events do not award legendaries so are of no interest to players level 100+. 
---
The kicker was the announcement yesterday. I've been waiting for Wastelanders to save the game. Instead they are going to let you pay to host a server. If that server is governed by the same boring rules I see no appeal at all. And they are going to add game effecting things to the atomic shop. Wastelanders will be in Q1. Pretty sure there will be no one playing at all by then.
---
The game is dead.
---
Cripple the alpha's legs to paralyze it, it can't attack the friendly animals and everyone can get a hit in.
---
I think Sheepsquatches can still headbutt you if you get in melee range, but everything except Mirelurk Queens become more or less completely helpless if you cripple both legs.
---
It also comes with a version with the American flag painted all over it for additional FREEDOM STRENGTH!
---
(Sadly no throwing mini nukes or eye lasers though...)
---
How‚Äôs that leather taste? Bethesda is just selling features that should have been available at launch, **AGAIN**
---
I have lost PA sets in the past, so I stopped collecting.  :(  I guess they are still having trouble with this mechanic.
---
There are some side benefits to getting higher level - trying to farm Scorched for challenges, I went to the airport with a sword, and calmly walked to them while they shot at me, like the Terminator, and just slashed them.
---
I don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt but things in the game are a little weird like that sometimes. For example I bet a marine chest armor that had -50% fall damage so I threw on goatlegs level 2 technically giving me -100% fall damage but I still took damage after jumping off of cliffs and stuff so it‚Äôs in the air. Put a silencer on your gauss rifle though for better stealth
---
^this. It just feels tacky and low res to me, I try to put those atom shop rugs over it, but those can only be placed so close to the wall
---
I've had major framerate drops similar to this(an fr drop to a completely unplayable amount) on xbox as well. It may just be a  bethesda issue and not your system.
---
I have a high level instigating Gauss rifle and rifleman perks. You hit hard, but depending on the enemy DR  you Will cause less/More damage. You Will have hits for 85 and hits for 1800.
---
You don't see how? Okay. You're the fabled Fallout 76 defender.
---
I'm out.
---
Lol at renting a single player game that you already purchased.
---
Herd Mentality is totally broken with card sharing. You can just forget about those two points that it gives. I have a character that has exactly 9 charisma with Herd Mentality. I cannot get a rank 3 card to stay shared until I get my charisma up to 11.
---
With bloodied, any time your health crosses a line where your charisma changes up or down, you will lose the card. I couldn't figure this out until I installed the UI mod that shows your health bar with percentage indicators (20, 40, 60, 80). Any time my health crosses one of those lines my cards unshare even if I still have enough charisma.
---
I know, but it isn't anymore for some reason
---
Thanks for the story it made me laugh! Next time, log out and in again, this resets their aggro. 
---
Also, those robots make excellent meat shields (or circuit shields?), tag some ghoulies and then run and hide behind them!
---
If you dont like it dont play it, but dont act like people who like it are shills, but even im not sure whether op likes it or is being sarcastic.
---
The game. I'm running Intel/NVDA over here and using a bloodied ffr laster (not explosive) with beam splitter in pvp causes my fps to drop or the game to freeze. It will also freeze anybody around me.
---
&gt;It wasn't RNG, caps or atoms that got them that piece, it was their skill at the game.
---
Or, you know, cheats. Especially on PC.
---
Incisor is a must, once you have it you can get rid of other ap effects because ap don't stack well, get more raw damage instead.
---
As for martial artist, unless your damage perks are not maxed you might not have space for it.
---
3 incisor 3+3+3 slugger 3 blocker/martial artist/qol perks
---
If not maxed : 3 incisor 1+1+1 slugger 3 blocker 3 martial artist 3 anything
---
Unless you are using a bloodied build, there is no such thing as overkilling.
---
You might be terribly right. Really.
---
counterpoint is that your display may have been glitching out. I see that happen sometimes visiting people‚Äôs bases
---
Would be a good idea.   Alot of people were on and off over the year and didnt know about alot.  They also may want to keep it exclusive so people know who was always playing.

---
‚ÄúThat can be completed‚Äù
---
7600 hours cannot feasibly be completed.
---
I had that back when I was Lv10.
---
Must have been a month after the game dropped and I eventually RQ as it would not stop spawning me at the same spot.
---
I've had this happen a few times, but always leaving the world and joining another fixes it. it's persisting even after changing worlds?
---
You guys might enjoy Kenshi, just saying.
---
Make sure that in your Nvidia game settings for Fallout 76 in your Nvidia control panel, you have Performance for the Power Use Setting and Fast in your V-sync setting.
---
Makes a difference.
---
I'm running similar specs except for an RTX 2070 and a 32" 4k monitor. I never fall below about 56 FPS or so.
---
Appreciate it :3
---
Also, that name has been tainted yes. No association whatsoever xD I've been using this Ign since 2011 and it's stuck ever since.
---
But you cannot kill them unless they attack you lol
---
because 100% of the PC playerbase are hackers. LMAOOO üòÇ I can't believe there are people like you on here, it's mind boggling. dude you gave me an amazing laugh, have a good one.
---
Btw get your dense mod and radshield ready so you don't die like this haha
---
Good! To many sooks have changed this game for the worst since the start with Bethesda listening to the wrong player base. Private servers with ruin the game economy so I'm glad
---
It's just the nuke mine. You dont have to be aggro on someone to give them rads from the mine. Had some try to kill my bloodied build the other day while I was in a vendor.
---
Shit embarrassing dude... who goes thru that much effort. Thirsty for attention
---
Rip
---
Sad, you might want to use the full gamer tag on everything like the video title.
---
You have to get shot by the stringer for it to work fast. It took my actual health away not just gave me rads. I don‚Äôt remember what each mod does on roses syringer so I can‚Äôt say which one.
---
Nah, I think if anyone would do it, it'd be for the fun, not for the attention. Like trap bases lol
---
You're putting words in my mouth because you cant argue with what I've actually said. You have a good one as well.
---
Have you found another game yet that will let you ride your high horse?
---
like r/Yumi636 said there are exeptions its not totally absurd for servers to be free i don't have much experience when i comes to the whole private server thing i just thought with survival dying it would make sense to make it  free
---
Ahh. Well I mean they dont have to have the syringer. Nuke mines in duo's can output a lot of rads. Js. Always be aware of your fellow players.
---
I don‚Äôt support griefing in anyway. You you want to pvp that‚Äôs cool but constantly killing people with a shitty bug is lame imo. Says a lot about someone. Maybe if it was 1 guy it MIGHT be different but the fact that there‚Äôs 4 makes it even more cringe.
---
Like have us respawn ON the queen
---
I'd say Swing Speed. If you reflect any damage before your first attack you've just wasted the Instigating.
---
Maybe they didn‚Äôt think it through, didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd actually get them, or they think they deserve free private servers just because.
---
If yr watch is painful try moving out of yr moms house!
---
You have to kill 1000+ robots using a specific weapon. For killing 76 scorced with a specific weapon, I got 40-80 atoms, too. But for robots, I have to kill 1000+ of them.
---
I am a lvl 313 and I still don't know how to maximize my perk cards or what I am lol
---
Thanks for being respectful while also informing me a bit on how servers work as i said in a different reply i misunderstood what private server meant i thought it was a server private to only yourself and nobody else 
---
again thanks for being respectful unlike the some here have a upvote have a good one.
---
Lmao was about to type this
---
I wish they had put John Denver‚Äôs version of country roads in the game initially
---
Well obviously now that I KNOW what they are doing lol. But at first I‚Äôm like, wtf was that!? He shot me with the syringer and by the time I could even aim the mine was going off the in 2 seconds I was dead! All you have to do is keep jumping if all else fails
---
A simple relog would‚Äôve killed the aggro.
---
Come back. We miss you.
---
Yea well unfortunately I just told them how to take it to a new level! Lol. I‚Äôll see if I can record my the clip with my phone and tag it on here.
---
Lmao sound fun
---
Be very specific. Exactly what type of rifle?  Legendary? Handmade, combat, AR?  What armor do you have?
---
A build is basically how you pick your perk cards, mutations and even weapons and armor to specialize your character to play a certain way. You can focus on weapon type (heavy guns, rifles, pistols etc) and also whether you want a character who keeps health high or low to access certain benefits.
---
People are filling in the massive gaps in information about private servers with their own imagination.  I guess they are expecting servers to have a god mode where you can write you own weapons or give yourself a million caps, in spite of no indication it will work this way.
---
I‚Äôm guessing we‚Äôll get a few options as sliders or choices and we can set base rules for things on the server, and then we can bring our own character to said server and just play the game.  Hell I could be wrong but there‚Äôs no way anyone can expect to interact with a full private server editor on their main character then bring it back to a normal server.  That‚Äôs crazy.
---
i never thought about it like that, you‚Äôre right
---
I want to know how you got Sludge Lung to register!
---
Add-ons should cross over.
---
I plant a carrot on a bolder, weird bushes, small trees, and they disappear.
---
I mean I was really curious about it and wanted to fight legit but they wouldn‚Äôt fight fair... lames. Now if you walked up to a random person and just did it while they were standing there and then dipped off, that might be comical. But to sit at a train station for 45 minutes griefing every person at the vendor or something is pretty strange. I guess people are that bored at this point with content!?
---
yeah that's what i thought but if thats what he actually meant then wouldn't that ruin the economy anyway?
---
ugh my brain hurts trying to rack my head around this.
---
What gave you that impression?
---
Yea the lack of content is real
---
Son of a bitch killed me at a low level , I got the prick when he was a friendly and not. He hid for a long time and when I got my hands on the fucker. I unleashed!
---
i don't know i was just under the impression it would be free based on the fact they killed survival before putting it in
---
Well I think you can still take rads but the syringer wouldn‚Äôt effect the you. Idk tbh. I just put it back on just in case!
---
Is your budget maxed out? Display items eat stash space -and- camp budget
---
Same way weight does, they throw a dart at the official Dev dartboard
---
This was my old camp.
---
With the armor, weapon and cooking benches already there, just add your PA, tinker and chemist benches and you're sorted.
---
Plus you have a mod/plan spawn point on the table in the top shack.
---
I had space for four shops and placed my fusion generator on the roof.
---
I've been tempted to move back there.
---
firstly bethesda would not go bankrupt if they made it free there a multi million dollar company 
---
not only that but the player base was an estimated 409k 9 months ago but to be generous we will add another 200k even though that's severely unrealistic since the game has been dying for a good time now. that's
---
 still only 600k so millions? not so much and lastly i was under the impression if they could make public servers it would not be hard to make private server flawed i know and many people have corrected me since and now i'm informed.
---
Only weapons that work on it are the shovel
---
As would us all
---
Because I thought I would just be able to host it on my in-house server like I do for a dozen other games.
---
Bummer.
---
That might be what the datamined mailboxes are for, if they ever come
---
an honest, simple fix would be fore them to add in an option to "respawn at vault 76" prior to load in if you die 5 within 30 minutes.
---
Right now i am outside watoga vendor afking to block it from a guy who stole my junk after i saw another guy die and him go for the junk. I tried to stand on it so he couldn't take it but a ghoul got me. Then he got both loots. 
---
Its been 5 minutes now and hes still waiting for me to leave the vendor. Its small, but it is some vengence
---
I am buying as soon as he tps
---
I got room just wish we had more
---
It took me until I was lvl 50-60 to finally see him, I took some screenshots then left without attacking and haven't seen him since.
---
Radical solution: If you can't make customisation appealing - remove your shop entirely - you don't deserve it
---
:DDDD
---
I remember one friend buying me the game for my birthday, and another helping me out with a new-to-me-PC, so we could (as West Virginians and lifelong chums) play together for the first time since the original Diablo.
---
I remember them telling me:
---
‚ÄòSince you‚Äôve never played a Bethesda game until after it‚Äôd been out for years (all The Elder Scrolls, Fallout 3 and New Vegas), prepare for frustration.‚Äô
---
I laughed.
---
They laughed.
---
They stopped laughing and stared at me with dead, humorless eyes...
---
[reminisces]
---
And today at the Purveyor, I got a Furious cane.
---
[too real]
---
But I love the game, helping n00bs, meeting good people, and spreading some knowledge about WV, the locations and history. I met great people from Georgia, Germany, Canada, New Jersey/York, and I can‚Äôt remember where else!
---
But! Damn... I wish my 1300 at the Purveyor had given me anything close to something I‚Äôd use the past 2 days.
---
[sigh]
---
Personally I was just expecting them to simply go the GTA Online route where you can be in a friend/crew only lobby.
---
Allow us to host our own... Allow us to do peer to peer like basically every other game in the world
---
Yep can even stagger 3 in a chain link style around each of the 3 ideal places. Great for flux farming and still enough area to fight and not respawn in the zone
---
I've seen that happen once and though it was pretty neat
---
I know how etymology works, thanks. 
---
The use of the Greek meta hasnt changed in this case. It still retains it's essential meaning, without being converted into 4 different words in a bacronym. 
---
In your example, rubber maintains it's essential meaning as it's use evolves over time. The material itself, two things that can be made out of the material, and in the case of the eraser, probably also a reference to the verb "rub". 
---
What you are suggesting is akin to suggesting the word taco, meaning a handheld food item in a folded tortilla, is an acronym that stands for "Tortilla Around Cuisine Object".
---
Language doesn't evolve that way. We don't take words that have meaning, and then turn them into acronyms that define themselves. Because that's dumb.
---
Clearly, people didn't know what meta was but had a general idea thanks to context, so they bacronymed it.
---
Shill isn't the right word, you're thinking of troll.
---
Maybe you have atom shop paint on it.
---
"We listened to the 1% because we are a greedy corporation."
---
Yeah - I'd keep the 2 bloodied items. 
---
 I noticed a couple of other weapons with 250dr which is a bugged modifier.  So they are basically no good.
---
And yet you took the effort to reply, giving them some small satisfaction.
---
How odd.
---
GTA also has very shady practices revolving their online currency where the vehicles do alot of unbalanced things but just make the game very grindy, they totally depend on whales.
---
It's still going to be buggy.  Them delaying it just sends the message there are some serious bugs that would make it unplayable if they released it now.  They're not delaying it because it needs more polish, they're delaying it because it needs to be playable.
---
I just picked two up from a player vendor and I can‚Äôt see them either :(
---
LMAO
---
You‚Äôd think that you could just hold a meat hook, or simply unscrew the hand assembly and replace it with a power fist. If you can shoot a pistol in power armor, you should certainly be able to manipulate a gauntlet. From a mechanical perspective, it‚Äôs nonsensical. 
---
On the other hand, you‚Äôd lose half the build by replacing a full unyielding suit with a basic suit of PA with a protocol torso. 15+ extra STR and AG is nothing to sneeze at. Neither is the 3x damage from a sneak attack. Good luck stealth killing consistently with power armor and only 15 AG. (Before you ask, the stealth boy torso is worthless, broken junk)
---
I guess it would open up more possibilities for full health junkie or maybe instigating builds, but a full heavy Vanguard suit is going to offer better DR than PA, anyways....and you can probably still stay hidden pretty well with full tertiary sneak effects. The only benefit PA provides that a high end legendary suit can‚Äôt is heavy rad resistance.
---
well i usually never go over 4 charisma so thats why i dont bother with them but if i had the points i would put them to good use too :D
---
So yeah, I just looked at them and now every lever rifle I have has the skin on it by default. I just made two and They had the paint. Wtf.
---
so i logged in this morning..got placed on the same server 6 times in a row..then 3 times wouldn't place my camp even though i'm not in a popular area,then got disconnected from the server twice..not to mention this prickett fort audio glitch that still hasn't been patched and its only 6am UK time here,add to this wastelanders dlc being delayed indefinitely it's basically left me with nothing to do other than quit this annoying game/timesink..i'd happily pay a monthly fee if it meant less server issues/glitches/breakdancing ghouls at whitesprings but i seriously doubt bugthesda will ever address these things.
---
well there you go That reply was what was going through my head its pretty late so i'm not thinking very clearly i'm just your average guy i'm no expert so acting like its common knowledge is kinda unfair 
---
second i know its kinda nit picky but its in the xbox's top 35th not 10 with only 447 players currently so i don't know where your getting your numbers if you can link your source that would be awesome 
---
and finally 409k nine months ago on a dying game add those PC numbers and i doubt its actually millions it might just barely make a million but i doubt it 
---
&gt; In the case of Fallout 76, 33.764 players completed the Photo Bomber trophy, which can be seen as¬†8,3 per cent of the player base once you log in to PSN. This is enough info to calculate that 100 per cent of the player base would be 406.795. Considering this is just the PS4 player count, which is usually the biggest one between PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, it is hard to imagine Fallout 76 managed to sell a million copies overall, let alone more. 
---
and that's not all we can't guarantee every single person is even still playing because like i said the player base is dwindling and its not getting much praise so its probably not raising by much
---
If still wondering about the junk prices. Not 100% sure but the ones in this list may be a bit low. It's just I don't see the just worth the caps. Moving stuff fast is also a goal...
---
Something I'm currently testing is to sell the junk raw, no bulk, to skip the 2 plastic needed to bulk them. I would also recommend to copy the sheet and make it for your prices. You will see when you play more and more how you kind of get some materials more than others until you change your playing habits or the CAMP location.
---
Those are my prices: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RhISeyqJZiT6ruxFvNJdHjHAJPjw4FfrDk3ttnyJXck/edit?usp=drive\_web&amp;ouid=112363891119875718018](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RhISeyqJZiT6ruxFvNJdHjHAJPjw4FfrDk3ttnyJXck/edit?usp=drive_web&amp;ouid=112363891119875718018)
---
no thats not the reason i never lose mine because of that
---
Trash.
---
Because I can be.
---
Lmao! Vengeance is a dish best served... eventually.
---
Yeah, dude. Mire is awesome!! I have all 4 of my characters there, different spots, too
---
Well I imagine they wouldn‚Äôt do that particular event because it will be happening in spring. But I wish they would do something interesting to occupy our time. That news was a major let down for me. The Halloween event might be cool tho.
---
Not enjoying it so far.
---
 I stopped by a player vendor's camp on my way to the sale and he was selling 3\* ranged weapons at 1000 caps each. I bought a  AA FFR 50 cal ( 3\* ) and then went to the purveyor and rolled exactly the same weapon !!?!
---
All my other rolls have been put back in the scrapper.
---
Damnit, thought I had something then.
---
Yea I‚Äôve done it everytime it‚Äôs ever popped up for me with a success of 99 percent of the time and have never got it! I had to just pony up and buy the damn thing!
---
Also does anyone know if you have a certain paet say a mirelurk king and i live at the whitespring course across from 4 other mirelurks that spawn infinately will he not fight them cause there his own species? Just happened they attacked me and not him and he just watched or was it just a glitch? If not hes the perfect pet if they wont attack him
---
Personally I find their story awfully lame. I get they make since considering there is no way they could reproduce so they would die out before the other games but how cool would it be that global atomic fire revealed a secret mole society that worships the interloper and used the global chaos to try and seize the world to be much cooler, there could even be a main faction campaign to snuff them out.
---
well im not sure about that but i do know 100% that scortched wont attack my mules scortched deathclaw
---
If you build for stealth, gear your character well and use your perks wisely, the times that you‚Äôre in trouble as a bloody gauntlet character are few. 
---
You can eat a few shots with the combo of Serendipity, Dodgy and Blocker perks. Add in sentinel armor effects and damage mitigation is even easier. I personally opted for a 3/2 split of harder to detect and cavalier, because I‚Äôd rather just not be spotted at all. Molerats and Radscorpions are omniscient once they burrow, and they tell all their friends about you, so two cavalier pieces are nice to have when you need to run towards every hostile in the area and punch off heads. A stealth boy is also handy for when the SBQ lands on the opposite side of the field from you. Caution is better than danger.
---
It‚Äôs a min/max, moderately gear intensive build, so it‚Äôs definitely not for everyone. A suit of T-51b and a super sledge or gatling gun will also make enemies just as dead.
---
The only disadvantage I see with a war drum (IMHO) is that they weigh approx 20 lbs. 
---
Though I would probably keep a Bloodied one.
---
I was thinking it would be free too
---
Congrats on your achievement! Now that you got all those free Atoms and wasted them on useless stuff that doesn‚Äôt work properly (Mr. Fuzzy Ride, Refrigerator etc.), the only way to get more Atoms will be to pay for them. And do the boring weekly challenges, when they are not bugged (which is never, they are bugged every week).
---
This happened to me at morgantown.  Fortunately i have the rad suit which gave me time to put on power armor and radx and radaway.
---
Sometimes when I switch to a different character it will come with this issue, its whacky man...
---
The lone wanderer is best left, on their own doing their own things. Who would have thought?
---
Well it is completely random. I get generally get 2 2* drops off her even tho I‚Äôve heard of people getting 3* drops. I do it for the scrip really.
---
Bethesda crapping the bed this time.
---
Good to know.
---
Had that too, I was trying to run out of the nuking zone but kept dying. I almost broke my controller bec of thatüòÇüòÇ
---
The game is designed to break you from caring about hoarding. Think about it.
---
This needs to be fixed. I spent my hard earned money and they just get to say "oops" and not fix this ? Bullshit
---
build the personal terminal in your camp it will lead you to the tourist
---
I don‚Äôt expect private servers to be free but if I‚Äôm paying, I expect them to be LAG FREE. So fingers crossed for a pleasant surprise
---
First time a nuke launched on me at whitesprings I hid in the little blue nuclear protection shelter. Always thought they looked cheap and found out that day  just how cheap they really are.
---
Didn‚Äôt even need plans for anything back then. The camp was bugged and everything was available.
---
Reading these comments like Air B&amp;B reviews, might just check this place out lol
---
You could max out SPECIAL and all skills and get all of the good perks in Fallout 3. You could be great at everything. You could become competent at everything even without planning. The same was true for NV, if I‚Äôm not mistaken.
---
Also, about swapping out perk cards: That‚Äôs what I said. You can only be good at one thing *at a time*.
---
Honestly, this is what FO76 players deserve until they learn to recognize when they're being fleeced.
---
Ones spawns near the waterpark spawn point
---
Piss off
---
Are you going to keep a log of this comment and tell me like it is?
---
Just mixes it up a little. Would be sweet if he SBQ would come out of any nuked fissure.. would give some variety!
---
**CHALLENGES, ATOMS, THE ATOMIC SHOP, AND YOU**
---
"Our approach to these items at launch was to keep them **purely cosmetic**. But after looking at all the data, it became clear that to consistently deliver content that keeps Fallout 76 fresh and exciting for all, we needed to rethink our approach to the Atomic Shop." - [link](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
seems pretty clear that, just as Pete Hines once stated in a reply to a tweet (a pretty straight forward statement, mind you), it **was** cosmetic only
---
If gauntlets hit any harder in power armor than they do without, Bethesda would have a hard time providing any challenge in PvE.
---
A good bloody gauntlet build can kill a lvl 80 sheepsquatch or scorchbeast in one punch. The Impostor can be cut down in about 30 seconds if you attack her while a teammate grabs the pylons and holds her aggro.
---
I think the whole idea of unarmed was a high risk/reward build, which is probably why power armor was excluded. You do need some moderately good legendary equipment to get an unarmed build to start performing well.
---
I think Bethesda is smart enough to realize they can‚Äôt just delay the one update that was keeping the buzz about the game alive and then not driver any content. I think they‚Äôre likely to incorporate more seasonal events and maybe even move up some of the other updates the the legendary/prestige player system and hopefully some more weapons and mods. As long as they keep the food the good stuff out of the Atomic Shop I‚Äôll be happy to stick around until Wastelanders rolls out.
---
76 isn't much more complicated than games like Miscreated, 7 Days to Die, Conan Exiles, if at all more complicated. Also maybe I am reading you wrong because how it is worded, but PUBG isn't peer to peer nor do they have privately hosted dedicated servers so I am not sure why the comparison.
---
Nonetheless, paid private servers also makes me feel like modding will have less freedom. Likely to be behind a money wall as well.
---
Fair amount. 20-30k depending on buyer or a decent trade your looking for
---
This is good advice.
---
If your on xbox I'm interested in that bloodied western revolver. :)
---
Thank you made some changes to my set up and WOW!!! I really can‚Äôt believe the damage difference even on my non bloodied weapons. I just have to get use to being so low on health.
---
BOOM! Headshot.
---
I agree. The frustration from trying to complete bugged challenges, trying to do PvP or grinding the same spots for slightly better gear is not really my thing. I enjoy growing stuff, building elaborate CAMPs at cool locations and exploring. Player Vending was the best addition to the game, even though it was advertised and should‚Äôve been in the game at release.
---
I‚Äôve been doing it on all my toons every chance I get just for the chance of causal shielded plans.
---
You were, most of us were. The line they said they wouldn't cross, they did.
---
Just tried it for the first time in over a month again. My teammate was definitely a hacker. As soon as a single pixel of someone showed up he had them down. Was nice that he was on my team at least I guess..?
---
there‚Äôs nothing on there that says anything about a tourist or camera. is it ‚Äúinvestigate the suspicious person?
---
My number one vend. I grind a couple times a week making disease cure and healing salve, the healing salve I sell to the train stations, I sell the disease cure for 9 caps,pretty good turnover for those that don't want to waste their time...
---
And let the filthy casuals in? I think not!
---
This filthy casual has caps to spend damnit lol
---
theyre probably at or near cap limit
---
Pistols and SMGs need some love, they‚Äôre just not as viable as some of the other weapons like the Handmade or Combat Rifles. Would love for the 10mm SMG to get a suppressor and maybe at a front sight. Also think it would be easy and fun to add in an Atomic Shop reskin for the 10mm pistol that looks like the Deliver from Fallout 4.
---
I suppose so, I just unplug my machines....seems a lot easier lol
---
Glad to hear it's working for you. Diluted stims help for spamming in dicey situations as well as chems that reduce damage when fighting the SBQ and Imposter.
---
you can fast travel to a friend if they are in the nuke zone
---
Well, the curator just found another unburied body, you should come and get it. Lots of love, Grafton's Mayor.
---
(I used to wonder about the problem people were having with the Mayor, since it didn't happen to me at all. Then I went to the scout place to finish off a badge, and ever since then...)
---
Adding T-51 defense with an emergency protocol torso on top of fast swinging four figure damage seems unbalanced to me. You‚Äôre talking about bloody explosive plasma gatling levels of carnage available for everyone. They‚Äôd have to give the SBQ a couple million more hp in order for her to live long enough to fully emerge from the fissure.
---
Make the T-51 suit a strangler heart suit and it would be even more absurd.
---
if people find your camp they can still buy from an unpowered vending machine.
---
Ya I think my first queen fight with this build is going to be a real learning curve. At least I think I‚Äôll have a few days to get use to this low health stuff before queens start showing up again. I think to many people are over encumbered to jump into a queen fight.
---
PC sorry
---
Whaaaat?! Seriously? Glad I asked them, damn. Lol
---
Didn't power armor fully protect us from RADs in fallout 4?
---
Given that raider PA is so weak compared to other suits, that could actually open up a pretty cool build. It probably would never be as strong as a bloody stealth gauntlet build or a T-51 vampiric buzzblade tank, but it could be a solid, easy build for more casually oriented players.
---
If it has a paint job, remove it.
---
Yeah. Most of us are lugging around a pile of junk legendary gear. I always pop diluted radx before. Radshield is better if you have it. Pyschotats and Overdrive work great as well as any other vats or sneak related chems. The damage doesn't stack from each but you still get the other perks. Ballistic Bock is also useful but it's best to have a repair kit in case the weapon breaks.
---
Not fun aye
---
Yeah, that was patched ages ago. Like early spring. I totally forgot about that.
---
yes
---
All good
---
I moved my hunter up to the southernmost mountain in the divide for awhile for some alone time and a good view, but I‚Äôm ready to get back to my roots!
---
Pyschotats is my chem of choice and nuke cherrys for the ap refresh.
---
Ha you‚Äôd think right
---
Exactly. Wtf is going on? I would believe this more if we trolled Bethesda into thinking thats what we wanted. 
---
The PVP is still broke. Players using armor that you can‚Äôt lock into , throws up all zeros when you attack them, one hit from them you‚Äôre dead and this is how they spend their time ?
---
I want to engage in combat. Not who strikes first one shot dead. 
---
Then who would want a private server ? 
---
Soo many other possibilities of ways to improve but this is the worst idea ever
---
I've seen that if you get the same legendary prefixes in different weapons 2 to 3 times in a row the best thing to do is changing to a new server. You'll get different kind of weapon with different prefixes.
---
Yeah for real
---
Stopped going to them, never get anything that I would want.
---
Public servers are laggy. Private servers mean you can take over all the workshops indefinitely. Previously, modders did what they did for free and for love of the lore. Now, there is no love for it as it's sold. You're not part of the community that loves fallout. You're the community willing to sell it off.
---
Excavator, I'm a pack rat.
---
You can get some crazy damage with the right chems and setup. I'm hoping to try some new toys on the SBQ soon.
---
I saw one where the door was locked and player was crouched inside. A trap?
---
I got 3 flamers... 3.
---
I'm going to be annoyed if paid private servers come before FUCKING TEXT CHAT.
---
Maybe I have low standards, but when I can kill a scorchbeast in one punch with a power fist I consider that weapon to be more than satisfactory. Adding power armor defense to that seems just a little over the top.
---
Absofucking loooootly. They cant keep up. Just finished my lvl 50 gunslinger girl and she is struggling to evem do enough to get credit for queen. The perks need condencing, faster reload perk needs to be created to stack with auto reload and damage needs to do extra bonus on headshots. 
---
Im still working on getting her bloodied since all the agility for stealth but one day...
---
I don't believe Power Armor preventing unarmed weapons is an intentional power balance at all.  It simply persists because Bethesda ripped most of Fallout 4's mechanics.
---
The real reason unarmed weapons don't work in power armor is probably because they'd clip in both first and person, and rather than try to make them fit visually, they just took the shortcut and avoided having them for power armor. 
---
 I don't think it has anything to do with balance whatsoever, though it's a compelling argument, but you could probably also make a good case for unarmed/melee just being way too powerful under special circumstances compared to anything else.
---
I carry a pistol on my T-51 slugger (mainly for gun runner movement speed boost) and an SMG on my gauntlet character as a backup option. There‚Äôs enough times that a scorchbeast won‚Äôt land, an enemy is annoying you from a ledge, or you need to tag a legendary from far away to justify carrying a gun and a couple thousand rounds to go with it.
---
When chat comes to FO76 it will quickly turn into eso zone chat. Players eather spamming crap on it or posting items forsale.
---
i agree with you, atom shop should only contain decorative stuff
---
Interesting. I'll keep some of this in mind. Thanks for the tip
---
So purchased 2 ranged and 2 armor legendaries. I got a bezerker's and ghoul slayer on the weapons, bad pulls but inconclusive. 
---
BUT on the armor not only they were both vanguard but also robot arms. 
---
A lobby hopping I go.
---
I think it's because most games similar to this genre allowed for sessions to be hosted on the players machine. Like Ark or Conan for example you can "host a server" which essentially turns your PC into a server. Giving your friends the name often allows them access if properly port forwarded etc.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
For people who thought this is how things would be, this is a pretty bad idea lol. If server files are stored locally they can be altered/changed to the users desire. Someone could, for example give themselves max caps, resources, or items UNLESS characters on private servers are unique to that server alone, and cannot be transferred back to official/other servers.
---
They‚Äôd have to modify arm models for every type of suit, holding/attached to every type of unarmed weapon. I‚Äôm guessing someone at the meeting said ‚ÄúWait a minute. Unarmed is hella strong. PA is dumb tough. Putting them together is a bad plan. Let‚Äôs make them mutually exclusive and save ourselves 400 more models to mess around with.‚Äù I bet everyone left that meeting happy.
---
Happy to help.
---
I kill thoes bots all the time for cores and mats. To get them to not see u as a enemy you need to change servers.
---
why not both?
---
it is a good idea to bring back settlements, each settlement could have its own story.. maybe even combine it with workshops, rather than claiming a workshop and building machines to gain resources for yourself, it could contribute to the settlement until a failed event happens or whatever
---
Perhaps this video will enlighten you on the principles of paperwork: https://youtu.be/pQHX-SjgQvQ
---
I was meant to say other games that don't host it themselves, such as Ark. I doubt there will be distinction between a "unofficial character" and official one, and that most people will be wanting to play with the characters they have now, and not reset that progress. And as for the duping, it's still a banable offence, and Bethesda punishes people it finds evidence of duping, some of which have been banned from the start of the game til now.
---
Also a server shouldn't and I'm sure it doesn't classify as "downloadable content" and it shouldn't be free, in fact most people who own one still pay for it, just don't charge those who they play with or it comes with a small fee off entry. Oh and as for the single player point. Most people who want private servers will either have their close community or play single player, since that's what they wanted the private servers for in the first place
---
I spend more than 2600 script and got nothing useful.
---
it is a lever repeater, lvl 45 non-legendary ( only have one legendary and it is lvl 20)
---
I get what a build is I am just have not followed anything, what I did not know was there were build for this game, but it is too late for that thought :)
---
My SPECIAL is 8 15 6 4 11 6 6  I have rank 3 of Rifleman, Export Rifleman and master Rifleman
---
My armor deep pocketed studded leather
---
Always have rad away on the weel because of this. It‚Äôs f‚Äôn annoying. This happens usually against the SBQ, but it‚Äôs made me a better fighter trying to avoid dying
---
Second that
---
Ive been in quite a few games with Noobmaster3000 are you sure he isn't the hacker XD Dude is darn good.
---
I have 3 toons. Heavy weapon, vats rifle / pistol and shotgun builds. Yesterday I spend more than 2600 script but nothing useful.
---
Play with him daily he's not good enough to be a hacker
---
The outhouse has a molerat pop out.
---
I mean, I'm aware of that. Of course they don't need they money to sustain the game.
---
I was just trying to be semi reasonable. Though I don't really think Bethesda should be giving or free updates, big and small, and not have any secondary MXT support.
---
I'd rather have paid expansions than MXTs though.
---
Would you mind explaining to me how duping ruins the game? Im pretty ignorant when it comes to this.
---
1.nothing is or can be free there has been too manny descusions of why nothing will be free. 2. I wouldent ask betesda to add anything atm with wastelanders being hulted for a extended time.since players keep asking for shit to be added.
---
my pets used to die a lot, but now i turned pacifist mode to "ON" . my deathclaw is alive and happy for 3 weeks now. allso i leave like 10-15% budget space at all times.  my theory is pets take budget space up and if you have none the game kills it off
---
What did you use for destroy robots with no weapons equipped challenge? I've been stuck at 676 for months and I'm an unarmed build so I've definitely killed some.
---
I do actually work in game dev, but to answer your question:
---
Fornite sells nothing but cosmetic MXTs on a free to play game. It's because they make cosmetics their community wants.
---
Beth makes mostly garbage ones.
---
No one truly knows because some items they bring back temporarily and some they don't. If you're really not sure about getting an item, don't. Bethesda is using some pretty shady business practices when it comes to the atomic shop. So only get an item if you know you're gonna keep using it in your camp.
---
Either he was away from the game or a really douchey way to instigate PvP
---
Lol if i even see a lock i wanna pick but someones camp is close i change servers and hope there aint a camp there again.
---
I've been looking into porting the Fo76 assets over to Fo4. the latest itv felt like a punch to the gut, moreso than every other stupid decision they've made thus far. because it's not just incompetence at this point, but rather greed.
---
I have extensive experience with the CK but honestly don't know how it'd turn out. it definitely wouldn't look the same, for one. no multiplayer, either. that's probably a deal breaker for lots of people. still debating whether it's worth the man hours.
---
keep switching tabs and return menu etc 
---
just keep checking, thats the only thing that seemed to do something rofl
---
Alright I added you. My gt is StaticGobbyYT. I need to see this pool.
---
I equipped a Power Armor with arm mods that increased Unarmed damage, then equipped lv3 Iron Fist, unequipped my weapon and went on a robot destruction spree. I also made use of some grenades.
---
Thanks! I do have the card but may have moved it off my build for something else.
---
Funny, I'm here too and thats not what I've been seeing. Juicehead even released a video on how to play singleplayer in the official servers a couple of days ago :P
---
&gt; Even if you bought the software for the server, I'm Bethesda would still find a way of charging you for using their content.
---
As it stands, yea, with mods, which they absolutely will. :P If they'd give us the software to host our servers they'd have no control over that outside of consoles.
---
dont be sorry, you had to, aint gon stand there and die, you took cover and ran etc, bad luck for the owner
---
Think to urselves for a moment. Why would bethesda banned active players when there parent company zinamax wont banned bots from ESO..
---
Dumb.
---
Is this a pc only issue?
---
HAHA THIS GUY THINKS THE BUZZ BLADE SHOULD BE BUFFED
---
Dude, a Bloodied Buzz Blade is easily the best melee weapon in the game for everything except the SBQ. I do almost 400 damage with mine at all times, and I kill everything in under 5 seconds, Sheepsquatch included.
---
I think you just have the wrong build, chief.
---
Not much, still a buggy mess. But, It‚Äôs a pretty good game when it works. Also, if you play on PS4, we can play together if you want to.
---
they're not. that's a blatant lie. people don't spend hundreds, thousands of dollars on mobile games because bankruptcy is fun. they do it because they can't play otherwise.
---
the only popular convenience item on the shop is the collectron, and not because it's oh, so convenient. it's because people want a companion. other than people who genuinely thought they needed kits to repair their equipment (yes, I've seen a couple), few people actually blow atoms on that crap. just look at all those camps with fridges in them, which is to say maybe one in a dozen.
---
they'll just whatever so long it's not verifiable to justify screwing us over when the shop goes full p2w.
---
Then why is everything he ever says is a fucking lie?
---
If you don't think the Buzz Blade is one of the best Bloodied melee, you're doing something wrong.
---
Uh, no they don't? Bloodied Buzz Blade is easily the best melee in the game except for the SBQ. I do almost 400 damage at all times, it kills everything else in under 5 seconds.
---
It's not?
---
I love the game and dont complain all that much but my issue is I had the extra 700 to dump on it t ok see just how pay to win it was. I mean I made those atoms and didnt purchase,  but still I mean if it helps 'cool', if it helps alot 'what the fuck'. But it doesn't do better than good with salt by any means and i basically use it like my fridge irl and just to store fresh fertilizer I've forgotten about. But what really gets me talking is the fridge skin. At a cool cool evened out price of exactly as fucking much as the fridge. . . I'm just like sitting here thinking to myself that every atom shop skin that isnt evenly priced is somehow drastically shittier in quality as the skin should be the same price as the others. Idk it's just weird and kinda confusing.  Like what if I bought that thinking I was getting the fridge. The other looks new and untarnished,  maybe a person may think the raider one or whatever was the legit fridge. I can see a dude getting wiiiiicked mad about that. Even 450 or 600 would be easier to swallow than THE EXACT SAME FUCKING PRICE!A!AAAA!
---
I've said my pea.... my unrest. 
---
I love this game but... come the fuck on guys. Get real.
---
Use a Bloodied Buzz Blade. It can easily hit almost 400 damage and is easily the best melee weapon for everything except SBQ.

I was hoping the knuckles mod would fix that but it's garbage and useless and they're probably never going to allow PA unarmed..

Don't worry bro they'll raise the cap and you can pay for it in the atomic shop.

The good thing is that devs have shown commitment to cracking down on those fools.

Get x-01 power armour power armour, diluted rad-x if you have mutations you require to flee and a ton of radaway, that is if you haven't tried this already

Bethesda did maintance last week to suposaly stop dupers from dupilicating items like meat cleavers and mines. Yet the same items are still being spam duped. So bethesda devs apparently dont know how to fix anything... js.
---
Which building?
---
Hey, we aren't getting the power armor bugs anywhere near as often. Maybe it takes em a few tries. No ones perfect. People gotta have a little faith and patience.
---
It ain‚Äôt fun for the victim.Some people don‚Äôt want to PvP and,while the mine doesn‚Äôt do damage to them it irradiates them.It is an inconvenience and it starts to get annoying when those dicks follow you.
---
I can totally understand people that want to PvP and have fun,but they gotta do it with someone of the same mindset and not troll people like this.
---
If you're on XB1 it's free to play with the XB1 pass. But yeah PS4 it's full price right now and I think it's an Epic Games store exclusive on PC but not certain. Depending on how it sells it may go on sale soon after release üòÑ
---
I came across that same random spawn in flatwoods near the radio tower. I just use my rifle on it witch makes it explode since i use maxed out bloody mess perk. Take everything and move on.
---
It's literally in the promo shots when inspecting the rocket
---
GTA Online dosnt even use servers, its complete peer to peer bullshit, hands why it loads as long as it does.
---
In Australia some higher pierced skins are close to $30...
---
Yeah, but they have to ship them all the way to Australia...
---
The other dead factions are the newly made up factions. That's the point.

Well don't forget that watching for inspiring ideas is good but going out among your town, looking at real building, checking out movies etc is another great way to get inspired. Thanks for watching.

Putting myself out there. Currently lvl 12.

I understand what you mean but I've found that a good amount of people use that design out of boredom or they don't wanna build something else which is perfectly fine but I think if there was more flat land we'd see less of this design. It's an eye sore but to each their own haha. Thanks for watching.

I got a BE hunting rifle and a bloodied ffr hunting rifle back to back yesterday.  Today was trash guns however.   Damn I only spent about 400 scrip total though.
---
Depends how close you are to whatever you're shooting at. üòâ
---
Damn nice dude! A bloodied ffr hunting rifle was the gun that actually made me switch my build to bloodied in the first place lol
---
Did you buy that from a vendor on xbox for 5000 caps?
---
I honestly don‚Äôt understand why this isn‚Äôt the case.
---
I use nuke mines on people I catch duping and people who afk in vendors. I know dupers gonna dupe but it's annoying when it bugs down my server
---
Yeh I‚Äôve been finding more and more Sheepsquatch corpses recently. The most recent injured super mutant still shot at me so I killed him
---
OP doesn't understand RNG
---
I wanna meet the dickhead who thought power armors skins and bundles should cost almost 20$ but I wanna give that person a handshake, around their neck in a dark ally.
---
Nah, I am on xbox but I got this one as a drop like 6ish months ago
---
The ones I can remember are 1 near where Meat Week BBQ is and the one in the Mountains past the Ammo Workshop. 
---
Where's one near the truck stop, that's buildable?
---
More flags and tires in the Atomic Shop.
---
Like?
---
Nice! It's a fun gun for sure. I think mine did just over 500 damage listed in pip boy when I put the 50 cal mod on it
---
Yeah I definitely love that .50 cal mod haha
---
Hey if you use vats make sure to put aligned barrel and grip for less vats costs. Idk if aligned 50 receiver helps but it probably does if you can find it
---
Slowly even the most hardcore defenders like myself are coming around, recognizing that this game is nothing but a cash grab centered on monetizing the Atom Shop and in return providing the most half assed Fallout experience possible. People defending this game were relying on Bethesda's good will, that the money earned from the Atom Shop would revert into the game, optimizing server stability, polishing the game and adding content at an acceptable rate to keep players active and interested. But anyone who's been playing this game since day 1 like myself could have realized after The Burrows and Badges dlcs, that Bethesda was putting very low effort into keep the remaining players satisfied with sticking with the game. Damn they even had the nerve to nerf fun stuff to make it more grindy. This "new found" microtransaction orientation that they now assume blatantly, is the proof of their ill-will. Personally, i still login from time to time to check new features, events and all, but i'm less and less motivated to do so, because there's next to nothing around to do. With the postponing of Wastelanders and this focus on the Atom Shop, i'll be deleting this game for the coming months and give space for The Outer Worlds, Death Stranding and other titles. Out of all the negative things i got to say about Bethesda at this point, i sincerely hope that Starfield and TES VI take a 180¬∫ turn from Fallout 76 policy. I also fear that having a Fallout 76 which can be updated when Bethesda wants, a Fallout 5 will be postponed indefinitely or even scratched from the map. Damn you Bethesda for ruining my favorite franchise.
---
It could possibly have been removed and is now a legacy weapon, but I'm honestly not sure. I too haven't found any legendary Dragons both from the Purveyor, and legendary farming in at least 2-3 months.
---
why?
---
Only time will tell. Based on their track record, if it's just Austin working on it, I would agree with you fully. They've terribly mismanaged this game from the beginning. They haven't delivered on 4 out of 9 badges from their 2019 road map.
---
If Dallas and maybe even segments of Maryland chip in, I would be a little more hopeful of the overall outcome. It'll still be buggy af. However, hopefully a tolerably buggy like back in their Skyrim days.
---
Thanks for the advice, I think may already have those mods on it, not sure tho. Haven't used it in a while. I switch back and forth between rifleman and commando weapons pretty often and I have been rocking the full auto guns a lot lately
---
Eh. Works for me. I‚Äôve honestly stopped playing until Wastlanders launches anyway.
---
Ah, that I understand.  
---
Well, if server software is available then you might be able to run it on your own computer and effectively get single player?
---
Yeah servers definitely have a prefered effect and weapon it seems. One server I rolled on today gave me 5 mutant weapons out of 12 rolls I did. Another gave me 3 black powder rifles out of 7 rolls. Honestly spending all this scrip for literally nothing, and then having to wait several days to turn it back to scrip is making me wanna uninstall
---
Why tho..?
---
No new content doesnt mean you cant play the current content. If you've completed all the current content go play something else for a month. Give Conan a try or Ark or whatever.
---
That and when I do use rifles I tend to use my BE Gauss more often cause I can get higher damage numbers from it.
---
&gt;Just to be clear,  ***I'm not petitioning for the servers to be shut down***. I can already sense those knee-jerk downvotes. Just wanted to discuss ***the merits of shutting down the servers*** vs not shut down the servers 
---
? :)
---
They basically said, ‚Äú yeah the cosmetic only promise we made? Yeah we taking that back. We saw that selling things that aren‚Äôt cosmetic sell better and make us more money.‚Äù 
---
Which is BS. Who on their right mind actually spends real cash on atoms to get scrap or repair kits? You get better repair kits killing the SBQ. This was BGS plan all along. They were eventually going to add more ‚Äúutility‚Äù things. Can‚Äôt wait until they start selling OP armor and weapons too
---
FO4, no doubt. The only thing I "like" about the FO76 system is that I'm spending more time playing the game rather than building, the perfectionist in me made it really hard to tear myself away from my settlements.
---
Nice yeah I run 1 of each commando and each rifleman card so I can swap between handmade and lever when I please. I use my bloodied +50% crit faster reload lever to one shot almost everything, and switch to my auto primed bloodied explosive vats cost handmade for killing bats. Full auto seems to bug out a lot and not do damage correctly tho
---
sell it for 1100 or 1300 in my vendor
---
Got a bloodied faster reload hunting rifle with extra damage when aiming down the sight.
---
Oh nice that's a cool gun. Have a bffr gauss and tse gauss myself and use neither of em. I guess the gauss is better than hunting rifle for the sake of actual sniping
---
Yeah I have noticed that with it not doing damage correctly, especially with vats
---
I did 5 recall cards when they added it to the purveyor and got 3 plans, maybe the chance is higher if it's your card?
---
Well they double down on their cosmetic only promise, so soon you‚Äôll be able to buy camp budget increases!
---
Yeah I can hit pretty hard with the gauss. Full bloodied with nerd rage I get like 1100-1200 damage per shot if fully charged
---
What is today???
---
Yep I exclusively use vats. Never have the problem with semi auto anymore though
---
no
---
Do you have time later today? Currently at 750 caps
---
It's a discussion. I don't have all the answers.
---
However, for me pull servers offline to save on money and resources. Move people who normally support the servers to some other department (QA would make sense). From the player's side, it'd be a fresh start, rather than something that can get stale with enough time.
---
The only pro I can think of keeping it up is for Atom Store revenue only. If BGS commits to providing more decent content throughout, sure, makes sense to keep servers going. Maybe it's just me but I get the sense that we're not going to get much in the way of new content that we don't have to pay for.
---
Do you run full 3x3 rifleman? Bloody mess 3 and nerd 3?
---
Yeah thats what I run when using that, also rank 3 of Demo Expert
---
3.1k here
---
&gt;or is a total griefer, always taking over my workshops and looting my junk after they easily wreck me in 2 secs.
---
so he is doing someting alowed in the game and you call him a grifer?
---
oh i see. yea itd probably speed up the launch but i feel like all the youtubers and news will just say ‚ÄúFallout 76 finally shutting down and giving up?‚Äù
---
any time bethesda touches this game people start crying i think there would be looting in the streets and murder if the game shut down lmfao
---
I dont think you are getting the scenario I'm talking about
---
In the Wastelanders preview video her voice narrates so we haven't heard the last from the Overseer. 
---
I haven't found all the tapes, I'm at 15/17. I guess the other 2 are in Vault 94?
---
Damn nice I've never run all 3x3 of any damage cards yet. Only run nerd 1 myself as well. I do around 1600 with my lever with sneak headshots. And with my new extra crit damage lever I do exactly 1999 for a sneak crit headshot lol it couldn't give me the extra damage point
---
I don't mind if it doesn't speed up launch. I'd much prefer an improvement of quality. Fewer bugs. More polish.
---
I wouldn't have even entertained the idea of shutting things down had FF XIV not done so successfully. They went from a trash tier game to I believe one of the leaders? Well, somewhere up there anyhow.
---
We need something at least. The game has nothing to in it for veteran players at all and people are leaving
---
yeah no problem, going to login later and make sure no one bought it, will let you know and put it on hold for you.
---
PvP at workshops is not griefing, it's playing the game as intended.
---
I dropped my screen resolution and could up my graphics and shadows to ultra, looks OK.
---
Lol so close to 2000, thats awesome tho man! Yeah I usually just switch my cards around to have 3x3 rifleman or 3x3 commando depending on what guns im carrying at the moment
---
Please no I haven't yet found my b ss 90% shovel that I'm looking for!
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying. The repair kits are ridiculous but I‚Äôm gonna be honest, I bought the refrigerator. It looks great with my bar!
---
I don't think shutting down the servers until wastelanders could have any positive effect on the game at all. I dont really understand how this is even a legitimate question.
---
And what about the private servers? Bethesda also lets us pay extra for that.
---
I would pay that much for the plan
---
? yourself. I don't see anything inconsistent with what I said.
---
Let me ask you something. What's the merit of keeping the servers going beyond new Atom Store items? Things appear that we're not going to get much if anything in the way of content so what's the point?
---
So people can max out their build with legendaries and their perfect perk loadout? Then what?
---
That's what I wanted to discuss :)
---
A Halloween cookout with Grahm and Chally the moo moo :D
---
Oh I'm jealous 
---
&gt;depending on what guns im carrying at the moment
---
My stash is always full so I constantly have like 15 guns on me. 
---
I'm going to try that out with rifleman tho for sure as I love this lever. With ground pounder 3 (works for semi auto even though it says auto only) my lever reloads almost instantly and doesnt even make noise when I reload lol
---
God not this again, seriously if someone wants to pay-to-save-time why not let them, maybe Bethesda will be able to afford another programmer that can fix some fucking bugs that way.
---
Level 28
---
Psn: Cortecca
---
i‚Äôm goin to sleep but i‚Äôm down to grind tomorrow!
---
Yup.
---
Oops
---
Sorry for wasting your time
---
add me on psn with 'fo76' in request pls, im lvl 43 and can craft you some weapons to get you going
---
Yeah I usually sell a decent amount of stuff in my vendors so I usually have stash space for extra guns if need be, and I usually run just lvl 1 of tank killer too. I like the extra armor penetration
---
Bethesda saving money and being able to divert server support to other areas to work on Wastelanders are just a couple.
---
What's the point of keeping the servers going if there's not going to be any real new content? Look at the posts Bethesda's put out of late. It's all about Wastelanders and post-Wastelander. Very little if anything about new content.
---
vats and headshot him
---
I've been running level 3 but I read that over a certain damage per shot it does nothing against all but the hard 6 or so mobs. I took it off and the damage numbers show the same when I hit super muties so idk. I like to leave it on for good measure I guess
---
At this point the stash limit and camp building limit are so frustrating I'm ready to spend Atoms to increase the size(s).
---
I've been selling through my vendor a ton of stuff. But sometimes bulking all that needs more plastic or something similar and the stash limit is driving me insane.
---
The camp build size is too. So much stuff to display that takes my stash space. The whole system makes me not want to log in. Making me crazy!
---
Yeah I get you. Hmm maybe ill have to do some testing of my own lol
---
Oh I agree we do need something. It would be nice if Bethesda would put in the time and resources to provide that content but they just won't.
---
They really should be flooding the market with cosmetics for basically every item and for basically every price tier, from low-price/clearance ($1 skins), average price ($2-$4), high-tier, community-designed ($5 max, some of which goes back to the artists), and include free cosmetic sets that you can only get in the game by playing normally and doing challenges.
---
I feel like many micro-transaction stores fail to excel because they either overprice the good skins out of the park (e.g., Apex Legends with their $20 character or single weapon skins), the lack of variety/ability to make a character look unique to the player's preferences (e.g., PUBG where basically everyone somehow looks the same unless they spend $50+ on a rarer drop), or they don't hire quality artists with inspired creativity (e.g., the low-tier skins in CS:GO vs the community or professional artist designed skins). 
---
The first problem: is that there is just no 'gotta collect them all' sentiment in the Atom Shop nor in the game right now. Once you are done with the story and done gearing up with your weapon(s) of choice, the end game is basically about grinding for comfort/customization/creativity for your character/appearance/home space. However, the available cosmetics right now seem so haphazardly slapped together thematically and too √†-la-carte at exorbitant prices. 
---
For example, the other day, there was the Hunting Rifle - Blackbird skin for 700 atoms. While a tempting buy because it looks good, it was like one of two items (the other being a Power Armor skin for 1800 atoms) in its theme/color set. So that means for just two items in a set I might've wanted, I'd have to shell out 2500 Atoms ($25) for only two pieces of the Blackbird set? Out of how many items in the game? If I remember, there are at least 100 different weapons in the game. If the entire set existed (which is a closely related second problem because they don't seem to exist yet), how many Atoms/$ would I have to dedicate just to one theme? 
---
The second problem: as mentioned above, theme sets are not complete nor on sale at the same time. If you want to be Raider themed, or First Responders themed, or Pioneer Scouts themed, then you only have one or two items to choose from and may have to buy each item of the theme at different times of the year. If you're gonna make themes, then have all the items ready to go and available to purchase at the same time. The Blackbird Hunting Rifle skin example comes back to mind because the Blackbird PA skin wasn't even available to buy until the week after (when the rifle skin was already put back into the Atom Vault). If they were available simultaneously, then maybe more people (well, mainly only PA + Hunting Rifle users) would've been like, 'Hmm, I'd buy this just to match my armor and rifle together and complete my look.'
---
Third problem: everyone basically has the same skins. This is probably related to the lack of available cosmetics in general. However, just walking through Appalachia, I never feel very awed by any other character's cosmetics, especially if they are not in a Power Armor. At most it is that feeling like, 'Ah, you bought that skin from the Atom Shop, cool.' However, chances are, most of the time, I just feel like I've seen someone dressed the exact same way before. That's how the lack of variety really hurts the overall game. I never have that feeling where, 'Wow, I need to get my hands on that color' or 'I want that hairstyle, too' because deep-down, I know I would look almost exactly like them.
---
Final problem (related to the third problem), the Atom Shop team needs to work with the regular game team to work on some cohesive cosmetics and hire better artists/modelers that can connect both teams. There is so much potential for random cosmetics that it hurts to not have that many cosmetics to express your individuality. More hairstyles, more face masks/paints/tattoos, clothing dyes, hair dyes, styles that cross themes better so that people want to mix-and-match, stickers for your Power Armor, temporary tattoos you get out of bubblegum wrappers, visible accessories to wear beyond the Pip-Boy, cuter player avatars/icons, etc. Make some themes an Atom Shop exclusive, make other themes earnable via in-game challenges. Make it feel as if a player plays long enough that they can earn many of cosmetics they want, and never feel like they have to 'save up Atoms/money, but spend carefully'--aim for the impulse buyers at impulse prices $1/100 Atoms. There's so much retrofuturism design out there that there should be a plethora of cosmetics, but we're still seeing cosmetics pulled directly out of Fallout 4 and art that looks copy and pasted from Fallout Shelter (icons) or clip art--this is the chance to just go nutty with the art and see what is popular enough to enter canon for the series down the road.
---
A distantly related problem (sorta, not sure): the 1:1 equivalency of Atoms to real money. You earn Atoms via limited challenges per account, but once you complete those account challenges, that's it. Alts don't get to do the challenges again, and I never really see new challenges being placed into the game (besides minor Dailys/Weeklys). I am sure this done to make people feel as if their real money spent on Atoms retains a 'value' derived from rarity. However, a currency's (Atoms) value is also determined by what and how much can be bought with that currency. Hence, people save their Atoms and never really let them go unless there's an item they absolutely want or will wait until item are on deep discount. Atoms shouldn't feel like they should be valued/hoarded like they are; they should feel like you can spend them freely and that you always feel like you are getting a deal. Honestly, I think the Atoms (earned via challenges) and real money transactions should've been separate, like being able to use Atoms for the challenge-based cosmetics (the cosmetics anyone can get if you play long enough, no money contribution), while you can buy fancier, professionally done cosmetics for a direct real money cost (financially supporting the game, while some of that cost going back to the original artist to support them as well).
---
As the system stands, when I buy (or earn) 1000 Atoms, it should feel like I can buy multiple things with that amount, not just one item and maybe a Photomode frame. It's probably too late to rework this system, but the fact that Atoms are 1:1 with $ makes people (or just me) think there's real money at stake. It makes people less likely to spend Atoms which leads to the situation where the MTX store depends wholly on 'whales' and big spenders (like how Apex Legends got into some hot water about just a few weeks/months back). I'd rather my money spent on Atoms felt like contributing support to the game and getting a lot of items (bang for my buck) rather than feeling like I'm entering a trade agreement with the Atom Shop commerce team. If I have to stop and think
---
* Do I really want this cosmetic?

* Will I stop using this character/item this $10 cosmetic is for, down the road?
---
* Do I even have or want to use the item this skin is for?
---
with each and every time I consider a purchase, then there's something intrinsically wrong with the MXT store.
---
TL;DR: Complete theme sets for all items (make people want to 'catch them all'), hire better artists and flood the cosmetic stuff with both free/paid things, and make sets way more affordable/impulse buy like at a dollar store (more bang for buck). Summary of side thought: 1:1 ratio of $ to Atoms psychologically hinders spending.
---
Altought my machines are outside, people still go inside so I don't lock my door BUT it would be nice if people would CLOSED my door when they leave.
---
I went to a camp where the owner did me a favor by crafting me a max level Fixer so when I departed I closed his door and the guy started bustin' up laughing because he has never seen that in this game. I told him well your door was closed when I arrived so it's only the right thing to do.
---
It be nice to use the atom dollars i earn for that
---
I'm in the same boat. I haven't played for I think a couple of months. With Wastelanders delayed, there's even less reason to get back in.
---
Look how many camps have the scavenger collectron, its what has opened up the doors. You barely see a camp without one. So people are buying non cosmetic items. If they bring in a ammo scrapper, I'd buy it.
---
I got 3 different build still nothing and now my toons are overloaded can't fast travel. It is too bad we can't script them one
---
I assume he'll be fine if left alone due to their regeneration abilities
---
Well if you tried both with snipers and super sledge from the same character basically you were chanceless. If you are interested in PvP knowledge send me your current build as well as information about what gear type you wanna use, but you can only pick single weapon class if you want it to be really optimised.
---
Happens frequently if you die during Scorched Earth, since it spawns you at the fissure site. I've found opening the pip-boy immediately and fast traveling to Drop Site V9 saves me. 
---
Same thing if you load into Whitesprings and it's been nuked.
---
I'd spend atoms on some cool prefab houses. Think F4 have some nice mods for this, complete sanctuary housing kits that let you build houses that actually looked like the rest of the houses.
---
now, take that one step further, imagine setting up a house like the frat houses - two stories, cool basement. even more wet dreaming - a smaller mansion :-)
---
i haven‚Äôt seen this leggings phenomenon
---
levels dont mean anything in pvp...
---
i deed it
---
Yes maybe the collection can get you something you‚Äôve marked for search but it can only get you junk you can pick up anywhere, it‚Äôs not going to get you any ultracite or flux, and if your weapons need fully repairing after 4 reloads you need to look at your perks. Modding weapons for durability can‚Äôt match up to the bonus from perks even with 1 level into the right perks you can go through a few mission/events without having to find a repair bench and it‚Äôs the same with armour and power armour and as I mentioned before you can repair them to a higher level than you can with the repair kits, 200% condition and a durability boost from perks outweighs anything the repair kits can do and makes it so all they can do is help you out if you don‚Äôt have enough scrap to repair (which you can get in 5 minutes of looting even low level areas like flatwoods) . Neither offer so much of an advantage that they could be considered OP or game breaking and neither are necessary to have fun or even complete missions/events.
---
I cleared all of those during operation clean Appalachia.
---
What's a mxt?
---
What's wrong with Mr Fuzzy?  Or the fridge?
---
I read houses as horses and you made me want a rideable Brahmin more than whatever you just suggested.
---
I would take original concepts like rideable creatures over rehashed FO4 DLC anyday. Give me a rideable Nuka-Cowla.
---
Bethesda is like that flakey person that we all know that keeps making promises and keeps finding excuses for delays or not showing up or the like.
---
It's just within the nature of Bethesda current management. Maybe not the flagship studio but certainly Austin. They've consistently mismanaged the game throughout. We'd be expecting too much of them to do something sensible as you've suggested and ALSO stick the landing.
---
Nuclear Winter Battle Royale was awesome right? That was all Dallas. The quests in the game were awesome, right? That was Maryland.
---
What's the best that Austin done that wasn't tainted with something really shitty as well. Biv maybe? That's the only one I can think of that was relatively issue free.
---
get rid of stuff, then pick up more. repeat ad infinitum. wonder what's wrong with you, but keep doing it anyways.
---
Yes to ammo scrapper! A more useful way of selling/trading/scrapping would be amazing, rather than just dropping unwanted ammo whenever your inventory gets too cluttered.... And yes, I bought a scrapper. Not for the junk, coz it usually only gets stuff I rarely use, but for the life it gives my camp and how he makes things feel just a little less lonesome...
---
It should work but sadly even with -130% damage it doesn‚Äôt
---
Don't horde anything for the future. Keep only what you need on hand now. If you can't use it now or very soon, it's just wasted space.
---
Make a mule alt and move em over
---
Why?
---
You can't possibly be using or about to use, everything in your stash.  You probably have a shit tonne of Scrap Steel or several pieces of heavy weapons and or armour.  Mini Nukes are I think 11lbs so those add up as do Fusion/Plasma cores.
---
I always do
---
Oh crap, I forgot about mini nukes and grenade launcher ammo! Thanks for reminding me.
---
Done! ‚úî
---
Unmod all the weapons you want to keep but not playing atm
---
THIS IS GRAFTON‚ÄôS MAYOR
---
About a mile or 2 northeast of the family cabin or whatever it is.
---
however, atoms can also be gained without paying real money 
---
that is the only reason why im ok with "small" utility items in the atom shop
---
XB1
---
I had it for sale for 300 caps and in 2 weeks no one bought it. So i went to flatwoods and gave it away to the first newbie i came across.
---
What annoys me most is that they know full well that they broke their promise but they come up with all sorts of bs to justify it. They nerfed the White Knight perk and then add repair kits. The food spoilage rate was increased earlier this year when people were already complaining about it, then fridges show up. They create problems just to sell us the solution and I‚Äôm worried with how far they will take it, but I‚Äôm annoyed that they like to pretend to be oblivious.
---
I don't have a lot of time to play the game, so I usually sell them in my vending machine and buy ammo from others with the profits.
---
Keep a scrap kit or two on you in case of when you‚Äôre too far away from your camp or a stash box, decide what you need and hunt for what you need. Personally I take my best weapon with me and that‚Äôs about it so I can hold a bunch of weight if I want to go collecting. I also use a back pack
---
The Berserker‚Äôs Explosive Pipe is not garbage. it is not awesome but it would be good for a low DR build at SBQ. i‚Äôd rock it if i got one
---
Ok, thanks!
---
If it's delayed by approx five months, I suggest they're miles away from the polishing stage.
---
It‚Äôs more that they are good at sneaking, hide and go seek and can be devoted. That‚Äôs how I earned mine.
---
If it's going to the vault "vaulting soon" its implied it's gone for good. That said a vault can be reopened right? Otherwise they seem to have a chance to cone back until vaulted.
---
Ive ran a roleplay community since Beta, player made communities and private servers are what will keep this game alive.
---
You can‚Äôt drop or trade items bought in the atom shop even if it‚Äôs a normal item with paint from the atom shop, it‚Äôs partly so you can‚Äôt make caps from buying things with real cash then selling them for caps in game but mainly so you can‚Äôt give away stuff they‚Äôre trying to sell. Dropping anything that gives you that message will destroy the item and you don‚Äôt get scrap from it either it‚Äôs just gone.
---
Bulk scrap even when it's stored in a your stash. Use the weight saving perks. Just remember when u return an item to the stash the perk is not applied. Fusion cores are a shocker for this. With the ammo weight perk they can be alright to carry in the stash they will fill it up. Water also is a pain. Try inert flux instead - flux that's spoiled. It weight half what water does. It will give u rads  but you can't win them all
---
Mr Fuzzy was bugged the last time I checked. They even removed it from the shop. 
---
You can‚Äôt put some foods in the fridge. For example you can put meat but not meals made with the same meat. There are many examples but can‚Äôt remember all of them.
---
I bought it for 50, which seemed really cheap. (100 day old posts are talking about it being 4k)
---
They're frequently on r/Market76 for 15k!
---
. . . Mind blown.
---
I never thought of doing that. You frikin' overweight handmades are going back to being babies toys!
---
You and me both. So limited right now and the more I buy from atomic shop the more I feel punished with space and limitations.
---
1400 hours here, still finding new little unmarked locations. so many i want to rebuild my camp at
---
Inert flux as water? Interesting.
---
if budget is full, you cannot place anything anymore 
---
basically that
---
Yep
---
Next week we're gonna get private servers which means lots of PvPers will sink into PvP-only private servers - you'll mostly see their bright side when they go public
---
Survey is nice but this is the kind of thing that may required targeted testing.
---
At least you can verify the data as being accurate. Here you're just hoping for the best.
---
I'm not sure I understand the point of discussing shutting down the servers. 
---
Once people casually hear "oh yeah Fallout 76 died, they took the servers down" regardless of why Bethesda did, the game fades from people's memory. How many will seek it out to see if just by chance the servers came back online? Once you sunset a game, it's over. Shutting down the servers, even for 5 months, might as well be a sunset.
---
Hahahaha, good luck.
---
[This exists for a fucking reason.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFcLyDb6niA)
---
Minimum build is weapon and a backup, and five armor pieces. Two weapons, five armors to complete to be even remotely prepared.
---
Microtransactions
---
I thought they would be free because Ark also has some private servers where you could just play with a few friends. And because the game was already 60$ and also has microtransactions so like...yeah, let them ask for more money, why not.
---
Same
---
Because it encourages bad game design. Bethesda purposefully made the game worse for these time-savers to have any value.
---
I'd appreciate a team up as well, currently lvl 25.
---
PSN LakeshowAD1986
---
What makes it worse, cost wise, to this company than an instance with other people around me? A private instance with just me would actually save them bandwidth costs. 
---
Then again, looking at what a mess their games have been for how long, I can see how their server side would be so badly engineered that it requires a lots of cpu and ram resources for each instance they spin up. 
---
And of course hosting on my own machine would never happen cause then there is no reason to use their useless cash shop.
---
Came here to say this! We need this
---
Playing the game?
---
The whole non-cosmetics making us more money isn't even verifiable. We don't have any independent data showing that these items are being picked up at a large rate. Heck, we don't even have figures provided by Bethesda. We just have Bethesda vague statement.
---
We can't assume that if Bethesda said it, it must be true. We didn't ask for utility items to be sold on the Atom Store as Bethesda has tried to gaslight us with twice now.
---
That was cheap, but i'm not surprised. Most active players have all the plans and i guess there's less and less new players coming in. I don't buy or sell anything beyond 500 caps. With the abundance of playing vending machines, why would someone spend a fortune on a plan? Although, I've seen players selling masks and bobbleheads for 1000 caps. I don't know who's dumb enough to pay so many caps for such items.
---
In my experience, the price doesn‚Äôt matter if you are constantly server hopping. Yesterday I sold 5 Ultracite Armor plans for 10k caps. That poor newbie thought he found something rare just because the price was high. 
---
People say Nocturnal Armor is crap but there is a very strong build that can use Nocturnal Armor and Weapons, so there will be some people that will be very interested in good Nocturnal gear. What I mean is that you can‚Äôt put a price on something, based on the speed you are selling it with. Especially if you are staying too long in the same server.
---
I paid 17000 last week, 1000 scrip spent 0 fixersüòí
---
The guy was lv 100+, guess he just wanted to help new players
---
Fixer plans sell for about 7k now, since you need the plan known to be able to get legendary fixers from murmgle
---
check out ninja from die antwoord instead
---
Hell yeah, let me buy spawn mats for 2,500 atoms Bethesda!! üò¥üò¥
---
Except people keep demanding new content.
---
If we get drip fed that new content, sure, totally agree with you. Do you honestly believe that we're going to get much in the way of new content between now and Wastelanders?
---
Just dont hoard.
---
spawn mats?
---
more like spawn traps
---
All I see is the Halloween event and maybe a Christmas event. Possibly vault 96 releasing  Yet still the servers shouldn't shut down. People still enjoy exploring, building up their camp, farming for junk, and just hanging with their friends. Not to mention new players who still have a lot to discover with no need for new content yet.
---
My other recommendation is before rolling for new legendaries at the purveyor, try killing some legendary mobs and see what kind of legendaries you get, by doing this you'll get a little "insight" of what kind of weapons and prefixes you're going to get.
---
Sometimes I get spawned outside of it, but it's a crapshoot. I just spam radaway on the wheel until I get out and adjust my rads with a gamma gun if I removed too many.
---
How?
---
If Wastelanders wasn't coming, I'd absolutely agree with you. However it is coming. It was a big enough deal that people got really hyped for it now. You don't think that people will be equally hyped months down the track.
---
I'm actually more concerned that due to a lack of real content, people will get sick of the game due to it going stale, get frustrated and sick of the lack of bug fixes and THAT's the thing that poisons people's perspectives.
---
On the what?
---
Reminds me on a youtube comment:
---
"Hey Bethesda, here is another dick for you to suck, I'll mark it on your map."
---
Old but gold.
---
[Queen flies off map]
---
Bethesda:  banned for being outside of playable area.
---
I bet the player that is currently winning has the fridge.
---
I'm 40 
---
They arn't spring chickens themselves. First time I saw them was probably around 15 years ago
---
I payed 17000 spent 1000 scrip 0 fixersüò¢
---
Sell everything you have keep 20 stimpacks thats all you really need. Scrap useless legendary weapons keep 5 bulks of every junk except for acid and lead. Modify your armor with deep pocketed. Unequip all mods from weapons you have stashed, make all arnor you have stashed weightless.
---
Got it, thanks!
---
&gt; Im still working on getting her bloodied since all the agility for stealth but one day... 
---
Yeah, that's a major problem with pistols: (almost) everything is in agility. With the others it's spread out a bit more.
---
To get my V.A.T.S gunslinger working, I went full luck, full agi and some in int and per. Agi was 1 Gun Fu, 4 Adrenaline, 9 in Gunslinger, 1 in Escape Artist. Unyielding armour (switched out for one piece of Chameleon on occasion). Bloodied Western revolver.
---
It works. Cause bloodied always works. Bloodied Commando or Sniper are more effective, though.
---
You could hotkey/quickwheel a hazmat suit also
---
I have 13 crossbows out of 4000 scrip a wasted. 0 bloodied weapons
---
Remember to remove your gunsmith perk. It takes forever to damage your crossbow if that perk is equipped. It took me a while to remember that perk reduces the condition damage taken on your firearms.
---
Raids are 94 and 96. And since the community hate everything,there won't be more. Devs stated the feedback was the judge.
---
Sold 2. One for 10k caps and the other for 17k 5.56
---
Do you really think when the game can barely handle multiple players and has bugs Bethesda can't fix that they'd be willing to implement that?
---
I hope they do find a way to do this but this game is still completely broken at times
---
You are spending 5 perk points tho
---
It is terrible but people spend a lot of money on this game judging by the camps I come across and some of the posts on here. Like who spends $5 just on picket fences? Absolute mugs
---
This irritates me to the best I could manage was the red plants from the atomic shop. It doesn't look bad and at least I don't fall off anymore.
---
You're Phantoms1990 right?
---
no, Banshinator :-)
---
Level 252 here. Yesterday a level 62 decided they were feeling feisty and started attacking me and other players at my vending machines. From their health bar I think they were running bloodied. 
---
So I put them down. And again. And again. 150 caps later I left the server. I don‚Äôt need the caps and I don‚Äôt need the grief.
---
It‚Äôs not just level 200+ that can be a dick.
---
Have you looked in your cornhole?
---
Check our r/pkoa, we have a few hundred members, very active on PS4 and love helping people.
---
The plan or grenades? I can give you the latter no problem..
---
Weird, i left the server and your request disappeared. I'll try sending you a request
---
I had to demolish a chunk of my house to put up another magazine rack.
---
In fairness, they only really vowed to avoid p2w, which it seems like they are staying with. All the same, I still wish we'd just get cool cosmetics at reasonable prices.
---
Truth is, it was rigged from the start
---
Plan
---
Yeah good luck.
---
But thats the case with almost every game that has announced the release of a new xpac/dlc. As soon as its announced they are focusing on that project instead of new content for the current tier.
---
Bye Felicia
---
This is the most pessimistic, assumption filled post I've ever read. This situation is frustrating but we aren't gonna lose fallout.
---
See ya
---
I got the fridge and not the collectron. It‚Äôs convenient for tasty squirrel stew. So in one I have the raw ingredients and the other has cooked ones. Fill em up maybe two times a week. Make like two with super duper, so I get three. One I eat, one I take with me and one is left in the fridge.
---
So just buy the game and play it?
---
Wood. Shrouded
---
I didn't think of testing if blueprinting could speed up the process, I must admit. I grinded by building as much junk cheap objects I could each time I took over a workshop. And allow me to add, every challenge involving 4-digit numbers were made to make players go insane.
---
If they had ready to release content, and were holding onto ready to release content, wouldn't it be best to just release that when it becomes ready to release content?
---
Quite a bit. I don't want to say it in fear devs may nerf them badly.
---
hardly, its pretty ignore-able so far which is a shame, i could see END being the "tanky" stat setup but currently you become more durable using luck or agility rather than endurance :/
---
When something like this happens to me, I can't help but to just sit back, and say "Thanks Todd."
---
Gatling Laser and ultracite gatling laser are two different weapons.
---
This doesn‚Äôt work if stash is full...
---
I agree, I am sitting at about 890 atoms just from doing the Weeklys and Dailys. Worst part is, nothing grabs my eye. I'm certainly not going to be buying 40 damn scrap kits.
---
Are you using any weight reduction perks like thru hiker?
---
Also if you any weapons or armor you aren‚Äôt using... get rid of them. If you have power armor pieces that aren‚Äôt on a frame, either get rid of them or get a frame.
---
I'm sure Mothman is getting pissed that I keep making his eggs into omelettes, and then making caps off of them.
---
As someone said yesterday, it's a catch 22 for them. If they don't announce wastelanders until they're certain it's ready, they have to sit and take the ongoing backlash about the lack of human NPCs without saying "we hear you and are working on it". And if they announce it a quakecon like they did, and then try to do the right thing and delay it while they work out bugs, everyone gets pissed off at them for it. They aren't flaky, they're trying to be better, at least in terms of wastelanders.
---
Make a mule I‚Äôve got 5 characters level 50+ just so I can get the extra scrip lol I‚Äôve got a lvl 330 142 and 3 at 50
---
1k scrip: AAE Handmade, Furious FFR Ultracite Gatling Laser, Executioners reduced weight Gauss, suppressors reduced weight missile launcher, TSE combat shotgun. Feelin good.
---
And/or it sits in the files waiting to be released forever.  Example: Even though they were free from the community event, [the facepaints that were just released were in one of, if not, the first data mine of the atom shop.](https://imgur.com/a/XqRJEZI) There's still outfits and hairstyles that have not been released from that mine.
---
[The rest of that data mine, if anyone is curious to see what's been sitting in files for almost a year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9wkrj9/datamined_atom_shop_all_items_pictured/)  It seems that most of it has been released, but a lot of it was sitting in there for a really long time.
---
Oh god the grind!!! I'm stuck at a few and been working on others.
---
I can't get whoopsies not matter how many times i go to that Quarry. 
---
I get sludge lung but it doesn't count for the challenge. Tried everything.
---
Never encountered the Alien, so i never killed it.
---
Currently working on the combat ones, ended the "kill scorched with....", now moving to "killing 1000+ robots" with different weapons which is a damn drag.
---
Haven't moved my Camp a lot, so settling in Appalachia is still ongoing.
---
The build x number of camp craftable items is also ongoing.
---
The badges are sooooo boring to do... so i keep postponing them.
---
Can't get the stimpak diffuser for the medic badge.
---
I still have a few weapon and armor plans to get.
---
I'm doing this from time to time, and since Wastelanders was postponed i'll be logging in much less for the coming weeks, but eventually i'll get it all done.
---
Personally, I'd like the building system to mean more in the future Beth titles. As it is, it basically serves only for immersion purposes. I loved it in FO4 and 76, but I really wish there was of a strategy element to it, some greater use and purpose.
---
They need to drop a 0 off the end of all there prices.
---
it's quite bad that a payed game that cost 60 dollars is turning into a low quality f2p game. Before fallout 76 came out i was looking foward to elder scrolls 6, but with this game doing this crap i now plan to never buy it since it will either start out trash or later on become trash.
---
I'm glad yongyea cares so much for the community and not actually hoping for the game to go through shitty times and make videos to bolster his bank account with low effort videos based off simple reddit threads.
---
Very lucky!Congratulations!!!
---
Yep and add the ultra-light mod to all unused (legendary) armor.
---
You sure you‚Äôre in the right marketplace there‚Äôs a post every few minutes.
---
They went about their MTX in about the scummiest way they could legally get away with. I say 'legally' because there was at least one occasion where they were breaking laws by putting things up for 'for sale' that had never been on the shop for any other price. 
---
Then you have these bundles with one thing people want and a bunch of crap to inflate the price. And who can forget $5 laminate floors. This game is worse than The Sims.
---
To me the baffling part is that it would have been so easy to do a good job. Hell, Bethesda Austin started as a studio specializing in monetizing mobile games, they should have been able to do a better job.
---
That‚Äôs been a problem for much longer.  They created a static spawn point next to fissure site prime and despite the fact that the community seems to hate fighting in nuke zones (for great reasons) they haven‚Äôt changed it.
---
Remove the paint and then you can drop it.
---
Ive seen one but didnt listen
---
I think private servers were mentioned in beta and never had 'fee' associated with it and people assumed it would be free instead.  I have zero problems paying a monthly fee for private server access as long as it's not ridiculously priced, or pay per instance only.
---
I‚Äôd settle for a desk terminal, like the kind you most run across in game, to play your Pip-Boy games on. The one we have right now has such a zoomed out, pinched in screen that it‚Äôs all but useless for stuff like that.
---
Only two junk types will save weight when bulked: Lead and Aluminum. All other junk types weigh exactly the same as their components, or weigh more!
---
Aisle 5
---
Also thank you for being transparent about ditching your commitment to ‚Äúcosmetic only‚Äù monetisation in favour of my ‚Äúutility‚Äù based purchases. Now where do you want us to bend over?
---
I buy camp items with the earned atoms I've saved up, but I don't actually spend really money in the atom shop.
---
That's why it got downvoted, Bloodied players want to deny there are mechanics that let them help other people.
---
I'm not spreading anything. It's my opinion and how i feel about it. If you don't agree, that's fine.
---
You need to add 76 after marketplace.
---
it may be only a trickle right now, but new players, somewhere in the world, are just stepping out into the Appalachian wasteland. For them, it's a seemingly endless horizon of content.
---
 Bringing new players into the fold is always priority number one. Shutting things down would be a mistake.
---
Older players like myself, and most of the readers here, can simply drop in from time to time to see what's going on, but focus on some other game til the new DLC drops.
---
You can fast travel out of the zone though
---
It's because you have granades eq.uipped
---
I have been frequenting this subreddit for a while and i have seen nobody asking for more utility items. Where do they get that info?
---
Done. The last question i hit other and said the purveyor 50% off sale is rigged to drop utter garbage.
---
Their comment said it won‚Äôt impact gameplay anymore than things that hve already been released.... what exactly are we supposed to freak out about?
---
They should give us a DXP weekend for all this.
---
If they want to fix it in any regards here is what I say:
---
\- Alternative 1: Slash prices in half across the board. Sure they wouldn't be making money as fast per item, but they would be seeing more sales across the board as players would be more willing to spend on the shop
---
\- Alternative 2: Keep prices about the same with some exceptions such as Power Armor paintjobs which need to be at least cut in half. Then have every event pay out 10-20 atoms. Point being, easier ways to gain atoms. (they have mentioned they will be reviewing the challenges and ways to earn atoms)
---
[deleted]
---
I'm excited for the release of private servers. What hilarious way of fucking up will they come up with this time!?
---
I spent my 1000 scrip and got maybe 1 or 2 somewhat decant drops, but no god roll weapons though.
---
Never had that problem tbh, yeah sure I did spawn in a nuke zone couple of times but I didn't take any rad dmg for like 2 minutes after I could control my character so I was able to easily walk / fast travel out of there even while being spawned in the middle of it
---
They never said items will be pay to win. If anything they‚Äôre just going to be adding additional items like the fridge &amp; scavenger Station that has a use in game ..
---
Thanks for the pm. Indeed, it is a worry. But disabling the server removes that choice. Dropping like flies is people exercising that right. As for new content, I, along with most would rather a late content, with less bugs than one that's rushed and unplayable. Besides, I need the time to find an aaffr fixer üòÅ
---
because people who still play this game are a bunch of morons.
---
Actually it is market.... then 76, no place
---
And lower prices. A skin shouldn't cost the Equivalent of 15 US Dollars.
---
Lol. Sorry yeah you‚Äôre right, oh wonder you can‚Äôt find it with people like me.
---
You just said you played it... yes is playable. If you played it you should know if it‚Äôs worth ¬£19 for you. I have fun with it. It everyone is different
---
It's coincidental, I was thinking about playing this game again today after giving it up for 3 months, and the first thing I see as browse Beth.net is an article of Bethesda going back on their promise...
---
This is an imbecilic idea. There is zero merit to it for players or company. In my personal opinion I feel this is just a foul ruse to insult the game and garner self attention. The pre-mentioning of expected down voteing to elicit pity also leads me to this conclusion.

Even looking through those outfits man some of them are like 5-6 of the same things just reskinned.. not that some of them don‚Äôt look good but where‚Äôs the imagination? These are *PREMIUM* items. We pay actual money for multiple suits with different skins or like 6 jumpsuits (which I guess isn‚Äôt as bad because technically the WS, WP &amp; Camo jumpsuit are sought out outfits in-game. I just think they can do way better for items I‚Äôm spending my money on. Those should just be in the game. Like you should be able to buy the Mr. Fuzzy jumpsuit for the Mr. Fuzzy tokens &amp; the Robco or Red Rocket one should be available from dailies or maybe like Feed the People you could get the Robco one from since barely anyone does it unless they need food lol
---
1 guy,literally only 1 guy lost it. That's bot even a statistic.
---
You're a dick.
---
Telling other people how the game is "meant" to be played and "glad this died on new". If you knew anything about Fallout, you'd know it caters to any and all playstyles, including the OP. There is no "right" or "wrong" way to play Fallout, and you're snarky little backhanded compliments "I'm glad you like wandering around doing nothing, that's cool" are insulting.
---
Not every thread on this sub has to be BETH THIS GAME SUX FIX IT! Plenty of people find fun in it, despite the flaws.
---
#CanIHaveYourStuff
---
Everything nowadays encourages bad game design. The biggest of them are the corporations like Zenimax who want money like others: EA, Blizzard, and others. 
---
Ever since games were able to do day one fixes the goal posts have moved. The main problem is that a lot of player are yelling about stuff after the move. 
---
We should get ahead of this but sadly I believe it is close to impossible today. The only way is to stop buying games from all companies and go with nothing but indie games. Even that though has massive pitfalls.
---
Ultimately we as gamers need to back the good behavior and show with our wallets that this isn't something we want. 
---
Myself, I have several things off the atomic shop but I proudly will say that since beta i have never purchased atoms, only got them from the achievements. I will continue this way until a new game comes along to take my attention.
---
I have enjoyed the Fallout universe but if this will be the future, it will be time to move on.
---
thats what they do these days create problems sell solutions
---
I don't think it's that big of a deal. The collectron gives scrapped junk. Nothing you can't get in 15mins running through most places. It's not like Bethesda is putting the best weapons &amp; armor in the game in the Atom shop.
---
yep i just wished it was part of a quest reward/ sell skins for it not the whole item
---
Exactly, if everybody buys the same premium item, then there's a problem with the game. They create a problem and sell the solution. That wouldn't be a problem if this game was FTP. But most of us paid the 60$ and still we need to pay for in game items.
---
Great advice!
---
It was during the E3 this year iirc ,you should be able to find it on youtube. One of the devs said they were about to release raids(which happened) and that they would consider doing more depending on the feedback of it.  Then you have raid challenges pointing at the fact next raid will be vault 96.
---
PSN: Juggabear13.
---
Done! Youtubers get better dropsüòÜ.
---
What about the 7600 hours??
---
YONGOUT!
---
Whether small or large, it's still a buyable advantage over other players. The collection station essentially allows a player to harvest resources from an area where there isn't a junk resource node, meaning this buyable item can allow a player to farm up to (the equivalent of) 3 nodes at once, which a player without atoms is limited to a maximum of only 2.
---
Yea same but the atom grind slows down a lot in the end game. Not gonna complete a list of boring chores for days to get some flower pots. Who has the time?
---
&gt;Having persistent game servers go offline for more than maintenance is seen as a death knell.
---
Except with Final Fantasy XIV.
---
&gt; More players would be permanently lost from extended server death than a content drought. 
---
If that were true, then Wastelanders isn't that much of a draw then. 
---
Are you seriously suggesting that a DLC that features things people have been asking for WELL before the launch of the game a la human NPCs, dialogue and "meaningful" choices, wouldn't be enough pull and we'll lose more people just from the servers going down than we'd get back with Wastelanders? Really?
---
Wastelanders isn't just any DLC. If we were waiting on Nuclear Winter, I'd probably agree with you. With Wastelanders though, I would not be at all surprised if it gets some of the strongest haters who have refused to play the game since launch to give it a go. At the very least keep a watchful eye on how the reviews play out.
---
Maybe it's just me but, with all due respect, your idea that we'd permanently lose more players from offline servers and they wouldn't come back to check out Wastelanders just seems farcical on the face of it.
---
The cosmetic only atomic shop was Designed To Fail. 
---
That way they can still be the good guy while going back on a promise at launch and claim cosmetic only will never work and we better get used to pay to win from here on out
---
Nothing else explains $18 dollar skins
---
Feel free to add me, Crocker2k8. I'm lvl 78(ish) I can chaperone you on some quests and missions if you want
---
No, it's the pricing. if the skins were 10 cents everyone would buy them
---
It is currently +5 HP per point of endurance, starting at 250 HP, so it is a range of 250-320 for an endurance of 1-15, or up to 28% improvement over the minimum. By contrast, the starting health at level 1 is much lower in Fallout 4, but it is affected more by endurance. It is probably not a popular idea, but something like a range of 180-320 or 110-320 HP (10 or 15 per point of endurance) would make the attribute less of a "dump stat" that most people do not bother increasing beyond a few points.
---
Does it have to be either or? Can it be both or none of the above?
---
Private servers in of itself isn't a greed play. We requested it. Whether it's greedy or not purely comes down to how they monetise it. If the Atom Store is any indication, then yeah, maybe. However, we just don't know yet.
---
Same too with better gaming experience? Better how? Might be better for those who want an RP-only server or PvP only server. Might be less so for others who want to see and interact with different people.
---
Explosive shotguns are still ok but not op. I have an AAE pumpy and it does its job, but I prefer my 1* bloodied .50.
---
The game is still buggy. You‚Äôll crash, disconnect for no reason, be forced to relog to use certain features properly, etc. it‚Äôs fun but it has a long way to go and Bethesda are clearly slacking.
---
U need to understand that nobody actually buys any of these things aside from a select few. Most people you prob see with fridges and bots simply had atom's to spare from the challenges. Thats y they are being more aggresive with the P2W, and taking a PR nose dive. If people dont keep buying (which they arent), the game ultimately fails regardless of DLC. Here is some points for you.
---
1. Game Performance over Camp Items and Cosmetics: Because the way items are tracked, everytime they add more stuff for camps and outfits, the game gets worse and worse. This is a never ending spiral of performance issues, and unless Beth fixes this, the game will eventually be overworked beyond the ability for any console to deal with it. This imo is a huge factor in the delay of Wastelander. The game looks great on a developers super computer, but then u realize that a regular PS4 literally vomits when u install the update.
---
2. Stash Limit and Camp Budget: Directly proportional to #1. Most players have their Camp Budget filled to Max, and stash limit is allways an issue, regardless of how well you manage it. The sale going on right now highlights this. This actually prevents players from purchasing Camp Items and Outfits, due to the fact theres no place to put them. Theres no point spending ur hard earned atoms, if u cannot place anything in ur camp.
---
3. Skins are the only thing that actually sells, but once u have a skin that covers ur desired items, u dont need to buy anymore.
---
4. Due to points #2 and #3 Beth see's no option but to sell u P2W items. They put u between a rock and a hard place, to force u to buy them. Their failure in this regard is by making it fair for us believe it or not. Improved Repair Kits can be obtained be defeating the SBQ, and all high level players must have like 150 on them each time. Not to mention, the perk cards for weapon and armor, mimics the effect of the repair kits, so theres no reason at all to purchase them.
---
5. The second attemp was with scarp kits. This benefit is so miniscule, that theres absolutely no reason to buy these. These only rlly work in survival mode, because of the lack of fast travel, and even then, its just junk. U can dump it, and not rlly suffer much for it.
---
6. Realizing point #4 and #5, Beth added the scarp bot and fridge, with no free alternative. Or atleast thats what they predent they did. While seeing moderate success because of low level players unaware of their free alternatives. Good with salt and the backpack mimic the fridge. Theres no benefit in storing food in camps, so the fridge is useless. In addition, the scrap bot is literaly the same, or worse than a junk pile found in the world. Players with camps place in junk piles have no need for the scrap bot.
---
7. With #6 explaining their short commings on their supposive P2W items, ehich rlly arent considering theres free alternatives, Beth finds itself needing to double down on P2W or risk the financial failure that F76 has brought them. If F76 were to stop production, itll be a massive failure and financial loss for the company as a whole. They have no option but to commit to their failure, else stain their reputation so bad,it might affect their massive projects lile TES6 and Starfield.
---
Ya sarcasm and cynicism tends  to make people laugh when done right.
---
The disintegrator would be sweet.
---
Again not the point.  Point is that attitude has nkw given Bethesda the motivation to add FAR more because they look at the shop and see that the gamers are buying the non cosmetics like mad.
---
What player base? This game is all but abandoned and runs a skeleton crew staff for the few remaining players to push out only the content they had worked on before the game launches
---
Are you on console or PC? I need to do the same things :')
---
I've yet to meet the good fellow.üôÉ
---
-Done right-
---
Ya I tend to come on reddit to vent.  Currently I love destiny 2, dragons dogma, code vein, and dying light.  All games that dont have predatory insane Mxt and actually have full content.  Destint 2 was absolutely shit with Activision and I didnt play it till now
---
But I‚Äôm one of the elite ;)
---
We arent all perfect all the time
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs paying for more progress on the game. If you don‚Äôt want these things then don‚Äôt buy them. I don‚Äôt and have no problem with those that do. If it‚Äôs a game to be played for years to come as Bethesda has said then they have to monetize going forward with things like this.
---
That mutant would quite happily have thrown you in a cage, and then either eaten you while laughing with its brothers over how weak you were before eating you alive. So don't feel too sad.
---
PC
---
bloodied anything is in demand. you should sell it as long as its not 20lbs
---
He's referring to the statement saying they're going to add more utility items, which I feel is an umbrella term to cover paying for private servers.
---
I'm already first in line, I can't **wait** to buy a private server. I am quite literally amped for that release.
---
brothers?    Though all super mutants were girls
---
They can‚Äôt even fix the most simple bugs in the game. I‚Äôm really not looking forward to any future games from them.
---
They originally broke the cosmetic promise early this year in spring time, there was backlash from the community, but people caved and bought the items, as states in the article, the non cosmetic items are the best sellers in the atom shop, if people were truly outraged about these items, they shouldn‚Äôt have purchased them, I didn‚Äôt believe it was right for them to be in the game so I didn‚Äôt spend my atoms on them. Bethesda tested the waters with small utility items and people responded by giving them money, we can‚Äôt now blame Bethesda for implementing more utility items when we had the power to make it a not profitable pursuit
---
Yes.  And again I say congrats add your name to the lineup behind the sign "reasons to make our games utter shit and sell ridiculous items and pricing to stupid as hell gamers."  
---
Alap fyi I say all this because I love fallout and used love bethesda and it sucks that gamers are so blind to the reality of what companies do.  And I'll never blame a company for making tons kf money.  It isn't Bethesda's fault its ours.
---
#2 is the biggest one I see. It's self defeating. Here's a minuscule stash and build budget. Look here! Stuff to buy for real $$ but we won't give you any space to build it. 
---
Here's free display cases! But it's going to eat into your already small stash. 
---
I know it's a performance issue increasing these but I don't see how this wasn't caught early in development that small build budget didn't work with selling things to build.
---
Or implement via a quest.  Make it ugly and sell skins for it
---
I have the plan not shaw when i got it but I made a fixer today and noticed i had 50 out off 56 mods for it, damage was 107 but I only have 2 perk cards with I level each.
---
^
---
Or allow everyone more build space so we can actually use the stuff in the shop
---
Here's a tip, use a garage door, I do, whenever I'm nearing the cap limit I turn off Vendors and the garage door so it can't open up

EXACTLY MY POINT!! I HATE it when people do that it brings in a draft dude I've made a habit of closing any door I come across and if I'm exiting or entering a building I'll close the door but way I do it is slightly look at the door so the prompt comes up and it does feel pretty smooth
---
&gt; the fact that black powder rifles that was used in the Civil War does three times the damage as a futuristic plasma weapon
---
Well when you put it that way it does sound absolutely absurd, lol.
---
I understand people get upset about pay to win type items, but have any of the items they've released been pay to win?  
---
People paid approximately $60 or less for the game a year ago.  How is Bethesda supposed to pay their employees to work on a game that doesn't add new revenue.  
---
There's a smaller segment of players actually buying atoms and helping pay the bills.  Bethesda has given me enough atoms, where i can purchase all convenience items without paying, how is this bad?  If someone chooses to get Liberty Prime power armor instead of a scavenger collector that's their choice to make.
---
I'd rather see expansions you have to buy than microtransactions.
---
If I made more money I'd probably buy stuff and not even complain about it.
---
But being honest, most people didn't spend money on them. People bought them because they were cheap compared to the prices that Bethesda usually issued on their stuff, and so people used their collection of Atoms (which would have otherwise been spent on pointless cosmetics) and decided to actually buy something beneficial. Seeing Bethesda willingly continue down this path instead of stopping it is the concerning part, we have no idea what they could add next, and that scares me for 76s future.
---
It would make more sense to turn off power to the vendors AND lock the door, so people don't waste their time hopping around to closed shops.
---
Judging from comments I hope Bethesda grand theft auto this game and makes it the biggest cash in possible.  Clearly that's what fallout 76 fans want most
---
Game loads fine now with a ssd drive. I play on Xb1x. Before it's take like 30 secs to fast travel from place to place. Now it's less than 10 secs. My camp loads in fast too and so do all of the places I go to. Going to the queen mid fight is just fine. Before I'd have to wait for players an enemies to load in. Now everything is there before I'm even able to move. Ssd drive solves a lot of this games loading issues.
---
Maybe change that Bethesda? Should be this games tag line.
---
What apprentice job? 
---
When I was apprenticing to be a carpenter I was making $28 an hour. 
---
If you are a skilled anything you had better be making more than half minimum wage
---
I try to look through my stash and inventory every once in a while. I'll accumulate too much of one thing like stimpacks or have accidental pickups like missiles, or forget to drop mainframe cores.
---
The game tells hundreds if not more stories like this. ‚ô•
---
When in doubt attack someone with a different opinion. You need to understand that these add ins have been and will continue to be useless. Even if they add ammo scrap machines and whatever else who cares? My point is that Bethesda has to keep the boy afloat and the atom shop does that. Without the atom shop they wouldn‚Äôt continue to work on 76 at all.
---
Along with the cap limit.
---
LOL! This is pretty funny. Maybe it's just me but you might want to check your projection.
---
Ok, if there's zero merit in the idea, bearing in mind shutting down the server and relaunching the game later did wonders for Final Fantasy XIV so there actually is some provable merit to the idea, what's the merit of keeping the servers online with little meaningful content for likely up to 5 months, give or take?
---
I'll start you off. New players get to play. Easy. Agreed. Existing players can kit out their characters in full to get the all the right perks and legendary gear just the way they want. Cool.
---
Then what? What merit is there to keep the servers going?
---
People on the sub are already concerned about considerable player drop off due to the delays and are begging for Bethesda to keep drip feeding content like adding more weapons and armour (even though history has shown they're real stingy when it comes to that). Without an organised group of friends, we're already seeing it's considerably harder for the average player to do Arktos or Vault raids now. If players do drop off further as we go, this only gets worse.
---
I'm sure that you could come up with countless examples of where dying servers with lower player counts leads to the eventual close of the game. up to 5 months (and I would hazard likely more given Bethesda love for delays) is a very long time to go for a live service game with no substantive new content.
---
Minimum wage for an apprentice in 2019 is ¬£3.90
---
No doubt. I think that‚Äôs a huge step in the right direction.
---
Seriously. Make lots of skins for weapons people use. Handmades, 50 Cals, etc
---
Along with lowered prices. $5 for a backpack skin or even $15-18 for a PA skin is a bit much.
---
Yup.  Poor bethesda needs the 20 dollars for a paint job or they will sadly...go out of business.  Its nkt the fact that they made a shitty but ridden featureless cash grab...no it's that we as gamers dont understand the sad plight of Bethesda and how badly they need our funds just to feed their starving children.  You have changed my mind I will now go spend 1/3 of the price of AAA games so I can put a pink paint on 1...yes 1 peice of power armor.
---
I see your puppy okay with Bethesda lying out of their fucking asshole about non cosmetic items not being in the atomic shop
---
We are already there, it's just that Beth doesn't get the money.
---
Legendaries are sold all over.
---
See the way I see it a clean stop is an active move by the devs that can give the impression they're all hands on deck for the next DLC.
---
It wouldn't be just stopping the servers and that's it. That'd be a terrible PR move. It'd be stop the servers and have a supporting PR message about focusing attention on next DLC so game will go into hiatus until the big launch later.
---
Seeing a game slowly bleed out players has been the deathrattle of many live service games. Some decent ones too like Battleborn. That's my concern. It's also a concern shared by many in the sub as you may have noticed.
---
In my eyes, ones a decisive action to focus, the other is a game that's dying that can only frustrate current players you want more content and bugs to be fixed.
---
But that's just my opinion.
---
Where did you get that info?
---
That's $5 American. 2 and a half dollars below minimum wage and less than half of the modern living wage.  Its literally illegal to pay someone that little. 
---
And again, what apprentice are we talking about? If you are even slightly practiced in a skilled profession you could easily find someone to pay you more than that. 
---
Hell, McDonalds pays almost double that.
---
Why? Just look at the karma of your post.
---
Everytime this comes up the poster get downvoted into oblivion.
---
Idk it seems kinda greedy of us. Like you said. We already paid for the game. We got exactly what we paid for.
---
The injured super mutant can even tell you to run away, you know somethings wrong when a super mutant is screaming at you to run away.
---
I don‚Äôt feel like there is enough uproar about this, there is a sudden acceptance for this as if we knew it was coming and we should be okay with it. No one and I mean no one asked for anything to be locked behind the atom store at the very least I feel as if they could have a put the item in the game and pay for skins  to ‚Äúkeep the free content going‚Äù  and trust I know that has been mentioned more then a few times here but now it‚Äôs just a  whole ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs a weird way to ask for micro transactions‚Äù from Bethesda and that‚Äôs just BS  I am okay with waiting for wastelands to be polished but if the MTXs in between now and release of Wastelanders spiral out of control like ammo conversions and what not end up in the store and ruin the state of the current game. WTH am I looking forward to? A really F‚Äôd up feeling that‚Äôs what.
---
Look up "minimum wage 2019 UK" scroll down to the areas that have other questions then tap the one that says minimum wage for apprentice I'm assuming its low end jobs as I've seen some apprentice jobs go for at least ¬£8 an hour if not more and many vary quite wildly and I know it's illegal but that's what I found out when looking up about minimum wage when I turned 21
---
I'm confused on your point? First, what is pay to play currently in the atom shop?  Secondly I feel like if people want to spend their money on stupid repair kits and junk collectors, who cares. Do people on this sub actually believe Bethesda cares if you do or don't want quote unquote pay to play items? The VAST majority of players of any game aren't on Reddit and don't give a shit.  
---
Btw for the whiners that complain repair kits are pay to play, if you fight the queen daily, as most of us do, you'll have countless repair kits just collecting dust. And the scrap collectors dont get much. I can get more in an hour of scrap hunting.
---
I'd gladly pay for the FO4 junk wall pieces, the wall options in 76 just look so out of place in the world.
---
I'd also spend my atoms on faction camp items. Not just signs and flag though. I mean actual faction objects and structures.
---
And by the way, I just looked it up. In the UK at least they are only allowed to pay you that little if you are under 18 and presumably living with your parents. 
---
By the way, that's pretty fucked up you guys determine minimum wage based on age and not skill level.
---
The price is to high I agree with that. Aside from that the items are pointless and it‚Äôs nothing to lose sleep over. No one is forcing you to buy anything soooo.... just don‚Äôt. Here‚Äôs another thing for you, Bethesda releasing all the DLC for free covers you a few atoms. They have to make money one way or the other either selling the DLC or in game purchases.
---
Bethesda doesn't listen anyway what's the use?
---
Mainframe cores, what are those?
---
I think standard zetans are in the game. Might be wrong though.
---
Yeah, I agree and I believe that's the reason
---
So do you think that it would have been better for a game like Final Fantasy XIV to have kept their servers online and provided no content until their relaunch?
---
We know from how well they did after shutting down their servers and relaunching clean that it was very successful for them.
---
Take the new player idea. If you were a new player and you entered a game that seemed to be devoid of a lot of players, you run into content that you just can't do due to the lack of players, do you think that's a good thing?
---
Admittedly, it'd be great for the first maybe 40-50 levels. Plenty of content to churn through, most of it you can do solo. Maybe better with fewer players. Less competition, less leg. 
---
After that though...?
---
My goodness is full of a bunch of babies.  Do you seriously spend time worrying about pay for play in video games?
---
I'm not entirely sure Bethesda even does 'polish stages'.
---
Weren't they datamined or included in the official guide? I remember hearing about different ranks of Zetans.
---
if they were to give us stuff like that, you people would immediately throw a shitfit like you did with the collectron and the fridge.
---
Yeah I see that. No problem from me on that if someone wants to pay 20$ for a virtual laser rifle lol
---
Do j worry my hobby of choice is being ruined? Yes I do.
---
Why should we now trust something they say?
---
First they said it will only be cosmetics, then they went back on that, what gives you the assurance that they keep to their word now?
---
It doesn't matter if they're pay-to-win or not if they are only available to the atomic shop and not being able to be earned in the game then Bethesda can go fuck itself
---
Still boring if you're high level. Wait for Wastelanders.  I'm playing The Last of Us, which is currently free on ps4. The awesome graphics and storyline has made me completely forget about FO76
---
Yup far harbor was 30 dollars.  Big expansion.  1 paint is 20.  I'd rather pay 30 for a big expansion and no pay walla for extra content.  But clearly fallout 76 fans LOVE giving bethesda their money.  So you giys have fun with that.  I'll be back once they add paid mods and more pay to win to say I told you so again ans witness the dumpster fire of new defenses
---
&gt; Why don't you just quit until wastelanders comes out. Problem solved. 
---
Already there dude. I quit months ago actually. Around patch 10 or 11, just before the massive issues with the PA rework (thankfully dodged that bullet!).
---
The servers being online or offline don't affect me personally in the slightest. That's not even the goal of this post. As mentioned, it's a point of discussion I thought was interesting. 
---
Shutting down the servers worked for Final Fantasy XIV. Why not Fallout 76? Many dying servers have killed off franchises outright. Why not nip it in the bud?
---
I mean this with sincerity because I feel like this conversation has not really been had in a civil way, at least not that I have seen.  And I am not referring to the emotional honesty of your post.  I get it, and venting is therapeutic sometimes.  Also venting can have little to no truth to it, or all the truth in the world.  Although you were obviously perturbed when writing it, lol, pretty much everything you said was factual.  The one thing that I was not sure about, though, is the term ‚Äúpay-to-win.‚Äù  I understand basically what you mean, but what is so bad about having something like a fridge for sale in your opinion?
---
Thanks Todd!!
---
I doubt we'll ever see wastelanders. The game engine is way too old for much of the content that they are proposing.
---
Still No, you already got 16 times the detail with this game. Uncle Todd has been good to us.
---
Because our life doesn't revolve around a video game. Go outside.
---
I don't mind the cosmetics in Atomic shop. But utility items should be added as a reward in the game for bypassing broken survival systems and unnecessary grinding (which was prolonged by updates in the past). Bethesda created the problem and now they want to add the solution behind atoms.
---
If karma was my top priority, I wouldn't have made this post.
---
I did look it up. It says that minimum wage under 18yo is 4.35. 
---
¬£8.21 is if you are over 25yo. That's only just over $10. That's crazy. I made more than that working at Pizza Hut part time in high school 25 years ago. For a skilled profession (even just starting) that's crazy low. 
---
Of course, I have no idea what your standard living expenses are comparatively, but the living wage is about the same so that's pretty weak.
---
??
---
Your life doesn't have to revolve around something for you to have an opinion or question about it.
---
Yup build sounds about the same. Its fun but not strong
---
'I'd rather pay 14$ for a skin'
---
The only way that we won't see Wastelanders is if Bethesda goes bankrupt or they kill the game outright. 
---
I just don't see either happening. Who knows though, right?
---
Also people would have said the same thing about the old engine and multiplayer but it's doing it. Somewhat wonkily but it is mostly doing its job.
---
Have you seen outlaw star?
---
Im talking specialized ammo types like in new vegas
---
I‚Äôve had this happen way to often. Whitespring and Morgantown. 
---
Let‚Äôs see, bloodied build, I don‚Äôt carry rad-x as it jacks up my mutations. I only carry diluted radaway. And I die before I can get either a hazmat or PA on. 
---
I usually just abandon any junk I was carrying and spawn elsewhere. Maybe on another server. The only time I try and get my junk back is if I happen to be carrying something cool I had planned to display.
---
And here i thought that the idea of in-game shops were inherently anti-consumer to begin with. It inevitably results in the garbage behavior from developers that we are seeing now.
---
I literally said I haven‚Äôt bought anything lmao. I‚Äôm not defending the cost I‚Äôm saying that one way or the other you will be paying for something.
---
More pay to win? I‚Äôm sure that robot is really doing a lot for you lmao
---
Wow a balanced approach.  Sorry for my salt I was writing it and I new I would get crazy fan boys who cant understand they are causing these issues, attack me.  
---
Pay to win in my opinion is paying money tk gain advantage.  If you define it by actually winning the game then no it's not.  But you can spend real world money to gain an advantage in the game and to me that's pay tk win.  
---
Here are my issues, your correct in saying a fridge being sold isnt a big deal.  Here is the bjg deals 
---
1. They promised to never sell non cosmetic.  I tend to admire and love honorable business and honorable people.  These people are dirty liars and we should give lying business our money it motivates  them to lie more
---
2. All other fallout games had 5 dollar dlc where you can literally build entire vaults or manufacturing systems...and now a fridge costs 7 dollars.  Pathetic cash grab
---
3. Fridge was a feature requested by community.  An in game feature no a paid item.  When the community reads "no non cosmetic mxt" and then asks for fridges they clearly were saying "hey can you add this in it would be cool"  not "hey can you sell me that fridge for more money than a fallout 4 dlc."
---
4. Buying this fridge shows bethesda the community wants more non cosmetic items.
---
I'll copy this message when they add paid mods.  Enjoy your fleecing

Friend was having the exact same issue tonight.
---
In the nuclear silo you have to remove damaged cores and replace them but you get 15 damages ones in your inventory if you choose to find rather than fix them. They weigh quite a bit. 3 or so maybe
---
I could care less about paid mods. Go buy an EA game and then talk to me about pay to win.
---
You can get a low level one.
---
I have all these, you can have them for free. My PSN is CalFitz2112
---
Congrats for being the smartest guy or whatever?
---
Much like many others, a bloodied handmade or fixer.
---
You can get 570 atoms a week doing those chores.  Many of them are very quick and/or can be done while doing other things eg killing 5 radants or drinking a nukacherry.
---
They won‚Äôt count towards the challenge unless you find them at the spawn point.
---
Well, sure, I think they are balancing on the edge of what is okay or not BUT I simply don't have the god damn energy to be upset about it. It's only a game, and it's not a top tier competitve pure PvP-game that all the 14-year olds play so I don't think it really matters. People go apeshit over a junk collecting robot, or a fridge that prolongs the durability of food. I mean, really, you can literally pick this shit up from the ground from everywhere, I'm drowning in it! Of course they were going to creep closer and closer to introducing these kind of QoL items along the way since it's an obvious market for it, it's money we're talking about, NO company are going to just let an opportunity like this pass by without justifying reasons to tap in to it. Are you really surprised? I mean, fuck it, there are other games out there. When they start to sell scrip for atoms it's probably time to leave, but up until then I just won't bother raging about this. I'm more concerned about the bugs that never gets fixed, or even more sadly - old bugs coming back and them prioritizing atom shop issues over month old bugs. That's a real outrage.
---
Stealth, poison resistance, +1 strength.
---
Idk ask them
---
What do you care about their company image
---
I dont purchase any games with over the top Mxt or developers who have clear agendas
---
I should say I dont anymore.  I've smartened up
---
I get that some stuff should be free, but if a game is going to continue for years it has to have a cash flow. I still dont get why people dont understand this. No one is forcing you to buy stuff and none of it is needed or puts anyone above someone else.
---
Anything that allows me not to blow myself up with my be laser
---
I didn‚Äôt see ‚Äúhalf-baked and teeming with Hep A‚Äù when I looked at the menu.
---
I don't think we got what we paid for. There are still bugs in the game and lack of content. Are you really fine with paying additional $10 or more (DLC price for other games) for just one utility item that bypasses broken logic ingame? I think it should be free.
---
I got a suit at level 10 though?
---
Isn't this terrible?!  I know that the first time I had this encounter, I just VATS-shot from a billion miles away and then found the bodies and wondered what had come through which could kill them like this (didn't bother to look at their inventories).  The SECOND time, the bodies surprised me, I found the quills in their possession, and then the injured super mutant came out of the trees and I could hear him talking.  I felt SOOOOO bad once I realized what the scenario was knowing I'd killed the lone survivor the first time.
---
You get the woopsies from diseased mirelurk spawn. 
---
I got it by going to that quarry right above Watoga. There is a queen in the water. When she comes out, have her follow you up to the buildings nearby. You'll have to clear out the other mobs that spawn in the area first though. 
---
Then sit in the building to hide from the Quden's acid spit. She'll start to send out babies. Kill any that arn't diseased. Then just sit there letting the diseased ones munch on you for a while. You'll get the woopsies sooner or later.
---
Some utility items should be free sure, but it has to have an income to continue and we need people buying these items. Some people saying its p2w is them either jumping on the bandwagon or a skewed sense of entitlement.
---
In comparison Bethesda has been a model of doing what is good for the fans. Call of duty is massive game and you pay to get the best guns in multiplayer.
---
Adding grind and nerfing stuff in the game is passively forcing you to buy utility items. I won't buy them anyways because I won't even play the game if it's gonna go this way.
---
Just short of 317 strait days
---
 Unyielding Sentinel with AP, Strength, etc. is what you want to target.
---
Isn‚Äôt that the AI or whatever that oversees over Vault 51‚Äôs NW mode to choose the next overseer??
---
I will add you as soon as I get home after kids sports games. Thank you so much!!
---
Absolute truth right here.
---
Yeah, you loose the caps if that happens. Pretty stressful.
---
Bethesda used to be.  This last year has proven Bethesda is going EA route.  Every game has been a terrible cash grab garbage heap.  I hope they change but thags exactly why I harp on these issues.  They will never change if the people buying their games dont stop being idiots and actually stop buying this shit.
---
Yes, you lose all of the caps after the 30k limit. This is why a lot of players have their vendors in rooms that can be locked.
---
I‚Äôve always had to buy my good weapons and armor. Never from a drop or mmmrrph.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/ZAX](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/ZAX)
---
Because they've made some of my favourite games and despite the shit I give them, I don't want to see them fall.
---
We just need them to lower the cost of atoms really. The items are kinda cool at times.
---
People want to make their own worlds with their own rules and the ability to fix the bugs they prioritize, with custom mods and the ability to create their own content, all while playing with their community of friends or like-minded individuals. Also the ability to actually provide support or service to their personal server community, like being able to have private-server-only characters and finding exploiters/cheaters right away instead of waiting for Bethesda to take action.
---
Hardly any of those points can be accomplished via renting a server from Bethesda. If it launches like people assume, at most, it'll feel just like a big party system, but you're still at the mercy of any server-side issues that Bethesda currently has, including .
---
Imagine being able to play a whole story campaign similar to New California (New Vegas prequel community-created content mod) with the Fallout 76 co-op system. Or maybe there's that one thing in Fallout 76 you don't like that could be modified on a private server, like Perk Cards and SPECIAL points being reset-able at a custom NPC the server host can make. Or maybe you want every Grafton Monster modified to be Thomas the Steam Engine barreling down Appalachia in search of all those jerks that build their bases too close to the train stations. There's a lot of really creative things that people can do with a self-hosted private server that tickles the inner creative bone.
---
I got it randomly. Didn't know it was difficult. The only one I had trouble with was the Woopsies. 
---
The wiki says sludge lung comes from being in toxic air environments and diseased wendigos. 
---
I would just go stand in that forest in the Bog that rains shit on you constantly. Eventually you are bound to get it.
---
Most of the people who won't tolerate these practices have moved on so what you are left with is people who WANT non-cosmetics. Go over to the GTAV subreddit and you will see noone complaining about how the game is p2w.
---
Not that I'm upset as of yet, but I could see paying for convenience (or being given too convenience for free for that matter) negativity affecting the game. The playerbase selling resources back and forth so that everybody wins and everyone can make caps by specializing in something seems obviously better than making resource collection automatic at significant scale. I know a lot of people want a market where everyone is selling nothing but end-game legendaries and say managing resources is boring as hell, but is this really what they would want? A survival game being somewhat inconvenient just makes sense.
---
I am not saying that these items are p2w. I don't think they are or maybe just in some extreme cases. I just want to point out that utility items can fix some fundamental issues with the game and asking money for them is unacceptable.
---
Is that for real?
---
you know who change settings in files? i changed some things on fallout76Prefs but nothing changed in game
---
That's like...your opinion man
---
The most insidious aspect of all of this for me is that they're taking an idea that we've come up with to improve the game and then selling it back to us.
---
That's this new Bethesda for you - making a profit off other people's ideas.
---
*Everyone* complains how P2W GTA has become... it's all people ever talk about on that sub...
---
Yer they definitely need to look at this, it is easy to stay out of there reach. We need some new strong scary monsters that can go were we go.
---
Well, as a programmer myself I can tell you that some of the bugs in that game (indeed the most game-breaking ones) are so deep-seeded they are probably unable to track down what's causing it. However, this is something that's as simple as tying a user login to reading a boolean.
---
Did you pay for that power armor skin or did someone glitch it to you with the power armor paint glitch?
---
How does Bethesda make money to pay server bills and employees for a game that's already released? Would adding a new quest for a scavenger bot add any money for them to pay the bills?
---
There's nothing Bethesda has added that your can't do already in some form or fashion.
---
Repair Kits have Improved Repair Kits
---
Refrigerator have Refrigerator backpack, Good with Salt
---
Scavenger bot put your camp on a junk pile (Is junk hard to get)
---
Scrap kits - you can make a simple base and move it around or go to a train station
---
Had a similar experience with nodding my Dark Rider PA the other day.  Strangely,  it only pops up on one of the pieces; the others behave normally.
---
If they lowered the cost by at minimum 75% and made all paint jobs apply to all armor and weapons.  And also added in 20x more cosmetics from in game activities I'd be quite happy.  But atoms arent the only issue.  Elder scrolls blades is a garbage cash grab shit show.  ESO while it's fun is also insanely littered with Mxt.  Wolfenstein went from being single player good game to garbage heap cash grab.  The trend bethesda is going is 100x balls deep EA Activision and it needs to stop.  I love fallout and elder scrolls and if these fool fans dont stop buying their shitty products those new games are also gonna be cash grab shit shows.

It's apart of the random public event system. You just gotta play and get lucky with it popping up.

I'm pretty sure it's random on the list of public events now.
---
Ok thanks
---
ZAX is the AI in charge of Vault 51. The announcer for Nuclear Winter.
---
There weren‚Äôt enough people buying their crappy  skins and costumes. 
---
What % of players have any interest in PA paints?
---
What % want painted regular armor (instead of wearing an outfit)
---
What % actually want the goofy looking costumes? (People running around with those giant heads on look absolutely stupid IMO and are usually asshat trolls)
---
What % bought that bundle only for the one item that isn‚Äôt available outside the bundle?
---
What % have bought any face tattoos? (Dumber than the giant heads)
---
Some of the outfits are cool. Some of the camp items are cool. Most aren‚Äôt. 
---
New good outfits and camp items come out so rarely, that once they‚Äôre bought, there‚Äôs no desire to buy anymore. 
---
Of course people are going to buy the QOL utility items. There‚Äôs hardly anything else worth buying.
---
I guess it depends on what I‚Äôm buying for $10. I‚Äôve bought atoms before but typically try not to spend any further money after I buy games. Just like fallout that much I guess. I purposely took this game slow, been playing since beta and still have things to do. I knew this was a game that I would want to play for years so I haven‚Äôt rushed to complete a thing. But yea we did get what we paid for. We definitely didn‚Äôt pay for something that didn‚Äôt even exist for months later. Maybe we have a bit of buyers remorse or we expected more. Def could use more support by Bethesda. It‚Äôs not like we don‚Äôt get free stuff.
---
I believe that is one of the public events now.  So it's going to be random when it starts.
---
Totally agree. If modding was supported I am sure mods with these utility items would be available for free. If they wouldn't also monetize other people's mods like they did with creation club.
---
If nothing is changing they wouldn't have needed to say anything at all.
---
I can't say that they all suck (even though it seems like recently they have been kinda sucky) but I can say that I am
---
1.) discouraged from puchases just based on the sheer cost it is to buy the right to have some pixels around my character and her CAMP
---
2.) Discouraged from making purchases because I have no more budget to put anything in my camp already.
---
That's not the cause. I don't use grenades so unless I need them for a challenge I never have any equipped.
---
Bethesda couldn't design their way out of a paper bag, even one on fire in fact.
---
I seriously wonder how many players have thought about how expensive it was to make and market these games.  Bethesda expected to make a ton of sales that never materialized and as a result need the atom shop to cover that loss.  Of that $60 people paid for this game BGS got very little.  Keeping the servers running takes money.
---
You can radiate yourself with a gamma gun? That makes sense but I had no idea! No more carrying around 30 glowing bloods for me!
---
Oh yeah, haven‚Äôt launched a nuke in quite a while so I forgot about that being a thing.
---
&gt; Mr Fuzzy was bugged the last time I checked.
---
Worked for me last I checked (last week).
---
&gt; You can‚Äôt put some foods in the fridge. For example you can put meat but not meals made with the same meat.
---
I've put grilled radstag in mine.
---
Neither bug is mentioned in https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d7yabb/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch/
---
You fool, don't you realize your fake interwebs points are at stake?!
---
Totally get it and you are right.  A fridge is not a big deal, and I personally don‚Äôt mind non-cosmetic items on huge rpgs like this that meet a certain value proposition for someone who may have too many work or family obligations to play much.  So in that case it is like they can at least enjoy the game.  Having said that,  you are also correct to point out that originally they said no non-cosmetic items, but also correct in saying that the community asked for this to be changed‚Äîvoting with their wallets.  I guess I think that we can‚Äôt complain that they are selling non-cosmetic items if we are purchasing them by the droves...lol...and to expand on that point, I have heard people often complain that Bethesda will not fix other bugs, but of course they work on the atomic shop.  But when you flip that around, they could say, ‚Äúour fan base is so interested in this aspect of the game that they are actually continuously investing money in it.‚Äù  In that case it would seem to them that the atomic shop was the most important thing overall to work on each week.  For you to say ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù is understandably a response to outcry.  Like, no one says ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù to a dismissible minority.   Having said that, I am in the service industry, and it never ceases to amaze me what people will say they pay for something and what they actually do.  If they are talking to the person from whom they purchased the service then they always error to believe they paid more than they did.  Not always, but like 95% of the time.  And if they are talking to anyone else, they say it cost much less.  People like to act as though they got a good deal or wouldn‚Äôt spend so much money on something.  I think this psychological nuance, if you will, is relevant.  Because I personally believe that most people, regardless of what they post, purchase stuff from the atomic shop.  They may say they never do or act like they purchase less, but the majority of people love to act like they have spend less money on things than they do, and they certainly want to feel like they have less than others.  It boosts their self-worth to feel like they don‚Äôt spend as much or can do more with less.   Anyway, just an observation that you are likely speaking to many people that lie to themselves as much as they lie to others.  Not in a really evil way...it‚Äôs just their, our, nature.
---
&gt; Im talking specialized ammo types like in new vegas 
---
I don't think it can work, due to the legendary system.
---
The issues with pistols are probably best fixed with perk changes and reciever upgrades (I want a .50 reciever for the Single Action Revolver and a double-action reciever for the .44). The non-damage Pistol perks are *weak*. Gun Runner, Modern Renegade and Packin' Light are all trash. 
---
Compare/contrast with the Enforcer, Skeet Shooter, Scattershot. Or Tank Killer, Ground Pounder and Tormentor. Or Bullet Shield, Lock and Load and One Man Army. Bear Arms is a similar perk, but it's a *whole lot more useful* with heavy weapons.
---
I only keep 100 of each junk type.  Check to make sure all the junk you have in there has been broken down.  Check your gunpowder I realized the other day I had 450 which was 45 lbs.  Excess meds also take up a lot of weight.
---
Let‚Äôs not overlook the fact that they likely lost a lot of money on this game since it was a flop compared to expectations.
---
" I'd be far more inclined to go shopping if they added some damn good shit and didn't charge the price of other game's DLC for it. "
---
exactly!
---
I hope bethesda reads this.  They wont.  But on the 1% chance they are they need to read this and not lie to our faces about "community has spoken they want more mxt"
---
Glitch happens as well when you break down weapons and get upgrades, it's really confusing at times.
---
I think I‚Äôll put most of my junk up for sale.
---
&gt; I understand people get upset about pay to win type items, but have any of the items they've released been pay to win? 
---
Yes, though "win" is all relative. 
---
It means you can stay in the SBQ fight longer without having to duck off to a workbench to repair your main weapon. Less time spent away from the fight means more XP, more loot e.g. flux components and more likelihood of scoring more legendary drops.
---
It's even more important in an instanced place like the Vault raids. Weapon goes down and you're stuck with whatever suboptimal weapon you can find within the vault or leave the vault and lose all progress. You can use the free ones you get from the SBQ but when you run out? Gotta SBQ again, which means less time spent on farming the vault.
---
Scrap kits are also of benefit in the vault raids too. Means you can score more junk and items per run, let alone the time saved in general of going to a stash box to clear out your inventory.
---
Each one of these advantages are small but they're clearly advantages. They all save you time and by saving you time, that means more XP, caps, junk and legendaries. Not that meaningful now but if once we get prestige systems and PvP working again, you'll see a stark difference with that advantage.
---
I found that one too, I think it tried to kill me so I shot it.
---
I don‚Äôt really understand what the argument is. Private servers, the collectron, the fridge, repair or scrap kits? What exactly is broken in the survival mechanic? Is it broken or just difficult or are we using those terms interchangeably?
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt get it
---
Purely speculation here but I imagine they will be adding the ammo converters soon on the shop as well as increased stash space and camp build limit.
---
Why do you care? If you don't want to play, don't play.
---
That's a risk I'm willing to take.
---
Nerfing what? Grind is a essential part of any mmo. Not sure what you mean, but junk and everything else is pretty easy to get. A few hours of farming and I have enough for days or a week if you know what spots to go to.
---
Because its fun
---
Because I looooove it. ü¶Ñ
---
And this is why we can't have nice things.
---
its not going to play itself
---
Order of Mysteries of course! It's one of the most outstanding quest lines in the game.

I haven't purchased anything except for the physical copy of the game last November. Everything I've gotten in the Atomic Shop has either been free or I've spent atoms that were earned while playing the game. And I still have close to 1000 atoms right now. Maybe I'm completely wrong, but I really don't see what the big deal is all about.
---
While wondering the forest northeast of vault 76 i came across a big natural slab stone that had a simple diamond cut engraved in it. Tried to find it again after my photos got deleted, gave up lmao but ita random and out there and I wanna know who did it and why
---
Well, for what its worth... When you respawn in a nuke zone, youve got something like 10 seconds of immortality where you can run your ass off Forrest Gump style out of the zone.
---
I feel like there‚Äôs a specific part of Bethesda‚Äôs fan base that this game is meant for. I for one love the game and honestly I understand the hate but if you really don‚Äôt care for the game then stop. No ones making you play nor is anyone making you bash it. Just forget it exists if it bothers you that much.
---
&gt; It's not like Bethesda is putting the best weapons &amp; armor in the game in the Atom shop.
---
Yet. We'll just have to wait and see.
---
extremely excellent writeup!  ur arguments have the virtues of being true and cogent.
---
That's fantastic Vic, thanks
---
Against junk mobs, it's serviceable.  It will cut through any type of Ghoul or unarmored enemy, no problem.  But it's not exactly a one-hit-kill, especially against Super Mutants.
---
The reason why people think the Buzz Blade is powerful is because they see what it does against the Scorchbeast Queen.  They stand there, watching her health bar melt, and assume they are the ones doing it.  But that's not the case - the dimmed chunk of the health bar that gets shaved off is the accumulation of *everyone's* damage since you started sawing, not exclusively yours.
---
Take a damn zero off your prices and I'll spend money. $18 buck for a skin hell no. $1.80 sure I'm down to spend my cash. I'm not paying the cost of a DLC for a single armor skin.
---
Also you keep adding utility with a damn pay wall you can get fucked. Don't charge me for original game items like the scrap robot and the in game craftable repair kits.
---
I have fun playing the game. Can overlook bugs , while can be frustrating sometimes it‚Äôs not enough to kill the entertainment value. 
---
I also don‚Äôt care about micro transactions, I don‚Äôt buy stuff, if other people want to more power to them. Give the people who buy stuff what they want. My guess is most people complaining about micro transactions don‚Äôt buy stuff. I‚Äôm sure a small percentage do but the vast majority don‚Äôt.
---
Thank you

Picked up a bloodied ffr 10mm pistol in a vender for 200 caps today, sold it within 10 min for 5k, can't complain!
---
 Better than ever, you're missing out
---
No, I never you you specifically. What items do you mean and what could they fix?
---
I agree with you.  I'm a hardcore pro capitalist and market.  I like capitldim and markets because they cant lie.  Humans can bitch moan and complain all day then spend 30 dollars on a skin.  The market reads that they spent the money so they want more.  We reap what we sow as consumers.  This entire gaming industry isnt companies faults.  Its our faults.  I dont knkw why...I'm trying to figure out what makes gamers so....blind and dumb?  I can't come up with any other industry where consumers would be ok with the shit game companies do.  Maybe those crystals and healing salts and bracelets that magically make your cancer go away? But thats such  a small market you cant compare it.  
---
This is exactly why I harp on the gamers.  They need tk wake up because these fools are making the games I love absolute shit with their blind obediance to shelling out money for shit they dont even want.  And I'll be back again to re hash this exact point when bethesda adds even more pay to win, more lies, paid mods and less content.
---
Really? I admit I was just guessing, given how blatantly p2w that game is. I'll go and actually check it out.
---
I have zero issues with gamers like you.  Ky entire point is the people who spend the money to buy this crap.  Which they clearly are sinxe Bethesda is going deeper into it
---
Read my post again, I didn't say you were after points.
---
I answered your question as to why people aren't making a larger fuzz.
---

---
You are getting downvoted because it's a horrible idea to the point of likely trolling.
---
"...what, u guys don't have phones?...."
---
Well it‚Äôs nice to know what someone would be interested In If you have a large selection of weapons across multiple characters, for instance so I know not to offer a bloodied weapon to a Junkies player etc
---
Because things like the helmets, which were not directly related to FO76 btw, the bags, and "lies" have fuck all to do with my enjoyment of the game.
---
I like eating Kit Kats even though I know they're made by the dark overlords Nestle.
---
Yeah, they're in the handbook afaik. I think it lists different ranks but idk if that's an appearance change, probably a name/health leveling system. They're in with other cryptids.
---
Yup
---
Utility doesn't equal pay to win though, and having them in the AS is easier than just inserting them somewhere in the game world as a random drop, or having us spend thousands of caps on the plans.
---
So far they've added repair kits, which sure, might be an "advantage" but your gear still breaks pretty quickly in game, all it saves you is that small bit of scrap you'd have used to fix it. Scrap kits are practically useless, since workbenches are plenty. Most useful bit is sending the scrap right to your stash.
---
The fridge and collector bot thing don't give you a clear advantage over other people either, beyond taking away a little bit of grind. Devil's advocate here, but they're also CAMP items, so once you do buy them, you don't have to buy it again to build more, and since challenges net you atoms anyway, you can technically get this stuff by just playing the game. Current atom rate from challenges would make this a bit hard yes, but still a route to take without spending dollary doos.
---
Now, on the topic of them maybe adding shit like weapons and gear to it, personally i'd have to wait and see if it's anything more than just reskins of current weapons/gear or if they add something actually overpowered before flipping a  lid. 
---
I really don't want to be devil's advocate here, I hate shitty MT systems in games. But as it is, and until they go overboard on it and add shit that's a real advantage, I'm fine with the current state of the Atom Shop. None of it is giving players a real advantage over another player, repair kits maybe in a player on player fight but if you can get the UI open and use one in the middle of a fight you're losing more power to you.
---
I don't know if it's part of that ongoing "things we want" list, or if Bethesda has ever formally acknowledged it, but the need for an arbitrary item **lock** that absolutely prevents dropping or selling without manually removing the lock has been there for months.  Assigning it to the Favorites menu is insufficient - there are only so many slots there and many will be occupied by consumables.  We have a tagging system in place for Atomic Shop items and vending items.  Why we can't have one that's a simple lock is beyond me.
---
yup, thats the future of triple A titles
---
Because I fucking enjoy it
---
It would bring them more money if they would add more free content. Most of these mentioned alternatives require grinding which was added by Bethesda (wonder why). The best solution is not always the most obvious one.
---
More free content = more active players = more but smaller transactions = more money over time
---
But they are rather thinking this way:
---
More atomic shop items = fewer but big transactions from whales which are surprisingly still playing = more money right away
---

Have you actually played the game, or are you hear just to stir shit? Not exactly sure why you care. People play what makes them happy. I've played this game since the stress test. I still play everyday.  It's far from perfect,  but it's great fun. I have about 7 friends that i play with almost daily on the game. As for the atomic shop, sigh.... again, you aren't forced to spend money. It's a choice. I work hard for my paycheck and if I want to spend 10 bucks to buy items in a game I play daily, it's my choice.
---
How do you kill that which has no life???.....
---
Can somebody make a fo76\_AtomicShopCryCorner sub?
---
Some people I know make characters to use as mules. Only downside is having to trust someone to hold all of your stuff for you until you log in with the other character, but luckily a lot of people in the community are pretty nice.
---
Also to add I was ine of these fools 8 months ago.  I bought 50 dollars of creation club points.  Because I've played fallout 4 for 1000 hours I figured giving more money is fine.  Till someone did what I just did and made me realize these purchases just show companies to continue doing this stuff.  So now I've completely and totally stopped buying all Mxt of any sort because I despise it all.  I love the old games where you buy it, you play it, all items are in game you grind and play and have fun and then when youe done your done.  And more content msy come from the devs creating a nice big new world that I pay money for another full experience

in my vendor,

As long as we make a f076_bendoverforbethesda club
---
some guy, some where, said: "won't someone rid me of this troublesome priest?!"
---
Amen
---
Why would they dump money in an MMO that's not making money?
---
this was happening to me yesterday but when I respawned they gave me about a 30 sec window of no rad damage so I could get my power armor out and get in, has this happened to anyone else?
---
Truth is, the game was bugged from the start.
---
absolutely.  robot that gathers junk for me? meh.  robot that cracks corny dad jokes?  yesplease!
---
What's with the downvotes? Isn't it a fact that the less players you've got in a lobby, the less lag you experience? So I literally meant that everything you've said plus minimal lag would be epic... People are strange smh
---
Sure do, then we can keep getting massive expansions like wastelanders for free. See how that works??

With the right build through perks, mutations and armor types(mix of damage resistance and energy resistance), the only things that will kill you are explosions, radiation, and the poison attacks from insects and the Mirelurk Queens acid squirt. You definitely want a dense mod on your chest armor to help against explosions, (also helps against scorchbeast shrieks). For limbs, either ultra light or deep pockets helps if you need extra ap or more carry weight. 
---
For secondary legendary effects, you should have one or two poison resist pieces. This is the only way to have constant protection against insects and Mirelurk Queens. 2 pieces with poison resist is usually enough, the other three should have ap refresh rate or for melee or extra carry weight, +1 strength. If you carry a lot of weapons, ammo, and/or food and chems, youll want some weight reduction pieces, whichever suits your needs best. If you are a melee character, some cavaliers pieces to reduce dmg while sprinting towards your enemy. Most other builds will benefit more from sentinel. 
---
For radiation, you could look for radiation resistance, but its not worth wasting legendary slots or perk points, just add some diluted radways to your quick select wheel. 
---
I use a bloodied vats commando build, my armor is all unyielding and looks like this. 
---
CP - Dense mod, Radiation Resist, ammo weight reduction. (Looking for ap refresh). 
---
RA - deep pocketed mod, poison resist, 50% reduced fall damage. 
---
LA - Deep pocketed mod, ap refresh, ammo weight reduction. 
---
RL - Deep pocketed mod, ap refresh, 50% reduced fall damage. 
---
LL - Deep Pocketed mod, Poison Resist, cavaliers. (Looking for ammo weight reduction).
---
Some people LIKE having their testicles stepped on. It's a crazy world, man.
---
Sorry, but those areas will spawn higher lvl enemies.  Not much you can do. If you play with friends,  I suggest having them help you.it makes it easier.
---
They wouldnt.  Fallout 76 failed.  Nkt failed in the sense of no profits but failed in almost all other aspects.  Atom shop is clearly working as idiot gamers are buying the shit.  They have a skeleton crew making the rest of the game, this ground breaking new tech called "putting NPCs in an mmo open world game."  They of course are making money just nkt as fast or well as they want.  Thags why they lied and put in non cosmetics in the shop because they are gearing up to go full blown atomic shop nightmare mode.  Hopefully this post ages badly and I'm proven wrong.  I doubt it
---
I bought a fair amount. I feel like I'm supporting an ongoing service, which it is. It's my money I work for and I'll spend it as I please. They stop making stuff like wastelanders then ill stop buying too.
---
Yup.  Make sure you bring the lube it will hurt less
---
IMO not just nuke zones.  When I grind plastics at Morgantown school, I shoot the same 3 scorched in the cafeteria.  When I grind for lead at Green County lodge, I shoot the same roach everytime etc.  There needs to be more variability  or randomness.
---
This is why I never bother to respond to people just asking for ‚Äúoffers‚Äù. I don‚Äôt have all the time or patience in the world, they know the sort of thing they want‚Äîor definitely don‚Äôt want‚Äîso give people a clue.
---
Seriously. They added the fixer bear arm and bone weapons.. That would be fun since it's such an iconic weapon for the franchise.. furious and vampires would be pretty cool
---
Any idea what I'm supposed to be doing instead of this quest then?
---
It hasn't failed by any means. It's making money and they're steadily releasing new stuff. It was dook at launch, but the future of it isn't in doubt.
---
It Is your money.  The market has spoken.  Gamers are fools who like to be fleeced.  Congrats.  I'll always support market forces and freedom to spend.
---
You really shouldnt be in that area when you are that low of a level
---
Maybe it could be a function of the personal terminal, you have to go to a specific location and select ‚Äúunlock item‚Äù. That way you can‚Äôt accidentally click through ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure I want to drop‚Äù , you‚Äôd have to set out to destroy it
---
For example the refrigerator. If you ask me food spoils too quickly especially the pre-packaged one. So it didn't spoil for 25 years but it can then spoil right away in your bag?
---
Why you even over that side of the map at level 23 I didn‚Äôt leave the forest until level 60. I‚Äôm level 110 now and haven‚Äôt even been to fort defiance. Slow down take your time to level up.
---
Toxic valley maxes out at level 25, ash heap maxes out at 35. You‚Äôll have to grind up in the mentioned zones if high level spawns are causing you trouble in the divide.
---
Ruined? Seriously man? You do know the game won't be around for forever. I feel like people spend more time worrying than playing the actual game
---
Having similar issue at lvl 30ish in early-mid quest areas with lvl 68 supermutant warlords.
---
As far as crystals go, I mean even if they are superfluous, at least the non-cosmetic items in the atomic shop are supposed to work. Lol
---
The future of all of Bethesda is in doubt.  They have destroyed their goof will.  Now new releases are mired with "shit is this gonna be a garbage heap cash grab" rather than "ya Bethesda makes great games!!" Your right it isnt doomed but it will be doomed if they continue the Mxt push
---
You should be exploring, doing events, and doing side quests in the Forest, Toxic Valley and the Ash Heap. You're rushing the game.
---
Jesus Christ I just read a essay on atoms
---
Didn't leave the forest until you were 60?! What were you doin there?
---
Well that or just not cry because there are other opinions.
---
Going to be hard to keep playing this game till next year...
---
I love shopping at stores that have no prices listed and ask me ‚Äúhow much are you willing to pay?‚Äù  at checkout.
---
I don't remember exactly what was nerfed but in early updates there were big nerfs that added more grind to game because Bethesda noticed that it doesn't have enough endgame content.
---
If this was the only game I'd agree.  Almost all my favorite franchises are being ruined by either 
---
1. Insane Mxt whixh degrades all other aspects of the game
---
2. Live service bullshit
---
3. SJW alt left insanity.  
---
At least I'm saving money haha
---
So after 2 weeks I can get a red skin for my power armor or wait 3-4 weeks and get something actually cool? Your scenario also depends on daily login and a few hours to spend just grinding out crappy boring objectives.
---
LoL This.
---
Not trying to be a jerk, I'm really not here. We are "fleeced" everyday with every purchase we make. How much did those shoes you have on cost to make? Or the packaged noodles one might buy?? You are backing yourself in a corner by attacking everyone.
---
That‚Äôs part of the vault raids it always happens you have to run and break the pipes as soon as possible
---
Problem comes when other opinions wreck the games I enjoy.  While I support anyones right to spend as they please, I can complain that my favorite franchies has become a laughing stock
---
i'd be more inclined to agree with u if it weren't for the fact that the mtx 'products' on offer were, in my opinion, very weak.
---
some warmed over skins for power armor i never used at almost the price of Far Harbor dlc?  thats not a good value.
---
yes, we get to choose what costume we get (as opposed to a overwatch style loot drop which drops multiples but random), but the premium of that choice was of insufficient value to justify that price point, in my personal estimation
---
When you have the quest active, it should give you circles on the map where each insect can be found.
---
We paid 60 dollars for a finished and functional game. This game is neither after a full year has passed, but they still took the money. People like you are exactly why the gaming industry is going to complete shit. You're getting scammed and you don't even realize it. 
---
"Just give them more money lol"
---
Ridiculous...
---
Either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. Lol reminded me of that quote.
---
That's not offers lol..make it specific to the game
---
lol, wan 2 'blades'? c u in 1 hr, 46 mins!
---
Hey..we have a brain surgeon here
---
It's from the 17th to the 21st.
---
 [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
&gt;When you have the quest active, it should give you circles on the map where each insect can be found.
---
but you dont have to use specifically those bugs in those spots.. 
---
any bugs will count so if you know of spawns in easier areas to get to those will work too
---
If one game can offer different experiences to please a wider range of gamers, I think that's pretty cool. After Wastelanders there will be lots do for solo players as well as team players.
---
As a pretty large trader when I see offers I just pass it up. No one wants to waste their time playing guessing games.
---
Did the shoe company sell me my shoes without laces? Then charge me ful price for laces? Then charge me extra for a sole, and then even more for the inner lining? No it's a complete product.  Gamers are the onky consumers who literally defend companies who tear apart the product and sell it back to them.  It's actually pathetic and it's why the greater majority of the world if non gamers views gamers as dumb losers.  And they do.  Bethesda views gamers as dumb losers as well it's why they lie they have zero respect for you or me
---
Awesome, thanks
---
Top answer bud. Thank you
---
Reap what you sew isn‚Äôt it really.
---
You say you support it, but you sound like a closet communist. COMMUNIST DETECTED ON REDDIT. Sorry, that was my skin not me.
---
Haha its actually perfrct for Bethesda right now
---
with some forethought you can most of the parts before the mission starts. just walking around the world nets you most of those creatures pretty much everywhere.
---
w/ wastelanders we might get what is considered 'a full game' by even beth's standards.  they openly said 76 was an experiment, and when it was released it was clearly not ready for prime time.
---
its in a much better place now, ironically, at a much lower price at the store
---
A lot of companies actually.
---
The argument is about their decision to rework the Atomic shop and add more utility items to it in the future because apparently "community requested that". By broken I mean not logical or unnecessary. Fallout originally was never a survival game and now we spend most of our time grinding for survival.
---
You know what people have been asking for, *far more than utility items?*
---
Faction items.
---
Not Free States. Not Raiders. BoS. Enclave. Responders.
---
Hahah I dont think I could be farther from a communist.  Complaining about spending habits is far cry from trying to force spending habits.
---
Very true. Also a lot of them spawn in at Dolly Sods itself and the Tea Time event can spawn most of them.
---
Ahh okay, we did the seed bank section and had like 20 seconds left, was waiting for the door but it took for ever
---
Well ea and Activision were never good.  I'd say Bethesda ans blizzard are the two tragedies
---
Yeah the prices are nuts, I'll agree on that point.
---
I dont have to give clues as I want offers lol. Just make offers, this is bs and more to do with the fact that players dont want to make offers and want things always dirt cheap
---
Mountain Lodge and Nuke Launch, second found at the before the elevator to every Silo
---
&gt; What hilarious way of fucking up will they come up with this time!?
---
Dupes and Dev Rooms ahoy!
---
If there is Campfire Tales going on I suggest you go there. It spawns all the insects you need parts of, plus a good amount of thic blood if you, like me, like to craft Stimpaks by the dozens.
---
What about those noodles bro??? You didnt answer on the noodles.
---
Also..you hit the nail on the head..you dont bother with people so the same goes for sellers who have bites who dont make offers..I wont bother
---
You probably aren't. I just wanted to type that lol.
---
check your misc and make sure you dont have a ton of ores
---
check your junk and make sure you have broken everything down.. several junk items have to be broken down manually
---
Complete.package my friend:p with all the diabetes and cancer included
---
Persisting CAMPs and claimed workshops would be very cool. I'd love to visit my friend's CAMPs when they're not online and return to my workshops to tweak the defenses.Resource collecting would be so easy, just travel around to your claimed workshops and pick up what you need!
---
Have you even played Vault 94? It's nothing but frustration.
---
would ppl being able to charge how much to ride the Mr. Fuzzy ride at their Camps constitute p2w?
---
Yeah I agree on that one.
---
You have 30 seconds to reach pipes and add up time.  Also in all the agricolture area there are 4 codes on papers,that you have to input in pumps to get more time.
---
This week is very different from novice to the higher versions.
---
There are quite a few nodes on the east side of Solomon's pond in the rocks.
---
Tbh, the game's already pretty dead. DXP weekend saw some action, but aside from that.
---
Read the title shit for brains, it's clearly says "Genuine Question". I'm not here to start drama. And it's not that I care about what you enjoy, i couldn't care less about you, it just blows my mind that people still play this game.
---
And I'm not even gonna go into the transaction thing. If you think its okay than you're a lost cause to begin with.
---
Sucks too because they taste so good.
---
Amazing thanks!
---
Then maybe they should've released a functional game instead of the half-broken mess. 
---
Can you imagine going to a car dealership, buying a brand-new car, then getting home and realize there's no engine, no brakes, no steering wheel and no car seats. All you have is a shell that kind of looks like a car. So you go back to dealership and demand they fix it. "Sorry", says the dealership man, "you'll have to pay an extra premium to get basic functionality and it'll probably take well over a year before we can ship it."
---
That's the gaming industry in 2019, and it's all possible because of people like you who keep defending these practices to death. This would be UNHEARD OF in any other industry.
---
To keep players interested, the world needs to evolve and grow beyond just smallish Events.  Continue to create new Events for sure and the new DLC should help with the NPC's but I think they should somehow legitimize modding and find a way for players to work together to rebuild.
---
On modding, not sure how without unfair cheats but maybe allow modding to only be for new Events vs modifying weapons, armor etc.
---
On collaborative rebuilding, start with small things like chat functionality; better trading mechanics; letting us advertise what we have to sell, want to buy, or need help with (e.g. help me in a nuke silo) server wide etc.
---
lamps, electrical parts like fuses, light bulbs - especially the lamps are common items everywhere
---
Actually, there are tons all over the twin lakes area in general
---
"Why do you care"
---
I never said I did, I'm genuinely curious how people find this game enjoyable with everything thats wrong with it.
---
What pre packaged food spoils?
---
Every day for all difficulties pretty much.
---
It‚Äôs a good idea to carry pa and/or hazmat suit at all times
---
No
---
I'm asking the fanbase why the enjoy the game and fairly criticising rhe game. Wtf lol. Why do you take this so to heart.
---
I agree 100%. Hopefully with Wastelanders we‚Äôll see raider or cultist mobs that pose an actual challenge and can just spawn anywhere.
---
People assume that the game becomes super easy because of high tier weapons and perfect builds‚Äîand those things help‚Äîbut really, it‚Äôs easy because you know exactly where everything is all the time. When I go to my farming spots now I leave my armor in the stash and take trash weapons, just so I don‚Äôt need to bother fixing anything or using good ammo. It‚Äôs a little harder to clear WestTek naked with a pipe rifle, but not much.
---
I found a non hostile super mutant, but he didn‚Äôt have the injured tag. He was a super mutant warlord I think, and he wouldn‚Äôt talk, except when I pressed a on him. All he said was ‚Äúgo away, little bleeder.‚Äù
---
Well it depends, if said ride is trapped and kills everyone who rides it, letting you take their scrap and get the XP etc. Then maybe.
---
Im game for that gives PA more of a accomplishment. Other then X-01 or more in game paint thats not via atoms.
---
If you say so man. I just wouldn't support em. Thats just me though
---
The issue is that the game is goofy, so there‚Äôs no appeal.
---
These guys have what they need, they just want to trade their way up to items of higher market value or rarity. Hence why they act so outlandishly offended if someone doesn't recognize what a magnificent and high-priced item they're in possession of.
---
I think that WAS most people's hope. Whether it was RP heavy players or modders, I thought the hope in private servers was having an isolated universe, like previous titles. 
---
I personally love the community aspects, but private server enthusiasts, I imagine, WANT something that is independent of the global system.
---
I suppose so, all the antagonizing replies below shows that they can't accept anyone criticizing their beloved Fallout 76 either. It's pathetic. üòÇ
---
**"Why doesn't Bethesda get more credit for the world they've created?"**
---
Do you really think that Bethesda deserves any credit at all for F76? After the things they've done? 
---
MMO games aren't a new thing. Having 24 players per server that can interact isn't a new concept and it isn't even that high a number. Bethesda hasn't achieved greatness here. Not even close.
---
If you can find enjoyment from this game more power to you but you must see that it's insane that you're trying to improve the image of Bethesda when there's absolutely nothing you can do that with. 
---
**none of these games have a world/s in anyway comparable to the world of 76 in scope, or interactiveness.**
---
If F76 is really your benchmark for an open world I feel sorry for you.
---
Done. Thursday I got 80% shit, with 1 gun I can sell and 1 that was cool though it doesn't fit my build (instigating hunting rifle). Friday I got 100% shit.
---
I came across the same encounter, and because of the actions of his "Brothers," I put him down. 
---
I can feel for the guy but I'm sure if it was me limping and crippled, I would be hanging in a meat bag up in Grafton Dam.
---
Its claimed by you until you leave the server, its is contested by another player or toy fail to defend it from ghouls/ whatever attacks it... you will get a notification about the attacks!!
---
I mean.. So you want them to release wastelanders broken or in a good state? Less of a suggestion and more of an opinion
---
These replies man. üòÇ
---
I probably should this community was going to be this toxic and defensive.
---
Leave all your angry replies hereüëá, maybe I'll have a good laugh reading them.
---
bloodied anything is good
---
After each raid....
---
This.....
---
...and it's exactly this that keeps me around even though Bethesda kinda mucked up the business side of this one. Even though we don't have NPCs (which I say isn't entirely true.....robots and super-mutants are NPCs imo) I have still had real Fallout emotional moments.
---
Some moments of pure panic (as much as I can over a game, at least) while you fight off some threat to feelings of victory and true elation....or disappointment and rebuilding.
---
Tear jerking moments where a clever game director makes you stop and take notice of a scene in subtle (or not-so-subtle) ways. 
---
...and then either players or another cleverly laid scene can restore your smile or even make you straight-out laugh.
---
You‚Äôll find that those players who you seem really annoyed with, the ones who pay for items are keeping this game alive.  The game had bad reviews in the beginning and was being sold a week after release dirt cheap. They could of decided to just give up on the game and let it die, because even the players who love it would of gotten bored without any new content. The player base is no where near the amount of players they were expecting as the bad reviews have put a lot of people off buying it. So yeah they maybe said it was going to be cosmetics in the shop but they were expecting a bigger player base buying them. We‚Äôve had lots of free content and more being promised and there isn‚Äôt many games now a days that do that. How do you expect them to keep adding free stuff and paying their staff etc. And yes I‚Äôm one of those players that pay for Atoms with real cash. I‚Äôve played many games where I‚Äôve never spent any money on extras and the people who do, do not effect my game play in any way.
---
They‚Äôre ‚Äúgenderless‚Äù females and males look the same, except for grandma who was a nightkin and dressed like a gram, guess she had memories from when she was human or something
---
People are becoming toxic  on this post and everyone that don't post toxic stuff is getting downvoted like what the hell i know alot of players hate atomic shop pay to get crappy skins but fuck this isn't a Facebook hate group this is *r/fo76* 
---
And here comes the down votes proving that i was right
---
Oh okay, is that the seed bank area?
---
Ok bud
---
You lose the caps, which is the biggest reason why I refuse to sell god tier legendaries for anything more than 5,000 at my vendor. Then I don't have to worry about someone doing a shopping spree at my vendor, buying out all my legendaries, and me only getting the caps for two or three of them.
---
Seeing as a private server is required for mods...
---
And private servers aren't (going to be) free...
---
Most mods probably won't be like creation club, but it is kind of monetizing mods, or at least the ability to mod.
---
Il repeat for the slow out there in Bethesda land NO ONE ASKED FOR UTILITY ITEMS. Make a normal game not a broken cash cow
---
They‚Äôre either missing the point or spinning data to serve their narrative‚Äîor a bit of both. No rational human being is buying scrap/repair kits. I don‚Äôt see a ton of fridges out there, so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs been that popular either.
---
The one item I know has sold a ton is the Collectron‚Äîbut it sold because it‚Äôs fun, not because of its utility. If they took away the utility today, I know I wouldn‚Äôt care. Players like it because it adds life to their CAMP and gives a good laugh every now and again. 
---
People liking a fun novelty item doesn‚Äôt equate to wanting utility items in the Atom Shop. Give me a Mr. Handy butler that tells me bad jokes and gives haircuts on request‚ÄîI‚Äôll buy it. Give me an Assaultron that makes suggestive jokes to me and my CAMP visitors‚ÄîI‚Äôll buy it. Give me a Col. Gutsy that constantly laments not being able to kill commies in varying ways‚ÄîI‚Äôll buy it. I don‚Äôt need or particularly want these items to have utility, I just want them to be fun and immerse me in the game. 
---
‚ÄúUtility‚Äù items are what happens when developers don‚Äôt want to put in real effort. It‚Äôs just a half-assed rent seeking business model. We all give them the answers to this test every day on this sub, listing dozens of interesting things we‚Äôd all buy‚Äîbut no, apparently the answer is more utility items.
---
I didn't  think they would be free but most people thought it would be like ark. Run a server from home or pay money to rent one. I'm not surprised that bethesda is going to make u rent from them. They still have full control and they're taking your money. Greedy bastards.
---
Well shit. Time to go hunt for the insects again.
---
Life was flappin by in the wind
---
Na, man, that's old hat. They need something new like, idk, deleting entire characters inventories. No, wait, they did that too. Hmm, is there a way that the software could be so bad that your computer literally starts on fire? That's where they should be setting their sights!
---
I thought if you empty a container it only emptied for you and other people can still pick things up?
---
Some quick googling says every day 8am EST? Can't confirm for sure tho.
---
For every person like you who hates non cosmetics in the Atom shop, there‚Äôs probably 10 more who love it.  I‚Äôm not replying to get into an argument as that‚Äôs your opinion and that‚Äôs how you feel. It‚Äôs just not everyone is dead against the idea and that doesn‚Äôt make them wrong either. I don‚Äôt think they see us as fools and have no respect for us or they wouldn‚Äôt be trying to sort all the problems out. They‚Äôd just think you‚Äôve bought the game tough and move onto the next project.
---
&gt;Na, man, that's old hat. They need something new
---
Not in this game, it seems.
---
I‚Äôm not sure that higher level players presence increases high level spawns. Maybe spawns of random encounters, but if it‚Äôs a location or anything, it seems pretty set.
---
If you don't know what exactly got nerfed, then it's not really affecting you much, right? Not trying to be a bitch, but just thinking maybe you didn't see that point.
---
we: we want more utility in game...
---
Bethesda: we listened your feedback about more utilities, we'll add them in atom shop.
---
Todd promised us a free offline way to play the game. Now it turns out I have to pay if I want to play the game alone, but still have to be online and connected.
---
This is the same kind of complaint here every single day in retail. You tell someone on 22 October we‚Äôre going to give out free cookies. You show up to get free cookies but the cookies are not there. You asked the store manager where are the free cookies? They said that the recipe is not done for the new cookies that they‚Äôre coming out with it‚Äôs gonna take six months before it‚Äôs ready. The customer says well I am entitled to something free so give me something. Sure sir we can give you a coupon in store credit for something that you could buy our older cookies. 
---
I think the complaints are childish, but what can you do. The customer will still be dissatisfied with the product regardless of what they get
---
Yet you never saw a Vampire minigun, FFR, 90% RW, lvl 45......   :)
---
Each is an outstanding company. I'm at work I just want someone to talk to.
---
I like it because it‚Äôs a fun game to relax to. Join a friend just talk about things as I collect water. Kinda cathartic.
---
No there aren't. 
---
You cannot modify a PS4 like that and stay online. 
---
Feel free to drop by with proof of your apparent PS4 hackers when jailbreakers have not even got close to cracking the latest version (which is 7.0) of the PS4's OS and you need the latest version to be online and connectrd to PSN.
---
But don't drop in with some unsubstantiated claim or rumour or alleged proof. You show me a person walking through all the steps to modify Sony or Microsoft hardware or software and bypassing security measures of servers and the entire infrastructure of Sony and Microsoft's online networks and allowing jailbroken consoles to access online lobbies of modern consoles and cheat via programmed code execution and we'll talk.
---
I've seen so many backpacks with Atom Shop skins, to the point I can't even remember the last time I saw a basic backpack besides my own. So they could totally have put the fridge and scrap protectron in the game as a quest and still made plenty of money off selling skins for it in the Atom Shop.
---
I think the best solution is to just leave the game and hop in from time to time to play the dlc. It's clear that Bethesda is making a very low effort with Fallout 76. As soon as better games come around people will slowly forget about Fallout 76. The Outer Worlds and Death Stranding are just around the corner. Not long until Last of Us 2, Doom Eternal and Cyberpunk hit the shelves. I paid my dues. 400 hours buried in the game. I milked everything humanly possible from it. But this obsession with the Atom Shop is such a turn off. See ya back when Wastelanders arrive.
---
Gamma not my cup of tea (not a pvp‚Äôr) but I‚Äôd give a kidney for that fixer!
---
Lol, in this case people paid for a game, so yes they are entitled to it. Specially a game with the title of ‚Äúlive service‚Äù carries specific implications, meaning that it will have continuous content. Also, people are more mad at Bethesda‚Äôs comments towards microtransactions more than towards the delay of wastelanders. Your example made 0 sense to this situation
---
im sure some asshole has done it..
---
got a Bffr gatling gun and a few explosive weapons, and a JE single action, among alot of scrip
---
welcome to the internet
---
I guess but I just wanted this to mainly get to Bethesda but that probably won‚Äôt happen. I also couldn‚Äôt think of any other way to do so lol.
---
^ people will always find something to complain about
---
I use the workshops to get the resources that I have hard time finding and while there working Aiko and exploring collect what I can do anything I can find then come back 20 minutes later collect what I can out the workshops and do it all over again
---
It would be a disaster if launched now, so yeah, this is the right move.
---
I‚Äôm only wondering if they will delay it again next year......
---
I love it lol.
---
If a game is going to continue for years - it also has to drop content - we haven‚Äôt really seen a whole lot of that within this year. 
---
Every major update has been delayed by at least a month if not more. 
---
MTX items don‚Äôt count because they provide nothing for paid-at-start players to return to. 
---
There has to be a hook that doesn‚Äôt involve paying through the nose weekly especially given this game STILL retails online for 70 bones
---
lol üòÇ
---
Read my previous comment. It's part of the workshop PvP zone mechanics.
---
What exactly happens when you reach cap limit then? Can people still but your stuff?
---
So Activision doesnt own destiny 2 anymore? Please explain
---
I‚Äôm glad they delayed it. It was probably going to be a buggy mess like the games release.
---
I think I will do the same. So many other better games out there. And then we will see if Watelanders is really going to change things.
---
Yes, i agree. For science of course
---
I actually didn't know that, thank you for that info.
---
You ask why people play and are made that people say they play because the game is fun.... go troll somewhere else.
---
I'm hoping wastelanders will change this. It's at the tail end of its first year though. Give it time. Every other mmo I've played wasnt packed when it came out either.
---
Yeah i did
---
Out of my 300 hours only a quarter of those were actually injouable as i have literally done everything that comes to mind. I regret ever spending a dime on this game.
---
If you mean for that insect repellent daily quest, it should recommend spots on the map for you while the quest is active.
---
Someone did on ps4 10 minutes after sale went live. I didn‚Äôt check it out, just jumped servers. I‚Äôm too old for that shit.
---
All DLCs are free here though.... that‚Äôs the thing. You don‚Äôt lose out on anything by not buying stuff from the shop. Just enjoy the free addons including wastelanders in a few months.
---
Guess it got adjusted at some point? I swear it limited me to one when I first got it just like the mothman smoke machine
---
I am on PS4, so I need to use my level ups to move some points around, I am sitting on two right now.  Is there a way to completely reset your SPECIAL?
---
The only feature i want in this game more than the things that are already coming with wastelanders is the ability to just run the fucking game in offline SP on my console.
---
I should have figured I would be able to get anything to change I'll just play a different game fuck it
---
I had no idea there were *different versions* of him in the game until I met the nice chill one, and I was terrified it was gonna try and kill me lmao
---
Me too, I'm happy they are giving it a little polish for us. There's no denying that's what sparked the influx of hate posts though lol. I'm on reddit every day.
---
Wow, you spent the equivalent of a month playing a game you hate? Can't say I do the same.
---
Thanks for replying - the answer here for me is login as early as possible because if your screwed by a scheduling error your screwed in general
---
Right? I'm happy to wait a bit longer if it means a more refined experience. It'll be so worth it.
---
Hopefully all the people who have been asking for private servers will at least be satisfied.
---
You do raise a point but the fact that we haven‚Äôt had anything worthwhile in a couple of months that is free is just making the game boring.
---
They couldn't win either way with that crowd.  Delaying it was the best decision regardless.
---
Wasn't it the Canned Stew from feed the people?
---
I'm sure that degraded before they changed it in a patch.
---
Man there's been posts from the early a.m lol. People rolled out of bed with veins popping over robots and rng.
---
Reeeeeeeeefridgeraaaaaaaaatoooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrblblblmghhhhhnpfuuuuiiiirt....
---
*Inhales*
---
PAYYY TO WIIIIIIIIIIIIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
*gasps*
---
Worthless game im 800 hours in!!!!!!!
---
*Buys atoms for plague rider PA skin*
---
How is it being ruined? The game is PvE, and at lvl 30 I was killing mobs of lvl 40 mole men with a lvl 25 handmade... that's not pay to win, until Bethesda starts selling high power custom legendaries for real money (I know people sell them on ebay, but that's different, that's like black market) who cares. It's mostly cosmetic stuff, the only benefit item is the repair kit, and scrap kit, if some 12 year old or impatient whale wants to buy quick repairs or quick scraps, let them. They arent required to finish quests for efficiently play the game, its minimal effect and adds money to the development crew, let the whales fund the game. I dont buy stuff unless I accidentally grind out atoms, and I do mean accidentally, I dont do atom rewarding tasks on purpose, and all I've bought were some cheaper costumes and a pip-boy skin
---
Outer worlds releases in less than a week, it looks like a blast and something fun to do till wastelanders
---
Im not giving them anymore money.
---
Because Todd howard does not give a shit about you. Neither does Bethesda softworks execs nor big boss Zenimax. Bethesda studios might care, as I agree generally game devs want players to enjoy the game they‚Äôre crunching hours to create, but Todd howard certainly does not. He‚Äôs a paid shill whose salary is given every month to sell games however he can. If it requires giving some half hearted lip service about ‚Äúwe‚Äôre listening and improving‚Äù, he‚Äôll do it. He is the face of Bethesda. He‚Äôs just a PR spokesperson at this point.
---
Basically yes. I would log on every day for like in hour or just searching for things to do. Now that I think of it that was just brain numbing. I am an idiot üòÇ
---
Pretty much. It's like kids living at home that hate their parents, but wont move out.
---
Then take a break? There are tons of great games out there right now. I hve 553 hours in game and still end up having fun exploring. If you are bored, try something new and come back the spring.
---
Bethesda: oh what's that? You want us to lock more content behind a paywall? You're really twisting our arm, OkayFineWellLockContentBehindAPayWallYoureWelcome
---
I definitely got my money's worth out of it. Geez, how much do you spend to see a movie, get a large soda and a bag of popcorn for maybe 2 hours of entertainment.
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject

I‚Äôm on now if you send me an invite I‚Äôll join up if your on üëç
---
We play because we never hopped on the bandwagon of hate. We enjoy things we enjoy because we're not afraid to be individuals. That's the political answer I know you'll fake scoff at while you try to come up with your new uncreative "lol you're so toxic" response. 
---
Anyway. Sorry. The game itself:
---
1) World is huge with tons to explore. 
---
2) Awesome economy with unique items all over the market to buy/sell/trade with other people. 
---
3) Camps.  Simply, camps. The creativity of builds and possibilities to interact with other people is incredible. Example: someone held an auction for a few legendary items. Built an auction house themed camp with podium and seating for us to bid. 15 people together in the same spot participating in an organized social activity. Not many games allow this kind if creativity and custom interaction.
---
4) RPG elements and challenging character building. And variety of feasible character builds possible. With minimal nerfs in one year, mind you, compared to other games. See: Borderlands 3, Destiny 2, WoW, Division 2...
---
5) Steady stream of updates, events, community events, and content added. People who say there's not a lot of support arent paying attention... at least 100 hours of PVE gameplay content added since launch. Not counting Nuclear Winter cause I only play co-op PVE. PVP still have plenty to do as well. 
---
6) Good endgame system with variety of boss fights (not even counting raid cause I've never bothered to try it yet) and a solid legendary farming system with the only downside being daily scrip exchange limit.
---
7) Daily quests. 
---
8) Insane number of recipes and plans to learn
---
9) literally hundreds of thousands of legendary item roll possibilites
---
10) Community factions and events. Example, I put a hit out on my friend and watched this group of raiders come try to kill him. It was hilarious. 
---
Theres a few off the top of my head. And the MTX are par for the course compared to literally everything else on the market so I dont know how you can say it's a "bad" thing just for FO76 when its everywhere in video games. Few bugs still linger, but crash frequency isn't all that bad, tbh. I've crashed more playing BL3 and BFV in the last week than I ever have in my 700 hours of Fallout 76.  I'm on Xbox
---
So there ya go. That's why I play Fallout 76. It's a huge RPG with an awesome community.  Every time I log on is a different experience.  The world is wonderful with so much more to explore and discover. And the addition of new content coming that keeps this world evolving based on the fanbase? Pretty neat. 
---
Theres room for more people if you want to set aside your internet troll ego and actually have some fun. But if you dont like strict RPGs, meticulous inventory management, survival, or tapping into your creativity, you wont have fun. If that's the case, no need to hate on people that do like this style of game.
---
I would love to play that game but money is a problem right now.
---
Now here‚Äôs the real question. If Wastelanders releases in Q1 and it is the same quality as the current adventure mode, would you be disappointed?
---
I like the game. The comradery, the randomness, the solitude and the beauty scenery.
---
And when it's a Buzz Blade it's better than anything else. That's my point.
---
The bugs don't really bug me. The load times aren't an issue for me and I don't care what they do with the atom shop cause I'm not the type to spend actual money on it.
---
It's fun to play. So I keep playing it.
---
No, i want 700 different power armor skins
---
It's actually made of porcelain
---
Probably playing with his Flap Limb
---
not really . you cant atack people out fo no where. if it was actually apocalyptic  care bares would be crying .
---
Take canned coffee or quantumns to massively boost ap and you can get pretty high, 3 stories easily
---
I predict wastelanders will get hate no matter what shape it‚Äôs in
---
Still on?
---
I do that event quite a lot as it‚Äôs nice easy caps and the hope of some goodies. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs what I did but it was almost down to the last minute before it moved.
---
Done. Last question was easy. Bethesda and RNGesus are both assholes.
---
That's a given.
---
This just happened to me on ps4.  One honeybeast showed up on wave 2.  I ran around the immediate area, couldn't find any other ones.  Ran out the last 4 minutes and failed.
---
You mean
---
"It will on be purely for cosmetcis" "while others... we will stay on the right side"?
---
Or do you have some other quotes you'd like to share?
---
Tried speaking to him, he didn't move.  He was just in front of the 2nd hive spouting off lines and not moving.
---
400? pathetic but commendable, after the nerf i haven't been able to get over 300 phys  
---
let me dig through my screenshots folder to find the pip boy damage reading of over 1200 before they nerfed it, though. it's just not comparable to a bloodied deathclaw/power fist with power attack damage
---
Fair enough
---
Sounds like your ‚ÄúThat guy‚Äù the OP is running behind üòÇ
---
I'm not mad at all. Lol
---
You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
---
It's because that shovel isn't government issued. Lots of red tape needs to be gone through before you can use your own shovel.
---
I play pretty much only on teams with friends. And they‚Äôve been able to loot boxes after I did.
---
I mean I get the upset, but considering all the bugs and stuff that plagued not only the release, but subsequential updates, they want to try and make sure this one releases with little to no issues, and its a pretty major update that many have been asking for and they want to try and get it right.  I mean, there have been many negative feedback regardless of what they did, id rather have it delay with a more or less, smooth release.  Not like im not expecting no bugs tho, as well as server issues.  Tho idk how they would be able to test the latter with a larger load since there is no test server for players to join to do it.
---
I don't see why people are down voting you, you were a victim of this buggy game but people are so whiny they down vote things they don't like
---
I mean that's ok too. I play 76 to relax. It's your own game. It's empty on purpose for you to make your own way. I'm on my second +200 level character, and no, I have no story quests left. I do dailies, hunt and cook, scrap, give stuff to lower levels. I don't know what wastlanders will bring but it must be pretty significant.
---
Play a different game for a bit. Far Cry 5 is very interesting. RDR2, I just restarted New Vegas. Make your own fun, don't worry about whether Bethesda is going to update this or that.
---
I only push people buttons who act condescending toward me first. But besides your dickish tone i'm glad someone here can actually answer the question besides sayin "It's fun".
---
Ah yes, killing a Sheepsquatch about 10 "hits". Killing everything else is 1-2 "hits" is pathetic. It's practically an instant kill, and considering that it's "automatic", it makes it much more efficient to use than anythig that one hits. I literally used and seen BSS of multiple melee, I know what I'm talking about. You should always use Buzz Blade for everything else besides SBQ, at which point it's Meat Hook, or Super Sledge PA.
---
They never nerfed it. I assure you that you likely nevernused it if you're saying that.
---
It's me. I've been eating all the snack cakes. I'm not sorry. You'll never take me alive! *flees into the void beyond the map*
---
Double the amount of atoms you get from purchases. Boom you still get the same amount of atoms from challenges and people who buy atoms don't feel like they are getting ripped off. Also it took them 10 months to release 1 handmade skin.... 1. There have been at least 3 in the game files for months and they refuse to release them. There have also been some modern carpets and painting in the files since day 1 that they still never released.
---
Yes, but the answers we give them can't be responded to by slapping a reskin on an existing asset and chucking it in the mtx store.
---
Smart boi. You're a cut above the rest.
---
The reason is all of us who said repair kits etc were just the first step got told to shut up and that we were just wanted to complain. Well we stopped, hope everyone enjoys new content behind paywalls and more atomic shop bs.
---
Ps wastelanders is going to be short,shallow, and borderline unplayable at release but the atomic shop will be robust and work perfectly.
---
Completely agree, they said in their last Inside the vault that they would add more Utility items based on what people ask, and the only thing I see people complain is the main menu music
---
I don't remember anymore because it was many months ago but those nerfs were very hot topic then and affected all players. They still are affecting all players.([older post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alc57y/nerfs_upon_nerfs_upon_nerfs/))
---
We heard you want legendary power armor so bad you‚Äôll pay money for them so now they‚Äôll be in the atom shop for $20!
---
Nope.
---
I dont get offended and i dont care.  People understood the question.  This isnt a college essay, its a question on reddit from my phone.
---
it's funny how you think bethesda does anything because you asked for it.
---
You are allowed to work in a nuclear plant now.
---
I bought the Nukashine paint myself, thats interesting i didn't know you could even do that.
---
Aww you're making me blush
---
I wonder why they're not selling that much of those....
---
Skinner meme: "Am I wrong with my prices?.....No! It's the community that's wrong and wants utility items!"
---
Nuclear Winter player structures are impermanent.
---
I‚Äôve been in OP position and unless being teamed allows this I believe you are mistaken
---
Tbh I still think they should offer a refund to those who paid 60$ on release day
---
I already bought it
---
I don‚Äôt have a problem with it but a lot of people would freak.
---
Well it's a kill + fusion cores; you can't go wrong with that.
---
I think you can still do it. I don't think I read anywhere that it was fixed. But that was my guess to the issue possibly. Is it still doing it?
---
I did! But I guess it was meant to be in the base game, just it didn't work well enough. When they fixed it, they saw an opportunity to sell it through the Atom Shop. Same for some skins or workshop items, they look like they belong in the basegame, but they chose to sell it apart.
---
That‚Äôs super weird... cause my friends and I regularly call out like ‚Äúthere‚Äôs an annoying box over here‚Äù and so everyone gets a grab
---
Box of ammo.
---
There are people who find the base game a lot of fun to play but not necessarily happy with the negatives but those negatives are not enough to disrupt their fun.
---
Thanks for *finally* being transparent that your intent was to fuck us all along
---
That sucks man, it would be so nice if I didn't keep finding bugs every week.
---
I'm 23, also itt not like the game explains any of this, all I've done is follow where the main quest takes me.
---
From the amount of people who got the collectron and the fridge. Never mind that many who got the collectron, got him just because he's funny, and many who got the fridge, got the fridge to fill the fridgeless void in their kitchen but don't actually store anything it. 
---
Hell, if the fridge was an in game quest with skins in the Atom Shop, I'd get the fridge just to complete my kitchen and pick out a skin or two in the shop to make it fit my aesthetic better. I don't actually have any need for the utility it provides. As for the collectron, I kind of wish they'd just made him be a skin for the junk collector. Then, since I have a junk pile at my house anyway, I could have him wandering the edge of my junk pile, scrapping the stuff inside it.
---
And the the only piece I want to mod is the one that doesn't work, this game man. So frustrating randomly stumbling across bugs like this.
---
Dumb
---
I think the reason why people bought up the collectrons was just to have a cool robot hanging around. From what I've heard they provide very few resources so it definitely can't be about the function. :-p
---
I tend to view the situation as such: Bethesda is at fault because Bethesda is creating the badness. The people who consume it are part of it but at the end of the day it's Bethesda's choice to do these things and nobody can change that. :/
---
This would be funny if it wasn‚Äôt so possible to be so damn true....
---
There should be quests to get these robots. Like, once you get promoted to General, and if you have a robotics perk, you should be able to order a Gutsy to head to your camp.
---
I forgot all about the 400 stash space. Jeez. I don't know how any of us coped.
---
So am I! Why do you think I hoard all the snack cakes now?! You can have the cotton candy bites.
---
^This
---
Preach brotha preach
---
Congrats, I‚Äôve ignored uranium fever since the event cooldown patch. Actually if everyone there is over 200, they should be down with sharing legendaries there. It‚Äôs really only scrip for them.
---
Now One Violent Night‚Äôs a different matter!
---
No! The sugar congeals in my cavities!
---
1.) I've grinded in games like Path of Exile and Destiny 2 and the grinding in those games can be FUN and REWARDING 
---
2.) Its an online ARPG
---
Thanks :), how much control do you have at that height? And how long could you maintain it? Say you put a window/door at that height could you get through it?
---
Shell out a few bucks and quit whingeing all the time.  You probably got this game for a $30 sale and have been playing a year now.
---
Yes I also remember doing whitesprings runs a stuffing all the legendaries i did not want in the ice cooler.
---
Gears 5 has a ‚Äúmark target‚Äù feature that reveals an enemy position to the rest of your team by clicking the left stick on a target you‚Äôre aiming at. I haven‚Äôt played borderlands 3 but the feature sounds similar. In gears it also makes your ultimate charge faster and awards points making it a great tool for team coordination that provides benefits for yourself too. 
---
I can see this being tied to perception and being very useful in NW, which I don‚Äôt like nearly as much since they changed how you could scan a hillside while aiming and find players hiding in bushes etc
---
Let there be p2w, who cares. Thats my opinion since i play solo anyways.  If they put stuff in the atom shop that is badass, ill buy it no matter the cost.  I do wish theyd fix the bugs in adventure first though.
---
I‚Äôm alloyed that the stairs built into the ceiling only have the wire mesh flooring. I‚Äôd much rather have wood flooring options for it so it matches the rest of my second floor. I used to be able to glitch pieces of wood floor to over lap them but that doesn‚Äôt work anymore :/
---
I paid $50 for it because I was stupid enough (won't happen again) and have been their beta tester for 1 year. You got the 1 year part right.
---
Zax signed off on it.
---
there is an event starting next week
---
So this game is hot garbage and you play destiny 2? End of conversation.
---
You guys are too loyal to a company that has made it entirely obvious they are going to milk every last shred of that faith in them till you guys are as decrepit and jaded as the people pulling the strings.
---
Send them a bug report but it‚Äôs pretty common with shotguns
---
lol, never thought about that.  that'd be hilarious and evil
---
Vault 94 raids and display cases, probably little esle. The focus has been placed completely on Wastelanders, so we haven't seen an pdate of any kind in over a month. Now that the DLC has been pushed back, they'll probably tell us in the coming week what to expect in its place.
---
I have also seen the threads but don't remember mentioning Atomic shop. Probably didn't see the right one.
---
Damn, i do...on PC though.  Id just give you some
---
I got bunch of suppressors and broadsiders, sometimes two in a row with minor differences. The drop pool on each server is definitely small. If everything is pulled from a gigantic total pool, which should easily be tens of thousands, the odds to get two nearly identical items in a row is very small.
---
I mean something more secure than even that.  Something where the prompt never even shows up - you need to manually go in and untag it.  And like I said, there are only so many slots on the Favorites Wheel.
---
Agreed. I survive on purified water and I raid Flatwoods for the meat every time I get low.
---
This is why I typically only hang out on r/starfield. Not full of cynicism and jadedness and instead hope and intrigue for the future of BGS. Call is a pack of old fools if you want, but it's certainly more fun than being here. Even if there is nothing really to talk about
---
Greed.
---
Bethesda and Zenimax are lying pieces of shit unworthy of support.
---
"We sold women their own fat asses back to them" - Tyler Durden.
---
Bethesda is taking community ideas and selling them back to us.
---
Is the 3rd perk 250 dmg res while reloading by any chance? That perk is bugged on all guns atm
---
This is why I typically only hang out on r/starfield. Not full of cynicism and jadedness and instead hope and intrigue for the future of BGS. Call us a pack of old fools if you want, but it's certainly more fun than being here. Even if there is nothing really to talk about
---
 You were so right. And for some random reason i was following some new player into a building and i found one myself that i have forever now :) now im the one making things purple lol
---
Many of the exploits used to dupe, crash servers. People running around  with 10x the amount of items you are supposed to be able to carry causes insane lag, and server crashes. They take their duped God tiers to the out of game markets, to sell(sometimes for real money). Many folks willing to pay real money for a weapon or something in FO76 are asshats, no knowledge of the game. Also screws up our in game economy, but meh to that.  Having server crash at the end of an expensive raid run is infuriating. Not saying it's all dupers fault, Beth has it's problems, but fork them. They are cheaters, earn it you asshats.
---
Should be slots for weapons
---
&gt; How is Bethesda supposed to pay their employees to work on a game that doesn't add new revenue. 
---
Erm... Make a functional game to begin with? A game that's good and and actually works, makes people spend more money on it. FACT.  
---
Example: I finished Plague Tale: Innocence this week. Great game - absolutely loved it. Not saying it doesn't have flaws but it's MILES above anything Bethesda has EVER released in terms of execution of the main idea, narrative, implementation and consistency of it's systems... Basically EVERYTHING, except of it's size.   
---
I finished this game. There was nothing for me to do with it. I still bought their shitty skin changer DLC. Why? Cause I want more games coming out from that studio. Their product satisfied me so much, that I wanted to give them more money. 
---
Same with Dota2. Been playing that game for 9 years now. Still want to buy shit they release. And they have NEVER released anything that's pay to win. EVER. 
---
Will I ever give my money to Bethesda? Probably not. (Like 95% sure of this.) 
---
My point is: why is it the consumers fault the company made shitty decisions and now can't pay their employees? The only concern for the consumer should be is the product good or not. Why should we allow the corporation to fuck us up our asses cause they're doing a fucking shitty job at making their games? There is a fucking reason why Bethesda is the laughing stock of the industry. And that reason is well earned through many years of design neglect, lies and shitty PR talk from Bethesda's part. How can such a shitty company still have fans is beyond my comprehension.
---
Yes! My T60 just wasn't there anymore, but my T51 was showing but couldn't be placed. Now I show 2 sets of T51, one that can't be placed and I have my Nuka Cola set back.
---
A ticket because of a ban will get ignored, yes. Read the mail that accompanied the ban.
---
1.) Destiny 2 is lightyears better than Fallout 76
---
2.) Imagine giving up on an argument so easily because I play a certain game
---
3.) I would say Fallout 76 is average even with all the updates it received
---
Also, who are you speaking for? Who says people dont enjoy some of the grind on here
---
Doom Eternal just got delayed. 03/20/20.
---
Sell at wholesale prices allowing others to profit as well. If the items are low level, I'll drop them in low level camps, by a player, etc.  Had a 3* lvl 1 bat with good attributes that I dumped for a player.  Got quite a few hearts for that lol
---
exactly.  I was wrong for assuming they would be using a eso format.
---
i still dont even know how to get a normal backpack
---
That would be pretty amazing, they had some good versions in Lonesome Road that I‚Äôd love to see again.
---
I just had this happen where the Mr handy got stuck in harper's ferry at a front porch. even when enemies would lure him away from the spot, he would go right back to it.....  
---
But this is the only time it has happened to me.
---
sorry this is a  request form for supply co.  we're just a McDonald's
---
I didn't say that people aren't allow to enjoy the grind just saying that its unrewarding and not fun.
---
Massive world sure, but 24 max player servers that are not even filled half the time is not an MMO lol. By that logic Call of Duty is an MMO because me and my teammates are playing together.
---
It‚Äôs a long journey. Get the quest, from the pioneer scouts campsite. And in the map under character achievements is the tadpole scout badges.
---
I'm up to the point of entering the old asylum with my lever 30 character (PC). I say get as far as you can in the main quest. Doesn't hurt to try.
---
Like any other game, if the enemies are too hard that means youre going to fast and need to level up. Most games, if any, especially RPGs open worlds, dont explain this. Its kinda common sense if you play these sorta games.
---
You should be totally happy. Once you hit a high level ghoul move on to another, the high level players will kill them and you gain much better XP than killing a meager level 9 ghoul. I‚Äôm leveling up my mule and i like it when the enemies are high levels.
---
Search helps.
---
It can be done at your level. Sneaking is your friend.
---
Also, it‚Äôs okay to run away and live to fight another day.
---
Destiny 2 was poop 3/4 of it's time. Imagine someone making numbered lists of their opinions over and over. If you dont enjoy it then leave. You obviously like spending time bitching though.
---
Only if you put in the time and effort to do the food/drink buffs.  Out-of-the-box, it's not anywhere close to 400, even Bloodied.  Something like a gauntlet or the Meat Hook will easily down any enemy without the need for such things, so that's my contention with the "one of the best" argument.  Yes, it can be great, but only if you put in the extra effort to make it so.
---
Everything that I described is without any temporary buffs... I don't do any of that.
---
When I‚Äôm close, I just kill the power to the vendor
---
Dude these servers have been so messed up!!! Doing the queen is so choppy it‚Äôs crazy, almost unplayable. Idk what the deal is.
---
Pepperidge Farm Remembers.
---
Just farm Whitespring (which is what I‚Äôve been doing when leveling up alts). Once you reach level 50 the wasteland looks much different.
---
You‚Äôre telling me you‚Äôve been playing a game you don‚Äôt like for a year because you spent fifty bucks on it?
---
It was already confirmed more than a year ago in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/dcdeacon/status/1034123132284624896) that player hosted private servers will not be supported. That by itself made it very likely that the feature will be monetized.
---
You can get the normal one from the pioneer scout challenges, and you can get a small one from Morgantown airport.
---
I'll wait for you at 76 when you fall through the map quicksand
---
only their powerattacks as far as i know
---
I just spent the past week building my ultracite armor only to learn just today that the mods are rare/nonexistent. I didn't realize this was the case when I started building or I would have done the t-60 instead. üòî
---
Not advocating for repair kits, but I've racked up like 70 of them on my main character by just going to SBQ fights other people have spawned. Using Weapon Artisan when I need to repair makes my guns last a really long time. I don't think I've actually had a weapon break in months.
---
&gt;wasn‚Äôt really my entire fault.
---
Well that's one way to convince em.
---
Also the ready for disappointment. One of the devs stated that doing all the game had to offer would take around 25 hours. For me that's a bummer.
---
Uncle Todd approves this message.
---
That and also sell stuff to bots then shop around for a good low level weapon. Many people sell low level weapons at very reasonable prices. If you can find a level 25 bloodied handmade or lever action, even just one star, you can farm like a pro.
---
Gotcha. That's makes sense, bummer though
---
So having constructive criticisms and feedback is bitching? Also, Destiny 2 is a good game and maybe don't talk shit about about games you haven't played because a Youtuber told you to? ;)
---
Yes! And also not getting the correct number of bullets that I‚Äôve supposedly just made.
---
Agreed, I think a lot can be done. I hope that private servers give us the option of increased camp size and storage, maybe some other fun things.
---
That same exact situation happened to me on PC yesterday! I felt bad since I was leveling a new character (I was around level 19) but everyone was very friendly and I actually got some useful legendaries out of it.
---
yeah i never tried it myself i just remember seeing a youtube video talking about it
---
We need to let all these sites calling it a mmo know then lol.
---
There is No MMO ever that gives anything for free unless they wanna go bankrupt.
---
A few micro DLC quest lines. One unlocks a back pack, one unlocks a daily quest an the newer crafting table to craft booze. An one quest line that unlocks a repeatable event to fight a "sheep sasquatch". They are all pretty short except the backpack requires a ton of grinding if you want any mods for it.
---
Dude go down to the queen and try. There is some bug that lets you go like a thousand feet in the air!
---
I agree. They need to put in actual creative work on these things. It‚Äôs funny how it works‚Äîmake interesting and desirable products and people will buy them. Make half-assed versions of things that already exist and they won‚Äôt.
---
&gt;It was over a ban that wasn‚Äôt really my entire fault.
---
Sounds to me like: ''I didn't stabbed the guy, I just hold his hands behind his back while he got stabbed.''
---
Nothing that could work better with a quest, even if it's in the stile of the scout badges.
---
For example, yesterday I made a comment about the Aecade cabinets from the Fallout 4 Creation Club, I'd prefer a new daily quest with their plans as a reward over just placing them in the shop for our camp.
---
To be honest, I don't think there's any utility item I'd actively go out and buy, and if they made it mandatory in some fasion, that's the day I quit.
---
The most cynical take would be that they'd offer upgrades to Legendaries in this fashion.  4th or even 5th stars, upgrade to max level, re-roll stars, etc.  Sure, we might not see a need for this right now because the game is generally easy, but what if their "balance pass" for Wastelanders ends up being a giant across-the-board nerf?
---
Add the base item to the game. Add a fancy, clean, or reskinned version to the shop for people to buy to spruce up their camp. Wager you'll see more sales on the skins because everyone has it and the temptation is there to build and make it fit the camp. 
---
I wanted a refrigerator, but I'm not going to buy one from the shop  I'll just keep eating pre-packaged food items.
---
They make money selling cosmetics, not utility. It's not p2w but it's a scummy move for sure.
---
While the context of EA's and Bethesda's actions are different, they both still boil down to greed, The Canvas bag being a prime example. (yes it's an overused argument, but that doesn't make it invalid)
---
My problem is that as soon as their profits start falling, they monetize more items to make up for it, (just like Activision did with Black Ops 4) but with Bethesda getting desperate and saying "to consistently deliver content that keeps Fallout 76 fresh and exciting for all, we needed to rethink our approach to the Atomic Shop", who knows what they're going to try sell down the line, and Bethesda never answers this. That's my problem.
---
You can earn the currency for them in the game you paid for with these special little things called atom challenges.
---
So it‚Äôs not just what you‚Äôve heard but also what people have told you? Lmao
---
I'm fine with playing alone and don't care much about others in my game. If we can upgrade camp budget in a private server though you better believe I'll be the first one to buy one.
---
I stopped playing when they fucked with repairs and added repair packs to the shop. When they make your stuff break faster, kind of forcing you to use those kits, is where my line is. I wanted to give 76 a chance but their over emphasis on the atomic shop really made me stop playing. Ill keep an eye out for dlc, but at this point they cant really get me back.
---
It's a common thing on explosive shotguns.  While latency is a factor, there may also be a per-tick damage limit in play.  Since Explosive shotguns are essentially committing twice the hits, the game appears to be filtering out some portion of those and refilling the enemy's HP accordingly.  That's why, on your end, their HP depletes like you'd expect, only to be "corrected" a second later by the server.
---
That's a good idea actually. Adding base versions.
---
Welcome to the Reddit Confirmation Bias Feedback Loop. RCBFL for short.
---
-Fusion core charger.... You get them really easy so it woudnt matter much
---
-toilets and showers/baths that add the same AP refresh buff as playing music
---
-welcome mats as fast travel points
---
Nah - let those people have sour taste in their mouths for buying into corporate bullshit pre-orders. Maybe they'll stop doing it. If most consumers stopped pre-ordering and buying day 1 and instead waited for actual reviews (not those paid pre-release "reviewers" like IGN and shit) the studios and publishers would be forced into releasing games in actually playable state.   
---
We keep blaming the corporations for continuing these "release now - fix later" shitshows. But it's the consumers that are enabling this kind of behavior and are equally responsible. STOP BUYING GAMES YOU KNOW NEXT TO NOTHING ABOUT JUST CAUSE IT CAME FROM A STUDIO THAT WAS ONCE ADORED BY MANY.
---
Yup good point.
---
Why don‚Äôt you wait until something actually happens before you throw your temper tantrum? They outlined their guiding principles around the atomic shop. Specifically what do you disagree with? Or are you just upset with their preamble that you are quoting and not the actual part where they outline what will guide decision making around why should be added to the shop?
---
According to the tweet linked in my [other comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/djyjit/why_did_folks_think_private_servers_for_a/f4ateeq/), local hosting was ruled out already in 2018. To be honest, I suspect it might implemented in a rather simple way, like just an adventure mode world where you are alone and only friends can join.
---
Bro you just posted cringe
---
I saw modding would be available. I wonder to what extent.
---
I got a arktos phrama backpack skin and still dont remember how i got it. anyone know?
---
Was it part of the power armor skin?
---
&gt;Irrational fear event bugged
---
I see what you did there.
---
The game is stupid easy with certain builds an stuff right now. The Queen can litterally be 3 shot with the right build / perks / gear. I generally hope Wastelanders brings a normalized play style where certain builds cant just absolutely destroy the "hardest endgame". That being said I hope it brings end game. The last few DLCS haven't added any end game really besides Arktos an Sheepsquatch but as it stands unless you run premade grps nobody shows up, at least on PC. So it leaves the eng game being the Queen again an the Raids wich the raid is honestly pointless for those who dont wear power armor. They need fun an interactive harder endgame conent.
---
It would be pretty great to be able to build uninhibited. Make a small city or a fortress.
---
Well said brother, I literally couldn‚Äôt of said it better myself!
---
You unlock that skin from doing Project Paradise
---
Lol i didn't notice till you mentioned it lol
---
Ty
---
I've got the arktos backback skin from doing project paradise.
---
The backbacks have a handful of in-game unlock-able skins so that'd also keep the standard uncommon.
---
Submit a 500 word essay.
---
üòÅüòÅ
---
I wonder that as well, i think the biggest issue will be allowing mods while allowing access to the base servers without getting banned.
---
In theory, if they can work that out, any mods will be okay. If not, then it might be only limited to cosmetics.
---
Buy a lottery ticket today.
---
I sell them if I‚Äôm not using them.
---
What do you mean by mandated? None of the things in the atomic shop I'd say were or are mandatory.
---
No, I just started playing the damn game
---
I mean they said at the very beginning that when the private world functionality was added, it would be a paid service. Servers ain't free yo.
---
But that's not the opinion of the wider playerbase who care about the longevity of the game. Black Ops 4 started out fairly innocent, CoD Points only being able to buy cosmetics...and then Loot box exclusive OP guns were added and the game died faster than a 9 year old playing Dark Souls.
---
Having a p2w system in *any* game is never good for it's lifespan.
---
Grinding and farming Legendaries for incredible weapons and armour is basically 90% of 76s endgame content, so if I can just buy an OP gun from the Atomic Shop in minutes, why would I even play the game anymore?
---
Kinda like how the backpacks implemented? (Complete side tangent but HOW DO I GET THE BACKPACK)
---
ahh that makes sense i guess. thank you!
---
If they want to sell me some more immersive, novelty items that have some minor utility, like the Collectron? Great, I‚Äôm fine with that. That‚Äôs a novelty item, not really a utility. Hell, I‚Äôd buy tons of this sort of thing and I don‚Äôt need it to really do anything but be fun. 
---
Things like ammo scrapping or converting should be part of the game. Not being able to do it was a bad design choice to begin with. Don‚Äôt you dare try to sell me solutions to fix problems caused by half-assed work or intentionally inconvenient mechanics.
---
Yeah definitely threw away a few energy / plasma explosives because I disliked energy an plasma weapons at the time.
---
I like all 3 though I feel the fusion core charger would need a nerf somehow. Otherwise you could farm like 4 fusion packs and be good.
---
You think so?
---
What people I trust have told me. You act like people don't discuss games with rheir friends
---
Make them only rechargable once and only for 50%, if they are broken under 10% they arent rechargable anymore cause they are to used. Dies that Sound good
---
This is a terrific and well thought out comment. If bethesda doesn't reply to this here post this again in a week as a stand alone post because you hit every point that I've hated about the atomic shop from the start.
---
The topic gets fiery any time an update drops. A new business = a new paywall = more isolation for people who can't afford it...unless you bought money of course :)
---
Low level players ruining my end game by having 65% of the map dedicated to them, yet whinge when wandering into the only high level areas we have left.
---
Yea except killing the power doesn‚Äôt help if someone‚Äôs still at your vending machine lol. They need to fix that ASAP imo.
---
Haha, man I‚Äôve been experiencing this. Almost broke through the stratosphere.
---
I totally understand and agree with your sentiment (especially since it was in the Pitt and we havent seen it since). I just want to get rid of my 3000 .38 rounds damnit!. And like the way I see it, if it is implemented it wont be free. The fridge and collectron showed that. So we might as well give them ideas of things wed actually like to see.
---
There are three quest stages that work as regular quests do, and for the Growth one you have to complete three Tadpole challenges. You can check them all in the same place  you can check the atoms challenges. They are under "World" I believe. When the quest is complete you get the backplack plan as a reward.
---
Call me cocky, but if there's an alien out there I can't kill I haven't met him and killed him yet. ...But I can't go in alone. That's why I'm ordering every available ship to report for duty. Anyone without a ship should secure a weapon and fire wildly into the air.
---
Agree with the sentiment. The community also needs to come together and ban the phrase "I would pay Atoms for" because it's not like Bethesda is saying "fuck them, throw it in the shop" it's that a majority of posts and comments in a suggested thread have that sentence in it. Sure, maybe people are trying to meme with it. But if I worked at Beth, and saw all those comments I would think that is what the community wants.
---
Actually yeah, balances them quite evenly tbh. Now if only they could IMPLEMENT IT BETHESDA CMON! (not yelling at you)
---
I came across a random encounter with a mega sloth vailantly trying to defend it's babies.( Can't rember from what...)  They were both deadüò≠ More sad cause I feel like the mega sloth is the chilliest "enemy", only kill them for atoms(so only in the Bog lol).
---
There was even a data-miner/modder who won a bet with his friend by predicting exactly the way how Bethesda would mess up a patch back then
---
I saw someone for the first time a couple weeks ago. I was watching him attack the queen in the air then WWOOOOSSSHHHH!!! I was like, wtf am I seeing this right!? He was like a ballistic missile launching into the sky man it was neat. Then of coarse the super dramatic re entry and iron man landing made it a pretty cinematic thing to randomly witness.
---
Thanks dude! I gave up on trying to get it as I had no clue how to continue.
---
This ‚Üë‚Üë‚Üë should be the article and not just a comment.
---
well there have been tons of Atomshop skins that were simply lurking in the files for months without use
---
Who knows what else they might already have in store if need arises
---
Sneak perks prettt much start at level 30. Unless you have escape artist good luck. That shrouded wooden armor MIGHT help at his level without the sneak perks.
---
I bought a fridge because I had a bunch of atoms from dailys and achievements.  I thought I'd have a slight use for it but the only time I have used it was when I had a bunch of scorchbeast food items that were about to spoil but wanted to use but also was going to be AFK for a while.  I don't regret the purchase (because it didn't actually cost me any real $) but I shouldn't have bought it.
---
To each their own i guess...with skyrim and fallout 4 i beat the games legit, then used mods for op weapons and armor and replayed them.  I still play those games do to replayability with mods and addons.  Ive had a lot of fun with 76 and id do the same with it.  Im more upset with dupers.  If the p2w items come out of the atom shop, then theyd only be used by that player and no one else which i like.
---
Yes you are correct. Which makes this a pretty neat little detail!
---
That's what I'm gonna do. I'll probably hop on to see if the Halloween event is worth it, if it is I'll play that and then give it up until the next update.
---
If it's not, I don't think I'll touch it again until Wastelanders.
---
Hopefully Outer Worlds keeps my interest. Then Luigi's Mansion comes out.
---
I just worry that with all the games coming out in the next 6 months that 76 might legit lose a big portion of its player base. Specifically because there are a couple pretty big RPGs coming out. Outer Worlds and Cyberpunk. Plus Pokemon before the year ends. And Animal Crossing early next year.
---
I understand and totally agree with the delay of Wastelanders but ugh ugh ugh, I see this fucking them over. Especially because undoubtedly there will still be bugs and there will be some people that enjoy the game the way it was before it.
---
Yea haha, there have been a few times where I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be coming back down.
---
Yes, however many games let you host your own server on your own machine, giving you a free option.
---
There's a big "yet" attached to that.  Bethesda has clearly opened the door.
---
Maybe I am wrong about this, as I do not play those games, but are Ark and Conan not originally PC games made by indie developers? Is it usual to allow player hosted servers in console focused games sold by "AAA" publishers, that are designed to be entirely online, use dedicated servers, and rely on microtransactions as the main source of revenue?
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
I don't get this mentality. Are you mad that they are adding things that the community asked for? Is it just because it's in the Atomic Shop? That I do get.
---
But I feel like just saying they're selling community ideas back to us ignores what it takes to actually flesh out the design for and then implement the thing. Then they have to test it.
---
Beyond that it's a refrigerator... That keeps food from spoiling. This is not groundbreaking stuff. The community did not invent this idea. Bethesda almost certainly thought of it while designing the game. The community asking for it probably just convinced them it was something worth implementing rather than just trying to tweak food spoilage rates.
---
76 is closest to 4, so you probably won't like it. That said, 76 is a different game than any other Fallout. If there's a reason it drew you in other than it having the name "Fallout" then I suggest you watch some gameplay to further your interests. Otherwise, it's probably not for you.
---
the good news is I'll never spend money on microtransactions if the cosmetics repeatedly look fucking dumb
---
Burdens on you since you made the claim
---
Or fast-travel if needed to.
---
Nice try, Todd.
---
Oh absolutely I dont disagree, but is Bethesda really as bad as Activision and EA? Maybe I'm just blinded by the old days of Bethesda but I really dont think they'll go that far. I hope I'm right though, cause I absolutely love this game (been talking with my friends since FO3 how great itd be to fight deathclaws together and now we are) and I really dont want to give up on the franchise. Already have given up on a few the last few years lol
---
This.
---
I mean, not to be pessimistic, but what meager Adventure content we've gotten since Wild Appalachia has been pretty mediocre, if not outright bad.  That's why having everything apparently ride on Wastelanders breeds so much cynicism.
---
It‚Äôs Fo4 with multiplayer, I love it and you might, but you might not. There are events and items that cycle through and certain things you can‚Äôt get anymore, the longer you wait to try it then your certain to miss out on a lot of things like this Halloween event coming up
---
It's going to be broken anyway, every bigger content DLC they released had some major bugs or simply design flaws that took them too long to patch.
---
For now I would wait even longer after Wastelanders release until starting to play it because if the choices you make matter and are permanent I rather want those to work and not glitch out and maybe make my character take a choice that I didn't even click on. (One might remember the 'sell'-bug where you could accidentally sell or scrap a different item from your inventory than you intended to because the highlight marker would move behind the confirmation box
---
Just fast travel to somewhere near by..
---
Modding will be available only at some unspecified time in the future, according to the Inside the Vault article. For now, it is just private worlds.
---
I enjoyed 76 - but if they're going to double down on going directly against their sales promises and the majority of the community's desires, I'll find it hard to purchase future titles. It simply puts forward the message that we'll pay for a product more than once, when the agreement was an outright purchase.
---
The vast majority of players have been outspoken against adding p2w aspects - especially since many of us purchased only under the knowledge that we were promised they would not be present.
---
Having Bethesda claim we're actually asking for this, when there's such vehement outcry against it is going to harm their sales figures on future titles. 
---
It's not just that it's dishonest, it's that we can't take them at their word for the next game either.
---
&gt;where players can spend money to gain a competitive advantage or make the game worse for other players.
---
This is the only form of closure that we get, but it's still not precise or conclusive as to *what* kind of things they'll be selling. I'm glad that weapons and armor will likely not be added to the shop due to them being 'competitive advantages', but that still isn't clear enough, and besides, it's not like Bethesda haven't already lied on multiple occasions...
---
In theory I'm not against games-as-service but the industry is treating it like they can put out an unfinished game and then hold the rest of the game for ransom until players pony up more cash.
---
With that luck! YES
---
How did you make a pool?
---
Level 5 suits spawn in the alien tnt dome!
---
Maybe they game will crash and uninstall..oh wait...yeah,we had that too already 
---
Chances are the servers will simply crash, the db gets erased and every hint at you every buying a server gets deleted with it so you start anew but with less money
---
A robot that fills my health bars of my camp. Don‚Äôt make it have to physically reach any of it. Have him just walk around like the collection maybe throwing sparks like he‚Äôs fixing random things or stuff like but when the house is not under attack I want my stuff to slowly repair.
---
You can get any atomic shop item free by earning points and buying it.  That is in the basic game and it's the same as grinding legendaries to get the ones you want. It takes alot of time. I just hate the fact that they delete out items from the shop.
---
ZAX is  not a proper name, but the name of a whole category of supercomputers invented by Vault-Tec, many of which have become thinking entites. The Vault 51 ZAX isn't the only one in existence, other notable ZAX units are President John Henry Eden, the ZAX in the West-Tek facility called The Glow in Fallout 1,and several were employed as Overseers.
---
In a real world perspective, since that's a Nuclear Winter reward, it's implied Vault 51 ZAX signed it. But from an in-universe point of view, since that's a VTU diploma, it's unlikely they are the same ZAX unit.
---
no, I am ready for new things after a thousand hours.
---
Fast traveled from my camp to Watoga and as the screen went to load in all my armor broke üëçüèΩ
---
While I'm not saying you're wrong for disliking how games get released nowadays. It is super frustrating and I was absolutely livid when this game came out. But a game is not a car. Software is a different beast to physical goods. You're comparing apples to oranges.
---
Agreed.
---
Keep in mind with the 250 damage bug you will lose the Bloodied damage unless you swap weapons or reload while crouched. Hopefully, they someday fix it.  Still a very nice gun.
---
No, I agree. I am ready for new stuff like you can't believe. I'm just worried that I won't like all the changes they make.
---
I'll just end up wandering around Appalachia even more annoyed than usual.
---
Companies üëè are üëè not üëè your üëè friends üëè
---
a little bit.. thats why I plan to kill as many of them as possible
---
I'm sure that won't be allowed. As it would fuck with other people's experiences.
---
But that's because, in essence, Fallout 76 gameplay-wise is nothing like Fallout 4 or Skyrim.
---
They're both Singleplayer games so having a form of p2w item does less harm because there aren't any other players that can be affected by it. As soon as p2w aspects affect the playerbase, *that's* when shit can fan *quick*.
---
You should be looking for a weapon weight reduction piece instead of another ammo maybe. After you would cut the ammo weight a third time I don‚Äôt think it would be as beneficial as 1 wwr. I run 4 wwr with deep pockets but honestly I think I‚Äôm going to take off deep pockets for ultra light because I think that gives you better AP refresh. Ok now I see your trying to switch your chest out for a limb as far as awr goes but Ive already typed this out so I‚Äôm going to post it anyways.
---
Everyone is hyping it up to be Fallout 5. I'd be cool with that. But I'd also like to have the option to keep playing it as it is, as it has the most playability of any of the Fallouts
---
You should probably mention what platform you're on. Welcome back!
---
Well, it *will* be nice, if they ever fix that 250 DR bug.
---
5.56
---
I weirdly sort of like the emptiness sometimes.
---
I kinda wish this was a greater part of the discussion. People equate 500 atmos to $5.00 but that doesn't mean someone 
---
 with 500 atoms has spent a dime.
---
It would be nice to acknowledge the rate at which you can earn atoms.
---
The part where I feel like this looses some steam is when you consider utility purchases are probably designed to eat into your atom funds. Thus making it harder for you to spend those atoms on cosmetics.
---
True. I've only used the backpack skins you can earn as rewards. However, my backpack is 'hidden' because I use the Traveling Leather Coat which has its own backpack and hides my modded one.
---
Bobby Pins and spoiled meat
---
The way Bloodied has taken over the market makes it difficult to actually find useful weapons for other builds
---
The cap is 3k? Since when? I'm currently at 4.6k
---
Meh. Its my playground and I don't really care about events and community stuff.
---
 I am happy to help individuals if I can, but its not my purpose.
---
What is the reasoning behind that? Doesn't seem like a scarcity issue. Is it carry weight and is there no limit to the amount you can accrue? What is 5.56 to caps? 1 cap per unit of ammo?
---
You said it yourself. $$$
---
Sorry - 30K. I'll edit above
---
I got pie, trading for a 2 shot explosive bloodied .50 with ffr, and 90% weight reduction :) 5* only.
---
I feel like playing together as a team is gonna be so rare now.
---
Bivs the robot gives you new quest to complete and that‚Äôs how you get it. Also check player vendors.
---
I've gone from excited to ambivalent, mostly based on their recent track record of additions (not very good) and what little they've shown.
---
What I'm expecting is little more than the "Another settlement needs our help" kind of Radiant stuff from Fallout 4.  The human NPCs are just robots with a different skin.  In what pictures they've released, we've seen these generic shopkeeper poses back in Fallout 4.
---
It will be something new and random to do, no doubt.  It will come with new items to find.  But I'm not counting on it to be the second coming because nothing they've released this entire year inspires that degree of confidence.
---
Cap is 30k caps per toon, so 150k per account. The vending machine might still max out at 25k per item for price setting.
---
But on those games you cannot jump with  your character from the public servers to the private ones
---
They probably meant 30k
---
That‚Äôs the thing. It‚Äôs readily available but also holds its value at almost exactly 1:1 and therefore is in equilibrium for supply/demand. You‚Äôre also able to hold much more of it, so for those reasons, it is commonly used as currency.
---
Agree. This and materials, etc, stuff people with too many caps would like to not be bothered to have to get themselves. Or need more than they can find in time to do whatever.
---
Everyones going to have their own immersion in the game I believe so if I kill someone (if allowed) it should still be there for you
---
Go check out the market and just browse the posts. You'll get a pretty clear picture of what is being sought.
---
You were going to find that legendary sheepsquatch? Too bad mate!
---
Well thats why i said that IS my opinion.  I only play solo, im only playing a MP game now due to fo76 being a multiplayer game.  I dont play nw, survival or initiate pvp.  Im strictly pve on pacifist.  Even though p2w would be bad for you and other people that like MP, it doesnt effect me to the slightest.  It is actually better for me when people complain and quit the game.
---
Ayyy dog food and purified water gang
---
 No. I put in a harassing ticket because you cannot buy a gift from Bethesda. They got right back and I mocked them through about 6 exchanges. Even got a job offer. ;)
---
Lol good luck with that
---
If you could build a set with sentinel it is honestly stupid good! Buying these pieces is super expensive and they are pretty hard to come across. The big thing for me is the carry weight benefit. I have weight reduction perks on and 4 pieces of weapon weight reduction so I‚Äôm literally carrying over a thousand pounds of stuff crammed into my inventory. I think it reduces down to about 475 pounds leaving me with 10 lbs of wiggle room. I‚Äôm trying to drop some weight but with the 150 scrip limit and me just blowing a thousand scrip at the purveyor, I think it‚Äôs going to be a while! Anyways I love running bloodied but the poison resistance pieces would be huge! And i run fireproof instead of dense torso and I take no damage from scorchbeast‚Äôs scream attack. The crop dusting attack on the other hand melts me almost instantly! That‚Äôs were the poison pieces come into play.
---
More like 2pcs per cap. 
---
The reason is that handmades have a certain glitch that allows to proc the first shot twice thus doubling the damage, thus they get used more and no one has fun jumping around to collect lead to make ammo.
---
Ah, you mean real world currency? I'm mostly curious about in-game, but I know there are outside markets where you can purchase for actual money.
---
It's a reward from Biv
---
&gt; Todd promised us a free offline way to play the game. 
---
Did he..? When was that?
---
I know it when I see it, but it's the one with the safe in the rafters behind the boxes on the right side of the camp.  The side of the camp with the archery range. I suck at directions, haha.
---
*points at terraria*
---
And in any case if we're talking about mods, it would be an objectively horrible idea to be able to have a modded character jump into a vanilla server and back, think of all the cheating/save file corruption that would happen.
---
I would  like small shields for one handed weapon users. Improvised ones like home made wood and leather,  trash can lids, small police riot shields. Don't think there would be a big market for two handed shields.
---
Okay, something to consider. Are private worlds persistent? As in are they accessible even when the owner is offline? (genuinely not sure) Because I'd bet that the free servers you're talking about don't allow that.
---
I'm drawing my experience from minecraft, where you can "host" a world that others can join but is not persistent. This is a free service. But as soon as you want a persistent world that anyone can join at any time, that requires the purchase of a server or realm (which is an official server.)
---
 You can get a reliable 2 floors with the Jet Pack. Probably 3 with Marsupial, but to really fly you need Bird Bones as well. ;)
---
Well I never meant to say that this way of playing the game is wrong, my whole point is that this way is only , enjoyed by a very little minority, and that it is also not the way intended to be played but just what happened due to bad gameplay design. Is like people who idk play fortnite to just build houses instead of fighting. Like good for them but that is not what the game was supposed to be about.
---
Also, you shouldn't come swinging calling people "a dick" if you can't even understand the problem. :D
---
Why would they shut down the servers when they have a steady player base and make money off of micro transactions? Also, when new players buy the game they‚Äôre met with ‚ÄúSorry we have shut our servers off until Feb!‚Äù 
---
There are more people playing through the game still than people who have nothing to do.
---
Pie is not  rare there is a piece on the roof of Wes Tek.
---
IMO we still haven't gotten enough content to justify the base cost of the game.
---
You come in here telling everyone the game is bad when we all actually play the game and have fun lol
---
Hah... I did not know that. My dreams of trading my 3 pieces of legit RNG pie are dashed in a moment
---
I see you are just set on being mad based on your own speculation and not based one what was actually said.
---
Okay, just another update today...I literally just checked my PIP boy and it's gone back to 10/23/2102. What gives, Bethesda?
---
it seems like you are talking about the regular adventure mode &amp; they are talking about Nuclear Winter
---
Find a pond or something and use concrete floor to sink into the ground around the water
---
Backpacks exist?
---
I never said you yourself couldn't have an opinion, this isn't China. Everyone has their preferences and I respect yours, even if it may differ from what some people think in this sub, and that's completely fine. 
---
Fallout 4 being a singleplayer game makes it the perfect sandbox to play with powerful weapons because it doesn't directly harm anyone else, it's just that in a multiplayer game, a good p2w system simply can't exist.
---
Drawing off my experience from minecraft, you can run a server that is accessible at all times for free. It's slightly complicated, which means that in many cases hosting a realm is just easier, but for those who don't want to pay or know how to run a server, the option is there.
---
You're probably talking about hosting a LAN game, which yes, is not persistent and cannot be joined at all times, however that is not what I'm talking about.
---
I think 2 is a stretch, but I could see where in some cases it has a slightly higher value. I trade every day and rarely see an exchange rate higher than 1.25 (5.56 sells regularly 1:1 on the market).
---
And i totally understand
---
I don't think that Fallout 76 counts as a MMO. There is no massive multiplayer in this game.
---
If you asked me a year ago, I wouldn't have thought EA and Bethesda had much in common.  There was truth to the #SavePlayer1 campaign.  The modern EA would *never* make a game like Prey, for example.  You'd never believe they were once capable of producing something like Dead Space 2, given that they can't even get mobile *Tetris* right.
---
But then, on the Bethesda side of things, we've had the twin Wolfensteins that went over like a lead balloon.  We've had the MTX-laden TES: Blades.  We've witnessed the abortion that is the new Commander Keen.  The mediocre Rage 2, which has its own tepid little "roadmap" of features that promise to turn it around.  Doom Eternal will get the same thing - it's been delayed and some key features are already being shoved off for future updates.  Everything else, like Deathloop, Ghostwire, and even Starfield, is just too vague to comment on.
---
Bethesda ultimately has more financial and creative independence than EA and Activision because they are privately-owned and not beholden to Wall Street.  But like any business, they have to make money, and you can't do it off the back of things like Prey.  And with Starfield still light years away, and TES6 and Fallout 5 seemingly farther than that, you have to wonder if the allure of easy MTX money will poison the well before they get here.
---
Never give companies the benefit of the doubt, that's just my rule.
---
(Especially when they have a track record of going back on what they say)
---
it's also really fun because you get to feel like you're playing detective, and solved the mystery of how certain skeletons got there.
---
I don't see it being more than instanced humanoid questgivers that you might he able to kill, or recruit for short periods of time. And if what I've heard about the first vault raid is true, the instancing technology might not exactly be stable for a minute. And yeah, probably a few areas you can't camp now.
---
Dual wielding could be too much. I own most type of revolvers, and imagine how Doc Holliday I would get if I was allowed to start the battle with my instigating western revolver and fire the second shot with my executioner western revolver. 
---
People would call me "two-shots-andy" and I would have to change my name legally. 
---
Jokes aside, I would like to be able to punch using both hands and two knuckles.
---
sure thing, armchair developer
---
On top of only having 400 stash limit, there was also that your stuff wasn't organized, so you'd have to scroll through EVERYTHING to get to what you needed.
---
Yes. A small one at Morgantown airport in the overseers box and a larger one that the skins in the Atom Shop work with that you get through the Tadpole quest line.
---
I mean, that too, but my biggest concerns are skins for things that don't even work...I have a feeling the majority of alien blaster skin purchases were either as a meme, or by people who never knew about it and thought it was a super powerful new weapon added recently. Not to mention the ridiculous prices on them
---
When you say their track record? I assume you are referring to that one interview where talks
---
About there being a line?
---
Either way your outrage isn‚Äôt based on what they said clearly. You are outraged because you want to be outraged. Your entire post is telling people to be mad based on what the recently said but can‚Äôt point me to what I should be mad about lol
---
I even pasted the excerpt where they talk about the atomic shop so you can tell me what is so horrible haha
---
With everyone I talk to, it‚Äôs unanimous that we‚Äôre all concerned that Wastelanders will still be rough, even with the extra months they‚Äôve added to work on it. Hope for the best, prepare for disappointment.
---
I don't know if you've heard, but they plan to become a publicly trading company.
---
Ok guys i got it working i basicaly disconnected my ps4 from the internet and reconnected it that seemed to work was a wee bit disappointed to find i didnt have enough atoms but what ever lol. Thanks for the help!
---
You forgot loot boxes
---
Haven't been playing it for a whole year. I just play it from time to time to see where things are going with the updates (i think i am only lvl 47). But I am more active here and also closely watching what is happening with the game on official site, youtube and some other sites. I would play it more if I would actually enjoy it. And I did enjoy Fallout 2, 3 and 4.
---
Gonna give you a list of things you missed. This is a copy paste message and may not be applicable to the questions asked. Reply and I'll go into detail on things if you want
---
March is when they actually started improving the game, from Nov-Feb it was only bug fixes and a boring world. Not listing things in any order, you missed:
---
two weeklong holiday events (minor addition)
---
alcohol crafting with daily quests (minor addition) 
---
a camera for taking quicker pictures (minor addition)
---
New faction and questline with backpack reward (large addition)
---
Sheepsquatch questline with unique weapon reward and side quests, two repeatable events (major addition)
---
Small dungeon with quest (small addition)
---
Large dungeon with repeatable event (large addition)
---
Player Vending Machines (small addition)
---
Nuclear Winter game mode with 51 other players in a battle Royale scenario with special cosmetic rewards (major addition)
---
Special vendor that gives random Legendaries in exchange for other Legendaries (small addition)
---
Vault Raid which gives guaranteed armor rewards with unique set bonuses (major addition)
---
Display cases for your camp which allows you to place items so visitors can view them (minor addition)
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say vault raids or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but it's coming out early next year
---
two shot? that way the laggy invisible delayed projectiles will have a higher chance of actually hitting something. or explosive, wouldn't put it past them to have left it off the energy explosive nerf list since not even they seem to remember it exists. If it shot explosive bullets, the alien blaster would actually be a viable weapon in the forest
---
Nuclear Winter's "perk packs" are a single card, which will burn itself and turn in an overseer ticket if you already have a copy of it. So you probably have some tickets to spend on a new perk of your choosing.
---
Got lots of really great gear. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt carry it all so my vendor has got a lot of great business!
---
Always forget to say that in a post! Thank you!
---
Sigh, if this game didn't have "fallout" in the title and had to make due on it's own merits it would have never made a dime and would have been completely forgotten about in a week like some shitty steam asset flip.
---
It‚Äôs the same people who don‚Äôt use their turn signal while driving. Just straight up unintelligent. No good reason.
---
The items will come back but it will take a very long time before they put them in the rotation, they will bring them back for themed events or if they don't have any ideas for a theme, The fruit basket hat was the first limited timed item in the shop when it first came out then we also got the dare devil outfit as well as the blackbird pa and all of those returned, not as a permanent stay but as another limited time offer, the only thing I've seen not return from the very beginning is the cowhide western outfit. If they removed items completely it would be a missed opportunity for them.
---
It happens with all shotguns. I stopped using my shotgunner. Bye, bye. 
---
It's stupid for my hits to take 95 percent of health and 80 percent just bounces back. Last time I used my instigating pump I needed ten shells at close distance to kill a glowing ghoul. The next ghoul, I just hit it with my instigating ski Sword and he died in two hits. 
---
I had all shotgun perks equipped, not a single melee perk. 
---
The only thing that still works from shotguns Is enforcer, to cripple enemies.
---
Lol no, I mean I picked up somebody‚Äôs cheated inventory after I killed them and logged off with it on me
---
I only carry 2 rifles around with me, so the weights on those isnt too bad. But I have an addiction to crafting ultracite ammo for my handmade, so I end up carrying around over 20,000 rounds. I used to have nothing for weight reduction because I thought damage and defence were more important. But theyre no good if you‚Äôre overweight all the time. Lol.
---
I guess I should return my anti armor handmade and junkies explosive combat rifle since they are garbage.
---
I like this idea a lot tbh!
---
That would be a smart way of doing it, I guess.
---
yeah thing is even with junkies/bloodied/explosive it would maybe be enough to just be about the same as other weapons
---
pic or it didn't happen
---
I really loved the Mr. Pebbles backpack, but it doesn't quite fit my character, and as much as the "keep out" backpack cracked me up, it also didn't quite fit my character. So right now mine just has the in game tadpole skin.
---
Damn straight. I pre-ordered, it was the first time I've ever done that, and the last. Now not only will I never pre-order a game again I will NEVER purchase or play another Bethesda game. I don't care if Starfield is the second coming of Jesus, I'll find some other company to support who aren't total lying scum bags.
---
As it turnes out the Quest is not broken,the guide was üòÅ the description was hussled up I gues .. the police car didn't start the Quest but needed allong the way ü§î
---
I think you have a point here cause lets take a moment and ask ourselves. Why would bethesda allow us to freely host private servers and mod them? If that is allowed people hosting servers may actually fix the game and then no one would want to play official servers lol. There has to be a catch
---
Thanx 4 all the help ...
---
As far as i know I didn't have this issue a month or so ago when I modded the other pieces, I don't really want to try and mod other pieces. I would have to buy plans/mods or equip mods that would destroy my current mods.
---
I was already worried about that before the raids came out, but that kind of solidified it. They're ignoring the game breaking bugs we already have and including new ones with pretty much every major update. The humans will be buggy and the dialogue "trees" with non-consequential skill checks will be only slightly more immersive than the robots we already have. Raider encounters will most likely be reskinned scorched with the same braindead AI. All I want is for the game to be playable, until then anything new they add is worthless
---
This...
---
Never post on here for reasons I won't go into but I gotta say this.
---
The fridge is absolutely useless. They can't make it better than in game alternatives like the GWS perk or the refrigerated backpack because then people could argue (rightfully so) that its pay to win. It also does nothing to allow us to sell expirable food in a vending machine. We probably never will be able to. 
---
If they made it a quest, they could actually make it useful instead of having to nerf it to uselessness. Oh, and then I'd actually be interested in getting skins for it. I'm not paying for a utility item that's useless, and if they keep putting them in the atomic shop, they will continue to disappoint...
---
Why? I have 559 hours in the game... clearly got my money‚Äôs worth.
---
Oh!!!!!!! That‚Äôs what NW meant. I was thinking north west... I‚Äôm dumb
---
yeah, we need metal railings bethesda, im fat and i drink a lot and keep falling off high places :(
---
Who said I was mad? It's an observation with a relevant movie quote.
---
------
---
Community: Hey it would be real cool if we could take this fridge that's already in the game and has absolutely no use as a camp item and make use of it to store food in!
---
Bethesda: Yeah, that's gonna be $7
---
-------
---
It doesn't even store food well. 50% shorter spoilage time for an item that doesn't add storage weight, isn't affected by "Good with Salt" or carry weight perks. They didn't "Flesh out an idea" they added an item and put a n% on it. They didn't spend hours painstakingly modeling a fridge, making a skin for it, and introduce it to a game that didn't already have one. 
---
I don't see the use for it, so I didn't buy it. Am I going to buy it? Fuck no, $7 for a god damn fridge? 
---
Your horse is so high I can't even see you right now.
---
But how much grinding it is actually required to buy 1 utility item and 1 cosmetic item that you really like? Don't forget that they also removed some atom points that you could previosly get from challenges and replaced them with useless stuff.
---
There‚Äôs a ‚Äúfree‚Äù half-size backpack in the base game now but it‚Äôs not skinnable to my knowledge
---
In all honesty if they could do one favor and give us single player local hosting, not even for multiplayer, single player only.  I'd start buying Atoms again.
---
Downvote me all you want, when you're a high level and have like 4 good places to go get a "challenge" you'll look back at this post in regret.
---
This is the tragedy of Fallout 76. It‚Äôs supposed to be a collecting and hoarding game, but the limits don‚Äôt allow that. Don‚Äôt keep anything for sentimental reasons. Especially some of the named legendaries. Like bunker buster and pyrolizer. Those items are just too heavy. If you have any power armor stashed, make sure it‚Äôs on a chassis. That saves weight.
---
I looked through it and it doesn‚Äôt mention anywhere about appealing it
---
üòÇ 100%
---
It resets 8pm Eastern. Been running raids every day for over a month and that is the behavior I've seen.
---
Instigating was my friend when leveling up and still is. I wouldnt do bloodied being a sneeze away from death at a low level. Headshots all day for a instant kill, especially WS.
---
What exactly are you trying to do? Mod it ornchange the skin?
---
Eat honey before you use the jet pack and it lasts about 4 times longer.
---
No sprinting jumps though, sprinting cancels out the honey.
---
I have the fridge for cosmetic reasons only. I use dog food and purified water. I just love the way the bloody fridge looks. Never been used though.
---
Awesome, thanks for your help
---
Doesn‚Äôt recruitment blues adn it‚Äôs follow-ons make you go to Ft Defiance?  If so, that would explain why a 23 is there.
---
I've had friends that are are very excited, and this is what I keep telling them. With the way everything has gone, if anyone expects Bethesda to NOT monetize private servers, they will be sadly disappointed. Two of them are also convinced it will include independent mod support.  They read something in the announcement that has them convinced that's what is coming.
---
I do that every time I join the event. I also invite people to my team (I play solo) so we can share even the ones which are accidentally killed before tagging. 
---
It's like a filter for adding friends. If you are a gentleman during Uranium Fever, you can be trusted.
---
You want to marry the assaultron don't you?
---
Oh damn that must be nice!!! I can‚Äôt help but keep a hundred weapons on me! Lol it‚Äôs such a horrible practice to get into. I just recently started hoarding 5.56 and now I feel like I‚Äôm ‚Äúrunning low‚Äù if I‚Äôm at 15-16k! So stupid. I have bandolier 2 on so it doesn‚Äôt weigh much.
---
I remember when you could but all the unwanted legendarys from artisan corner. Oh and having to hop across ever faction vendor bot in order to get all the caps.
---
go to menu  "change appearance" ...done
---
I love those little moments while adventuring through the map and noticing something new.
---
I stumbled across a glowing fairy ring/fairy circle just last night.
---
Yeah. It was the first time I had ever been in a nuke zone in the more. Good for flux.
---
You pick up a shovel and pretend it is the one. My hunter carries an anti-armor one to teach those molerats a lesson.
---
Just because you can start a quest doesnt mean you should
---
Flux, since it is used to make Ultracite ammo. Violet Flux being the most valuable.
---
"community" üòÇ
---
&gt;Never post on here for reasons I won't go into but I gotta say this.
---
...why did you feel the need to even mention this?
---
at least it would have been made in a better game engine like frostbite XD
---
Oh it will totally be B, absolutely without a doubt. Of course they are going to sell the only mods you can get for the game. There is no way they are going to let people have servers where they can mod in cosmetics and bypass the shop, it won't happen. 
---
They don't like that you can mod skyrim without paying them, that's where to creation club came from. But people didn't use the CC that much because you could just dl mods that were often better. To put a stop to that they developed an always online game that players can't make mods for. It was their intent from the very beginning.
---
There are a lot of details that are clearly placed intentionally by the developers. They're placed out so cleverly, so fittingly and sometimes so randomly. It's great.
---
I recently found something....interesting....in Gauley Mine. To the right as you enter the mine proper, there's a locker room with toilets. Someone had, at some point in time, clearly been trying to cook something in one of the toilets.....or eat what was in it. There was a ladle in the toilet itself, on the toilet seat was a glass bowl and on the floor around the toilet there were salt, pepper and spices.
---
Because it's an issue that's significant enough for me to want to bring it up. I could say the same for you deciding to ask?
---
It's not so much the date change that is significant, it's that it never changes that's important I think‚Äîyou can go see that in your own PIP boy.
---
Some of the questlines lead you to places you are not quit ready to go.  Back burner the mission for a few levels.
---
Work on the Mysteries questline and the parts of Roses quest that are in the forest.
---
@23, the toxic valley is level appropriate.  When you are close to 30, head to the ash heap and pick up the excavator quest.  
---
By the time you are done with that, you should be better prepared for some of the areas on the right side of the map.
---
Good thing bringing Terraria up, that's exactly why we don't want user hosted servers, where is the fun if you can log into a server and give yourself the best weapons, and then go back and ruin everyone else fun? Because that's how I recall terraria multiplayer was.
---
Every free Minecraft/terraria/GTA server is P2P, in Wich the host can set the rules and if the host go offline the world goes offline, and they are not free! Someone is either paying a rent to a third party host or paying the electric bill in their houses.
---
FO76 are going to be rented servers. Right now , when you hit "Adventure mode" it takes you to a server that Bethesda itself is renting to Amazon cloud Services, when the privates servers go online I'm pretty sure is going to be the same thing, except that you would join the world alone and you would be able to invite/ban people, and since they basically are going to be just another server with the same Bethesda game rules, you are going to be able to use the same characters in either private or public servers.
---
Is not that hard to understand then, that if Bethesda would gave a private server for free to each one of us they would need to pay around 1 dollar per hour of use to amazon(I don't know the exact price they pay), at that point it would be more profitable to them to just shut down everything.
---
Why is so hard to people to understand such a simple concept?
---
Certified Scorched moment
---
Why? That would mean everybody and there brother would have that same weapon first off, second you wouldn‚Äôt be able to trade it either.
---
Setting the bar too high. They are not going to give out the server files. Yeah a lot of us have dedicated servers at our disposal and it would be grand. But there is not going to be a barrier in place that separates character data in private vs public. These private servers are going to use existing characters and communicate with the master server for facilitating logins, connections, and character data sync. There is no way they would give out the server binary in this case, nor should anybody with any sense of security expect them to. Frankly, you wouldn't even need knowledge of disassembly and code injection to inflict your free will upon inventories of public characters under this architecture. You'd just need to figure out how to tamper with the data the synchronizes to the master. 
---
Why do I proclaim this? I admit that I do not have any inside information and I have not read anything that you have not. I infer this information from several facts. The screenshot they posted shows private worlds as a game mode. To reach that point in the menu, you must login, therefore communicating with the master server, and you must select a character (or default to your last selected character). Could they change that flow?....sure they could. Have they had enough time to do that?...no I don't think they have. Do they have a track record of putting that much effort into anything experimental that they release?....HELL NO. 
---
They are selling private servers to people who have been asking for them and saying they are willing to pay. 
---
* Discord communities interested in getting their entire group onto private servers for rapid queen farming without having to wait for slots to open up on a public server. 
---
* Groups wanting to do the vault raids without lag generated by whatever the 20 other people on the server are doing
---
* Pacifists who want to build workshop bases without fear of getting attacked
---
* PvP Discord groups that want to PvP without running into pacifists 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Don't expect fancy server administration tools. They can't even give their support staff tools. 
---
If this takes off we may see them put more effort into it with enhanced functionality. Right now they are looking for cash flow ideas to keep this game going. That doesn't mean the game is failing, it means they need to keep cash coming in to keep developing and keep hosting it. Bottom line. They are not going to heavily invest any time into something until they know it is going to pay off.
---
It will be B.
---
Bethesda isn't going to give you access to the server files when there's an 'official' server set that is their main active player base.  Too many ways for certain people to gain access to information that will facilitate exploits.  
---
Not to mention that once you have the files locally, they will lose any ability to charge a fee for that service (assuming they charge something for being able to host locally somehow), as people will quickly find a way to distribute the cracked files for free.  And I don't see that as a viable option just because of the first point.
---
It‚Äôs both. Like it or not but the atom shop supports the development of the game. If the shop isn‚Äôt supporting the game, then they need to do something different, or stop supporting the game. Those are the two options that exist for them.
---
The truth is in the math, 7+6=13, 1+3=4, This game is Fallout 4 and not anymore complex the Fallout 4 we played.
---
Why the fuck wouldn't it be? The "server" as we know it already just syncs everyone's stats. It's no better than being a simple host. Giving it for free would actually be NO overhead on the hardware side that they already have. It's just free money to them. 
---
76 is still based mainly in client side with the server stamping any action as possible or not. That's all the server does. This isn't like any other games where the server also has to generate the worlds, map rotations like in shooters, or sync an entire map of enemies that also had to be generated by the server not clients.
---
Real talk, I'm betting on them letting players jump from private servers to public, thus swirling any economy or balance that is left right down the tubes.
---
NO!
---
They will replace ATOMs with Scrip.
---
Don't even give that idea!
---
I'd just like to be able to use both my knuckle dusters, i call them pork n beans. Pork is anti armour and beans is bloodied.

Yeah I‚Äôm with you, I‚Äôll be playing either way because I love the game already. It seems like people are putting ‚Äúthe future of fallout 76‚Äù on wastelanders shoulders. Hopefully we‚Äôre not setting ourselves up to be disappointed. If there‚Äôs anything I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs to keep my expectations low lol
---
I never thought about bird bones!!! :)
---
How long can you stay up?
---
Bloodied market Is weird. I constantly find bloodied weapons at decent prices. Like, I sell them because I like my health high (instigating rules) but I once bought two legendaries. For less than 4000. Combat shotgun and handmade. Gave them some nice mods and sold them for 6000 each. I think i still might have a pump shotgun for 3000.
---
Hell yeah
---
Lol. I dont like to fall under 15k rounds either. Thats funny. Ive managed to avoid using perks for weight reduction. The extra 60 lbs from a level 50 backpack sure makes it easier. 
---
However, im currently a couple hundred lbs overweight at the purveyor. Lol. 50% off is great, but now I cant play until ive scripped that stuff.
---
On the contrary, you can find cheaper instigating and anti-armor, which are my cup of tea.
---
Well that seems like a terrible system. Wonder why Bethesda didn't just make it so that at caps limit you could no longer sell anything by any means until you spend down enough to sell at whatever value you want to sell. Oh yeah, because Bethesda. 
---
Thanks for the info, I'll probably just sell cheaper stuff in vendor and expensive stuff on the subs.
---
I just check the dailies and change my outfit according and get atoms everyday. It‚Äôs crazy easy to hit all the dailies with little to no effort. And thats like 50 atoms a day. My buddy has a few thousand just from doing that shit!
---
Less lag in vault missions. Paid 2 raid
---
Prime weapons are very niche, and the most popular gun, the handmade, doesn't really benefit greatly from the prime receiver.
---
What idea did we come up with?
---
Ive never had this problem with my primed explosive double barrel....thing fuckin slays
---
I figured you added that line in some self-righteous attempt to have other people think your comment has more weight because you are so concerned that you're gonna post about it *even though you never do*.
---
It really just comes off as pretentious right off the bat, is just totally unnecessary, and detracts from the point you're trying to make.
---
So I chuckled and shook my head when I read it. Here's to a little more self-awareness.
---
That's what I mean, I'll get dailies on accident, like I do a thing and the game says "here's some atoms"
---
You cant say that about all super mutants. Come on man, that's racist. /S
---
But seriously, there's some good ones out there. That's like saying all deathclaws are bad, but in fallout 2 you come across the talking deathclaws who want nothing but to protect humans and live in harmony before the enclave murdered almost all of them
---
This game definitely has a plateau that happens way faster than any other Bethesda game. I do not agree at all that this game has the most replayability.
---
Yeah some super mutants can keep memories if they weren't affected by radiation before they got dipped in FEV or something like that. Pure bloods basically
---
I'm just glad you're offering an opinion rather than asking for them.
---
Fallot 76 is not an mmo, it's a pos.
---
the fuck kind of backwoods is this
---
Of course someone like you would think that because that's your mindset, doesn't mean it's mine. I know nobody here and don't post here, there's nothing for me to gain, it's just my way of saying that the way they handle the atomic shop just gets frustrating.
---
I play b/c I like the game.  
---
I didnt buy 76 because of all the words/prepress.  I didnt read it.  I bought it because its fallout, and I really enjoyed previous versions, bugs, quirks, crashes, and all.  76 crashes way less than NV, but is nowhere near as stable as FO 3 and 4.
---
Some of the early stuff you mention didnt affect either me or my char.
---
Additionally, at L152, there are still a couple of missions and quests I have yet to complete, and a few places I have not yet explored.
---
I dont pay real money for atom shop item.  THe SBQ has given me repair kits, but I have yet to use them.  I dont need the scrap robot - as I manage to scrounge plenty of mats without it.  I dont need a fridge... so all that has no affect on my play, either.
---
Back to point a - I play by I like the game.
---
Well, with people wanting passive perks, I feel like something like that is along the way. Hopefully
---
Takes about 4 hours to get. A LOT of buggy missions and A LOT of swearing will occur because of that (obstacle course is maddening).
---
Bulk and sell everything, pick up everything, bulk sell repeat.
---
This could be a really fun addition depending on if and how they‚Äôre shareable
---
At least there‚Äôs no crown store gambling.
---
I bought the fridge thinking I could keep my primal meat in there to slow down it‚Äôs decomp, but nah. It‚Äôs totally worthless.
---
What can I say? I'm pleasently surprised. With the delay of the settlers add on, it really feels like Bethesda is trying to fix it's mistakes with this game in an honest way. I can really see this game being a very good, to great ass game in a year or so down the line. No man's sky is the perfect example of something like this evolving over time.
---
It's there somewhere, the guy even made a post apologizing fir it at fridges were released. I'm not going to go find it because, what, am I Mr. Go find shit on reddit guy? No I  am not.
---
A lot of people paid 10-20$ for the game probably even way cheaper support Bethesda don‚Äôt be so rough they put a lot of work and dedication into fallout they can‚Äôt work for free now
---
Alright I'll try the mysteries quest line. Your the first person to actually name quests that are in my level range so thanks.
---
I got a *3 bloodied Tesla for 2500 caps from a vendor yesterday. Now I‚Äôm looking for crystal to learn the mods.
---
I sell a lot of stimpaks. They go ready quickly. Stealthboys sell quick but are harder to acquire.
---
Would you like to know more?
---
 I dunno really, I don't run that. I did have a guy demo it for me once and he was up there a long time. ;)
---
I didn‚Äôt get what I paid for.
---
Ok but how does some guy buying a refrigerator negatively effect my game play? I mean Beth does offer a large means of acquiring atoms for free. I never buy atoms but I still have quite a few things including the scavenger bot which by the way, doesn‚Äôt give me anything beneficial but constantly supply‚Äôs me with useless rubber and concrete! My friend has thousands of atoms from doing challenges.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm a stubborn old bastard. I‚Äôll throw my ammo in the river before I pay them to let me scrap it. But I get your point.
---
The cosmetic-only promise was broken on multiple occasions and nobody can forget the canvas bag situation. My post isn't *telling* people to do anything, it's asking people why there's such a weak response to Bethesda's full commitment to finally officially breaking their promise...
---
What does the backpack do? I'm on this quest right now
---
Bro, two deathclaw gauntlets with bloodied swing speed
---
Remember just buying plans hoping you didn't already know them? Or the only real "player vendor" the bot in the whitespring closest to the workbenches? Or not being able to get the handmade plan past Lvl 15?
---
Damn.  Glad I‚Äôve missed that one
---
Ha I think you're right. These issues we're facing currently just highlight an underlying problem caused by the servers not being grouped by player level. Level grouping would solve these issues and it'd be easy to implement.
---
Saving this comment so I can go get the small backpack later, thank you friend.
---
Yes I know that struggle. I saved up a thousand scrip to spend and now I‚Äôm so overweight it‚Äôs crazy. And on top of it they were all pretty much trash!!!
---
???
---
I'm holding on to the legendary shovel Mumbles gave me when I dumped my 1,000 scrip for the sale and adding it to the weapons I keep in my STASH for doing dailies. I named it GRRRRRAFTON'S SHOVEL.
---
It was only today that I learned they re-recorded the Mayor's voice lines so they're less loud and irritating, though. Now it's like "You're listening to WGRF, the Quiet Mayoral Storm."
---
I was talking to a friend about this. He was going on and on about Beyhesda this and Bethesda that. So I told him to remember that Bethesda is the entity that developed the vaults and on top of that the experiments that were lived out in those vaults. I think, at times, that Bethesda is doing this to the players of FO76. There are multiple ones as well. What will people do if to get a badge they have to scrap Deathclaw hides and we change up the drop rate and locations? As a psychologist I can see that a lot of the things that players complain about are not all bugs, not specifically about money made in the atom shop, and not about actually screwing people over. Bethesda is not stupid. When you look at all of the math and statistics involved there is a lot going on. Stagger for defeating sentinel armor, cryo to offset cavalier, dense against explosives..: I think there may be some legitimacy to the fact that Bethesda may be messing with your heads and watching to see what you will do then change the game accordingly.
---
LMAO well, if you ever wanna throw away .45 or 10mm lemme know I'll go down river and pick it up lol. I do 100% get your point though and completely agree but I might as well get things I'd want to pay for.
---
I'm a lot more worried that other people won't like it.
---
Good point
---
Whoa there cowboy....I‚Äôll freely admit that Assaultrons make me feel dirty, but I‚Äôm not comfortable with that level of commitment.
---
Lol whatever man, I don't even play this game anymore, and you deleted your shit.
---
Glad I could help you sound less pretentious in the future so you can post without needing to delete your comments.
---
Vendor Bots for camps instead of the vendor termonals.
---
They're more valuable as scrip for me.  Even the God rolls. I will never play by a bloody build.
---
 I don't have any use for caps at all so selling it wouldn't do much for me.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ protection on a budget
---
I'd fucking love that! Especially if you could get different robots. I will have sentry bots selling teddy bears and nothing else
---
Honestly, fuck Bethesda. If I wasn‚Äôt such a big fallout fan and had something else to play I‚Äôd have dropped this game ages ago. They‚Äôve spit in their customers faces over and over again
---
id love that.. i forget half the time to put on super duper ect.
---
I put on my enclave suit and hat, did uranium fever and powering up poseidon and they both worked.
---
I dont mean like not like because of the bugs or anything.
---
I mean just not enjoy the content as much.
---
Also, those perk cards are only for Nuclear Winter, not adventure mode.
---
Sorry Starship Troopers reference.  That kind of day
---
As much as I would love this... Beth doesn't like admitting that New Vegas exists when they can avoid it. Just look at any interview with Todd Howard where it's brought up. So it's not likely.
---
&gt; I don't play this game anymore
---
What is it you're doing right now then? Nothing wrong with what I said at all, but I'd rather not deal with nitpicking lowlives trying to score cheap Internet points.
---
This game is a stupid cash grab. Really disappointed in it. So done
---
If you're on xbox, I've got several things I would trade you for your bloody drops.
---
Happened to me during Encryptid too. I glitched out of the event and wasn‚Äôt rewarded the ONLY time I successfully completed the event. It seriously was like 1,000 feet though.
---
yeah but that was a reply to a tweet before the game came out so not what we would call common knowledge there.
---
but yeah i am expecting this to be just be a private instance of amazon's cloud servers myself.
---
The canvas bag situation that they rectified? If you are still upset about that I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. They gave everyone a new bag. 
---
Their commitment was not to have p2w... not give anyone an advantage who buys atoms. That hasn‚Äôt changed. We already know the shop has provided some ‚Äúutility items‚Äù. This isn‚Äôt news. Acting like people should be outraged over something now when nothing has changed is some top level trolling.
---
This. Everyone saw "mods" and convinced themselves that it would be included with private servers. They've also convinced themselves that private servers will gove them full, or atleast extensive control of game settings. It most likely will just be a server where you can control who enters it. That's probably going to be the only change.
---
The same way they funded every expansion pack ever - with money from the sales of the original game. They funded, developed and released Automatron with money from the sales of Fallout 4 *then* banked additional money from that. Instead of all this crap, they could have just charged an additional $10 for Nuclear Winter. It's on their heads if *they* want to release a game that *requires* you to be online and that they claimed would be 'supported forever' then run out of money to sustain that plan less than one year down the line. If they're having trouble with server costs they could add an offline/LAN mode and/or charge people for the online elements such as Nuclear Winter. Borderlands 2 and Borderlands 3 manage it just fine.
---
Also, they will probably charge a mo they fee for private servers, and mods will likely be curated and sold by Bethesda, to ensure "fairness and stability" or some nonsense.
---
It's still simple to get a small version of the normal one. There is a building plan in the overseer box at morgantown airport.
---
No way to reset them yet. What you can do is post asking for someone one ps4 to help level you up a bit. You can offer caps but someone will probably offer for free. Just explain your situation like you did here. I‚Äôm on Xbox tho or I would help.
---
The only thing i have ever spent ATOMS on is the Ultracite Power Armour Paint job.
---
Not sure what the fascination is with all the other stuff.
---
I put it down to the age of Gamers.
---
Younger Gamers seem to love all that kind of stuff.I know this from people in my family.
---
I hear so many complain about it.
---
Yet no one is being forced to purchase ATOMS to buy all the cosmetic stuff.
---
Bethesda is only doing what all the big game manufacturers are now doing.Tapping in to what appears to be an extremely lucrative market.
---
Give them a break.
---
I've heard rumors that they have 10 developers working on the game. I'm inclined to believe that based on how much problems they're having, but I'd be glad to be proven wrong.
---
Did you played the arktos pharma raid and get it as loot?
---
Why would they give out the base coding for their game to people so that they can exploit it more in non private servers? Duper‚Äôs are bad enough, but giving them full run of the code...nope.
---
Prediction:
---
Next week the trending topics will be OMG I LUVZ THE HALOWEEN EVENT, WAI CANT I HAVE MORE CAMP BUDGET??!!?? and MY LIFE IS OVER BCUZ THERE IS NO ENCLAVE THEAMED JACK LANTERNZ!!!!
---
If the servers are fully customizable, then they probably wouldn't allow people to transfer characters back and forth. If they aren't l, then maybe. I'm leaning towards a very controlled experienced, essentially just limiting who can access your server.
---
I just almost never use melee. I'm on satellite so the lag means I have to hit sometime with melee way too many times to make it worth my while. 
---
Plus all those robots.
---
~~workbench~~ workshop
---
FTFY
---
The canvas bag situation that they openly lied about and almost got their asses sued for?
---
It doesn't matter if it was rectified, it was a direct, deliberate lie to everyone, but you act like they did nothing wrong if they fix it 6 months later...
---
Supposedly, mod support will be paramount and their number one priority for private servers. As for hosting ourselves, not sure about that. Hoping so, though. They haven't said anything. They'll probably make us pay to own our own servers.
---
F76 is not only about handmades and flux has more uses than just ultracite ammo. 
---
I've traded top tier weapon for caps + 100 violet fluxes, as the grind for them is pretty... well, grindy.
---
I feel like they should have been more transparent when they first talked about private servers, when they first said they  would bring private worlds and that we would also be able to mod them, they never hinted at the possibility that they would be paid for, practically 90% of the online games I play let you host your own game for free, with this it felt like they waited till the last second to tell us that we would have to pay for them, I'm sure a lot of people expected when we would get private worlds we would not have to pay for them, I mean they said micro transactions would pay for future content and looking at this its pretty obvious that this is or was future content but I guess they don't want to give the extra mile to people would prefer solo and don't want to deal with other Players other than a few friends. In a way this is a roundabout way to make us pay for mods, making it so if you want the modding experience you have to pay a fee to host a server.
---
Sounds like the game is losing the save state on fast travel. Try doing something before traveling that forces a save state, like dropping something from your inventory and then picking it back up.
---
You can still feel bad lol
---
When did they openly lie about it?
---
I've said this before, but if they are stuggling with a continued income/revenue stream...
---
...if people can trust you to deliver an immersive, meaningful, relatively bug-free, stable product without serious glitches and server issues and enough decent content to sustain their interest then there's a good chance they would trust you to spend more money on it. Like that Fortnite game for example.
---
Business school 101, you're welcome.
---
I'm pissing you off.
---
They got added. You can get a ez one from the airport. Ir work your ass off for the pioneer scout one. Though atomic shop backpacks only work if you unlock the PS one.
---
Aww baby /u/HotRodHunter ... Want PMs so his fwiends on de intwanet don't see him getting called out!
---
At least when I'm being a dickhead I'm aware of it.
---
Increased carry weight mostly
---
Preach it /
---
Anything but "settlers" and "raiders"... seriously, they couldn't have announced more uninteresting factions if they tried.
---
"Boy, the food at this place is really terrible,"says one  the another agrees:" Yeah, I know; and such small portions."
---
Don't think there gunna listen I really hope they do but there are a business and there just trying to make as much money as they can
---
By claiming the bag was made from canvas in all promotional images and materials when it was actually made from a cheap nylon plastic when people received it with the collectors edition. It was false advertising and so multiple people threatened lawsuits against Bethesda for lying about it and never admitting the change.
---
Awesome
---
Maybe 1 star tops. Power creep is real.
---
Good luck with that. GAMERS RISE UP!?!?
---
Saddest moment i had was surrounding a Quest that  finished at the Water Dam.
---
A young Boy that had been abducted writing letters.
---
Was very sad.
---
I enjoy reading all the letters on my journey thought the Wastelands.
---
Bethesda excels at this stuff.
---
I'm on xbox
---
Radiculous? üòÇ
---
Who gives a fuck what bethesda wants. 
---
Yeah I said it!
---
Wait, is it normal for friends on the internet to stalk eachothers reddit accounts (or even share them) now?
---
All I did was call you out on being a prick for no good reason. If that makes me a dickhead, sure I'll accept the label.
---
You do know that the person who wrote that response was a temp contractor and immediately Bethesda put out a statement that they were incorrect right?
---
Yeah, that's the big one. You know a bigger one? The small one is tiny.
---
It's because they make money. People turn their nose at a $100 game purchase, but don't bat an eye at 20 individual $10 purchases over the course of a few days. Until we as consumers reign in our spending habits, they will continue to do what makes them the most money.
---
Also, Bethesda had a large investor a couple years ago that invested several hundred million dollars in their company, and are being heavily influenced by them to increase profit margins. That was the beginning of this trend we see.
---
death is just the beginning lol. I simply die a lot from ghoul rads and that gained me all the mutations at low level including very useful ones such as marsupial and healing factor. When I level up at WS I don‚Äôt even try to stay alive, just keep hp low, have bunch of mutations, and roll with a couple of low level bloodied weapons. I also found a level 15 JE handmade so I ate a bunch of meds and alcohols I found in WS to get me addicted. It‚Äôs kind of hilarious but there are many ways to play it when death doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
I'm sorry dude but this thread started by me calling you out.
---
Where do you get the Dense Mod?  I'm @#$# tired of getting one shortted by explosive laser bs.
---
That would be great. Other than the grenades and launching nukes the enclave comes with no perks. Same with the brotherhood. You can make Ultracite armor and access the third flooreven though you can clip through the laser grids
---
Hmm, I'm gonna have to go look at it.
---
Idk what system ur on but on xb1 witch im on all servers have atleast 15+ players on at any given time.
---
They are cherrypicking.
---
They only made the correction *after* the bags had been delivered, meaning they knew the bags weren't actually made from canvas, but still never corrected the statements in the meantime before shipping. So you're saying that nobody at Bethesda saw how the bags were clearly *not* canvas until the days after they shipped them? Bull.Shit.
---
&gt; even though you can clip through the laser grids
---
That must be how the ghouls do it, because either you have to have extensive scannable credentials to get there, or you can just lunge at whoever is already in there.
---
I played from right after launch until about 2 or 3 months ago. For me, the game just has too many issues, and not enough end game. It's just kill, loot, scrap, repeat. No real "dungeons" or "raids", all of the good cosmetics are locked behind a paywall. There's no in game mail system, no reliablr way to transfer equipment to your alts short of using another person, only one build really puts out the top damage. It needs a lot if work still, in my humble opinion.
---
I wasn't being a bad person or disrespectful to anyone. That's all on you. If you get offended at shit that isn't hurting anyone and use that to try and insult someone to buff your internet karma from trolls, that doesn't give you the moral high ground, much the opposite.
---
You‚Äôd be better off getting the Small Backpack from the Airport for now. The quest is indeed very long and even longer if you want the mod to make the backpack carry even more
---
I rolled 3000 scrip on Thursday. Listing every item I got is ridiculous. I got a bunch of crap, but at least a dozen really nice guns.
---
RNG is a numbers game. I wanted a Fixer, and I got two so far.
---
I would drop 1,000 of the atoms I have earned on that this instant.
---
It doesn't bother me personally.
---
Because most people wanted "private servers" to be a solo or invite-only experience to be hosted on their own computer, not playing on the same garbage servers bethesda has but alone. They wanted to be able to import their character and then just continue doing whatever they want, with or without mods. That has absolutely no maintenance costs associated with it
---
Do u have alot of extra perk points to spend?if yes totally try and see if bloodied is fun for u.i did it when i got an B FFR Handmade from murtagh and was stunned about the damage u do lol.
---
please. I'm level 103 and have never used a repair kit. my armour does just fine because there are perks for that. you just have to decide what is most important for you. i hate having to repair my stuff frequently, so i use some points to make sure i rarely, if ever, have to. if you've decided something else takes precedence, that's on you. 
---
it's not a conspiracy, it's about choice and not being able to have out all in the apocalypse. that's the entire point of the game, stuff sucks, it's scarce, we're rebuilding from nothing. it would make no sense, lore wise, to have everyone straight out the vault be able to have everything they want armor and gun and perk wise. no other fallout game had ever allowed that, why would anyone expect this to be different?
---
read the second half of that post?
---
No. That is not what I am saying. I am saying your statement about them putting out a ‚Äúlie‚Äù that the bags pictured in the media were prototypes is wrong. 
---
Their official statement was that there was materials weren‚Äôt available at their manufacturer and the carrying case was replaced with nylon. 
---
And then they compensated people with both atoms and a new canvas bag later. 
---
Could they have handled better? Maybe. But you are saying they lied which is incorrect.
---
if you are not a bloodied character i would use it to trade for multiple items that you want do you run any particular build?
---
also a fixprice is always hard and you have a weapon thats definitely top tier
---
if you would sell it for caps you could easily get 50k caps
---
but as you are asking this question i highly doubt that you are someone who uses mules for trading so id definitely suggest to trade it for maybe two or three weapons, maybe armor pieces
---
\*Applauses\*
---
it's still choice. players have to choose what's important for them, they shouldn't then bitch about the choice they made. if they decided spending money on repair kits was more important than grinding for atoms or even increasing perk points to make things need repairing rarely, they should own it. if they'd rather spend atoms - bought or earned- on cosmetics than utility items, then own it, stop crying they can't have everything.
---
I thought about trying to go bloodied just to try it out, might consider it with this weapon, just to see how much damage I could do compared to my current sneak build
---
Well it is a lie, they had more than enough time to correct the statement, but never did, despite having full knowledge that the bags *weren't* canvas.
---
Was this on Xbox? I believe I was apart of that.
---
Honestly it depends. If it is like 20 ammo per hour... no. That is essentially a waste of atoms and essentially non functional. If it also les guests at your camp use the machine, then this also would not be a big deal. 
---
I don‚Äôt know the exact production rate that would bother me. A lot also comes down to price. If it is less than 400 atoms, that seems easy enough to earn in game... so I would be fine with it.
---
Bethesda should work in it's game.
---
Just let me GET a backpack without having to break my back trying to get the thing. Its ridiculous that I cant even USE it without sinking 20 hours into it.
---
I would
---
If so, they should be put with different bonuses. Remember Tessa's Fist back in Fallout 4? It has 200% more durability as a legenrady bonus. Something like that would be good to make regular pieces of armor competitive. More utility than combat usefulness.
---
Also it would be great to see full suit Armor, like Cage Armor.
---
The statement about the prototype wasn‚Äôt made by them... and that statement was corrected immediately...
---
thank you anyway
---
I agree, I could use double the existing favorite spots without even putting gear on there...
---
Brilliant.
---
Surprise mechanics*
---
How do so many people keep getting 30k caps? I can‚Äôt even manage to get/keep 2k
---
50k caps? Is that actually a normal price for something like this lmao. 
---
Im currently a sneak build,  been trying for a legendary fixer, so this gun if useless for me. 
---
If it does sell for that high usually, I could probably sell for lower and get rid of the weight fast
---
imagine still playing this game
---
The statement was corrected *after* people complained about the false advertising. Even if the statement about the bags being canvas was made by an outside firm, didn't nobody at Bethesda bother to even check what they wrote?
---
If only the private serves were free
---
I don't **hope** anymore.
---
Taking and defending gorge junk yard won't count. Sux cause workshop taking and defending usually wraps up these complete events while X really quickly. Bot stop didn't work, corroboration for Enclave events. Always vigilant worked.
---
Ironic that your flair is the Responders
---
It would be nice but honestly I never expected that, even Minecraft makes you pay ~$12/month (Canadian) for a server with max limit of 10 players
---
Go and get the small backpack plans from Morgantown Airport. Easy peasy.
---
Wait, I DONT need to do the scouts stuff for it!?
---
It's a converter, not an extractor. Tbh I'm expecting it to immediately take some, then give less
---
And they look really ESOesque.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs what I thought too. I was surprised to have rads in PA and thought maybe the higher level PA would completely protect. But I guess the nuke fallout is pretty fresh right after it drops.  Quite a bit higher than FO4.
---
Yeah. The only thing is if mods are ever added, it will mean you have to pay to use them. Which sucks.
---
We didn‚Äôt deserve to be fucked over, when the 80$ edition went to 40 dollars a week later
---
Fridge at least
---
One sold several months back for 80k and it had +1 Perception so the faster reload is better.
---
The main issue that could have saved a lot of anger is the fact that many believe Bethesda provided a partially finished game for full price and now instead of providing more to level out the price Bethesda is nickle and diming the community. 
---
Some thing would be expected to cost, like private servers, but allowing the community to host their own games was one thing they wanted. This won't be possible with a player base economy unless you don't take equipment between servers.
---
The only way people will be happy is if all they ask for is provided exactly how they demand it. That isn't possible either, compromising some for most is the way it should work.
---
The biggest upset from the announcement was that they heard the community and are making more items that would be seen as pay to win like the kits. 
---
Miss the point, yes, but on most of the request. Bethesda needs to go back to the requests and reread them to make sense of what was asked for before blindly going into what they heard verse what was said.
---
That‚Äôs not how response centers work lol. You can‚Äôt have someone double checking every single response that goes out. You are essentially paying two people to do the job of one at that point. You would sample some for QA purposes and unfortunately this one went through the cracks. When they became aware, the responded.. as any company should do. 
---
Anyway it‚Äôs clear you just like being angry and are curious why others aren‚Äôt as angry as you. Maybe people just like playing the game rather than getting upset over nothing?
---
If they actually put something in the game I disagree with I will speak up. Getting mad at them now because they put a statement out about their principles that guide atom shop decisions is a bit absurd. Especially when you said yourself the statement is ok lol. 
---
Anyway have a nice day.
---
"who would throw away this perfectly good used toilet paper?"
---
Wait, what? Gotta try tonight. Thank you sir.
---
they can't add the things that make fall out games good like world changing decisions. they won't be adding more meaningful dungeons or raids. i dont think that they can make 76 into what they want or what we want. I am also concerned.
---
I know that. I am saying if you can‚Äôt share it, the conversion rate should be slow.
---
Despite deep sorrow of this moment, i still think Bethesda shouldn't put Super-Mutants to Appalachia. You see, Master did not created his Army before 2161. I know it's only Black Isle canonical moment, but Scorched is good enough to be a threat here. It would feel great to have just a few non-hostile Super-Mutants, like Grahm, and put their lore back to pre-War time, for them being "first experiments" or something similar. Washington was important enough to have BoS, Enclave, groups of raiders, SM, et cetera, but West Virginia is just mother nature, it is not so important in warfare tactic. I think it should look more like Far Harbor, but huge enough.
---
Wait, the scrip cooldown isn't on the server cooldown? So you have to wait 20 hours for it to refill no matter what?
---
This game actively doesn't want people to play it and that's a very strange choice
---
PS4.   There aren't many things left in Appalachia that I need though.
---
I‚Äôd love to be able to break down ammo and make special ammo like NV. I don‚Äôt recall if that continued afterwards. 
---
Like NV, but not the same as NV. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it was a good idea.
---
I think they should work on fixing the public servers before they put all this time and effort into private ones, every time I play this game I get kicked from the session at least twice. It's worse than gta v for God's sake.
---
Raid rewards reset at the same time daily quests do, at 8 PM EST
---
Not that one but that one is only a tiny buff and isn't compatible with the upgrades or skins.
---
I  have kept 2 of  the 3 Bloodied drops i have had in 700 hours of gaming..
---
Bloodied 50 Cal Sniper Rifle(converted from 308).Bloodied Power Fist.And a Bloodied Mini-gun that i got rid of for an AAE Gatlng for SBQ fights.The Sniper Rifle One Shots everything other than SBQ/ Low level Scorched Beasts and the Ammo Sponge Legendery Sheepsquatch.
---
AAE Gatling is more practical for SBQ fights does nearly 200 + damage per shot with Perks/Chems using the same Amo of the Minigun.
---
I also keep 90% reduced weight Weapons because i dont waste my Perk Cards on Carry weight.I only use them carrying loot from SBQ fights :-)
---
Low lvls ruin high level players experiance aswell. We hate it when low lvls enter high lvl areas witch drasticaly lowers the lvls of the enemies in the area.
---
I believe you are not wrong.
---
Nothing like a bag full of ribeyes
---
Not for the small one. Mind you, the small one carries less and you can't put skins on it, but still.
---
That would kill a good part of the vending machines. What's the point of travelling to another camp if you know ammo isn't a problem? Just gather some .38 and convert to your favourite, because it's basically free and that's it. And ammo selling is a big, big part of a camp vending machine
---
Still never got the backpack
---
556
---
Wow, ok so if I decide to sell, I could sell at my camp for the max 25k caps and it wouldn't be unrealistic.
---
Atoms should not affect perks. Jeeze.
---
Okay?
---
No problem! üòä
---
Hmm helping the community as best i can plus i got bored üòÜ
---
Oh boy a low effort circlejerk post no doubt aimed solely at getting upvotes. Fun.
---
Thank you for this post, Its amazing to me how I actually ended up caring for my tamed pets each time, and every time they always end up dead...  I guess it's kinda like real life... I've loved and lost many pets in real life too
---
I find it very interesting the scatological attachment we can make to virtual objects, and even real life inanimate objects if they are personified or represented by significant facsimiles of things we can about in real life (i.e. pets)
---
I 100% agree the taming /friend system could use a bit of an upgrade, Its tough out here in the wasteland, and a little companionship goes a long way
---
I think once a pet is tamed and back at our bases, they should be invulnerable to damage, or at  the very least let us resurrect them like we can with out cows
---
and since are discussing the matter, if we are examining the whole process of taming creatures/animals, I also would like to suggest once we initally tame a creature, please streamline the process of them returning to our CAMPS, maybe teleport them right away with an on screen message saying "Your pet has returned to your CAMP"
---
Because it seems they can die easily or get lost on the way back to your CAMP they way it is now.
---
Im sorry for your loss!
---
YES!!!  Fortnite made over 2 billion last year on just skins and dances
---
Done. I got a couple of really nice rolls. Got a god roll uny powered sent combat armor piece, several good weightless pieces, Aae rw 10mm smg, qffr 25 Broadsider, and a bunch of other garbage, but I did get a few nice pieces
---
It's more about paying for the server hosting, you're not really paying for the mods. :)
---
The other option is to do it like Ark. You can set up a server but all the players have to be within a certain distance of the owner. The other option is to have a second console to purely run the server, which can't be played on while hosting the server.
---
Both options would be nice, but I'd rather pay $10/$15/month than pay for a second console. (Or PC)
---
Only possible to be true? You know fuck well it WILL be true.
---
As mentioned, trade that sweet ma duece, I bet some bloody build out there is looking a 2 or 3* fixer saying, wonder what I could get for this?
---
*Hands you chopsticks*
---
So you had a dog you could never see, and a camp you could never use?
---
Taming in this game is horrible. Everything I've ever tamed either died or disappeared. I just got lonely again the other night, and tamed a Radstag. It never even made it to my CAMP.
---
This started with DLC, and anyone that thinks otherwise is living under a rock.
---
Not sure what it looks like as I can't find an image of it, but maybe bloodied chef outfit?
---
If you aren‚Äôt going to do a bloodied build try trading it for something you will use
---
I assume so. They're not p2p servers so they be buried with hardware cost if everyone wanted to run solo on a server. The public servers spread cost over 24 users.
---
It doesn't.  Except that
---
1. Bethesda has taken stuff that was free in fallout 4 or 5 dollars for dozens of items and sold it to you at 7-20 dollars PER item.  That effects your enjoyment even if its 1% it's still less than fallout 4 have you.  
---
2. Bethesda has stripped in game fun for thr atom shop.  Every MMOs end game has a very very large portion of it being grinding for cosmetics and housing crap.  It's one of the main draws, fallout 76 trades that for the atom shop..and the end game is one of the largest issues with the game so that effects many many peoples enjoyment by a large portion
---
3. The more you defend it the more you encourage purchases the more Bethesda will do this stuff and add in actual pay to win later because your telling them with your spending habits that you want more atom shop items and less in game items.
---
I got fucked over and bought this game at launch for 80 bucks and a month later, some atom shop purchases were more expensive than the game+tricentennial edition, and then the game breaking bugs and duping, 
---
Moral of the story: NEVER pre order a game
---
I wonder even how it will work. Isn't shotgun ammo the only ammo that needs plastic? That is the pain to find plastic.
---
I agree but I just take purified water with me. I don't worry about food because super mutants from New Gad and Summerville are a great source of protein. I mean is it really that bad if I'm mutated to hell and back.
---
First off calm down there sparky I hear you loud and clear, I get it. I don‚Äôt even play on patch day in fear of all the bugs and game breaking bugs. This update won‚Äôt be any different.
---
believe it or not its actually far from uncommon that weapons are sold for way more than 25k :D
---
"Vehement outcry"?  Tell that to the Atomic Shop sales numbers.  The highest selling items are these "utility" items.  I'm not a big fan of them myself, but I'm not going to sit here and expect BGS to listen to a vocal minority when sales numbers speak much louder than words.
---
So I play as an NPC bartender.  If you made the fridge a quest item there is a 100% probability I wouldn‚Äôt have it.  The same for the bar items or the stoves or any of it really.  
---
Point is: Not everyone who plays this game plays the same way.
---
Act if u fallowed the main quest u would of started with the responders then moved over to the ash heap to do the fire dept. Then abbies bunker, then roses quests, then enclave.then finished off by doing Brotherhood of steel. Plus at low lvl how did you think you would make it thru cramberry bog and the final quest fighting Scorch Beasts at such a low level.
---
Enclave events dont count for some reason, but all other events Should work to my knowledge
---
There's one of you in every thread lol.
---
I think a lot of people just haven't thought it through that far.  76 is different than minecraft or a lot of other games that primarily exist *only* on private or rented servers.  There are exceptions of course, but it seems to be a common misunderstanding.
---
Idk, wasn't me.
---
wardenclyffe1901
---
Unfortunately from post I've seen from time to time is people say they will literally pay money for these types of things so you know Bethesda takes them up on it
---
Dual wield melee with a car door or combat armor for a shield!
---
There's a smaller one you can get in one of the airports without doing a quest too.
---
I got it when I did the quest, but haven‚Äôt gotten it if I just show up to the event.
---
I lost a stunted Yao Guai named Teddy, and also a gorgeous Deathclaw who looked so perfect pacing across my CAMP‚Äôs front lawn. I really liked having a pet at my CAMP but they‚Äôre impossible to keep alive. I think attacks on CAMP‚Äôs should only occur when the user is at the CAMP.
---
But you only paid 60 bucks for it. The entitlement on this one. Expecting to be able to enjoy more than the tutorial area while innocent, hard-working Bethesda CEOs are starving in the back of a limousine. Kids these days!!!
---
Yeah. But if the camp has 3k 10mm (something I never use and never sells) and a converter. I‚Äôd buy that 3k 10mm if I could trade it in for 1.5k 5.56. It would actually make ammo have value outside of the few that do sell (shotgun shells, 5.56 etc)
---
I do this as well after losing 3 Megasloths. Though I log off at a location near my camp and then just walk to it when I log back in... Haven't lost this one so far! ü§û
---
Trading for something I'd want is definitely something I'd consider, just have to try not to get scammed
---
When I checked myself a couple months ago it was AWS for the Midwest US. Fully expect they shop around, however.
---
Don‚Äôt say that, you‚Äôll give Bethesda an idea
---
There‚Äôs a bloodied chef uniform?
---
Plenty of people don't buy ammo.  Must vendors I see have very limited or 0 ammo for sale.
---
I've *just* started buying 5.56 recently, as a cap sink, but I've gone &gt;250 levels just farming my own.
---
It would certainly have an effect, but keep in mind that you can also convert ammo to sell, once everyone's glut of useless ammo has been depleted.
---
I wouldn't do that. What platform are you on?
---
Thats true, I basically have to hope I join a server and someone on it goes to my base and then hope they they have 25k caps. Might take a while
---
Modern gaming in a shellnut
---
Good idea. I would love some fresh human meat.
---
Nope, but she thinks I love shotguns for some reason. I don‚Äôt.
---
I'll be on the lookout for stuff I'd trade for, for sure
---
Bloodied chef outfit and hat. Both were drops from the meat week event
---
Aww dang it, so I can‚Äôt get it anymore?
---
This is a ridiculous mechanic. There should be random enemies, sure, but every time someone comes to your camp? Dumb.
---
Also, I wish we could go into the editor and remove corpses. I keep a clean home and can't abide mole rat bodies laying about.
---
I like how you think ‚Äúbunny hoping‚Äù is something originated from fortnite....
---
I'm sure you can find it in people's vending machines
---
Well thanks for the help! :)
---
They could probably learn a thing from RDO, ive gotten about $50 worth of gold bars through gameplay in 11 days of playtime, not to mention the $50 worth of gold bars they to use for free just because they could. I havent spent a dime on RDO but ive earned about $100 in gold bars free. Just ignore the fact that we can use that gold for anything at the right rank.
---
Dog food is key!
---
Wasn't meant as a direct attack to you, moreso my frustration with Bethesda's money grab from the atom shop. I paid my dues, bought the game at $20 off, bought a total of $20 of atoms and have used the in game acquired ones since. I hate how they went against their word that it would be cosmetic only.
---
I'm on PC, I'll have to check out some trading subs and see what's available then
---
I for one am very pleased they cost money.
---
 It would make absolutely no sense if they were free. Every single person that plays this game would have their own servers if they were free.
---
 I honestly hope they cost enough to deter people from using it as their own personal solo server.
---
 I also hope characters get locked to whatever servers they join. Especially when mods come out.
---
In terms it's one opinion that's heavily agreed on to me. You paid for the base game and it's yours to play but they dont owe you addition stuff for your characters they'll put stuff upcoming we have alot of dlcs to come but they dont need to cater to you wanting more not everyone agreed with your new utility items so.
---
See my [Where to Farm: All the Things](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c9njxj/where_to_farm_all_the_things/) guide.
---
If you can't find it, I have an extra one if you're on PS4
---
there are perks that give you better versions of those same advantages. luck of the draw, gunsmith and weapon artisan means my gun needs to be repaired maybe once a week, real time, no matter how many sbq fights I'm in. fix it good and lucky break do the same for armor.  the atom shop is not necessary. it's a choice. make a different choice then.
---
Hey, it might not just be their servers. You‚Äôre gonna want a stable internet connection, and not to plug in other things in the router
---
I'm sorry.  That really sucks.  :(
---
Oh man you‚Äôre too generous but unfortunately I‚Äôm on xbox.
---
Thanks anyway! :)
---
Your mom is a pos
---
They need to give us skins for weapons that people actually use
---
A quality bloodied rifle, machine gun or gauntlet is worth hanging on to for 20w, no question. You can get basically anything you want for trade with a B/E, B/SS or B/FFR.
---
Get good
---
No, but I would like to think a Fallout BR would be a little more realistic rather than jumping 20 feet with a grenade launcher.
---
....he‚Äôs not trolling at all.
---
RadAWAY, RunAWAY, do you get it!?
---
*Okay,I'm done*
---
Trade forums exist.
---
And you have every right to be, as you said theAtom shop is turning out better then the base game at this point,  and I‚Äôm not sure what ‚Äúother‚Äù utilities that have planned but they claim they won‚Äôt break the game balance....well they have lied out of there  ass before......
---
Dude my ps4 is directly plugged into the router and the only thing plugged into it. And I don't have this problem with any other game, plus I know it's their servers cause when Ive played with friends before the server crashed for us all at the same time.
---
No worries I'm sure you'll find it easy enough. Don't pay too much for it though as they were an pretty common drop and people tend to over-price these... And glad I could help :)
---
This is true. High health options like junkie, anti armor and instigating have always remained desirable.
---
Ah. Okay. It‚Äôs crashed a lot more when I was using a shitty internet connection. The servers are shit, but I think they‚Äôre focusing on wastelanders atm
---
And everyone seems to think of I paid for the game means they owe you for some odd reason this responsibility to add more, I didnt beat god of war contact the creators and say hey I beat your game been playing I need some different weapons something new, I cant imagine why you do it here
---
plastic is very easy to get. even in quantities.   
---
and plasma cells need plastic as well.
---
They wouldn't, some people just like to put the "X Atoms" on every suggestion that gets made.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4, then it‚Äôs by adding me (AtticusRink) and letting me help you by giving you some to get started.
---
probably because you would then be able to mod characters and dupe/create items thanks to the offline/local character storage it would require.
---
If you‚Äôre on pc I have them all and will mod for free. I‚Äôm at 50ish karma.
---
I think alot of venders are on some really good drugs... atleast on xb1. Went to a few venders earlyer. The high lvls were selling at the correct prices. But went to a camp near whitesprings train station and a lvl 30 was trying to sell 1* to 3* legendaries for between 10k to 30k caps per.
---
Not for me they don't. If it's not in game I won't bother with it.
---
The only way I could except Fallout 76 as an ok game is if they didn‚Äôt charge $60 for the base game and then make atomic shop cosmetics that were so expensive that buying 5 of the most expensive items, which suck, cost more than the actual game itself. Bethesda, please do me a big, big favor and make the ammo converter a base game feature and not something to buy off the atomic shop. And not to mention that it wouldn‚Äôt even hurt a bit to remove the 3rd zero from the cosmetic price tags. Tons of layers would be so much happier if they where cheaper and looked unique. The biggest thing that they need to sort out is content and atomic shop cosmetics. Their is literally a black billboard that has absolutely nothing on it yet is at least 500 atoms. The only thing that can go on it is the neon lights which you need to but to FOR 500 f@&amp;$ing atoms. Why not just make a damn bundle for the light up words and the billboard that‚Äôs worth 200?!? Just make all cosmetics only priced at 50 to 100 or at the very most 200 max for power armor or bundles since it‚Äôs so terribly priced. They also have to make better cosmetics because they are boring, dull, uninspired, lazy prices of work that honestly I could make better concepts for costumes for the game like the classic t-45 looking power armor costume from fallout 3 and New Vegas. This in my opinion is what they should do in between wastelanders and now and also to make free (with a big emphasis) dlc for the game. Is it that hard to hire some talented, creative, and skilled artists to make them?
---
If you didn't see this shit coming when they added consumables to the shop you're wearing some thick rosey glasses.
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre into hamstringing yourself. Fine by me.
---
Well I'm especially worried because they are talking about private servers. If the public servers are already being neglected now, how bad will it get when they only care about the servers people pay for. That's bethesda lately though, money money money.
---
Imagine playing fallout 76 every day of the week so you can afford a fence. My god what a waste of my free time
---
And/or add me if you're on PS4.
---
SineCera
---
I'll give you some of those, some recipes, etc.
---
Do some of the easier Events, like those in the Forest.  Successful completion almost always yields a bunch of meds.  Get a rank of Pharma Farma in Luck too, which will allow you to Search (it's an extra option, spacebar on PC) any medical container for a chance at more meds.
---
Dilute Stimpacks and Radaway at a Chemistry Workbench if you have extra Purified Water.
---
Some things can be substitutes.  Canned Dog Food, coupled with the Good Doggy perk, can restore almost as much as a diluted Stimpack.  Purified Water can relieve thirst and refill some HP as well.
---
Aside from the obvious development of the current map, most of the effort that went into fo76 was making it into a client/server multiplayer game. It could be argued that the same amount of effort would be required to take the game as it is now and convert it back into a single player game, even though that is where it originated in fo4. 
---
Somebody will no doubt chime in that they could just give us the server binary and let us host it locally. That would require some client changes to force the game to not contact the master server and to not synchronize character data. It would also give developers such as myself keys to examine the server binary looking for exploits that could be used in the public environment. I keep getting downvoted for saying this, but it does not make it any less true. I myself don't have the time or motivation to spend on such things, but there are plenty of people out there who do.
---
Can‚Äôt they just make mods incompatible with going back online? Assuming mods would have to be done offline. As for duping I could definitely see that happening, but was possible in Fallout 4, kind of ends up being a player choice whether you want to go that route. There‚Äôs no real PvP in the online version, and player camp budget would still have to be a thing, so doesn‚Äôt seem like duping would have that much of an impact past a single player‚Äôs experience.
---
Why would I be trolling?
---
 I will never use a bloody build so I have no use for bloody weapons.
---
 So scrip'n them is the best option for me.
---
Don't worry they going to look at all the data....
---
Omg mind blown
---
I attached a video to my post that shows everything so that it possibly gives all the information possible
---
I don't think they are, yet.
---
Hate to dissapoint, but... no.
---
That‚Äôs amazing!!
---
John wick: upvote
---
learn the location of some place with some med drops and visit it regularly.
---
i'm currently sitting on close to 700 stim packs and got no idea what to do with them. you can find them everywhere in the wasteland if you pay attention.
---
Wait, where did you find a dog? 
---
I've never been able to tame anything at all!
---
In all honesty, though, I don't even see how the collection/fridge/kits are breaking game balance. It's just annoying that they are not cosmetic. I'm sure they're going to get worse over time though.
---
I usually don't focus so much on acquiring more as they usually drop frequently. Instead focus on using them more conservatively and restore health using food, water, resting etc. Only use stimpaks when you're in a fight and are on the verge of dying or are crippled.
---
\- Alternative 3: Keep prices in the Atom Shop the same but increase the amount you get from purchasing Atoms to 2-3x its current amount. Stop putting utility items in the Atom store, put them in the base game for free then sell fantastic skins for them in the shop.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the fear.
---
I think I get what you‚Äôre saying. I appreciate your comment, this is all kind of past my level of knowledge. It sounds like more work than one might intuit to make it happen.
---
sad face
---
If you have the Forest Healing Salve learned make that for awhile. It works great for that level and you can save up your stimpacks for when you need them. Other then that there are some foods that give you a heath regen for a bit and restore health.  Other then that hit up around Flatwoods and look at all the med kits. Pick up the Luck card to find more chems and you will start to swim in them.
---
I have more God rolled weapons for my build than I know what to do with.  I also have a damn good set of armor that I use.
---
 Every single one of them either dropped for me or I bought off player vendors.
---
Granted I'm level 250 with over a 1000 hours played but still I've never needed a trading forum.
---
Yeah give us the backpack to use or find. Make em upgradable too
---
As already stated, do events. Many of them reward stims. 
---
Beyond that, be more selective about your stim use. If you need to heal in combat then by all means use a stim. If you are about to die and you are impossibly outnumbered by a large group of super mutants, just die and respawn, go back and pick them off one at a time even if you die a few more times.
---
Don't use a stim to heal yourself outside of combat. Use food, water, sleep. 
---
It's a tough grind then suddenly you hit a point where you are selling stimpacks daily because you constantly have 50+ in your inventory with no idea how they got there.
---
Events are great for stimpacks. For radaway I get most of mine from ghouls.
---
You can get a perk that lets you "search" chem boxes for extra chems, that's also a great way to find them early on.
---
Remember there was a bug. I don‚Äôt remember quite what it was.
---
Everyone is giving good advice, but I'd add that dying doesn't really have repercussions. Regularly scrap and stash your junk, and you wont lose anything or not much when you die. 
---
Making/using food and healing chems, and diluting your meds is the way to go. Once you get Super Duper that's really helpful for anything you craft, too.
---
I didnt say all the sale was junk.
---
I got the one out of Silo Bravo, I'll have to look up a list of the locations. I missed these 2 somewhere. Thanks.
---
I don't think they'd need to make it a single player game. Just make it so you can host it yourself.
---
All I can say to this is just that its not true.
---
PS4 but thanks. It‚Äôs all good, something to do while I wait for my scrip to daily reset!
---
Best comment I've seen so far.
---
Ya i hear ya the bouncing bullshit happens on ESO aswell. Too manny players wanna duel but when they start one they immidiatly start hopping arround like wtf. Same goes for cyrodill.
---
‚ÄúSale is rigged to drop utter garbage‚Äù
---
I echo my second paragraph and emphasize the can of worms that would open.
---
There is a very good reason no game with persistent online user state has released server binaries to the general public in the past.
---
I didn't buy it so i could store cooked molerat for another half hour. I did it so my kitchen would look more complete. Same reason id buy a half decent sink and bathroom stuff.
---
Thanks for the tip. I'll take a look at how I'm using them, probably using them to excessively tbh
---
We shouldn't have to work around a crappy design though
---
My guess is private servers will have much higher stash, much higher build limit, etc. We won‚Äôt know until next week.
---
It'll be back, only thing I haven't seen return is the mosaic tile floors.
---
Well guess some players are lucky than others.
---
I didn't say "release wastelanders". They delay all if the bug updates and so I'm suggesting they do something to make up for it. It's a suggestion, not an opinion.
---
At level 12 you should make as much healing salve as you can! Run up and down river in flatwoods collecting blood leaf, soot flower and water. 
---
It‚Äôs free and works just like a stimpack
---
How do you get the mr. pebbles backpack ?? I saw someone with it yesterday and I was delighted
---
I like how the reasonable request of "give us something to do in the mean time after a huge delay" gets people so salty.
---
Well, looks like it. I thought it was just me. [Video](https://youtu.be/f0agvH6n9xY)
---
I have a buddy that will run uranium fever and loot everything in there. He will slowing walk back to the whitesprings vendor and sell out for the day.
---
You're just describing anti hack security in other games. By not worrying about an offline version they cut down on possible reasons for even more bugs
---
You wouldn't be interested in an Instigating Explosive Gauss would you?
---
It's not a glitch on my end. Its how the respawns mechanic for events works.
---
What are you spending your caps on? In my experience leveling multiple toons, the best way to make caps as a low level is to do events, generally just play the game, and most importantly not spend caps. 
---
Don't fast travel if you don't have to. There really isn't anything for sale on the vendors that you need.
---
Is that an event or something? I don‚Äôt play a lot, so sorry if that‚Äôs a noob question.
---
Does it take a long time or something?
---
Why are you here if you aren‚Äôt playing then?
---
It's not only just carry weight. There are backpack mods! Armor plated!(adds +90 damage resist at carry weight cost+30). Lead lined!(adds +90 rad resist at carry weight cost+30). High capacity!(adds +120 to carry weight at cost of -60 rad resist and -60 energy resist). Refridgerated!(increases food life +30 carry weight). Hope this helps! Please correct me if I'm wrong!
---
Good idea.  
---
I haven't done any of the Questlines to get backpacks yet though, I still have to check those \[backpacks\] out.
---
Shit, thanks man.
---
Your player vendor is your best friend i made 20k im 35 mins in the xbox lfg posts selling scrip flux prime plans ultracite plans ammo etc
---
Well I‚Äôm level 36 but I played from BETA - December then stopped playing up until today when I decided to check the game out and apparently when I last played I had a ton of radiation, 8 caps, broken armor, and one flare gun.
---
The only thing I remember was buying a ton of plans for my camp, like I remember I had up to 500+ caps (idk if that‚Äôs a lot but it was for sure the peak of my career)
---
So yeah, I haven‚Äôt spent any caps at all lately except for fast travel fees for getting to quests across the map.
---
Thanks for the advice tho! :)
---
That would be shocking. I think the playerbase would utterly revolt if they did that.
---
And Bethesda would rake in $$. 
---
I don't know which one would be worse.
---
This game is like gambling except it‚Äôs done in such a way where you spend hours and hours getting garbage and when you get close to even getting something good, you feel like you want to smash your controller or play even more to get even more garbage.
---
That tweet was not that obscure actually, there was a [large thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/9asleu/pete_hines_confirms_that_fallout_76_private/) about it on /r/fallout, and it was also reported on various gaming news sites (search for the quote *"it's a server based game. I don't see us completely re-engineering it to somehow be an offline game that is entirely client based"*). Additionally, in an [E3 2018 interview](https://www.polygon.com/platform/amp/e3/2018/6/11/17451416/fallout-76-solo-games-private-mods), Todd Howard was referring to "private worlds" as a service, which to me - together with his statements at the conference that the game is entirely online and uses dedicated servers - already kind of implied that it will not be player hosted. I guess it comes down to a mix of people not paying as much attention, and wishful thinking (unwanted information is just ignored/downvoted, like my comments here).
---
I just did it to make you more aware of the tone of your post.
---
Fuck the karma, and your feelings.
---
Bet you'll think twice next time either way. Mission accomplished.
---
Playing with my buddy we invent stories and names for these things. Part Law and Order "well chief here's our best guess" piecing things together, part creating games within the game.
---
How do you get that stuff tho?
---
Doing the robot event in flatwoods gives alot of stimpacks and you can grab more from the first aid kits in the suround buildings.
---
You can counter vat by crouching or using Chameleon.
---
The only problem is that vat crits are to powerful, crits ignore all your damage mitigation effects and can drop any player in 1s.
---
I think they should just allow crit to do double damage and not ignore all your defensive cards and armor.
---
That will give players some room to run for cover to lose the vat lock.
---
Queen event
---
Is by whitesprings station.
---
I could definitely agree with the price change. But personally it would also be nice to get more atoms in game.
---
Thanks! Where is that?
---
I don't know the platform you play on, but in PC 99% of the vendors have 1k+ ammo on sale, and everytime i dump ammo on my vending machine shotgun shells, 556, 45, fusion and plasma cores don't last long, even .50 cal and 5mm with some patience 
---
It would have some effect, since you can find a couple hundred ammo clearing a enemy-infested place and looting the boxes there, so most people would be only interested in buying them in large quantities to save time
---
How do you even get the backpack?
---
I run maybe 4-5 queens a day stocking up the event rewards and legendary weapons she drops it takes a while but if you invest into your player vendor you'll be drowning in the caps.
---
Idk im on wifi connection with time warner on xb1 and i havent crashed or disconnected in weeks.
---
FYI, cutting power to your vending machine only takes it off the map. If someone comes across your camp, they can still purchase from an unpowered vending machine. Still recommend blocking or locking them away
---
You'll have to nuke it or join the event when somone does. If you are in xbox head to the 76 game club and look at the LFG posts and you will see it constantly appearing.
---
to be fair,it has already gotten much easier to earn atoms in game.... and they claim to be more consistent with that
---
Sell every weapon and armor piece you loot. You will miss out on building your junk stash by doing this, but it will help you get your cap balance up quicker. You likely aren't going to have more than a couple thousand caps until you get past level 50. After that it seems like they start flowing in, probably from all the stimpacks that materialize in your inventory that you have to keep selling.
---
I have loved the blaster since FO1 :)
---
With language like that, sounds like you're fucking your own feelings.
---
I don't need to think twice to know that no matter what I say or do, some troll with nothing better to do will try his luck. I didn't do anything wrong and I don't need to, unfortunately.
---
I'd be willing to forgive and apologise if you were but I'm guessing that's not in your nature.
---
You confuse me. First you say the community asked for these things then you say the community didn't invent these ideas? I'm pretty sure those two things are one in the same.
---
Nevertheless the community did invent it. A reddit user in the past suggested it and even said that he needed something to spend his atoms on (big mistake).
---
Bethesda then kept referencing it in update articles without any indication that it'd be a paid for item and before you know it poof. Paid utility fridge. While I am not a dev that has no true knowledge of any of this (how hard it took to make it, how it was implemented etc.) I really really would've preferred them not going back on their cosmetic only promise. Atom shop items are already overpriced as is.
---
The collectron station is cut content btw as well. It was referenced in a strategy guide prior to the items release and it was seen in promotional trailers.
---
Is there an outcast paint in the game?
---
Maybe someone at Bethesda changed it to see if anyone would notice. They could give you some reward for reporting it.
---
Thank you so much :)
---
No problem man happy to be of assistance
---
I got a Bloodied Explosive +1 Agl (I think?) Combat Rifle. I don't run a Bloodied build, so I'm not sure if that's amazing, or just "hey - someone could probably use that."
---
But everything else has been vendor crap.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Does it really get easier after level 50?
---
Play events, lots - most of them just take 5 minutes and reward you with decent stuff, when you can't find any active one, go kill a enemy infested place, then sell all the stuff to the vendor or put them into your vending machine, bad legendary weapons or armor at a fair price for people to scrip them would also help you a lot
---
Personaly id like the ammo converder to be a crafting table so even if only us (Whales) buy it. It would still allow anyone visiting to use it.
---
I've had surprising success with my vendor. Bulked junk, stimpacks, mentats (grape &amp; orange mostly), bobbleheads, magazines, 5.56, fusion cores (1 cap per charge, so if it's at 57/100 57 caps, 85/100 85 caps).
---
Don't move your camp so people remember where you are, try different things until you notice what consistently sells &amp; at what price. It takes a bit to get it settled.
---
It's a very steady income. I can't keep my vendor stocked.
---
Rest assured the next atomshop rework will involve cutting the atoms you get by playing.
---
It depends, if it‚Äôs a one time thing for a few hundred Atoms, then no big deal. Not happy about it, but not going to have a meltdown over it either. If it‚Äôs another consumable, then they can absolutely kiss my ass. 
---
Ammo conversion should‚Äôve been in the game from the get go. It was bad design to miss it, now if they want to sell us a fix...well, that just sucks.
---
Thank you so much! 
---
What prices are fair? Aren‚Äôt they already set for you?
---
Guessing its going to depend on server load. If people are renting one for them and a few friends, with the same restrictions the current servers have, I'd assume it would perform better (less stash to track, less CAMP objects, less concurrent things happening across the map, etc). 
---
If its full up to the 24 limit, it *could* be the same level of performance. 
---
Frankly we won't know until they release them, since I'm not holding my breath for them to actually give out details. I've disliked the ITV posts since day one, they're purposefully vague and you see the results of their actions (people left to assuming things, and it seems most generally assume the worst possible end).
---
I think there are going to be more than enough buyers that it won't matter. From a business standpoint, the people who aren't fond of the idea aren't the target users anyway. The people who have willingly expressed interest in paying to have servers for their large organized groups are the target market. 
---
Lets say we have a discord group of 20 people that are primarily interested in nuking the queen. The amount of time they spend waiting to get all 20 of their members onto a public server has to be painful. So they get a private server, all 20 of them can join and they can speed run 3 silos. But why stop there? If all 20 people in that group pay for private servers they can just keep those nukes rolling. 
---
Strictly from a business standpoint, this 100% makes sense. It is easy cash flow to support continued development and hosting of the game.
---
It was in the Atom Shop awhile ago. Hopefully they'll bring it back.
---
Imagine carrying food
---
This comment was made by the cannibalism gang
---
No criticism allowed! Only circle jerking üòé
---
Well there are plenty other ways to make money as a business in game industry. They just took the dirty and quick way.
---
I play on PC.  And honestly, I don't look at vendors with 1K or so ammo, there's little point.  But that's my personal preference (I'm not going to bother picking up a couple hundred ammo at a time).  So yeah, I may have a blind spot at that level.
---
Add to that, I don't *personally* care about 1000 cap sales that much, so I don't really think about selling off my 250 .38 bullets.  But other people may find those sales important, so *they* care about them.
---
Looking around, I'm seeing *maybe* half of the vendors have ammo, though a lot of those have only a couple hundred.  I guess I have a hard time believing that most people will be affected by something like ammo converters, though I'm sure some people certainly would.
---
Awww man...I hope they bring it back üò≠üò≠
---
Right, as I explained. And yet it's not supposed to spawn you multiple times within a death zone.
---
Which is why I and multiple people have accounts that after as little as two times dying inside a red zone, it will spawn you outside of said red zone.
---
Your right there xD
---
that's the same as halving the price man. The value of atoms is determined by how much they cost to buy vs their buying power in the store. YOu can either halve the price in the store, doubling their buying power or double the payout for purchasing, halving their value.
---
It might not go the best with it but I think the tattered field jacket could work. Really hard to get though
---
Literally every pvp fps. That's been a thing as far back as I recall, and Halo made it extremely popular.
---
How do you get it?
---
I think so. It seems like I'm selling stimpacks, radaway and purified water to the vendors every day just to avoid being overweight. 
---
I actively play 5 toons and they are all barely below the 30k cap limit. There's not much left for me to buy in the game except off other players.
---
I do believe that the "No. Cosmetic only" quote was a reply to a question regarding whether someone could buy a legendary minigun from the Atom Shop. Not saying you're wrong un your ideas or opinion by any means, but this quote keeps being misquoted for the purpose of trying to bash Bethesda for being dishonest.
---
You dont need misquotes to prove a point, Bethesda already does the heavy lifting for us in that department.
---
They're too expensive and that's why they're failing imo. I am not paying 14 dollars for a power armor color skin change nor 6 dollars for a single camo for weapon I'll most likely never use. If you are reworking the atom shop Bethesda please for the love of god consider reworking the prices on top of adjusting the atom challenges. For the love of god find other ways to make money. You could've made wastelanders a 20$ expansion and no one would have complained because it seems like you are putting actual effort into it's development rather than trying to incorporate the atom shop into the gameplay loop.
---
As I said at the start of my post, I‚Äôm not bashing Bethesda. I‚Äôm a fan of theirs.
---
 Bring me a *nice crisp piece of meat*!
---
Farm whitesprings for legendaries better if it‚Äôs nuked. Also check out the player vendors, I‚Äôve found some cheap legendaries that I‚Äôve bought and re-sold at a higher price.
---
I'm sure if enough people expressed interest in paying for its development such an app would get underway in no time.
---
Play the market, it's super easy to make money in this game. I have issues getting rid of all the caps I make. It comes with time.
---
Me too, but you started the entire thought process with that specific Twitter post.
---
Them reversing course on a cosmetic-only approach would be way easier to swallow if they weren't outright lying. But what they really mean by "the community is demanding this" is that they're making money in the shop. 
---
I'm amazed, given how much flak they've received over 76, that they're not trying harder to avoid upsetting people. But I'm sure someone's crunched the numbers and they'll make more money like this.
---
My guess is that they will allow character transfer, at least before mods are introduced (I do not know yet how those will be handled exactly). Similarly to the old survival mode, that is now replaced by private worlds. Making those essentially just adventure mode with the player count reduced to 1 (+ whoever joins via the social menu) is both the easiest implementation, and my impression is that the developers do not like the idea of forcing the player to create a new character, or to take away progress.
---
Fuck the obstacle courses should be piss easy on paper but they are so buggy. I had to redo the camp venture one so many times because it wouldn't count some checkpoints I was going through.
---
Probably. Which means, really, that it's just a way to make us pay more into the game. You can already have an essentially solo experience without this feature.
---
Exactly. A lot of people who got the protectron and/or the fridge got them because they're funny (the robot) or they complete their house's decor (the fridge). 
---
I don't need the protectron. I have a junk pile. If I could use the collectron as a junk extractor skin, I'd get him and then he can spend all his time sitting on my junk pile, scrapping stuff and putting it in the little hopper for me. For that matter, if I could get him in game and then get a Codsworth-esque Mr. Handy skin, I'd place him down at my camp and leave the hopper unlocked for visitors using my workbenches.
---
I don't want to store food at my camp. But if I could get the fridge in game and pick out a skin for it in the Atom Shop, I'd gladly put a proper kitchen in my house.
---
Talon company mercs
---
Over the past year there have been quite a few topics just here in this sub asking for it. Seems to have fallen on deaf ears, BGS hasn't acknowledged it publically at all.
---
There are so many assets in game already that I'd kill for in my camp.
---
It would help if the dailies were not horribly un-fun. 
---
I dislike server hopping, rng, bug infested challenges and the challenges that require me to do things that require other players or wear specific outfits (especially when i paid real money for what i'm currently wearing) or play poorly thought out raids all suck the fun out of playing the game.
---
Dailies like killing radscorpions in the savage divide or sloths in the bog can be super easy or horrible frustrating.
---
Yes, but you don't get the caps from the purchase.
---
Title: no bugs at all
---
Description: well a couple of bugs
---
You can't run from the bugs! they are everywhere!
---
It is super cute. If they had him peeking out of some other styles of backpack, I'd totally get one. The super modern spaceship one just doesn't quite fit my character.
---
I rarely crash maybe 1/10 but that's just like nearly every other online game i play
---
Indeed, because that‚Äôs the source of the ‚Äúcosmetic only‚Äù argument. That‚Äôs foundation of the side arguing that the Shop was meant to be cosmetic only. The retort to that is that he was an employee of theirs and sometimes employees are wrong and/or things change. That‚Äôs what I tried to lay out at the start of the post before I dove into my suggestion, which you‚Äôll notice isn‚Äôt all rooted in Hines saying ‚Äúcosmetic only.‚Äù
---
You're assuming you can move characters between private servers.
---
That may not be a thing, though it's possible.  But if there is portability between servers, expect that you will have almost 0 control over the server settings (other than who can join).  Whereas, if characters are locked to a specific server, it's possible that eventually you'll be able to control things like mob spawns and levels, or other more granular controls.
---
This will prevent people from leveling and gearing up on a server that has (as a stupid example) all level 100 3-star legendary mobs with 1 HP, making it stupidly easy to level and gear up fast.  Or even settings that turn off all the legendary effects that you don't want to see.  Moving a character from a server like that to any other server would be problematic.
---
I kind of dispute your claim. I think one of its big problems, based on a game set in the "Fallout" universe, is its tonal shift.  It is all-over the place and I think they tried too hard to have elements of so many fps games and that diluted the the brand name. It tired to appeal to everyone. That being said, yeah, I hate that tactic of bouncing around like you're a g\*d\*mned rabbit on speed.
---
They seem to have issues with preventing exploits with what they already have on their hands, so it's not a huge surprise that they don't want to introduce another source of potential exploits.
---
Yeah right XD?
---
I just reminded that radroach exploding from nowhere it was funny but at the same time I got scared XD
---
I need them! üò≠üòç
---
Pc or console?  Just curious.  I‚Äôm on PC and have only had one hard lockup (game, not PC) a few days ago, and one server disconnect yesterday.   Played this morning for three hours no issues.  I think I am one of the ‚Äúlucky‚Äù ones too.
---
 I know I'm not the scheduled speaker, but I have a few words, if I may. There was a time not so long ago when we were bound together not as members but as family. As a clan.

And when Mr. House came to us with his proposal, we accepted, knowing we stood to gain much. Little did we know how much we'd lose in the process.

As a society, we've endeavored to sample the finest food and drink the world has to offer. But we are living a lie. There is a meat sweeter than the most cornfed livestock. Most of you have tasted it. All of you have coveted it. Among us, it is a crime to discuss a return to the old ways that unified our people. 
---
Tonight, that all changes. The taboo ends. Let me finish, Marjorie. You don't know it yet, but you are all now guilty of a greater crime. One that ordinarily bears the harshest of punishments. Surely that you are all guilty warrants not only universal amnesty but also a renewed discussion. 
---
For our society to be truly elite, we must dine on the most delicious, the most exclusive food known to us. And tonight, for the first time as a society, you are sampling that very dish, the meat we are forbidden to taste, the way it was meant to be eaten! Fellow members of the White Glove Society, bon appetit! \~ Mortimer

I don't really see any "hate" about the delay. The only thing i see getting hate was the part were they said they are going to double down on the practices that were already getting "hate".
---
I've been getting more blue screens on ps4 pro lately, especially with the legendary exchange machine.  I tried a clean install last night and it's still an issue.  Any recommendations?
---
Then you ARE lucky üòâüòâ
---
True lol. I dont start using stimpacks till like level 40 when they start to matter so i defenitly understand that. Until that point i hoard stims and bloodpacks,  I just prefer not to be close to death tho so i can get some bullets in without someone one hitting me lol. Death, respawn, more bullets, die, wash and repeat lol. Same with armor, i dont bother when you level up so quick and theres players vendors everywhere now so that makes it easier then what it use to be lol. The JE is a great low level find! My shotgunner picked up a level 25 QE double barrel off a bloodbug for his leveling helper üòÖ
---
Idk, I also play on PS4 not a PS4 pro a PS4 slim a lower version. That's strange.
---
Asking for it or offering to pay for it if it were provided? Yes it would be really nifty no doubt, it just seems most people are blind or willingly ignorant to the fact that Bethesda is very much a business and they have numerous employees that need to be paid. They don't exactly have shining reviews at the moment, it may be fair to say that things are a bit tight financially. 
---
As it is now they have their hands pretty well full supporting the mess they have created and trying to deliver the updates they have committed to. Pulling somebody away to develop something totally different doesn't exactly help their progress or their bottom line.
---
There is a small one in the Overseers cache at Morgantown airport. The bigger one is acquired through the Tadpole quest line. The small one doesn't allow skins and carries less, but it is useful until you can earn the larger one through the quest line. That one carries more and allows skins from the Atom Shop, plus a few skins in game. The in game ones that I'm aware of are the one that's unlocked immediately that's a Pioneer Scouts design. That's the one I'm currently using. Project Paradise at Arktos Pharma also drops a skin, but they recommend you be at least level 50 before doing that quest/event. If there are others, I'm not aware of them.
---
Why you here, and why you hatin?

Luck [16] üòÇ
---
Yeah there was a period earlier this summer where crashes happened to me a lot. It‚Äôs honestly been a lot better since the Vault Raid update for me on PS4. For the last 2 months I‚Äôve had stable play sessions and not a lot to complain about.
---
I also play on PS4. But I never been disconnected since November of 2018! Incredible right?
---
I try to remember if I don't have caps others don't either üòÑ I'm not a power player, don't have alt banks, don't farm high end weapons etc. For junk I've found 1 cap per, some items take 10 to bulk, some 15, plus the 1 plastic. So it it takes 10 to bulk 11 caps (adding the plastic). If it takes 15 to bulk, 16 caps. Except lead. Bulked lead sells consistently at 30 caps. Ammo is 1 cap per. It's not too hard (use Ammosmith P card and Super Duper L card) to make 400 5.56 ammo. As soon as it sells you have 400 caps. And you pick up a lot of 308, 38, 45, shotgun shells for free. All at 1 cap. 45 takes a while to sell though. Fusion cells, plasma cartridges, flamer fuel. It's all laying around for free. The only thing is you have to sacrifice stash space to hold it until it sells. 
---
I think early on 5.56 and fusion cores if you're not a PA player could help bring in some caps. Enough to keep you going. Did you get the basic +30lb backpack? Go back to the Overseer stash box in Morgantown Airport. The plan should be in the box. Those boxes are instanced per player so no one can takes yours. The 30lb extra carry weight really helps! Good luck! I hope you can make a go of it.
---
Just yours.
---
No, it is not the same. It would be the same if the game didn't provide you a way to earn Atoms in game.
---
When you loot med crates and chem crates remember to use the ‚Äòsearch‚Äô option (I don‚Äôt know what button this is on Xbox) and you get a chance to find more Chems in them, with the right perk card you can increase your chance of finding them. You can also dilute stimpaks to make 2 from 1 with purified water once you get the recipie for them.
---
Give up on Bethesda. They aren‚Äôt even putting Elder Scrolls 6 on a new engine. It‚Äôll have the same shit problems and they‚Äôll try to monetize it to Oblivion. Like with horse armor and other dumb shit. Like at this point, with the whole China thing, Activision-Blizzard May have surpassed EA, but the 3 worst companies are still those 2 and then Bethesda right behind. Holy shit.
---
Oh then you must love the one where when you kill a scorchbeast the corpse spawns near you everytime you fast travel!
---
It's really weird then.  Even after the clean install, I blue screened in the menu after initial login.  Maybe it has something to do with pro enhancement settings?
---
Yep, now GET OFF MY LAWN!
---
I can get the backpack without doing the quest? Holy shit that‚Äôs amazing. Thank you!
---
I have a route I do each day that takes me to the robot vendor. You can sell stuff for 1400 caps each day. That‚Äôs the main way I earn caps.
---
I am partial to inert flux over water. Yeah, it's got some rad to it, but I like the taste. And it weighs less than water...not sure how that works, but who am I to get hung up on the details.

BuT mIcRoTrAnSaCtIoNs -Bethesda

I have played since launch, I think it‚Äôs already a great game. It was fun to do the additional content as it was released and I have lots of great memories playing with my group of friends.
---
Worse, it could be even your console. I really hope isn't that friend. Hopefully you'll get this fixed soon
---
Get an excavator set, hit toxic Larry's and tanagra town for acid, then use the excavator to farm steel and lead from hornwright test site 3 and lucky hole mine fast travel to your base and log out. Log back in and repeat a few times, smelt the steel and lead down and make a bunch of .556 to sell at 1c each
---
"The freshest perfect pie, plucked politely from the claw of a vending machine."
---
You see that too üòÇ Oh that doesn't happens too often but a friend got freaked out every time he fast traveled XD.
---
Pick up all weapons sell. That's what I do.
---
It's a newer model pro, one that came with rdr2.
---
That's you then. You are literally the first person I've ever seen ask for flux in a trade. I guess what you want is really subjective, but as a general rule of thumb it's Caps, god roll weapons and armor, and 5.56 rounds.
---
Main is a bloodied stealth rifleman, PVE oriented, going for one-shot-one-kill approach. If I don't return from a run with more 5.56 than I started with I did something wrong. Just don't think I'll need it, same with all the other utilities they've added.
---
Unfortunately I'd say there is little chance it won't be in atom shop. The damned things should just be plopped down at train stations for all to use.
---
I won't necessarily be mad about this, but it's got such a lazy feel to it. As mentioned a lot the past day or so, they should be quest rewards offered through playing. It'd be at the trainstations but require some quest to repair them, maybe ending with the CAMP plan. Who knows, that sounds better than grinding the same ol challenges to earn it &amp; certainly better than buying outright.
---
Yes you are correct. You and I have had the same discussion a couple times over the last couple days. I am absolutely rolling with assumptions and speculations, mostly based on observations of what exists now and how I perceive it to work under the hood, history of the level of effort from Bethesda, guesses at financial motivation, and a healthy amount of pessimism. 
---
Despite my continued posts arguing my POV, I actually really want you to be right.
---
Also public events are free fast travel which will get you exp, legendaries, and plans you can learn or sell
---
It shows something on the blue screen?
---
You would most likely get sick of it fast. Had to stop using it a while ago due to the voice.
---
Maybe all these Bethesda boycotters can do so silently, perhaps while playing another game that they do like.
---
It is certainly the source of the "cosmetic only" argument, my point is that specific quote is being thrown around purposely to misinterpret what a Bethesda employee said.
---
You're correct that business models change, employees can be wrong, etc. However the Atom shop to this day still hasn't provided weapons or armor or game changing services.
---
I vaguely remember seeing posts ages ago with people specifically saying they would pay for repair kits/fridge/companions in camp and private servers.
---
I just think it needs said that Bethesda HAS been listening to their customer base. What company wouldn't listen to someone say "I will pay you for this additional service". Surely there are more people out there that disagree with this process, but it makes sense. No matter how greedy it may seem to anyone, no ones in business to not make money.
---
It Is a silly thing and not new. Apparently, gamers like to jump AND shoot, die, repeat.
---
Everyone should just copy that and paste spam it into any and all Bethesda social and support channels lmao. This comment is a win-win for all parties. üëèüèª
---
Vendors or player vendor?
---
Oh hell yeahhh! Thanks :)
---
Thanks! Already got my excavator set so I‚Äôll try that today
---
I'll have to look when I get home.
---
Would you pay atoms for stuff I've seen everyone complain about being useless (even when it has a function) or a monthly subscription fee like most MMOs? Or how about $20-$60 for each expansion that adds all the new content you wanted? The atom shop isn't nearly as bad as you're making it out to be. I haven't spent any money on it cause I can get everything I need in the game itself. If you're spending extra money for the fridge or whatever it's because you want to. Getting atoms isn't that hard and isn't necessary.
---
This has happened to everybody. It‚Äôs part of playing online. Sorry about your lost mats, but they can be regained
---
Ok friend. I'll see what I can do
---
I didn't do the quest and got it. I read it on here and logged in and went to get it. At the time I was level 90 something. It's not the good backpack from the badges, it's just 30lb but it helps. Everytime you go back the plan is there, you can't sell it. But if for some reason you can't get it someone else can pick up their second one and drop it for you.
---
I farm grafton alot. After each event and killing super mutons for there caps and crap i just rinse and repeat by bouncing servers. I useally get a easy 20k in 3hrs
---
Maybe so, but I‚Äôm not gonna tell anyone what to do in this situation. I‚Äôll keep playing 76 and loving it. If they wanna keep playing it while smoke comes out of their ears and they yell about Bugthesda while taking down some Legendary for the thousandth time, be my guest.
---
Oh i really do. Once i killed 3 in close time and their corpses followed me through half the map, makes me feel safe! (in a way)
---
Best thing it's that's a bug that happens in skyrim too with the dragons
---
Damn, thanks!
---
Did I say I don't play? I just don't play every day for a virtual gun skin pal
---
That's because scorched beast are skyrim dragons with new abilities and a new model.
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. I think we‚Äôre pretty much on the same page.
---
It really is terrible. Needs to be a mutation. Or at the very least cost ap per jump.
---
Dog food and canned meat stew from mama dolce. When I cook meat it‚Äôs just to sell it later. If I even bother to cook it.
---
*‚ÄùBut...the community, when repair kits were announced, overwhelmingly didn‚Äôt like it for a mixture of reasons.‚Äù*
---
As is the case in all walks of life, just because those that don‚Äôt like something are the ones that shout loudest, it doesn‚Äôt mean that there aren‚Äôt those that do like it or, indeed, even have no opinion either way. 
---
*‚ÄùSecond, take the time to create a Daily in the Forest that, if a player hasn‚Äôt completed the quest, will drop the plan for the Collectron‚Äù*
---
And in doing so, screw over all those that spent atoms on this item. 
---
*‚ÄùOnce this is done, and this is controversial given ‚Äúthis makes us a deal of money,‚Äù remove the items from the Atomic Shop.‚Äù*
---
At the end of the day, they need to make money to keep paying the wages of the people whose job it is to keep working on the game. Sure, they have plenty of money in the bank already, but that‚Äôs not how the world works.
---
Ah right. Well that ain't great
---
Or the Whitespring carpet.
---
Yvw.
---
I'm often at the brink of giving up when after a hundred world drops or rolls at Mama Murmrgh, it gives me something I've been wanting so I keep going for the next. 6 weeks ago: AAFFR 50 Cal, 3 weeks ago: AAE GG, this Thursday: F10 50 Cal. 
---
Everything else is useless to me but other than getting oddly many Berserker's, the drops are pretty much indistinguishable from uniform RNG. Funny thing is, I have 0 DR, as I don't wear armor in PA, which would ideal for Berserker's.
---
Reddit doesn't keep it's post viable for too long and not everyone follows game journalists anymore. (and again this is before the game even launched)
---
as for Todd, he didn't actively discard local hosting with his statements but then frankly he wasn't committing to anything beyond general ideas back then.
---
That‚Äôs really amazing if max level. I would change my build or start an alt bloodied build for that weapon.
---
Right on man. Glad you had a great time with it.
---
I mean that would be cool, but it would have to be like, the founders lol
---
Ooh, wastelanders quest. 
---
"Hey, stranger, would you be able to help us out? We've been stockpiling a whole bunch of weapons but we're coming up short on the right kind of ammo or stocks to make it. I hear they'd made a machine that can break ammo back into its base components during the war which would be mighty useful, rumour has it they developed it at the old converted munitions factory. If you could find the design specs and bring them back, we'd be mighty grateful and would be happy to give you a copy of the plans for yourself...."
---
Thanks. I‚Äôve learned something new today!
---
This. And that definitely seems like what's it's going to be. Even if they try to muddy the water and give us something less good vs evil... it's still a real boring set to pick in a series with so many interesting factions.
---
What's its name?
---
Yea i basically run around naked lol, low level armors don‚Äôt help much any ways, a level 62 ghoul always kill me with one smack, so why bother. I wish I could find a low level Berserker explosive something, I‚Äôm sure running naked will get the most out of it üòÇ
---
Branch off to go somewhere for blank holotape, somewhere else to get someone's password, then find out somewhere else has the program to decrypt the data.... Found definitely be fun.
---
I hope you found out the name of the camp owner
---
People with frog legs die just as easily as folks without it. Really just easier for them to get high ground. If they jump around while fighting it‚Äôs even easier to kill them. 
---
Honestly could run the standard perk loadout and still win games. Frog legs when used against me doesn‚Äôt bother me much. Hasn‚Äôt prevented me from enjoying and winning games.
---
That weapon doesn't exist, so I assume you are on PC. It must have came from the Developer rooms or modded in. It looks sweet though.
---
Looks like a fucked up combat rifle.
---
If I've learned anything from BGS, you *can't* read anything into what they say.  Make no assumptions, don't give them the benefit of the doubt, don't parse anything.  If they don't come out and explicitly say something, you shouldn't think it will happen (and apparently, not even then).
---
Fortunately, it's a BGS thing, not a general personality trait :P  There are studios that I absolutely trust will do what you think they will, and that's only because they've proven to their communities that that's the way they treat them.  And until they fail (I'm looking at you Blizzard), I'll continue to trust them.  BGS?  Not so much.
---
Qasnt there a acid spitting pistol in Nukaworld?
---
You are all fool's wanting to eat our flesh, what do you think us wastelanders hav been living on it is you who are on the menu so run and hide my children..we are coming for you
---
But my grilled radstag carry buff.
---
It could. But Bethesda has chosen online only and only ever pitched and marketed it that way.
---
Diablo 3 did online and "offline" so I don't know why they couldn't do the same here. 
---
I would have preferred a similar multiplayer style (core single player game you can play also with friends or randos online and then add on multiplayer dungeons, maps and "raids")
---
Nah, been rolling the purveyor for a fixer, basically all id want for now
---
It didn't show a name, I'm not sure you can view names of weapons on display
---
I have to ask. How many more of you guys are on reddit? I always had a feeling Bethesda has a PR squad pumping out good light for fo76 on the subreddit. Also do they pay well cause I could use a gig?
---
The collectron itself isn't useful, but when lots of people have them and forget to lock it; then scrap collection becomes a breeze.
---
It was some weird name, I couldn't remember the name for the life of me honestly. I didn't know if it was a weapon I just hadn't found yet or if it was one of those modded in weapons or whatever.
---
People want to run their own servers, why is it so hard for people to understand such a simple concept?
---
Also, their servers cost no where near a dollar an hour. Not even close.
---
That is the acid soaker its a dev room item
---
I kind of assumed that, I was getting hyped for having a deliverer type pistol in 76 lol
---
Any  chance you could sell mods or plans that some of us are pulling are hair out trying to find in the atomic shop like the stimpak diffuser I keep hearing different stories about that plan even being in the game and I never see the quest available
---
Being able to convert any ammo you pick up to your favorite ammo would just be too easy IMO, it would make ammo pretty much infinite if you ever do other things in the game than shoot stuff. Not like it's too difficult a chore to begin with and it adds balance.
---
Big protip to make life easier.  Build a personal terminal thing at your camp and access it for alerts, click then one about stranger danger (I think) which will lead you to the starting point for the quest line that gets you the camera.
---
I either sell em off to the vendorbots or in my own vendor.
---
Did I say that‚Äôs why I play?  I said most of the atom challenges aren‚Äôt hard or time consuming.  Killing a gulper in the lagoon takes 2-3 minutes most of which is the fast travel time.  Drinking a nukacherry takes a second. 
---
You‚Äôre free to ignore what you want but a ton of the daily/weekly challenges are achieved just by playing the game.
---
Bethesda never replies to any posts like this sadly. I loved during the collectron/fridge outrage how they kept replying to suggestion threads or trivial stuff but completely ignored every single post complaining about the Atomic shop.
---
I don't get what the big deal is with the collectron. If you choose "scrap" instead of "junk" you get basic stuff. Cloth, rubber, glass, screws, concrete, fertilizer. Occassionally a ballistic fiber. It's not a big deal what you get. Certainly not game changing. Is there something about the collectron I'm missing? Can it be upgraded to pick up better stuff?
---
Fair enough. I've seen some good rolls advertised on the market. I wish you luck in your trade.
---
What helped me in the beginning was diluting every stimpak I found with the chemist perk and super duper perk equipped. Chemist will yield twice as many chems, and super duper will give you a pretty decent chance of crafting twice of anything. With both equipped, each stimpak will have a potential yield of x8 diluted stimpaks
---
‚ÄúFaLLoUt 76 hAs nO depTh aNd StoRy!‚Äù

Says the bastard that sped through the game and hit level 100 their second day of playing. Never read, never listened, never paid any attention. The game is dripping with stories.
---
If you're talking about camp budget, I'm sure that 33 small generators would take up a LOT more than 1 fusion generator.
---
Nobody mentioned the Strength Perk Bandolier x2 for a 90% reduction on ballistic ammo weight, or Ordnance Express to reduce explosives weight (grenades, mines, missiles,  and Mini Nukes).
---
Looks like there's a few empty suits there ready for the newcomers to climb into, nice work. I'm a fan of leaving a frame with a few spare cores left for them, have done that many a time. Heck, even so far as some armor and a decent first weapon. Welcome packs.üòä
---
Yeah I went there
---
Serotonin
---
Today has been really good for me, too. I even loaded into a server in under a minute instead of needing to stand around waiting for it to load in. Kind of amazing that last part, lol. 
---
On PC btw.
---
I just wish they'd add mods to shovels to make them viable weapons instead of just a gimmick. I'd totally use a legendary shovel, the sound they make when you hit something is super satisfying.
---
They are totally worth doing, especially now that the dailies are rewarding badges again. Some of it is a drudgery, but the backpacks are game changers.
---
Do you ever wonder if the creatures that explode like robots do are actually synths? Sure, they SAY synths of that complexity weren't created until later, but if you trust the Institute, you're a fool.
---
Unread plans will collect under your Notes tab, and various mineral ores will be in you Misc section.
---
Both are frequently awarded by quests or events,  and are easily missed or forgotten.
---
Vendors. I can get almost 50 caps per assault rifle from West Tek. When I‚Äôm just trying to get all my caps for the day that is where I‚Äôll go
---
This has to be some sort of miracle.
---
Well then you don't trade often or not for niche stuff or with traders that have literally everything. No offense.
---
You need to do the Scouts stuff for a modable backpack, but not for the small one.  I've crafted a level 50 backpack from the plans and it's given me +50 to carry weight.
---
AWOL Armaments didn't work for me; I was weating tatered 3 piece suit and fedora.  AWOL has only come up once for me this week.  Can't recall an event that did work.  Anyone have suggestions?
---
You're right, I remember people saying things like "Hell put it in the atom shop, I'll buy it"
---
Found the synth, everyone!
---
Can you pet the dog?
---
ESO community would be jealous as f√∑#*

I got you my guy
---
Oh fuck. Welp looks like I'm not getting that
---
*one person asked for it, then a few hundred people upvoted the post
---
Thats really what they mean
---
Whoa. Most I've ever seen is I think 32.
---
A few patches ago they changed the matchmaking from region-locked to global
---
*‚ÄùAdding in Non-cosmetic items in the Atomic Shop, going against what every person on planet earth wants for the Fallout 76?‚Äù*
---
In the latest *Inside the Vault,* they say that these are now the most popular items in the Atomic Shop. So maybe it‚Äôs possible that more people will disagree with your comment than agree.
---
Oh cool thanks, do you think its worth a look back with my level 61 character or to start fresh on a new character
---
It‚Äôs not too bad. Level 50 or something I think. And it looks really cool.
---
Congrats on saying the exact same thing as 50000 other threads. If you don't want to play it, don't. Go back to New Vegas and play that another thousand times I guess.
---
Don‚Äôt know if pvp is your thing but Nuclear Winter isn‚Äôt really like regular BR. More like pvp in adventure but on a larger scale.
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt really even care as long as they aren‚Äôt massively game breaking. When the fridge and collectron came out everyone said they were Uber OP, but honestly the fridge is useless and the collectron barely keeps up with my junk extractor. As for the scrap kits, they‚Äôre marginally useful in select situations. The most useful thing in there are the repair kits, but even they are useless compared with how easy it is to get advanced ones from the queen and whatnot. So long as they keep it to more of a slight convenience or something slightly worse than base game features I don‚Äôt see a problem.
---
Find a robot vendor and kill everything around there and pick up everything you can. Non-scrapped junk can be sold. I have a spot I hit everyday now. Vendors have a max of 1400 caps per day. Anything you buy will increase that a bit.
---
Sell 1400 caps worth. Buy something for 900. You can then sell up to around 300 more. Not sure the exact percentage but it‚Äôs around that I think.
---
Ooooo gotcha! Thought they were missing a word or two
---
Yeah, I learned that recently bc, naturally, I totally assumed it was on server cool down. So I just loot my 3 legendaries every day, turn them in for 2 shitty instigating pipe pistols, and call it a day. Fun!
---
Are you gonna be ok?
---
Do you need me to call your mum.
---
Most of the content added is better for a higher level. Like yeah there's content for lowbies and some of the new quests are geared for lowbies, but the repeatable stuff is meant for higher levels
---
Doesn't matter if you could make 1k atoms a week it would still be a waste of time unless you like shit flower pots and tires. Terrible rewards tbh
---
It's ok, I'm at your mum's house and she's making me feel better
---
And it should be said another 50000 times. I'm glad you can outright enjoy the game because it's one thing I can't. However, you're undeniably settling for mediocrity. As for myself, I choose to not remain silent on the subject. It's a recipe for stagnation. So yeah, you're fucking right. I'm not going to play the game. As for yourself, go run Uranium Fever another thousand times I guess.
---
Wow borderlands dead already, I thought people were gonna start calling it Bangerlands. Because it's such a banger
---
Too much psycho dude
---
Because that would be pay-to-win and it'll be all over youtube and reddit that you have to pay for a shitty backpack skin to complete a shitty daily without carrying a shitty weapon.
---
I cant just never even find a match. I'm on pc, Eastern US timezone. And I never even find a a match
---
Last night I did Camp Venture 3 times in a row. The last time I didn't even wait for the little markers to pop up, I just ran through the course. I'd hear the (hilarious but extremely delayed) "pew" noise for passing the checkpoints even after I crossed the finish line, waiting for the lag to catch up to me.  
---
As the timer ran down to 0, the notification that I'd failed popped up and then the rewards for passing the challenge were displayed on my screen. It still didn't register as having completed it in my challenges, so I ran back to the start and pushed the button again, at which point the announcer congratulated me on completing the race. So buggy.  
---
The voice actor for the agility courses cracks me up, though, so I forgive them.
---
Also, Gamertag for Xbox One is Nintendoguy33. If any of you are just starting or wanting to just play.
---
Feel free to add me.
---
FO76 is dead. the sentence is a non linear digression.....
---
I haven't done UF in I dunno, a month or something. There are so many other ways to get Legendary drops. Even just wandering around I run into Legendary mobs. 
---
Bitching about something that's over a year old is pointless. They're not going to magically make it whatever you want it to be. Either you get over it, and enjoy it for what it is, or move on.
---
It‚Äôs alright my group nuked Vault 94 on launch week as an experiment
---
Are we really comfortable declaring that was not something the game designers/developers could have come up with on their own?
---
I sent a friend request
---
oh whoa bud you got em that was sick definitely worth the time it took to type
---
Trying way too hard.
---
The point of from the opposing side to utility items in the Shop is that Pete Hines stated before the game‚Äôs release that the Shop would be ‚Äúcosmetic only‚Äù and items like scrap and repair kits, the Collectron, and other utility items are not cosmetic.
---
Not as much as you‚Äôd think.
---
Maybe 3k to the right person that‚Äôs desperate for a special Fixer.
---
Boderlands dead to with all the nerfs they keep doing
---
Or just have free servers
---
Did you get bombarded with msgs from people threatening you aswell.
---
Just wanted to say thanks for putting all of that into one statement. üëå
---
You mistake my commentary for bitching. There's no bitterness, I'm just passionate on the subject. I apologize for that misunderstanding.
---
In any case, I assure you I moved on some time ago.
---
Nice. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
&gt; That post was removed and this one probably will be too because "the title is too vague"
---
I read this kind of stuff every time on most subreddits, I don't know what's wrong with reddit mods and their rules but they never make sense and are so inconsistent. That's why I only comment and hardly ever post because it gets deleted, so I feel ya.
---
And yeah the "disconnected from server" sucks so bad, we have been in need of a "rejoin last server" so bad since launch to at least we can try to rejoin the fight and make up for the bad servers. Though sometimes it's the whole server that crashes and everyone gets kicked out so yeah, servers are just not good.
---
Though I wouldn't recommend you to fight that thing so underleveled lol. It's usually not worth to spend most of your ammo and heals for something like that, I mean you can try if you want but after wasting so many resources you probably will just feel bad. This is somewhat a survival game so considering if a fight is worth it before engaging is important.
---
 You are probably just a boring person. Certainly this shit is ancient. ;)
---
They can. Bethesda chooses not to.
---
Love and hate for a video game is misplaced.
---
Pain in the arse without a doubt, but its likely not causing any stress to the hardware on either end (well, besides the stress the 76 servers already have to deal with). 
---
It is pretty annoying that server hopping is basically a requirement of the game however.
---
Only one year late. I thought that I had overslept.
---
don't forget to keep your purafied waters unlocked.
---
Where can I get some of these mods?
---
If they were max $9 Australian I‚Äôd buy a lot of atoms...
---
RIP puppydog üò¢
---
 Yes. I think my biggest source of income is drugs, I never use em' its hardly necessary.
---
im not.. as soon as i got the standard backpack I stopped messing with that shit
---
This is exactly the type of Atom Shop behavior I would support, and I'd feel good about it, too! 100%!  
---
As it is, I feel guilty and somewhat embarrassed that I bought the collectron (though not the fridge). I supported a greedy and underhanded maneuver and there are regrets. If the fridge and collectron had their own quest and came as a free reward, with the option to buy skins for them both in the Atom Shop, I could see that as a universally accepted and community-supported decision.   
---
Heck, even if they retroactively made them free with the skin-buying option, I'd support that. Maybe they could toss the people that already bought them a refund, or a free skin or something. I know if I got a refund, I'd absolutely just spend it again on skins. I think they should seriously consider this.
---
ROTFLMFAO. This is getting good. You will get your share of an AWS instance. Just another server ... but yours. ;)
---
Nuclear Winter
---
I had a similar experience. Except that I did crash at the end of it. But hey, 4 hours without a crash is as good as you can hope for. Skyrim and Fallout 4 usually crashed once every four hours too.
---
You can get the from the daily repeatables.  If I had to guess it‚Äôs around 1/10z
---
who?
---
Do you have a phone?
---
not gonna lie...
---
Wait a minute. Am I real then? Are you real? Is anything real?
---
Not too bad if you do the toxic clean up and the stings and things daily. Somedays i get 2 and some days none.
---
I've always got them this way cause campfire tales was bugged for so long. Guess it can drop now but you have to wait for it to start.
---
One of the youtubers who covers negative aspects of FO76 fairly frequently. A number of people on this Reddit are obsessed with him and his ilk, for some odd reason.
---
What does it matter - let them have their garish fun
---
Made a post recently that suggesting the Flatwoods monster drop legendary versions of the alien blaster. Would make the encounter special if it was the only way to get one
---
if this isnt sarcasm.
---
some "game reporter" who always gets his info wrong, is normally way late after the outrage ends, just reads the top post of the subreddit word for word, then attacks reddit for calling him out on his shit.
---
pretty much your standard "youtube newsperson"
---
To add on everyone else's answer. Caps make caps. So once you have a significant amount start buying serums from player vendors. Usually people will sell them for around 300 caps per. You can then sell them to the bot vendors for 500. Very easy way cap the vendor each day.
---
How did that that go?
---
Grim sending unknown noobs into uranium feaver is like sending them to there graves. As most who do that event are lvl 50+ so a noob entering will be slaughtered fast.
---
Damn, aren‚Äôt they usually like 13k In the white spring area? Why do they sell for so cheap?
---
Thanks btw
---
Pretty much everybody would have bought a polished Gatling gun skin by now had it been released at a reasonable price and wasn't in the shop for only two weeks.  Easy money.
---
But when they mess up so horribly like the fancy bar set's mirror having PICKAXE PILSNER just plastered across it, how much faith can I have in any future cosmetic purchases?
---
Idk, are they even selling cool t-shirts like they did for Fallout 4's release?  Atom Shop quality isn't the only failure here.  There's opportunities abound, and just bad leadership at Bethesda.
---
Imagine actually spending a perk slot on something food related. 
---
#killallcasuals
---
What do you have for trade
---
Thanks for the info, no wonder it‚Äôs the ‚ÄúI have a friend who does this quest‚Äù kind of event, I was confused as to why it was so special.
---
Yeah, I think I just hit level 9 on there. I am not great at PVP.
---
I feel your pain, friend. After an hour of searching, I finally found a single animal spawn - a little level 1 radrat pup. Not exactly what I was looking for, but I thought what the heck, it looked cute. So I tamed him and hoped he'd show up in my camp later.
---
I logged back in the next day and there he was, panting heavily and staring at me with his little red beady eyes right outside my front door. I spent the next 5 minutes bonding with him and taking photos, then off I went to do some events and sell weapons. Less than an hour later I came back to my camp to check on him, and... he was gone. Forever. 
---
Rest in peace, Rattsworth. I loved you for the few minutes I got to spend with you.

Oct. 16, 2019 - Oct. 17, 2019
---
It does look super sweet
---
If they add legendary PA, they need to add new modifiers so it doesn't break the balance (?).
---
Something like *Sighted - Increases Aimed Accuracy*, or *Energized - Increases Energy Weapon Efficiency*
---
Bethesda be like: gooby pls
---
I know that ripped off feeling, l killed an attacker and it cost me 50 Caps.
---
I had claimed the Workshop  at  Posieden Power Plant and was mining lead.
---
Killing time i went over to the nearby Station to have a Browse.
---
Scrolling through the Robot itinerary some clown starts attacking me.
---
I stop what i am doing.
---
I turn around and retaliate initiating PvP.
---
He starts jumping around in his Power Raider armor.
---
I kill him with a few shots from my explosive automatic Rifle.
---
Notification comes up that i am the one who has lost 50 Caps .This whilst i am stood looking down at this Clown Body.I give his corpse another blast until it disintegrates.
---
I was not even in the Workshop range at that time to defend it.
---
He re-spawned at the Posieden Workshop 50 Caps richer after being killed.
---
Go figure.
---
*PHARMA FARMER* and lots of looting. It gives you a chance to re-search every medkit, doctor's bag and first aid kit in the game. It's pretty lucrative
---
That would scare the shit out of me if I came out of the vault to that üòÇ
---
 Last few sessions I've met some new players at the vault/flatwoods to drop them some armor and 10 mm and ammo as well as some water and stimpacks. Ended up playing with one guy for over an hour teaching him about the game and talking about life. We added each other as friends and plan on playing together again! I love this community
---
Give us more rundown building options. Like the paneling that‚Äôs a combination of the wood and corrugated metal on the outside and with props to hold the walls up. 
---
Maybe some deteriorated wallpaper, not fancy brand new stuff.
---
Who gives a fuck?
---
Mole miners = lots of black titanum and is a insta 5.50 ammo farm.
---
I mean, isnt this his job somehow? Hes saying nothing wrong either. Patch gets delayed, Bethesda plans to move further away from promised cosmetic only store.
---
Should he ignore them? Lie in his Video and say everything works as planned? Tell people that Bethesda will surely do the right thing?  
---
I dont get the obssesion here with these Youtubers and there "lies". So far, only bethesda lied to me, and that was about the cosmetic only store. And Bethesda is the one I paid, not some random youtube guy nobody cares about.
---
Can I have your account?
---
 A lot of followers in this world.
---
Lol! Ive seen many like you traveling appalachia and always gives me a chuckle. Im sure youll find it, just keep it in the back of your mind somewhere and hope the laws of attraction take hold lol. I fully believe in that, honestly thats how i got most of my gear as crazy as that may sound. Never had luck with finding what i wanted off of here (reddit), always in a vendor or a drop besides the fixer plans, theyre all over. The only reason i threw out instigsting as a helper is because thats what i used for most of my builds (6, deleted 1) when low level. Even now with only using crack shot a instigating 10mm will take out a mutant in 1 or 2 bullets. I wish you the best of luck young wanderer and only wanted to give advice so sorry if i offended. If youre on ps4 i will be more then happy to help you in your travels. Always help the low levels when i can, cant tell you how many i showed a supply route to lower their junk costs....and im a junker lol üòÅ

Nuka cola cherrys or even quantum work too. The quantum nades suck so only other use is is brewing alcohol. Ran with the nuka nut perk for a bit and it's nice. There is no animation so you can pop them mid fight. Was grest for survival.

It does cost ap to jump

I dont know we couldn't scrap ammo from the beginning.

You can get the mods by getting Possum badges, which require grind quests similar too (but in some ways more grind-tastic) than the Tadpole quests. You can also allegedly get Possum badges from completing the various daily Pioneer Scout events (e.g. Campfire Tales, etc), but I cannot personally confirm this from my own experience.

Would be kind of interesting if you killed someone in pvp if their body dropped human flesh in their loot bag as well

They sell cheap because they are relatively cheap to make once you have the recipe.

Huh? Since when is "always on" considered offline? Just because you don't play with others does not mean it's offline. Even if you play alone, you play online, not offline.

Mules, and they hire a courier.

Hell i coulden't help but bust out laughing this morning when a mid lvl greafer in full raider PA tried to kill my lvl 110 toon by blowing up a bus next to me.  Instead of it killing me it left me at 90% health and every bot in the area was after that greafer.
---
Yeah, I'm inclined to agree. Simple explosive just isn't enough to make it trade for much.
---
Can I haz your stuff?
---
I mean, caps. I have stuff in my vending but not sure what you'd want. It just takes less time for me to spend some caps
---
Sorry, I don‚Äôt off the top of my head, and I‚Äôm on the road. You should be able to google it and find some guides. Also, forgot to ask - has it ever run, or this happened since you first installed it? One more thing you can try is a complete uninstall/reinstall.

Radaway is easy to make once you figure out how and where.
---
It doesn't matter how much scrap you get from the protectron vs. how much you can get it however long of looting.  The point is you get scrap for free without looting.  You can get a nice bonus when you return to your camp that you didn't need to loot for.  That's utility.
---
And you use the missile launcher and tell me it's balanced.  The durability on that thing is garbage even with 200% condition.  The auto grenade launcher at least goes from 4 reloads to 8 reloads when 200% repaired which isn't terrible.  I don't know exactly what the missile launcher gets before it breaks but it's way too fucking low.  And yes, modding for durability absolutely fucking matters.  I can mod any rifle to have a whole heap of durability.  But any mod on the missile launcher subtracts from it.  It's almost not worth modding it but putting a quad barrel is too useful to pass up.  But any of the other mods like the stabilizer or a scope or targeting computer just aren't worth it.  They make the gun break even faster and on top of that weigh a stupid amount.  The base gun weighs 20 but with mods it can weigh double that.  I rarely use repair kits on my rifles but will use them on my explosive guns because they break too often.  Having to keep going back to camp just to repair a missile launcher that already does unimpressive damage just isn't worth it.  I shouldn't be forced to put an extra 5 points in Int just to use gunsmith for 50% more durability just for my explosive guns when my primary rifles don't need that at all.  And don't say repairing to 200% condition is better than the repair kits.  The repair kits let you repair your gear anywhere which is a huge utility and when you're using explosive guns that will break way too quickly regardless of if they're repaired to 200% or not you're going to want to repair them in the middle of a fight.

Get rank 3 of that perk card that increases the amount your items sell for. Then grind super mutants and scorched, pick up all their assault rifles and other weapons and sell them. And sell bulk junk; acid especially.
---
Right.
---
find your own stuff
---
Even right the most upvoted suggestion Thread for the fridge said "wouldnt mind if yould put it on the Atom store".
---
I'm pretty neutral towards the Atom store in General, but the Statement of Beth making up the community wanting more stuff, also utilities, in the store is just bogus.
---
There are also more communities for fo76 than this one, where the General opinion is far more generous.
---
During the first presentation of fallout 76.
---
Have any vanguard legs?
---
Exactly this.
---
Well I'm nowhere near having that amount of caps yet but it something to remember down the road. Cheers üëç
---
how much do the recipes usually go for?  ballpark don't need exact, thanks
---
Same! Had a great day üòÉ
---
Ya seen that vid posted on youtube. I just rolled my eyes went into the vid long enough to down vote it then went on my way.
---
Hold the phone.... You....YOU CAN TAME PETS?! HOW!
---
If you really want to take on higher-level content early...
---
Make a melee build (STR and a 2-handed weapon like Sledge Hummer or Super Sledge) you can take on content approx. 20 levels above.
---
Also, store your junk in the Stash and don‚Äôt be too afraid to die (you will respawn with full HP and continue)
---
Why would you think they would convenience the consumer??
---
Don‚Äôt scrap weapons until you hit the cap limit from vendors. Just run some areas and take the weapons straight to a vendor and sell. It helps to equip the Hard Bargain perk and have your camp close to the vendor to fast travel back there for free.
---
or they do it like old wow, killing the flight path npc at crossroads....for the horde!
---
I'm *slightly* less inclined to write off cosmetic mods on the private servers, as they're getting a steady income stream from them, so they *may* be less concerned about the atom shop being subverted.
---
I also wonder if they have any real ability to know *how* to control what is and isn't allowed when it comes to private servers.  But that's my cynical side showing.
---
Nope, sure don't.
---
Too late now people have shown them they are willing to pay for it... If they didn't sell them they would of rethinked things...
---
Its the problem with modern gaming too many people have been raised on MTXs in games now it's normal...if everyone avoided them then the publishers would go back to selling expansions and offering free content between them to keep people playing
---
The reason they are the most paid for items in the atomic shop is exactly my point, they are non-cosmetic, making them the only useful items in the atomic shop, making them the best items in the atomic shop by default. Perhaps people like paying for items that are going to give an advantage (a small, but considerable one) but that puts people who don't pay for the items at an obvious disadvantage, especially the fridge. that doesn't mean that bethesda is not justified in adding these items, its just that the items are not even earnable at this point.
---
fyi I don't want that.  I had my fun trying to level a new toon or two years ago.  sucks being stuck for 30min with no main to fight back
---
Ok?
---
Farm players lol 
---
PvP for everyone!!

Just got this one today at the house east of the overseer camp in the forest. Really felt like a good introduction to the sheepsquatch, since I never encountered it before and only knew bits of information related to it; seeing it had killed high level mutants was a real "oh crap" moment.
---
They don't have the ability to control most of that from a programming standpoint.  They'd do it if it was easy to fix, but it doesn't seem like they know how.
---
That, and a lot of their time has been funneled to the new content, though I'm not sure how much that really has to do with it.

I had a camp in the mire next to gulper lagoon and Abbie‚Äôs bunker ,every Sunday like clockwork I would get 3 Scorchbeasts visiting me . The first time was the worst as I was low on ammo and had to dip into my structure to craft what I could to fend off the unruly guests

There's a random spawn near my camp where 3 scorched beasts can spawn in. It's kinda annoying but not real common.

Everything in the shop is eather cosmetic or utillity. Nothing is Pay2Win. Unlike Bethesdas game Blades. Witch is litterly play2win.

You realize that the life of thia game is paid for by Microtransactions, right?

Grab a low-level workshop. They drop in their dozens from the defense quests.

U know this was a anounced months ago

Good enough to dip up treasures... Just not good enough to burry the soldier.

Then why add the game mode to begin with? To watch it get infested with hackers and wither away into another dead game mode...? Doesn't seem like very good game design to me. I'm just speaking for a large part of the Nuclear Winter (PC) community. Either implement a proper system to ban the hackers since we're buy to play, or figure out the anti-cheat. It's honestly shouldn't be tasked to the players to solve this issue though...
---
Wow.  What a war we've missed.
---
It's like watching family fight behind a glass door that's amazingly sound proof when its closed. Then only hearing the end after someone storms off.
---
Well said. Haven‚Äôt played for almost 2 weeks now. I miss it, only made it to level 46. But I just can‚Äôt do it anymore. The whole shooting people on the other side of the map was just too much for me. I‚Äôd always just thought I was really bad, until I died and the camera was on the guy who killed me miles away.
---
What sucks the most here is there is 0 form of anti cheat in fo76. Before NW, there wasn't much interest in making cheats for the game because we already had a built in aimbot with VATS. Now we introduce a battle royale mode with no anti cheat and it is hardly a surprise that it becomes a hackers playground.
---
Bethesda is either going to have to look at purchasing or licensing anti cheat software, invest in making their own, let it go, or shitcan NW.
---
I hit the caps limit easy every day from running an adhesive farm with an oil refinery. The I make a bunch of MIRV grenades.
---
I'm on pc and I'll give you 25k if you want.   IGN is tonynew   I'll buy it out of your vendor.
---
Decide how much of each junk type you need to keep for gear and camp maintenance. Sell all extra junk , you will need to bulk most types to do so. Same with aid items. Only keep so much sell all excess. This also helps to keep stash space free for gear that you either intend to keep or sell. Drop any ammo that you don't use , or can't sell . Sell all desirable ammo that you don't use. Heavy gunner? Sell 5.56. Rifle user ? Sell 5mm and or .50 cal . If camp is anywhere near the middle of map you should be able to make 3000- 5000 caps in a few hour session.
---
16 caps for bulk? They sell for more at the vendor.
---
There is a way to get silo codes to work.. I just can't. Remember how. It comes up every so often with this challenge but this time not so much.
---
Modus and a certian silo? Feel like the wording is off on this one like when the challenges say weird shit in other languages... Only this time the borked english. Thier native language lol.
---
If there a reason level 12 is the time to do it?
---
I might have been wrong, I blue screened yesterday on my level 10 character. Hopefully it will get better.
---
It was something they threw together on a whim (if you believe what they told us).  I'm sure they spend quite a few man hours on it, but I don't think this was something that was well planned out.
---
I can do 50 per if you've got them
---
Thank you! That's where a lot of us are at unfortunately. The game mode is still fun but you go into every game knowing there's going to be a few cheaters in your lobby. It's still worth getting to 100 for the rewards though cause some of them are pretty dope.
---
I1 give private servers existing 3 months before they become dead and then go poof from being too inactive.
---
üòÇ needed a laugh after that I think.
---
"Mystery Bacon" from Nukaworld
---
Or give us passive perk slots, or even perk load outs I would have my adventuring load out and my camp load out with super duper, fix it good, green thumb, chemist etc
---
They only appear as random encounters, animals that are tameable. And you need the right perks. And then they can just die randomly. I went to my camp, then moved servers real quick and when I loaded in Sam the Yao Guai was dead on the ground. It's just not a great system atm
---
Yep would allow so much variation!
---
But let's get private servers first....
---
teehee they has no stuffs
---
Look at his username. Another socialist on reddit. Surprise!
---
If none of em killed ya, they were all lying.
---
Not to mention those 2 items aren't found by playing the game. It's not surprising people bought those items...fricken Bethesda and their spin doctering
---
Problem exists on Adventure it's just not as obvious because you're PvP'ing far less frequently. But yeah, figure out the anti-cheat for one and I'm sure you can do it for the other as well. Or at least have a solid way of looking into reports of who is cheating so you can actively ban the malicious players. Adventure mode is a whole different story because most of the traders there dupe and sell their stuff for actual $$$. I personally know a trader who got hacked and lost all his stuff. He came to another trader literally begging for fresh copies of items. Almost sounded like he was crying (it's pathetic). Everyone knows what for but no one talks about it because they either benefit from it or have just given up on Bethesda doing anything about it.
---
Still could use additional server stability but overall it‚Äôs good. I‚Äôve got 1500 hours logged in it. There is a fair amount of endgame stuff to grind out now too with the vault raids. Even though people complain about them I find them a good challenge but could still be more challenging not just time restricted.
---
Agreed. I‚Äôll be back to work towards level 100 and that sweet hellfire paint, but it‚Äôs just so disappointing at times.
---
They do have free servers. We been playing them for a year. You can continue to play them.
---
I agree with you in that this wasn't very well planned out. But this isn't a school project, dude. It's a product that you're selling to a customer. There are people breaking the company's own ToS and possibly the law. Fix it.

The sobering thing about Super Mutants is that most are simply suffering from deformity and senility.

please report back

At least they are trying not to release a shit show like other times.
---
Definitely exists in adventure and existed in survival. Just as you said though, it is not as obvious nor as prevalent. 
---
Making a good anti cheat is no easy task. It is much like anti virus or doing police work, mostly reactive to what is known
---

We def need something in camps to2 recharge fusion cores. Once robots go poof there goes the whitesprings farming runs for fusion cores.

Sell chems, and guns, and cooked food to veners.
---
Sell mutations to players.
---
Thank you, I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt think of that before
---
Does bulk junk make it somehow more valuable? Like for example, 5 lead = 5 caps, does 1 bulk ( 5 lead ) give me more than 5 caps?
---
I would pay good money for the sink items from old world blues.
---
The farms in the northern forest have all the things most of the time. Besides the radroch meat. They dont expire so get a weeks worth and put them in your stash. Then kill a roach and turn it daily to get random badges.
---
Woah I didn‚Äôt know there was a recipe for them! How do you get it?
---
If you will never buy a Bethesda game again why are you on this reddit page?
---
Great question. Be nice if you could.

For Stimpaks - Arkos Pharma north of the overseers cache. Kill ghouls for Radaway.

And the Heroes of the Wastland statue.

Funny cuz I put a ton of time into borderlands.  And now I am back to fallout 76.  I feel like there is a lot more to do in fallout 76 than borderlands 3.  At least at the moment.

Do the dailies in Camden park.
---
I've been doing those for a werk. Got nothing. :/
---
Is there anything in particular you're looking for to narrow things down?
---
Would you be interested in a larger quantity of stim packs?
---
Ammo?
---
Hopefully one day we can all be proud to say we play 76!
---
Yeah I know that's why I put it in quotes. You still need to be online but you never have to play with others - the entire game can be played alone.
---
When I first got the perks, I had a tameable radstag appear right in front of my camp. Never seen anything since, months later.
---
I'll keep looking Haha.
---
One analogy I keep using is that they are throwing ideas at the wall like spaghetti to see what sticks. I dare say they are nearing desperation when it comes to figuring out how to keep revenue flowing so they can keep this thing alive. 
---
We haven't seen them put 100% of effort into any of these experimental projects because they are indeed experiments. They are trying to find a formula of some sort. It is my opinion that the private servers are just the latest iteration of this experimental process which is why I don't have much faith in the level of effort put into them.
---
The game needs new content and most of all it needs endgame content.
---
Unplayable is a huge stretch. Sneak more, spot enemies from a distance, play smart and methodically
---
Or unless they have someone to do the event with...i've tried Feed The People so many times &amp; know where everything is, but can't get it done while trying to kill off all the whatever's at the same time.
---
Cracking down via bans is probably the simplest route but they'd actually have to start recording game play and do some investigating themselves. Yes this would cost money but you already have players doing the work for you and sending in what you need. Just act upon it is all we're asking :(
---
If the sale is rigged I'm sure a data miner would be able to tell us. I myself have gotten quite a few goodies now. RNG is a bitch sometimes.
---
The concept of region locked needs to die and stay in 2005. Why on Earth would any companies do it in this day and age is beyond my comprehension. If the person has high ping, boot. No need to assume that everyone has crockshit internet too. It's also borderline discriminating.
---
Get the excavator power armor and a good 2 handed melee weapon. Also, stay away from the mire and the cranberry bog for a while.
---
Thank you! Where do I get mutations tho?
---
See that's a bug that somehow is carried over from skyrims dragons. It's just what happened when you don't update you're game engine in so many years
---
Yeah so apparently I didn‚Äôt scrap them, I stored them. 
---
So that was a relief.
---
Until I realized I ate my radroach meat.
---
I actually don't find any of it useful. üòÑ Stash is always an issue so the scrap kits are useless. Repairing armor/weapons is no big deal. The junk from the collectron is inconsequential. Maybe people raiding Vault 94 find the repair kits useful?
---
I cook it all the time while spaming. Lol
---
Feel free to tell me your asking price.
---
That brings me to another theory that I have: nobody on their development team is actively playing this game. They may boast about how much fun they have in the office testing stuff out, but it is clear as day they have no idea what playing on their own public servers is like.
---
I've played my share of MMOs over the years and the best were the ones where the developers played the game in their off time. You never knew their in game names, but they would openly talk about playing the game and share their experiences. We don't have that here as far as I can tell.
---
I‚Äôve found a pretty easy way to do it tbh. There‚Äôs just no point to do feed the people besides the free non-condition food it gives you. That‚Äôs the only thing of significance you get from it. All enemies are low level so it isn‚Äôt an XP farm or anything.
---
I‚Äôm not sure. That‚Äôs one of the bigger rebuttals to ‚Äúthe utility items are pay to win‚Äù - that you can harvest more junk in game faster than the Collectron gets it for you. I got several hundred lead from one Lucky Hole run compared to very little from my friend Bixby.
---
I don't know which one. Adhesive sells for 11 caps and aluminum for 10 at the White Springs vendor. Both take 10 of each item plus a plastic.
---
What are you on about?
---
Or you're taking an occasional experience of yours and making a grossly generalized statement. I have 2 characters full of just gear that I have traded for, and one full of all sorts of ammo, mostly 5.56. Because that's what MOST people will accept. Gear, caps, or 5.56. SOME might take flux if they need it, but it is far from a common currency.
---
For excavator armor, search the south east area of the ash heap in the depths of garraghan‚Äôs (sp) mining hq.

Asshole? No rad suit or power armor, or are you upset you didn't read the notification/look at the map?
---
They weren't (at that time anyway) selling NW to anyone.  I think it's moved past that point (or at least started to), but what they're selling is the base game (something something atom shop).
---
For all practical purposes it *was* a school project (again, go back and read what they said about it when it came out).  They thought it sounded interesting and threw it together to see what it played like.  In spite of the low effort and lack of deep analysis for things like balance, it was wildly popular for a brief time, so they sank a little more time into it.  But it's *not* the product they have for sale, it's a bunny trail that may lead to something some day.
---
IMO they should have dropped it when they planned to, but seeing as how it generated buzz for the game, they probably felt it was worthwhile to let it play out with minimal investment.  Researching and implementing cheat prevention is *not* a small endeavor, and until they have both the available manpower and the will to commit to the project, it will continue to be treated like a minor side project.  Which is totally is right now.
---
Yeah I know it's pointless cause I'll probably get some trash 1 star but it was more for the fun and the experience, and not like exp
---
Saw this today at Whitesprings. I died and when returning to pick up my loot bag there was a guy dropping nuke mines. I let him be and went right back and picked up all 325. It was a new character so I just sold what I could to the vendor bot. I snapped a pick before I picked anything.
---
You have to stay where your level is, or fight hard enemies to level faster. Its how its made.
---
I had The exact same problem at that level. Getting the plans for and then making the excavator armour really will be a game changer. So is completing the order of mysteries quest line, because the blade of the bastet and the excavator armour is what gave me the extra oomph to get past that level hurdle. I'm still using the blade of bastet now at level 35 because it's just that solid of a one handed melee weapon.
---
Chin up mate, it's not impossible, just seems that way now. If you are on ps4 and want to send me a pm, I'll add you to help you get past this too.

You can search each category by weight, use this to get rid of all the heaviest stuff you don‚Äôt need.

Where are the areas I should stick to?
---
Since 'private worlds' will simply be a small adjustment to the game as a whole, and not a single player game in any appreciable way, I really don't think that's going to be ab option.  *You* may play it by yourself because that's what you want to do, but the game is designed around multiplayer, and pausing the world isn't at all a part of that equation.
---
I doubt they'll make adjustments to the way the game works to make it run more like a single player game, since that's not what they're offering.
---
Literally just bought this and it believe it does, don‚Äôt remember having it before buying the full outfit, but I wish the ammo pouch bandolier was a separate costume item
---
Try melee, wear armor (and upgrade it to your level), keep hydrated and fed. Keep your camp close to water and a vendor. Grind out to 30 and it‚Äôs a breeze.

Make sure your build is right too. Use this site to build your character: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks

Right now the savage divide and the toxic valley north of grafton is the spot for you, that's abouts the level 25-35ish area is.
---
It's a lot better these days. they are no logger as territorial and aggressive towards player camps.
---
And also the people that slowly dwindle away from the game, no interesting shit to do? Less players, less players less money, and I say that as a guy who loved the game but haven't played for a few months out of lack of interest, hopefully wastelanders rekindles my desire to play
---
The forest area, Toxic Valley at Grafton, and maybe Ash Heap bottom left. You can see the areas pretty good. The forest is the Vault area in green, Toxic Valley is white at the top, and ash heap is dark black.
---
Bought my copy for $50.. got a second for $15 and got a 3rd for free with the GOTY edition of Fallout 4
---
Do what i did, hang out at the whitespring and follow the high level players who regularly sweep the place for legendary ghouls and take pot shots at everything you see since you only need one hit on anything that dies to get all the EXP and be able to loot them. 
---
No one cares about it at all and you can if you get lucky enough you can go up many levels very very fast and also most likely pick up a few legendary items to either keep or scrap for succulent scrip.
---
The world is divided into different levels of difficulty so that you'll gradually progress from the forest to the bog as you level up. The game doesn't do a great job at making it clear, but I found this map very helpful when I was levelling up: [https://game-maps.com/fallout-76/Fallout-76-World-Map.asp](https://game-maps.com/fallout-76/Fallout-76-World-Map.asp)
---
Ok. Thanks for the pointers, I am slowly getting it fixed
---
That‚Äôs really helpful, thank you!
---
You can get some sweet deals for servers but *someone* is fronting that cost.
---
 Stick to the left side of the map. Do lots of events as they drop legendary armor you can use to build your defense. Don't worry about the main mission till at least level 50. So you have max level weapons to help with enemies. A great spot to level with moderate enemies is the lumber yard in the top left of the map. Plenty of super mutants and you can server hop over and over.
---
Speaking of dog food, why does carnivore doesn't apply to dog food?
---
it does.
---
The 20s are one of the hardest stretches of the game. I usually don't even start the storyline until I get past 30, sometimes not until 50. 
---
I echo the advice already given and add in that you should hit the public events as frequently as possible, Uranium Fever is one of the best. Your intent is to tag everything, but not try to kill anything especially if it is well above your level. Just stay alive and let the high levels finish it off for you. The XP will flow.
---
I'm not a PA user but if you wear Excavator PA in the mine you get double yield when you harvest. If you have the acid you can wind up with over 800 lead from 1 run, especially with Super Duper.
---
1k+ people are experiencing the same thing as me. It's nothing to do with me and there is no set number if times you die in the red zone that it automatically spawns ou somewhere else. You are the one outnumbered here, not me.
---
I don‚Äôt think most people understand the idea of a random drop. The chance of getting exactly what you want is extremely small. Like 0.001. You would have to spend like 100,000 scrip. That said you may get stuff that is perfect for someone else‚Äôs build. I‚Äôm not a medics build, but I just got a combat rifle that heals on critical hits, criticals do 50% more damage, and criticals refill 15% faster. For the right build this would be awesome. I suspect you will see a ton of good legendarys in people‚Äôs vendors in the coming days. Save your caps.
---
If you‚Äôre on ps4 message me I‚Äôll build you some gangster armor and a gun it‚Äôll help.  Some rando hooked me up when I was like lvl 15 I‚Äôve been paying it back every chance I can when I‚Äôve got the extra materials.  This goes for anyone else having trouble

Make Fallout Great Again
---
Same here. I'll come back when Wastelanders drops. But only till Cyberpunk comes out in April.
---
I never said I wouldn't buy another Bethesda game again. What are you talking about?
---
Another one that is a little more easy to follow:

It's a tiny bit outdated, some of the areas are a little easier now then they were when this was made, but it's fairly accurate.
---
You need to bulk your junk in order to sell it to vendors. Just the junk you can bulk (lead, cloth, acid etc). You could still sell things like circuits, asbestos, silver scrap etc, on their own.
---
Stay in the Forest, Toxic Valley, and Ash Heap
---
Oh okay, thanks
---
If I see a SB near my camp I just server hop right then and there. They can't hurt me but they can ruin my camp in the few seconds it takes to kill them.
---
Not too worried about that anymore. They have test servers coming soon (what could possibly go wrong haha)! But that should address the aforementioned problem. But that all ties into how they're just taking way too long to address the serious issues that people playing their product are facing. Public Test Servers should have been here before the raid was released; lots of people would still have their gear today if so.
---
Scrip machine for our camp.
---
Bed 2 people can sleep in at the same time.
---
A robot that collects nearby legendarys. 
---
Gun mods that change weapons amo type.
---
Damn right. You should‚Äôve seen the grin I had when I saw how much lead I ended up with.
---
They have an in-game shop where you can purchase currency with usd. They're **ALWAYS** selling Fallout 76. Hence the coming changes to the Atomic Shop mentioned in the most recent Inside the Vault.
---
Since it's apparently a pretty good, might look to trade for something decent, if not, I'll probably sell
---
I played more than just one week... I played it for 3-4 months and finally abandoned it when the sum total of glitches became overwhelming. Some weren't even glitches - they were inexcusable stupidity.
---
Their servers would shut down and start bugging very hard at 2am on Saturdays every single week. If that was for scheduled maintenance, why not have it at 4am on Wednesdays? Why weekends?.. 
---
Add to that the corrupted save files, the blatant cheating that they wouldn't deal with, etc... This game was a dumpster-fire when it first launched, and it stayed that way *long* after the first week.
---
Materials are very common in low level areas.
---
No. Its going to be dedicated servers which is the same thing as now but you get to control who is allowed in.
---
You see, I cant kill a SB in a few seconds because I dont have a weapon to do that and right now im low on ammo so I really didnt have any other choice. Specially with 2 SB.
---
There is not much people left. No new content for another 6 months. People just leave. P2w in atom shop? Do Whatever you want with your dying game, bethesda
---
Bugs are much better, stability is much better‚Äîbut both still need some work. 
---
New areas are beautifully designed, the world does feel like it has more going on. 
---
There‚Äôs a lot more to do now for new players, but still nothing really new for high level and veterans. It desperately needs new content that scales to player level. It doesn‚Äôt take that long to power level a character, making 2/3rds of the map irrelevant pretty quickly. 
---
Collecting legendaries through a glorified slot machine isn‚Äôt an endgame. It‚Äôs a cheap Skinner Box mechanic and in this case is more often disappointing than rewarding because the loot pool is awful‚Äîthere‚Äôs at least 10 pieces of useless gear for every reasonably good one. It‚Äôs great that we can get powerful weapons, but for what purpose? I can kill scorchbeasts pretty easily with a level 1 pipe rifle with my build. Legendaries don‚Äôt really matter at all without consequential content.
---
You forgot to mention RDR2 for PC :)
---
IMO 4 and 5 star items will lower the demand and the cost for 3 star items. But given how OP some weapons already are they'd have to create high level servers otherwise it's pointless. Seriously we can already one shot most enemies right now.
---
yeah and furry deathclaws! ;)
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt get why we are surprised.
---
Lots of good ideas, but I haven't seen this one on here yet.  Go to Pt. Pleasant (low level area) and find the mothman statue. Around the statue are mothman eggs. Take as many as you can and cook them into Mothman Egg Omelettes. It only takes wood along with the eggs to do it. They sell for quite a bit to the vendors (and even more if you have the Hard Bargain perk!)
---
Wow, what a creative and accurate post this is. Its not at all a totally false attention grab.
---
There are no real consequences to dying,remember that.
---
Use your Stash box before attempting to go in to a hostile environment.
---
You die,re-spawn without loss.
---
Good Doggy Perk is also [handy to have.Dog](https://handy.Dog) food acts like a Stim-Pack restoring Health.
---
Dog food is prevalent in this game.
---
Hmm, I‚Äôll definitely check this out. Thanks man, especially for providing a method that a low level player can do! :)
---
Contact the Brotherhood. These abominations must be purged with Fire!
---
All I really want to know is if that location that I choosed has a spawn of Scorchedbeasts.
---
After you do the quest to get into the enclave bunker, you can buy them in there. With perks they cost 17,500 caps, but you can make your money back pretty quick. Start with marsupial.
---
I‚Äôd genuinely be down, if not Actual furry deathclaws then some sort of furred creature that resembles them
---
It's great, but it's recently gone a step down instead of up. The game originally put me to sleep sometimes and I actually mean that, that was before the updates started in March. I would actually fall asleep playing, of course I was a solo player back then. I think the perfect amount of content was right after Arktos released and me and my group were able to do the triumvirate of events: Project Paradise, Encryptid, and Scorched Earth. After the change to public events, it felt really slow again. Now with Meat Week and Primal cuts, a high level event every fifteen minutes felt great and full. Now with no holiday events the game feels slow *again*. We're back to making our own fun, not that that's bad, but this game needs consistent updates
---
Couldn't agree more in how Fallout 76 is basically one big experiment. I don't think they ever actually had a direction post-launch; it was just handed off to Bethesda Austin. 
---
Nuclear Winter stuck and it stuck hard though... They had full lobbies, a huge wave of new players, one of the top streamers on Twitch broadcasting their game again, and more importantly people LOVED it! What more could you ask for? :(
---
I log in get my daily scrip and caps then log out. Maybe do a few runs for legendaries or check player vendors otherwise not much to do. 
---
I already have great end game gear but I'm still trying to get a good legendary fixer. So far no luck. 
---
Basically I'm just killing time until wastelanders comes out.
---
Does having multiple characters also get you the chance to repeat certain challenges?
---
I brought down a ghoul sentry at ranger office the other day lol crafty bastard almost got me good thing I heard that sound
---
No problem - if you want to sell I'm available.
---
Having trouble placing display shelf, even with a rug. I love this trailer but it‚Äôs sure buggy. Any workaround for placing display shelves?
---
I agree but be careful getting the titanium for it - you can go to Welch for mole miner suit scrap, but they swarm you, you will die quickly at level 25 unless you are a good sniper from the railroad station and can hide well.  Alternately, Gorge Junkyard west of Morgantown has a spot to mine ore, but you might get attacked for PvP, so make sure you aren't carrying any scrap you don't want to lose, and take the ore out of the miner constantly, in case you get taken over by a higher level player and can't reclaim the workshop or fight back for it.  I got nailed by a stealth character out of the blue there once, trying to mine the titanium, and stupid me was carrying some titanium scrap which I lost, making the time wasted.  You need 3 pieces of ore to make 2 pieces of titanium scrap, and 36 titanium scraps to make a full suit, btw.
---
yours is probably gonna top everyone else, not gonna lie.
---
What sucks is our build budget, i have a lot of atomic items and cant even display them
---
I'm in this general area, by Twin Lakes. I've had it happen once. It was rough. I have a hard time killing them because my weapons are trash but they destroyed my camp &amp; wouldn't land. It hasn't happened since, that was at least a month ago. 
---
I don't know what triggers it but it doesn't seem common.
---
We'd have almost enough end game content if they gave us back Project Paradise whenever we wanted. Maybe introduced v96 raids. Right now it's just Nuke Silos/Queens, Encryptid, and v94 raids. What kind of content are you wanting? Maybe a dungeon like the ones we already have (West Tek, Burrows, Arktos Chasm) but bigger/longer with a guaranteed legendary enemy?
---
i guess trade makes it harder, make an offer for caps
---
Servers are better, but the in game bugs are still plentiful. I've just accepted them as the BGS experience and play the game.
---
Forest.  Toxic valley.  Ash Heap.  Savage divide.  The Mire.  Then cranberry bog/watoga.
---
I don't use my mic anymore either really, but I have my headphones in at night so I don't bother my girlfriend while she sleeps, and for better directional audio. So every once in a while I end up interacting with someone. Mostly people who need help because they just took off from the forest and ended up in the mire at level 6 are who I end up audio chatting with
---
They literally nerfed half the map to make it more accessible to lower level players, your gonna hate that when you level up
---
Also, wood is easier to come by if you have the Woodchucker perk. You can get up to 16 pcs at a time. 
---
Later on, another good perk to take is the Super Duper perk. At level 3 of the perk, you have a great chance of doubling whatever it is you are crafting!
---
These are all perks that have helped me level up and gain caps. I'm level 103 now. If you are on Xbone, feel free to look me up "phinfan007"
---
You can get titanium scrap from junkyard workshop in the forest.
---
I don't think they can fix it.
---
This is a single player engine that they jury rigged into an online game.   A lot of the stuff they need for decent security isn't in the base code.    So they have to tack everything onto it.
---
And even cheating happens on games that were setup from the get go to be online massive players shooters, etc.
---
It's like they have a dodge pinto they are trying to make into a van.    Sure, you can do it, but it's going to be underpowered and fucked up.
---
Bethesda is more likely to use dedicated servers, many reasons why
---
Bethesda already has a large consistant cash flow coming to them from the atomic shop, which lets be real here, they would only want you to use atomic shop items, ulities (repair kits and scrap kits) etc for public servers only. Bethesda comfirmed mod support in the near future after private servers release, this means the community will have full access to mod their own dedicated server and release it on the nexus mod page which by looking at the system of the game, you would need to download and install required mods to play on someone elses server (with their permission of course). Mods that alter the private server would give no use to the atomic shop for that game mode, which is comfirmed by leaked pictures of the new private server mode. You would have to log in with your bethesda account to access the menu which therefore means all character data is saved on their master server which you would have to fetch to use on your private server, which is where the payment comes in. Payment isn't going to be monthly, I believe that you will just have to pay a large cost once to get access to all the game files to play the game on your own machine, and bethesda would still have control over your character which you would fetch to use on that said 'server'.
---
 Conclusion:  Bethesda has already learn't their leason when it comes to not being greedy, and with mod support on the way, we must conclude that bethesda will use dedicated servers to allow mod support to function and let the community tamper with local their own local world(s) while bethesda takes ownership of character data which enforces the paywall.
---
It's a con job, by the time people figure out the game is broken they have already given Bethesda some money. Then they just move on to the next sucker.
---
Fuck no, we just finished that a couple of weeks ago
---
Would be really incredible if they refunded players who bought the protectron then sold customizations for it via the atom shop.  Of course they wouldn't do that.  Or add a Mr. Handy via a quest then sold customizations for that via the shop.  Of course they wouldn't do that either.  It's all gotta be through the shop.
---
It's not the first time someone has asked me if I have a dog. Just the first time someone stopped mercing me to ask about my dog and then spare me. I can't understand the psychology behind it but hey, I didn't lose a couple hundred pounds of junk so I was happy lol
---
One guy called his PvP group after my team's Encryptid last night. He had me on mute and was making stuff up to his discord raider group saying that I stole scrip he dropped for his teammate lolol. I left the team because I have a guy in my group who really enjoys PvP and he even had to fib about how many times he team wiped us
---
Yeah im pretty sure they were trying to have a bit of fun with you and you took it too seriously
---
I tried it, saw what was going on and never again.
---
Hacks are a silly way of ruining the game. Maybe some people do it to collect atoms, because they like griefing... Who knows.
---
Some peoples' mountain dew fueled children, amiright?
---
These are the dark levels. You don‚Äôt have the gear, perks and things you need to compete and you keep wandering into areas where higher level guys are pushing the spawns to be much higher level than you.
---
Best advice I can give:
---
1/ Adventure more in the left / top areas of the map. Explore, do the side quests. Do events when you can, but gravitate back to the top left.
---
2/ Don‚Äôt worry about repairing - learn plans and craft new. Repairing is going to be even more expensive.
---
3/ Post your platform ... someone is likely to help ;-)
---
The problem is their prices.  700 atoms for the fridge is ridiculous.  Buying $10 worth of atoms gets you 1100 atoms and so that 700 atoms would cost you like $6.36.  That's stupid.
---
&gt; Good thing bringing Terraria up, that's exactly why we don't want user hosted servers, where is the fun if you can log into a server and give yourself the best weapons, and then go back and ruin everyone else fun? Because that's how I recall terraria multiplayer was.
---
Yes, that was what I was saying with mods, if you give players control over how the game works *players should not be able to switch from server to server.*
---
&gt; Every free Minecraft/terraria/GTA server is P2P, in Wich the host can set the rules and if the host go offline the world goes offline, and they are not free! Someone is either paying a rent to a third party host or paying the electric bill in their houses.
---
Yes, however the thing with self hosting is not that it is necessarily free, but the ability, or the software, to do so is free, leaving the bar generally fairly low.
---
&gt; FO76 are going to be rented servers. Right now , when you hit "Adventure mode" it takes you to a server that Bethesda itself is renting to Amazon cloud Services, when the privates servers go online I'm pretty sure is going to be the same thing, except that you would join the world alone and you would be able to invite/ban people,
---
Yeah they're all rented servers, no shit, oh wow, bethesda's private service will be paid for, wow.
---
&gt; and since they basically are going to be just another server with the same Bethesda game rules, you are going to be able to use the same characters in either private or public servers.
---
Until they add mod support.
---
&gt; Is not that hard to understand then, that if Bethesda would gave a private server for free to each one of us they would need to pay around 1 dollar per hour of use to amazon(I don't know the exact price they pay), at that point it would be more profitable to them to just shut down everything.
---
See "Yeah they're all rented servers, no shit, oh wow, bethesda's private service will be paid for, wow"
---
&gt; Why is so hard to people to understand such a simple concept?
---
Exactly.
---
On PS4 everyone I know uses PlayStation chat, because in game chat is super buggy. I don't want to take the time to drop out of my team's chat in order to fumble with the wierd in game toggle between team and stuff. Just at use emotes, flashing pip-light, and the hilarious squat/tea-bagging dance to communicate.
---
I think a difficult long dungeon would be perfect for solo play. The dungeons we have now aren't difficult. Maybe if we didn't all have overpowered gear but that's the reality now. We could have:
---
Dungeons for solo playing
---
Raids for group playing
---
Events for public playing
---
&gt;killallcasuals
---
You're welcome to son...
---
I want a Assaultron Jack-O-Latern
---
That's funny, because you weren't there, but you'd 100 percent know for sure that him calling me an indoctrinated cunt because I wouldn't answer his question is me "taking it too seriously". If you want to go back over my entire story for a more accurate feel on the encounter I would encourage it. He was dead serious about his questions bub, plain and simple.
---
Some people would rather play alone anyways, like that was one of the main complaints since it was revealed 76 would be an mmo.
---
Oh, to be clear the mutations recipes are 17,500 not the mutations. You will need 1 stable flux for each mutation. If you don't do them scorched beast queen, or farm flux, you can usually buy it from other people.
---
This attitude is obnoxious. And it's the reason developers are going to flat out ignore real criticism down the road. Developers are not beholden to your every whiney complaint and desire. If you don't like what they do with their product, leave. Creators don't owe their audience anything. On the flip side, their audience can choose at any time to leave.
---
They need to adjust difficulty. Because with top build like bloodied, challenge is almost 0. So a new area map with very high difficulty would be interesting.
---
They also should up unplayable build like berseker or gun etc. Because the meta is almost 100% bloodied. It's also an economical game issue. 1% of weapons are priceless/ultra rare and 99% are just garbage.
---
I keep losing turrets on my base for no reason.
---
‚ÄúGreat game‚Äù? When exactly did this game ever meet standards?
---
You wouldn‚Äôt do a 30 (+/- 10 min) minute quest to get a fridge - if - that‚Äôs what you really enjoy in game? 
---
You‚Äôd rather just pay to sit in your camp - then literally play Fallout?
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt buy this rationale just like that damn fridge.
---
Everytime ive had a SB attack it was in the south.  Moved my camp into the mire.  Not a peep since.
---
Hey. You on PS4? I will show you a bunch of cap farming methods, how to set up a player vendor, and heck. I have too many caps. I will literally just straight up give some to you want to help start your empire of cap farming lol.
---
Dam. I like my camp location because it has a lot of minerals nearby and I farm Copper there.. if im attacked more im gonna move since I cant handle SB every single hour.
---
I think you know what I mean. If mods are released I would love to play them without having to pay for a private server. Plus such a system limits the amount of mods that would even be made, modders are less motivated to publish a mod that wont be played as much, compared to say a Fallout 4 mod.
---
Damn, that‚Äôs the nicest offer I‚Äôve gotten on this sub.
---
I‚Äôm on xbox though, but do you think you can still give me some farming tips?
---
Fo76map.com can help you find a new spot with a node you need.
---
Right than, thanks for the help.
---
My point is that we're not paying a monthly fee or even for dlcs packs. It's just the atom system for things that are purely aesthetic. The fridge isn't necessary at all, there are perk cards that help with food waste and food is literally everywhere. Complaining about it at this point is silly. 
---
My only complaint so far is my legendary kills bugging out like 50-100 feet away and I want a robot companion like ED-E. But then again I just like to role play as a mad scientist, everything else is a bonus.
---
They recently capped the level of enemies in the Toxic Valley, Ash Heap and around the Top of the World. Stop rushing the game and level up on the left side of the map.
---
If you feel healing items are scarce, forget stimpacks and make hundreds of Forest's healing salve, they are ridiculously easy to craft and work as diluted stims. They even share the stims hotkey, so it's super easy to use them.
---
And plan your build before it's too late, I started at level 39 and now at 155 I still lack a few cards for my secondary weapon.
---
5K?
---
Ffs it's a computer game..get a grip
---
Lots of people do feed the people because it has a few rare drop outfits. The responders firefighter outfit is the most sought.
---
Well let's just be clear the Fallout Tactics Armor is the Armor from Fallout 3 that the Enclave wears. When Fallout 3 was coming out, the developers stated that they took a lot of influence from the previous games to include ones they knew fans didn't fully consider canon and with those "non-canon" assets they took some liberties.
---
Glowing meat over dog food. 10% melee buff.
---
$5 to call in a supply drop each crafting station is $6
---
It‚Äôs easy to see why tbh
---
You cannot pet the dog, unfortunately.
---
Yeah, a month is a while. I considered it progress in my own game. I really hope they update this system soon.

He just vanished. No corpse or anything.

which by the way speaking of fast the meat hook damage calcs really don't stack up to +40% power bloodied unarmed fully but go off lol.  comparatively, killing a sheepsquatch in 10 hits is a lot more than when i can do it in 1 or 2

if you know what you were talking about you'd have known about this lmfao

I love the ones who try to trade with you and you refuse so they try to attack

AWOL Armaments counted just fine for me wearing a Red Dress and White Wolf Fedora.

If you're leaving I'll take all your gear homie

It's trick and highly stipulated. But you need animal friend and the right random spawn location. There are guides on Reddit and YouTube I recommend you watching that do a better job explaining it than I can.
---
Hmm I'm not sure. I just tested it and it seemed to work for me with the rug trick. Did you make sure it was on the rug before you moved it?
---
Glad I was helpful making you understand why this couldn't be a free service
---
Sadly most battle royale games are breached and full of people cheating, especially ESP. There‚Äôs a couple groups who literally make a living off selling cheats. They ruined Crysis and more recently Hunt: Showdown and Elysium.
---
I have no idea why anyone would be so self concious of losing in a game they‚Äôd pay 20$ a month just to cheat.
---
 Quite simply love is for those who will further your genetic expression. Hate is for those that oppose it.

By lvl 20 you‚Äôll be swimming in health items. Just play normally and you‚Äôll be fine.
---
I mean no I don‚Äôt just sit in my camp.  But thanks for the snide remark.  I have plenty of other things to do in the meantime, the least of which is run around doing errands which don‚Äôt benefit my business.  I have plenty of atoms from daily challenges I don‚Äôt really need to ‚Äúpay‚Äù in the sense of real dollars and cents. 
---
You have your way you like to play and that‚Äôs cool.  I hope you enjoy it.  But I have mine and doing side quests all the time for camp items seems like a waste of time for me.  I mean I‚Äôve never even finished the main quest and I only go up in rank because of the harvesting and crafting of goods and supplies.
---
Gross.
---
Perfectly Preserved Pie isn't very rare.
---
It's not single player game so... Mods are not going to be what you think. Of course you're not going to get to play any game changing mods without being in your own shard.
---
Also mods do exist and have been fine since launch
---
Seriously. Hate that they‚Äôre ruining Fallout
---
No need to demand proof as if I'm an unreasonable loon who is pushing disinfo.
---
Did some researching and you are correct as far as current gen goes (though it hasn't been done yet does not mean its impossible). I haven't been in the console loop for sometime as I have been on PC since 2009, so I just assumed this gen had the similar "jailbreaking" capabilities.
---
Network manipulation, modified controllers, and general exploits are still present and they can be just as bad as mods. For example most of the players walking around with what seems like God mode is a glitch. I know the original post I commented on was specifically about hacking but lots of players label cheaters of all kinds as "hacker" even if that is incorrect its roughly the same issue and arguably more common.

I wasn‚Äôt recording at the time but I got chased by a foot with a health bar.
