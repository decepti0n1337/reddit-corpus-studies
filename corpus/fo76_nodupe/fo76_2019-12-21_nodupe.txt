We don‚Äôt need to get into religion. I was making a joke. We are talking about Charlie Brown.
---
---
---
I almost gave up at 500 because I wanted to open them so bad! Lol.
---
Patch 9 may 7 is the explosive shot gun patch where they changed it to reduce its overall damage but they don't specify how the reduced the damage. I'm currently trying to find the info on the fix they explained that to reduce the damage the increased the pellets spread and reduced the weapons range the only issue is finding bethesda response cuse the spread info was data mine to fin its exact value
---
That's why I posted this challenge
---
Plus he could have a lot of utility in finding your dropped loot or pesky legendaries.
---
It‚Äôs happened to me a handful of times with horde bosses.  Not just the ground, but they‚Äôll get stuck in walls.  Sometimes they glitch back out if you leave and keep an eye on the map to see if the horde moved.  Travel back and they‚Äôll be walking down the road.
---
Melee isn't so bad as long as you don't mind pressing your face up against the queen's scrote-sack.
---
Haha OK. I will watch some Charlie Brown on YouTube and see what it's all about.
---
Or underground...
---
Hey hey I still have mine and use it when I‚Äôm low on other ammo cause I still find a shit ton of 10mm
---
Happened to me too, I had to unlink my account then relink it before the rewards showed up
---
I don't think we're necessarily disagreeing. I agree that there is a reticle/camera angle discrepancy, but I think it's a third person problem that is most noticeable with melee combat, rather than a melee-only problem that has nothing to do with third person. Because you're right, melee would be almost impossible in first person.
---

---
The only reason I wanted to add anything to the discussion is that it's hard to fix a problem that is ill-defined. If you tell Bethesda "fix this melee problem" and the source of the problem is the third party camera, finding a melee problem might take a while. If you tell them there's a third party camera problem, at least they're on the right track. Likewise, if it's a melee problem and not a third party camera problem, I should shut up. Which do you think it is?
---
yeah I know about the explosive nerf, it went from 100% to 20% and in the case of shotguns (iirc) it was broken out from "per pellet" to total damage which was a massive net nerf.
---
Range I don't remember being nerfed but I could easily have missed it or forgotten about it.
---
Notifications are gone but you still get the rewards in most cases
---
Cool story, Ricky.
---
[removed]
---
Believe what you will. When the game does what all Bethesda games do when you hoard materials, then we'll know. Oh wait, it already has been.
---
I followed the link from Bethesda‚Äôs site to twitch, linked my accounts, but have yet to see anything appear in my atom shop or camp menus. Did I potentially miss a step? (PS4 as well)
---
I still remember their name, I just found it sad that it happened.
---
Check the atom shop to redeem.
---
Santy baby ive been a really really good girl
---
I'm so glad I am not the only one dealing with A-holes taking my stuff outta the santatron. Like it's free, everyone gets one. 
---
I gave someone a bobblehead off my bobblehead stand so they could complete their collection. No payment, like....if ya ask I'll help. I role play as a giving helpful survivor. If I pass you camp I take nothing unless you are selling it. And if I see stuff broken, I'll repair it no questions asked. T-T
---
Gamer tag is ASHURII NIKOORU if y'all ever pass me.
---
There‚Äôs a recent bug that has caused them to not report rewards. Easy way to check is under Misc see how many Mr Fuzzy tokens you have before and after. I‚Äôve been getting my tokens each time even though it‚Äôs not telling me.
---
Give him some cranberry relish, have him take a nap. Buy him a marsupial serum, and if you're really thoughtful a couple of grape nukas to remove rads w/ out getting rid of mutation. Have him hop up on the canopy in front of the golf club, and rain down grenades on all the lvll 48 and 62 ghouls then kill said ghouls. When they are all dead have him hide some distance from the golf club, make sure no one else is there, little g out and back, thus respawning all the ghouls. Do this 3 times, he will be level 20ish, with some choices on his build. Leader bobblehead is extra XP.  Find him a good legendary to use and make sure he has ammo. Release him on the he Wastelandüëç
---
The search feature is good for that. Eventually people stop responding to repeat questions or they take a wild guess on a new post when an existing post may have been thoroughly discussed and solved.
---
Do you mean [these](https://imgur.com/nvBHGHj)? Because id really like to know what these are
---
But so far I have zero that want to challenge it they just shout NUCLEAR WINTER but they are mistaken on the cause of the challenge
---
Aah, makes sense. I just really don't want to pay full price for what I already have on PC and PS4.
---
They should at least do cross platform play.
---
I linked my account and checked a day or two later. Go to your CAMP build menu, then beds, then scroll through your sleeping bags. That's the easiest way to check. I'm not sure that it even shows up in the Atomic Shop.
---
I thought the int boost was capped at 25?
---
I am curious, how much xp did you get when killing specific enemies?
---
Well considering the case with Ripcord and all the other crap that goes on this game i would say it's sadly an Ill-definitive case of both being problematic.  I think too many things are going awry to truly say what is going wrong at any given moment. 
---
The third person straight up being ass doesn't help, at the same time there is clearly issues with hit detection dropping contact.  So both. My answer is both lol. 
---
By the way i appreciate the discussion.
---
So I have zero challengers it's mainly remorse I feel for PVP bulknwholes is always here for a challenge see you soon
---
That will teach you hooligans.
---
But do you have cookies and milk?
---
I didn't ask anything, that was someone else. Anyway, the chart clearly shows that handmade gifts have better chances than gifts dropped by scorched/Santatrons. If you read the chart, this should be quite clear.
---
I actually know the two people who made he chart. We're all in the same dataminining group. I'm very familiar with the methods they used to make it. There's absolutely no question that the drop rates are different.
---
It wasent specified but was found out as a secret patch they didnt like how they tweeked food spoilied in the same patch then made it worse
---
Thats what i call them, yes
---
I don't know man, my turrets dislike my house, they keep shooting into the walls all the time. It's annoying as well.
---
And getting slap under the map sometimes
---
U sir are not invited to this conversation I couldn't think of a single reason anyone would care about that weak comment accept my challenge or go away
---
Lol
---
The Hunter Long Coat? It's just a pain in the ass to farm it, but it's one of the only rare outfits that can be farmed consistently.
---
Well the power armor video is from two months ago. I actually made a post about it. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dl2y86/max_hp_possible_in_nuclear_winter/
---
It was before the stealth boy and polehook update. Back then Grog and assault blade were the best available. 
---
The other videos are much more recent taking place after the update that touched on melee and stealthboys. 
---
I had not heard of the Power armor bug and that is interesting.  But from my experience there is a noticeable difference between the grog axe back then to the grog axe now.  So the polehook/supersledge were not just additions but melee itself was tweaked for them to be added. 
---
I actually made a post about it at the time.  And you can even see a time line in my posts as i discovered the stealth nerf.
---
 Heres a link to that:

These before the stealth nerf as i talk about the damage they new melee weapons do which were INSANE. To bad they didn't last. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dno0ib/how_is_melee_doing_in_nw/f5qyyvd/
---
And here's my post after i noticed the change in damage.
---
Fuck a duck... That is bananas!!
---
You going to open them? or sell/trade and get your 700k caps (and then some) back?
---
My rewards showed up nearly instantly.
---
I had to link from Bethesda to Twitch AND from Twitch to Bethesda.
---
Good luck
---
That‚Äôs the one!
---
It was for a while, til more people figured out how to farm for it. 
---
It's still pretty valuable as far as outfits go, I sold one in my vendor the other day for 4k.
---
It's just much easier to get than some of the other rare outfits.
---
Yes, I always wondered why that isnt already a Legendary effect. Or at least be able to find a 3* perfect storm from the purveyor once youve completed the cold case quest.
---
Not sure why I'm getting downvoted either and I don't really care about Reddit points but that is nice of you.  If you take the time to plan your build ahead it definitely helps in the end.
---
Yeah I would just unlink and link again. May not be necessary but i waited longer than the 30 minutes recommended before the rewards pop up. Also like someone else stated they won't be a atop shop item it will just go directly in the build or craft menu.
---
You probably wont have stash room to open them al but good luck.. lol
---
Ya no, it's not that rare to be honest.
---
I recognize your tag. You're on PS4 aren't you?
---
Yep I built mine into my generator room and the back in on water so generally not going to have things attacking from that side so I‚Äôm good :) cause someone skulking around my camp almost as soon as I logged on tonight looking for Santa.
---
I‚Äôm so sorry about your pupper. I hope we get some dogmeat content soon.
---
Oh God fair answer ngl
---
Huh, I haven't had that thrill yet.
---
What time zone? I‚Äôm down
---
I love that movie! Football? What's a foot ball?
---
Internal account storage across characters for those above mentioned items would be great. I‚Äôd love an armored backpack for my bloodied guy. 
---
I don‚Äôt even want to speculate on that sort of thing, because there‚Äôs many QoL things that could make the game better.
---
I'm in Florida
---
Yep, mine linked seamlessly.  I am on PC.
---
I have the same problem.
---
No, XB1. Sorry
---
That‚Äôs great to hear. I‚Äôm hoping for a black variant. I‚Äôve also seen some data mines that‚Äôve shown a free states version of the scout armor.
---
Ah, my colleague, inspector of bushes.
---
I leveled 1-50 just by tagging whitespring nuke ghouls in 2 days before they nerfed xp
---
I'm leaning toward the Ripcord issue being an exception rather than the rule. You were able to thirst the other guy a couple of seconds earlier, so it wasn't a repeatable event even within a few seconds.
---
Also, being a melee build is one of the few guaranteed ways to not die to a nuke. With Run for Your Knife, you can be dead center of a nuke and still manage to escape by a couple of seconds.
---
I am on now
---
Kill mr.handys, they drop the bp
---
So do you go on every post and make a 3rd person comment about the enclave in regards to the OP? Nice RP right there
---
500 caps is waaaaaay too much tho
---
There are certain elements for sure, but npcs waiting for you to leave at the entrance does feel like a plot hole. They could be set up at the overseers camp or flatwoods. Hell a starter quest could‚Äôve sent you to investigate their location. It does feel a tad lazy to just say they‚Äôre waiting for you out the door
---
 I agree with this
---
Sounds "Strong"
---
Wierd though, mabey a weap that was staggering you, then a dif weap dropped?
---
There you go, then you'll really be unyielding.
---
No, XB1. Sorry!
---
Nvmnd you said one shotting.
---
Often what an NPC drops is not actually their usable inventory.  You sometimes see this if you run right up to an NPCs loot right as you kill them, there's a brief flicker and some items might vanish or change, particularly in regards to ammunition and grenades.
---
Yeah, unless your gear is terrible that shouldn't happen. With your damage reduction in mind, he would have to do like 1k damage per shot. Maybe he had an instigating gun and maxed rifle perks. Lol.
---
Oh yea for sure. I kinda proved that with [this](https://streamable.com/d3459) video.  Just in this specific instance with Ripcord i was more concerned with dealing with this weird bug and getting a capture on my xbox.  After all was said and done i just accepted my fate with 5 seconds left on the clock. 
---
As far as it being an exception rather than a rule.  I know where you're coming from and believe me i would love to agree with you but sadly i have encountered this inability to kill a downed enemy with melee literally dozens of times. This was just the only instance where i recorded it because i wasn't shamefully killed why trying desperately to kill the downed person.
---
Lvl 68 *3 super mutant behemoth would they hit really hard
---
I believe so.
---
If they do drop from the gift boxes, I was thinking around 6000 caps since that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve got right now after blowing mine on gift wrap.  I‚Äôd be willing to part with 15k once the event is over...  maybe more if the vending prices are higher.  Or I can easily trade 20k 5.56 for it.
---
Hey, I‚Äôve at least got a banana duct taped to a wall here!
---
And in further news, the orbital grenades are not counted as explosives for some reason and do not benefit from ordinance Express... thanks Bethesda. So before you mass craft 100 of them like me, make sure you have the room.
---
Is the second batch out?
---
Rewards are released each day on 7 PM ET. Today's reward is christmas wrapping paper skin.  
---
However you have to complete the previous one to unlock it as available challenge.  
---
And they are visible under Challenges -&gt; Character while in NW more.
---
Pshhh like 3 caps
---
Don‚Äôt forget the steel book for our cardboard discus
---
Check player vendors too. If I pick up a PA mod I sell them for 25c.
---
None of those are 1H melee weapons.
---
500 scrip? You can get 600 in 4 days.
---
At the very LEAST let us level them up similarly to how the mistress of mystery gear can be upgraded at a workbench! Every 10 levels would be nice, and they could increase the amount of scrap required to craft it, so we have more reason to loot junk besides just selling it off.
---
Not the point. It is a cool utilitarian outfit that stinks of "immersive". One of my favorites.
---
I‚Äôd be curious how many mothman, mutant hound, icicle and Santa crash plans you get.
---
it is a legacy weapon, so cap wise it is probably beyond max caps, you will probably get a good trade out of it to the right collector/trader.
---
*any tips to level up a new toon quickly?*
---
I found a level 5 VE 10mm so this would be great lmao
---
You can buy the plan at watoga for 2000 caps
---
Did you ever get your handmade repaired?

The "Hello" emote in the Holiday Emotes is a Dogmeat with reindeer horns put on his head. Very cute!
---
Sure thing, Rickster. You going to figure it out through denial and error?
---
just as every dog named Rover isn't the same dog, every german shepard named dogmeat also can be a unique german shepard named dogmeat.  
---
In other words, they can give us dogmeat.
---
Most likely.
---
I had to re-link the accounts twice (PC) but then I got the stuff immediately.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ed8gl1/nukashine_mr_fuzzy_ride_broken_game/

nope! the search continues
---
craft him max lvl armor fully modded.  a lvl 5 heavy leather armor set with studded mod on all pieces is god mode for a lvl 5 character.
---
You figure out the exact name?
---
Your friend is a liar. You can't get inside of Vault 79. You can ride the Elevator to the Vault Door but that is as far as anyone has gone.
---
You‚Äôre a maniac! I like it!!
---
Thanks for the advice
---
There are many Magazines for it, not sure why you are not learning them, but it has one of the largest available for a rifle with the stinging mag.
---
Well let's just put it this way im lvl 50 but lvl 10 ghouls are a big issue and I rarely have ammo
---
Absolutely and it is what they should do with every unique legendary going forward and should retroactively add it to the older ones.
---
The skull mask has been out for a few months now
---
Yep, just had to log out and back in, everything was available.
---
It was easy to miss since it just landed in the Atom shop stuff.
---
SCRRRRIIIPPPP
---
Thanks I think I'm gonna make a rifleman build but knowing me I'm gonna have 12 guns from all levels and no room for ammo
---
At worst it is easy scrip, not sure what level you are but at higher levels and well equipped SBs become pretty trivial to take down.
---
I'm level 160 and main in rifles and unarmed.
---
It's scrip, you can use it to buy legendarys from the Purveyor at Berkeley Springs train station.
---
&gt;Not the point.
---
I don't think OP was wondering about whether you subjectively like the outfit or not lol.
---
Pretty sure they asked if it was still considered a rare spawn and thus desirable because of its rarity.
---
Doesn't matter how cool it looks, the Red asylum dress is the most valuable outfit in the game and it looks ridiculous. It's valuable because of its **rarity**.
---
It's cool with me, i'm just going to stay logged in on my desktop and wifes laptop for a good chunk of time and collect what i can lol.
---
I've had people shoot me.....it still shows them wanted
---
Ngl, I legitimately thought this was the Elder Scrolls Blades subreddit until I read a comment about a ‚Äòlegendary 10mm smg‚Äô.
---
No it's not. People say that, but I assure you it isn't.
---
That‚Äôs just nukashine being broken.
---
Brilliant. No, really.
---
I mean, Liberty Prime WAS destroyed in the Broken Steel DLC of Fallout 3, but they repaired it. They could reason that in the next game the Brotherhood put it back together (maybe using parts from Liberty Prime for symbolism and so LP becomes the Prydwyn's AI pilot or some shit)
---
Both of them?
---
They could make a special item drop but at a very low rate that lets you upgrade it
---
Yes. It‚Äôs not 3 separate packages, they all just get added as craftable once you  link accounts and claim reward.
---
Player icon shows up in atom shop. That‚Äôs how I checked.
---
Is there a second batch? That‚Äôs news to me.
---
Two possibilities come to mind. 
---
Role playing:  Pick a theme and have build a camp on that theme and dress up appropriately.  There was a thread here recently about a drive through restaurant that was very cool and last week I stumbled across an amazing pirate ship with the owner suitably attired.
---
Welcome new players:  Built a camp near vault 76 and welcome newer players, help outfit them and teach them the game.
---
RISE OF THE SCRIP!
---
You on PS4?
---
Oh my god I didn‚Äôt lock mine bc I didn‚Äôt there was anything good so people could take stuff but OOPS
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm pretty sure the disco ball in the rad toad is nothing too unique, but I haven‚Äôt seen anyone meshing the others together.
---
Check your settings, their is an option to show names.
---
Awesome!
---
Except people on the community already know how to build gunslinger, it's just a less effective VATS build. These complaints are focused more on NON-VATS build and the changes would actually help in VATS. 
---
The point is that from what I gathered, Commando and Riflemen can do builds both in VATS and outside of VATS, Gunslinger doesn't have that choice save for the 10mm. Revolvers tend to end up lagging behind and must use crutches (legendaries) to continue onward. The entire point of the fixes is to allow gunslinger to work in both categories as well without slumping onto Legendaries (which is what happened to the shotgun family).
---
you can go to train stations, there will be a machine that broke all your legendary weapons for these scrips.
---
but only in one station called berkley there is an npc were you can give her these scrips for a rng roll of certain types of weapon or armor. You can broke your things until 150 scrips max per day.
---
... They actually do let you do that with items from the MoM questline.
---
They totally could.
---
I repent... the next day usually
---
As your spamming them open, remember to watch your caps and scrip so you don't max out. They can drop up to 1000 caps each.
---
I‚Äôm on PC
---
I‚Äôve definitely encountered a scorched ghoul, but it was only once and during scorched earth
---
I made a post about it before, but it seems losts of people are taking way more damage then usual and armor is breaking faster
---
Crazy! xD
---
Are the santa crash plans rare? I got some spares if your lookin to buy
---
Thanks Santa!
---
I think what you mean is I dropped those, thanks for finding them for me man!
---
In all seriousness, this must have not been easy or too fun after awhile. I applaud you, friend! Enjoy opening them, and watch your caps and scrip!
---
Nuclear winter got my new character leveled up pretty quick I started doing missions at level 35&amp; got the somerset special at that level which was a great start but the highest level you can get it at is 45, it should be like 60 for both, skip level 55‚Äôs and just make the highest level equal among alm weapons!
---
I would love to have higher lv weapons why stop at 50 gives as a reward for being 100+
---
Did you land an extra claw plan for the deathclaw gauntlet?  It‚Äôs the last plan I‚Äôd really like to get, and I‚Äôm not sure what size gift it comes from.  Given that I‚Äôve gotten dense armor plans and other previously super rare stuff from regular gifts, I wonder if I‚Äôm wasting caps on large presents.
---
How?
---
Have him run some quests and help him with that. He'll level up pretty quick, discover tons of locations, and get to kill a huge variety of things. If that doesn't get him into the Fallout spirit than this isn't a game for him.
---
What size? All sizes?
---
If you‚Äôre level 50 you‚Äôve put some effort into that character.   Start over if that‚Äôs what you really want, but nothing would make me want to play 30-45 again without supports. 
---
If level 10 ghouls are giving you trouble it‚Äôs your gear. You should be able to survive anything in groups of 5-10 for long enough to kill them with a crafted board and an excavator set of power armor (also crafted), even without mods.  Maybe it‚Äôs worth trying out power armor while you work on getting a decent melee weapon and move on to your preferred spec from there.
---
Yeah but you HAD to destroy Liberty Prime in Broken Steel. They could say that liberty prime was rebuilt either way in Fallout 4, but they couldn‚Äôt really say that about the prydwyn because anytime after fallout 4 with an institute victory the brotherhood would be crippled without the prydwyn, plus they lost most of their vertibirds. I‚Äôm just not sure how they could‚Äôve recovered liberty prime
---
Hey a level 25 BE gatling plasma does plenty of damage.
---
I know but for all u know they augmented the thing whenever they rereleased it. Or maybe ur not the only one complaining.
---
I want to know WHY, but the real question is why not?!
---
Haha no problem. Glad I could help and good luck in the bushes üòú
---
I think they should just remove leveled weapons and base all damage factors onto level instead of creating a pretty annoying requirement. It just sucks the fun out at lower levels to just consistently find useless items.
---
NPCs cheat. When I hit them 5 times, the first 4 times don't count so I get killed. You just have to get use to it like everything else. üòè
---
The premise is you emerge, there aren‚Äôt any people around, now you learn why there are no people around. 
---
If you walk out and people are right there, .... the entire premise as gone.
---
Of course I sat down with an hour to spare on knocking out this list and found Anne immediately in Watoga.
---
Thank you so much for this post.
---
Yeah .. I was robbing this guy, got 5 presents from my his Santa, he waves me over, he is a level 266, so I am thinking he is going to cap me for sure ... he drops two more presents for me .. he leaves and realizes I am wanted at his camp and sends me a message naughty naughty .. lol .. good guy ...
---
Or if there was a mine of sorts that helps them land
---
I got 3
---
I got mine, on PC. Don't care about anything except the combat shotgun skin, but it's pretty nice. The inner metallic parts like the barrel and the mag are gilded
---
I only have 8k caps and I dont really want to spend a big chunk for a large present. BUT I guess making 2 might be worth it with the Chemist Perk card equipped?  I have played this game since beta and am only level 113 and the caps are not something I have been easily obtaining. I used to sell halloween costumes for like 200 caps a piece until an update a few months ago, and now I've been struggling to make caps. I haven't found a single present or rare scorched and I want a damn present. I must have been naughty.
---
Power armour sucks balls. All day, every nite. Get rid of it....
---
No.
---
Waste O ‚Äò time....
---
It now produces 78% more bullshit. Guaranteed...
---
Really sorry to hear that.  I lost my dog Mason last summer, (not my choice, he came with the name) and it was pretty tough.  Him and my wife were especially close, so it was very tough on her, especially.  He had a good life, at least after he joined my pack.  I'm sure your dog did, too.  That's the best you can hope to give them.
---
I believe the rumor mill has it that there will be some sort of companion system coming with Wastelanders.  Dogmeat (or his ancestral equivalent) is a shoe-in.  I'd heard mention that he would be tied to the Raider faction, but it was nothing more than hearsay from some high level players after SBQ.  
---
Dogmeat has to be the most popular companion, by far.  He was the only one I never got sick of being with in Fo4, and was basically the face of the pre-release promotion for that game.  I really can't imagine that he won't show up in some form as the game grows and evolves.  Dogmeat is as iconic to the franchise as power armor.
---
Those are legendary Scrip you sell your Legendary Weapons to the legendary vendor at every train station, once you have enough you can buy a legendary from the vendor at Berkeley Springs station
---
Sounds like flakey Internet or bad wifi I‚Äôm afraid
---
You gotta say what rewards you got.
---
Eh. Like 6 large and medium (I think) and two small before I f‚Äôing ran out of adhesive, again (of course I just sold crunch of bulk adhesive right before this event)...
---
I hated to sell that weapon. It was a wonderful piece. But I just couldn‚Äôt inflict enough damage in the Bog with it so I had to sell it, because of everything I have to get rid of, for weight management.
---
collecting 7600 wood is the real alpha achievement. You can't afk that one.

Medium gifts are the way to go for the more rare plans, it seems. I've been buying and crafting large and medium quality, but I've only gotten the plasma grenade plan to drop from medium gifts! Gotten it 5 times, have two I'm hoarding after the event ends
---
Just exit out the trade menu and try again, usually fixes it. I'm on xbox as well
---
Seen a bunch of actual PvP guys running around Whitespring killing each other before the event started I couldn't help thinking this is the way PvP should be 
---
Anyway seen them at it a few times figured they had some sort of clan or something.
---
Win some lose some. It is what it is. Accept it.
---
Appreciate it.
---
Did that several times, even logged out of the game. Happening on different vendor bots too.
---
As if they've never lied before.
---
Hmm, that's really weird. I would submit a ticket then, unfortunately. Not sure what causes this bug, especially not sure why you're still experiencing it
---
Nope, just buy it again
---
On ps4?
---
Gotta have something to fight though.

I‚Äôd not say rare exactly, the market has been flooded with plans this event, more then any other and it‚Äôs been a great cap sink to take them out of the market, but the drop rate is quite low on them plans
---
Can I has your extra? This is so neat looking! Thanks for the ideas!
---
Extra what?
---
If you're focusing on legendary farming, sure. Casual players who focus on a few legendaries per session can expect closer to 30/day of play. Unfortunately it's a real challange to balance things for both casual and hardcore players at the same time. A really focused player could max out their scrip in a week. Casual players would likely take a month or two.
---
How did you know ahead of time that a particular quest had leveled rewards?
---
I was thinking about this when the event was announced.  Rudolph hunting makes great sense thematically, but not so great in practicality.  
---
Scorched are spread evenly across the map, while radstags are not.  If we had an event where radstags were prime targets, every player on the server would crowded up in the Toxic Valley where radstags are most prevalent.  Yes, they can be found all over the map, but not in the volume that Toxic Valley has.  If you can spend 20 minutes hunting down three in Savage Divide, or server hop Graninger Farm over and over and kill 6-10 wholesale with one plasma grenade, where do you suppose everyone on every server is going to congregate?
---
I think scorched were chosen because they're typically low-value targets, appear everywhere, and have a broad level range that players of all levels can easily fight.  The added benefit of their tie to scorchbeasts makes for much more interesting farming situations and a lot more variety.  I think it was a well planned decision by the devs.  Let's give the players an ubiquitous enemy that typically doesn't pay out anything good, jazz it up with legendaries and gifts, and all of a sudden the "most commonly visited" landscape of the map changes entirely.  Before last week, I went inside Big Bend Tunnel maybe 3-4 times over the course of a year.  I'm there at least once a day now.  Same with Glassed Cavern and Watoga Civic Center.
---
All that being said, it would have been cool for the devs to create ultra-rare glowing red radstags.  Maybe a guaranteed max level three star legendary item and a large gift.  Again, it would certainly create a situation where serious farmers were server hopping Graninger Farm, which is most likely the reason that such an idea never left the brainstorming whiteboard.  If the RadRedStag had the same random chance of loot as scorched, players still wouldn't go hunt for them.  It's way, way easier to go to a dozen scorched-heavy sites on the map.  Thus, lets just make scorched be special and save unnecessary time and resources that can be devoted to fixing this damn 250dr bug and polishing up Wastelanders.
---
Or.. Or. Hear me out here. Bethesda couls make it so there's an option to play against teams like there is now. Or just play solo, playing against others only playing solo. That way it's really a single winner. Instead of a team winning.
---
It's a fourth or fifth tier legendary effect, which hasn't hit the live game yet.  It should come out with Wastelanders or shortly thereafter.
---
Look for me gottencrab45009
---
Happy Cake Day üíôüíõüíôüíõ
---
The All Rise for one, otherwise I need to wait until level 50 to do Watoga.
---
I actually had that when I was 190/220 and only entering my excavator power armor stopped it, BUT I could still run so I'd lose AP twice as fast outside of my armor. Are they adding like Dark Souls weight thresholds or is just a bug. Hoping for the latter so it can be fixed soon
---
Hey I am off for today how about tomarrow
---
There are already XB parties running 5-8 player squads, there's no way it would remain fair.

What ur psn

How the actual fck are people leveling that high?
---
My GT is ImSomewhatWeird. I'll be on most of this weekend. I have to work tonight though :(   But I rock melee as well so let's go fuck up some Santa ghouls.
---
I am, but trust me I can afford it. I just really liked your photo and I don‚Äôt understand the downvotes normally in posts. c'est la vie
---
Alright mine is SiderealMars133
---
It would cost Bethesda too much. 
---
Not that it would cost any other gaming company that much.
---
Alright
---
This is why i stick to stealth, didnt have any issues with my armor when the bug came out and my stuff doesnt break quick...mainly because im never seen lol. Nothing like sitting in front of the queen invisible to her üòÅ

I like where you're going, but some players can easily solo the SBQ in 2-5 minutes with a one star bloody handmade or combat rifle.  New content is going to have to be much, much more difficult to account for experienced players.  I'm pretty mediocre, and I'm soloing Dead in the Water on Standard every day that it's in rotation.  SBQ solo is fairly easy by comparison.
---
That character on the Mandalorian is my favorite.  (Quille?)
---
Well, glad to inspire!
---
Let's have some fun hehe

Event nukashine
---
Snally's one of the last ones still out of my reach (along with feral ghoul and glowing one, weirdly) ‚Ä¶ I never intend on even *using* them, I just gotta get 'em all.
---
.
---
Of course, the dupers have been out in force for a while now. A week before the event started, I saw a place with a ton of the mounted heads for sale yoinked, I assume, from the dev room, duped, and distributed. 
---
Since then, seen a camp with every single one of them on the walls, which also had the missing Faschnacht rare masks all over (and for sale) ‚Ä¶ one camp by the Whitespring train station (natch) while his level 2 alt had one a bit further north.
---
Just ‚Ä¶ *sigh*
---
If you are on Xbox dm me I need the Santa crash to plans
---
I could sell you some really good weapons. Then you could one shot the supermutaints.
---
‚ÄúAin‚Äôt taken the TV .‚Äù
---
I have one if you would like to buy it
---
Yes you are correct. It was cjanged some months ago.
---
PC?
---
Yeah, defeats the purpose IMO.
---
Oh, I can't tell you how relieved I am to hear that!! Lol
---
My friend had the white responder helmet.  She is  looking to sell it if anyone is interested
---
Using the word "break" may be a little misleading. Last I checked, you can buy back a legendary if you gave it to the machine by mistake
---
Have gotten every new plan as well as all primes I was missing and plasma nade and mine. They are all there. Have gotten at least 3 of each mount.
---
unfortunately, the one I saw was in a players display case, so I couldn't see the exact name of it, when I went to message that player, it said his settings wouldn't allow messages
---
it looked really neat in the display case, it was very shiny and silver
---
I know while doing uranium fever there are several dirty versions, I keep checking every time I go there in case one randomly spawns as clean
---
I still haven't gotten my loot on XB. Frankly getting tired of waiting.
---
I've linked/unlinked/relinked my accounts per every instruction I've found, and still nothing.
---
Starting to irritate me.
---
I am absolutely taking part in this
---
Can confirm. Or something similar to Quille I dono [spoiler alert] he dead meow
---
Exit the vault ..
---
You specifically said pistols need reduced range. I think you worded your comment poorly.
---
I tried to just now. It‚Äôs weird doing it on mobile. Especially upgrading.

You mad because your parents wont get you any IRL?
---
Yes, having server issues here as well. Friends and I have tried two different private servers, and we‚Äôve been getting kicked out, have been loading in just to go right back to the loading screen, etc.
---
wtf you don‚Äôt care about the rug?
---
Don‚Äôt rush the main questline.  Each major zone is leveled appropriately.  Stick to the Forest for the first 10 levels or so.
---
Explore.  Read everything.  Listen to the holotapes, they (along with notes) tell the story.  
---
Equip better weapons and armor as you come across them.  Loot and scrap the rest to learn plans.  
---
Take your time.

My bad didn't realize i used both hands while swinging them like a bat? They both are one handed melee what are u talking about? The meat hook is also the only weapon that counts as one handed and unarmed? I use one handed perk cards and for some crazy reason it raises the damage.
---
I'm on PS4. I clicked the link from Twitter and did what twitch said to do, and it didn't work. So I logged in to Bethesdas site clicked on my name, clicked linked accounts, and only PlayStation was there. So I clicked add, and Twitch, and logged into twitch from there. Then restarted the game and had everything.
---
You've killed me a few times :3

I always put team fill off and just check back when the circle closes. Gotta slog that christmas exp grind somehow :P

Ugh I hate NW but I waaaant

Bye?

Just ran into a group doing this on xbox. Was the most confusing thing to watch from the bushes. Lol.

Not good enough to remember

Okay.

Kenny_p is getting coal this year

You on xbox? I have like 30+ from doing silo runs. Lol. You can have one for free
---
Damn. Back to Encryptid!
---
Wow,  I totally missed that!  I think I need a break! üòÅ
---
This made my enjoyment of the game incredibly low I stopped playing a few times, a lot of people will say to hold off on doing quests until you hit 50 due to the unique weapons.
---
That's what I did and ended up levelling so slow that it took atleast a day to go from lvl18 to 19. Really killed the enjoyment of the game.
---
Damn, back to Encryptid!
---
There's this magical thing called google.
---
I just accepted

Maybe rebuild the database?

Pre-Dogmeat? FOOL DOGMEAT IS ETERNAL. He is everywhere except New Vegas because he don't suffer no robodog fools.

Please do not compare real world to the fallout logic. It makes the entire argument terrible. We're talking about Gameplay in terms of balance, and from most people's interaction with pistols, they're passable at best in terms of VATS and absolutely subpar and even bad in non-vats.

Looks good.  I really wish that night time was darker.

I put the Santatron inside my cabin on an upper floor out of sight, but of course, you can still hear it, so tonight as I fast travelled back, someone was trying to break in THROUGH THE SHUTTERS downstairs!
---
Do that daily. I've tried EVERY suggestion made in regards to this game.
---
It's NOT my PS4. No other game I have does this.
---
It's NOT my internet. No other game I have does this.
---
It started straight after the last system update,mans a couple after the last game patch.
---
second character I avoided that quest till I was 50, so I get a 50 Somerset.
---
Wastelander returned ü§ò
---
The population split would be brutal. Already takes 5-10 minutes to find a game.
---
Thanks that's good to know!
---
No problem!
---
I wish it was fun for me. :(
---
Yeah there's a few answers regarding this been posted already. Apparently it's something to do with teams. You have to team up before you enter your private world and then invite them to join. They implemented it to stop just randos from your friends list joining.
---
I'm not expecting to gain anything from this post. Just stating my opinion. People can be as they want, it's a semifree internet
---
So the game is a long distance, or the two of you are?
---
Passive aggressive ??? H-t-  ... You mean like ... Don't go away mad, just go away üôÇ
---
the two of us are, she is in the UK and im in the US. do you happen to know how i can tag her?
---
PS4 or PS4 Pro?
---
Is it the one at the top of the map? Hemlock Holes I think its called?
---
25 washing machines
---
Kidding you got a scrip. Max amount you can carry is 1000. They are used for rolling for a random legendary gear at Berkley Springs Train station. Just keep in mind the legendary gear will be leveled to you so may consider saving until you get some levels under ya.
---
If you are that far away, I am sure someone else is tagging her....
---
Maybe that‚Äôs where I stole the idea from :)
---
I was actually just thinking this earlier, so I‚Äôm glad there are others who are on the same page.

I am holding presents for later, since they are so light
---
Yup I wasted over 5 of them trying to get a trio of legendary scorchbeast down. No luck. I had to shoot them, then they landed at like 10% hp. -_-
---
Can't help you personally, but I can give you a tip:
---
To move your camp, just go to the spot you want your new camp to be. Open your pipboy and you'll see the button prompt along the bottom of the screen to move your camp. I'm on PS4 so I don't know what key  it would be on PC.
---
The crafting lag is better but still there. Sometimes there‚Äôs none but there‚Äôs usually a split second of lag when I craft something.
---
I‚Äôm certainly not going to buy any till I‚Äôve had a bunch of chances to buy or find
---
Yeah if you do thatd be great
---
The disc is just checked to load the game, games these days are all installed on the drive.
---
after opening almost 90 large crates and whatever drops I got zero plasma nade. Made a new character traded 20 large and 10 med crafted got 3 plasma nades 2 mines. Helps to remove the level gated mods and weapons from pool
---
This makes me glad I have my sister and her husband who play and helped me grind levels without doing a lot of quest, I‚Äôm a week or 2 at most into a new character and im sitting at level 37 with most of the locations on the map undiscovered and the only quests I usually do are uranium fever/protest march/Grafton day to grind for legendaries to farm scrip. It can be done with help, I‚Äôd probably be SOL without them tho.
---
Pro
---
oh OUCH
---
The problem im having is I've been walking around trying to place it somewhere and it has a problem of where I'm trying to place it not being allowed is there a known spot on the map i can fasttravel to where I can set my camp
---
Correct only teammates can see the emotes.
---
Yeah I liked that they could be levelled up but you can't mod them lol..
---
Thanks, but no thanks. I bought one for 5K, and I‚Äôm having some buyer‚Äôs remorse.
---
This would be amazing or the weapon has XP and you level it up or buy legendary stars as it grows with you.  Always though you should have XP in the weapon kind of like Skyrim but the weapon levels not you.
---
Well, you can't place your camp too close to existing locations, or to other people's camps. So if you're blocked, you just gotta keep walking around until the camp module is highlighted green then you should be able to place it.
---
I suggested as an option for the purveyor. One idea was to spend 50 scrip per 5 levels. It got ignored lol
---
Yes.
---
I walked through the wooded hills for 30 mins then gave up
---
Fixer is pretty good too.
---
Instig. +50% Limb damage (head is a limb) is better than the explosive in my mind.  No splash damage from the explosion robbing you of the instigating bonus on proximity hits.
---
Vampire Exp. Handmade is almost better than stimpacks.
---
Not really.  I can walk straight up to an  3* Assaultron or Sentry Bot firing the Vampire's .50 cal. and destroy them with no health loss.
---
Wasn't a Behemoth.
---
Absolutely not this will absolutely bankrupt the trading market and destroy hld price per entry and make lld non-existent. But beth knows this so not worried.
---
I got 18 handmade large holiday gifts and I got the mounted Mothman!
---
Quad Lever is a bit annoying in that it loads all bullets individually.  20 bullets take almost 15 seconds to reload, and it doesn't like being halted in mid load to shoot.
---
Yeah I have a vampire shotgun that‚Äôs level 45... I can‚Äôt find another one at all. It‚Äôs irritating. Nonetheless it works for gaining health, I just wish it could do more damage
---
Even with speed demon?
---
QE Fixer is awesome.  High damage.  High fire rate.  80 round clip.

Emptied six Ultracite Plasma Cores into the Queen tonight and when she died I got nothing when I checked the body right after her death.  Couple of minutes later went by her and checked again and all the loot was there.
---
Yes üòÇ
---
I'm sorry you're experiencing this. 
---
I WANT to play this game. Whatever is causing these crashes is making it extremely hard to.
---
When you pump up both pistol and rifleman perks, the pipe revolver is a beast.  But you gotta put a lot of perk points in both Agility and Perception.  Not a bad build though.  Excellent build for early game.  Non-Legendary Pipe pistols are about as good as it gets for the non-legendaries.  You can have to full build plans learned by level 5 just by scrapping the very plentiful stocks of pipe revolvers dropped and found.
---
I have never seen this notification (even when my bag and its marker are gone).  Can you confirm this happens on PC version?
---
How long have you been playing? That's nothing. I have hundreds. Unfortunately that's how the game goes. But it has gotten better this last 5 months. Not sure if it's the patches or me getting rid of all weight reduction perks. How much is your weight without any weight reduction perks?
---
Haven't tried that.  Good get.  Quad Lever is actually pretty fun, so long as stuff is dead by the 20th shot (which mostly it is).
---
How much do you sell it for?  I try to sell anything that isn't a legendary weapon for 10% "value", but that seems low for flux.
---
Weird that I can't seem to do the quest anymore, it doesn't prompt me when I click on the wall safe thing.  I hope it isn't a side effect of the bug where I'd get a few every time I logged in, I'd get to sell off a bunch daily for a cap a piece.
---
Enable passive mode?...
---
‚ÄúRan into my LOF‚Äù 
---
This ones on you bud, pacifist mode exists for a reason üëç
---
I feel like since they got rid of survival mode and forced the PvPers over to adventure, this happens more than it should. My bf had a guy pick his locks just to be able to attack him, its crazy.
---
You must spend a lot of time in the bathroom.
---
I've never seen my character actually take damage from low hunger or thirst.
---
When they are intentionally weaving to stand directly in front of you, you know their intention. This isn‚Äôt my first run in with the trolls
---
I too role play as a helpful survivor...until someone steals from my santatron. Then I turn into the map‚Äôs Terminator.
---
Just sold a plasma grenade plan for 7777 caps. Most caps i‚Äôd ever had. Bought a ton of cheap serums from a vendor as an investment to sell back to station vendors!
---
If you had pacifist mode on, you wouldn't have a problem. This is preventable, you're just doing it wrong.
---
Leveled instanced dungeon boss.
---
I wish we just removed weapon levels all together.
---
Turn on pacifist mode?
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter what their intention is, if you are not in pacifist mode then shooting someone even accidentally is a sign that you want to PvP, stay in pacifist and stay away from workshops if you don‚Äôt want to PvP.
---
There are bugs with being wanted and sparking a mutation as well as nuka grenades/mines but those are bugs, which hopefully get addressed at some point.  People targeting players while exploiting these bugs are the trolls, not someone responding to being attacked.
---
Once you shoot someone outside of pacifist or take a workshop then it‚Äôs open season on you, if I was them I would‚Äôve shot you back too and possibly destroyed your base if you started mouthing off in area chat, stay in pacifist mode or stop complaining, not everybody who PvPs is a troll or an asshole, for some of us this is the only endgame content left at the moment, this entire situation is your fault, but instead of acknowledging that you come here just to start crying about it.
---
Insert 'you have to be a fallout first member' reaction here :P
---
**snickers** 
---
...and then the Colonel Gutsy said *"I'm about to wreck this man's day..."*
---
If your only end game content consists of jumping directly in front of someone for the sole purpose of PvPing and griefing their base, find another game.
---
Maybe you should find an easier game if it‚Äôs too complicated of a process for you to then pacifist mode on lol, I hear Minecraft is pretty easy
---
I bought the year sub and I enjoy it. I spend about half my time split between private and Adventure. If you can afford it, and you enjoy the game, it is well worth it for the year sub price. Happy Birthday!
---
Why sell test servers?! But then again, i wouldn't find it strange if they did. But it would be better publicity if they did not :P
---
I agree with you that, if they're gonne releae it before and because of wastelanders, they probably should've teased or mentioned it in the inside the vault articles.
---
But hey, optimistic me here.... Maybe they just release it before wastelanders and we're happy :P
---
Based on your comment history, it looks like you‚Äôd fit in great with the 12 year olds on COD.

---
Haha I know you‚Äôre mad when you start digging through my profile, what‚Äôs wrong man did the post backfire on you? Did you expect sympathy from the strangers on the Internet? 
---
I‚Äôm glad they destroyed your base, it‚Äôs pretty easy to see why :)
---
not 'sell' as in actually asking money for it (Test-it 1st sub?) but advertise it as new "content/feature" to the public
---
Do you lose the ranger outfit if  you quit payinng fookr fallout 1st
---
I voiced a frustration about some of the more toxic players in the game. Clearly, you‚Äôre one of them
---
Oh yea i see it now. That'll cost me some points :')
---
I think its more of an unpopular opinion because your refusing to use a tool that has been in the game for a long time now. 
---
I mean frankly your griefing yourself *by not using pacifist* and falling prey to a stupidly basic tactic. 
---
Its one thing if people are abusing mutations or glitching a shite ton of nuke mines. This isn't anything near those.
---
It's always like 3 whole seconds or maybe 2 for me
---
Mine are currently in my vendor at 5K caps apiece along with the rest of my Halloween ones but I don't expect them to sell for a few months.
---
Nahh this isn‚Äôt that, this is a post about your incompetence and inability to find the game settings menu where the pacifist mode option is, and a desperate cry for attention. 
---
But yeah keep believing every PvPer is toxic, I‚Äôm sure that mentality caries over in your personal life as well.
---
Got Fallout 1st when it came out.
---
No regrets.
---
- Most of all it‚Äôs a matter of convenience.  
---
- saves time (more playing less inventory management)
---
- experience the world solo (like FO4) how it was designed (all items and mobs on their own place). Lets you appreciate the detail of how each location was designed before it was looted
---
- no griefers (my daughter can build her ‚Äúpink bases‚Äù for me  in peace)
---
- Not buying FO1st and punishing‚Äù Bethesda for straddling the ‚Äúred line‚Äù of pay2win is not a valid argument for me.  I like the game and don‚Äôt mind spending some money on it - especially if it may help with developing a better product.
---
- Extra atoms is a plus (though I don‚Äôt use them much)
---
I can do that in my Solar armor without a Vampire's weapon.
---
Not since I got my Vault armor. I'm staying dressed as a hedge from here on out.
---
i like it i just wish it scaled to ur character's lvl strictly like if ur 50, everything u find is lvl 50
---
I‚Äôd delete this post too if I made a complete jackass of myself like this üòÇü§£
---
I mean how do you know in-game.
---
Haven't seen the nuke one, and we've launched dozens of nukes since the update. 
---
The delay in seeing downed/killed names is trrrible for some reason now, though.
---
I have to keep resetting, because randomly in a gun fight, either my gun won't reload, or it won't fire.
---
Tesla sometimes works too
---
Damn it, I'm on PC
---
Lvl 414. Took 3 months off, now I'm back for a while
---
Definitely worth it. It's the best deal on atoms by far. The scrap box is essential. The tent is a really nice convenience but not essential. Then of course you get access to the cool FONV duster. The private server is a convenient thing to use for farming but I'm still on public 90% of the time
---
With the right perk cards you can easily get a nuke briefcase for the win or hide in the nuke zones taking next to zero rad damage. It's perfect for a bush dweller. Or just use aquaboy/aquagirl and permanently hide in water (only useful on Morgantown map).
---
Is this still in the shop for plus members?
---
Thank you I will def heed your advice!  If your ever playing on Xbox one and want some company send me a message!
---
Thank you ! If you ever want someone to play with if ur on Xbox one send me a message!
---
Any recommendations?
---
Lol are you sure ?
---
Sounds like you have a hoarding problem.
---
It‚Äôs a lot better now
---
Yea the mods unlock quickly. For early game the player doesn‚Äôt have all the perks yet, but it just keeps getting better as he progresses and unlocks them. Yes PERS and AGI took up lots of perks, it‚Äôs a great build and can be easily configured to use other rifles.

This.

Yeah you have no idea how many times I have uninstalled and reinstalled it but I‚Äôll try manually installing it I‚Äôm just thinking of sending in a ticket tbh.
---
You don't miss out on Serendipity at all, it's a permanent part of my build. You just don't have to rely on it 24/7 like with a Bloodied build.
---
The items that were in the pack, were expecting them to be in your inventory?  Because all it really gives you are paints and plans to build the cosmetics. There shouldn't be anything placed in your inventory.
---
lol
---
Yeah I know it‚Äôs to build them just I‚Äôm not getting any option to,it‚Äôs bull swish.
---
On PC and just played many hours today sans crash. It is odd how some of us have more problems than others, I suspect something is sensitive in the network coding or something.
---
Yes, ps4
---
Yeah it happens sometimes just try switching servers.
---
Ok, have a nice life.  We don't care, not every game is for everyone.
---
No, but I'll check that tomorrow.. when I freeze, my teammate sees me freeze, if I'm mid jump, I just freeze in midair for however long.
---
Ok just making sure. But I wish you the best of luck if you have to go through the horrible support system.
---
Jingle bells, silent night, deck the halls, and many more are all public domain. Costs nothing, free to use. Certain popular ones (rudolf, frosty, grandma got run over, jingle bell rock, etc) are licensed, from the 1940's to today. We arent asking for the licensed ones, we are asking for the basic public domain ones that were created in the early 1800's that you hear everywhere (because it's free and companies are cheap).
---
Private servers will auto kick you (with a 15 minute warning) after 6 hours in the server... tested 3 times now farming xmas boxes
---
I had to jump a few servers for it to work... quest markers for that quest didn‚Äôt work either so that was *fun*
---
If you are on pc just buy another account they cheap and then all you have to do is run the game twice from the exe and give all your extra stuff the mule level thr mule up with packrat or and its even more effective much cheaper than buying subcription in the long run
---
I literally love this comment. Literally.
---
At least your quest markers work. Completing any quest or event has been an annoyance for me
---
woah really? i knew it was rare i didnt realize it was ***that*** rare guess ill be upgrading my crap shack later lol ty for the info
---
Found one in a vendor for 1k and figured that was the lowest I‚Äôll find it whilst the event is running. Just like PA plans, they were 5-10k depending on which one you had but I see them for as low as 1k, even lower whilst the event is on.
---
Like the dude above me said. I‚Äôd wait till the event has finished and then think about selling to get best price.
---
True. But, I just start up higher on the map and try and fall into those places.  Also, I use a purpose-built CAMP blueprint that is pretty much JUST a ladder.
---
The prices ‚Äúuse‚Äù to be 125k so hold out for a little while it will go up more than that probably.
---
I wouldn't put it past them to add the plans to the vendors in January.
---
Is not like it hasn't happened before.
---
Wait, you on console or PC?  Cause the photos are still stored in your folders in PC even if you do an uninstall.
---
Boy would i love to lvl up my lever action rifle 
---
(Btw does anyone have one i could scrap to get atatchments, i would pay you)
---
Other teams can not see your team‚Äôs emotes, but they can hear the sound of an emote if they are close enough.
---
I specifically say sth to be clear and then you said I worded it poorly. Do you know how ridiculous you sound lmao.
---
I really hate conversing with stupid people that need other to hold their hands to understand everything but then like to act smart, one such example, is you.
---
You might still have them on PS4 as well. Go to Setting - Storage - Photos.....I think that's it...and scroll through them. I had a ton of the photos I even deleted in game still stored in there.
---
Oh hell no man. Yea I use only one account. I'm not sure about the time before you lose your server but it's pretty safe. I've had disconnects on my own server an logged into it again right where I left off. Alright so behind whitesprings station is a dumpster with a empty suitcase in it. I use that to transfer things. There's like 2 other containers you can use to store stuff right by the dumpster but they have weight restrictions. The suitcase I use doesn't have any weight restrictions on it. 
---
It's also super close to the fast travel spawn point. Just turn right and hop over the low wall an you're there. One of my alt characters, I put down a tent about 10ft from the dumpster so I could waddle over and grab things out an put things in for my main character or vice versa.
---
I've seen some posts about losing things by transferring on your own but I haven't lost anything yet and I wondered if they were using a bottomless container or not.
---
I am going to have to agree to disagree.
---
From a personal point of view, as taste usually goes, I find all taxidermy rather in the gruesome side of things and currently nothing beats the mounted wendigo in the gruesome department.
---
You have half of what not so long ago used to be a fellow human being popping out of your wall, no SBQ head is going to top that.
---
I saw a paper bag the other day and had the urge to loot it..... üòÇ
---
Yes but if you leave the machine it will be gone unless a bug occurs.
---
Just like you
---
Definitely not, wifi works fine on everything else
---
Is that term old-guy now?  Fuck it, I could less what 99% of people think.  I barely spent the effort when I was 19.
---
PC, I don't know how to do it on console.
---
Its not like Billy has a gun to your head anymore:) Welcome back!
---
Nah XD I just saw in you comment ‚Äúits great to Twink on a new character‚Äù, its just me being immature cause I saw twink and giggled
---
Talking about plans, i have a question. I found some plans called something like pocketed robot limbs. I learned them but they don't show up on any bench for crafting. What do i have to do to craft them?
---
He is on Physco, x100
---
Sorry for your loss, losing your dog is like losing family, hell they are family. I would love for them to put some kind of dog meat statue in the game. He was the most beloved companion in all of fallout.
---
No you get to keep the outfits
---
They're a mod you can attach to robot limb armour. If you go to modify your robot limb armour you should see them.
---
I've got the electrified buzz blade if you want it.
---
It really behaves a lot like it does in Gay culture.  Young, hungry men with ambition to moe up the social ladder and older, wealthy lovers acting as patrons.  WASP culture is no different.  Middle aged housewives desperately doing yoga to stay tighter than the babysitter.  Middle management spending years in prescribed higher education, stepping on top of each other to hopefully become 5% higher up the ladder.
---
I'd love it, pop me a message at Beldayko on xbox , I'll be on in the morning
---
I don't even have that armor. So thats why i dont see it anywhere. Thanks. By the way, do you know where i can get such armor?
---
125k of what? Caps,don't go that high
---
Wow. Really impressive! Some lights on the tree would look really good but I guess camp budget and wiring would be an issue.
---
This ^^^ I run a heavy bloody build and usually I get killed in only 2-3 shots, I honestly don‚Äôt remember the last time I‚Äôve had to repair my armor. Plus my luck perk repairs it anyway so no need to. Makes the game a bit better when you actually have to worry about death.
---
They're a not so infrequent drop from enemies. That's all I remember about the armour. Just returned after a hiatus of about a year so couldn't tell you anything actually useful. Sorry.
---
crystalizing barrel. good to know.
---
im using my kryo on sbq fights but it only freezes her on like 1 out of 4 fights.
---
im not sure what im doing wrong, besides the barrel, any other usage tips? 
---
i either try to vatscrit her inflight or just spam her with shots when on the ground.
---
  I like my Fixers, Have a B25, an I10 and an EE25. I do carry the B25 for boss fights, but in general prefer my BE15 handmade, the fixers just have poor recoil and the smaller mag hurts also.
---
Well I have the one leg, so...
---
That's ok you've already been very helpful thanks.
---
Nope :(
---
I ended up just stashing until i can think of something i haven't yet.
---
I‚Äôve had the same problem. Either having to reload multiple times before it actually reloads, the gun not firing, or the gun auto-firing like mad after being picked up. I keep losing the downed/killed feed too which is epically frustrating.
---
Are you a PA user? 
---
In general you can just scrap/drop them you can easily find more. Just make sure they are empty, and you don't scrap your favourite PA.
---
Well that‚Äôs definitely him. Same level and icon.
---
You only need one for each type of PA you are going to have. Rarely more than 3 - so scrap the extras. But be careful later cause they may have armor pieces on them but appear to just be a chassis. Like quest rewards from Rose ( raider PA ) or BOS.
---
What are the PA types?
---
On 5 characters they do.
---
I saw one in a vendor for 10999 caps but I thought it too much so I passed.
---
It makes a big difference - for example all your alts get the benefits also eg tents, scrap boxes etc. Great for transferring stuff.
---
Use it to bash into something. I will break quickly.
---
I hope so, im honestly already tired of shooting things to break it
---
if i take photo in photomode or use the camera, then ps4 automatically creates backup
---
pistols are useless even as mob/santa guns unless you perk em up w lvl3 cards.
---
what a waste. i tried many w several legendary effects. i wanted to but its just sad.
---
only exeption is pipe revolver w riflestock, here you can get decent damage with both pistol and rifle perks all on lvl1 each.
---
I like to set them all down.
---
Pick up and stash the ones I wanna keep. Scrap the rest. 
---
Havnt scrapped the wrong one yet lol
---
Do you any kind of error message or screen?
---
I figured it out like two seconds after posting this but thank you so much! What an odd bug.
---
I would not say the devs are actually that good. I seen the kit which has never changed codewise since Morrowind. If you have over 15 years to learn the code of an engine you start to wonder if they do this on purpose. I mean the whole state of the game which uses the same exact code, literally zero changes from previous releases and no manipulation as well since you can spawn old assets from previous ones in this one.
---
I'm just saying they should finally get themselves a new engine. The thing is collapsing on itself with their every attempt to fix it since Fallout 4.  
---
Of course their greed is based on a fact they just want more investors so they slap price tag on everything to force people buying more often but thats nothing new there these days.
---
or at all with those prices....
---
It's a slot machines currency, you salvage your actually decent legendary gear and then pull the lever on the trader over and over until you run out entirely while having about 500 worthless items and maybe one decent.
---
Didn't have a problem moving the Halloween ones at the same price. People that weren't around for the event will pay highly for now-unobtainable items.
---
T-45, Raider*, T51b, T-60, Ultracite*, X-01 and Excavator. 
---
Those marker* you are gifted a full suit if as a quest reward. 
---
Most people run a suit of ExPA and 1-2 of the others. Even myself as a PA user only use T-60 and ExPA. I do have the others in my stash though.
---
I saw some other guy posting a story like yours where it turned out to be the number of weightless items he was carrying.
---
Try renaming the sets of armour that you want to keep
---
I built and scrapped a load and stopped receiving plans for it. Haven‚Äôt found anymore from events etc either. I‚Äôve got barely any customisation options. I guess RNG has been bad to me.
---
I cant agree coz then the weapons will be weaker
---
Those PAs all use the same chassis, don't they?
---
Itll just say lost connection... If im lucky it says anything at all. It makes a strange sound. Reminds me of a jackhammer on energy drinks.
---
I must‚Äôve opened over 100 presents now and not received either of the Christmas ones, but got the normal creature ones coming out the wazoo.
---
Bought the Santa crash one for 100 caps off someone. 
---
On the other hand, I did get an ultracite Gatling gun plan and some prime receiver plans.
---
I don't think you can repeat it, no.
---
Firstly anything above level 50 does not matter it does not make you stronger or better it‚Äôs just a number
---
Second the armour was all broke I‚Äôm with the recent patch then re fixed unequip all your armour and re equip it,
---
Did not hear the bug effected power armour at the time but pull picked off frame and put them back 
---
Lastly super mutants are a bitch sometimes like that occasional scorched you run into with a grenade launcher
---
That part i believe would be PlayStations way of dealing with Bethesdas crap! Although i love Bethesdas crap... Im calling it how i see it acting. ü§£
---
Yeah, I came across this community and now I‚Äôm back in the game, after not playing it since the start of the year. The Christmas event has got me running round, I haven‚Äôt even got into the pioneer quest chain yet.
---
Yeah, it messed me up aswell. Been away since the start of the year. Thought I was mad as I could swear there was an upstairs door.
---
Keep hold of any decent looking melee weapon, you‚Äôll struggle for ammo. Get to the overseers camp, as you head to it from vault 76, W you will cross a river and a road. As you look at the camp from the road, turn right. Follow that into the town, check every house and decking. There are a lot of good supplies lying around. The responders building has some food supplies and a cooking station out side so you can boil water and make food. Check the church, there‚Äôs a vendor and go up into the clock tower and check for loot there.
---
Any spare weapons you find, sell them to the vendor, you can get up to 1400 caps each day just from selling stuff. If you buy anything, that will add back into the caps pool. 
---
Scrap all the junk items you find, they will weigh less. 
---
If you find that you‚Äôve picked a build that you‚Äôre not happy with, once you reach level 50, you can choose to move special points or a new card.
---
It does not have to be completely broken, you can fire like just a few shots and then repair it again.
---
Sorry for you loss man, for people who aren‚Äôt dog people I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs quite understood how your dog is your best mate and partner in crime.
---
Yeah I know but it repairs past the full repair and it takes alot more shots to damage it enough so its better to just repair an already broken one than it is to waste time and Plastic making bolts
---
Damn, I feel sorry for you PC players, with all this cheating and hacking going on.
---
I recall some patch notes mentioning the sentry bot is fixed recently, and haven't noticed it anymore.  Unsure on Tesla bug.
---
feel sorry for Bethesda
---
i dont know any MMO/Online coop game that will allow such things
---
even GTAO not so poor coded
---
Mine lower level enemies like Scorched for weapons to sell at vendors. Morgantown is a good place to start. 
---
Morgantown boasts some plentiful stash caps which respawn every 20 hours or so. Learn where these  are and make the cap stash run part of your daily routine. 
---
When you have enough caps start Vendor hopping and check out prices. Don't immediately buy anything until you see the cheapest prices.
---
Most camps have free Purified Water. Stockup. You can sell it at Station vendors and make easy caps. Mostly anything can be sold at automated Vendors with the exception of plans so anything you dont use sell!
---
Search everything, you be surprised what you people leave in the most unlikely places. I once found 40 fusion cores in a suitcase!
---
Watoga Station is a good place to scavenge for dropped items when there is regular scorched earth events.
---
Pros and cons to every build, consider it landing at all your leeway. ( my first character was 2 handed melee man up)
---
Yeah just happened to me after fast travel in power armor. My hud display is visible but the world and enemy‚Äôs are not. I can go to the map and it looks normal but my character POV is black. As far as I know it‚Äôs a bug that goes way back to like patch 4 or 5 and has never been fixed. And your correct ONLY way to fix it is to close the game. I believe Bethesda has acknowledged it 1 time I‚Äôm aware of. Only on PS4 and we are screwed
---
Mutant: What? Human gobble my big green ook?
---
It has been an issue with masks from fallout 4, doubt they want to fix it.
---
Heh, yeah, probably I was so impressed with the look of schorched heads that I didn't notice anything else ;)
---
I have to admit that for me it's the hardest part of shopping lately - I never know if something is duped or not. I'm still looking for a Frog and a Sloth Head and sometimes I can see shops where people sell *every* christmas plan...like 200 hundred copies of each and then it's more obvious (especially when you see rare fasnacht masks in their displays. And the owner comes wearing this beatiful Hunters mask or whatever it's called). But then you go to the shop, look at some weapons, chems or ammo, then see something like single queen's claw or head and just *really* don't know.
---
Sleeping bag, weapon skins, and striped outfit were all released at the same time. You are saying there are two more? Not sure how I missed that
---
I was in the supermarket when a Xmas jingle came on and my eyes immediately darted about trying to find the Santa dressed scorched that was about to attack.
---
Thank you all for your help! This is truly one of the best communities
---
You could always use that water duck thing that Homer used in that episode of the Simpson‚Äôs.
---
On the contrary, workshops are granting large section of content and gameplay to players.
---
anyone who writes in their title that‚Äôs a descriptive post gets a downvote from me. It was an upvote until those last few words.
---
Rubber bands
---
Had the same thing happen on Xbox. It‚Äôs the worst.
---
Yep. No special chassis needed
---
I'm confused? üòï
---
If this is true it would be one of the few circumstances they need to rollback the servers...
---
But let's not kid ourselves, they aren't even capable of that.
---
 People have been doing it for a while from what I've been told, by swapping pointers with Cheat Engine. I'd recommend staying out of public worlds for a while.
---
Got close to 100 hours on pc, iv never crashed, only had the game freeze on a loding screen once. This seems very inconsistent.
---
Maybe let us pay 100 scrip to raise it up 5 levels.
---
It‚Äôs not hard to just write a complete sentence for your title that is descriptive.
---
Should probably try the vendors at Whitesprings.
---
Brotherhood most likely
---
2 days ago I moved 30k to a mule and went back to my Camp to reactivate my Vendors. 3 people turned up and bought 29k worth of goods before I had to quit the Game again. Whole process took a little over 5 minutes.
---
My usual XP/legendary run is Whitesprings- Huntersville- West Tek- National Isolated Radio Array- Harpers Ferry.
---
As far as i know the only drops you need the plan for are the fixer and bear arm. All the other things are a possible drop no matter what
---
Did you actually see what my previous title was? Lol.
---
I see your current one.
---
Do you know why some plans are consumables yet others can be resold?  If the Civil War Dress plan were a consummable, why have I seen it for sale at other players' vendors?
---
You only need the plans for the fixer, bear arm, and sheepsquatch 1h and 2h. Everything else can drop without knowing the plan. The legendary modules are for crafting the Vault 94 raid armor - you also need the plans to craft those pieces, and you get them from completing the raid on standard and expert difficulty.
---
I have two
---
5.56 ammo in this game is king. I'm a weapons dealer and ammo dealer in game  and I have dealt with several individuals who only will except 5.56 as payment. So I will tell you to create as much 5.56 as you can. One 5.56 round is equal to one cap.
---
Lol reminds me of the metro games
---
On YouTube there was a video, from last year but it was vault 96  with these ennemies.
---
For now there's nothing behind this vault door. The only locked door with something behind it is vault 63, last year it was possible to explore the vault. But since vault 94 raid update, they moved most of the interiors into individual cells (different map than the world map). Now behind vault door 63 you can just find the first room, with the door mechanism, all doors are now walls. The only coo thing is the big "Welcome to vault 63" on the wall :P.
---
As for 79, you can find a skeleton inside the cave and a terminal, both have hints of what happened. But there's nothing more for now :)
---
This, with the homeboy perk in camp so u don‚Äôt starve so fast
---
Nope
---
Not a lot considering you can get it a little easier now.  I would tell you to hold on to it until the event is over just to see.
---
iTs yoUr sYstEMs FaUlt
---
They drop both weapon and mod plan yeah. But idk if you need to learn the weapon before being able to loot the mod plan.
---
Any plan can be sold. If you use one you do not know, it is gone and then you can craft that thing. Once you know a plan it shows (known) next to any other copies you find, and you cannot use them again. Most plans you see for sale will be extra copies the seller has found after they learned it. Hope that helps!
---
So you're telling me to buy FuckYou First? I'd rather just not log in :D
---
Thanks
---
That's the message
---
That sucks good luck
---
You will not regret it.  I got the year subscription unlimited junk at 0 weight you can't beat it. Then you can pop up a scrapping tent anywhere. And a private server where you dont have to worry about the common rabble.
---
You can use remote play with your phone, I just collect my resources every once in a while and stay on the server. I think that's only on PS4 though
---
Thanks! Send prayers and thoughts plz
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm waiting for before I do more than raise an eyebrow.
---
It does happen every so often.  It's no different than the blue screen of death or the server disconnects.
---
You can find a dog war harness in the game. If you're interested I could try to remember where.
---
cant post evidence here its against reddit rules

Hmm ive been 2 shot before never one shot except by legendary mirelurk kings this one is new

Holiday event people arent nuking much atm

"Execute order 66"

People are pissing and moaning about fallout first lol. Which I did get, but there are those that complain about it.
---
Fallout 1st is the best thing to ever happen though. They should probably release Fallout 2nd too
---
Everytime I launch one
---
I assume ur refering to a drinky bird
---
We've heard our community loud and clear and have disabled the ability to attack enimies. Now we've moved that feature to our additional subscription service, for just ¬£20 a month you can actually kill things'.
---
Do it, honestly Fallout 1st is the best thing to ever happen in this game
---
Idk how good of an answer i can give u other than all the time i lost 2 megasloths and a snallygastor in 1 week becuz i was server hopping idk why this caused it all i know it always happend when i was acid farming i assume it died but it couldve just dissapeared
---
Go to the white springs and buy the plan you can make as many as your hi ink supply will allow that what I did
---
Can you give me more information about this? I'm on PS4, and I had no idea I could use my phone to do anything with the game.
---
Download the remote play app, it's really easy and handy
---
Ah yeah, that makes sense.
---
I play in teams hide in bushes pop out and kill people hiding in a bush is viable tactic
---
Think of it as an atom subscription with some added perks. 
---
That scrap box is addictive as hell, though.
---
Thx, these guns are way to rare in my 80 playhours i only found 1
---
...come again?
---
If you need a good weapon or ammo hit me up in game my tag is cootdog level 395.

i've heard that the Mr. Fuzzy ride counts as constantly moving, but i have yet to actually test this theory
---
Yeah they are hard work to find the plan ain't that expensive either id go out get a load of junk en make like 5 lvl 15's at a time then scrap them straight away
---
I‚Äôll be all for that, death ain‚Äôt cheap üëåüèº
---
Best ladders in the game
---
Use a complete sentence. That is clickbait. Someone has to click in to know if there is something else you are saying. It‚Äôs not that complicated.
---
True but I don‚Äôt think they should complain about it when we get free DLC content, I got F1st to help the game out
---
Just out of curiosity, why did you leave out power fists?
---
Can't confirm on PC, console player here.

I use a clothespin on my keyboard. I change my keybinds so that the left arrow key is w and I go into a locked portable toilet.

We did 10+ nukes on ws yesterday, XB1. Plus another 3 queen's.

I was short on wood while playing Fallout 4 settlement building once. And I was like ‚Äúhell yeah‚Äù when encountered a few brooms in my neighborhood supermarket...

He died from loneliness because you left him for to long.

Bro... You literally make no sense and sound like a complete idiot, how in the flying fuck is that clickbait? You are on crack my guy üòÇ
---
I literally stated everything I talk about in the actual post including why I had to reinstall in the first place, I understand you probably get off on acting high and mighty on reddit but there are times in life where you need to shove your foot in your mouth and realize your wrong in a situation and swallow your self pride. This was one of those times. Given how you not only felt the need to comment that you downvoted a post because you were somehow offended by the title but you preceded to comment again stating how you dealt with the same thing on Xbox.
---
Is it seriously that hard to just read a post, comment if you have something relevant to the actual questions or discussion at hand and carry on? Why does it need to be a negative "yOu iS wRoNG aND uR tiTLe iS bAd mKAy! dISlIke*

Marry Christmas bud üòâ

That's not how this one appears to work. You have to earn the last one to start earning on the new one.

Awwww okay nvm then. Thanks

That is terrible advice for a new player lol. Dudes going to think walking over encumbered is normal üòÇ.
---
I do feel my 10 rocket turrets are wasted  just pounding on 1 molerat. They are pretty rubbish with anything bigger though like a scorch beast. Made of tissue and barely scratch it.
---
This is good advice but not necessarily what a new player should focus on
---
I just want to make a new character and I have no idea how I would respec
---
From my experience opening 300 of them in one go the rare taxidermy ones came out the least, still missing a lot. Santa crash and icicle lights came out fairly often so I imagine if you wont be able to shift the winter ones for much at the minute. The plasma grenade and tare taxidermy ones should sell regardless just from their rarity
---
Havent got the plasma grenade yet.
---
Yeah but if he got in a jam for caps he can always sell ammo and make out like a bandit.
---
You are the one who doesn‚Äôt understand what a clickbait title is lol. Sorry I upset you.
---
It's a ongoing subscription so unless turned off in your settings will buy the next months automatically when its due
---
I have two spare plasma grenade plans right now.  They are already promised to friends.
---
Im out of budget but if Bethesda ever increases the CAMP budget, ill be able to put up all the mounts ive gotten from Xmas event.
---
Unfortunately it's a one time deal. Only way is to do it over on a new character, or find a player vendor who is selling it.  I've seen them once or twice, not often though.
---
I feel you the tears of joy at finally having them no more bloody battle bot lol. Cant wait to build a mr torgue build ;)
---
Yes they do. They say they fixed it but it still happens, albeit less frequently.
---
My friend and I are both power armor builds (i use ultracite he uses x-01)and we went to a sbq event. We never had a problem before surviving the event and all the sudden this one started destroying us and everyone else. There was a level 222 and he died at least 3 to 4 times while we were there. We ended up just abandoning the event due to that. Tl
---
Wouldnt you die eventually from dehydration/starvation?
---
I'm going to go with NTA. Yes, you could be taking advantage of someone who doesn't know any better, but a lot of people leave them unlocked on purpose. I lock my Santatron but leave my water purifiers open. You come by and check out my shop, you get a free water (or 15).  I'm not at my camp often enough to collect then everytime they are full, and I just sell them to a robo vendor, so someone else might as well use them or sell them.
---
The rare stuff will probably move at those prices.  Especially plasma grenade plans.  People have been desperate for so long.  I agree that common stuff will just sit there at 5K.
---
Saw one this morning. Like other people have said though, any time there is a holiday event going on the frequency of nukes drops until its over.  Can always launch your own though.
---
 Be the change you want to see in the world!!  Or some such crap like that lol
---
If it‚Äôs unlocked I‚Äôm taking it, water, scrap, workshops, Santa 
---
I leave 2 unlocked water purifiers at my camp for people the rest are mine
---
I think its fair game if something is unlocked &amp; assume the same of its free to take, my mother has the santatron unlocked hoping people will take the stuff but no one has yet haha
---
Well you could always be like me with 66 chassis.. but nobody wants to do that lol
---
I use a gatling gun or plasma gatling, might not be the best dos out there but I make sure every limb is crippled
---
Yeah. Having the same isdue with scorched conquerors.
---
If I get more than 3-4 ganged up on me im pretty much spamming the stimpak button. Im level 263 full PA using Zealots prime explosive gatling gun.
---
Most satisfying is melee though, always see a bit of her health disappear each hit
---
Charleston capital building has tons of high level charred ghouls
---
I clearly just havent made it to her camp haha
---
if they're unlocked I guess they're free to take though people should be reminded that you can lock the terminal and the resource drop off of the station separately and need to make sure you lock the right one
---
That's great advice to follow. I didn't know they could be renamed until level 50 or so. Now they just say "Excavator PA" or "X-01 PA".
---
PC here üôÅ.

Enjoy the game!  üòÅüëç

If you're actually playing the game and trying to win then I don't do it.  Seems you're a selfish bush camper that can't get kills.  As OP said, turn team fill off please.
---
If you know her username, you tag with
---
u/enseminator I believe
---
Once the lock is picked you have to either remove the lock and replace it or pick a different level lock.
---
It was completely unavailable before this event and it's relatively rare even now.  I'd probably wait a few weeks after the event ends before you try to sell it since it'll shoot up in value.
---
Yes
---
I feel you on this one as a fellow PS4 player. The isdue I have is this "copying" process it does. The last update was like 541MB.
---
I can copy my phones entire DCIM folder to my PC (roughly about 30GB) faster than the PS4 can copy a 541MB update.
---
The CPU in the PS4 is great for gaming but sucks severely in the File Operations deparment.
---
Im just hoping Sony uses a more powerful CPU in the PS5.
---
Power armor + vampire weapons = really really good
---
Starwation won't kill you, so just keep some food+water+stims to restore when you are back playing.
---
If I leave things unlocked then I'm fine with players taking the resources/water or using the rooms I left unlocked. That's why i leave them unlocked.
---
If I lock things it means i dont want players taking stuff/going into the room.
---
I always leave my camp totally open, water is there to be taken, rooms are there to be used. But not my Santatron. That is locked and hid away in a walled up room.
---
nope, you will be left with 1hp
---
Oh. Didnt know that.
---
i leave my water and acid extractors unlocked for guests and would-be customers. Santatron is currently locked until event ends, but will be unlocked when it is over
---
I've rarely seen it nuked of late. Only place I see nuked is fissure prime.
---
I suspect this is simply down to the private worlds. Players will nuke Whitesprings in a private world so they dont have to fight others to get the ghouls. But they nuke Prime in public as it's always nice to get extra hands on deck for the SBQ.
---
In addition to what others have commented, here‚Äôs another recent post

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/edkhxo/new_player_needs_tips_recommendations/
---
Legendary Scrip.
---
Carry limit: 1000
---
Acquisition Limit per day: 150
---
Can only be used at the Purveyor located At Berkley Springs Train Station located in The Mire reigion.

---
I want it.
---
I do level 3 locks on things I dont want people to access.
---
only if they also add the vault girl hair too.
---
Exactly what I was looking for thanks!
---
And you can have workshops without someone else just coming to attack you because they want to be a jackass.
---
Pleasure
---
Too many dishonest shits in game for that.
---
google the quest rewards for new quests?  
---
Obviously for those in Beta and the first week or two it would have been harder.
---
I would buy the heck out of that if I don‚Äôt get it during the event. The death claw gauntlet is one of my faves.
---
The mod itself about 500 caps. If you had the plan 5000 caps.
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted; a lot of the rare plans used to go for 25-50k to rare plan collectors on the market sub before this event.  I'd say 5k is a bargain for them after the event ends.
---
(Ps4) I have 4 regenerating armor and a rubber band.
---
I know, right? Everytime I've put vendor items at 0 caps, meant for newbies...some high level comes along and takes all of it...I mean, do you really need chemistry bench plans at level 155? Or a level 5 modded out combat rifle? So I quit doing it and just drop that stuff randomly.
---
I‚Äôve poked plenty through the game data and files - there is nothing behind the Vault 79 door nor are there any cells adjoined to that door. As a point of fact, you can‚Äôt even trigger it to open and despite this it is configured to play a ‚Äòbroken‚Äô sound if this is attempted.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
The mod is so common I don‚Äôt really see the point personally
---
I plan my Fallout 76 life around Cranberry Relish &amp; regular sleeps :D
---
I figured this out at 80. And I have been using three different sets. This would have been great to know early.
---
Right, always a glorious hackfest üòÑ
---
I didn't...the first time through.
---
This man is pure evilü•∫
---
What I do is when I'm on public servers, I have fallout first so I'm on private servers a lot, I'll look at the map and find  the lowest player. Then get him or her in chat and see if they are in need of anything.  I actually made several new and good friends in game this way.
---
I found that I had to store the object and place it down again to put the lock back on
---
Oh I just forgot about them - no reason! Sorry about that!
---
Kill some scorched.  They ones dressed in red or blue are dropping presents :)
---
Thanks this did it. I found lowest lvl lock is usually enough to stop them from incurred bounties. My friends and I have found a killed a few wanted players lately after going through the game never seeing one
---
If you follow the main quests they will take you slowly through Appalachia. Enjoy and explore, especially the forest. Don‚Äôt go to the Mire or Cranberry Bog before Lvl 40 or so. Take your time, this game is built much more on exploring sites and lore than FO4 - and that rimes, so it must be true üòÑ
---
I set stuff for really cheap. Like 5 caps. For whatever reason it stops high levels from cleaning out your low level stuff for newbies.
---
Where do you keep those??
---
And I can exchange them for rng legendaries ?
---
i personally would like this, in theory. only if it A, could not be locked. B, was only able to hold 40 pounds. C, was not linked to stash box.
---
Oh but it sounds so good in writing just please dont fuck this up Bethesda
---
I have four sets of armour named T-45, T-51, T-60 and X-01.  All in Blackbird paint.  Hope one day I can display them in camp.  Only keep the x-01 on me and only use it for nuke zones and big jumps.  I‚Äôm more tanks these days in normal armour.
---
What we need is a container that we can set level restrictions on to keep high levels from swiping everything. I would love to have a box that can only be accessed by those level 25 and under. Would make giving things to new players so much easier
---
Don't forget to name one as AA-X01 or AA-Exca, so you dont have to scroll down your whole list to find it! Comes in handy when you FT to V9 or die in the queen fight and have to hop into your PA quick
---
it is a reference to the old Peanuts Christmas specials.
---

---
Some of my best weapons are lower level. I havent found anything better at a higher level.
---
The plan is very rare, the mod is common. Like what was said below I would save it until after the event is over. Give it a month or two and the event plans will get to be more scarce and much more valuable
---
Yes.  There was a way to get to the roof.
---
Ah yeah, I hadn't even considered that.
---
How do players go about getting those names guns 3* then?  Example I see a lot of different variants of The Fixer.  Is that a different thing or the same?
---
When you get there it will say "Legendary Ranged Weapon ***" and the cost is 100 scrip.
---
When you buy that the game will give you a completely random three star gun.
---
The purveyor also has melee and armor options avalbile as well as 1 and 2 star options.
---
100 caps is beyond cheap. I sell them regularly for 4K
---
So selling my useless legendaries like that level 5 mutant slayer switch blade for 4 caps to a prptectron is a waste then and I should get scrip instead?
---
I want a differant sight. Like the dot for example.
---
Have you tried logging into the game on a different PC?
---
This is the way
---
Absolutely
---
- Not linked to Stash box
---
- Not lockable open to all
---
Isn't that the cap? They increased levels?
---
When the controler disconnects it will get you
---
That would be great, but way to ambitious for Bethesda straight off the bat. We have a better chance of them giving us this first. We can beg for adjustments later. And they can say that will be 10 Atoms please
---
Odd. I have a 300MbPs wired connection straight to my PS4 Pro, with literally no other devices connected and this happens once a day to me at least.
---
Also followup question, I have a two star lvl 1 hunting rifle with +50% limb damage on it, I don't feel like switching it out for a lvl 15 version, is that a mistake?
---
You want to use the legendary scrip machines to get rid of legendaries. You get scrip from old legendaries.
---
These machines are located at every train station including the purveyor location.
---
I do but not as often as I'm farming fluxes and ws doesn't have much cobalt
---
Are you level 15 or higher?
---
Thats the question you have to ask. Legendaries are completely random from the Purveyor. You wont know what weapon youre getting.
---
When I used to play I couldn't give 10mm ammo away id always have at least 10-20k rds I tried selling it when vending went live I ended up dropping it on chest at the overseers camp and then server hopped and did it again cause I'd fill the damn thing up I kinda wanna play it again but they need to fix the problems first
---
NTA - General game etiquite consensus is unlocked equals gifts  for visitors.
---
I'm around 17 now I think so yeah I wonder myself if it's worth the gamble
---
army of vault boys incoming
---
Gotcha, will do from now on, thank you
---
I want a snow machine like the Halloween and Mothman machines
---
I will say that yes, it still gets nuked on public servers mainly for the flux. However, on private servers my crew and I were nuking and it was very reminiscent of the hordes/legendaries when the game first launched.
---
Was this pc? And the house looked like a temple? The flames behind wall displays?
---
Why not play FO4 instead lmao
---
Not everyone who has them are cheaters, I bought a few from various vending machines, not bothered about losing caps if they get removed, they look cool.
---
What do you have against the Charlie Brown Christmas tree?
---
It‚Äôs amazing how many players don‚Äôt realize this. My guess is they are either not American (though peanuts is popular everywhere so this is less likely) or extremely young (this also doesn‚Äôt make sense to me)
---
What that is the fur outfit???? I thought it would be made of bear etc like the rare outfit
---
It‚Äôs the reddit way.  I‚Äôve been going around of late just upvoting comments that have been downvoted - tis the season for giving!
---
And happy camper in (Cha?)
---
&gt;So there you go. Melee is laughable honestly and many of this hit detection problems i know plague melee users in Adventure mode too.
---
Should have the option to lock it to certain levels.
---
i play on PC with wired mouse and keyboard
---
yeah I saw that too when I was messing with my power armor yesterday. I checked atomic shop but its not there available right now
---
Want a bigger tree? There is a massive one in the atom shop
---
It works for sure. I use it on my VATS stealth commando. Combined with gun fu it procs quite a bit.
---
I am getting the same show up when I fix my PA but I have nothing to be able to use it, wondered where it cropped up from
---
At least it‚Äôs a fun band aid!   Just enjoy it!
---
Yeah I live in NSW Australia
---
Yes üòÑ
---
In my inventory, there's a perk at level 50 that lowers the weight
---
Today for sure fallout just flat out shuts down completely after just a few minutes of play
---
As long as you are queuing solo go ahead and afk. You aren't hurting anything. Please dont afk with a full team though. 
---
Also, you dont have to kill everyone to actually win. I won a game last night solo using max ninja tactics. Made it until it was just myself and 1 other. The circle was about 10ft across, snuck up and 1 shotted with a shotgun. 825 xp win with 1 kill.
---
Youre welcome.
---
It procs but you dont get the little notification like you did in fo4.
---
fallen trees, scrapping wooden weapons, piles of wood.
---
It is still in there.
---
Seems fair i suppose
---
Playboy Mansion - or the sawmill between Vault 76 and Flatwoods.
---
If you build a structure around your Santatron nothing fancy just floor four walls and a roof they can't touch it. A little annoying that ppl are breaking into them, but it is the wasteland after all.
---
Fallen trees? And piles of wood where are they usualy located i only have a few hours in game and i still dont know much of the stuff
---
on the redemption page there are 2 more bundles but they are blank and dont show anything yet so we will get more packs but they haven't been released yet. It usually takes a month for twitch to get new promotions so they will most likely release in January and February.
---
Game mechanics are much better in FO76.  Smoother
---
- and a new story
---
- and playing with friends
---
- and showing friends what you built
---
- and making new friends
---
- and making new enemies 
---
...
---
:)
---
there should be a lumber mill in the forest region. the bots there also give free wood samples, if you talk to them
---
Theres a playboy mansion? Haha im missing alot of stuff ngl
---
You‚Äôll find on a whole, the higher level players are usually willing to help out. Like myself at almost lvl110, I‚Äôve found that I have a large amount of resources and spare ammo. I‚Äôll happily make a low level weapon with some good mods on and give some ammo for free. Maybe a couple plans and some stims aswell. I don‚Äôt have the time to venture out too much, mainly just stick around the forest.
---
5k is reasonable. Caps are easy to get. Before this current cap sink 5k was nothing.
---
I like it :(. I don‚Äôt care about the armor / jacket.
---
This might sound crazy but FO4 is my personal least favorite Fallout. Which is why I wanted to improve it with mods buttttt Sony said lol funny
---
But... wwr perks, unyielding benefits... ap regen... being stuck in a tin can is the worst!
---
The woods are fall of fallen trees lol. Just run around the forest.
---
Yes, both of these would be a tremendous quality of life improvement to the game. If we can change our appearance on a whim, both of these options should also be available
---
Ye same, I googled it but couldn't find anything on it, guess it's a mistake
---
Ok thanks alot i appriciate it :)
---
you should make a video demonstrating this. it would help prove your point.
---
This is the real answer.
---
Try launching one yourself?
---
Mind blown on how this somehow never happened in Fallout 4, let alone 76...
---
i always unequip &amp; re-equip it at the start of every session. i feel that helps make it work.
---
Watoga theirs like idk beaver dams or something just shit ton of wood across the little creeks. I so wanted to say something inappropriate but ahhhhhh I'll save it for the old lady.
---
Yeah, I know those sellers could be victims of dupers themselves.
---
For me it's not about losing caps, more like...I don't know, I just simply don't want to show my acceptance for cheaters with buying items that are not meant to be in game right now. 
---
But I bet yours look awesome! :)
---
I use ! before all of my named gear
---
You keep the outfits, the icons, the emotes, the Atoms (but you don‚Äôt get more the next month of course), and the contents of your Scrap Box. You can‚Äôt add more to the Scrap Box, but can take out or use contents. You lose the Tent and your Private World, but can still join a friend‚Äôs Private World and use other people‚Äôs Tents.
---
These tend to be the same players who turn around and try to sell the Chemistry Bench for its default price somewhere. üòÇ
---
What? Haha
---
Oh I dont know I  had 2 two shot explosive handmades and sold both for 20k caps each over the past two months
---
I could see having vendor machine variants for level ranges.  That seems like the simplest way to do it, rather than having some user-definable level range.
---
It's not like the Vendor category is cluttered with stuff.
---
Find a camp with a container already there and just add a sign. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt persist between sessions but it works nicely for me.
---
When was the last time you had White Knight equipped?
---
If you are doing the challenge where you need to swim around the lake and there is a section where you can't swim through, stay in a crouched position instead of standing up an walking. By standing up you immediately fail the challenge. Give this a shot, it worked for me.
---
Two shot was broekn pre nerf so stop crying
---
I‚Äôve messed up the title, I need help with the reviving an ally in the water part!
---
Solar armor isn't power armor.
---
Anytime I drop anything from my inventory within the confines of my camp...it doesn't go anywhere unless I server hop.
---
I dropped like 20 spoiled meat &amp; some revolvers, teleported across the map, killed the queen &amp; came back an hour later. Bag was still there.
---
Ok gotcha
---
I ran into one the other day!  On xbox though lol but I was lucky and got out
---
I'm pretty sure it's one guy who got so butthurt months ago he just downvotes everything I post now.
---
Yes i want to create a character and form an identity. Having my username displayed really ruins the immersion especially when i want to play as a girl but charlie5842 is above her head.
---
I was born in Townsville (I'm a hybrid Brit/Aussie, live in the UK now), I remember living through Ash Wednesday when we lived in S.A as a little kid. Stay bloody safe yeah! I'm praying for everyone.
---
Armour is definitely breaking much quicker.
---
How do i know ?
---
I went through a period of virtually never having to repair my Forest Scout sentinel Armour.
---
After the last update i met 9 Super Mutants,5 with Mini-Guns near the Pumpkin House.,sure i killed them all.
---
When i checked my Armour which i always keep at 100% x 2 with "Fix it Good  3", i noticed all 5 pieces were at just 25% of the 200%.That was a lot of damage.
---
I have also noticed enemies are hitting with nearly every shot whether you are crouching in Chameleon or taking cover.
---
We all know how indiscriminate Mini-Guns are,shots going everywhere.........until a Super-Mutant uses one and every shot he fires hits you doing crazy amounts of damage.
---
I have also noticed my Ultracite Power Armour is now miles better than the X-01,the only piece of Armour that does not need repairing every 5 minutes.
---
*laughs in Nocturnal*
---
If it‚Äôs unlocked, it should be fair game. Although if it‚Äôs a new player, I‚Äôll leave it. As in low level if they are there or if the camps not very big or well designed, then I will leave the stuff.
---
Personally I‚Äôve locked my Santatron, in a small room behind a lvl 3 locked door, which is behind a roller shutter that I‚Äôve took the power supply away from. Which most of my turrets on my main base can shoot at aswell. So I think mines safe lol.
---
Wich retailer has is? I went to Flintlock and he does not have it
---
I have a bloodied melee i pull out the garage on special occassions lol, i know the feeling well. Missing out on damage with that luck perk tho, just put on fix it good and white knight when you need too repair üòÅ
---
So if you go on through the main entrance down the stairs and it's the 1st one the left
---
id only say to unnerf two shot if it consumed 2 bullets at a time
---
Well tbh, I prefer the charlie5842 to recognise you're a pleb and I now most likely know your ATM pin.
---
Use woodchucker and go to pricketts fort. There is one large wood pile, a slightly smaller wood pile and then small wood piles throughout. I usually end up with around 700 wood after one visit.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen a nuke in a while either
---
Playing an instrument seems to have the same effect.  Haven't tested with sleeping yet.
---
Currently there's just the right records to "make" it in the files, but the armor records and entitlement records for it don't exist yet. Like other people have said, it's a future atom shop skin.
---
As someone who works in QA, we're just As frustrated as you are. Trying to repro these kinds of crashes is extremely difficult sometimes
---
I only use the perk for the decrease in hunger thirst, not sure what its called. I don't think I use white knight. does that reduce armor damage? either way it still does not explain increase in damage, hunger thirst and I know I not only one experiencing this so there is a problem. Either that or its because I hit level 100 and some increase in armor breaking im not aware of. I go to white springs all the time, ghouls been chewing threw my armor.
---
I never ran with white knight before the last patch and never had a problem. Since the last update I've added two levels of white knight and while it's slightly better, I'm still breaking armor every session. They definitely stealth nerfed something. I run polymer scout and bos combat and always repair to 200%. There is no reason my armor should be breaking after playing for two hours.
---
ya since the last update I been crashing more and armor,weapons break faster and increase in hunger and thirst.
---
It's not about ammo, as I mentioned they lagged my game out big time. Kind of hard to shoot things down when you're trapped in a slideshow. xD
---
teleport
---
The book store?
---
Lol sure i put my real account name in there. Try using my pin
---
Names are fixed so your character is accountable for their actions.. if you could simply change your name to avoid being reported for poor behavior the community would eventually suffer.
---
I thought it had to be 20 different players for the achievement to be unlocked? Same as the atom challenge to kill 76 players.
---
Git gud, scrub.
---
Thanks. That makes me feel better!
---
I sent a discord request, it is the same as my PSN JonathanYoshee.
---
I sell a lot of junk, aid, chems, ammo, because I rarely craft and scavenge everything off a private world. I am also willing to buy from others in bulk (at low prices) to give folks some capflow to work with.
---
Yes very annoying for a mele build
---
I hope 5842 is not your pin number ... LOL üôÇ
---
a place i go to from time to time to get wood is at [Helvetia.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Helvetia?file=Helvetia_map.png) 
---
once you travel there look to your left down a road that has a yellow house. in the back of that house are some piles of wood. hope it helps!
---
Found it
---
I really wish they'd just dump item levels altogether and switch over to the way all the other fallout games handle them: weapon has base damage, change the receiver to change the damage, and from there it's all about your build and tactics (i.e. perks, SPECIAL, and maximizing on targets vulnerability to certain types of damage, and aim well)  
---
  
---
Think about it: the weapon you fall in love with at level 25, you can make just as viable at 145 by stacking perks, upgrading the mods each chance you get, and making sure to use it against targets that will take the most damage from it. Also... git gud at aiming. All in all, it is a good system that we ***KNOW*** works well because it's been working since FO3. This leveled weapons and armor garbage really ruins immersion for me, personally.  The idea that the same exact gun does 10x as much damage as one I found in an area with weaker enemies is stupid.  
---
Player levels make sense: you're learning things through doing. You're surviving a very inhospitable environment and learning how to scrape by. Even some of the sillier perks make sense as your body adapts, or you're mutated by exposure to rads... But a double barrel shotgun I find on a corpse in the starting area should do the exact same damage as an identical one I find deep in a deathclaw den. The only difference should be the modifications made to the weapon and *my* increased skill at handling it after several months of surviving the wasteland.
---
It's the PIN to his booth at the peep show...now you just have to locate it...
---
Phew i was starting to worry this game actually got fixed, thanks for reminding me that every day is a shit show for this disaster.
---
Everyone who replied helped thank you im a big noob in this game ngl
---
If that's the 1st 1 on the left as you go in from the main entrance then yes lol
---
you actually lose around 40% of durability from two shot and explosive combo making the weapons pretty brittle though
---
Its quite unpopular in europe actually
---
Good stuff so much easier
---
No, its was ps4... a little shack, with a garage door and a little window for the owner to watch people dying lol
---
Lol no why would i put my real account name here? I dont want anymore friend requests from random people
---
That will the first time I ask for refunds.
---
I don‚Äôt know I saw tons of peanuts books the last time I was in Italy, France and Germany.
---
two shot wasn't nerfed it was debugged - Two shot weapons did 125% damage x2 shots for a total of 250% damage it was supposed to do 125% damage total of 2 shots with 62.5% each bringing it in line so you did more damage against unarmored opponents but less against heavy armor
---
so before it was debugged - it did 250% damage + 100% more damage per shot from explosives making them so monstrously over powered
---
That said Assassin and Nocturnal need major overhauls and mutants should be scaled by number of mutations to bring it in line with similar concepts like junkies and bloodied. 
---
But yeah I can shred most things in under 5 secs with the gear I have now and its not even some legacy monster weapon so not really sure why we need to make them better.
---
That said.... Fix my damn shotgun bethesda......
---
Yes yes spaghetti coding is still shit one year later.  Out of many, many early access games i have played i have never seen one like Fallout 76 where patches causes bugs that are Alpha grade.  
---
Things in Beta are usually just triggers, polishing, enhanced product but honestly, Fallout 76 is not even ready for a Beta.  The inherent issues with the coding dragging core game features into the ground is actually amusing.  This game will forever be an example of how not to develop a video game.
---
Get above level 50 and learn how to make a mutations build. Thats the only way to make a great melee character
---
Two hours, right now, is a forking win. Forgot fix it good last time, less than 10min on my left leg (weakest durability I'm still using). Just so annoying. Specifically this after the bug where we took no armor damage (was fixed quick) just sucks, what a crappy swing of the pendulum.
---
i lock my santatron and my junk extractor but I leave my water unlocked, I don't mind is someone takes a couple water or maybe they need it and are thirsty. I always have 20 or so in my locker anyway. Some players don't know how to lock so they just leave it. I did not realize or know you could until like level 35..lol
---
Or maybe one that has timer controls on it.  "Allow players to take X items every Y hours."
---
So you might set up one with chems and stuff, maybe you set that to "Allow players to take 15 items every 6 hours".
---
Then another you set up with weapons, set that to "Allow players to take 1 item(s) every 24 hours".
---
The guy said he does this for *new characters*.
---
Go to challenges then character challenges while in NW
---
He'll die from just breathing, from walking around, from seeing a plant, from basically anything and everything real or not... Tamed animals are too vunerable to every type of glitch and bug that can kill them, and megasloths seem even more so prone to dying lol. 
---
Bethesda needs to treat tamed animals as any other built item and let us either Rez or repair them back to life... It's not like they do anything other than look cool and die.
---
Books are everywhere and nice gifts but we generally find peanuts quite a boring franchise
---
I am a Bloodied Build i ditched the 3 points in Adamantum Skeleton,under endurance ,i felt they were a waste of points  kept only Fireproof/Armour maxed out.
---
Under Strength i agree Blocker is essential for any Melee build.
---
Covert Operative/Ninja/Mr Sandman are all [useful.Ninja](https://useful.Ninja)  also works on my Sniper Rifle .It is how i know i have not swapped back my Cards when x 2 damage pops up,instead  of the usual 2.5 damage
---
Thx üëç
---
It would be cool if you could put items in, and every player who comes by gets 1 random item (if it was a stack of items, you would be able to set them into separate piles so they get 1 pile)
---
Love this perk fory sneak vats rifleman. It can keep you in gun-fu for the entire mib of ghouls.
---
dont you get crippled limbs a lot that way?
---
Ye cool, I knew that already just making people aware
---
Worked last night.
---
The name of the character wouldn't even show for that purpose. 
---
And (at least on Playstation) you can change your psn name. It costs $10 (I think) after the first time but it is possible.
---
Yup I got a 3 star level 20 robot chest armor and won't vendor it because some level 100+ asswipe is gonna steal it to sell.
---
From what I've seen online people have just got a friend to keep dying so they can revive them.
---
I try to check the char level. If it's a low level they may not know better.
---
I don‚Äôt care I just want a snow machine like the mothman and Halloween machines
---
Yeah except I don't think it's a bug in this case.  It's more likely they want things to break faster so you purchase repair kits.
---
Do you at least have some love for the beanie?
---
It reduces armor damage by 60% and decreases repair costs in materials by like half or more. Worth getting for when you repair
---
You nailed it with the mutation effect needing to scale!! I would love that as someone with every mutation
---
I've noticed it with fusion cores, too
---
I second this. Pricketts Fort first
---
The more it breaks, the more repair materials you need, the more materials you need the more stash box you need, the more stash box you need the more you need the fallout 1st membership and its infinite junk box... üòâ
---
Don‚Äôt farm -50 mobs. I scrip anything not max level or give away to some random with the right level. Easy.
---
For PVE, ricochet, in luck, is very useful for closing the distance on range weapon mobs without dying. Cook and eat glowing meat steak, very prevalent and +10% damage. There are several other foods that help and stack, so pretty easy to bump up your damage numbers for big fights. Keep an eye out for faster swing speed in any good/ok weapon, it is IMO the best legendary prefix for melee. Always mod your weapons and armor, makes them way more useful, especially armor. Even high lvl armor is crap w/o good mods.
---
When player vending first came out some dude had his vendors at the top of a long stairway. I ran all the way up and he was in is with chameleon waiting, as soon as I opened up his vendor he opened some sort of trapdoor and I fell all the way to my death at the bottom of the cliff his camp was on. His whole idea was rl to collect the junk from people who would visit his vendors by killing them and watching them bleed out. Fortunately I always store my junk every time I see a stash so he got absolutely nothing out of it but I mean what a dick move.
---
Pretty sure they had this exact thing on the atom store last week.
---
They already did that
---
Or some kind of container that is like a santa or collectron were new stuff is added every now and again from a select number of items from your stash that you choose
---
I have the skin for that already
---
What? This already exists
---
I highly recommend a party wendigo. Wendigo, neon O around his neck like a glow stick necklace, and a mirror ball hanging from each hand.
---
Extremely rare.
---
Definitely not worth the outlay in points. to keep permanently deployed That is just my opinion.
---
I run in Stealth with Chameleon and a Bloodies Meat Hook with extra Hooks.
---
The only time i was ever taking  Limb damage was at the Club House at Whitespring. when going in with a Bloodied Meat Hook.All i do now is put on my Ultracite Power Armour and go in with a Bloodied Fire Axe instead.
---
Nowhere else in game have i ever suffered Limb damage since dumping those points.
---
Plus  you can always swap out Adamantum Skeleton  with Fireproof.
---
On the ground fighting Ghouls use Fireproof, for SBQ swap out for Adamantum Skeleton.If you are using an explosive weapon use Fireproof etc.
---
At halloween many stopped by my camp leaving me some good stuff. I been giving christmas gifts as well. Lots of good people in the community. i pay it back and help and gift stuff. Im someone who solo's and does not group often. I was in toxic valley area and some low level guy was running from a deathclaw. he was trapped in one of those old houses using it as cover so i helped him take it down.
---
Don't forget to increase your intelligence... helps when trying to learn mods.... Berry Mentats üëçüèΩ
---
Ok the beanie looks cool but not sure it‚Äôs enough to take my attention from adventure mode
---
Are you asking on the private server ? When there is a disconnect it goes to a different server
---
If you are talking private then if you reconnect within 5ish minutes then you should land back on your server.   
---
If public then it is random just like everyone else.
---
As an aside as it happened to me last night, (private server) any workshops you had will still be running but your client will not know that until you revisit them.
---
I like Riomaki 's comment .. vendor machines for certain level players .. if you could see it in the preview it would be great early game when caps are precious.
---
I always find the lowest level player on the server, drop a big bag of stuff at their camp in an obscure location, then message or chat with them to tell them it‚Äôs there and they can keep it or sell it to help them out. 90% of the time they think I‚Äôm a hero but really I‚Äôm just in need of inventory space lol.
---
That is really weird there are quite a few magazines for it, hope your luck changes.
---
I would also like a stash box skin that looks like a Christmas present and a snow machine like the mothman and Halloween machines
---
You‚Äôre right. I was only thinking of the power armor one
---
At the top right of the map ‚ÄúSylvie &amp; Sons Logging Camp‚Äù the best and only place I get wood from.
---
Theres a clan called eatt that pull this shit and eat your cooked body they try to see who eats the most people xD
---
It's fo76, nothing works.
---
I always store my junk too Haha.
---
Armor sometimes acts like it's not being worn. Perks also randomly don't work. Fireproof would normally protect you from SB reeeeeeeeee attacks, but once or twice every circuit of fissure sites, it just doesn't proc and I take damage from them. Not to mention all the times I randomly get one-hit from a Scorched melee attack. At level 310-something, that shouldn't happen. And yet.
---
K.
---
Yeah that would work well, would definitely stop the problems
---
okay, will have to field test that myself and see what happens :-)
---
I usually just stand in the doorway at the club house, they are so many ghouls there that it becomes a traffic jam, so they tend to be easy too deal with, some 'nades also work out well when they come running.
---
btw, if you got a dense chest piece, do you still need fireproof?
---
The thing is on PC we don't have messaging
---
I have gone back to the same for the most part but yesterday crashed was back on a server in less than 5 and it was a fresh one, lost 6 workshops.
---
Ironic you played since beta and missed the exact week in which this skin was in the atom shop.  It will return next year or in some of their atom shop reboots.
---
It depends, if your game crashes or you have a momentary internet disconnection on your end, you will generally be able to get back to the same private server within a few minutes. If it were an actual server crash, then you‚Äôd start a new server instance when you attempt to go back in.
---
they may be grabbing it for alts.
---
Ohhhhhh yes.
---
I however love this game. Never had a problem. It's really a great game although there are a few people who take great joy in blowing things out of proportion.
---
You shouldn't NEED to use a certain perk to make the game playable.
---
You do get kinda attached when you give them names
---
i'd love to know how long they actually stay, because i've noticed this too.
---
with xmas decorations up, i often drop stuff near my tree for presents on the ground, lol
---
Modify your weapons for AP usage (hipfire) &amp; critical.
---
You'll notice it procing way more when you're not burning 1/5 of your AP per shot.
---
Tweaked Automatic, Aligned Barrel, Aligned grip/stock, dot/circle reflex, switft magazine, suppressor.
---
This would be so good. As you say, doesn't have to be snow that falls and lies on ground or anything. Just make it like the mothman/Halloween smoke machines - white smoke with snowflakes through it. 
---
Would be a great addition.
---
A few people... no the majority of people see what the game truly is a cheap cash grab where more focus it put in the atom shop rather than the game it‚Äôs self which is still a buggy mess not even any better than release
---
Yup 300-400 wood at that camp
---
I'm getting the increased hunger and thirst, but no issues with armor.
---
I have the perk that gives increased durability, but not white knight.  I'm wearing Marine armor, dunno if it's affecting just certain armor types.
---
In the meantime, it might be worth equipping [Lucky Break](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/perk=1211).  I have the weapon version, it procs pretty frequently.
---
Legit, I've been hearing about this issue all day and I'm scared to play it for now...
---
it's a bug, as it's not happening to everyone and/or all armor types.
---
i barely get damage to my armor, still.
---
My inner hoarder is happy with Fallout 1st
---
The game is a looter, shooter.  I read this to mean, An unlocked resource means take what you need, a locked one means pay the price for taking the resource. 
---
I locked my santa, everything thing else in my camp is open to whoever needs it. Once the gifts are done I will unlock it for anyone that needs the junk it collects.
---
If I have my stuff unlocked I intend it to be taken by anyone.
---
Exactly! And if anything it would take less code if that did so
---
Its their slogan: *the bug becomes the feature*
---
I had had it both ways on private server.  I get back on, workshops still in my name and rolling.  A few other times, everything was alive again for me to take the workshop.  The gamble is actually fun though, lol.  Stay filthy!
---
My camp happens to have a picnic table with a toolbox and I use it for that exact purpose or for dropping stuff for friends, it‚Äôs very convenient.
---
*taking notes* :-)
---
Yes, to both.
---
I'm hoping that with Wastelanders or a future update, most of these plans will be implemented in a more organic way. Like Plasma Grenade, Heavy Metal Armor, etc being added to vendors or taxidermy plans as a super-rare drop from their corresponding creatures, or associated with quests like Queen of the Hunt. 
---
At the same time, I'm glad the pool of plans is so diverse; it's a great range of camp decorations and equipment plans, and since they're not all Christmas-themed I'm way more motivated to try and collect them. Think of it this way: the reward table includes things players actually want as gifts.
---
Not even better than at release ? Did you play at release have you played recently lol, there are many things wrong with the game but that's utter bullshit also tried to watch that video but the dudes a proper bellend so could only watch 2 mins before the stupid fucking voice went through me  here's an idea for you play something you like and dont worry about shit that dont affect you also stop watching idiots that talk shit about the same thing over and over again, have a merry Christmas and a happy new year
---
I‚Äôd love to be abli to put limits on what people can take like: ‚Äú1 weapon per player‚Äù or ‚Äú50 junk items per player‚Äù, that way people can‚Äôt take everything
---
I haven't seen my armor break yet but my thirst and hunger seemed more.....but it has always seemed excessive since I mutated even with my class freak card on.
---
But we don‚Äôt have to live like savages.
---
You gotta break the game more, to make it look like you're fixing it later
---
Basically beating a dead horse. It‚Äôs been bashed a million times already. Let the community who enjoys the game and still plays it be in peace and not have there energy brought down by personal vendettas towards Bethesda. 
---
We get it, you and a lot of other people are unhappy and rightfully so. But there‚Äôs a time and point where you walk away and move on to other things you enjoy. There‚Äôs really no need to bring down the morale of those who still play the game and enjoy it every single day.
---
Bethesda is fully aware of the hate and anger and frustration of a majority of the community. At this point making 100 more videos and writing 100 more negative blogs about them won‚Äôt change there personal agenda. It‚Äôs a dead topic. 
---
For the sake of your own sanity, walk away and go enjoy something else. We don‚Äôt need more negativity in this world. Try putting some positive energy into the world instead. 
---
Cheers and Merry Christmas.
---
I played it and still play it have over 300 levels and played since beta through multiple updates and every time they fix something they take two steps back and fuck up adding bugs they fixed before
---
Someone found the forum the spawn hack originated from.
---
This is actually one of those instances where OP is not wrong and this can actually be done by those few, currently, in the know.
---
It's a skin of the normal bot, you have to scroll to the right
---
10 atoms? You mean 1000 atoms
---
Yeah. I made another NW alt to try dumb builds, and named him sh#tbox. Now his build is one of my favorites, and I'm stuck with it.
---
We're the only ones to see it, why lock it at creation?
---
Did you still need help with it?
---
Get 3 more then max out yhe caps on all toons. You'll get your 125k plus some pocket change.
---
I have heard the same thing, from people I usually have no reason not to believe. Be careful and use a private world if you can :/ Merry fucking Xmas...
---
Rdrd 2 does for me but.... i get your point
---
If you go to the collectron in the build menu and then press on the left arrow the santatron should be there. I'm not sure about the posters though.
---
I should hope that wastelanders opens a whole lot of new large building sets.  I just hope plans aren't limited by what faction you work with.
---
Yeah, but lets be honest: where would we find clean wallpaper, clean windows, patterned wood??
---
Very nice of you!  I always drop them water and diluted aid.
---
I lock everything, Communism is the very definition of failure.
---
I do my friend! Do you know the best place to do it so I can revive you?
---
What if people need it tho, take junk for example. Some people just need to buy everything you have since they need it
---
I use a paper bag right in front of my vendor.
---
You know what it is
---
I think I can jump off the top of my camp and into a pond and it should work lol I can hop on in about 5 minutes.
---
Ok i found it, omg this game is so bad made...
---
Sounds like a good plan to me! I‚Äôll be on in 5 minutes too, add me and invite me to your game
---
who says I want to get kills? I just wanna last. your preferred way of playing isn‚Äôt the only way.  the game is about surviving not killing. I think in your brain you think for some reason that your way is the only way or the best way, when it‚Äôs not.
---
Im with you. But lets wait and be real; dont let the hype overflow our minds. Its Bethesda our major "partner" in this case and... You know the rest.
---
I've been suspicious of weird stuff happening with my melee character. Things breaking more than ever.... Dying in two hits to things he shouldnt die from... Damage not registering... I don't know. And my game crashed three times yesterday.
---
Fallout 76 and Donald Trump have got to be the biggest headline magnets ever. People hate them so much that they can't stop talking about them. Go figure.
---
If you don‚Äôt have a fallout 1st membership. Ask someone on your friends list who does if you can come onto their private world and nuke White Springs. Offer to team up and share the goodness. You‚Äôll be shocked how many more enemies and legendaries you get without a bunch of randoms converging and running through it. If nuking and farming is your thing the fallout 1st membership is worth it just for that.
---
I ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù mine from whitespring.  Don‚Äôt tell the robots.
---
&gt;what is wrong with this game
---
It was made by bethesda
---
Then they can ask, my wall is filled with stuff for sale, people are always welcome to make an offer, but it‚Äôs just an example, i wouldn‚Äôt like it if i put a bunch of free stuff in a box and someone took all of it for themselves,
---
You can get a lot of wood at the gay bar.
---
I drop water and stimpacks and any known plans for camps.  
---
If they wave back first.
---
Ya. And these does not eat into our camp budget...
---
How the fuck can you blame ‚Äúthe game‚Äù just because you can‚Äôt figure out how to make santatron. By the way you didn‚Äôt buy santatron is was free
---
Yup. I had a set rhythm for them, and now I'm drinking and repairing around 30-40% more.
---
You don‚Äôt. Stop exaggerating.
---
That would be because before 2 patches ago, armour wasn‚Äôt breaking for over a month.
---
Right now, you kinda do. My stuff is breaking so fast, my hunger and thirst are dropping so fast, it's kinda not worth playing until it's fixed.
---
This is the perfect summation of why we don't get important fixes each patch. Everyone's posting on Reddit asking for things they want added to the game but don't realize it's already part of the game. Then the important bug posts get drowned out by all the noise.
---
It's almost like they released the game too early!
---
Sitting around AFK in a bush isn't playing the game bud.  If you want to do that then turn team fill off so the people you're queued with don't have you wasting a slot that could've been for an actually useful teammate that's actually *playing the game*.
---
Lmao Fallout on PC is such a joke!
---
Very Reasonable, even considering all odds. If you can get something for free, and it's a whole lot of whatever it is you need. Heck, sometimes i run into junk for sale. Buy it all and then only keep half or almost nothing since what i took was for someone else. This is a prime example of this situation, imagine someone seeing 10 flux for free. This person owns 100s of flux but a friend of him needs that type of flux to craft something, so you'll take it and give that flux along with some of your own to help out. So yes one person took all the junk, but you never know the intentions behind it. Could be for himself, could be for others. Maybe he even took it all to give it to lower level players himself, distribute it to make sure everyone gets an equal amount. 
---
Just like this particular situation someone can take all of what is for free and you never know why he took it all.
---
If Mutants were to be made equal to Junkies in terms of damage buff, then junkies would be made irrelevant. You have perks to mitigate the negative effects of mutations but no perks to mitigate the effects of addiction.  
---
I would be 100% down for this if they added a similar way to mitigate addictions. As it stands now, Bloodied has alot of synergies with perks and mutations, but the trade off is its low hp.
---
You need high strength.
---
perks like incisor, gladiator, martial artist, glow sight, bloody mess, nerd rage, fireproof.
---
My melee is kinda squishy out of power armor, too.  It took me a bunch of levels to find a chest piece that has 112DR.  Alas, the rest are only about 40.
---
If you use PA, motion assist servos add a couple of strength points.
---
Twisted muscle mutation.  Be aware while it increases melee damage by 25%, it aso reduces gun accuracy by 50%.  Makes it tough to take out things that fly.  Negative effects Of mutations are offset by class freak.
---
Healing factor mutation + vampire weapons.
---
There are more hackers on pc because it is much easier to do but there are definetely people who can and do hack on ps and xbox.
---
Yea, i am so squishy, i get flappy hands ü§£üòÇüòÅü§£
---
Good to hear tat. For me, today i have been doing alot of low level events. Once I receive 1~2 * weapons or armours (level 1, 5, 10). I mod them to max damage/resistance n gift them randomly to any level 1~10 that I see on the map. And of cos, gave them food n drinks. They will do their sneak/stand actions delightfully. Happy to see the act being appreciated.
---
Thats not what i mean, junk was an example, but i would not like it if i put 20 weapons in for free to give to random players and 1 person took it all to sell, junk was a bad example
---
you can‚Äôt get it through the head, you don‚Äôt dictate what ‚Äúplaying the game‚Äù is. you have your preference which appears to be aggressive, but others play differently. don‚Äôt think you understand, or maybe you don‚Äôt agree. either way does not change anything.
---
You have to leave, join a team, and then you rake the team into the server.
---
Had same issues.
---
I finally got the mothman taxidermy so I was going to go and give out free gifts on Christmas day but hearing this makes me dread the idea of leaving my private world.
---
Just speaking in generalities, wondering how the legendary effects the armor.
---
I had a completely out-of-this-world experience wherein I had got frustrated and listed all my best blueprints for 10 caps each just cause nobody had been buying anything for days and I said "Fuck it". This player enters my base (around level 120-ish), buys some blueprints, learns them and drops them back on the ground, having alerted my attention, to make sure I got them back. They also left some minor loot they didn't need. I reckon, such kind of good-willed conscious players could benefit from the crate you envision.
---
Guns on the other hand is more reasonable. Could take it to sell, scrip or give away just like junk for that matter. For junk i wouldn't put a limit but for a gun i would want that yeah
---
Do you not understand what the term AFK means?
---
The first day after they fixed the lack of presents drop, i had nothing - that was about the same time we started getting reports of people picking the locks.  I walled mine in, and am getting at least 5 an hour
---
Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve seen this myself. I run heavy metal armor. 
---
Some work arounds:
---
Water Purifiers - Build near water, and place on of these down. Depending on the size, you can get 3-5 water per while you‚Äôre out adventuring. An easy way to fix water shortages. 
---
Cannibal. 9/10 times, you can eat the enemies. Even one rank is enough to stave it off for a short time. Or, get rank 3, won‚Äôt need many enemies. 
---
Armor - Tons of guides on how to get ballistic fiber. You equip that to repair your armor, and only then. Makes it only take 1-2 ballistic fiber. You‚Äôll save it up soon enough. 
---
These short help you work around it.
---
I just want it to be actually free and for multiple players, but not free for 1 and have them all sold for thousands while they were supposed to be free,
---
Hate to break it to you, but, there was a gift box skin in the atom shop.
---
Not the bestvcolors, but my little blue and yellow gift box is highly visible.
---
Pricket's Fort with woodchucker, I get 300-400 per run
---
That's right decent of you too do. Every time I befriend a newbie one thing that never gets old is that they are blown away by the amount of items I have. Especially now that I have fallout first and junk has no weight I have in the thousands of different junk items. Its good to hear others doing the same.
---
What about adding a feature where you can't sell weapons you've gotten for free? You can only scrip or scrap them.
---
It never fails to entertain though, you gotta give it credit for that!
---
I bought it, even if its free, you have to buy it
---
Of course there are on console. The hackers, cheats and dupers on console are like the guys that knocks over the local liquor store compared to pc where they are more like organized crime syndicates. PC has the cartel version of hackers, cheaters and duper‚Äôs
---
Thats practically impossible, cause that would mean legendary drops and purveyor stuff, how could you make that work?
---
Oh nice, thanks. I‚Äôd been trying the same spot by Charleston Staton.
---
For all atom shop stuff....posters should be in wall decor (may need to scroll left to find your available ones) but sometimes atom shop stuff is under miscellaneous if not in one of 5he other categories.  My letters are in lights now.  It's there, just gotta find it.  It's fun for me to "find" my newest camp item, lol.  Stay filthy!!
---
lol pretty sure :) 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also check this video out, I made it for new players long time ago, probably dated, but still helpful.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFM98KfKWcM&amp;t=21s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFM98KfKWcM&amp;t=21s)
---
I assume it still means away from keyboard, if it‚Äôs changed then I dunno what the new meaning is. either way, if that‚Äôs their approach so be it, it‚Äôs up to them, and you are asking them to lower their chances of winning by going solo, just so you can raise your chance of winning. you see the problem? everyone wants an edge not just you
---
You can't make it work, and that's the thing. If they put it possible for someone to only take a certain thing out of a store. You can just switch characters and take it or ask other people to take it for you, there would be a barrier for one person. But not if you can combine it with others
---
I love how this event isn't chaotic (though I loved Halloween too) and opening presents only at my camp so I have several to open at once makes it feel like Christmas everyday.  I adore all the mounted head plans (still looking for mothman) but I read all unknown plans whether I ever use them or not, lol.  Stay filthy!! :)
---
I‚Äôm not sure what you would classify as the best bloodied weapon, but unarmed melee weapons such as the meat hook have more perks for them. I would look at captain noobs channel. He has a whole series for this
---
I've heard a lot of rumors about this as well.  Guess I'm just going to be using private worlds with "team only" on until it all blows over.
---
I do the same. Even 1 cap seems to stop it.
---
This is a disaster if true. At what point is Bethesda going to take hacks seriously on pc.
---
Well, no.  But we're also Vault Dwellers coming out after 25 years have passed, with fresh equipment and gear for fabrication, making new items from scratch.  So while I totally agree with you that more options for building are good, I don't buy into the view that everything we have in our camps should be dirty, grimy, or dilapidated.
---
Merry Christmas! ;)
---
Unless you have some substantiated evidence, this is just rumormongering like way back in the day, with the whole Trade UI Stealing Rumor.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a tough one since people go there all the time. The bot will spawn but die then not respawn.
---
Most melee weapons can be good. What you're basically looking for with a melee build is either
---
Bloodied, power attack, +1str
---
Or
---
Bloodied, swing speed, +1str
---
Those two are the best but I have a swing speed one that has reduced weight and still 3 shot scourched beasts without sneaking, adrenaline, or the endurance one that fives extra damage
---
B-b-but there was...  like just this week.  &gt;_&lt;
---
üòÅüëç
---
I can understand your point, like this is my side with role-playing. Yeah
---
Yes. I purposely leave my water unlocked so that people can refuel. I'm just happy you're visiting!
---
It's unlikely to be publicly released. The poster redacted their comment, stating that they don't think its safe to release to the public. Last i heard, they were going to ask that forum's moderators if its too malicious too post. Given the nature of the hack, it's almost definitely going to be deemed too malicious.
---
I have forum posts straight from the person that created the spawn any item hack as well as other hacks. Whether it releases or not is if the moderator on the site approves it
---
Yh but pvp is stacked heavily in the attackers favour at workshops that's how ppl like it
---
I finally bought a 1st sub so I can enjoy workshops without these 'tryhards' lighting me up with their explosive dev room guns, it's really quite relaxing to be able to take many if I want and run the defence events without threat of PVP hanging over my head.
---
Just don't like PVP now I don't have to.
---
He asked, we just have to wait for the response. If the moderator okays it, he may release it or may not. But what‚Äôs stopping someone else from releasing their own version, or stopping him from releasing it on a different site?
---
Ah thanks. I forgot it did that!
---
Wartime inflation of course.
---
&gt;no the ~~majority~~ minority of people
---
Sometimes when i see a little baggie with some treats in it, I usually take some. Maybe some ammo or junk but i always leave something in return, be it food or some armor or a weapon.
---
Yes, it works. I play a character that uses vats exclusively and it procs often enough that I always keep the perk equipped. If you want to know for sure, find a pack of weak enemies and watch your vats bar as you kill them one by one.
---
It would be nice if they either gave it a sound or let us edit our hub so that we could put the AP bar in a more useful location.
---
It becomes an obsession to some people and they just can't leave it be, they feed from the negativity like vampires.
---
My TSE handmade is still a daily user for me.  I like my primed FE handmade better but my TSE still holds it own out there.  I have no need to one shot things.  I enjoy the combat and using multiple clips sometimes.  At level 242 I have no problem with ammo and there is no enemies or challenges that I can‚Äôt pwn.
---
Well. I don‚Äôt have ANY Thirst/Hunger issues and I‚Äôm running with those kind of Perks. Nor due to White Knight am in having ANY kind of armour issues. 
---
One of my Scout limbs broke before I remembered I wasn‚Äôt running White Knight. 
---
But it was also a new acquired piece that I hadn‚Äôt yet repaired to 200% so, not entirely surprising.
---
Keep telling that to your self as the game is loosing players on a daily basis
---
that should really be a criminal act.
---
Was this removed? Hum... whay is rule 6?
---
That‚Äôs the only reward I want. It will look great in my wasteland mansion by the fireplace!
---
Again this is why a multiplayer game with any kind of item permanence and value really should not be built on the bones of a single-player game renowned for its bugs and with a wealth of modding knowledge kicking around on the internet, its bound to go wrong.
---
Also, compound that by having a bunch of important things be client-side and your in for some "fun"
---
At this point, I think the Fixers and Handmades are interchangeable, depending on Legendary effects.  The extra stealth boost and damage of the Fixer is nice, the ammo capacity and overall performance of the handmade is also nice.  I play both, and never have to buy or make ammo.  A couple pieces of weapon weight reduction armour (fully stocked handmades weigh more than heavy weapons)  is all you need and you can carry a couple of each and a sniper  lever action, and a melee (I prefer Pole Hook - low weight and power) and still have tonnes of room for farming.
---
I‚Äôve only made it to 2nd with this tactic. But the other 2 were on a team and had heavy weapons. I was armor less with a pump action. Still got one.
---
I‚Äôve just put an Xbox voucher towards 1 month to try it out because I heard about the Xmas themed survival tent and that‚Äôs what swung it for me, it looks great lol, but I went into a private world today just pottering about taking workshops and gathering junk and it was thourally enjoyable, I‚Äôm planning to stockpile crafting/repairing stuff in advance of wastelanders so I don‚Äôt have to waste time gathering when there‚Äôs questing to be done. Prob be something I dip in and out of though when I‚Äôve got cash to splash
---
Same
---
That would make the game smaller, shorter, etc. The crusade looking for perfect max level weapons and armor is all you have left after launching your first nuke.
---
Before the update that made it so armor took no damage at all, my metal and scout armor needed to be repaired once every 10-11 days with White Knight 2. 
---
Since the update to "fix" that bug, I'm playing the same amount, running White Knight 3 and repairing everything once a day at least. Same with weapons and my character is forever dying of thirst. 
---
I love this game but it can be frustrating as hell.
---
If you need to lock your santatron shit which happens to exist only in a videogame and which also happens to be a free element you got because Christmas, but you like to take things from other players, then, you are a Scroogey bastard. 
---
It's Christmas. If you can't share free (and renewable) resources during a videogame event at Christmas, I can't imagine how generous you must be in real life. 
---
Feel free to loot my santatron. If I wanted your gifts I would just lockpick my way into them and you would never recover them because they are AID and not JUNK. 
---
Merry Christmas.
---
Because I would like to do it this way
---
Old bug
---
Monster Mash is ‚Äòuseless‚Äô?
---
Okay, pal. It‚Äôs usually about 4/5 of a level bar for me, if not more. Constant influx of mobs that if you‚Äôre specced right you can one-shot. Plus a ton of scrap and usually about 3-4 legendaries. 
---
Useless, lol.
---
You really should check this one out: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ado8x1/i\_built\_an\_oven\_and\_then\_roasted\_players\_alive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ado8x1/i_built_an_oven_and_then_roasted_players_alive/)
---
What are you looking for specifically?
---
I think the last thing I purchased with atom points was the death claw hide. Thing looks really good in my living room in my camp
---
Any power armor that isn‚Äôt raider, I want to have like full suits of every pa if possible.
---
I mean they're both shit. When a game series that people loved gets turned to shit by a developer, or when the presidency is bastardized by a piece of shit, people will, rightfully so, call them shit.
---
Thanks a bunch! ;)
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
If you were on ps4 I  could give you some t 51 power armor
---
I've been doing this for ages. Build at a location that has a container, ie. an ammo box or something, and build a sign above it to indicate to visitors what the box is for.
---
Bethesda would love it if we walked away and let them continue to exploit their fan base.
---
Oh, I‚Äôm on Xbox. Thanks for the offer tho. ;(
---
It's a shame no one knows me as Dirty Andy.
---
I'm jealous, but I don't want to move my C.A.M.P :)
---
This works and now I'm going to try some &gt;5 gifts for some missing armor plans that unlock at that level and then &gt;15 for some missing PA pieces that unlock.
---
I pulled 2 plans on my high level main after who knows how many gifts, 100s easily.  Pulled 2 plans in my first 10 gifts on my sub level 5 and 4 in 30 gifts overall.  Your mileage may vary.
---
You enabled it. You didn‚Äôt buy it. 
---
But means ‚Äòto obtain in exchange for **payment**‚Äô
---
You didn‚Äôt pay, so you didn‚Äôt buy. 
---
You enabled it or activated it. 
---
If you‚Äôre going to be pedantic, you have to be accurate first, kid.
---
The game also is bearly functioning since a year... I also Bethesda kinda Lied to us because let's get real when we ask for private severs for example no one ever imagined that half assed shit they threw at us
---
Well good news is you get a full set of ultracite through the main quest and also get plans to make excavator and x-01. So it sounds like you just need the other 3. I would head to watoga for the t-60. There are a ton of sets around that you can pick through.
---
Thanks, Bethesda!
---
What do you mean it‚Äôs barely functioning?
---
It‚Äôs still here for me
---
Barley functioning like in I still run into a bug every damn time I start this game again that ranges from smaller ones to nearly game braking ones. That's not acceptable for a game that has been out this long
---
The post says it was [removed].
---
Strange.
---
I'm sorry you feel that way... I did give examples for other legendary buffs, bloodied is a typical one that a lot have strived for. Your bitterness does seem a bit unwarranted, but I guess your entitled to your opinion.
---
Though, your sarcastic "remove everything else from the game" might be a bit over the top, as there are a lot of other substantial builds out there, especially one dedicated to heavy weapons with power armor.
---
I particularly like not wearing PA...
---
But let's keep it constructive, what exactly do you think would help enhance Fallout 76 that would help boost weapon and armor crafting other than raising the level or adding legendary add-ons?
---
Because Nuclear Winter is the priority and Bethesda is garbage.
---
You're forgetting miles and how that can be exploited. Interesting idea,  but it would be terribly executed.
---
Welcome to the Bush wookie life.
---
i took advantage of double xp weekend and got 3 new mules to 50
---
Don‚Äôt buy the repair kits, I‚Äôm level 65 now and could always repair everything from normal to legendary with regular junk and some looting efforts - or just being patient.
---
Mire and cranberry bog is where I'd head if you're soloing I'd server hop near super mutant spawns you can handle, seem to give the most exp to me. 
---
Also if the mothman event pops near 76 do that as well gives an exp buff.
---
West trek mostly everywhere else is mostly obsolete.
---
i love how you take 1 single example, and just pole vault off the bridge with it
---
would you still be pitching a fit if OP said nocturnal or TS, or RW as examples?
---
Whitesprings
---
I run westec with friends usually to get lvl 60s to spawn, get one hit and have them kill it. Look out for unyielding armor to boost ur intelligence for 3% more xp per also.
---
Which is why I didn't suggest the concept of learning to continually apply it other pieces of equipment. This way, you have to keep questing to always upgrade the legendary on your armor. So, if you want to put a legendary buff on your equipment, you have to work hard to get that module, for each piece of equipment.
---
Could open up for more achievements, one for applying a legendary to a piece of weapon or armor or both, applying a legendary module up to 3 or 5 stars (if they implement 5 stars), and so forth.
---
Allowing a player to "learn" a legendary buff to apply it to armor/weapons would make it easy for hackers to dupe it, sure... Unless you adopt the bind on creation or whatever. You can buy/sell anything in Fallout 76, so they would have to create this system. My suggestion wouldn't require this type of change ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Really old bug. The only fix is to load in to adventure mode when you first start playing. And then log off and get to playing NW.
---
I would love this as well - my solution has been having one vending machine set up with just free stuff &amp; using one of the letter plans to put ‚Äúfree‚Äù on the front!
---
... more greed
---
I'll pvp you
---
Well... I do remember some fresh things in there, but not construction materials..
---
So, collectron?
---
It is a darn shame that there are those that focus on one particular thing. Thanks for your insight, I did give examples of nocturnal and assasin üòâ
---
I don't hold it against peeps for their opinions, I like discussing to absolutely improve upon a game I've slowly grown to like üòè
---
I can create them let me log on and look
---
Ah finally I can be known as ‚ÄúNicholas cage‚Äù
---
Maybe Its made so that People would buy More of those repair packs..?
---
4 would absolutely crush the loot pool and kill the fun in finding weapons.  If you implement 4 you have to add 4 or even 5 star weapons to counterbalance.
---
Supposedly it doesn‚Äôt rely on trading.
---
Forgot to send link  there is a video on it by tks mantis
---
This is good
---
They removed it? Still shows for me
---
Please... Get this to Bethesda cause this guy is for real. I played him in Nuclear Winter and this is a different kind of cheater. The game would start, and five to ten seconds later the whole lobby would die at once. He could pull weapons in the waiting lobby, fly in the air, etc. He was essentially telling the game what to do, and it was doing it. I don‚Äôt doubt he has the capability to do what he‚Äôs bragging about either.
---
i just tagged Beth....
---
Thanks for linking video!
---
Video proves nothing, just a guy talking about it.
---
There is enough there to sleuth to more info though, which seems to confirm.
---
Yeah I saw I‚Äôm just adding my two cents for if/when the community mods get here.
---
I never see it active. It‚Äôs usually just good old Tea Time and Swarm of Suiters every 15min
---
You're poster #5 in the last 30 minutes or so to point it out.
---
Better off telling BGS, it's known here.
---
K thanks for telling at least everyone here knows not to go next week
---
Oohh ya I like that.
---
yeah, added the link since it contains a bit more info ..
---
Why would you want the details getting out?
---
There‚Äôs a mod like this for Fallout 4, so it would definitely be possible in 76 as well.
---
Well, at least Beth will sell a lot more subscriptions to fallout 1'st in the next few days üòÇü§£üòé
---
Don‚Äôt say you‚Äôd pay atoms that‚Äôs how they‚Äôll justify charging $10 for it
---
Stop, we've heard about it over and over for a while.  All you're doing by making it public is spreading the information.
---
Can you report to Bethesda and name names there?
---
Sure, I‚Äôm all for calling out pieces of shit but it gets to a point where it‚Äôs a borderline obsession as mentioned above. A little weird.
---
Yeap I want this
---
I thought this too but I sincerely hope they don‚Äôt think that lmfao... cause this shits gonna do way more hurt than help for them.
---
I have seen several people do that.  It is the best work around until Bethesda offers a solution.
---
huh ? what i meant is that there is a bit more info in the video for Beth to check out...
---
Was this on ps4? If so that dude mugged my junk while i was trying to buy an item...
---
He‚Äôs already been banned once and he‚Äôs making a new account to do this. This post is to warn the PC community as I‚Äôm sure Mantis has already sent something to Bethesda personally.
---
You‚Äôve heard it over and over yet I made the first post about it and it got removed. I‚Äôm WARNING people. Do you see me linking the post to the forum? No? Then I‚Äôm not spreading it, jackass. Leave it to the articles to spread it like last time. People need to be prepared for what may happen!
---
I wish. Whole lotta junk in my stuff
---
So you are resubmitting to get removed again? 
---
So are you looking to get banned?
---
yeah, i will keep my characters on private until we know more :/
---
Things are definitely not worse, there are still issues but it is better than launch
---
There is always one outside a building at white springs golf course. Two story building next to a robot patrolled entry to golf course. Backside of the building beside a door. There is always a glowing ghoul inside even when it's not been nuked. You'll know it's the right building then. Or ask a higher level to craft one for you.
---
Isnt spreading info a good thing?
---
Just to piggy back, I'm the same. I died several times to mire lurk Kings in wendeigo cave and my armors still in good condition.
---
I couldn‚Äôt care less about being banned. The fact mods removed the post without telling me or saying anything about it is sad. They leave up posts regurgitating what I said, so I‚Äôm making it again. People need to know
---
Is there a perk required to craft higher level blunt weapons?
---
Thanks I‚Äôll try that out!
---
This and The Cage Armor/Spiked Cage Armor are on my top wish list.
---
I love how inflation hit everything to insane levels except newspapers that still show a $1.99 on the kiosks
---
Makeshift warrior to craft melee, but I think you would then be able to craft whichever level you need.
---
Got to make your money back wasted on 76 some how!
---
What rule did you violate?
---
I already have makeshift warrior and still can‚Äôt craft bats. Can only upgrade owned bats.
---
Chugging water like fucking crazy!
---
Warning about exploits without any kind of proof is against the rules...but I'd assume linking to information about how to use the exploits would be as well.
---
Make sure BGS knows, and you can try to post warnings, but it's a fine line to walk.  Don't blame the mods, they're upholding the rules.
---
Honestly, after looking at the video(s) posted, I would be surprised to see them all nuked.  There's nothing obvious, but it's not hard to get from the videos to the actual exploit code, which isn't a good thing to have floating around.
---
No clue. They didn‚Äôt say anything
---
Warnings are good.  Spreading working exploits is bad.
---
When they delete a post it auto tells you which rule you violated. My guess is click bait title (rule 6). Or witch hunting (if you listed user‚Äôs name)
---
Well judging by what you said, the hackers are exactly what we all thought they were, pathetic losers who jerk themselves at being the biggest incels on the internet
---
u/Valseek  
---
u/BethesdaGameStudios_
---
Hes not linking the exploit or telling people how to get it tho
---
And anyone interested in reproducing the hack, which I've already located by looking at the video.  That's not a good thing to get out.
---
I could definitely link to the post but I don‚Äôt want it to spread. It‚Äôs already been seen by everyone that followed the article links to the spawner. I could easily post screenshots to show what he‚Äôs said if it‚Äôs necessary
---
Welp guess I‚Äôm gonna be anti social on a private server
---
Complicit, look it up...then apply it to the people who run these FO76 reddit pages.
---
Sorry PC players, this is seriously un cool.
---
Well all I know is my post is gone and they said absolutely nothing about why it‚Äôs gone
---
Whats his username (PM me to avoid the witchhunting rule)  
---
Lets get some bethesda.net tickets sorted
---
How about an opt in system, where you have a beacon or something that means you're viable to be attacked?
---
That's because you are the OP, the rest of the world can no longer see this post in the overview, the direct link to the post only shows.
---
&gt; Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/fo76.
---
&gt; Moderators remove posts from feeds for a variety of reasons, including keeping communities safe, civil, and true to their purpose.
---
It's sneaky.
---
You should have received a message when it was deleted. Are you sure you didn‚Äôt get anything?
---
Lol. Kinda makes you glad that we didn't get cross platform play after all.
---
PC shitstorm aside, this has been talked about for a while so far but no proof has ever been shown of the hijack happening only claims. Since items are stored server side, a player would likely just need to log off and all items would be returned when they log back in making this annoying duping exploit not player theft.
---
Just get the plan for it
---
The video has enough information to get to the forums easily.  I got there easily, and have seen the 'code' to do this (or something convincing enough to fool people, I can't tell which).
---
If it's real, the working exploit is now easily accessible to the largest player forum in the world.
---
You might be able to find plans at a robot vendor. I dont remember because I never use bats. I find them frequently though. You might check through the vendors in whitespring
---
Don't play the game anymore but if this hacker can really do this he could make the game more fun by adding goofy shit into it, but no he just *has* to be a cunt and remove peoples loot
---
Yup. No messages, and only notifications are from people responding
---
He's linking to a video that leads you there, it really prevents about 0% of the population from figuring it out.
---
I leave my oil extractor unlocked no reason to horde it when it produces it faster then I can grab it and it caps at five so there's really no point same with water because come on really.
---
You need it you take it.
---
Plus I fill a punch bowl with excess booze.
---
I also don't lock away any of my workbenches either.
---
I didn't know.
---
I haven‚Äôt linked a video, other people are making posts with the video
---
Happen to know where those plans are?
---
Because the sooner it's out in the open the sooner its delt with. 
---
If it stays hidden and no one speaks up then bad actors get extra time to play with there toys. Its one of the core tenants of security. Public disclosure exists to prompt companies into fixing their shit with the knowledge that if they don't then people will take advantage (they would anyway even if it wasn't made public except only the person who found it would know about it) because time and again its been shown that if the costs of keeping it covered up are less than actually fixing the issue it doesn't get fixed.
---
If your worried about it happening to you stop playing for the time being until its confirmed one way or another.
---
I wouldn't go that far. PC is very easy to secure and making hacks of this magnitude is virtually impossible in any other high budget game. 
---
This is Bethesda's incompetence, not a PC issue.
---
Bruh I haven‚Äôt linked anything at all
---
u/ladydevann, u/valseek &amp; co don't care or acknowledge this.
---
About 6 months ago I contacted them about their foolish "protection" where they just look for 3 processes and whitelist system-dll.
---
I received neither a reply, nor did they make any changes.
---
tbh, with this latest "script" there is no reason for any high level with any good gear to play anymore. The danger of loosing everything is just too great, especially with the shit they call "CS".
---
Apologies then, I'm not not able to keep up with who's doing what while I look through all this, check various other leads, and play the game all at the same time.  I'm just trying to help deal with the situation (badly).
---
That‚Äôs so corny lmao
---
No worries, not your fault, it's hard to keep up with everything right now.  I know your heart is in the right place.
---
I'd bet 5000 ATOMs they're mouth breathers from the whole "New Vegas is the only Fallout game that doesnt suck WAHHH" shit that made the main Fallout subreddit unusable in the months leading up to release, and making this subreddit a shit show for months and months until a majority of them finally found something better to do.
---
Lonely vindictive nerds are the fucking worst.
---
It‚Äôs all good. Some YouTuber decided to make a video on it but I don‚Äôt know what it entails
---
No written rule was broken, as it's a straight c&amp;p you can see it for yourself.
---
The post got removed by hand, citing 
---
&gt;Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/fo76.
---
Moderators remove posts from feeds for a variety of reasons, including keeping communities safe, civil, and true to their purpose.
---
which imho is pure bullshit.
---
Did you just get a lot of downvotes and auto removed? If the mods removed you would get a separate message telling you your post was removed. If shows up as a PM.
---
This is creating bad actors, not preventing them.  Even the people working with this stuff didn't want it going live over the break, but that's gone to shit now.
---
And I understand more than a lot of people that BGS won't act until it's an emergency, but *creating* the emergency isn't the right steps to take.
---
I don't think yours is...every thread trying to squash it...just swipe down and ignore if it bothers you...
---
OP would get the specifics about which rule was violated. You are not the OP. Have you ever gotten a post removed?
---
I wouldnt bet against you in that wager because i'd lose, I had to un-sub from r/Fallout because of those people, i've never seen people so full of their own self loathing in 1 place
---
I find heavy weapons last ridiculously long. Probably about 5 hours of play with an unmodified gatling plasma and it's still at half durability
---
My guess is Rule 7.
---
Do not post rumors or leaks without actual evidence. Second-hand information or word of mouth does not constitute as evidence. If you have evidence, you are welcome to submit it, in confidence, to the unaffiliated moderators for verification. Only upon moderator verification can you post it.
---
What op wrote
---
¬´¬†So apparently there‚Äôs been a thing with cheat engine that allows you to rob a players inventory. Now, a script may be releasing on Christmas to THE PUBLIC that will allow players to completely clear out your inventory, just by being with in 4 or 5 foundations of you. You can also send messages to the server to insta kill everything.¬†¬ª
---
Apparently and may de releasing..is rumours without evidence
---
Actually I need the good grief trophy too. We both can help each other.
---
I'm not against getting the *warning* out, I'm against publishing the actual exploit, which is what's ended up happening here.
---
A message is only sent when the automod was involved (and the sub hasn't modified the script).
---
Removing a post by hand does no such thing.
---
Also very plausible.
---
I usually run it once every other day. It doesn‚Äôt pop as frequently but when it does unless I‚Äôm in the middle of something else major I head over. 
---
It‚Äôs always worth it.
---
Psn is Twin_Fang_Valfax
---
I'm hoping that with wastelanders raider missions you can get some more raider centric perks though this might come with the legacy system requiring a level refreshing.
---
Yea ok whatever you say.
---
I'll be on in 30 - 40 min if that's OK. I'll add you
---
Maybe they making the game a bit harder for all the milk drinkers
---
Sure
---
They said no less than a year after launch (which means mods will come more than a year after launch).
---
Craft a higher level one after finding the plans, or get someone to make you one. Scrap all the ones you find for some plans. The best one I‚Äôve made so far is an allstar one. Are you on Xbox? I would gladly craft you one when I‚Äôm next on
---
Thank you for the head's up on the fix!
---
Yeah but the last time I've had to deal with anyone hacking in a game I was playing was halo reach back in the day. So my PC is just for exclusives and singleplayer games where the ability to mod them to the high heavens makes it vastly superior.
---
Scrapper and woodchucker cards since they didn't feel like making lumberjack power armor apparently
---
# AWESOME!!!
---
Read further below where I answer your point.
---
But to answer your question...
---
Yes. I tried several times to show exactly the crux with how the protection is failing in fo76. The post itself did not go against any written rule here, yet it was silently removed.
---
I am not the only one who has had this experience, and this is also not the first time it's being talked about. But neither the comments or posts about this moderation will live longer than a few hours at most.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/)
---
You don't have to believe me, just get involved in moderating a sub, you'll see the scripts and the difference.
---
They don't care to fix this issue because they know it'll sell more Fallout 1st subscriptions.
---
Dumping things on railway stations are lost forever if the server crashes, persistent boxes would be better!
---
For a small fee of just $12.99 a month you can protect the items in your inventory in a private world.
---
Bethesda is going to make a killing on all of the new Fallout 1st subscriptions.
---
Why is this being down voted?
---
Unfortunately I‚Äôm on ps4
---
If this is true then Yong Yea will cream his pants
---
That guy likes the way his own farts smell.
---
Same. It was so obnoxious and pathetic. 
---
It's funny though, since the 76 release they all randomly decided to see Fallout 4 as an amazing game. Guess circle jerking on 1 title from ages back proved to be really dull for discussion. 
---
Give it another 5 years and they'll finally realize this game is great too. Just have to wait until no one gives a shit about their edgy contrarian views to finally let themselves enjoy something. That or waiting until development has slowed so they can say "well its finally playable now that its complete, i dont understand gradual MMO development and you cant educate me on it because I made a snap decision years ago and I need go stand by it, hurr durr."
---
So when will hacking become a crime?  They need to set an example so these sad twats think twice about messing with other peoples things.
---
Has he ever made a positive video about anything
---
[deleted]
---
Come on bethesda just ban them all already
---
You could run through the main story with 15 intelligence +mentats, inspirational, herd mentality, and egghead with a friend sharing starched genes add xp pots and well rested bonus before turning in quests
---
Of course.
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn.
---
And unfortunately, FO76 is made out of paper mache.
---
&gt; Make sure BGS knows
---
Oh, they know. They even got the code to kill these recent exploits, for free I might add.
---
Same problem here. It's insane how fast it happens.
---
Fuck it: ErectusDeletus is his banned account. He‚Äôs making a new one I believe though so it‚Äôs kinda pointless unless they have his IP. They should really issue IP bans cause no one is going to buy a second PC for Fallout 76... 
---
Unless they‚Äôre making thousands selling duped items on eBay *cough*
---
If you have to ask, I'd hold out for something you really want.
---
Well, with good perks you can buy large for around 1450, the medium for 720, and the small for around 360.  The chemist perk gives you two when you craft so half of those values is the max I would think you can get, maybe slightly more.
---
If these are gifts you got from drops they actually have a slightly worst chance for all the different items so I would imagine they're worth slightly less.
---
Like I've said before.
---
I can't think of too many things more pathetic than being a hacker who devotes all their effort to attacking a critically-panned game that a small number of people play.
---
It smacks of not being able to cut it in the big leagues.
---
I would be happy if my camp could serve as a free fast travel point for other players and was notified as such on the map. The game could subtract like 10 caps every time someone used it, which is fine since caps are so easy to acquire. In return, they would be visiting my camp!
---
This is on Bethesda, dude. The game essentially has zero anti-cheat to anyone who knows how to change a file name. But I agree the hackers are also lowlifes.
---
I have a full set of unyielding that is level  5 or less.  That works really well combined with relish, etc.
---
In his "profession," there is no profit in positivity.
---
if you‚Äôre on today HMU on Xbox live Unflappedcheese I want in on some Nuked action
---
Effectively it's already a crime, but you'd need the actual authorities to care enough about a game to try to prosecute it.
---
BGS could go after the hackers in civil court, which has proven to work at least occasionally, but it costs money to do.
---
Gotta admit the prydwen was funny to see, but this is going too far
---
I‚Äôd fill it with .38 ammo for newb players.
---
I did not know this was a thing going to have to log on
---
This post was removed for violation of rule 7 it looks like.. says right at the top

Your new post was removed too

I see this post was removed for violation of rule 7
---
IPs are useless, only a fraction of the players use static IPs and those who do this make sure they don't use IPv6. And even then, a VPN will hide the real IP.
---
Yes - I‚Äôm so glad we got the Santatron for free. I need a constant junk flow and it fulfills this task pretty good. But I would like to know if the collectron is worth buying when I got the santatron.
---
If you want a non cosmetic thing then you should also consider the fridge.
---
I do that already with my vending machines and there‚Äôs always one person that takes it all. Usually the first person that notices it‚Äôs free.
---
So you are going to link you own video ? üòÇü§£
---
Because there are idiots that say that the vid doesn't prove anything.
---
Yeah I forgot we live in 2019 and you can just change your IP. Time to make an example out of someone with your multi-million dollar lawyers, Bethesda.
---
But that‚Äôs not *fair* to the lower-level players you see. Just because you‚Äôve put in the hours and hours of effort to gather materials, gain xp, and kill legendaries, plus built add-ons, that doesn‚Äôt mean you should have any advantage in the game.
---
I hate PvP they ones I encountered are 1st members just after loot so they kill me and get days worth of grinding and if I kill them they no longer have any junk but it's rare to even kill them as they travel in packs
---
They'll hate this game until the next fallout comes out, then that will be the worst game ever made blah blah blah and they'll remember the good old days on 76
---
I can only craft level 40 ones (no higher, no lower).  Not sure that applies to drops, but it's possible.
---
I hate PvP but can't afford 1st right now
---
What does that do?
---
If someone is actively going out of their way to hack into an online service and remove other individuals digital content, it's on the hacker.  They need to make an example so people have a reason not to listen to their inner scumbag voice.
---
how you get these mothman statues :o i need to know!
---
On modern consoles we don‚Äôt usually have hackers so it‚Äôs really nice
---
No, but I'm experiencing a weird issue with phantom inventory, where I have duplicates of all my weapons and armor showing in my inventory. They don't seem to actually be there, because I can't dump them in my stash, but it's annoying when I'm in the pip-boy.
---
Rule 7
---
Yeah the sawmill has robots that give you wood if you interact with them it‚Äôs pretty cool
---
I haven‚Äôt encountered that bug fortunately
---
This game needs to be like Destiny 2 on PC. If you even open the game files in any way, or alter them in any way = INSTA ROBOT PERMABANNED!!!!
---
Wait why don‚Äôt we have a crate that destroyes what ever gets put in it or keeps what ever we need inside it or a trade box where what ever iteams that you want are your level and everything that‚Äôs your level is something you can get
---
Np I'll be on in couple of hours. üëç
---
Super cool, but I hope they know to be careful with rad healing after mutation serums. If they‚Äôre low level enough to not have starched genes yet, they‚Äôre probably gonna waste those mutations by mistake.
---
I kind hate Bethesda right now thanks to Fallout first shit
---
Cult of The Vault Boy
---
That happens to me, too. Not commonly, but still once or twice a week.
---
While The Fixer can be crafted, the game also drops legendary versions.
---
Everyone has a low level mule though... So greedy players could switch up characters and take it regardless. I hear you though.
---
Makes me remember about the ''trading exploit'' months ago that supposedly allowed people to steal stuff from your inventory while trading and how all of it was pure bs.
---
I mean everyone has the right to die on the sword of their ideologies how they choose but it seems a pretty silly thing to be upset about of all things. 
---
Any logical rational person could see this coming from day one. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I'm sure I'll get a million downvotes but doesn't matter, to me the service made sense. Financially and cost benefit analysis. I play it enough even with the random issues and problems.
---
Keeps food fresh. But to be honest, I don‚Äôt store food. The green arctos one looks good though.
---
There's supposedly one at the power station just north of Watoga, but the Deathclaw there usually kills them before I can.
---
90% of the time 1 or 2 spawn at the substation just south east of the legendary vendor.
---
Sadly I think what would happen is they would just use their mules to pick up stuff I have a feeling some of the people I give stuff to are mules so I've been waiting for them to play some sort of quest before handing it over to a low-level stuff in just dumping everything I've got that I don't want on them
---
But Bethesda said there will not be in game transactions but what do we have
---
There's a Poseidon substation just north of watoga that I always go to and they're there. You need to be quick though because There's also a Deathclaw there that starts attacking them.
---
Plus ticks - in case you need em. Fasttravel via Vault76, happy farming.
---
Ha. Fair judgement, stranger.  Merry Christmas to you too.
---
If you mean the Point Pleasant Mothman statue and various tree/bone totems, those are atomic shop items
---
If youre talking about the actual Mothmen, those aren‚Äôt statues, they‚Äôre taxidermy! Mounted Mothman plans can be obtained as a rare drop from the Large Holiday Gifts
---
Nope there is no way to fix it. That'll happen to me several times a session.  Although I do notice something in reference to it and that's that it will almost always happen when I go get the lead weights out of Charleston fire station.
---
The power substation near the Antiques Store almost always has them(be aware that there is also frequently a deathclaw there as well) also Campfire Tales tends to spawn a few. If you are desperate use Butchers Bounty to get the most possible meat which also works on corpses you didn't kill. Those are my two most reliable sources
---
The emergency was already there anyone interesting in this kinda stuff can freely go an find this stuff it makes little difference if 10 people have access to it or 100, either way, its a problem but one of them gets it fixed much sooner and the other allows companies to say "its not a widespread issue" and knock its solution further down the list of priorities. 
---
Also if you want people to blame for this blame the people who make and use this stuff rather than people trying to help resolve it or warn people who might be affected by so they have the option of avoiding logging in while this might be a problem.
---
We need an Anthill!! üòÇüòÇ
---
The mod can be regularly purchased from a number of vendors(everytime I've visited the Watoga Brotherhood bot for one it has been there) for significantly less than 500 caps.
---
I found the plans at white spring but it‚Äôs for a level 1 bat....
---
If you put butchers bounty on you can still loot more meet
---
Edit:assuming it‚Äôs for meat ü§î
---
Cranberry bog for t45, t15b, and t60.
---
X01 plans at the enclave military wing
---
Ultracite complete brotherhood you get the full set plus on a terminal at the top floor of the fort gives you the ultracite plans
---
I‚Äôm not sure on the frequency but it seems to happen just as often for me
---
Workshops are PvP.  Pacifist doesn't apply to them.
---
workshops are PVP areas, pacifist in those areas is basically like saying "Please cave my face in" if you want to avoid PVP do not claim or stay too long in a workshop
---
This would be great as I‚Äôm still dumping it in that one suitcase that sits on the bend hall inside the railroad station.
---
You got too pay to play lol. What exactly did you think would happen when you took over any work shop. Consider yourself VERY fortunate if no one contest it which by the way will activate you guessed it pvp.
---
It has happened to her today everytime shes hit a vendor. Mainly the whitesprings train station.
---
On PC games built by competent developers we don't either.
---
I don't get why these "brilliant" people don't do something worthy, like hack the Fed...instead, they spend their Fridays wasting all of our time...life goals people, think bigger.
---
When you click on it, it doesn't give you the option to choose which level to craft? It'll show the lowest level when you're on the screen that shows everything you can craft but when you select the bat from the list it should bring up a list of all levels before it crafts it. Unless you're a lvl 1 character then it might just let you craft your level.
---
Nah just a bunch of upvotes. Now it actually says ‚ÄúRule 7‚Äù
---
If 5 people know how to do this, it's a problem (and obviously should be fixed).  But if someone makes it all public and suddenly 1000 people know how to do this, it's an emergency.
---
I don't 'blame' people here for the problem, the people who make and use the exploits are the villains here (and no excuse in the world will change that fact).  But distributing the exploit is nearly as bad, I don't think there's an argument there either.  Posting information that leads to the exploit is walking dangerously close to that line in my opinion.
---
Honestly, they probably won't bring too much overall. With the holiday event still active, it's pretty easy to get your hands on gifts. You might be able to squeeze 75 - 100 caps out of the large ones, but I don't think many players would go too much higher than that at the moment. Plus with random contents they might not want to take the risk.
---
You could wait until after the event ends and they're no longer obtainable in the game. You'd be able to get much more out of them then. Better yet you might just go ahead and open them and then sell the unneeded plans. Players would probably be more willing to pay more for when they know they're getting something they want/need
---
Does it to me also
---
Ah hell. That actually explains a lot,  thanks for the info! Next time I'll claim it and get the hell out of dodge!
---
The workshop notifies you that PVP is possible. 
---
I recommend reading the Help section in the game.
---
Try blowing in the mic jack in the controller works for me
---
How bad would it be if half the players stopped playing NW?  (Serious question, I don't play NW).
---
Splitting the game into 2 separate maps would effectively do that.
---
I think it's under "Survival" in Adventure mode.  I saw it there this morning.
---
I have a world cabinet in my CAMP that I have written FREE on in neon letters. I put all extra ammo, plans and whatever else I dont wanna carry or sell in there. It's awesome
---
Well if he can do what you say he can do then I'm sure he will be able to spoof his ip and hardware
---
This season led me to rediscover how much I liked Flatwoods, and maybe part of my lukewarm impression of NW is because I just don't care for the Morgantown map.
---
Our little group went to claim all workshops one night but got our butt handed to us by a rather good lower level rifle build.
---
Go where?
---
Bad, but we would have to deal with that if we got the option. As personally don‚Äôt want to have the option of being forced to play Morgantown. I find that it‚Äôs the map I get M79‚Äôd or the most negativity from but really enjoy the game mode. Thanks for replying though, I enjoy looking at it from all angles and opinions
---
Oh awesome, is this the NW challenges to?
---
I've had that bug a few times on PS4, a simple restart will fix it
---
Off topic:
---
I like what they've done with the show...the direction it's taken but why did they have to kill off the mom. She would have been to perfect for their current predicament
---
Drop nuke on white springs and kill all gouls. Gouls or level 68 in white springs after a nuke. Of course you would be with your friends all you have to do is get one bullet on it and you get the xp. We farm it on a private server when we have killed all the gouls one of us will close the application and then reload in and respawn the gouls. We do this for around 3 hours that's about the duration of a blast zone.
---
Cool, glad you get something out of the discussion!
---
I can't speak to the problem (opinion?) you're having, I haven't played at all since the new map came out, so I don't have a comparison.  But I'd imagine hard splitting the field would have a pretty bad effect on whatever maps is more popular, and a disastrous one on the less popular map.  Hard to tell which one you or anyone else would end up with, but I'm sure you can see the problem either way.
---
Plans should let you build up to the whatever level you are, or level 50, whichever is  lowest.  Subject to restrictions like needing a specific level of the perk card makeshift warrior.
---
Me too, I actually played a fair bit of both maps. My favourite is still Flatwoods just seems no one on PS4 feels the same way. I find it‚Äôs more of a struggle in Flatwoods, your forced to use weapons out of your comfort zone as your preferred don‚Äôt always appear. Hopefully I can get to play a few of them otherwise I will retreat back to adventure mode again.
---
I was able to hit [a new high](https://imgur.com/a/Qz9TWOI ) yesterday.  üò≥üò≥ü§Øü§Ø
---
damn hope i can buy this plan from some1 D:
---
I usually find them at dolly sods but I seem to always get attacked by them during scorched earth and see them most times for tea time and campfire tales
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I do and what they think.
---
These hackers are also causing delays in new content as Bethesda is busy trying to squash all these hacks, not cool
---
It seems like they relocated it there, yes.
---
If you're lucky enough for the Campfire Tales event to trigger, picking up wet kindling will get you enough rad ants for the atom challenge.
---
Yeah unfortunately it‚Äôs an ever dying game mode, it also has a super bad reputation. So your correct splitting it and giving everyone the option to just go for there preferred map would have a devastating effect for the less popular. 
---
I thought after the option to vote I was going to see a lot more of Flatwoods but in my opinion on PS4 it seems Morgantown is definitely the preferred option. I have seen photos and rumours of a smaller map in Charleston as well as one in Harper‚Äôs Ferry, if there was an option for more maybe I wouldn‚Äôt feel as burnt out from Morgantown. 
---
The free to play week has definitely brought more fresh faces to NW hopefully the xmas rewards will do the same.
---
Dude, you should probably just link the beginning of your video. Otherwise, people seeking actual information are getting a few statements, then a lot of introductions for your channel members and sponsors.
---
I think it's more weird to defend FO76, to play it, to pay money for it, to subscribe to Fallout Worst (1st), to spend money on the Atom Shop, it basically justifies it for Bethesda. Anyone who gives them money is telling them, "It's ok Bethesda, I love buying your incomplete pieces of shit. I love the way you fuck me in the ass with your Atom shop and subscription service on a broken game."
---
PS4 and I believe I have the plan.
---
will be offline for a few more hours... 
---
in game is aj-98. psn aj ninetyeight, although some people have said the psn search doesn‚Äôt  always find me.    
---
If psn isn‚Äôt working right, server hop around morgantown.  (when I get back on, I‚Äôll be roaming the scorched hangouts there)
---
Let's play this out a little more would it how close to the line would it be if someone was to fall, victim, to this hack (assuming it is real and works and stated) and then posted about there experience as a warning to others would that also be leading people to exploits?
---
People will always share news about things they find worrying as a means to warn others about it. 
---
Also, Personal responsibility plays its part here if you are the kind of person who hears about a new exploit and then rushes out to find and try it out how far was that person for searching it out themselves without prompting? 
---
I very much doubt that people who would do that are passively waiting and watching fallout fansubs for news of new hax to fuck with people I would assume they would already be on the 1337 haxxor forums and if they are so inclined why would they not go and search hacks out after hearing about the current loophole being closed in an official statement? If one hack works then it's likely there will be others. 
---
There are always hackers the solution is not to muzzle people talking about it but to muzzle the hackers by not creating hackable multiplayer game in the first place or once it's known that your game is hackable to get on top of it with decent detection and banning solutions. (Rather than just banning on finding "cheatengine.exe" running as the case was at one point. -.-)  Then proactively closing down possible exploits as well as creating logging tools so you can easily and quickly revert illicit changes and track item mule-ing (this has a bunch of other benefits other than just hacking it helps combat RMT and helps deal with data loss when servers die along with greater metrics on how items are used and traded among players)
---
But all of this needs more than the life support fallout 76 currently gets so its kinda a moot point to some degree.
---
I wish I had that but I don't want to move my C.A.M.P. I haz jelus :D
---
I have a lot of traps haha

Thanks! :)
---
my understanding is santatronwill revert to a standard collector when the event ends... if that is correct then no need to spend the atoms once base collectron.
---
Awesome, thanks.
---
I think that would ruin the economy imo, imagine all the bloodied fixers
---
Me too
---
Doesn't matter. Once you claim it you can be engaged anywhere on the map.
---
1400/700/438 for the wrapping papers, actually. Just get your Charisma to 25.

*Edit: Must have a stalker. Why would this get downvoted?  Someone doesn‚Äôt like accurate information? LOL!*
---
Adventure mode or NW? I will be chilling in both for a bit this evening. PSN - JOSSISDEAD
---
I'll be on around 4:30 central time zone . My tag is cootdog my level is 396.
---
Have you done the excavator quest?
---
ive Never seen a complete set of t series armor anywhere.  Gotta find the pieces, or craft them if you run across the plans.    
---
x01 and ultracite are event rewards,but I‚Äôve seen ultracite plans in player vendors
---
You said you got the plans. Did you read the plans to activate the knowledge?  Or does it still say ‚ÄòPlan‚Äô instead of ‚Äò(Known)‚Äô?
---
That‚Äôs not true at all EVERY SINGLE game has been hacked so far
---
I agree. I keep lower level items waaay past their usefulness.
---
You can probably find some player vendors selling them, but fair warning they WILL charge out the ass. Cheapest I‚Äôve seen them going for was like 8000 caps.
---
Yes I activated the knowledge. Now, I need plans for at least a level 15 bat.
---
Although this is a nice thought it would become a thing.. It wouldn't work bc some players would just take everything I personally think stash just needs to have an infinite storage capacity.
---
What‚Äôs all the hoopla about bloodied things?
---
I gotta ask - is melee use common in Nuclear Winter? I don‚Äôt play it much, I‚Äôm honestly curious. Few times I tried (before the main PC hackers came in) I just kinda died.
---
No they haven't.  I've played tons of PC MP games and have never encountered a hack in over two decades.
---
No it will stay santatron, it just won‚Äôt collect gifts anymore. Anyway toys can be scrapped sonots essentially the same just no chance of ballistic fiber or ultracite.
---
Adventure mode, I dont understand nw
---
Sounds like you have your answer..
---
Funny I prefer Morgantown myself.  I‚Äôm really hoping this isn‚Äôt it for maps however.  Watoga and the bog beg for a map, especially with the trenches everywhere.
---
Yeah I have.  
---
I‚Äôm just looking for pa pieces rn.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Didn‚Äôt that happen months ago?
---
I avoid people &amp; fast travel away or switch server if the get to close. Am I still at risk?
---
Yeah they let me know this time lmao
---
High levels would just use mules
---
Wait, hipfire gives an advantage on VATs??
---
I‚Äôm curious what you mean by toxicity at Morgantown vs flatwoods?
---
They've stopped renting games about 2 weeks ago. They do sell them though. Probably just to get rid of them.
---
If they get within 4 or 5 foundations of you, you‚Äôre fucked
---
Harpers ferry is an unreleased map. Hopefully we see it soon! I also like Morgantown a lot. A lot of variety up there.
---
yut
---
10 downvotes because this guy said how a single affix giving **+100% damage** was broken? Well ok.
---
Just a personal opinion, feel like there is more in Morgantown.
---
I'm seriously antisocial anyway. My C.A.M.P is locked up, no windows &amp; a power door. No vending machines.
---
I just won't be able to do events. This is going mess the game right up. Bethesda just don't care
---
If you can turn every nocturnal into bloody, what‚Äôs the point lol. I personally like the rewarding feeling of actually finding a good weapon, even if it‚Äôs all random.
---
That hasn't been true for a long time. They fixed that ages ago!
---
I came across a camp with the milk machine that said "Free"  in there was a bunch of ammo and other junk he/she didn't need.
---
What does that mean though? What are you defining as toxicity and why is it only on that map?
---
Have a drop box installed at the vault 76 point. Where players can lok for items and have a better chance coming out
---
bad dcg with mutations
---
Hopefully you got a big camp with space because there‚Äôs no telling if it can go through walls or not
---
Bethesda should just abandon the shitshow that is PVP and put in PVP servers.
---
There are just too many ways to get around the "slap" system.
---
I like private servers myself.
---
Same also a piece of armor I have that lowers meds and food weights also is not working
---
Buying from other players. If you want something specific save your caps and look around. There are deals to be found. I usually buy super useful items from other players at cheap and add 20% and resell.
---
Yeah now you're just on a wind up
---
Did moderators seriously remove this? Omg
---
Wtf? Publishing the exploitV? u/thalenia he‚Äôs just warning them, not publishing the actual exploit
---
It's that time of the month.
---
People still use Redbox? Bahahaha
---
thats probably the best perk card to get in this problem.
---
You could have just started your post at ‚ÄúI‚Äôll look at the map‚Äù and saved us all the humble brag
---
These take up massive amounts of camp budget.  If your not seeing this then your a very special snowflake.
---
That makes absolutely no sense. You are experiencing a glitch of some sort. 
---
What level are you?
---
Been thinking about a sub for this. Adventure mode is so intense when youre not expecting that level of pure malice at under 100 levels. Like its gruesom the way people just dont even investigate the situation at all. 
---
I feel maybe some would be swayed away from such behavior if before they spent caps to fast travel they could see the players level. I dont know many players with a character under 100 with a tse anything or eagarly awaiting that kind of challenge. Like as soon as you goto claim and arent crouching. Anyone can see youre puny baby level trying to play in a workshop, wasting so much scrap building your tower on sand. I could be wrong. And horribly so. I just feel that destroying low levels for scrap will get old or fixed somehow. But that whole deal just makes me want the sub, yo. Greifers and sharks are like. Saddening.
---
 Tbh a mechanic to pair players based on their level would make the pvp/ workshop mode worthwhile even if the highest level player above you has a tse maybe thats within a ten or 15 level margin.  At least maybe tacking down a few bloodied builds around your level would be encouraging and not to harsh when someone blasts you away every once in a while.
---
Now now don't hate
---
It needs fixed with a method that doesn‚Äôt require shoving more money at the Bethesda thieves
---
I try to leave a 'care package' at Vault 76 for them. Water, food, gun, ammo, etc.
---
Do you mean you craft gifts &amp; then can open them &amp; get given random plans? I haven't made any yet &amp; don't really get how it works
---
I haven‚Äôt noticed but I also don‚Äôt use turrets but I‚Äôve got a shop / garage and a house with two floors that‚Äôs all very cluttered with floor and wall decor and taxidermy and I still have like 30% budget left? No need to be hostile - I just wasn‚Äôt understanding what he was implying.
---
Sod off, I like my mods.
---
No hate, just trying to save you some time writing completely irrelevant information üëçüèº
---
Picture frames for our camps would be great!!!
---
Major thanks and shoutout to u/jpequenox for helping me gain both trophies
---
If you are looking for scrip just look for the holiday scorched. Aside from that player vendors are your ticket
---
Almost like Bethesda wants you to do this...and right before Xmas sales figures come in...o my
---
In that case thanks
---
Because each weapon stolen can be sold on eBay, where Bethesda has done nothing to stop sales. 
---
Items are going for around $50-200 usd.   It‚Äôs insane.
---
Get this hero a Nobel Prize.
---
How dare you say something so reasonable. Take my upvote.
---
Ya. I wonder if he hadn't moved since that patch.

From the picture in this article it looks like it‚Äôs right outside Harper‚Äôs Ferry. They certainly got the look of the town right.

---
That would actually be more complicated to implement than just a level cap, but I like where your head is at.
---
What are some PC MP games you‚Äôve played from the last 5 yrs?
---
Good point, hadn't considered that.
---
Cheers
---
Nope, Bethesda decided that the collection container should have an aggro  higher than anything else in a camp.
---
Dicks lead mobs close to it and they‚Äôll chew through those walls in no time. 
---
Said dicks then kill mobs and loot open broken container. 
---
It‚Äôs sad how badly these things are designed by these people.
---
Get fallout first and you can take all workshops on the map without fear of pvp :)
---
I've had this happen a couple times, but it's been a few weeks ago.
---
It's not common because it takes effort to make it work.
---
Well...you know when I quoted brilliant I was being facetious right?  Just further shows the type of people who do this...fleece the weak instead of fighting for the meek.
---
Happened earlier to me twice.
---
I believe so
---
Sleep or play instrument.  It will eventually kick but at a much much longer delay, by like hours.
---
Then don't post something that leads to the actual exploit.
---
I‚Äôll tell you after I‚Äôm done farming those areas ;). But yeah, sometimes rng doesn‚Äôt work out too well for me. It seems to be either feast or famine
---
Level 34?
---
I didn‚Äôt see any link, buckaroo. He was just pointing out the danger
---
Prolly got fired after they told him to do something stoopid and he said it was totally ReTodded.
---
Check misc
---
Yes but not as much as it used to. It uses up a lot of special points and I don't feel it's worth it.
---
And here I was hoping it would be something silly and fun.
---
Why bother rooting through a player's inventory if they can get stuff out of the Dev room?
---
I did I only saw three advanced repair kits which I found
---
Or just play a game with competant developers?
---
Tried but didn't work.
---
Turns out it happened when I tried to go to events, so acoiding that now.
---
what kind of armor?  i'm wondering if it's specific armor types.
---
i'm in 3 star max level marine armor, mostly with deep pockets, dense torso.
---
Jamaica Plain.
---
South Central S.A., reporting in. Our CFS are glad to Assist!
---
Holiday event
---
That‚Äôs actually what I meant to put as the title ü§£. Sometimes I just type faster than I think üòÖ
---
Best of luck!
---
The teapot event usually spawns 3-5 every time.
---
Could you elaborate please? What's the main features
---
Fallout first you will not regret it.
---
They definitely seem to have slowed down. I only  found 3 yesterday in about 4 hours of play
---
Crazy eh?
---
Make you some nuka grenades. They make a nice bang bang.
---
You‚Äôre right! I was experiencing a glitch. Solved!
---
I mean even at minimum of slapping something together they could make it like a vendor how players have "x" amount of money each day. So just do they same thing so (16= credits with a 6 hour restock time) and each item is 1 credit. Just set the credits to item removals.
---
Thank for link. Your the man
---
Every once in a while I'll get a decent weapon from the purveyor and also from a random drop.  But it dont happen often.
---
I can help if your on console
---
nah
---
I could make you a small cap loan if you need it.
---
These people are doing something worthy though, they‚Äôre informing everyone that the hacks exist knowing or hoping they‚Äôll be fixed.  Rest assured they‚Äôre not the ones acting clandestinely.
---
When I built one I used the bass and set it on concrete foundation stairs. I it's easier to get up from a musical instrument than the cook station
---
Indeed it does
---
I love flatwoods, personally for the bridge! It‚Äôs my guilty pleasure, admittedly I do throw myself of it far to much. And also I like how the weapons spawn in so randomly, everyone is forced to fight to the death with potentially quite shocking weapons that they aren‚Äôt spec‚Äôd for. I used to enjoy Morgantown, think I played to much and with the same group of people on PS4, I would love the ability to cross play on 76. 
---
Me neither, they both feel a bit old now to me although I might just be a little greedy for more. This photo I found through a friend on PS4 before Morgantown came showed some really interesting potential sites at Charleston and Harper‚Äôs Ferry. Hopefully with Wastelanders we will see more from this. It‚Äôs super exciting.
---
You should probably do your research first before claiming they haven‚Äôt as almost all the games you have mentioned have reported hacks...and I have been playing MMO‚Äôs since Runescape and Everquest and yes they both had hackers the fact is any game that requires files to be on your PC can be hacked eventually.
---
Yeah in hindsight some PA would probably have helped. My weapon selection is pretty bad, either too low level or just not effective. 
---
I think I've had one of those runs where I've levelled up but with little to show for it ‚òπÔ∏è
---
So before doing HOTE I'll need to gear up!
---
Neither do I, I rarely get excited with what she normally gives me. But maybe because of the festive season she‚Äôs feeling a bit more generous. I don‚Äôt actually use her much. Had almost 600 script stacked up the last time I went to her.
---
Sure, go read all the posts on that forum and tell me those people are interested in the wellbeing of anything but themselves...
---
Awesome, just let me know who you are in the invite so I know to accept
---
I did
---
Awesome. About to drop a nuke on whitespring in a private server. I will accept and you are more than welcome to join us.
---
I run with rank 4 explosive perk with my explosive guns.
---
Noice
---
Wow I didnt know it was possible to be this wrong.
---
A open world box would be good and If all platforms had chat which I can't believe they haven't already getting rid of stuff you don't want to the right players would be so much easier cus the lack of emotes makes finding out what others want on P.C is a pain in the ass especially as I've come to notice either not many P. C players have microphones or are just anti-sociable or maybe they don't know how to switch the setting from party to area?
---
Probably decent risk assessment? Prison time versus a ban on a video game account, seems simple enough.
---
That‚Äôs fair lol
---
first im hearing of anything like this, so i would not know.
---
Pretty sure dev room cells auto flag you for banning now. But why bother going there when a script can get you 5* weapons without the flag? (Although at this point I would suspect anyone holding these items to be very much flagged by this point)
---
I'll have to go on a junk run anyway to replenish, so I'll have a look around as well :)   
---
(I have \~5000 caps so should  be good for some stuff)
---
Yeah I was going to keep saving till the next purveyor sale but it turns out 1000 is the limit per character. I really wasn't ready to cash out. With this event going on I'm already up to my ears with legendaries and I kinda like to be able to still move. Lol.
---
I have seen (personally) about 40-50% of a player base leave for numerous reasons. Again this is just from what I feel I have seen on PS4 but it also gets a lot of hate, due to bugs, people leaving to go to other new release games (mw or Borderlands 3), people being labelled as *cheaters* and also a lot of toxicity from players whether that‚Äôs just trolls or general as*hole players. I have put a lot of time into NW but as of xmas I will be taking a break from NW and maybe 76 altogether until wastelanders, I feel a bit empty with the game and that‚Äôs not a good way to feel. Sounds sad I know but again I have a lot of time invested in both ADV &amp; NW.
---
The problem is that the mods i looked at from the forum where this is being developed/discussed doesn't need you too edit the game files. You run extra programs that "hook" into the main game and alter the data from the running program, so no actual files are being edited.   
---
(someone, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong here, I don't know all that much about coding)
---
(Just to clarify, I was curious in how these mods work, so I looked them up. I have no intent in actually modding as I'm enjoying the game!)
---
No pretty sure they just removed it because of youtubers complaining about it being pay to win despite it being a skin for the punch bowl
---
Simple in that they are cowards, easy enough to see that...and unless I'm mistaken, they could face jail if prosecuted, yes?
---
High levels, low levels.... nothing miraculously changes as you progress in level.  A level 10 will be just as prone to take all your stuff as, say, I would - a level 200.  
---
IMHO what is needed would be a limit on how much stuff you can take - either in value or in quantity.
---
Thats what I usually do, unfortunately, when I spawned in, I was greeted by about 4 Lvl62 putrid ghouls, anda a diseased glowing wendigo...  
---
I had no chance :(
---
My dad has a billboard above his camp next to his vendors that says "sometimes free shit" and he always leaves a bag there. People either take all, some or none at all.
---
I believe you can't get the high-value legendaries (those that sell for actual money) from the dev-room. They could potentially steal some really good items and sell them on ebay or something.
---
Sorry about that. That was user error lol. Link fixed now. Added updates.
---
Perk loadout manager, SFE, and better inventory are must have mods, plus SFE fixes the issue with strangler heart power armor crashing/freezing your game
---
I have a much easier time explaining things through voice and video. So that was the best way to get this info out. Plus I cover 76 on my channel. I wouldn't say I need the promotion more than I want to get the word out, but I understand why it may have bugged you. I am sorry for the etiquette.
---
I am on Xbox so I have little to worry about but staying on a Private server or NW would be the best until this gets sorted.
---
To make everyone I happy I think Bethesda should have the maps rotate each round instead of voting.
---
Number a.  Wipe other inventories yes that is common and most sought after hack. Happened to me in Rust frequently so I left pvp behind. 
---
Number b.  Assets from other games?  I guess you dont understand how game design works in the slightest. Once you get into the folders you pretty much can add whatever you want. Just so happens its stuff from Fallout 4 being copy pasted.   This isn't a special case. People were adding Borderlands 1 stuff to 2.  Cod assets being exchanged too. Figure it out. 
---
Number c.  We don't even know if these hacks are confirmed and actually happening yet. So take about 20% off there.
---
Beautiful spot where you are
---
You can't get into the dev rooms anymore. There is a "token" that needs to be sent from an authorized account (IE: a dev account) to the server before you can load into a cell. Not to mention that the old way of doing it required a script to edit your characters location. Even if you could still use the script you'd just crash or get an error.
---
Dunno why you got downvoted, this makes a lot of sense and thus makes it not as bad as people think
---
Its Just rng thus far I've only got 1 or two things actually worth keeping from her
---
When did the debug happen? I haven‚Äôt played in months.
---
"I want a thing!"
---
\*Thing exists in multiple forms\*
---
"Not like THAT!"
---
It's a nice gesture. I hope you get what you're looking for.
---
Is the link above the video proof of someone taking player inventory or is it elsewhere? We've had our fair share of hoaxes, so I just want hard proof of something so devastating.
---
I will try that it is a brand new controller has only been used about an hour I can't imagine it is dirty  though. Is that how you use the mic on pc? Or does it need to plugged into a pc port?
---
It‚Äôs a glitch, I‚Äôm on ps4, my markers just stopped working properly after the last update.
---
Thanks for the offer but not sure I'll be on tomorrow -got  family visiting for Christmas
---
I‚Äôm an Aussie and yeah we know about the Peanuts.
---
havent seen a single one in glassed caverns on multiple servers, multiple days. just my luck. big bend tunnel delivers santas, other spawnplaces less and less somehow. ps4.
---
And to think I just moved the game to a SSD to dive back in. Great job, Bethesda! Seriously, what the hell? 
---
GTA V bans people and does a better job than FO76 at doing so but you still get crazy hacking sometimes but none of the hacks go in and steal your shit from you, this really sucks. 
---
While it aint that great of a Fallout game I do enjoy it sometimes and look forward to Wastelanders but I guess I won't be logging in anytime soon. lame.
---
Mine says there's something free when there isnt
---
He got down voted because once you log off a server and log back in, them items that were taken don‚Äôt reappear like states. üôÑ
---
Ha! My boyfriend has it so when we play together that's what we do! Good way to farm fusion cores and other resources
---
Unable to duplicate the issues described above. Not saying it's not happening. Just nothing observable on my end.
---
spiff doesnt hack mmos and has never hacked mmos he finds exploits in single player games and or multiplayer games he exploits mechanics that are in the game he doesnt download aimbot or some shit
---
Glitching through doors and walls is still possible. Even replacing your door with a solid wall won't keep you safe from this.
---
Those are only transferable via glitch right?
---
Then yes your friend should be worried.
---
Sorry but, lol. 50$?  More than most people pay for the game, seems crazy to me. I am going to just PLAY the game for the stuff I want. Honestly hope Beth does something about all the exploits and dupes. Feel bad for my PC brethren.
---
I was initially really skeptical about this but the video is convincing for the human NPC etc hacks - but only repeats a rumor regarding the "loot all muh stuff" hack.  The youtuber in the video seems reasonable in his assesments.
---
FWIW - I also encountered this Gemini person mentioned in the video some months back. Almost  immediately blocked him - he is a literal sociopath and the youtuber comments on his encounters with him leave me unsurprised.
---
It was an overcorrect, it was OP when it was +100% dmg for TS and +100% explosive  dmg for each bullet. Now that they have somewhat balanced explosive dmg and how it works TS could go back to 100% and still not be meta. The fact TS is really bad in vats and the bullet split limits range + the durability issue is enough of a balance IMO.
---
Same could be said for shotguns, they couldn't fix the way explosive dmg way so they nerfed the way a base shotgun worked, then they finally found a fix for explosive dmg and never rebalanced the dmg and range of shotguns
---
Well someone should‚Äôve told him because there is some truth to it, I believe stuff like caps and ammo are server side items, he got downvoted for his hypothesis)):
---
Yeah, his statement is partially true but if he has been following the game or reading posts on the subreddit, he would know that just logging off and logging back in does not restore items that you had.
---
I think the person whom he got it from just pressed the square button and dropped it. You can do that with any set of power armor.
---
&gt; I don't get why these "brilliant" people don't do something worthy, like hack the Fed
---
Because they aren't "brilliant" On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being "hack the Fed" hacking a Fallout game is maybe a 3.  They aren't "brilliant" they just have a *little* more time and knowledge than you do.
---
I didn‚Äôt think so today when I helped down SBQ and got a 3* rolling pin... Maybe I should try my luck with The Purveyor as I think I‚Äôve got ~750 scrip.
---
&gt; I dont understand why people feel the need to ruin the game for everyone else. 
---
That's because you're not a sociopath.
---
I have had several of  those before today.
---
TSE 50 cal, not so good, still, a TSE worth something.
---
JE Handmade, that's really something.
---
I don't remember the legendary vendor giving me any very good stuff in terms of weapons and I usually find some sweet underpriced ones from player vendors like 15k BE25 Railway, 4k JE LMG, 15k BE Gatling Gun and 12k BSS Meat Claw.
---
"OK, so I lit $10 on fire and watched it burn, but I can't seem to find my $10 anywhere.  Did I get cheated out of my $10 or did the wind just blow the ashes away or should I have spent the $10 on literally anything else on earth."
---
Anything after the first rank is diminishing returns. 
---
Rank 1 is +20%, 
---
Rank 2 is +30%, and each rank from 3-5 adds 10%, to a max of 60%.
---
"We are temporarily unavailable to users from certain countries while we upgrade our site to implement new methods for data processing as required by applicable laws. "

I'm a PS4 player but I have FO76 on PC and jumped on yesterday for a look.  Within an hour (of genuine playing; not of searching for this in particular) I found a player/camp with a name that suggested they were trading focused.  Sure enough, I could buy all the rare fasnacht masks and atom cat plans etc at this camp.  So these issues don't seem rare and isolated, the hacks have thoroughly permutated the PC platform.  Back to PS4 for me!
---
Please read the rules. 
---
10. No Trading Posts. 
---
There is another sub more suited for that. I recommend using that instead.
---
I paid IG stuff for mine and spent like 3 weeks grinding for the weapons to buy and set with IG trades and yew I am worried
---
In the OP I literally says they can be 200m away and not even see you.
---
If that was edited in after, sorry.
---
My play almost everyday, and my son joins me occasionally. He's a level 8, and I'm a level 160 if you would like to join us sometime. We both have mics also. My PSN is HillbillyDLUX08 and his is funnydavy444.
---
Really? THAT'S what you think? What about gta? Minecraft? Fortnite? All of them have had some form of hackers in them, and always will! You can't stop them
---
It was added after, all good
---
If your inventory gets wiped in rust that's because admins are being dickheads. It's a plug-in for servers, not a hack. Maybe join an actual moderated server? I've never had it happen in over 3000 hours of rust since 2017.
---
"Stuff from Fallout 4 being copy pasted" Yeah mate that's exactly what I said, they're bringing game assets from a different game. One of the games you mentioned is co-op, the others are unsupported by their devs. It's funny how you compare these to Fallout 76 which supposedly has an active, competent dev team (not))
---
Lol, I am subbed purely to downvote anything 76 related. Uninstalled after the cardboard cutout portals to atom shop. But this. This deserves an upvote. What a perfect game
---
No. I have the video of the proof of the new inv hack, but you cant upload video or embed them here. I am currently working on a new Update video that features this footage.
---
It's the hacks that people don't publicize that worry me more
---
Ahh ty for that üëç
---
The community in this game blows my mind with their generosity! Keep it up. Make games great again
---
Crashed out of 2 SBQ fights this afternoon.  Very pissed.
---
Understood. That video is insanely important right now. No one will risk playing on PC if someone can jack their whole inventory. We need that proof.
---
Oooh right okay that makes sense
---
Curious, how does an all white outfit work for a sniper?
---
That is not the ammo you are looking for, puny human.
---
Really?  Then if there‚Äôs more to it then admittedly I‚Äôm talkin out my ass.  I don‚Äôt frequent those forums what‚Äôd these specific people say that makes you conclude that? no /s here.  No disrespect intended.
---
50 dollars to cause his and others game to freeze up
---
I disagree that PvP is fundamentally broken. Players just aren't interested in Monster Mash, or Civil War Re-enacting because they're not convenient or really even fun. Workshops were always PvP, and they still are. Arguably, it's the only part of PvP in Adventure Mode that has survived at all - because people are actually using it.
---
Much of the disconnect over workshops is that some players want Workshops to be/assume they are PvP optional, when the truth is, you opt into/consent to PvP when you set foot on a Workshop in Adventure Mode. It's not a secret, it's just not what some people want.
---
I feel that it would be value added to simply rename workshops as something more clear about the danger involved; "Skirmish - So and So Junkyard," then take some time adding more content for PvP-minded players. I primarily PvE, but adding content or making life better for players who prefer PvP is still a win in my book.
---
A pipe revolver with the rifle mods was my main weapon before I got myself a lever action. Pretty good to start out with.
---
That's not it.. it's more about the fact Bethesda have created a playground for experimenting with code.  There's a challenge there, and some thrills and kudos for coming up with new ways to mess with it.  Add to that the general widespread disrespect for many aspects of Bethesda and you have motivation to get into the code and mess around if you can.  
---
It's not about messing up *your* game play, it's about sticking it to Bethesda for their lazy coding, MTX store utilities, and lackadaisical response; and about enjoying figuring out the puzzle of how to do these things.
---
Before you get excited I'm not condoning that, just explaining the way I understand these things.
---
NTA. 
---
I leave my santatron unlocked because it's Christmas and I want people visiting my camp to get a little present. If some people don't know how to play the game that's not your fault. It's on them to learn how to play the game (and on Bethesda to get the information to them effectively).
---
Yeah pretty much! I do like Flatwoods more admittedly but your pretty spot on there.
---
Cheat hacks out that allow someone to completely steal your inventory while just being in the same zone as you.  
---
I wouldn‚Äôt even log into pc atm.
---
You cheated yourself just by doing that.
---
I get nervous with explaining myself a bit on here. Especially with subjects that could cause offence or be misconstrued as something else. Again I would happily explain to people just off this post. I get it‚Äôs kinda stupid to say it and not be willing to have an explanation behind it but been burnt before. Thank you as well!
---
In your Stash or player inventory? Might've scrapped them..
---
That's fine ignore my points that dont fit your rage narrative.  Sort yourself out, bud.
---
Oh that‚Äôs interesting. I didn‚Äôt know the limit was 1000 either, makes sense though. Needs to stop some where. Glad I‚Äôm not the only one who hoards scrip my friends think I‚Äôm mad for keeping it ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I got 5 of the pieces myself and 1 from a friend. If this is true, will all pieces go or just the one piece I got from him?
---
Yeah I like that suggestion, at least then there is some consistency and all parties will be happy.
---
What do you mean?
---
Uh oh! *d‚Äôoh* sorry to hear it. Maybe after this post the xmas fallout fairy might give you some better luck. Deffo worth a try with the purveyor, she has been nice to me with 3* Ranged Weapons.
---
Maybe they patched it before, but it was patched none the less when I tried after my base was blocked.
---
My take on full white is the skiing outfit (white) and the wrapped cap. It looks as if they were a single outfit. Very snowy Siberian sniper.
---
No, my wife said the same thing until it happened to her. Had it in my stash
---
Never knew about this.. works really well, just ran 2 workshops for 2 hours while doing family stuff
---
I haven‚Äôt spent a dollar more than the retail price. I can buy about whatever I want from the atom shop with the free atoms they give out. I‚Äôm glad I paid the retail price so I could play the game for myself instead of being swayed by reviews. I think it‚Äôs weird that you care how people spend their time and money. You probably loved Bethesda 2 years ago so don‚Äôt tell me or anyone else not to try a game they make or support them lol
---
It's most likely just a rumor becuase no official batehsda mod has said anything about it
---
The greatest sniper ever wore all white but he was in Finland not West Virginia so...
---
And I add: if you want to look sniperish, check the explorer outfit, the ragstad outfit or a full set of forest camo armor.
---
lol what the actual fuck are you going on about.
---
Learned that lesson from PUBG.
---
It's not that hard to build a camp that looks post apocalyptic. Limiting yourself to wooden or warehouse walls is a good start.
---
I do agree that they need to put more post apocalyptic stuff in the game.
---
I am. What can you help me with? I tried the campfire stairs glitch, the post glitch and angled concrete foundation glitch but it didn‚Äôt work.
---
&gt; He waved back and then one-shotted me.
---
You can't trust raiders anymore.
---
Ya I haven‚Äôt.
---
For me... it has been worth it!
---
ahahahahaha 1000 atoms on repair kits
---
^This. When Wastelanders was delayed and The Outer Worlds dropped I took a clean break from 76, as I was just grinding dailies and it was feeling like a chore. Then when I finished TOW I went back to Gran Turismo Sport. Hopped back into 76 a bit last weekend for the extra XP. Doing a little bit here and there, just figuring out my legendary explosive shotgun at the moment.
---
I highly advise just not playing for a while. By the time Wastelanders drops if you can be bothered to come back then I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll have a lot more fun.
---
Are you in fallout first?
---
Think it depends on the type but I would try hooking it up to the pc itself
---
I had a bloodied ffr one and loved it, I eventually sold it as it was kinda a novelty weapon but it was fun while I had it
---
Best case scenario, you have the version with the Nvidia MX250 which can do *some* gaming at 1280x720.
---
Worst case scenario, you're on integrated graphics... which is garbage for gaming. Sounds like you're on the integrated just by your title; not much can be done there. Sorry.
---
It was a glitch. Thanks I have it figured out
---
They're losers, but that means Bethesda are even bigger losers, because the hackers are winning.
---
"See guys, people actually want this stuff." - Bethesda's evil lair.
---
Shame on you, OP.
---
hahahacks
---
The whole statement that items can be stolen from a player has never been proven, so how can you disprove that logging off and back in wouldn't resolve? Lol. 
---
Caps, ammo and numerous other items are server side. And even if somehow this did happen, Support has proven they can even determine if a glitch happened on your account as happened with people who did or didn't lose items with stashbox.  
---
But again, this "hack" has never been proven here or on any of the forums or discords. Multiple claims, no proof.
---
&gt; Did I get cheated out of my atoms
---
On ps4 just hit the ps4 button and go to main screen, friends request is at top. You can do this while in game.
---
Can't say much without a few other details, like how you're connecting to the internet and what the graphics card/system you are using on that rig.
---
I will say, that looks like a fairly simple ultralight, though I didn't dig too deep into it (and I'm not familiar with the model).  I wouldn't expect great performance with that.
---
One hand or two?
---
PC.
---
Yarp!
---
There will still be something to collect. An icon or something. The 'free' status goes when you have claimed everything.
---
One
---
Take a Radshield, use lead lining if you can. Bring a lot of Radaway.
---
Or wear a hazmat suit and don't get hit.
---
If you go to watoga and look in the water channels to the south of watoga station and follow the channels towards the flooded railyard you will find several spots. Some are large and some are kinda small and easy to miss. 
---
Also head east into the water from watoga shopping plaza and same scenario.
---
There are pools outside vault-tec ag center that have some as well.
---
Great idea. Except you KNOW itll have a bug where anyone can access your stash or something.
---
On PS4 pro here. I have same prob. Have to open the map and select FT two or three times at least before it works.
---
Nope sorry
---
If you want proof of this hack working, go read the unknown cheats forums for yourself then. And do some more research because I‚Äôm not gonna spoon feed you guys just because you ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù it to be true. üôÑ
---
Using them in game is one thing, people actually spending on them is another.
---
I would rather get a foot long than buying this.
---
You can kinda do that with the punch bowl but thats just for consumable drinks, I just put all sorts of alcohol so people can get trashed while exploring my camp lol
---
Lol, think you missed irony...
---
I would‚Äôve been pissed too. I‚Äôve had these types of crashes happening since the beta.
---
Lol. Dude I'm on all the forums and the modders discords and the data mining groups. 
---
This has never been shown to work in any video evidence. Only claims that they could be able to.
---
No worries!  Always glad to help.
---
The true question is: Did YOU take any chem?
---
I use to have this issue every time I joined a new world. Did it for a couple weeks and then one day it just stopped doing it. I have no idea of the how and what's about it.
---
I have the speed demon mutation and I noticed I was getting even hungrier and more thirsty way faster than you already do, and my 200% fixed weapons are breaking much faster
---
Yea, but had it in my regular stash. And I never hit the scrap all, when in my scrap box. I know it scraps all your junk
---
Would this hack be able to obtain weapons/armor with Atom Shop paints?
---
More for fun type weapon. Not sure how much value they actually have.
---
I have a TS/bash/90RW auto grenade launcher that I pull out from time to time when doing low level events solo. Also good for scaring teammates in their camps.
---
If it‚Äôs open or unlocked it‚Äôs fair game. I leave my water unlocked and plants/work benches/beds available. My scrap collectors/Santa trim are locked cause thems mine.
---
I am connected to the internet and i use windows 10 btw i know barely anything about graphic controls so its probably somrthing obviousüòÇüòÇ
---
Thats kind of what i thought it would be. A novelty weapon. Too bad though, it should be devastating. The stats on it are very good, 125 fire rate and 568 dmg, my BE Handmade is only 75 fr and 348 dmg.
---
Unyielding armor giving plus 3 to all stats except endurance when health is low. Check the unarmed perk. Several perks in strength count. Also sneak perk gives supposedly almost three times the damage I believe. I'm not in game right now but check the agility perks also.
---
And when was the last time you experienced this?
---
That‚Äôs been fixed for quite a while, my friend.
---
Only way you can still stack to to use the side of a hill
---
This. Also if you have the standard back pack get the lead lined mod and max out your rad resist perk card and equip it.
---
I had this bug once, buying something else from the vendor (had to be the same vendor) fixed it for me.
---
Just buy some ammo or food, most vendors have some of those.
---
Glowing meat steak gives plus 10 to melee and I think fury and maybe one of the drugs like psycotaytsgive good melee bonus for short time.
---
In all of those instances I'm either so directly in control I can just remove hackers from my presence, or the game is so heavily moderated you will rarely, if ever, run into them.
---
Fo76 is an anomaly in that its a modern title with an absolutely archaic system of anti hack, if you can even call it that, and almost no user control whatsoever.
---
LoL. DUdE iM On ALl tHE fOrUms aNd thE mODdErS dIscORds AnD thE dAtA mIniNg gROuPs. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
First of all, that statement right there doesn‚Äôt mean shit. Second of all, do you really expect there to video evidence when the hack has been recently released/attempted? No! 
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ Have a nice day dude. I‚Äôm only playing with ya to see your reaction. I don‚Äôt actually believe these hacks to be true. If they were, I‚Äôd see more than just one you tuber covering this, mind you he only has like 20K subscribers, and you‚Äôd be hearing reports of it actually happening to people.
---
The tattered field jack would be close. It's more of a blue/gray white though. Looks kinda like mark walbergs character in shooter just a ragged dirty version.
---
If you were crafting anything that required their components, the game priorities those for some reason.
---
In other words, you know you're wrong and rather than admit it you claim it was all for the LOLs. 
---
Be in a team and everyone use rad sponge
---
The ammo weighs too much for most people I think. But you could definitely have some fun with it if you build for it.
---
This is just a stunt so people will buy fallout first to get the private servers xD
---
Idk maybe im an asshole but im glad they are doing this. Maybe it will open bethesdas eyes.
---
Where can you find these mods for the SMALL backpack???
---
Cliffwatch, Top of the world/Ski Lodge and both sides of Morgantown airport. Also the station/trainyard there. 
---
Not the most plentiful, but reliable spots all.
---
Screen shot?
---
if u see the area at the Prime fissur is nuked go get in the waterchannels to collect the rad version of tarberrys. u need only 10 of them ;)   
---
and for the cranberrys u can collect all 3 sorts of them cuz they count all !
---
I just wish we could straight up get more picture space, I filled the entire album through my hundreds of hours and I have to just screenshot them on my console instead of viewing them on loading screens :(
---
?
---
Nah that won't happen until they patch something completely unrelated.  Fixed the fast travel bug (yay) gave everyone access to your stash (oops we're looking into community reports of an issue)
---
Yea, but I don't think I did that. I haven't crafted anything but healing salves, or diluted stims and radaways.
---
Nah, it was just for laughs. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇü§£üòÇüòÇü§£ü§£üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇü§£üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇü§£üòÇüòÇü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
I'm guessing your health was already low? Otherwise, it's not possible to one-shot other players with the current damage cap.
---
I'm in the same boat. I'm not so paranoid to stop playing the game, but I can say for certain that if my current character got looted, I would be uninstalling right now.
---
This increased breaking of my stuff has helped me reduce my stash by repairing armor and weapons. I have taken in so much scrip it's all evened out. I can stash legendaries while my script limit updates. 
---
The kicker is getting better drops from the purveyor üéÖüëç
---
Edit.. My main weapon is breaking faster, agreed OP!
---
I'd like to be able to configure it to allow 1 free item per item purchased.
---
Yeah then mule accounts can clean them out :)
---
Pleasant Point seems good for 25+ scorched on each run.  I‚Äôll typically see 2-4 Santa‚Äôs, usually 2*.
---
DIY Santatron!
---
Probably that level 1000 player roaming around the woods.
---
If your on PC thats the kind of hacking stuff id expect to see
---
I'll be honest no idea how to upload screenshots
---
Thats crazy because I loaded immediately after a server crash on  private server within like 30 seconds and every workshop things I built was gone, made me happy I bought the monthly and cancelled just to try it out
---
Most fun I had with mine was during scorched earth, there was bodies flying everywhere.  It‚Äô was funny at the WS gold course too.
---
Make it asbestos
---
+3 charisma but risk of respiratory illness when in range
---
Are you on PC? That might be the hackers doing. They can even spawn Prydwen.
---
I lose them all the time, I wish they were only forced-scrappable. You most likely crafted or smelted something using acid.
---
Glassed cavern.
---
 Not only is it full of scorched but every time you mine an ultricite ore 4 more scorched come running.
---
 My 2nd best place is Big Bend tunnel.
---
I did smelt some silver ore for the badges, but I have 3000 acid. I figured it would take that. Probably where it went.
---
Imagine having a penis this little.
---
Gauley Mine. Almost always at least two, sometimes more. Quick run through to get em all.
---
damn I need to be playing with you aha
---
I've noticed that I get detected more often post patch 16 &amp; cant figure out why.
---
I have a prebuilt trashcan in my camp with a vault boy cutout pointing to a free loot sign I throw all kinds of extra goodies in there that I don‚Äôt need to sell.
---
Oh of course, that's a regular occurrence. I just haven't fought a queen in the past few days since I got back, so it hasn't happened yet
---
Yhea, I am on PC
---
I think it's a bug, not long ago there was the same stealth bug.
---
I am getting something weird in West Tek too, I heard mutated hounds despite the hounds did not spawn, muties suddenly detects me after that and  Protectrons suddenly walk out despite I never used the terminal, and they also exploded all of a sudden but nothing is shooting at them.
---
I am quite sure it wasn't another player's doing because I was right next to the terminal when those robots started walking out.
---
No trading posts allowed. Please use a different sub.
---
So I‚Äôm not going crazy!
---
Swear to god I was about to completely rebuild my character as I was getting detected to much!
---
Much be a bug, I hope!
---
yap. i actually know the guys who made that hack to lol. you just point at a player when they are in render range and steal from them
---
Get out of the workshop after you claim it but stick around the outside of it. When someone starts to claim it, (while you have pacifist off) use an sniper with stealth perks. You will most likely one shot them if you go for the head or get a critical.
---
&gt;it's about sticking it to Bethesda
---
Oh, please.  These people don't have a "higher purpose."  They get off on trolling people, and if they can turn a profit selling stolen wares on eBay, that's a bonus.
---
You can't ascribe traditional motivations to sociopaths.  They don't play by the same rules as the rest of us.
---
Try using sound hound or a similar app/software. Did you upload the YouTube video you linked? It's been a long time since I uploaded youtube stuff but back in the day when I would upload a video that had copyright protected music in it I would be able to check a section of my account that would show the video and list the songs in it that are copyright protected. Might be worth a shot.
---
I dont think its integrated but thered ab extra slot for ram would the problem be fixed if i just added a.16gb ram in?
---
You could trust raiders? Lol
---
Maybe this? [Walter Wanderley - Summer Samba (So Nice)](https://youtu.be/VGNwXq6vPoI)

Put your system in safe mode and rebuild the drive. Don't system reset cause that will wipe your data. There are videos you can use on YouTube that show the entire process so you can see rebuilding will keep all your memory stored. It will help with any other game that may be blue screening you also.  
---
You can save your game data to ps plus cloud if you want to be extra cautious or to put your mind at ease.
---
It's a good and a bad. Online games that allow community servers or mod support are worth easily 20x what the console version is. You get to experience the game in ways you will never get to on a console. The issue is some people are dedicated enough to turn that into a negative for others, too. Still, it's only slightly more difficult to cheat on consoles, not impossible. The older CoDs like WaW/MW2 are as much of a shitshow of modded lobbies on consoles as it is on PC. In comparison, BO3 custom zombies are leagues above the base game maps in terms of complexity and content
---
How does melee function in NW? Is there any sort of damage cap on it? It‚Äôs a high risk high reward play style IMO. If it‚Äôs capped like adventure mode, that would be no bueno. 
---
I love melee and I‚Äôve been trying to get into NW more. That may do it for me if it‚Äôs a feasible play style in NW.
---
There‚Äôs a free flame skin that took me ages to find
---
How's that 2FA coming along Bethesda?
---
I traded one for 30 dirty Sugar Bombs a few weeks back. I'd never wear that coat, but I've already used all the Sugar Bombs to make Brain Bombs.
---
No. Your issue is absolutely a lack of graphical power. Very few ultralight/ultrabooks are designed for gaming.
---
There are no mods specifically for the small backpack, the same mod plans work for both the small and regular pack, but they work in a reduced way for the small pack
---
hahaha i knew it.. a few months ago i posted something like this on reddit... i told people that its possible to steal player inv items and nobody believed me  theres another thing that allowed players to set your inventory items into your vending machine for 1cap
---
meh.
---
PC problems (they always are).
---
At some point Bethesda will acknowledge regretting releasing this game to PC.
---
What can be done because its run other high res games totally fine
---
The thing about hacks is that it's often not a matter of if, but when.  And when it does happen, what are you going to do about it?
---
In a lot of ways, it's remarkable that a hack like this didn't happen sooner, given the Swiss cheese nature of the engine and the frequently dubious coding that seems to go on at Bethesda.  But the onus was on them to have proper backups and restoration systems, so a situation like this is a setback rather than a disaster.
---
Lol, umm you understand Atoms sales is how future dlc and maintaining the servers is being paid for right?  How is that illegitimate.  Ever online game with hosted servers has to maintain an income stream outside of the initial purchase.
---
as a pc and console gamer, i've been waiting awhile to say this with the constant talk of mods and yada ya, but, *ahem* suck it pc gamers, haha.
---
I've returned in the last couple of weeks. Played during the beta, and off and on until June. At that point I had gotten to the point where I could enter the launch silos, but I play solo and at level 49 I didn't feel strong enough.
---
Since coming back:
---
1) I hit level 50
---
2) Attempted the silo by myself. I actually made it pretty far, but damn those laser turrets are incredibly irritating. I made it close to the end, but ran out of health items, so I fast traveled out of there.
---
3) Finally getting some decent legendary weapons and armor thanks to the scorched Santas. Who knew it didn't have to take 40 minutes to kill a scorchbeast by myself!
---
4) I finally saw and killed a sheepsquatch!
---
5) I finally saw the flatwoods monster! He teleported away the second I shot at him unfortunately.
---
6) I haven't seen the mothman since *last year*.
---
7) I'm trying to collect scout badges so I can finally get that damn backpack. But damn is it a slog. And since I travel solo, I haven't had the opportunity to revive someone.
---
8) I still haven't found one of those dead tourists to get the plans to build a camera. I traveled around to places where they are supposed to spawn, but nothing.
---
I'm having fun. Looking forward to the expansion.
---
It‚Äôs easy don‚Äôt stick around 
---
grab those fusion cores or ammo and GTFO 
---
people that stick around are fools.  Or sitting ducks
---
Concrete bunker and custom cave
---
Where can I find the mods? Only through the Scout vendor?  Or can I buy backpack mods from robot vendors somewhere or from other players if they have them?
---
Whats the point in doing this? I mean, this is a threat? These guys are frustated with The game? Just regular bad guys, or snowflakes that need some attention? Just to show dominance? And when It Will happen?
---
It's no 'higher purpose' and I'm not painting them as heros of some kind.  But it's not about the players, so much as the fun of figuring out how to beat the system.  They're not sociopaths, or at least, I wasn't when I messed with this sort of thing and the people I know who do it aren't.
---
Cool maybe I'll check it out.
---
Uhh, where are you getting any of those numbers from? Pretty sure two shot was +100% base damage, so not counting the bonus from receivers, then split equally among +1 additional projectile (so for shotguns it just added another pellet). And explosive would add +200% damage on two-shot weapons, or +900% for shotguns and +400%/500% for a normal/two shot dragon
---
Neither are for my build! But both are super cool for the right build and person! They both got snapped up quickly within my community! I personally don‚Äôt like explosive but have heard and seen the growing interest in Junkies! I do love finding those gems in player vending. Sounds like you found so good‚Äôns
---
The wolves will always slaughter the sheep.  Unless you team up with a wolf.  
---
Instead of people constantly bitching and complaining DO SOMETHING!!  Adjust your tactics or gear. 
---
Just today someone was PvP at the SBQ event. Intentionally running in front of people shooting the queen to pick a fight.  I died a few times before I stopped using VATS and then got the upper hand and took him down.  At first it was annoying but afterword the guy gave me props.   Check and adjust people
---
I've noticed this too. It would happen occasionally before and if I would server hop it would stop (possibly just my imagination). But yesterday....man it was like everything was using berry mentats against me!
---
Can't you craft a +30 carry weight backpack without doing the Scouts quest?  I've got one and I haven't even started that quest on my latest char.  
---
Also in the silos, there's a ton of info out there about how to run those, there's a lot of tricks and tips that can make them much easier.
---
tbh mutant's being stronger than junkie's would be fair. Junkie's offers pretty much no down sides for ranged builds. Boo hoo, you lose a few special points and maybe 10dr. The worst are probably psycho, x-cell, or med-x. But some mutation negatives can be much worse, main one I'm thinking of is reducing energy damage. Even with class freak some of the mutation effects are still worse than withdrawal. I would totally understand mutant's outclassing junkie's in terms of raw power
---
I mean it's still technically run by Poseidon so I'm not wrong and thanks for just reiterating exactly what I said lol. They were also asking for static spawns not places they "may" spawn.
---
I was having problems *breaking* sneak yesterday,  Escape Artist was being completely worthless.  I'll pay more attention today and see if it's still like that..
---
What‚Äôs broken are the sheeple that think workshops are theirs and another extension of their camp.  You have to expect someone will initiate PvP in a workshop zone.  Been that way since the beginning. 
---
So many other ways to farm mats but people get greedy then they get dead.  Circle of life my friends.
---
The stats weren't bugged, but there is an oversight where explosive was adding damage per pellet instead of in total. This is still a problem in the game though, as the popularity of explosive laser rifles/gatling plasmas should show you. They only "fixed" it for the shotguns by nerfing them down to hell. Either way, I think this was some time around January or February
---
What a shit idea
---
Yes to the backpack. Grab the plans out of the Overseer‚Äôs stash inside Morgan Airport.
---
fallout 1st membership doing poorly? do you even play the game? every lobby i join on xbox people have the fallout 1st icon(s) or the outfit for it, or in their camp have the scrapbox, including myself.
---
Your ratio would have to be MUCH higher so that the caps transfer was slower and less convenient than buying the premium currency.
---
Because you know... Bethesda needs to make money off this game if you want it to stay active
---
3 points martial artist,, 3 points incisor 3points in blicker- base build.  3points in unarmed, 1 point each in gladiator- meathook build, crazy damage.  3points in slugger, 1 point in master and expert slugger- 2handed  
---
Ricochet in luck really helps close the distance on ranged mobs. Bloody mess and adrenaline for more damage.  Starched genes and class freak, twisted muscles and or talons(+ whatever like marsupial and speed demon)
---
Food buffs can stack alot.
---
It is a 2 to 6 process
---
Lol i play other stuff and work alot. Imma pay for a sub or buy weapons and armor for actual money. Ill jump down to that level before i pour my life away at something. Js breh
---
You can check if your laptop can run it [HERE](https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/requirements/fallout-76/17849)
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/ddXt0p1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ddXt0p1.jpg)
---
Huh, I‚Äôve run glasses caverns several times now and no Santa‚Äôs.  Plus I‚Äôm not getting the +4 for every Ultracite vein thingy.
---
Amen brother. Everything I see these days are "beth plz add a pony park to the game" or "plz add fruit cake".
---
It's the victims fault?
---
I couldnt put it in better words lol. Those fuzzy things at√© weird to the bone
---
Mutations also have benefits, not justnegatives. So yeah you're losing less Stat points and getting some positives alongside it. The worst 5 mutations with the perk are still better than the best 5 addictions.
---
Yeah, but maybe he caught a plane ride?
---
Who knows with this sub üòÇ.
---
I mostly lurk and keep up to date with news/bugs etc
---
Okay but programmers have to work many hours to make you a box. Sort of a waste of time.
---
Wife and I returning. Fallout 1st isn‚Äôt a bad deal and the private server + Scrap box + second camp really make it fun again. I don‚Äôt mind paying a monthly fee for those things.
---
Ohhh, that explains why people invited me to a team. I assumed it was by mistake because I'm a low level still. Good to know.
---
If they ever implement mod support (they have stated they will eventually, but I can't blame people for not trusting a word that comes out of a Bethesda PR's mouth these days), they absolutely need to have the game on PC - you can't create mods on consoles.
---
It‚Äôs all a power fantasy for these losers. They exert power they don‚Äôt have in real life to make themselves feel important. If you watch OP‚Äôs original video, he mentions the guy behind these hacks is ecstatic by all the attention he‚Äôs getting.
---
Thanks, yeah I‚Äôm going for a Finnish sniper named simo
---
Maybe I‚Äôve annoyed the gods of RNG, but found no Santa‚Äôs (or legendary scorched) at any of the usual Locations in the Mire.
---
Thus the best/most consistent for me so far has been the forest.
---
I've been getting stuck in [DANGER] for extremely long times, even after killing everyone around and porting back to my camp. Still [DANGER]. Something is definitely getting stuck.
---
They did at one point... Have we really gotten to the point where Survival Servers are truly a myth?
---
Hack the planet! Hack the planet!
---
Don‚Äôt worry once Bethesda enables mods even on the console expect stuff like this to come crashing your way.
---
Just pc things
---
Does running through, not touching the Ultracite, and taking the elevator up... count as a respawn?
---
This is horrible. Why would you want to do this to people? Glad I‚Äôm on Xbox. Hope Beth fixes this ASAP
---
Same here. Armor limbs, and weapons break super fast after the the patch. And  my dude gets hungry and thirsty with the quickness.
---
Thanks!
---
Could be they are the ones making the sales so it appears there are sales?
---
An early incident makes so much sense now... I thought I was going crazy when it said I was selling things for 1 cap.
---
You will complain about the same type of Behavior in February too.
---
That was definitely an isolated incident, that stuff isn't *all over the place*.
---
Personally I'd say none of them. 
---
TSE doesn't give that much of a boost and it'll break much faster, if I were to pick a damage boosting prefix it'd be Furious.
---
Lmg for most. The larger mag on the 50 cal. Can out do it on larger stuff. The gatling is nice for conserving ammo. One of each.
---
That sounds like a good plan!
---
Health was completely full,no radiation damage, full health bar.
---
True it‚Äôs just the holiday season and the low levels could really use some of the plans and stuff you get but whatever no one seems to care about this game anymore.
---
With you. Two shot was insanely overpowered. I'm shocked that nobody at bethesda shot a TSE before launch and said "um..  hey guys.. this uhh... this doesn't seem right"
---
Yeah, that gloriuous sub 30 fps console gaming is what all PC gamers dream.
---
Ah yes I am Elaina3rdPlaythrough
---
Thank you!
---
I would love this but I really don‚Äôt want to pay for it, I‚Äôd just keep dumping it at train stations if that were the case. It would be a nice little questline like maybe a responders or free states one.
---
ugh ...does it? dayum...my bloat fly glands keep disappearing. Was wondering why.
---
PC same here. I freeze up using any consumable be it from inventory or favorite wheel. Total lock up. Unresponsive. Crashing on loading has become pretty common. 
---
I feel your pain!
---
Unfortunately, you can't right now.  It's a Wavy Willard Plush Toy that was in the Atomic Shop for a while.
---
It'll likely come back at some point, although you can probably expect it to be bundled with other plushies.
---
How am I, or the other 99% of PC gamers, in any way responsible for what hackers do?
---
aww look at the downvoters and yeah, won't happen, my guy. good looks though, you tried. :)
---
I just kept putting my 40mm into my stash then one day I got the automatic grenade launcher I busted it out and boy was it fun alot of fun.
---
Rip pc
---
If they take the pipboy is it like fallout 4 where you just stare at your arm and can use pipboy in power armour or is it ‚Äúpipboy is unavailable‚Äù
---
My biggest trouble is that I suck at battle royales. I think I get performance anxiety haha. I‚Äôve had a couple kills but more downs before they‚Äôve had a teammate crawl out from some rock and kill me lol.
---
A laptop like that wouldn‚Äôt be able to run fallout 76
---
Yup, they will go Sony exclusive and avoid pc.
---
Save themselves alot of dev time
---
Uh, 
---
you misread that
---
[Pip-Boy Unavailable]

I uploaded a video that shows the hack in action, that I linked above.
