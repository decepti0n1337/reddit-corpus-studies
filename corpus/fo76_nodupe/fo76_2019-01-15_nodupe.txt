There is no trade in. Maybe I should write a fucking essay to see if I’m eligible for a refund?

---
This really looks and sound like network connection issue.
---
Just because I find immaturity annoying doesn't mean I take myself (?) seriously. I'm a pretty happy person, thank you
---
How so? I havent done it yet, but the drop in accuracy is concerning haha
---
Keep crying emo kid

Got them yesterday from super duper mart. Spent all my caps on it since I couldn't remember the last time I'd ever seen them.
---
Only the one that spawns as a random event at the Charleston station. I know this because I managed to get it to spawn and tried to get someone to hold it. And then right after I found someone, it just dropped dead for no reason. I think there's a random bug that occasionally causes vendors to lose their health. The others can't die, but the Charleston one can die. 
---
and dont forget devs deliberate laziness, that one always makes me laugh
---
It did before as well
---
I am but I don't know if it is PC specific. Maybe the caps aren't close enough together cause a couple of them didn't pick up when I did it.
---
Does this mean time to get another xbox? I’ve got a many years old xbox one, only time I’ve ever experienced“buzz of death” is w/ fallout76. It’s happening once a play session multiple times a day. Loud buzzing, freeze a few seconds, kicked right back to xbox main. Doesn’t matter where i am on the map or what i happen to be doing (fighting or just sneaking around on the mountain). I lose a few items, but more of a royal pain when i lose workshops.

Case in point- Table Tennis by Rockstar. In fact Id say their R.A.G.E. engine is the exact engine from GTA3. All their games feel exactly the same. As is Battlefield, list goes on.
---
Its much cheaper to enhance a game engine then start again.
---
Cause it turns it into a rapid fire plasma shotgun, which has some nice synergy with certain legendary effects like vampires and furious.
---
I do have a spare brick building set if you're interested
---
This should not need to be explained. Server instability. Market break down. Over saturation of powerful weapons. Destroys the games longevity.
---
I saw it a couple times over the weekend. Even with maxed hard bargain its 9700 caps. Most I've ever held at one time is like 3500.

I'm with you man. Whatever I can do to help the community with out ruining any one else's time is fair game! Dupers should I'm theory trade willingly with anyone, so screen shotting suspicious inventories sounds like grade A detective work without harassment. Anyone who gives to a hard time about this post, probably has a duper friend, or does so themselves. And I'll hear from them after this comment.
---
Please read the third paragraph of my post
---
Somebody modded full glass walls (and I think ceilings - not sure on that) for FO4 and everything I heard about it was that it wrecked havoc on the frame rate.  I'm pretty sure texturing something like that would put a huge strain on the already unstable servers.  But who knows?
---
Yup. Getting really annoying. 
---
Contact RookieGunner on ps4. Tell him i sent you. He modded them for me for 1000 caps and my materials. 
---
Stop trying to melee me and melee me. 
---
I mean, it's not just the hunger, it's not just the hp. Food gives some pretty substantial buffs, and scorchbeast food gives some really good ones, like +3 special boosts.
---
That's a legitimate possibility yes. When bases appear at the golf course I smash them up on the regular. 
---
I consider putting your base there a form of griefing by stealing XP from me and other players. 
---
Unlike OP though, I don't feel the need to kill everything alone, when other players show up I usually switch to a lower damage weapon so everyone can get hits. I'll even wait and let lower levels get their hits in while keeping the mob aggro on me because I can take it. If people show up who start one shotting and not respecting that other players are there I bust out the handmade automatic and quickly tag everything around while still in pacifist mode before they can kill them all.
---
Honestly though, anyone going into a mob with other players around in Whitesprings that isn't in pacifist mode is griefing themselves.
---
Go to the Emmet mountain waste dump and go inside down the tunnels and make a right at the end of the hall there will usually be a legendary deathclaw. Also as soon as you enter there is a fusion core generator and power armor spawn so have fun
---
This quest keeps bugging out and freezing? Anyone else? 
---
Doesnt it use plasma cores not fusion cores?
---
Well I first noticed it when disassembling lots of pipe gun, specifically the ones that super mutants drop. These always have automatic trigger and stocks, I realised they had a higher chance at learning a mod than the crap that scorched give you. So I made a few extra characters to find out. 
---
But to be sure of my theory I bought the plans for metal legs on both my alt and main then set building to scrap for mods, recording both how many I learnt but also the amount of legs I had crafted. It was pretty obvious that my theory was sound. 
---
I can almost bet 0% chance of transferring progress. 
---
Idk but I found TSE prime  handmades if anyone wants some 1300 each lmk(:
---
Thanks, will add
---
Been wanted twice. Largest bounty was 20 caps. Only because I got trigger happy defending someone's work bench and destroyed a couple things in the process. 
---
I only seen one griefer and he seemed intent on destroying this one dudes base for some reason just west of Flatwoods. I just walked over and rebuilt the dudes walls after he left. 
---
One other time I took it as being a troll when someone decided to drop a nuke on a players camp just west of the water park to the north. 
---
Nothing up there but a dudes camp and radius of the bomb only affected the gate of the water park.

never underestimate peoples greed, when they can dupe what they want and then sell it for real money, they dont care about what side effects they may cause

I, too, enjoy Pure Moods when no one is around.

---
No more essays for a while, my dude.
---
I heard the main one everyone was doing only kicked the duper from the server and caused lag for the rest
---
Not only that, its just too expensive.
---
Every game manufacturer does it, Im surprised Bethesda is copping flak for it.
---
Its on a table if ur on xb1 I'll give it to you
---
Look up the drop rates of rare items in the game code and it should tell you how and where they spawn.
---
Raider quest events: tattered field jacket

Look duping is/was an issue but the servers have been unstable from day dot even before duping existed. Yes if there are players that have a billion items in their inventory on a server then it may cause slow downs but I guarantee that you can be on a server with no players like this and the servers still might not be responsive.
---
Duping is bad and has forever tainted this game but we cant blame all of our lifes problems on it. It is never as bad as it sounds like in every second post you see. I think the biggest downside to all of this is now it has become a big witchhunt on legitimate players and groups that have mixed levels.  I remember when this game first come out and I enjoyed seeing everyone posts about what they had built, discussing what they had found in the map, what you can do in the game and tutorials to other players to help with there progress. Now there are just pages and pages about dupers and how to the problems with TSEs.
---
You just need to find what you enjoy about this game and try not to let all these other issues get to you. Find a good group of people to play with and avoid any other toxic people. There are great people in this game and I honestly feel like this is the majority of players.
---
With that said the "Server Not Responding" issue is really painful to wait through and sucks :P
---
Yes. 
---
Its ridiculous. I cant wait for mass bans 
---
I can't complete the quest. It freezes on me every time it asks me to turn my form into Department C. 
---
Please re read my entire post.

I know...I mean all those 2 purified waters and crafting tables.

 Did you pick em' out of that bot corpse at Watoga Station? There was just a crapload there and I took one of what I wanted.
---
Glassed caverns
---
Super awesome!  Toxic fan base of bored assholes, attacking people's camps.  It's like they don't want anyone to play.
---
Great job! So if I'm looking for the Marine Tactical Helmet plan, my best bet is probably the Watoga train car or C2?
---
I saw it, but you are telling people to actively hunt people down with no way of proving anything.
---
Na somewhere else by wendigo cave 
---
I know you are but what I am HUUURRRRRR
---
I will usually offload some stuff at stations. Sometimes I'll find a bag, and I'll take a few things I need, then drop a few things. help out, get helped, it's a good cycle.
---
Please don't believe that horseshit story. It doesn't hold up even at surface level. The way a dupe happened is you rolled back your character and left the server intact - that way you could loot your duped item from a world container while also having another one rolled back into your inventory. If you crash a server, you can't retrieve your item from anywhere, making it IMPOSSIBLE to dupe. Even if it involved some convoluted method of transferring items between friends, a rollback means IT GETS TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM. The fact that that story made it to front page is a disgrace. Not to mention the original post said it required the infinite carry weight glitch, which was patched over a month ago, before OP deleted that from the post
---
Camp got wrecked last night by a jerk. Was able to repair, but all the pieces left partially damaged is rather annoying.
---
Been happening since day 1
---
What pieces do you not have?
---
Sounds like princess.
---
well, x-01 is not actually the best armor. It has the highest rads resistance, t-51b has the best ballistic and energy res, but a very low rads res, ultracite is something in between. So yep, there are reasons depending on what you need. I do live in my excavator :)
---
This 'Final Solution' style thought process does not accomplish anything. Bethesda has authority over these matters. If you are not contracted by, employed by, or volunteering under the supervision of Bethesda, you have no business taking this into your own hands.
---
What you are calling for is vigilantism, and I understand that your intentions are altruistic at their core. But, OP, you do not have the authority nor the correct tools to combat this issue. Even with 100 friends.
---
I would advise you to simply play the game, maybe avoid risky operations/quests due to DC issues until the patch comes. Bethesda is working on a solution that works for all of us. 
---
The ban hammer is swinging, Bethesda is watching, and Fallout 76 will be a better place in time. 
---
On PS4 I've been seeing technical data randomly on my CAMP floor near workbenches, it identifies itself when I look at it, but can't pick it up.  Not noticed it in my inventory but there's definitely something hinky with technical data sheets at the moment.
---
Am I*
---
I'm sorry you feel that way.
---
Im selling one for 5k
---
I'll hate you with all I have and then some.
---
You ruin the experience for everyone else, and for what? So you can be better than the plebs? So you can win at a game?
---
Maybe you should have been a stain on the couch.
---
&gt;This isn't a game about making caps. It's about exploring, discovering, surviving and nuking. if money is your goal, apply that shit to your life, pick up hours at work (or get a job) and be better.
---
If exploring is your goal, apply that shit to your life, put on some boots and go for a walk, grab a backpack.
---
You see useless money, I see opportunity. Turn that dough into some caps with a little ingenuity! My personal use is the Confederate Uniform - costs 3x cloth, 1x gold scrap, vends for 11 caps with no perks and weighs .1!
---
Aren't you just supporting dupers really?
---
All been good for me until this last band-aid
---
There seems to be this idea that a game engine is some kind of single piece of software that can't be heavily updated or modified.

I think there's another one they didn't bother fixing because it's too contrived for the average player to pull off.

only missing the field medic one as i have a hard time finding people that get knocked.
---
Damn y'all are lucky, I've been gridimg for a legit TSE for weeks to no avail and here you just find them laying around...
---
I  am not there to legendary farm but I always ground-shoot or wall-shoot for indirect damage, so everyone has a chance to tag.  Sometimes the mobs don't cooperate though and walk into a direct hit.  
---
&gt; Destroys the games longevity.
---
I mean, so does getting wooden armor 5 times in a row off SBQ...
---
Damn smoothskins.
---
That I agree with. Identify and punish like fuck.
---
South :)
---
I did when I first started, I was really nervous that people would just show up and destroy everything. But after playing for a while I decided that if someone wanted to destroy everything, they could start from the outside. So I unlocked my CAMP for those of us nice people.  
---
I did like half of the achievements during the beta and Xbox won’t give me the ones from like leaving Vault 76 or reaching level 10. 
---
That's better than nothing. I've had dupers initiate a trade with me on numerous occasions, offering mutations and 3* TSE/be weapons for normally around 500 caps. I don't doubt the legitimacy until I see a stack of a specific TSE (two shot explosive) in their inventory. Mutations are my second biggest indicator ONLY if they have a bunch of different serums. But they could be very lucky and have found multiple serum plans, so that by itself is not enough to draw an infallible conclusion.
---
I got you
---
It does but in the form of 1 extra shot. It also depends on the total build/armor you have + the weapon they are using.
---
Don't scare me dude!
---
It uses fusion cores:

---
I’d say any horse events those give you some pretty good loot and you always get a legendary plus you can farm them. I’d also suggest taking some workshops, I’d say Mire and Savage divide for you they can come with high levels in waves up to 4 so as long as you hit all enemies once and your turrets kill them you’ll get exp
---
Because the majority of problems in game are directly related to duping. Seriously you are ruining the game because you dont have the skill to play without cheating.
---
Thanks again! I checked again, got the plans this time and bought them,
---
Fallout 76 is probably the worst game ever
---
A few questions on this:
---
1.	Do you clear out the area completely of enemies? Or can you just run through and only kill the legendary enemies?
---
2.	Do you loot all the bodies (every item so no blood pools remain)?
---
3.	I’ve got the legendaries to spawn consistently HOWEVER after having a 3* spawn for the first time, each subsequent time is a fake legendary (no star) this happened four times consecutively at three different locations (West Tek, Watoga Civic Centre and Medical Centre). Is there some trick I’m missing here? Is it something to do with the above? Or is it returning to the area too early (&lt;30 minutes)
---
4.	I had someone else spawn in on the area and this caused a 2* to start spawning consistently at West Tek (in addition to the fake legendaries). Any idea how multiple players legendary spawns coalesce together?
---
I only found 50 k of em 
---
I used that mod on ps4 and it looked amazing but DESTROYED the frame rate, very true. 
---
So I made my first run in to the zone a few minutes ago...someone nuked White Springs.
---
Looked at the map and it only appeared to be 4 high lvl guys in the blast zone. All 100+ lvl
---
I ran toward their location and found one guy so I followed him back to the tennis club. He ran in and went down stairs. I stood in the doorway and let the glowing ones come to me. One at a time in single file line,  I was crackin' skulls with my super sledge. The bodies were hittin' the floor and then the sledge broke!!! Like a true noob the only other melee weapon I had was the Blade of Baset. I got overrun and decided to retreat. I tried to find a high ground spot from which to fight but to no avail I got dropped by the mob.
---
I'll be licking my wounds and prepping for the next time...thanks for all the suggestions!
---
Agreed. Even as a level 78, I usually hop up on the roof of the shed and try to just clear the ground of all the riff-raff around everyone else do they can focus on the SBQ
---
Gillette would be disappointed. 
---
Sry, an honest mistake. Didnt mean to scare ya
---
I would say your version is more pvp than any other. Such ingenuity, with little physical effort. A big fan.
---
I played for an hour earlier and was disconnected twice. It was weird. 
---
Go to Poseidon Energy. It's swarming with level 5-10 scorch, and pretty much every friggin one of them will have either a hunting rifle or short pump action shotty with a handful of rounds. Most of it is close quarters hallway combat and you can engage with melee before they can get too many shots at you, so do what you can to conserve ammo during the run.
---
After you've looted everything you should have more guns than you can carry and at least a couple hundred rounds of .308 and shells. Scrap every single one of those weapons and you should learn a fair number of mods in the process.
---
Now you have ammo and a way of modifying your gun to be stronger, so hopefully you'll use less. 
---
What I Want to know is, I see them with a pipe pistol, but they drop an assault rifle, or hunting rifle, so how is the damage they deal to me calculated?
---
Is a Super Mutant attacking me with a Board but drops a Super Sledge doing the damage of a board or a Super sledge?
---
Just have 20 stimpacks near a cliff with a buddy. Have the buddy jump off, die, then you revive him/her. Rinse, repeat until the achievement pops up (Took about 20 mins using Charleston Landfill cliff).
---
No, actually that increases it because you go back again for more to get better loot. Maybe increase your luck special too. But I agree, higher levels should get better loot than wooden armor.
---
I did it yesterday and a L200+ guy was trying to run \*away\* from legendaries just to make sure everyone got a chance to tag it, because he could 1 shot it easy.  So some people are thoughtful and some people just want to show off their (probably ill gotten) OP guns.  
---
Nuka Dark is +6 Str/End and 90% water.
---
I forgot HP, but Cherry is 450 HP and 150 AP, Quantum is 600 HP and 300 instant AP.
---
The vendor in the Whitespring bunker should have one and a plan
---
I send out tons of random invites because I have the body guard perk and I like being on a team, makes the wasteland less lonely. So if you're in a lobby and get a random team invite from 'YikesMaster' it's just little old harmless me. 
---
Visit his profile. You'll find em
---
getting the codes online is AS IF you got the codes together with a bunch of other people who also want to drop nukes. someone can flat out give you 999 caps but it's on you if you want to accept their gift
---
At least that's RNG, not some shitstain crashing the server out of pure laziness.
---
tip for anyone reading this: I find that a Tesla Rifle is really best for tagging (I guess unless you have a build that makes it really powerful). Just a couple shots and you've tagged everyone.
---
No worries :)
---
Just have 20 stimpacks near a cliff with a buddy. Have the buddy jump off, die, then you revive him/her. Rinse, repeat until the achievement pops up (Took about 20 mins using Charleston Landfill cliff).

It's comments like this that make me wanna go and fine tune my Fallout 4 skills.
---
Yes, but its more expensive this time.
---
Theres prolly others out there that peeps are keeping close to their chest this time around.
---
It's a troll, just move on
---
Are you on PC? 
---
Y'all don't have the damage output compared to my quad explosive lever action
---
Almost as though servers can crash without the client seeing issues beforehand
---
I'll add ya! I rarely play with people and get lonely as well. 
---
It does that after you accept the brotherhood of steel mission that makes the technical data a quest item. They only want you to hand in 1 at a time, so your inventory purges itself.
---
 PC, I should have said that. I'm kinda still pissed off. ;)
---
I'm talking against the Queen.
---
I like how we're all getting excited over identical items from FO4. Super tight 
---
You can continue it on at the next point.  It’s glitched, but doesn’t have to be restarted like it tells you.  
---
I DC’ed on the last stage and just went in the glassed cavern and finished it.
---
If you are missing achievements that you would've earned in the B.E.T.A, then you would have to make a new character to earn them for real. Bethesda announced it shortly after launch.
---
I didn't knooooow the gun was loaded 
---
Did some one call OP sir?
---
Damn, whenever I launch a nuke, i invite people near whitesprings to see if their base is their, then nuke it lol 
---
nice, thanks :)
---
So tse shotgun still instant kill?
---
Speculations and opinions that are in direct contradiction to fact? No, probably keep that to yourself at is has absolutely no value. 
---
Example
---
"The Dallas cowboys are probably going to win the super bowl in my opinion"
---
Except they were just eliminated from the playoffs. Fact directly contradicting my "opinion".... Making it absolutely useless 
---
If you were some kind of Video Game Market analyst then maybe your speculation would be helpful.
---
But you're not.
---
It will be lost on logout.
---
Damn. Thanks
---
Ah I misread it based on a parent comment. Thought he wrote alien and fog crawler. 
---
Voting machines may be involved and also all the ham radios scattered about?
---
It's so cost inefficient... but so fun.
---
Yup. Saw a comment earlier about that.
---
Sounds about right. YOU can’t drop a quest item, but they can sure drop it for you 
---
&gt;FOUR PERFECTLY ALIGNED WATER PUMPS THAT TOOK FUCKING TWO HOURS TO ALIGN!!!!
---
Maybe you'd be better off with a game that's specifically about building.  The C.A.M.P. aspect is secondary to the main game so it's never going to be perfect.  Clearly it works well enough for most people as evidenced by all the shared screenshots.
---
The server was literally unplayable while they were there, I teleported close to them and started walking that way, everyone left the server and the issue stopped. Paranoid? The game has a problem with dupers, and when the same situation happened before last patch, it was 99% of the time because of dupers.
---
np, enjoy it. One of my favorite weapons in the game by far
---
OP You are a legend! Holy crap!
---
If i was you, i would've probably been pissed and started acting toxic. But damn man, this is a shitshow with these griefers, i hope Bethesda bans them. And i hope Fallout 76 becomes a good game. (I'm not a FO76 player).
---
But still tho, what you did there was pure gold! 
---
Gold jerry, gold!
---
If i have gold, i would've gave it to you.
---
So wasting my time for nothing increases the game's longevity? Sorry but having to use 2k ammo on SBQ and getting only a 1 star piece of wooden armor doesn't make me want to play more.
---
Having my time wasted getting the ammo, doing the silo run, killing the queen for nothing, does not make me want to play the game more. Now go through that process 4 more times. Fun game right? Totally worth the mind numbing grind hoping for SOMETHING and not even getting a plan or anything else for your trouble.
---
I'm on PC, but I noticed the same thing last night, I could actually see it my pretty white flowerly dioors. 
---
Yep. Lowest I could get for the vendor was 8.3k, but im seeing it sold for 4k from players.
---
Yeah, I hope they fix this dupe glitch it’s annoying and destroys merchants like me chance of actually having a job. I was selling 3 handmades yesterday but each one asked if it was TSE and I lost all potential customers to the disgusting dupers
---
Huh? 
---
I am asking to see the source of your shared info as to learn further from reading and not from hands on experimentation. 
---
Is this confusing?
---
If Bethesda we're to release new content weeks after launch, the game community would have reacted negatively.
---
It would be assumed that the new content was actually supposed to be launch content and the community would take it as proof of an unfinished game.
---
Me personally I found it rather immasculine.
---
Yup. I bought the plans for me and my friend, 4k each 
---
Added you but the two shot lever I had disappeared sometime I have a quad lever or two shot auto handmade 
---
You seem like a very toxic and unfriendly person, having a bad day or are you generally this unfriendly to random users who are just posting their thoughts and opinions on a game series they love?. 
---
Also be aware that anyone who tries to claim that workshop with you will automatically be able to PvP you without you needing to fire back.
---
Yep try to get through it mate.  There's lots of people that understand how infuriating this game is at times.  I had that floor thing going on as well and had to take it all down.  At least I didn't have the budget screwed over like yours though.
---
I do have a suggestion for you.  Why not start a new 2nd character for a few days.  Maybe after the patch, if your on Console it will sort itself out.  There's lots of the community who would give you some duplicate plans.  Plus I think your ATOM store items carry over.  If you were on Xbox I have a good number of duplicates you could have.  Realise your CAMP would be smaller, but at least you know how to gain XP quickly.
---
Whatever you do stay safe.
---
Could be a coincidence, but all 3 times I spawned him, there was a blast zone at the scorch queen.  GL finding him. 
---
 Ill see if pushing it works, but I get that same search circle with the BOS fortification as the target every time. Hi ho.
---
 This is my level 25 alt so the GC will be entertaining. I just picked up a beastly shotgun out of a dead bot at Watoga Station. A crap ton of stuff, I just took a bit. ;) 
---
Sounds like you either stepped on a TSE invisible rake or are around when one of us gets the “I am death, everything die around me” mutation.
---
Well if it’s not suppose to be in the game someone really messed up cause it’s in the prima guide. I have yet to find it. 
---
Thx for this
---
Bless you 
---
If your on Xbox I was probably there experiencing that with you lol
---
Here's the thing right, RNG doesn't make the game better when the pool includes pretty much everything and can be pretty much any combination of effects. So no, RNG^RNG^RNG is not a mechanic that will keep players around.
---
Overlooking that little pond southwest of Vault 76. Cozy compact little cabin with 2 water purifiers (1 for me, 1 for whoever stumbles upon my little slice of heaven.)
---
It's still happening on PS4. I also have the game on PC, but I don't play it as often. I'm about to log on now though so I'll check. 
---
But more chance of crash I think and lag I did it n Jesus it was crazy 
---
Almost as though that doesn’t disprove a thing I said. 
---
Unseen issues include someone attempting to dupe.
---
I didn’t ask for a dupe I asked for a shotgun ?
---
Idk, it makes more sense to actually have to get the code pieces but if they did that there would be even less people launching nukes. As is most people just wait around for someone else to launch them instead of doing it themselves. 
---
Or when a super mutant is absolutely shredding  your health with a pipe rifle but when you use one it does less damage than a BB gun.
---
Like, what’s with the prick reply anyway? You shared info and then act like a douche when I asked for confirmation. This is weird.
---
I was solo a few days ago (level 35). First time walking around in the Bog and came across a BOS surface to air system near a fissure site. 
---
After repairing the StA, I went looking for a fight. 
---
Is yours max level ?
---
Read your full post; which incites that if you think some players are duping to immediately investigate and initiate them with trade offers just to check their inventory like some kind of Gestapo.
---
Rngesus isnt looking at you right now is all.
---
No worries! I had to redo alot with my new character after the game came out. I just made her, did all the early quests with level 10. Then I deleted her after having a buddy help me transfer all of the stuff I got with the smurf character, to my main one. 
---
I actually sold all but 30 when I found out and they've been difficult to find ever since. My supply has been slowly decreasing and I'm afraid that I may have to buy some some day.
---
Ps4 is pretty full at all hours of the day my ghoul
---
Imagine what these weapons would be worth if there were no duping. 25k, 50k? I mean, no one would get rid of them if they only had one themselves.
---
Ok thank you
---
Thank you
---
when you reach lv 50 do certain quests and your guaranteed a decent lv 50 legendary weapon.
---
Lol this is a good one
---
I saw someone wearing it in December, that should be before the dev room was first accessed. It should be in the game but I have no clue where it is
---
K
---
What is it even for in this game? FO4 NPCs have you caps for it, but I haven't found it's use yet?
---
Have definitely been there, but the re-nuking today wasn’t bad. It was coming close to the wire with the SBQ, but luckily this player came in and was able to deal a ton of damage to her. Know anything about possible builds or weapons that would allow for that?
---
Well that is very cool. I will try this out!
---
I'm sorry to tell you, but that's exactly what paranoia looks like. Duping never required more than 2 people, having 5 there is a complete waste of resources. It doesn't speed up the duping and it just creates a higher chance of failure. I can't give you one certain explanation as to why there would be that many people right next to each other, but this is just straight up witch hunting. This game is a MMORPG, it is literally meant to role play with other people. There are a hundred reasons why people would team up and be next to each other. You're acting like instability is unheard of in this game...five people with camps built next to each other would almost certainly cause some intense lag without doing anything malicious. Maybe you teleporting in there disconnected them? But nah, that's impossible, they were all duping and instantly dropped everything when they saw another person despite there being relatively little you could do about it
---
Hell, if you're so sure it was dupers, maybe it was people spamming the everliving fuck out of boards, in denial that it was actually patched
---
On Xbox.... consider me warned and slightly terrified!! :/
---
Since you can bitch at him can you give me a timeframe for a new content drop?
---
Yea gotta admit its extra bad tonight on ps4 as well
---
How did you manage this?
---
I've stopped playing for now because I ran out of things I enjoyed doing. I'm hoping to come back once they add fresh content!
---
Low effort but effective troll, good on you.
---
Thank ye kindly! I’ll do the same. 
---
Bethesda definitely has to nip this in the bud before player vending is a thing. If not, then it's pretty much game over
---
Why would I hate you when I can just feel sad that you can't actually okay the game and need a crutch? 
---
On the same vein I won't feel bad when your account gets banned either :)
---
Personal preference: perforating receiver.
---
I found if you have one person sort of "herd" him he will last longer then being held with thier inventory open.
---
Please forgive the stupid question, but when it says Marsupial gives you -4 int, i realize with class freak it will be down to like -1 but won't that make it so I won't be able to equip one of my int perk cards?
---
I was actually looking for this info last night but didn’t want to risk it. Thanks for the heads up. 
---
How would you know this unless you were a duper? The only thing Bethesda has mentioned is that workshops were causing server instability 
---
It comes in handy
---
&gt;...Yes, I know what arguably means. Which is why I pointed at that people are arguing about it.
---
&gt;Indeed, people are arguing the PvP is griefing, but that doesn't make them right.
---
Again, arguably means that a standpoint is potentially defensible. If something is wrong, it isn't arguable. Therefore you are using the word incorrectly.
---
Regardless:
---
Your argument basically boils down to "If it's an intentional game mechanic, it can't be griefing." This is an untenable position, because the vast majority of examples of griefing are working 100% within a game's intended framework. If I blow up your house in Minecraft, is that not griefing because the devs made TNT?
---
The definition of "griefing" that the rest of us are working under is something along the lines of "deriving enjoyment in a game by making other players have less fun." If I take advantage of the current PvP mechanics in order to harm other players' experience with the game, I am griefing, regardless of the fact that PvP exists.
---
I'm gonna be honest, I'm not sure what definition of griefing you're using if you think three endgame level players destroying a brand new players house is somehow not griefing.
---
Explain why?
---
Might want to look into White Knight also. 😉
---
turn in at camp venture.
---
Workshops. 
---
Verified this, in a blast zone while wearing PA and diseased, about an hour ago.
---
People still play this game? 
---
They should do it quickly or when the duper’s get to the vendor plans, game over for me and other merchants man
---
Melee + TSE shotgun.  
---
Oh, you wanted to be an OP sniper?  
---
HA!  
---
j/k.  Since it’s not a legendary, just build what puts out the best damage to weight ratio, since you are getting no love on rifle weights.
---
He doesnt even play the game. Just a kid trying to troll.
---
Level 40, I just picked up a Level 50 one which is why Im selling the 40.
---
Mirelurk problems.
---
That is hilarious though.
---
Oof. 
---
I think the problem is that people are willing to pay real $ for in game items.
---
The current top duper on ebay has already made over $2500 from selling duped items according to their sold listing history.
---
For you this game is about fun, for them it's how they make a living. Look back at the Diablo auction house - people were making a hundreds a day while only spending 30 minutes doing auctions. Some other dude way back in the day figured out an exploit in some game I can't remember and walked away with half a million dollars.
---
Most of these guys don't even play the game. They are just in it for the cash. The game engine is too exploitable for this problem to ever go away.
---
Doesnt matter what it is, it doesnt belong to you. You are not entitled to other peoples things.
---
*facepalm*
---
i know i could cheese it but id rather get that one though regular play.
---
Paracetamol:)
---
Left arm, right arm, left leg and helmet if there is one.
---
Or any better chest/ right leg
---
😂😂😂 love your message response!
---
Haha love it... both the gramfailure and rage
---
As the group medic (when the group is actually on), I was toying with the idea of running as a quack surgeon when I play with friends. Already bought the old possum sign for my place. Need some signage that denotes I'm a doc to put with it. The ability to craft my own "medicine" would be outstanding. 
---
Audio settings in the game menu.
---
Idk, man. I ran out of soda the other day and checked the game and people were duping still; dupers stole my soda. Prove they didn't!
---
Yup, the mod is consumed when you install it. I think this is working as intended.
---
There is literally zero point to attack someone's base other than for griefing, or to get your jollies out of blowing up other people's stuff as the system is implemented.
---
Raiders raid for resources, you get nothing from other player camps except a wanted level.
---
The problem is that the game is a gameplay shitfest where PVP is tacked on because why not. I love PVP games in general (most of the games I play are PVP), but this one just doesn't work.
---
With the state of the game as it is, I'm ok with just getting the codes online.
---
1. First silo run, had it almost done, party member crashes or, I'm stuck with all the mobs. I'm thinking he'll have to go through all the crap we already did to get back to me, so I nope out of there. Admittedly, we'd done no research, but I remember thinking there were no checkpoints, so we were screwed.
---
2. Went back the next night, completed the quest, another team mate launches the nuke. I appear to get credit for it, but the next day, the quest is back in my log. The guy who fired the nuke and our other team mate got completion, I didn't. Possibly pertinent to the situation, the team mate who launched it, while I could see him, and my rad sponge and team medic affected him, couldn't see me at all, nor did I appear to be in the team on his screen. 
---
Honestly, I'm not exactly anxious to go back. But as buggy as it currently is. 
---
Brother, are you on Ps4? Breath and find some fun people to make it worth while. 
---
It might be one of those extremely rare drops with a genuine way to get it in the game - we didn't know that jet pack plans existed until a few weeks ago because they are so rare. But what makes me think that these are not in the game yet is that they have damage resistance, while no other helmet in the game does (well technically that mascot head has 1dr). I've personally made 4 runs to the glassed cavern in the past and never seen it, but that doesn't mean it's not there
---
Fair enough! The experience is what you make of it! I do wish you luck then! :)
---
He was running and jumping around (with that extra jump height mutation). 
---
i think i top out at 415, being well fed increases your max hp, and then there is a perk that doubles the well fed bonus :)
---
Words of advice: It's not how fast you can get to the end goal. It's the journey to it. Also if you don't get what you want, go buy it from someone. Trading exists as much does RNG.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
My guess is that they were intentionally wracking up huge bounties by leveling camps, and then the unmarked friends would claim the bounty and get 10's of thousands of caps, the marked person would get a debuff for not being able to pay the bounty, and the whole team would get richer
---
Brotherhood T-60 paint jobs primarily 
---
as much as i agree with u, i would have to add that this also causes griefing.
---
today, my buddy lvl 59 and i lvl132, both legit players got attacked by 4 lvl100+ players. They came by and scattered around. I saw them in their power suits and all and I figured it was trouble.
---
i go into area chat, and i manage to get one of their attention. I asked if i could help with anything and he says we duper hunters. I told him we dont dupe and he requested to see my stuff via trade. i allowed him and then he went to my buddy and he saw there was nothing out of the ordinary. Then one of his other team mates joins the area chat and says "Fuck them, level his base anyway" He does that, goes wanted and i kill him, one of my missed shots initiated pvp with  one of the other players and i get obliterated.
---
I tell my friend to leave the area as he got hammered too. i lost my base so i had nothing to lose. I seeked revenge and went chameleon off my spawn. I took all 4 of them out one by one and they kept seeking revenge. i moved to the highground around my base and kept farming them while invisible. i managed to pull over 600 caps worth of bounties, so did my friend. After a short while. They stopped coming back. 
---
Point is, players r more likely to be dickheads once they are grouped up on a hunt. Even if it is for good intentions, it gets twisted down the road easily.
---
PVP definitely needs works and that wanted level is great for baiting players into PVP. Now you set your base in my spot and it's getting leveled. Every time. Because that's just rude
---
They're operating on debate club dweeb rules where being 0.001% inaccurate means YOU LOSE I WIN YOU'RE FAKE NEWS I'M GOSPEL TRUTH
---
or that was before the scammers felt like bragging about making it in to the dev room :P
---
This is the spot !!! Ok .. so I freeze anywhere close to this area. Haven't been back here since beta. This is where I found a set of keys on the backseat of one of the jetskis. 
---
Nice Camp ! Wish I could travel around the section of map. 
---
Worse? Shit, ive found 2 two-shot guns ever. Not even TSE. Although i do see them often. I just assumed they were heavily duped.
---
This guy again. I wouldn’t worry to much about what they say OP.
---
Armor penetration. I found an anti armor Gauss, popped the perforating capacitor on it, it almost completely negates enemy armor. 
---
If you have all the mods, piercing might be better (armor penetration plus improved reload speed).
---
But the Gauss has such high damage, any kind of armor penetration means you're doing amazing damage on any enemy.
---
I'll give it a gander
---
Yeah, I'm not holding my breath for pvp balance in this game, lol. I mean, cmon, look at how the game was released, look at what they have done so far. PVP was added to this game to check a box on the list of features.
---
I usually send invites to either fast travel or to give away some stuff. Last night me and s buddy held the robot vendor at Charleston so randos could buy rare outfits. Still waiting on a long coat though. But I always have pacifist on and just try to help out. 
---
I came across a Behemoth sitting submerged in a pond in the southish central part of the map. I hadn’t seen one in the game at all yet and had completely forgotten about them, so I thought it was a named monster of some sort. So I shot it, and it stood up, and I was like “Oooooooh. Oh. Oh no.”
---
That's awesome. I'm around level 50 but I do the same thing if there's others nearby. I'll even just tank a baddie, letting it hit me over and over (I have some life saver perks/armor active, so I very rarely die) while yelling/emoting that I got one ready to tag.
---
Dupers are probably trying get their dupes done before the patch tomorrow. 
---
[VIDEO OF ME DOING IT](https://youtu.be/Lh6eqaTL5S4)
---
I accidentally went wanted last night on my 2nd character lvl 22.  A lvl 54 guy and his lvl 86 friend tried coming to kill me so I decided to have a little fun and killed them 3 times each after they attacked me all I had was an automatic handmade lol. After they finally killed me they killed my friend I was playing with and went wanted. So I switched characters and went to hunt them down but by the time I got back in I was blocked lmao.

---
 "The Fallout Classic Collection, which contains the original Fallout, Fallout Tactics and Fallout 2, is only available on PC, but players who bought the game on PS4 or Xbox One will also be granted entitlements to download the collection through Bethesda.net on PC"
---
Erm no... I have only played on PS4, never PC and I recieved the Classic Collection for free. 
---
Maybe have a read of the article from Bethesda as it states "As shared previously, anyone who logged into the full release of Fallout 76 on any platform in 2018 will receive the Fallout Classic Collection on PC. All user entitlements have now been granted." 
---
They spawn at Sutton Train station, seen there at like 5 or more times, I keep my base in the hills by there so I'm there often.
---
They also spawn on Grahm kinda often, you can force him to spawn by server hopping here; 
---
https://imgur.com/a/WhX7GJ8
---
He has about a 1 in 50 chance to spawn there and when he spawn he starts walking towards Grafton. 
---
Whether or not you believe the attitude is deserved, it generally makes people less likely to listen to what you have to say. Aggressive attitudes tend to lead to defensive attitudes, or even more aggressive attitudes from the other person, which typically is bad for convincing anyone of your point.
---
That's not true it is free for anyone who played on any platform in 2018 including consoles.
---
It just can only be installed on PC since they are older games.
---
I installed mine free last week and I have only played on PS4.
---
OP, try logging out and back into your Bethesda account or put in a support ticket. It should let you install without buying. You could also try clicking buy and see if maybe it lets you install without asking for payment.
---
It's still an expected and normal operation of the game. Shit loot tables don't cause lag and server crashes. 
---
I understand your point about being gifted something, but the difference is that no one has an unlimited supply of caps that they could gift to anyone who wants them. Caps are a physical item, which was my point...you should need to be in possession of the physical asset.
---
Getting the codes online is more like finding the codes being written down on a notice board outside the entrance to the silo. 
---
 That is just your instance, but of course one could team up, if that name is right.
---
Damn son, I feel lucky that some random player just gave me these plans after stumbling upon my pad out in the middle of nowhere.
---
What would you want for the tesla rifle?
---
Arguably means that it may be argued, not that it's a correct opinion.
---
My argument doesn't boil down to that at all. It boils down to "It's not griefing just because you don't like it."
---
That isn't what happened. They simply used the PvP mechanics available to all players.
---
Is it griefing if the levels are reversed? And if not, then it's not griefing simply because the levels aren't even, and if it is, then you're arguing that PvP is griefing, which is simply ridiculous.
---
"Sir, are you lost?" 
---
"No, i just figured that we're friends now so i followed you. Hi friend."
---
First time I joined a SBQ fight was lvl 45 in Excavator armor and I was trying to contribute as much as possible to the horde and queen. I can’t imagine being much use below that level
---
it said "buy now" for me too, just click on it and it will flash to the install screen. Its some ui.... get ready folks. BUG
---
I am down under on PC and I have the occasional disconnect but on par with my The Division disconnects so maybe just lucky or maybe the Oceania servers aren't stressed as much.
---
Are you NA or EU maybe?
---
I usually keep a workshop for hours on end.
---
I dunno as I’m PC only, but does it require a Bethesda account login?  If not, you’re probably gonna be lvl 1.  
---
We’ll gladly help you out if that’s the case.
---
Were you hoarding a bunch of flux that decomposed?
---
Well I guess you right, but it is peoples camps .. and people do lock their homes ..
---
&gt; please note we dont encourage vigilanties harassing people 
---
kick rocks
---
It doesn't change the number of the attribute you have, so you can still use the perk card.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It however changes the behind the scenes stats that your Int would have given you.
---
As an example, your int is 5, and it gave you a bonus of 10 points into crafting. Marsupial carries a -4 Int penalty, so now your 10 points of crafting goes down to 2 points of crafting. However, your INT is still listed as 5 so you can still use INT cards up to 5  points.
---
To be fair, those sub 50s could be contributing in ways that aren't visible to you. For example, my body has a charisma support alt that can't do shit for damage, but he's great to have on a team. He shares rank 3 rad sponge so no one has to waste radaway, and he's got all the fun perks that do things like revive you with extra health &amp; health regen, friendly fire, etc. 
---
Unfortunately he's squishy, so he gets a few shots in and then he camps in the relative safety of the shed watching our health meters, calling out mobs that are sneaking up behind us, etc.
---
1000 sound good 
---
They haven't said that at all, lol. Please provide proof. 
---
I'm pretty sure you have misinterpreted something completely unrelated.
---
Good ol merica. Gulf coast. 
---
If it worked, people wouldn't complain (or more precisely, have the same complaints about different games over a period spanning roughly 16 years).
---
But only because other players already found the pieces and crowd sources the code. Its not like just written down for free. Other players fond and decipher the codes, and are nice enough to share them. If you want to figure it out on your own, you're welcome to it
---
Just to try and help, I believe most damage buffs use the weapon's base damage as the number that receives the percentage buff. 
---
Would your ten percent fit smoothly into that equation?
---
Ooooooh yeah. From a guy that’s totally been apart of something like that, NEVER accept random friend invites. Quite possibly the worst idea you could have haha. It’s far to easy to figure out where camps are as it is. Don’t make it easier y’all.
---
And if for some reason you decide to accept that invite and a bunch of people fast travel to your camp, just leave the server. Far easier to just find a new server than to deal with the repair. 
---
Oh and if y’all weren’t aware, the contractor perk card also reduces the cost to repair stuff so it’s super recommended to use that perk with any camp related activities! 
---
It's pretty easy to find at Welch station, I went looking for it the other day and got it on my 2nd try.
---
Lots of loot.
---
I'm level 48 after probably 74 hours, playing solo. That's more time than I put into most single-player games. In another dozen levels I'll probably have all the perks I want. Optimizing my equipment could take an unlimited amount of time, but already (outside of nukes) the game's starting to feel pretty easy, with just a sword and pistol, no power armor or team mates.
---
My main game the last few years has been Elder Scrolls Online. I'm probably 2000+ hours into it, but it's hard to know for sure. I have some months to kill until the next chapter comes out and 76 has been helping fill that time.
---
If you want to share an account on one computer and play at different times, you can have up to 5 characters. If you're playing two accounts/computers, you can join each other on the same server.
---
Europe enforces a [right to resell](https://brodies.com/binformed/legal-updates/european-court-confirms-the-right-to-resell-used-software-licences) software, so you see a lot of preowned European licenses for all sorts of software. Whether or not they have to honor EU licenses resold to the US seems like a bit of a grey area to me, so I don't have a straight answer there though many companies do honor them.
---
That's a horrible thing to have happened, but it's your cross to bear man. You can choose to be "hypersensitive" and be hung up on it forever, or you can move on with your life, either way it's nobody's issue but your own, nobody was being bullied here.
---
I agree with most everything you've said, and you've made me think about the idea of a server wipe.  But I still go back to the idea of how well it worked with FF14.  
---
/shrug
---
Oh lord I missed your last line. Nevermind.
---
Standard combat shotgun or Molotov cocktails.  We can all share.
---
I had considered this before posting...and I’m ok with the idea of launches being less common.
---
I would never presume to tell people how to play a game, but as son as I get to the “nuke, farm, repeat” point, I’ll be moving on to another game.
---
Please play a different game.
---
That didn't work either, it just brought me to checkout on the website.
---
Yeah I still go by daily and only ran into that Mirelurk queen once. It's a great stop.
---
They only thing I lock is my house and lead extractor but the workshop and water purifier are open for anyone to use since you know I don’t want no one to look through my home lol
---
Commenting on mobile so I can watch it at home later...
---
Im just saying not kill random people dude.

So glitchy today ..my character looked naked for 5 minutes, partners weapon started to vibrate ..it was a wild ride 😘

We have one taking Tanking and taking the aggro,

One with Support Perks and doing Aoe Damage to Incoming Adds
---
And the remaining 2 focusing down the Queen.
---
(We usually have all focus when landed)
---
Commando I believe 
---
I do this already. I can't do the same damage as some of these super high power weapons so if I see scorched or other enemies around I take them out if I see them around. Any players being attacked that I see I kill the attacking enemy before directing my slightly more limited firepower to the queen. Every bit helps right?
---
Its from the Dev Room, my friend has one
---
It's unfortunate that with the way item IDs are assigned in this game, there's literally no way to know which items are duped and which ones aren't. All they can do is try to patch the dupes by researching the techniques that are discovered and shared, and ban players that show evidence of duping (YouTubers, reports, etc). So they'll always be playing catch-up and there will never be a way to remove the already duplicated items from the game.
---
I don't know a TON about the engine's structure, but I do know that every item of the same type has a unique hexadecimal ID, like base Nuka Cola is 0004835d. There's nothing else that identifies the item as far as I know, like the date/time it was spawned, whether it was a copy or a new one, etc. I think the only thing they could potentially do is do an automated search for specific items like anything with a Two-shot explosive formID, and anyone who has over a certain threshold of the same item in their inventory (say, over 10 of the same TSE shotgun) gets reduced down to 1. Though I'm not sure if that's even feasible.
---
I'm camped on a junk pile and pond just north of Harper's Ferry. Every now and then I get an SB attack, but normally I just have level 40ish blood bugs and radtoads to deal with.

&gt;A griefer or bad faith player is a player in a multiplayer video game who deliberately irritates and harasses other players within the game (trolling), **using aspects of the game in intended or unintended ways.**
---
Emphasis mine. Let's see your definition. And you have yet to answer my question: is blowing up someone's house in Minecraft griefing or not? Because there is an objectively wrong answer.
---
My Fridge quit this weekend &amp; my soda is lukewarm....Fricken Dupers!
---
I get accused all the time because im level 280ish with tse weapons, but i actually have like 475ish hours played and i have about eight friends who manage store characters in game where they barter with people who have (definitely) duped, when you run a store i guess they cant really afford to say no, as they give those items to a streamer friend who raffles off a couple every few days. But the main reason i get blamed is because i have a stack of 12 pump tse that i have been giving out to lower levels so they can combat the dupers more fairly (tho one time i accidentally started a gang war with over twelve people killing each other with the shottys)
---
They ignore you even if you attack them. It's pretty great.
---
I like the "horde" ones where you have to travel all over the f'ing map to find one f'ing enemy. Top notch!

Train cart west of the Watoga train station can have some rare plan sitting on a box - that includes the marine wetsuit or marine armor. There is a skeleton with a submachine gun and some .45 ammo close to that box inside the same train car.
---
The black mountain thingy in the forest (north of point pleasant) has some TNT domes around it. As far as I know, only two of them are available right now. One has some alien blaster rounds and a plan for the alien blaster fusion mag, the other has some nuka cola themed clothes and a plan for T-51b nuka cola paint.
---
A safe in a broken down, submerged house in the toxic valley has an alien blaster and hazmat suit. The house is located just southwest of the butterfly on the map, close to the mountains.
---
The Charleston train station has a very rare vendor that can spawn in the barn right next to it. That vendor carries two unique plans for clocks, and two random clothing items. They can be regular things like halloween costumes or straight jackets that you can find in the game, but it can also have something like the hunter's long coat that's unobtainable anywhere else.
---
Turning in technical documents for the BoS can rarely get you a plan for the T-60 initiate paint
---
The watoga BoS vendor can supposedly have some extremely rare and valuable plans, but I haven't seen any yet. I can't remember specifically which one, but one of the ranger towers in central cranberry bog has one of the few chainsaw spawns in the game. It's on top of a box or cabinet in a shed
---
Nope didn't work.. Thanks though appreciate it 
---
This is a fair point, but my post was really about the intended mechanic.
---
In any case, I’d imagine it wouldn’t matter so much if it bugged out or crashed while you were inside, because you’d still have the pieces on you...right?
---
yea it's amazing
---
Can you read?
---
Yes and yes, then get White Knight under Agility (and leave it on) for 90% reduction in armor damage. 
---
My camp is also on a road that Grahm walks down. 
---
Instead of going through my camp, he just walked up to it, eventually realized he couldn't go his usual route, and de-spawned.
---
I think he doesn't understand the boundary of anything you build, even if he could walk through it. So doorways, walls with roofs over them, etc. he is confused by. But he will walk next to a building you built.
---
&gt;Just south of Whitesprings on a junk node.
---
Just off the road at the very southern edge of the gold course? I was there for a while, but I relocated when I found another junk pile that also had water access.
---
Haven’t seen anything change.  Am on PC.  
---
Whatever they did hasn’t made any changes to what I see over lvl 45.
---
This mans living in 3019.....
---
Yes, all the armor helmets (Combat, Marine, Metal, Robots [Assaultron, Eyebot, Sentry]) are in the game and you can learn to make them yourself by scrapping them. That's how I learned to make them all. All it took to get the cycle started was someone getting an actual item and learning to craft it by scrapping. So, I suspect all Armor Helmets are going to be considered rare to start with but will become much less rare over time due to people learning to craft them.
---
I can make all of the armor helmets (except Wood, that one is not learnable/craftable). So you can ask me to make some for you and you can scrap them and learn to make them yourself. Look me up IGN: jchamlin.
---
Sure did. That's me in the xo1, that green pile of goop is also me for the ground zero achievement: https://imgur.com/a/fG9jXON
---
Of course, I am seeking attention. This is no mere mission of the game.
---
Yeah, just finished that on Saturday myself. Last achievement was hit level 25. Really wanted to finish this since I have it on disc and I'm getting the RE2 collector's edition next week.
---
I'll keep that in mind. Nice work!
---
Yeah, OTHER people found them, not you. This was my point, that I thought you would have to earn it. 
---
Nope. Only ever been in a nuke zone once and never collected anything 
---
Where'd you move to? I may prefer the central location and weak ass attackers to water access.
---
Why would i want a fresh server? I ant someone else to have fixed the power plants...
---
Ah, that makes sense. None of the other helmets have condition bars though; only gas masks, the urban scout mask, and the responder fire fighter mask. I'll have to check if repairing them above 100% gives DR
---
Better inventory (think that’s the name) and perk loadout are must have mods imo
---
Sounds like your stomach **really** didn't agree with that meat!!
---
&gt;Locking bases keeps out wildlife,
---
Don't be too sure of that. Twice I've come home to find scorched wailing on my generator, which is in a locked room on the second floor of my house.
---
Are you on PC? If I remember right, one of my buddies ran into this. Apparently there's an auto-run button. I think they hit that accidentally. (I use a controller, so I don't know what button it is)
---

I just wish half the items from the Atomic shop weren’t glitches to varying degrees
---
The legendary rate for Morgantown is damn near non-existent though, I've nuked it a few times, tons of glowing ones but either no or very few legendaries.  
---
What about the messenger event, where the fucking robot gets stuck on something and can't move
---
By that definition, beating someone in FIFA is griefing. And how am I supposed to answer your question when you give no context? Is it a PvP server?  Is using TNT to blow up someone's house a part of the core gameplay? Is it like Fallout 76 where there is literally no harm that comes to the player who's house was blown up?
---
I am built on a pond that spawns 3-5 Mirelurks (including legendaries and LVL 50 Glowing), I can also hit a few glowing / diseased / legendary Stingwing's from my porch. Also a Yao Guai about 30 seconds away.  
---
Not a resource, but I'm a hunter in Appalachia. Some men are Miner Men, I'm a Meat Man.
---
That's what I thought, thanks :)
---
I'm level 123 and have worn excavator since I got it without any mods and have no problems anywhere. I do whitesprings all the time and have played the entire game solo without fast travel so I have been in some hairy situations.
---
Power patcher and fix it good are a huge help so your excavator lasts longer and you can fix to 200%
---
Aside from that I just got the optimized servos and the +2 strength is great for melee.
---
Make sure you craft new power armor if you have leveled up, I rebuilt mine for level 45 as soon as I hit that level.
---
For my fellow Americans from a pharmacy guy- Paracetamol is the UK's common name for acetaminophen (Tylenol for us).
---
Have you seen them holding a minigun? They hold it like a knife pointing upwards.
---
I'd also add lower level players should use the "endangerol" syringer barrel mod and hit the queen and/or larger trash mobs with it.   Reduces target's damage resistance by 25% for 2 minutes, and rumor has it that it works on the queen.
---
I've seen a few posts saying it (endangerol) works but I have no idea if they have been fully confirmed or the poster just shot it and all of a sudden some bobble-headed out duper stepped in at the same time so it looked like it helped.
---
Whenever I'm down there I try and pop her with it every minute or so just in case it does help (not sure if the 2 minute duration gets reduced or something by boss mobs).  Super easy to make and use since the syringer debuff is determined by the barrel on the gun, not the ammo.
---
Yeah, lots the crash causes you to go over the reset time for codes. Of course if that happens, you're SOL anyway, because the codes will have reset for the week, and the ones online won't have been decoded yet anyway. 
---
I own a TSE weapon. It invalidates so much of the drive of the game. I love using it but it negates the need to directly hit enemies, can mow down hordes with minimal ammunition cost, is drastically better than any other ranged weapon combination, and honestly feels like it has no place in a multiplayer game; it's the end game kind of reward for a single player game. It replaces mini nukes, missile launchers, and grenades. 
---
Personally I think it would be better balanced setting enemies on fire rather than blowing everything up. Perfect Storm can do it, why is that the only legendary with incendiary as a property?
---
Wow thats fucked i literally send out random invites for inspirational and strange in numbers sucks that people are scared to team up cause of this
---
&gt;How does one make containers lootable by other players?
---
You can't make them, but you can drop stuff into pretty much any other container in the game and others can grab it. I drop all my excess crap in the Overseer's box at the Flatwoods church. Lots of people like to throw things in the cash registers next to the vendor bots and/or the suitcases littering the ground near train stations. 
---
Make sure to look around, you never know what you'll find :)
---
THANK YOU!!!
---
True, and a valid point.
---
50
---
Do you want dupers around? Sounds like you're defending them. 
---
I appreciate this comment so much. Been looking at this piece since i bought the game. Passed it up on sale because i spent my points elsewhere. Knowing it removes underarmor is an automatic no for me. Thanks.
---
I get what you're saying. Trust me. I think you should have to do the code the first time by yourself for the quest but any nuke after should be the way it is now. In end game the only really thing to do is launch nuke after nuke and doing even 5 in the same day isn't enough to get anywhere really. If we had to decipher a new code every single time, no one would bother doing it and we would all probably just stop playing 
---
Works fine at [1.0.4.13](https://1.0.4.13) version. Please report to [github issues](https://github.com/SomeOneUnknown/Fallout76Proxy/issues).
---
Thats the issue though. The enemies were locked out. IF they spawned on the correct side of the door. The game is broken when it comes to spawning enemies. "Your base can't get attacked from a distance by enemies, so you know, let's just spawn the enemies in the base." The game is a cheater.
---
Thanks for the advice, where’d you find the mods to them. I was told Watoga and Harpers Farey
---
Blame the dupers and exploiters, realistically
---
Nice, never saw a house off the side of a cliff like that! Where do you fast travel to?
---
The animals you come across that "suck", are just that, animals. Civilized human beings don't act in such despicable ways. Sometimes I wonder if it's time for a culling. That's something society would have to debate, though.
---
It really does. This is why i posted this. I do nuke zones all the time and it is very consistent at this site. Just taking out that scorched conqueror that keeps whacking me with a lead pipe is extremely helpful.
---
Na, I'll continue doing what I want
---
Ah crap, I'm only 40 :/ 
---
It did work with FF14 from what I've heard and it worked with Neverwinter to fix their economy. But those are different fanbases, I think I need to research server resets in the past that didnt work and see how they compare
---
When I hit 100 I started doing quests with my level 5 wife that I didn’t know existed lmao
---
Could be the stat.
---
Ah crap, I'm only 40 :/
---
I probably won't mind the bugs so much as I'm one of the few people that still plays dayz. ;)
---
I had the same mindset about it just being a big multiplayer fallout 4. I mean, there's nothing wrong about that imho.
---
If you play on PC, I would love to join your group.
---
Did you scrap anything in your camp build mode? That is the only time I've gone over 600lbs 
---
Are you certain that it only gave 28? I drank multiple colas multiple times and that never happened to me personally.
---
Or maybe it's kind of an prevention system because of the dupers.
---
I'll get some colas and try it out myself tomorrow.
---
What region/time zone?
---
yeh he just gave up one of the best tse's for 20x leather hmmm.
---
Definately he is a duper or has friends who are as no one would just give that away like that he has to have a stash of them or access via friends to them.
---
Pretty much :(
---
I've never found excavator mods at Watoga, only t-45 t-51 and t-60.
---
Camden park and Welch station are great and there's also a mod or plan at the top of the garisson estate.
---
Basically excavator comes from the ash heap so look at vendors there for mods.
---
Nah, I'll play this one and bitch about shitty mechanics until they get fixed.
---
GB :)
---
Thanks so much
---
Useful for loud stompy stomp sounds with 5.1 headphones.
---
Oh I know, bought it just in case someone was still looking
---
This better be a troll.... i can never tell because dupers come up with some silly reasons for it.
---
The community has explained this time and time again if true. Not that you would care your kind does not care for the community.
---
Yes I actually just did that yesterday- my whole camp so I could start over fresh 
---
&gt;yeah, but you would still need to time it right or maybe just play the RNG game and hope it rolls back far enough for the dupe to work
---
     
---
You trade the items. You then wait a few minutes. You can through prior knowledge or through note keeping find the time needed to wait to make sure you have your server state saved. Finding data through iteration can seem primitive, but it's an oldie but goodie.   
---
The only caves you can build in that I’m aware of seem to be in the crevices of the cranberry bog. might try your luck in the southeast.
---
I did. That is where the 2 star gutsy was.
---
You have to move your camp to see the budget increase.
---
i have one but wouldnt be cheap would actually cost you alot.
---
Shoot down cargobots and then pick the lock on the downed drone. Nuclear keycard is inside. Drone will self destruct shortly after so be aware.
---
Google nukacrypt. That's how. Though keel in mind codes reset less than an hour ago 
---
One run through Whitespring blast zone and pretty much everything you will find is better.  Stealth builds are great for solo play but it doesn't fit with the end-game dynamic this game has set forth.
---
Yeah I’ll make a video next time I’m on an post it. 
---
Yep they are. So the same person who has obtained TSE weapons probably also has this kind of armor. If you have neither... Well I hope the PvP remains optional.
---
What are you talking about 
---
Sadly no
---
I had a busy welding a rocket powered base ball charging laser until he zoned. Some times the models do funny things
---
The fusion core spawns at the generators are RNG based. They may not always spawn in. 
---
YES, I did not know that after all this time, the mods that say Plan: blahblah whatever mod are the reusable ones doh!
---
thanks for the reply :)
---
Platform?
---
If you haven't completed the story line.  Do so now please.  There is a computer in the bunker you tall to. It will tell you the location and mark it for you. 
---
I'd LOVE to have the Marine Combat Helmet, what platform are you on?
---
Nukacrypt website
---
Hasn’t been updated yet
---
No worries, for what it's worth Camden park is a good place if you are going to server hop as you can get XP killing the scorched that spawn there too.
---
Welch is good but no do or enemies so if you want easier try that. I personally prefer Camden Park though and have had better luck there including plans for the blood cleanser.
---
Remember that plans will require nuclear flora most of the time so mods are easier.
---
Sorry, I should clarify. I meant 'sprinting' since if they were then Id say glitch.
---
If running normally and jumping, thats hard to prove since afaik I think once you hit 700? 1000? Weight (Cant remember) you can only walk but still jump fine.
---
The explosive dragon is level 35 u want them 
---
I dont know if its universal but it seems like everytime I go to grafton it isnt long until those vertibots show up with there noise. I use a headset and they irritate me. Also I think its emmitt mountain disposal site they spawn there for me too.
---
Shoot down supply drop that have the escorts flying around it. I've never not gotten a key card from them. You'll have to pick the lock and run away after you shoot it down because it will self destruct just a heads up.
---
No I'm on Xbox, I probably should have added that to my post.
---
It was pretty bad this weekend. All the dupers trying to get their copies in before the patch tomorrow. 
---
Xbox
---
I'm not gonna name the person, but he was lvl 105 so he knew what he was doing, and was using a super sledge and in power armor 
---
Would you rather the legendaries be shooting you with explosive 2 shots? 
---
Yep and the last patch changed the drop rate.
---
Sounds great :)
---
I saw a bit of imbalance here and there in certain items and enemies but i guess the same was the case in fallout 4. Does it feel any worse than in previous games?
---
Otherwise, i don't mind most bugs. As long as it doesn't get my character stuck as a few people reported, I'll be fine.
---
I moved to a junk node just north of Harper's Ferry. Use the map to get close, and then look for a high voltage tower. There's a small pond under the tower, and the junk node is just down a small cliff to the east. 
---
If you place your camp module properly you can get the junk pile and a sizable chunk of the water within the green circle. 
---

---
As for mobs, I assume they're somewhat level dependent, but 90% of the time I just get level 40ish bloodbugs and radtoads, with the occasional level ~60 super mutant or scorched. Oh, and once I had a scorchbeast attack, but but that's only happened once and I've been in the same place for at least the last 150 hours of game play.
---
Jeez OP great find but you went all r/awardspeechedits
---
Because it rips all the fun out of the game, if your gonna play a game only to cheat, whats the point?
---
Wear your rad suit!
---
I'm 70ish and I mostly focus on the mobs. I don't have any TSE so I only attack the queen when the mobs are gone.
---
I caught a few dupers last night, it was awesome. If you’re still there in a few hours I can help out. 
---
Have fun and go get ‘em :)
---
Bethesda doesn't ban characters, it bans the entire account.
---
Ah yeah that makes sense.  
---
Just keep in mind it's not FO4. I personally really enjoy playing. I think the lack of NPCs is actually a good thing. You can go where you what when you want and do what you want. It's a lawless land and you need to make a place for yourself in it. I got my C.A.M.P. set up in a nice little midway spot in the woods. Grinding and building are really enjoyable. If that sounds like it's up your alley then yes get the game "when you can". Good luck with your work papers and good luck in general!
---
Learned no the hard way. Got one, logged out for the day. Logged in the next day and no longer owned it.
---
Same with pvp. I just wanted it for the perks and didn't care if someone stole it but two guys decided to team up and kill me for it. I was pansy running away too. Sigh. 
---
Goto the enclave bunker and request a tracking of a drone. The Robco computer terminals to this are located in the military wing.
---
I sell the keycards on Xbox 400 caps a piece.

---
The Gatling Laser doesn't get extra shots per magazine when you load an overcharged core, but you will get that extra 20% back.
---
Plasma Cores also gain Int-based extra condition when crafted, but the Gatling Plasma falls apart so fast that ammo is less of a concern than repair materials are.
---
They're trying to crash the server now, but if we don't lose them, it's on all fucking night lol
---
I still wish it was a Plasma Caster.
---
You have a good heart OP, I give you 5 more days out of the vault before you’re dead.  😃
---
Nobody stole from you, don't be stupid.
---
May i ask which things those were? I have heard there are not as many quests as you'd hope (other than dailies) but way more enemies and weapons than before (which I'd love to just collect)
---
It’s amazing how focused they are too. They never saw me, I have Chameleon Armor, and they didn’t notice me until it was too late. 
---
I think that might be the same item ID as the royal jelly dropped by the Honey Beasts which means it doesn't work in the recipe it's used in.  I might be wrong, but I'm pretty sure I didn't have one in my junk tab until I picked that one up.
---
Been doing this since my first nuke zone run like a week after launch. Normally it's all shit but its help people get some caps from the vendors atleast.
---
Sun Tzu: "All warfare is based on deception."  
---
Well played 
---
yes, lol  Duuuuuuuuuuuuupe!
---
What?  No first, padded/dense can be learned from plans and applied to armor like... any other armor mod.  Not rare at all.
---
Nothing yet, I suspect soon though.  Keep your eyes on nukacrypt solved for the codes as soon as they're figured out they will be listed there.
---
Is there a vendor there I haven’t been there yet
---
Workshop claiming has nothing to do with killing random, always-present enemies from spawns; there are a specific batch of enemies to kill.  What you're describing is just you not killing the right things. 
---
Yup. We've gotten some goodies from them. The main dude was mailing me crying lmao
---
Nice!
---
I applaud the vigilantism but some are very crafty and you may not be able to track them.
---
Oh no! I sort of feel bad, but then again not really. 
---
This is amazing. Thanks!
---
Same happens to me when I craft ammo real fast, but I have no proof 
---
Yes there is a responder vendor bot at Camden park,after you enter turn left and it will be right in front of you. Welch station is the typical train station vendor.
---
Lol sorry  i Couldn't help it, it's my first gold and silver's ever. 
---
Rofl, good story.
---
Big oof
---
The GECK is gone. It exploded and created the Mire. 
---
Yea I 100% don't
---
Oh, yeah, I noticed that! What's up with those? You're probably right! =\]
---
Are y'all on xb1 by chance?? Exact situation happened last night.. There were about 5 of us at or above lvl 100...and about 12 lvl 40s......it was a disaster. Nobody was actually shooting the queen except the 5 of us. Half the time, we spent killing mobs that were wrecking us when our backs were turned.. Nothing like getting thrown by a deathclaw while trying to get the queen to land......I think we got get to half maybe once and she regened.....smh
---
Try the events awol armaments and uranium fever for legendaries
---
I’ve been to Welch thanks though. Maybe I can now stop dying from a horde of mirelurk kings
---
Hot damn!
---
Makes sense, given his username
---
What platform?
---
Is vigilantism against the rules? I trade with almost everyone, well, try to trade with everyone I see! So if I happen to come across a suspicious inventory, and screen shot it, and send it to Bathesda, what's the problem? I was legitimately trying to trade and took a screen shot of suspicious activity. If you're not a duper, no harm done! 
---
Just knowing I fucked up some of their douchey pseudo gameplay warms my fucking heart.
---
correct. can confirm it is an automatic rifle.
---
Oh no, watch out. Their fellow dupers are downvoting us. My fake internet points! 
---
Good for you. 
---
Who needs loot when you can have the best guns in the game for 1500 caps  and sure you need that Flux for beacons but again you can buy a bunch from dupers and the vast number of them thats been duped may mean that we will have supplies of this stuff for years meaning Nukes are irrelevant unless you are a honor player who refuses to buy from dupers but I got tired of being at a disadvantage when everyone was better than me so I got up a few thousand caps found me a sleazy arms seller and bought two TSE weapons several thousand rounds of Ammo and a few hundred strike beacons       
---
You use a Chem's Bench, hover over smelting and it should pop up, you will need acid though
---
How about an anti griefer quick fast response team?
---
May RNGesus be ever in your favor.
---
Oh no! Dupers can eat my ass
---
Chemistry station. You'll need acid. 
---
This game needs *Bad Sport* points like GTA Online. 
---
Gonna play like a cunt? Have fun wearing a dunce cap and being stuck in a session with 23 other assholes like you
---
I think that was the same zone. She landed like once. Im on xb1. Kami Seb is my GT. There were 5 100+ there too. The rest were levels 40s. There was even a 38.
---
It has happened to me before I did a large sample size; Started off with 0 caps and had 400 nuka cherry; I spam drank them but only got 366. I found that in order to get the caps I had to press the button only so fast so that the server could keep up with how many I drank. Xbox One btw
---
Ah, didn't think of that. Thank you. 
---
Happened to me aswell a couple of times, only in 3rd Person. 
---
What fixed that was bring out my weapon and holster it again a few times. And ofc jump like a Idiot and press all the Buttons possible.
---
Usually by the time I remember to capture a video, my 2 min window of opportunity has passed :/
---
Once you use the Enclave terminals to request a location...
---
1) concentrated fire perk (lets you use vats to target engines.  
---
2) take out the engines first, shooting each one till they are smoking.  Once all 4 are smoking the small flying drone will stop flying about and you can open up on it.
---
3) perhaps move your base to use those base turrets to “benefit”.  This is an option for those with sub-optimal firepower.  
---
4) once the box drops, you have to pick the lock.
---
5) it self destructs, as mentioned before, so loot and leave.
---
Avoiding PVP is impossible, especially when someone can one shot you from a half mile away with a sniper. İt's bullshit.
---
My opinion:
---
They need separate PvP worlds. Kinda like they did with ESO, where the normal game was co-op and you had to enter into the PvP areas. Similar idea but in the PvP world you spawn in with nothing and have to build a camp and can only use the weapons you find in that world. No player trading and you can steal from someone's stash. If you kill another player they drop everything but the armor and weapon they have equipped. Legendaries dont spawn in known areas they should be truly random. Every week when the silo codes reset so do these PvP worlds. 
---
Actually fits with my observation just as playing and breaking stuff down and also makes logical sense it’d be designed that way.
---
Man worst experience I've had is that I got a 10 cap bounty at level 10 and had a level 100+ attack me, then message me and say "1v1 me for your stuff back".
---
A better suggestion if you don't have acid to do it would be to kill mole miners for the scrap. You can get a decent amount without using acid.
---
What is that? 
---
This is awesome!  Good find.  Hope it gets patched soon, but until then this gives me ideas.  Carry on, vault dweller!
---
lmao, idk why apparently there are several other dupes that work on pc... So once it updates all they have to do is switch to the pc style duping. It is actually more disruptive to servers and shuts them down.... Looking forward to that.... NOT
---
Are we talking about the marine tactical helmet (ski mask looking one) or the full helmet? I’m dying to get that full helmet—I’ve run glassed cavern like 80 times! 
---
Totally acceptable and appreciated! Until you have an explosive weapon or massive melee dmg and armor of  course
---
Blue suitcase is at Watoga station :) I leave loads of stuff in there. 
---
Good point, guy who's clearly never read patch notes for a game before!
---
All the t-51b mods and plans I've found were at the BOS vendor in Watoga. Got the jetpack plan there even.
---
Got every thing but the titanium. Thanks again for the help.  👍
---
Im not sure, but I don't think player vending is coming tomorrow. 
---
Ironically, not near Flatwoods in my experience.  I’ve seen him a little west of the tower to west of whitesprings down the mountain/hill near the town there (spacing name).  I’ve also seen him near the east train yard near Watoga in Cranberry Bog.  He gets around.
---
That's how I made my last 4 friends. 1 wandering around The Whitesprings and 3 defending a workshop; I call them The Geriatric Gang, they're all over 55.
---
I had considered the “end game” players before posting...I would never presume to tell people how to play a game, but as soon as I get to the “nuke, farm, repeat” point, I’ll be moving on to another game.
---
But that doesn't prove duping crashes the servers like at all. Duping is an issue but I don't believe it impacts the server itself enough to be an issue for server stability. There are 101 reasons that the servers could suck ass in this case it doesn't seem plausable to me and nothing I've seen remotely demonstrates that duping cuases crashing for anyone but the duper themselves. I place the sole blame on BGS servers themselves or even just the engine itself. I've never played an ES game or FO game (since BGS took it over) that didn't crash often until lots of patches and fixes later and even then major issues still arise to this day. Honestly this place reminds me way too much of the DarkNetMarkets sub before it was shut down with the amount of unfounded rumors lacking any evidence passed as defacto truth that flies around and is believed by the mob
---
48221623 for Bravo according to enclavedb
---
this epic.  You won the game!
---
I mean 74 hours of playtime sounds good, even if I won't end up replaying it. That's just a little less than I have on fallout 4, which has been fun.
---
My main game so far has been dota with 3600+ hours. But since they removed battle passes etc, I haven't really played it and need something else to waste my time on. Really hoping that work permit comes in soon, so I can buy things in general. :D
---
I wonder if Bethesda minds if I share an account with someone.
---
I better not mess with anything illegal tho, even a traffic ticket could get me deported right now, lol. (If i was even allowed to get a license here)
---
Lol, I find this hilarious 
---
Tried it again 2 times and the last try was successful. Tho i did nothing but hop servers. It was during the day and the event wasn't there.. so no idea what caused it.
---
Bye felecia!
---
He was definitely sprinting around.
---
I wonder what happens if I uses karma on the queen 
---
Thanks for the help, got everything but the titanium. 
---
I have the same problem as well! 
---
Most recent patch has... made all my scopes VERY close up.
---
Haven't been able to fix it despite setting .ini files to default, removing custom, and playing with DoF and FoV sliders.
---
Build your camp next to a lead deposit ... no reason why not to have different builds and play them at different times. Don't think it is the end of the world, just put some more points towards strength and melee type perks, you probably have a bunch already .. I have a mixed build and do just fine but do melee most of the time, not OP but strong enough .. unless you struggling with melee. 
---
The community has said it many many many many many many many times lol.
---
PvP servers and PVE server options.
---
PvP // Open warefare for those that wish it, bounty system as an incentive for those going on a rampage, workshops offer double resources gains and rate. Good place for griefers and raider players to run amuck.
---
PVE // for the rest of us , No PVP outside of workshops areas (mini pvp areas for claiming), no bounty system, no damage to players outside workshops and no damage to player made structures. Players in a camp area can fast travel regardless of enemies nearby as to avoid been stuck by player objects.
---
》 Weapon overhaul and balance.
---
Another place for steel is in the hills southeast of US-13C Bivouac. Not only is there a steel node which you can build an extractor upon that also has a beautiful view while being centralized to 6 vendor factions, but so far with little effort invested, I've run in to 24 iron veins along the hills. After a 5-10 minute loop to the crashed plane, down the hill to the cabin and back, I usually net about 250-300 iron ore, which can smelt into around 1k steel.
---
This increases the amount of acid farming you need vs. The scrapping method, but thankfully the Bivouac and nearby BOS firebases often have Hallucigen Gas containers which each scrap into 5 acid. Plus Whitespring is a short hop away for the acid farm that was stated.
---
I did them ASAP just to get all that shit off the screen.
---
Are you saying you give and/or receive creampies from 10 year olds?
---
There's a reason why the Shotgun build is Meta... and a 2handed Melee build is overpowered as hell.
---
Melee's not just overpowered, but incredibly resource friendly. Scorchbeast dies in 2-3 hits. No ammo required.
---
You just have to wait for the sucker to land though.
---
There was a guy trying to do this the other day, would run into the little cave the legendary spawned in and no one else could get at it...I threw a grenade then stood in the entrance the rest of the event and he couldn’t get out.
---
That's where all the weight came from. Those components being added back into your stash
---
But I like turning my sub up to hear the thump thump thump? Ah well, different courses for horses.
---
It's ok, those of us on consoles are hoping like hell that the relative openness of the PC is what's responsible for the instability and that our safe, closed worlds will escape it.  Fingers crossed!!!!
---
wow was that a fire hydrant stuck onto a lamp post?  I  W A N T  O N E !
---
Shoot their mobs first so they land?
---
Have you seen the trash most modders put out? 
---
Np, I’m a heavy weapons build so I know what’s going on
---
I'm setting up a bounty hunting service to deal with the griefers that could become more common, if you are interested in being under the services protection Pm me, personally I think the balance is fine TSE weapons have counters 
---
Sometimes. I want to say it worked that way in FO4 as well though it seems like it isn't supposed to in 76, at least not normally since it doesn't always happen. Still occasionally if I see the weapon on the ground next the body I can pick it up directly.
---
mind if i send you a friend request? also, would you want anything for it?
---
Good going \^\^
---
its RNG my man nothing to do with levelling.
---
So how come you haven’t answered about how this screws over the honest players? 
---
Why would it be fair to take everything away from those players that didn’t cheat, dupe or exploit? 
---
If you have any integrity, you’d answer. 
---
You're not going to get every single drop from the queen just from killing her once. All games have a grind. You're going to have to kill her dozens of times to get the more rare items. That's just how rng works. 
---
Yeah but it looks so cool with the excavator
---
Why the hate? I paid 80$ cdn for a game that didn't work close to properly untill the latest PC patch... That's why lol....
---
I am generally unfriendly to people who hold opinions despite there being contrary evidence, or no evidence to support those opinions at all. 
---
So it's not just you. Also people who believe in Angels, imaginary friends, shapeshifting lizard overlords, flat earthers, and Trump supporters. 
---
Then you don't understand where the ones for sale are coming from.
---
No I'll just make a vague post pointing out what needs to be done in this game and let you guys discuss amongst yourselves other never going to ever fix this game yet people are going to play it for years to come
---
Tank killer + perforating receiver + instigating gauss rifle.
---
Early this year. They also stated it would be released almost immediately after officially announcing it. 
---
Base damage increases with the Commando Perk, it's recommended you equip Commando, Commando Expert and Commando Master all at Perk Lv 1 for 30% increase in damage with only three slots at Perception, as well as the Bloody Mess Perk. These four perks increase your weapon damage by 45% (more if Commando gets upgraded).
---
Damage done to enemies can be increased by using the Tank Killer Perk (increased armor penetration &amp; chance to stagger) and Tenderizer (increased damage for the ememy).
---
An explosive 10mm Submachine Gun gets a damage boost with Demolition Expert, too.
---
Yeah they're worthless. Hmi and I'll take them off of your hands. No Charge.
---
This is the right answer. Or just shoot down any cargo bot you see.
---
Must be a bug because Ive seen what you describe plus:
---
Goes down in 20secs, doesnt even refill its health like a legendary beast should.
---
Goes down in 200mins. (Exaggeration) but point is you dont beat the timer - no lowbies in sight.
---
Goes down in 10mins, but jumps back up to full health. Sometimes once, sometimes twice, sometimes thrice.
---
Who the f knows.
---
They're (content creators) trying to get people to hate on Bethesda's reputation for releasing games with a "few" bugs here and there. I don't see why 22 million copies of Skyrim was not a disappointment when that game is also known for being buggy. Bethesda wants to make a great and memorable game but in order to make it great, they need feedback and some constructive criticism. Many don't want the game to succeed but the way I see it, Bethesda just had this baby and it's starting to crawl. Fallout 76 is like that food that has an acquired taste only a few can appreciate.
---
Whatever-top-dps-build-rogue at the time from vanilla to wotlk..... It's all about being up close and personal... Behind their back of course
---
I even played fallout 4 that way tbh. Always just messing around, shooting people here and there, get new gear etc. I especially love games where I can grind my ass off to get that one mostly useless thing but I can say I have it. I mean I have played WoW for years in the past.  
---
Will most definitely get the game as soon as I can (and make my wife get it too :P).
---
Thanks for the kind words man, appreciate it!
---
Ok thanks man
---
Official: I'm making my camp a brewpub if this ever happena
---
My main enjoyment in the game is checking out other people's homes, and Bethesda let us destroy other people's bases for a reason. 
---
That said, I've been known to kick (explode) the door, have a look around and then leave a blueprint for something they don't seem to have yet.
---
Yes!!! I wasted so much ammo....smh
---
Early this year. Their prior road map implied a more precise time of after the next big update in January.... So likely a few weeks from this recent patch.
---
They also said it would be released very shortly after they make more info available. 
---
Please let us know if it works, always good in case I run into it.
---
It's not like I wouldn't believe you, don't get me wrong, the game has hiccups all the time, just want to know if this is a thing for others, too... I hope not '^^
---
Yeah this is getting ridiculous. This game is going to hell with the community that's in it. 
---
Im not counting sorry, too busy picking up screws and springs.
---
My two shot explosive gatling does 700+ damage per shot with demo expert and bloody mess..
---
So get two shot explosive and rank up demo expert. Adds 100% to explosive damage
---
I went ranged so I can ranged not melee :(  
---
Theres a level 21 Deathclaw, that Spawns Top left of the map, in a place Called Deathclaw Island, hes easy to kill and drops 7-9 Titanium Pieces Per kill
---
Just saw the stream, thank you!
---
How much for that?
---
thanks for the tip
---
Unsure. I got one awhile ago from a powering up event and its awesome. Much cooler than that exhaust spouting gas generator nonsense.
---
Very true. 
---
lets not forget that melee users have a 75% armor pen perk and with the most recent patch TSE weapons will barely tickle anybody using a dense chest piece mod + fireproof level 3. in the 3 pvp encounters ive had since the update its literally just been me tanking their explosive weapons and killing them with two hits from an instigating death claw guantlet.
---
I haven't crashed since patch, I had 4 yesterday.
---
Yeah, i think its coming a littler later as well. But i wonder if it will work on a separate weight volume pool as the stash? Or will it be shared? 
---
You can't, i actually tested it.
---
I meant I dont know anything in general. I have been playing for 2 weeks but just  doing quests only :D
---
this so much. as it is people act like assholes now because there is no consequence for their actions. and before anyone says anything i dont care about one on one or being killed within the same level. its when someone at lvl 180 starts harassing people who clearly dont want to pvp or they are 80 evels above someone is when i have a problem. hell i wouldnt even complain about the level gap if being one shotted or ganged up on for no reason wasnt so commonplace. at least give me a chance to fight back.
---
Theres a new dupe going on where they reroll servers with three people. They huddle around each other force lag trading. Its Already on PC. Itll happen on Xbox and Psn causing server crashes. If a server crashes and you log back on missing items or anything you just crafted. Server reroll. 
---
You should include that some of these spawn in the world. The Pompadour Wig spawns in the white springs train station just as you walk in to left near the window over looking white springs. I'd just pop in there instead of doing the event first.
---
I love the explosive guns for scorchbeasts once they land, it can stagger them so their takeoff animation doesn't process. You can keep them on the ground while everyone flays on them.
---
There's a perk that makes magazines make noise when nearby, that's how I did it.
---
What does it say about you that you troll the sub of a game you apparently don’t play? Says you don’t have much to do with your time. 
---
i got tse shotty x 2 and tse black powder rifle and wouldnt sell for less than 5k each.
---
Get a refund
---
thanks for the tip. I havent really been to that vendor at all. I should do that 
---
1000 
---
Sometimes you just have to banish 8 year olds to their room......
---
you cant even do anything nice for people lower level than you anymore because people have been conditioned to think anyone higher level than them will grief them.
---
I’m down! I got a clean spacesuit!
---
Starting to get a little off topic, so I’ll just say this:
---
I don’t play games to collect all of the items. As soon as I get to a point where collecting rare items is all that is left, it’s time to move on.
---
fast travel to WHitesprings golf course and use the sulphur drinking fountain under the gazebo to cure your diseases rather than pull your hair out looking for or farming mats for disease cure crafting. If the server is lagging just keep drinking and it'll proc the disease cure
---
appreciated :D
---
From the game? I’m autistic so I notice patterns better than non autistic people but it should be obvious to you as it is to me if you pay attention. 
---
Is this normal happen to me too how do u fight it.
---
I spose, but my other ranged guns killed them in the sky and don't heal them :(
---
There’s a pond just north of Spruce Knob in that ridge line.  It’s SW of Twin Lakes. 
---
Kind of between that and Mountainside B&amp;B. 
---
I’ve passed that way twice and both times there was a Behemoth chilling in the water. 
---
I’m level 63ish. 
---
Not sure if fricken lasers float your boat but you can get the same if not cooler effect from laser rifles.
---
I have been doing some workshops in the early areas of the game. I'll check those out too thanks 
---
The main point of my shotgun is to get her attention and to cripple a limb using the Enforcer perk.  That brings her down so the melee's can finish her off, ignoring 75% of the armor with the Incisor perk.
---
I have a non legendary Gatling gun and I’m not having any problems I don’t even use the damage buff perks most of the time I just run stabilized and one gun army. 
---
There is possibly to make this on plasma rifle. If you want I can craft gama wave emitor. So if you have same legendary plasma rifle just bring to me.
---
Yeah I always have it on nowadays and best place seems to be Top of The World. But if I could limit the time trough trading it would be so much faster.
---
I'm not the editor of this list or I would lol
---
Bit late i bought the game months ago lol. 90% of the guns I wanted to use are all buggy.
---
My GF had a bright idea.
---
"I'll just wait inside the golf resort for the bomb to drop so I can kill the ghouls before someone else can."
---
She was fried faster than a chicken at KFC, but I didn't notice that you turn into a green goo pile, I always thought that that were ghouls killed by a plasma gun.
---
Haha more than one. People were going after people for just being with a low level friend. Dorks. 
---
I think as a Lone Wanderer with 1 endurance that adds barely do damage to me, but adding SBQ makes me at least smack them when they pile up.
---
Is lone wanderer really that OP with PA?  Cause I honestly don't get how people are dying to SBQ.  Don't hate, just relate.  I've only seen one person die at SBQ and it was at the end of the fight.  (SBQ body fell on him and he had to panic emote, which was humorous.). Is SBQ tearing up groups without that 30% DR?
---
This dear God is most important. I've scrapped not one but two x01 calibrated shocks.
---
I'm ready to lose my mind.
---
  
---
Wow... just wow
---
Holy shit, thank you. I am a moron lol
---
I used a prototype hazmat suit
---
Using this logic by having area chat they intended you to constantly play incomprehensibly loud music to annoy others the entire time you play. 
---
Lol been playing for over 200 hours and haven’t found one 
---
So it must have counted as an alien ?
---
Whats wrong with bobleheads?
---
One of the reasons I pretty much STAY OVERENCUMBERED.   I keep extra power armor frames and pieces mich lower. I keep pistols and melee and even sometimes a low level legendary weapon. 
---
I certainly need better stash management skills 
---
Gg thanks
---
Uranium node and water
---
saving everything we've made for a Workshop would go a long way in getting people to invest in workshops.
---
Honestly, sometimes it does feel like there are more bugs in this game than the previous ones... but I still have faith that Bethesda will fix as many as they can in time. :) 
---
Sounds like rpg's are not the type of games you should be playing then. Sounds like you're more interested in puzzle games honestly. Good luck to you. 
---
Sorry that's a bit much for me for that, cheers anyway tho
---
Anyone on Xbox want to team up but still just play solo?
---
No transfer unfortunately. I play on all 3 systems.  Not even your friends list transfers over.
---
This is not how you get them to land xD
---
I literally used 1400 rounds of 5.56 with my single shot explosive handmade last time since I kept shooting the queen and enemies that kept spawning around the group. 😐
---
I've never had a TSE and just this week found my first explosive which is an explosive light machine gun that is okay.
---
I have plenty of weapons that work great, from shotguns to handmade to .50 Cal etc. 
---
Explosive weapons are entirely unnecessary and overly hyped. They also tend to make the game boring.
---
If I find one, I'll probably just drop it in a random container.
---
I didnt know a behemoth was a thing. So yea. Haha
---
There’s nothing to kill in the area. I can’t claim
---
In my experience, Scorched always have ammo. It's how I farm shotgun shells.
---
That's why I'm counting.
---
I miss bumper swords. They woulda been cool as hell in power armor in 76!
---
How about 750 caps and some 308 rounds ?
---
Ayyyy this is how you get her to land.
---
I would love to join. My specialty is stealth sniping and I love going after griefers with a juicy bounty on them. Especially when they are attacking those who are just trying to get by. I can also help with a lot of weapon/armor/chem/food crafting as I have been trying hard to collect every recipe and plan I can get ahold of.  I hope you can find a place for me in The Responders.
---
The only locked part of my base is the secret room in the basement.
---
Yeah I’m setting the game down until they fix that and some new content. If I had to farm the gold course one more time I was gonna go insane. Playing red dead 2 now. Man that game is amazing lol
---
scorchbeast queen
---
Yah just seemed coincidental.  
---
I do a combo with my heavy build. It does melee and heavy(no boom boom) 
---
Smart, uses more budget but definitely useful
---
I see that the explosive weapons are OP
---
Don't Long Shot and Tormentor apply by that logic?
---
This is actually the main serious, swear-inducing thing about the game. Among it's many problems, having like a 50% chance of losing progress on any given quest is what really burns me.
---
My camps I post are downvoted into oblivion.
---
I know the normal generators are so ugly
---
I’m pretty sure you get it on that line. You definitely get it before you actually launch a nuke so if you aren’t on that yet, keep goig
---
My only problem with the Gatling gun is the lack of blueprints for the gun. 
---
They reset at 7pm EST every Monday. 
---
I was talking about solo'ing regular SBs. I do 0 dmg to them if they fly, it heals to full. 
---
Shotguns seem buggy and I'm purely built for them with 4 of them in my inventory and 15000 shells. Oh well.
---
One more level and 12 terminals hacked and I’ll have platinumed the game
---
I'm in the savage divide, slightly east of pleasant valley station on a tiny lake of some kind. Brahmin spawn there for some weird reason.
---
I feel ya, entering my mid 30s and its just not worth getting so heated over a game. Don't feel like getting a heart attack one day over a destiny pvp match lol
---
Well it's 8:20pm and they're still showing "in progress". And I logged in after 7pm. Is there something I'm missing or don't understand about the process perhaps???
---
I can kill things just takes hundreds or rounds. I really enjoy the nuke zones. I was in one for an hour yesterday with a I went threw at least 1500 rounds and he can basically 2 shot anything with his melee weapon. 
---
They stack infinitely for 1000000% dmg+
---
I got a Explosive Gatling Plasma (sadly not a two-shot) if you want that
---
Not rare at all. People just don't know to get it from these. I actually got mine from the Monaghan plant.
---
Every griefers I've met is just bored because there is nothing else to do after awhile 
---
EXACTLY the right idea and exactly what me and my 2 lower level friends did - we figured this out the first time we were there, that the best contribution we could make was killing the miscellaneous scorched nuisances. 
---
Vigilantism in this case is not against the rules. You are correct and I would be a liar if I said that my friends and I don't partake in our own Wasteland Justice ™️. 
---
The issue is that attempting to 'catch dupers' with no authority whatsoever is, 9 times out of 10, not going to be well received by your fellow players. 
---
This is not the Spanish Inquisition and I know that if I see or hear about  people doing this with myself or my team, we will simply open fire. Assuming that all are guilty until proven innocent is a poor way to operate and that is why you are not the person in charge of solving the issues you are attempting to remedy.
---
I'm not sure what it is you're looking for. You just need to find the codes. Or google them. The enclave site already has the beta code 
---
I use an explosive Gatling so I have squally hit them once and let the other guy clean up
---
Common, the powering up events are how to obtain the fusion generator, large generator and windmill. 
---
I got each generator plan (except the first one) in order, so i simply assumed that they were given to you based on what you already had learned.
---
I guess I can start working towards melee. I think it’s nuts that the guns need ammo and repaired and seem to do less damage. Seems like a punishment for using them 
---
Seriously
---
I disagree, killing with a TSE and surviving yourself is one of the most challenging aspects of the game. 
---
That said, I had to buy mine here because at level 110+ I still get almost exclusively, wood armor and pool sticks and canes.
---
On the plus side, the "Line in the Sand" event works now and drops two full cores each time.
---
That idea did cross my mind too but I didn't think it'd work. And its not goo but green ash at least in my case.
---
Well damn, thanks!
---
that works great only if you're camp is super simple.
---
Sry bro ;)
---
Breaks the game as intended... That's why 
---
Attempting to *Help* Remedy. Screen shots are harmless. 
---
I've *heard* that fast-travelling will also force-save in the same way that logging out will. However the auto-save is actually good enough most of the time it's hard to tell if there's any difference.
---
I was over exaggerating a bit. I only crash once maybe twice per nuke zone which is the same as everyone else. If I really did crash 12 times in a nuke zone I'd deff be troubleshooting, ha.
---
For distant thunder, do you tag the scorched or kill them?
---
I've had wanted level players approach me and ask for "protection money" so their "squad" wouldnt kill me, needless to say I said no and left the server, weirdos roam the map of Appalachia abusing low level players. I should take screenshots of usernames next time and it would be nice if someone started a subreddit to expose these people and their usernames for the joy of justice and all that is good in the world. 😁👍👍
---
It’s somewhat rare to get the blueprint.
---
I run a power armor/shotgun focused build. Very satisfying.
---
Well back before it was patched if you could get to level 22 and take the first two home defense perks you could disarm the same grenade bouquet or flame trap endlessly for XP and mats.
---
Just bad rng my friend. Keep on keeping on 
---
I know you already mention Morgantown HS but since you specifically mentioned the cafeteria, I'll mention that the gym also has a ton of plastic. Possibly more than the cafeteria.
---
Definitely so and it's wonderful. After +200 hours if I had to grind for every kill I'd never play again. It's immensely fun blowing up anything and everything
---
I'm not familiar with the process as I've never done it before. I know you need 8 silo codes (or none if the code has been cracked for the week), but the way nukacrypt describes the process, you have to run those codes through a cipher using a keyword (which I assumed was obtained from the bunker). I clicked on the printers under the silo's for the printout and it says the launch codes for that silo have not been calculated yet.
---
Did you know that fast traveling to locations on the edge of but outside the nuke zone can put you in the nuke zone?
---
And that's how *I* earned my ground zero badge
---
I just world-hopped a bunch to collect them. It seems random if they spawn or not. Heart Of The Swamp doesn't affect them either... whoever thought so must have just had a strange coincidence. They might be on some sort of a timed lock or something because after I got 9 of them they stopped spawning no matter how many times I world-hopped. I'll try again tonight.
---
More likely they are bored, or playing as a raider
---
Is it cold up on your ivory tower?
---
Screenshot away, but are you aware that they have programs written to find the accounts that are ruining the server connection automatically? Everyone is already being tracked.
---
I usually start out by leaving my camp with gunsmith and armoror still equipped, and all my weight reduction cards unequipped, and end up over encumbered and full of rads in the middle of a fight.
---
But I can build a level 3 gun on the middle of a ghoul mob if I wanted to! 
---
it seems to be working now. Are you on?
---
You wish
---
hear that that fatman whislte? alt-f4. 
---
I did as well. Shotgun shells and 5.56 out of this world. I ended up getting on the roof because people kept hopping in front of me so i would kill myself and then i just kept getting enemies aggroing the shit out of me. Then a guy seriously sent me a message telling me to get off of the roof because I was causing the SBQ not to land. 
---
It took me about 6 runs to get the plan. 4 of them gave me large generator plans.
---
Do you enjoy **ripping people's motherfucking stomachs open and eating their motherfucking flesh holy shit**, or is it just me?
---
Jesus Christ that’s desperation. I got to like level 40 something before the beta ended. And the majority of that was from killing creatures before the ever thought about reducing xp rewards. How much xp does disarming something get you? Like seven? Seems like that would take forever to level up. I tried to play tonight for the first time in three weeks and the goddamn faces of everyone including my character are pixelated and flashing text and letters or turning flat black. It’s intolerable. 
---
You're right the pvp is wack and very unbalanced, it's even worse that some players take this as a green light to bully. Hopefully Bethesda can adjust the pvp system so it cant be abused by the malicious intentions of bullies, unless Bethesda decides this is how they wanted their pvp.
---
I notice you didn't deny the accusation.
---
make sure you use the armour reduction perk in intelligence (stabilized : wear power armour) that helps alot, get the damage perks for heavy guns bloody mess i have a two shot gattling it kills most enemies very fast. The gattling gun is by far the most ammo conservative heavy gun most others chew through ammo. Early on its usually better to use melee until you have caps/mats to build ammo get super duper and ammosmith.
---
I get everything you're saying but I still feel like you're at the dupers defense. 
---
I'm a back packer, hiker, fisherman and bow hunter. I practice what I preach :)
---
This game makes me want to put my head in a microwave.
---
By HALF. 
---
Definitely a must for things like a decon shower/fusion generator. 
---
  I really enjoy this game, but it is way too grindy to get good gear.  Hopefully, they work on the balance a lot.
---
You have to be in the center of the nuke
---
I may have seen the same one, it was wearing a fedora
---
I run a hybrid heavy gunner/rifle build. 12 st, 9 per, 9 agi, enough for all the required perks, although I've recently been tempted to move some from int over to get 12 per. With 6 luck you can have a full heavy gunner build that demolishes (bloody mess + the one that stuns/cripples), or 8 for starched genes if you want a mutation build. 
---
Your best bet would be not putting your head in a microwave, and farming nuked white springs or queens :)
---
Nothing. Wait.
---
Because you annoyed me. Why would I need to provide you with confirmation of something that as far as I’m concerned is bloody obvious. Now admittedly being autistic helps me understand patterns much better, instead of just nodding and thanking me for the information, you question me.
---
 You should always mention what system you are on.  I am on PC and at level 58 I have never crashed and only been disconnected maybe a dozen times, that includes Beta.  I have no doubt things are different on other systems.
---
I do not associate with the gormons

By the way I'm new to Reddit. Can I switch it to where my comments aren't automatically liked by myself?
---
These kids will grow up and buy a big truck to compensate for their tiny... you know the rest. XD
---
I think it will a vendor like the ammo or medical ones, with a small inventory that you manually input from your inventory. I do not like the idea of it being at your camp, or marking your camp to others, as that defeats my purpose of moving out to the mountains away from people. I don't want griefers or trolls, and especially those who kill my tamed animals. 
---
Same here! It feels like they are working on it pretty quickly though. I was worried they'd remove most developers from the project as soon as it launches but that doesn't seem to be the case so far.
---
I kept the magazines until I had enough, got the achievement and dropped them off at the Flatwoods cash register. 
---
Damn shame what they did to magazines and bobble heads. 
---
I'm on PC. 
---
 Good lord at least offer to trade or buy it.
---
They feel it justifies their bullying.  If I see people traveling in packs on a server I immediately block them.  I don’t care if their intentions are good or not.
---
See, that's messed up to me. That's just guilty until proven innocent, and not the way the dupers should even be handled. 
---
I'm sorry to hear you got mixed up in that. Trade - find evidence if any - screen cap - report.
---
bravo is solved right now. if you are trying to do this correctly you need to get all the code pieces from the scorched officers. You then need to wait for the letters to reveal in the enclave bunker, from there  you can decode using keyword cypher.  chek out this post on the actual process.

According to another thread it does, yes. Never tried a 10mm SMG build myself yet.

Where did you get that Marine helmet of yours? The only place you can get it is from the Dev room so people know it's not legit; it's not even added in the game yet from what everyone on reddit says.
---
RIP. it’s a fun game. If they fixed the PvP balance and added end game content it would be fun. The early and mid game is good imo. 
---
Ok, thanks, I’ll add that 
---
google it bro. ultrawide fix bans, reshade bans, lots of stuff. the current ultrawide "patch" doesnt fix aspect ratios or anything and is pure trash so people got in and made it work properly, and got banned. Same with reshaders, people who didnt want the screen to crush the black so hard and make everything unnecessarily dark with imbalanced contrast.... bannned. Theres more cases but heres just a few...
---
Hard to give you a build without specifics. Like what weapon you prefer to use or if you want power armor or hate using VATS. Here is a general layout build that is very Jack of all trades. You won't be the most powerful but the game still won't be hard. Just fill it out with whatever weapon you like to use: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=7143535&amp;d=sb2sv3e82l90l00e60s72c71i44p10lt2&amp;w=c52cr0c62ic4&amp;n=Generic%20Character

This is a fine line brother, approach this with caution please. 
---
Ad Victoriam
---
If you block off all the exits to the munitions factory he can get stuck in there, so I think your plan has merit.
---
We ended up doing that to the last one, my uncle and I play as a team so we just blocked entrance 
---
I notice you didn't deny the accusation. 
---
1 piece of Dense armor does most of the work, helps against Scorchbeasts too. 
---
Is the mechanic jumpsuit really that rare? I just bought it off of a vendor 
---
  How does one know people are duping?
---
Just wait until the patch when the servers are still screwed and you have to something else to blame it on...
---
paintjobs dont effect other players 
---
Does it happen when you walk into Harpers or only when you fast travel?
---
It's a nuclear missile exploding right in your face, of course it wouldn't work but I didn't want to miss out on that reaction, it was priceless xD
---
Also thank you, I would've never known that if someone didn't tell me the green ash thing. 200ish hours and I still don't know everything yet ^^
---
We have very different experiences ... three out of the last 4 times I was there, the queen was dead within 2 minutes because a large percentage of players are using duped TSE weapons they bought on eBay.  I have played a total of 250 levels between two characters and I've never seen a weapon drop with the explosive effect out of at least 2000 legendary weapons.
---
Terrible behavior 
---
Yeah, has some level 153 guy shoot + kill myself and my friend when we were level 15 and 10. Like you got all my junk and 10 caps, congrats????
---
So just generally toxic and unfriendly to those around you who have opposite opinions. You must be great at parties.
---
Yea I'm pretty sure trying to transfer 17k of each thing your carrying is completely unaccountable. I got a fully patched, big proof game to sell you, friend.
---
Watoga bot and Harpers Ferry have them. 
---
I can give you 1-4 if your on pc
---
Look up how many of those are real, the only bans have been for cheaters and people exploting
---
Feel free to accuse me, down vote my replies, etc. My xb1 gamertag is Sagitarii. You can check me all you want  but all you'll find is a cold hard fact. You are promoting a tattletale strategy and wasting your time. Good day, sir.
---
Thats how I hunt ;). Sniped some poor guy in his camp down in the dry lake bed at Summersville - I was up on the cliff near the mansions
---
I don't believe it's that rare, it's not a perfect chart, not sure who made it even lol... But it's the best one I know of
---
Who are you going to blame after the patch?
---
Hmmm are you on PC?  Try updating graphics card driver if so.  I got some bad artifacting when I ran Power Up Poseidon after the patch but other than that I haven't seen too many graphic glitches.  It gave you a low amount of XP but people were setting up keyboard macro programs to go afk and keep disarming.  
---
The gym is way better, if the stack of plates are there lmao, nice thing to is low level scorch with majority using shotguns dropping some decent amounts of shells, a few server hops and decent amount plastic and a few hundred shotgun shells
---
The game is actually fi Server Not Responding Controls have been temporarily disabled
---
I missed only Tumblers Today and bought one issue from other player. Unfortunately it didn't count toward the challenge.
---
Oh I got confused cause I saw this supposed rare outfit. Should I keep it or try and sell it?
---
Thank you, that was extremely helpful. So the enclave bunker only gives 1 keyword at a time. My issue is that it's currently giving no keywords at the moment. Is it still possible to solve the code if you no keywords??? Well, I'm guessing it is since bravo has already been solved. But I'm just trying to figure out when the bunker starts giving out keywords.
---
When they can't even waddle run because they have mass amounts of everything they have on them. Another thing to look out for is huge level players in an hour plus circle jerk with one or two low levels while dropping on and off, like the dumb pigeons in our case.
---
The mini gun is meh. Best heavy is gatling. And you can kill super mutants for tons for 5mm
---
33% chance of getting it.
---
It's almost a case of the only way they can prevent duping atm, is to delete files containing TSE weapons (plus bobble heads and nuka colas).
---
It's so unbelievably broken at this point I'd almost rather they just took the game down for a whole week to do some serious work. 
---
I was nearby when it was launched at Prime the other day (was actually at R&amp;G station and saw the rocket go ***up***, that was cool) and joined in on the fight for the first time.
---
I was level 91, with a single shot explosive handmade, plasma gatling, a handful of plasma grenades, and an auto grenade rifle albeit with only 16 grenades. I was surprised I wasn't even touching the SBQ, based on the damage that I do to "normal" SBs with these weapons. The handmade is Nocturnal so maybe the daytime attack was nerfing it. Anyway, the plasma gatling broke (of course) and I kept taking out scorched ground attackers with the handmade, but in the allotted time, the group (which was at least 10 people) only took the queen down to about 55-60% HP. (Fun fact: I didn't realize as time wound down that people bailed out back to Watoga while I was still fighting everything I could see, and I was all alone when the timer ran out!)
---
Kind of makes me wonder even more how people are defeating the queen in *seconds*, like I said the other day in another comment. Literally seeing "The scorchbeast queen's reign of terror has ended!" *at the same time* that I am seeing the 'success: death from above' notification (the one you get after the bomb drops and you survive).
---
Yes!
---
How much damage does an explosive Dragon do? That's crazy!
---
I use a tse. 50 cal and do 470 per shot with my current build! So far I've done shotgunner, rifle build, and heavy. So far heavy is my favorite
---
It's only happened to me a couple of times.  I just got them chasing me, ran by a car, then turned around and blew it up.  Didn't kill them, bit it was fun XD
---
I would look up on Google where you can find it, if there's a lot of places it's probably not worth much. But if you can't find any info it's probably rarer (but I don't believe it is...)
---
I wish that journalists had to go to school for their profession.
---
Not sure what’s going on at 1:08 XD
---
Well done nonetheless, got a lol out of me
---
Nothing will be done. Dupers dupe because they know they won't be banned.
---
I've made a medic build, and heal/support my gf and other people we've met. This is exactly what I  do as I'm not specialized with any weapon, and just use whatever I have the most ammo for. I'm tanky and supportive so I usually take this upon myself to do and let others who can do damage kill the queen.
---
Omlette du fromage
---
I looked it up for ya, not rare
---
You should let people rent the houses, run shops, and you can be the mayor. Like a little sim city in Fallout 
---
I don't think there is a Patch on PC tomorrow, just consoles. and consoles are getting the patch PC's got on the 10th.
---
That and the next patch that is coming has already been stated to be bug fixes and balancing.
---
How you got the impression player vendors are coming tomorrow I do not know.
---
I love how you guys keep blaming youtubers for Bethesda missteps, like having dev tools active in the game
---
In my queen runs I've seen a ton of dead weight 100+ players as well. Doesn't matter what your level is if you aren't doing shit.
---
Queen kill is either trivially easy because everyone just rolls in with explosive weapons and she gets vapourized. Or it's impossible because the few explosive weapons there break before she does.
---
Like so many things in this game, it's just bad design overall.
---
That sucks.  Let her know that not everyone is like that.  That frustrates me to no end.  
---
But I figure I’d mentally put it in a world context.  It is the post apocalyptic future.  Your stuff will get destroyed, whether it be other players or super-mutants.  
---
Thank you, saves me the trouble of trying it out and setting up the trade.
---
Hey, if don't want that LMG I could take it :D
---
They never come across as really dastardly, simply because their actions in the game are so short sighted and imbecilic. Could tell Paliarugo was involved in the writing as it had the same level of underpants gnome logic as The Institute, where you’re told what the end goal is but the actions they use to reach it make utterly no sense and endanger their own interests. 
---
Shotgunner Lazy Tank build. 
---
13 STR, 3 PER, 4 END, 4 CHA, 10 INT, 12 AGI, 10 LCK. 
---
Fireproof, Dodgy, Born Survivor (+300 Super Stims), Lone Wanderer, Blocker, 1pt Ghoulish. The rest into DMG (Shotgun, Explosive, Curator, Bloody Mess) for the most part. Vanguard/Sentinel armor. I can't die. Not even if AFK. But still 1 shot everything.
---
 Although I might have to rebuild to Heavy, as Shotguns are too buggy for me (they heal ScorchBeasts that fly).
---
Now we're the duping police? No thanks. 
---
We need a "kill me now" emote
---
Thank you. If you know of any rare-ish or just nice looking coats that would go good with a sentry bot helmet I would love the advice
---
They don’t have infinite ammo, I have seen them run out of ammo and attack me with a weapon that they have picked up off of a dead friend
---
&gt; At the end of the fight it will try to sent out the Chinese troops it was carrying but since they died long ago from lack of food and water you can loot their gear
---
I think they should have turned into enraged Soviet ghouls adding another phase to the fight.  The fight very occasionally spawns a rare colonel mob who drops plans for a pet Liberator.
---
You can find a behemoth around solomons pond and mega sloth is at the area where the bear icon is hope it helps.
---
I down your vote your reply because you don't make it neutral. If you down vote my reply, it will show negative. Again, you seem to not understand, I'm not witch hunting. If you and I "traded" in game, I would make a educated guess then and there, and then decide what to do about it. And no, I'm promoting a violence free way of updating Bathesda of fishy inventories. 
---
You don't have to I KoToR.  You can switch full dark last second in a talk with Bastilla just before the final fight.
---
Its level 35 but with no rifleman perks it does 600
---
That I was not aware of!
---
When I'm not wearing an outfit and just running around with my Heavy BOS set showing, I like to wear the assaultron mask with that and sometimes the sentry bot helm. Might look good with Marine too
---
Can you make me a hot pocket while you're in there?
---
Ha, I saw you up there. Seriously??? Smh noobs
---
Nope. Just have to build it off of one foundation. You can make it huge. 
---
What kind? 
---
I totally agree, but I just don't really know if my character is doing enough dps to focus on sbq since it's really hard to tell how much damage you're doing to her. In my melee spec I'm easily one-shotting lvl68 scorched with roughly 280 dmg on the hammer, and for my heavy build I only have a plain Zealot's  .50 Cal with heavy barrels and +30% damage from heavy gunner perks. 
---
As the first explosive weapon I have found, it is quite dear to my heart. I'm actually working in building up the explosive perks so I can really use it, right now it effectively does less damage than my handmade automatic.
---
For now it is very amusing to use when there are too many players mobbing the ghouls at Whitesprings and I want to get hits in on pacifist.
---
Nah your character was just drunk and high and was seeing things.
---
No! But I've seen a Yao-guai rolling on its back having a dust bath being all cute.  5 springs for me =D
---
I'm on ps4 and also a trophy where. Fuck Bethesda for creating a trophy that requires you to grief 20 players. I mean the achievement is even called "Good Grief". Like wtf kind of jackass dev tries to incentivize lvl griefing in their game? 
---
Average DPS per player in the zone matters dramatically more than having extra bodies. If a significant number of the people there are doing chump damage (because of build, level, being shit, whatever), the kill gets disproportionately hard not because you're in any danger, but because you can't deal enough DPS to knock off 150% of her HP before the timer runs out. It's basic math. It's a timed event, the total group DPS needs to be high enough to empty her 150% of her pool in that time.
---

My #Fallout76 character build https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f186f56&amp;d=s12ih2id2a80a00l22lt2ic4ir0cf1ev0sb2e11e71e41ek1c22sq2s32sr2s22p10s72&amp;w=&amp;n=

Should I wear all upgraded marine armor with no legendaries or buy a legendary set off of someone? Because I can’t find any good marine legendaries it seems and my miss-match armor has decent legendary stats  
---
Dunno about them but ham and cheese for me
---
I do feel like 3 star legendary mobs should at least drop a 3 star item. sick of getting 1 star legendary off 3 star mobs.
---
Lol fuck juicehead
---
How much cod you offer for it?
---
Do you recall the gamertags and character names of those guys, so I know to stay away from them if I ever see them in a server? 
---
I'm on Xbox as well, so
---
ham and cheese pls
---
What?! Actually?
---
Hello
---
there
---
Yep, dr for example works in a very convoluted way
---
I logged in this morning just before they shut down the (PC) servers and saw that somebody had nuked *WV Lumber*. I wanted to go see what that was like.
---
Looks great!
---
Mind if I ask how you got walls to go straight into the ground without there being a foundation floor?
---
"Best" is typically subjective, but I'm a fan of stabilized long barrel/forceful stock/perforating receiver/short recon scope/suppressor--in order: +range/recoil, increased condition bar, +armor pen, appreciation for recon but finding the long scope excessive, and for the Sandman bonus/maintaining stealth. Did recently put a prime receiver on my two-shot gauss once I got a feel for how accessible the ultracite ammo was, and it is deeply satisfying being able to completely wreck a level 80 scorchbeast before it makes it out of its fissure.
---
Hi
---
I’ll try to post mine when I get home lol I have 2 pics with them like that lmao 
---
They reduced the rate at which they appear in fusion generators (PC only, consoles later this week) plus people know where the generators are and snag up the cores. 
---
It just works
---
The hate is called bandwagon. Hive mind. Group think. 
---
It’s a powerful thing, and destroys all that is good. 
---
Yeah... My buddy rage deleted the game last night due to actual Grief dicks stacking bobble heads with magazines. Trying to do a quest a lvl 167 shows up shoots us both in pacifist mode and one shots us.  No smack since he's using Beth's broken bobble head stack and magazine stack.  Took all the farmed junk.  Super fun
---
I got the wetsuit not even an hour ago.  Second floor, in the square case right after you fall in before the sniper lookout.   Got the tactical helmet there last night.
---
good old spanking )))
---
Same here. Bought the plan for it but can't find it 
---
It is simple math, say she has 10 health. I do 2 damage you do 2 damage and your friend does 2 damage. That's 6 damage if 4 weaker players do 1 damage a piece we kill her. Work on your math.
---
Ok sure
---
Np
---
&gt; The reviews came out before/on release, actually.
---
Wrong.
---
&gt; Written by people who have played as many hours as I sank in over the weekend.
---
It amazes me that you were able to determine this fact from reading/watching reviews but WEREN'T able to determine why those reviews had negative opinions about the game. Either you ignored the numerous complaints people made in the reviews...or you're just full of shit and wanted to make a pro-Fallout 76 post to get upvotes on a subreddit that, right now, consists mainly of pro-Fallout 76 players.
---
never seen x01 plan.
---
Is that near the vendor or whereabouts?
---
They are frozen scorches
---
Lol that in no way equates to the same logic.
---
Not too surprising when you consider the "real" flatwood monster was believed by the people who supposedly saw it, to be a green alien, with glowing eyes in a hoversuit.
---
Go to r/fo76filthycasuals it much more appreciative of camps.
---
Great point. I feel like a big nerf is coming this month for explosive weapons... I'm nearly level 130 and haven't found a TSE yet, but the majority of people on my server seem to have them now so I directly avoid and PVP confrontations :(
---
Is the tse 50 cal your favorite heavy gun?
---
Ahhh 😂 whoops! I once logged out inside whitesprings and when I came back later that day I logged into a server that had recently been nuked. So in front of like five people I made it a few steps towards the door before I died ☠️ 
---
Honestly, with duping gone, stacking bobbleheads will not be a problem. Once the duped supply dries up, the average player will only have a few to use at once.
---
chance to get nuclear material
---
The problem is this, I’m not the sort of person to write stuff down and nor are any of my cohorts. Heck the only reason I made this post is because no one else seems to have bothered and I want that sweet karma. 
---
You dont the queen/scorched beasts too land. You want them 2 hover then explsosive dmg will work. I can prove it in game 
---
I use the useful ones as soon as I get them, so I don't forget. Then sell the rest. 
---
I have found a total of 3 caps and 6 cigarettes by searching literally hundreds of them. Evidently, they are pointless and are probably only there to make the world seem less empty.
---
I mean, I've played dozens of hours of a game even if I didn't consider it a great game. Either because I was hoping to get something out of it (Destiny...) or just needed a time waster. And Fallout 76 is a great time waster, but I wouldn't call it a great game. 
---
Yeah, it's got a good rate of fire and looks bad ass
---
That was cringe af lol
---
Nah.  When you fast travel to harriers ferry just run straight.  There’s a big whole in the wall that takes you in a building, 2 stories of display cases.  I found both plans on the second floor.  You get to the second floor by going through the boxcar out the front door.
---
That's from dupers though. 
---
I would 100% look for Heavy Legendaries. I prefer to have a matching set and I personally prefer Combat. I do have those ones for sale, they are pretty pricey though unless you have the outfits or armor I'm looking for
---
I did connect it to a terminal, and the problem isn’t that it’s activating on me, it’s that it just activates whenever I power it
---
Take down their gts so I can join them on different severs and Fuck with them also add ME MeritedNewt7538 I'll be on in about 30 min
---
I might be interested... gt SetzerIX
---
So overall it's better to have rank 3 incisor perk 75% ap, rather than 3 x 1 hand ( 10%) each total 30% to melee, for increased damage. Due to doing more overall damage plus incisor will work with other melee types but you'll need to to spend more for other perk cards. Seems a good perk card to use rather than a specific style build.
---
I king of thought that would work
---
There’s a lot to complain about. 
---
Yet how many people have complained about the atom shop? How few people will pay actual money for those things when they can be earned through the game? And have you ever seen another game drop in price so quickly that was a failure? 
---
Any business head would consider this a flop, and with the only long term solution being microtransactions, the thing literally everyone hates, they arent looking very good.
---
Hmmm ok I really didn’t know the difference. I will continue on with this build and hope I find a Gatling gun soon 
---
This one looks great, thanks for linking me this!
---
&gt;Beyond Monday’s patch, we’re working on another patch that we hope will hit near the end of the month. This patch will continue to add fixes for issues being voiced by the community, including the number of plans Vendors have available
---
Looks like its the next one thats happening to. Dammit.
---
No I’m on Xbox. This happened like a month ago and I created a new character and left the vault then went back to my main and it was back to normal and so was everyone else. Now suddenly tonight it’s garbage again. I’m uninstalling and reinstalling now the only other person I’ve talked to that had this problem said that worked for them. 
---
Sure. And I don't need anything in exchange. It is very cheap to create. But, if you happen to have (or find) a plan I am looking for, then please do share.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag13hi/pc_wanted_armor_armor_mod_and_underarmor_plans/
---
The Marine Armor Helmet (not the mask).
---
nope pretty much the same. wait for the vault openings and events they were talking about.
---
Do you happen to have a full set of marine legendaries for sale? Or just combat 
---
Okay that is the same place I was looking. And yeah that is near the vendor. Also near the missile launcher spawn point. What level are you?
---
Were specifically do you attack scorchbeasts while they hover? I hit them in the torso and they heal it all up w/ my TSE Shotties.
---
1.  The guy who paid for his duped/glitched weapon is bitching about being taken down by a 'hacker'.
---
2.  Yes, all griefers are sore losers.  They grief because they can't handle losing.  
---
Sorry I do not see a armor reduction perk in intelligence I am using stabilized and gunsmith
---
Very impressive, detailed, and cozy. I'm all about that zero-turret big-camp-budget life, too. 
---
So, I predicted this a while back and I think we’re finally seeing it happen...as people grow bored with all the quests and end game finished, griefers are going to be more and more common. Thankfully I’ve only experienced them twice in my 250+ hrs. The first was a guy one shotting me from behind when I was a level 5, day one of release. The second just happened last week...was heading to the glassed cavern to finish my quest for the Ultracite armor when I noticed 2 level 100+ people in X-01 armor struggling with a Scorch Beast...I came over and helped out, let them loot the kill and headed over to the Cavern entrance. I turned around and they were both standing there, hammers out hitting me. Of course, I lost my temper at these douchers trying to tag team me at level 48 in Excavator Armor while I was just trying to solo play my quests. I pulled out my Gausse Rifle and one shot both of them, 3 times in a row until they gave up on revenge and ran back to camp....
---
After killing over 100 queens and having every item I think I'll need in the foreseeable future, I also have embarked on a quest to be a master crafter. 
---
Traveling along the river from the Nuka Cola Factory there is a house that has a radroach on a toilet wearing a bowler hat and holding a cane. It also has a wedding ring in it's inventory.
---
North of that there is a dock and if you head towards the other side of the river there are either teddies or gnomes playing golf. 
---
There is a teddy with a Nuka Cola cup and a beer hat in a porta potty outside Camden Park. Strangely enough when you take it, the bear and cups multiply. It's weird.
---
I've seen a teddy in a rangers hat riding a Giddy up but I'm not saying where. 
---
Also a jangles holding a baby rattle in a crib standing up (like he wants to get out). Same house has a teddy in front of a cat bowl. 
---
Play the first 2 fallouts on console and then tell me that bugs arnt apart of fallout 
---
Nope. It's still a problem I easily bought 10 today from random players. That's 3000% explosive dmg. And it lasts forever w/ Curator (literally forever, server hopping resets the timer). 
---
Even w/out Curator 3000% (or more) dmg for 2 hours is insane. Thats 2 hours of 1 shotting pacifist players.
---
Anywhere. You gotta stagger them in the air. I taken queen down 2.40 mins with this tact 
---
Not a full set, if you go to my profile you should see a recent post or two of what I'm looking for and have 😁
---
So that's what happened to the 6 year olds playing the original Halo online back in the day. They got older but never grew up. 
---
Yikes.
---
There are no x01 plans. Only mods from the vendor 
---
my son found the recipe out on his adventures and im sorta jealous as he doesn't care as much about recipes. he made me one though, i made him the wetsuit underarmor that matches. he likes to run around pretending he is spider man.
---
Only when I fast travel there.  Even the surrounding areas.  The only way to fix it is to travel back to my home near Wautoga, then close the game out.
---
If I close the game out at Harper's Ferry, it will return to the same black place.
---
&gt;just picked up fallout 76 over the weekend 
---
Well there's your problem! Give it time.
---
(No but seriously, I hope you're having a good time)
---
Its already in game bro. Chem addictions and stuff.
---
Anyway, tell the fucking australian governement that just because something is called "morphine" doesnt neccessarily mean you will become an addict.
---
Ah well, now we have Medx.
---
I'd agree that it looks with the Excavator, mainly because it wasn't meant for combat.
---
I've seen two ghouls spooning!
---
110%
---
We should have a full 1-2 minutes of complete immunity, also not able to attack once you first log in. This would help in insuring there's no hidden surprises when we do log in either nuked zones or mobs. I've died so many times due to lag on logging in because the game takes ages to render everything and it's made a lot worse with a nuked area.
---
The salt is real.
---
3/3 Enforcer right?
---
same as here, Panthera261
---
Pmd
---
Thought as much thanks for the answer! 
---
Its part of the lore. 
---
Also I have gotten things like caps, rad x/away and other random junk off them.
---
And you're still not denying it.
---
Xbox sadly
---
Awwww that sucks
---
Sometimes they give you something, like a junk item, 1 cap or rarely something else. It's more of a decoration than anything.
---
But only about 1 out of 50 actually drop something...
---
For me the only thing they do is rad me to next Tuesday when I'm in my Pip-Boy or fighting someone or something.
---
650 and 800 .308 rounds?
---
Her health scales with player numbers dude. So no.
---
Cool! 
---
They aren't entirely random like everyone is saying. There's some vendors that  just don't have them at all. They are available downstairs in a White Springs shop roughly half of the time that I check it. 
---
Other than WhiteSpring Nuke Zone and Queen, Westech and Sugar Grove have guaranteed multi stars and Uranium Fever, play that every time you see it start...
---
What type of gun is it? Also since it is tse did you add explosive perks to maximize damage 
---
People complain all the time, and they tend to be more vocal. I see tons of people with atom shop content. I myself spent all the free atoms I had and they really don't come that easy once you've finished the quests so people who are into cosmetics will buy. 
---
The price is way too steep for me to put in real money but they can adjust that. If they aren't dropping atom shop prices yet, they're doing ok on sales for their projections.
---
Any business head would realize that they don't have enough information on the actual profit margins and projections for the game, or what the current daily/weekly/monthly revenue is to judge whether this was a flop or not.
---
You're making statements that you don't have the information to support and using anecdotal evidence to try to support them... Successful business heads wouldn't do that ;)
---
I have been getting frequent crashes and I am on the console. No patch for me.  The people who are saying that dupers aren't causing it are very likely dupers. 
---
Still a bit much for me only got a thousand caps and the ammo would be a pain, thanks anyways tho
---
Its the same options as the other suits of PA, just look at what they break down to in the vendor menu. If it says black titanium, it's specifically for the excavator.
---
It's considered at heavy weapon, and definitely, it makes the dmg a lot more
---
so it has a jetpack as well?
---
This is me. Every day.
---
For the longest time I was on a cliff overlooking those fairgrounds indicated on the map by a ferris wheel in the west-northwest region. There is a table there with various board games, hats, foods, and balloons which appears to be an Alice in Wonderland/Mad Hatter easter egg. Thought it was pretty awesome.
---
Bug you get that achievement for being in the blast zone during a nuke!!!
---
Of course 
---
My biggest annoyance after getting a TSE then adding a prime reciever is when I get atop something to avoid said mobs, some players think it's ok to be RIGHT NEXT TO ME. Seriously, back off. Fan out and get away.
---
its not a bad game at all. they couldve just  polished it better
---
Anyone know how FO76 would play on a i7 PC with 8gb of Ram? What performance should I expect? 
---
Damn you guys got lucky this week 👍🏻
---
?
---
&gt;Are the communists still waging economic war on us by vomiting goods into existence and flooding our economy ?
---
This is just propaganda by a communist stooge.
---
Duping is the most free market thing possible.  Think about it - all those goods made available through duping not only drives prices down, making them available to all people, but frees up labor to do other things, like kill Scorchbeast Queens.
---
We get all the guns *and* have more time to kill things.  Its the American Way!
---
Alright ill try that. I got a tse pump, tse combat, and quad explosive DB i wanted to do  a specialist build and got aggravated w/ this issue. Hopefully it works.
---
I saw them the other day for 12,000 caps, can't remember which train station tho
---
Horse armor dlc confirmed.
---
GENTLEMEN!  We can not allow a ~~mineshaft~~'duping' gap!
---
It also ruins the damage I've ramped up on my furious .50 cal, causing the hit counter to reset.
---
That's with no perks for trading prices and 2 charisma btw, so could probably get a better deal if you're spec'd right 
---
So also they do it for caps.  One person in their group will not be wanted while the others rack up their bounties. 
---
The guys with the big bounties will let the non wanted player kill them and collect the caps.  Of course the wanted guys will have no caps on them so they take the debuff and then split the caps among the group.  
---
Wash, rinse, repeat.
---
Thought about doing this back in beta after reading how bounties work, but I'm not a douche nozzle.
---
BombFetti makes some pretty hilarious ones. Not too many, but heavy editing and funny moments in them.
---
Sitting at 4.5k and still waiting for something good to buy, it's all crap atm 
---
That’s awesome!!!! 
---
There are more dupers.
---
https://i.imgur.com/YLJs5Y0.png
---
good, lol
---
I've gotten it both in the location already mentioned in the thread as well as in the open train car that is a couple hundred meters to the east of watoga station.
---
An extra note is that Sturdy/Heavy variants of armour count as mods. They can't be changed/removed, but they still add to the weight in full rather than being affected by the 90% reduced weight.
---
This makes things like Heavy Combat Armour a lot less useful with the Weightless Legendary.
---
Had something similar happen to my base last night, me and two friends got engaged with a high level player who was griefing us, talking killing us all (lvl ranges 35-90) in one or two shots with passive mode engaged. One of my friends and I retreated back to my camp while my higher level friend decided to try and fight back a little longer. My buddy decides to retreat back to us, and this dude follows him and completely levels my camp while killing us over and over. It's a little cute house that I take a lot of pride in and it broke my heart someone just decided to fuck with us and completely destroyed my place. 
---
Thankfully we blocked him and jumped to another server, and my two friends helped me farm resources for a little while and rebuild the whole thing 💙 but it still kinda made me hesitant to try and approach other players I don't know now. We even helped the person defend his public settlement before he opened fire on us. 
---
Not sure we’re talking about the same spanking 😏
---
Actually I think jetpack is the only mod it doesn't have. It's not even in the .esm file. I've only seen them in person on a T51 and a T60.
---
Yeah good luck in future trades my guy !
---
I’ll gladly take it off your hands if you would be so kind. PSN - yungtekk18
---
I think level 35 and below players need to not contribute to the queen's health modifier, I have no inherent problem with helping low level players out, but when they make the queen harder by existing the same way top level players with top tier gear then it means that there ends up being a fierce hatred for them trying to help.
---
I once dropped a nuke zone so everyone could fight outside it, and the whole server was there except some level 10 and bellows who were just starting out, and even the lowest level players could use their best gear without having radiation problems. it took all of 3 minutes to realize we weren't killing the queen, so we pretty much all just fought the minions, and it was fun, but...
---
Modest creatures. 
---
Unfortunately heavy weapons and melee (and also shotguns) both compete for strength points, so you can't fully optimize perks for both at once on one character. But on the bright side it means you can switch to melee without reallocating any special points, just perks.
---
For a secondary weapon, rifles are perception and pistols are agility, and there's an explosive buff under intelligence. You also get an across-the-board buff with bloody mess (luck) and tenderizer (charisma).
---
I craft my ammo at a tinker's workshop, but struggle to find the junk (mainly lead) just to keep up with a .44 pistol (I play a light build, level 48). I don't have the ammosmith (agility) perk though, which would give 80% more at rank 2. Mainly I try to kill things with my sword.
---
Your gatling problem itself might be a lack of armor penetration, since armor's more effective against low damage-per-bullet weapons like shotguns and automatics (apart from explosives). I don't see any perks for heavy weapon penetration, or gatling penetration mods.
---
aw okay, thanks for your help!
---
Lore
---
More like a smoking and drinking problem. As a smoker irl, the feeling of " I need a smoke" every time I come across a cigarette machine becomes annoying after awhile.
---
Ok somebody needs to school me on the finer points of being wanted because despite the fact I'm level 93+, I have ignored it for the most part and I am clueless to how it works.
---
1. I see a guy wandering around with a 10 cap bounty on him. Look again a few moments later and he has only a 5 cap bounty, and a few moments after that, he's got a 10 cap bounty again. No one was nearby to do him in and cause the bounty to reset, and then for him to get another bounty again. What's going on there?
---
2. On the weekend, I encountered a different person with a bounty on their head. I found them in their camp and took them out - but got a bounty on myself. What's up with that? Do you get wanted if you kill someone in their camp even if they're wanted?
---
How do you know it was a kid?
---
No it doesn't it scales flat off the person that launches the nuke and begins the event.
---
Wait so you actually think we should have bugs? What?
---

Grafton Steel workshop spawns a ridiculous amount of Super Mutants. At least twice this has happen. A few count towards cleaning up the workshop, and then SOME may be part of defending it, though ive also gotten Anglers and Radscorpions as part of the defend, and there is still a heavy presence of Super Mutants.
---
Almost certain it's damage in general 
---
I find one almost every day.
---
But of course, my farming spots aren't the usual.
---
This happens to me when changing camp sites, usually a result of having like 150 of all my produce.
---
Yea, considering I play legit and haven’t had the luck nor time to stock up a load of caps... I don’t really have much buying power. Thanks for the input though, I appreciate it.
---
Join the Enclave and complete the Officer on Deck quest.  This give you access to the Command section of White Springs where you can learn the X01 schematics from an archival terminal.
---
To show you how many people died from the scorched plague. 
---
I’m a raider, I raid vaults, it’s what I do
---
explosive doesn't really matter against SBQ.  Her exp resist is 80%.  Explosive is actually a hinderance, because of the player/mob traffic.  
---
Sometimes people have a TSE at SBQ because they were carrying it at the time, or it was what they had ammo for, or they don't realize that SBQ is resistant to explosive.
---
Has Betheada given the ok to this mod since its an injector over our standard interface mod?.
---
I have found 1. And i have found a 2 shot handmade. I have found abput 3 random weapons i would never use with the explosive effect though. I farmed legendaries like crazy to find my shotgun. 
---
Thanks. 
---
I'm not entirely sure on this so you'll have to do a bit of research yourself but everything in the game has damage resistance even ghouls which acts as  "armor". 
---
You must remember that ignoring 50% armor **does not** equal 50% more damage. All it means is that it bypasses half of the overall damage resistance that the mob has thereby the damage inflicted on their health is increased. 
---
If a mob has very low damage resistance (perhaps say a standard ghoul) then you won't notice much (if any) difference between using a weapon that has the perk and the same weapon that doesn't have the perk provided all other parameters stay the same. 
---
Perhaps doing your testing on one of those high level Annihilator Sentry Bots may give you better results since those things will certainly have noticeable damage resistance from both ballistics and energy in comparison to a standard humanoid mob. 
---
one time I had the horde leader mongrel spawn inside a wall in watoga. that was fun.
---
There's no reason to do any build other than picking Demolitions expert at max rank and waiting for a TSE.
---
I don't but that seems like something a 12 year old would do.
---
Lol so the community made a mod before Bethesda? Wonderful 
---
I'm really wondering why people are going in circles about this. Lore wise the monster was mechanical. Bethesda simply mashed up flat woods with a zetan. 
---
Therefore the mechanical monster now includes a zetan
---
Look here on Reddit for posts about people losing items.  Bethesda's response is always the same. We can't track items.  The ban wave has came from idiots posting their duping exploits on YouTube
---
Mid 90s
---
Nice ok I’m looking for speed demon. It’s actually the only one I need for how I’m finishing the build
---
This isn’t call of duty man this is a SURVIVAL game, Fallout always has been. Part of survival games is struggling 
---
I wish I’d be able to find anything along those lines lol. I mostly play melee and yo until about 4 days ago I was mostly solo, so it’s been hard for me to find any good drops. Logging in and seeing a nuke over whitesprings has been a bit exciting, but there is always some group there trying to do the server reset junk and they always get pissed at me so... my chances haven’t been vast lol. And also, I heard west tek was good for lengendary mob spawns but I spent about 4 hours total between last night and this morning trying to find legendarys there and nothing spawns for me. I’m wondering if these “tips” everyone speaks of are only current on pc. 
---
Late to the party here… but I think a FO76 companion app would be great for reading notes, sliding treasure hunts, listening to holo tapes and managing inventory while in or away from the game. 
---
It will probably be a useless feature, when we have dupers everywhere selling their own legendaries at the lowest prices.
---
I agree. The water well concrete block things generate 2 on a regular timer. Build 10, you get 20 water on that regular timer. Three industrial purifiers, sometimes 1 of them has 0 water, another has 2 water, yet another has 1 water.
---
Appreciate the work you guys all put in 
---
So right now, there is only the one for PA? Do you know how many more there are suppose to be and why we havent access yet?
---
Is BOS Combat Armor paint acquired the same way? Does any set other than CA get BOS paint?
---
Are there any other base game regular armor paints available?
---
You can also get your ground zero badge without dying. If they nuke Whitesprings, just chill in the hotel till just after the nuke hits, then exit the hotel and boom Achievement complete. It's how I got mine.
---
Super cool ....until they patch it.  Nice find though.
---
Thanks man. Sounds like the mini gun is kinda weak I might explore some other guns. 
---
It sucks. I run into randoms that are one shotting everything short of lvl 80 scorchedbeasts and queens and I’m just like fuck, help me get one! Lol.
---
It’s fun, to a point. Still has a good few issues and the QOL improvements needed could fill a novel. The end-game is practically non-existent. PVP is plain broken, but we’re promised an update for that after the next patch. A lot of balances still have to be fixed, be they how terrible energy weapons are currently, how inadequate the loot is for certain enemies, or how tse weapons make combat a mere formality. 
---
The game world is great, but lacking in content, and you can get through the main quest-line pretty quickly. Base building is somehow worse than in Fallout 4, which is just plain confusing, but it’s probably still the most enjoyable way to spend your time and having other players come across your camp is a nice experience. 
---
Honestly, I would advise to hold off a few months *if you can.* That should mean more content, balance, and hopefully a good few of those QOL additions. If you can’t, because you’re a big Fallout fan then I get it, I jumped in for the same reason, and it’s not like you won’t have some good times - but you will be frustrated, to a greater or lesser extent, as to how far it all still needs to go. 
---
I want this but im afraid of viruses and bethesda
---
r/fo76bazaar or r/market76
---
I was hoping for more but it seems that’s what everyone does lmao
---
Yup exactly
---
Feels like I've taken crazy pills observing the group think in this thread
---
I have tried both of those sugar grove and westech, every time I have gone, have had no legendaries
---
I’ve got a tse Gatling gun that does about 600 per crank
---
I appreciate this joke, thank you.
---
And kill half the people in the wasteland with the purifier and exterminate tenpenny towers residents with an army of ghouls.
---
I have the same problem with lead and steel. Lucky hole mine has a metric ton of metal junk around in addition to a good amount of lead deposits. Fort Awesome or whatever that is at the old Asylum has piles and piles of surgical trays and what not. Plus you get screws from scissors. Mostly I just pick up every single damn thing and scrap every gun I find if I can carry it. Fuel cans and torches give steel+oil or some other good scrap. Combo wrenches give steel+lead. Torque rod ends or large metal parts in general are great. Any bucket or pot/pan. That shit is everywhere if you just pick it up. 
---
I miss being able to scrap whole parking lots full of cars for steel though. at least you can still blow them up.
---
I almost always come across a 2-3 Star super mutant at WT and a 2-3 Star Mr Gutsy at Sugar Grove 
---
Post on /Market76 if you're tryna trade/sell. 
---
Wish I had this when I first started out...since the game doesn't mark what plans you already know until you pick them up/buy them and go into your pipboy to learn them :/
---
I've gotten most of the BOS sets there as well as the Marine Armor Sets.
---
Thats basically the healing salve
---
No, it really doesn't: her level scales off who proc'ed her. But her HP pool varies with player counts:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a73ndo/the_scorchbeast_queens_health_shouldnt_scale_with/
---
Cheers :)
---
Well every time I go to those two locations there are no legendaries. Like no legendary mobs are there, so I don't even bother going to them. (Just so you know I have gone to both of them around 15 times)
---
O totally suggest a hard reset as well. This helps me when I am starting to crash a lot. I usually can get a good week or two before it starts up again
---
I popped into non-nuked Whitesprings today for 15 min and walked out with 4 one star legendaries. 
---
While this does stifle the soloers or friend limited due to how it works with Bethesda games (im in this part it annoys me greatly) but overall this is a very nice start for people to do and should hope this stays at the top of the threads to let people know :)
---
This is a solid list lol /s
---
Idk, I use Gunsmith 5* and WhiteKnight 1*. Haven't played today tho, so idk. Could be the servers. 
---
Perhaps. But there seems to be many just as many (if not more) millennials, generation Z, and gen-Xers behaving like 12 year olds while playing this game. Your intent is well taken though. 
---
That's awesome. Can't believe I waited to drop a nuke for so long. That sure make it a lot easier 
---
Nice to see that you use protection.
---
yes you can guess it with no letters revealed. But it may have too many possible solutions to brute force it. And if you type the card wrong you will need to use another key card.
---
lol. Absolutely not I've launched a nuke where basically the entire server made up of ~75% &lt; lvl 45s struggling to stay alive against the stronger adds showed up and it took basically more than half of the event timer just to get her to half HP before regenning.
---
Meanwhile a friend +50 levels above me launches a nuke and we miraculously get only 5-6 well equipped people showing up and take her down before you could microwave a frickin' pop-tart.
---
It's actually a level up based the time for the fight.  It doesn't vary with player counts. If that was true people would be able to join when she's low towards the end of the fight and ruin the fight I have no idea why people would believe that thread. They must not fight her often. 
---
That’s strange, honestly...just stick to the bungalow’s around the golf club area at WS, I farmed nuke zones for weeks before I found my TSE Lever Rifle...after that though, when you finally find an OP weapon like that, you can farm those nuke zones sooooo much easier and continue to find legendaries 
---
Love it!
---
drop it in a lake
---
I wasn't even sure how to respond besides telling him he should be shooting, not texting.

The best perks (in my opinion) to use would be:
---
VATS build
---
Four Leaf Clover
---
Critical Savvy
---
Better Criticals
---
Mysterious Stranger
---
Action Boy
---
Lol. You have so much anger, where does it all come from? People largely didn’t like my suggestion, that’s fair enough. Would you like to see me tarred and feathered as well? 
---
Where did you get the idea that they were even working on that? Let alone releasing it tomorrow...
---
There wasn't a faction system sorry, I think you're thinking of New Vegas which had faction reputation of about a dozen different factions. Fallout 4 has an on/off switch where it lets you do most of the quests through every faction, then immediately makes a faction your enemy based on a certain quest. Also why can't I destroy the minute men? I could destroy the Brotherhood and the Enclave in Fallout 3 🤔
---
Good Post, don’t believe the hate...ALOT of people get ALOT of joy from this game, including myself. Don’t believe the Trolls
---
Yes PSNid Enterres
---
If your gonna go heavy, your better off supporting a team using the supressor perk to weaken enemies. Dps on ranged kinda dalls flat right now. If you dont put it down in a few shots, you die. The exception to this are missle launchers and the broadsider as well as the fatman
---
Gatling is probably the only usable heavy outside tse
---
Well dude, BGS' own patch notes say the increase to the stash size (400 to 600) was conservative to monitor the effect on server stability.
---
In older games, things could get sluggish (at least on item menus) if you had too much crap stored at your house.
---
There are multiple videos out there that show gross load times for people with tons of duped items just opening up their Pipboy inventory. I'm talking minutes.
---
So yes, dupers do affect the server. Because too many unique items, AKA things don't stack like ammunition, cause too much databasing for the server.
---
Just me dumping notes removed the half second delay I had when switching Pipboy tabs a while back. 
---
and yet constant health Regen is a mutation, an armor piece or a chem away
---
an easily craftable small health boost would be great stimpacks are a pain to craft 
---
K. You have four people down voting my stuff. I don't care. You guys have no life. 
---
You say that like you don't have 40 spare fusion cores despite doing your best to use them up
---
Yeah that's a good point

lol, i can't unsee it now.
---
I recently made a rad sponge CHR / Empath build and i guess this is the reason randoms refuse to team with me. I often spam the entire map - might get 1 team mate out of it :(
---
blood pack, forest healing salve, nbasically already in the game
---
In your pip boy, go to junk and component view. There you can mark anything you have at least 1 of.
---
Cool
---
Happend to me earlier today, thankfully I was able to make 400 caps off of the guys who did it from bounties so the repairs didn’t feel too expensive. 
---
Lore, to hide scorch in poses that blend in with the petrified 
---
in the junk tab of your inventory, press whatever button switches to "Component View". From there, there should be a button option to mark a component from there. If you have 0 of the junk, you may have to mark it through the crafting menu.
---
You can’t as far as I know
---
it's literally good, a game hand built for RPG, character building, adventure fans who love the dark violent aesthetic and a story where almost no one has survived and we learn of their struggle by uncovering detail
---
All mods through Nexus are vetted for viruses and such. Highly unlikely you'd get any viruses, but that's not to say it hasn't happened. Just don't go clicking on random .exe files after mod updates and you really should have no need to worry
---
Way to comment on a 2 month old post.
---
The stat does have to do with the treasure you find. Increase your luck, you will get less trash. 
---
really? i have a cigarette machine as my stashbox, dont feel the need everytime i go to drop shit off tho
---
think of them as a chance to see into the lives of those killed by the scorched plague. look at how theyre arranged in alot of the places and you can see what the people were doing at those final moments. cool if you ask me.
---
I have the fire breathers uniform. how much do you think?
---
Sent you a invite from attack team
---
Wait people drop legendaries in containers? I've only ever seen the paper bags laying around.
---
300 caps
---
What's the issue? Just not being able to have anything else to do with them? Cause otherwise I do see the problem. I love dropping stuff off there. Plans mostly
---
That's not what Bethesda's response was to that at all. Go read them again. It says nothing about tracking items. Also, there's a difference between tracking a random list item or all items for all players  and setting up logging to identify a specific exploit being used.
---
They have logs and logging ability, they can track whatever they want and track things they didn't before at any time. That is how servers work... 
---
If you think support has access the the same tools and data devs and bug patching crews do, you simply don't know anything about back-end game industry.
---
I know where this reference is from, and I salute you.
---
the marine helmet does act like a gas mask so there's that.
---
also, jchamlin was kind enough to craft me one, so I guess they can be found in the game after all!
---
There’s an achievement for actually getting hit by a nuke, odd achievement imo. I got it then was scrambling to find my junk before others got to it.
---
Looks Beautiful! Honestly I wish more camps I go had some sort of story to it
---
Fixed that thing where sometimes stuff didn’t work right
---
For a start the Friends list is a lie.
---
That's an awesome C.A.M.P. the layout and style are amazing.  
---
All the live streams i've watched PC players are like grandparents wanting to go back to Fo4 and demanding more NPCs.
---
That's nice if you demand positivity and a safe space over everything else, but meanwhile on console we got guys building murder houses, labyrinths, and hosting boss challenges. I'd rather be griefed (had my house blown up once because i wouldn't let him talk over me) than be on boring servers where everyone is too scared to be wanted.
---
Last PC streamer i watched had all duped gear and bragged about hunting bounties. My brain was slipping into a coma the entire time, but i guess she was pretty.
---
When I out in the boonies and I'm looting stuff thinking what's next I see a machine and think I could go outside and have a smoke and think what I should do next.
---
Sick ! How do you get your pictures on reddit ? 🤔
---
Appreciate the offer but I play on Xbox.
---
Im noticing that there’s a lotta great people on this sub.
---
Yeh ive stopped helping alot as a result. 🤷‍♂️
---
I actually have done this since the beginning only using doubles. Just recently startes using the ones in my STASH to clear up space, but the justification is im doing it towards the "use different bobbleheads" challenge. May need to start reading mags for the trophy too haha
---
There's a blue suitcase at watoga station. It's really eye catching and near the bot so people put extra items in there. 
---
I doubt it would stress the server cause how's that different than dropping them on the ground 
---
With the new update on the 15th, we get explosive resistance from the "fireproof" perk. This should help a lot. We also have gear like assassin's (reduced player damage by 45% in a full suit) and sentinel effects. 
---
Pvping past level 50 is essentially hardcore mode on c.o.d. 
---
If you want to pvp right now at a lower lvl, make a post on here looking for players. A 4v4 revenge squad builds a tdm feel
---
When I run these on my main (level 180) we use flares and emotes for time out and begin. 
---
We also have enough friends now that we're brainstorming a scoring system. Something like xthousand caps to a team leader, protect him. First team to bankrupt the team leader wins
---
I got an explosive laser gatling defending a Mire workshop from Super Mutants, an explosive lever-action from a Whitesprings nuke zone ghoul and a two-shot handmade from a regular legendary Whitesprings ghoul. The other hundreds of legendaries I got were okay or just plain trash. Honestly you just have to keep at it because it’s all rng and luck.
---
Hmm. Fair enough. Guess I’ll have to just test it myself as you suggest while I look for more feedback. Thanks again for the post though, this hasn’t crossed my mind to attempt.
---
Yes. Everyone on the internet is exactly the same as they are in real life 
---
TBH I was just being nice including you in that group of people I mentioned.
---
Their opinions, or beliefs are largely leaps of faith at least. Yours is just out right wrong, as there is blatent evidence proving as such.
---
Well that's frustrating as all get out. Haha.
---
You'd think that the Xbox would operate in a similar way since it's a Microsoft product.

Yes
---
Thanks! Yeah I don’t mind killing a few bad guys here and there to make up for extra succulents and shit. 
---
No problem ;)
---
Are you just looking to get the responder fireman stuff? If you pass the Fire Breather tests in Charleston, it gets handed out to you when you start Belching Betty, but you don't have to complete that event to keep the gear as far as I know.
---
Eraser this now sheesh
---
Thank you so much!
---
Pop some grape mentats before also, stacked with hard bargain 3 gives u a decent discount. I take grape mentants before selling golf outfits and mothman eggs and wipe the vendor of its 200 caps with only a couple transactions
---
i time it around locations, reward myself for a location cleared, go find a nice rock somewhere out of the way, go into stealth and take a break and hope i come back still alive
---
never seen one and im sad
---
I'll be sad when the unlimited crits glitch is gone
---
Cant recall where I saw it but theyve confirmed its gonna get fixed.
---
I'm mostly salty because I'm tired of having to drop/sell/give away all this shit gear that nobody should be using. I just wanna scrap, get mats and move on. If I'm at a station/vendor, I'll drop my stuff for other players, but I don't just wanna drop everything at my camp either. Idk.  Something in the middle would be nice. 
---
Low hp heavy wep build with bloodied two shot cryo is good
---
That's the fire Breather set
---
For the record I never asked for proof, I just wanted to go learn as much as you know myself. It’s strange you find that annoying or offensive.  But yeah I got it now, you are just being a grouchy prick to me for some reason. Sorry I came here to learn more from the limited info you shared. 
---
🤷🏼‍♂️
---
For levels 5-20 ish I had my camp on a cliff above the Philipi Battlefield cemetery there’s a great flat area up there 
---
The issue is your wifes char is too high level.
---
If I recall correctly its lvl15-20 that gives the best chance of it spwaning.
---

Duuuupe  duuuud duud duuuuuupe
---
Get an alt up to level 15, or buy the plans from someone else who did the same.
---
Did you try placing it into a container and then picking it up?
---
Omg 
---
You can buy a clean version of the headgear at the toy shop in Whitesprings, it's listed as 'Fireman Helmet' if I recall correctly.
---
So I guess the myriad of people who also created threads here and on /r/fallout to complain about the game also did it because of "motives", right? Not because they were frustrated with a barely playable game. And those who even went so far as requesting a refund of their purchase did it because they have an "agenda", right? Not because the game is fucking broken beyond repair.
---
Like I said earlier in this thread, some people here are in denial and will defend this game almost religiously.
---
I have a small letters set if you want it for trade, ammo, or caps. 
---
Feel u. Some 1 stars are never ever gonna be used. Essentially heavy garbage I accidentally pick up while grinding. It's the equivalent of accidentally picking up a heavy ass mini nuke 
---
Damn. I thought it was 15-44. 
---
To be fair, you can loot the ammo that's in the clip of the gun
---
Fallout has long been the most hated series by its own fans on reddit. FO1 and FO2 elitists complain how Bethesda ruined fallout with FO3; FO:NV elitists ranting how Betesda ruined fallout with FO4; and people complain about how Bethesda ruined fallout with (insert lore discrepancy of choice)
---
The circle-jerk is now that Bethesda ruined fallout with FO:76, a spin off game not part of the main series and not even the first spin off game in the series.
---
Just wait till Bethesda ruins fallout with FO:5...
---
That works? I didn’t even realize if you had two accts going you could “server hop” for plans or what not and still stay on the same server
---
I'm on PS4. I'd buy/trade for them, but no luck so far on Market 76. 
---
Is nuka dark also affected by party boy/girl? It IS an alcoholic drink. 
---
I always think Dark Souls system should work in 76's world.
---
Nah. I used hers today (helping her level) and when I found something I wanted, I'd join her server and give her my caps for it.
---
Got a sweet legendary assault rifle that way. 
---
I wish we could put up the little stickers like In our camp. Like look here. Loot. Maybe the prefabricated stickers with words on them would be cool. 
---
I have that still. I just accidentally scraped my uniform
---
Cryo is for slowing and freezing targets. After enough hits, target moves like 95% slower.
---
I go with the ice cooler by the clubhouse, register at the crafting room in the hotel, or the bag next to the door at the train station, depending on if I'm trying to sell stuff, etc.
---
I server hopped for ages looking for Patrol Dury, even then its a chance for it to drop.
---
So lvled an alt to 15 and first go it spawned at Harperrys
---
I just found a 3-star explosive regular gatling gun at a robot vendor. Only level 30 or 35 though. Is it that big a difference between this and a max-level explosive gatling?
---
I think the bigger issue is the foundation pieces should snap into place if the bottom is below the ground. That’s not always the case.
---
This solves an issue with foundations rather than being an issue.
---
It can be abused to make floating houses however.
---
They have to know about this by now, I don’t think it’s much of a secret. 
---
That's what I'll probably do.
---
If I start a new account , that might just be my new main lol 
---
How do they work if they are on the right hand side but for your left hand and when there is a wall to the right?
---
:|
---
Id like to say you can actually get more from those locations, around 20-30 more, some are glitched under world objects or debris. 
---
I've got a two shot one in the stash for....some reason....  
---
Seems to cool to throw away but too pointless to dabble with. 
---
Dev's keep thinking we'll organize ourselves. It's perfectly logical - reddit has 100,000 users, surely we'll do more than just complain, whine and bitch about there not being more NPCs?
---
Raiding is not griefing - it should be about workshop PVP. You can steal someone's shop and give them a heart emote no hate.
---
They grief in large part because you (we) are boring - what else can they do? You refuse to do anything fun outside of your tiny safe space box of non-imaginativeness in this MMO. Scroll up a bit and 1 guy wasted 3 hours trying to get rid of his bounty rather than just roleplay, AND he got upvotes!!!
---
The whole point is that he is anti-social. He bought an MMO but he doesn't want to have interactions. If he accidentally becomes WANTED again he'll waste another 3 hours you just don't get it.
---
I've gotta two shot varients before. Didn't test it tho. You can craft the ammo btw 
---
Anyone try fireproof vs a TSE yet? I have it maxed in preparation to test I’m on PS4. Bare minimum it should help against exploding car BS.
---
I need help not dying and losing my shit
---
Don't forget one violent night.
---
I have played entirely solo and overencumbered without fast traveling from level 4 to 124.
---
I have done the rounds at Whitesprings many times, same for Watoga and some other good spawn points. At Whitesprings even when not nuked there will usually be a legendary or two in the mob at the golf course as well as the maintenance building on the other side of the resort. I usually do those two spots then server hop and do them on another server when I can't play for long.
---
I have killed many many legendary does and this was the first explosive drop. Most drops even from three star legendaries are one star and negligible. 
---
They are quite rare and meant to be. The impression everyone has one is seriously due to the dupers. I play on PS4 so don't get discouraged.
---
No way this’ll turn into *The Witch Trials 2: Electric  Boogaloo.*
---
This is what private servers will be for so we can escape the toxic players.
---
Thank you for the info, I will keep that in mind
---
Keep trying, server hop is ... rough at best. I got lucky on my alt exactly at 15, first log on I got it at Harper's.   
---
15-20 jumps last night got the X-01 Jet Pack at enclave.
---
I've read of some excessive times spent hopping with hope, I tend to do it more at the erroneous logons I have throughout the day instead of stressing over it. 
---
Tried to get these plans for ages on my main &gt;lvl 28.
---
Made an alt and levelled then to 15 and got the plans twice within about 20 mins of server hopping.  Got them at Harper's Ferry, and while I was there got the Marine wetsuit plans and a couple of plans for the Marine armour from the building by the entrance. 
---
Not with that attitude it won't
---
Yep, based on the fact that its a different spawned inventory.
---
E.g. what I see in the vendor is completley different to you, except what previous people have sold it. I.e. you will see the same items that have been sold to avendor as me. The rest is random.
---
Honestly.. the mobs are what kill the lower level guys not the queen.
---
They are hiding from the mobs because they can not kill them.
---
I typically clear the area with my TSE as one shot kills anything on the ground until the queen lands then focus on her.
---
Not sure what a low level can do really except be there.
---
The best way to get things done is join one of the two discords.  Join the LFG channel and let us know 5 mins before you are going to drop the nuke.  This is enough time for us to jump in and fill your server with high levels that want to farm the queen.
---
Typically there will be no queen fails like this and the little ones can join in and have some fun without you getting frustrated too.
---
Since your in Morgan town for plastic might as well hop to vault tech university and raid the gyms there for lead as well 
---
Ok thanks for the help fam

This is funny and should have way more upvotes.

Floating C.A.M.P. Components:
---
After moving Camp to a new location I was unable to place anything stored as a blueprint or as stored items from breaking down the blueprint. Items would only float above foundations and would not connect to anything. Logging in and out did not resolve leading me to scrap everything and still unable to place items.
---
Left it for over 24hrs and then able to properly place items however as I had scrapped all items stored I am unable to build my camp again as you only get basic materials back when scrapping your Camp.
---
There is a lot going wrong here. Firstly the issue that caused the floating items. Secondly loss of materials when Scrapping camps to rebuild.
---
There should be no loss when scrapping items in camp I can see no reason for this to exist.
---
What ever it is that causes items to float puts a major issue in game play.
---
One of the most frustrating things about having multiple sets in your stash and needing to repair or mod them...literally never pick the one intended until the last try
---
There are plans in the game's ESM file, but the EditorIDs are prefixed with POST_. When looking across all the other plans prefixed with POST_ (like mounted heads and such) it looks like it might be there for a future DLC patch. So for now, server-hopping the Enclave Command Vendor is the only place to get X-01 mods. It took me 500 visits (some server hops that I now hate and no longer do) to get X-01 Targeting HUD, JetPack, and 2x Calibrated Shocks.
---
People complain about this at least a couple times a week. I keep reminding them its a beneficial bug.
---
Nah it's not too bad. I did it for the first time time yesterday and I liked it for the most part. The silos are cool as hell visually those wacky looking robots at the end were cool.
---
I totally thought I didn't have a key card all during launch prep I felt super defeated until I tried to use it and I did have one hidden in my inventory.
---
I did feel burnt out afterwards tho. Cause killing all them bots then farming whitesprings is a full agenda. Least with the queen it could potentially be over pretty quickly 
---
Nuked Big Maw, dead center. All it did was turn a couple of mirelurk queens glowing, yet they somehow died before I got to them anyway (I was literally the first person into the zone as soon as the nuke landed). And turned some bloatflies into glowing bloatflies. Oh, there were a couple of glowing gulpers too, but it was nothing out of the ordinary for the gulpers. An awful waste of a nuke. Oh, also the lighting in this one house in a nuke zone is all wrong. [As shown here.](https://imgur.com/a/KPyQMWT)
---
But cheap
---
Honestly, with how easy it is to just craft ammo, youre better off never buying it.  You can also trade off ammo you dont use for what you do use.
---
THIS 150% - I always want give people stuff when they stop by my camp :) I often handout Assualtron Helms) 
---
I kinda did with "you wish"
---
And you're still not denying it. 
---
&gt;I find it amusing that they are simply bypassing the PvP mechanics by using a non-flagged “scout”. Shows they spent time thinking about it.. which makes it all the more lame.
---
I think I came across somebody for the first time doing this a few days ago. I didn't understand why he didn't attack me but his buddy went all aggro on me when he spotted me. 
---
The nuke quest itself is fun, but since they nerfed the fat ghouls,  people don't grind as much
---
Yeah I didn’t see new content on the notes. I could’ve swore they said it was the next update.
---
Haha my bad ps4
---
What level are you, what weapons do you have, and do you use PA or not?

I don't like how you can't wear your upgraded underarmor under the rocketsuit. But other than that, I've been happy with everything else I've purchased.

Philosophically we would all be meek, sheepish, and febrile if we lived in a world without bullying. Our intelligence would be a leaning tower of Pisa without the grounding experience of natural selection.
---
If you weren't bullied in high school you probably can't deal with real modern life and the adults who want to mug / steal from you.
---
I could make an argument that you're playing 76 wrong if you don't have team vs team on every quest objective.
---
If you all did that we would be living in a perfect video game world right now.
---
I don’t understand this, they ( dupers ) would just block you and switch servers.... must be lying 😔 
---
I'm thinking about something like this.

---
Whatever you say mate, you keep being toxic and unfriendly I’m going to go do something other than argue with you it’s fruitless anyway.

And I have lots of evidence, but you would just ignore it anyway with how huge your ego is. 
---
If you have ever run a minecraft server, you see the incompatibilities with mods. Its not simple stuff. Theres problems related to how a mod can loaded for one player does not for another player etc.
---
Im not saying bethesda doesn't have the resources or even a plan for this, but I can see how it would take a long time to implement.
---
IF MODS ARE RELEASED FOR PRIVATE SERVERS THERES AN OPTION FOR USER CREATED/OFFICIAL. 
---
- User created is typically what was seen in the fallout3/NV/4 nexus and official fo4 mods page.
---
If we wanted to see this unlikely result everyone connected to said private server would require the same mods installed, or have a package to download upon joining. Again very unlikely.
---
- Official is the likes of the creation club. They're approved officially and may have their physical content added to the client even before purchase. As its files are present on every users client, everyone using modx: would be seen by those not using.
---
I think if bethesda is releasing private servers with mod compatibility, the private servers will likely be rented to private users, (unless bethesda feels... very generous) and there will be an official selection of mods which I will also think will cost.
---
Its nice to think bethesda would give us everything we want for free. Just like It would be nice If the bank gave me a free house.
---
What a perfect message to send them.  I tip my cap to you 
---
I mean, I'm down to trade some weapons/armor etc if anyone has spare plans. I'm on PS4. 
---
Doesn't have bright headlamp either. But you really don't need bright headlamps after the Jan 10 patch that made the standard headlamps brighter.
---
I dunno, it is supposed to be like one of the final steps. The fact it can be solo'd is almost disheartening...maybe I'm just a loon or I'm just slightly more used to the extreme that some of Destiny's challenges offer. 
---
What I've picked up, and keep in mind I've only solo'd it twice, is that its worth the time to find/keep Troubleshooter's legendary items. Melee seems to work better than ballistic. I'm not spec'd for energy weapons but I recall robots have a weakness? Keep an eye out for magazines/bobbles that would help and keep them in stash until necessary. Definitely keep circuitry you find among the wastes (makes the whole core thing a lot easier). 
---
I’m level 43 I use melee and I use PA
---
What a piece of shit, flat out theft like that should be grounds for a perma-ban 
---
Now your asking the real questions 
---
In the beta every single one would give caps or nuclear material but this was changed pretty early on. 
---
Send me da thinggg
---
I have two cryolators! Cryolator like flamer is classified as fun weapon by me. They can't be your main piece. So most of the time, cryolator and flamer just lie in the box broken. cryo cell and fuel are to expensive to craft.
---
I die mostly from overpowered enemies 
---
Wouldn't it be atf not fda
---
nope. if you're base is too big to be saved as a blueprint, (blueprints now have a limit, they use to not) it's automatically gets broken into pieces and needs to be put down manually piece by piece. or you have something that breaks logic like camp fire gardens, stacked stair cases or an upper floor above a water purifier. You also can't even save your base in halves or thirds cuz that shit doesn't snap together.
---
I want aware of this bug. I shall use it from now on.  Thanks for the info.
---
Careful, heard using quack surgeon on someone that's gone down too many times can get an alcohol addiction.

Noticed this.. I usually get more than one two shot if I'm going to to find any at all. Pretty sure I've gotten like 4 in a server before. 
---
Shiat lol

Bugs have always been apart of fallout every game that came to console from fallout 3 to new Vegas even fallout 1-2 had issues on pc fallout 4 wasent perfect either if your actually a fan of the franchise you expect them they do get fixed and patched eventually, but as usually impatient gaming community and whinging milenials think everything has to be how they want it simple fix to your issue is if you don’t like it don’t play it 👍🏻 but don’t keep playing it and crying about it just pisses everyone off if you hate it that much and the bugs are ruining it for you why are you still playing ? 
---
Makes perfect sense 🤔
---
Launching the nuke was pretty hard. I’m honestly surprised I was able to accomplish it solo. Went through so much ammo. 
---
If they dont get the HP bar down for the heal in the first few minutes its going to be a long fight.
---
I will hold back and not waste my ammo if I see this.  Let them start to panic around the 10 min mark when they realize nobody is carrying the weight and they start giving it a real effort only to realize without my help they are going to fail. 
---
Then I either give it my all and win or walk away
---
What thing?
---
Ooooh gotcha
---
Yeah that makes sense, thanks for the info :)
---
I got lucky with a 3* TSE gatling drop. Before that I was rocking a lvl 40 Furious Gatling with 2 other perks. Can't remember which.
---
I dont know about the more people the harder.  Seems like the more people the easier.
---
I think people like or dislike a post or comment, if they agree or disagree what they said, and not based on whether they like or dislike the post or comment as a whole.
---
Same thing when youtubers say: "hit like if you agree with this". Context is often forgotten.
---
No worries mate

We've been at it for two hours. I think they were just terrible at it or stupid. Server just crashed so it must be mission accomplished for them.

---
Even if they are, which i highly doubt, since everyone likes to accuse anyone they see of duping so they can destroy their base, Its a dickish thing to do.
---
Level scaling, probably. If somebody way higher than you is in an area first, the mobs will all be high leveled. Example: I’m level 106, all mobs are max level, I feel sorry for the lvl 20s that come across my path 
---
When I say logical, I am speaking from the perspective of profit/reputation. Which is the easiest way to predict a large companies moves.

I always go after the smaller mobs

No

I hit it about 45 minutes ago and it was business as usually - ghoul mobs. That was also shortly after a nuke too,
---
Thanks! Great idea!  Also I've traded with you in the past :)

Interesting
---
I had something like this happen. The big thing is that they didn't have tse's and they were just using missles and such. I did go for the bounty and once I killed the two wanted guys I got barraged by missiles. Jumped just outside of death zone and all of a sudden I had 3 people I could easily pick off. They all seeked revenge. I collected the junk in amounts of springs and screws I was happy. Killed them all the way back to my base. Gained around 3k caps off of them. Got called an asshole prick who needs to stay in my own lane. Some people just don't give up even when they lost
---
What we tend to do is have the melee builds run around and focus on adds while the Queen is in the air. When she lands they go nuts.

what's a good number to have your luck stat at?  I think mine's only 2 or 3 right now (lvl 14)

To me it feels like its not scaled but could be.  Seems like we just have opinions with the popular scaling one being gatekeeping and thus popular.

Would like to see someone test this.

I got the small letters from defending a workshop yesterday and I'm having a blast writing messages for people in my camp. 
---
Interesting. I wonder if non-nuked spawn could tell you something before launching the nuke. So you could in theory find something at normal Whitesrping, and then hang around and launch some nukes there to try and get more or better rolls. Like kind of scouting the area.
---
Woah I see you said "wish that". You wish I was? Kinda weird man..

I cant even get a car race bed for my camp for $2... but I can get a OP weapon that one shots everything?   Yeah ok.  I think the $20 cash shop makes people dumb.

Just remember, if no one’s fat walking, then you’re probably griefing legit players under the guise of wasteland justice.

4) Description of what happened:
---
Quest: Novice of mysteries
---
Location: Riverside manor, bottom floor main terminals
---
What happened: I listened to the holotape at the start of the quest then went to go onto the terminal to do the next step as instructed, but midway through opening up the terminal, the server crashed. The next time I got into the game, I had to relisten to the holotape then log into the terminal but I was completely locked out of progressing as there was no accounts to log into.
---
Affected: Any ability of mine to progress in this quest.
---
5) 190111-000656. I think this is it. Correct me on what it should look like if I’m wrong.
---
Here’s some of the things I’ve tried to fix it:
---
- Opened the terminal before listening to the holotape (Still no accounts)
---
- Opened the terminal then load the holotape into it to progress
---
- Load completely unrelated holotapes into it
---
- Reload the game
---
- Wait a couple of days
---
- Got IRL “help” from Bethesda’s F76 customer service
---
- Checked each terminal if they were all equally useless (Yep)
---
- Checked unrelated terminals to see if they functioned normally (They did)
---
If someone sees this and is able to help, i don’t mind if:
---
A) The quest is reset for me
---
B) I have to re-do the previous quest(s) in the questline
---
C)This one quest is completely skipped so that i can do the next one in the questline
---
D) You somehow add the accounts onto the terminal for me
---
E) Something else that I didn’t think of which would help me out
---
I will try to treat this tonight when my crew gets on :)
---
Melee vs range balance is a separate topic entirely. My comparison is assuming two otherways equal players - in this case armor pen doesn't actually change the ratios of final damage.
---
Those mobs are actually most mini-bosses, Mirlurk King, Wendigo, Deathclaw, Yaoguai, even big boss like Mirelurk Queen. Low level players won't be able to handle one of them in such chaos.
---
Yes, both.
---
I was thinking about that yesterday when I died a d dropped all my junk. It was near the queen so there were like 10 people there. It took forever load like the Queen's loot does. I'm guessing that it then has to load the whole list of junk for everyone the area. Which if I have a lot of junk could be massive. 
---
I wonder if that's having an effect cause39 legendaries probably isn't problem but hundreds of scrap items seems.like it could be. Idk tho haha 
---
Oh ok  thanks 
---
Damn it. Well I guess I can call off the search for the bright headlamp. Been searching for it for weeks so it not existing makes perfect sense. Any idea if the bright headlamp on the other suits will be super bright or just equally as bright as the regular lamp after the update?
---
My favorite purchase to date is, of all things the VT Bomber Jacket...I wear it under my Power Armor everyday. Also, the Patriot Paint and Camo Paint. I run a Patriot all red Helmet on my X-01 armor with the camo torso and limbs, talk about looking meaner than a snallygaster 
---
That  left handed bolt action pains me deeply.
---
This is what you signed up for

Every time someone on this subreddit complains about "hackers" this is what I imagine happened.

BRB, building nuka warrior build.

If no one's duping then me standing in the way of an empty explosive crate for 2 hours should have zero effect on their gameplay so there's no grief involved. Next workaround?
---
There's a big jump from 5 to 6. You need to read this. https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Luck

Had this happen with bots but they had the name Diseased Protectrons confused the hell out of me lvl100+ and never seen them and there was like 30+ of them.
---
I see no point in PVP or any incentives.
---
Perhaps this month though. It's not over yet.

Grahm spawns then pretty often...if you wanna blow 11k caps for it

Ya that seems to be a thing. One time a buddy of mine was constantly getting 2 shots all night. Next day it was something else
---
Gauss* lol
---
That sir, is what you paid for the disk, which allows you to play the new fallout game online. That is your once off payment of $60.
---
One thing is to expect more because of what was seen in older games. But this is in no way the form of a promise.
---
But you cant try and say you were mislead.
---
Dont forget melee at top 1
---
Combat armor isn't needed. the PA BOS paint I think 3 more.  Knight, Elder, and Paladin I think.  
---
Does it ramp up indefinitely or do you notice a cap?
---
On this subreddit at least im aware there are some VERY dedicated aspies from the youtubeRbad fiasco as well as the compulsory rFallout supreme gentlemen that quite literally do nothing but hit refresh on a subreddit of a game they dont own to shitpost whenever the work up the courage but otherwise bombard dislikes across the board.
---
&gt;*”standing in the way of an empty explosive crate for 2 hours”*
---
Alright, now I’m curious, how is that supposed to prevent duping?
---
If your on console they are probably trying to dupe before the patch drops
---
I was at a high level, so in that respect it seemed easy just repetitive.
---
I feel your pain. I've only held 2-3 left handed bolt guns in my life. "It makes the fan unplayable honestly" /s 
---
&gt; Basically as long as you aren't making 200+ of an item repeatedly
---
Isn't that how you dupe?
---
Depends on your build and if you have class freak yet
---
How can it bother an actual player should be the question you're asking yourself, since you were playing devil's advocate, no?
---
well I said Guns.
---
That sucks, it’s crazy how Fortnite can transfer your progress between systems. I know it’s a completely different type of game but I’m hoping more developers follow their model in the future. Cross platform lobbies, transfer progress between platforms, and free to play.
---
My first failed Queen run was yesterday morning. I only had two other level 100+ melee tanks with me. Bunch of people 50 and under. They hung back in Firebase Delta hiding. There was a level 160 in a Hazmat suit jumping around with Marsupial, and constantly spamming emotes. That was all he did. Didn't attack the queen, didn't attack the adds. He just kept jumping around spamming emotes. When he went down, which he did a lot, he would just bitch about people not picking him up. Needless to say we weren't able to take the queen down that time. 
---
People dont care lol youre cutting out like 75% of players
---
Gatling Plasma is even worse though. I can fire at least two core in my laser before breaking, plasma, one core. It is like it takes 2x the durability hit.
---
My preferred character for Queen is my low health, high rads, all Unyielding legendary armor, all mutations, bloodied mole miner gauntlet, stealth ninja. Thousands of damage per hit. All legit. Very easy to die. 
---
Yep. Been getting this and the rage I feel...ugh.
---
You can get 400+ in literally 1 minute, no exaggeration at "Sylvie &amp; Sons Logging Camp" in the Savage Divide if you have the wood chuck perk. Only around 200 wothout the perk
---
Solos pretty much everything.
---
Maxed out Agil/Str and enough for essential perks elsewhere.
---
Swapped 1 Agil for 1 Cha to share Rad Sponge tho
---
Protection of anonymity, or the absence or low probability of meaningful consequence.
---
That's backwards. You should create a legit sub-reddit to find other legit players. LFG: Legit.
---
Otherwise it's basically harassment. We should stay positive here. Logically legits would be more imaginative and fun.
---
At a chem station, under smelting drop down, you mix acid w/black titanium ore to get titanium scrap.

Also if you're farming the ghouls in whitespring, there is a good bit of steel just lying around - utensils, coat hangers, pots and pans

Huh moster mash I havnt done yet

The arms are t-60 hotrod paint and everything else is x-01 blackbird paint.
---
The bright headlamp is now almost too bright, everything becomes desaturated and washed out white. The regular headlamp works just fine now after the Jan 10 update.
---
I didn’t say it wasn’t possible. I simply suggested there was another possibility, and then everyone felt the need to tell me my theory wasn’t possible.
---
Unfortunately I play solo, so I'm not sure there's much I can do other than hope Bethesda fixes this or hang around the entrance hoping to catch someone else entering or leaving.
---
I'm simply asking which guns people witness the most lol. 
---
Haha ive seen one and held none, every left handed shooter I know just grew up on right handed firearms, same as left handed kids grew up writing with their right  up until education reforms around the late 80s.
---
Heavy weapon builds depend on leaning hardcore on being a melee build to build up ammo. Also working with a clan that will give you those ammo types you need for your weapons. You should use your heavy weapon loadout when needing to do high end game content such as pvp or scorch queen
---
You can get flagged for dumping to much stuff
---
No, PC
---
Cool. It's getting late here so I'll go add ya tomorrow
---
“So al of that shit I pointed out and your two “maybes” are enough to downvote my legitimate understanding of science?  Okay 😂”
---
Then how come this story is about a human not acting like a piece of shit despite having anonymity.  You know what sucks?  Dogs.  Take that.  Downvote me.  xD
---
It was on ps4.  He had joe in his name.
---
If you ever get a chance to shoot a left handed rifle. Please take the chance you'll get to learn all over again. And it's fun to sit there for a few seconds trying to figure out how to work the bolt smoothly 
---
I feel like not killing the queen should trigger a hardcore mode on server. Like fail to kill her make everything in server spawn as lvl 500 3 stars
---
Lmao gay
---
I've lost my junk countless of times because of this. I've have a solid 3 infinite loading Queens too. No loot for me :) gg
---
No issue, I’m not on at this time myself.
---
I sell them, they bring fairly good caps 
---
Source? I've heard both 
---
Hunt em is good caps imo
---
So you consider planning ahead wonky logic?  
---
..stabilized has armor reduction in it my friend.
---
I thought you could only carry 1 tech data at a time? Or is that totally imagined?
---
Yeah that cave close to the station always has a bunch
---
Useless perhaps but they look cool damn it.   Not sure why they are so expensive though, they should just stick to a seperate defense budget or something.  :P
---
They are. I most commonly see it on the Harper's Ferry vendor, but sometimes Watoga as well.
---
This gives me hope my gaming life will continue post-kids! It's awesome you still have time (or make time) to game with three kids.
---
Man i desperately want a two shot explosive alien blaster ey.
---
agreed, i would have imagined that was their plan. That is why i complied with his request to trade me. i dont have anything against their plans, so its all good by me. On the contrary, when I heard the guy say that they were duper hunters, i knew they were chill players. Until they decided to screw me over. 
---
I would have been very salty if i hadn't gotten them back. but you see, thats the problem. They set out for a good cause in a way. Although, they ended up to be crappy just like the dupers.
---
Explosive weapons are still viable, like the ticket launcher..or would be, IF IT DIDN'T BREAK SO FAST!
---
even with gunsmith + double condition + luck of the draw, the thing breaks after 20 missiles .
---
Not capable of sharing? Or they just out right slaying them all no tagging?
---
How do you mean lack of blueprints?
---
Had 5 or so but that was before the quest was active
---
Let him have his fun. It's like doing a top list of pistols. 
---
/r/ThatHappened
---
I’ll trade springs for screws anytime
---
If u get explosive weapons that shit dummy easy
---
Yeah, mines red too, sometimes it does not highlight enemies but you can hotkey the helmet and equip/unequip and that usually fixes it.  BTW I think that purple is the flatwoods monsters mind control ability
---
Don’t forget the lever action rifle
---
I know I wanna trade them for 10mm ammo
---
I don’t leave my house unlocked IRL, not gonna do it in the wasteland 
---
SPOILERS BELOW!
---
I mean, the Scorched is literally the Enclave's fault, 'cause they wanted to be able to nuke stuff and it was the easiest way to game the DEFCON system restriction.
---
They also murdered a bunch of U.S. Government people just because they weren't on the special list.
---
The reason they're still not around? Some of them were not *totally* evil and rebelled, which damaged MODUS and caused him to release a toxin to kill them all.
---
Devil’s advocate would be saying that duping is a legit playstyle. I’m saying that I don’t trust you, or any motley crew of wasteland wannabe heroes, to not screw over legit players in the name of fighting dupers. I’ve had hyped up players, hot and horny to fight the dupers, try to shoot up my camp because I was using my high level rifleman to help my gf’s low level character. 
---
Agreed 
---
ah I see, wonder why wood though. I am on ps4 so that explains it. yeah you're right about picking up loads in minutes, I just go by vault 76 and can get a couple hundred in 10 min or so
---
I like your style. 👍
---
He may have wanted to try being wanted as a lowbie rather then a highbie, when the caps get more expensive 
---
Brb
---
Meh, once they fix duping, all they need to do is add another better tier of gear and render all the duped selling stuff useless - at least useless for profit :P
---
Thank you for the helpful information :)
---
As my main plan would probably be to just fuck around, most problems probably won't apply to me. Of course it would be great if they fixed those issues sooner than later. I will probably need to wait a couple months anyway but I really wish I could play the game right now :P
---
If done properly yes raiders would work. 
---
its for the snub-nosed 44 revolver
---
Stabilized gives armour reduction for heavy weapons when in PA
---
I dig it. I missed out on the Blackbird unfortuntely.
---
I have Hot Rodder on the helmet and torso, the arms and legs are Prototype
---
With Class Freak
---
Marsupial is really good (-1 INT)
---
Along with Speed demon ( I forgot)
---
And Healing Factor (-minus chems effect)
---
Class freak is a perk that minimizes get negatives of perks btw
---
I too have noticed this. The sever will drop similar legendaries.
---
It's a good weapon if you get good legendary rolls, but it breaks fast and easy ammo quickly.
---
You must have bad luck? I've never grouped or traded anything and have gotten 7 two shot weapons and 5 explosive weapons. Never had both on one gun, still waiting for that.
---
I still regularly use a level 5 vampiric explosive pump action shotgun with faster reloads. I got that at level 15... lv 155 now. My best drop is probably between that and an instigating power fist with attack speed.
---
My furious prime Gatling gun melts the queen pretty good. No two shot or explosive there. Found that base gun on a vendor.
---
I've seen it both ways... failed her twice out of the dozens of times I've done the event. And in both failed attempts it was because 2/3 of the people were hiding in that damn shed while the rest of use were out dealing with tons of mobs 2 additional SB and the queen...
---
I've also had it take 3-4 mins before we downed the queen because there were maybe 10-12 of us all level 90-150ish and all were attacking. I know one guy was using a furious explosive gat which was dishing out some serious dmg and I was using a TSE Prime 50 Cal MG and when she landed I was using my furious boosted swing speed Grog Axe. So I could just see her health ticking down.
---
So I've had it go from fail to easy win to everything in between. It all depends on the server I guess. I try to find servers with a decent number of high level players. A few server jumps and it's easy to find one.
---
I’d check Bethesda supports. There’s a pull down menu for specific account stuff, like I deleted my toon.
---
I’d ask the worse they could say is no.
---
This is horrible...and I love it. 
---
I am also still stuck! 
---
I've had a ticket open for about a week and it has been "elevated" this is the only obvious non-automated response I've gotten.

As we have recently updated the game and completed server maintenance I wanted to reach out and see if you are still experiencing an issue with your quest. As always please let us know if you have any other questions, issues or concerns and we will make sure that you are taken care of.

I don't have time to tag and wait while you pluck away with your unmodded level 5 bolt-action pipe pistol.

Imma one-pop every loot balloon that floats my way.
---
He's saying he uses more ammo to kill than he receives from these enemies that spam their shots.
---
The BoS are definitely arrogant - but they kind of have a right to be. They're trained military personnel (and implied to be among the elite at that, at least when it comes to wilderness training), and they're literally the front line against the horrors of the bog - namely the whole Scorched thing.
---
When the Brotherhood fell, so did the rest of West Virginia.
---
Could they have cooperated better and rather than demanding and then taking stuff, worked with the Responders and such? Sure. But from the BoS perspective they're the front line and last line against the Scorched infection, and they will do everything in their power to stop it.
---
And they died in the process, poor bastards.
---
It was a fun few hours!! Thank you for including me.
---
Wasn’t bad until you search clown cream pie pornhub...
---
I thought about this it would have to be a sticky but i don't think they'd make one..It would be awesome if ppl posted that they were in a nuke zone so we can fast travel to them
---
That one was a PITA. There’s a death claw nest you have to find, and it’s not easily visible, took me awhile to find it as well.
---
Nothing like going into a silo that some poor soul cleared (and obviously got disconnected) and all you gotta do is out in the nuke key and password. 
---
It seems like it continues indefinitely, at least until the clip is empty. Though the only enemy in the game that has been able to take a full clip is the SBQ, everything else dies within 100 rds.
---
For plastic I prefer to go to the water park, amusement park, or fairgrounds. All those plastic plates and Nuka cups
---
I have a shit sense of direction and always get turned around in the schools. Plus the wide open areas make for great long distance sniping.
---
Man, I think all you people are crazy.
---
First. You want to run a heavy weapons build and you want a gun to save your ammo needs?
---
Get a Harpoon Gun. Get the Fletchette mod. This is literally infinite ammo. It prints ammo for you. You shoot one harpoon and get up to 6 in return. If you can get an explosive one it'll blow through everything smaller than a scorchbeast.
---
Second. TSEs are OP... But a Furious Gatling Gun is /solid/.
---
You need to run the Martial Artist perk (it increases firing rate for the Gatling gun. Don't ask me why.) You also need a speedy receiver on the gun. Faster Firing is nice too.
---
I run 1* of each heavy gunner, bloody mess, 1* adrenaline, tenderizer. I eat scorchbeasts with mine. I can watch the Queen's health bar fall steadily.
---
IMO, any other heavy weapons are barely worth using outside of TSE variants. They just use too much ammo and break too fast.
---
But these guns?
---
These guns are the shit.
---
I saw your postb and I was legitimately upset for you because that sucks. 
---
In all honesty, if they had just kept to their own, we wouldn't even have noticed what they were doing. Unfortunately for their cockiness, while engaging us they also engaged trade. I appreciate your spirit here, but there's not a doubt in my mind in this case. 
---
We certainly aren't bounty hunters, rp'ers, or billy bad asses; but you see something wrong, you do something about it. We just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, and they choose to bring our attention to that fact.
---
Or you can pick up the broken crop, get one crop and one fertilizer back, then put it down fresh for a net cost of nothing.  
---
Good point, they haven't shoehorned the Institute in yet
---
Sorry, I wasn't clear:  I didn't say you would get flagged... I said if you are worried about getting flagged, do it differently.
---
Yet the servers are shutting down right now, at 10:131pm
---
Well, hopefully these NPCs know how to use paragraph breaks.
---
I thought it was a little too coincidental, I noticed several times I would get the “same “ legendary back to back ie 1* antiarmor knuckles followed immediately by 2* antiarmor knuckles. Had it happens with gamma guns and mole minor gauntlets in recent memories. 
---
It can be pretty fun, for a while. But even from the start, it's got more than its fair share of frustrations. Eventually though, it seems most people get to a point where the game just doesn't offer enough. 
---
I'm not sure exactly how long I stuck with it before I finally had to give it a rest, but probably close to 200 hours. I was over level 100.
---
Here's a short list of some of the biggest factors that made me walk away when I did. 
---
- This is kind of the underlying factor for many of the reasons the game is failing. The game is far too similar to FO4 and thus is forced to compete with FO4. FO76 is not winning this competition. 
---
- The perk card system. It might have been okay in isolation, but it's not in isolation because FO4 exists. Because they tried to make it a card/deck style system instead of just sticking with what FO4 had, you end up with all kinds of absurd limitations and frustrations. Until I can do similar builds to FO4 with similar flexibility, I would rather just play FO4. This, more than anything, is probably what will keep me from coming back.
---
- There is a severe lack of high-level (end-game) content. This is fine in a single-player game, where you expect people to take it in spurts. FO76 is not that kind of game. It is an always-online game that needs people playing and spending money on microtransactions to justify continued operation of game servers and other infrastructure required by such a game. It is also not really moddable at present, so official content is all you get.
---
- The one thing that should really separate this game from FO4 is the multiplayer, but unfortunately, it doesn't. None of the content makes any special use of the multiplayer feature. Even what little end-game content that exists only requires multiple players because of the damage output required. There's no specific roles for different players to fill, or any special cooperation required. So much so that a properly kitted group of NPCs could do just as well as a group of players.
---
- It's just simply not a finished product ready for release. Yes, even now, several months after official release. Most games are in a more playable state when they go into open beta; this feels like it should still be in early access.
---
So take this for what you will. Yes, I am being brutally honest here, which will probably offend the sensibilities of some people, especially on this subreddit. That said, I absolutely had some fun with the game. If the current price is worth 100-200 hours of fun and frustration for you, then you absolutely should buy it. Personally, I'd recommend waiting for it to become more playable. Of course, if you do that you do run the risk of them shutting it down before you get a chance to play it, but even if that happens I honestly wouldn't say you're missing out on all that much. There are other games that will offer you far more value for your money.
---
The NPCs random spawn prevents them from trashing your place.
---
I’ve had muties and scorched attack my camp, shoot my walls, trash my garden.
---
Locks and turrets fixed that issue.
---
I'm sorry but they have way bigger things to work out before player vending. I'm sure theyll get there but I dont think its tomorrow. 
---
God damn everyone, we have a certified badass. 
---
&gt; limited info
---
I’ll say what I was thinking: useless info.
---
Dumb Q but how does this happen to begin with its illegal thru ebays rules also.
---
Dont know what you are talking about my friend?? 😝
---
Nothing I provided was anecdotal. It stops being anecdotal when it's the norm.
---
Vault-Tec says that paragraph breaks are a commie plot
---
Drop it in water 
---
I have had my game glitch were almost every mob will drop me a legendary item but it’s always just 2-3 different ones (literally the same thing)
---
so far all vaults have shown no NPCs, they are dungeons for exploring. We already see inhabitants of one of the vaults (94 or 96 cant remember) littered around Appalachia as corpses, so its pretty safe to assume that that particular vault is empty.
---
I lucked out a while back and found a two-shot GP. This thing, though... OP isn't exaggerating. It breaks very quickly. There was this one glorious time when it did break, and I'm not sure what I did other than maybe press the left button to switch back to my other gun--
---
The game put the GP right back into my hands -status broken- but still able to fire as normal! I kept it equipped for the duration of my session. I burned every core I had, killing whatever crossed my path with a broken gatling plasma, just because it's fun to fire that thing.
---
"Lets dance dickweed" lmfao 👍
---
NOt really risking anything other than an in game ban.
---
There’s a side quest in which you find out a boy has been taken to a vault (I didn’t pay attention so either he was kidnapped or taken by an uncle) but this means there’s at least one vault on the map that has to have people inside 
---
Wow, never knew wtf
---
I break all that workshop stuff after I take and just before logging off.
---
I like a clean slate before I start setting up stuff. and figure others do too.
---
Uhhh.... I’ve got one.
---
Mostly just taking them.
---
I thought this was going to be all the places to find Phoenix when hes missing from the store. One time I found him up on the roof of the building next door.

10mm because it looks like a Bolter!
---
These people have already made 100’s of dollars they are just going to buy another copy if they want 
---
True that. 
---
The bad reviews mostly come from people who thought they were getting FO5 (they were specifically told that was not the case).  Most of the good reviews come from people who knew exactly what they were getting (Ark type game in FO world).  
---
I love it. 76 has been much fun.
---
I one shot with my grognak but whatever
---
That is true but do you think that will be the case in all the vaults. We did see 81 in Fallout 4. Which was a perfectly healthy vault. Yes its original intentions were bad but the overseer prevented that.
---
Here's what I've got.

---
I wanted to take Thru-Hiker but so many of the AGI perks were so useful, and I can carry so few other Aid items so I can put a little more of that weight towards Nuka products.
---
I took Can Do! and Good Doggy because it's also a powerful healing item and satisfies tons of hunger.
---
I suppose you could swap Slugger with Gladiator or Iron Fist, but I really like big, heavy two-handers for melee.
---
Not the same fella that made that post, but I unfortunately experienced something similar. Now, I see that we’ve had a bit of a misunderstanding, or at least there was one on my end. I was under the understanding that you were looking to form a duper hunting party. Not drum up a band of law-bringers to go after a very specific set of desperados. 
---
I’m sure you can see why I would disapprove of the former, but by all means, if you know without a doubt that they’re duping, than good luck, and make sure you get **all** that ill-gotten junk and drown it in the river ✌🏼
---
I do this too. It breaks so fast but man, it really lives up to the name lol cuts through enemies like butter
---
I'm lil surprised that it will be on T-60 but not X-01.
---
Not even sure if its in the game
---
Have you seen the top rated mods at the top of every list as sorted by most downloads?
---
Filter the crap, they top 5 guys are all good! 
---
In a field with 500+ crops, sometimes taking the time to find the broken one is a pain. Repair all with contractor does cost a few materials, but saves time.
---
Our lines were crossed on both ends, but I'm happy to find middle ground here! Cheers friend, and happy swimming =)
---
Part lore, part photo op, part decoy target, part ticking radiation timebomb.
---
Ah right on yeah that can get old fast your aren't uaing your base so easy mode it are you? That tends to attract people that dislike that kinda thing.
---
You don't know it is the norm. You don't know how many atoms have been or are being bought. You don't know the forecasts for atom shop sales or the minimum threshold to be profitable. Only Bethesda has that information, some will likely come out through financial reports and press releases but nobody outside the company has any access or idea.
---
You know that whatever stories you have heard from your chosen places to go give you an impression based on that anecdotal evidence.
---
Just this week I followed up on someone who said they were uninstalling three weeks ago only to find them showing off a new legendary they got after the PC patch in a drop. People don't always do what they say they will.
---
So yeah your evidence is anecdotal and doesn't provide any real data on how the game is doing financially. You also don't know how many players log on daily or how many have stopped playing. All this missing information is critical for your statements to hold any weight.
---
Some people do! I was hoping for something like r/fo76bazzar but for nuke zones
---
I think it's applicable in an armor vs power armor sense though, normal armor has legendary effects that can mitigate damage whereas power armor will just get shredded by incisor.
---
LoLz all right you sold me
---
The datamined files show they are all empty, with enemies (except 63 i think had none) and some mystery to figure out, none show any NPCs that are not corpses already (or skeletons)
---
Ben?
---
I found it once, scrapped it and several more regular tesla's since (haven't unlocked anything new for it in a while), but I would like to be able to put the mod on my legendary tesla
---
Lucky! 
---
Isn't the 10mm smg closer to a bolter?
---
Still got it?
---
So I actually have yet to head to the cranberry bog for a prime nuke. Is it better that WS?
---
Thank God it's in. And I have scrapped a ton too. Never found one either. If I do I'll msg ya
---
I have never gotten a blueprint for it. It’s all been drops for me.
---
Hey asshole, this isn't the place to grand stand or fanboy. Fuck outta here! 
---
That I think is the most fun. Finding ways to get into a locked base without becoming wanted. 
---
I have an explosives build so I leave mines inside their place and exit. 
---
You can also try placing power armor inside a locked door or window and entering it. Depends on how you do it but it’ll teleport you inside locked areas. 
---
They trip the mines by accident, I become wanted, then I get some pvp action. 
---
Farming Whitesprings/SBQ and no caps? You are doing something wrong. Just a heads up.
---
And all that sweet sweet lead and steel.
---
Ahh I see
---
Haha not quite. Hope you enjoyed anyways!
---
Late reply but no they’re under misc 
---
It's in the game I have seen it one time for sale at Harper's Ferry already on a tesla I wanna say I've seen the mod for sale as well but I can't be sure and don't wanna spread rumor.
---
You can buy from vendors 
---
Fun fact, this sorta noise has been getting done for literal decades, right back to selling fancy paper hats in runescape for unreasonable amounts of money. The only difference is that it involves dupes, but \*thats not even that uncommon when you look back at any game with a trading system\*
---
Bothering to harass them is entirely not worth the effort, considering they have no way to react legally to it (and any attempts to shut down discords or take down the ebay posts will only cause them to re-appear or move location), and they would only get a few names before everyone brightens up and is more tightlipped about that shit.
---
\*maybe they should have had a longer beta with a bounty on dupes and exploits like most games, and then have a full wipe afterwords so they can really catch this shit instead of a fake "beta" two weeks from launch\*
---
That too!
---
There is really nothing they can do about it other than change the game to not allow the most powerful things in the game to be attained in trade, but only through actual participation in endgame content.
---
Yes it's in the game, I've had it on a tesla rifle. It should be acquired through scrapping them. It's very weird to use though, it's like a web that you stick to the ground to do little damage, or an impact on an enemy to do a bunch of damage.
---
Not yet," I said. "I want to study its habits...
---
Well as long as we have that one perk there are no negatives!
---
My source is every screenshot of a ban email available for Fallout 76. None of them talk of character bans, only account bans because of the actions/abuse by one or more of the characters associated to them.
---
The emails go to the account and realistically a character ban is as useless as a throwing knife in a SBQ fight, so it makes perfect sense.
---
I consider the emails themselves to be a lot more reliable than people talking but have also not seen anyone say they had only a character banned anywhere. I'd be curious to see where you did because maybe I'm missing something.
---
Why must you dangle such fruit in the faces of us console players?! :0
---
No my base is away from the resort.
---
Got mine off a legendary scorch
---
Dude your murder church post is possibly the best thing ive ever read on the inet.   I was laughing my head off and got lots of looks at work while reading it.
---
I got 250 cap bounty off of someone doing the same thing to two guys at their camp...just chameleon snuck up in his general area (was jumping around constantly) waited till he got close and shot him in the head with a dragon...instadeath and everyone rejoiced, even the griefer came back and showed me a heart emote...SMH.
---
This could easily be changed on bethesdas half. Bethesda know people arent stupid and can easily mine data from the code. It happens all the time with the BOZ EEs. Its also relevant to mention the topic of the NPC that was found within the delevoper room. Im not saying there will 100% be NPCs im saying it currently seems that Bethesda are back tracking to the bad reviews the game has had. I love Bethesda. However im getting tired of the buggy games and careless attitude. I know they have a fire in them somewhere to fix Fallout 76 and make it better
---
Ive done it once, really have no desire to do it again. By the time i launched the nuke i was almost out of ammo, my weapons were broke or near broken. I was out of stimpacks and was totally unprepared to go into a nuke zone. The whole core thing was annoying. Destroy them to repair them?? The silo was more frustrating than a badly timed crash or fighting the queen.
---
Or maybe this, to take a couple ranks of Thru Hiker? https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1386f8&amp;d=e60em1c81s42sf2ss2sg2se2a72aa2a41am2au1p50i44l71l02lt2ij0c72cu0s71&amp;w=&amp;n=Nuka%20Warrior
---
I don't see NPCs being a thing for at least a year. Maybe Xmas DLC at best, if at all.
---
If NPCs comes soon, then BGS had them on the cards since pre launch, which undermines their original conceit that no human NPCs would be a huge draw to the game.
---
-Farmed a whoooole load of caps
---
-Then flux
---
-Brought a popular serum recipe
---
-Sold a bunch of those
---
-Brought more serum recipes, grew from there, lol
---
Ffs
---
I've only ever seen one of these attempts to make a ingame group without a actual clan system work, and it was the Bloodshades from DS3. You'd need a lot more then a reddit post and a prayer, my friend, you'd need the biggest youtuber attached to the game going OI LETS GET THOSE FUCKING GANKERS, HERES THE PLAN and getting thousands of people in within days.
---
Yeah people just beimg2 douches not much that can be done I usually just start spamming nuka grenades or my tse .45 sub and get the point across quick that I won't be sharing then lol.
---
Fyi my Gt matches, feel free to shoot me a message, will reply when I’m home &amp; on :)
---
Oh certainly. I agree completely. It may even be Xmas 2020 when they release. I feel like 76 is going to be another No Mans Sky. Shit at launch. Fantastic 2 years on
---
I don't need to be careful, because from day 1 i knew this was coming. I never stand in my base, i crouch. People are absolute lifeless losers and will scan the map for people that look like they're in a camp... 
---
The second i knew this game had any sort of PvP i knew this would become an issue. Even when they mentioned "it's just a slap until you hit back" yeah? That's how it STARTED... sure. Give people some time, they'll exploit it. 
---
I have a great house, it's a garage house with a bar on the side, sleeping/eating/watching TV area above the garage.
---
Would love to show it off to randoms. Even have free purified water with signs pointing to it. Doesn't do much good when the second i see someone near my base above level 10, i simply relog. 
---
TL;DR: People suck. Avoid. 
---
&gt;the foot step volume can be lowered
---
So you're saying i can increase it too?
---
Excellent...
---
I bought the plan from one of the Watoga vendors, I believe the train station.
---
Same.  It was bizarre.
---
I found one with a explosive prefix. Is this still a good weapon to slow the queen with, even though it's explosive.
---
Wow! I didn't realize they acted as shelter during a Radstorm. I'll keep that in mind. Also, I guess it's incorrect to call the tents a regret: I like them so much that I moved CAMP and started a build from scratch just to use the rectangular version. 
---
They could make the rate at which weapons and armor break slower. Or add in a way to repair with less material based on how damaged the item is.
---
&gt;microwave a frickin' pop-tart
---
Toaster baby... 3-4 min just before it burns.  Nice and crunchy
---
oh my god, the power armor guy killed him before he could even finish typing.
---
Can you friend these people?  My favorite thing to do when people claim Im getting banned is to friend them then spam them "still here"  Every time I logon or log off.  Did that to a pretty big list of people on WOW who claimed I was hacking/botting (Yeah it was legal 5 boxxing and all PVE) 
---
10/10 would sell you then if I ever found them haha
---
Its unique per player. If one player sold the vendor out of caps, that only effects them and not you.
---
Be advised: opening the vendor menu the first, second and sometimes third time can show: no caps/no stock.
---
 To fix open again and wait about 20 seconds. This is due to connection issues and not vendor scripts.
---
Vendor caps per player respawn on world reset, which is like 20 or 40 hours or something, I'm unadvised.
---
Vendor items can be refreshed by changing to a different server.
---
There is also the issue with the vendors holding less caps when you but/sell to them. (Eg. U sell minigun for 80c. Vendor afterwards has 15c in inventory.)
---
This isn't a bug but a way of enforcing a fair system, according to bethesda. Which I do not understand, but do respect.
---
I've also experienced this bullshit, another reason why I'm afraid of pvp.
---
No you keep them! They’re too rare!! 
---
PvP is horribly imbalanced currently, and many mechanics are broken or poorly thought out.
---
Also, I really enjoy the game despite its flaws and have hope they'll fix this garbage soon.
---

He was most likely taken to Vault 76, it was the closest and best option available. 
---
I prefer the brick and warehouse plans, I wouldn’t mind parting with them
---
Hey I've been here!
---
Had this happen to me yesterday on a server where almost every glowing one was dropping legendaries (mostly 1 star) even non-legendary glowing ones where dropping them so I got a chance to look at a lot.  They kept repeating a few types of armors mostly and I kept just getting variations of it (type and name's like Life Saving Combat or Life Saving Raider, etc.) 
---
Later server hopping a couple hours later after the nuke wore off another nuked whitesprings I found and I got a few two-shots in one go (missle launcher, machine gun, fatman) they were one-stars so I dropped them but didn't put the two situations together.  This definitely does make some sense. 
---
Btw I am Brotherhood-aligned and a huge PA modder, so perhaps I can offer my services to your best Fire Breathers?
---
Completely take that back. Thought I had it...guess it was something else. Sorry
---
Yes.
---
4 times in an hour while server hopping Grafton, farming the vendors there.
---
I think those fellows was just doing maintenance for server stability and you brutally murdered them.
---
I did it 5 times tonight and we took the queen down each time lots of new plans 
---
I team with my son.  He is not allowed otherwise.
---
500 damage? Thats it? Lol
---
Don't worry I'm 119 and still die a bunch
---
Ah, you're going for more of an assassin build. This looks cool too!
---
Prob a super who is mad
---
No clue but if its on PC and its a mod just tell them you are reporting them for mod use and they can enjoy their ban!
---
Maybe, he didn't really give off much of a cheater vibe though. You can never be sure
---
Happy cake day
---
His place in the Vault was secured by his rich father. If I remember correctly, it was kind of a “legal kidnapping”, because daddy wasn’t around when Vault-Tec came to get the boy, but they were under instructions to make sure he was safe, no matter what. 
---
Theres nothing saying the coding cant do it, its the same engine as F4 after all, the NPC found in the dev room is not definitive proof at all that NPCs will be making an appearance, he is purely created for QA purposes only, infact there are quite a few human NPCs in the dev rooms (theres more than a couple, around 50 or more), infact there are even raiders in the dev shooting range, this does not mean there will ever be raiders to shoot at ingame. The vision that Bethesda is going for includes no NPCs, i just dont see it happening going forward at this point. But hey i'll be happy to be proved wrong.
---
totally agree but don't bind it to the game as then if the swag is terrible they associate it with the game - I mean just look at all the great items you can buy out there from fans alone (hugs his neon etched glass fallout light) cost me less then a collectors box and looks like it cost me a small fortune and my friends try to steal it.....
---
I believe it has been mentioned
---
I dont mind doing it at all, gets way easier higher levels up.  Use a TSE shotty on the turrents and you'll breeze thru while melee the main enemies.  
---
Phase 1/2/3/4 get very easy after you memorize all the areas that apply to them/item spawn areas.  Usually can do it by myself in about 20 minutes or so. 
---
But I do prefer someone else to do it if at all possible lol. On a side note I've gotten a few nice plan drops from it so that was nice. 
---
I think it’s in the mansion that is part of the Mistress of Mysteries quest. It’s in the fabricator room (I think)
---
My Prime TSE .50 Cal and I thank you for this PSA
---
Lead was my problem. So farm lucky hole. 👍
---
Did 3 On same server today the last silo was lagging bad.
---
I... what? All of this is wrong. 
---
jpaugusta add me 
---
I would ask why people spend time playing a game when they can write a story better than most anyone. But then again, these stories are enjoyable. So please keep playing. 
---
Hyperbole to the point of being ridiculous. 
---
It's not best in AAA by a long short but it's ok.
---
Under-rated comment
---
Well yeah, of course, alcoholics can hide it well.
---
I have only seen it on tesla drops.  Weird effect, like a small mine layer.  Couldn’t see a use for it.
---
You can search this sub for a link to a spreadsheet with all mods for each weapon.  Some can’t be learned from scrapping :(
---
I'm mainly highlighting the graphics in certain situations. Nukes look awesome. Some other areas, eh.
---
Who ever told you that needs some belting 
---
How do you know there's no way? I haven't seen that confirmed officially anywhere. 
---
Never seen this I too am curious
---
Except dupers are FAR easier to identify than witches... I don't even have to see if they float. 
---
See YouTube around release. It was weird.
---
I have eight keycards right now. Always better to have extras on hand anyway. Only thing is they weigh a pound each.
---
It also says it does more damage against humans, but there are no humans🤔
---
Well that's what updates are for 
---
If she ways as much as a duck then she is a witch... If they are playing with a low level friend then they are a duper.
---
You are indeed correct.
---
Lock your fucking doors then, you antisocial hermit
---
I'm gonna walk into random camps now
---
Just out of curiosity, what would you want out of ‘clans in fo76’ that the game doesn’t already offer?
---
It's no Witcher 3 or RDR2. But its probably the best looking Bethesda game out.
---
Thank you, at least someone understood what I was saying, game instability giving rise to ways of item duplication. I haven't gone back to look but am pretty sure I never said the dupers were the reason for the instability, but I have no doubt those who's sole purpose in games is to find an exploit and use it to death are not helping this game to become more stable.
---
Did you get them recently? Because it could have been a rollback
---
the problem with "sharing" is the loot is available to both. if you tag the legendary I spawned and loot it I don't get anything.
---
"This isn't even my real nose! Also I legitimately collected over 3 million of each crafting mat and several thousand of each bobblehead!"
---
Stuff like this is why I haven't built a camp yet and don't engage in PvP. I get a lot more reward exploring areas over and helping out lower levels and looking for plans and mods than having a camp or engaging in PvP until the balance and mechanics are worked out.
---
I had a couple of griefers following me for a while and slap damaging me trying to get me to engage. So I led them to the most boring place I could just doing my thing while they wasted ammo and then server hopped wasting as much of their time as I could. I did drop them a couple of blank Holotapes before I left though, just to be nice :)
---
There is a lot more to do in game though and a camp is completely unnecessary so instead of engaging in the game aspects that I know would also frustrate me to heck right now, I am doing other stuff and once they figure it out will have that whole other aspect of gameplay to explore.
---
To me the frustration of the garbage you just went through is a major nope, but last night I went around Whitesprings and got three level 40-50 players to follow me and ranked the mobs while making sure they got hits and it was a lot of fun. Randomly finding lower level players in areas I'm in and helping them out or just dropping some supplies is a great feeling. 
---
other players maybe??
---
alsop this might be from the devroom maybe?
---
I started grinding whitesprings at level 5 so I ended up looting those legendary weapons. I would have loved to had them just given out if anything just for the caps.
---
It's a massive improvement over 4. Also, happy cake day!
---
Nope had them for weeks
---
A stronger community and greater team play 
---
Outside of a a specific location or two I think behemoths are rare. I have seen one when I fast traveled to the Whitespring train station and it was facing a dozen or more bots while I whittled away at it from afar.
---
I've only seen sloths in the Mire area.
---
I notice patterns really well too, not autistic. You don’t have to be to be good at that. And I’ve noticed what’s already been proved by others: mod learn chances are individually low, and so guns with high amounts of mods to learn seem to teach you mods more often, because all mods roll chances each time you scrap. But you can only learn one per scrap attempt.
---
Since the learn chances are low, the experiment you mentioned earlier isn’t likely to tell enough of the story unless you actually scrapped then modded over 1000 pieces of gear as part of that experiment. Too much chance for error otherwise, and really even 1000 is a bit much.
---
TL;DR - people already datamined the result.
---
I wasn't the first to suggest it, but I highly support it!
---
Maybe something from the dev room people were hacking into, there was a human NPC inside it. And a bunch of other things as well that people were pulling out and trading to other characters. Since you only get in trouble for going in the room not for having the things out of it. Or it's a unique I haven't seen before both are possible.
---
Some would burn you at the stake for that.
---
Well other weapons say more damage to players, not humans
---
nah its a rare drop from quests in the ash heap area (is that what its called? cant remember now). I'll find the quests when i can
---
Are they? Shit! It's my day off. They'd better not be planning on having them shut down when I want to be playing this afternoon.
---
Thanks for letting me know!
---
Oh, then I don't know what happened. Maybe a glitch? That's sucks though
---
from the experience of a raider that pulls 1000s of caps worth of bountys a day. i could tell u that there r enough tools within the current system.
---
I got it in an event, it was in “breach and clear”
---
he walks around the entire map.
---
I walk into every camp I see. And I leave notes for people in my camp
---
Hey bro if your on pc we have a clan mod we can make use of it.
---
Its really friggen well done. Chat to all in clan across servers, clan name, clan channel, it shows underneath players on the map.
---
Only thing missing is clan bases.
---
Hey can I get about 10 or so helmets? (If I don't get the plan within the first 10 I'll get more)
---
I'll be online tomorrow at around 4:30pm EST if that works
---
Hopefully this means human NPS’s will be added 
---
I just got the killed different animals type after the patch after killing like my 10th Yao Guai, finally registered on the last one after patch.
---
I've seen 6-8 few Fog Crawlers in the Cranberry Bog. 
---
Never seen a hermit crab.
---
Indeed it is plus for their first multiplayer as well to boot.
---
Go into a nuke zone with Green Thumb equipped and collect double the amount of flux. Raw flux (nuke zone plants) + Grape mentats + Hard Bargain III. I am selling them for 12 caps. I also equip ‘Good with Salt’ so they don’t expire so fast. I can collect hundreds this way, clear out all the vendors and still have tons left for the next day to sell.
---
Xbox no mod support yet sorry to say
---
This is a goddamn apocalyptic wasteland. I'll be damned if I gotta ask to enter your abode.
---
Do you knock on the door and wait for a response Everytime you stumble upon a farmhouse in the middle of nowhere?
---
No, you dont. You waltz right in and loot the place.
---
Drop your double standards.
---
Everyone can help! No I didn’t, I’m sure I’ve missed tons of lore :(
---
I've done it a bunch of times, I'll try a bit more. Thanks.
---
I've been trying to find one for ages as I found the extra jets mod. Every location I go to that it's supposed to be at there's either another weapon or nothing.
---
Proper PBR (not the hybrid whatever that was in F4) + Static GI to boot, so yep massive
---
I would love to see more of the weapons from old games be brought back and get some love. Its great we have the pistol and id love to mess with it, but im not spec'd for that. I want my rifle.
---
Im also holding out hope we get some more NV weapons too, especially those from old world blues, i miss my tesla cannon. However, cannonically it wouldnt make nay sense. The escape from big empty isnt for many more years to come. RIP. 
---
By the top of the games there is a &gt;&gt; looking box.  Click it for additional games.  They are there.
---
Saw an interesting idea from a YouTube contributor today regarding a kind of 'pause' for 76...a 'Quasi-pause'.  the usefulness kind of speaks for itself - you have to step away afk for a multitude of reasons, you want to take some time leveling up, etc...and atm, you have two choices, 1- find a place to hide and hope nothing bothers you, including other players, or 2- quit to main and essentially server-hop coming back on (tho, that can't apply to the leveling up idea).  This Tuber's idea was a kind of deployable, perhaps craftable, 'safe space'.  One thought was something like FO4's Cryopod, which I'm rather 'meh' about.  But the other, is great, imo...a portable Pulaski Personal Shelter.  Hunger and thirst would continue, but you'd be unable to take damage, since these things are supposed to withstand a nuclear blast.  How a player gets ahold of one can be anything from a quest similar to the Excavator PA set, a blueprint that is some kind of tie in to Pulaski (giving players a background or lore about the company).  It could be restricted to 'out of combat' only, such as Fast Travel is, or when 'enemies are near', restricted by a small caps usage charge (isn't there canon that these were coin-operated?).  In any case, here's a link to the tuber's vid about the idea.  Personally, I think its a rather interesting idea...

---
Personally I love it when I'm at my camp a random stops by to use my stuff. If they do me the courtesy of a wave or a thumbs up they usually leave with a few extra stimpaks and radaways. If I happen to have a legendary I'm not planning on using they usually get that too, and maybe some fusion cores if I need to lighten by stash a bit. I leave my purifiers unlocked, and try to encourage them to take the free water from them.
---
When you kill someone in the game you get caps, bounty or not. You lost the 200 you got because they were on a team. That way when you killed that one guy it said everyone else was under attack, and that way they could take you out.
---
Ahh yeah another person said it's from the ash heap as a random reward I only did breach and clear for the trophy and I haven't done much else there so makes sense. Most likely it'll be something to use when they add humans.
---
You already have that via your friends list and chat systems like discord.  Adding in a cute little tag for your username is frankly a bunch of unnecessary dick-swinging that we really dont need bethesda to focus on right now.  Especially when servers only allow 24 players at a time.
---
I thought it was gonna be about deebo from Friday 
---
O poo yeah we need to see more clan stuff it adds alot to the bonding experience of communities. 
---
Instanced off the map clan base we can build at.
---
Some sort of emblem system to place on our gear.
---
What i mentioned above that the mod already offers.
---
Plus i am sure many other things can be done.
---
Seems like that would ruin the end game 
---
Dilly Dilly!!!
---
This guy stomps
---
You know, this is where the idea I once saw of splitting the budget into three categories would really come in handy.
---
One for foundation/walls/stairs and structures and the like.
---
One for furniture and decorating
---
And one for defense
---
Its really good as a consumer to only use money on what you want to see in the future.
---
If the majority believes and behaves like you do, change you want could happen.
---
I personally think the atomic shop is a lot less harmful than everyone is making out and like the idea of spending a bit of spare change to further enhance my game.
---
In the older days lots if great ideas didn't complete because they would only ask for donations and not charge for the product.
---
I think bethesda is offering one of my favourite products, and if a little more money will result in more content. Thats beyond an investment for the purposes of my entertainment.
---
The money will, like a monarch ruler, maintain that the content we receive is of quality.
---
I think there is a lot of great things to come.
---
Thanks for answering I am done with this little to no thought of a garbage game. 
---
I love this!   if i came up on this workshop though it would be a little scary.     I would be afraid of a nuke going off or some type of other trap going off and killing me.
---
I was too annoyed to play anymore. I know I can get other ones but I also lost a legendary Gatlin gun.
---
Thats one i need to do aswell the yao guai even though i've gone through hundreds, I just noticed in the world section theres loads that havn't been ticked so god knows how I'll get them.
---
Ive never bothered to go to a nuked prime site. Then again, im at level 53 and im sure my specs are shit because there are entirely too many perk cards for me to sort through, and i change my guns too often based on what ammo i have a shit load of. 
---
Doesn't bother me, I don't dupe... I kind of like that people are jumping in to stop something they don't like in the game.
---
That said, many will do it without really knowing how to identify a super or dupers, just like anything these days.
---
I took out a couple of dupers the other day, well more scared them off than anything, and sent in a report to Bethesda. Then today I saw what looked like it could be dupers, but turned out to be a high level and lower level friend who just got the game. I had a lot of fun with them, but somebody else may have shot first and asked after.e

Knowing the difference and taking the time to evaluate is important but just like anything else, some people are reading stories of people who do make that effort and doing it wrong. 
---
Lights do to from what I've heard
---
That seem awful negative
---
I run a hunting rifle for sniping and a non automatic handmade for closer combat
---
Hardened reciever for hunting rifle. If you're on console we get legendary hunting rifles tomorrow 
---
I’ve captured grahm at Dolly Sods by building around him as he was walking through and he definitely just despawned
---
Excellent! We need all types, and it’s my guess that a role like that is going to be underrepresented. That means you’re all the more valuable. 
---
Two words: big money
---
This sounds fun lol
---
This works! Pop up for a headshot, sneak, repeat. Super-mutants seem especially vulnerable.
---
I ran a lever action rifle for long range stealth, and a handmade rifle for up close combat up until yesterday when I got a legendary hunting rifle. In summary, either lever action or hunting rifle for ranged, and I’d recommend a handmade for up close.
---
Sometimes I spawn in the boulders, and other times I'll spawn next to the boulders. Easy to walk around or out of. In my location, I havent spawned off of the bottom of the cliff. 
---
Look at that park rangers face... we know who the killer is.
---
I was fine all day till I server hopped to check a vendor and it went down hill from there for about an hour. 
---
You have to look in game on the challenges to see how many hours
---
Not for me? It turns it into a flamer are you on PC?
---
Did this maybe get changed there with the latest patch? 
---
Go to challenges and you’ll see the 7,600 bit.
---
I dont dupe either but too many people are acting like the Gestapo destroying anyone's base who wont show them their inventory, or stay at their camp too long, or are playing with a low lvl friend, or even just having an explosive weapon seems to make you guilty. It's one thing to catch someone in the act and report them, it's another thing all together to go out trying to police other players and grief everyone doesn't submit to your demands.
---
Very 
---
Such a harrowing tale and told in a way that immersed me in your adventure without drowning me in detail and overt flourish.
---
I recommend you do the mayor for a day quest, Phoenix is a good friend of mine now and restocks pretty often :)
---
Lol I’ll try to join this guys world to hear his music 
---
Im running stats like yours and the Lever Action is pretty good. It has a pretty good fire rate for your average sniper, takes common .45 ammo, and it's very modifiable. 
---
As far as I know, watoga high schools cups aren't made of plastic. If I'm wrong... I don't wanna think about how much plastic I've left!
---
Well it’s true, you can already team up and play with your friends now. Complete quests together, enter into PVP together... I don’t see how it would make a stronger community
---
two shot on a shotgun doesn't really do anything though, it just adds one more pellet.
---
I stumbled across it at the Welch Vendor. I gave it to my buddy. If I find another I will keep you in mind. 
---
Vault 76 was made for the best “operating” people of America, the ones who could be depended on to restart society. There are still other vaults on the map, vaults 63, 94, and 96.
---
Thanks! Next time you see Phoenix tell him RotoDAP says thanks again :) 
---
HE SAID BARE
---
I'm in. Pippinramon level 116
---
Yeah, that's pretty toxic, and the other end of the spectrum. Kids (of any physical age) taking a potentially good thing and power tripping on it is going to happen. 
---
I am grateful for your kindness :D
---
I'm pretty much a carebear in this game, I prefer helping people and crafting, but I have been attacked a few times. When I was under level 110 or so I was purely specced into crafting, weight, utility, team, CAMP, and workshop perks, and couldn't harm a fly. I admittedly didn't win a single PVP bout, and was forced to just tolerate griefing when it occurred even as a level 110.   
---
Course, then I started finally speccing out into my combat build, and by about 140 I was finished. Up until this time I wasn't even really farming, just upgrading all my buddies stuff, selling and trading stuff, tracking down plans, et cetera. I probably had like 400 hours at that point? I've witnessed just about every type of griefer this game has to offer, and all the methods behind it... Weirdly being so puny allowed me a good insight into everything they do, after all I was forced to witness it all.   
---
I haven't died since level 130 or so to a player, that was a little over 100 hours ago in the game. I have killed DOZENS of groups of people trying to kill me, demolished their camps, destroyed their workshops (They don't usually take them, but if they do it's always the ammo factory), and griefed them endlessly. Having a good network of friends, a solid understanding of stealth, a ton of outstanding weapons (My favorite is a two-shot Fat Man with the MIRV attachment that I use with maxed explosion expert and Wrecking Ball, at the right height and angle it will destroy everything in any camp or workshop in the game (Except the airport, can't cover that much ground, but maybe with 5 shots?)).  
---
I feel like a master class in anti-griefing tactics is needed honestly. To be fair, I haven't run into anyone using the infinite bobblehead thing to one shot pacifists, and I can't really see any counter to that, unfortunately. However, short of that, it's very easy to counter griefers and make them regret their choices. I can even make you a non-legendary weapon that with the right spec can kill a wanted griefer and his entire team in one clip fairly reliably (Barring use of sentinel bolstering armor with layered perks raising defense further, I don't know a way to counter that except TSE weapons, and anti-armor doesn't work either since it's just a straight damage reduction).   
---
One key for the most grievous griefers though is never target 'them' harass their stuff. Go to their server, block them in game, but track their Gamertag, blow up their base, wait 30 minutes after you leave, join them again, blow up their camp again, watch for them dupping, steal all their stuff, throw it in a river (Credit due to another Redditor for that idea). Most griefers are relatively immature and can't handle a good dose of their own medicine, so just rejoice in the knowledge that their aggravation is ten times worse than however they made you feel, and imagine the childish rage quit that will eventually follow if you just continue to silently mess with them for ages.   
---
Level 170, and I get no greater pleasure than making griefers hate this game because they got griefed. 
---
Ok thank you 
---
Join the enclave 
---
if by end game you mean farming TSE.
---
The graphics are actually really nice! I like what they did with the lighting and the touch of green really lifts the experience of the game
---
Its a rare drop from the Lode Baring event
---
Will do, you haven't lived until you've watched him plow through 30 Protectrons and 4 or 5 assaultrons before he's ready to trade with you. He is one bad dude with some great goods.
---
People wanna feel like they are big and bad and then get carried away. The most people should do is report people that are selling duped stuff and they have proof. 
---
im the one recruiting ppl for my faction not looking for a faction, did you even read it?
---
I got it from breach and clear 
---
I found a 3-star explosive lever-action and a two-shot handmade at Whitesprings. There are lots of crap legendary items there but it’s definitely as good a place as any if not better.
---
Enforcer, shoot the ground under them - GAME!
---
They even tried to fix it once...lead to the bug where you had to unequip all armor before relogging...luckily got reverted...
---
They do seems to age a bit resulting in more rads on consumption. Ive had two types of the food items and one adds more rads than the other
---
That's the approach I take. It's pretty easy to just scare the real dupers off once you have video of what they're doing and submit it.
---
Bashing a dupers camo is nothing, killing them is nothing, reporting them for a potential ban with video or screenshot evidence is the real badass way.
---
Nope, I actually mean 40% faster swing speed, vampire effect, 40% more power attack dmg, and all legendary armor effect. Why don't you hope down off that band wagon and have a reasonable discussion.
---
I love all the old timers playing this game. No idea why there’s so many on this one specifically, but boy I hope Bethesda caters to their every whim.
---
Free country. Suck a lemon
---
I'm gonna touch your chairs, you can't stop me. It will happen!
---
I’m still a few short. I’m just about 200 hours in and have never killed another player. 
---
My favorite:
---
Kill mutant A that is wrecking me with a minigun.  Then I loot that minigun from A's corpse.  Mutant B runs up to A's corpse, pulls out ANOTHER minigun, presumably from A's butthole, and starts shooting me with it.
---
Exactly and then innocent people aren't getting trolled. I think most of these people dont actually care about duping, they are just happy to have a reason to grief people.
---
I have lead a few clans in other games and tbh have found many like minded friends. In this game I have found 1 new friend and most of my xbox friends dont play. So tell me how clans would not draw teams together. 
---
Speed demon causes you to burn through food and water faster. 
---
Watoga is a no.. man’s.. land............ LITERALLY
---
Oh, I'll make sure it is.
---
Yeah white Knight griefing is a thing, sadly.
---
A troll is a troll whether their hat is white or black.
---
Mine is a little grey but that's really only if you build a camp right at the golf course... I just hate that.
---
🎧🎵🎶
---
Ok thx
---
Looks like we have something to report to MODUS,  Members...
---
Yes, and I'm guessing a wealthy successful businessman like Arthur Woods could buy a spot there. 
---
The best and brightest of America in the Fallout universe usually have no morals. 
---
It’s the duper’s trying to get there last dupes in
---
You would think so but because Incisor modifies the divisor in the damage coefficient equation it has the same proportionate affect against both targets.
---
And he will be banned for being the worst kind of human trash
---
This would explain a lot.
---
And also, it's total BS. I mean if it works like this, it feels like a terrible design choice.
---
At least you are honest. If you build there you gotta know someone is gonna get you though... ots common knowledge. 
---
Do you have proof?
---
[And it's not so far from truth](https://imgur.com/zKMbqEU)
---
I have a couple of max out perk cards. still at 0/7
---
I’ve done it. If the Responders are willing to take an alcoholic former combat medic with a slight mentats addiction, I’m on board.
---
It’s funny because I’m not banned and won’t be
---
Any weapons/armor that would be really worth it to hold off on until lvl 50?   The only legendary I have so far is the somerset special
---
Yup and I always let a low level collect my bounty and take the caps and junk. Although nobody ever really takes the 600-700 or so pounds of junk I usually drop and anything important is loaded to the stash regularly.
---
But I give a lot of it away to people I meet so if they take some, and they needed it that's a good thing.
---
There's programs right on the nexus site to explore the game files. People have been working alongside Bethesda for decades learning how their games tick.
---
It's simple to deduce based on the lack of tables for it and such in the files.
---
Thanks we need more guides like this ..appreciate your info
---
Proof or GTFO sick of this fear mongering
---
I usually play solo, so the farm is nowhere near the level in which everyone else brags about. And since I’m usually solo, fast travel costs suck.
---
Sadly bots DO NOT in fact count. I think it's because it says specifically "creatures". I started from vault 76 since I noticed it's a really low damage weapon. Those chinese bots? No credit. Running north I hit a protectron, no credit. Further north a Mr. Handy, no credit. I figured I'd either screwed something up or the quest/item was straight up bugged but then I ran into dogs, molerats, and scorched and all counted. They may have counted before but def no longer.
---
That's kind of what I figured too 
---
My buddy and I dropped our frist nuke on the generals restaurant in the mire/bog border area.  We both raided his garden and got some pretty good flora.  Didn't have time to check the surrounding area because we both had to log.  Gonna check the rest of the area next time
---
You seem cool. Was nice chating with you but I'm going to get some sleep now. Have a good one.
---
There is a human NPC in the game. His name is Wooby
---
Oh wow, this is the kind of joke I make to get my wife to make *that face* at me. I love it. I’m going to steal it. 
---
How long will it last?
---
You too, see you in the wasteland and keep well.
---
Would you mind telling us how do you organize this?
---
Commenting for interest, id love to hear how this goes, as someone who is desprate for decent legendaries.
---
See I love building and I'm very attached to my house 😫  
---
I deleted all my saved and blue printed structures hoping that would solve the issue.  I managed to place it shortly after posting this by rapidly switching tabs and spamming the build button,  but it's a little ridiculous that I have to do that. 
---
With prison break, I noticed I tended to get the same two plans when farming on any particular day. The next day, I would tend to get 2 different plans. It took me about 4 days of farming (1-4 hour per day) to get it. It seems pretty hit or miss, but it is in the drop rotation.
---
And he carries the legendary banhammer apparently.
---
I've seen a cryolator practically freeze her in mid air, it can also keep her on the ground for a very long time, an OP version of that gun in the fight can really turn the tables in the players favour.
---
I have no proof but here is a detailed explanation.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgP2s50keJg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgP2s50keJg) 
---
I believe it was intended that we, the players, are the signs of recovery you speak of.
---
And those signs are griefing and duping, farming (not the appropriate kind) and exploiting.
---
So...probably pretty realistic as far as "humanity recovering from nuclear annihilation"
---
For items that are not completely damage:  store the item and then replace.  Item will be good as new.  
---
Well, you asked for it.
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/t/fallout-76-map-of-resource-deposits/
---
what an absolute madlad. I'm gonna get some friends together and launch my first nuke
---
You know theres a story that explains why, and an update that will come out eventually where people come out of the vaults right? It's been talked about for a long time now.
---
I love it. It's so much darker and it really feels like survival. There is no hope for a better future.
---
You don't want to be this asshole's friend.  I ran into him at whitesprings as well and he seems to just hang around there being a total prick to anyone that wanders by.  Killed me by jumping in front of my explosive shotgun, stole all of my junk and then spent a good 15 minutes screaming swears at me trying to get me to drop pacifist and then using all of his duped bobbleheads and duped explosive weapons to oneshot me when I did.
---
Definitely the hardest boss in franchise so far
---
I was trying to get your loot
---
A guardian angle i guess
---
And there are actual living players in this game
---
Glowing behemoth is level 95 as well
---
A man of my own taste, awesome. 
---
I hope it will be quick. I was planning to play this afternoon and evening. I have just got the brick plans, so I have a new house to build.
---
I killed a scorched holding a machete in his cold dead hands, but he gave me a combat knife. 
---
Stop running around telling everyone there's more duping methods. If you can demonstrate it report to Beth and move on. Otherwise people are just going to run around purposely destabilizing servers trying to figure out how to do it.
---
Hey listen here. I’m level 74, a fallout vet, and I think I’m pretty solid at this whole gaming thing... and I haven’t killed a scorchbeast solo yet. Way to go, girl.
---
The English in this post... it hurts my brain... WTF ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?! 
---
I guess he's the Mysterious Stranger lol
---
I was planning to make an old colonial house today as well. Guess it’ll have to wait
---
I had a coworker years ago, he would get drunk after work and then play some Conan mmo game. He would go to the bridge where the newbies leave the safety of the starting area and become fair game and he would just mow them down for hours until he got bored or they stopped spawning...people are garbage
---
*increased it to max as soon as he got the game*
---
Tyvm :)
---
No reason why you can’t put custom small text on the side of one.  You’ll either get a few laughs or a few grenades. Or both. 
---
We organize in [discord]( https://discord.gg/V8zrj67)
---
Fireproof(45%explosion reduction) + dense(50% explosion redution) +5 parts 3 star armor with sentinel/cavalier/blocker(slot3)(75% less dmg while standing still/sprinting/blocking) and assassin(slot1)(40%pvp dmg reduction) + slot 2 effect of choice.
---
All of these effects are armor pen secure btw.
---
These parts are a massive time investment but *should*(didn't get to test the whole strength yet) make you insanely tank in pvp. The downside? Assassin+Sentinel is much rarer than tse since Sentinel is a 3* exclusive effect *and* you will need 5(!) different armor parts with this combination(sentinel alone is slready pretty strong though)
---
If someone has a bounty it shouldn't matter if you have pacifist on. You deal regular damage, or am I mistaken? 
---
A youtuber reads reddit then makes a vid theorizing about a post is evidence of nothing.

Would anyone like to join me in helping complete "I am become death?"

would prefer we do this at 5:30PM EST
---
I did this to berkeley springs west yesterday has like 10 sirens and about 20 noise boxes had to unplug my headphones so much sound tearing 
---
Just switched from sniper rifle to Gauss, and other than the fact the ammo weighs so much it basically requires batteries included, I'm never going back.  Faster, 3x the damage, similar range.
---
Video restricted
---
I was pretty disappointed when I figured out it’s just cloth
---
Well either it doesn't or I missed.
---
The last hour has been brutal 
---
I still don’t see how clans would help the friend making process. If you’re looking for people to play with, why not utilise Discord, Forums or even reddit?
---
It's part of the about-to-be-patched dupe process. Probably some asshole trying to capitalise on that.
---
Hum interesting concept, the only downside i can see to this is that it requires an extra wall separate from your door wall. So having 1x1 entrance wouldn't work with this.
---
Still upvoting for visibility for those that never played FO4 or are ignorant in advanced power connector tactics 
---
Not a case of should, more of a case of can. The typical person buying the video game isn't going to feel as idealistic about duping compared to someone who surfs the subreddit. Temptation is easy for someone with only half a foot in the water. Could totally see someone picking the game up and it not being their thing at 50, saying "eh", then checking online for shortcuts or pay to win. Some people are busy. They keep one foot in the gaming world while kinda existing outside of it. They simply won't care. Likely decent people. They just don't see gaming stuff as a moral quandary.
---
Talked about by bethesda or just talked about by players? 76 was the control vault. it opened you came out. the others were tests fault, most likely failed and are "dungeons" for players to explore.
---
I can directly attest to the scaling factor. I partook of 3 SBQ fights in a row recently, 1st was just 5 or 6 of us over level 100, queen went down in around 10 minutes, 2nd and 3rd we had most of the server there and most were in the 30-60 range, maybe 2-3 over 100 and we couldn't get her down to less then 30%. I wish we could get a definitive answer from the devs on scaling but for now we only have anecdotal evidence which seems to point to this being true.
---
I honestly don't know. I just thought I read that it doesn't matter at that point.
---
I like when randoms come to my camp. They give a wave, have a looksee, thumbs up and take off. Occasionally take pics. 
---
Lock your doors if you don't like people. 
---
Just saw on YouTube someone figured out how to keep doing it on pc but this time the whole server crashes 
---
When is that game not having problems?
---
This has really bothered you having nothing invested in the series or product being discussed. 
---
Seems kinda odd ........................

 Whats your next reddit post gonna be? What a non licensed citizen thinks of the new Tesla???

---
Me niether, but missing is a real possibility with my gauss. 
---
Thanks guys,ya I've heard about the Gauss,haven't seen one yet. If the lever action does better at range then the handmade I might just stick with that and start building up some mods.
---
Just got my first decent drop from the Queen, after sooo many kills and scored a Zealots Gatling Laser with Exploding and 15% reload. Was heaps of fun to use for the 5 minutes until it broke. Straight into the stash unfortunately. 
---
no different from the darkzone in ubisofts the division, or even gta online. its an issue with any game with PvP in an open enviroment.
---
And now you know why being batman is illegal. LET THE WITCH HUNTS BEGIN!
---
As i said if you made it to the end, play how you want to play. This is just a suggestion. My reddit post isn't changing your play style or affecting your game. And i hate lemons.
---
Looks great, just need to make it copyable on google so folks can edit their own copies.
---
That is amazing! I wish Debo would do things like that.
---
Ur right I was wrong edited
---
In my mind's eye, I can see how you'd do this around a corner. Place the line of 3 conduits around the corner of the door, wire them to the switch to that side. Place the interior switch on that wall inside. 
---
Because the shit fills my Youtube and RSS feed, and regardless of not personally being invested in thebseries, it takes place in my favorite industry. Is that not enough?
---
 I dont often speak out about stuff like this on YT. Why not here?
---
Problem, Occifer?
---
You know what, when people ask me what I get after I mine 16 tons, Ammo, a shit ton of ammo
---
Lonnnnng post homy. It was never going to work out when they fight fire with fire.
---
 Anywho this aspect of gaming in whatever form will never go away. Even where they have admins online to police it.
---
Unfortunately they said it was intentional 
---
Being a witchhunter is bad. Witch hunters have false proof. And they attack anyone if leader says nay. 
---
Funny you say this... my wife has a switch and all she does is play Mario games, I even got her Smash assuming she’d play that cuz she knows a vast majority of the roster... she hasn’t touched it at all yet.
---
But she quickly took interest to fo76 when she saw me playing it shortly after launch. She still refuses to play, besides messing around with my character a bit when I’m in the bathroom or something, but she has gotten so tied up in the game and the story behind the last 3 games that she literally will make me put on fallout YouTube videos for her to watch instead of watching tv... it’s great lol. and in top of that, she got into fallout shelter and loves it lol so I’m hoping she learns how to play shooters and creates a character one day.
---
Inferior technology for inferior men. If Eckhart hadn't become leader, the Enclave would've been a dominant force in the region. Then again, the scorchbeasts and the plague wouldn't be in its current form.

maybe install it, see what you need, write it down, uninstall.

I installed some color mods as the light was giving me a headache. Eventually uninstalled feeling uncomfortable before any statements were out for mods.

Think I'm ok.

On PC but it will be a while before I level up to 50 and hunt for legendaries

Thanks!

Game: WARNING: Silo Codes Self Destructing!     
---
A few minutes later....
---
Reddit: We have all codes already.
---
Tell me about it. I miss at least have my shots. And that's a lot for a magazine with only 5 shots in it.
---
Yeah. Games have duping glitches. If I remember duping was a thing way before now. Like I hate how people now wanna take action because the game is crashing cause of duping. Like you need a excuse to go around being a witch hunter and griefing people bases?
---
Bases at whitesprings is frowned on
---
I have no issue with it. It makes you appreciate the 3* items more when you get them.
---
If you are talking about fair PVP, why not disable the legendary effectS? Common weapon for PVP is a reasonable discussion.
---
Sweet!!
---
That was the point. I was equating dup hunters with witch hunters.
---
personally cant complain too much i got lucky and got a couple nice drops that I was able to trade for a nice rifle which my build is tailored around.
---
I have however noticed I am getting  get way too many wooden armor drops as well as Junkie. Got three Junkie guns right after each other once.
---
There are good folk still in the game. Just like in RL I suppose.
---
Unrelated but yung pizza sauce would be a dope rapper name 
---
Doesnt sound like being attacked for duping but being attacked for having a base setup near the golf club, which people also hate and will attack for it being there because then no-one gets xp
---
Sorry its not doing it for you. Personally I love the seclusion. It means I get all the ferraris!
---
I actually managed to get two 3* drops from a nuked Whitesprings runthrough last night.
---
But otherwise, completely frustrating, yes. 
---
Im on xbox. here i'll get a link for what it does.

---
In my experience you have to have pacifist off to do damage to anyone regardless of wanted status, even if they shoot you first.
---
I loaded up my game today, and visually speaking everything looks like it’s running smoother, lines are sharper, shadows more defined etc, idk why, anyone else encounter this?
---
dont you guys have refunds?
---
Finally got the handmade plans tonight at level 158 by doing patrol duty. Took several times to get it, but all is well in the wasteland.
---
I read a theory that it helps to spawn the event if you complete the quest falsely accused. 
---
It couldve been coincidence, but it seemed to help spawn it for me, got the plans after 2nd try (after doing falsely accused).
---
RNGesus is a cruel mistress.

Lord of the Rings Online had a system where you could convert MIDI files to ABC notation, and then play the songs using the ingame instruments.
---
Would be epic if we could somehow do that
---
Yea I know unrelated title sorry about that 
---
And bulk it up
---
uhhhh, isnt posting player names kinda frowned upon even if you think they are cheating?
---
Yes, but then youd have all that conduit tubes exposed on the outside haha. At that point you'd be better off running power from above or below.
---
I have a pressure plate operated powered door that uses conduits and fits discreetly in a 1x1 corridor. But i am rebuilding my camp and might look into experimenting with this.
---
Oh Ok.
---
Cant go digging right now but there was a really sad but cool post from a kid who lost their dad but is now playing his char in F76 as a living memory of him.
---
I usually message people if they wanna farm with me. To be nice.
---
All locations have water and food because you're able to place either of them anywhere on the map. If there's no stream then you have to use a small water purifier.

The stupid teeny tiny 4 poster bed. It looks ridiculously small in game, don't waste your atoms. I later bought the "Fancy bed" plans from Whitesprings and have been using that instead. 
---
“heh, first time?”
---
A team that I can count on and grow with supplement builds with and theory craft with is what a clan provides. If all I want is to beat a mission or the sbq or launch a nuke their are many places to find that. The community is fractured and hesitant to trust. Thinking everyone higher lvl is a griefer or trying to destroy camps. Clans can be a great help in joining together players. Imo of course.
---
It piles up fast, both a blessing and a curse if you use a less common ammo like .44 (at least uncommon early on). 
---
Sounds good :) do you just bruteforce all possible combinations when there's not a single letter revealed yet?
---
👍🍬🍭
---
Dunno it's daytime here
---
It's intentional, but I would rather them make the three star legendaries rare and always drop a three star rather than a one or two. 
---
Yeah, the only reason earning that trophy is okay is if all 20 kills are for bounty related reasons.
---
I think it is. I use WS just for farming legendaries which i don't really need to do anymore.
---
Yeah, setting a camp up at whitesprings is just asking for trouble, sorry.
---
Did you look all the photos in the album? Did you see how the original photos had a ton of conduits and wires, and the second were minimalist? It would be that, but on the side. 
---
What do you place for food?

# Been playing Fo76 with a guy for about a month, almost everyday. We got to know each other in game, casually. He seemed like a nice person, helping me around.Never turned on the mic, only talking by messages - one day I caught him talking using his mic with another player and he sounded like a very young boy. Anyway, sometimes he would give me items , I would give him some too if he asked, absolutely normal behavior. Then one day I found out he had another character just to work as his extra stash. Found it funny, anyway, this isn't how I play the game but not my problem. Then later he asked me to help him find wood scraps, so I did and then he made this glitchy stuff while we were trading  and said he knew a way to duplicate items. You see, I'm not a cheater but I hadn't found ballistic fiber in a long time and all of my armor was broken, so I accepted. I needed ballistic fiber and only asked for that. Didn't feel bad about it, this is the second online game I play in my life, I don't have enough knowledge of how much this could affect the game for others. Anyways, this DUPER had a very high level, 100, I 'm 45. He could barely move, always carrying  too much stuff around, and he really cared about his stash/junk. One day he messaged me saying he found a robot selling rare items, I turned my PS4 on and soon met him at the vendor. I was buying stuff when other two guys with high levels showed up and started to shoot me for no reason. I only play pacifist mode, Im not into PvP, never was. I got away from the trolls but my  'friend' shot them. He had a TSE so the guys died quickly. I fast traveled to another location to finish a mission and called him to help me. He was turning his game off but came back just to help me. That's when the guys he shot before showed up and blew him away, leaving with his junk. He got so pissed at me, like really pissed. He said he was never playing with me again and blocked me. We had been playing almost everyday, messaging and stuff, I know he is a kid but now that I also know he was DUPER . He was a duper that only got in game to sell stuff. I only play because I love the franchising, I love exploring abandoned buildings in the dead land. And I'm trying really hard to team up and make friends, got Discord accounts, got into communities, but it's hard, specially now with those weird trolls lurking everyone, I don't even know how to start. Anyways, I've been attacked a lot of times, a weird guy leveled my CAMP for no reason while yelling he loved me (???). I like the game but I find myself kind of lonely, I want to play with other people, normal people that are just looking for fun and exploring. Sorry for the rant, I haven't played Fo76 for a week now since the day I 'lost' the only friend I had in Appalachia. 
---
Yeah?!? Were you born in a TENT? CLOSE THE DOOR.
---
Who nukes a pop-tart, that's just wrong.
---
I dunno, you sound like you're the one that's bitching and moaning rn
---
Around the map you may run into doing place such as Carrots, watermelons, corn, etc. You can collect these and rather than eating then you can plant them and grow more. 
---
those are probably griefers that are just using current events to hassle other players.
---
Try Vendor Bot Greg in central Grafton, east of the railroad vendor. I found them there after a week of searching the other Responder bots.
---
Good to know. That was the first time I got a machine about that. 
---
I'm sorry you suffered from your experience. Luckily I've only had good and heartwarming encounters with other players, I usually travel around the map where I notice people idling for too long, so assuming they are building a CAMP, I stop by to take a look at their work and usually send them a friend request so they can take a look at mine. It's almost as if I had lived with them all those years inside the vault and just bumped into them again, giving away plans and resources. Also had a nice encounter with 5 other players as we held the elusive Responder vendor bot in Charleston for each other, I'm proud to say I finally got my Hunter's longcoat!! I hope the wasteland shows you it's kind side soon, the Vault 76 family will always be there to look after each other!!
---
Same. Just searched the forum to see if it's just me or if it's a bug. Still happening as of right now
---
I consider marsupial a must for every build
---
To me this sounds like a lot of fun lol great work 
---
Do you have the Carnivore or Herbivore mutation?
---
*Looks back in fear*
---
First we complain about the dupers.
---
Then we complain about the people hunting dupers
---
We've gone full circle, reddit
---
Full auto for me all day , though I am working on a special ops sniper build when i have the time to.
---
War never changes! omg i'm dying! tbh, i hate pvp in this game since it's immensely unbalanced with weapons that one shot against people new to the game with gun that do 50 damage per shot up against another guy with a shotgun that does 800 damage per shot.
---
I believe so
---
I just got done building a visitor's room/porch. It has a bed, stash, cooking station and a water purifier.  All protected by some turrets. I used to have crops out there, but the local wildlife was too much for em. 
---
I just checked it too. You wouldn’t happen to have your camp just uphill from it, would you?
---
Amazing work!!
---
That sounds awesome. I hope you kept shooting his ass like how they did hitler in inglorious basterds 
---
I had taken a little break from FO76 for a couple weeks. Not that I played as much as some - only level 39 on my highest character. But before I didn't really like the multiplayer aspect, but that was okay since most of the time I was mostly left alone (after making my base less conspicuous). But now hearing about people just griefing anyone they arbitrarily suspect of exploiting...
---
And said exploits causing even more crashes than I was getting before and losing some progress...
---
And being PvPed and killed while in pacifist...
---
I think I am gonna take a longer break until they fix the bug/exploits. =/
---
LOL I’ve done 150+ queens and disconnected on maybe 2 or 3. Bluescreened 5 times max. You’re just complaining about something that happened because of your system/internet 
---
Is that farmhouse a Player Camp?
---
It happens in every popular game and it's impossible to actually stop.  This is the same issue that caused Blizzard to bring the real money auction house into Diablo 3.  They understood you can't win so they decided to join in and try and make some money/regulate it.
---
Ok bye
---
You’re making it out to be a much bigger deal then it is.
---
This is the first time I saw this. So who knows.
---
ironic right lol
---
Not if I delete them all first!
---
Then NOBODY gets to sit!
---
So that's what those are for...
---
This happened to me last night. Eyebots everywhere many that were legendary.
---
Lol duping? What proof do you have? I bet my 200+ hours in game begs to differ 
---
Just to update, it’s 11:33 and I can apparently log in so I have no idea why the servers supposedly shut down earlier.
---
Ok
---
This is against tos. Meaning bethesda are legal able to sue against people for this.
---
But I'm not sure how this applies to workshop food output. Are you saying I just need to plant food at my workshops? Is that all the food production icon on the workshop actually means?
---
For real. I walk into every base I see. Get design ideas for my own, scrap my junk and excess weapons, hit up the stash to drop it all off. 
---
If I leveled up and grabbed a new crafting perk I might even upgrade while I'm there.
---
I also play solo so I don't actively use a mic, just some cheap headphones with the mic disabled. Not going to go digging through menus to re-enable it just to ask permission. Especially since most others don't have mics (or are in a party and can't hear me anyways).
---
Around lvl 30(was during beta) it wasn't alone but instead there were 5 (near fissure prime), took a lot of stimpacks, hiding in a shed and melee rushing at ones that were stupid enough to land.
---
You don't know how the code works at all.
---
https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
You put in the keycard you get from the cargo bot, enter the code associated with the silo on the keypad (the codes are available after people figure them out on link provided above) and then use the viewfinder to launch the nuke. Sorry your ignorance made you upset. 
---
The same people who waste 2.5k on a tf2 golden pan.
---
I'll share whatever I can spare. Food. Scrap. Stims. The purifier isn't locked.
---
Some basic manners would be nice, is all I'm sayin'
---
How did he get your gt?
---
This is the funniest thing I have seen in a video game in a long time.  Good stuff
---
Not ironic at all. Just shows that people on the internet will always find something to bitch and moan about
---
I -could- use the fertilizer to be honest.
---
Thats an old code!
---
Strange because the disconnects got worse after the patch that blocked duping 
---
Probably.   But I do think the novelty is wearing off.
---
Yeah there's no other way to get food unless there's a food packaging machine 
---
Agree. I see people complaining constantly about disconnects. I've done well over 100 queen and disconnected less than 5 times total, mostly because we launched all 3 nukes or something. 
---
People just have connections or devices that can't handle the game 
---
R.i.p.
---
My stealth boy i hadnt put on yet was turned into ammo
---
Know your pain
---
Ive definitely seen this after nuking the queen 3 times on the same server. I.e.: get 3 pieces of life saving armor, marine the 1st queen, robot the 2nd, trapper the 3rd.
---
Not sure that explains why I get ultracite explosive MFing vent plans every single time tho! I have more copies of a single plan than the total number of ultracite plans available.
---
i mean, this game came out 2 months ago. i doubt it. 
---
What console you on mate?
---
I’ve triple nuked multiple servers and had no issues (unless the server was already fucked after the first nuke)
---
That's a good idea actually.
---
Leave treasure maps by the door.
---
i am a raider myself. i love pvp and i am a full stealth rifle build since the release of fo76. 
---
They hit the wrong base for sure. but still, i kind if felt disappointed by the idea of duper hunting. cuz i liked it at first, but this encounter just proves to me its bs.
---
Yeah they aren't what they used to be. Just to be clear I'm after "challenges" not "achievements" or "trophies". For the challenge to complete I need to find every single piece of magazine, not just any number but every different issue there is.
---
I saw a post that has a weapon that deals more damage to "humans". Are these the NPCs inside the vaults? 
---
I still had a few rounds left in the magazine and just laid into his corpse as it rag dolled around.
---
I know that not everybody is going to know about this bug, but it’s starting to make me mad how many people are doing this event even though it’s so risky.
---
Joining 
---
They just waltz right in!
---
WALTZ!
---
You have certainly gotten ur monies worth from the game, so very doubtful you would be able to get a refund.
---
Denied
---
It's a rareish reward from events in the Ash Heap.
---
Got one from Breach and Clear.
---
[https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/messiah-ward/screenshot/11286449](Surveying the wasteland for my next victim.)
---
So you played a game for 2 full months and expect a refund? Sounds like you got your money's worth to me. Since you bought it digitally I guess you could contact Microsoft.
---
Yeah I know which is why I am doubtful but they have sold a broken game and what I feel was false advertising and exploiting the consumer which if I am correct is against the law.
---
The annoyance of trying to get your farm on while some dudes got his shack up at nukesprings killing everything and lagging up the spot is enough to make me turn your base into splinters without warning. Be grateful you got a message first. 
---
I’m on PS4. My gamertag is “DanielPradoM” just like here, on Reddit.
---
I couldn’t find a solution to the bug, when I lost it, I kept searching for one, but no platform has this issue fixed yet. What is lost in the bug is lost.
---
Well thank you for the info.
---
If you're on xbox I can buy you one. Theu are wicked cheap and common these days. 
---
https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/messiah-ward/screenshot/11286449
---
I was thinking about doing a guesthouse, yea.
---
how is that false advertisement? is every game you’re disappointed with false advertisement? 
---
I didn’t play it for 2 months i played it for maybe a few weeks off and on at best but stopped playing and waited for it to be fixed which it never got fixed.
---
RIP. That bug has been there since the beta. Many players have lost ammo or armor pieces from not realising at the last second it selected a new item. It does give you a prompt to accept though. Gotta pay *super* close attention.
---
 Adding bioluminescent fluid to the lamp in Path to Enlightenment also does it. 
---
See you when ES6 drops
---
What's the best weapon for fighting a queen? I've been using a Two shot, 90 percent reduced weight, and Explosive mini gun (with best perks). (Thank lord god Jesus for giving me this beast).
---
Don’t be that guy.
---
Does it ? I've heard about this few times but i've never seen definitive evidence of it.
---
if you wait several seconds it'll fix itself.
---
sometimes.
---
What did wherever you bought it from say when you contacted them? I mean, wherever it was has a way you can reach out, probably by email and ask. 
---
If you are on PS4 and would like to give away any good stuff before you go, reach out.
---
Sucks the game didn't work for you but there are other games out there, hope you figure out the refund policy.
---
I play as a Raider as well.
---
My way of playing is more of like a consensual fight though, not griefing. Some folks think there’s no difference but there is. 
---
I usually make friends with somebody, do a couple missions, and then I’ll bring up a PvP challenge and if they’re down we will have at it. If not then I’ll leave the team and go about my adventures. 
---
Most of the time I don’t even take their junk out of respect (that and I don’t really need anything extra)  depending on the circumstances.
---
I just enjoy fighting other players instead of just AI. My hope is that with the implementation of the faction based pvp, that we as Raiders will have a viable reason to play this way, served with a bit of class and finesse. 
---
im not bitching about it. i liked the idea at first. then i became a victim to it and i never even seen a duping video lol let alone meet one. 
---
Although i have no doubts that the weapons i bought could probably have been duped into the market.
---
Which weapom is this??
---
this is the best idea ever
---
It could only be better if you had a bright red lamp mod on. 
---
So it's server based and not client based? Like if I'm constantly getting legendary armor, chances are everyone else is too? 
---
Haven't seen where Bethesda said there would be npc's coming out of the vaults
---
Beth should just disable it. simple.
---
Rifles/ shotguns and pistols, mostly. I haven't made it very far so maybe heavy weapons get more common later on. 
---
I personally use pistols for my main, specifically revolvers. My .44 does slightly less damage than my hunting rifle but faster, much faster with a few mods. Plus it ignores 50% armor, which is nice. 
---
7 Vendors
---
-Raider, Responder, Free States, BOS, Enclave, Watoga, Fancy.
---
Normally I do like this. My camp is centre map. So I go Top of the world (Raider) kill the enemies, take weapons, sell worst money to ratio first. Travel to vault 76 then to Morgantown Station (Responder), sell rest of weapons also excess stuff. Ft to camp. Ft to Harper's Ferry (Free States), kill enemies, sell worst weight to cap ratio 1st. Ft to Watoga Station (Watoga) sell weapons, walk to Super duper mart (BOS) sell weapons or excess. Ft back to camp/ or black water mine. Kill mole miners sell at train station (Fancy/Whitespring), then walk to Whitespring Bunker (Enclave) sell weapons. Done. 1400 caps - 80-100 for travel= 1300caps a day profit
---
And here's a map
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/gG6aCDy
---
I like the one when you’re in first person, you open your Pip-Boy, but you just stare at your forearm because the Your characters model hasn’t loaded in fully.
---
I got a jet pack mod on PS4 I'll sell or trade 
---
“I did no prep work and didn’t follow any of the instructions provided in game and I still couldn’t finish the quest.  I mean I could just accept I’m a moron and try again after preparing properly but I’d rather throw a tanty”
---
Sound about right?
---
You’re the reason they dumb games down and make it so toddlers can finish them
---
Selling a non working game advertising it as working is false advertisement is it not? If you and a mass amount of consumers buy a cell phone but it doesn’t work properly and you can’t call people on it but all the commercials say you can is that false advertising? 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag47y3/does_anyone_have_any_information_about_this/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
that sounds like a fair way to play it out. i will give it a try myself.
---
Oh thanks, yeah, I’m on PS4. It took me, I guess ~100 server hops to the command center
---
Curious what didn't get fixed in your eyes. I've played for over 300 hours and haven't had an issue. Maybe disconnect once a day but that's normal for any online game. 
---
I know the story, yes. I've seen people talk about others coming out of the vaults, but no where that Bethesda has said they will.
---
I wanted to like this game so bad, but it’s a piece of shit. There’s no other word for it. Constant disconnections a million different bugs. Not to mention the unplayable frame rates in nuke zones. It’s trash. 
---
I wouldn't call it griefing I'd call it playing the game
---
Just buy it off another player on the market76 sub. You'll have 1 in less than 30 minutes for around 1k caps 
---
i would like to know also, theres a way to get the words with out them showing? or is it not a legit way
---
Really?
---
I believe so. This theory was derived during nukes, and quasiproven when everyone was getting 2 shots in one server, and literally nonstop cultist daggers and radium rifles in another across the entire team
---
Bos (the best combat armor "material") isn't learnable through scrapping. It is exclusively available from merchants and quests (and maybe world loot?)
---
Was gonna say if you attached the mod itself to your set of power armor you’ll actually learn how to craft it.
---
It’ll cost a bit of flux though I believe.
---
Yeah if your on xbox let me have your stuff
---
Game works fine tho, so thats a major flaw in ur argument there. You have had a bad experience and dont enjoy the game, thats your opinion, can't get refunds on opinions.
---
User name on PS4 is ryanburns003 I found one legit about 2 hours ago
---
Yeah, I understand that, it's still early so the glimmers of hope aren't evident yet, just one of my things wish were more
---
There are some people out there who are willing to have at it for a couple rounds. It’s really fun, and if you lay out some boundaries and play within those lines it could be a lot of fun. 
---
Through my travels I’ve found that those with a sneak amplifier (ninja perk) set with melee and chameleon armor is the most challenging opponent. Big guns and rifles I ain’t too worried about. 
---
A duo tried to do this to me last timed i played. I ignored the request, but they found me any and tried to kill me. Ended up killing them both four times over before they left me alone.
---
it would be nice.
---
My assumption (which has been true so far) is that world loot has a respawn timer of about 24 hours. I've been farming the Harper's ferry handmade and I can only get it once a day. 
---
What's your groups name? If you don't I recommend the " Red Rocket Rockets " or something.
---
I lost my TSE. 50 cal so now I stay far away from that event
---
Same here even my daughter laughed at them, right now using Nuka cola paint. I missed the black bird paint. All I want is black paint with red and yellow flames.
---
Wait. I never knew that causes lag. I just got a small base. with turrets. I never knew the turrets and farming would lag the server. I just kill them then sell the loot to a vendor. No one wasn't annoyed with until now. Do the turrets cause the lag or when I come back and the ghouls respawn cause the lag. I never even did this to make lag. I only do it for loot and xp.
---
What is this bug? I havent heard of it yet. Why are people losing stuff?
---
That's good news.
---
True, a lot of the good sides are shown through the players as well as the darkness of people. 
---
Someone else says they've been able to log in again, so maybe it was an unrelated outage. I'm going to check now.
---
Yeah this is also good, I do this when the situation arises
---
I like my Gauss for sniping. 
---
I think a lot of people dont realize that there is a whole group of senior citizens that actively play games such as this to socialize with others.
---
 To be honest, boiled brains are delicious. Plus they make you feel smarter!
---
can only buy and sell from Raider Vendors, no more Watoga station, no more vendor bot phoenix, no more harpers ferry. no more responder vendors.
---
[This](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/images/31449) would make me wear even Raider PA. 
---
We didn't even think of one, we always play together and the cliffs overlooking red rocket is a nice spot.
---
Why are you whining about it here? This sounds like a question to ask wherever you bought it, not Reddit
---
I dunno, without the Scorched, the BoS would have been able to focus on consolidating their power and resources - and without the urgent need for supplies they could have worked with the Responders and such in a far more peaceful manner.
---
The Enclave would have remained in their bunker and had excellent intelligence resources, but no nukes. Stronger than the BoS? Hard to say. Isolated and without contact with the offshore base, probably not.
---
i could go on hours of pvp without dying once.
---
chameleon is a fun perk and it blends in very well, esp. in dark areas and bushes.
---
Common practice to destroy bases at this locale, sorry to say.
---
Yeah, I get that. My mic'd earpiece is different from my headphones, too
---
I don't mind visitors. Not at all.
---
I knew the senselessness of my complaint when I made it.
---
But I know that there IS some decorum lacking, from the some of the visitors I've had.
---
It's been fun reading these responses.
---
Glorious 
---
If you go on the Looking for Group section of the game app/club, you’ll see tons of posts from people who nuke/sell/etc. 
---
I found one of these! I read just a couple I was missing then passed the rest onto a low level. Thanks stranger
---
The legendary Banhammer Sledge with 100% damage to accounts is the ultimate melee weapon.
---
Thanks for the idea, finally gives a use for them
---
I've seen tons of people tried to get a refund but nope that's impossible. Here's a line founded in their refund policy.
---
"Customers who have downloaded the game are not eligible for a refund." 
---
Unfortunately, once you downloaded the game, you won't be able to get a refund no matter how long you played. I hope this answered your question.
---
Now now, no need to get crazy. I just need to touch the chair a little... I'm gonna put my butt all over that chair!
---
What are the launch codes 
---
did some verification of my own with a friend, i can tank an orbital strike to the face and it does pretty much nothing.
---
whats a mama dolce bug
---
Very interesting
---
Yes, it is better to do that because it will reduce the weight in most cases and consume acid which will also reduce your weight
---
When adding the ingredients to the machine if you are clicking too fast and not paying attention you can accidentally add other items that then become unretrievable.
---
SungWon Cho
---
Awesome, thank you. 
---
I thought that might be it, but op has more than I do. More of everything, really 
---
Welp I'm losing karma. Shame on myself.
---
That's odd, given I have two right here and neither of them do that.
---
https://youtu.be/c_qsqzccTIA
---
Perhaps that's thanks impart to the explosive prefix you have? 
---
During the event, you're meant to add meat chunks (or other ingredients) to the hopper. It's not automatic, it opens your inventory and you have to select and add. It *should* only show you the ingredients, but occasionally it will show ammo or other items from your inventory and they are auto-selected.
---
If you're not paying close attention you could accidebtly accept adding all your 308 or your X-01 leg and there's no way to retrieve it. 
---
Found it today, cant remember where but it was 9500 caps...
---
I'm not seeing some of the armor recipes. Specifically, I knew that my trapper and marine armors have a welded option. This isnt in the same slot as dense or ultralight. So I looked through the Armor, Armor Mods, and even the Plans section for the word Welded and I'm not seeing the Welded recipe or option for Marine armor. I'm looking for it to see what else is available.
---
But maybe I'm not looking on the right tab, or maybe I'm looking for the wrong thing.
---
Help? Anyway, this resources is very cool though. Thanks!
---
The "Lost" emote, I thought my character would pull out a compass or map and look confused, nope it's the follow me animation same goes for the pvp one it's just finger guns. 
---
Just seen the sword whuch does damage against humans. Whats your opinion on that. Do yiu think its a mishap on BGSs behalf
---
plus some ores take 3 per 2 scrap so it drops the weight that much more.
---
I agree. 
---
Make 3* more rare and have them always drop a 3*
---
I have a few rules when I decide to pvp
---
1. Don’t take their loot
---
2. Do not attack their base or pursue if they are in their base
---
3. Do not repeatedly kill them unless they pursue
---
4. No low levels 
---
If only I could do this with the enclave...
---
Woah a 3star legendary with a rifle! This'll be great!
---
Oh. A non-legendary rolling pin. Sick.
---
That Is odd! its likely the explosive legendary but that could mean that the splitter flames are actually at least six different instances of fire.
---
I am that guy. Work 10 hours a day. Have a three year old. Dinner bath story bedtime. And then my 2 whole hours of playtime.
---
2 bucks for a tse versus how many thousand caps i need to farm? 
---
But t60 paint skin is 20ish bucks. 
---
The math checks out. 
---
But i used caps to buy my vampire explosive black powder rifle. Not a tse and not 6k caps.  900 caps and im good. 
---
Thats the difference 
---
Players are humans, so therefore id assume that its one weighted to PVP. Otherwise yeah probably just a mistake, lots of them with other items, like some helmets having DR, most not.
---
depends on how low a level you are talking about. im level 40 and with the right build was able to hold my own fine as long as i kept my bufftatts,psycho and food buffs up 
---
It is a random spawn chance instead of ghouls. Nothing new. Been there since beta.
---
i actually had a similar thought, not like to the ridiculous extent of yours. but making the scorched stronger if you lose and weaker if you win. 
---
Very true. I didnt even account for PvP
---
It’d probably break if it took a fairly hard knock to be honest. It’d look perfect for cosplay though and some people have done some fantastic weathering and paint jobs on them. I saw one guy added leds to light up parts. 
---
Like say you fell and landed on it? It’d crush some parts for sure. But for general wear it’s fine, like not a super delicate thing.
---
I love it man. There were parts that were very hard to put together, the three wires from the face plate need threading through some very tight places and I had to undo a bunch of steps to go back and thread them through. I’d love to buy a second one. It’s a great display piece and I love the first 2 fallouts and it’s obviously designed off the Pip-Boy from them. I doubt anyone would be disappointed 
---
I have a friend with a TSE I gave him, I'll see about maybe asking for it back for a little bit for testing purposes. 
---
Game share with somebody! One mans trash is another mans cap stash!
---
I think a lot of people forget how bad PS2 graphics are.
---
While there may be one or two pieces which could have been done better boot up 3 or New Vegas on your PS3 and FO76 trounces all over them with regards to quality.
---
Plus the fact you can, you know, walk in a straight line for 6km and not have any loading screens while the "pretty" PS2 graphics has stages 100m long. 
---
Does the Path of Enligthment does that too? Woa, I used to that event all the time without nowiing this!
---
&gt;People just have connections or devices that can't handle the game
---
Imagine buying a game for the XBox1/PS4 and then to be told by other players that your system can't handle the game.
---
One time I was there it was a bunch of Protectrons. Not sure what's up with that.
---
On a side note: prime receivers also have good dmg values(I think even better than hardened in some cases? And some weapons only have normal or prime=&gt; prime wins dmg wise) 
---
For *some* weapons prime ammo isn't that expensive, a gatling gun for example: one of the slower firing heavy guns(it instead deals good dmg per shot) but it uses (ultracite) 5mm ammo which is crafted in batches of 100(/200 if ultracite) shots(×1,8 with ammosmith) =&gt; you craft 360 ultracite 5mm shots for the cost of 180 normal 5mm+1pure flux+1ultracite.(not considering super duper)
---
Take it from someone who's built over 55 camps now, it doesn't increase as you level. That is misinformation.
---
Why, it's the Republic of Dave!
---
so early in the game its not intuitive that you can break walls that way.  love it.  your vids are awesome
---
.50cal is a magical ammo.
---
I can enter Whitesprings after a nuke drops, 2500+ rounds in my pack, I walk past the golf club building...
---
 BAM!! fucken empty!!
---
Nek minnit I'm having to use the clunky (albeit amazing) quad ammo double barrel shotgun... YES, 8 rounds from a 2 round reload. 
---
haha when you are wanted, people don't show up on your map. think of it as a penalty
---
you're confused. the recent bans extend to people who have either accessed the debug room and, allegedly, youtubers who disseminate exploits.
---
the reasoning behind the latter is obvious although nobody knows whether it's true. the debug room though, people were hauling items that are unobtainable in game. there's a difference between banning people with something that's literally impossible to get and dupes.
---
no, Bethesda can't track dupes. to be precise, I'm sure they can, but it's more work and money than they can spare. someone would have to comb through literally millions of lines. and then there's room for human error, which would generate a lot more unwanted media attention. the only way to track dupes is if they had the tools implemented beforehand, and even then it might affect innocent bystanders.
---
That is loot you’ve dropped in the past in the paper bags. It turns to what looks like technical data once you’ve left that server 
---
Well if you want an example look at the texturing on the tanks outside the munitions factory. lol
---
Really depends.
---
If your setup gets you crits every second shot I would go medics. But if you dont plan on using vats crits all that often go with vampire.
---
Yeah, that looks like Mothman. He was probably following you for some time.
---
Makes you wonder if nukes should at some point just be taken out of the game and replaced with something that's more "endgame" or an activity that is more interesting to do.
---
Alot of us like it and want it to be fixed tho, the incentive is fun and a few caps lol
---
I usually have to fight them in third person.
---
And it seems like only the level 50 scorchbeasts spam the shit out of that.
---
Look around Twin Lakes. You should be able to place your camp relatively close to the map marker. There's also a few secluded ponds just (and I mean just) southwest of Lucky Hole Mine, in the mountains.
---
He follows you?
---
As most people would say thats something small no really cares for if it was guns then yeah It would be a big deal 
---
And while that went on the dupers were duping, I shared a trick with my buddies that dupe so no more hunting tonight for many. I figured fuck it it is one last hoorah for them. The anchors and dupers are now invisible and duping nice and safe and quiet while no one is the wiser on the server.   
---
The asshole level got to far out of hand to the point what could have been helpful to the community became detrimental. I held things tight and didn't let this one slip out as I was having fun hunting dupers and taking the loot, my friends can dupe all they want they get caught out that is on them.   
---
And no I am not saying duping is good in fact I dislike it, I am saying the griefers/assholes under guise of altruistic motives are worse so I spread a trick around to fool the assholes. I still know what to look for tonight and I will be out stealing shit for a few more hours.   
---
Downvote me, hate me, diss on me, call me names. I tried to help the community and supply info on how to curb duping and the mods took it down, I tried to explain what to look for the mods took it down, and so on. I tried to be ethical for a long time.   
---
Now fuck it, I already know for a fact the other dupe will not be patched.  Bethesda reached out to me to escalate the ticket, little late now when the patch is dropping in 9 hours.   
---
I leave this here for posterity. 
---
So I tested and I survive jumping off a lookout tower with only 1 50% fall immunity item and rank 2 of goat legs.  
---
My best guess, one of the items in that other players test was bugged or maybe goat legs was bugged and was fixed at some point.  
---
But anyway, I'm going to go jump off everything in sight, peace!
---
Beware of the behemoth at twin lakes. It has a definite 100% spawn chance
---
They do but that particular instance was the second time I attacked one and it didn’t even land or stop at all whereas they firs one stopped used the acid attack and landed at least twice 
---

---
Unstable isotope crashes your game if you're using a tesla rifle. The fault lies with the tesla rifle(leads to crashes with several other particle effects aswell) but still....
---
I mean that is just one example. The easiest I can think of to point out directly. The world seems to be a 50/50 shot between AAA graphics and PS1/PS2 textures. That is even on all Ultra settings.
---
Wavy Willard's Waterpark, cups and food containers all scrap to plastic. Mess hall in Fort Defiance and the crazy cat shack are good stops too.
---
Omw!
---
We use nukacrypt to get a list of all possible combinations and then just start attempting them. Longest words first because there are less and it's more commonly a longer word.
---
Sounds like your system not great if you blue screen more then dc
---
How, do you build so much?
---
One hour and 47 minutes. Ish.
---
Also for saving space when you bulk aluminum, and only aluminum, it cuts the item weight in half
---
Watoga highschool is also a good place. Just be careful of the monster mash event if your low level
---
I disagree, but only time will tell.
---
!Remindmebot three weeks
---
That's what I usually do. Guess it's time to stop paying in 3rd person
---
Yeah I used to have my camp right next to it lol
---
Sorry, that was a mistake. The Armor Mods sheet in Excel was filtered, and in the creating of the Google Sheet the rows didn't come through. There should be 355 armor mods. If you are using Excel, just undo the filter on the table. I've updated the original post: fixed the Excel workbook so that table isn't filtered, and re-created the Google Sheet and provided an updated URL. Please use the new URL, Both should now show all 355 armor mods.
---
You'll have to server hop for that
---
There's different encounters with him, it can be a Stalking Mothman or Vengeful as well as a few others. Stalking Mothman trails you at a distance, creepy as hell.
---
I've got a level 30 vampire 38. pipe that i've turned into a bloodsuck critspamming submachine gun. 38 ammo is everywhere and it's my lower level zone weapon of choice. I usually move to my quad combat rifle if I need to auto critspam bigger game.
---
but I've come across this  level 45 three star 10mm pistol that has gives the team heal with every crit, has 10% more damage when aiming and +1 perception (idk what this does tbh)
---
I use the first weapon because I assume it costs less action points for every shot since it's a lower leveled weapon.  Always looking for a reason to replace it but it's just so useful. This Vampiric pipe is probably the most used weapon I have since I face-trade with it alot. 
---
I met a young kid that struggled to make it through the Silo and asked me for him. We get right to the point where you have to protect the robots prepping the launch. 
---
The server kicked him and he cheered me on to keep going. So I went to chug along without him while sharing my progress through party chat. 
---
I made it all the way to the launch code and put my card in. He read me the Bravo code from last week...
---
All good though. I showed him where to find the codes on this subreddit so we get it right next time. We got plans to drop the bomb tomorrow now
---
Even with strange in numbers, you *barely* onehit a lvl 1 radroach (which has like 5 health and no armor).
---
Found that water bug last night as well. If you go around to the other side of the building there is a spiral stair case, and with marsupial jump off the top of said stairs to the building balcony. From there you can walk through the wall and use the water to swim to the roof of the building out of the swimming pool that is on top. 
---
Hanging off the corner of the building is a giant sculpted head you can climb about for some good photo ops.
---
Compound builds are my favorite. The rustic look and exceptional use of terrain makes this feel like an actual town you could find in fallout. Nicely done!
---
Thanks I'll take a look around there now 
---
Not true, have seen a few people on market place offering to make the calibrated shocks for the mats.  Can appear from the same vendor as the mods, just extremely rare
---
Yup, it did. I'm not saying it's an alien, but, you know, it's an alien. ;-)
---
Sneak in. Take the stuff they are duping. Dump it on another server where no one will ever find it.
---
Monorail Elevator for Concrete. Somewhere around 10 bags at the top. I believe that's 70 concrete per run. 
---
Tse handmade is the most overly duped weapon across all platforms. My guess, if the gun wasn't a drop you got. It's a dupe. The irony is "dupe hunter" hunting dupers with duped weapons. Lol. 
---
What level were you? I went through this whole story thinking you weren't in at least PA but you were using Excavator PA and getting smashed?  
---
Have seen a couple people who were offering to make X-01 mods for the required mats, they claimed to buy the recipe from same vendor as the mods 
---
I know your feeling. It’s just how I feel being familiar to Fallout for so long, I mean, they have to make an effort to fix things.
---
I like the high school because there's a chemistry workbench and I can scrap everything I pick up. I'll head to those places though, see how lucrative they are lol
---
It appears at the position you are located when joining a world, nothing to do with bags, dropped loot or leaving.
---
Having select holo tapes in your inventory also causes them to appear on the ground the same way.
---
Yeah this kinda freaked me out because at the time i was only level 10 or so I believe. I knew he existed in the game but I didn't know there were different encounters thats actually pretty cool. I wish I got to see him instead of his smoke though.
---
I think they should allow you to respec for free each time you level.
---
Allowing you to only move one attribute point per level is like only allowing you to move on perk card each time you level.
---
Players should be allowed to change their characters with a minimum of cost. If they allow you to switch perks freely at not cost, you should be able to move your attributes points around with a minimum of cost.
---
To level just to move one point is ridiculous.
---
Players should be able to play with their main and explore all build options. Wanna do a heavy weapons/power armor build and then do a stealth/melee build and then finally do a stealth/sniper build all on one character? No problem! All you need to do is get the perk cards!
---
That reminds me I just had my first pvp experience with a toxic player today. He kept trying to trade with me but I kept refusing to, so he pulled out a 10mm sub and tried to gun me down, but I killed him instead and got all his junk, which he had a whole lot of. Is there an exploit people are using in the trade system? I've heard stories similar to mine, as well as people getting all their stuff taken after trading with a shady player.
---
I have a feeling Bethesda is going to start looking at 
---
“Abnormal” player inventories and start swinging the banhammer.
---
As for dealing with them.
---
While you can’t get any meds or weapons etc you can kill them for the junk. Take said junk, server hop and then drop said junk. 
---
I'll check it out, don't know if I wanna do the event though. Not because I'm a low level, but I'm spec'd into shotguns and I'm currently out of ammo.
---
Agreed. I've been frustrated when the game crashes on me (repeatedly when trying to access a stash box or sell to a vendor), but I just chuckle about it &amp; keep playing.  There are issues, for sure but it's mirr as bad as people make it out to be.  
---
How many hours do you have in the game? If it's more than 30 then I would say no. (Even steam only lets you play a game for two hours for refunds) Also...You ever thought about just not playing for a while?
---
&gt;I got a fat solid black cat too. He’s an American abortion though. 
---
That a breed, or...?
---
Me too I love the past ones but it’s time to acknowledge this game for what it is a rushed attempt at an MMO that has no real hope of being anything. Even if they do somehow fix everything which they won’t there won’t even be a player base left anymore. Especially now with people duping more and more. It’s a shame it has the Fallout name. Imma go play NV or 4 to wash the stink of 76 off. 
---
Is it the one by the sylo Alpha?
---
Level 79.
---
It was the lack of stimpacks and the 75% rad damage.
---
I was completely under-equipped to clear a silo solo.
---
Give it time... 
---
Hey ix805 do you have a photo of the mechanic jumpsuit? Can't seem to find it anywhere
---
The nukes are plenty interesting to do! The process just gets a little tedious. I think rather than remove them they should add more end game activities along side the nukes. Whether it's better nuke locations or content similar to dungeons.
---
Thanks for the warning 
---
When did this start and what were you doing if anything? Did you just log on like that randomly?
---
Sharing what to potentially avoid would make this a real PSA 
---
Assorted Lights
---
If you have proof just report to Beth. You can't really do much in game to them other than being a minor annoyance to them. If the talk is to be believed Beth is using the ban hammer against dupers.. So again, if you can prove it just tell Beth and show your evidence.
---
Yes! I am not crazy! 
---
We got the 'techncial' data coming out our butts, Scribe!
---
Could it be?
---
If the event at the lighthouse near Vault 76 pops up, you can light the lamp at the top and summon the Wise Mothman for an xp bonus. He stays around afterward so you can snap a selfie with him.
---
Had " Asylum Worker Hat Green" for completing Silo.
---
Wooo. More doomsaying speculation Just what the sub needs.
---
It glitches sometimes. I've never seen eyebots but have had Protectrons including four or five three star legendary Protectrons spawn instead of ghouls many times. I have some funny videos of it.
---
Probably not. But definitely a GIAMT hurdle if they ever want to put out another multiplayer title.  Theyll make another single player Fallout title. People will swarm to buy said title. People will bitch about said title. Just another day. Year. Whatever.
---
Hello not wearing power armor, power armor is for pussies I'm a real man.
---
Could it be what?
---
You can always select File-&gt;Make a Copy from your drive menu. However, I've updated the link from /edit to /copy to prompt the user to make a copy on opening. Thanks for the tip!
---
&gt;What is the right way to respond to dupe scenarios?
---
by minding your own business? I'm not gonna say duping isn't an issue that should be addressed, but if your problem with it is that "we work to be where we are and then these guys" then that's just **sad**; you sound like a salty jelly.
---
and before you say it, bar the latest alleged dupe, I can personally confirm that dupers just affect people in the general vicinity and only if the server itself is funky. I know Bethesda said otherwise, but at this point I'd rather believe my limited knowledge than their word. "the pocketed bug is overloading servers", except they remained just as bad before and after.
---
and what exactly is the problem with literally every single one of the """exploits""" you listed? you make it sound like the game should be a police state and we should be wanted for throwing spoiled meat on the floor instead of in the bin.
---
Fark just noticed I have over 2k lol
---
Fair enough!
---
I got mine today we were filing it out over a workshop so I didn't feel too bad, ended with a 260 cap bounty ^^ guys sounded like they were having fun trying to corner me (I'm a 101 at this point and they were originally a 52 with a 60 cap bounty (probably for claiming the workshop))
---
Bulking increases the weight or stays the same for everything but aluminum and lead 
---
Is it a traded item or self found?
---
Sorry if you're in an echo chamber my dude. My entire guild quit the game. 
---
But this is alot of fact, and a bit of educational guessing based off of said fact. Sorry if your triggered 
---
I think only 3 or 4 items can be bulked to save weight.
---
Right? There's literally no reason to think Bethesda is going to stop making Fallout games. Yet people keep crying that thats what's going to happen.
---
I bought it off someone for 3.5k caps. 
---
Ah fellow Gatling user I too use the legendary Gatling gun
---
May your enemies fall to the sound of that glorious weapon.
---
Okay, Important Update!!!!! I will actually be hiding in the fissure prime region, near Watoga. Same process and reward, I will just be hiding in a little tunnel now! 😊
---
Fo4 did extremely well. Maybe they have to let the bad taste of 76 wear off, and give it an attempt. Hopefully.
---
that's exactly what this sub needs. someone to break the hivemind.
---
you damn vegan
---
The first one has been mentioned alot, ur not actually loosing any ammo, its a log entry that isnt supposed to show, its from ur previous firefight, recording how much ammo u used (and was already taken at the time of the firefight).
---
I remember that one.
---
Fun fact, my account is private and is not viewable on that site.
---
Why would the player count be the highest it could be the month before Christmas when we saw tons of new players hit the servers?
---
Using that old data is trash and makes everything else you are saying irrelevant and flawed.
---
Well, if Game stop had it for that price in the States is probably jump on it...
---
why are high levels farming there anyway they dont drop lvl50 loot
---
One kid's trash is another man's treasure. 
---
I've only had one 3 star drop so far and in level 65
---
Holy crap. I've experienced this. I thought it was a fluke. 
---
Do you play FO76 on PC, Xbox, or PS4? (Also don't mind my mess of a post) 
---
So for the first one it's like a reloading thing from what I've seen you don't actually lose any ammo from it
---
Second thing, this is why you always wanna do a bag check, if you've ever seen just a brown bag with 1 spoiled meat in it or something like that, that was probs a bag check item &lt;3 best of luck 
---
I enjoyed 4 myself. And there was still a pretty good size group of community that bashed the hell out of it. So really I just don't see a scenario for any game where the community is happy. Call me a cynic.
---
Nice little trick
---
When you guys decide to drop trade 
---
Drop a single bullet in the bag
---
If the bag does exist just exchange items into the bag without touching the bullet.
---
You're taking a lot from a two sentence comment. Cute that you immedeately break out the insults rather than back your claims up with proof.
---
Sorry you got triggered.
---
You have put a lot of effort in to making this. Very well done mate and thanks for the info.
---
Stay right there the ATFE want a word. 
---
Short answer no.
---
EBgames do this with a lot of 'editioned' games. They always have leftovers, some are returned or just not picked up. They mark them down quickly because selling them after a 2-4 month time period is near impossible.
---
These things dont hold value, like at all. Even editioned consoles end up on the backlog, the only one ive seen that hasnt devalued was the '500 million' edition PS4 Pro and the only ones not used are sitting at ~2,000 dollars, 4x the buying price, but nobody in their right mind would pay a scalper that, so those will rot and get marked down eventually too (greedy scalpers always lose money by pushing a price too high, then having to sell at a loss because they hold on to their stock so long it becomes obsolete).
---
No it’s not the end. It’s a spin off game. It had an absolutely miserable launch, and deserved the heat it got then. But I’m glad I didn’t listen and gave the game a chance come mid December. I haven’t put it down since, and I’ve loved every second. If only more people did that than watch YouTube criticisms. 
---
Fallout 5 will come back all single player come the next gen consoles.

(Props to u/waffle_cop)
---
i mean, the engine is based off a single player game, 
---
knowing their ineptitude, 
---
every person in the game world 
---
is likely in the engine as a singe "character"
---
so ALL active inventory is most likely listed in the ram as a single file, 
---
that gets updated every player interaction , for everyone .  
---
Ah, ok. i have done that. I thought it was just a fluke. Didn't know it was a well known thing to avoid... 
---
Odd, I get most of my ammo from kills. They seem to always have some if they have a gun.
---
You guys are doing God's work.
---
I'd say most people buy games in November. That's the big release time, and its known pretty widely as the biggest time for game sales. 
---
Having a release month at only around a million is a big issue. Other games were easily over 10 million and a fraction of the cost of production. So...trash and irrelevant, or you just using hyperbole?
---
Watoga. You get a nifty super sledge with a unique mod and 2 legendary effects: extra health and reduced weight, making it a nice melee sidearm even for non melee characters.
---
I actually AM a melee build and my curious ass ended up exploring Big Bend in my 20s, instead of turning the hell around and minding my own business I decided to plug ahead and flex on the high level zone, ended up with a level 30 version of it before heading back to continue the story. Now I'm stuck with a Mutants Fireaxe until RNGesus sees fit to bless me with something better. 
---
Just some scrub pulling what little public data is available and twisting it to fit his narrative. 
---
We've gotten decent and killing the queen, averaging 5 minutes no matter how many groupies show up, its been a habit at this point while one of us is running the silo to shoot off msgs to players(xbox) to show up, tag her and hang out. Level compositions of our group is 30-300+, and from the 12 runs we had today they only time we got worried was when our main dps lagged out after we waited an extra 15minutes for some more homies to drop in.  Everyone is useful, even that lvl8 in the prototype hazmat suit can be contributing in ways you or I could not imagine.
---
xbox: Leegatos 
---
I’m quite mad at F76 so i don’t have the patience yet lol
---
Nope
---
yes a random creature spawns in that location by the gazebo often
---
I lost legendary gear before, gear I farmed for weeks. so I don't think it's necessarily Bethesda deleting stuff.
---
Yeah I doubt this group will be an "official" responder clan of sorts, but it certainly is fun to screw around with, I hope. Tried to like infiltrate clans with my friend and try and cause chaos. And I fucking named us two the Cu Cucks Clan
---
I was thinking duped item id clashing. I doubt it though, probably just a bug.
---
doesnt she land when u kill enough troops on the ground? shouldnt that be the focus of everyone?
---
Definitely agree.  I'd also like to second on 2 others that people have brought up.
---
1.  Don't stand or move in front of people who are firing at the queen.  Most have TES weps and you'll most likely get them killed by the backlash on those weps causing them to lose time damaging the Queen.  That ultimately equates to less damage on her overall.
---
2.  When nuking prime, aim the upper left/Northwest portion of the nuke to barely touch prime so that Site Prime is barely in the nuke zone.  This makes it easier for people to get in on the fight and allows the area North/Northwest to be a prime radiation free area to fight her in.  It's nice to make the lower right portion of the map the area to fight in to make it tougher for lowbies to join in but that means it takes people longer to get to that area resulting in less damage overall on the Queen.
---
Wanna buy my copy then?
---
Ugh that sound at the end... I would have started shooting at shadows at that point.
---
Sounds like a personal problem. I don't have disconnects or run into many bugs. I've never had framerate issues with Ultra settings except when I first started and it was in windowed mode.
---
The one that happened to me even showed January at the date, meaning they have models for other months. 
---
Scorched make Lewisburg look like the local chapter of Mensa. 
---
It happens.
---
I hit up lewisburg now as they're a big string of picnic tables in there.
---
I hit up the charlseton fire department too.
---
I come out with 60 plastic and lead on those 2 spots
---
Just going to leave this here in case you would like that info.

Good Morning. I think you just have to go to the Bethesda Launcher and open the list with all games, there you can find Fo1, Fo2, and Tactics. 
---
There’s a mod for that on the nexus
---
Oh sorry man, my bad. It’s simple: I open the Pip and this happens. For me at least it’s practically unavoidable and it forces you to server hop or quit the game. 
---
I'll just save levels and respec to do junk runs
---
Is this from the vending machine that always drops it?   Does that mean the claw can actually lift it out rarely?
---
Good point, I'm also on PC and feel like I'm playing a different game when I browse this sub.  Not a single griefer or problem with other players.
---
Thanks Bot!
---
I've heard that early on you could server hop to farm but in one of the patches they made it so that wouldn't be possible anymore 
---
I played it and didnt watch all the cancer. Didnt and still dont pay attention to those kids. They just make money by being overly critical over stupid things. 
---
But what it boils down to is how many issues the game has, the direction it took, the lack of content, the amount of game breaking issues that are still not fixed and yadda yadda. Sure there are fixes, but most are stupid like being able to bulldoze a stone or changing the amount of 308 that drops, instead of disappearing assets, players being invisible, rampant hacking and glitching, etc
---
Yeah it had to be the rads man. I did it at level 38 in Excavator PA armor. Plasma Grenades wreck and are probably the reason I was able to clear it at that level.
---
After countless failed Queen kills (or Queen insta kills because of dupers), I now only join Queen events with a group of discord friends. I also only launch a nuke when they're online and readily available to join my server (partly because I might disconnect upon nuke launch, common issue).
---
I contacted them through Twitter,  hopefully they can help me out somehow. I just feel so let down from this. 
---
I think just about any type of quest can get you a piece
---
It’s true. I have a granddaddy xbox1 and my husband has a newer one. We have great internet and, gaming side by side, my game crashes 10/1 to my husband. I’m hoping that, after I successfully launch my first nuke, I’ll have earned a console that doesn’t sound like a lawn mower when it powers on. Haha 
---
Ah yeah man, I just found it taking a leisurely play through of the game in Morgantown. I suggest, if anywhere, the responders set up base camp maybe near Flatwoods or Morgantown, seeing as Charlestown is straight up dead due to the Christmas Flood and BoS at Defiance is a no no, along with Pleasant Valley and the damned raiders.
---
yeah, it can. but it's really, *really* unlikely.

There's a nice little lake next to top of the world that has 3 Brahmin most of the time it's to the east

You're looking at old data from one platform and omitting to even consider atom store revenue which is unknown. 
---
What you think about when games sell and what reality is might not be the same. How much experience do you have in game sale statistical analysis? This is conjecture based off incomplete data and really does nobody any good. 
---
There's also nothing new here that wasn't said when that data came out in November... Yet more sales have happened since both of the game and in-game currency.
---
You're very on point with all of those overused buzzwords. Are you some 14 year old fanboy, or a 30 year old basement troll? 
---
Part of me has the fantasy of jumping into a fissure site with it on me, but that involves me grabbing volatile mats, after +600hrs? The last things I want is a ban.
---
This I’ve experienced the same and agree.
---
Changed once we weren’t able to sell throwing knives.
---
( I never had the chance )
---
I have a two shot plasma battling I'm trying to trade off. On PC let me know if you're interested.
---
No joke 
---
My fave is when you log in encumbered and can’t FT out of them, haha
---
they can't. happened before and their response is that they don't have the tools to fix it.
---
No. The dupers are worse. End of. 
---
Where do you find bleached dogwood?
---
They are good if you are planning on playing for like 3 hours just go claim one set up some resources and turrets and come back to it like every hour or so 
---
Yeah no way around that, it has a lot of issues still. I haven’t experienced many myself, except the horrible server stability. That has to be #1 on their list and duping 1a. The frame drops are unbearable. 
---
^ Is correct
---
ya i downloaded both today.
---
Lolwut...yeah bruh, Bethesda is in shambles bc of this .....c’mon, put down the damn koolaid 
---
What was said here about the ammo is correct. Basically when you reload there is a hidden text stream showing the bullets removed from your inventory and added to the gun. When you pick an item from the world that does show a text string after reloading you will see it pop up as well. Check your inventory before "replicating this bug" and you will see no ammo was lost.
---
I think I came across as a low-level leecher the first time I joined an SBQ fight, but it wasn't deliberate. I thought I could just stack Rad-X, but nope, got one hit on her and immediately died from radiation poisoning. Whoops.
---
I'd prefer they fixed the one that deletes your equipment at random.
---
I am on now everybody!!!
---
Hmm I guess that makes sense too since we’d just rejoin a server, drop loot, and then leave. We didn’t move much, or at all from the paper bags we’d drop. Thank you for this update!!
---
I also think this game has gotten more enjoyable with time, I liked it at first, but I stoped playing for a month to give it time, now I like it more than ever, I play it every day now with my friend and his mom, idk what they did, but it’s working.
---
The problem with fallout 76 is they tried way too hard to pump out an mmo
---
I would rather have seen a fallout title with “optional coop”
---
Maximum of 2-4 players 
---
With the option of single player
---
For example the Anthem game that’s coming out soon looks a lot like that.
---
Not bashing Bethesda they just took a big leap of faith with this game.
---
How often does it happen, what platform, anything in particular you are doing before it happens?
---
Server hopping or quitting game to get rid of it is great info for someone who runs into this and worries it is permanent like some other Pip boy glitches can be!
---
Lol.
---
Back it up with actual evidence (or is that one of those overused buzzwords?) or go troll somewhere else kiddo
---
I haven’t seen that one before 🤔
---
Has anyone found Deep Pocket Marine Chest plans? I have the mod and I don’t see it on the list either. 
---
Couldn't agree more with all that.
---
No. Nobody ever gets annoyed at that. *You're the only one*. 
---
IF they didn't give up on that...MMO.... thing....they got going. They won't give up on FO
---
Alot of people are mistaking my post for something else, which is kind of stupid. 
---
I'm not saying it's an awful game that people shouldnt play. I played it until the end of December from launch and really enjoyed it. 
---
I'm simply pointing out the only available numbers for sales, and I'm postulating what it could mean
---
consider yourself lucky. a guy just lost a tse gauss, apparently. I lost chameleon armor.
---
I love 76 but totally agree that PVP is fucked
---
Idk what that first one is, but yea, that sounds like a problem
---
I’ve seen a Yao-guai doing a snooze in a lil cave. He was so peaceful 😍😭[baby bear ](https://imgur.com/gallery/iT1CvbO) 
---
Certain areas do this.  This kept happening on a friends base and soon as he moved it stopped
---
I wish I was you were in ps4
---
Just edited the post, specifying the solution. 
---
As for the times it happened, i don’t play F76 for weeks and just went back today to this. It became unplayable. It also happens just when I start to play, whilst the models and textures are loading.
---
I have gotten it 2 times and i have tried a lot
---
Gratz buddy.  Just finished this myself last night after getting my 20th player killed.  Everyone started murdering everybody when the Queen glitched out and disappeared 15 secs after getting killed.  It was glorious mayhem I tell you what.
---
I’m currently set up on the devils backbone on the bridge next to the lake , nice view and only 8 caps away ( using travelling agent ) from watoga / white springs 
---
This has nothing to do with the new patch, has happened for a while.
---
Obviously I already have the game. 
---
Sure they did.
---
Nope, they DID ban people who used mods to fix the game

Spare melee weapons for the poor
---
AFAIK, the way it works is that [open-world loot has a respawn rate of 24 hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a8sz2o/question_about_open_world_loot_and_server_hopping/ecdetn6/), relative to the person that picked it up. I don't know that's a fact, but it seems to be the case, in my experience. But I haven't played since the day before yesterday, so, well over 24 hours have gone by and all of the plastic is still gone. That, plus the random bodies and meat piles leads me to believe that a player has been there recently. 
---
But I server hopped maybe a dozen times and it's been the case on every server. So either I'm just really unlucky and am going to the high school just after someone else, or something changed with the respawn time. Or maybe there aren't that many servers open, and I'm just respawning into the same few servers that have all been looted.
---
No idea, but it's weird.
---
I have gotten 2 so far in 76.  I did have to try about 100 times to get them. 
---
Did it happen more than once or just once and then you fixed it?
---
If it keeps happening I can see calling it game-breaking but if it only happened once and a log off/on got rid of it that's possibly just a glitchy server you loaded into.
---
Actually mine is a plain Jane short Gatling no TSE weapons at all either
---
Get yourself lvl1-5 hazmat suit from trailer on top of poseidon powerplant. Then build some agility, and perk card that let you enter stealth mode even when you are already in combat. Then you will do 2-3x damage and can oneshot those uglyass assaultrons. And [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBPrSO0w7As&amp;t=6s) you can see, how you can run thru silo. Yeah i had TSE, but now i am doing same thing with 4\* machete or even 3\* knukless (in video i dont use hazmat, i do now, becouse fuck trapper amor).
---
I meant the item itself
---
Actual evidence? Like the only available information on sales? Dude fuck outta here. You're the only one trolling. I post information I found and stated an opinion on what it could mean, and you immediately replied with "oh another doomsayer ah blah".
---
You cant even figure out that you're putting words in my mouth and creating a strawman argument. 
---
I'm not saying the game shouldnt be played or anything else. I didnt say anything in my OP about the actual game. 
---
So if you are going to keep being intellectually dishonest in an attempt to derail the thread into some bullshit about YouTube Esq drama about people hating fallout, then go find another thread to do it in.
---
The value isn’t a set one- it’s 4x your current carry weight

While I agree that the jumping to conclusions vigilante-ing is bad and out of control for many reasons, yes, as some have mentioned, it is definitely widely frowned upon to set up base at Whitesprings (especially behind the Golfclub) and especially with turrets of any kind. Here’s why:
---
When you have your turrets set up, they of course aim for any enemy in the area. Others there to farm don’t even get a chance to tag anything, and worse, they often get caught in the crosshairs - which is miserable if you have missile turrets set up. 
---
So these people are here putting in the effort (or trying to, anyway) to farm the right way.. and you have your turrets here doing it for you. You aren’t making effort, you are hindering others, and ruining the experience for everyone - you included. 
---
(Correct me if I’m wrong folks, but I don’t think turret kills grant XP either, so you only gain the loot this way.)
---
So yes, people do come after camps at Whitesprings.  I never go after people’s stuff EVER, but I finally did just last week because someone set up about 7-9 missile turrets and they were continuously shooting and wrecking the place so bad, there was a ghoul on the clubhouse roof cause the game was spazzing. (There was even a dead scorchbeast nearby.)
---
I hope this explains the situation a bit!
---
I've only managed to play 5 or 6 hours since the patch, but in that time I honestly haven't had a single problem. My fiance on the other hand got booted about once an hour during that time.  I'd mostly just like to know why it effects some people so heavily, and others not at all.
---
Xbox. 
---
Thats not how it works man.
---
Gauss Rifle.
---
Ayyy we're both on Xbox then. 
---
Also, while at Whitespring remember golf balls and pool balls provide plastic. They’re everywhere once you start looking for them.
---
Hey, I think I’m your neighbor just to the south. Pretty sure I saw your nice line of tatos today in the distance through my scope. I’ll stop by sometime. 
---
Besides the YT's already mentioned AverageBaters has some good vids, if you're a fan of crass humor. Gets me splitting a rib every time.
---
I fixed it with my setting TV to 'full' under the format menu. I have a Magnavox flat screen.
---
I'm on now
---
It happened at least 4 times. The “waiting” solution only worked once. And it also happened in other servers. Usually when I start the game and log on a server, as I’ve specified above.
---
It's funny because one-shotting is what people usually complain about. Now I see you're actually upset people just generally hang around in the area.  
---
Something wicked this way whacks.
---
I have just experienced this issue right now. In fact, that's how I've found this thread.  
---
Kinda unpleasant but at a high level, the waves are quite easy. I took the opportunity to farm for weapon mods and I've healed myself with some glowing meat steak that was about to rot in by backpack. In sum, I got a better loot with the broken event than with the loot I could have get by completing it. ;)
---
Jesus christ. Calm down and have a little nap. All you have posted is a rant. No links to where you pulled your numbers from, No official statements. It's your responsibility to back your claims up with solid fact and evidence, not throw insults at anyone who calls you out.

Thanks for clarifying

You could sneak away
---
I have tried unsuccessfully to kill players in power armor that don't subscribe to pvp. I know real griefers can one shot with exploits but that is not an option for me. 
---
So the highest form will have the words 
---
“Superior” on them
---
As for the percentage I’m unsure.
---
Did they request a different item while you were setting the price for something else?
---
It will fuck up the order and set a price on something else if so
---
There is trade confirmation coming in the next patch allegedly... so there is that
---
Can't believe it's still a problem honestly. Hopefully someday they will see this. But I agree farming the endless mobs was a good way to get loot!
---
Is he friendly?!

Here's a link for you then:

I actually have 0 lights almost besides the one above the resource building, street lights, neons, an like one small light in each building. I spam the backlight posters to light stuff  because the white blinding light the light give off drive me nuts. Lights / power connector / food / defense just eat budget. 
---
But Bethesda dont fix the bugs, the community does. The skyrim port to Nintendo switch still has bugs from the original release that have been fixed by the community. Why are you defending bugs? This is the weirdest stance to take
---
Yeah I’ve farmed him for quite a while at Charleston for the coat and got one. 
---
Really? i couldve sworn the x-01 had more.... maybe im mistaken tho, guess its a good thing i kept the ultracite stuff then
---
Okay this is freaking hilarious.
---
Did they change lead? Pretty sure it gets lighter when bulked.
---
What platform? I haven't experienced this on PS4. Last night we spent some time just riding up &amp; jumping down.
---
Oh get over yourself. Try doing that on a college paper and throwing the same kind of pathetic bitchfit.
---
Ah ok thanks 
---
Son, Uncle Sam needs you more than ever.
---
Thanks, I haven't seen this although I have had weird HUD loads where it took a full minute or two to fully load in. I'm on PS4 so am hoping for some improvements from tomorrow's patch for loading and general performance.
---
If it is happening that much I can see how it would get really annoying for things not to load and have to server hop after you just went through the wait.
---
Give us more building space and we will get very creative. ;)
---
Pc thank you 
---
Assorted Lights ^.^
---
Shameless copy and paste from another thread I posted. It's an overpowered melee build that trivialises -every- encounter in the game. As long as they're not flying.
---
 
---
15 Strength, run 3 blocker, 3 slugger, 3 expert slugger, 3 martial arts, 3 incision
---
3 Perception, run 3 Glowsight, other times run 1 green thumb and 2 of your choice. You want green thumb to farm nuke fluxes easily for easy caps (I currently run 2 Glowsight and 1 Greenthumb in nuke zones for a good combo)
---
5 Endurance, run Ironclad 5... during nuke zones for power armor run Sun Kissed (reduce rad damage) and assorted others of your choice.
---
4 Charisma, run Lonewanderer 4. If you're in a group, run Rad Sponge, Inspiration and assorted others of your choice. SHARE the rad-sponge.
---
5 Intelligence, I run Makeshift weapon 5... weapons hardly break. Can keep it at this during Power Armour, or swap it out for longer cores perk etc etc. Remember to swap it out for repair specific perks when you're repairing.
---
15 Agility, Max out action boy/girl, Marathoner, White Knight, The perk that auto uses a stim pack at low health rank 1, Sneak to lose enemies perk, Evasive 3 (+armor non power armour)
---
9 Luck, Blood Mess 2, Starched Genes 2, Class Freak 3
---
Mutations required:
---
Speed demon, Marsupial, Twisted Muscles, Grounded, Carnivore (optional), Healing Factor
---
Benefits of this build:
---
\- Insane melee damage (can easily solo silos and level 65+ Scorchbeasts with a few power attacks)
---
\- Insane health regeneration due to Healing factor
---
\- Can easily reach 300-400+ resist rating at end game without power armor. Blocker 3 and Ironclad 5 makes you a walking tank.
---
\- Huge reservoir of AP for sprinting and power attacking (remember to use Marathoner!)
---
\- Can easily switch to power armour with a few perk card swaps for Nuke Zones or if you think you're in trouble (X01 recommended for rad resist Nuke zones)
---
\- Easy caps nuke zone farmer (farm fluxes) with Green Thumb perk, each flux sells at 10 caps each.
---
\- Can easily regenerate health by running away, then sneaking to lose enemies, which then kick in Healing Factor
---
\- With Makeshift 5 and White Knight 3 , your weapons and armour do not break :)
---
Kill strategy:
---
With high AP reservoir and Speed Demon mutation, rush in and kill everything. Then run away and let Healing Factor mutation restore you to full health in seconds. Rinse and repeat.
---
Cons of the build:
---
\- Melee build. Gun damage is terrible. Sometimes those Scorchbeats like to stay in the air. Shooting down Vertibirds require a gun too.
---
\- Not a meta TSE (two shot explosive) build
---
Try to find yourself an instigating weapon where it does double damage on anything with full health. You literally one shot them.
---
Might want to try to find yourself a +40% power attack and +30% scorched damage weapon to really rip into Scorchbeast Queens.
---
That sounds pretty good. I also mentioned on a different post scorchbeast police following you around and harassing you and if you kill them, they don’t drop anything good. 
---
Because reddit is a college paper. 
---
Would you like a reply in MLA formatting, 12 pt and referenced properly? How many pages do you need?

The burden of proof lies with you. All telling me to "google it" does is weaken your own position. 
---
I always drop in containers, but mostly shit legendaries or plans I or my friends might not need. Yet I get your point just the other day when I was dropping off plans and the like I noticed the plans in the case were together able to make an entire suit of Ultracite PA. Thought to my self well isn't that a huckleberry, I had to grind for my plans and some lucky twerp is gonna hit a honeypot.  All the same I put mine in the case and went about my day.

projectiles fly off in arbitrary ways that sometimes defy logic. specially in VATS.

Dupers in 76 are like synths in Fallout 4. 
---
I totally agree. I would like to see really great fallout props of memorable things but it’s unnecessary to bundle it. I would have liked to see a $200 helmet without electronics so that they could put all the money into making it a bit nicer quality. 
---
Well it might mean like the scorched and mole miners because the game considers them human look at the perk cannibal.
---
Please tell me you took all his super loot and dropped it somewhere he couldn’t find it. 
---
No but I can tell you it seems to proc wep wear per shot, as my double-repaired Prime Gat Laser busts in under a couple of minutes.

Do we get a permaban for using it next week though?

Well hopefully this next patch will help with the “duper’s”

I don't know for sure, because I can't check right now obviously, but I want to say I get ~100-150 plastic just from MTHS. I know it's over 100, though. There's plastic everywhere. Just not at this moment unfortunately.
---
Interesting ideas!
---
I thought when I read the title that you were proposing something I've been thinking of, though: 
---
**More instruments are needed!**
---
Wouldn't you pay 2000 atoms for a really hot saxophone or trumpet? A violin? A xylophone?
---
For me it still completely disables icon sorting tags as of yesterday.
---
 Yup. Happened to me too. On PC.
---
Guess you changed ur mind.  No worries, turns out I had them for t45 already... it was t51b that I needed
---
Ok I’m not alone then lol
---
I usually get a behemoth ir a glowing one 
---
Haha na man. That site did the same thing in the past.
---
But no one mentions psn privacy settings.
---
&gt; the damage output of TSEs invalidates most, if not all, current game content.
---
They knew the issue, we saw that to the indirect nerf to explosives (both TSEs and scorchbeast blasts) caused by the Fireproof perk buff.
---
I have a feeling that future endgame contents will have heavy explosive resistance similar to what we could have now (Fireproof 3 + Dense mod).
---
Yes, but:
---
A bugler would be more lore-friendly in this game. 
---
Hmm I maybe have to test this then
---
I ended making a Gatling gun build
---
Gunsmith rank 5 
---
My luck is at 15 in an attempt to proc luck of the draw as often as possible
---
If I’m missing my shots and spamming isn’t gat breaks abnormally fast.
---
Actually, selling in game items for money in real life violates Bethesda’s terms of service. If they chose to, Bethesda could easily sue the seller for this.
---
I've seen this a few times... 9700 caps. 
---
Currently farming for caps to buy this :)
---
I usually get the glowing boner there.. 
---
I sometimes use vats for close quarters and low flying scorchbeasts, but almost never with a scoped weapon.  I have the vats accuracy handmade that fires about as fast as I can click the mouse, and the armor piercing effect really chunks armored beasts down very fast.
---
Camden Park is great (just south of Nuka Cola plant). Tons of tin cans, scorched for scrapping guns, plastic, two fusion generators for fusion cores, a power armor station with RNG raider armor pieces and chassis and fusion core, plenty of work benches, and vendor there has a chance to sell excavator mods and mod plans. 
---
Tin cans and plastic respawn with each server hop, too, so no worries on waiting until next day.
---
Shame how many times we have said that....
---
Unfortunately he didn't have much on him to drop.  Dupers and pvp cheaters alike have their extra characters tagging along to use as mules/scouts and he had all of his spoils stashed there.
---
I'm on Ps4. Almost every time I try to emote to say hello to other PCs, I accidentally give myself a damned stimpac.
---
The D pad and I don't get along...yet.
---
Im pretty sure any raider armor plans dont exist at all
---
God duper’s are ruining the game. I don’t know why people support them. 
---
This, and repairing anti-air turrets.
---
It was like that for me last night.
---
Im level 365. I use an Explosive Lever Action Rifle. I one shot snipe a wanted player, teleport away. If its got a bounty on it, its fair game. Put them back in their place. 
---
I like to think im a raider-hunting survivalist. If the dangerous people are dead, they arent dangerous.
---
Good!
---
Yeah that's still more than me, I'm wondering if Brick may require more budge that's the only thing I can think of.
---
Nah, but I did have a piece of armor suddenly vanish
---
It will be saved, just not to you. Anyone on that server can show up there, and the workshop you built will be there for your enjoyment.  From my understanding (unless something has changed) it will stay for about a week if untouched.  Technically if you spawned back into that server the work you put in would still be there, you would just have to reclaim it.
---
A good use for caps x price to respec that grows each time you do it. But decays one cost jump each reset.
---
I would love to change my build completey up now and then. But like hell if i am putting time in an alt that could be spent on my lad who i wouldn't leave at all.
---
The first time I launched my nuke, I didn't have the code.
---
It was a player standing next to the keypad telling me the code over the mic. I will forever be grateful to that player (ticbit or something his name was)
---
Ouch about the defending and accidental damage. You're good people. One time two guys went wanted after leaving my camp, I saw it on the map. I wonder if it was a similar situation. I don't lock anything down. You need a with bench and some water? OK, no problem. 
---
Some dude gave me one of these but I didn’t know what it’s significance was so I ate it
---
Only nuke materials work like that (hardened masses, glowing blood, etc) everything else rerolls per person. Thats why it's better to do ghoul spawns in teams, more random items you can swap with the others

The fourth floor of Fort Defiance has a bunch of plastic. Hit up the kitchen area and the pool table. My roommate got 17 bulk plastic by visiting this area often.

Well that's gay

So I can leave them in strange places?

I get 100 plastic on the two golf course greens just south of the Whitespring with golf balls and clubs

Aluminum and Lead are the two I saw numbers for but I never really checked myself. Those were the only two I bundled for a while but now I carry so much and plastic is so abundant I bundle it all when I get the chance.

I can't remember which is which, armor pierce/bleed, but I'm sure this is why I thought something might have changed, just a little oversight on my part.  
---
Same. I'm kinda imagining a cross between the marine armor and the enclave Scout armor
---
This happened to me today my mate told me to come to my base because their stuck in the foundation i fast travveled there an was stuck right next to him. I had to remove the floor then it wouldnt let me place it back down so i had to move the whole base some of the glitches on the game are getting beyond a joke.
---
But have u got untracite explosive vents? 
---
And usually with how floor meshes work you can shoot at people from "under" the mesh and not get shot at yourself. Sadly i think we are seeing the next big exploit
---
I have been wondering, when one gets a bounty 
---
Does the cap bounty get deducted from your characters or it this magically appearing cap money?
---
That's so dope dude, well done.
---
Literally describing your own posts, begone fuccboi.
---
The Bag Shortage of ‘18 was nothing compared to the Heavy Ammo Drought of ‘15.
---
Really? When I was level 50 I feel I had a lot less budget. I'm level 117 now and my camp is actually bigger now, ended up scrapping the original structure and built a larger camp. However I've been monitoring if it does increase as I level up, ever since level 100, and it hasn't as far as I know.
---
You are right my friend, thank you for letting me know btw. This had been bugging me for a while!! I do hope they increase our budgets, so much potential !!
---
That sucks. Part of the reason why I have a few extra weapons I carry around just in case I run out of that said ammo. 
---
First off hopefully you took a screenshot
---
Yes, I think that’s what they must have done. 
---
Very good points. Thanks for the addition.
---
Was in a Harper’s Ferry nuke zone, same thing - eyebots. Including a Level 1 legendary. They all dropped glowing blood, etc. too.
---
Thanks for all the comments! I’m also wondering if there limited items in the shop that will disappear after a while? 
---
Multiple
---
All I really have to say to you is... you're a ass. Now I want to play FO3. XD
---
No, the mobs continuously attack until she is dead. They just spawn in waves.
---
Unless someone physically broke into your house and robbed you of your game, then no, no they didn't. 
---
That fight has been insanely laggy all day. Good luck, I would join ya but I am exhausted.
---
Golf balls are the unsung hero of plastic farming. I'm always shocked that with all the XP/legendary farming at The Whitespring it's in such plentiful supply. Also a few shopping baskets downstairs in the golf club.
---
If only I could do it with https://imgur.com/gallery/C4vS8
---
Ahhh Great, i have been tricked then 
---
It’s a heavy combat armor - I hope Bethesda will fix this ... or is this working as intended...?
---
I once heard that invites could also be to save caps travelling to ppl
---
Yep it will :/ most of luck for you, so you don’t get this trashy bug!
---
Yeah, unfortunately the entire point of the server set up is always spawn you in different servers. But, if you just like building then it's not a total waste when you leave lol.
---
Then again, I could be completely wrong. I'm pretty sure that's how it works though. 
---
Just go into your pip-boy to the data tab. You can unselect them to remove them from the screen, easy peasy
---
In a word? No. 
---
Power Armor is basically like being a walking tank (which it should be). The upkeep costs make sense imo.
---
Do these codes, can I go to a nuke silo and type them in and launch a nuke? Or do I have to find the nuke codes in game. Then I can launch a nuke. 
---
Crouching is not that slow, so people would constantly crouch and fight. It's impossible to target you in VATS wgen you are invisible, so that was done for balancing. It was the same in FO4 too.
---
I'm still hunting for the elusive ivory grips plan, for the single action revolver.
---
Tbh just using power patcher I think the one that’s repairs it 200% is all you need power breaks so slow for me 
---
I'm having this but with the Broken Uplink. 
---
There is sometimes a Broken Uplink at my camp but I can't pick it up.  Mine is still in my inventory. 
---
I wonder if it has something to do with what quest you have active. 
---
Go to the LFG channel on the [official subreddit discord](https://discord.gg/falloutreddit), that's literally 99% of all that's messaged.
---
ummmmm.....sure he probably was dupping but "  a whole page of two shot weapons all different kinds : doesnt really mesh with " Clearly from duping. "
---
After all dupping is creating a duplicate. unless the duplicates somehow roll different effects when they are made.
---
Ive been thinking the same thing, anecdotally it feels like it thats for sure. It the same thing when I go to say the envlave bunker. 3 mods for the X-01 should appear, but only one or two does, and its usually something crappy.
---
yeah the hot fix tanked my fps in whitesprings and other areas, not too fond of it, might not play the game until they can fix it
---
Its a silent killer, just sitting there xD
---
It dropped a level 1 single star item too, FWIW. (Wooden armor piece, auto-stim)
---
Na, I would just forget about the game altogether for a while. Play something else, hang out with your girlfriend, take up basket weaving, whatever. The point is don’t let a game get you this worked up. This isn’t a bad car or house that you have sunk thousands of dollars into, it’s a game that cost you $60. 
---
I have my camp just at the bottom of the green under the rocky cliffs opposite the bunker. I have a set route that I take every day and end up having to bulk plastic to sell because I have too much.
---
Best place to farm is plastic is the crazy cat lady's house, East of VTU and directly North from Bolton Greens. Contains lots of cat bowls, 50-60 every hop.
---
I don't but someone on my server does.
---
I tried walking along the monorail track from where a fallen tree hit it, but once I reached the first support I couldn't jump over it to keep going. Ughhhh.
---
I heard there's concrete up there, and I neeeeeeed iiiiiiiit.
---
It takes from your own caps 
---
I have a TS lever action and bloodied handmade that I can use, with a decent amount of ammo for each. But I'm spec'd into shotgun, so I use that for higher-level areas, because the lever action is too slow (plus I have a scope on it, I should take that off), and the handmade doesn't do a lot of damage as it's a low level I think. 
---
My combat shotgun does a bit more than 250 per shot, lever action does about 230, handmade does like 70.
---
its taken from you money. though I am unsure what happens if the bounty goes over your amount of caps (or if it even can)
---
Yo, report back in the next week. Everyone the first day or too was like "Oh this is pretty awesome". None of them touched the game after day 2/3.
---
Thanks for clarifying, probably why I couldnt quite put my finger on it.
---
There’s also a decontamination shower 
---
So the xbox report function doesn't connect to bethesda at all. Sound obvious reading it outloud, thanks for the link.
---
im in the same situation as you i cant even leave whitesprings without being raped by some ghost 
---
Obviously your puny Xbox1/PS4 needs a upgraded Graphics Card!...right?
---
That would be a micro-nuke
---
When you fast travelled to him did it reduce to a 2500 bounty
---
Some people think they can claim my workshop, maybe... Maybe... I have yet to meet one that can survive my Gatling Plasma
---
What was the code word for alpha?
---
If you punch someone's wall a few times you can get a bounty... even if you only do a little bit of damage. The other time I got a bounty was when I shot a few other things while shooting some Mole-rats while trying to defend someone's camp. I just did it because of the loot/rewards that drop. Ended up not being anything worthwhile but I was in the area. 
---
Can you make the google sheets version not say “recipies”?
---
Thats the other exploit they do, rack up a huge bounty and give all their caps to their friends, thus killing them results in no reward.
---
I suspect you feed on negativity, or just hate the "duper" subject in general, we'll avoid that for now.
---
 Lets start with the definition of exploit:
---
&gt; (in a video game) the use of a bug or flaw in game design to a player’s advantage or to the disadvantage of otherplayers.
---
Being able to poof away from any risk, or speed bump in the game is not how we all are/should playing, if they choose to just disconnect rather than dealing with what's in front of them it should come with consequences. 
---
15k?? Jeez
---
No, it stayed at 5000. I didn’t see his level, but I was 105, so he must have been about the same for it not to go down. 
---
You go into debt and deal less damage in both PVP and PVE 
---
Did same with vault-tec for leather armor. Now i am using leather armor. Metal armor have biggest balistic resistances, not so bad and ppl are throwing it away for cheap.
---
Seems ur ok overall.  Do you use the ammosmith perk as well?
---
Super Rare Plan and Drop
---
Protectors of Bethesda Unite! 
---
Yeah and super duper which is the best
---
Remember progressing story. EVEN IF BGS swears up and down they will never do such and such or they have no intentions of ever doing NPCS etc etc, just remember. Companies backtrack all the time. Biggest example is Blizzard and their view on Vanilla wow. They said they would NEVER do it and here we are in 2019 with them doing it. With how big of a complaint no NPCS is, I have a hard time believing they won't add NPCS
---
I managed to get into dev room which at Raleigh's Bunker. all the items there can't be pick up. I can't interact with the doors there either. All the containers are infinite loading for me.
---
Nasty! Looks just like my current rifle but mine isn’t a legendary sadly. 
---
Is level difference what affects the change in caps when you fast travel?
---
This subreddit is full of autism 
---
seriously? ouch!
---
not at all, just stating facts.
---
and I guess you want Bethesda to disable quicksave/load on Fo4 as well, huh?
---
By wavy willards also check out hemlock holes there's about ten gold balls that give you some plastic too. 
---
SGA right there. 
---
Fps is down a little, areas load faster, stability is better. 🤷‍♂️
---
You can't really grief in this game since you can literally just block people in your session and change servers whenever you like.
---
Give them to the noobs. 
---
You’re the Robin Hood of Dupers 
---
Schrodingers Ammo
---
Nope, FDA.   Laser pointers are controlled by the FDA because decades ago the only lasers were surgical ones, and government agencies never give up power once they have it so the FDA has kept it, making the safety rules for laser pointers and Blueray DVD players.
---
But does it turn down the squeaking sound effect when moving in first person?
---
Same reason people go to wal mart. It’s more convenient. They are a horrible company but damn so cheap in there.
---
https://youtu.be/0cVlTeIATBs
---
Guarantee you accidently scrapped or dropped it.
---
Even with professional drinker? 
---
Shotgun was my most used weapon in fallout 4. This time around I’ve been trying to broaden my scope.  
---
Happens to me too. Place a small cooking station, the little black pot one, right outside the area you glitch into. The animation will pull you out of the walls
---
maybe give them to the lower levels or put them in random containers , if you don’t want to give out duped stuff then just drop it somewhere where it won’t be found 
---
No, don't distribute them. They're items that shouldn't exist.
---
Drop em in a river and jump servers.
---
&gt;Or if anyone has another idea
---
Here's a crazy one: use the search function rather than start thread #500 about it?
---
People who don’t want to waste countless hours if not days grinding the same area / enemies in hope for a weapon drop.  I bought a TSE lever rifle for $2. Now I can continue on my way with questing and doing dumb shit. Without having to waste a ridiculous amount of time farming something.
---
Nope. What you saw was dupers pretending to have plans but actually thousands of duped mods they can just slap on your PA. 
---
Or you’re confusing X-01 with ultracite.
---
Let me add. In a group of 3 friends, all with 1060 i7s or above, we've had no problems pre patch. The problem come post patch and the fanboys can reign in the superiority of their systems all they want, but truth is that the game is unplayable in its current state. Bethesda needs to fix it. Have you tried to ride the elevator to the top of the monorail? Broken post patch. Game is worst off then when it began. 
---
I mean, they posted an image of them being able to do it, and the required materials? 
---
Ah yes, the American abortion house cat, it is said that they only appear when a fresh can of placenta is cracked open
---
Really glad to see this, Been pushing a similar theory,[ part of it is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ab9i2i/bugs_observed_issues_list_including_multiple/).  
---
I want to add a caveat..
---
There seems to be either an account or character modification to the "Table", "Seed", or whatever they are using.
---
I've runs some tests, in as a controlled fashion as I can, and some people who are without question "luckier" than others..  
---
**Examples**:  
---
Person A uses 30 in the same spot and gets 12 - 16 unique power armor plans (no servos)..
---
Person B uses 50 in the same spot, gets all Tier 1 - 3 plans, with 6 motion assist servos and no other PA plans.
---
Person A, nearly every WhiteSprings run they loot close to or more than a dozen two shots, with a record of 6 TSE's in one WhiteSprings run, but until they quit out of Boredom (well when you loot God roll after God roll) they got atleast 2 or 3 every time..  
---
Person B has the inverse that seem to consistently loot 1* &amp; 2*'s off the same legendary NPCs person A looted a 3* from..  
---
Keep getting told it's bull, and having trouble getting traction, but there is a seed / table / something and when I loot 8 Anti-Armor 1* weapons in a row, it can't be just dump luck.
---
But apparently that work with bobbleheads - difference is it counts when use, while magazines count on-pickup.
---
I tested a level 35 explosive lever rifle I found. Without Demolition Expert, it did more than twice as much damage to Watoga robots as a plain level 35 lever rifle. My guess is that for most weapons it adds explosive damage equal to the bullet damage. Shotguns may be different though.
---
This was my first thought too but wasn’t sure about giving out duped items as they aren’t meant to be had 
---
Unless you have insider knowledge then this is mere speculation.
---
Yep, same with paper bag or even from random containers...
---
You can build fast travel mats for workshops, but not for our camp for some reason 
---
Thanks for the answer! But is FO1/2 on the PS store for PlayStation?
---
Kamikaze into a fissure
---
someone compared an explosive combat shotgun to a regular one and the explosive damage is roughly 16.
---
but it's odd because a two-shot variant, which adds a single pellet, deals a lot more damage than it should, at least according to the tooltip.
---
I've also noticed that energy weapons have pitiful explosive damage, definitely a lot less than the alleged 16. and making them auto further decreases the damage.
---
Every other edition of fallout took me some time to adjust.
---
This one wasn't different but it's a really fun game.
---
Can you link the post?
---
Maybe dev room? Or again, confusing X with ultracite. You can’t get plans for it. At least not yet.
---
see if you can dehydrate yourself to death by spamming them on a hotkey
---
...obviously?
---
PS4 sorry
---
I'm down, send me an invite!
---
I guess it is what it is, you can dispose of it but distributing evenly among low levels wouldn’t be a bad idea IMO. 
---
Bro you gonna get soooooo banned very shortly lol...
---
 We out here duping post more than legendaries. 
---
Well enjoy ur ban then, if u really did get into the dev room, then uve been flagged.
---
I agree and this is why I hesitated to go directly to giving them out
---
Pretty easy imo. You brought the game now play it.
---
Up to you and your conscious to decide hence forth.
---
Flame on, brother. Flame on!
---
I don't care if a dupers feelings get hurt.
---
Inb4 banned. Seriously though they banned some accounts for going into the dev room using console commands.  Unless you got in some other way that account will probably be banned
---
I got mine from R &amp; G station after buying and unlocking each level while server hoping
---
did this for all underarmour's except BOS
---
I was there! :D
---
I'll put a nice sofa near the fireplace, just for you.
---
Its fine I've already transferred all the items to my main account. Its untraceable at that point. 
---
Probably 40% for superior, 20% for improved. The numbers worked, and someone found it in the game data anyway.
---
I found that if you can't place your building at a new location and it automatically is in storage, the game won't let you build another one because your budget is nearly maxed out. The only way around it is to delete everything you had before and start again. It's annoying. If you blueprint the original one you can just rebuild it easily from the scrapped materials. If you didn't blue-print, there's nothing left to go from. It's not a massive problem. More an inconvenience that the system doesn't work as intended. It's easy to build a new one anyway, though. Annoying if you have plants and water purifiers etc, though.  
---
Yes, I'm 95 and found one few days ago in Harpers Ferry vendor. RNG...
---
I need to collect a lot of chinese propaganda posters. Fast. Where has the most?
---
Or let us merge C.A.M.Ps with our friends to actualy make a town
---
They do. I found someone that could craft light raider arms and learned all the remaining mods from scrapping (had three left before that). I think they are exceeding rare since the levelled list they are on isn't used many places, but they do drop.
---
Nothings friendly in the wasteland.
---
Leave it on the ground and quit server...
---
14 is the maximum capacity, you need to empty and it will make more
---
yes ive bought calibrated shocks im 200+
---
I’ve gotten 1 out of like 30 tries. My luck is at 5 but I don’t know if that effects the success rate. 
---
No matter how you got there you will be banned. There's been multiple cases in which people have been banned for just entering the room. Some say theres a flag associated with your account.
---
Look atnhis profile. Dude is playing on ps4 and getting blue screened. Lol
---
Just use something to hide behind or strafe. Mutations help considerably.
---
No only on the bethesda Launcher, they haven‘t reworked the old games so basically you have to own at least a shitty Laptop to use the „gift“ of bethesda.... luckily i already bought these 3 games last summer -.-
---
Havent been banned yet. But I'll update on this thread if anything happens.
---
considering lucky break is meh compared to white knight/power patcher. I personally wouldn't care though, considering I only use PA in nuke zones I think I've repaired my ultracite armour once since obtaining it months ago
---
There are a lot of fake listing with fake buyers trying to lure people in so just because they might have sold something doesnt mean someone actually bought it :P
---
If your build is centered in low HP, then yes nerd rage is good.
---
I know it’ll make more, and I know I’ve had it pop up to 19 on a couple random openings kinda stupid to be honest make it fill to the max hourly amount
---
Does all include Casual?  I’m stuck on even getting the third plan in that line let alone a 4th
---
Nah its OP without something like AP drain to balance it.
---
it astonishes me that people here care so much about duping that they genuinely perceive these items as "things that shouldn't exist", almost as if they were an offense to life itself. it's childish to say the least.
---
regardless, diluted stimpaks are just a byproduct of xp exploiting. dupe stimpaks and water, craft diluted stimpaks, free xp. he never intended on keeping them anyhow.
---
What time can you get online? I can propably arrange a quick trade today.
---
How uh "hardcore" are you all taking this? T-60 armor only? How about laser weapons?
---
Does “All” include casual?  I’m stuck on the third recipe in that line let alone the 4th 
---
I got Calibrated Shocks for the Excavator twice at Camden Park.
---
I do believe the luck skill plays a big part in personal loot grabs. My "what the nuts was I doing..?" First character has a 15 luck on him and pulls more 2/3 stars than my main with 6 luck.
---
I've also heard a team member mention you need to let legendaries regain their health to get the appropriate star off of them. Ie 3 star glowing ghoul killed instantly would have a lower chance of gereating 3 star gear as opposed to a 3 star ghoul that was allowed to Regen.
---
I tested is and I'd be willing to say, in the words of our Lord and savior Adam Savage " myth busted", but I would need more solo nukes and better loot tracking to crunch numbers before I say for sure.
---
Odd. I’ve got a bloodied explosive western revolver. It does something like 600 damage at low health. Shooting it at the ground next to me doesn’t seem to deliver that amount of harm to me. 
---
How much did your laser says it does per hit without the exp?
---
lol ofc they ban the account, anyone saying otherwise is a dumbass. In no way would they just take away your character like your being a whiny kid and your mom takes away your favorite toy xD 
---
Just think a little..
---
In a single player game, you can be an omnipotent quicksave god that romances every npc/creature you want, when it comes to multiplayer we need some semblance of normalcy/ that we exist in the same world.
---
If I contest a workshop and things go south, I should die... If I disconnect I deprive the other player the satisfaction of the win/kill. It's an ecosystem of gives and takes.
---
9:00pm for me. 
---
This is such a great Shitpost. I'm worried that everyone here is going to take you seriously, though.
---
please do. with as much detailed info as you can. I'm very interested in the banning process on Beth's end.
---
Thank you 
---
Just ban and sue them for all the money they've made, simple. 
---
Or actually, take all they have, put their sorry candyasses on the street xD
---
I thought this was patched with the last PC patch? and was causing elevators to stuff up instead
---
I have never seen more than 14 ever myself and I know someone else also asked a while ago and 14 was the answer.
---
wait several seconds and it should fix itself, maybe. if it doesn't, just quit the game.
---
Try to choose what weapons you should use and make a build around them.
---
Establish a camp
---
Beware those with explosive shotguns (Duping has been happening but is getting patched tomorrow)
---
Get a lot of scrap for the future.
---
Explore the Green Area, then the black area.
---
Welcome to the Fallout.
---
Still happens, happened 3 times today
---
I personally haven't tried. I only completed organic solutions a few days back. I'm one of those who have just wandered around until level 50 before following the main quest line. I just remembered seeing this post .
---
True.  I keep 90+ on me.
---
Sorry for the typo in the name of the file. Fixed!
---
I don't think "luck" plays a factor, Forgot to add that.  
---
When I started tracking and compliment,  "person B" with a luck of 15 base, and person A has 5 or less..
---
So unless it's an inverse relationship with luck..
---
What a story man! I've never encountered a properly toxic or high level player (or both) and I'd like to keep it that way for some time. Those people really are ruining the game.
---
I personally won't go down to do Scorched Earth unless the blast is situated so either Drop site V9 or Forward Station Delta are out of the zone.  I don't use power armor and I'm a glass cannon with just a hazmat suit on.  I can also either crouch on top of the shack or trailer and stay invisible while focusing on the queen exclusively.  Flying or grounded doesn't matter, but I will help with trash cleanup periodically to get my adrenaline perk up for better damage while she's grounded.  The shack at V9 is so good because you can overlook the entire battle and easily pick off the scorched.  If I see a good launch, my camp is very close to Blackwater Mine, so I'll rad myself down to 20% while the timer is going, fast travel with time to spare, perch myself on the trailer or shack and get to work.  If I can avoid a danger warning, I can probably get close to 2000 damage a hit.
---
I'm not mad at players less than lvl 40 joining in.  I don't think I participated in a Scorched Earth until at least lvl 70, and I didn't even know how to turn on passive mode at that point.  You have to learn somehow, and there's no better teacher than experience.
---
Most people actually listen if you start calling out direction over area chat.  (I almost always do Scorched Earth as a solo participant)  It makes a massive difference.  Of course some players might have player audio turned off, but even if you can get 50% of the gang to coordinate in some way it helps.  I can usually see the entire battle (minus whatever is behind the queen) from my overwatch point, and I'll start asking people by name to focus in on the queen exclusively when she's down and I'll clear trash off them because it boosts my damage.  I'll also call people out for looting and not contributing because I can see what everyone is doing when the queen is down.  I just keep my gun pointed at the queen (she tends to stay still) and press my mouse as quickly as possible in hipfire mode while glancing around to see if anyone is getting swarmed or looting.  I'm not trying to be a bossy dickhead or let people clear themselves of annoyances, but if someone is clearly clueless or being outrageously antisocial, I'll remark on it.  I do get a bit more aggressive if the timer is less than 10 minutes and she's not on her last health regen.
---
I think the funniest time was calling out some reasonably high level player (100+) for looting corpses while the queen was down.  I said something along the lines of "hey playerx, if you're that hard up for glue and meat you can grab all you want from my bag when we finish.  There's a f\*\*king 20' tall dragon a few yards away from you that needs to be killed in 20 minutes and you might want to prioritize tasks better"  This was before push to talk and I got a lot of chuckles.
---
Which means all these type of posts are rubbish 
---
Some rooms require you to relog, at least with my method. You would get the items to spawn after relog. I stole all of the loot in the developer room and transferred it quickly onto my main account before account suspension. Hopefully others did the samething. 
---
LMFAO you can check my posting history in both the market subs for 76 it's fairly obvious I'm any but a duper
---
You have a strange idea of what's useful or not. Carry on then. 
---
How is that even possible?
---
Items are dropped in a lunchbag.
---
so they introduced a new bug without fixing the old one? yay
---
I'm stumped and cant seem to get the Somerset Special. Am I doing something wrong?
---
yeah hopped watoga station for it
---
got my marine from hopping phoenix
---
Yes. It goes down to 12% and late game chems are in over supply
---
I found one in the wild today, &gt;!on the roof at West-Tec!&lt;, perfectly preserved despite two decades exposed to the elements. I wasn't game to eat it.
---
Yes or this. :D
---
The biggest problem I've run into is no one wants to track 3 hours worth of WhiteSpings drops more than once a (besides me) which makes it a challenge, and the only "good" ways I can think to test this is...  
---
-Vendor Hops:  
---
Little tricker with some of the recent instability, but I've gathered some data on rare mods and plans
---
-Treasure maps:
---
Allot of people are unduly afraid of bugging their accounts.. Go at a reasonable pace and nothing bad will happen..
---
-WhiteSprings:
---
But who wants to keep track of the 170 Legendaries farmed per person over a group of 4?
---
Well what’s the goods? At least drop some knowledge on us.
---
Not speaking about this situation specifically but in others people view duped items like TSE weapons in that way because of the way it effects the in game economy and trading. 
---
I had 6 in two hours just a bit ago. Also on Xbox. Dupers be going nuts right now. 
---
Have you gone into this thread and read what other people are saying about crashes and disconnects, as well as the replies to the Bethesda and Fallout Twitter accounts?  It's pretty much across the board, which is why Bethesda have stated that they are addressing server stability in the latest patch. I have spoken to a PC player who said he's getting only one crash a day but the console players are having the same issue I am, pretty much across the board. I can get a couple of hours' play without a crash or disconnect on the XBox 1X and the PS4 Pro, but that's all. The difference is the PS4 Pro doesn't make the horrendous noise that the XBox does when it crashes. Note: Both of these consoles are only a couple of months old - one owner.  
---
Thanks for the info! We havnt got to the camp aspect just yet but plan to soon just scoping out areas to start one at for now
---
How much?  I might be able to take you up on that
---
I've seen your vid too man. Aye!
---
I had no idea it was so rare, just casually mentioned I had it and a friend who immediately commenced 40 questions to which I could only reply “idk, I pressed the button and it worked..”
---
Serendipity is a good idea. Dodgy is also good if you have ap to to spare. Emergency protocol mod if using power armor.
---
I’ll do you one better, make a circle of them around the max possible build circle, we could hear it no matter what direction we came, the sound follows us, please help
---
Probably the best guide I've seen. Tbh I've been robbing the motel and fire department but this will save me alot of time. Was sick of waiting on breach and clear events. And the acid drops, good look.
---
Happy cake day 
---
&gt;If I disconnect I deprive the other player the satisfaction of the win/kill.
---
so that's the problem, that's your reasoning? wow, I guess I hit the mark when I said you were just jelly. that's petty as hell man. if at least you said "they're costing me caps", but no, you doubled down on "because it makes my penis feel funny"
---
and I went into this discussion before, Fo76 is hardly multiplayer in the standard sense. sure it's online, but interaction is extremely limited and 99% optional. and people lose stuff by disconnecting, too. specially in a workshop.
---
Wouldn't this be considered copyright infringement? If the dupers are making real-world profit off someone else's copyrighted creation wouldn't that already be illegal?
---
You say that like you don't have a jetpack.
---
It's a good thing they care. It means that there are still some people with morals and a sense of fair play in both FO76 and the wider gaming community. 
---
If it “fixed” everything then I’d imagine that repair all button would become a problem.  Spending same amount of resources to fix a 1/100 condition Reactor as it is to fix a 99/100 condition one like with weapons and armor.
---
That pretty well mirrors my own adventures, except for the Mothman... I swear he has a hard on for me! I've had all flavors of Mothman, the most recent was "Avenging Mothman". He STALKED me, though a pass and jumped me from behind while I was sightseeing...I took him out but it was tougher than my previous encounters with him.
---
I'd really like another shot at the alien...my first, and only so far, encounter was up north near the crosshair and I took a head shot from sneak and *POOF* ...just gone. 
---
Nooe. Look at your rhetoric man, you have an agenda. You arent biased at all hey?
---
How does he have his mules tag along? Wouldn’t that mean he would need an actual human player to be on those separate accounts? 
---
this game will probably be just like ES online where it had a small but loyal fanbase until new content and bug fixes were added and then the game will attract a wave of new players and end up being considered one of the best in its genre
---
ES online is a perfect example of this
---
Agreed, I had no bugs or issues I noticed, and as with everything like this it's the vocal minority that's the loudest. They make it seem like huge issues but in reality they are a very small part of the players having issues but we dont make post upon post about how well the game is running etc. so that doesn't get noticed :P
---
You do not need in game codes. You do need a keycard though.
---
Had it a few times. Just close it wait a bit and re open. 
---
&gt; The game put the GP right back into my hands 
---
I had that happen with a Grognak's axe while fighting SBQ.  I think every other weapon on me was broken, too, at that point.  I wonder if that has anything to do with it.
---
Yeah, it's really confusing, especially when you try to kill someone with a bounty on his head and you get fined if he wins and kills you. I would like to understand this too.
---
Each day I jump back onto reddit to check up on the state of the game, there's yet another behavior/issue that continues to keep me from returning to play after a 6 week hiatus... sigh... 
---
Yeah, sorry, my camera crew was off that day. Still a true story. If I was gonna dupe a weapon or spring for a duped one it wouldn't be this one. Or the 2shot sniper combat rifle I got that refuses to hit in vats. Fucking pos gun.
---
I also heard stability was better for some people.
---
Vault-Tec has it hard baked into the coding to not be able to bomb the vault directly. Their tendrils were at ever level. Hell, you find out in the bunker that it was mostly Vault-Tec that built it and it was unnerving how much they happened to know.
---
All crates are labeled Vault Tec.
---
I'd imagine it's not as cut and dry as we think. IT'S ALLLL VAULT TEC MAN
---
The wasteland is supposed to be a harsh place where you can't trust anyone. What game did you think you were playing? 
---
People put all their caps on an Alt so they can rack up a huge bounty. Or they have a friend collect it
---
Fo76 is hardly multiplayer-focused, though. its existence doesn't justify a market. so it's kinda irrelevant, really.
---
not to mention these people are just salty 99% of the time. oh, now you can't sell your crappy explosive for 25K caps? screw people who can't farm all day long, right?
---
I like it.
---
It also doesnt help that this is duping on a game engine people have been working with for the past 17 or so years. They even know they can't be tracked all that well because you can just use Xedit and see that there is no unique id system in place like WoW has for gold and multistack items.
---
At this point its too little too late. Game economy is never going to truly recover.
---
it's mostly just here, though. on reddit. funny.
---
Personally I love FO76. But none of my friends do. And I just don’t see why. They won’t even give it a try. Yea, the glitches get annoying but once you find that sweet spot it’s an amazing game!
---
“I read on the internet that our games have had a few bugs..”
---
It's because of the "fix" so you can no longer spawn in geometry after fast traveling. The fix is bugged so it causes some entry points like that to spawn you in the wrong location. I'm sure it will be fixed soon.
---
You've been marked.
---
Too true :/
---
The blue frogs are hilarious. I get a lot of animal visitors at my CAMP. I don't know if this is because I'm near the river. It's good. 
---
An agenda? 
---
You're paranoid my dude. I just thought it was interesting. Was looking to see how much fo76 netted thus far, and couldn't find anything substantial. Found this article, and these lines I quoted and thought it was interesting. 
---
It's all the fanboys and people who are vehemently opposed to anyone saying anything that could be considered negative that have an agenda. 
---
I'm not one of the people saying it's an abhorrant failure that will never be good, I'm just saying hey, the numbers are really, really low, and asking what could this possibly mean for the future? 
---
Instead of having productive conversation about like, DLC or maybe in game purchases or whatever else, most people just want to yell about "oh this is bs and you're bs and I love fo76 blah blah blah".
---
Its stupidity really. I played alot, and have a character who's level 80ish. So I'm someone with a very good level of experience with the game. And I've played fallout since the first game so I have the same level of experience with the whole series. 
---
So...what agenda do I have? You tell me, since you know apparently. 
---
Btw what platform?
---
Okay, I'll concede that was a "grunt" reaction from me, but I think that as programmers, we should put ourselves in other's shoes more frequently, and I'm talkling about the poor souls that I'm sure are struggling with FO4 launch and updates, making their best to figure out and fix the stream of sh\*t some people are throwing to the servers trying to cheat, even if they anticipated a lot of things in this regard -being able to monitor, log, test, etc-. 
---
Damn does tricentennial edition count?
---
The bots right outside Vault 76
---
Thanks I really like this build
---
Yeah I could see that. That's been my main thought. Played eso on launch and it was laughable at best haha. All the gold farmers camped on that jute. 
---
Yeah I hope given time and effort that fo76 can be crafted into something even half the size of eso.
---
I also have this bug.  Blank screen and you can't lower the pip boy... I've quit and reopened 3 times, revalidated the game files... I don't know if all of this is necessary, but I ran to a vendor and once I made a trade with it, I could reaccess my pip boy properly.  
---
That's what he means tho.
---
Bags full of Chinese propaganda
---
it’s the reason i was throwing dozens of stimpaks away because of their weight when there was no one to give them to. kept piling up in my inventory, had up to 80 at a time with me because i didnt need them when i would just heal with the mutation
---
He's a rare sight for me. Saw him for the second time since launch the other day.
---
I always go to Misc to unload the canisters, after so many people have lost stuff. They should just make it where it auto unloads the canisters without opening up the inventory screen. Like the Forbidden Knowledge quest.
---
Ps4
---
Yep! I saw him too just before I logged out.  He was battling some glowing ones left over from the buke event.
---
Damn tofu burgers hiding amongst the real meat tricking people into becoming vegetarians 
---
You can respec one stat each level after 50
---
Pipboy damage numbers are just doubled compared to a non-explosive, so 121 vs 243 here.
---
I did try shooting the ground a bit. Does 95 hp per shot with no armor, 25 with no (padded) torso and 0 with full armor, which is not what I expected at all. Still does limb damage, but it doesn't reduce hp.
---
Seeing a massive decrease in stability since last weeks patch (and know quite a few others in the same boat).... Also lost about 15 FPS on average...
---
The weird thing is it seems to have cleared up the instability for a **TON** of people but introduced it in others to a massive degree (I saw 9 CTD's in about 40 minutes last night)
---
Same, and seeing huge drop in stability overall 
---
LOL.  At least it's just amusing and annoying and not directly harmful to others.  
---
If the siren attracted endless enemy waves until it was destroyed, I would do this all the time at Bog Town to farm legendaries.  It would be a hell of a lot more interesting than running around Watoga killing harmless protectrons or frantically trying to get contact damage on everything in the Whitesprings golf club.
---
Look man. I am not fond of dupers. But I am a looter if I see a bag and no one is shooting me for approaching I go through it. Sometimes I even ask for a team invite. Because of this I got shot and killed by a so called vigilante who then took all the items and hopped servers then had the gall to gloat. I was just trying to look for ammo and stimpaks. It isn't like the bags are marked dupers bag. 
---
You're welcome. ;)
---
&gt;give caps to friends so killing then gets no reward
---
And 
---
&gt;they go into debt 
---
&gt; have a friend collect 
---
All contradict - have they patched this a lot by chance?
---
Dang it.. PC...
---
Well, happy to share data, I've been collecting treasure maps in the hope of doing 100 per person with a "perceived lucky", "Average" and "Unlucky" in 4 spots..
---
Seems like the best possible control.
---
I'm hoping the reduction in the number of fusion cores will reduce the number of people who constantly wear PA. I didn't know about the recharge glitch until recently and always wondered how people could do this even with all the perks. PA should be the premium peice of kit and the costs of using and up keep should reflect that IMO.
---
hi, nice build, im basically running the same build. I was wondering against the queen do you have a secondary 2h melee weapon like bloodied and I assume your are in PA against the queen since survinging with would be pretty difficult.
---
thx for the reply 
---
Demo expert perk on?
---
If it was perfectly preserved, why does it have rads?! Bethesda lying again! Where's my refund!?
---
Or maybe since he's already done the work some other people could help add it.
---
Was wanting to invite a nearby player to witness the occurrence but he just ignored me :(
---
I’ll buy the forest camo jumpsuit for 25k caps. Just message me
---
I agree that many people are just salty about it but with everyone having duped weapons it also takes away from the rarity of finding and using an over powered weapon. 
---
It starts to get old when every time you come across someone they’re using the same exact gun as you
---
Once I started doing lucky hole, I never raid gyms anymore. Also Charleston fire station is better for gym raiding, lucky hole is still better.
---
just out of curiosity do you know how you did so much damage to him? They fixed the level scaling bugs right? Did he really just suck that much ?
---
Well even in full sentinel all you have to do is get them to stagger and they are able to be killed. Or stagger them while they are running to also break the effect and kill them.
---
Hm, that’s interesting. No more problems since then? 
---
Smh that's just terrible... Side note, mind if I add you and I can tag along with your group sometime?  Gt:  SonicRun83
---
you hit the nail on the head lol. check his recent comments, its entirely on the duping/TSE/banning posts
---
again, I don't see why that's a problem. it's their prerogative. lots of people refuse to trade tses and want to find one themselves. that's also their prerogative. it's wholly subjective.
---
the problem, imo, are people who play the game for bragging rights.
---
I'm flattered by the offer but no can do, only have one of each of what I got
---
That link is just referring to the CND of the item not the type of time you get.
---
Seems to be working fine now.  Might have been the time it took to get to the vendor, or the vendor displaying my inventory that fixed it... who knows
---
i saw him once maybe less than a week after launch when i was like level 10 or 15 and the second time ever was just a couple days ago when my friend was taking over workshops and got really lucky, i’m over level 100 now. for me he’s an extremely rare sight
---
52 when i decided to stop farming whitesprings and joined a twitch streamer to take down the queen. Now at 85 ive only just done the enclave quest to launch my own nuke
---
What platform are you playing on
---
I killed x3 3**'s with no Legendaries..
---
No drills
---
No syringes..
---
Salty.. 
---
Turrets won't do anything. Have a shitty camp you don't care about.
---
That’s right. Thanks!
---
I think I’ve met one - I mean a vendor bot. Is it traveling one? And is it possible to kill them at all? They seem to be regenerating.
---
Someone's said moving your camp repairs everything for free. I think it works, but I haven't tested it extensively. Maybe try that?
---
Ok, but for someone in mid (30) levels? I can’t get close to Watoga.
---
DUper Dukes ammo 'kraftin' guide
---
luck has been a factor in the quality of your junk since at least when i started playing in fallout 3.
---
Same. Twice since launch, nothing worth buying either time... But i gained so much knowledge about meat 
---
Might as well, haha
---
I made $12k off Diablo 3s RMAH with bots before they scrapped that whole system.
---
People pay. They pay big time.
---
we have a group, but we are all over 100 :( 
---
I met a random guy last week and was telling him about this murder church I saw and how badass it was and he told me he had seen the vid to. We both thought it was rad. 
---
Same. I just want people’s shit. Sometimes you win, sometimes you get slaughtered by a low level and lose a bag full of good loot. 
---
That said - I’ll help a low level out if I see them struggling in an event, but don’t think for a minute I won’t take their shit if they die. It’s a tough world out there and I need more screws. 
---
Nope. That would be 365 or similar.
---
Dude I've been able to one shot without a Grogs since level 35... 
---
The challenge is being an effective melee build without one shorting everything m, and being a jerk..
---
Or both.
---
And Happy cake day
---
The first and only time I've been to a nuke zone I had 6 guys PVP me, kill me and take all my loot. Never again :(
---
Some clown built like 30 of them in white springs, I switched servers.
---
Hey blibo, can you create a full light armor set for me soon? If I give ya the materials. I'm tired of looking like ass
---
got 1 4 sale
---
Around mid 90s I bought my last set. I still see them randomly. 
---
It's not illegal. It's frowned upon and against Bethesdas TOS but it's not illegal.
---
Well, you're wrong in many things, but the one i myself find irritating is that you think that PS4 sales are the highest, according to some moderately trusted statistics only 37% percent of games are sold on consoles, that means both Xbox One and PS4. And that was 2016, in 2017 the number decreased even further, can't remember the exact numbers tho
---
Just fast traveled to my base to drop some things off, two 800+ bounty fellows decided to come level my C.AM.P. Could not have been there for more than two minutes and these people come through with explosive weapons tearing my base to shreds. 
---
sent you a friend req, same name as here. would love to snag one if you still have the mats
---
Okay who is Grahm? Keep seeing posts about it but haven't had an explanation
---
outside of empath and the melee ones (if you do not melee) all the mutations are awesome
---
Multiboxing.  People buy a second copy of the game and set up a second account to run a second instance of the game either on the same system or on a backup.
---
Way to point the finger at duped weapons that were likely not actually duped.  Hell, you probably have duped weapons at this point.
---
Yeah, he's your buddy if you summon him through the event. He remains for a few minutes after the finish.
---
Love this, well done!
---
Any time :) mine is Kami seb
---
damn I want a deathclaw
---
except if you've worked hours building a base you love on a specific terrain it's essentially either pay the mats or rebuild your base from scratch
---
 / let players have a multi character made base (BASE) that can be leveled up with materials / event completions so it levels over time like our characters.
---
It’s a video game with a PvP bounty system.  You’re being ridiculous.
---
Sue them for what? What laws have they broken?
---
Honestly? Neither scream "support" to me. There are a Tom of skills in the charisma tree you're neglecting, you should only have hacker and lockpick slotted if you know you're not gonna have time to switch them out. 
---
Not hating or anything, but not sure we have the same interpretation of "support"
---
Only got one turret, (I love decorating oops)
---
Would saving the blueprint work?
---
I think so, at least that’s my experience. 
---
Same here. And the hood under the helmet just looks awful. If you kept your hair (or a hairstyle in the event of clipping) it would look way better. But nope, the hood just ruins it. 
---
Grahm is a level 50 super mutant vendor who is quite rare to find over the wasteland. I’m not sure if he sells anything unique.
---
The most damage i have seen done to her by a weapon is the fat man.
---
Yes, I am on PC.
---
I get your point I just think there has to be a cost for attacking people because I (and most others who equip/perk for pvp) can simply one shot those we attack from stealth etc. Its zero challenge.
---
Thank you!
---
I was trying to tame animals outside of random-encounter-locations. Oops
---
That we totally agree on. ;)
---
Hmm thank you.   Perhaps I will try nuking The Heart then.
---
Yes server hoping is jumping out then jumping in
---
Maybe after the console patch goes in. Until then the disconnects and crashes ensure you won't be on that server long enough to benefit much from whatever you nuke.
---
because of how picky the game is with "floating" foundations it's either going to take you ages to find a spot that's willing to accept the more intricate base designs or pay the hundreds of caps to move your camp 1 foot (due to the bug with moving your camp minute distances costing way more than intended)
---
You should go with us if you are on Xbox. I have yet to encounter that.
---
Ha!  Like Total Recall (Original) and Hunger Games?
---
Id rage quit as well but I think there's merit in building in discreet out of the way locations 
---
Hi, I'm Preston Garvey!
---
Great work but now I have a shit load of jobs for you to do 
---
because I can't be assed to do them myself!!
---
That joke immediately got you a downvote
---
Some trick. You can check who owns the camp by looking at the CAMP. 
---
I bet the random number seed is generated when the server starts, that sounds in my limited understanding of maths like something that could cause that.
---
No problem, I'm pretty sure I know the plans for that. Just drop me a message on PSN or join my server when I'm playing and we'll get you set up right. If you have Black Titanium I can add the Deep Pocketed mod to them, really helps with carry weight.
---
Or the scorch leader shooting me with pipe pistol and drops 1 hunting, 1 broken combat rifle and 1 broken assault rifle, no ammo.
---
Er... huh?
---
fuck that bitch dr.stein58. Imma kill you in the Virginian wasteland. 
---
Even better and thanks lol.
---
Very true
---
I cant explain point number one only speculate, they mightve found another players camp or workshop, as for the bounty going down I do not know if over time it goes down or not. point number 2: you can get a bounty by harming a players camp, aka shot a wall or chair? you get a bounty. Lockpick someones safe? you get a bounty.
---
I have ran into a bug where i got a bounty when nowhere near a spot i would get a bounty while playing as a pacifist and had a bunch of high levels gang up on me and claim the bounty and my scrap and they got no punbishment thanks to a bug.
---
True but if your already going to Morgantown might as well stop 
---
I will make sure to do that in the future. I think most people saw 5000 caps and just wanted to go get it. 
---
There’s this train in the middle of Ash Heap that never fully renders and looks absolutely awful. This game is it’s own type of graphics.
---
It's already been said but dump in a river and hop out of server
---
I have a TSE one, tested it out... it was real fun.
---
do u use gunsmith to slow the breakdown
---
Please welcome the president of the united states...CLANK CLONK
---
It needs its durability buffed big time.
---
Okay sorry it just occurred to me this wouldn't work, you would only loose your junk and not the stimpaks.
---
Hey, i don't really play the game anymore and basically almost never do Queen like casually. I tried just 2 times for the Build video but framerate makes it unplayable as always. You can't use PA with this Build it's made to be used with Unyielding. Just fight it outside the blast. I have multiple weapon, but if Im beating the Queen up, there is no point to change weapon, my main is enough. Maybe for Swing Speed but that's it. You can't do the Highest Damage with that tho.
---
It's in the Advanced Connectors plans, I think. There's a recent top post that shows every camp item and the plan that creates it, check on there to be sure.
---
I bought a X-01 jetpack mod.  Didn't realize I lacked the flux to apply it.  I didn't craft or repair anything until I got the mats for the remaining flux.  Kept asking on /trade to pay for it, but no one was parting with it.
---
Advanced power connectors. I bought the plan from the Harpers Ferry bot. 
---
My husband and I play together. We have dedicated characters for this and different builds for these characters. 
---
I would recommend building your characters together. We used an online program, I can look it up if you’d like, that allowed us to build our S.P.E.C.I.A.L. perks out. For instance my husband is a heavy gun build but I’m sniper/melee but he shares one perk card that cuts my armor weight which is really nice. I forget what card I share but it means we needed to factor either enough Charisma points or not fully build up that card. It takes 3 Charisma per one point on the card. 
---
You both probably don’t need to be able to build the armor, weapons, etc so only one of you needs these perk cards (don’t build these into your S.P.E.C.I.A.L but get them so when you are building you can equip them). This frees up perk choices for the other person. 
---
Treat your characters as one. There is no his and hers. Sharing is caring. I give all unwanted weapons and armor to my husband so he can learn more stuff for us to build. I also took the Hard Bargain  perk so we have cheaper prices, when shared, for Vendor stuff. This also means I sometimes buy plans my husband wants because they aren’t offered by his vendor and vice versa. I have the travel perk so I pay for the fast travel most of the time.  We also share all our junk so if he needs something like screws, adhesive, etc or I do the other person usually has it. Every once in a while I charge him on accident during a trade :/ 
---
We also play off one another’s builds. I engage from a distance for Sneak damage then he engages. He tends to level up faster than me and is typically ahead two or three levels. We’ve had to adjust our game play for this but it works out. 
---
Having two bases means an extra free travel place so build two. Mine is just one of each bench, a bed, and an instrument. 
---
Take the time to do your builds. My character from Beta is a disaster because I just took whatever perk looked good. I’m still trying to respec that character...it is tedious but I can’t let her go. 
---
Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions. Or if you two would like to team up. We are on Xbox but currently only have one headset. 
---
That's just uncofirmed rumour by one guy. Latest hotfix should have fixed most server crashes which were the reason for rumour to spread
---
&gt; Addressed an issue with workshops that could cause server instability. 
---
radiation of +5 or greater can cause mutation. stick to a hazmat suit and lead belly 2 if you want to stop mutating without starching genes
---
Did they really changed the name of the plans
---
No, dupers utilize the method that is harder and far worse for server stability
---
Thanks man, when will you be on next? Funny enough, I'm looking for that anyways because of a magazine for my combat shotgun currently. 
---
You couldn't pay me to deal with briefing 14-year-olds in a game.
---
nice work, im saving this info for community / blue sky / podcasting and will shout u out if we decide to feature it
---
well, 300 shots of lead gone :-(
---
I’ve done all the quest except for enclave and I’m level 32
---
Without telling me what the method is, how is is making server stability?
---
Sounds good, thank you for all the details, really helps with how you explain the perk sharing. I was confused about it in game but makes alot of sense now
---
No but I have found a SB just chilling in THE FOREST!!! I can understand having one around the ash place but the lvl 1-10 forest starting area? Fucking ludicrous 
---
Wrong, t51 power armor nuka paint behind unmarked quest for c3 bunker. Only one brotherhood one to my knowledge so far being initate paint behind random rewards from the Forbidden Knowledge quest.
---
If you have an empty slot on a chassis then yes. You can use any power armor piece on any chassis slot
---
When considering legendary drops, I can say that they improved as I raised my luck from 8 to 15.  I have seen legendary drops with better effects.   I started getting stuff that I never seen before like Medics Pistols and Medics Miniguns.    Well before I was just getting Assassin's and +acc to vats (forgot the name).   The items themselves have been better weapons like I used to get Pip Pistols, Pitchforks and Rolling Pins.     Now I get The Dragon(s), Miniguns and Rolling Pins...  
---
what are achievements for?
---
feels?
---
Yet you reply?............
---
Alot of the abilities you don't need to have on unless your doing a certain thing. Bethesda did not give us any sort of lock in system. So we are kinda jack of all trades.
---
If on pc you can use perk manager to swap them up on the go for most situations. 
---
I have had this happen, but not very often.
---
Crouching hides you on the map as does blocking.
---
The lack of NPCs doesn't really have anything to do with PVE and PVP players being forced to coexist on the same servers despite having drastically different goals and expectations.  Those are two separate issues.  Maybe I've been missing them when they come to the front page, but I haven't noticed a slew of posts complaining about no NPCs.  Maybe they're getting downvoted into oblivion.  All I've seen are posts expressing appreciation for the storytelling that is in the game, NPC-less as it is.
---
As for raiding not being griefing...  Well, it is, at least the way it's being done in this game.  There is little else to do, and the few organised PVP activities don't seem popular.  You also go on to acknowledge that it actually is griefing, but then blame that on the victims because they're not entertaining enough.  That's not what I bought the game for.  I knew it had a PVP element, but I didn't read about it, and watch videos, and think, "Man, I can't wait to pay $60 for this game so I can be a lootbag for PVP players.
---
I'm still not certain what they were aiming for, but I'm pretty sure that's not it.  They expected some more variety in the playerbase, and they got what seems to be way more PVE players than PVP players.  So the PVP players are bored and are acting out?  Okay, but you can't blame that on the PVE players.  Bethesda's fault for not planning the PVP out better?  Maybe.  PVP players' fault for reacting in an immature manner?  Maybe.  PVE players' fault for not being more entertaining targets?  That doesn't make sense.
---
Whatever their goal was, this is clearly a PVE game.  They added PVP, maybe to pull in some of the battle royale crowd, or because they weren't confident their PVE content would keep players satisfied, but they insisted on integrating it with PVE instead of giving us separate PVE and PVP servers from the start.  Who is their core audience going to be?  Fortnite players?  PUBG players?  Black Ops players?  No, it's going to be Fallout players, and even knowing PVP will be a part of the experience they're likely to be more interested in everything else.
---
Obviously I can't actually speak for everyone playing.  This just makes more sense than expecting a new Fallout game to be populated primarily by competitive survival shooter players.  Bethesda might have wanted to pull them in, but they should have given them their own servers, where they won't have the option to toggle pacifist on and can fight players that actually aren't boring.  Players who want that danger, who want to min-max and get involved in the meta, who want to fight back instead of blocking and relocating and server-hopping.
---
Leave us boring players to our PVE servers, so we can play through the quests, explore, and build in relative peace.  We're likely not even geared or specced for PVP, so we're going to be at a disadvantage by default.  If we change our minds and want PVP, we can switch to a PVP server, or create a PVP character, however that's handled.  Really should've been this way from the beginning.
---
Ah the white knight of cuntery has rode in to bash on others for a video game. 
---
Bullies are always sore losers.  That's why they're bullies.  They like easy prey and fair fights aren't really fun to them.
---
A while back, sometime around Christmas, I found some wanted player trolling the hell out of newbies, this lvl 8 pre-pubescent in particular that was swearing profusely in area chat and about to lose his mind trying to fight off this overpowered bully.  The troll was probably somewhere around lvl 50.  I think I was somewhere around lvl 80 at the time.  It's hard to keep track.  I got up on top of the church to see what was going on and verified a player in a vault suit being chased down by a guy with an incomplete suit of power armor mashing him with a sledge.  The vault boy was doing his best to kill the guy with some kind of pistol, but it was never going to end well for him.  I'm a pretty solid marksman both in and out of game, so I used a stationary scope trapping method to easily headshot him as he ran right into my crosshairs.  I don't think he even knew I was there watching.  I dropped off the roof, took a hit of psychobuff, ran towards the Flatwoods spawn site and shot him several times.  Luckily he decided to fight back, because I was barely hurting him acting as the griefer.  Once he got a hit on me I lit him up with my armor piercing legendary handmade.  It was fun to stand over his collapsed body and ask him how fun it was to get picked on by someone who could fight back.  I was prepared to do it until he rage quit and apparently it was the proper dose of medicine because he quit or server hopped for greener pastures.  Of course I was now wanted, and asked the kid to pop me in the head but please leave the lead and steel in my loot bag because I was low on ammo.  He really didn't want to, but I explained that I'll get killed by someone else randomly for the bounty and I'd rather he have the caps and whatever random junk I was carrying for his troubles.  The least I could do was make him a kitted out 10mm for his trouble and wished him a happy new year.  He added me to friends afterwards and I still see him online from time to time, but we haven't linked up or interacted since.
---
A good sense of accomplishment, achievable...
---
Be vewy vewy qwiet I’m hunting wabbits.
---
As much as I love this game it feels like a beta at best.  I'm hoping today's console patch is actually decent.  If not I might take a break from it.
---
It has the potential to be one of the best games ever made.  All it has to do is not crash every hour and keep a solid fps.  Most of my frustrations have been from server disconnects, crashes and nuke zones performing like a PowerPoint presentation.  
---
I've bought atoms to support the game but at this stage that profit will just go into shareholders rather than improving it. 
---
I am having this issue with Gunslinger. I have it at 4 ranks but after redistributing points I want to go back to Gunslinger 3. Even with two other Gunslinger cards I cannot combine them to make Gunslinger 2. It will only let me add them to make Gunslinger 5.
---
my dad is 60 something, recently he decide to get the game and we captured our first workshop south west of the vault last saturday, i used my new non combat character who is built for creature pactifying, ignoring combat, and carrying supplies (not weapons)
---
Dupers are running servers into the dirt trying to get as much as they can before the patch. Hopefully we'll see less of it after
---
Mths is great for shotgun shells I average about 60-80 every run, at least have the scorched drop 6-15 shells the plastic is just a bonus now
---
allegedly, it requires you to crash the entire server.
---
allegedly because I've never seen it in action or anyone talking about it for that matter.
---
Sadly iv seen the siren trend at whitesprings too. Today I ran into a huge camp at whitespring with nothing but sirens and punji boards everywhere, and a guy wearing full assassins sentinels and the dev room hat taunting people and bragging about how unkillable he is. Half the people still playing this game are pure cancer
---
It basically utilizes server rollbacks and disconnects entire server.
---
Now thats odd, I rarily get normal rolling pins!  Where does he spawn, I need to learn the mods for those!  I got a good stash of legendary ones for almost any occasion!
---
Great job! when i started to like the game i got the feeling like it was a little secret that other gamers will gradually learn. u are confirming those feels i had.
---
I was about to start a spreadsheet today to help better keep track of plans I have but this 100x better. Great stuff! 
---
Does it really?! 
---
Yeah... I have to admit, I have a quite special love/hate relation with FO76. But as I said on their Twitter post about the 150+ bug fixes patch, it has appeased the dumpster fire but we are not there yet.
---
When you don't disconnect the queen still flies off the map
---
They need to allow the auto grenade launcher to shoot those things too!
---
I'd take a fps drop. I always CTD whenever I go to Whitespring, over ten times now. It just started happening today for some reason.
---
y not just save it
---
I would guess that you hand off items to a friend, they switch server and then you crash the server to force a reversion of your gear.
---
Hm.. that's actually smart.  Giving benefit of the doubt instead of assuming it was accidentally discovered.
---
I never even considered this even though I have seen the scorched pick up weapons.
---
Just avoid the crystal nodes.
---
Easy question to start with, where are you building?
---
1st off, I owe nothing to you.  I have work and a real life and this is the first time I've come back to reddit since this morning.
---
2ndly I've tried to answer and respond to you, genuinely and honestly and your responses have been disrespectful and "LUL THIS GUY" in nature.
---
3rd, I DID already answer this, in my original post, which I feel you didn't even read, since this is the third time now I'm specifically responding to something that is answered in my original post.
---
4th just to answer your question so you don't feel justified saying "HAH TOLD YOU GUYS THIS GUYS A HACK!" I will answer.
---
I don't think this does screw over honest player, of which I am one, whether or not you choose to believe it.  I may not be elite end game ultra geared, but my main character is over level 100 through legitimate gameplay.  I have a few 'alt' characters as well, to try completely different builds and such.  Across all of my time playing, I've never hacked, exploited, or cheated.  
---
My desire to see people unbanned is three fold;
---
1. I've heard stories from twitch viewers about them getting banned erroneously and that being the reason they quit the game.  Third party programs and the like that were on their system but not effecting the game itself.  Also non game play changing mods, like UI or Inventory labeling mods.  I, as an 'honest player' am willing to give these people a second chance.
---
2. I Feel like if the gaming community is going to give the game a 'second chance,' whether or not you think the game needs it or not, then the players should likewise be given a second chance to make right.  Again it's worth pointing out this is in conjunction with a public and draconic policy regarding hacking / cheating / exploiting going forwards.
---
3. Finally, my favorite times playing this game are when I'm playing with my friends.  But secondary to that are when I come across someone in Appalachia and we team up for a little while before going our separate ways.  Maybe it's an event, maybe it's just taking down a death claw.  But the game doesn't feel as 'full' as it used too in the early days when I've played lately.  Quite frankly, I just want to see more people playing it.
---
Now that I've answered your question, be clear on the fact that I don't particularly think you are a very respectful or decent poster, and your level of toxic comments on this thread have been, in my opinion, childish in tone and attitude.  If you have serious questions and want to phrase them as one adult to another, respectfully.  I'll gladly engage in dialogue with you.  But more of this type of bullshit?  This 'if you have any integrity' or the other posts you've had on this thread where you make assumptions about me, or even call me a liar when I've said one thing and your attitude is in the vein of 'yeah right hacker!' you should know that I will simply be ignoring the questions.  This is in no way something you should take as anything other than my desire to communicate with people who want to discourse, and my unwillingness to sling mud.
---
Thanks.
---
47  and done almost nothing in ash heap, mire, or cranberry. having 200 hours nearly now of the most absolute blast in gaming ever. mega gratitude to the developers and idea ppl.
---
Thank u
---
Used to be alright, lately I'm getting put on servers where responses are more than 1 second apart. Do get the occasional rare "local" server.
---
Think I have had my base attacked once since launch. Pays sometimes to build in out of the way places. It seems around white springs is a big no no with many players. Present base is right to the edge of cranberry bog and I get no player traffic.
---
Yes because it used to be the brick building set when there was already a brick building set :P
---
I got one today at watoga shopping center @ lvl 43
---
So when is Bethesda planning on nuking TSE??
---
I also lost a legendary in alpha it was a while ago though
---
I'd give you better specifics but I fear to log on to have to repair my base again. Somewhere roughly between Whitesprings and Sugar Grove, just north of some factory. 
---
maybe unscrappable... maybe undroppable
---
Most likely a group of friends sending alot of stuff over to designated mules for different stuff. Since Bethesda has capped us at 600 stash alot of us have alot of mules across multiple people to store stuff together.
---
Best thing I've seen was a ghoul at whitesprings get smacked with a hammer and a fatman pop out of him like a pinata then get sucked back into the ghoul. Drops a flare gun...
---
Thanks everyone
---
Just found this post, that sounds pretty cool - do you remember where it was?
---
It was fine for me until patch, I had to quit because its unplayable now. There is literally no point in even trying. Im done beta testing their game.
---
Ok what are the plans called for the metal walls not the scraper looking ones but the other metal walls
---
Converted munitions factory
---
The 'near whitesprings' part is the bit I was checking.  Best to keep bases as far away from Whitespirngs as possible but from the sounds of where you base is you shouldn't be having these issues. 
---
Best to permanently block these players. Hopefully you dont run into any problems with other people. I really enjoy seeing peoples bases and I hope we dont lose people doing creative builds because of this.
---
Feel free to mix and match different PA pieces, however the bonus to carry weight provided by the Excavator only applies when wearing the entire set (citation needed, but I'm pretty sure that's how it works).
---
Good bye, that's one less whiny bitch in the fo76 community.
---
I'm pretty sure you can just block them (not for the session) and just hop.
---
not that I disagree you, this hivemind here certainly doesn't help the problem by patting Beth on the head for fixing things that shouldn't happen in the first place.
---
Last Laugh and carry Nuka Grenades with you. Great fun.
---
Same thing happened to me.... little did they know I have a complete explosive build, nuka grenades and LAST LAUGH.
---
Thank you for introducing the new meta
---
blocking ignoring doesnt fucking work they got invisible and they can keep aoe you and oneshoting you with tse and mutlistacks of bheads. its stupid. BTW change servers? Na, for some reason i tried AND I KEEP FUCKING APPEARING IN THE SAME FUCKING SHIT SERVER
---
Thanks for your time and help! But yes, I spend loads of time base building as it is a part of this game I truly love. However, tonight I was simply dropping off the absurd amount of holotapes form the Mistress of Mysteries mission, could not have been more than a couple minutes before hell broke loose. 
---
The metal building set is the blue metal walls. The other metal set is called the warehouse walls??
---
There is also the brick building set and the barn building set (red wood walls).
---
i usually get a honey beast
---
as i predicted a retard usa bitch trying to be funny, kill yourself make your country proud. bitch
---
For the reply alone, you deserve a gold star and two internets. 
---
Good on ya. 
---
wait 30~45 second before hitting play, it should help. then again, sometimes there's so few players I keep rotating between the same half a dozen servers.
---
I had a black cat (not sure type) that range the door bell when wanted back inside.  Every time.
---
Hmm.   Team of 3 players sounds interesting, I wonder if you guys could plan the builds around team.  Like 1 player focus on a medic/rad sponge build while fighting?
---
There are quite a few support perks for the team.   I was curious to try out something like that.
---
You are west virginias Nick Valentine.👏 
---
ty for the advice, but not playing anymore this game is a shitshow and people who play it demonstrate they are also.
---
If you’re on pc I can bring you around the random event spawn points that I know to try to find a deathclaw for ya too. 
---
(One bad thing of deathclaw pets is that they’re hostile to everyone except you, so I had to pacify him again to make him docile - which ended up with him being too docile that he won’t even defend himself from enemy/player attacks 😑)
---
I turned them all off once... 10 minutes later some guy is asking if I knew who turned his stuff off and jokingly started shooting at me when I didn't answer. I think it's all in good fun but man is it annoying lol
---
Damn people still play this game? 
---
You on PC?  I do a lot of legendary farming to create my own end game and I'm always happy to pass along stuff I can't use to others.  I traded a 3 star vats/faster reload/+1 Per lvl 45 lever action to a friend last week simply because it didn't exceed the dps of my explosive combat rifle.
---
I'm Shankwell on PC.  I'm not swimming in legendary rifles, but I do find a good one from time to time making the circuit around Watoga, Harper's Ferry and Whitesprings.  I tend to save the decent two shot, armor piercing, furious or instigating weapons in case I can initiate trade with fellow wastelanders.  If not, I dump the heavy stuff in the blue suitcase at Watoga station, the sack next to the tinker's bench at Whitesprings Station or the cash register near Wallace at Harper's Ferry.
---
I used a regular kitted out lever action for a good while after I stumbled across the plans.  It's a very good gun.  The Watoga and Harper's Ferry vendors often have plans for lever action night vision scopes that aren't available to learn through scrapping.  Highly recommended for skulking through pitch black mines and headshotting.  I personally prefer the short NV scope to maintain better peripheral vision and easier target acquisition on mobs.
---
idk the name of it, but there's a perk in luck(?) that gives you a chance to fully repair your weapon every time you damage an enemy w it.
---
This is my [whiskey warrior](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1b31eb&amp;d=s92sf2ss2se2sg2e60em1ej4a72a42aa2la2a04l71lu2c81i10pe0e20lt2&amp;w=&amp;n=) 
---
This character has been a blast to play. I've focused primarily on pvp with him. 
---
Combat pretty much comes down to a sprint. If I can reach whatever is shooting me before my health is gone I'm normally guaranteed a win. 
---
For mutations I have talons, twisted muscle, marsupial, speed demon, and plague walker. 
---
I'm especially pleased with how well marathoner, moving target, and speed demon pair together. If I'm moving my damage is noticeably reduced. I try not to stop sprinting once a fight has begun. 
---
Adrenaline is pretty great if you can warm it up. With it maxed I've gotten my 333 damage power first up to 755 damage. I know I can go higher with additional drugs and chems. 
---
My night on PC  was weird too. My game ate my Charisma perk cards! I suspect they’ll be back when I log back in... quite a few disconnects tonight too, which is unusual for me. Roll on tomorrow and a better day 
---
Everyone thinks their raiders on here but there more like scorched "not.... us" fuck them all an fuck their quest for karma on this i'm new to this app an just see too many stuck up twats with the byes an one less blah blah not everyones a sad prick like them
---
I love the game, but you can't honestly defend its graphics.
---
Looking for pistols. If it doesn't move in a frew days I'd be willing to take caps.
---
As someone who hunts griefers alot. I can confirm these new a holes are showing up alot. Since the bobble bit went main stream. Seeing alot more of it and if your aware of my thread on it you know it goes into the millions if they want.
---
Unfortunately we can't stop these one and we have tried ( we come equipped). Recently one we dealt with was very alarming.
---
This person was one shotting us from a very large distance. Upon arrival at where we thought the bounty was on the map. 
---
So can't rely on any groups out there that try to stop griefers. This one is on Bethesda to end and to make sure to clear up the bobble buff. As it can be refreshed over and over.
---
Fuck dupers , fuck griefers and fuck exploiters in general.
---
Go to the train station north east of the gorge, near Mama Dolche...it has a couple of ivory grips every time I stop by, which is often.. 
---
......of course 
---
Not to mention tons of plastic: golf balls, golf clubs, etc.
---
Since the patch on  Jan 10 i constantly crash to desktop when doing a 'whitespring circle' (club house -&gt; cabins -&gt; utility facility -&gt; and back). Just right after leaving the garden part heading back to the club house, the game crashes to desktop. Every single time. Yesterdays hotfix (which was a server hotfix) didn't change that.
---
Apart from that, i rarely get a crash and even less disconnected.
---
after killing close to 40 queens and not getting any plans i didnt learn before the first queen ....
---
So i take it we should mod our armor with padded mod to resist explosions for pvp?
---
I don't think you can call it a support build if you're not exploiting charisma. That's pretty much the support tree.
---
I'd think Tenderizer and Suppressor to be must-haves. Rad sponge too unless someone on the team has a rad-build, then slot it off. Take Ghoulish in the END tree and share that for some extra HoT for nuke zones. Just to start things off.
---
We need one for weapons too, my .44 needs a little rename
---
If you are on PC and have the perk manager this is exactly the way I would be looking at it too (or even without it but just with more card swapping). Concentrate on a build that works for you but just be aware of what points your are putting into which perk so you can be flexible with it if you needed to change based on who is is your team/what you are doing/if you are crafting etc.
---
Remember even after you pick the cards you want for your minimum build you will still unlock random packs of cards and will still be unlocking cards well after level 50. Crafting cards are really useful but are only useful while you are crafting. While you are running around you really want to be using those points for more passive things.
---
Sorry doesn't really answer you question but just keep it in mind :P
---
Amazing build!  Took some creativity to do that within the budget!
---
Best game
---
Still good tips for them buddy and as a community we should always help each other.
---
A new emergent gameplay, each time you reload the assaulton head, you have to drop a C.A.M.P.
---
I’m around level 125 and haven’t even seen him 
---
You get it from the... what was it, second or third main quest. That's the only source for it. Max level 45.
---
Damn, tell me what you really think. O_0
---
If only they came with a fortune cookie
---
Nicely done. Maybe now I can finally stop scraping hunting rifles.
---
We're not being boring.  Just look at how PVE-focused this game is.  We're enjoying the experience the game was designed to offer.  Even though PVP was announced well before the game was done, it still feels like it was just slapped on so it could be there.
---
If anything, the PVP players (the griefers anyway) are being boring.  Where's the fun in leveling the camp of a player who, even if pacifist was off, would have no chance of stopping you?  Where's the fun in that for either side?
---
I guess if the PVP player is just a bully by nature it's fun, but that doesn't earn any sympathy from me.  Give them their own server, and let them beat on each other if that's what they want.  Though it seems like some of them don't actually want competition, they just want easy targets.  I see no reason PVE players should have to be those targets.
---
if thats actually going on these people need Ip bans tbh
---
Bad luck for you. Sometimes you'll come across some nice humans... others? Pure twisted evil.
---
Thats why I love this game. Its just like real life. If apocalyptic event ever occurs- itll be just like The Walking Dead. 
---
Rick Grimes was so torn throughtout the series having to kill his fellow man. Others? Wouldnt even blink an eye, heck you are a walking meat bag to some.
---
Welcome to planet earth.
---
Kawaii desu!
---
I despise what dupers and exploiters have done to the game 100%. I Seriourly hope they are losing their fucking accounts for their shit.
---
But the toxic community part no really man. The 76 community is probably one of the best communties around.
---
So yep fuck all them cunts but not the community.
---
where can i find heavy metal plans ? its driving me insane having one leather leg at level 107 because vendors have the same inventory every day
---
Exactly.   I don’t support it but I can understand it,  one can only get so many junkies rolling pins and vampires switchblades before feeling like the only way to get anything good is to buy it.
---
get naked besides the duped items and leave them in a fissure, thats insta death i'm pretty sure
---
Show us on this bobblehead where the duper touched you.
---
Your Medic 10mm has a good synergy. Perception increases VATS accuracy. I interpret this as VATS having farther range with 95% accuracy. The +1 Per will help you crit spam.  
---
The 10% aim damage doesn't help you as much since you rarely aim.  
---
If I recall the rumor, pipe weapons benefit from both pistol and rifle perks. The 10mm pistol will benefit from only pistol perks. That may impact your damage and how the weapons feel.  
---
There is also the rumor weapons that weigh less cost less AP to VATS shoot.
---
Use what you feel comfortable with. That's how I have fun in this game.
---
Yeah, I was getting headless super mutants labeled as ghouls 😅
---
Other thought- if you dont have a high damage output weapon dont come. Weve killed her with 4 before. We dont need the help and her health buffs for each additional person there. Also, if you stand on top of the roofs and stuff, SHE WONT LAND which makes her just about impossible 
---
You don't need flux to apply it.. it will just show that you need it to craft it, but you can just slap it on for free..
---
Particularly appreciate your mutation blue sky thought, having combo effects sounds incredible, and then think of how it could work when your interacts with a team mates or nearby player fighting a boss? 
---
Saving your post and will figure out incorporating it into my ongoing blue sky / positive feedback submission to the powers that be
---
I have my camp next to Camden Park and I find tons of mods for the excavator quite often there. I'm a level 65 though.
---
Damage output is 10,000.
---
30,000 Damage with Ninja Perk.
---
That's without Critical, 40% from power attack, and some others Damage boost.
---
It isn't the max but it's close.
---
haha you made me laugh.
---
wáter 
---
Now , tell me how you really feel 
---
Morgantown high school cafeteria and gym for plastic. Vault tech University gym or Charleston fire station gym for lead. Steel is everywhere, I like to farm mole miners, Welch or blackwater mine is good for that. Finally, for gunpowder, either craft it, farm super mutants, or farm the dead raiders at the raider camps and at the top of Top of the World where Rose is (also a good bit of plastic there).
---
Hope this lower level guide helps.
---
Can this be done on console too? I was crafting ammo in my camp a while ago, when i lagged, got a server not responding msg, got disconnected, then when i came back, my ammo was uncrafted. It basically rolled me back like a minute.
---
woah woah woah excavator armour increases ores?
---
not just account, they should get a lawyer knocking on the door and get  a nice big fine, only way to stop it.
---
The falsely accused one is the one that you get from the roaming Mr gutsy bots right?
---
/r/thatHappened
---
Lol sounds about right. Fair point! Mainly I'm just bummed about these weapons people are using. I am an ex Rust player, I know people's grief quite well. Griefing is fine and all, but these weapons... Strict!

Happy to add you mate even if you just want to use my group perk bonuses you get 15% xp and few other thing ( build for group support )
---
Had a group accuse my wife of killing them this weekend. We don't go out of our way to do that. It's not how we want to play. Once they realized we weren't friends or associates of the players who were, they teamed up with us &amp; a few jumped to my c.a.m.p. (small background: My character build is heavily mutated with a double barrel ghoul slayer with explosive damage.) It's not even that high of a level, received during a Whitesprings run a month or so ago. 
---
Anyway, I'm on the roof of my c.a.m.p waiting for our new friends to show up when I see one of the griefers walk up, crouch &amp; go invisible. I recognize the name because I just saw it on my wife's TV. Then his partner shows up.  They are both crouched at the edge of my c.a.m.p, starting to take shots at me.  I'm offering a safe haven &amp; they aren't excited about that fact. So the wife &amp; I walked above their heads &amp; dispatched them while they tried to keep up &amp; aim high.  Bounty collected. 
---
Then switched servers.  
---
We had a completely different experience over a month ago.  The wife &amp; I were wandering around doing some supply drops.  There were 2 players hiding in the woods waiting to snipe unsuspecting people.  They got us a few times but then we turned around and started lobbing grenades and bullets in the general direction of the shimmer from their crouched Chameleon armor. After a few times shooting back &amp; forth, we decided we were done &amp; leaving. We had died a few times &amp; lost some junk. But they waved at us &amp; asked us to follow them. Reluctantly, we did &amp; found that they had dropped all of our junk &amp; a few other items for us. 
---
With that out of the way, I'll say that I'm okay with PvP in a general sense, but if you gang up 4 on 1 (essentially knocking the balance over in your favor), you probably aren't that confident of your ability.
---
I can't expect others to play in this open world sandbox the exact same way I play.  That would get boring for you all.  
---
Don't forget golf clubs scrap into plastic and other mats. Took me a while to realise it because when you have the pip-boy search for plastic, the magnifying glass icon doesn't show.
---
What’s it like being a misanthrope that does nothing but shit on the happiness of others?
---
Does it sooth your sad, empty existence? Is that it?
---
There is all kinds of MMOs out there, some of them over 10 years old.
---
They didn't do a proper beta. They launched too early. All of that for profit.
---
They didn't listen to their customers. They treated us like children.
---
They denied on multiple occasions that their game is unsave and today servers are going down because of duped items.
---
I won't buy a Bethesda game on release ever again. Or at least not until trust is restored.
---
Marketing and sales seem in charge of Bethesda these days.
---
One thing in that story is unreal - all that playing, hanging around, 2 nukes and server didn't disconnected. No, impossible ;)
---
You can get higher defense without power armor but you’ll need barb evasive junk shield etc 
---
Will add when I get home!
---
yeah, I'm gonna have to disagree with you there.  experience sever instability with this new patch. 
---
There's a certain place on that map in a mountain range that allows you to build inside of the map if done correctly. No one can get inside it except friends that fast travel to the person (fast traveling to the camp makes you spawn outside and is fairly difficult to figure out how to get inside). The person who made it has to move their camp device to a certain spot to make it so they spawn inside of it so they don't have to glitch to get inside their own base.
---
Hilarious, makes me want to try building more than just four of them and then attaching them to one switch and turning it on at a high traffic area; seeing how fast people go crazy xD. I know I wouldn't last long.
---
End game is boreing , so people pvp
---
Blame the shallow end game
---
D’oh! You’ve changed the outcome by measuring it!
---
Well I got the mod for you. As it turns out she is "the person in charge of Vault-Tec before the war, and specifically in charge of Vault 111. She is the reason that your spouse is dead, and child stolen from you". Also she modifies her body to become larger and stronger. Unfortunately not 200ft tall but it's something.

Sounds awesome, thanks for sharing a story like this :D
---
I'll be editing with a gallery, I don't have any pictures from the Nukes because I was terrified of a disconnect at any moment.  
---
Iirc, this violates ebays policies. Just report the listing. 
---
I play XB1 and i'm always up for helping others out. Mostly give people ammo because I tend to keep every bit I find for that reason. my GT is BaronSwanston13, feel free to add me and drop me a message and I can come on, give you some stuff and help out with anything you need if I can.
---
Yup, crouching removes your icon from anyone except for team mates; and blocking just makes them poof from existence allowing you to live in peace. Blocking would work best in a situation like this where griefers are chasing you through multiple servers; dontcha just had toxic players.
---
You could think about a reactive defense, Born Survivor, and First Aid combined work great and if I find I'm in a bit more trouble I'll drink a Quantum.
---
The main mystery I'd like to see solved around this cryptid is how in the hell I find one.
---
This is why I quit a long time ago. I enjoyed it while it was good, then got out before it got too bad.
---
^ true
---
Well I mean all Bethesda titles are like this.. infinite ammo/magica etc. and you never get back their full inventory. Honestly has always been one of my gripes too but it's just part of their games and how they work; they have to limit difficulty in some way or another.
---
It's funny, in Far Harbor I saw 1 hermit crab literally as I was about to leave the island after finishing all the achievements/quests. In this game I've seen a tonne of them walking along the highway to the east. Annoying big bastards.
---
Still reading every Enclave flaired post in President Eden's voice...and there this is now. 
---
Glad you're enjoying it, Mr. President
---
Damn, way to put out the fire with laughter. 😉
---
Yeah seems to be increasing lately I’ve noticed, I guess it’s fun for some people. I just server hop and go about my business.
---
Yes, I'll update them, buy there's a community project to collect information from everyone linked at the top of the plans sheet that will have much more info.
---
I can't believe some of the dupers are even selling those cheated items.... GREED.
---
Curious, whats your Luck stat?
---
If your bounty exceeds you wallet then you lose what caps you have and are hit with a damage to player debuff for 3 hours of play time.
---
Dense. Like padded only twice better. 
---
As a Brotherhood field scribe I believe such a powerful items belongs my armory. ;) 
---
I'm sad they dont come in chinese takeout cartons
---
They try me when I was in a live steam
---
Good bot
---
People literally comment on dupe videos on YT with things like “I don’t care if my account gets banned, I’ll just buy the game again”
---
They are not PS2 graphics but they are also not Fallout 4 graphics.
---
Bulking may not weigh less in some cases but it allows you to sell excess junk and make more room in your stash. Stop hoarding people!
---
They can't fine them. It's not against the law just against the rules
---
is it normal for vendors to have the same notes every day at level 106 , been trying to get a simple tool box and metal plans for ageeesss,  i always see the same plans at the watoga vendor ( that damn marine armour ultra bull crap is what tipped me off ) 
---
I've gotten 4 explosive vents so far myself. Some guy the other day was apart of a group who was server hoping and doing 3 SBQ kills on every sever and he dropped some items and he had 12 explosive vents in his bag with only a few of the other armor plans. Those damn vents drop way to often.
---
I bashed people for cheating at a video game. If you think me saying you’re not some kinda hero is bashing you... well. Kinda proves my point. 
---
I didnt look at the Imgur Album, but most likely there are no Turrets.
---
Turrets take up extreme amount of Budget but are not really worth having.
---
I think Luck also affects which effects are on the legendaries.
---
I never saw any "Medic" at all in over 400 drops... Until I raised my luck up to 9 points (was 6 prior).  Now they are rare but I get a few occasionally, like 1 in 30.    (Level 90+ character at time)
---
I now seem to get some of the better legendary effects on the weapons and better base weapons... Plus Rolling Pins for all occasions!
---
My favorite was killing the scorch beast queen and wondering why on earth there was a three star rolling pin worth a whopping 5 caps.  I almost kept it just to break the spirits of a newb
---
"I'm reporting you enjoy your ban"
---
The cry of the defeated griefer.
---
Sadly I've tried griefer hunting on the PC side and never find any..... 
---
Griefers do nothing more but poison a game and either makes new players into griefers or makes them quit, eventually shutting the game down entirely.
---
have you Heard about our lord and savior comunist china?
---
The dark hardwood-lookin floors. I had previously bought the light version, and I loved them, so I figured hey why not, right?
---
I suppose I was maybe expecting something a little more richly saturated, like that one wooden door they have in the Atom Shop that is a deeper color, kind of shiny.
---
The dark floors are kind of...dusty looking? They look unremarkable and like they should be something found in the base game, not something that had to be specially purchased. Don't get me wrong, I still use them for my front and side porch, but I was hoping they'd be fancy looking enough to add something nice to the interior of my house.
---
I'll show your mine if you show me yours:
---
Directly from Bethesda's "Inside the vault" posts;
---
"*We’re also building an incredible list of future updates that we can’t wait to share, including new quests, weekly in-game events, new Vaults opening, a new PvP mode, Player Vending and much more.*"
---
"*We know you’re eager for new content and new ways to play Fallout 76. We’re still not quite ready to share details, but we can say that the time between the announcement of our next major update and its release will be very short. Our goal is to get the content in your hands as quickly as possible so we can iterate, improve, and make any needed changes based on your feedback. More to come soon including more information on what was shared in last week’s feature.*"
---
Bethesda will have no problem tracking people down, both players and inventories are tracked/recorded and they'll find abnormalities in either a theme developing with certain players or a consistency of players + forced crashes.
---
FO76 servers aren't the best performing in the world but FO itself is far from straining, an old i7 optiplex machine with enough ram could host multiple servers if they ever made private hosting available, they wouldn't be amazing but they would be stable and perform well enough... So when a lot of servers are going down for seemingly no reason, they're gonna investigate.
---
Dupers are even bleeding into the comments!
---
Every single player I’ve encounter that is not part of a big group I’ve kindly always given supplies , and plans , even legendaries and ammo :)
---
Spreading that giving spirit ;)
---
Sadly, ages ago when I was 18 I was playing Halo one online and the same 6 year olds said the same stuff. 
---
This proves to me those kids got older but never truly grew up
---
It's gotta be better than spoiled meat though right?
---
Even before RuneScape. 
---
The selling of Diablo 2 accounts loaded with duped SoJs and such were all over early eBay.
---
Ahh... so there's no padded on metal arms?    
---
    
---
I WAS LIED TO
---
I’d suggest looking for a similar level player/s that are willing to help. Best of you are both up to the same quest. 
---
Enemies are more likely to spawn at your level and you gain the perks of being on a team (Body Guard Perk etc)
---
I believe there are forums for players to team up. 
---
Someone is out there RPing as a commie....
---
You know it's unconfirmed rumour because Juicehead made a video about it.
---
But how was all this communicated with emotes?
---
Nope. Padded and Dense are the explosive protection and only exist as a Torso mod. Padded learned from scrapping and Dense learned by plan. I'm missing 4 armor mod plans, two of them Dense. They are hard to find!
---
Howdy,
---
Here the answers:
---
1. Westtek yes, because of the caps and ammo they drop. Rest depends on where the enemy is. If it´s right at the beginning/edge of an area, I just kill the legy. Also Watoga, I just kill the bot in the shopping center which is legy. 
---
2. No, doesn´t matter. 
---
3. It´s rng. I had it the other way around. Was a normal legy and respawned as a 3*. then as a 2*. next time as a 3*, next as a normal without stars.
---
4. I was also in Westtek, went throught the whole building and killed everything. Suddenly all mobs respawned but with a different variation of legendarys. Not sure if this was because some1 walked by or it was just a bug. Yesterday, I saw somebody at westtek, went to him to see if "his spawn" is different. But he had the same legendaries at the same position.
---
Also important about the loot: Look out for the injector or drill if there is no loot. Had it several times, killed a 3* legendary supermutant, was quite exited about what he would drop and found a drill or injector... 
---
@Bethesda: take these items out the loot table!!!!
---
Combat support needs to be pumped on charisma and change the melee loadout to ranged with auto/non-auto perk cards, then you're golden! A melee build is (or should be) a tanky front-line char.
---
That post you refer to had no evidence attached to it.
---
Juicehead is not a reliable source. 
---
He will report on things as fact based on Reddit posts with no evidence or simply wildly speculate about rumour and call it fact. 
---
Just one friend and I form a 4 man group between each of our two accounts. This is more common than some might think.
---
People exploited it\* 
---
From a new player pov, it takes years to make a lvl200, just saying, whereas people did it in 1 month with game glitches and so on
---
Yeah but it's really tolerable with dromedary and slow metabolizer.
---
Sometimes i just want to rack up a huuuuuuge bounty and have my friend collect it for me.
---
I quit my job highschool because I could earn a near full time income after school by selling power leveled Diablo 2 accounts loaded with items.
---
An actual bunker? With a reliable tick spot you can easily grab what you need to make stimpacks
---
Even that, i mean, it's all against a new player experience! The mmo component is sooooo dead right now, a new player has to enjoy the "rpg" aspect of this fallout (and we know it's not really an rpg game!)
---
Yeah. I need combat dense plan. Only found it as a one use only mod so far.    
---
   
---
I was hoping you coud stick padded on a limb to double dip on explo protection like you could in Fo4. At least the change to fireproof has made that slightly less of an issue now. 
---
I hate to say it but I will be doing the same if we don’t see some serious improvement in the coming weeks. The way @Bethesdasupport handles their customers issues regarding marketing and gaming is abhorrent. I would say I encounter some sort of bug/glitch, performance lag, misspelling of terminal entries, lack of what should be an essential feature (e.g marking learned plans) and camp bugs..... oh I don’t know, about once every few minutes. I’m shocked with my perseverance over these 135 hours of play. It’s like someone grabbed a few features, threw them in a concrete mixer and dumped them into the laps of consumers. Pathetic. Let’s take some comfort in that we can join the lawsuit and at least teach them a well deserved lesson. 
---
No, no you cant.
---
No, wait...there's an huge different from legitimate to illigitimate tho. It's an online game, i expect that my grind is rewarded as someone elses one
---
Now I'm thinking about it, there is a Human NPC in FO76: The Mysterious Stranger!

Heh, posted something similar over the weekend and had folks telling me I was wrong. Have an upvote!
---
Yo
---
Well...it's an online game with others, we have to play for that too right? 
---
Is there a reason people aren't doing Licensed Plumber Rank 3 and Gunsmith Rank 1? It saves a TON of perk points, and should add up to 100%, am I missing something here? 
---
Where did you get dem plans, fam?
---
What console are you on man?
---
If your on PS4 I’ll help you my man cause honestly going through a bunker and launching a nuke is hella fun!
---
Psn is Arsinatdawn 
---
The title feels like a light novel title 
---
no idea, I got a mini gun before I hit level 10.  Sucks I could never use it.
---
How pathetic. 
---
Why even play the game?
---
"I don't want to farm. I don't want to make a build with the things I actually find. I just want the best so I can kill everything as easily as possible. That's my idea of fun"
---
How many boards can you fit down there?
---
I'm very close to that spot.  There is a small waterfall and small boat near there (75m) with a acid deposit in the water.   I have my camp there.
---
Sounds like a fun challenge! A word of warning, learning all the Radium Rifle mods is an arduous task! I went trhough and worked out which mod was which and put in a spreadsheet if you want that info :)
---
That was what I was wondering originally when I received the message but it went over fairly well. They "kissed" with the heart emote and then the groom consummated the marriage by teabagging his wife. 
---
Yes duping can be done on console.
---
You can't scrap legendary stuff though?
---
Which also failed miserably.
---
In FO4 and Skyrim your equipped weight made a huge difference in your sneak rating, so being unarmored would be a staggering bonus there. Weightless armor pieces would be valuable there. Like I have an idea for an ideal armor kit, weightless, perception, and reduced weapon weight.
---
I always share rank 3 rad sponge, another team member shares ghoulish, and another one shares the stimpak sharing card. We build off of each other.

IGN: mxranes 
---
I'm level 66 rn so kinda in the same boat and usually play past midnight 
---
Junk runs?
---
But you're still wasting a level just to move your SPECIAL points around.
---
I really think Bethesda should make it so that you at least gain something extra with each level gain.
---
They can compromise by allowing players to move one SPECIAL point for free along with getting perk card for each level. You're not free to move several SPECIAL points whenever you want, but you can at least get a perk card each time you level.
---
*insert pic of a cow*
---
Perhaps.
---
omg this game is amazing
---
That's interesting.
---
I had to find all 15 main motherboards hidden in that area.
---
I didn't have the option of repairing them at the tinker workshop. That would have saved me a lot of frustration and time.
---
lol yup, if u ever find my CAMP, open the porta potty open the door, you might just see a baggie there
---
You should pass this lesson on to your child

"Honey, it's ok to break rules and agreements you make if you want something. Especially if that something may take some time to get. Even if it's not an important thing. Like an imaginary gun"

I have come to detest sirens. 
---
Wow! I thought it was just there for decorative effect. Didn't know they actually worked.
---
Does it have a working terminal? I just saw a quick YouTube clip and it showed that you need to access the terminal first to start it.
---
That seems a bit insane just for duping. Jesus Christ. It really is its own business.
---
Illegally profiting from Bethesda's heavily copyrighted intellectual property without permission?
---
Good. 
---
I would like confirm yes they are available after you finish the quest, just did a couple hops and found them twice, gather 14 on one run and 10 on the other, green thumb perk of course, both times at night, and both times, for me atleast, the event was not present
---
This!
---
Early game quests shouldn't be leading you out of the forest all that much....
---
Partying up is not needed. I play solo for the most part.
---
What weapons are you currently using?
---
Yeah there was an issue with workshops that they patched today. I played for hours and hours today with only one disconnect that was my internet’s problem. 
---
Currently on the nuke mission and honestly can't be bothered to finish it since I've already killed the Scorchbeast Queen anyway.
---
Level 88 120 hours sunk and I honestly don't think there's any more need to play, especially since it will just start to fill with assholes.
---
Still the duper’s for being cheating trash that forced them to take their focus away from other bugs and server issues. 
---
This is some Wasteland Justice if I've ever seen some
---
This has happened to me a lot. I was trying to give this person a set of low level power armor I didn't need and they had no idea what I was saying. I'm over flowing with stims and water and can't even give it away.
---
A chat system would be better, even just a localized one, but I would settle for a gift emote or a microphone emote to let them know I want to talk to them, since 90% of players don't have local voice turned on.
---
Is the area atop the monorail a cramped location? (dont know since I havent been there yet) coz i assume it does an area check given a certain radius, to make sure ur not clipping, which will have an impact on legit locations that are cramped.
---
" And this is where the moral of the story comes in, because I had a  lifesaving legendary armor piece on and as he's celebrating his kill I  get right back up and unload my entire magazine into him as he starts  jumping up and down in fear before he finally dies. "
---
That is fucking awesome.  LOL.  
---
A vats or generally maxed Per/Ag build is no joke with PVP.  Jump and kite all you want like a Rust griefer.  I got your number dialed in and all the leaping in the world isn't going to save you from a deep pool of AP and a good rifle.
---
I have Last Laugh perk swapped in on nuke zones with 5 rank demo expert ( I usually have 2-3 plasma grenades on me for drawing mirelurk queens out of hiding).  I typically run with the hazmat suit and perk in defensive buffs and Green thumb while farming flux in a blast and attacking random enemies. (the two fissures are good for ionized meat, rad fluids and glowing mass from the scorched that respawn often as you lurk.)  I got Last Laugh from a card pack yesterday and swapped it in on a whim during today's fissure prime flora farm.  I got attacked solo by three glowing gulpers, one a \*\*\* legendary and my grenade killed the legendary after I killed the other two and friendly fired myself with an explosive rifle.  I got killed in the blast while incapacitated, but killed the 3 star.  That perk is secretly great, if very situational.  For PVP, I imagine it would be like a Watoga legendary bot blowing up right in your face.  Nobody fucks with the Jesus.
---
Rightly so.
---
This is really amazing, my brother and I recently tried to build a somewhat big CAMP (We're still new and quite low level however) but we hit the budget cap so fast.  
---
We had way less stuff than you, we must be missing something.  
---
It's really mind boggling to me how this is buildable within the budget, it looks so good!  
---
Do you have any evidence of this? 
---
So far this is just an unverified rumour like the trade steal item exploit that didn't actually exist.
---
I thought I was the only one who did this!?
---
So, it's only spoiled food you're gonna find there, but still.
---
I am set up behind Morgantown train station and have found it’s a random encounter spot for passive creatures. It’s been good hunting at low levels for me!
---
I’m dead 😂
---
Agreed my man. I have no problems facing whatever the wasteland throws at me. However I do miss a more strategic play sometimes that TSE weapons just dont deliver.
---
Isn't there an animal tamer perk? I think it might be similar to having a pet. 
---
Heard mentality is a pain in the ass too. :/
---
Well, the trade steal existed to a certain extent.
---
Don't really have any material evidence to the duping thing.
---
I've still never had one person attack my camp....
---
Weird.
---
After launching a nuke there's nothing else to do in the game if you're like me and have done almost every quest. All that's left is grinding nuke zones or somewhere else unless you really like rping or building.
---
See Blizzard vs Bossland
---
He lol'd at a 8.5 million default settlement. Nothing happened.

---
the first time i found grahm i followed grahm for a couple hours and he helped me a lot, lol as i was writing this some friends told me to come over to their server they found him, build my camp ahead of him and trapped him with walls, then he dissapeared :(
---
Yeah it is a very small area up there - mainly catwalks
---
If you want. What one person wants is not what another person will want. It's really up to what you want to do in the game. If you wanna be the highest LvL in the game then sure this game probably isn't for you anymore. You just gotta ask yourself "What do I want to do?" and see if it's a good enough reason for you to buy/play the game
---
Oh cool so like this games mudcrab merchant or the creeper or shady Sam 
---
Cant argue that point. I guess in my mind at the time I was thinking its happened to scrappable and non-scrappable items (dropping).
---
In fact a few times Ive been moving incredibly fast, and think to myself "hang on, Im sure I clicked a button too many times and I might just quickly check that bag.." sure enough its got some fkn rare item in it lol.
---
Same goes for scrapping things. Except your heart sinks cause you aint getting it back xD.
---
Also happens at the vendors frequently too...
---
Well, at least you’re vaguely admitting (indirectly) losing level based caps and trying to buy shit is kind of difficult. 
---
No one high level really enjoys losing a bunch of caps, but I can see how it can get the blood pumping to risk that much. :)
---
My mate has a camp really hidden and whenever we go there we crouch so no players see us
---
yeah guessing the radius area check is too large then, basically mistaking it for someone within geometry when it is not.
---
The ban hammer will come! 
---
Yay. ;)
---
Do I need to be holding eggs for it to appear? Only time I ever saw one was at the lighthouse 
---
Aw, you guys don’t take turns on the nicer one? Tell your husband to share!
---
We know. 
---
Even you Bethesda guys couldnt do better xD
---
Considering online games that have been around for a decade or more still can't solve duping, a few months is nothing.
---
I hope it gets fixed soon then. It's the best base jumping spot in the game (power armor junkie here)
---
So you don’t actually need the pieces? Or do you still need to collect all the numbers to enter the code with?
---
Yea, not much, 20% of  .1
---
Factored after perks apparently
---
I play on XB1 and also had some kind ppl that are now my friends on here. They helped show me where fusion cores are and gave me weapons and ammo. I share knowledge and any items/weapons/ammo I can because of how kind the community is. 
---
Wait this works?
---
Ive seen it from afar, and its huge, am looking forward to leaping off it
---
Near sugar grove out of a zillion logins I had a Tank spawn complete with skeletons of soldiers and ammo boxes.
---
Hero right here 👊
---
I would like confirm yes they are available after you finish the quest, just did a couple hops and found them three times, gather 14 on one run and 10 on the second, 8 on the last green thumb perk of course, twice at night and once during the day, and all times, for me atleast, the event was not present
---
Ok , but it would take down weights a little
---
Thats it let out. Good. Now breathe...
---
It's the best
---
Find a place you’re comfortable with and farm it for a few levels and then continue on with your journey. Creature XP &gt; Quest XP. 
---
Example : Quest (Insert Amount of time Needed) = 200-500xp
---
5-10 Super Mutants, considerably lower time needed and same amount of xp. 
---
If you’re on Xbox I’m starting a new run if you’d like some help! 
---
I am on pc and I got all the shadowed plans. I just kept server hopping at the grafton station to get all the plans. 
---
I wasn't aware that that hid you from the server! Take my upvote to spread that. 
---
It matters , you cant damage wanted player with pacifist "On".
---
Bad luck, I think. I've never had my base attacked in about 215 hours. My camp is huge,  well decorated and I'm always there; a griefers' dream.  Out of curiosity, what platform are you on? 
---
Mind your own business?
---
It only effects people close by?
---
Lol. 
---
So duping effects every player. It breaks an in game economy for a game someone purchased, essentially robbing a player base of a healthy functioning mechanic. 
---
It also hurts the game overall, as an active trading/in game economy can help games thrive.
---
So it's everyone's business and it effects everyone. 
---
It seems the circlejerkers haven't played Fallout 76 OR ps2
---
I started speccing into heavy when I got a furious Gatling and then a buddy gave me an exterminator’s explosive 2 Star Gatling. 
---
Now I have another exterminator’s explosive Gatling with faster reload. 
---
They both do just under 300 damage and I only have rank 3 demo expert. 
---
As unfortunate as it is, I've learned if you're playing an open world pvp game you can expect almost everyone to be a dick since it's pretty much endorsed. Although, it's much more tame in this game. I'm also a super casual so maybe it's different later. It's much more apparent if you're going pretty hard core in a game; you're getting paired up with the younguns, and with the meme/troll state of the internet these days you're pretty much screwed unless you assimilate. 
---
Sounds like somebody’s got a case of the Mondays
---
Teeny bit, yes
---
If you stack 5 armor bits of the same, they'll be 0
---
You're looking in the wrong place, science wing, not the others.
---
On what do you base this assumption? Level come extremely fast in this game.
---
Ok , thanks thats good to know 
---
They sell at the White Spring bunker, as in the Enclave Bunker not the vendors in actual White Springs. Not sure how far through the game you are to spoil it for you but they dont sell serums in the actual White Springs resort.
---
With class freak 3* on heard mentality has no disadvantages. The stats don't update on the pip boy tho.
---
had the bunker vendor on my mind, no idea why i said white springs vendors instead.
---
That's why I've turned much more casual lately in games. Fortnite is a great example. It first came out and I was mediocre at best. Next thing I know I'm getting killed by everyone after they build a fortress in 5 seconds. Maybe this is my "I'm getting old" moment, im not hot shit at video games anymore. 
---
FO76 doesn't justify a market?
---
Any game where you can trade items justifies a market. 
---
Hell Rocket League , a game where you play soccer with a rocket powered car has benefited greatly from an active trading communtiy...
---
Healthy markets help games thrive. 
---
the taming feature kind of gets you as close to having a pet as having a dinosaur in your backyard, the softest creature you can get is basically a giant frog. i think op meant like pets as in dogs, cats and other normal animals, not deathclaws
---
Technically you can. There is a perk (I don’t know what though) that allows you to tame animals and sometimes send them to your base, if you have enough budget space that is. This means you can even have a pet deathclaw or something defending you camp
---
Tbh I prefer the 50. Cal machine gun anyways. Slower rate of fire but it melts shit.
---
Is this in the Seneca ridge? Bc my buddy and I ran ourselves ragged trying to hunt a dude down over there the other day, never did find him.
---
Tamed animals mean you can have a 'pet' creature that lives in your camp and will spawn in with it (they are actually are part of the camp budget).
---
Can have a pet Mega Sloth, deathclaw, snallygaster, bears, frog, Mirelurk king and a few others.
---
They dont follow you around outside of the camp though. Hopefully one day ;)
---
Well, I think the backlit posters count to. People have said anything producing light is resource intensive so has a higher budget cost.
---
Not yet, just a small municipality.
---
Wow, freaking awesome!  I'm only level 34 and I haven't explored all the Appalachia yet but I think most of advanced camps are in the south-est part of the map. 
---
Yeah I read "unpack the DLLs..." 
---
Pass
---
Man i don't want to be the first in the game, i want a fair competition; if i play X hours, i want to maximize them, i want to see my efferts are worth... i think it's what everything wants from a game. If you don't have the motivation, or if you see your efforts are not even close to be worth, then you can't really spend hours playing!
---
You only need a keycard, not the code pieces.  
---
i’d say you kind of missed the train, everyone knows this already
---
It hasn't changed much on PC since patch. Since they fixed the fusion cores recharging when you log,  you go through them quick as Hell with just normal power armor usage. Took a power plant workshop twice tonight to make cores and twice was booted within 15 min. One a crash to desktop, one a server disconnect. Now I'm done to 3 cores and have to desire tonlog on and try make more.
---
If you use sun kissed with cannibal and ghoulish it works perfectly. No need for stimpacks, radaways and medical perks.
---
How extravagant that adventure was!
---
This has been an issue since beta, experienced this one myself. The guy was meshed under the map with a very high bounty but same story as you, we couldn’t find him, or at least at first. We looked around for a minute until we found his sloppy entry point. After finding ourselves under the map we located a the player sleeping in his bed in his hidden mesh base. As we made our way down this mess of a maze to collect the bounty, guy starts talking shit calling us noobs amongst other vulgarities and disconnects from server leaving us talking from the sky. 
---
The cherry on top that we missed was the door we saw at the bottom of the stairs. Almost certainly this guys was fishing for noobs to flag themselves for pvp to get in. 
---
The whole situation sucked. We were baited by a blatant cheater and as it happens in many ways, we weren’t even able to make the caps back we spent getting there.
---
This is a real issue.
---
Fuck people who dupe the letter P in "dupers" when writing these useless shitposts.
---
Mmm need to try and experiment. Thanks
---
Why did you censor the first ‘shit’ but then proceed to unleash a tirade of further swear words lmao 
---
I guess that depends on preference. My team tends to stick near Harpers Ferry/Watoga due to vendor proximity.
---
This. 
---
The misconception is that anything in any special edition actually retains value. 
---
Add that to the fact that they are most likely to sell the most expensive editions to big time fans, who likely are buying the game on or right near launch it leaves few potential customers willing to buy those editions a few months later. 
---
They just want to get what they can, while they can. 
---
&gt; He opened our encounter the best way possible, by jumping in front of my explosive shotgun killing me and taking all of my loot. 
---
See this mechanic bothers me (and I've bitched about it before) because even if you had pacifist on others still have a way of killing you and looting you dry with no negative effects to them. I'll probably get downvoted to oblivion again but instead of dropping a nondescript bag it should be a body that appears that can be looted, but if you loot someones body you get set to PVP active (or whatever it's called, where you turn "Red").
---
Current system encourages exploiting loopholes and being able to get away with it without the affected player being able to even have a **chance** to get their stuff back.
---
(Suggesting showing a body instead of bag because as someone pointed out, showing a bag doesn't give any indication as to whether the person has just dropped stuff, or if they died somehow).
---
Yeah I'd take a dog over a deathclaw, not saying they wouldn't make other pets but taking him for a walk could be problematic.
---
I've only fought the SBQ once by this point at level 68. The group I was with the first time couldn't kill it. We were all too focused on the ground enemies and such. The second time was different. People seemed to be more focused on the ground enemies, but a few including myself focused almost entirely on the SBQ. For me it was an incredibly nerve-wracking event. My best weapon was a Bloodied Gatling gun, so I refused to heal myself until I was certain I would die so I could get the most amount of damage. A risky tactic sure, but it seemed to work. That SBQ went down in 15 minutes. Can't wait for another opportunity. Having a few focusing on separate targets seemed to work. Great idea.
---
Whaddup whitches
---
Considering your  "absolute trash heap of a game" comment about FO76, I don't see why even bothered to post the comment, if you don't like it, go play Fortshite or CoD, you might be happier.  
---
I suspect posting such a comment was just to get a reaction or rise out of someone, which you did, well done you.  
---
Right, I'm going back to FO76 for some more exciting gameplay.
---
Buy from other players
---
They can drop from queen
---
Much less than the 20k or whatever you can buy for at bunker
---
So when did ordinary PVP encounters become griefing? 
---
They attacked your base.... You engaged. They died. They came back for revenge. A back and forth battle for scrap/caps ensued.... Until one side gave up...
---
No shit is had no evidence. No one is going to teach you how to do it kid. I know now that your youtubers who were showing you step by step how to do it are getting banned your desperate but no one is going to walk you through it. Only people who need evidence is Bethesda.
---
I could add you but im not realy often online and would just do it for the mutation and perks if thats ok
---
Why do you have one lol
---
This goes above and beyond the typical pvp in video games. Attacking someone's camp has zero monetary or in game benefit beyond beings dick.
---
The real reclamation day is reclaiming the game from the dupers.
---
Can you not use a Terminal instead of the second switch? Terminals can be 'locked' like a door(but require hacking to force), and using them, you can operate switches on the same network.
---
I want to believe that everyone was invited and you just crashed the wedding. Epic. 
---
Tradertron at Harper's Ferry. 420 caps. I took some Charisma chems but the price didn't change. Needs a lot of concrete, looks great.
---
According to the wiki footnotes:
---
 The Class Freak perk card seems to have a bug on the effects page of the Pip-Boy, where it isn't showing any reduction to the Empath and Herd Mentality negative effects while it is for the other mutations. For the Herd Mentality it seems only a visual bug, the negative effect of having SPECIAL reduced by 2 when solo and in combination of rank 3 Class Freak doesn't reduce SPECIAL at all when equip. For the Empath negative effect, this is a confirmed bug, the +33% of damage to player is not reduced at all.
---
[Source](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_mutations)
---
So yeah. No disadvantages at all when class freak is on. Great little mutation haha.
---
I have a two shot Gauss.
---
Haha I notice this too, every time I change server or relog, if I have technical data on my, one its always drop from the butt lol. Nice to known im not crazy
---
Death to all dupers!!!!! And yeah please ban them too
---
I'm not sure it's because of dupers but my roommate got 6 server reroll yesterday. it's may be a problem if it's confirmed
---
It does nothing afaik
---
Are you fucking kidding me?
---
First off go look at all my other posts about two topics
---
My Hardline stance on punishing dupers.
---
And my blatant disgust for wild speculation and unfounded rumour being pushed as truth in this sub. 
---
I'm pointing out that this sub has had a problem with "exploits" in the past that turned out to not even exist. See the trade/steal items "exploit".
---
Also note. You don't need step by step walkthroughs to have evidence. That assumption is beyond fucking moronic. 
---
I’m level 89 and have yet to get a TSE, last nuke zone I got two vampire items, a pick axe and a wood axe. Then I proceeded to get a pool cue that does some rubbish and a normal drill from a 3 star
---
Nope, its bugged and a known bug to Bethesda.
---
Some people hand out or try to sell dev room items to players. It can be hard to know what is and is not allowed with them.
---
Gotta be super careful with any item your unsure of.
---
Omg, and Im here missing those +2 specials sweet point! Thanks a lot!
---
Asking for a friend...
---
So, with time, this mutation its gonna be fixed and you are gonna be penalized correctly? Thts bad news.
---
Yes has happened to me.
---
The officer UA lowers my T-60 PA stats by a fair chunk (rad/dam/eng resists) and the stats I get from the UA dont add on to existing stats when in the Power Armour - Not sure if the stats are meant to stack so that could be intended.
---
On PS4 btw so it might change in the latest patch but I've not read anything on it either way.
---
At the moment class freak does not reduce the negative effect of herd mentality, in future it should afaik
---
No problem man. I only found out myself last night.
---
76 really shines at this. 
---
Being able to play out your own motivations. For me it's role playing, but I really like your permadeath idea, and I'm going to roll it into my roleplay characters in the future to really strengthen that person's motivations and goals.
---
And a lawsuit
---
I do this a lot and always come across some ama builds
---
Found the plan for the gatling gun last night so I need to make a few to get the mods (hopefully) but it does seem a whole lot BETTER than the mini gun and the gatling laser (for the 4 seconds i get to use it before it breaks) so with a few extra mods other than the wonky sights I think it'll be my go to weapon unless I find a legendary weapon :) 
---
Sure, send me the info and I'll add it to the spreadsheets above.
---
I got one already. Sorry
---
... Then she is made of wood!
---
Please elaborate on "looking at the CAMP". Are you sure it wasn't just the camp owner you were looking at?
---
It only really benefits a bloodied build, as well as some non-combat activities.
---
To save on acid, I usually farm West Tek and (similar places while I wait for respawns) for steel. Looting everything from the mutants and scrapping at the end of each run. This gets me around 2000 steel pretty fast. With 3 acid extractors in Hemlock Holes Maintenance and a trip to Lucky Hole mine I usually get 5-8K 5.56 rounds per farming occasion.
---
Farming West Tek is basically free ammo wise, since every mutant takes 1-3 shots to kill and drops around 5x5.56. Also, I've ecountered up to 4 legendary enemies in there.
---
Yeah, I have seen two people post that the "newest" duping comes from causing the server to fail and rollback.
---
I think that was just fake meant to stir up controversy.  No evidence.
---
I'd recommend starting the mistress of mysteries quest by going to the summer villa east of the capitol building or inside the capital building (if you find a female corpse wearing a black and green dress loot the holotape and veil to start the quest) 
---
T60. Cheapest to repair and mod
---
Maybe with class freak you will lose -1 only...., I think i lwait til is fixed for take the decition on getting that one. Thanks!
---
LOL who gives a fuck? Play Fallout 4 you will have much better nicer looking homes with mods. 76 looks so fucking terrible
---
Love it. The fact that you being smart about it (removing your armour) and did not react angrily is what these griefers hate. A lesson we all can learn from.
---
Yeah i almost thought so
---
But with the build limit are you able to decorate inside the buildings at all? 
---
Duping is still a thing, dumbo
---
Did you even play other games? Fallout 76 looks so fucking terrible 
---
That's why I play as a Mercenary to hunt down you raider scum lol. 
---
eventually if you play long enough you could have a character who keeps a graveyard of all your other dead characters
---
Use that when you craft a set of power armor along with any other int buffs you can get to raise the max durability. 
---
If you're leeching legendaries in whitespring you could also use it to boost your luck to get more max durability on them, but be careful. 
---
You can also use it to boost chr to get a better price on big ticket items like serum recipes. 
---
All things considered I picked out a good lightweight set of it to keep in my stash and then modded them all to be ultra light so it'd a tiny burden to my stash. 
---
Wow just wow
---
I am happy to see people taking time to build a nice house like this!
---
You inspire me. I'll do what I can but I'll need more blueprints!
---
I hope people don't attack your home because this is a masterpiece 
---
That's the only place in the game that Raider armor and Raider power armor plans can spawn. If you want them all you'll have to start new characters and repeat Signal Strength over and over. That's a terrible grind.
---
Yup lol 
---
There is a very excellent place North-North-West , with a junk extractor, almost no mobs spawning (bloodbugs and a few feral ghouls), all workshop prebuilt in reasonable distance (including a power armor station that spawns an armor), and much vegetables.
---
The only thing missing is water, but you can be set with a pump and a station so it doesn't really matter.
---
Thing is, most of the current endgame is south-east, so indeed people tend to gather there.
---
&gt;while it was good
---
best joke I've heard all day
---
Well the extra agility gives you better stealth and AP.     
---
The extra perception helps you hit in VATs. 
---
The extra Str helps you carry more guns / ammo. 
---
The extra Int helps you repair your weps with a higher durability. 
---
And as you are running low HP for unyielding you can then also run nerd rage perk and the adrenal reaction mutation for more ranged damage.     
---
The drawback is low HP makes you easier to kill.. but you're ranged so you have an advantage there regarding avoiding damage :)    
---
And honestly bloodied ranged weps arent nearly as good as two shots. Even for low HP builds.     
---
I have a character who is BOS all the way he uses t60 armor with initiate paint and when not in armor the engineer outfit with welding helmet. I run round with hot mic "hail citizen need you any help?" Usually they run away. Wierd.
---
 Another guy is decked out in all the enclave scout armor. His theme is enclave super soldier. (Marsupial and adrenal rush)
---
Yep, I remember ;)
---
It can have value in the form of robust role play. 
---
I've played many a campaign where a player has betrayed a party which benefitted them in no real way aside from creating a more interesting, rich story.
---
One fellow dweller point in this same post, that its bugged now and a known one from Bethesda, so maybe in a future patch wven fixed, can take -1 from all stats, its ok i guess, but maybe i ll wait a couple of updates and see how works. Thanks!
---
1. PC
---
2. KingpinZero
---
3. No video proof
---
4. Yesterday near Mossotown i was ambushed by a Scorched Beast. I fought against it for a while, it was a long fight, i killed it with a Gatling Laser. The corpse of the beast pulverized in air and the remains clipped thru the floor, i wasn't able to loot it. Same thing applies where i have my C.A.M.P, near Uncanny Caverns, there's a Fissure. Everytime i spend alot of time and resources fighting these beasts only to not being able to loot them. This is frustrating.  
---
I've been killed near Thundermountain two days ago in a strange way, i think it was a server lag. Basically in a blink of an eye i was downed and without even the possibility to ask for a revive, everything happened too fast. What's strange though is that once i respawned, my Death icon wasn't there neither my stash of things, and i've lost all the materials i was farming. This really got on my nerves, it's the second time that happens.  
---
Another problem is that since last patch, with framerate unlocked, my characters gets stuck and i'm unable to walk in closed areas/buildings anymore. I can make it walk again by repeadly turning ON and OFF the light of my Power Armor/Pip boy.  
---
This happens in every condition, being in PA or not, being encumbered or not, it's really frustrating and basically game breaking. This happens with or without framecap, vsync and so on.
---
5. No Ticket, haven't opened it yet.
---
Thanks
---
As another comment said and same thing thing I just learned making a heavy guns build, you can and should lean on melee to build ammo and just bring that to the big bad fight. Incisor, martial arts, and at least the first rank of all 3 slugger tiers, get All Rise quested super sledge and 1 rank in adrenaline if you can budget for it, rock some power armor and you’ll be able to hang just about anywhere and save up rounds. 
---
Lead extractor was a another good suggestion, along with enclave events they give a lot of cash (cloth) you can use with acid to make gunpowder. 
---
If your gonna go big, farm some mini nukes(I make em cheap), get the mirv or "two shot(920dmg)" like me hehe. Go to either whitesprings or prime and use it on everything in whitesprings and then only crowd control in prime cause the queen doesnt take explosion damage. Use ballistic or other on her. Prime queen your gonna need a crew or someone with super high gauss rifle, shotgun, plasma etc...
---
Oh nice! I've been thinking about making my own faction, not enclave or raiders or bos. I just haven't really buckled down and fully fleshed it out. But it's awesome to know we have BoS soldiers out helping others!
---
This is absolutely needed!
---
I've been killing the queen a lot recently so I've ended up bogged down with loads of flux and just resources in general so I've taken to making shielded vault jumpsuits and heavy leather armour to give out.
---
The only way to even point out the fact that the bag is there is to aim your gun at it, or shoot it. And so many of them run away the moment you even pull the gun out! 
---
4500 without perk. 
---
this is a perfect idea like having a pet companion could work even without dlcs as they aren't humans so it could work and you should be able to customise them in the design and breed
---
lvl 164 and I've done every quest but luckily there is actually a lot of stuff around the map most people don't know about. If your into exploring then just load up on supplies and go for a walk. Never know what you will find until you find it :)
---
Why not just keep it and just charge to create them for people?
---
Game was available for 30$ before release, and it went lower. It's really not that hard to buy if you have some money.
---
I have a harder time understanding how that even remotely comes close to the definition of "fun".
---
If you're not dealing at least 500dmg a hit/shot then stay out of the queen fight. Had about 5 I launched this weekend past where she was buffed to hell because of level 20s and whatnot.
---
Maaan this one is pretty hard to get, I would sell you mine if the offer is high enough.. how does 7600 caps sound?
---
Wait... what if you have rank 2 class freak along with herd mentality? That would be a whole number
---
Its dependent on luck
---
is this even possible? isn’t there an achievement to play for a whole year? i think it was 8k hours or so?
---
*points finger* 
---
/pod ppl screech
---
The actual C.A.M.P. object every player must place to build a camp. When you look at it, it says "xx_bOuNtYsLuT_xx's C.A.M.P." or whoever is the owner.
---
they r just idiot scammers.. simply no point of pvp in this game should be removed.
---
how to repair ur shit without costs if destroyed:
---
1. get a friend and ask him to make alt
---
2. ask him to travel ur destroyed camp
---
3. logout
---
4. ask him to place their camp there
---
5. join back to their server
---
6. u got message ur camp can't be palced
---
7. join to other server
---
8. ur camp is repaired and placed
---
9. bonus u can use his alt as mule charater
---
or simple just move ur camp for 40cap, relog and move it back to another 40cap.
---
sometimes when i low level players i also give them plans or ammo that i don't use.
---
I would be down, had to take a break from the game, I haven't had as much fun playing solo, would be fun to be in a group
---
100% this so bad.
---
u dont need legndary weapon to detroy camps just hammer and 3 workshop destoryer card...
---
or leave it as a bag and just have it named differently...its hard enough to find something i killed in grass...dont need to have the same issue with my own corpse lol.
---
Just don’t forget to sleep ! 5% exp is HUGE un this excellent game!
---
Yes, you can. Fwiw, the excavator power armor needs to be complete to get the 100lbs carry weight increase.
---
Enclave officer with assaultron helmet becuase I am a government machine
---
They probably will to satisfy the masses. Id join for sure.
---
Lewisburg picnic tables is decent 
---
Try Camden as well.
---
How about this FALLOUT 76 BATTLE ROYALE FROM LEATHER ARMOR TO T-60 POWER ARMOR AND 10 MM PISTOLS TO MINI NUKES 10/10 PROBABLY WOULDN’T BE TERRIBLE
---
Lol damn! I wore the enclave general outfit with a sentry bot helmet for a long time.
---
Saw someone with the Marine Helmet yesterday. The armour version not the wetsuit "spiderman" mask.     
---
I suspect thats only from the dev room too right? 
---
Awesome haha my other favourite is the straight jacket and Faschnacht Man mask
---
Love this game
---
Nah pretty sure that's ingame
---
That always seems to be a classic!
---
Yeah that's definitely the mothman. I've encountered at least 3-4 times including once at my base and he always leave that tell tale puff of black smoke when he flies away.
---
That's how mafia works 
---
Yes, thats the problem i had. I pulled my gun out to aim at it and thats when they ran away. I was just trying to help :(
---
Did have the ritual mask for a long time too 
---
Same!
---
But was it easier ? I heard rumor her vita scale with the amount of player, so I'd rather take her solo than with 18 level 20-60 if that's true.
---
you can add me if you planing on doing main quest stuff. the only problem right now is that I don't have a mic. 
---
Spacesuit with skull mask
---
Ritual mask is always my favorite 
---
When I do weapons mods, I compare each of the specs against each other based on
---
Damage
---
Range 
---
Accuracy
---
And weight.
---
Some mods look like they’re the same but it’s impacted by 1 or more of those 4 when it’s all set.
---
This bug happens to me pretty much all the time after my first initial sneak critical, and whilst i can still kill things eventually, its really effecting my enjoyment of the game...
---
Weird but neat combo!
---
Good tactics, I'm lvl 70 but am melee, never done the prime zone but will handle the mobs for people next time 
---
And yet the camp items are pristine.  They should switch this around 😂
---
Well one of the duping methods involved the artillery piece and the ammo box.   Another part of it could be the the workshops causing the DC.  By patching the workshop it could seal off yet another of the duping methods.
---
So if they solidify both server and client, that does seem to be good IMO.
---
Amazing concept!  The black and bronze look really nice together.
---
Are they really? Wow
---
Much cheaper than I thought
---
How the fuck do you legit down her in 5 min ? Not an accusation, this is a question. We've tried a few times, she always eludes us : flying around for half the battle, bringing to many highlevel monsters around, ... 
---
We almost had her a few days ago, but she left with maybe 3-5% of life remaining -_-
---
The [Camden Park uniform and faded visor](https://imgur.com/FzlLRem) seemed to fit together.
---
Probably it works just like the nuked flora staying on whitesprings after the radiations expire.
---
That looks like a lot of fun :) 
---
Bawnjorno.
---
Or a Look DOWN emote lol
---
Great, now Bethesda is going to look at this and never increase the CAMP budget lol.
---
I have a 2x1 level home, 1 water purifier, 1 generator,  2 turrets, and a bunch of plants for my adhesive farm, and I am maxed out with no stored items. 
---
Interesting thought, ive also noticed along with another player that the active perks might favour the legendary drop type.   
---
For me just a week ago I would get combat knifes, even tho I switched servers.
---
With class freak there is no negative. 
---
I've read that before but have looked at several and never once saw a name. (PC)
---
Its all about when you launch it. If its between 2am and 4pm CST then chances are you wont get many people. But outside that time frame...chances are your nuke zone will be flooded with low levels. I've personally given up on that stuff though, not because we don't kill her (Can solo in about 15 minutes) but because I never get anything good. After 100+ SBQ kills the best thing I've gotten is flux.
---
Wait so he and all of his friends did barely any damage to you (slap damage) but you and your shotgun "blew away his head"? 
---
Right. How long did you have to shoot him for, an hour?
---
If only those low levels actually checked the reddit threads to see this.
---
Good luck! This is one of my fave aspects of this game :)
---
It probably sounds silly but my endgame goal for 76 isn't killing Scorchbeasts, it's putting together enough plans and items to make something like this for fellow wastelanders!
---
I'd love to create an authentic looking little camp with tents and guard posts etc. Your build is inspirational, thanks for sharing!
---
Well I have not had many of the duping-induced-lag episodes after the patch.   You can really tell when going through a cave and you get Server Controls Not Responding every 10 seconds.   You cannot fight at all anymore.
---
Have not had this happen yet after patch.
---
I dont believe you. 
---
You can't shoot people from under the map or if you are inside a building, you can't shoot out either.
---
I’ve got 2 for my alt, lvl 45 raider, lvl25 t45. Still to low to wear. Lolz
---
https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Excavator+Power+Armor
---
Did you hear. We are getting one.... it just hasnt officially been announced.
---
Me too. Repaired two turrets which were then working. Went inside and came back out 3 seconds later and they are broken again. Nothing had attacked. Now I don't have enough resources to fix.
---
On god?
---
Reality is leg. effects *and* perk cards should just not apply to pvp, with weap's only doing their base damage.
---
Would still be a min./max weapon, but this 1 shot business would be a thing of the past.
---
YES! ANYTHING! I mean make the bags more noticeable or create a sound when we drop a bag! We just need something! 
---
Need Karma.
---
Fair competition starts and ends at lvl 50. After that it's all about grinding gear. With new content coming, it's easy to assume better gear is coming. With that in mind it's not too hard to stay competitive 
---
I think the rollbacks on server side are a good thing if they attempt the duping.   I think some of the duping methods involve getting the server to get laggy but retain items when person gets DCd.  When person returns they character got a slight rollback and has the drop item again, but the item still exists on server where they dropped it/stashed it.   With a server rollback, the item will not exist on server.  Its not 100%, but I think its good defense.

Hey are you selling the Responders Fireman Helmet? If not caps i have serums to trade

Happened to me last night. Granted, my camp was in a bad place. I made it too visible. I needed to get to 4 areas for my quest so I thought I'd smack my camp down right in the middle. *Obviously*, this was a bad choice. Lots of randos coming in and AFK'ing, using my workshops, or spamming invites. One dude comes in and smacks me, smacks the AFK'd rando, then sends a team invite. I prefer to play solo, so I declined. Then he lights the AFK'd up. Dead in 10 seconds. Wanted. He chases me around my camp, but I'm a pacifist with 30+ stimpacks. I figure he'll tire out and move on. Then, I get players coming in from all areas, and I think they're coming to grab the bounty. Nope, they all turn on me. Grenades being thrown at my camp and I'm being shot from all angles... I noped the heck right out of that server. Logged back in and moved my camp ASAP. 
---
It's annoying. 
---
He was obviously sarcastic?;)
---
Got an upvote from me. This community can be seriously toxic at times. I mean, I'm one of the biggest Fallout whores and I've stopped playing the game in hopes of coming back to a better experience. That being said I put a solid 300+ hours got everything legit i.e. grinding and server hopping TSE double barrel and X 01 Jetpack. I can't use them tho because my game on base PS4 blue screens about every 15-20 minutes. It's bad. 
---
I just checked it about 10 minutes ago on PS4. Works as stated. 
---
I hope this isn't something they changed in the patch. Dont remember seeing anything in the notes about it, and it would be a shame if they took it out. Sometimes I'll track down players who have built impressive or unique camps and try to gift them gear and snacks. Without knowing who owns it, that would be impossible
---
I found one not too long ago, shot it once and it disappeared
---
The minigun and gatling laser are both trash atm with how poor their damage is. Not even a two shot version of them is worth bothering with. The only heavy weapons you want to use are the gatling gun, gatling plasma, .50 cal lmg, and maybe the MG42 lmg (expensive ammo). Do be warned that the gatling plasma will break pretty damn quickly, but the damage is quite nice.
---
Also, don't bother with the damn munitions workshop. Look for iron and lead ore and loot the nodes while wearing Excavator armor, and smelt them with acid. 1000 times faster. You will have to farm acid though.
---
I just started playing last night, I don't have loads of time to play but this sounds fun.
---
I'll possibly join if my own intentions for the wasteland line up.
---
No sorry. No way I will sell it for anything.
---
Says no one 
---
Curator doubles the 1 hour duration.   How are you getting 2 hours without curator?
---
I wouldn't care for the mode in the slightest but suppose it wouldn't hurt me if it did exist. it could also  bring more money in which means more content for all of us. 
---
The sheer number of people who seem to genuinely enjoy being a dick to other people playing games just depresses me.
---
I have no problem whatsoever with PvP - as in two or more persons of similar levels, skills and equipment going toe to toe. That's exciting and fun and pretty much what online gaming is all about.
---
I will never understand the 'thrill' of pummeling someone who has no hope of putting up a decent fight. That's just evidence of a personality disorder on the part of the attacker.
---
I've said this in many subs for games with a PvP component in the past and each time someone pops up to try and justify it in whatever way they've been able to justify to themselves that being an absolute tool to another human being is ok.
---
Awesome!!
---
No worries brother, there is a lot to remember in this game!
---
I saw that player earlier today, on PC right? Level 434 or something with a 2,050 cap bounty. Saw the bounty and thought maybe, then decided nahhh.
---
Then this game just becomes another online shooter like Call of Duty.
---
My character wears urban operative under armour, sturdy shadowed combat armour chest and both legs, heavy studded/shadowed leather arms and sentry bot helmet
---
Got a stack of spare fusion cores if you need a boost  to keep you PA equipped for a while. Tarnowski1 on pc and  on most nights from 7pm UK times. Usually mic enabled post 9pm. 
---
It was preserved with rads
---
BR is the weirdest gaming phenomenon. In paper it sounds fun, but in reality it is not, but still thousands experience those games as I see them in paper, and are having fun.
---
To me BR games feel like there is nothing to achieve(except new T-shirt), and the whole mode is always really "superficial" and dull.  
---
Once again, thanks to you all for the great work!
---
As compared to the absolute mess we have now?
---
Ooo the dark look
---
Made my day. 10/10.
---
Skys the limit for B. What if I told you that B. was planning to introduce an area that cost caps to enter? And that you could form teams as well and play?
---
Annnnd there will be a real ladder type scoreboard system with RL prizes?
---
You pulled all of this out of your ass
---
Fuck Nitrado! overpriced garbage servers! I stick to Gportal and that not only because i work for them in my free time!
---
Same. I hardly ever disconnect on PS4 in the UK. Perhaps on average once every seven or eight hours
---
You want to go around teaching a bunch of morons to boil water and cook meat before they ingest it?
---
Are you on xbox cause ill take it
---
I mean I have bo4 and rdr2 just came out with a br but I couldn’t care less about those, but this could be interesting 
---
Hahaha all gee I just realised you are on ps4.
---
Where did you happen to get it from
---
I am
---
It is just purely amazing what can happen in a server so unexpectedly 
---
I feel you, I’ve tried fortnite, I have bo4, rdr2 just came out with one, but this I might actually give a shot, the paper version does sound promising, but ultimately it does come down to actual game play
---
Me and a few friends did something similar to this recently.
---
We took a 2x2 room, surrounded the inside of the room with the yellow wooden stash boxes 6 high, with absolutely no gaps in the wall.
---
 I used solid wood floors to seal in our guy with the bounty. The cost of the room took about 1/3rd of the over all budget, then just added a normal functioning base around it. Since it was my base anyone who attacked it gained a bounty trying to get our guy inside.
---
The room inside has so far been indestructible except for one time. Some got smart and used a nuke grenade, from what we gathered the aoe of the grenade managed to kill our guy inside.
---
Sounds cool
---
Diluted stimpacks are non-junk category, though. So OP would have to jump really high, go into inventory to attempt to drop the stuff while in mid-air before he succumbs to the fissure.
---
I played an hour today. One crash to desktop, one server diconnect. Some loading screens quick, some locking for about 30 seconds before suddenly starting again. 
---
I'm not looking for a rollback myself. Just for them to really focus on the stability issues.
---
I've got a Lifesaver piece too. It's gotten me out of a few jams.
---
I haven’t seen it anywhere :0
---
&gt; Crafting: Ballistic Fiber also is now required for repairing armor at level 25 and above instead of previously at level 20
---
This is the reason I quit. This dumb material shouldn't even be a thing. Shouldn't be required anywhere
---
A little late, but hunters hood exists, hunters pelt too but i haven't personally seen it.
---
Been pretty much my look since about level 30 (now level 91) with only slight changes. Have Marine Armour and 2 sets of Power Armour and a few other outfits (kept for future role-playing )but hardly use them and  stick with whats below.

i think its underground as it sounds like the sort of place you'd put a dev room
---
Ultracite has best ballistic resistance, but x01 has best total resistance. 51B torso is best torso there is. But both ultracite and x01 mods are really hard to find. Of course you can mix and match as you please.
---
usually this happens with using VATS as melee to kill wall turrets 
---
This, too.
---
I guess to a newbie I must look pretty suspicious in my Excavator armour, dropping my little sweetie bags on the ground.
---
Selling somebody's intellectual property (duped items) without the owner's consent is illegal. But really difficult to enforce. It's not dissimilar to internet piracy.
---
Nice, now we just need a way to compare it with what my character know ingame to easily see what im missing.
---
&gt; I think a lot of people forget how bad PS2 graphics are.
---
They absolutely do if they think 76 looks anything like PS2 games.
---
Oh, I thought I recognised that spot! Do you not find that the rad-cows spawn inside the house on occasion? I put a little tent C.A.M.P. there and the damn things were inside it more often than they were out of it!
---
Fantastic build though! I actually get quite a Sims vibe from it :)
---
I would imagine this being a permanent corpse until the player loots it/dies again/disconnects. Or at least a longer timer - most games with a similar mechanic have a 10 - 15 minute body timer before it despawns. 
---
Abraxo Cleaner has Acid as a component I think. Also bloatfly glands.
---
You need hacking and lockpicking. Maxxed. I can shut down  robobrains and turrets. Or i f u prefer total chaos remove targeting restrictions from turrets lol.  Also fuck alpha silo. Seems to be the most glich infested silo in the game. At least imo. Don't disconnect from others but that one very often. I think if you die  the mainframes go in your  junk bag. May be where they went. I also accidentally turned mine into ammo once.
---
I did get the exact same legendary in a twenty-minute spam once. It was an an instigating flamethrower I think.
---
If anyone comes out of a single whiterun run with 6 TSE's I think the most plausible explanation is that he is a duper, or byus dupes, but wont admit to it. I could be wrong. Only pattern I have noticed myselfe is that most of the legendary drops are useless armor stuff. 
---
this is my main issue too, best thing I can think to do to draw attention to it is shoot ground near bag an they piss their pants and run off.
---
I think it's a random encounter, but disturbing the eggs really should have a chance of getting Mothman to stalk you.
---
I probably wouldn't play much myself, but that would be fun once in a while.
---
I'm sure it would be interesting to some people! BRs just aren't my type of game, I'm not really into PvP in general. As I said though not against the idea as long as some people get a kick out of it.
---
The other games have a better economy and ammo in vendors... to be fair.
---
Yea, I’ve got some games that have battle royale modes that I haven’t touched, it’s not really my style, but I could see myself jumping on it every once in a while
---
Imagine 64 players getting airdropped from Brotherhood vertibirds and scatter across the Appalachia in search for weapons. Then proceed killing each other as the radiation zone is closing in on them until only one survivor is left standing. 
---
I feel it's a novel idea and would like the full credit for it :-)
---
Some griefers are roleplaying as ‘raiders’.
---
Play silly games, win silly prizes.
---
Yea, I feel like it would be to serve as a way for people to pvp with their favorite weapons with out the risk of getting hunted down by angry players
---
Pvp is a big joke anyone who destroys a camp is just being bored or just being a ass. 
---
Only 3600 or so with rank 3 Hard Bargain, it's a pretty reasonable cost to get just the right ones for your build. 
---
But does ingame currency count as selling? Obviously the PayPal plebs are breaking the law.
---
Seems to be a recurring theme with basically every single energy gun
---
Read the post lol
---
bethesda banning people using exploits i see nothing wrong here
---
Hahaha fuck im blind. Cheerd bruv
---
you cant buy raider protective and shielded only from events and random drops star monster streamer chests
---
What are you doing with my broom?
---
I have set mine up in Survey Camp Alpha. Always has scorchbeasts spawning and walk 30 seconds south there's a mirelurk nest with kings and a queen.
---
Downside as I found out last night its a popular nuke zone, now I have a well located pile of ashes.
---
You can make fertilizer outta spoiled meat though.
---
Teaming up does help. 3 of my friends got the game this weekend and I got them all to lvl 10 in like 2 hrs just farming low level locations. Ex. West Virginia Saw Mill (upper northwest corner of the Forest), Pleasant Point( East of Flatwoods home of the Mothman Museum),and the prison just north of Morgantown. Sleep when you can to get that exp boost. Do low lvl events like collision course they give pretty decent amounts of exp plus weapons, armor, ammo, and such. 
---
The terrible accuracy of two shots in vats makes bloodied much better imo.
---
"What if we had Battle Roya--"

As a guy who built his own dog sanctuary in Fallout 4, uses the beagle picture over his bed in 76, am all for pets! But please can we have a Beagle if you do Bethesda! (Yes, i have a Beagle)
---
Gg wp. It's a satisfying feeling.
---
People were having experiences like this in games for decades lol.. best game how 
---
Silly Responders. Dontcha know civilization as you know it is gone? It went kaput! There ain't no rules out there no more. You got to take what you can get now, even if that means offing some folks just to survive. So keep living in that fantasy of yours, while the rest of live in the real world where only the strong can come out on top. 
---
Why bother with "Chameleon" and go through trouble obtaining 5 pieces of weightless pieces, when you can just get 1 piece of gear, with Chameleon effect.
---
Explore the Forest from top to bottom. You shouldn't get many high level enemies there. The next safest region is the Ash Heap. Elsewhere the presence of high-level players may spawn high-level enemies (I quite like this, it keeps me on my toes). Now that you're Level 15 you can wear Raider Power Armour. If you find The Crosshair (an old Raider camp a little to the east of the North West corner of the map), you'll often find a semi-complete set of Raider armour there.
---
Levelling up is sort of slow unless you grind, but it doesn't bother me. I just hit Level 50 after around 70 hours of gameplay. I spend more time exploring than questing.
---
Take over a few Public Workbenches (the unclaimed ones). They deliver HP and nice rewards.
---
Go to The Rusty Pick at some point (just north of Charleston Fire Station) and look around. You'll pick up the Miner Miracles quest there, and once you hit Level 25 you can follow it to get Excavator Armour (really nice).
---
I love giving stuff to new starters, I love giving people a positive experience of online gaming, even just a little one 
---
No.
---
I love beagles, they're awesome dogs. 
---
Be cool if we could edit breeds and looks!
---
Solo the scortch queen and you need to do it as part of the mission I am become death. My buddy got it today as well.
---
Ive never seen monster mash or scorched earth
---
Agree that dupers should be hung, drawn and quartered, but most Fallout 76ers are as nice as a perfectly preserved pie.
---
Meh stories like this is why I can't get strangers to accept my friend invites for nuke zones. I like to team up with people and share perks like radsponge to benefit us both. Literally no reason to not team up while in a nuke zone. 
---
For some reason, [this](https://gyazo.com/09aaa3d0dd954ee58f606c45bed06917) is all I see?
---
Not fully unfortunately, but it does give back a nice chunk of durability. I think the name was Luck of the Draw.
---
C++ mostly.
---
But I wouldn't work at Bethesda given the choice.
---
Same. I think you get more grief in areas that are on main quest paths. And anyone who builds in White Springs seems to be asking for trouble (what with the nukes and all).
---
Lol my friend told me he was gonna fast travel to the store , had me dying 
---
Thanks! It sure is. Now I have to figure out what to do with the "rest of the game".
---
I'll probably start out by venturing into the wastes, discover new locations, help out where I can and continue to build/tweak my camp in the Ash Heap.
---
What do you do?
---
Anyone know what order last laugh and lifesaver work in?
---
Or is it random?
---
that's the one thing i'm really scared of in FO76, don't care about the scorchbeasts, hell i can even tank the queen but getting herbivore mutation \*shuders\*
---
Had a nice setup tonight post up at dropsite  v9 all the heavy were on the roof of that bunker just swiveling so no one shot each other. And used the landscape to our advantage had melee and shot gunners plugging holes in the fence. Some lowlies resing and tossing grenades and molotovs into the mob. Worked really well only when a lifelike queen showed up with 3 kings did things devolve into chaos. Mainly because of her acid melted the lowly peeps lol. Total clusterfuck. But we recovered and it was best queen fight i have had yet. Long one think we got her at 5 min left because of mentioned clusterfuck. But total blast. Also positioned nuke zones were not in rad zone at v9. 
---
I happened to log in to whitesprings courtyard about 2 seconds before a Nuke strike.  That was fun!
---
someone give this man a cooky!!!
---
Shoulda asked if he had the caps 
---
Ok fellas gather around, Ill tell you how to find nuka cola paint
---
1. go to "pylon v-13" south east of the map, go near the stairs of that pylon and look for petrified corpse. from walk from stairs to petrified, on the left you'll see an ammo bag. take the key from there
---
2. go to watoga, find a little musical stage just near the river. walk to the right side of stage, to the rocky area. You'll find a red toolbox, unlock it and grab the key
---
3. go to sutton.(se of vault 76) when spawned, go to left side of town. Ull find a yellow chest inside the dog house. Unlock it and grab the key.
---
4. go to Kanawha Nuka cola plant from FRONT GATE. Go upstairs from right and enter the nearest door, enter second door here. in the end of hallway you'll find a white cabinet on the ground-semi covered in dirt. Unlock it and get the last key :)
---
5. go to black mountain ordnance works. (its left of vault 76) From there, go to east side road. last place's entrance is covered by trees- hard to see. İn the map its between east road and the mountains. Unlock it and Voila! u just found nuka cola paint and probably 5-6 nuka colas inside
---
There are trading subs and discord channels for this stuff.
---
Wow! What a great build! Is that the full extent of how far down you can build? I ask because I've always been tempted to go back and try and get a Camp built on that Lead/Acid deposit (one at the top and one at the bottom of a huge cliff) but I'm not sure how high/low the C.A.M.P. allows one to build.
---
But anyhoo, again - great home!
---
The only thing I would’ve like better is if the wedding was in the basement of the mothman museum. 
---
I love this game and the randomness of all of the people. 
---
Wauw! Thanks.
---
Yea, any time you scrap something from your camp, regardless if your stash is full or not, it gets put into your stash, and of course you can't put anything into your stash until you remove the excess. Had an issue where I had like 200 something corn that duped and were in my stored tab of the camp build menu, placed them all down, scrapped them, and had like 150 pounds of corn in my stash.
---
Stay inside The Forest for the time being, it's the safest area (the Ash Heap is next safest) and there's lots to explore. When you hit Level 15 you can wear Raider Power armour (a partial suit often spawns at an old Raider camp called The Crosshair). VATs has problems with guns when dealing with fast-moving enemies who like to get too close (eg molerats). Invest a good few points in strength and VATs them in melee. Take over unclaimed Public Workshops for HP and rewards. If you build a camp near a mineral pit or junk heap you can build an extractor on it.
---
can you point me in their direction?
---
Alright man good luck then :)
---
Not unless they are friends or extremely lucky.
---
Mmmm.... Interesting. I can see this making sense in a lot of ways.
---
Don’t they show up in recently ? 
---
Hmm a logout timer of 60 seconds might help.   Where DC will keep your character on server for 60 seconds regardless (And save the character to be resync'd to client when reconnect, overwriting client side character)
---
They do, but can you choose join from that menu? 
---
Just checked , no 
---
Take advantage crit chance/crit damage perks and drugs.  The damage from my rifles are nothing grand, but landing the right crits, and not wasting shots while she's moving makes the magic happen. As long as there are mobs on the ground for me to maintain momentum of the perks(adrenaline/gun fu) the queen is manageable. Bobble heads are a gimmick that would improve times but just not worth farming since the fights so far haven't been that long. I'm sure there are other combinations that work better but for me crit chance and crit damage is what I have the most fun with. 
---
I've seen a hammer bro consistently ten-shot the queen in \~30sec, over a month ago. i'm not a fan of melee playstyle but they are leaps and bounds ahead in terms of sustained damage output.
---
There are actually multiple types of Fasnacht masks, there's like demon one, goblin one etc. The Fasnacht Man mask is obtainable normally in game
---
Conan MMO... Hm. Age of Conan, perhaps?
---
There was a lot of hate when the first came out because, honestly, it came out in a really poor state with a ton of bugs and a lot of issues that caused people to crash. 
---
Bethesda seems to be keeping on top of it though, the updates are regular and fix problems. That's why there is hate for the game or at least there was when it first game out. 
---
Other than that, you'll find there are one or two problems still kind of lingering about that are at the core of the game. The end game content is pretty stale, and one of the end game monsters (don't want to spoil anything for you) is pretty poorly designed, annoying to fight, and doesn't drop any good loot. 
---
A lot of the reviewers you watched probably didn't play for very long and so didn't get a good sense of the game, this is pretty common for every release which is why you should never rely on reviewers for opinions on games **when they first come out**. They're not just trying to game the system, it's pretty much expected of them to make content for new games as they release but a lot of time they don't have the time to sit and play the game for 200 hours in the first day it was released. Instead, watch reviewers that play the game long after the release and can tell you a more nuanced opinion on it. I'm working on my video of it right now and I bring up extensively how the reviews of this game were overwhelmingly negative at launch and not really an accurate representation of what the game actually is...
---
Again, that being said, as someone with almost 300 hours now, this game is bad later on, fun at the start. There's not much content once you hit level 80 and finished the main quest. But, again, Bethesda is going to get there on content hopefully, they're already adding a new zone with a vault soon and they've talked about adding more content in the future (hopeful that they'll come through like they have been). Also I'd like to say that there are quests and base building in ARK, they're just not presented in the fashion seen in Fallout. Arguably the base building in ARK is much better due to how you aren't as restricted as you are with base building in 76 and your structures have world permenance so they don't leave when you log off (therefore you have more interaction with other players and servers actually matter). 
---
But, yeah, the game ain't as shit as reviewers made it out to be. It's not like...the best game ever and certainly is not the best fallout game, but it has potential to grow and become a much better game while also being a new fallout title to play if you got bored of 4, so it's an ok game.
---
This does indeed make a lot of sense.  We were in a nuked Whitesprings a week or two ago doing the forced respawn trick for 3-4 hours and got 6 different weapons with explosive just no TSE, but anti armor explosive and bloodied explosive are pretty fun.
---
This really, really needs more testing. i've done over a 100 SBQ's by now and we usually triple nuke the same server unless it dies. We've never noticed any patterns like this. The only thing i've noticed is that the amount of syringers and flare guns dropping of her has increased. But thats just personal luck to be honest, there was never any pattern to it.
---
If people could group up and try and do some testing regarding this that would be awesome. feel free to PM me with how you want to do it and ill ask a few friends to help out!
---
If you love beagles. My beagle club (Merseyside Beagle Club) just broke the guinness book of records single breed walk with 1029 beagles! The video at the bottom of their page is my YouTube video. Beagles Rule!!!

LMAO! I just came here to eat some pop corn while drinking a glass of fo76 fans tears. That was worth it! You guys are playing such a terrible designed game made by one of the most hated dev studio of past year. You paid for a BMW but you got a Lada. And you guys are like : "PLZZZZZZZZZ fix my Lada, I want it to be a BMW. " or " Well I got hard-scammed.. Maybe if I bury my head in the sand next fo game will be better". ... Or just go play ATOM rpg which is fallout 2.5 in soviet union. No dupers, no bans, no Bethesda.. Just pure fallout spirit from the roots. I mean real fallouts. Not Bethesda's hilariously softened and childish take on fallout. 
---
The cups with lid and straw have plastic, the other are paper only. The stacks of cups are plastic too.
---
The raider vendors nor selling raider plans is just wrong. I hope that gets sorted out in the next patch. The one where Bethesda said they were going to fix plan availability from vendors.
---
Dude dont pay 15k... 3-5k max.
---
Monster mash is started occasionally when someone enters Watoga high school and is a versus event.  Scorched earth is the scorchbeast queen fight.
---
I use them while fighting the queen, otherwise I don't even bother with them.
---
Holy shit that’s awesome, congratulations!! 
---
I saw people with TSE miniguns, that one(!)shot anything smaller than a Deathclaw. Sometimes even Hermit Crabs. With a pretty much automatic weapon. Oneshot. As in with a single bullet. Theres still 999+ left. And it wasnt even a clean hit, but instead the ground mear the target.
---
Buffing every other weapon to this level is INSANE. TSE definitely needs to be nerfed. Probably along with the 15K hit melee builds.
---
Energy/plasma weapons definitely need a buff tho.
---
i would pay more tbh lol, its the only thing i need to finish my build, do you where i can go to trade or buy theses kind of things?
---
I play solo and send random friend requests when I need to fast-travel to somewhere in the vicinity. I'm not looking to do anything bad so please don't stop accepting random invites :)
---
You played to long when you are surprised of all the human npcs
---
The one plan I cannot seem to find is the deep pocketed metal chest plan
---
I can't switch to first person when it happens. Hitting the view button does nothing.
---
Excavator is really the weakest of all the PA.  Only the hidden damage reduction makes it worthwhile over normal armors.  My normal armor has better stats if compare them side by side.   Realistically, the PA will take less damage though.
---
Love the idea. Might try it myself some day. What are your thoughts on being killed by any of the bugs though? For example if you load into the game and can't move for 30s while being mobbed by a bunch of ghouls / supermutants / etc? 
---
these posts never get upvoted enough to show up in the front page. we need cosmetic pets that do literally nothing but follow you around.
---
I'd pay good money for one.
---
I used this spot for ages, but I keep flip flopping between need for water and need for resources, may end up back there at some point, I'm currently pretty central, near Top of the World, helps with fast travel costs
---
Thanks!!!! Was a great day!!!
---
Sounds like you are being hunted. Probably did something too piss them off or something similar.
---
It is fair PvP with legendary effects. It's just RNG. That's like saying it isn't fair that I was born with brown hair. 
---
Thank You Sir :)
---
I have luck of 15 and have gotten 0 out of 30 tries
---
I've never found an ultracite gatling laser or plan for it. I have a handful of legendary ultracite pistols and rifles and the plan for them. I've only played for nearly 350 hours at this point... really beginning to question if they actually exist.
---
try watoga high school
---
I have one on Xbox. I'm good with 4k caps. 
---
economies imply cash. so why does this sub gets up in arms whenever someone mentions rmts? either you have a market or you don't. can't have both ways.
---
personally I think it's silly considering the game is mostly singleplayer-focused, but whatever.
---
Would be happy to. PSN Intervein

To expand on _some weapons_:
---
Ultracite Fusion Cores are actually great. They're overcharged and making them procs Super Duper. They can be used in place of normal fusion cores (don't put one in a power armor chassis, though, it will crash).
---
&gt;It only effects people close by?
---
yes. bar the latest, unconfirmed one.
---
&gt;It breaks an in game economy for a game someone purchased, essentially robbing a player base of a healthy functioning mechanic.
---
few people outside reddit actually care for that """feature""", most people just play solo.
---
&gt;So it's everyone's business and it effects everyone. 
---
if you view Fo76 as a multiplayer experience, which I don't. so mind your own business and stay out of mine.
---
Super useful - much better than mine so stealing yours. ;)
---
That's why there's misc. objective to retrieve it.
---
I do that as well but I didn't know it was true. I saw some comments and I started doing that
---
I couldn’t play along since I sold that costume. Was a lot of caps!
---
dang im on pc :(
---
I've picked one up before, but don't ask me where. I've also had other players craft them for me.
---
I don't think you can learn the base weapon plan from scrapping or I'd just buy a bunch from players....
---
Me and my friend were talking about this, if it's a bug  where there was nothing I could do about it and is clearly a bug then we will make the judgement and either rule that the character lives or dies. I am also worried about spawning in and a nuke drops on me right away,  technically it's not my fault because you normally have time to get out of the zone. But hopefully that will never happen. I am gunna have to be careful where I log out. 
---
I've been enjoying a no fast travel run myself. I stick to roads and railways and the stuff you discover is so much more fun than just rushing directly toward your goal
---
Where I can find puddle ball mods?
---
Go to the left then walk straight and then turn right when u see the sign 
---
LMAO! I'm that way around clipboards! 
---
Useless post is useless.
---
Think combat armour doesn't start until level 20. I found a few bits at random. Only ever seen plans for light armour though and can't find any reference to heavy combat armour plans.
---
He has several possible spawn locations it's just Charleston is a reliable one.
---
try to clam workshops it's pretty common
---
lol wot
---
More motes in general are needed.  Like a sorry, crying, laughing etc.  Most people are in parties on console and they don't talk.
---
Bounty Hunt. When you down them, don't finish them off, if they don't give up, you should get to revive them. Some people are stubborn and will let you down and revive them several times before they finally give up. 
---
Much cheaper from players.
---
you could use it in vats to charge up the crit bar in 1 second, i tried it with the handy buzz today, then swap to something really powerful and swing it for a crit (in my case it was the executioner grognak)
---
Just be careful doing more than 5 at a time in the same spot. There have been multiple posts about 15+ treasure maps at a time causing people to not only lose their entire inventory but also make it to where they can’t come close to other players.
---
Atleast on xbox it‘s working. recent -&gt; player profile -&gt; Join Game
---
Ok thank you. I started off going with a shotgun/pa/demo build but getting and maintaining the PA is starting to sort of kill the game for me. Going to switch to a commando/shotgun build if its possible 
---
It’s all about RNG. Best way to get them is farming 3 and 2 star legendary enemies
---
Thank you very much. You should add that scrap all junks scraps hardened mass. Read it yesterday and it happend few hours after to me. 
---
nuke Whitesprings, kill Glowing Ones, repeat ad nauseam.
---
you could drop one after your first kill but generally it could take weeks, months to find one.
---
Xbox has been bad too. I got disconnected about 5-6 times within an hour and a half to two hours. I’ve called it for the night until the patch rolls in. 
---
Dang. Good hunting for the gear! 
---
the recipes are like 19K caps each
---
so you're better off buying them separately.
---
pretty sure it's zealot
---
Everyone = A Couple Salty PooTubers
---
That’s what I mean, though. Nobody with an ounce of sense releases something like the scorchbeasts and thinks ‘eh, I can clean this up later.’ They act more like a religious cult trying to forcefully bring about the apocalypse (again.) 
---
Yeah. It popped up for me around Wavy Willard's. There's a security check point on the road that can trigger it. 
---
i think the mr handy is the winner, because it starts spinning right away basically, and can get the 2 hand +damage along with everything else like nerd rage and adrenal reaction. find a bloodied one for the ultimate ultimate
---
Well, ok, yeah. If they’re being adult supervised, that’s one thing. You’re not likely to run into a 8yo behaving like the person above had to deal with if they’re being adult supervised though.
---
they could make a "rule" where it states any hacking or  excessive exploiting  will result in a ban and a monet fee. You  have to agree before you play.
---
I have luck of 15 and have occasionally seen 2 fusion cores in boxes.   I always have to drop cores now because accidentally looted them.
---
I agree wholeheartedly with this. Great idea.
---
"it is I, john henr- AHAHA it is I, THREEEEDAAAAAWG"
---
No ? They are at like 4,8k Caps at the vendor afaik?
---
I ran it by my nuke guys and they all agreed that they have also noticed a pattern in the nukes. We ran a nuke earlier and ended up with 8 legendary fatmans.
---
I can walk you through how to do it quickly and easily some evening if you like, I play most evenings from 5pm-10pm EST.  Feel free to throw me a DM with your IGN and I will add it to my flist, my buddy and I love launching nukes.
---
Interestingly I have yet to see any real toxicity in this game. I play on PC, and I remember someone suggesting that PC players were far less toxic than their console counterparts. 
---
Shit, I didnt even realize you could get paint without the atom shop. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Nicely done. :D
---
Fo4 is one of my favorite games. Played way to much. Even tried maxing a char but im stuck at 172 with no enemies left. Dont even respawn anymore xD
---
That event is the funniest, you have a bunch of players all in PA running around like headless chicken shooting everything in sight
---
I found my just 2 shot Gatling gun just melts Scorched Beasts, Use my explosive one on everything else.
---
Crybabies 
---
Oh no pvp happened 
---
Why do you care about others people doing this if someone wants to do this go ahead. Your just one of them noisy cunts who can’t mind there own business 😂😂
---
Dam'n. And here I am with my shotgun, unable to oneshot mutants at level 86 with all shotgun perks maxed.
---
Guess I'll have to do a Close Combat priest of atom.
---
You can wear Raider Power Armour at Level 15. In the North-West corner of the map (and a little to the east) is an old raider camp in the hills called The Crosshair. A partial suit often spawns there. Aside from that, any Power Armour frame on the map has a chance of spawning a frame with Raider parts on it.
---
Any recommendations for those who havent got any of those yet?
---
God no the game has much to balance and fix before more pvp modes can be added. Don't care if they want to expand pvp i am sure some love Fallout 76 pvp. Not a fan myself so its content i would not use personally.
---
r/fo76bazaar
---
For what it's worth, I was rewarded with plans for a BoS Initiate Paint from completing a random BoS event.  
---
If you can run far enough the beast just quits attacking you. 
---
It's Hunter. They're an animal 
---
I ended up in a stable server for a couple of hours. Hopefully it's easier to find those tomorrow lol
---
I moved out because I hoped to see more people, went near a lake for a few days, got so much water I was overencumbered, now I'm near the monorail's pillars at the entrance of the mountains. 
---
I'll stay there for a few weeks, then I'll probably go back to the country side aforementionned, unless they finally include a way to have a shop, in which case I'll have to find a good spot.
---
But yeah, those farms are so peaceful... I really loved staying there, shooting bees.
---
So coming up with your own ways of playing the game is now supposed to be a beloved feature? 
---
A developer now deserves praise for deliberately omitting key features in order for the players to fill in the blanks (or modders to fix the issues)?
---
Seriously...?!
---
No wonder the entire gaming industry is going to hell in a handbasket...
---
Do you think awesome classic videogames on the NES are still being praised today solely because you could play Mario Bros. with permadeath or Mega Man with one hand tied behind your back or Mike Tyson's Punchout blindfolded or Zelda without picking up the sword or Contra while sitting dressed up as the hero in front of the TV?? No - these games are great because they work so well without any shenanigans... And people love to come up with new and interesting ways to play these games not because they feel like they cannot enjoy them without superficial restrictions.
---
The same thing applies for movies.
---
A director cannot just haphazardly leave out important story elements and expect the viewers to fill in the plot holes themselves...
---
However, if a movie is in and of itself interesting and engaging and well made, then being open-ended and deliberately ambiguous can be a great thing.
---
I've played e.g. Skyrim without using fast travel or without looting enemies and it was great... but the game was also great with these restrictions. Claiming that FO76 is great because it "allows" you to roleplay as a Raider, but doesn't provide you with any in-game means to actually PLAY as a Raider is, by definition, bad design - and not a feature.
---
Yes?
---
Was hunting in Harpers Ferry on a 27th level mule character I'm building up for weight perks on my alt account this weekend. A random 89th lvl character starts throwing grenades and then shooting at me while I was trading with the vendor. After a while I ported to my camp that was close and logged in my original character on the main account - currently 131 as I only ever really do cap selling runs on them atm but totally kitted out for full pvp. Brought him to the world and went out to one shot the offendor from stealth. Wow the rage and tears.... though they shut up when I pointed out I was frapsing everything including their abuse and was contemplating posting it on youtube and sending it to Bethseda. I wasn't really but sticking the knife in and twisting it was immensely satisfying (and childish I know!).
---
In fairness though IMO 95% of "pvp" currently is just "which properly geared/perked character fires first" which makes any boasting etc people do laughable at best.
---
As a non-die hard legendary farmer, I'll add my two cents in and say I agree, I've gotten four(!!!) Explosive weapons, the only explosive weapons that ever dropped for me, from the same server back to back to back (to back) 
---
Yes officer, this commie here
---
I launched my first nuke just last week at lvl 11 to initiate a Scorched Earth event with the help of a trusted trading buddy that was around lvl 170.  (I think past lvl 100, you're just acquiring situational perks and maxing out top end crafting cards with no real power gain.  I had my basic stealth rifle DPS build locked in early and picked cards for crafting and situational stuff after that)  I'd already participated in dozens of nukes, so I was familiar with the ideal results, and had a good idea that placement is fluid and key to success for all manner of builds.  We were both lvl 100+ and I think it would be very difficult to solo the launch as an Ag/Per stealth rifle build solo.  I had to force myself into entering my X-01 suit (I imagined my character dusting it)  midway in order to be useful with collection and defending, mitigate rads and maintain defense while relinquishing sneak attacks against mountains of robots.  Luckily I found a couple fusion cores along the way, because they're too heavy to stockpile.  Between the silo and the SBQ event, I probably burned over 1000 rounds of .45 and 5.56 on my two rifles.  It was the first time I had a gun break since I was a noob, even with rank 3 gunsmith and at least 150% durability left on my previous repair.  The process of launching the nuke is way more of a resource drain than actually taking down the queen.
---
It was really cool to see my name broadcast across the server and having my seasoned buddy compliment me on a good drop that encompassed a variety of locations within the blast while barely leaving Station Delta out of the blast for rad-free queen killings.  I repaired my gun, made more ammo and went back into the blast after everyone left and made two yellow flux at the sundew grove and killed a couple scorchbeasts along the way for decent xp.  It was a good time.
---
In terms of enemy levels - they're spawned based on the highest level player that's close by, so look on the map to see if there are any high level players near where you want to go: if there are, avoid it for a while or go somewhere else (or server hop).  Then, when you go there they should spawn closer to your level - if not, retreat and return or server op.
---
But here's the thing - the endgame (farming scorchbeasts/queens) is actually a bit rubbish. So I say don't rush there - enjoy the journey.
---
So fully explore the forest - you should find loads to do (there's plenty of events to do even once you've explored all the locations) and you'll get lots of XP and the enemies will be of a similar level to you.  And you may run into other players you want to team up with for a bit.
---
Build a little (or big) camp - you can get lots of small bits of XP from crafting and cooking.  Scrapping weapons gives you plans so you can then upgrade the weapons you find to make them better / suit your play style.  And to get those weapons you can go out killing the mobs, which also gives you XP.
---
Up vote for good work!
---
Thankfully that is supposedly getting fixed in todays update for consoles.
---
Lode Baring
---
Isnät it "Lode Baring"?
---
X01 has the most Rad resistant :) 
---
Stay in the area of your level and you wont have lvl 50 enemies to deal with. Its kinda limiting you but it helps bc you can actually kill enemies for EXP. Youll get stronger pretty fast imo. 
---
Hahaha it’s true! I suppose I’d probably do the same in their position! 
---
you dont need to scrap and rebuild, just store it and bring it back out. also you can repair the entire camp by moving it as well.
---
Thank god
---
Same. After FO4 if I was walking outside and saw a crack in the tarmac I used to think, Great, I could grow some carrots in there.
---
Was this on Xbox by any chance? Joined a server last night just as a nuke hit, saw it had hit whitesprings so went there, halfway through farming it I had an event complete pop up for scorched earth and realised a second nuke had been launched at fissure prime that had a lot of people roaming around.
---
Great advice thanks 
---
How about killing a 3* and getting nothing?
---
Yup the are. There was a really cool full sized red rocket sign you could get where the rocket would blast off when destroyed. Didn't have the caps for it at the time. 
---
You on Xbox?
---
Thanks. But not seen any of that in the game so far.
---
I've been playing since the BETA and I have yet to see another player visit my CAMP much less get attacked.
---
Maybe its because I'm on the western edge of the map in the Forest, I  think some people probably avoid it because its not worth it to be in the area due to low level enemies. 
---
Im level 365 and have had 1 TSE gun drop in total. And maybe 20 explosive guns in total. They are not common drops. 
---
Same! When I first started playing I had an American guy who was 20 levels above me take me to his camp and give me purified water, stims,  fixed up armour for me, gave me weapons and even showed me where to find ingredients to make adhesive which I was in desperate need of. I could just put the extra items in a corpse or a cash register near 76 but that experience really changed the game for me. I want them to see a friendly face and start off on a positive note.
---
Similar story to us, but yeah in reflection I am absolutely living my best life. I've been waiting for him my whole life kinda thing ya know? And it's been 7 years! Still can't believe it.
---
Oh man I'll trade your for an instigating walking cane.
---
I had tried that but it gave me fits. Thanks!
---
One of the hallmark features of an EOS/FO game is experiencing a "lived in" world. Yes this is a "FO 76 has no NPCs" compliant, but the compliant is justified. Since Morrowind, part of the magic was seeing how these NPCs interacted with you and the environment. For me, the highlight was exploring an environment, getting lost for half an hour and then stumbling upon a settlement of NPCs and seeing how they lived life based on what their surroundings provided them. There was a thrill to "Oh I get why this town is set up this way and why the people are acting this way." That was the experience. 
---
Yes, Bethesda said upfront "this takes place right after the first bomb so there won't be anybody in the world." In my opinion this is what many people are calling "lazy". I truly believe Bethesda couldn't figure out how to have NPCs in the traditional Bethesda way, and take it online. Think about it, you can kill/disrupt nearly any NPC in a EOS/FO game. That would have broken the online experience. 
---
Having this game take place after the first bomb seems all too convienent.  
---
Until they load out with Fireproof / Dense chest
---
Oh boi, it's time to smash dat crouch button
---
I really think they should make a check for nuke zones on the server before you spawn. You should never spawn directly into a current - or imminent - nuke zone, in my opinion. 
---
Omg I really have to get back into this game.
---
Hmmm cookies! I’m not a man, though haha
---
You get the plans to craft it from one of the Enclave bunker terminals.
---
Will be doing this after work
---
The NPC could respawn. It’s hardly a technical mystery. 
---
I disagree with you. I think no NPCs was a clear design decision. And I also believe that due to the negative response, they’ll likely add them in soon. 
---
&gt; dont need to have the same issue with my own corpse lol.
---
And that's why you wear a shiny spacesuit if you're in tall grass.
---
I would love to see the return of Dogmeat. There was just something so precious about seeing him tear the throat out of some raider. Awwww. Who’s a good boy?
---
Ive been trying to keep track of what i get and where and where legendaries spawn. I stick to the same server as long as possible to repeat farm spots.
---
Im 100% positive that if the server spawns a legendary mob, that will always be legendary on respawn. But i cant track drops well at all right now, server disconnects are super rampant. Last week i did get 3 1 star two shot shotguns from 1 server.
---
If you don’t do pvp much then you want combat or metal armour with unyielding or vanguard and sentinel or cavalier effects 
---
All the yes. The amount of times I’ve been doing an event and have accidentally hit another player. I always say sorry but obvs they can’t hear me without a mic!
---
Instead of asking them to do even more work, you could do the work yourself, seeing as though now the data is available.
---
You can see the EditorID in the last column. Those starting with CUT_ and POST_ are not in the game. That includes the Paddle Ball and mods.
---
Sure? I get the plan after I do the quest for the Exavator PA. You can't find it in the world you have to craft the X01. When you got the Exavator PA just got to a PA Station and look at craftables for the Prototype X01 :) 
---
Currently in game we're catching him up to my level and searching for his perfect gun, rare outfit hunting because fashion is meta and we're obsessed with taking dumb photos with the weird glitched out scorched bodies/bugs etc.
---
Yeah I'm having so much fun, it's so awesome. 
---
In FO4 I've been hit with legendary weapons. A legendary (raider?) bad guy with an Irradiated minigun turned my health red and then dead.
---
I love my junk extractor. I don't think I'll ever be able to wean myself off all those screws! Sounds like a similar place, except a get a few robots and a mole rat. I do a run to the south for water, I'll have to look at installing a pump.
---
If I found it myself, I marked where I found it. If I got it before I made the spreadsheet or from a trade, the plan location will be empty. 
---
Pretty much this. I've doing everything solo and got my ass handed to me by Mole Men going into the Ash Heap kinda early (also don't forget that gas mask). 
---
I was never a melee weapon kind of guy but since its OP in this game you should find a couple and use them. It will save you on ammo early on a ton, and repairing costs should be low. 
---
You should be able to get your hands on a Fire Axe early on as well as machetes. Keep using those and crafting newer higher level ones as you level. If you come across a Super Sledge, switch to that if the damage output is higher. 
---
if you have more than one i will take one as well, lol :)
---
Probably 4-430pm I'm eastern time 
---
Very nice - are there pictures of the other FO76 paint schemes as struggling to find them (except the bos acolyte, nuka and store versions)?
---
What about missile launchers? The one super mutant or mole miner with a missile launcher seems to only shoot 4 or 5 and then switches to another weapon. It seemed the same in FO4.
---
Wow totally missed that. I'm super careful when crafting but never thought of that function. 
---
If you happen to be on PS4, I just robbed some dupers and have excess tse handmades.  Let me know.
---
Until they eat 50 bobble head and just one shot you past the slap.
---
I don't build nice camps because I though t this would be a thing. I have had to high lvl guys destroy my camp before when I was a lower lvl.
---
   So I don't build nice camps as much as I would like to do as I did in fo4 in fo76 I only make a square box put in work stations and usually leave door open for other s to use unles I am inside. 
---
  NO POINT IN IT SINCE PPL LIKE TO BE JERKS JUST TO FORCE PVP TRYING TO TAKE YOUR HARD EARNED CAPS. 
---
pics or it didnt happen
---
your bag will despawn after you fast travel or walk far enough away.
---
dump your unwanted crap in a suitcase or lunch box inside a train station. 
---
Yeah it's easier...the HP scales with the players around. It took us around 3-4 minutes. But I think you need decent gear and perk cards to kill her solo faster than a group.
---
Monster spawns also scale with the amount of players. That's one thing that makes the fight more difficult, because people have to care about the trash mobs... on the other hand you get more loot when you can kill dozens of high level mobs.
---
&gt;1st off, I owe nothing to you.  
---
Says the person that is demanding Bethesda do all he bids and feels he's owed an apology. 
---
You haven't addressed how honest players would lose all their game. You talked about Atoms, that's all. There's more to the game than Atoms. There's plans, recipes, gear, clothing, and everything else in the game that players would lose. Or that they would lose their characters. What about all that? You only addressed one small, tiny aspect.  And what a surprise, it's a way to get more for less! 
---
If your response to that is even slightly close to, they can work towards getting all that back in game, then it's you that don't have any respect.
---
And you completely ignored the fact that by unbanning dupers and exploiters, and wiping all the honest players stuff away, Bethesda is hurting the larger portion of their players in favor of the cheaters. Which is why I think you are actually a cheater, *who got banned*. 
---
If you were also really still playing the game, you would know that the Atom shop prices have been going down, and that Bethesda said they are reviewing the prices and will adjust accordingly. And if you were really paying attention, you would have seen posts about people saying just that. That Bethesda clearly listened to the players feedback.
---
Which was another big point in your OP. They need to listen to their player base. They clearly are. Again, if you were actually playing and paying attention, you would have seen that. 
---
For example, the amount of fixes they have focused on. The games base has been very clear, that while they want new content, they would rather have things fixed first. And in response, Bethesda has pushed fixing things to the front. And they are even pushing things back, in favor of those fixes.
---
They haven't had good communication, and in response to the players, they are trying to give us something every week. It's not always the best. But they are trying to get better. In response to what the players are saying. 
---
Again if you were really paying attention, you would have seen that. 
---
And your reasons for wanting people unbanned? Hilarious. Your first is that you've heard stories about twitch players being banned erroneously. That is the worst logic ever. Your proof is literally that you've heard stories. You are literally saying that whatever you believe, must be right. How do you know these stories you heard of are honest? What proof do you have that these rumors are true? You haven't even said that you know someone. You haven't even said that you read first hand accounts. 
---
You want Bethesda to unban everyone because you read about some people claiming they got unfairly banned? You want to be taken seriously, and that you are logical. And yet, you never question that maybe something you just heard about might not be true? And you can't come back and make a claim that you did think that. It's too late. You should have said it upfront, when you were championing all the exploiters be unbanned. 
---
Now it would just look like you are backpedaling. 
---
*All your logic and proof and reasons all come down to the same thing. I'm right because I'm right.* That's why I LUL you and Mock you. You offer nothing concrete to back you up. 
---
You make it sound like the number of people banned, has affected the population of the game. I seriously doubt the number of people banned caused a drop in population. 
---
Also, if you were really playing the game you claim to love, you would know that there has been a big increase in players since Christmas and New Years. I have a regular play group. I've had several other friends join after hearing us talking about how much fun we are having in game. And since the Holidays, I regularly find that me or one of my friends have to wait to join us, because the world is full. 
---
The servers aren't empty like you claim. I'm always spending the first part of a session giving out armor and gear and food and water to new players in Flatwoods. 
---
The duppers and exploiters who got banned, are people that know that these kinds of actions are bannable. They look for exploits and work them. That's a conscious choice on their part. Another fallacy of your's is that we are all already giving Bethesda a second chance. 
---
Some of use understand not everything is perfect. I've played games that launched way worse than this, and games  that launched way better. The bottom line is that if a person can play and is having fun, that's what matters. I experience my share of bugs and disconnect. To say that we are all giving Bethesda a second chance, so they need to give cheaters a second chance is again, wrong.
---
For us to be giving Bethesda a second chance, that would mean we got frustrated, left, and then decided to come back. That's not what's happening. We didn't leave. We understood that this game is trying to be something different. And that yes, it's an experiment on their part. Some of us understand the game was launched with a lot of room to grow, change and become something than just another MMO built like all the other MMOs out there. 
---
The bottom line is this. You want Bethesda to start over fresh, make everything cheaper, let all the cheaters and exploiters back into the game. And to get down on their knees and apologize to the gaming community because you feel they insulted the gaming community. 
---
And you want respect? You are upset because someone sees you for the entitled, privileged person your own words make you sound like?
---
No. Asking Bethesda to screw over all the honest, decent players who like the game, in favor of cheaters and exploiters is literally the worst thing Bethesda could do. Giving them Atoms back as compensation for everything they will lose in game is also insulting. Wiping away hundreds of hours of gameplay? Insulting.
---
No if anything your ideas would be terrible, and really hurt the game. Which is what I think you really want. 
---
It can be ~~abused~~ **used** to make ~~floating~~ **marsupial friendly** houses however.
---
I found someone's amazing camp yesterday. I paused to get into photo mode, turned to take a picture, and then it disappeared.    
---
It really do be like that.
---
Im level 127, I do the event with a switchblade if anyone else is there too.
---
Very useful thanks.
---
Does this actually work? I've died to my own gun more then I've died to the game
---
But how does 90% of the player base on xbox have TSE then? Ha ha ha. 
---
Anyways, I've gotten 2 1 SE weapons in 127 levels. One is a 10mm SMG with armor piercing which is a fun weapon. 
---
There's a friendly dog on the top of the cliff that is across the the train Bridge east of Harper's Ferry. Should be almost directly above the tunnel entrance. Anyone know if you can tame it? 
---
Game EULAs are trash and there no ethical aspect to honoring them. If you bought a game, playing it however you want without harming others is fine.
---
You do know Ivory is for pimps, real men use pearl.
---
Select that droplist at the top and select "Open with Microsoft Excel" or "Open with Google Sheets". Then you'll see the tabs across the bottom.
---
I have a top lvl right arm you can trade me for.   What do you have?  I'll be on tonight PM me.
---
For a raider you have high level thinking. I assume you're a Daddy-O junkie. :)
---
Takes closer to 300 and a lot of jumping and luck. It is far from 100% effective. 
---
Why can't people like u be on other platforms 
---
I’m gay 
---
Supposedly the new patch fixes Fireproof - I guess it has been tested on PC with two guys shooting each other and/or point blank into a wall.
---
I'll be testing myself this afternoon with Dense BoS combat armor chest and maxed Fireproof.
---
That'll be a game changer not having to run from radroaches in order to not kill myself haha
---
Awww
---
oh man I hope they add it and the pelt outfit to the game and not the atomic shop also i want my pack buffalo helmet back 
---
I hope someday you'll find my Fortreess, I found you can make a big platform and wall around the majority of possible CAMP space, I've decorated it well but I wish we could have more prefab'd units like the foldout campers and stuff instead of having a tent, an open shack for crafting and this weird 2x4 sitting way too evenly inside :P
---
From what I saw in the dev room videos when looking at all the plans for power armor mods there was plans for all the armors except X01.
---
Why a fucking golden pan?
---
Counts on what you use it for
---
Nuke zone= xo1
---
Carry crap=excavator
---
Just exploring and fighting=t51
---
Fighting scorch beasts=ultracite
---
Roleplaying=t60 bos
---
They very rarely drop from the queen.
---
I can only make egg head so far...yay...
---
&gt;  my wife thinks it tastes like actual, literal dirt. 
---
Good.  More for you.
---
Probably rp. 
---
**BUT ITS MUCH EASIER TO PREVENT STARVATION WHEN THE WHOLE WASTELAND IS YOUR DINNERPLATE**
---
What level? I’m interested in a trade for some TSE handmades. My current handmade is under-leveled.
---
Well, you are right: it's not PS2 graphics for sure and I kinda like it more than Fallout 4 (the style, the atmosphere...) but, let be honest ok? It's not even top notch, I'd say late PS3 graphics (yes I know, a game like this simply can't run on PS3 systems, I'm talking only about graphics) IMHO.
---
Note: I'm still loving the game and defending it when necessary.
---
The only tactic that has proven results is to do it better and cheaper yourself. And no one wants that. 
---
I'd like for Bethesda to do sting operations and ban accounts they buy from, but that costs money.
---
At fissure prime I assume. Not been there yet
---
Honestly, people who have tse weapons and just go and kill other players just cause they wanna be an ass, should be stripped of their tse weapons and armor and be whipped on top the Excavator in the Ash Heap before being spartan kicked off the giant machine into a pit of ferals.
---
You're assuming he knows about the pvp thing.
---
Any chance you could share a screenshot of that Traveling Leather Coat? 
---
Doing my best to guess what they could be doing, don't shoot the messenger: player 1 gives player 2 stuff to dupe , player 2 leaves game , player 1 and 3 aggressively trade to rollback their progress, 2 gives 1 his stuff which is now duped. Again this is just speculation dont grab the pitchforks

This guy out here being a homie for people he doesn't know. What a guy. If I had gold or something I'd give it to you.
---
I can confirm quitting the game and restarting works fine. I found jumping to the power sub station nearby skips the bug.
---
Our team loves anyone who helps with minion control. 
---
Not out for profit. Just want people to get the help they need, or the five minutes of silence it takes for them to unwind. Just having someone to get your load off your mind is what I can do to make the world a better place.
---
Same just doing it for the perks :) 
---
😂
---
Level 45 tse handmade
---
That's is very true. Keep up the work. I wish you well in your endeavors.
---
Suppose RNG is nice to you.  In a bit over 200 hours only weapon drop I've used more then a few minutes is a one star instigating mole man gauntlet.  Most non-quest rewards for me are garbage drops with bad gear or traits.
---
If you mean nuke zones then last I checked stealth works fine there.  I'd argue it's only thing that makes a rifle build viable on 50+ exotic mobs.  Granted you won't do mistress gear there due to rads.  
---
Personally nuke zones aren't end game for me, I see them as just farming.  My end game is meandering around exploring the map.
---
My camp is situated just south west of the top of the world. Its a shop that I made, but barely anyone goes there for some reason.
---
I'm hoping to get the small letters plan so I can display a list of inventories
---
Oh fuck me too man 
---
I love the response.  Very nice!  While on one hand I do say fuck those fools, the game does need to provide some leaderboard style fair PvP events/system (e.g. arena) to satisfy the hyper-competitive players' need to play mean, or do away with PvP altogether.  I guess regardless, SOME people will only have fun of they find a way to play like dicks.  Good tip!  
---
Dense prevents/severely weakens(sentinel reactivates extremely fast) staggers from explosions . Also: even if sentinel breaks, and the other effects alone arent enough (dense+fireproof+assassin should weaken tse weapons by a lot) it is better to be a fast 2 hit kill than being a 1 hit kill while being slower, louder and a bigger target through pa.
---
It helps greatly. Haven't killed myself since I put it on the load out
---
good for you, probably time you got out of the closet :)
---
I have the PA station but can only craft Excavator.
---
Well, the three last times I couldn't find half the bodies after the fight anyway, and during the fight trying to search is "loading", so no loot whatsoever.
---
Hence why I'm in Whitespring, usually. Would love to kick SBQ's ass once and for all tho.
---
Cool! Can we set up a trade, or do you want to dump it, like most people do to duped items?
---
Oof 
---
How do you know if a weapon is TSE?
---
Pvp makes sense if u wanna, take over a workshop
---
*org*
---
Well that's interesting, I am 7 months short of the big 50, son got the game before Christmas,  I am level 54, now. Really enjoy the game. Love the searching and hunting for the items, and the excitement of when you finally get that item,  I have found most people are great, not into the PvP side, but have a few try. I just hop the server. Always try to help out lower players when I see them at event's. And really enjoy reading about all of your adventures and guide.
---
They can be joined from recent players unless they are appearing offline. I’ve never personally first hand heard of anyone being followed server to server unless they messed with somebody else first. 
---
Ehhhhhh I am actually glad it only does broken structures.  Right now, repair costs don’t scale with damage.  Do you really want to pay - billion screws to repair a turret because your workshop area is at 99%? 
---
Wtf
---
Unfortunately no, I’m a filthy PS4 casual. Thank you for the offer though. Somebody will probably pass through and take you up on it lol. 
---
"To get the schematics for the Prototype X-01 Power Armor in Fallout 76, you need to do the Enclave questline which is the final series of the quests for Fallout 76. Specifically you need to be on the quest step I am Become Death and then read the Archival Terminal –&gt; Schematics Data in the Enclave base."
---
http://dulfy.net/2018/11/18/fallout-76-prototype-x-01-power-armor-crafting-guide/
---
Not working for me :/
---
Yes it is
---
That's fine, you don't have to believe me and I don't have to prove anything.
---
The videos I made have already been sent to Bethesda, if they want to do anything about these two players.
---
I feel like if they offered for volunteers from the community and compensated them with atoms they could get people to do it for them
---
... I have not had a lack of screws since level 40 or so. Gears, on the other hand, I'm periodically low on.
---
I think the muties in toxic valley start dropping some.
---
The savage divide may give it up as well
---
Yes. Because what I farm are dupers.
---
TSE drop guaranteed!
---
Shouldn't you get rid of the TSE handmades instead of trading them? 
---
Spit on me 
---
Haha thanks! I loved Sims back in the day.  And as for the cows, I’m on the opposite side from them so I haven’t really had any issues. Sometimes though, they just flop over dead and it really makes me wonder. 
---
*Д*
---
Is that around level 20?
---
thanks, no i just need to convince the plan to work on my Ultracite PA , lol
---
I'm a pretty honest guy so the thought of dumping all of that makes me nervous.  I'd rather profit off it a bit and also allow the less privileged members of the community an opportunity to level the playing field on a budget.  Win/win if you ask me.
---
Its still relatively easy to get cores from other methods, you can craft them easily with super duper perk to get over 100% charge with high intelligence. They changed the output again for the fusion core resource collectors at power plants back up to 8 per hour as well, and they drop frequently from random mobs had a few off feral ghouls.
---
It's more of a balance fix then an actual nerf.
---
Cool.
---
Thank you! I hope they don’t either 😢
---
Agreed. How many caps/legendary armor/weapons would you sell it for?
---
This should have everything you need:  https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/72mS8mnzJ6UgSMo0GQIaQy/pre-order-fallout-76-on-pc-and-receive-the-fallout-classic-collection-for
---
Yea, combat armor is more balanced in dmg and energy resist while metal is more damage resist than energy 
---
Are the mutations from serums permanent?
---
It's hard to produce video of fabricated events.
---
thanks dude
---
50k caps.
---
Honestly bro, of all the things you could say to defend this game, and you choose the graphics? LOL
---
Be careful not to buy a dupped, who knows how bethesda will use the ban hammer
---
I'm crying..
---
Clearly the rantings of an anarchistic reactionary !
---
Scarcity is the foundation of Capitalism and its beautiful demand and supply curves.
---
Maybe.  However I am lazy and trapped in an area where I would have to walk a ridiculous distance to properly dispose of them.  So why not give the less fortunate members of the community an opportunity to level the firepower playing field and make a few caps at the same time?  Better than buying the same gun later for 6k right?
---
This 😂
---
Ah man im on PC
---
Are you still on? I’m on PS4 and would so buy one I got 2300 caps on me
---
just lol, hahaha :)
---
thanks for the warning!
---
Well even Whitespring it depends where and if its open or locked down. I leveled a while there and had no problems - quite the opposite really as loads of people used the stash/crafting. Now if you place your gun platform outside the doors to farm legendaries or xp then yes I hope people destroy it.
---
Yeah, but isn't distributing the duped weapons just as bad? You're basically doing what the dupers are doing. 
---
Gosh, I recently started to rework my base and is kinda worried someone is gonna show up and see the unfinished version!
---
I've seen no one claim FO76 has PS2 graphics.
---
Can’t remember my main did it awhile back.
---
My alt thinks it’s too low.  
---
Trying to get to savage divide as the alt, to start order quest without being harassed by griefers
---
But it’s been a PITA.
---
Then i will add you later :)
---
OK, if I got it right 4 pm eastern time is 11 pm here, so I will try to be online then. I will send you a message(throu psn) if I can't, but probably I can.
---
Lol 
---
......ok?
---
Unlikely to get it repeatedly destroyed unless you've built in a position blocking people though.
---
Would you take 300 caps, and a few legendary armor?
---
Amazing! 
---
that's some kid that has eaten so meany bonbleheads that he can move in the real world :D
---
I'll give you 4 for 2k.
---
Mhm. There's a way to kill people via slap damage just by stacking a lot of bobbleheads. Sorry bud.
---
XD. Like why can they do this though. I just want to farm scrap for my bigguns
---
a power armor mounted unarmed weapon would be cool, like not a regular hammer or anything but i mean like a mod that you could assemble on your power armor which would work with unarmed perks
---
imagine a power fist on the excavator or a deathclaw gauntlet on a raider power armor
---
If you want to switch it up before you decide to hang yourself out of boredom Watoga spawns a lot of legendaries too, without needing a nuke
---
I play more for the quests, so my camp is just a shack with all the crafting stations and a few turrets to keep the scorched out. Even when it's been completely leveled by other players, it's only a handful of materials to repair. 
---
Lol
---
Ok awesome
---
I accidently sold mine when clicking through at a vendor and it wasn't present in his inventory to buy back. F.
---
Well damn. That's not at all fair to player who just want to play the game without dying to the antichrist
---
You could try blocking.
---
&gt; I had tamed a deathclaw. I had to move because players are murderous
---
There seems to be a slight issue with them at the moment, for whatever reason tamed deathclaws will attack anyone who is not a team member on sight. So to those players that did attack it, they likely only did so because it charged them first.
---
Thank you for the guide, I'll save for later reference.
---
Deal?
---
Theres a separate dedicated trading reddit, you should try over there.
---
My psn is thunderstrom0831 been farming for ever
---
Can't block when one minute he's attacking the workshop and the next he's in the air and then you die to an explosion
---
Does it work on X01 armor?  I'm trying to find something better than my Patriot paint and I'm not really sure where to start.
---
300 caps, one time deal add me Superdane814 
---
I’ll add you when I can get on my PS4 later today.
---
From my memory, not that much. 2-3 bags holding boards in place. Not sure what’s in the control room on the 2nd fl
---
I found a glitcher at White Springs. Guy was invisible the entire 15 minutes I was at his camp. Only after I started attacking his base did he stop glitching and attempt to stop me. He had to have to higher level characters come kill me off as he couldn't hurt me despite him being 20 levels higher (I was in  PA and have a strong melee). He was baiting the ghouls at WS to farm legendary weapons and wasn't happy that someone caught on to his cheating.  
---
Just added you. Getting on now if your still on
---
I do not know where I saw this so take it with a grain of salt, but I'm pretty sure I remember reading that after x amount of tries, it will automatically succeed, and Luck DOES affect it. My Luck is at 11, I activate them every time I see them, I'm level 66, and I only have 2 pies. 
---
I do the opposite, I use the radiation from corpses, water, ghouls and barrels with Ghoulish perk to heal more. And Sun Kissed perk then removes the radiation, I’m healed without stimpacks, radaways, medical perks and food.
---
I know right like wtf 1980 bobbleheads
---
Alright, thx for the info’s 👍🏻
---
But just scraped my x01 jet pack mod a minute ago with junk... Fml
---
removed... good old censorship.
---
just join a server, take note of the players in your server and do what OP said. then when you are rejoining go to your recent players tab and look for one of the names from the server you stored your stuff on.
---
Especially if some jackass is going to say 50k caps. I can see this person getting one for maybe 2k if he asks nicely. 
---
Yeah. The countryside areas aren’t bad, but a lot of the game is so unremarkable with...*mushy* textures, for lack of a better word. Exploring West-Tek was one of the most depressing gaming experiences I’ve ever had; not for the tragedies that took place there, but because the interior was so ugly and repetitive. 
---
Stuff like that makes such a difference 
---
Block him before he gets to you.
---
Ummh, would it if they've equipped fireproof 3 and dense torso though? I used some of my 31 or so unused level on my main as soon as I read the patch notes ... not died since. Not tempted to use the area expansion perk yet though. ;)
---
I like T45 the best, cause Fallout 3.
---
After I commented, i realized you meant block him in game. I'll do that.
---
Maybe because plasma damage is split between physical and energy it counts as two ticks of damage and therefore breaks twice as fast?
---
Go left when you get in the reactor room and pick the lvl 3 door, hack the lvl 3 terminal, and you've bypassed that room entirely. Use grenades or an explosive weapon on the mainframe cores to save time. Invest in Incisor even if you aren't a melee build because the assaultrons and gutsys are a bit spongy. Stock up on steel and circuitry and just repair the cores you need to replace. For launch prep you should ideally have an explosive weapon or a strong melee if you're not on a team. Once you learn your way around the silo and can handle the enemies it takes a lot less time and effort. I usually take around 20-30 minutes solo and around 10-15 minutes in a group. Hopefully these help!
---
FWIW my alt is about the same, lvl 17 or 18.
---
I think the game adjusts to the lowest user 
---
The muties generally give more xp then cryptids or scorche and they always pack weapons and gunpowder 
---
I've fought her 20+ times and it's easier with more bodies there. They can gatekeep their wrong assumption I personally think it's a good laugh  
---
What console are you on? Want to team up for some farming and quests?
---
Isn't that a bit... Unnecessary?
---
Yeah same here.  I'm level 114 and I've gotten 1 exploding minigun (Not a two shot) and just last night I got a two shot gatling laser (non-explosive).
---
I have enough caps to probably get a TSE from a trader but I'd rather find one myself.  It's just getting a little frustrating but what else am I playing for I guess.
---
I needed to transfer items from my main to my alt based on build specs, took awhile but I got a friend to quickly hold my gear as I swapped toons.
---
I agree wish there was a better way then me imposing on friends
---
r/nothingeverhappens even with photos you think its a that happened
---
What system?
---
Yeah, wear the prisoner collar (what I read to do at least)
---
I've now got a new purpose in fallout, thanks!
---
What PA, does it work with ?
---
The first nuke was exciting... but after you constantly drop them, it starts to get boring, especially when they're at the same locations everytime just so you can kill a bunch of bloated glowing ones for the possiblity of getting legendary weapons that nobody will buy, and then you're just stuck there with your stash box full and overencumbered just because you can't scrap nor sell your legendaries because of the 200 cap limit!
---
Yeah thats my doubt, because scorchbeast is indeed an animal (at least looks like one, it has the "beast" on its name), and does not carry the name "scorched", just "scorch". I need to find some 1* zealot and hunters to run some tests.
---
Doing god's work. Shame it's locked to one set of PA
---
And supports duping business.
---
Im not sure because the vendor almost always has 1 PA mod plan, and he had a different common one after dude lagged away.
---
I am around most nights, after 8PM and most weekends any time. Just let me know when you are dropping the nuke and I can be there. I should be able to bring a friend or 2 as well. So far I have never seen a lack of people when going after the queen, but sometimes there are far too many low level players. 
---
Checked a website, highest level I found was 25. It says it here:
---
https://gearnuke.com/fallout-76-power-armor-stats-ultracite-x-01-prototype-x-01-t-60-t51b-t45-excavator-raider/
---
I am on PS4, fellow console bro
---
Since when , I can’t find any stats on the wikis about it 
---
I know this is old, but i just happened to see your post when i did a search for Johnson's acre. This is great fun, i always make sure to launch them every time I am there :D
---
On one occasion, there was no prompt to turn on the trap. I think if a non-event Scorchbeast spawns before you get there, the trap can't be activated.
---
Well I'm taking my axe back...
---
Can I ask about your use of fo76edit? I'm really interested in creating hyper-detailed maps with plants, ores, item respawns and more. Since you used a script to extract some of these, do you think it would be possible to extract the objects from the appalachia map and their coordinates?
---
Whoosh!
---
Think he just did! 
---
No. Gear should matter, just they need to balance it. If it so hard to balance, then maybe they shouldnt use % values and instead use actual hard value. This way you know, that when I apply all chems and use best in slot effect weapon and all the perks to increase damage, I  am going to do 400 damage maximum. Now you know that is the cap of damage and if achieving that cap is too easy and it's double the ammount player can survive in max gear, you know you need to tune down that damage. Not a f#cking rocket science to figure it out. 
---
It’ll have two legendary traits, one “fires an additional projectile” (two shot) and “bullets explode on impact” (explosive)
---
Alright thanks man, if it's too much of a pain I get it. 
---
It’s true. But usually it’s not necessary. I am just always sneaking due to habits. 
---
Or he was just being annoying.
---
I see it regularly at both Watoga vendors.
---
The pit from fallout 3 would work for battlegrounds. I imagine it would work like the battlegrounds in ESO
---
Which PA set does this apply to?
---
Please don't shatter my fantasy or i'll downvote you to protect my fantasy. 
---
When i'm not in my downvote hobby mode,
---
I feed MTX cancer. Everybody gotta eat, right? Also I'm happy that this is my second job and that I pay for.
---
&gt; YOU ARE DOING THAT TOO MUCH. TRY AGAIN IN 9 MINUTES.
---
hi reddit gods. If i pay you premium do i get rid of this kind of censorship?
---
Around in the toxic valley. Look for thin white trees and you can harvest from them. I know if you start facing the workshop for hemlock holes and walk to your right there’s one or two just outside the boundaries.
---
it easier to collect 10k caps and buy it from forums, then it is to get it from nukes.
---
I use melee weapon and hit the bag, it usually work if they look at me and don't run away when i'm in the pip boy dropping things
---
something is wrong with the lot tables for sure; like the explosive ultracite leg vent dropping every goddamn time. this is the least fun ive had doing endgame stuff in a bethesda game. By which i mean the least rewarding experience.
---
The noodle monster
---
I don't want another battle royale. There's too many companies doing that right now.
---
Seems like the dev's never take off their boots of blinding speed when they QC'd their games.

marine armor set with a gas mask and combat armor helmet. Rocking a fire axe and shotgun as my mains.

Yep lol, that's when I'm not in my power armor

T-51b helmet, t-60 arms and x-01 torso and legs lol

I’m on pc.

Actually the 1 I built to play fo4! Lolz

Nah, he always commits suicide. Afterwards you find a funny holotape on his body about it.

If you’re trading while he dies, you can finish the trade. 
---
How do more people make the event harder?
---
From those who HAVE to those who WANT = 
---
Instant gratification for the entitled generation.
---
No problem. I would probably be online then anyways.
---
Ps. Today is the patchday, so we have to download it first.
---
Nice read. :)
---
Alrighty thanks bud
---
Always
---
My only fear is that sooner or later the game becomes too easy once you reach a high level. Fortunately I'm still lvl 16 so I still have some way to go.
---
It was the start of nuking season that made me move from white springs!  
---
I read somewhere on here that it's a super rare reward from the event Uranium Fever 
---
Scarcity is the foundation of Capitalism.
---
I usually just take a second and go to the bathroom or grab a snack. It only takes a couple minutes for someone to get bored and move on... unless they really hate you.

I hide mine deep inside my base inside a cupboard, can people still see it then or?

Plan: 50Cal Machine Gun

Price: \~810
---
No, that's in the game.
---
So, is end game gonna be dropping a nuke?
---
This is lovely, and inspired 
---
its bugged on pc
---
Along with J. Edgar Hines on enforcement.
---
You guys obviously cant take a joke.
---
Ahhh ok. Thank you! 
---
Timezone ?
---
Ok I'll have to get all of my combat armor at max level then. I have a few pieces that are legendary, but they are level 35. Thanks
---
A wedding in a video game seems dumb. But to each their own. Would have been funny if someone nuked them all.
---
I do. I also have max luck of the draw and max weapon artisan. Luck of the draw doesn’t proc as much as I’d like but it does repair a lot at once, and weapon artisan at least helps keep the good times rolling for twice as long. Super efficient in nuke zones while it lasts 
---
Thanks for the info mate 😉
---
Mushy is the right word. I understand there's a lot  that goes into a game of this scale, so I understand if it isn't the best looking game.
---
It just bugs me when people try to say it has good graphics, which it's not for most scenes. It's insulting to all these other recent game releases that actually are very pretty.
---
This probably explains why some dude kept trying to trade with me but wasnt actually offering anything. 
---
How about killing a level 90 scortchbeast queen *** only for the infinite loading loop on the drop screen. As i always say. Good bye my pretty drops. 
---
CHINA WILL PREVAIL (gets dragged away)
---
or turns the player into a Liberator robot with only a wanted poster in  inventory.
---
Unless the game publisher allows you to sell account/items etc (like in Diablo 3 with AH at one point), it is illegal to profit from selling those to others.
---
Oh yeah, hopefully it helps the game out.. 
---
Personal opinion, it's all about looks, the XO has the highest rad resistance, making it the best for nuke zones, but that is negligible since a radsponge+ghoulish combo will make you unkillable there.
---
The t51 has the highest physical defense, but again unless you are running empathy mutation you won't see much of a difference by using this one or another one.
---
The ultracite armor has the best energy defense, but , there ain't that many enemies who hit you with energy beams.
---
The t61 has the lowest repair costs, if you do not have the perks to increase the armor durability or time to break this might be for you, running a PA while charging towards enemies can break you armor in about 10 hours which is the time that will take you to get all the materials to repair XD, but on other hand if you do have those perk cards you won't even notice you are using a PA, been using it from lvl 150-190 without repairing it.
---
The excavator gets an upvote for the amazing capability it has, that extra 100 points you can carry makes your life hella easier.maybe I'll consider this one for the BEST.
---
But again I think it's about personal preference.
---
American Horror Story-Coven. (and maybe another season that I won't spoil)
---
Yeah, i Have been using one of my mates to transfer. we tend to do it for each other but it is a pain sometimes. there should definitely be a account based vault.
---
I have read the plans for all Marine Armor Deep Pocketing, so I can mod all Pieces, but don't use the marine Armor myself.
---
Wood scrap.
---
I'm not sure how to one-up this with my other half. That's absolutely hilarious and beautiful, haha.
---
Yeah, if accompanied with Padded chest mod and Dodgy agi perk
---
FYI the Gauss rifle physical sights are misaligned, the shot goes slightly below where you aim if you're not using a scopd
---
Awesome gesture dude/dudette.
---
How weird. Definitely one of the most frustrating bugs I've encountered
---
Become a trader , considering you have been farming,yoy must have lots of caps or legendaries , a good legndary can get you a 1000 caps , I bought a tse lmg for 1500 and a tse 50 cal for 2000, use the bazaar to sell and buy, just watch out for dupers and NEVER spend real money 
---
Picklock 3 lets you skip the reactor section. Shotguns with cripple perks disables Assaultrons in just seconds. That’s what works for me.
---
I had wondered about this. So Last Laugh does drop your own grenades? I just assumed it dropped a generic fragmentation grenade (and not even one from your inventory - just a magically spawned one).
---
Oh yea, sorry... My bad.
---
10+ years of running and working on game servers, from old MMORPG's such as Mir Revenge to modern titles like Ark &amp; FiveM means I know nothing.
---
I'm a bad person.
---
I’m just doing my part. I am a disabled stay at home replacement dad. I got the time for people, and many people use games as a coping mechanism. I am just seeing a problem and filling the gap.
---
Sweet! I was planning on spending 10k. Let me know if you've got a plan for the mole miner gauntlet, or a buzz blade.
---
&gt;The next safest region is the Ash Heap
---
First time I went there I met a friendly level 70 something Glowing Yao Guai and a level 50 Bloated Glowing One. But otherwise it is a safe-ish region 
---
The only choice you have for XO1 is Atom Store paints 
---
I assume most people already have a habit of sneaking most of the time.
---
It doesn't unfortunately.
---
I've been mixing and matching, looking for something that looks sharp.  Plus I've got to honor the memory of the stranger who left me my set of Raider PA, poor bastard died of a gutshot.
---
So far I think I'm happy with a mix of X-01, Raider, and T-51b pieces.
---
I guess my pimp game is weak. Do you know what I am saying?
---
T51
---
51
---
Random daily/quest reward? any ideas where?
---
Pacifist mode doesn't stop you from being attacked or taking damage.  It merely stops you from damaging other players, to avoid accidental PVP.
---
That said, my friends and I found out this week (the hard way) that capturing workshops allows other players to attack you without any real consequence.  If you own a workshop, you can become a target for PVP players to attack you without being flagged as wanted.
---
Ok, well I just say what everyone else says.  "I'm roleplaying a raider"
---
Dammmmmmmn!  You got his purified water, you showed his ass! 
---
Yep, I'm using it plus a Dense chest mod and explosives are barely touching me. Plus I've been tanking scorchbeast sonic attacks with my face, so it works for that too. 
---
So fucking true!
---
I found mine at Drop Site V9, after killing a Mirelurk Queen and 3 Major Gutsy.
---
Good luck with that. ;)
---
Xbox gets the new patch today, can’t wait. 
---
Most of them know this, it's why they do the marsupial jump before shooting.
---
Turn your light on and off while looking at the parcel they tend to get the idea more often.
---
Don't you just like spend $20??
---
That's weird. It shows t51 at lvl 30 and t60 at lvl 40. I have full sets of both of those at lvl 50. They didn't do their research over there lol
---
It would be even more hilarious if a duper dropped 10000 propaganda fliers and one IOU Whiskey note.
---
[](/cutealoo)
---
It depends on your build bro... My low HP build has 3* robot armor with unyielding,+1str and either DMG reduction or decreased weight for junk. 9/10 of my deaths are for either fall damage or me being stupid with a tse weapon, I can ohk the enemies, popping a diluted stimpack makes me invulnerable for 15 secs which is all I need to get rid of all the enemies, (1 regular stimpack with chem+superduper= 8 diluted) 
---
If you don't want to spend all your perk cards on going for a specific build just go deep pocket vanguard weightless marine armor if you keep your house topped up you are unkillable, that DMG resistance is just op, as long as you have a friend with radsponge 2-3 while on nuke zones any non pa set works.
---
From the main menu you can toggle between which toon you want to play, so from account management, it’s 1/2 way there
---
Gatling laser and plasma are hot garbage atm. Both break incredibly fast unless you repair them with the weapon artisan perk. Gatling Laser is arguably worse considering it does considerably less damage.
---
I don't :( After 200 hours, hundreds of visits to the enclave bunker, I've never even seen one
---
What does it change?
---
It's not much, but it's a small win, considering him and his friends were triple+ my level
---
This is why I reported that "How to hunt dupers for fun" post on here a few days ago (it got taken down), even though no names are mentioned, it just incites witch hunting, and it gets normal players harassed. If you think someone is duping just record it.
---
You have no right to demand to see someone's inventory and killing them if they decline either.
---
Haven’t been one shot by anyone past slap damage. Guess I’m lucky? 
---
You can at least repair guns and power armor to 200%. 
---
I've been trying to modify my bouldertop camp in the Savage Divide for weeks but the floaty foundation problem was causing me major pain. I'll be playing with this as soon as I get home from work! Good job!
---
We run managed desktops at work, so I don’t view non work stuff at my work pc.
---
But you’d think a simple question wouldn’t get h8
---
Let’s hope it’ll come back soon. 
---
Not the dumbass level 19s in Grafton today. They’d shoot and be killed when I’d stand in front of them. Good times. I got some nice junk tho 
---
I'll start that tomorrow morning if I can, with my Priest of Atom.
---
You're the signal Atom expected.
---
Totally agree. Annoying as all hell!
---
100% 
---
and calling other people nerds, which isnt even an insult for most people..
---
So people won't build camps with nothing but turrets.
---
Thanks for the tip, will definitely try this!
---
Ye i was finding them too for first few times, but its hard to find all 15. You need to get 15damaged of them, then head to tinkerer workbench (maybe other workbenches have this option too, never tried) and then craft under Quest mainframe cores you will need some circuity and steel (it drops from robots so u dont lose much).
---
It reduces the bonus from 20% to 15% per level but adds explosive resist to the fire resist.
---
I saw a large desk fan at a furniture and the urge to pick it up was strong.
---
ha ha that was well played!
---
I keep seeing people talking about other players messaging them and couldn't figure out how. It finally occured to me while reading your post that it's because you're on console... Now I feel dumb
---
Ah ok, I didn't realize that. I didn't even know the one I grabbed said *man*. I just grabbed it and put it in my stash since it I hadn't come across it before or since. 
---
Scorched is a ghoul variant. They are ghouls who have contracted the scorched plague. Scorchbeasts are classified as animals but the damage they do is divided into different types. Idk if an armor with -xx% from animals affect everything it does (or it should but it's bugged) 
---
If you want to play it safe maybe take these points into consideration:
---
- Poison Mist - Radiation Damage
---
- Sonic Wave - Energy Damage with an explosive modifier
---
- Melee - well, melee..
---
The perk used to be resistance against fire, it has been updated to be resistance against fire AND explosives (like from TSE weapons). The Dense armor mod also gives additional protection from explosives so the only damage you take is from the bullets.
---
Lol that's why you lock that shit😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
---
“Get back into this game.” It quite literally JUST dropped a couple of months ago. 😂👌
---
Great little story. Very pleased that you like the game at least as much as I do. I haven't launched The Big One yet. Been roaming around and killing baddies and generally enjoying myself. There is so much to explore and do. Usually I use guns, but yesterday I killed a couple of Scorched by simply punching them in the face (wearing PA). Very satisfying !! :) 
---
There is a random spawn event near overseers camp, you might see a small graveyard spawn, just on the other side of the path, in one of the graves is the forest camo jumpsuit.
---
You can tell if the graveyard spawns if you see robots or ghouls standing around there when you spawn into the overseers camp.
---
So you need 3hacking, but with this u can also disable all turets in that room, there is computer for all 5 rooms.
---
None, scorch beast is scorch beast that's all... Not an animal, not a scorched it's a different enemy, hence why the weapons with the hunter or scorched perks do not affect your damage output, just the prime receivers. If you are looking for perks to increase your defense against them (I'm guessing the Sonic attack) go fireproof plus dense mod (1 is ok if you run a non pa build) 
---
Yeah, I do this too. The difference is that I never find nice people, just a couple of dupers.
---
Eh servers have been more stable in starting to see double and triple nukes on the she site
---
As a melee player while the Queen is flapping around I'll clear anything on the ground and wait for her to land. Lvl 81
---
Aren't you tired of being that angry ? 
---
No one said the developers had to be thanked or whatever, or it was bethesda's idea. 
---
And stop with your nostalgia, games in the past were sometimes good, sometimes bad, and noone said 76 was at the height of Legend of Zelda or whatever. 
---
One guy said "I'mma try a hardcore run, what do you think", and you crash into the place shouting "THIS GAME IS A PILE OF SHIT TETRIS HAD A BETTER STORY !!1!"
---
Please stay on skyrim.
---
This is a really needed emote. Everytime I show up at Vault 76 to give a new player stuff they run away in terror.
---
It's capped at 40. If you're 50 plus and running it for anything other than gears and black titanium you're wasting your time
---
It's not. SB is a different category which only applies to SB and SBQ
---
I have been striking MTHS every time I log on (even after DCs), I gotta get those mods for Combat armor!  Needs mucho plastic.
---
I will continue to do so until I have them all! Muahaha.
---
Also it would greatly satisfy my OCD to be able to top them all up to full when I want
---
I'd say if the Nuke falls on you, that's life, and in your case, death.
---
Watoga HS is over 75 plastic...I don’t know the exact number.
---
Sounds like I could use it so I wouldnt 1 shot myself when shooting things close to me.
---
Sounds like it would become used a fair bit. But I'm just wondering how effective it would be if someone maxed out the damage for there shotguns and had the explosives expert and bloody mess on all at the same time during pvp which one would win. I guess I will have to wait and see how well it works.
---
Not disadvantage, but leveled. You bring a jet to a car race, that's unfair, although you build your jet. Everybody have the same perk points above 50, just different distribution. That's incomparable to the unbalancing legendary effects.
---
I like the pillar with the stairs you can put your camp in the ring at the top and build a 10 story base
---
The SBQ drops serum recipes sometimes. Once you have the recipes they are REALLY cheap (material wise) to make!
---
this is amazing
---
I’m on pc but usually when someone drops a nuke on the prime fissure enough people show up to take down the queen. I’m at level 137 and have only seen the quest fail twice. My game has crashed or disconnected during the battle several times but things were looking bad for the queen each time. I feel like it’s our Appalachian civic duty to jump in and help with this quest whenever it pops up. 
---
Scrapping important stuff pretty much stops being an issue once most of your gear is some kind of legendary (might be worth it keeping an item with a useless perk only because you can't scrap it anymore). Otherwise, slow down! Clicking, crafting and dropping stuff more slowly has significantly reduced the disconnects/freezes for me on top of not losing stuff that wasn't intended to be thrown or sold.
---
Everyone has the same chance to get legendaries. You are talking about making people's builds nullified as people build around their legendaries.
---
I see, that answer my question, thank you!
---
No! It just ain't right I tell you!
---
had my turret attack me yesterday 
---
Yep. I mean I farmed a load and got shit. Not a single explosive weapon in hours. TSE handmade for 1400 caps? Done. I'm not gonna ask where it came from (don't need to)....
---
what if i don`t know about a site with codes or don`t even think about it?
---
Oh I see. So i can't claim workshops if i want to be peaceful 
---
SB is an animal, and also a creature and also a scorched, or at least is how I see it, but no matter what your personal opinion might be, the game has a separate category for it, which is Scorched Beast, only those and the queen fall in that category and the only buff available against them is the prime receivers, and it's for damage not defense. Please verify your answer before stating something as true, have fun.
---
good stuff thanks! is the scout armor you get from the enclave any good? i've seen the plans for sale in the bunker but never bothered with it yet.
---
I started playing on day one of the official launch and experienced almost no bugs and few disconnects. I probably played around forty hours that first week, before the patches. Can't you understand that not everyone had the same experience as you? 
---
Liberty Prime intensifies. 
---
What exactly do you mean about better when at full durability? 
---
Did you just publicly place a permit for people to pilfer your porta pooper of pilfered paraphernalia?
---
Had to step in XD you got 2 bad answers miss guiding you , have fun!
---
herbivore + green thumbs = greatness
---
On PS you don't even need two copies as you can have two accounts on a single PS4 and share purchases. If you have 2 PS4s you can play games simultaneously on both those accounts.
---
Thank you so much for this, for real. No 11 minute video, where you don't actually tell us how to get it. Literally a paragraph, with 5 bullet points. Got any more walkthroughs for PA?
---
I think energy dmg is weak so I use all metal armor for ballistic resistance.
---
Even level 35 and 40 weapons can be OP at 3*. There is a very popular duped Two Shot, Explosive, faster reload speed Handmade that is still very good for being level 35.
---
I have a T60. By replacing the helmet with an Excavator helmet, the weight went from 205 to 225. So it seems like each piece adds a little.
---
Also you can get a lot of steel all boxes have some + picking up everything including weapons at the end and scraping them all
---
The explosive ones stack, so if you have an explosive weapon you can use all of them and deal 100k+ damage..
---
I'm using a mixture of heavy leather, marine and combat armor. Plus Grounded and Scaly Skin mutations. My damage resistance and energy resistance is fairly decent. 
---
I was using Evasive at the lower levels, got rid of it a while back. 
---
You can.  I do all the time, but you just have to be aware that it does make you a potential target.  I personally have never been attacked or killed by another player, and I would capture Workshops constantly (I have only played for about a month though).
---
My other friend is 10 levels lower than me, and he too started capturing Workshops this past week as I showed him all the exp and rewards he could get.  In the past 3 days he was killed 4 times by higher level players.  One killed him twice at his workshop.  The other killed him twice at Whitespring resort.
---
There are only rumors that its happening.
---
But in reality, the lagging and DCs on the PC have not happened at all since patch.   I think there was a couple of stutters and then it stopped.
---
What normally happens during duping is a pattern, you get the "Server not responding" prompt almost every 10 seconds for like 15-20 minutes.  Just becomes unplayable.   That is no longer happening at all.
---
People "claim" there is a rollback-server thing now, but doubt it.  Most likely it involved the workshop crashing the server which they fixed with hotfix.  Servers have been much more stable!  Its almost as if we can claim workshops now!
---
Don’t even think about it, I thought it was common knowledge that the codes are available on the internet and you don’t need to know the name Oda site with codes because google exists 
---
I get those too! Come on over!
---
Also, level 14.
---
Why would it help with scorchbeasts?
---
As I said before, depends on your build and your playstyle ,  escape artist, night vision and a chameleon perk on your armor will make range shooting negligible. 
---
&gt;enclave any good?
---
Yes it is decent, but I would take legendary perks like vanguard, unyielding or chameleon on a low level wood armor set, over a full max lvl max moded any other armor 
---
I seriously doubt the duping has everything to do with server crashes. I honestly believe the servers are just shit even if there was no duping.
---
Yesterday I had a lvl 68 scorched glitched in a wall at my base on the second floor. The first floor walls and the door were untouched. The enemy spawns are ridiculous. 
---
Maybe I get my Hands on a TS 10mm. I'd like to try a pistol Stealth build with the chameleon mutation
---
I understand why they do this but its so frustrating when you're just trying to help
---
Woah
---
I'm level 70, yet to complete I am become death, but I have collected 5 key cards already 😂🤣😂
---
Schrodinger's Ammo - it's both infinite and zero until it's observed.
---
And a set of power armor, and the All Rise. 
---
workshops are pvp events, it tells you on when spending the caps to claim the workshop you will be attackable
---
&gt; Some of the deposits are in the carts
---
Now he tells me.
---
It's a pain in the arse finding the lead deposits in Lucky Hole.
---
Not if you’re a stealth build. Bitch, I AM a stealth boy. 
---
Lol I had the tent encounter with the dead ghouls spawn on a piece of artillery so when I fired it it blew itself up
---
I remember it was an event actually SBQ no wonder why it was killed fast damn dupers
---
I love the look of the game. Shonky in places, but more often great. Some of it is breath taking.
---
Oh noes, now Bethesda have another reload animation to fix.
---
It definitely does increase as you level. I max out my budget, then fine back after a few levels and add until I max the budget again.
---
I have seen him a couple of times now, in very different parts of the map. Sometimes he has interesting stuff and sometimes it's pretty useless. But every time I check to see what he has got, you never know - and it's alway nice to give Moo-moo a little pat. 
---
I do the exact same thing and hope that when crafting it doesn't give away the position. I have only had one visitor since launch, I am in a fairly busy cell location so people are usually zipping around me, but I am in a part of the map that offers nothing but a steep climb and wasted time if you are fast traveling there. 
---
I know how some people are, so when I see a blip heading to my camp, even while away, I just jump servers. The one visitor was crouching too, I didn't even see him while I was crafting &amp; constantly map checking. 
---
Their spam wave has an explosive modifier
---
That's why Summer's Haven has a sherriff. Nobody comes destroying my town when sherriff is on duty.
---
Instead of server not responding and disconnected from server there’s been an increased number of crash to desktops and rollbacks.  Can’t say if this is duping related but stability is still elusive.  Dupers aren’t all banned - and bobble head stacking is for real.
---
Another great tactic sometimes 👍
---
I thought it was just energy good to know
---
Lol course there has to be a glitched PA chassis in the background of some of them! I swear those things follow me around. Awesome post. 
---
While I can't tell if they have TS, in my experience the number of people who even have an explosive weapon is quite low.
---
Regardless of random enounters or in nuke zones or even during the Queen, it's maybe 1/10 or 1/20 players that actually uses a weapon with explosive.
---
I don't know about dogs but people have tamed cats.
---
Someone should make a hack so we can craft legendary add-on mods to our weapons in the weapons bench like in FO4
---
I think poster above is talking about the plans being around 20k. 
---
Never seen actual serums drop from the queen.  I have heard about the plans dropping though.
---
Everyone gets the classic Fallout games regardless of platform you play Fallout 76 on. You can only download them if you install the Bethesda Launcher on a PC.
---
The first queen fight I went to was in my 50s I think. I shot at the queen, realised I was doing close to zero damage but others had that in hand so I thought to myself, "I can probably help by keeping the rest of the things off those guys." It's just playing smart and doing what you can to help but there are some selfish people and some stupid people, then there are the selfish dumb people. This suggestion of yours is something I did by default when I saw how I wasn't doing measurable damage.
---
There should also be no use of TSE at Whitesprings and if you see someone running towards a mob you could kill in another hit it's probably because they'd like to get a hit too. Don't swat it in front of them and then act surprised when you watched them running towards you.
---
I’m with you about end game events! We need a max level event like uranium fever to farm legendarys. They’ve nerfed so much anyway in regards to farming and workshops. It would be a welcome addition 
---
I used Green chem and got it down to 4k.    Forgot name of the Green one.  But it works.   I need to get Hard Bargain as well and combine them and see.   I dont want to buy from players because do not want to give dupers any caps.
---
Imagine excavator,+ calibrated shocks+ double carry weight glitch
---
Just yesterday I popped in to the Overseer camp to give a level 5 like 40 plans I have extra. Put them on the ground and do the follow emote. He doesn't get it. Start jumping up and down. He doesnt get it. Do the shooting at the ground thing. He gets jumpy and starts shooting me with his crappy pipe pistol. Over and over despite me taking it without fighting back and still doing the follow emote. After a good minute I am almost dead so I give up and walk away. He eventually actually kills me because I frankly forgot to make more Stims. Must have actually been a pretty good day for him to beat someone 50 levels higher than him. Until I used revenge and my highly refined ni ha skills to sneak up and gut him. Would have left him alone if the little twat didnt strait ignore the fact I was trying to help him and still attacked after several emotes and my attempt to leave. 
---
I think you can get a broad range of enemies in the Ash Heap; from low to high. In the Savage Divide it's medium to high. In the Mire and Cranberry Bog it's more like high to oh-my-god.
---
How's about No. Nobody in their right mind would willingly wear anything with that slogan on it
---
Watoga. Saw it there last night
---
Enemies will spawn on your camp only if there is someone nearby, had the same issue, changing your camp to a secluded area will avoid your camp being destroyed while you are not there. 
---
Mole rats attack walls, if you use 2 concrete foundation and place then as high as you can and set a stair then build your home on the second floor, molerats won't be able to atack your camp, you can use the bonfire to plant crops indoors same for small water purifiers. 
---
Now if you are set with your camp and do not want to move/rebuild just get a pet, they will increase your turret range by a LOT and will.hunt down creatures turrets can't reach
---
It's taken from your money. 
---
They really gotta do something about the explosive legendary effect 
---
Yes, but the serums also have side benefit of stopped any negative effects for 1 hour.   If you have bunches of serums, you have zero negative effects without using any perk cards.
---
As long as it says made in China.
---
I definitely felt the "oh-my-god" moments
---
I have come to consider CAMP placement one of the strategic challenges of the game.  Defenses help against low-level spawns, but vs. players, the best defense is not to be found.
---
My current CAMP is on the side of a ravine, with trees obscuring the view.  I planted my corn and tatos in a random, disbursed arrangement so as not to draw attention.  I use the small tent instead of a building to sleep in, and the tent and my crafting benches are tucked behind some low 3-sided concrete barriers that are somewhat close to the color of the rock walls of the ravine, with a few mutfruit bushes in front of the barriers to break up the straight lines.  The three gun turrets are placed low, not high, sacrificing range in order to keep their motion hidden.  The biggest thing in CAMP is my water purifier, and that is nestled in a crag in the side of the ravine...as concealed as I could place it.
---
I crouch while picking my crops and moving around my camp, to minimize my visibility on the map.
---
I am more interested if i can pick the last mutations i want for my build
---
Same branch of the government that was fine with the super mutant experiments, no doubt.
---
There are logs where some soldiers are like "This ain't right" and they get replaced real quick.
---
As someone who still needs to level and considering the way inconsiderate TSE folk are at whitesprings - no issue with the mechanic. I dont mind that you have it, but you could switch to a different gun there and share. I ask people politely all of the time to switch so everyone can have fun. Those that don't, making them eat their own bullet becomes my purpose.
---
There's a way to do so on PS4. It doesn't always work, though.
---
As long as we implement a certain president as one of those mutated toads that attacks with its own vomit 
---
Recently for people in your server at the moment I’ve never found a name in there from another server I left
---
They won't. Dupers, and everyone who buys duped items are safe.
---
So you really want higher stats all the time? 
---
The extra DR/ER is because you perk for it. Not everyone does. They could also just set the Max to 100% and you only repair above that with perks. 
---
Or it could have just been extra durability with no other bonus and no one would perk for it. 
---
They gave you something for perking. They could also just nerf it.
---
Thanks for the information, much obliged.
---
&gt; This isn't a bug but a way of enforcing a fair system, according to bethesda. Which I do not understand, but do respect.
---
I, too, don't understand.  I would still prefer a system that allows me to shed weight by selling heavy items in exchange for low-weight items, even if I don't need them, simply so I retain some degree of the capital.  
---
It's a dodgy economy / game design that requires me to throw away legendaries to be able to effectively move.
---
I know, but if I don't have caps there is still a bounty to collect. It's not like it's duping or even hurting anybody.
---
Yup.  Youll get there eventually :-)
---
Unless you're looking for certain affixes and don't care about level
---
I use proximity chat and that has worked everytime. No need for an emote, just talk. 
---
Limit use of power connectors/ lights / foundations. An absolutely no turrets. 
---
hmm that's interesting, where's that ? Mine is near a junk pile (gotta love those trash), but I'd like to give a try to building highest possible.
---
Now I was raised not to make fun of the mentally disabled,  but even a feral ghoul knows why that's a bad idea. 
---
Thanks for the undeserved insult. Now eat your downvote and don't let the door hit you. 
---
The imgur link is in the post. Its fully decorated.
---
Is that the wiki of choice for the community?
---
Should spell it 'Tshina'.
---
Which let's face it unless you're running a berserker weapon (lower armor = higher damage) is pretty pointless
---
Remove the turrets an limit lights. They eat the most budget!
---
This is my experience too, also on PC. One bad experience with other players, in hundreds of game hours.
---
Items above 100% condition have boosted stats.  You can see that little white bar on top of the normal yellow condition bar.
---
151 here. No TSE drops for me. Best I've got is a Double Explosive Gauss and a TS Minigun. 
---
Meanwhile Jimmy the kid over here has 6 TSE guns!
---
Trade buttons are private parts. Bad touch.
---
That's my gameplay loop as well. I make CAMPS like this take pictures hang out in it for a but then move onto the next camp or help noobs.
---
I see your point - I'm hoping I will find some way to keep enjoying the game.
---
Idk, it gives placeholders till you get higher level gear if you ask me, like for a matching armor set you want all the same affixes, I'll throw on a LV 40 over a LV 50 if it has the right affixes for my build
---
not sure of the details but I found a number of random items I build require me to actually have all the materials in my inventory and not in my stash, ammo being the weirdest one for this. I can craft energy ammo but have to put all mats into my inventory to craft ballistic. I think this is a result of them trying to stop mods and quest items from being used in crafting.
---
Now how about they ban the dupers.
---
It's a trap! There are groups of teams that have all kinds of exploits waiting for someone to claim the bounty. Hopefully they get bored and quit. 
---
Saw a plastic spoon on the ground yesterday and got all excited to bulk something up and sell it.
---
Same, the amount of 3* legendaries I’ve encountered at whitesprings and on the rare occasion just throughout the world have dropped mainly shit like cloaking wooden left arm. I’ve only ever gotten two 3* weapons and one is shit whereas the other has the potential to be decent if I pick the right perk cards 
---
just bad luck?
---
sounds like BS man. all these “i found a duper” witch hunt posts never seem to show the stash that everyone “found” and put in a lake somewhere. give us a screenshot instead of just hear say.
---
what does it matter if you show the stuff? you were already trying to give it away. 
---
Same, last time I saw a prime nuke I waited for the notice that the scorch beast queen was dead then I went over for the regular scorch beasts, glowing ones etc, oh and flux. But I know the lay of the land now so I'll probably go to the next queen event I see (I'm at level 57 now).

Idk if this post is up still it says deleted/removed. But tbh that would be fun and super dangerous and could be like a quest in a way. 40 atoms for killing a duper or something hahaha. There could be like sheriffs or people could opt in as being  vigilantes of a sort on each server. Hunt them down 😂😂😂😂 it is a nice thought, but I think with all the instability and fps drops it's a must have fix.. 
---
I knew about the white bar. I was curious about other stats being higher.
---
Sometimes I would think, I thought that provided more. Or I thought my over all armor rating was higher. 
---
But I just never bothered to do any testing. 
---
I tried this last night after killing myself for the 187362th time with my Gauss rifle. 
---
I see it made *very* little difference. Didn't use dense tho.
---
Got mine from Graham. Totally worth it. They look super nice.
---
Build your camp in a lower level area. Use a concrete foundation. Plant your food inside your structure. Use brick or metal walls. This will make your camp much less vulnerable. 
---
Name of your gun is Sasha, right?
---
What platform? It's really bad on Xbox1 and it doesn't help that some of the dupers give away TSE weapons or sell them for 800 caps. Nuked White Springs suck ass when dill holes are slaying groups of Glowing Ones before you can even get a shot.
---
Make it an event when we nuke the capital.

---
comunism intensifies
---
I have a 2 shot Lever action that a like. 
---
I also found a 2 shot fatman but I don't use heavy weapons. kinda either wanting to sell or maybe save for a heavy guns/ explosive character. 
---
Other than these I haven't found anything special. Especially with armor. 
---
Arhaha! I can feel your pride and joy so much. Thanks for sharing :)
---
I wish there was a way to rearrange the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. and the perk cards as you often and as much as you wanted, when you made it through the "End game". It could be awesome to try different builds.
---
Of course you can go with the tactic of not getting shot as well.  Sneak, Chameleon, ect.
---
Iron (something) - Endurance, +10/+10 resists each rank.
---
Dodge perk (agility) - Uses AP/incoming shot to reduce damage by 10% or 10?
---
White Knight (Agility) - reduces cost and wear of non-PA armors
---
Evasion (agility) - gives up to 45/45 resists, +3 for each agility stat point.
---
Blocker (strength) - Reduces incoming melee damage
---
Junk Shield (Luck?) - Reduces damage by up to 10 resist.  You should have the Junk weight reduction perk equipped as well to use this well.
---
You can easily make a tough tanky character, but you will be giving up many damage capabilities.  I guess if you focused on Charisma and support capabilities that kinda gives you defense as well by healing.   (increased radaway, stims per use)
---
I like the idea, but I know I'm too weak to actually delete my character after his death.
---
I'd like a screenshot of this.
---
Problem is then you get rid of one of the things that makes endgame bearable, therefore driving people away more than likely.
---
Beth needs an update to stop bheads stacking and but a cap on being over encumbered, once you hit 300 you can barely move and can't fast travel? Or that you can only have one type of bhead in your inventory at one time. Simple changes to make a world of difference 
---
95% of the time I am with a teammate. We have voice chat set to auto in the settings. When we come upon a random, we always hear them but the never hear us. 
---
My camp is open to all. Right next to the Morgantown airport train station. Look for the posters on the blank billboard out back and the vault boys pointing the way. I have every crafting bench, and although i'm only like level 35 I still try to drop things for new players so they have a good first experience. 
---
Oh for sure! Getting them to pick up the bag is also a trying task sometimes. I've given away thousands of rounds of 10mm, .308 and .38 along with Stimpacks but getting them to see the bag is sometimes even difficult. I almost always fast travel to the vault when I see a new player and give them stuff. I've made a lot of friends that way in the game.
---
Yawn.
---
Leather vs Energy, Combat/Marine is the in-between, metal vs Physical. There isn't a huge difference as long as its all at level with you.
---
Energy attacks are somewhat rarer then the Physical, but Robots and Scorchbeasts are some of the most irksome enemies in the game, so take that as you will.
---
Of course the true endgame state of armour is whatever 3 stars you get your hands on, so you may not gte a whole lot of choices as the base armour goes. Even when you start picking between them, its gonna depend on your build a bit.
---
not much late game content. Not much in the way of questing past level 50 or so. Anyone who is level 150 something isn't finding lots of stuff to do
---
That's fine, you don't have to believe me. I made two videos for Bethesda to decide if they want to take any action. They won't, though.
---
If you were taking a break due to the issues and bugs, the game is in a much better place now and definitely worth playing!  Get the main storyline/quests done and do some end game grinding ahead of the dlc
---
His Xbox is a big boy Xbox that he game shares hard core with his gaming buddies he’s had for years and I share with the kids. I just started playing 3 and 4 a few months before 76 came out as a favor to my husband and now I seriously cannot get enough. I feel like wtf have I been doing with my life. I for sure need my own big girl Xbox and hard core gaming buddies of my own now. 
---
I agree. You should definitely be able to modify or craft legendary weapons. After all, this is a online game service model, and not just a game. They have to reward you somewhat for playing. I have 5 TSE weapons I use from trading on reddit with other players, but have yet to find a decent legendary weapon. 
---
I have not found them yet but I hear they exist! 
---
During a radiation storm 
---
Dump them in a deep water never to be found
---
I seem to only get left arms and melee weapons :/
---
Find that Ski shop, pick up a ski sword, or a few and scrap the bad ones, I got the spiked ski sword mod doing this, the repair costs are low and it’s a pretty devastating weapon all things considered. It’s faster than the axes and does more damage than the machetes. I’m lvl 26 now and still use this thing.
---
Deffo try moving to a different area, and consider a balcony with a turret if you can spare the budget.
---
Also it’s nice that your hubby games with you. A couple that games together, stays together. Lol
---
Very nice!

Xbox One X

A friend joined the server and we teamed up just in time to catch a Nuke Zone at Prime where we made short work of the Queen and several other SBs (Mostly thanks to one guy that could take 25% off the Queen in one shot), we looted the Beast and moved on to Watoga for a bit, my friend had to log off, but I stuck around Watoga for a bit to hunt legendary' s, hoping to regain some armor, when another Nuke comes in on Fissure Prime, so off I go again.
---

---
Last Night was the worst I have experienced from FO76 to date, and I didn't get disconnected once in 4 hours.
---
I started the evening by creating a new character on my old Xbox One Elite, and then trading some stuff to that character to help get a good start (Plans, recipes, Junk, Chems, and a few low level legendary weapons), while trading I noticed that my Main character wasn't wearing all the Armor I normally have, so I figured it must have become unequipped, (That's happened a few times before), but when I went to equip it, I realized that most of my armor was simply gone. I had a complete set of 2\*-3\* legendary Polished Metal Armor, but all that was left was a Rt Arm, &amp; Rt Leg, I also had a complete set of 1\*-2\* Heavy Combat Armor, but all that was left was 1 Chest Piece.
---
This was extremely disheartening, but knowing that I have met many new friends in this game who will surely help me find replacements, I proceeded to play on.

I arrived on scene to find the Queen already down to about 70% so I laid into her with my trusty TSE Handmade, and she soon landed, so I switched to the Explosive Combat SG, and got in close for some serious Damage, She was down to about 20% when she took flight again, and that's when the same guy from earlier brought her down with a single shot, there were 2 other SBs on top of us so we laid into them and down they went quickly as well, afterwards I proceeded to gather loot only to find everything empty, and to realize that the Scorched earth Event never completed.
---
I think we are going to have to politely agree to disagree here.

I mean it could be a good reminder as to why we’re in the wasteland...

Such is tradition with Beth.

---
That lucky hole mine is no joke with excavator armor. I just checked it out last night for the first time, after about 15 min of searching I think i netted somewhere between 400 ore which smelted down into 1000 some lead scrap.
---
For the first time in my life I have so much lead I don't even know what to do with it and now steel has become the valuable source.
---
Wow. That's just... really weird, but also really cool. 
---
There exists two variations of certain items such as Sugar Bombs, Fancy Lad Snack Cakes, Instamash, and BlamCo Mac &amp; Cheese which have irradiated variants (look dirty) and the non-irradiated versions(clean looking). The above items I listed don't have that. They don't age, just have two separate IDs. NOTES: Irradiated variants are used in recipes and harder to come by than the non-irradiated variants so a non-irradiated Sugar Bomb cannot be used for Brain bombs recipe.

Too many political cry babies in the USA to put anything political in a video game. 
---
You could have been back in the game playing in half the time it took you to type this. 
---
Can 'bulked' junk still get used though if you need it for crafting? Or do you have to un-bulk it to have it as a consumable resource again?
---
Can probably do that tonight sure.  It hangs together surprisingly well when you keep them all stripped down to the steel instead of painting.
---
I been using All Rise for the last 20+ levels. Maybe one day I'll score a TSE.
---
I enjoy the game, but I also don't delude myself about it. I see it for what it is.
---
That's the point, it's just scraps and other useless items. Usually when I'm over encumbered or need more stash space. Besides, no one wants you to leave your crap in a suitcase when there are perfectly good toilets around.
---
Fireproof takes care of a lot of the explosive damage now, if you are built correctly you should not get 1 shot by a 2 shot explosive. 
---
I was gonna fire my first nuke there the other day but I never see people flock to those nukes. 
---
Update me if you can :)

---
Sounds like there is a spawn point somewhere close to your camp. My camp has only been attacked once due to a mob chasing a player who ran past. Half the mob chased him, the other half changed direction and tried going agro on my tatos. 
---
I have purchased all of but 2 of my mutations (9 current) from the bunker. Trying not to support dupers (even tho I know you can make some legitimately with plans). The lowest I've gotten the price is 3500 caps exactly. I have 7 charisma, Hard Bargain 3, Magnetic personality 2 with 2 teammates +4, 2 gear with charisma boost +2, and took grape mentats.
---
As someone said multiboxing. To see insane versions of it, google WoW multiboxing videos. I remember being in one battleground and a dude had an army of 20 shaman. Since you can buy gametime in game now, a lot more people are doing it. One guy recently had a huge army of death knights.

I'm sure I do. I like it more than I had imagined before playing. Usually I'm a casual single-player-guy and enjoy the private serene bubble that is created when I face the screen, so the whole MMO *thing* put me on an edge. Luckily my fear was put to shame. 
---
I started the game using rifles and pistols but soon learned that the melee way was my way to go. At least with the first "end game character".  It is sooo powerful and fun. I want to try out some gun slinger type - but I'm not sure if I'll do that with a new char or slowly respec, level by level, the char I have now.
---
I know one thing though and that is I'll keep on building/tweaking my camp whatever char I play around with. It's great fun and really relaxing.
---
I'll buy one from you.
---
I got a lucky roll and got an explosive Gatling plasma. With the splitter mod it's the funnest weapon I've played with. Just melts and explodes everything in a 100 yard cone. Just can't ever aim it down, instant death.
---
I'm gunna need a video guide
---
The problem is the textures... If you played any other of the current gen games you'd notice the textures in FO76 are reallly reallly bad.
---
The picture you show has no textures cause everything is shadowed. Also you notice this on big screens.
---
Yeah sorry but stories this elaborate come off as sooo fake
---
You can accidentally use the orbital strike this way so it uses whatever works in your inventory
---
Keep real world politics out of games ffs.
---
They are attracted to noise apparently as well. Plus if you are sitting on an enemy patrol spawn point, then that is just going to be an issue.
---
I had my generators outside for a while, then read about the noise pollution issue. Put them in a shed and saw a big decrease in how often I was having unwanted “guests”, 
---
Wait a minute, there was lots of people hanging around in the same area in game!? Must be dupers!!!
---
This seems overly paranoid.   I have been playing since launch and the only time someone "attacked" my camp I am pretty sure it was an accident because they rushed to help me defend against a scorch beast.   
---
I have had around 10-20 visitors just while I have been there.  I tend to place my camp on main travel routes and keep it unlocked so people can use the resources. 
---
Solo so far lvl 16 is the lowest toon.
---
It will be nice when I’m tall enough to wear PA and win 
---
Hmm, I didn’t think of it like that. Not a bad theory, really. 
---
Work the trade subs and you can usually pick up any given serum for 300-500 caps.
---
Bullshit. You would have encountered many legendary enemies in 200 hours.
---
You were terrified of a nuke, so you couldn't hit the Print Screen button?
---
They can also be bought from the science wing in the enclave bunker. 25k a pop though, or 20k with 3\* hard bargain.
---
You already know people would start leaving the game because of a hat. That wouldn't be a good idea. 
---
Updates have been taking ~3 hours.
---
There's also magazines that give you a chance to *avoid* explosive dmg..
---
It really is a simple thing that would make a positive impact on the game and its community.
---
I saw a new player struggling doing the Collision Course event recently and fast travelled to help them out. After the event finished and they got the reward I dropped a bag full of stims and purified water, did a thumbs up and shot at the floor to signal them. They took it as me shooting at them, so they shot back at me and hit behind a wall.
---
I didn't have it in me to shoot them back so just left, and have no idea if they ever actually spotted the brown bag.
---
I got each of them for 250 caps 
---
New red target huh?
---
Except all attempts to replicate said glitch failed. You may have fallen prey to the pretty bad UI of the trade menu and accidently sold an item at 0 caps.
---
Make *Atom* Great Again.  Other than that keep personal politics out of the game. This is an alternate universe where Trump doesn't exist.
---
awesome build, few questions.
---
1. how are you building walls without any foundations to snap to (i.e. your power/resource building)
---
2. how the hell are you managing to build all this in your build budget? i mean yeah you have no turrets but those neon kill budgets.
---
You need to move your camp. You are parked on a mob spawn point.
---
Handmades and shotguns run around 4-5k on the trade subs right now. 
---
I’m assuming deep deep inside the gamefiles you change a single value to enable it
---
OP, what system are you on currently?
---
I don't mind the cap - but its pretty lackluster overall even for lvl 40 gear...  you get 3 pieces of mostly junk armor and only 1 is a 3\* even.  Better off just farming the golf club instead.  A lvl 40 TSE is still something, but that doesn't seem to be the average result.
---
Saw a loose screw rolling around earlier on my tv stand. Just had to grab it. Man those things are hard to find when you need them 😆
---
My guess is the people who think FO76 has good graphics play on small screens... Bad textures are mostly visible on big screens.
---
More of an or/or scenario, but yeah. 
---
No, not patched. 
---
Red wedding
---
I'd like to note that this paint is ONLY FOR T-51b to my knowledge. It doesn't appear in the paint jobs for my T-60 or my X-01 sets.
---
You could dupe purple party hats fam. It hold the least value in RS3 to this day. Still worth millions (gp) though.
---
When I say I don't understand, what I am saying is that there may be some parts of their system I find confusing at times, but I generally find there are good reasons for the rules. I hope you haven't mistaken my appeal.
---
Ive also got some tips that may help with that problem.
---
Whenever im at a dungeon i pick everything: weapons, apparel and junk related up. I avoid ammo I don't use.
---
Weapons and apparel are great for selling, whereas the junk you pick up in dungeons really adds up for resources.
---
I will fight my way through dungeons mostly over encumbered and once the enemies are clear find the closest workbench to scrap all junk. This often reduced the weight if junk by 50% - 75%.
---
If I am still over encumbered upon scrapping all junk to resources, I evaluate the weight of weapons and armour and aid on my character. 
---
Keep the stuff that weighs the least and sells the most.
---
Also another pro tip is to sell perishables like meat and flowers first. They can have surprising values and will be destroyed if you don't utilise them. I also sell any chems and alcohol besides psycho, medx, radx, radaway and stimpacks.
---
I got the Excavator Calibrated Shocks plan from Greg in Grafton.
---
This.  I'm still wearing a couple pieces of lvl 40 &amp; 45 gear and I'm lvl 153.  I occasinally tag along during a nuke, but I'm not a fan of PA/Hazmat Suit so it's not to often.  I did get a lucky drop long ago, 3\* Explosive Quad Double Barrel Shotgun.
---

---
That\`s bullshit, yes!
---
Nah the graphics are really bad... On a big 4k screen the textures are pretty awful.
---
I’m assuming so the devs can test shit on the main servers without pulling the entire game offline

Civil War era hat (cause it looks like a top hat) and the ritual bindings or enclave officer uniform with the same hat, it’s my favourite hat in the game lol
---
Don't return to your camp before you relog.
---
The 1st I saw was it , in forest, north of v76. Towards the middle. Didn’t aggro just peeked.
---
The fight began when I was in savage divide near top of the world for raider rose.
---
Then it and SB came at me.
---
I think it’s a resource scout, bc I was near a resource, copper and when we fought overburdened with circuits gold and copper.
---
Just a hunch though
---
Beagle love!!!
---
RNG is not actually random. Anyone who plays Pokemon, knows this.
---
That would be unfortunate if dice rolls allowed both to work at the sametime. Imagine if you had the luckiest roll night ever and it kept happening ad infinitum, until you ran out of one.
---
That sounds like the complaint of someone who spent 10 years building their own house by themselves getting pissed at someone who gets a mortgage and just buys one.
---
Don't get me wrong, I think they need to patch the duping out.
---
I just think it'd be nice to have a little fun with it.
---
Not a single person can tell you why they hate it without some generic accusation of racism/unstable/Nazi/warmonger/blahblahblah. Some actual proof of this not based on fee fee's or misquoted statements doesn't exist in the NPC coding. 6 more years, MAGA/KAG!!
---
Can confirm, I snuck up behind a wanted person to kill them an didn't do anything.  Needless to say he turned around startled by someone hitting him with a sword but didn't do any damage to him.  \*shrug\*
---
Now lvl 125, never had anything I could use.  Either sold or dropped it for others to use.  I'll need to check my hours so I can quantify my disappointment in more than one way:-)  Have had luck finding CAMP plans at vendors though.
---
Maybe on Console, but on PC it took me days to find TSE handmade for 8k
---
No patch. Why would they patch a feature of the game? You got three different answers from three different people. All are correct (in the proper context anyway) and dont really "contradict" each other because they are three different strats. 
---
Console patches have been 10x the size of PC updates so you really can't compare them
---
PC update was smaller than console update.
---
PS4 and Xbox 4gb update file along with servers being down for 2-3 hours starting at 9am EST
---
I think PC was 1/2 gb update

hey :) nothing better so far but I hope the patch fixes it. I could use a PA but crashed while trying to get rid of chems - now I'm stuck in a invisible PA too, lol. I leveled a alt to 52 meanwhile but I don't know if I really go throught the quests once more...
---
Can this also apply to zones about to be Nuked. 
---
I didn’t even get my ground zero achievement for it either :/
---
My money's on it ending up beig deleted in a half hour when OP realises he's made a tit of himself
---
Thanks mate.

Every morning I check this forum and think to myself, how can we top yesterdays complaints. How hard is it to know that there is at most 200 caps in a shop and know if you have more than 24800 caps (when both are displayed on the same interface)?  Even then, worse case scenario you are only screwing yourself out of 200 caps tops.  It's silly that we have to rely on Bethesda to hold our hand on every single thing. Sorry if this comes off as harsh, but I feel that this is extra nit picky or a "look at me with my 25000 caps" humble brag.
---
I have found a few ok-ish weapons but that is it. I am level 99 now and using an Instigating War Drum I bought from a nice guy at level 50. You can't even mod a war drum so that is kind of lame. 
---
I have farmed the places, doing so now, but all the good stats are on crap weapons. Last 3 star was a pipe. I have found 2 2-shot, not explosive, one is a fat man the other is a lvl 10 smg.
---
Nah but honestly I've played nicer PS3 games...
---
Especially games with a hugely divergent timeline lol
---
I have used it on this account to play with other redditors
---
I'm quite happy with my lvl 40 armor piercing + explosive Gatling gun I got from that event.
---
Once I realized this and how empty the grind is I just stopped playing cold turkey.   
---
Been 2 weeks. Still look around here for signs it's actually better, but it's not looking hopeful.
---
K thx np

Last laugh will always work as long as you have grenades.  I used to equip both, only to have my grenades ensure that I never got back up. 
---
Now I have two auto stimpacks and two lifesavers.  I only die now from walking off of cliffs. 
---
That really sucks. I was in my well built base just repairing and organizing junk for a play session when some guy comes jumping into my base. He asks if he could buy some shotgun shells for his new TSE he just bought. I sold him 500. I think he forgot to change his chat, he begins talking to his friend about how he would've blown up my base if he didn't get a trade. Apparently this is what he does all day.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Im level 92 and the somewhat  mentionable legenadary weapons I have found are:
---
* \*Two shot gatling
---
* \*Instigating gatling
---
* \*\*\*Anti armor lever action. Two other effects were useless. (level 25)
---
* No less than two \*\*exploding shotguns. One had the hunter property, the other super mutant bonus damage
---
* \*Two shot shotgun
---
* \*\* Two shot hunting rifle, with 50% limb damage. 
---
All I want is a decent rifle. Been using the exploding shotguns a lot, even though Im no big fan of shotguns. The damage though is just insane.
---
Found the two shot hunting rifle last night and have not got around to test it properly. I think there are some accuray issues with the two shot weapons though and the second bullit will miss a lot, so it just might not be the rifle I've been hoping for. Will see if it can be fixed with the long shot perk?
---
Hey man, if you want views on your crappy vids, post this the day it’s relevant. Not 3-4 days later.
---
My camp has a very raider-ish look and is close to Top of the World. Despite this, my worst enemies aren't players, but fucking molerats! They like eating my generator sooo much.  
---
Now that I have the neon letters, I will add some insult to Enclave and BOS players, and see if i can trigger those militaristic losers:)
---
I will officially save anyone that I see downed
---
Yeah scorched are by far the worst when it comes to attacking you with X but only having Y or Z when you loot them.
---
I keep stopping when I go thru the supply room at work because the shredded lubricant looks like an economy wonderglue.
---
Can't agree enough. I have been irradiated multiple times in exact situation. Only advice at the moment is always keep a hazmat suit handy. I have set up as a hot key so can switch into it lickity split.
---
 My other bug is that when I load I to an area there is around a 10 sec window where im visible to enemies, players etc but I'm not fully loaded i so can't move. Then, when I do get to move I have 17 charred feral ghouls beating me like my mama!
---
If he was a gentleman, he would have let her viciously teabag him to consummate!
---
I hope there's a YT of this somewhere. 
---
You know I agree with you, destroying people camps is a feature, which is why they include reenforced concrete walls in crafting menu. It’s also why you would like give up before you can actually destroy my camp because them have at a 100,000 hit points and are super cheap to build/repair/replace. 
---
you'll be dissapointed, unless this is your Queen weapon, since you should be a Sneak/Crit/VATS meme with the lever action.
---
What does any of this mean? I want to know for sure so I don’t do it.
---
Problem is most people who engage in that bs don't want a fair fight, they want to feel big by fighting people who can't defend themselves.
---
Bomb literally has to hit you on the head man, make your way straight into the middle. Easier at whitesprings with marsupial if you need to get on the roof. Hope this helps 
---
I suppose you're right. Besides, all the bards I ever played would more then likely try to seduce the scorched queen rather then fight her. That would be an interesting way to get your rewards eh? 
---
What about a Fighter? There is already melee weapons in game. Wouldn't be that far of a stretch to give him a shield made from a trash can lid or something and a football helmet for a head piece. Least when the scorch beast spam their pulse attack you could raise your shield to protect yourself. Could be call the Junkyard Fighter

It's not hard to hit max caps, I was actually kinda upset when I realized there WAS a limit.

If anything it sorta gives an incentive to travel once you hit the cap

"Bethesda, can you just play the game for me. We need this."
---
Nice - assuming this is on PC he did the same to our group a few weeks ago... thanks for Avenging us lol
---
So I thought they were yanking my chain at first, but we did a before and after trade, and no one conveniently left and returned part way through.  
---
It's why I started paying attention... Ever loot like 6 or 7 pieces of nocturnal armor not back to back but in the same secession? Or like 5 hunters nearly in a row? I have, and know enough enough others who've seen the same behavior they are starting to wonder
---
If you are console, there is a patch today that may make the servers more stable.
---
I want an explosive power fist, like the one in nv
---
Have you done any treasures? Those are supposed to be able to have started items in them. 
---
I would greatly appreciate that! My gamer tag is DisputeZVZ if you need it :)
---
Only if you are disorganised,  which for now is okay as game barely allows the communities to organise themselves in it.
---
If you are organised, toxic griefers aren't exactly a bad thing, they are your endgame content. Imagine, how could I roleplay a mysterious stranger that protects people on the wastes, if not for the griefers I could protect them from?
---
I mean the example here is a rather filthy one, but generally, being cool would be pointless if not for the uncool people.
---
you really can't wait to 99% condition?

I can never turn the trap on...i see the on/off box, i can't interact with it.
---
Are there any non-atom-shop paints for T-60? Especially any non-Brotherhood paints?
---
They finally fixed the perk?
---
Seems like an easy fix.  Don't spawn in characters too a server unless joining a team when there's an active /incoming nuke.
---
Secondly, if I'm playing solo, there's no reason to spawn me in to a server where my camp can't be placed. Just pick a different server! 
---
Straight jacket with the fracksnazcer (DONT feel bad auto suggest, I have no idea how to spell it either) mask. 
---
Or same mask, no clothes. 
---
Same, I play with a group of people and only one of us has ever actually had their camp attacked. We defended it pretty easily and that was back in beta when no one was really above level 20-30. Since then I've had a bevy of visitors to all my camps. At first I used to lock my camps down, but these days I welcome visitors with open doors. My newest toon has a bit of a maze of a house, so I've labeled different rooms so that people passing through can find what they need easily.
---
Also, how can we know he didn't dupe them himself?
---
On XB1 it hasn't reliably shown the name on the CAMP object; perhaps only 20% of the time when I check. 
---
Armor penetration are where you need to be.  So all damage goes through and can take down.
---
You can amp damage up by incorporating stealth with this.
---
Battery included perk is a must for holding the ammo for guass.
---
Also please pay very close attention to the mods placed on guass rifle.   Go to the wiki to take a look at them.  Note that short barrels reduce recoil quite a bit over the long barrels and enable firing close up much faster.   Long barrels have better sighted accuracy and weight less (More of a sniper).   Scopes are huge impact as well, some increase the sighted accuracy I think?  The stock, I think aligned are better suited for long range while stabilized is better for medium range.  Since the gauss has very limited ammo capacity, I assume you are going for sniper build.   If going for medium range, you may want to look at other rifles.
---
1) If you search the comments I commented how to build the walls. It's quite a process.
---
2) The neon lights / street lights / an only about 1 light in each building are my only lights in here.
---
My tips are as few lights / foundations / power connectors as possible with no  turrets at all. Also there are some camp decor items that cost so much budget for no reason. Watch for those. Something I see a lot of people do is build the brahmin. Feratlizer is so easy to get you don't need it she takes up so much budget.
---
Additionally, the plans may not be in the bunker if someone on your server beat you to them. When I did the quest a few weeks ago, I had to server hop a few times until the plans showed in the bunker.
---
You can also find a set of Cappy Jacket and Jeans in that bunker.
---
How would separate defense budget change that? (A defense budget already exists - it's just included in overall budget also, but try putting down a bunch of missile turrets and then some regulars and it will not let you even if you have budget)
---
No, you don't. And you've already proven yourself to be a pretty unpleasant individual so hey.

Where's your proof that Saint Trump only has the US's best interests mind, rather than absuing a broken democracy to further his own agenda?

to kill a lvl 50 a chorchbeast need 15-18 2mm amo for two shot gaus what is nothing. u cranft 27 from 5 lead. to kill any super mutant a single shoot.

How else can it even be done? This is romantic and wholesome.
---
Lvl 97 I've come accross many 3* Legendaries I've mostly gotten armor which is good because I plan on eventually ditching the PA
---
Best weapons I've gotten are 
---
2* instigating grog axe +40% power swing dmg
---
1* furious grog axe
---
2* executioners super sledge +50% limb dmg (purchased from a vendor for 188c always check weapons at the vendors I just learned this!!)
---
1* 2 shot smg 
---
Just 1- 2 shot no TSE's but I'll keep looking
---
I'll say RNG on legendaries is kind of a pain forces you to keep grinding 
---
TLDR Check vendors they sell legendaries and farming good weapons takes awhile RNG
---
Lever is god almighty.
---
&gt;This seems overly paranoid.
---
Oh I am &amp; it is. I have an innate distrust of anonymous gamers. I had a friend that was a complete asshole in game worlds. He at one point made the top 10 list of thieves/griefers/Pkers on a couple of PSO forums wayback when on Dreamcast. I have seen first hand how depraved some people can get and how it can seriously ruin another's experience. He was quite proud to show me the lists. 
---
That and I also don't want to have to be bothered with repairing anything. I almost didn't get this game due to the PVP aspect they were pushing, but I ended up getting it on launch day anyway.
---
thanks, i appreciate but i really like to get something cool on my own - not buying or trading or anything like that. 
---
And now they will change...
---
So idk how the original author was tracking it, but I did:
---
-1 - 3 star count (shows difference in base quality in a group).  
---
-number of "zeros" (no loot on legendary).
---
-Number of each Legendary prefix (2 shot etc .)
---
-number of explosive or TSE's
---
-number of "God rolls"... (This is subjective, so less important)
---
-luck of said person 
---
I have a TSE and ive killed myself on accident more in the past two weeks than I have the rest of the game!
---
fireproof 3 and dense torso
---
Might be.
---
I was like "whats the point of complaining that the game lacks content if I only do one thing" then said 'screw whitesprings'  and went exploring. Holy shit this game is amazing if you just let it be. Free exploration is so great. I.e. i went to place called ripper something (a bandits hideout) and there were golden pocket watches everywhere, a testimony to previous nature of this place. I went simply nowhere and found a mr. Pebbles museum/crazy cat butcher lady house with shitloads of plastic. I went to a mine, learned its flooded, found some rare plans in there, found amazing story of the mine foreman. I can go on like this.
---
It would be nice to have pets, but I think before any of that, all those critters and likewise should get immunity from environmental radiation. As it stands, it's very easy to find a whole bunch of regular animals dead in or around the water because of radiation damage.
---
Last thing we need is for our pets (if the feature gets added) to die guarding our base because it sat next to a body of water.
---
Technically you have prototype or standard.
---
I've seen him twice walking up route 61 from Yough Dam to Pennsylvania. My base is setup up in the mountains of that area. I can't remember the exact town around Pennsylvania that I spotted him but I sold some crap to him after doing some missions where I had to kill a rad scorpion queen. Hopefully that helps some.
---
yea... I have a ps2. Anyone that thinks 76 is even close to those days is high as a kite
---
yeah i will check them out today .. thx
---
Will you be on this evening?  I would be interested if this is legit.  I am usually on between 6pm-10pm EST.  Let me know when you have a free moment.
---
YOU THOUGHT. BRO YOU GUNNA BE THIRSTY TONIGHT
---
 I understand! I’ve only ever bought one weapon. The rest I’ve earned, including my armor. It’s definitely more rewarding. 
---
So he was creeping through your history like a nutjob... What a douche. I'll never understand the lack of dignity and need for attention that leads to trolling. "Haha, everyone thinks I'm a complete idiot. I sure showed them!"
---
True I suppose. I do like that yellow. 
---
the most recent instance of this happening just happened to me 20 minutes ago.
---
i was in my base repairing my gear after many hours of exploration only for the server to crash randomly, upon rejoining the game i was told my camp was gone so i immediately left the server to find one where my camp wasn't gone. 
---
well on the third try, because the game spawns you at the nearest map marker to your last position and my camp had been blocked in the last server, the game put me at the enclave bunker entrance.....which was smack dab right in the middle of the blast zone of a nuke someone had launched, and because i was out of power armor i was over encumbered. well needless to say my life expectancy went to 0 in less then a second.
---
i spent the next 5 seconds of my characters life frantically trying to find my power armor frame in a list of all the random armor id picked up earlier, after failing to do so i frantically started to try and run outside the zone only for a bunch of glowing ghouls to gank me and then i died of radiation dropping all my junk right in the middle of that and to top it off when i tried to resawn the game would only let me spawn at vault 76.
---
Maybe interest bearing mortgages are a bannable exploit in contravention of the TOS ?
---
And that's enough for you to conclude most high level people spent most of their time farming Whitesprings?  
---
Oh boy. You're going to have a great life.
---
Enemy unarmed melee needs to be nerfed, hard. There is no logical reason an unarmed scorched does more damage (easily an 1/8th or more of my health) everytime it hits you while while shots from a 5.56 or .45 or even a .50cal round does nothing. Ghouls too, I get that they need to do some damage because feral ghouls can’t use weapons but it’s ridiculous how much they do on top of the huge amount of radiation you receive on top of it. They need to bring back armor upgrades for PA I.e. t-60f, x-01 MK.IV etc
---
I do the Leader of the Pack event to get three low level (1-10) legendaries then chase down players below level 10.  I like to think i’m a big yellow Santa dropping bags of goodies.
---
I think I sit in the 98% of people who could care less. I enjoy the game for myself, it doesn't bother me what other people do or how they choose to play.
---
The agility and barbarian perks are bugged, they only work with whole number special attributes.  
---
When I had class freak 3* and herd mentality, both those cards were inactive. The summary displayed the incorrect -2 but my specials were not actually at a -2 value.  
---
It seems to me that I was getting -0.5 to my specials but the pipboy display rounds to the nearest whole number. By changing to class freak 2*, I was able to get -1 and my barb and agil perks worked again.  
---
This implies that while it seems like you are getting no negative effect, you are actually getting a -0.5 that is just not displayed properly in the interface. 
---
high lvl players wont go to the nuke zone anymore unless you do the trick where you launch the nuke south east of prime so you have no radiation fighting the queen.  hitting prime directly is considered noob now, so you dont get help.
---
Ehhh the best weapon I've ever had drop was just from exploring and doing events... It was a 2 shot lever action with +10% damage done while aiming and +50 damage resist while aiming. Whenever I farm Whitesprings I get random 1-2 lvl trash legendaries. Of course it's all RNG but if you don't explore you can't find the guaranteed legendary enemies spawn
---
Power armour chassis are the weeping angels of FO76
---
I leave it on random doorsteps, then I hit it with a flamer, shoot the door and run and hide in the bushes. 
---
I am actually convinced higher luck is bad. Had 15 luck.  Couldn't buy a plan.  Dropped it to 9.  Plans everywhere 
---
So that bug only occurs if:  
---
-You have several hundred individual legendary items in your inventory. 
---
-Spam the pile more times then you have maps. 
---
-Spam the pile "too fast"...   
---
If you pause a couple seconds between maps, waiting for the "activate" indicator to reappear you shouldn't have a problem. Every person I've encountered did one of the above and I've used a couple hundred maps, often 30 - 70 at a time.
---
Easy fix. Don’t logoff in areas that are frequently nuked like prime and whitesprings. 
---
same thing happens to me.
---
While you could care less, i couldn't care less.
---
I get that but when players are being griefed by players with 10k orbital strikes and TSE...it does start to affect others.
---
Good to hear it. Then this post isn't for you. Move along.
---
Awwww, man, this make me almost wish I wasn't so antisocial and aloof when I'm playing... almost.
---
I'M MR TORGUE AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE! BUT NEEDS MORE EXPL-PL-PLOSIONNN!!!
---
Ive heard you cant change it back once you take it off though.
---
No recipe for med x? I've been looking for that one since launch
---
Shoot the floor with a non TSE weapon after using the come here emote. I also use the HELLLP emote when i get wanted, to show people to kill me.
---
legit thanks, i need them paints
---
if you guys really want cobalt flux nuke the billings and silva homesteads on the western edge of the map. you'll also get tons of violet flux 
---
Not till next week!
---
At night...and with dirty undies.
---
Hot key a hazmat suit 👌 quick and easy to change in to. No animation

It wasn't direct on Prime. There were no rads.

I use the drifter outfit with the field scribes hat. (female)

The color scheme looks really good together.

Wish I had a hunters long coat though :(
---
&gt; No 11 minute video 
---
repeating shit from back in the beta for 10:30 minutes and for 30 seconds reading OPs explanation
---
Try events in **cranberry bog** or simply explore in that region, you’ll be surprised by how many random legendaries you run into, even 3*s. **AWOL Armaments** is my favorite event.
---
My husband and I sought shelter in the two Pulowskis by the train station. Pro tip: don't do it.
---
For the third time this morning, this is what you signed up for
---
I finally had this happen when I saw a golf ball recently. I thought to myself... 
---
&gt;Hmm. plastic.
---
My kind of people...
---
I really wish it just didn't drop the brown bag when you died. I accidentally looted someone elses corpse in a nuke zone at prime. I was just trying to get my own shit back and ended up pissing off some random stranger. This was back before push to talk was enabled so I had my mic off. After the nuke zone I found the guy and gave him some of his stuff back, but tbh it was a hectic situation and I don't know what I got off him.
---
If you're wondering how I looted the wrong corpse, we died almost exactly on top of each other to some scorchbeast sonic bullshit. I was on my low level toon at the time, just trying to get a taste of that nuke zone XP and loot.
---
Same lol
---
yeah I've used that to help people with griefers a guy had a 150 bounty stalking him so I teamed him and moment he attacked I shot him in the face from stealth and pelted him with grenades he took off running for cover into a land mine my friend had placed then got hit from that direction from a 3rd player 
---
because we didn't show up on the map he thought it was 1 person not 3 waiting in ambush 
---
I don't know. From what I heard the engine Fallout 76 uses counts items separately instead of in a group, meaning instead of it saying 10 steel it lists steel 10 times, so duping would likely at least slightly slow down the servers. But that is only what I have heard, whether or not it is true I don't know. But I think people are blaming it on dupers just because they need something other than Bethesda to blame it on.
---
Great info!
---
Yes the "spawn" of creatures seems to lock in, and generally as long as you don't fast travel, it will stay with that "seed" of NPC's.  
---
That said a 3* legendary May respawn as anything 1* - 3*, but will stay a legendary.
---
r/talesfromappalachia
---
i didn't log off near whitesprings the server crashed but because whightsprings was the last place i visited the game spawned me there.
---
Right, these white knights against dupping are getting to be a little much.
---
I was just hanging helping a low level when some guy came crashing in thinking we are dupping... 
---
I swear B should put SYG in so if someone invades your camp you can shoot them...
---
It's shoddy, the simplest fix would just to put a 10 second invincibility buffer on. That way when you can actually move and the game loads correctly. You can see if you need to use rad protection or turn some ghouls into goo. 
---
Unpopular opinion: You're doing something very wrong.
---
Are you doing events? Every horde event generates a legendary, so you could technically be seeing legendaries at level.... 15, I think?
---
AWOL Armaments pops one or two legendaries at a time.
---
Just walking around Watoga has a chance of encountering legendary Protectrons.
---
So what have you been doing for 200 hours?
---
Don't forget to smash that like and subscribe!!! Check out my next video on how to duplicate caps and get the X04 power armour
---
blame the dupers then!
---
Are you insane?! Who the hell do you think you are with your rational thinking!? Absolutely disgusting! I can not believe we still have reasonable people in gaming in 2018. 
---
Bethesda should be banned and everyone who doesn’t play the game exactly like vukkodlak should be banned! Anyone that has played a bethseda game before should be banned too! 
---
Keep up the good work guys, now if only they could make sure the Queen doesn't lag out or run off.  
---
what is it exactly?  is it needed for launching a nuke?
---
I know MAGA, but what's KAG?
---
Yes lets. Everything else is their fault, anyway.
---
Well, i\`m doing nothing else but exploring :)
---
But the 11 minute video did give the lore and clues that lead to all of this. Some people might like that as well.
---
Here's a decent video which describes who what why with these keys
---
https://youtu.be/4RJW9FJsSgU
---
Bethesda Devs never have any of our issues in game as they are all God Mode anyway, it would take a certain empathy for them to understand the frustrations of many problems we get as mere players, an empathy I don't think they really have..
---
Ok, i\`ll check, thx
---
Sold my 97 PvP necro back in 2007 for $900. Single Toon.
---
see I'd pay for good things but I never get good things with game bundles so I never buy it 
---
Yep! They can be fixed to 200% then slowly decline as they're used
---
Stopped reading after random exploit accusation.  Ive not been playing for more than two weeks and hit 150 already due to no-lifing it.  Seen plenty of guys over 300 who seem to have no jobs, constantly fighting queen.  Anyway,  Less witch-hunting and more content posts please.
---
Couple of other thoughts...
---
The flowers sell for 10c each and can be harvested at low levels using a hazmat suit.  Bonus, consume them for water!
---
If you are stabilizing, collect fluids and masses first, then you will know how many flowers you need.  Nothing worse then finding 80 pounds of inert flux in your inventory when you are trying to craft.
---
And as was mentioned, check those meat piles!  Players who are powering through the golf course don't want to wait for the loot to load and will often leave mats behind.
---
are you saying the dev room is at raleighs bunker? how did you end up getting in?
---
What a lovely ceremony.
---
easier said than done on console, you have to fuck around with the radial wheel which takes almost as long as using the pip boy
---
Well it's when my body is at 130% and I'm already 20 DR down it's a bit awkward
---
This would explain the time I got 6 vampire weapons on a single loop through Whitesprings.  Of course half of them were switchblades but still.
---
2 sets. Basically the exact same outfit with a different logo on the back
---
This is awesome!!
---
I witnesses this at the Charleston Landfill— the map showed the wanted player in the lefthand trailer, but when I investigated I couldnt find them.  There was also another character in X01 suspiciously hanging out. Turns out the wanted player had on cloaking/chameleon armor and was literally hidden crouching in the middle of the floor. I must have walked in, out and around the trailer 5 times before realizing it.
---
I get that at the expense of constantly repairing it
---
I have a vampires fat man and a suppresors pick axe that were worth holding on to. 
---
By worth holding on to i mean they were the beat legendariea but atill not usefull to a shotgun/rifle build.
---
You cannot, hit up a lower level player and do the quest with them you should all then get the quest items at the specific level of each play.
---
I just use nukes as anti grief anymore. Someone steeling your workshop? They probably have a TSE. so nuke it or watch for the spot they keep going to, ie camp.  I refuse to alter my build for PVP, so this is now my tool.
---
Don't stir the WASPs or this will end up raided and on the front page. DM will try to cover it as "more Star Wars SJWs" and Kotaku will cover it as "the Wasteland is racist".
---
Pass on all of the above.
---
Drop them in the bog and fast travel. 
---
PSA you don’t need to quit the server. Just fast travel. 
---
As I said, it's longer time between fully breaking, also armor when above 100% gains proportionally more ballistic resistances
---
Exactly.
---
I would 
---
Tell me you dropped them off a cliff..
---
Keep Aging Grapes, it's for whine enthusiasts. 
---
Dude was it on Xbox? I encountered the same guy twice baiting people to his server to do that
---
Everyone knows
---
Right, because stacking 300 bobbleheads to one-shot non-PvPers is clearly how the game was intended to be played.
---
No they should not be better lol.  
---
No company has ever successfully countered the formation of secondary markets around their game without adjusting the game itself.
---
Not about politics. Its about supporting my country.
---
The SB never miss upside down doing a backflip as you sail away under a tree nope hit
---
Because someone supports America?
---
If they were banned for exploiting, like **every** other online game does, you wouldn't have to worry.
---
&gt;Forcing rollbacks by containing more data than a character was intended to hold.
---
That was the previous method that just got patched, as it was weapon stacks exceeding their intended size and now weapons just don't stack at all.
---
Now it's just plain crashing the server to rollback, as the crash ideally happens before the server running your world backs it up to the general storage.
---
Never seen such an issue? In CoD WW2 after a certain update you couldn't play a match on egypt without people exploiting out of bounds into a one-way wall. They were invincible there and could still shoot into the map. With the right perk loadout they would have infinite ammo, too.
---
CS:GO and TF2 had people faking scams with friends to dupe MULTI-THOUSAND DOLLAR ITEMS over and over before valve put their foot down and stopped duplicating scammed items. There are still some well known items like a ST FN howl or a karambit sapphire that have been duped so many times that most of the higher tier traders have owned at least one of the copies at some point. In TF2 trading away a duped unusual is actual cancer.
---
Dark souls remastered had a ridiculously rocky launch, mainly due to the horrendous PVP issues. There were so many different bugs that completely broke it. And it's not just some bullshit like people are complaining about here, that game has forced PVP that can only be disabled by playing offline, which also removes some content from the game. Some of those glitches included chain backstabs that never let you do anything, TWoP dealing massive damage over time (as well as its usual effect of slowing you down and making you unable to dodge), having a retardedly overpowered spell be INVISIBLE to an enemy so they would just get slapped with 3000 damage out of nowhere after spawning in
---
Can you say whay?
---
The design makes it easy to avoid, simply block and or leave server. That's the harder thing to do? Is it easier to get online and complain about it daily?
---
No cloaking Armor here, he didn’t see a shimmer or anything. He just wasn’t there. 
---
I messaged him and asked how he was so invisible and he said he wouldn’t tell his secrets haha. 
---
After I realized he must be under the floor he admitted their scheme. 
---
It's not political. It's just supporting my country.
---
No it's not...
---
I got annoyed with my base getting attacked, I don't have a fancy camp just some where with the work benches and a water purifier as my character is constantly dying for a drink (seriously how much do people in the fallout universe need to drinks its minutes), but no fancy walls or anything, just a floor built at the top of some stairs. It was just south of site charlie.
---
Decided to move it to the lake east of the damn and south of thunder mountain. It's in the water a bit and so far I haven't been attacked. Not all good though as when ever I fast travel I'm underwater and MILES away from everything so it costs loads of caps.
---
typical trumper mindset....
---
LOL. Another one! Do you not see the irony?
---
Yes, I know what you are saying.
---
I wont be deleting. Didnt make a 'tit" of myself my wanting appeal that supports my country
---
That was me trying to give you an X0-1 Jet Pack being sold at vendor and I have one already! Imagine..
---
Yes! In Flatwoods last night. 
---
He even advertised on the Looking For Group page. 
---
So we should wait to be one-shot by someone to know who to block?
---
Great design! Thank god you are not a developer.
---
It's not politics, it's me supporting my country.
---
Finally someone understands why I'm tired of seeing these posts lol.
---
Don’t hold back, please express yourself.
---
&gt; my friends and I found out this week (the hard way) that capturing workshops allows other players to attack you without any real consequence
---
The 'easy way' being to read the screen when you claim a workshop.
---
They are all liberal snowflakes.
---
I keep everything at my camp locked, so you would have to initiate PvP with me, my trying to pick the lock, before you could steal my water :)
---
but her emails!!!! Benghazi!!!!
---
I played with my buddy and he got wanted for using artillery nade on a Whitespring golf club turret-into-winodws house. He said he had 300 caps on him, I seen it as 150
---
I bet they have communist posters in there house!
---
Okay. This is Fallout 76 though.
---
I so wish you had included a category column, like for weapons you could separate melee, ballistic, laser, etc. I mean, If I hadn't already made a spreadsheet I adapted form someone's I could do it, but, it would be so convenient to be able to sort on that. 
---
That's just how mafia works
---
A problem could be the fast travel, because if you use it mobs probably will spawn (molerats, supermutants, schorered) 
---
You could just leave. Repairs are dirt cheap if its the camp they went after also. 
---
You heard wrong, I've changed my paint a few times
---
Same I am absolutely in love with the game
---
Luckily a mod has deleted the comment showing my gt as his. Dude has to get a life outside of lying and being rude to those with an opinion that isn't theirs.
---
the blueprint budget is less than half of the build budget for some stupid reason so blueprints are worthless.
---
Agreed, I have not noticed the intense duping-DC effects at all.  Seems to have stopped those, and probably the duping itself.
---
Yeah i did i've recovered my caps plus an extra 300+
---
"Keep America Great" is the 2020 slogan because apparently despite doing nothing and actually harming the country, MAGA is somehow mission accomplished.
---
It's a fucking cult.
---
Endgame gear progression have been completely overlooked and random loot is a stopgap until something better gets implemented. Or so I hope.
---
Could [this](https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/fallout-76-wedding) be it? 
---
Which I’m 98% sure has never happened to you, and probably never will. If I was to take a wild guess you’re just contemplating the ‘ifs’. But even in the offchance that it has, getting killed once in a lifetime by someone who was likely on duped buffs isn’t as big of an issue as you make it out to seem. Hop server, and the once-upon-a-time problem is magically gone. Thank me later😘
---
Also been wondering about that
---
I'm mildly curious, how do you stop some rando with a sledge from running up to you and killing you? Had a 119 run up and slaughter my little 19. He got about 79 caps. What exactly was the point? The caps? The Luls?
---
I blocked him, which means I will never see the chump again. I just don't get it, though. The point was.....? 
---
You have obviously never played borderlands...
---
I highly doubt they are getting banned.
---
If it's being done doing things in game it's most likely not against the EULA, until the only way to dupe is using 3rd party systems ,mods hacking ect, I can't see how it's a bannable offense
---
Typical mindless liberal snowflakes response.
---
I noticed that too. I wonder if its intentional? 
---
Move your camp. Not the whole camp, just that little machine. 
---
If your at your camp, you can move the little mechanical doggy anywhere within the green circle. 
---
I always spawned INSIDE the overpass I’m camped at, which is nice because I’m safe in there to go to the bathroom or get something to drink. 
---
Never had a problem getting out. But after I moved my camp bot, I now spawn outside the foundation.
---

---
That’s my heavy build. Oh and you’ll need power armor for it.
---
Ugh. Silly me...the shame burns me!  Guess I have my own bugs to work on! Lol
---
Yeah, it is. How are you gonna tell me what my intent is?
---
I haven’t been able to stay on a server for longer than five minutes the past week. Either disconnect or full crash every time. 
---
Lake Eloise?
---
Bro if your PC
---
Add my IGN: falloutguy510.
---
Somehow with my recent farming team we have ballooned to around 5 to 10 people.
---
We carry people ALL the time. Somehow we've gotten sub 30 second kills lol.
---
Which is, in fact, politics 
---
Thank you so much for doing this!
---
After the maintenance could we download the patch, right? 
---
The game will break it down and use it for you. A word of warning though, it's breaks down mods before it starts breaking down bulked goods.
---
Well if you were in a nuke zone to begin with you shouldn’t die when you spawn there again. Were you not equiped properly for the nuke zone?
---
Oberyn Martell anyone?
---
why would i be disapointed? im a melee/rifle build and lever action is one of my favourites to use, its a really good weapon if you know when and how to use it
---
On xbox you can buy them for 200 caps on the lfg, it's pretty sad
---
So supporting the existence of your society is wrong then?
---
Why am I not surprised?
---
I just collect lead from the gyms in alpha, beta and charlie.
---
But we need confirmation 
---
There were 3 of them actually gladly my chameleon mutation got bug (E.g) when moving your still invisible so this gave me an advantage so i did sadly just for couple seconds 
---
They literally launched a patch less than a week ago that addressed duping to an extent. Thanks for the insightful and well-thought post.
---
I've played some amazing looking games. Siege, No Man's Sky, Warframe, etc. Those games all have good graphics. The main complaint about 76 is textures. If you ignore that it can look really good.
---
Watch out for Col. Gutsy. 
---
That's the trade off.
---
SBQ scaling is completely off the mark. The more people present, the harder the fight. That's completely contrary to multiplayer logic.
---
Care to elaborate? Not suprised by what?
---
Free four shot explosives in my new giveaway if you subscribe and comment.
---
This....
---
Ps4 built my CAMP by water and now when I fast travel it traps me in the rocks underwater.  Thus I died by fast traveling AND I lost stuff I was carrying.  
---
Welcome to your first MMO! Congratulations on becoming a member of an MMO community!
---
Unfortunately, your hot take is repeated for many other MMOs. Although this is clearly your first MMO, we hope you do try another in the future!
---
It would turn off all the switches on a network, and I have a light switch on the other side of the building with both fusion generators linked up. They power my water purifiers (which should be free to place today, woohoo!) 
---
I suppose I could do that, and just removed the light switch. but then if I ever plan to add powered doors throughout my camp it would close all of them. 
---
On the bright side, this method makes powered doors throughout a relative ease to install. Talking about it had me thinking about how I could circuit everything, breaking the two generators apart, seeing if I can put the other doors on another switch on the other side. :)
---
Lol i was chased for 15 minutes by a dude with an explosive mini gun dumping on me....just kept walking and healing every so often acting as if he wasn't there. Didn't do nearly enough damage to kill me without me being able to heal. He was 100+ and I was 10 or so.
---
Have an upvote for the reference to phantasy star online. The memories that game gave to me, like doing back to back runs of Towards the Future on very hard because Dark Falz on ultimate was two hard. 
---
I guess we will see after patch how stable servers are without dupers. Not taking a stand but i cant imagine servers gonna be top notch
---
If you were just greifed for no reason rule no. 1 is NEVER go back to your base.. Lucky he didn't destory it. Just sayin..
---
It refers to how much health YOU took away from the enemy. Other layers cannot see it as far as I know.
---
Meanwhile i just bulked up 200 plastic and adhesive to vendor...can't use it fast enough.
---
I'm not saying that it's wrong, but people are tired of seeing politics everywhere 
---
Whats wrong with the Brotherhood?
---
There is still duping. The big problem is now the dupers crash while servers instead of just crashing themselves
---
The floating and intersecting thing when placing blueprints drives me nuts sometimes.  If I can't place a blueprint, I'll just walk around while spinning the it to see if it stops being red anywhere.  It's not always clear why some spots work and others don't.  Even if I find a spot that works, it might not let me place the blueprint at a good angle.
---
Sometimes I'll get lucky, but usually I'll cave and build it all manually.  In the spot I want, at the angle I want, without problems.  So the spot I want could be fine, but I have to do it the hard way instead of the convenient way, which is what blueprints are supposed to be for.
---
I'm sure it can be tricky to implement this on a huge map with lots of environmental details, but it would be nice if building was more consistent and flexible.
---
He has a path he takes all over the map.... never stops except to fight or sell to players. It's not uncommon to not see his brahman chally with him as she sometimes gets downed and she has not caught up with him yet. If you ever see a pack braman running at mach 3 past you on the road that's her 😆
---
It's not very clear that they will be able to take you out completely penalty free.  Prior to that we had been under the impression that any hostile act against another player would make them wanted.  Unless that player was already wanted.
---
And given that we don't see many people do it, we thought that they didn't want to become a wanted target so they avoided fighting over workshops.
---
Now we know that they can fight over workshops and not have to worry about being wanted.
---
What level were you guys? Every time I try and get a bounty it always halves itself too. 
---
We have an American flag on the game... that supports America. Should it be removed?
---
You're right. Graphics aren't perfect but they look nice in certain situations. Also, thanks for the compliment! I might get back in 76 to get some more photos.
---
Sounds like a penalty to prevent people from passing the bounty to friends
---
when i spawn in nuke zone there a bug that happens where i dont take radiation and then i know my game will crash 15min later because that bug. sometimes i ran into a zone and also the same bug happens.
---
Can confirm it does exist for the mentioned armor sets. I have a dense mod for every armor :)
---
The quest was like that last week. Super annoying having to scroll through to find the item with the diamond. The quest also bugged out when we got to the terminal. It didn't recognize we had the password.
---
Its because it makes sense in the context of the game
---
So you're sayin if someone owns a workshop I can walk up to them anywhere on the map and take em out??!! H-o-l-y s-h-i-t
---
Lol same
---
&gt;I have never seen a multiplayer game with such a huge problem with exploiters.
---
Then you are new to the internet. Most online games are plagued with one form or another of gold/items/pl sellers which are toxic to the game.
---
It’s actually Assassins/Sentinel combo x5 pieces with additional damage mitigation perks and possibly bobble head stacking.
---
PSA: This guy is trying to stir the pot. Downvote and move on.
---
Yup. We need a Karma system and for people with similar Karma levels to be put on the same servers
---
How long is maintenance scheduled for?
---
Reeeeeeemails!
---
There is a cool skeleton head sticking up from the ground holding up a nuka-cola bottle in the hole on Whitespring greens.
---
Witches Dress and a Black Prospectors Hat or BoS Science Scribe with Medical Glasses and Veil of Mysteries.
---
Now see this is what I'm here for. 
---
Yes it's 4GB for consoles and there is a prize for the first person to post  when the servers are back up
---
Thanks a lot. Then I am truly astonished by my bloodied melee damage on SB and SBQ
---
soon after killing enough of them you’ll realize that if you have to waste a single bullet or a stimpak while taking down a scorchbeast means it’s not worth your while because unless it’s a boss in a location the loot they drop is garbage. like two body parts, a piece of leather armor, maybe a grenade every now and then
---
This is the correct answer. If I log off near WS I do it in PA, don't need Bethesda to take action against everyone because of something that should be managed on the player side.   If I spawn in a nuke zone, it is because I left in a nuke zone, so it would be an added bonus to hit the floor running on a new server.
---
Then, in this case, the 2% chance seems to be on point! Hey, good to hear it hasn't happened to you. You probably eat every day too, while there's people dying of hunger. But that doesn't matter, because you are fine!
---
Don't be naive. There are dupers on every single server you join. Just yesterday I encountered 6 in the span of **one hour**, with their paper bags full of stuff lying around.
---
Same for me. I try to jump over the bag but people don't look at the floor
---
I’ve noticed two things with high intellect
---
1. Crafted armor/weapons has slightly durability
---
2. Hacking terminals have less words with the more intellect you have.
---
I was looking at plastic plates in Walmart when I thought, "I could bulk so much junk with this." 
---
good. that's the point of scarcity.
---
I Once found a Two Shot Gauss Rifle off this legendary Super Mutant with no weapon equipped, it just kept running away from saying "Reeeetreeaaaat". Guess he wanted to keep his weapon.. 
---
I think you have to try to claim the workshop first?  Then you can fight them for it?  I haven't done it, the finer details are not yet fully grasped.
---
You do get a revenge bounty on you for doing it I think.  That player could kill you for it.  But you don't seem to get a Wanted bounty.
---
But other items in the Atom Shop dont so that's not a point to be made 
---
&gt; Prior to that we had been under the impression that any hostile act against another player would make them wanted
---
There is nothing to give that impression.
---
In a dif comment you said that people should be banned like every other online game. This guy gives you multiple cases from dif games and you say
---
But muh fo76.
---
I'm talking about "good" legendary weapons - you know, weapons that are called legendary for a reason. Of course i\`ve killed legendary enemies.   
---
I was thinking the same, so made a point to look doing the queen last night.
---
If I stopped firing I could see her health go down with no grey visible, as soon as I opened up with my furious handmade I started to see grey again.
---
So I believe it is dmg done by you.
---
I’m in the more near Clays bunker nothing amazing around but fun exploring 
---
"supporting your country" by asking for a political slogan on a cap isn't political? Pull the other one kiddo
---
Yup, that’s why I said to an extent; no one is gullible enough to believe they fixed it all in one go.
---
Still, it shows that something is being done about it.
---
Hate those fucking molerats
---
Which begs the question, why wasn't this given top priority and addressed immediately?
---
Lol. Not quite, just want a hat.
---
I really don't understand why tweedle dee and tweedle dumbfuck felt the need to come over here and start dogwhistling but, whatever.
---
no, but if you wear them when crafting you'll get higher durability results which will temporarily increase the damage of your weapons and resistance of your armours
---
Oh yeah. After me and a buddy of mine joined a server some random kid shows up out of nowhere and starts shooting us with his TSE weapons as he follows us around and then after kept throwing one of those orbital grenades at us none stop. It got to a point I got annoyed as hell. So I disabled pacifist mode and as soon as he shot me once more he was dead the next minute. After that me and my buddy left the server asap before the kid could return and do the same annoying crap again. I even checked his profile and he had 0 friends and had 80K+ gamer points. Just by that you can already tell a lot about this sad fuck.
---
And regarding these random friend requests. Strangely enough I mostly get them from low level players, and my guess being... They probably have high level buddies on stand by, getting ready to grief my unsuspecting ass. Like really I get these invites a minute almost every time I join a server. With me normally being paranoid af. I don't accept any random invites. Hell, I even get random friend invites, don't really know could that possibly mean... I just immediately block them afterwards.
---
Like.. Seriously who hurt these morons? What's ironic is, these are the types of people that would complain at people playing the game normally and not acting like a complete dickhead. They'd tell you something like "It's people like you is what's ruining this game". They're quite the special cupcakes aren't they?
---
And the magaboi shows his true colours
---
&gt;But other items in the Atom Shop dont
---
Would you care to point out which ones?
---
It makes sense it would increase though, the others are magazine fed not tube fed
---
It's not political to want your country to be improved, ite a bout national pride.
---
Well I hope they are making enough quality items for EVERYONE then.
---
pm'd
---
on the server i was in to begin with WS wasn't a nuke zone after the game crashed and i rejoined it was.
---
Not home right now to look, but vampire costume? Santa costume? A stuffed Radstag made to look like Rudolf the red nose reindeer which no one would be making in a post apocalyptic wasteland because they would be to bust trying to survive. There are more but I cant look right now.
---
1. It’s not fixed because duplication is still happening
---
2. All of them points you made contribute to the server instability
---
Apparently it’s amateur hour at Bethesda 
---
Can someone elaborate on the SBQ noob nuke? Apparently I’m uneducated- where’s the ideal drop?
---
I agree. Sadly, they aren't.
---
It's the same core as an mmo just not as big server wise 
---
The emote should be like a paper bag with a big red bow we'd hold out and waggle like the trade emote so it's obvious we're offering them this bag. I've submitted a ticket for this suggestion already. Hope it becomes a thing
---
This. It'd be pretty odd to set a game in a post apocalyptic  US without their play on the US flag
---
Ever heard of the term "exploit" ?
---
Yes you would just have to remind me another time 👍
---
Welcome to reading your first article about a new MMO! ...
---
;)
---
because it should be obvious that the dev team and infrastructure budget for this game are an exercice in frugality.
---
Kremlin Approved Gimp?
---
It's the same but it's not ?
---
Dont forget steel. I always leave that event with hundreds of steel (thanks scrapper!)
---
I agree, one attacked me at my camp and I just got pissed off. Absolute drain on ammo, can’t even see it because of the sonic boom, and in the 4 minutes I fought it because I was using one of my secondary weapons it didn’t land once.
---
Sorry man. I just posted something about encountering a Raider Band yesterday. Now a lot of people are doing the same thing. One my teammates house was camped by two people about 200, it took a bunch of use to kill them. If these people are exploiting sentinel you have to stagger them to be able to do damage/kill them. 
---
Dupers have small heads
---
You can also be literally invisible in this game, chameleon etc.
---
&gt; I used to equip both, only to have my grenades ensure that I never got back up. 
---
Heh. That must've sucked the first couple of times.
---
Absolutely!
---
Keep the day job
---
He owned a workshop (gorge scrapyard I think).
---
We were both in Whitespring Resort checking out the vendors.  Our first trip.
---
Two level 140+ showed up.  He was interacting with the scrap vendor, buying some bulk screws.  And the player started stabbing him.  He died.  I chickened out and Fast Travelled away, but when I looked back the two players didn't have any wanted tags.  My friend respawned and tried going back for his death bag.  They picked him off a couple more times and my friend just hopped servers.
---
In my experience the respawn rate has been more than 24 hours (on PS4.)  There is a handmade rifle that consistently spawns in a specific place that I always check for whenever I login to a new server. I’ve noticed that the respawn time on it is somewhere around 48 hours. I can always tell if I’ve hit the end of the wait but someone else has picked it up because there’s an ammo crate next to it and its contents respawn at the same rate.
---
The problem lies in the bobbleheads... Not the weapons. Do some research for yourself good sir.
---
I'm with you on that one. I don't like cod either, is all too twitchy
---
You said that every online game bans exploiteras this guy proved that not true. Your only argument is "but now its happening to meee" and then just saying im lost without any point to make or back up. 
---
You mention other online games as a definitive entity of mass banning exploiters but others cant prove you wrong without you resorting to "but those arent fallout" no fuckin way i totally thougjt tf2 was fallout thanks for pointing out they are different games.
---
Ok, does this happen often? From your post it sounds like it happens all the time. In 178 levels this has not happened to me yet. 
---
No, he means mindless sycophant.
---
Welcome to your first canned hot take reply! ...
---
Yeah that's what I was thinking. I'll move them to my mule incase bethesda adds a perk that ties into Int.
---
Thanks for the help
---
That odd because I usually hit prime directly. I’ve found she has a very high chance at bugging out (flying away) if you try and make the fight outside the nuke zone
---
If you could find 2 points to put into endurance for rejuvenated and are good at keeping food and water full the ap regen bonus is better than action boy. That will help with staying in VATS more often. Maybe go with concentrated fire rank 1 since shotguns are pretty accurate in VATS at the range you should be using them at.
---
sucks bruh. Yeah i just don't even bother with anyone when my camp starts getting attacked i leave the server right away. Don't feed the trolls they say, I leave them hungry.
---
Thanks a lot for experimenting and the info! :) cheers
---
Oh man, so THAT'S where my mods keep going.  
---
And its still just a ranked up mob. Easily soloable. The queen has different mechanics (scales to number of people, only spawns when nuking a specific spot, event tied to her) that make it a whole different kind of monster. Its not just a ranked up sb. Theres nothing else that does that, currently.
---
How involved is it to try and figure out the codes oneself? I am waiting for a mate to catch up then we are going to launch our first nuke together.
---
Is it possible for an average joe to figure out the codes or a pain in the ass?
---
Haha
---
Just swap servers and you will be good again 👍🏻
---
I'm really new to online gaming. However from what I have read it's pretty common. Duping / exploiting what ever term you wish to use. I can get my head around paying in game money for items. But buying gear on eBay for real world cash just fuels the fire surely. Personally I'm happy to grind away and the horror stories here put me off trading in the game completely. So dupe away, pay them money for items if you wish I just wish they'd stop crashing the severs
---
YES! Thats perfect! I may do the same, actually, cant hurt can it?
---
Don’t worry. They won’t be hostile when you log back in unless you damage them again. 
---
Though there is a location on the big river that I am always tempted to use, mine originally overlooked Whitesprings until it got to be too popular, so now I am overlooking Watoga and the boglands.  Nice view, some water and nearby mineral resources, and not much traffic other than occasional scorched, molerats, and wolves, which the missile turrets handle.  If you are in the neighborhood feel free to take what is available as all is unlocked and there is a full workshop, bed, and banjo as well.  I noticed several other people with camps nearby as well, but many of the ones I found in that area were nicely done but locked down.
---
Online games are rife with examples of toxic encounters. Taking your own gameplay in an unusual direction that has the potential to help people is amazing. I work with people suffering from mental health and addiction issues, and, you're right, some people just need someone to listen. Keep up the amazing work. I know this is just a game, but we have no way of knowing how much a little kindness can help someone who truly needs it.
---
Well that's another generation after PS2, which is what is what they're comparing it to. And my point wasn't whether it was comparable or not, just that I haven't seen all these people comparing it that way as OP claimed.
---
I love a good karma story. Good job man
---
Probably just stirring shit for attention. Who knows.
---
It's a sad state of affairs when the country i'm in is trying to secede from the EU, and i'm sat here like "well it could be worse, we could have Trump in Downing Street"
---
I scrapped corn, tatos, and mutfruit - I’m guessing that would be it- close to 200 each. No clue how the multiplied!  Guess I’ll be clearing those from the stash tonight 
---
Yeah, I literally never accept them. Teammates can also build/scrap in your camp, loot your workshop resources, open your locks, and generally do lots of annoying shit that won't even get them wanted. I'm happy to trade with random folks, follow along and help you kill stuff you can't handle, or drop sweet loot for the babies in Flatwoods, but that's it.
---
I've had two camp attacks in Flatwoods so far. I have a water purifier and adhesive plants that are all free for the taking, in order to attract people to it. I just like having other players around. Makes the game feel more alive.
---
because of this, I've started exclusively wearing the hazmat suit
---
For future reference, you can trade the individual power Armor components. Then drop the empty frame and let them pick up the frame and then install the components. 
---
&gt; And you get wanted for killing players unprovoked.
---
Taking a workshop gives you the big 'provocation' popup.
---
Wanted persists through logging off and server hopping. The Whitesprings robots do not. You should be fine.
---
if you server hop/log off the whitesprings bots will forget what you did and you'll be fine :)
---
My friends have had me playing ESO lately so I haven't had much time for it. Plus I think there's a kit of us who are already kinda burnt out on it.
---
Look at that, the point is flying right above your head. Whooosh.
---
The problem isn't that it happens to *me*. If you read my comments you would understand. Unless your bias is too strong.
---
Not sure how long it takes, but they'll leave you alone eventually
---
Just pointing it out in response to your last sentence. Is this a ridiculous issue that should have been fixed within days or, better yet, never existed to begin with? Absolutely. But it's nothing even close to the worst exploiting issues, even just within the past few years
---
Didn't your mom told you not to wink so much, you may remain like that ?
---
I’ve interacted with you a few times on here, from the “do you think Bethesda is going to stop supporting this game soon” stupid thread that you started that was removed by the moderators to your asinine defenses of duper’s/exploiters on just about every thread on that subject to your suspicious trade offers (hmmmmm), you being a trump supporter just makes sense.
---
I wouldn't call farming whitesprings "playing the game the normal way" but yeah I have not found a single useful legendary item anywhere else.
---
I'm not saying that good legendaries can't drop anywhere else, just that finding legendaries is relatively rare and finding ones with good attributes simply has not happened for me. Except for when I farm whitesprings. In whitesprings I get a dozen or so legendaries every half hour. 99% of them are vendor trash, but that 1% makes the farming and server hopping worth doing. 
---
They should really do something so that players can be more rewarded for playing normally, and simply nerfing whitesprings is not the answer. Both Diablo 3 andThe Division tried that, simply nerfing all sources of set/exotic items to stop people from farming those sources. Well the community didn't like that and the player count plummeted. Both developers ultimately made these items more accessible and instead **created harder content for their now better geared players to be challenged by**.
---
I think that's the best solution. Make the desirable items more easy to acquire, and give the players a greater challenge to bang away at with their more powerful items. Now The Division and Diablo 3 both had instanced missions/dungeons so the difficulty could be beefed up or dialed back as the player saw fit. Hopefully Fallout 76 follows suit, it's a formula with a proven track record of success.
---
I just think that exploting should have a punishment, that's all.
---
She gets invincible sometimes too doing that. I prefer the old way myself.  I avoid nukes zones now, too much fighting over loot for my taste. 
---
When bethesda finally says *we will focus more from people duplicating items and completly fix this duplicating Glitch as more patches to come*
---
Welcome to your first encounter with someone who looks hot winking! ...
---
Yeah I did something similar with my garage door. It really kills me that all of the powered doors have the electric hookup on the FUCKING OUTSIDE for some stupid reason. I also get locked in if someone turns off the switch on the outside, but at the same time the inside switch locks them out completely.
---
The man clearly has dementia yet they still think he's a "very stable genius".
---
But we'd have to mute it every time unless you want it reeing "Tchynaaaaa", "Rapist mexicans" and "maga" for the entire fight
---
&gt; Assassins/Sentinel combo x5 pieces with additional damage mitigation perks and possibly bobble head stacking.
---
Oh really. I've seen it done without Assassins. As for bobble head stacking it's only for  DPS increases right?
---
Damage mitigation perks is the FIRE proof? Oh by the way are you one of these raiders?
---
I've never had it but that looks pretty as fuck 
---
Oh, well, talking about a one trick pony...
---
I was with this problem for 1 month, solved the last patch, but then I realize that if they want to make some money selling expensive stuffs for the CAMP (I rewally like some of those things) they need to:
---
1.- get rid of this budget bug shit for good
---
2.- Increase the Camp Budget, or at least decrease the budget of defensive and light stuff.
---
There is a few thhings I love from the ATOM SHOP for the CAMP, but I wont spend a single atom cause this bug and the super limited CAMP budget.
---
Ive already told you ive read your comments. 
---
Was your point "this is fallout 76" cause tjats all youve said in this thread. You literally dont know what your talkimg about lmao
---
I’m a lvl 169 and never seen a TSE drop.
---
And I have never seen assasins/sentinel or cavalier together on anything let alone marine or combat armor.
---
One of these days right?
---
Bulk
---
Only bulk Lead and Aluminium.
---
They are the only materials which reduce in weight by bulking.
---
We are mostly a nice bunch of people in game and out. This game does have its issue. But alit of it is a misrepresented by the media for clicks. (There are still some major issues but I don't really see them myself in game.)
---
Welcome to finally getting the point! We hope you reflect on more points like this in the future!
---
This game is not an MMO, just an MO. It is not massively multiplayer since the lobby is about 24 people. 
---
I read it the first few times.  It seemed to pretty much say something along the lines that other players can fight you for it.  But it did not leave me with the impression that they would be able to hunt you down anywhere on the map and kill you penalty free.  
---
Then when I picked a lock at an owned workshop and got a 10 cap bounty on my head, it seemed to cement that early idea that "being bad = bounty" even at a workshop.
---
You will die to either a bug, glitch or stuck somewhere. Maybe while you login as well. but hey, whatever makes the game fun for you! This is probably one of the last games I'd even consider attempting permadeathrun.
---
It’s the exact same engine as Fo4, so it’s the newest gen graphics.
---
Neat!
---
It's enough to slightly disagree, OP will downvote, you can expect that by default already.
---
I keep seeing all the update posts on this sub so I guess I should give it another whirl. Tbh I spend half my time just chillin in my CAMP.
---
I've just started hunting down the large groups that seem to go for it now. You see 1000 caps on the map, there's probably two or three other players there. May as well just start being an assassin for yourself :) dunno what to tell ya. Can't beat the assholes join em and then kill them lmao
---
Wouldn't say dementia. More sociopathic tendancies, mild psychotic tendancies, and a healthy dollop of narcissism
---
Tip: don't worry about it. This is Reddit.
---
Look at the Hot posts - it will generally balance out (sans raids and other silliness).
---
it happens constantly. hence why im asking for some sort of safeguard to stop it from happening.
---
i don't go to whitesprings or any other location for that matter that is being nuked because im not set up for it, i avoid them.
---
First world problems. lol
---
It’s a shame people even feel the need to destroy camps. You don’t get anything out of it. Right now, until they change something, it just makes you a prick.
---
I had that issue with my sloth,  my deathclaw did not and was friendly and liked photo ops with passersby. The first hostile player(level 38) used the fire smg on it (level 21), the deathclaw destroyed them. Still took a lot of damage but not like a TSE.
---
Okay commie
---
sounds like you are going around witch hunting for duppers... 
---
i mean lets be real the map is big you can go hours and not run into anyone.  if you " encountered 6 in the span of **one hour**" you were looking for them.  literally you are the guy that sees two dots next to each other and assumes they are.  then you go mess with people that are probably innocent and end up grefing them, if that you you are just as bad as duppers.
---
lol, yeah i\`ve met some of those too :)
---
I run it mostly for lower level guys looking for help
---
"I'm JuSt SuPpOrTiNg My CoUnTrY"
---
"At least an hour"
---
-Bethesda forums from a google search
---
Altho, prior experience says to expect at LEAST a couple. 
---
It sucks, but IMO, the best way to deal with this, is not to deal with it—switch servers—don’t give them the satisfaction.
---
Responding, ironically, likely encourages it to continue; it gives them a challenge; feeds their “fun-factor;” gives them the rise they look for.
---
I’m sure when they read posts like these, it’s a notch on their belt.
---
People play the game in their own way. For me, I don’t play with people who don’t play nice, and fortunately, the game still allows me to do that.
---
The term exploit is relative... Being able to search the medkits in the watoga medical center was in exploit yeah?
---
There is a difference between cheating and exploiting
---
Exploiting is using in game systems that anyone can do and in most cases is not bannable
---
(Btw I'm not defending the duppers simply saying I highly doubt they are getting banned based on other similar games where things like this has happened)
---
Lmao that's awesome 
---
The colors were actually flashing and changing kinda like a strobe light. Here's a pic from a few seconds later:

My pc can't handle it too well so I don't really play it anymore but it feels like GTA Online if it was a Fallout game which is pretty interesting tbh. 
---
Strange, sorry folks! I had never seen it happen until yesterday, and then it was twice within a couple of hours. Hmm.
---
I've had it where I've forgotten to equip X repair mod then repaired to 100% and had to go purposefully damage the item to 99% to be able to repair it to 200%.
---
Ugh.
---
Just take your time with the game, don't rush it and the endgame does not start at  level 50
---
This could be a legitimate player who just loves farming nuke cards and cola. 
---
Just place like 5 metal doors in the same spot. Place everything you have in the camp, move your camp to another place and your budget will be like 5 times larger 
---
I found one your missing; Brotherhood scribe outfit with cap, wearing it currently.
---
You two just made this guy feel even worse! 
---
I got lucky with a 3* Instigating Lever action rifle. Also got a 2* 50cal machine gun exploding shot.
---
I do the event every time it pops up and mostly get armour pieces.
---
you know you can toggle them off in the pip-boy, right?
---
the hazmat suit. best for when you spawn in the "nuke zone" aka the whitesprings
---
Except it's not.  Duping has made that redundant. 
---
Username checks out
---
Perception gives more accuracy and longer visibility range.
---
Yaaaaaaaay
---
The graphics aren't terrible but they aren't really up to standards with current titles. As someone that recently played through RDR2, I was pretty underwhelmed with the graphics of fallout. The online in fallout is much more fun than red dead online but the graphics aren't even close
---
I wanted to comment to say that I really like your chupacabra username. And that sharing is caring, especially something as valuable as your time.
---
Thank you!!!
---
That link shows a single image, and nothing on how identify OR handle dupers.
---
I might agree ... But having seen third trade inventory, and knowing there isn't enough ammo in Appalachia to bring down 60k cargo bots.... 
---
Everyone knows what exploiting is and it's a bannable offense, especially when the effects are so significant.
---
Haha wow thanks comedian that was a very original and funny comment that took years of processing to come up with huh?
---
Seems like the community here is giving their opinion on the matter. The census seems to disagree with you about it being a cheat. But I can appreciate your integrity and not compromising your ideals in the face of adversity, whether you’re right or wrong
---
I gave up using blueprints as I was never able to successfully relocate a built base with just two foundations. If the OP is like a lot of players who love intricate and realistic camps, her camp's footprint is even larger than that. I know mine has 11 foundations now. 
---
"Dupers don't affect me so they aren't bad".
---
Gotcha.
---
I'm sure this annoying thing bothers me almost as much as the person who made the downvote bot was bothered by 76.
---
Read the text
---
For me the one big thing is get to know the rhythm of how YOU play the game.
---
Already saved so much time on inventory management just by knowing what kind of needs I have in terms of crafting and healing. Use to carry around so much stuff I thought I'd need but end up never using it because I'm always finding more. Also dumped stuff I never end up using, even though it feels bad to just drop it.
---
I think this could be related to the age of many console players vs that if PC games. Any kid can get Mom and Dad to during for an Xbox where a gaming PC is a different story. 
---
LOL I know, it was meant to be funny. 
---
I think we're onto something.
---
You seem a little nervous here.
---
&gt;to become a master crafter and be able to craft and mod all items
---
Shame there's no system for allowing you to be a master craftsmen and mod peoples existing weapons/armor for them. I feel like this is what Bethesda wanted us to do, but I'll be damned if I'm giving away my best weapons/armor to someone who's on their *honor* to mod and return them.
---
this **could** have worked if legendaries didn't exist. If my best rifle was a handmade, and I know how to make handmades, I'd be willing to give it to you to mod. If you stole it, then it's not too big of a set back for me because I can just craft(or have someone else craft) another one. But since legendaries exist, I'm not trading you my two-shot 1* handmade because it's the only one I've ever found and there's nothing to prevent you from keeping it.
---
I figured...
---
But since its Reddit... Lol
---
So long as you know the options! I gave up on security entirely and no ones ever attacked or caused trouble at my shop. I removed the locked terminal and use a pressure plate that opens the external door and have a unpowered lockable door on the interior if I feel the need to secure a section of the base.
---
Go to the gym in flatwoods. Loads of lead and the overseers camp is just right up the road. 
---
Actually many sounds played quickly can crash the client 
---
That's a cheeseburger build. It's real and works as shown I use it. It's insanity. 
---
Start choosing how you actually want your class set-up. When you get to level 51 you can respec points to different specials. About level 70 or so and you'll probably have your class near perfect. Choose good cards that actually mean something, like damage, or weight reducing. My weapons are doing damage in the hundreds, but I'm also saving around 600 pounds due to weigh perks. If you collect stuff, go for weight. The min-max players hate that though. They want that 1% more damage instead of 50 more weight.
---
What are you even talking about? Still cant make a real point so now your commenting on me for no reason? Wowza
---
If you place the nuke south east of fissure prime, so that the fissure is right at the edge of the nuke zone, most of the time you can fight the queen outside of the nuke zone, so no rads.
---
I'm level 58 and I'm not even close to endgame. Im still learning every time I play. 
---
Just so you're aware, it's possible to let them know the bug still exists without feeling the need to become a sarcastic jackass about it. 
---
That kinda sucks, given I dont play on any platform but ps4.  I would love to have them.
---
Either way you got a chuckle outta me. Shame the MAGAbois are out attemptjng downvote en masse lol
---
How many subscribers have you gained from all these alt accounts?
---
Most of us really like the Fallout games for lots of different reasons and don't mind them trying something new with the IP. It's been fun exploring what directions they can take it. 
---
Alright it's been a shitshow of a launch and it's disheartening to see Bethesda not seemingly address the problems which have been going on since 3, and take their time to put out something they could be more proud of and less infuriating for us players. 
---
On a good day when things work, the game is really quite enjoyable.
---
Okay, then I want a hat with swastikas.
---
You can’t deny the similarities in our requests
---
Exactly ;)
---
And remember that someone probably didn't make a bot for this and they're sitting there clicking every one to downvote it for revenge on the world that somehow unfairly hurt them......
---
It's kind of funny.... in a sadistic way, I guess.
---
Amazing story. These are the things that will keep this game alive for much longer than many expected.
---
why "y'all" though ?
---
hahahah similar to my experince the first week, someone trying to grief me for about 10 min in Whitespring until I jump in front of a robot. Was a good laugh...and drop ton of usefull loot tbh
---
The best weapon I've found so far is a 3* level 40 explosive western revolver with extra vs player damage and 1 agility. I'm not doing pvp so the extra player damage is useless to me.
---
Hopefully I'll find a level 50 replacement soon.
---
Indeed. I've got two parts of my house: the outside, with workshops and a bed, and the inside, with Max level locks. I sneak anyway.
---
Why not, right? 
---
It should, but realistically it's not going to happen
---
I can understand that. My apologies.
---
Unfortunatley, By the time i figured out what was going on there was already alot of damage done. Once my brother had killed him and i re-spawned to see the damage i quickly quit so he couldnt come back. I will leaver the server sooner next time someone starts to do that again.
---
Alt F4. If you don't want to be that quick just exit to main menu. If you can find their names in recent and blockity block block. 
---
The better perks that make life easier show up at around lvl 50. Starched genes for mutations. 
---
Super Duper for all crafting. 
---
Those are the top two I can think of. Plenty of others make it cheaper and easier to craft ammunition, armour pieces and guns etc. 
---
Make life at lvl 50+ much easier in the game, and enjoyable. 
---
Disabling the turrets from any terminal disables the turrets in the entire silo.  Alternatively, before disabling, remove the targeting restrictions to have the turrets shoot robots. Gives a few minutes before robots respawn.
---
Scorch are not ghouls. Wtf are you talking about? Scorchbeasts arent animals either, if anything they would be a "wasteland creature"
---
There is "zealots" legendary effecf which is +damage to scorched and "ghoul slayers" legendary effect which is +damage to ghouls. They are not the same.
---
Yes, because calling me a commie was so original. Think of it all by your little self, or did Daddy Trump tell you to us it next time someone was mean to you
---
I must be a bot. Every post is zero before you can click refresh.
---
A couple of my posts were supposed to be fun stuff, or helpful things. someone decided to go through my post history and downvote every last one I made. Even though upsetting, it’s whatever.
---
It's truly mind boggling that Bethesda allows player camps to be attacked and destroyed. I know the theory is players might become trapped in a griefer's base, but from the videos players have posted, it would seem that trapped players panic and neither destroy the base to get away *nor* server hop.
---
Not to mention how much all the crafting components to create stable flux costs. (Looking at you hardened mass, high-rad fluids, ionized meat, etc.)
---
Because it's mainstream! If you are a minority who actually likes this game, this is to be expected. Outside of reddit, you can hardly even post one positive thing about this game without getting bashed.
---
What's really popular nowadays is praising Outer Worlds as the best game that has ever existed and possibly will exists and saying that who ever likes anything from BGS isn't a true Fallout fan. Oh and Youtubers already saying that Cyberpunk is also something godly, but most of youtubers are pathetic crying babies who can't get a 3-7 job.
---
Except Jon, I like Jon.
---
Tldr: it's not popular atm to like fallout 76.
---
thats how Fallout 76 works
---
There isn't any. It's a direct image link. The only text is in the screenshot.
---
It's like being around kids at a beach, the more fun you have building your sandcastle, the more evil enjoyment they get from destroying it like little internet trolls. Sorry you had a very unwanted experience. 
---
Keep throwing stones hoping one hits the target. 
---
Everyone else understood perfectly what I'm talking about. You are the odd one out. Wonder why.
---
That's cool. I'm just up from you in Summersville on the river.
---
Yeah definitely, just have the player go to Vault 76, it's a safe zone that can't be nuked.
---
Has it been confirmed people have been banned for dupping?
---
And where in the EULA does it say you can be banned for using in game systems? (And I don't mean the catch all "we can ban anyone for anything")
---
Karma is nothing other than a crutch for the insecure. It really doesn't mean anything of value.
---
Yeah, may get more visibility but there are plenty of trash posts with high upvotes as well as interesting and engaging posts with single/double digit karma.
---
Less AP per shot is based on the mods actually;  like the barrels.  Aligned Barrel is good for medium range, reduces recoil and uses less AP.   Stablized barrel uses more AP, higher range and + accuracy when sighted.
---
Short barrels tend to be heavier but less AP to shoot.   It all depends on the mod itself.
---
No, not right, that is not a reason. Why not eat shit, for example ?
---
I think thats what really made me mad about all of this was that he got nothing out of this, but to see someone else suffer. 
---
At that point I wasn't even able to do that all that well, it was kind of a shit show. The Queen go to half health and regen'ed and the fight was over. 
---
Now that I have all the right Perk cards for my build I will get in more often (I am also at the last quest, so there isn't much else to do either! ha!)
---
I always think a while for usernames. This is my regular Xbox gamertag with a space instead of an underscore. And I also have plenty of time. Stay at home disabled replacement dad.
---
Well she's dead and I have no idea if I got xp for the hits I managed to get in. 
---
Sounds like you built your home on a molerat home, how rude? 
---
Aww man, why can't I get into things like this? I end up getting killed it yelled at when I try to engage other players most times. Guess my gt could be an issue lol.
---
No idea, read the EULA and let us know.
---
Do these guys have two accounts of is there some way to play characters at once
---
Could be. Reddit usually has some protection against mass downvotes. One of the trickier rules is downvotes against a post you've reached by direct link usually don't get counted. I think that's still a rule, anyway.
---
I still prefer to imagine some poor schmuck angst voting.
---
I can’t imagine drinking all that cola by pressing a controller button. Maybe on the PC you could write a macro. 
---
Wow...thx. Y'all take care now. 
---
I saw a clipboard at work the other day and, no joke, had to stop myself from reaching for it. 
---
Lmao the Free States are literal commies, and I don't even care from trump. America should and always will be great. You Lead-Head-Reds wouldn't understand that, would you?
---
"you dont get anything out of it"...i really dont understand this mindset.  "Let the process be the payoff" is one of my favorite life lesson phrases.  If you enjoy the act of doing something, that is reward in itself.  If you are only going to work at a job u dont like just for the paycheck, find a job that will make u happy for more than just the money.
---
Well it's more difficult for beth than you make it seem. If they put a MAGA hat in, then they should include paraphenalia from every other country or risk outrage and an even greater increase in sales loss due to bias. It's best to keep the gane as generic as possible, with the only reference to the US being lore friendly. 
---
I would give reddit shiney for a video of a non-staged encounter of a last laugh orbital strike.
---
You can download the patch now while the servers are down. 
---
I just did. 
---
"Username checks out"
---
Lmao your post history checks out pal. 
---
Get the heavy variants of combat armor, and add the BoS mod. If I'm not mistaken, that's the best for damage and energy resistances, without factoring legendaries. Add legendary heavy combat armor is fairly common. Note that the legendary affix overrides the heavy affix in the name, so you have to look at the armor stats to figure out if it's a regular or heavy piece.
---
Wow. Last time I made a post with that title it failed to fuckin post. Alright bethesda.
---
Fixed it, sorry. Reddit noob
---
Same.
---
Just picture the running mascara and altar with our names crossed out in the name of Todd.
---
It makes it enjoyable.
---
I disagree with the "same karma put on the same servers", but I'd say people with a very negative karma should be pointed and trackable by people with a very positive karma.
---
To win karma, you could build stuff at other member's CAMP, do Responder's quests, etc. To lose karma.... well, we all know how to do this, right ?
---
I've read them from other games it's all the same...
---
Like I said they are not going to ban people for it unless they are using 3rd party systems...just because you want them banned doesn't mean it's going to happen
---
Working now, thanks
---
Also with the Ballistics Ammo perk, all 5mm ammo is weightless.  You could carry around 20k ammo and not be impacted.
---
I recommend mining lead and iron ores with excavator pa though to keep up with the ammo.
---
Also if you find a 1 star furious Gatling, its going to be better than most 2 star.
---
Heres a tip rember those bobblehead they can actually stack lets say you have 5 bobblehead (Any bobblehead that will increase damage for a specific category E.g explosive) you can get more damage 
---
There's no official level cap, however, there's a soft cap of level 50 right now.  That's due to the fact that level 50 is the gear and special point cap.  Beyond that, you only get perk cards or move special points around.  You don't really get any stronger aside from completing your build.
---
So your saying you are just saying things in hopes of one of them sticking?
---
I don't think making the bags more noticeable since theft when you die would escalate.
---
I really feel sorry for anyone on gov't payroll/contracts durit this mess. Especially when, from what i understand, essential service providers have to carry on working unpaid.
---
The entire thing seems like an exploitative, very unfunny joke
---
I killed a wanted player and there were like 8 people so I was suprised ko one attacked him and I just walked around and found a goldfbag with a guy next to inspected it and saw all these legendary nabbed it ran dropped it In a lake and hes messaging me a ransom he wants it back for 25k or all his tse guns  
---
I prefer crit savvy over fourleaf.  On my rifleman vats build. 
---
Once u get ur crit filled up, with cit savvy rank3 its basically, crit shot every other shot. 
---
Crit, shot refills meter, crit, etc... 
---
Pro tip: check low level players achievements to verify.  thanks for that!
---
I have yet to have a vendor offer over 200 caps for a single item, so by the time I make my rounds to the 7 different vendor groups, I can usually max out my 1400 caps/day. If you are getting offers for over 200, you could probably pull a perk card to lower it and get it sold. 
---
I dump all my extra Plans and Recipes in the Overseer's Stash in Flatwood. All my Energy ammo too, since I'm not using Energy weapons. I don't know if other players can pick up stuff from that box, but it has a much larger capacity than a Trash bin.
---
Also the toxic players are the ones I want to help the most. I used to be toxic. Didn’t know it till I was able to look back. I was there a decade ago. 
---
This is some seriously quality camp building! Well done. Would love for my toon to be able to visit sometime. Are you on XB?
---
Interesting... really wish I could find a solid guide with this information.  I have heard many variants on what different people think happens.
---
Thanks for the insight.
---
I just want to know if it's possible to get a Quad Missile launcher and then put the triple or quad barrel on it. Seems like that could be a lot of hurt going out. 
---
And make the ghouls pay for it
---
Lol people who played this game is to those who understand it and i really appreciate those who tried and manage to get used to it (E.g Bugs and Glitch) and for those people who dont understand are like youtubers giving reviews which Fallout 76 is bad to tell the truth they just really sucks and dont know how to play it, of course his a "fallout fan" for the past years but have he really tried to beat the game (fallout 3 or4,) lol they can even manage to get level 100+ in fallout 3 or 4 (i am happy to see a Singleplayer to multiplayer which makes the game more fun) even though without NPC but we all know why there is no NPC
---
Downvoted because your nick reminds me of an ex.
---
/s
---
It's Comrade Chubbs.
---
Probably speaks less to the size of the player base as to how much of an asshole this particular player is. 
---
Can you even write one sentence withouf trying to crowbar in an insult?
---
Sounds like someone didn't get enough attention as a kid.
---
OP is probably bulking all just from a mentally efficient PoV. Don't think, just bulk and sell excess. 
---
It's plastic inefficient but the cases were you're actually wasting plastic aren't that frequent.
---
I'm with you though. Tend to only bulk though automatically and on demand when selling.
---
Think he's doubled his fanbase of 1 if he's lucky. All his sub's are his alts :)
---
Wait greater durability increases the DR of armor? I've never noticed that, does the perk say that's what it does?
---
I thought armor had the same stats no matter what the durability, until it breaks and then it's all zero's.
---
I think I may be a bounty hunter when this char grows up a bit more. I just hit 50 and am just now starting to be able to wander most areas of the wasteland. I have a 2 shot explosive lever action rifle and a suit of ultracite power armor. I'm just about ready. I need to move a few special points around before I do any serious hunting. LOL 
---
Struggling with that reading comprehension, huh?
---
It could though and they are legally covered.
---
Regional dialects exist
---
Okay MtF, I didn't get enough attention as a kid.
---
I had it happen too, left a building and for no reason my health was plummeting faster than I could heal. Everyone says "you had a disease, it was your rads, you didn't have the right perk cards" and whatever other excuse they could muster. But my rads weren't dropping and unless my character suffered the disease of Total Organ Failure, it wasn't a disease that did it. I hope it gets fixed ASAP
---
Same here but i've learned not to add so many low levels to my friends list since they bite off my whole hand.
---
Old posts under attack. Funny
---
Its down to about 16$ at a few resellers now. 
---
So, you can't think of anything then
---
Those are almost the only kinds of camps I ever find in game. A floating platform and as many turrets as I'm presuming their budget allowed. :|
---
Hahahahahahahahhaahhahaa
---
Add digitalgunsligr.  I play casual and slow and enjoy the exploration.  
---
I'm really not understanding you, I guess? 
---
Lol. That's it. Keep grasping at straws. Sorry that me calling you out on your bullshit triggered you kiddo. I'm sure a good little cry on your blog will help
---
amor at 199% 99% and 1% take the same materials to repair.
---
let that sink in.
---
in all open world survival games, the end game is pvp raider other players camps/bases.  to me, i thought 76 was a fallout themed open world survival game, and im probably not the only one.  However 76 tried to be too many types of games at once, and there shouldnt even be pacifist mode in an open world survival game.  Some people wanted co-op only fallout, other wanted open pvp fallout, and then there are those that just wanted another single player fallout.  Trying to appeal to all these people created this confusing mess of a wanted/pacifist system.  Until the duping is fixed and the inventories are wiped, pvp will be an unbalanced awful experience, even for those who only bought the game for that aspect of the game.
---
Ok thanks
---
It also goes to show what you are and aren't using, so you could potentially modify your looting routine.  Not that there's anything wrong with making extra caps by bulking, but if you know for a fact that you rarely use a particular material, it makes the choice of what to drop easier when you're overencumbered.
---
Yeah, i can't understand either why you wrote "y'all" and it seems you can't either
---
Still just going for personal jabs eh? I noticed only one of your comments in this entire post hasent been downvoted. Im sure that means IM the one who doesnt understand.
---
Not sure what system you were playing on, but did you report their gamertag afterwards?
---
You're funny. Have fun being an America hating commie. I'd curbstomp you in game of I ever saw your pathetic existence in my server.
---
Oh...bc it's how I talk...I guess that's unacceptable? 
---
Bethesda's shit with Fallout 4 too. Every time they update the game, it breaks the script extender (F4SE). Granted, updates aren't that common as they only happen when new things are added to the CC but still. 
---
The communists are here. They told us they were coming.
---
Not to be rude. You should have quit instantly so your camp moves away with you and probably you repair less... Thats what i do wuen some idiot breaking stuff
---
Well my rifle build has 1 strength meaning I can't carry jack shit. With unyielding my strength can go up to ~15 so I can carry my rifles. High PER increases vats accuracy, higher AGI increases AP, higher LCK makes crits fill faster, etc.
---
That's fine. You'll get there.
---
How much glowing fungus did you eat before seeing this?
---
Good luck finding them. It's not easy to sue a name on the internet. And it's not like the FBI or Interpol has time to track down these people(assuming they're even violating a law to begin with) they're handling real criminals with real victims.
---
(XB1X) After 220+ hours on this game I get this maybe once every 3 days of playing. Usually happens in my perk selection screen (which makes it almost impossible to properly swap them sometimes.) Swapping servers usually fixes it for me.
---
Damn i need to try this next time, thanks :)
---
I think there is usually one in the bathroom of the Sutton train station.
---
I started a gunslinger type guy. It's fun for leveling. But once I hit  max level of was kinda underwhelming. Could just be me tho. I turned him into melee. Lol. Luckily in was taking slugger because I got the baseball plan early so I was running around "negan"ing mother fuckers. My friend was making a shotty build he would cripple enemies and is bash an in the head. Very satisfying
---
I'll have to test it myself. I only built my first set last night.
---
It's too bad you can't actually put those in the beer hat and use it. The stat changes would stay the same, just double the duration. [](/bjbubbles)
---
dude, if you don't get what he is saying you may have the RC problem. you have made no point while dude here has put them in front of you like a thanksgiving dinner.
---
own it, you were wrong. BTW people understand what you are saying, you are just having a hard time understanding you are wrong.
---
This happend to me i usually relog in and works perfectly fine 
---
Hmm.. Not too sure. Gonna test it out later and see what happens 
---
&gt;right back to selling fancy paper hats in runescape for unreasonable amounts of money. The only difference is that it involves dupes
---
Actually paper hats in Runescaped were duped too, if you didn't know.
---
You talk like saying "bc" ?
---
Downloading Version 1.07 now on PS4, 3.572GB
---
Start downloading now while you wait for servers to go back up
---
Actually it’s 27 lbs... I used to carry one. Her name was Sasha.
---
No because it's a slogan used by Republicans. Democrats and people who hate trump will throw fits. Just like if Beth added an l "Im with her hat" Republicans would boycott the game. It's just not a good idea for video games to get into modern politics. On either side.
---
A lot of solid changes here, though I do hope to see some focus put on the "End Game" or 50+ content as soon as possible. Nerfing the White Spring grind is good, but right now once you hit a certain point the game kinda falls down when it comes to content. :(
---
I planned on making a new character tonight and trying to go for sort of a paramedic type role. Sneaking and stealth attacks for when I have to engage but able to carry tons of chems and have them be super effective and all that
---
Is this a console issue? I never came across a griefer in the 200 hours of gameplay on PC. Mostly just the people farming the usual spots for legendaries and sometimes a mule character waiting for a trade but not deliberate CAMP destruction (which can easily be mitigated by moving it a tiny bit then rebuilding with the saved plans).
---
Sucks that it happened.
---
I'd deal with it the same way to deal with arseholes in real life - just ignore them. Well in this case, block and switch servers.
---
They crave attention and you just gave them that. Don't even give them the satisfaction of engaging, regardless of whether you wipe the floor with them or not.
---
The best revenge is to live a good life, cause arseholes like that aren't.
---
Ok. I understand you. I shan't speak in lingo or the vulgarity of the plebians any longer. Post haste. 
---
I would have taken a bribe if it was for serum plans, not something I have to click on 50,000 times.
---
Your last point is very very wrong for any vats build, but I agree with everything else you have said. Those 2 bullets do not connect at the same spot, they have their own bullet path. Vats says 95% accuracy but you will miss much more often with 2 shot vs bloodied.
---
At least you're honest
---
There are a number of people who are retired or disabled that play most of the day and socialize via gaming.
---
Tbh I got that tip from someone else on here a while back so can’t take the credit for that one, unfortunately. Glad I could help, though!
---
nvm, carry on
---
All i can say is avoid workshops =/
---
It could also be really not as interesting as the OP thinks it is.
---
there are still weapons out there to be duped.
---
Im on PC and no I did not. Unfortunately this is part of the game so there isnt anything to report on other than they were being an asshole.
---
It just tells you if a silo is on lockdown or ready for launch prep. One day it even said error....system offline.. lol.
---
Trust me I've tried everything short of sacrificing a chicken but I'm thinking of trying that now too.
---
Uranium fever event
---
On the subject of Junk: every desk fan and clipboard is worth taking.  If you can spare the weight, so are typewriters and telephones.  These contain screws or springs which, next to ballistic fiber, tend to be the bottleneck in crafting things.
---
Also, always take military-grade ammo bags and duct tape.  Always take duct tape in general, along with Wonderglue.
---
Remember that you need to actually click on a Plan or Recipe in the Misc tab in order to apply it.  If you find scrolling down to the Ps is tedious, use the Sort By (WT) option - since both these things have weight, they'll sort to the top.
---
Lol, i'd like to see you try kid. I'm so sorry you take a flair so personally though. I'd recommend a good therapist, but i wouldn't want to waste their time on you.

---
Am I wrong for wanting exploiters to be punished? That's a new one!
---
I'm typically over 20 luck from 15 base + unyielding armors.  I have a lot of confidence in saying luck does not affect legendary drops.  Or I just have shit luck IRL, which is usually not the case!
---
I heard that it caps at level 40 so it isn’t worth the time, is that true?
---
I thought items are locked at lvl 40 for that event? 
---
this hasnt happened to me before so my first thought was i will stop him with my tse handmade real quick. That didnt work out so well and i quit shortly after. I will quit faster in the future
---
Yeah  thats what i do but im trying to figure groups of people IF they are doing unusual 
---
When you've made over $120 from duping, you're gonna buy a second copy of the game to store extra items on, that's just how Mafia works.
---
Wow, thats bad luck man. I just got a berserker's explosive gatling laser from a bloodbug outside watoga station.
---
“Donny, you’re out of your element!”
---
Sounds good to me then
---
His point isn’t that it’s not hard to hid max caps, it’s that it IS hard to not notice that you’re close when you go to sell your stuff.
---
Imagine carrying a kid for 9+ months in your stomach for it to think it's a girl
---
That doesnt even make sense. Youve clearly given up trying to say anything of value here.
---
In my last camp I built a bathroom that I used to "take a dump"
---
My new camp has a bus with some containers in the build area, so I put a vault boy sign with FREE LOOT pointing to the bus. I dump all my extra stuff in the containers inside now for other players to pick through.
---
Oh never thought of that
---
Confirmed nerfed. Drops level 40 items max. Can confirm I have not got a level 45/50 drop from this event. (Didn't run it before aforementioned nerf).
---
"people witch hunting don't affect me so they are not\* bad".
---
same thing, its not your job to hunt people down, its a video game. if you do not like how it is playing currently because of exploiters the answer is simple. put the game down for a bit and let the developers fix the problem. 
---
When I first started FO76 - Man the atmosphere was so good. But I have deffo had some weird days recently. 
---
I think people are bored of endgame so the new game is luring players to traps or just messing with people. I'm a pretty friendly player so I love to help people out and team up. 
---
The other day i had someone saying they were super lonely and had no one to play with, they wanted to show me their camp. I went over and it turns out it was a trap that they had made over a big fall whilst their buddies watched - as I have goat legs I didnt even die. I just left the game feeling like a chump. 
---
The duping method which was patched just caused server instability and *could* lead to crashes. The new duping method works by crashing the server. The servers are probably shit too but the dupers aren't helping matters.
---
Just cause it’s not technically an mmo doesn’t mean it won’t be subject to certain side effects of an mmo. It’s got in game vendors, rare items, bugs, and trading. So yeah we see the same problem as in an mmo.
---
I would normally agree, but I HAVE let them know and every day they respond back with the same snide "Read the Original Response" message.  So given that, I believe my response is warranted.  But hey, thanks for taking the time to put your .02 in.  (read sarcasm)
---
Lol, every post in this thread has negative votes. That is funny.
---
Snallygashers drop acid as do Grafton monsters. 
---
Nobody cares about dupers.
---
Yes. Now it's up to Beth to do the right thing.
---
If they didn't trash server stability I'd just keep ignoring them while playing solo. But they do, so I can't 
---
Honestly as in-game jackassery goes that's pretty low key. I'm not saying it's entirely lacking in jerkiness, but of all the things I've heard of people (occasionally) doing to others this is... Well idk. I hope that dude got what he wanted out of that!
---
Oh, I do. I play 76 too. I’m just not acting like it’s the best game ever cause random shit happens. Why does that bother you guys? 
---
But the downvote bot got turned off! New posts currently not downvoted!
---
What patch? we just got a patch...
---
I haven't had my own turret attack me, but some dude's camp had one missile turret amongst the 5 that really didn't like me. Man, did that missile have a long range. 
---
Well then drop the MMO talk when you have no idea and think again.
---
https://nukacrypt.com/how
---
Okay I had the knife to the chicken's throat when I read this so you might have saved him.  Are you being serious and if so, what do you mean 5 metal doors?
---
Yeah i know that, but sometimes you gotta stay chill and act fast and think clearly, so dont bother killing them or let him attack your base till his wanted then quit fast and if you have a friend in that server join back then kill him 
---
Noise boxes?
---
Hmm...
---
Build on a spawn point that spawns a specific creature that's easy fodder for heavy turrets. I built right between a level 5 mirelurk spawn and a level 5 super mutant spawn and my turrets clean them up quick, no problem. I can fast travel in and out all I want and never get much base damage. I had to play with my turret and food plot locations to make the lurks mind their own business (too close to them and it attracts them, far enough away and they stay put).
---
Well for those that dont want pvp,  pacifist mode should be like: you cant harm other and others cant harm you.  
---
The assaultron heads always clog up my stash. They don't scrap automatically and weigh 8 pounds. When I start to run out of stash space I check the junk tab and sure enough there will be 2 or 3 in there.
---
BZZT! Sorry, better luck next time. Thanks for playing!
---
Fort defiance should be decent if you nuke it all the ghouls become bloated glowing ones and it’s in the cranberry bog so there should be some good legendarys 
---
Haha. Was in the resort the other night and a lvl 57 wanted to trade I did not want to trade so he shot at me with an explosive. I think he had passive on but the splash hit a mr handy. He died fast and left his paper bag in the hallway. Thank you for the hardened mass. 
---
If customer service can't fix it, what are you trying to accomplish?
---
Sutton train station, the cooking areas around Fort defiance
---
They dropped another nuke. It happened again .I'm watching my gpu usage drop to zero everytime and tabbing out and back in forces it to catch up. 
---
I'm so fucking pissed. second time I hit it a hell of a lot when it wasn't Frozen and still got no rewards.
---
I'm livid 
---
For acid if you don't mind server hopping, go to hemlock holes walk out into the valley kill mister Grafton monster and take his acid. Next you walk to the downed vertibird and if luck is in your favour you can wipe out the snallygasters for some acid and finally walk to hemlock holes maintenance workshop and collect the acid from the ground ( you can still find spots to harvest even if there is a resource collector on the acid spots) bonus acid if some one owns the workshop because it's usually a noob without locks. Rinse and repeat. 
---
Got me 400+ acid in an hour
---
You did the right thing. Although, you don’t need to go as far as accusing him and starting anything unnecessarily. Take screenshot with his name on it (if you are in trade window and in inventory tab, it shows name) and just report it to bethesda. Help clean this game of the cheaters. 
---
Don't bother directly farming them, next to no one got it that way. It likely will never drop.
---
Farm caps and buy it from trade Reddit or Discord.
---
The drop-rate of armor for a game that has a PA-majority is quite crazy.
---
Tbh yes and no
---
I personally dont get why everyone has been getting upset with glitches like duping and all.when the eco of this game isnt very well developed at all because glitches like these exist. And should honestly stay to be frank.
---
These werw bugs from the older titles that hasnt been fixed and slowly been patched out but there will be a new way.
---
Just let people.dup. the pvp sucks anti armor explaove two shot etc etc just instantly kill and break walls and all and any other mods suck.for damage output. Killing enemies isnt hard at all and getting an abundance of resources just takes a few hours.
---
The dupers exist and theres tons of them. Report them yea but to be fair...they shouldnt be banned but the weapons items etc be removed from the game instead. Its not hard to see duplicates in an inventory id imagine. Has x amount of legendaries with the same modifiers and attachments in inventory/stash then they would be deleted but 1.
---
Idk just my take.
---
You need a hug man?
---
wow there is a PvP meta ? 
---
Hey its awesome you are letting them know and are consistent with it, these things just take time I guess. 
---
I never said that ghouls and zealots are the same. What i said was that the scorched are a variant of ghouls who have contracted the scorch plague. Learn to read. That is taken directly from the wiki.
---
no you are not wrong, but this is the thing every game has them. i can tell you %100 that most AAA games were not running around with ban hammers in the first months of them game or before or after dropping new content. there are other priorities they have to focus on. 
---
fail
---
Hey I just asked a similar question, not seeing yours.  Do critical boosting receivers only count toward VATs criticals?  Not headshots?
---
I would simply appreciate an honest response.  Hey we are aware of this issue and it's being worked.  Instead I get the same snide response every day about how I must be a moron who can't read.
---
At Sutton now, not in the bathroom, looking around. 
---
After they finish the pve....
---
this is why there is an outcry for different server types, if not private servers.  As an open world survival player, i have interest in engaging in pvp with solo players or pacificsts. I dont want them on my server at all.  Hopefully this will be adressed "in the first quarter of the year" like bethesda has said
---
Glad we have you here gatekeeping genre comparisons. *hugs*
---
Fuck yes bro.  I learned about these from the Bethesda forums in Fo3.  "DEAD is DEAD" play throughs.
---
Yes you did, everyone is entitled to their opinion and to react accordingly as long no harm to a second or third party is done. 
---
Bethesda does not care about dupers, server instability caused by dupers and not by Bethesda using cheap ass servers is yet to be proven, and having dupers around who sells serums at decent prices instead 3.6k a pop comes in handy. 
---
Job numbers, Black/Hispanic employment, GDP, China buying rice(he sold rice to China), pulling out of Syria. If you knew about politics the numbers that indicate how well a country is doing are all favorable. But you don't know these things. America is a Constitutional Republic not a Democracy.
---
Ummm hello?  ARK: Survival Evolved which is all about multiplayer but filled with Exploits that the devs admitted they cannot fix.
---
Most of us moved here when r/fallout basically became "lets bash 76 to whore for karma and because youtubers told me to hate it". Here and r/fo76filthycasuals are both great communities for the most part
---
Stabilized, under Intelligence, but it only works in PA
---
Move closer to mitigate miss chances. Use the increased stealth from all the extra agil from unyielding. 
---
From my testing even at 1 hp the damage from bloodied isn't as good as two shot I'm afraid. 
---
Hello.
---
I see your retorts, but you failed and have nothing useful to say.
---
I wonder if quick hands keeps the counter going
---
Making use of a bug or glitch in the game for personal benefit and not reporting it is covered in the Bethesda EULA
---
It is. It isn't worth the time. 
---
When will my mans God Howard add the Quantum Paint for the X-01 Armor though? It looks real fine in Nuka World
---
That and railroad spikes. I never use the railway rifle but somehow accumulated 1K ammo for it that was taking up some unwanted weight.
---
I haven't found a melee weapon better than All-rise that a power-armor user can wield. And i'm lvl 144.
---
People are trash.    
---
I'm sure the stuff a lvl 300 scams off lowbies is totally worth it! /s  
---
The level of sad someone's life would have to be to grind 300 levels of scamming starters out of their crappalicious beginner gear and 32 caps. 
---
What's this now?
---
The patch you are currently downloading contains the fix for that.
---
That's a myth.
---
There are two things that can happen:
---
1) You've messed up and given away your stuff when the trade menu reordered during another trade
---
2) Items offered in trade sometimes disappear from your inventory until the trade times out
---
The lower level either sold their gun or they'll have it back in a few seconds.
---
O... kay? What the hell just happened?
---
Well TSE is the meta because. Well. It's stupidly overpowered. With them patching fireproof we will be able to tank the explosive damage with the right armor. The other meta is running around in no cloths and punching stuff with an unarmed weapon that gets a boost from lower damage resistance. 
---
Pretty much my experience as well on Xbox 
---
The REAL question is, why is this alien wearing (what appears to be) alien power armor, such a bitch? Grafton monster is nothing next to death claws, scorch beasts, hell even often wendigo's.
---
You'd think they would be significantly stronger.
---
So how is the Zetan galaxy?
---
You talk like an angry internet dweller so I think really I am a winner here.
---
I dropped it along with all my other non-quest holo thinking it did nothing because it said system offline.
---
Who is witch hunting? I think you didn't read properly.
---
I'm literally asking: "hey Bethy, are you going to do anything about exploiters?" 
---
How is that witch hunting? *facepalm*
---
Now I'm afraid to launch my own nuke.
---
Upvote for a McClintocker. I tried camps at other places but never liked them. Mine is to the east behind the barracks and overlooking summerville lakebed. The doors always open if youre on the same server. Dont mind the turrets though. Just have those for the little annoying bastards that spawn up from time to time.

That's fine.

We're fast traveling spaces that shouldn't be possible. 
---
Take a picture when you get the slice of pie with the claw.
---
That is the true endgame. 
---
Just a ES was a game-changer for me.
---
Isn't there a 25k cap limit?
---
Nothing you said is untrue. But the tone in which you said it implies a darker meaning. Maybe you should have better self awareness.
---
that ones wrong actually
---
Like place some foundations attached to each other add walls and  door walk piece,  put a metal door in it,  a normally you can place a second metal door in the same door opening, also a third, fourth, fifth, etc, etc. So lets say you placed 5 metal doors in that same door opening. And you place all the stuff you need  but make sure everything is attached to the same bleuprint.  Then move your camp, place it on another spot  and when you check at the stored tab you will see you have 5 identical blueprints, of the stuff u just built before. 
---
Anytime you suspect anyone of exploiting and you have evidence as you clearly did, then yes reporting them was the correct decision. Its obvious this person was duping, you said them and they couldnt give a legitimate explanation. 
---
I encountered a guy that was level 2 from here on reddit that I was buying some plans from. Level 2 raised some serious flags. He had tons of random legendaries, ammo, and even had over 1000 cans of dog food. I asked if he was duping and he said no, he was his factions vendor. He had 10-15 other players that gave him items to open a shop and he had several players around him and they all had the same prefix in thier gamertag. (Like how all the members of FaZe use that word in their GTs.) He also said they were using a level 2 alt character because they cant be killed in PvP. Made sense and he didnt have loads of TSEs or bobbles so I bought the plans and some dog food and went about my day. In your case though it sounds to me that he was definitely cheating.
---
I can't speak for those people but I know for that amount of bounty I'd damn the risks and try anyway. I'm sure at least some of the people (maybe most or all) knew it was possible for him to be in someone else's base.
---
Lmao. Pathetic.
---
How do you think they get the weapons to you? That's right, you have to physically meet in game!
---
So all Beth has to do is setup the buyer, meet them in-game, note the name. Investigate the player, follow the emails, extra accounts, gather all the accomplices and have a big old swing at the ban-hammer.
---
But that's too obvious for them.
---
I wonder what do you think you won.Certainly you failed in what you were trying to do with the MMO argument.
---
Some of us do care about dupers/cheaters especially in an open world pvp game .. it kills ambition when we have such limited storage space and equipment that needs repair. Can I realistically compete with a duper sure, but think about all the shit I'd have to deal with to get back on my feet after a long fight, while they just log out log in and are loaded with a substantial amount of resources to keep em going. Makes some people go … uggg I'm almost out of resources now and can't realistically continue this but now their back on their feet for another 6 hours. 
---
Then there's the people who like to play markets in video games and it kill their ambition when it no longer is valuable to them to do what they do because the market is trash.
---
Different people different outcomes, some people just straight up don't give a shit because in all seriousness it doesn't impact their gaming experience, they like the game they login they explore and they find their own fun.
---
What is boils down to I think is most games, yes, want to ban or punish cheaters .. but it depends on the game and the devs to be honest, if in order to properly catch a cheater is to perform all these crazy queries against a db and sift through hours of debug output etc it's just to much wasted time and resources.
---
The only games I've really seen go out of the way to try and catch/punish cheaters is ones that specifically advertise a competitive aspect of their game where there is prizes and or notoriety for achieving better scores/going up the leader boards etc, cause that's top rated ambition killer right thur. Other games only tend to go after cheaters if it won't cost too much to do.
---
Clearly a feature; perhaps a random event instead of being attacked!
---
You get 0 damage if you miss, so that drastically changes output in reality. Not moving closer for a glass cannon sniper build with my bloodied explosive weapons. Again 95% accuracy but the two bullets split and go to the left and right of where I am shooting.
---
I'll take 5% less damage for 100% accuracy any day
---
I enjoy it when people think this works, my sledge then comes out and knocks you out of the park. 
---
It's the Zenimax EULA.
---
Paper-bag it.  By the time you get down there, you know enough to at least look at paper bags laying on the floor next to a vendor.
---
Yup and I have no issue with that.  I have issue with scumbags calling them exploiters. Like this OP insinuating about level 400+ people, akin to a witch Hunt against high levels.  Should be removed for violating Reddit rules.
---
I have a column for it. I just haven't gotten around to populating it yet. As I said, the spreadsheet is a work in progress. Stand by for updates. You should just be able to copy-paste the values for the columns assuming you sort your list the same as the original first. 
---
Not at all. I'm interested in discussing the point presented: should exploiters be punished or not?
---
But I'm not really interested in engaging in your childish back and forth. Thanks for participating, though.
---
Hey, I'm on xbone and still have not killed, fought, nor spawned the Queen, I'm level 70-80 something, have played throughout the beta, but still discouraged by the unstable servers and crashes. I'm still hopeful that I'll hop onto a server full of players similar to my level, down to take down the Queen.
---
Nada at Sutton and I’ve been there 100 times never seen one. Headed to Fort Defiance. 
---
It never existed, bring proof or stop spreading rumors.
---
You are the one who made personal remarks about me, you devolved this conversation yourself.
---
No, core chems like Buffout and Med-X do not appear to be craftable.
---
The minority of this is that you cant wire anything because your budget will be over 100%, so everything that need electricity cant be used. But you can make a larger camp.  I made my self a fort near the trainstation at top of the world (xbox though) 
---
My favorite legendary, one star I think, might be two, is a ghoul slaying cultist knife that reflects 50% of melee damage when blocking. Amazing against deathclaws. That's about it.
---
&gt;in all open world survival games, the end game is pvp raiding other players camps/bases.
---
Then they should go play those instead.  Most survival games heavily incentivize players to be dicks toward one another, encouraging trolling as part of the "fun."  We are drowning in those games, especially on PC.
---
Fallout 76 is ostensibly not about that.  Yes, PvP exists, but it should be clear to anyone that it basically doesn't work.  They decided to balance the game around single player and it was the right decision to do so, but consequently, there is no way that PvP will ever work well because of that.  The things that make single player fun break PvP.
---
Probably yes. Dupers and players who sells cheated stuff always falling back when they feel uncertain about their customers. You probably looked for it too long and he god suspicious. Yes you did the right thing. 
---
A lot of players follow the Castle Doctrine. If someone comes near my camp I go inside my house behind a locked door. If the other player doesn’t leave, I go out on my balcony and fire some warning shots and give the thumbs down.
---
Nuka grenades were recently nerfed in their damage.
---
Thanks. I'll update the spreadsheet.
---
Same thing happened with fo4. The Fallout community just doesn't like change.
---
Get rid of the crops.  Something about them increases attacks exponentially.  I was getting attacks every time I jumped when I had them.  No crops and have not seen a mob for weeks near my camp.
---
I have a question; What is best of these two hand-made rifles?
---
50% anti armor
---
or
---
50% extra dmg when enemy hp below 40%? 
---
I didn't reach endgame until level 100+.  Here are some tips though.  The most obvious is take your time!  Level doesn't matter after 100.  If anything, the added bounty for PVP is a liability.  You lose how many caps based on your level.   
---
* Wait until 50+ to complete the 'Mayor for a day quest'.  The legendary melee drop is well worth it.
---
* Work on collecting plans and recipes.  
---
* Save and build your treasure maps.  Wait until you have at least 20+.  Why?  You can get great items such as plans.  But the best part is receiving weapons and armor, which can be scrapped on mass and you can learn so many new mods for your items.
---
* Refine your S.P.E.C.I.A.L build.  Save a few levels as a buffer if you want to try new things out.  Having a buffer can easily move points about and also min max cards.
---
* Look at the atom dailies and weeklies.  Set aside some time to complete these as you never know when an item will appear in the store for a limited time that you like.  It's very anti consumer but I guess it works.
---
You will get into the groove of what to keep and what to let go.  Your endgame depends on how you play and what you want to achieve.  Amazing c.a.m.p to show off? Build a range of power armor sets for different situations?  Building your armor set when out of power armor?  Nuke farming? It really depends on play style but most people tend to lvl up for min maxing or collecting rare and sought after items.
---
I don't know about everyone else but I got rid of all my non TSE ranged weapons. What you're doing is fairly unfair, why would we carry around weapons we don't need. 
---
So, it sounds like you have to scrap torso to unlock padded?  Hoping it could be done by scrapping limbs.
---
Can't you just hold the Use button to continue consuming?
---
I finally got mine last week. After years of thinking it didn't actually work, someone said there was a small chance. 
---
I have been looking for a charging lob barrel for my two shot explosive for weeks now! 
---
The grunting miners themselves max out at 40, so that's the max they can drop...
---
There are also lots of asshats in the game 
---
Oh, please do! I'm sure the more they have of the same suggestion makes it more likely that it'll make it into the game :) 
---
Does nork on PS4, can’t say if it works on xbox. 
---
Oh good lord, I love where I'm at but I'm trying this!!! ( Looks around for heart medication)
---
Possibly people don't realize that those effects stack on top of each other. 
---
So what you're really telling me is... You didn't actually play Fallout 3?
---
try walking up the street next time
---
how did he know all my inventory contents without trading?
---
I thought this was the case at first and was disappointed when I found out it was not. 
---
As someone with 6 CHR, I have a hard time finding a good lvl. 2 card to share :/ 
---
I usually just end up sharing a lvl. 1 
---
If you ready carefully I never say it is an mmo, I say it has mmo elements but is not technically an mmo. Which it does. Things like player vendors and player trading ARE mmo elements. 
---
Hoping its patched today but if you double tap the right stick on xbox when opening a trade request it shows the other players inventory.  Nothing can be taken, but you can see what they are wearing.  Some PVPers do to size people up before attacking.
---
Run around Watoga, often see 3 star legendary bots and they just let you walk up and one shot them in the face..   
---
That really depends on a lot of factors, and idk about everyone else but I'm short perk points for everything I actually want anyway let alone points for those cards. 
---
You can learn any mod from any part. So you can learn padded from scrapping arms 
---
There was a glitch where they could see your inventory before you accept a trade
---
It worked for me, its one of those metal doors u have to use, i think the one at the bottom when u check doors. 
---
LOL- "OH, wow, awesome!!! Jet Pa....."  (((POOF))) ^(bag gone)
---
With 20 other people hitting at the same time , it's quite difficult to tell what works and what does not....
---
I don't believe ionized meat is needed to stabilize any flux
---
PC is CLEARLY better :D but fuckin a... being able to communicate with people.. what a grand idea..
---
FYI - on our superior platform, we have no way to message or communicate with anyone in the game. good job bethesda
---
There was a glitch where when you request trade from someone you could double tap right stick and it would show their inventory before they accepted. This is patched in the update today. 
---
There was no way to steal stuff. 
---
If it's a myth then why is it part of the patch notes?!
---
i would totally take the keycards and use them no lie. i hate shooting down those bots...
---
Maybe if you only use VATS Crit build, then *+50% VATS Crit dmg* affix could be better than *Exploding Bullets*. Plus, not many people go around with Fireproof and Padded Chest armor, especially low to mid levels.
---
Thanks for all the advice I appreciate it! 
---
The dog has a tail and fur, teeth, eyes,ears, it's technically a cat.
---
Thank you for noticing my point. I dont care about waving my digital cap sack in anyones face nor do i care about being downvoted. This can happen to anyone with a loot route or a mutfruit farm who just dedicated enough weekends and nights after work.
---
At this point I'm honestly not sure if it's a bug or a feature, but on PC I'm nearly always immune to radiation when I login for a minute or so. It hasn't always been like that, I think I first noticed it with last week's Jan10th patch.
---
Stealing weapons are not any part of any patch notes.
---
Viewing another players inventory is.
---
I honestly thought about it
---
Fusion cores are also ammunition for Gatling Laser and anyone using them can tell you that you can burn through cores easily. I don’t use them as laser damage seems nerfed, but I’ve heard with the right build they are great. Just making a point that there are instances where you’d want to be able to produce more cores 
---
Got actual sources for those claims?
---
Thanks for that. I F'ed up. When the installer asked where to install it, I told it the Games directory on my SSD. The installer didn't create a fallout76 directory though and it wasn't until I visited the top folder that I saw the exe file -- not named fallout76.exe but whatev.
---
Once that brain fart was resolved, I was able to install the glowing plants and the owned plans mods just fine. Really helped with the organic quest -- it wasn't very color blind friendly, rooting around in swamps full of nasties looking for a plant I had no idea what it looked like.
---
Yup, this person knows.
---
There's a base number, a "mould" if you will, from which all other copies of that object are derived.
---
Any copies do have a unique numbers assigned but the problem is any copies of the copies ALSO have unique numbers. Which is why they don't stack. Bethesda will be chasing their own tail forever if they go this route.
---
No, duping is here to stay unfortunately. The only viable solution in my mind is to introduce better weapons to negate the already duped ones and ONLY once duping cannot be done anymore.
---
...which may be a while.
---
The only thing to know really is regardless of activity or level you're always gonna need to repair your equipment. If I were you now sooner than later is make a list of absolutes like adhesive.basslistic fiber.screws.plastic etc etc you get the picture then finish your camp to how you like, then bulk sell all other resources and junk in your stash. Events/situations popup all the time when you least expect them, so load your stash will valuable resources to keep repairing/making ammo available to you for as long as possible .. concrete and acid etc aren't gonna help you by taking up stash space.
---
That's fine. Thanks for your contribution to my post!
---
Well, and I don't intend to be mean, if you are only lvl 61 you haven't done that much farming, relative to what it takes. You could easily spend another 90 lvls farming Whiterpring without getting anything worth while.
---
That said, the fastest way I've found to farm legendaries is to kill everything in the golf club, hop servers and do it again. Repeat until you get a good item or your soul becomes a burned out husk and you never want to play the game again. You'l typically get 3-5 legendaries every time you hop. Then it is just a slot-machine chance of getting a good one.
---
If I could down vote this multiple times I would. Stop complaining and go back to Roblox.
---
Game exploiting will always be a thing. Take part or don't its up to your morals.
---
This is the result of years and years of stupid people having stupid kids. They turn out, well, stupid..
---
Fair enough I still doubt they ban people for it
---
Wow that's awesome! I recently found a TS lever action and I think I'm going to start building my playstyle around it. Super fun to use
---
Any in-game mechanic depending on a random number generator tends to accrue an inordinate amount of folklore...
---
Hell yes, more jobs and the ability to setup your own shops!
---
When does it start then?
---
I'd argue that endgame DOES start at level 50 because by that level you will be able to equip and use all items. There are no higher level requirements currently than 50.
---
I found helmet armor for a dog, holing onto it just in case
---
that must've been hilarious to witness 
---
This has been my experience. 
---
What the hell is Roblox? Sorry, I don't speak edgy language.
---
"We no longer let trades occur before the requested player has consented to trade."
---
Andy, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Andy? 
---
If you've done "Mayor for a day" you're No longer flagged as hostile to the Watoga robots
---
God I hate nuking tho, I die a minimum of 3 times (usually with my own TSE gauss rifle lol)
---
No problem! Gotta love pathetic kids :)
---
They can and they will
---
Reread what you're replying to.
---
Yep
---
Yeah, I understand. I’ve seen a few good things with certain games but it’s also do you like the actual stuff they put in there. If you don’t have a record player then a record of the soundtrack may not be that interesting.
---

**Feedback** 
---
I was enjoying playing the game as a Diablo-esque loot grinder but the eventually the lack of "End Game Content" led to my friends becoming disinterested and falling off which in turn led me to putting the game down too. 
---
Currently the only realistic "end game" options are nuking Whitesprings or nuking Prime to try and fight the SBQ. The issue is that as of now the more people you have the more of a PITA in the SBQ fight is, and Whitesprings is a repetitive slog that was not returning a reasonable time to reward due to the exceedingly random nature of the loot. Once you get your fourth one handed melee weapon and third heavy weapon as a Riflemen or Unarmed it begins to feel like a waste of time. 
---
I really believe that we need to see some item sets to come into play with realistic means to try and obtain them. Some kind of goal with an end site. As is isn't working. 
---
So first off, thank you, you actually wrote a post that doesn't come off sounding like it was written by a 12 year old for a change.  Because of that, I'm happy to continue talking.
---
&gt; Says the person that is demanding Bethesda do all he bids and feels he's owed an apology.
---
Demanding?  HARDLY.  The title of the thread includes (opinion).  This whole thing was a bit of thought exercise.  Further I even concluded with the admission that I don't think it would ever happen.
---
Is the idea of a serverwipe drastic?  Yes, absolutely.  Do people lose everything, obviously.  Is the game about more than just the atom, certainly, it is, you're right about that.  Would people leave the game if it were to happen, most definitely.
---
The only thing I can tell you is that you keep talking about 'honest players' as if I weren't one, even though I've stated over and over that I am one.  As if somehow you represent the sole voice of every 'honest player' and I am the opposition.  To me this is far more entitled than anything that I've said.  I would see a fresh start as a new chance, a new start to explore, a fresh way to start over on a clean slate.
---
But I guess when playing fallout 4 (or whatever game) you've NEVER rolled a new character, eh?
---
The fact of the matter is if you've seen the screen shots on this very subreddit, seen videos on YT, you know there are people who are carrying around literally thousands of duped bobbleheads, and tens of thousands of pieces of junk, flux, gear, etc.... on one character.  In what world could a stable economy, with the upcoming addition of player trading, ever happen in that world?
---
Does the idea of a server wipe suck?  Yes, absolutely, in some regards it does.  But also, it kind of doesn't.
---
&gt; If you were also really still playing the game, you would know that the Atom shop prices have been going down ... Which was another big point in your OP. They need to listen to their player base. They clearly are. Again, if you were actually playing and paying attention, you would have seen that
---
You're taking things that I wrote out of context.  First of all, when I said the prices need to come down, the specific example I used was 1800 for power armor, and how that needed to come down by a good 90%.  That prices should be more along the lines of 180.  I do know that there have been price adjustments, but cash shop items are still on the macro level, and not micro.  That was the crux of my point, that microtransactions should be that.... micro.
---
Further, when I said they needed to listen to their fanbase it was in specific regard to NPC humans that players can interact with.  Not that they aren't listening.  As for me personally, I haven't been playing much lately.  Maybe 2 or 3 times in the last 2 weeks.  But that's due to a lot of factors, primarily the fact that most of my friends have stopped playing.  But also that recenly I was in my camp crafting when a person came into my house and oneshot me pvp with a black powder gun.  My pvp flag is turned off, they just simply came in and 1 shot me with chip damage.  Tell me, how, as an 'honest player' would that make you feel?  I've played once or twice since then, and /shrug.   But again, you've made assumptions about me that are completely unfounded and I'm not sure why you're doing that.
---
In regards to 'hearing stories' I talk to hundreds of people a month online during my twitch streams.  When I say 'heard stories' I do include them telling me first hand accounts of getting banned.  That is 1st hand, isn't it?
---
&gt; All your logic and proof and reasons all come down to the same thing. I'm right because I'm right. 
---
No, again, I need to point out that you're attributing things to me that just aren't there and I don't know where you get that entitlement.  The entire point of my thread was that this was an opinion.  A more accurate version of your statement was  "This is my opinion, what do you think?"  Which, by the way, is exactly how I ended my OP.
---
&gt; Some of use understand not everything is perfect.
---
And I would be one of those people.  There are weeks worth of VODs on my twitch page that have me defending the game against haters and people who come in and slam the game, and the one thing I must have said a hundred times or more was "Is the game perfect?  No, far from it.  But I really love playing it, and here's why...."
---
&gt; For us to be giving Bethesda a second chance, that would mean we got frustrated, left, and then decided to come back. That's not what's happening. We didn't leave.
---
YOU didn't.  And I'm also starting to realize that I am in a minority on this subreddit, of people who did lose a lot of interest in the game, but are still keeping tabs on it and still interested in it.  But whether or not you choose to accept it, there are a lot of players who did.  The problem with echochamber mentality is the mental state where you think everyone inside said echo chamber, in this case this particular subreddit, is the only opinion.  My fault, which I realize now, was coming here thinking I could start a controversial discussion and have it respected and taken seriously.  But since there were 3 replies to my OP in less than 2 minutes, including your first toxic response, I realized my mistake.  There was no way people are actually reading and thinking about what I wrote.  They skimmed, as you obviously did since I've had to restate things that were written in my OP multiple times for you, and then just reacted with vitriol.
---
&gt; No if anything your ideas would be terrible, and really hurt the game. Which is what I think you really want.
---
Far from it.  What I want to see is for this game to become great again in the gaming communities eyes, and not be an absolute laughing stock, which it currently is regardless of if you believe that or not.  When I stream FO76, my numbers drop to around 1/3rd of what they are on average for any other game.  Further my chat goes from being rather light hearted, fun, and supportive to an absolute toxic mess of people coming in, shitting on the game, and then usually leaving as I'm defending it. What I want is to see BGS put out quality content and care for their creations.  What I want is the best that this game could be, and not just 'eh it's ok'.
---
I personally love when people come to my base .I have a nice hotel and resort by whitesprings with an open crafting garage, a restaurant, and  2 bedrooms, along with a (planned) swimming pool. One time someone spent a night at the resort and it was so much fun.
---
Look at me being all kinds of helpful and +1in you! I'm so helpful and mysterious, hit me up females.
---
I have a dragon though, not TSE. And i am on Xbox
---
It happens with every bounty for me...I wonder if I didn't fast travel to collect it, it it would remain the same
---
They should see what your teammates see. It is also what you see in 3rd person. Still, it would be hard to spot if you went into sneak and made yourself a part of the environment. Good for long ranged crit sneak attacks on hostile players. 
---
Are you arguing on my side now? Thanks. Sounds like we think the same thing but you wanna be mad about it. It’s NOT an MMO (a cat) but with MMO (dog) elements. So why are you arguing with me about this?
---
Do their level decrease if I do Mayor for a Day?
---
The pitch-fork has a better range. Super-mutant not stupid.
---
Yeah, I dunno if it was One Drive for you, but sometimes One Drive confuses me. Some files go automatically to identically looking One Drive folders and others to systems standard folders.
---
What you see is what they see, I have tested it now as I wasn’t sure before but, can confirm, the more chameleon pieces you have equipped the more “invisible” you become. 
---
How about you go read those patch notes again. Right below that part about viewing inventories. 
---
Okay, someone didn't take his nap today!
---
&gt; I have never had more D/C's and crashes.
---
I doubt that has anything to do with the patch. Everyone has had dcs and crashes the whole time. Any perceived uptick is likely coincidental.
---
T-51b is my go to...but that is because I love Nuka Cola so much.
---
Don't need nukes, just kill the normal ones.
---
Unless you need to farm gears, black titanium, nuclear material, rubber, or steel in which case it's *amazing*. I've walked out with 30+ gears multiple times
---
Go have your nap then! Dont wait for my permission.
---
It's totally possible to do it on your own! You just have to wait for the keyword to start showing up in the enclave bunker. We solve it when 0 letters of the keyword is known. This makes it a little more difficult. Https://nukacrypt.com/how has a short outline on how to decrypt them if you need help:)
---
Frack. One can only hope that B can find a way to remove duped items, fix the servers from reacting to it, or come up with something for the problem to not affect legit players.
---
Yeah, the atmosphere is getting tainted with the Post-Xmas players...  Beta Players remember how friendly and welcoming everyone was at the start.  Something somewhere has gone dark, and I feel bad when I read stories like the trap above.  The wedding makes me have hope though.
---
you might have built on a spawn point. where my camp is i get occassional scorched from a nearby location and rarely wandering wolves, but the fences keep them at turret range. haven't seen a molerat there once.
---
Was there a bang and was it it I-T IT?
---
Oh okay, didn’t know that plain Whitesprings would have that many legendaries
---
You don't even need to nuke in OP's suggestion, though. You just go to Whitesprings golf clubhouse and you will typically find 1 to 3 legendary ghouls in there. Just stand outside the front door and mow them down as they come out.
---
Inspirational when farming xp I'd say.
---
I got an an explosive 50 mm and it is awesome, I’m a casual player and its really the best thing that has really ever dropped. Lots of crap but it kinda makes it more of a special item to me,
---
You are so triggered this is starting to get embarrassing... *laughs nervously*
---
I'm replying to the correct thread. This is the patch note I'm referring to. The note doesn't say the requesting player, it says the requested player. Seems to me that people are somehow forcing trades without the consent of the person who's item has been requested.
---
I just use garage doors.. i'd love to play with powered doors but i haven't found them on Graham yet :/
---
Nope, still level 50. It's worth leaving it til post-50 anyway to maximise the reward (quest rewards scale to the level you finish a quest at)
---
Right. It absolutely says "fixed weapon stealing" and not something else. You're absolutely correct.
---
I just thought it was SUPER coincidental that there was both a guy running around saying he got stolen from and a guy running around spamming trades
---
So I think it is the damage done while you are attacking. For instance, with the queen, I know my hvy guns do damage, but last light we killed the queen in less than 5 min (thanks to some lvl 210+ using melee build) and the grey bar kept jumping but remained there until I stopped firing. I'm assuming this was when he was hitting the queen. 
---
\- Always clear the shooting range at Sons of Dane for plenty of cans (steel &amp; lead) and metal containers.
---
\- If you claim Grafton Steel (and the server doesn't drop you) at the beginning of your farming session, you can produce steel &amp; lead as you go farm even more stuff. Plus, there's usually Super Mutants around with even more ammo.
---
\- Drop your camp on a deposit for even more background production. Mine sits precariously on a lead deposit... on a cliff. It can be troublesome since I don't always spawn-in on top of the ledge.
---
Now you are diving into creepy asterisk territory.
---
Ouch
---
Rad sponge in nuke zones, I usually share either helping hands or aquaperson. My friends called me stupid for making aqualad a main perk card then I shared it and they love it. But helping hands is one of the best, everyone gets heals.
---
I have my camp  up by Monogah Substantion MZ-01. A level 96 with some pimp power power armor can to my camp and visited my wife and me. We're both low 20s.  He drops a couple bags with outfits, purified water and some other goodies for us and starts shooting a tree which I surmised was him asking us to follow him.  Always tough to know when they're aren't mic'd up.  Anyway, he leads us no more than 15 seconds away and he has constructued a wonderful camp with a breathtaking view just north of the Sunnytop Ski Lanes.  
---
That's fine. Good talk!
---
I did notice there was a copious amount of ghouls there last time I was around, and I’ll try even though I didn’t see any legendaries!
---
You could:
---
* Jump servers and get away.
---
* Repair your CAMP.
---
* See it as an opportunity to build something else, somewhere else.
---
Your CAMP doesn't necessarily need to be your "forever home."  You could make it into a general store or crafting center.  You could make a trap house with it.  The possibility that your CAMP can be destroyed always exists - whether it's another player, a wayward Scorchbeast, or I'd imagine in some cases even a server problem.
---
This has been posted about before but the last post included a map, I shall upload said map [here](https://imgur.com/a/KICePUb) for anyone who wants a visual diagram.  
---
(I did **not** make this map I just saved it from a real MVP a few weeks back)
---
I'm saying you're wrong about that interpretation and if you aren't then find proof.
---
I can show you how to make someone's items disappear. Are you on console pre-patch and have a buddy nearby?
---
Sorry I was arguing against you. See my comment, it IS hard to NOT notice that you’re close to the limit.
---
reminds me of when a guy was harassing me and my brother at a Workshop. he was high up on the cliffs so while my brother held him off in a sniper battle i snuck around and shotgunned him in the back.
---
I'm sure if you click on the C.A.M.P it gives you the option to repair all. 
---
Can confirm people are dicks on xbox, speaking as someone who has had my base leveled for no reason at all dude just felt like being an ass i suppose.
---
It wasent a good talk though and we both know it.
---
I wish you had the option to tag the bag with something. 
---
Like a balloon (could use the same model from the ones inside vault 76) 
---
Or maybe a bow or something. 
---
Idk the bag in general was a poor choice for dropped loot. 
---
Not all of us do! I was skeptical of both 4 and 76 on launch, but choose to form my own opinions by actually playing the game myself rather than letting biased reviewers tell me what to think
---
That's okay. 
---
I've seen this too playing PC and console. Don't know if its an older crowd or b/c PCs cost more, or because PC culture has evolved some sort of etiquette from years of online games but PC online always seems to have less toxic players and more vengeance on greifers. 
---
Oh okay, so maybe I’ll wait until 70 or 80? Or does post 50 bot affect legendary spawn rates
---
I thought I was doing something wrong. I mean my camo is just at the begining near the vault and I get ignores by most people lol. The ones that do visit just wave and leave.
---
I.... I... I.. think so
---
They hide in there. You have to check both sides upstairs, then go downstairs and out back. There is usually a wendigo in the locker room.
---
Dang. You're like me.
---
Will be bookmarking this for reference.
---
A gotta good dopamine rush yesterday at staples from their clipboard selection. 
---
You have plans for building turrets for a reason.
---
Can't figure this one out on your own?
---
I want the two minutes of my life from reading this post back...
---
Got it, thanks!
---
Only 30 seconds, if I could be so lucky
---
Still on the hunt for some decent weapons and armour. Melee build, currently the best I have is the 2 star All Rise Hammer I got as a quest reward and a 1 star axe a buddy gave me.
---
Tried fighting the queen recently, gave up as I do no damage with either of them. Progress is kinda on hold till I randomly find something godly. 
---
I guess you completely missed the point, doesn't matters, i said what i had to say.Cheers.
---
Or you can go up to the wall or object and hit repair on it.
---
You know what would fix this whole issue?
---
- Disallow effect stacking of bobbleheads.  If you consume a different one, your previous one gets voided out.
---
- Change explosive ammo to not be affected by Demolition Export.  The perk card would only affect grenades (as one would expect).
---
No need to remove weapons or any other items in the game, just make them less Godly, and therefore, less valuable.  The result - it's not quite as lucrative to dupe.  Interest in these activities will drop, as folks will get bored, and we all reap the benefits of more stable servers to play on.
---
I know that. I just dont know why you feel the need to pretend this was a friendly exchange when you very early on began insulting me personally.
---
I hope they fixed exploding bullets for consoles. 
---
" **Weapons**: Fixed an issue that would sometimes cause  plasma weapons, flamers and flamer mods, and weapons with explosive  bullet mods to not do damage to other players and creatures. "
---
This is still an issue on PC after the Jan 10 patch.
---
that only repairs broken structures, things that are partially damaged do not get repaired
---
no shortage of them? this genre hasn't existed  long and there really isn't that many of them, especially on console.  For consoles, the only other options are Ark, Conan exiles, 7 days to die, and the forest.  If you don't want dinosaurs or zombie theme, then that just leaves conan exiles which has no guns.  And i only found out about those games because i bought fallout 76.  Fallout 76 literally exposed me to the open world survival genre.  Using your logic, "You should go play single player games instead"
---
People commonly buy and sell Furious melee and rapid fire guns. 
---
I've got the camo paint on my X01 and can confirm that you can switch it back. 
---
Ban them yeah, if bethesda wanted to they could absolutely ban a bunch of these dupers.
---
Sueing them is virtually impossible, and a complete waste of money though.
---
thaf you surely acquired legitimately :/
---
Try clicking on the Google Sheets link directly (instead of the Excel file) and it will prompt you to make a copy and open it in Google Sheets, which should show workbook with all the different tabs (sheets) across the bottom of the screen.
---
You can still do critical damage while not in vats i believe, it's just random, like sometimes one of my shots do more damage than another even while hitting the same limb, but I cant be sure since it's just my experience
---
I see clipboards in real life and all I can think are scrapping them for springs.
---
yeah that's a solid suggestion overall. 
---
The only person I play with is my level (140) and we don't really care much about EXP anymore though. 
---
Could be useful when/if we are trying to respec some points or try a new build though. 
---
too bad I already have lvl. 3 inspirational lol 
---
gonna have to take it a couple more times 
---
Are you using cats or scopes
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag9j5s/psa_the_trade_glitch_getting_patched_shortly/
---
Maybe that will clear it up?
---
There is no endgame!
---
Also fair, though you nevef stated that in your post
---
What?
---
So it did duplicate the floor and door and walls but also took away budget for each of the 5.  I didn't get back any budget that was glitched. :(
---
Well judging by this post, I guess the servers are down...
---
Fool, best way to trade is by dropping on the ground.
---
No one sees your inventory.
---
Yeah Rad sponge is a solid one, but my duo partner always shares it. 
---
I usually share strange in numbers since we both have a lot of mutations. 
---
For supporting the president? 
---
Out for a walk with time on my hands 😂😂😂😂
---
I lay down all sexy like next to the bag. I didn't know that players can see you pose in camera mode so I lay down randomly behind people on couch's beds and  seduce them into gifts .

So much this! I tried giving a lvl 25 and lvl 5 about 20 plans/recipes and a 3* lvl25 pitchfork last night.. They just kept backing away from me hesitantly. They'd return my emotes, but wouldn't come close enough to see or get the camouflaged brown paper bag. I tried shooting at the bag to get their attention, forgetting I had my TSE handmade attached. After blowing myself up, they just ran away.. smh
---
Strange... pc got a server side patch just the other day. I've noticed a lot less issues since. Soooooo guess what. These bundled the client side and server side into 1 downtime for you instead of two. 
---
And if you kill enough of them they seem to get pissed and send a group of gutsys and the odd assaultron after you and they normally have at least one 3★ legendary if not more 
---
The perk doesn't say, but yes it does. Classic Bethesda
---
Man, radial wheel is great! I'm on xbox and it's great. Maybe just git gud? 
---
I hate hearing about human being jerks. PC, Xbox, or PS? I’m curious if one platform has more greiffing than the others. 
---
Westteck is a good place. Plenty of super mutants
---
It wasn't removed by mods. Lol. Also nothing wrong with supporting my president. 
---
Untill they are back up.
---
Do you happen to know if you can use super duper + chemist while crafting stable flux to triple results? My brother asked me but I just used super duper and forgot to equip chemist while doing so.
---
Imagine a world where you sent via pm said location of your base as the technology needed to view the interactive map on my device is just beyond my grasp. The possibilities of what could be are endless. The future is unknown, but, with your assistance, a bright and loot filled adventure awaits.
---
tldr: Can't view the map. Phone sucks. 
---
Thanks😂
---
Someone has already decoded the location information and has a site up that does that. See https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/af36oq/fallout76items_map_updated/ for more details. The direct link to the map is: https://saor-gaming.co.uk/Fallout76Items/
---
It's the terms of service for the game. Dupers and other cheats violate the ToS and deserve the ban hammer.
---
No similarities. The Nazi party no longer exists and they killed millions...
---
I also had some person's camp turret attack me for no reasons. I was not wanted and was not in pvp but that 1 turret decided it hated me.
---
I see something that looks like that but I tends to be just in far off windows. Never seen it up close or permanently. 
---

---
Lol shouldn't be more than a couple hours based on past patches.
---
So just like in FO4. Glad I went after getting my five piece set again. Finally finished it the other day and had a spawn into a group of 5-6 scorched and they just walked right by me. Even stopping next to me a few times. Felt good to say to myself "I can kill you right now and you dont even know Im here." Lol
---
I was on the fence about it, but gave in and installed it anyway. The facts that this feature is basic quality of life, should have been in the game at launch, and Bethesda has said *nothing* to acknowledge it... the fault for its existence is on them. If I get a ban I'll happily submit my essay on why it's a necessary function in the game. If BGS genuinely cares that much, they should reach out to the mod author to incorporate his work into a future patch.
---
Fix mutations and perk cards that compliment. Class freak doesn't work sometimes. And when a friend leaves team while we have strange in numbers on, it's like you become normal playing solo. You have to take Strange off just for the mutations to work again it seems. 
---
FWIW, I'm only level 52, but I've gotten most of my good stuff just from randomly adventuring, vs. farming events or nuke zones. I've found that Events are typically good for getting the basic healing / medical supplies, a miscellaneous plan and a quest you know you can do in 5 to 15 minutes for 300 EXP, but the other gear usually isn't top notch. 
---
Try going to some areas you haven't explored yet, that you don't see any active players in. This should cause a "fresh" spawn of monsters close to your level, and usually at least one legendary in the batch. Plus, you then get all of the junk in the area. 
---
At 200h myself, my best find has been a 1* TS Black Powder Rifle that dropped out in the wild. It made a big difference at the time when I found it and I still carry it on me all the time. 
---
How are people building camps like this?  Any time I’ve tried to place mine near a bridge, building, etc, I get an error message saying cannot place camp near existing structure. What am I doing wrong?!  Xbox user 
---
They only have an American flag and no other countries flag and no one seems to care.
---
I saw a dead deer on the side of the road and my first thought was, "Meat!"
---
Yes! 
---
I mean...You *are* on the FO76 reddit... 
---
Those enhancements are for vats .. outside of vats you will notice jumps in damage from time to time not because it's a crit but either because it damaged a limb or it was a sneak attack.
---
Turns out after doing some reading, unless your under the influence of a chem that increases critical hit chance, crits are not possible outside of vats, note that this is only if fallout 76 retains the exact same vats and critical system fallout 4 did
---
I've seen unusual amounts of ammo jump like that sometimes. 
---
Don't worry. You're not getting banned for taking ammo off of a robot, I promise. 
---
Well... sometimes it's not exactly your choice where the server decides to disconnect. 😂
---
Loud and clear lil buddy
---
Pc and ps4 here, and because i've just moved house i'm playing on tethered 4G. Maybe two or three disconnects at most prepatch.
---
Currently at level 85, I'm more of an explorer, but have done a fair amount of Blast Zone Farming, as well as Event Farming for Legendary stuff.
---
I would guess that I have acquired around 600-700 legendary items to date, with Only about 5 of them being God Role Weapons.
---
My methods are different than most, I am a Stealth/Sniper Build Character, and frequently sneak around the Legendary Spawning areas Cherry Picking only the Legendary &amp; Boss Enemies.
---
I also participate in the Uranium Fever Event every chance I get, which is where I have gotten my best Drops, so my advice to everyone is Keep Grinding for that .5% chance to get something truly legendary, and Sell, Trade, and Barter for the special weapons you want, unless you are lucky enough to find just what you're looking for. 
---
Increasing your budge is easy, but you have to use the security door to do it.
---
But if you actually want to “fix” your stored items budget, you’ll need to dismantle and scrap your entire camp.  Every item till all you have left is the CAMP module. Wait a minute then quit the game. Once you come back you should have 100% of your budget available.
---
I’ve had this problem myself twice, and this fixed the t both times.
---
Better hope that cream wasn't radioactive or diseased.
---
You just lost 9 karma i believe
---
Well the game takes place in america.

If they're on your team they can see you as you see yourself with a nametag above your head.  If not on your team, they barely see you at all and no nametag.  As far as I can tell.
---
Two shot exp should be nerfed across the board..way to op.  
---
Now wait for the youtube video that does exactly this.
---
Actually this is now false as of three patches ago.   Some fine Redditors have actually done the math and posted the results.  All the bulk items provide a small but appreciable savings in weight now.
---
We wouldn't boycott the game if the put in a I'm with her hat, as long as they put a similar hat for us. That way there is no bias.
---
I am a high level but I have a few friends I could distribute it to.
---
(Enemy spotted) time to take off our clothes and punch this fucker
---
I still can’t get rid of my industrial water purifier 
---
Treasure maps do not give Legendaries FYI
---
Is this also true for learning upgrades like polymer, fiberglass etc?
---
....exactly.
---
They’ll be up within the next 2 days or 48 hours to be more specific 
---
My preference is for the T-51b, for two reasons:
---
1. It’s incredibly iconic. The helmet has been the emblem of the Fallout series forever.
---
2. It’s the only armor that can use the Nuka Cola paint.
---
However, in terms of “best overall performance” I’d say that goes to the T-60. Cheap to repair, and a good mix of physical and radiation resistance.
---
I found it on a table, top floor of fort defiance. Probably a chance spawn. 
---
I've done that.  I have nothing built and nothing in "Stored" tab.  Still shows 89% stored.  
---
Maybe they patched it
---
Thank you for not crowbaring in "reeee Bethesda are evil/dead game/scam game/hate hate hate"
---
I'm sorry the game didn't work out for you, and hope you enjoy whatever you move on to more &lt;3
---
Yes, they used to be scarce, just like TVs or cars.  Then thanks to advanced manufacturing techniques and underhanded business practices, theyre now cheap enough that most people own at least one.
---
And it isnt the american flag we have, it's an alternate timeline flag
---
Of all the fallout I have played over the years, I have never made a heavy guns build. I think with the massive availability of fusion cores I might go for it...
---
Is your Xbox name the same as Reddit account? I'll add you if you want to be our medic!
---
Is build budget the same for all levels like stash is? 
---
I got stuck under a tent while wearing PA.  Not enough room to exit my armor so I had to fast travel out.
---
Well, a couple days ago, I logged in and got a massive dose of Rads from out of nowhere (like +50 Rads for a few seconds).  Consequently, I got Marsupial, so it worked out pretty well.  But if there is some safeguard, it's not a consistent one.
---
Odd... as Ive not used VATS for ages... havent had Overdrive running... and the other days I got an Atom Reward for 76/76 crits.    
---
      
---
Explain that.    
---
I've regularly seen 500 5mm on super mutants and numbers similar to what your saying on sentry bots it's nothing you'll get in trouble over.
---
It may be, but the 2 star level 40 furious explosive western revolver I got from it is awesome!
---
True but like I said, it's an atom shop tem. Not all the Atom Shop items make since in the game.
---
Pops here, 
---
Owner of a small shop, been trading since the beta. Not once has anyone ever stolen anything from me, nor have I had this happen to me. 
---
Most of the time my character is fully stocked with weapons, armor, serums, and what have you that I get out of my stash to sell when my shop is open. Plenty of things people would want, plenty of items worth a high amount of caps. Never had anything stolen. 
---
I always know what items I have on me at all times. I do this because I don't dupe, so the items I have are hard for me to come across and therefore worth a great amount to me till I sell them. Again, when I return whatever wasn't sold back into my stash I am never missing anything. 
---
The only way I could see this occurring is by accident. There has been a few times when I was setting a price for an item that someone requested, when all of a sudden the item I was setting a value on changed. The reason for this, is while I'm setting a price, the potential buyer requested another item,making me accidentally click something else. This is user error, not a glitch or method to steal items. 
---
Best way to avoid this from occurring, is to allow your potential buyer to peruse your wares completely before setting a value to items. Let them request everything they want, then put a value to caps. Now, if its a straight trade, item for item, then have a middle man to prevent someone from reducing their item down to Zero. I do this method when selling ammo. A lot of people like to do the whole "Buy one bullet for the agreed price" then fail to give the rest. 
---
Reddit has middlemen on here that help with that. If not, I have plenty of trader friends that are willing to help. Usually they charge a small fee of twenty caps to be middlemen. 
---
Not sure why this response got so winded. In summary, user error, not glitch or exploit. 
---
10-4
---
Then maybe random criticals are a thing, I wish they'd bring back the notification of critical hits and crippled limbs like fallout 3 and new vegas
---
Only thing they could change with minimal effort would be the refresh rates of enemies in different areas.
---
Oh no! How will I feed my family now! My precious virtual points...
---
Ok, but like I said. It isnt as easy as you make it sense you have to deal with ALL the other contries that play this game, not just americans. Is it really that hard to understand?
---
Never tested it, but it should. Though I imagine there has to be a cap on the dmg increase, or at the very least, a point of diminishing returns, and I simply haven't tested enough to see it.
---
Whats our vector victor?
---
But it could be from sneak attacks which count as critical hits, so keep that in mind 
---
Sometimes it's just the server catching up.
---
Only thing i would avoid is large numbers of grenades on super mutants. I have lost like 20lb of carry weight to invisible grenades
---
Yes. Any material or mod that has a Learn Chance can be learned by scrapping any armor piece in that set. You have to learn Polymer three times though, once for arms, once for legs, and once for torso.
---
Same when I see pack of logs everywhere man..
---
Keep an eye on there Twitter feed for updates. They will post when back on. Few hours most likely.  Have a good one
---
This game suffers greatly from a lack of information. A damage log would also be nice. 
---
I found it on a boat near the Charleston Station.  It was in the dried up river and had a cooking station and a level 3 safe.
---
Kinda like this one, right?
---
He could be indeed, but back before any dupe fixes, there were even more dupers and TSEs to be bought. If you were mainly *merching* on Fallout 76, you had an option to turn your max Caps into TSE through trading or use alts. If TSEs were a lot cheaper, you could easily generate dozens of shotguns. They also were easy to sell due to popularity. Very likely to be a duper, imo.
---
They do? 
---
Is any of them willing to play stealth sniper? I'm wearing a weightless armor, it's not that fancy but it's nice to start with. :) Got a chameleon serum as well.
---
I have my own story. So a few days ago I finally tamed a deathclaw after 4 hrs of grinding. After 30 minutes it finally got back to my camp and I was ecstatic. I got me own guard dog now feller. While I was at the Ammo Plant, I noticed a group of 3 people heading towards my base. I remembered a post I recently read sayings take caution because groups of 3 heading to a CAMP may be going to destroy your home. I switched my game mode to passive so my Deathclaw wouldn’t die and fast traveled all the way there. I somehow made it before them and made friends with them. They were levels 8, 19, and 21 (when I saw this at first I thought they had explosives). I brought them back to my base (we were speaking on game chat) and they completely freaked out when they say Fluffy. The level 8 was running away, 19 with him, and the 21 stayed and tried to fight. I thought it was funny I played along they attacked it but they didn’t do damage and they were getting so mad. Eventually I told them I tamed it and they got so mad. They lost half or all their ammo trying to kill it honestly their reactions were to good to make up: the level 21 broke his controller the level 19 screamed into his mic. The lower level didn’t do anything he just stood their silent. Remind me to do this again this is too pure
---
I was reading the recent patch notes (considering that PS4 is currently down for maintenance) and I see this:
---
Crafting: Lowered chance of Power Generators of spawning fusion cores.
---
What exactly does this relate to? Later in the notes it states that some generators were fixed back up to 8/hr, so did spawning go up or down?
---
IGN: Zurg321 
---
I'm a Level 56 i can make use of your gear if your still plan on leaving. i will not waste your gear. 
---
i wont be on till later this evening if you don't mind waiting. if you got steam you can just add me now Zurg321 with the One punch Avatar :). 
---
Instead, I'll blame boring shallow people.
---
So things can't be alike but not the same? 
---
One definitely would :)
---
idk about stuck but I take random damage, like I stubbed my toe or some shit. Seems to happen more in power armor now that I think on it. 
---
That’s not always the case. I have several walls that are partially damaged and it does not give me to option to repair them. I’m not sure if that is a bug or if the repair option is only activated at a certain damage threshold. 
---
You gave me the opportunity to quote Patton and I took it.
---
Indeed they do, like criticals in vats(not including crit damage enhancing perks), sneak attacks do 2x damage just like a critical
---
Wew that’s quite a hard thing to do. You’d need to hold off launching a nuke until you get an extremely powerful weapon and stack bobble heads. Which seems like quite the feat to accomplish this.
---
Xbox here I have maybe 2-3 disconnects a week and the most. most I played was 8 hours this weekend due to the snow storm with no problems whatsoever.
---
If it's a named/map marker location it is generally locked away (though some places, like substations, allow access just fine). This is just some semi-random high voltage tower; Note that I can't get much more inland (If I wanted to build on the road, for example) because of the nearby Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm workshop.
---
Better then nothing :)
---
You might have already gotten it and completed it, but I have a MISC quest that is something like, "Kill 10 feral golfers at Whitesprings." So, I'm guessing that's why there is always a healthy supply of ghouls there, along with the fact that a bunch of players are always in the area, causing new monsters to spawn in. 
---
like half of any given play session is spent afking at my camp while i get up to do laundry or cook and i have never had anyone go out of their way to stalk my map marker and come shoot my shit up. i've had exactly one person try to be an asshole and he got as far as breaking one whole wall before i shrugged and left the server. i've had so many more people just wave or drop stuff randomly.
---
last time i had a visitor, i was on a low level alt and transferring plans to it from my mule account. dude dropped two power armor chassis with some low level parts on them. people are fucking nice in this game.
---
This game has barely any persistence and nothing you do matters so nah, it's fine 
---
Bad times
---
Sure, you can add on me on. IGN: NoRest4Wicked
---
Might take a few months 🙃
---
No new enemies? Or guns huh? You didn't play the game or blatently just don't care or fact check anything you wrote.
---
This is exactly the question I'm trying to ask, do sneak attacks count as criticals.  I'm going to edit my OP.
---
If you ever plan on having powered doors throughout your camp you will want to use the pressure switch. 
---
Door is closed. Stand on switch. Door opens. Get off switch and walk through door. Door closes. 
---
It sucks. I managed to swipe around 10k quantum cola from a duper container last week. Died about 20 times from rads drinking them before the game glitched and let me fast travel back to my camp despite being overencumbered. Then I was able to stand in my decon shower and drink the rest. Took forever, game crashed several times during the process too.
---
Such a trigger for me that I see damaged walls and cant fix them until they break...I would gladly spend the resources just so I didn't have to see the health bar 3/4 of the way down every time I walk past my front wall.... like honestly getting triggered now just thinking about it.
---
^ Correct. Ionized meat is not needed for stabilization. 
---
Squad maneuvers is a 2 cost card and almost like a free additional speed demon
---
This is an interesting theory.  Wonder if console games are more toxic then PC.  Both have some horrible trolls.
---
Text chat(in pipboy) would work as matchmaking, and be fantastic in so many ways. 
---
The bag needs to be bright colored, or lit up in some way. If you had a miner hat with a bright light on it, you could light the bag. These developers are either doing this on purpose, or they’re not smart. Did they play this game? Do they play it? If so, then they know. Why are they changing it?
---
Yes, It's CareBears and CryBabies.   
---
People who hate non-consensual PvP (CareBears) and people who love it (CryBabies).
---
I got you dude. You make a good point but the game is all about America being awesome and China and communists being bad so I would say more American stuff is ok.
---
Right but they are not defined as crits though.. else they would benefit from both Ninja/Covert Op AND Better Criticals. 
---
I can get annoying but it is fun to jump in front of them and watch them melt.
---
I like the idea of a balloon! I kinda want to stand outside vault 76 with party poppers waiting for new players to come out and give them a big welcome! 
---
Great ideas. Would love to see 76 have an expansion added. It really feels like it's necessary. With the map so big, locations feel scarce, need more to explore lol. And an actual quest to follow instead of go find this listen then find that listen. We really need the NPC interaction I think. Plus just imagine seeing a wanted player in game get demolished by a npc settlement. would be pretty damn funny. Praying for Bethesda to see this. Their mini vault DLCs will be cool but a whole new map to check out is even better 😎👏
---
And this is why there needs to be some kind of text chat on pc. Console users have the ability to reach out to other players because of their platform, but pc players don't really have any recourse unless they get the person to join Discord or something. Makes stuff like this much less likely to happen. :/
---
This one doesn't appear to be removed. Unless I'm missing something.
---
Have you tried scanning and repairing your files, sometimes that makes all the difference to the stability of your experience. 
---
Yeah, it was just the jump that caught my attention.
---
This strikes me as someone who’s never played the game.
---
Now I want to be your evil twin and create an exact replica of your camp and help people with their needs.
---
EXCEPT. Once I have their trust Ill drop them into a hidden burning pit and rig a switch that changes the "Therapist" sign into a "The Rapist" sign.
---
What's happening next week that would cause Bethesda to start banning for mods?
---
Or you can spend 30 secs to switch server.
---
Not OP but it has happened to me a few times personally, but I usually have enough time to open up my pipboy and jump into my power armor before I die of radiation
---
I did not know that happens in pacifist mode, that seems ridiculous to me. I mean it’s so easily done as well 
---
This is why I've pretty much stopped playing. I like exploring, I like crafting, I don't like grinding mobs endlessly, so there is no way for me to really participate in the gear progression, which isn't a very good system to begin with given that the items are either brokenly overpowered or completely worthless, not a smooth progression curve like literally hundreds of other games demonstrate.
---
Damn slap an mirv mod on that baby
---
Not a level 50, but just curious: 
---
why are you leaving? 
---
Not to say there's no reason to, but I like to ask what people are specifically fed up with enough to outweigh any fun being had with the game. 
---
Monster Hunter Doot Hammer intensifies
---
I keep a Bearproof Trash Can outside my place so people can access their stash.
---
Lovely build and location :)
---
Seen that happen too its nothing but some fucky coding probably also see 8 to 16 frags on enemies some days.....then the real inventory pops up 😆
---
Well, if I'm being honest, I'm not entirely sure, but in the end, sneak attacks do double damage, just as a crit would, so maybe it doesnt count as a crit, but it has the same function
---
That’s amazing! I’m dying! 
---
I've had my base attacked by teams of griefers multiple times. I've never had a wanted bounty and avoid pvp yet I've had my base razed twice. When I get a couple people rolling up to my camp acting shady I just hop servers. Sadly it's not paranoid...
---
The difficulty curve increases sharply once you get to the "top of the world " quests. I would get to 35-40 before you proceed with those unless you are playing with a friend or looking for an ultra hard challenge. 
---
Exactly. However I on the other hand am paranoid on a different level I realise when you say you are not n game when doing laundry and stuff. I mean if I am going to piss I log of just to prevent I get thirsty lol. 
---
I don’t think the Scorched plague would be able to get to the brain since it’s encased in glass surrounded with liquid.
---
This mod will help you uncover what you already know in-game. When looking at a plan in a trade/transfer window, it will show you if you know it or not. https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/214
---
Does the paint only work on T-51 or will it work on T-45 and T-60?
---
My wife's camp is within seconds of yours--a bit closer to the workshop and Summersville.  I think we have to move because the super mutant spawns in Summersville are constantly sniping the camp.
---
Super mutants just love crushing all my mutfruit
---
Lead belly gets rid of the rad problem. 
---
So conclusion.. Just dont trade with other players.  Be a supermutant and be hateful towards humans.... I wish i could be a supermutant.. Find... Kill... Loot
---
The problem is, there never was a president trump in the fallout universe. And thus has literally nothing to do with anything in the game. The atom store might not make sense some times, but it's at least consistent. You see stuffed radstags, not stuffed deer. If they did anything for presidents day it would be about fallout presidents, not real worl ones. 
---
SAXTON HAAAAALE!
---
Nothing. I just don't want my current character to sport Brotherhood iconography. I have a separate Brotherhood of Steel heavy guns character I plan to work on later.
---
Oh sorry for the delay, but I do understand that, hence my comment on the virus :)  It's plausible, it's just that the timing is ... interesting.  I also feel like we could see human NPCs introduced in the future very easily based on the lore so far.
---
Nope. I am getting my assassin set and I will be out of caps. So, if game aint offering any challenges, Ill will make my own then. Ill be attacking every base and every workshop I see. 
---
I'd post a picture but servers are down it's fun to get the no emote and the confused emote. Like the cat Alice in wonderland I just lay around to confuse people.
---
Just got bethesda launcher for this game. Didn't even know that was an option. Hell, the game browser is un-resizeable and I can barely see enough of the "Play" button to click it. i'll dig around
---
It’s krypto 
---
Armor and weapons have the same stats for anything 100% durability and below.
---
At 101% durability and above armor gets inreased ballistic/physical armor with no change to energy damage resist/armor. 
---
As for weapons, it's hit and miss, a lot of melee weapons get some increase in damage, things like the ripper with a super-fast attack speed get a massive increase in damage.  
---
The ranged weapons I've tried seem to not get any damage increases.
---
Somewhere between 99.9 and 100% of the two show explosive weapons on Reddit, etc are duped weapons.  If it wasn't for duping none of these weapons would be on the market for sale, there would be no reason to sell them for anything other than real money, the coins in the game are extremely easy to obtain and are effectively worthless.  On your offer everyone is overflowing with crap legendaries, simpacks, and t-51 spawns all over the map for free, wasn't excepted likely because the items have no value.
---
I only got 76 because my bff wanted us to play it together. 
---
She has played significantly more hours than me because she's retired and I have a full time job, but she has actually played the main quests, explored, etc. You know, played the actual story.
---
By contrast, I'm more or less obsessed with CAMPing so I made my way to White Springs before she did because I wanted access to Studio 58's plans. Once there I discovered the delight of going on ghoul murder sprees and that went double for farming it once nuked. I pretty quickly went from being three levels behind her to more than ten levels ahead of her. Most of her good weapons have been gifts from me - gotten from drops at White Springs. 
---
Oh! And she's more coordinated than me and generally a better player, so while she created a rifle build early on I went pure melee, to compensate for my poor coordination with the controllers. So yeah, I'm accidentally over powered compared to her, too.
---
Yep, it's like this with pretty much every Bethesda game. It becomes super obvious in older titles if you use a mod like Dust or Frost where loot is drastically reduced
---
my favorite popcorn popper!
---
I’ll definitely not rush anything 
---
Oh i wish we were on the same platform. This sounds lovely.
---
If that worked it would be awesome but majority of the players are above 50, instead of putting it to luck having a choice wouldn’t hurt either
---
Yeah that happened to me yesterday. Logged in to be instant killed by a nuke at white springs. You can't blame the game though it's just bad luck. Like others have said log off outside of hotspots or just respawn, get into power armour, get your stuff and join the fun
---
I think people have said "Make America Great Again" before President Trump but you make a very good point.

if you are specced into range and not into much building your camp (only basic needs) AND you are not gonna craft many weapons for mods, then keep every resource on 2 bulked, except for lead and steel. allways keep any lead you have and keep steel to about 6-8 bulked (unless you have mods uninstalled, then unbulk it). loot any gunpowder you come across and you shouldnt have problems with bullets (and use ammosmith and superduper when crafting it).
---
Yes that guy was a duper, BUT many players have multiple characters. If they have a bunch of 1 weapon they are a duper. If they have 1 of everything they *could* be a duper, but also could be a high level player/trader.
---
My second character holds all my goodies that cant be held on my main character. Most high level players are doing this with the help of a friend. My character is level 15 with 750 lbs of max level legendary items, all acquired legit. 
---
no new enemies since level 5. 
---
If you can manage it, try leveling up to 50 before starting the different quests lines; do events and explorations.  
---
I think I have read (somewhere on reddit) that if you do that, you will get better rewards.
---
Did you just watch a YouTube video and pretend to play the game?
---
Thanks I really appreciate your response and your input.  At this point I have about 60 hours into the game (guessing because I don't know of a way to show actual game hours played) so I doubt they will give me a refund.  I am still enjoying the game although I have daily problems and issues.  Lately my game is consistently crashing with the CE-##### error (can't remember the error code) which causes whatever items I have recently acquired to disappear.  Also for me about 25% of the game is managing food and water and another 25% or so is managing inventory and weight limits.  I have read forum and forum post with users saying 600 cap is more than enough and I don't know what I am doing but I am always hitting the limit even with scrapping everything and then converting it to bulk.  The junk or raw materials aren't really the problem, its everything else.  I just don't see me ever being able to use a heavier weapon like a missile launcher, mini nuke launcher or minigun just because of the weight limit.  Just picking up the missile launcher and having 3-4 missiles is almost 30 points of weight.  I am not arguing with this weight, I am arguing against the limit of my camp.  Why can't I store as much as I want in my own location?  As I mentioned in my post I would even be agreeable to a smaller stash limit if I need to move locations but a larger limit if I stay put.
---
I have been a long time Fallout fan, I played Wasteland back in the 80s and loved the game.  I was a huge fan of Fallout 3, New Vegas, etc, so I definitely want this game to be as enjoyable but it has been challenging.  Bethesda is fantastic at environmental story telling and several times I have been excited by random notes left or pieces of a story but then realize there is no real conclusion to the story because everyone is dead.  I will never meet the author of those notes.  I will never share stories with an NPC.  Robot vendors are about as exciting as you would expect that to be.  
---
Finally the difficulty and therefore the playability of the game is wildly erratic.  It seems that my experience goes from level 6-12 Scorched enemies where I bring out my weakest weapon just because I have the ammunition to spare to being surrounded by level 60+ feral ghouls with my rad counter going crazy and my health dropping too fast to even click the hotkey for a stimpack.  
---
Thanks for the reply and good talking with you!
---
Maybe some day there will be crossplay. 
---
I shall endeavor to make a Mr. FalloutTorgue montage complete with EXPLOSIONS, EXPLOSION NOISES, and EVEN MORE BADASS EXPLOSIONS!
---
It works for me.
---
This is a fine example to making pacifist mode ignore PvP completely instead of just preventing you from fighting back.
---
They’re easier to make and more variable in their options I think
---
AB = (xb - xa) i + (yb - ya) j
---
Except in this case it's more consistent bonuses for extra material cost, as you would repair the armor more often to keep the bonus high. 
---
I really don't see what the problem is.
---
Yeah I’m sure that they released the trailer with subliminal messages about how bad their own game is
---
But there are perks that increase sneak attack damage, much like better crits does to critical hits, my research I did was very minimal, and since servers are down on xbox I cant try to do any personal testing
---
Well, according to the body post, he didn't discover any exploits nor did any of the stuff involving the said activities.
---
Correct, cleared my odd 50 maps and no legendaries
---
but what if they could 
---
Lmao yeaaaah, I don't know about that chief 
---
We are clear for take off, roger Roger.
---
When i removed the prototype paint for "no paint" i could not put the prototype paint back on. The atom store ones you can switch as much as you want though.
---
Ok, I'm not the only one who gets only left arm armor if it's 3 star. I've gotten some decent weapons (no TSE) though. 
---
I wish you could breakdown ammo to make other types of ammo like in new vegas. If we could do that we wouldnt have to dispose ammo at trainstations 
---
Saw a wall mounted first aid kit at a business the other day and legit wondered if it had a Stimpak. 
---
Yeah I always hate to drop things, I feel like I need everything 
---
Begin the countdown.
---
Jup 
---
It can, but it’s also how assholes come shred your camp
---
There definitely should be some sort of system to allow this kinda thing. At the very least, we should be able to craft the mods themselves like we find in the world or at vendors so we can give/sell them to other peeps.
---
here's proof i play the game: i haven't had a single day of gameplay that wasn't fucked over by some shitty bug, being kicked off server, launching a nuke only to lose codes and never see bomb drop (ahha, do that over), missions go buggy, armor dissappearing from inventory once per week. gtfo  
---
oh and tying carry weight bonus to functional armor pieces makes no sense, it's the armor, not the power suit frame that brakes.
---
I too must look suspicious when I'm fucking around with my friend in my ritual clothes. Then I see a new 76 player, fresh out the vault (making sure to check achievements), and I forget to switch back to my medic uniform before greeting them and giving them free goodies.
---
railroads have nothing at all to do with that...
---
there are 7 different pools :
---
whitespring / whitespring station
---
whitespring bunker
---
wattoga market plaza
---
wattoga station
---
harper's ferrry
---
and then many of the west share the same caps (responders)
---
and east share nother pool

Yo, top floor of Fort Defiance. As you exit the elevator ahead of you and to the left will be a single chair at a table. Someone's dinner of vegetable medley and purple drink spawns there. I've never had it not be there. I imagine most people don't head up there for tea and soup.
---
Me and my friends use this same method to hunt people's camps to destroy. Fun times
---
There needs to be more specific drops from certain enemy types.
---
I don't mind ghouls dropping rolling pins and other vendor trash items, they are weak, and only getting 1 in 100 decent stuff from them is fine, but if I kill a legendary level 91 scorched glowing deathclaw I should get a decent weapon from them, lets say deathclaws only drop sledge hammer and above melee weapons, no guns, no rolling pins, just good melee weapons that fit the theme, so if you are a two handed melee dude you can hunt deathclaws for more specific types of legendaries.
---
Make weapons enemy specific with more powerful enemy types dropping appropriately powerful weapons. Pseudo random rather than full random.
---
And the Enclave are Nazis WITH cool clothes! Seriously though, wearing the officer uniform makes me extremely uncomfortable.
---
Mods don't get scrapped by the "scrap all junk" option. They DO go into the stash with the "store all junk" option, however, so you should check your stash to see if they were moved there.
---
Admittedly it's not ideal but the only way the entire community, which needs all the members and support it can get, can enjoy the game to the fullest. Nuke zones are the only  endgame we have. You don't have to use that particular weapon there and exclude the 8 other players right beside you. You can bring something else and everyone can participate. Having to carry any extra 15 lbs (i.e. a non TSE) is far less of negative than multiple players not even having a shot at thousands of XP. Please try to consider the other side. 
---
Especially, when a player launches a nuke, gets there and can hardly benefit from any of the XP because of one player with their inconsiderate use of TSE at Whitesprings. I didnt launch it for you and you alone - this is selfish and harms the community when it's simple enough for you to avoid the mechanic and not forfeit your weapon or build.
---
I dont mind encountering TSEs anywhere but at Whitesprings. In every instance - #%@$ that guy in particular.
---
You know I'm gonna

Ah. That makes it different then.

I believe this is what people call “over analyzing”

The most of things you said are bullshit, it means that you have not played enough to this game, if u are lv 50 you never saw how was at the beginning, why you just throw shit? On my opinion Bethesda is trying to do better and finally listen us. You blame a game that u never played and most of the bugs you are talking about are old and doesn't come from this patch, and if u think that fallout 4 is a broken game you has nothing to do with us even for fallout 76 do yourself a favor change game 
---
Man I got so excited. My kid actually laid down for a nap after a 3 day strike (read as- no fallout since Friday due to this) and I was hoping to get an hour or so play time. I knew the patch was coming but damn it guess I'm not playing today either. No way it will be over by the time he wakes up. Guess whenever I DO play I'll have a fancy upgraded game!
---
That comment does not change mine let me give you a list. mothman snally gaster wendigo super sloth radtoad drago.....erm scorchbeasts bout to go into work but yes therw are new enemies and none of them are you going to see that early in the game but your lvl 50 so why the hell haven't you seen them? Excuse being you got power leveled instead of playong the game to actually experience it.
---
"best game" is subjective, you don't have to defend a subjective opinion.
---
Basically in the end, I will agree a sneak attack, while having the same function as a crit, is not defined as a critical hit, I must apologize for not being more thorough in my reading, but sneak attacks can be improved with perk cards like criticals can.
---
Is focusing on crafting and repairs cost in intelligence a good idea? Because I I’ve kinda been doing that along with perception and strength
---
Sometimes it's just more effective to rush in with a supersledge. 
---
It was Xbox, yeah. Sounds like you might have found us!

Inwas very tempted to reply with 10. But i have no doubts wed make it to 0. So im skipping those comments.

Blast off
---
True. Unfortunately I have it at rank 3 but only one point in endurance since respeccing, so couldn't equip it.
---
Trading is fine if you're not going to panic that the items you intended to sell are missing for the next ~30 seconds. It's not that big of a deal, but can be quite a fun prank with a scorchbeast nearby.... &gt;:)
---
Can I ask why rank 3? Need to know if I'm missing something. 
---
My fireteam shares R1 sponge and R1 ghoul and it seems to work incredible for us. Is there a better benefit to sharing higher rank?
---
That's what I do most of the time too. Gatling for most things since it's efficient, and then I switch to my .50 Machine gun when I need the raw dps more than efficiency.
---
And we are on route.
---
Or deal with it. Mine can spawn mole rats, rad rats, bugs, super mutants, scorched or the occasional death claw. It just makes going home interesting. It can also spawn radstags, squirrels and I’ve even seen a chicken. I like to think of it as free resupply of food and junk.
---
The spreadsheet doesn't list clothing, only armor and underarmor. The Brotherhood Scribe Outfit appears to be normal clothing, not underarmor. It does not have the ma_UnderArmor_BOS [KYWD:0016EC06] like other BOS underarmors do. See this post for someone else confused about the status of the Brotherhood Scribe Outfit: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afbv2y/brotherhood_scribe_outfit_not_acting_as_over/

I won’t stop until I do 
---
I'm sorry, but I wanna try and sneak up on you now. 
---
It's not called Ebay, the name is Super Duper Mart!
---
I would say anti-armor as when get max perks you will be doing ok dmg already. Also anti armor is just really useful against mutants etc
---
looked at the sunset yesterday &amp; wondered if someone nuked the other side.  with ya survivor
---
Being able to craft the mod itself (Just like we can find in the wild) would actually make this work, and fun.  
---
Sadly, I have a feeling that by the time Bethesda implements it, there will be no market for it as everyone has already specced into characters that are jack-of-all-trades or resorted to using mules.
---
IGN: Aeluin

No they don’t. The only reason people think that is because you waste plastic. Bulk stuff when you WANT to sell it, otherwise leave it free. Saves you some mats, and at the cost of what... 0.2 pounds in your stash?
---
Tru
---
GOSH this game sure sucks! That's amazing!!!
---
You are not paying a monthly fee.  It’s not a service really.
---
nickels, nickles, nickles!
---
If a player is Wanted, they can't see anyone on the map at all. Crouching still helps because it hides your nametag if you're close enough to be seen, though.
---
Ueeeee ueeeee too difficult for you mh? Just imagine what kind of shitty game we would play if someone listens to you
---
My best legendary was found by my wife while we were exploring The Mire. Random drop for a 3* Single Action Revolver with Explosive, Decreased VATS and Furious. Not ideal but great fun for my gunslinger.
---
I suggested changes to the enemies and how they spawn around the camp in a post about 5 days ago. I agree with you, it is annoying as it is right now. 
---
Enemies spawn inside locked rooms, concrete foundations, on the roof. Sometimes, I will spawn inside my own foundation when fast traveling home, and have enemies spawn outside my camp, making me unable to fast travel away and force a re-log. 
---
I sincerely hope the enemies spawning mechanic gets a haul over soon, because its not just the camps. It's the events as well. 
---
Whether you are defending a workshop or doing an event where you have to defend from enemies (swarm of suitors comes to mind, line in the sand), the spawn mechanics are deeply broken. We are told to prepare our defenses like its going to be an epic battle, but 95% of the time, we are left hunting down the enemies ourselves because they are stuck somewhere, or didn't spawn properly. Or they are just standing still so far away from the event, that you actually leave the event by going after them.
---
I still like the game very much, I just hate how the enemies spawn in the game. 
---
The rewards of armour and weapons are tied to your level.  
---
Completing the quests at max level will reward you with max level items you can keep using in the end game.
---
Hahahah! That’s a shame I would have loved to have seen! I didn’t know servers were down, though. I hope they’’re back up by the time I get home from work! 
---
You would think a makeshift firearm would break after a few uses be inaccurate etc. but in this game they are very competitive to normal military grade equipment, with the added benefit of both rifle and pistol perks improving them and they far outlive their competition with 3 points in the plumber perk.
---
The only downside is the revolver and bolt action can't be automatics, the bolt has a tedious reload after each shot then even worse changing the clip and the revolver only has 6 shots and the revolver has no legendary. The regular pipe gun can be automatic but is lower on the damage side with a higher kick. But generally the revolver used in mid range and the bolt for sniper fire tend to have a higher base damage than most military grade guns surprisingly .. with all the perks taken.
---
I am finally at the point where I have excess stuff I can start giving away. 
---
I would love to do this. Like with confetti and sound you got from opening a lunchbox in Fo4 would be great. 
---
You sure did, buddy, you sure did.
---
There is a bump at Top of the World related quests, I think I did them in low 20s and it is doable and fun.  The quests to Harper's Ferry are another bump, I had trouble with them in the 30s, I drew scorched beasts on every visit for a while (but never had them again), so it may have just been random luck.  Later quests you need end game guns or help generally.
---
I've had rabid dogs climb my camp stairs and open the door to attack me.
---
Okayyyy.
---
Agreed and seconded
---
Thank you so much, I’m glad I haven’t done any treasure maps yet 
---
The Quantum Grenades seem to be Glitched and sometimes do no damage at all, but the regular Nuka grenades deal 600 Damage with the right perks, and Huge AOE.
---
I truly hope they haven't nerfed them with the new patch as I worked hard to find the plan, and farm Nuka Colas.
---
Don't be a douchenozzle. It is obviously disadvantaging other players if you're one shotting every enemy you see before anyone else can get a piece. They're a community event, not a single player event.
---
IGN: TheSoulOfCinderBoss
---
I wont be home for another 7 hours roughly.  I appreciate this a lot.  These guys will like this boost.  
---
That and this game is currently only $40 on Amazon, possibly cheaper elsewhere. There is no way they can stop this.
---
Ps2 is hyperbole but the grass and leaves have these horrible 2D Textures where I can see the pixels. The environmental design though is stunning. Some areas have very flat lightning which can look really strange. Also you can see the poligons on a lot of objects. But yes saying they are ps2 graphics is a complete exaggeration 
---
Yeah I got upset with dust for a while..."here I am counting off my bullets, but all these NPCs are spraying down their SMGs into the wall". I tried downloading a mod to make NPCs use ammo. It just became a melee fest. 
---
Got hit with the update this morning in the US on xbone should be good by this afternoon
---
I think they are referring to two things. 
---
1) I think they've changed the Power Generators which are here and there (where most of us find our fusion cores). It seems they are making them respawn fusion cores less often. This will make it harder to find fusion cores to use with our Power Armour so I don't understand how this will encourage us to wear the armour.  
---
2) If you claim the Poseiden workshop you get access to a machine that produces fusion cores as part of the deal. I think they've set them to produce 8 per hr.  There was some kind of problem with them producing the cores before. 
---
Both of these things seem to be designed to make claiming that workshop more attractive, i.e. we won't get cores elsewhere so we'll have to fight each other to the death for that Workshop. Gee thanks, Bethesda.  I always thought there wasn't enough toxic masculinity and gang home invasions in this game. 
---
Might just be rng. I've gotten dozens of 3* weapons from whitesprings alone. Yes, 99% of them are absolute garbage. Thankfully, I've been able to nab a few explosive (not ts) rifles, and nice 2-3* melee. What's your console and build,? I might have some extras I haven't vendored yet, laying around.
---
LOL, random perks. Hilarious idea.
---
I was thinking about a take on a dark souls run my son came up with. In that run, we had to wear whatever armor and use whatever weapons things we killed dropped. So you might be stuck with a broken sword and wearing some ridiculous shit.
---
So yeah, I'll prob be the guy in 2 pieces of wood armor and a .308...
---
I'll get stuck in cracks or potholes. Like.... The map of the ground has a deep crevice that is glitched to where you can't jump out and can just spin in circles. This happens more with power armor, and I just about always play in first person. 
---
I'll also freeze the game stepping out of my power armor somewhere inside, like a railway station. It's all gotta be some small glitch that just occasionally happens. Maybe they'll fix it today, if you're on console?
---
Lol - never had them spawn THAT far away - but yeah, it is a problem when you start exiting the event area to engage them
---
The cards are good, but you don't need the cards equipped all the time, so don't get a large number of intelligence. I have at max 7, and have the 50% weapon durability card, and something else. When I need to repair I equip the weapon artisan perk.
---
Good Luck :)
---
It doesn't happen often, but I love coming across other players' camps to see what they've built. After completing the game, this, and wandering Appalachia, are better end-game content than farming Whitesprings in my opinion. It's sad that there are people who destroy camps, forcing the other 90% of us to be paranoid.  I haven't had a problem yet, but I haven't had many visitors either, so judgement reserved.
---
I carry it as a backup to my handmade in case I run out of ammo. It’s affected by commando perks and I don’t use all that 10mm I’m picking up for anything else. It’s no TSE but it’s gets the job done in a pinch.
---
oof I’m level 15 never said it was hard but sure it’s annoying 
---
Matchmaking by level, language, or RP/PvP isn't silly at all, it's basic function.
---
I explored the map as much as I could which is my favorite thing to do in a Bethesda game. 
---
I'm not a huge fan of farming so from my perspective, there's not much to do now. I enjoyed the ride tho, so I'm happy with my FO76 experience!
---
I ran to the center as my friends watched in horror as i was crushed instantly as they continual told me to run and i was like "NA MAN IM GONNA WIN" I was wrong. 
---
Blast berries provide yellow cake flux.
---
I tea bag it. I also do the Hello emoji. When all else fails I shoot the sack on the ground. I'm barely level 15, and don't have much to gift. Sometimes it is just a stick of gum. Sometimes I gift a detective file and carton of cigarettes. There's a lot of fun to be had out there.
---
\&gt;They most have thought of this. 
---
That applies to so many weird failures of this game. 
---
The main bonus (the + fire damage) means less and less as enemies get tougher.  You can use it to burn through 10mm when you are easy sections of the map.
---
It's a bomb ass suit. I just don't wear the hat.
---
The two shot version breaks even faster, but it melts mobs in a hurry.
---
Most people get a decent weapon/armor though cap-trade discords/reddit, not the actual game. Sadly.
---
So max out those daily vendors, make those serums, sell that ammo, etc.
---
I've gotten an explosive double barrel, 2 combat shotguns, a cryolater, a western, and a 44 revolver. Also gotten a two shot fatman, 2 separate anti-armor fat man's (with different sized condition bars, so no dupe), a 2 shot missile launcher, an anti-armor missile launcher, and a two shot M79.
---
If you deliberately play like you're trying to find these things, you will. I've explored the map, but there's just not much out there.
---
I crash wherever, whenever. If there is a trigger for it I haven't found it yet.
---
Awesome, will do when I get on, thank you again :)
---
I told you i go by robert now
---
Hahahaha! I’m only level 22 myself but I do have a lot of excess stuff that’s just taking up space! My usual routine is wave frantically, drop loot, heart then if still nothing point my gun at said loot. It doesn’t work 😂
---
Something tells me you weren’t around during the PS1/PS2 days...  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_\/¯ 
---
It was like a pack of savage dogs converging on a wounded animal each trying to take a bite 
---
I have a tse that I use for soloing, but in places like Whitesprings I have a 2 shot Tesla rifle that taps everything and takes 8-10 shots to kill anything.  That way everyone gets to tap all the mobs.
---
It's an independently defined x2 dmg multiplier.  Can be increased to 2.5 via covert ops, and more with Mister Sandman.
---
i saw this for the first time yesterday, thought something was bugged since we could kill here and get out plans, even outside the rad zone, but whats the point ? if you have played the game, you should by now have both radshield and your rad shower, pretty stupid to call it noob nuke, more like it's the players that dosent want to get any rads that are the noobs :D
---
(probaly getting down votes on this one, lol)
---
They won't know about that "paranoia" unless it happens to them or they have seen it happen to someone else. I honestly hope that it never happens to anyone. I just prefer not to take the chance. 
---
I wish. It seems the whole lack of humans was laziness faked as creative choice.
---
My issue with these random attacks is I am forced to spam a lot of turrets. Turrets that eat my building budget. They ALWAYS attack when I port to my camp too. Since I’m there frozen in place while the game plays catch up. I either get killed. Or finally spawn in on my camp destroyed.
---
I had no idea...this should be a PSA! I assumed pacifist mode meant safety for all...not saying I've done this but honestly would never have given a second thought about it...
---
I use a vampiric plasma flamer.  It is amazing.  
---
I always thought sitting on top of Whitesprings with chameleon armor would be a good place to hide if you wanted to wait out a bounty, everyone would assume you where inside. 
---
i like to explore the map. yeah i think i've seen the 5 new critters. i suppose you guys take a lot of shit from all the people who agree with me on the quality and thin content of this latest beth release. entire left side of map was disappointing lol...  
---
thank god they kept the people who knew local-area design or there would be no "fill in your own story" moments at all. at least that carried over.
---
I saw a stack of cord wood in my neighbors yard and my first thought was that I really needed to gather some wood. 
---
He is on PC.
---
You can do it at any level, AI in this game is easy to trick and take advantage of. The only thing though is I recommend you wait until higher level as some plans/recipes won't be given to you as rewards because of your level and the named weapons you get will be shit and you'll end up trashing them.
---
If you’re only level 61 you have not farmed that many white springs.
---
I'm 29. I still have my PS1 and PS2. Actually played King's Field the other day. :)
---
First I was like yay=)! then you need to learn 3 times =(
---
Thanks for putting this image in my mind
---
Honestly, I can't complain about my luck. I've gotten a two shot gatling gun at level like 112 or something. Soon after I got a two shot LMG and an explosive gatling plasma. I recently even found a TSE dragon, although it's level 35. I found a couple decent pieces of armor that reduce weight of certain things by 20%. Close to 200 hours as well here. I don't farm whitesprings, but I sometimes at least clear it out when I'm passing through. The two shot pipe rifle is a pretty good drop for you though, if it's max level. That thing has a surprisingly good DPS.
---
I think the real issue is that events only drop legendary armor. Once you get to higher levels you get 0 use out of another 1-star combat armor left arm. The most useful effects come at 2- or 3-starred armor pieces. However, a weapon with just one effect like furious or instigating or two shot can be extremely helpful.
---
yeah man, you got me. nobody could possibly this game was made on the cheap, released poorly and underdeveloped. lemme just google th- nope the loud minority is here in reddit
---
It was fixed before xmas
---
I always forget...
---
It's about average, but considering how rare actually good weapons are, it's nice that it's a guaranteed drop.
---
I’ve dived headfirst back into New Vegas.
---
I keep trying to pick up desk fans.
---
It doesn’t work.
---
Ballistic fists. My favorite Fallout fist weapon ever.
---
Well thanks to the guys that went from fissure to whitesprings and saved me from the pair of Yao guai  if that is the case lol
---
It'd be nice if once they left a certain radius, they stopped counting towards workshop. You can't even get that far outside the map to kill him. Just leaves the option to either server hop or forget it. Server hopping isn't a big deal, but it isn't something we should have to do.
---
sorry forgot to mention he was in team with a non wanted player who was relaying info to him my friend blocked him for game and he still was finding him so was the only thing that made sense so that was why we were hiding 
---
I once lost Herbavor farming my mutations by having my 3 star Carnivor equipped and ate a body.
---
That was a lot more wholesome of a response than I was expecting haha
---
I understand. It is monotonous for late game right now, but I was kind of expecting that. 
---
I am personally just trying to be patient and wait for new content to get added. I only have a couple days a week to play usually so it bothers me less than most people. Those who have time to play a lot are probably really bored.

Tbh I’m a big fan of Bethesda games and I think they’ve gone downhill as a company since Fallout 4. So I’m interested to see how they do because I want them to make games like how they used to.
---
Yeah me too, especially if I didn’t have to worry about my guns or armor breaking while in PvP battlegrounds. 
---
if your a sniper carry a few land mines when they charge you in melee run keeping the mine between you and them 
---
pulse mines for power armor 
---
plasma or nuke mines for anything else 
---
It sticks when I’m exploring and a level 60+ scorchbeast comes by and blasts me into smithereens

That's totally fair. Shame the downvote brigade is out in force right now!
---
honestly I'm mostly annoyed at the lack of immersive atom shop items they all make me feel like I'm playing a joke character in fortnite save the world (screw you br) not a wasteland survivor 
---
Ahhh, gotcha. Smart thinking then!
---
This is what I feel like firing a gatling weapon:

Get some baby!
---
I hope so i still want to fight NPC humans like raiders and mercenaries and find human traders. 
---
Human npcs are most likely gonna pop out of the vaults when they open them and Bethesda is gonna be all like "Surprise". 
---
I just want Wooby to be free.

Oof the sarcasm hit me so hard in the face I got a black eye 
---
Genius 
---
I had to go to a hardware store yesterday...... 
---
So what was that about not deleting? If yoy say something at least stand by it kiddo
---
Gods yes... that and the Silver Shroud costume....
---
You see I won’t go out of my way to kill players but I will if they follow me for a long time or start to annoy me. Also this is why I have a TSE handmade and a TSE pump action. So that when the griefers come they get a nice big explosive hug. 
---
Cost: 20 000 atoms.
---
This needs a Steve Buscemi "How do you do, fellow vault dwellers?" meme
---
sounds like you're near Silo Alpha. Which might be a problem. 
---
Watch out for people who will hunt you and immediately report you because they think you are duping. 
---
Better yet, a magazine rack to display them on
---
I've been crashing every time I play the game now. This is getting a bit tiring.
---
My God what a load of crap. There isn't a finite supply of stimpacks and weapons in the game world and so the "economy" isn't dependent on people selling their junk to keep it in circulation. You're mixing up real life and a video game again.
---
my friends a taxi cab driver and when talking to him I asked him to bring me to the store and handed him a bag of caps he burst out laughing 
---
What does “On the first code” mean? Im still learning how to launch it and im a bit confused
---
Do you get slap from them?
---
Apparently at lv 50 it isn’t. According to a message I got the only way to get the lv 50 outside of buying from a vendor who it’s been sold to or another player is by waiting till level 50 to do that mission. 
---
This true?
---
I always carry it with me. If I load into Whitesprings as soon as I can I put it on. It has saved my bacon a couple times.
---
Others like to be left alone, I know it’s not only me, hehe. Don’t you dare sneak up on my camp, it will scare the sht out of me
---
Then I don’t need to point out how absurdly hyperbolic the comparison is...
---
I do have to commend you on your taste, though. *King’s Field* was my favourite PS1 game. 
---
This isnt the case anymore or doesnt work on all conversions. 
---
I've got a legendary pipe rifle that doesnt double dip if convertaed to pistol. I cannot speak for the pistol to rifle conversion. 
---
i mean if its not intended it should be, whats to stop my friend from collecting my 200 cap bounty if it awards him 200 caps. If i only get 50% of the caps then eventually we wont have enough caps between us to continue greifing. 
---
No legendary pipe revolvers sadly, but the others do
---
Yea getting sick of scorched and robots
---
gifts / look down / I'm sorry 
---
also a I'm a pacifist stop hitting me with your damn sledge you moron - not really sure how to make that one a emote to be honest but yeah do it 
---
I would pay that have not bought anything yet.Waiting for a cool costume like this one.
---
Can confirm fixed in PC update. No reason to believe it won’t be for consoles. 
---
I 100% agree
---
Yeah fuck bears.
---
Just like sweetrolls
---
Question: if you do the Freddy quest at a higher level, will the guaranteed Storm be higher level too?
---
Don't go into a hardware store.
---
Wooby is a sick f*ck and should stay locked forever. God help us all if he ever escapes...
---
OMFG, LMAO!!!  That's classic...   Oh man, thank you!   Thank you for giving me a good laugh...
---
It’s a glitch. You’ve been flagged by the white spring task force and will be mercilessly hunted 
---
*The woobening*
---
Yeah, why add all that conversation and choice if you can just make the person speed-read a bunch of really boring computer screens or listen to a recording? It almost makes me value 'Not us' from the Scorched. At least it's a human speaking. I even look forward to seeing Graham and Cholly Moo-moo these days. Tragic. 
---
Unless you're a low level, how do you have problems finding fusion cores? Just fast travel to areas where power armor suits spawn, where loose cores spawn, or where spots where you can remove them from fusion generators. Before I knew of their weight I was collecting them like I was in Fallout 4. I had 60 of them at one point and I had no idea what was taking up so much space in my stash, lol.
---
Was in the Burning Mine exploring last night and I think you afk'd in one of the rooms. Here's a pic of your corpse. You had a shot glass and acetone in one hand and your pupper in the other.
---
Are you ok? 
---
&gt;the game is all about America being awesome and China and communists being bad
---
No, it's not. It's about surviving after the nuclear apocalypse you simpleton.
---
Needs a lot more than just ping and a player list. You need to have matchmaking to help players find people who want to do similar things (and not use Reddit, discord forums, and every dumb thing in between). 
---
Don't get me wrong, I still have a a great time with my friends playing. 
---
What I dont like is "LOL PWNED! I REKD U 4 MY YOUTUBE!" 
---
OK Man, you asked me for help and I tried to make you feel better. Well I guess I did. 
---
I’m not sure, but that’s what I just got told in a message. Apparently if you wait until level 50 to do the quest, it’ll drop at level 50
---
I might have to try this, thanks for the tip, so would I just run events/taking workshops, or would there be suitable places to grind?
---
Well ofc they knew that it would be a, controversial game. When i first heard about Fallout 76 being an online game. I was  like ' nooo not online! I am not gonna play that'   but i gave bethesda the benefit of doubt. So i decided to give it a go and surprisingly i do enjoy it alot. Because it doesnt gives me the feeling  that it is an online game.  I dont meet other players every 5 minutes. Or i dont get killed every 10 min by some high level player called 'Trollboydoingyourmom'. Having the feeling that you are alone in the world of fallout is what i enjoy.  And if i meet another player i will wave and greet, even help if needed.  But i am not the kind of person that would join factions or clans.
---
I can imagine that other players arent satisfied with this game, because they want more pvp, more players on a server or do faction wars or w.e.  I do agree with those that want more players on a server.  I would allow like 36 ppl on the server,  but not more or it would become a crowd.
---
w. e bethesda will do in the future,  there will be always people that will complain. 
---
Nope, i have met lvl 12 and farmed at whitespring i was with him actually and sold me his Twoshot harpoon gun (lvl 45)for 10 caps and his twoshot western revolver for 5 caps as the requirement for the weapon dosent fit him. And yes my level 15 is just a mule somtimes i go trading and people seeing like "why do i have this weapon" well even my level 15 is carrying TSE just in case if my mule becomes secondary charac. Youll kniw a duper when you expect something unexpected right now your experiencing someone who's smarter than you and knows how to trade with people (thats also me actually)
---
yes, i secretly work for minecraft, you fucking muppet
---
I found a guy with 50k wood and steel and tossed most of it and used the rest to build warehouses for noob players I saw near me they were so excited 
---
(puts on privateer hat)
---
On one of my characters i have taken over one of the shops on the WS golf course.  Its right outside the normal nuke zone so i have a full public workshop,  radiation showers, beds and instruments.  During nukes i usually turn on the sirens and invite folks to pay for easy usage during farming.  I love our when folks stop by. 
---
It could be possible I think.
---
I remember reading of the Fallout 3 Robobrains that many of them retained a degree of sentience after construction, thanks to their human brains. If not inhibited by the hands of their makers, Robobrains would maintain a certain level of personality and free will, allowing for expanded functions such as operating within their makers intent (IE, not just mindlessly performing tasks exactly as instructed, rather, they could solve problems and complete tasks in creative manners within the realm of intent). 
---
Many were exposed to bacteria and viruses, permeating the bio gel that surrounds their brains within the glass housing. This is either because the bio gel was exposed in a non-sterile environment when being filled in the glass housing, or more likely, because the fragile housing became cracked and chipped, thanks to decades of exposure to the wasteland without proper maintenance. 
---
This causes rampancy - where the artificial intelligence becomes corrupted and slowly degrades and higher-thinking ceases. The A.I. quite literally goes insane, because the still-human brain is sick. 
---
I see no reason why Robobrains couldn’t be infected by the Scorched Plague. 
---
Saw him on the road just east of Charleston fire station. After shopping I head to the station for lead and grahm was rounding the corner!
---
So a good rule of thumb is. When you load into a server, pull up your map and start looking for troublemakers , i.e
---
 High bounty guys or even really high level dudes. Once they are found go to there blip and just block them right off. I find doing this fixes a lot of problems, mind you not all, but a lot. Or to be real safe just block every blip you see on the map.
---
And when you look at the team sizes for both of those, it’s hardly a surprise. 
---
This is a common issue when it comes to the Queen that honestly doesnt have a viable way of being fixed without screwing over someone in some way, however there are ways around it.
---
Me and a bunch of 3-7 friends usually run 3x queens per server by forming up 2x4 teams on discord before joining eachother/a new server. Doing this usually lets us kill the queen in around 20 seconds - 2 minutes of her spawning, pretty much removing the escalating buffs she recieves from more people joining the event. I'd strongly recommend you join the reddit discord to find likeminded people who you can run the SBQ with :) it has quite the nice community of people thats always willing to help aswell.  
---
Another solution to the problem would be to remove the event/loot for people under 50. it's harsh but it'd sort out the leeching problem pretty much.
---
I'm usually not pvping with low or mids, I wasn't asking if it was better because the explosive is already factored into the damage with the gauss rifle, I'm just wondering if it's still sufficient to kill someone with it in one shot. Not trying to sound snarky, I guess I could've worded it better. 
---
After a week of your nice camp getting destroyed and being unable to place the blueprint, i resorted to the 1x1 foundation with a ladder going up 3 flights to a sky base.. i got tired of the 2 turrets i had not being able to shoot things or things basically destroying everything else.
---
at some point wanting things to look nice loses to wanting things to be efficient cause of bugs or stupid budgets. 
---
try launching a nuke lol... now i know why people spam invites to everyone on the server before launch. pathetic
---
I almost had a stroke reading that.
---
Chemist doesn't work for flux I believe. 
---
Just super duper. 
---
Ammosmith with super duper is amazing. 
---
&gt;Secondly, if I'm playing solo, there's no reason to spawn me in to a server where my camp can't be placed. Just pick a different server!
---
Agreed, the notification is nice, but it would be better still if it gave you the option to immediately switch servers, instead of making us load in anyway, then disconnect and try again. Ideally, both situations could be addressed by the same system: "Your CAMP can't be placed/You're in a nuke zone. Load anyway, or try another server?"
---
And what do they do against someone who has a sledge and Marsupial?
---
I died to him and his henchmen several times. His name was like gllbria or something like that
---
Honestly they pretend it was a brilliant design idea to be unique but in reality it comes off as laziness to me. The game is rather lackluster in the rpg aspect for me.
---
I woke up at 6 man ready for school it cancelled this happend and then i wrote it 
---
some locations have worse spawns then others I one time had rad toads spawn in my house constantly drove me nuts that said I found several nice spots that only spawn beavers and deer and stuff if your interested I can tell you a few 
---
I can't fast travel :( no strong back perk though
---
I'd call that a hat trick challenge.
---
Following
---
What kind of stuff do ya get for the treasure maps
---
Thanks all !
---
yep
---
Not-sucky mods for the syringer. I found a mod for this in FO4 and made a scientist character who poisoned his way through the wasteland.
---
And different crossbow bolt types. Make crossbows cool!
---
No one knows. The Servers are still down.
---
Feel at home on the burns ward
---
They forgot: "collect an asshat" 
---
Monster factory house?
---
It feels great /s
---
Servers haven't come up yet
---
Maybe a former team fortress 2 employee 
---
The real question. 
---
Does the Nuka Cola respawn on server hop?
---
asking for a friend. 
---
I found it. 770c off of Grahm.
---
SpOoOoKy
---
We do have good times :) 
---
I'm with you - i've felt like they should have taken an aggressive stance from the beginning.  Instead they've been silent.
---
Do you know when it is playable? 
---
Wish I knew! Anyone know how long they are down for? Seem to recall it was pretty long last time??
---
mostly it's crap like the ivory grip plans, but I've gotten lots of T45 mod-plans and other weapon-plans, plus tons of different weapons you can scrap for learning mods :P chems, junk ..you name it, the dirt has it :P
---
Hats off to anyone who does those
---
Yes, same for any quest rewarded legendary item
---
Fyi mirv kinda sucks as it does this thing where as soon as the nuke breaks into the multi nukes, they just fall straight down. Even at a 45 degree arc it goes like 20 ft, pops, and falls. I switched mine back to a standard for that long shot.
---
Reading your sentences leaves a person feeling breathless. It's okay, punctuation isn't a finite resource. You're allowed to use some!
---
Do you not have mobs chewing at things?
---
I leveled an alt to 50 before doing those quests. Not all will give you a level 50 weapon. The Mistress of Mysteries questline still gives you stuff at level 25, but you can upgrade those. Mayor for a Day will give you a level 50 All Rise. The kidnapping quest that gives you the pyro smg will also be level 50. 
---
Unfortunately, I haven't done the questline that gives you Perfect Storm yet.
---
I dunno. But I do know from personal testing if u find a mod you do NOT want. Leave it and relog then check again it should be different one in that spot. Most times, although the thousands of chemist work bench and ivory grip mods dont. 
---
Interesting. Good to know, thank you. 
---
I Have to try that bonfire trick now. Thank you. 
---
I did some digging on the handmade plans myself, because I've been after them for a while and want to find them in-world myself and not buy them from another player.
---
The distribution of handmade gun plans is a little weird. You have a random chance to get them from nearly any container on the map or any event, but the way they reference the plans from various level lists the chances to find them from several places is higher.
---
The Patrol Duty event is the number one highest chance, followed by the watoga vendor and Grahm (who both have equal chance to have them), followed by the quest "Distinguished Guests" (I think at Bolton Greens?) and the Free States vendor(s). There's also a chance to get them from horde events and power plant events and a few other events but it's about 1/3 as likely as the other sources so not worth chasing just to go after handmade plans.
---
sounds dangerous :P ..they'll never get my treasures, though! (too bad this is a glitch, it made me so happy to just be able to return to my base to scrap all the new weapons)
---
Endangerol syringer, cryolator, heavy guns and melee. .50 cal if possible. Mini gun does ok but breaks really fast. The less people the lower her damage resist.
---
Yes, game person I saw!
---
I have a pet. It’s my mule account since I can’t carry or store more than a few Armor sets/guns. 
---
;_;
---
The organic brain of the Robobrain is merely a processor, supplying computing power, speed, and other autonomous benefits to the slaved chipset that is linked to the brain.  The real programming and higher functions are all part of the chipset.  The Scorched Plague probably wouldn't be able to utilize a Robobrain, as it's primarily inert fleshy bits that have no actual sentience anymore.
---
Agreed. Something should be mentioned about high level melee players too who just do nothing until she lands. Clean up the mobs for christs sake, and stay away from the ranged, you're making it harder for us because you keep jumping in front of us. We're scoped in on the queen, if you see explosions on her at least one of use has a TSE and running in front of us is gonna get us killed. Kill the adds before they get to us, we shouldn't need to if you didn't bring a ranged backup. 
---
Seriously, you need one, she's barely on the ground sometimes. 
---
Agree with all of these, ESPECIALLY the last one! I think just an emote giving them the finger would work!
---
My hope is that by knowing the spawn times, I can farm the maximum number of a very rare item. Should I farm daily? Biweekly? Every 12 hours? Or is it all RNG chaos? 
---
I havent done any research so just going off my experience i would say that the timers are either close to 12-24 hours or once they have been collected in that world they dont respawn. Way back when farming Charleston Fire Dept was the best way to get lead I would check it several times during my session of 4-5 hours and it would never come back. 
---
Best advice, just server hop and check the spawn places til you find what you need.
---
I didn't say it was a noob thing to do, I was just explaining the method in question. I guess it just makes it easier for some.
---
Have you played Fallout 76?
---
When the servers are back up.
---
Any tse guns good. I have quite a few
---
My turret attacked me too.  Six different CAMPs, that turret has been with me the whole way.  Never scrapped, always stored.  Then one day it looks at me funny and starts to go dakka-dakka.
---
I appealed to it.  I tried to reason with it.  I hid behind a wall, sobbing with emotion, pleading for it to just TELL ME WHAT THE PROBLEM IS!
---
And stuck my head out when it went reflectively quiet, only for it to resume fire.
---
It’s gone now.  I kicked it to the kerb and in its place a shiny sleek missile turret - fresh, sleek, perky.  And obedient.
---
That old banger is just a memory now.
---
If this is as long down time as usually, still about an hour, but no one really knows.
---
Did these rad toads happen to be near some water and a junk node in the Mire?
---
Some areas have ranked enemies you can just get some experience in the easy part of the map then move yourself in difficult areas after certain lvl let's say 30 or 40 enough to get a decent build and power armour 
---
They didn’t give is a time 
---
I'm actually just farming the SMG itself and scrapping for mods. I guess as a world object the same timer would apply, though. 
---
My trigger is stacks of firewood at gas stations. I know, wood isn't valuable, but it just gets me.
---
bye Felicia 
---
How can you follow people to different servers unless you are friends with them? :P
---
my guild never got any firsts but we did alright. it was a good group.
---
never log out again
---
2 people are enough if they are strong, or 10 people could be there and they arent strong enough.
---
First queen kill took 25 of the 30 minutes the game gives you. After killing her many times she can die in 5 minutes or less once your setup is optimized
---
The weapon variety is pretty lacking other than the 3-star legendaries, and I've never once gotten one of those. I'd always preferred energy weapons (plasma pistole, gauss rifle) but those are severely underpowered for how much they weigh, and inventory weight management is a primary mechanic of FO76.
---
I really enjoyed the base-building aspects, as I did in FO4 - but I'm not a big fan of the mechanics of how to get plans. Some do come from quests, but the vast majority are randomly available at robot vendors or Grahm, the traveling super mutant vendor. These are really painful to collect, because you have to hop servers or very slowly "legitimately" acquire them, and there's no in-game mechanism to know whether you've already learned the plan without purchasing it.  
---
The quests that DO exist are interesting enough for my tastes, I just ran through all of them and lost interest in the game in general.
---
Ugh I wish I would have kept the 2 shot Tesla my team mate gave me. I'm looking at you 600LB stash limit.
---
So it would seem that "The gunslinger" is a group build and not for solo? That sucks - I would have loved to run around in a long coat and boots, with pistols in both hands yelling "Yihaaaa!" "Eat lead foul Ghoul!" "Great bombs of Atom!", save the day and fast travel into the aura of a glowing mushroom.
---
I thought you were serious and I was thinking “cool I found something super rare!” 
---
Silly me 
---
Hardly deliberate mate, only have what we have. My other weapons all 1 shot as well. If there's a starred legendary I'll try to do as little damage as possible and alert others to let then get a hit, as do most people I've cone across, but at a gear point it's actively hard to not 1 shot stuff. 
---
Love these builds so much
---
That’s annoyed me so much, plus on top of it all I literally couldn’t kill his henchmen. The dude was at 1 hp and I hit him 5 times with my tse shot gun but it just was not happening. I couldn’t even fathom what was going on. Sorry you encountered him as well, We should get a bunch of people to band together and destroy all his bases. I know where his main base is haha
---
It's not? 
---
Let's hope it will be. I've got my fingers crossed.
---
Fair. I'll hop until I've depleted all known sources, then give it at least 12 hours. I'm really hoping for 12 and not 24, though. Shorter would be better still!
---
With the right gun and an overdrive you can solo the queen in a few minutes with no one else around duo takes maybe 5 minutes tops from her extra health. A team of 4 can down her in 45 seconds or less if they are the only ones there at spawn.   
---
As for weapons you are looking for 50 cals best fire rate damage ratio. Get the two shot explosive faster reload and it is even better.   
---
If you are into cheating down like 200 explosive bobble heads and just one shot her with any level explosive weapon. 
---
Luck doesn't have anything to do with vendors, it effects what drops you get, how much durability that drop has and how much condition is left. People trading legendary weapons that have shit condition bars are due to them having literally no points invested in luck except to keep starched genes. 
---
you didn't by chance move your luck into charisma?
---
To be fair that's not *really* much of a challenge just at the moment :D
---
yeah, i guessed so, was just making a point :)
---
Don't you? 
---
Some players said between 1 and 4 hours. Now are 2 hours with servers down
---
I suspect all those mutations you just had to get triggered the turret. :). 
---
Top right zone. Game options. Third option down is scan and repair. 
---
Size problems?
---
Try "documents/my games/fallout 76" in there is fallout76.ini
---
Edit in notepad
---
Look down to display
---
You can manually set
---
ISize W =
---
iSize H =
---
1080p size is w = 1920 , h = 1080
---
Same here, plus I just really enjoy evasion. I take off when people get near, did the same with GTA online, if there’s a chase it is thrilling. If the person really starts to tail me I’ll hop servers. My outlook on anonymous gamers is also very distrustful, formed from my experiences, but I do acknowledge that the “griefers” are more abundant in GTAO, making my opinion a little skewed. I have come across some really, really creepy people in GTAO. I have never been thrown into a bad sport lobby in there, but I can only imagine...
---
Can't remember 100% but either 20 or 24 hours.
---
They are providing servers and content, therefore t's a service. It's just not a subscription based service.
---
no timer on mod parts in my experience. its if someone has picked it up or not. Ive seen mod spawning spots that i can loot every server hop if im lucky. Plans may be different. 
---
I was collecting toxic water in the flooded basement of the vault tec ageicultural research facility and mutated into a marsupial. It was exciting.
---
The house inbetween Camden Park and Nuka Factory 
---
I’m not new to the game lad just the pc version, cheers for the information tho 
---
I recently bought ESO because I liked FO76 so much (I previously did not play many online games with others).  However, I'm having trouble getting into it.  Compared with 76, it seems a little too busy with players everywhere and I'm having trouble with the combat system (seems clunky).  Any advice for adjusting to this game and getting into it a bit more?
---
It is good vendor fodder though.
---
Got a deep chuckle from me. Worth the time to craft all that.
---
Well damn. Very insightful thanks a lot!
---
I read your title as "TSE gauss", anyways, if you have an explosive Gauss, it's still the best or second best secondary effect. I doubt you can kill everyone one-shot, if they have -40% dmg reduction Assasin set + Dodgy active + Fireproof + Padded. Most players yeah. Hard to say, because it all depends what perks/armor targets have.
---
Good show on you for knocking the money grubbers on r/fo76bazaar down a peg, like when the news came out about the handmade plans.
---
It keeps telling me i dont have the required entitlements to login. I was getting pissed, until now i read servers are still offline. 
---
Jeez how is that for a homecoming? 
---
Genuinely curious, is this what the vault is know for these days? I go here to trade legit fairly often as it's a free travel spot and I don't have to invite the other player to my camp if I don't want to. 
---
Worst case. You Can delete that ini file while the game isn't running and the game will re create it
---
On Xbox it shows 'recent'...meaning anyone you've been on a server with. You click on it, click view profile, click join game, bada bing, bada boom. No friend needed. 
---
Are you sure? And if so, how sure?
---
Too hairy, smelly and fat to fuck, but to each their own.
---
I wear a civil war era dress with a beer hat and a gas mask. 
---
omg someone helpful and not accusing me of lying XD. i feel like this is a fan club in here with these hostile responses. was really hoping this would get upvoted so the game would continue to get patched and these SEVERE issues would be eliminated - instead i'm a "liar and fake gamer".  thanks cheese
---
I have an instigating Fatman, part of me wants to run dense+fireproof and just run around with an MIRV shooting the floor (with slightly less than full health lol)
---
Oh ok. Thanks for the tips!
---
Level 83 and god only knows how many hours in, do not have any legendary weapons. I've found a few 1 or 2 star pieces of armor though. I don't like farming, but I guess I will have to eventually.
---
It would also make it easier to give our lower level alts some of our excess mats and low level legendaries. 
---
delusional
---
I get them spawning inside my tiny generator room. Luckily the room is so small they don't do any damage.
---
I won't! :P
---
I solo'd alpha yesterday it's really not bad and I'm same level melee build 
---
Sharing the right perks with each other is important,  Crippling range weapons are really helpful and a high damage melee or explosive shotgun for when it lands is as well. 
---
Forced respawn trick? Care to explain in more detail? I'm out of the loop on that one.
---
When we attempt to solve them we end up with many solutions. In this case we had 1450 possible solutions. I split the solutions up amongst people so they all try different ones. Tex got the code on his first attempt from the list.

Right you got all that from other posts so I doubt you played the game fuck out a here
---
I’ve seen 300+ missiles before lol 
---
If you’re gonna do mechanist then the bee lady needs to be added as well
---
Usually just tag them.  Most of the time they're already in a fight with a bunch of gulpers, so I sit back and mop up as artillery falls
---
Nope you are just a youtuber dick rider 
---
That sounds like fun... but I can only play during the day lol And I’m one of those people where you hear like everything going on in the background lol The one guy thought it was funny my 17 month old says crap 🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
I’ve had people request stuff out of inventory before and this has never happened
---
You can use the vomit one to make it look like you are vomiting up a gift.

South Central part of the map just follow the train tracks until you see a white pillar with the hoop, one of them has a intact stairwell [https://imgur.com/diET8fg](https://imgur.com/diET8fg) just climb to the top and then you can place your camp in the hoop, the build sphere reaches the bottom, but fair warning it does lower the build radius of the ground level.
---
here is the location on the map [https://imgur.com/0yh9mcJ](https://imgur.com/0yh9mcJ)

I only ever go to whitespring if I've nuked it, I actively avoid it because I strongly dislike the grind, but all my backups 1 shot as well. There's a gear point where glowing ghouls just die. It's common courtesy to attempt to minimise damage and let others get a hit in on starred legendaries but normal ones is asking a bit much from a geared player who has to basically take their weapons off or remove their perk cards to not 1 shot. I'm not going to die just to allow others a chance to hit. 
---
((I'm a ranged non-PA player, if I don't kill ghouls quick, they kill me quick. Even my melee 1 shots them unless I take perk cards off))
---
Dupers are literally the most cancerous people. Especially if they're doing it at the detriment of their fellow vault dwellers. It doesn't help that Bethesda has been so slow about hitting them for it.
---
I was wonder exactly how it works too.   
---
I'm not saying there are bad rank 2 cards out there, i'm saying that in some situations it's better with two rank 1 cards.
---
They were being sarcastic.
---
i didn't report you. you're entitled to your opinion, even if i think it and your actions are misguided. 
---
Personally i think this game is very similar, yet at the same time a very different experience from playing fallout 4. It has the a much richer world than FO4, imo, and lots of content. Sure, there are bugs. FO4 STILL has bugs, but i havent experienced anything near game-breaking. 
---
I haven't bought anything from the atom store, despite having like 3k atoms from completing challenges i never even new existed. This game is fun, and i don't think i could rate the experience based solely on playing FO4. 
---
But that's neither here nor there. you do whatever makes you happy. I am going to log in tonight, find the rest of the materials i need to craft my X01 power armor and find a group to take out the Scorch Beast Queen. And i am looking forward to it. 
---
Enjoy being angry.
---
Yea...I've spent over 350 hours playing a game because it sux....your right.  
---
It is not new it existed in BETA
---
I like Uranium Fever for a few reasons. Three legendary guys spawn, the glowing moles are capped at 40 so Glow Sights perk makes quick work of them, and there's a scrapping table right nearby so you can loot literally everything.
---
Enclave events are quick, and can randomly award good stuff.
---
Watoga at large is great once you've completed a certain quest.
---
One Violent Night using just the jukebox to fill the meter means lots of ferals, some high level and legendary, plus a glowing wendigo at the end.
---
Census Violence can be boring sometimes, but double dips on useful drops since you can get a plan and a legendary.
---
Dyer Chemical and Thunder Mountain can spawn high level legendary enemies, and are close together.
---
Follow the steps above. Or, well, don't, because it should all be patched.
---
The first two methods are specifically if you are _**offering**_ items for sale.
---
Yep, me and a few buddies triple nuked her the other night 
---
&gt; bee lady 
---
maybe a hero themed costume week would be a good idea.
---
I imagine it will be at the release of Avengers endgame if they ever release them
---
RAID BAWSS!
---
No problem 😊. 
---
Great idea man! Well executed.
---
I did the exact same thing. Was in the store a few days ago and picked up a clipboard at the register thinking about springs
---
Ah, probably read this too fast
---
Yeah maybe there is some truth to this. I always hear that PC has hackers while console has the immature/griefers. I am on xbox, and there have been many times where I wondered if I am in the presence of a hacker, across a number of games. Then my one friend tells me xbox has very little hackers, wonder if there’s truth to any of that? 
---
That's awesome! I always wondered what the point of player stealth was when they can just see you on the map. Not the case! Thanks! 
---
I could see them either populating small sections of main towns with npc 76 dwellers, or creating new settlements formed by npc 76 dwellers, in addition to having outsiders start trickling in.
---
After all, where ARE the rest of the people in vault 76? Unless it only housed 25 people, there should be a lot more people around, besided the 24 players per server +1 missing overseer.
---
I also wouldnt mind finding dead 76 dwellers scattered around, sometimes in hilarious places. 
---
one time I was in a tree next to this guys camp invisible for 5 minutes. Man wish I knew how to use a soundboard from the Predator.
---
Just go to places that spawn big mobs. I stayed near the airport and did the collision course and  prison break events a bunch. Also, small things like lockpicking, crafting and cooking really add up at low levels. 
---
Give me a shout if that still isn't working 
---
fair enough, i can respect that. good luck and i hope it gets resolved!
---
I think they should add human NPC'S because  its hard to believe that there isnt a single human out there that survived.  Not even a ghoul ( not feral).  Thats something they rly didnt think about clearly or dialogues would have made the game to heavy? Idk . All u find is, dead human bodies like cmon. At least a handful persons should be alive.  I also wish there were a few settlements so players can meet up there and trade with each other or local vendors like in diamond city from FO4
---
Not gonna back those claims up then? Typical MAGAtard making lots of noise and begging for attention lol
---
Let’s break this down. 
---
OP said he couldn’t conceive why *anyone* could dislike or review the game poorly. 
---
I said that the game he is playing is much different (read: better) than the one that existed on release. There are fewer issues now than there were then, and fewer people have issues now than had issues then. 
---
I never claimed that everyone who played near release had a bad experience. 
---
That you had a good experience on release is great, and I’m happy for you. But bringing it up doesn’t actually have any bearing *at all* on what I said, and if you think it does, you don’t really understand what’s happening here. 
---
That’s ironic, because we were talking about people being unable to look beyond their own experience. 
---
Clearly you plopped your camp on top of a spawn point. Looks like its time to move along.
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Robobrain
---
My theory wasn’t exactly 100% correct, but it think this still supports the OP’s curiosity. 
---
It does appear that many could override their programming thanks to their human brains, so I don’t think that excludes being infected either somehow. 
---
Ive had my CAMP attacked three times and play pretty heavily. Once I assume someone was buttsalted that I had my CAMP by the pond at Charleston Station (theres a random encounter there and a CAMP stops it from happening) and another time Im pretty sure it was a player trying to bait me into immediately fast traveling there and fighting them with my scrap on me. I just ignored them; they could level my base and I wouldnt care. Materials are too easy to come by to be assed with defending it. The llast time it was someone getting a super high bounty for PvP; I just let them do their thing. Like I said, materials are super easy to come by so its not a big deal if someone completely levels my CAMP. Worst case scenario is I just move it for 40 caps and everything is repaired. 
---
Items wise yes, the cap is at 50, otherwise i'd say at around 60+ if you've done your build right you start being pretty powerful
---
That ending though. So perfect and so worth the read! 
---
Try getting them all and then removing one, if it’s a good one get it again. If is is a bad one, remove a second. I did this and didn’t spend much time getting the ones I want and then keeping the ones I can live with. 
---
Jesus I still don't have time to explore.  Is this a workshop , fast travel location or an unmarked location?
---
so report them
---
Take the names out. This sub has rules against witch hunting, sadly.

Sure, it will only cost 500 atoms.

Unable to shoot enemies from third person mode while in power armor (tried with t-60 and ultracite) and using a Tesla rifle with charging barrel (I think that’s what it’s called, sorry servers are down and can’t double check the name, basically the barrel that lets you charge up a round before firing by holding down the trigger). From first person mode, enemies get hit and die appropriately, but when in third person view something weird happens to the power armor and can never land a shot. Power armor appears to be underground? Even rapid fire causes the same issue. See video for a better understanding. 
---
I do not have any other version of the Tesla rifle, so I am not sure if the problem is caused by the weapon itself or from the charging barrel mod. 
---
Thank you. That should help a lot.
---
Yeah I knew that pipe revolvers don't have legendaries but I thought the pipe pistol did have though
---
Just an unmarked location and Easter egg :) 
---
Most of them don't want a fair fight. They want someone they can stop on. Additionally, they're griefers because they are bothering people who want no part in what they are doing.
---
I've encountered one also.
---
Charlestown Station area is a random spawnpoint too.
---
The novelty and AP cost wore off so I replaced mine with reactive plates to help deal with the beaters.  Found a second jetpack mod though, keeping it in storage for now but will probably put it on a another frame at some point.
---
There is another copy of the TNT Dome 2 key that can be found at the Mount Blair Trainyard. No idea how or if it connects to any of the stuff you have discovered, but I found it there.
---
Bizarre.
---
i'm not god tiered or anything but i'm no slouch. i can two/three shot everything i've come across so far except a scorchbeast or the 2 level 91 glowing deathclaws i've fought, and i've survived them all. 
---
Maybe one of those vaults is full with woobies like that vault in FO3  full with gary's. "gaaarrryyy" 
---
Once I got into the role-playing mind set, it was way more fun. I was already having fun but I felt like something was missing. I love role playing as a Wasteland Medic. 
---
Very true on that.
---
yep, I had that exact thing a month or so ago. I reported my screenshots to bethesda
---
It depend on what the item is. There is serval world spawn times. Here is the list of different timers I have discovered. I’m 184 and a lot of hours and farming in. Different Items in the world have different timers.
---
Here are the Respawn timers 
---
15 Mins
---
30 Mins
---
1 Hour
---
20 Hours
---
24 Hours
---
36 Hours
---
I would be alright with it if my turrets actually did something, and if I could actually have turrets without sacrificing the design of my house.
---
AWOL Armaments? 149 here and never seen that! Is it a BoS event? Been grinding them but literally the past 5 events have all given me T51 parts..
---
If you compare just the legendary effects, no. That fire effect is pretty meh. But hold on. The 10mm SMG itself is actually a pretty good weapon. By itself now it might look uninspiring, but fully modded it is surprisingly durable, deals ok DPS and is very lightweight for what it brings. Plus, 10mm ammo is cheap to craft for the amount you get. 
---
I use it to save my better weapons when resource gathering in low level areas, and a panic swap if my weapon breaks mid fight. I used to use a .50 cal for that, but then I realized the 10mm is cheaper to repair, make ammo for, and can be modded to pierce armor, which a .50 cannot. Plus on my build the .50 does 40 damage, and the 10mm does 42. And it has gunsights. This doesn’t mean it’s better than a .50, just that it’s not actually too much worse than one.
---
Your mileage may vary. 
---
Not always.  You can sell somethings like Screws, Springs, Fiber Optics, Gold loose ... you only need to bulk some stuff to sell it, like rubber, cork, bone, leather, and such.
---
Although glad you caught them and all, you should probably submit a ticket through Bethesda rather than posting their gamertags on here. Fairly certain that could be construed as witch hunting.
---
People drop better legendaries after farming whitesprings than I have ever found. 
---
Had to buy my decent guns. 
---
Just buy them from Enclave or cheap from a player.
---
Do the restoring power to Poseidon plant about 3 times.  Each time you complete you get a new and better generator one.  Eventually you get the Fusion generator.  
---
Irony!
---
More duping patches?
---
i think assassin was big at the time i was raiding but that was never a style i could get behind. Combat did slightly less DPS but was worlds more fun to play. 
---
There was a level 88 at camp McClintock last night over weight with 100's of guns shooting at and grieving lower level players that were going there. Once his bounty reached a healthy 600 or so caps, I went and killed him. Lol. Then just hung out there giving him shit till he left. Explosives weapons don't mean much when you're geared for them and run a melee build. 
---
I'd save that Fatman to go level some Whitesprings turret camps/greifers camps!
---
Regular pipe guns and bolt action can be legendary
---
That would be perfect.
---
Sadly? So you think witch hunting is something positive?

Had this long thing written up then I re-read your post. 4 hours is the average for world respawns. Though it seems there are categories for them and some have a 1 day lock out.  Work around can be, but not always 5-6 server hops. I haven't tried this on static weapons, just on plans and mods. But I will say when doing fort venture I take the minigun and after a few hops I see it back on the table. But I will not say for 100% that you will experience the same with the 10mm as I have not ever farmed it like that.   
---
Yeah, my advice is go power armor.
---
The fact that I don't is probably the main reason I die alot. 
---
They know you’re pocket padding. I don’t care if it’s been “patched out” white spring has -1 tolerance for all glitches, ghouls and god damn Gary shooting the high fashion vendor for not having a top hat, killing me and my 300 adhesive in my inventory.

 It’s called beer, buffout and bradstag.

Cool thanks for your help
---
Not sure if witchhunting is allowed here, but no one really cares.  Not sure the purpose of reporting them, youtube is filled with the tutorials with the screen names showing in the videos, if the developer wants to address it they could start there.  No indication the glitch is what is effecting server performance.  Most of the times I have been on bad servers there have not been users together.  The glitch requires their anchors stay on the same server.  On PC when the primary glitch method was patched there was a reported increased in server problems.
---
I think random spawn Deathclaws should always drop a legendary considering their one of the strongest enemies way less common than the other fall outs or at least maybe a weapon/armor plans
---
Scientific answer (from reading posts on here and in game experimentation.) It's a total clusterfuck.
---
i had heard that the more people that show up the more HP she has (and maybe armor/damage??) and that if you aren't strong enough to carry your weight you make the event harder for everyone. 
---
Never had proof so fale
---
You need to remove usernames, it's against the rules as potential witch hunt incitement
---
South Eastern part of the map where the mire starts to go into cranberry bog, there’s a turquoise building called RobCo Research Factory.

If all your steel is bulked and you have mods, it will use mods when you craft.
---
Don't bulk your steel.
---
That's almost a fact.  Any scumbag can pick up a PS4 or Xbox and ruin everyone else's experience in that, but a PC owner usually has to build the PC or spend enough money to buy a prebuilt one to be able to enter the game.  Not saying that PC players are all saints, but overall they are a better group of people.
---
It needs to shoot like fallout 3 mirv
---
&gt;Endgame gear progression have been completely overlooked and random loot is a stopgap until something better gets implemented. Or so I hope.
---
I will say on certain mountain ranges, I'M LOOKING AT YOU SAVAGE DIVIDE, I will get to it and then fast travel to the opposite side. 
---
I load up everything and travel to vendors and sell it. The rest of it after all the vendors are cleaned out i just drop or put back in the stash for next time.
---
It’ll be back up within the next 48 hours. 
---
Same but ps4
---
Think the plan's for the medium generator are found in one of the overseer's stashes. Or possibly a reward for claiming a workshop. I do know I've never done any power plant events but have had them for a long time.
---
Fale is a fail.
---
If you're bored, you can actually recreate the first described method post-patch, so... do some science. :)
---
Well I guess it's not a bad idea of you want a tell solo game
---
Which system are you in?  This is not a good sign. Looks like the fix for duping is not working 
---
I mean he has pictures... so it’s not like it’s a witch hunt anymore.

You can trade other players for serums, you can get them as low as 500-1000 caps if you check out trading subreddits.

If you are on xbox, you can report it and they can ban his comunication and online play.

These kinds of habits?

Really? Care to share the math please 
---
Depending on your build, there's 2 approaches. On my melee char, I got all mutations, then started taking them off. This way, you're guaranteed to have the ones you want, and you hope to take off the ones you don't want. Seems to work better.
---
Conversely, if you only need a few, as soon as you hit "this is good, I'm just missing one" condition, STOP. Don't get greedy. I know the temptation to go for "just one more" is strong, but don't, because you'll get something horrible and entirely wrong for your build, and in attempt to remove it will lose something essential. As soon as you get a "mostly good" list, STOP, and either buy a missing serum from Enclave, or from players (cheaper). 
---
do any of the power plants events.
---
He might need some rounds for his gramma gun
---
I think I just might do that.

Slap a MIRV on that bad boi and get to work.

Take a nap, take some NyQuil, eat a bagel.

Been using a Furious Death Tambo and I really can't see much more dmg from the furious effect lvl 20 atm and spent a good minute whacking a lvl 63 super mutant with mine. I think it might be another garbage effect at this point
---
My friend tamed a mirelurk, and now he's patrolling the roof of his base.
---
Yea, but if someone has been there already, you have to server hop to get the weights.  Ore is player based, not instance based, so if someone mines an ore node, it doesn't stop another player from mining it.  
---
hahahaha you made me crack up with the last bit.

May Atom bless you.

HEY I KNOW YOU!

Sorry, I just wasn't able to hop on last night; I wasn't even at my computer for the whole latter half. I'm in the middle of a ton of wedding planning at the moment. Sorry about that.

Yeah, I need t-51b too. It's been hell trying to get it. What have you been trying for it? I've been mainly server hopping vendor bot phoenix and doing brotherhood events when they pop up.
---
I'm level 133 and my strongest legendary is a anti armor Gatling plasma. Have yet to get a tse or even decent explosive weapon. 
---
Make sure to remove those names in your post and in the screenshots. This is (some might say unfortunately) not the right place for so called 'which hunting'. Take what you have and report it to bethesda directly. It won't do anything here.

Anyways, thanks for taking actions against that filth!

&gt;After a week of your nice camp getting destroyed and being unable to place the blueprint, i resorted to the 1x1 foundation with a ladder going up 3 flights to a sky base
---
Yeah, I totally get it. That was my second CAMP style, after I discovered that cute bungalows absolutely, positively cannot be relocated via blueprint. Moving to Flatwoods and away from spawn points allowed me to build a fairly elaborate cute bungalow. I just wish the whole CAMP system worked in a way that didn't force players to build the floating platforms.
---
I dont get whats the fun with duping. I mean if u have everything in large amounts. Then you dont have any  goal anymore.  For example i run low on stinpacks, i have to visit locations and search for them. Or i run low on 5mm ammo, i need to search for gunpowder,  lead scrap and steel scrap.
---
For me duping is ruining your own game experience. 
---
Use 3 star tank killer and 1 star in each of the commando perks. The 2nd and 3rd ranks of commando only give 5% each, whereas the 1st rank gives 10%.
---
Because I have a ten perception build and it's the perk that's anti armor on rifles
---
Heading there to check it out tonight. Thanks!
---
Lemme get some of that ammo
---
The same reason armies and fighters and terrorists in poorer countries use weapons that are cheap and not as high quality.
---
They are cheap and easy to get a hold of.
---
Ok seriously tho I can answer the team thing yes. Once u engage with one guy on a team they all are available for full damage. Revenge is still flagged and spawns you nearby. (In theory) ignore is you remove yourself from eligibility possibly choose a spawn? (theory) idk what other option is unless it for sure let's you choose your spawn.

Damn, I'm literally just starting up a roleplay community on PS4. Already have enclave and responders.

I've read that action boy and lone wanderer don't stack their AP regen effects very well. But Lone Wanderer helps with defense so you make just want to use that.

---
It's randomized. I got Fusion Generator on my first completion. I still don't have Large Generator unlocked.
---
There are some defensive locations in the game like the tunnel system under the road south of bogtown or various houses, trains, barns, caves, and cargo containers. 
---
Also, experiment with snapping concrete block foundations to the ramps of the concrete ramp foundations. It might be possible to create a mini bunker in certain ditches, ravines, and depressions. 
---
If you're working with a small footprint, keep workstations and other camp items stored when you're not actively using them.
---
I am not on discord but a lot of people are recommending it. The only thing is unless your world is empty or none of the other players want to join in you are in the same situation. I don't even mind the lower levels if they focus on the mobs. It is when they keep running in front of me and not helping with the ground enemies.  Thanks for the advice!
---
That’s a big rip
---
I'm doing a mutation build and unfortunately I did get Herbivore...I might retry later, but I've adapted. Corn is great. Make it into Corn Soup and that covers both your food and water significantly. I also love Cranberry's since you can cook them into a tart (not sure the name, maybe cobbler) and it gives you a 5% exp bonus and only costs 1 cranberry and 1 wood. You can also eat diseased cranberry's without any worry. 
---
yes it is

I'm a melee build, recently went 2H, found a Executioner's Super Sledge\* Level 50.
---
Just got a TSE Gatling Gun on the weekend, first legendary non-melee weapon I've kept. The thing hits like a truck, since I'm melee I don't have any heavy weapon peaks, but Adrenaline stacked fully, still hits really hard. Finally found a reason to use my gunpowder, heh. Working towards getting a sight put on it, need to farm Gatling Guns. 
---
I got the Super Sledge off a SBQ, and the TSE Gatling from Whitesprings. Most other legendaries I've picked up went straight to the vendor. 
---
Seeing as how some of the stuff you said isn't even true? 
---
I know that spot ... I used to live on that spot.  Just south of the big fountain?
---
Thanks for the info! I haven't gotten around to testing it myself.

OOPS. I *did* do that quest (for some reason I thought Perfect Storm was the missile launcher). The quest is "Cold Case." Go to the water park (way up north), and speak with Miss Annie to start it.

So with the Advent of cross platform on rocket league, I wonder if other games will get the benefit of cross platform play

I've literally had no one fuck with my base and it's not exactly hidden. Same with all my friends (XB1). I was picked on a little when I started the game, but have not had any problems since then.

I've only attacked people's bases that are farming in Whitesprings.

But we all float down here.

more delusions. lol the only time i see google or youtube fallout content is when i'm trying to figure out why shit is broken again. i can play a buggy-as-fuck, underdeveloped game. it's better than all the other non-content out there (FPS reskinning across all FPS games is rampant, all that shit looks the same now.)
---
I like to let them hear me coming as I charge them in my excavator armor before I open fire with an explosive handmade. 
---
And THEN I remember to turn off pacifist mode. By that time they've either surrendered or disconnected. 
---
I've seen at least one corpse that was wearing a 76 jumpsuit
---
I had a Sierra Bravo visit my camp once. Wasn't even worth the trouble to deal with so I server hopped. I don't have time for that garbage.
---
Just to clarify I mean that respawning in the same server may take 12-24 hours if it happens at all. But if you check all the places then leave world and join a different server they might not have been picked up there yet. If they arent there serve hop again til you find a fresh world that hasnt been heavily looted yet.
---
Back up for me!

Indidnt delete anything.... not sure what you are talking about.

Plz don't hurt am not smart

just wait until your armor disappears. sit

As far as I can tell,  but the concrete stairs use almost no budget 
---
I mean the lore from before the war.
---
mmm this seems to fix it. But If I equip the card again it works? Or the card is bugged atm?
---
Then u put the T-51b set in your stash and never look at it again. Unless u have friends over 😄
---
Confirmed

Excavator is at the botton left of map, near the big chainsaw machine thingy. Have to have a LOT of springs and screw though. Like 150? X01 is from the enclave quest line. I got it for completing the quests line and then getting 10 commendations. The bunker in whitesprings has MODUS, which gives you the plans to make the X01. I followed a couple of vids on youtube for that... took a good 5 before i found the ones without the verbal onslaught of bs.
---
Also... the enclave questline gives you access to nuke launching. Best to follow vids on that, as opposed to X01 armour searching etc.
---
Why are dupers abandoning stuff? I haven't been on since December because my friends had quit and I just haven't picked it back up and one of my friends got in on the early duping and I ended up with his excess resources, meds, and some weapons. My stash is filled to 1k and I probably have another 1k on me. Should I be worried?
---
I took the marsupial in the toxic area to the north of whitespring. Just server hopping a bit :)
---
Makes sense, if you have a alt that is heavy from duped shit, you can't fast travel.
---
I think it's your opinion. Mutations can be very good in combo. Btw this is not a fix for sure.
---
You don't know what witch hunt means 
---
this exact thing happened to me when i stayed at  my parent's house for xmas.  found two old rolls of duct tape in my old closet, immediately texted my friend about the little "Oh!" moment I had ;)
---
Dammit I think they're duping in one of my favorite camp locations in the whole game.  Now it is forever unclean.
---
Awesome, thank you, I’ll be heading there after work this evening
---
The only reward you get in this game is getting all your caps taken away for both killing other players and dying when they shoot you. Stupid af. I don't wanna be done with this game but I just dunno
---
&gt; You need to remove usernames, it's against the rules as potential witch hunt incitement
---
Yes, by all means lets protect the ass-hats who're ruining this game.
---
Nuked whitespring 
---
It's Xbox from the button prompt, which means the patch is today. 
---
You need a minimum of 2 people in the group for this to work :)
---
Me too!
---
Yeah the turrets are absolute shit.
---
I think you really should get rid of your advice about bulking. It's a really, really bad idea. ( Lot of stuff takes more space when bulked. Also the game scraps mods before bulk, so you will lose every mod that way)
---
TLDR : Beginners : Do. Not. Bulk.
---
Confirmed. 
---
I highly doubt it as it would remove cross- platform competition and people would have no incentive to buy either
---
You gotta server hop for that? 
---
I meant AI enemies
---
take your e-flexing somewhere else loser nobody cares

Challenging one person to pvp brings in the entire team (great for ambushes), however, if someone chooses to seek revenge then it is only between the person wanting revenge and the person that killed them. The team is no longer involved until the person seeking revenge has damaged the other person. If you choose to just respawn after getting killed then there is no pvp and you have to start it over again if you choose to. If someone is wanted then anyone can do full damage to them, including team members, however a wanted person cannot fight back against a teammate (I think that is incredibly stupid). I've come across a weird bug only a handful of times where hunting a wanted person, for whatever reason I did slap damage to them. Only a few minutes of chasing them was I able to do full damage. That's only happened maybe 3 times out of 40 so I would assume it's just a dumb bug
---
This is beautiful, although on the flip side of this there are people who find random player camps for the sole purpose of reducing them to rubble and scrap. So just be wary about showing your camp off too much. So far I haven’t had anyone bother my camp in all my time of playing but I’ve heard horror story’s so just be careful out there
---
I usually blink with my headlamps facing the dropped loot
---
2 including me? Cause I'm playing with a friend now. (We're 2)

It’s because the Xbox one X is the most powerful computing system in existence to date.

It’s essentially the power of the IBM Summit in consumer form.

You can’t really expect a ps4 or a pc to have equivalent performance with their inferiority 
---
You mean the turrets that do jack shit?
---
I was like that when at your level. Then I realized I need to bump up my ttk. Focus on a weapon group and max the perks as soon as possible.

Been playing since launch. Going on 300 hours. Saw my first living cat this morning just before the patch dropped.
---
What, you think he made-up those screen-shots?
---
It's worth noting here that a few junk items can't be bulked but are heavy and can end up taking up a lot of stash space without management. Asbestos, Fibreglass, Circuits, Crystal, Fibre Optics, Gold, Silver, Antibac and probably a couple more I am forgetting. I set myself (admittedly fairly arbitrary) limits for these things and sell all excess on (generally a cap a piece). If I need more of a specific thing for crafting then I get them as and when. Unfortunately gunpowder can't be sold or that would be another chunk of space freed up at a profit
---
20's top of the world, 30 to 40 free states and BOS.   
---
Yeah, me too.  For me the creativity aspect is missing. That's a thing I really love about Fallout 4. I've been able to build my world, move people around it and explore it and the modders have massively enhanced that experience by giving it so much flexibility. You can make the game you want to play, within limits. In FO76, what little creativity you are allowed, is not reliable and can be easily smashed up by Griefers etc. I haven't played the earlier ones.  
---
You have 80k weight as well...surely you are part of the problem as well yes?
---
From what I’ve seen it’s good against larger groups of weak enemies.

Telephones DO NOT contain screws or springs. They have plastic, copper, and circuitry.

East Coast USA 
---
ah gotcha, i would just copy their list and update it in that case
---
You don't really think about it. I wouldn't have until I experienced it. You have to be extremely deliberate with your shots and when someone just hops in front of you, it is very aggravating. And you don't even have to be close to me. With all shotgunners maxed out, enforcer, and explosive rank 4, my shotgun does 1047 damage. It kills enemies in 1 shot at long range now. It is insane. I can 2 shot a mirelurk queen at a distance. So when it bounces back on me at close range, i die every time.
---
I was able to launch a nuke around late 40s. 
---
Use all the +%xp the game gives you and work on your dmg. Levelling is *too* fast in this game IMO.
---
T60 requires fuck all to repair
---
Oof. That’s what I was worried about. There’s been no word of duped since Bethesda started banning accounts actively, I was hoping it was due to the patch fixing it. Guess I can hope. 
---
Been a lot of talk about stash's and carry weights being looked at by beth. Whether or not they do check and whether or not they do take action is unknown to me. But to those who are invested into the game somewhat, clearly it was enough to spook them into dropping everything. Looking for group today had ridiculously priced stuff. I saw a dude selling serums for 2 caps...
---
It’s back. Thanks for eating that bagel 
---
Yeah you people are what makes the game stressful to play socially or publicly. There’s incentive to hide your camp and not stay there too often because people with nothing better to do just like to fuck other people’s hard work over. 
---
4gb
---
Blackbird paint but that's atom shop only
---
But aren't you going to want to play when the next update comes with new content? I would hold on to your stuff as you may regret giving it away.
---
Same problem here, deleted a couple screenshots and it worked. Think it's a bug.
---
Any weight over 10k on a character gets inventory deleted per Bethesda sources also banning people who post glitch videos mostly the duper videos. I met a few the other night dropped like 30k of weapons chems junk armour all kinds of stuff. I made a mule character just to pick some of it up.

The game client keeps freezing on load in.  Sometimes it freezes when the screen is black as it's fading in, but mostly it's freezing just before or just after I gain control of the character.  I have to close the client via the task manager in Windows.  
---
This was happening early December but somehow fixed itself.  I was under the impression Bethesda had somehow already addressed this issue, but I guess I was wrong?  I'm currently just outside of Charleston after fast-travelling to the capitol building, if that's of any help.
---
at the time I server hop cause you could take a mutation on a server with 30 minutes cooldown. My route was
---
- Safe n' Clean Disposal
---
- Wrong mutation
---
- Radaway / Whitespring Service Entrance (for rad shower)
---
- Server Hop
---
Hope it will help you ^^
---
This reply is way late, but I'm surprised I can't find any other discussion of this gun. I've run with my explosive tesla rifle for a couple weeks now and I don't see any bugs. And it seems to benefit from all the rifle perks just fine, but yeah, there's no arcing.
---
BUT there is some hidden potential in this gun. You mentioned trying the standard and charging barrels, but you missed one. Charging shotgun barrel. It fires an spread of explosive shot very much like a shotgun, but perk-wise, it still counts as a rifle. And even when firing without charging it up, it does pretty good damage. Nothing game-breakingly awesome, but at close-medium range it 1-2 shots most normal max level enemies.
---
You should make a post on this sub about your experiences! Bethesda should be more aware of their FULL audience! Plus I’m sure people would love to hear what wacky scenarios you’ve been in.
---
I'm laughing so hard at this bc I bought it and defended it so hard. Then career took off and I decided to build a pc......I have seen the light. Unfortunately, had already preordered 76 on console, but if they get their poop together they can have my money a second time for pc. Lol. 
---
I dot get any of them...very rarely i get something. i pick up all the letters/holotapes tho
---
Bad dog!
---
Hey man its back up lol
---
1200 Atoms for dog helmet level 1
---
+600 atoms per-level max 5
---
+800 paint dog helmet Blue
---
Yeah pretty much. And since they come straight out the vault, they're untouchable under level 5 so can haul shit loads.
---
I’m not trying to witch hunt - in fact, my characters often wear the witch outfit my wife makes &gt;.&lt;
---
Seriously though... I’m also not good at all at editing photos, especially on the phone.  I’m just trying to post the proof I was able to get.
---
This game is riddled with all kinds of stupid rules and mechanics to make it less fun
---
Thing is you have to build the X-01. You aren't given a suit of it like the others. Once you unlock access to the Command Center in the Enclave bunker there is a computer terminal to the right of the vendors. There you will find the schematics for the prototype X-01 power armor.
---
This is obviously duper’s. Why should the OP be required to remove the gamer tags. This is not a witch hunt, this is clearly duper’s.  If the mods remove this post then they are effectively helping people to dupe by suppressing info. This is clearly duping. 
---
WestTek and Grafton Steel, too.
---
The Super Mutants at Grafton Steel are low level, but for some reason they don't ever seem to stop respawning sometimes...
---
Too bad we can't move objects like in FO4, could've played around a bit more...
---
I had that happening Sunday night
---
Some players make some elaborate camps. If you blew up mine yeah maybe I’d lose 15 wood and some odd metals out of it but some people build camps for *weeks*. With the amount of stuff in those camps, you’re making them lose a hell of a lot more than a bit of scrap
---
Yeah to most of your questions yeah. From what I remember, when you die you get three options. Ignore, which will boot you back to normal play, and I think ignores that player. Revenge, stay an enemy to said player, though can't remember about respawn, I think same as ignore, but without the other player being ignore.
---
If you PvP one player in group, whole group will turn enemy towards you.
---
I honestly don’t understand duping. Tse weapons drop reasonably enough, aren’t required to queen farm, and are irrelevant of melee builds which compete for the same experiences in game without issue. 
---
Junk is abundant everywhere you go. I’m constantly dropping bulk shit because I don’t have room. 
---
25k caps takes 18 days of vendor farming maximum, and is achievable much faster by vendor farming and silo or defend farming. Among other things. 
---
And what exactly is everyone stocking up for anyway? There’s nothing to do in this game. Hurr durr I have 80 explosive two shot anal beads just waiting for the big content release where they’ll be relevant! Like, what? Why. 
---
The dupe fix only stopped one method. Dupers gonna dupe.
---
this is mostly great advice, however in certain areas, the molerats and other burrowing creatures will pop up inside your camp if your growing crops inside.  Then u will need a turret inside, which makes growing inside kinda defeat the point.  however this is location dependent, some locations do not spawn molerats or radscorpions as enemies. you have to build camp to find out as far as i know.
---
Does he weigh as much as a duck?
---
All of the Cobalt at Whitesprings is between the resort and the nuclear disposal facility to the north. If the nuke reaches up there there's actually a solid amount, I believe I managed 3 flux worth last run.
---
Everything can be scorched, it seems. I've seen scorched bots near Watoga. 
---
They were providing them at the door, all are included! :D
---
Yeah I loved the big basket full of skellies for "reloads"
---
Save caps, claim workshops then do local events and explore until workshop is overrun. Then go back, reclaim and then get an immediate defend. Also, lots of quests are generated by entering areas, like playing music on those roofs down south or the 3 juke boxes in the town near Gad. 
---
Level 15 to 20 was really rough for me, but 20 to 26 or so was much faster. 
---
They fixed the duping yes, but with one fix comes a new one so don’t expect the servers to he fine.
---
Still good though 
---
Criminals break rules, then what happens? They lose their rights to benefitting from the rules...😉
---
This is awesome.  But are all of these actually in the game?  As far as I know you can't build a mounted deathclaw head.  Are these just out of the files regardless of if they're in the game yet or not?
---
I know its a old post but came across this while looking for info on some other stuff. It is in the droptable for events for savage divide. It might have been a lootable item during beta. Some cosmetics were lootable in beta but are event only now. The drop chance is really low though.
---
This is why famous drug addcits tell you to stay in school 
---
Definitely gonna use those robots to full effect in future, any griefers and I’m running straight to the sentry bot lol
---
That's something a duper would say.
---
You know you're not playing enough fallout when you think that desk fans give you springs. 
---
It's not a witch hunt if you have concrete evidence.
---
I feel the same for Atlas tbh so I can't judge you too hard. But eh I didn't spend 60 dollars on it and the amount I spent didn't go to Bethesda
---
Hey u/lil_murderdoll,
---
Thank you for the great suggestion. I'll pass this request along and see what I can find out. 
---
Growing it yourself is ideal, but you can find some at the Sunday Brothers Farm (right next to Harpers Ferry). There is also Tato, Raizor Grain, and Mutifruit there (and ocassionally Power Armor spawns in the shed with the workbenches). There will be a few enemies to clear out, but generally they aren't too bad.
---
No muties allowed though
---
After the last patch  I made some new nuka grenades and they had a much lower damage level than the they used to have and were listed apart from the the old ones in my inventory, but that I mean I had two sets of nuka grenades in my inventory list, one of the pre-patch and one of the post patch with the different damage value.
---
You really screwed this one up bro.
---
I loled
---
X1 as well I have 300 hrs+. Happened for first time Sunday night.
---
Can confirm, it's fun.
---
Exactly! All the projectiles should continue at the same trajectory but instead it acts like the flare where there is some kind of max distance that just stops it and drops it. 
---
Partecipate the events and claim workshop.   
---
You can go to Whitespring and find some high level players that help you with ghouls (level 40-62); you hit the enemy and the other player finish him and you obtain 100-120 exp.   
---
Level 20 to 50 are frustrating but you have a lot to explore   
---
Sadly all the dupe bugs are not fixed just more complicated
---
Some of them have been. Plenty of comments from them about not knowing how this should go. 
---
I see you know the spot 
---
You’re right. The game can spawn creatures on the inside of your camp on the ground. To me this only happens when I’m there and I can just kill them. 
---
The more complicated the better.
---
They don't use the duped items themselves. They sell them for IRL money.
---
Meanwhile I just want to have a pet liberator

You're overestimating how much it takes to repair stuff. You dont rebuild it from scratch, you repair it with 1, maybe 2 of a material. Some things, like turrets, use multiple materials but they still only require 1 of each. You're not losing much at all, it's better than us hunting you down and taking all your caps isnt it?
---
Because the English language lost its 2nd person plural pronoun during the transition from Old English to Modern English, which is stupid and in no way an improvement; because *y'all* is a mutually intelligible substitute that would have been adopted into standard English by now if it weren't for regional prejudice and semi-educated fools who erroneously think that their ill-informed posturing against the use of *y'all* makes them look sophisticated; finally, because *fuck y'all that's why.*
---
On xbox so the switch is harder but yes I will look into alts for the less combat support cards.
---
This area is like level 5-25 I am level 130, nothing I can't handle. If you look at the album of images you can see the one pic of the building where the only mobs that attack are.
---
I gotta say that I really appreciate you getting right to the point in this video.  I can't stand when the first 30-90 seconds of a video is the creator talking about their channel, their Instagram, their Patreon, asking for likes/subscriptions, etc.  It's a huge pet peeve. 
---
 You got straight to the point without any bullshit.  I subbed to you on that basis alone.  You are now the 3rd Fallout-related channel I'm subscribed to.  I'll check out some of your other vids too.
---
There are multiple dupe glitches. Some of them have been patched. Some haven't. The current one involves making a team from lobby. Maybe it isn't new, but it's def more widespread amongst people that follow a certain duper youtuber's discord
---
I said I grabbed stuff and then destroyed it.  You can see some of the ammo I’m carrying.  I use big guns almost exclusively - if it’s not 50 cal or 5mm, I don’t carry over 100-200 of almost any ammo
---
lol dude he already mentioned those. thats why I didnt add them.
---
Its alright at least for lower levels
---
Has anyone got any proof of this other than that reddit post claiming it?
---
As the rules say:
---
&gt;No witchhunting. Do not ask users to go after other players in game and **do not accuse players of cheating**. Use Bethesda's official support page to report them here.
---
OP clearly broke this rule, but ofcourse some people here are going to defend it, just like how they defend this shitty game.
---
Is there a new hat for sale in atom store?
---
Honestly I was thinking about that.. and don't know if Bethesda would be able to implement the mechanic.  But coming from the understanding that legendary weapons were supposed to be that... legendary, and not a common loot.  Why not make it so that legendary weapons are a one and done style weapon?  That is that once broken, they cannot be repaired?     
---
Because quite honestly at the rate that they are found... they aren't that rare.  It'd also encourage people to use a large part of the game's mechanics. (actually craft things!)  Since crafted weapons would still be something that can be used/repaired.  
---
This would also have the added benefit of cutting down on the sales of said weapons... because let's be quite honest.  People will be far less to go ahead and just buy items for cash if they break down/cannot be repaired.
---
Just a thought!
---
I'm pretty sure you can. Because the last time I was there, there were 2 skeletons instead of 3. I placed myself on the empty one and swoosh. Idk if they patched it since. You couldn't go that far anyways.
---
I wanted to use punctuation but I was too tired to switch the phone keyboard to show them because it was the morning besides I know everyone can tell what I mean it’s not like you need punctuation to separate ideas or thoughts honestly who bothers to establish different tones in a paragraph it’s better to just run out of oxygen entirely and move on to the next comment otherwise you’re spending all your time typing and not reading and what’s life without diversity so you keep your little dots and symbols and I’ll keep being me

Snap a pic or two for us, I forgot to take the flight

Enemy players meant me with their tse guns
---
Holy shit you're a cunt.
---
Definitely worth testing. I can confirm that it's a pattern I have noticed, though I didn't think it was tied to specific servers.
---
gamepedia feels better to me, but that's subjective. 
---
I’ve tried giving things to people on Xbox..wave , jump but they run the other way..I’m only level 26 and wearing a ratty skirt...so I’m not scary looking but you’d think I had the plague or something...
---
Yeah exactly below 50
---
Honestly, why are they hoarding caps? To buy fucking what? They already have 52376 of the best guns they're gonna get, what else is there to buy?
---
...that being said, I'll give you 25k for those anal beads.
---
I was shopping for calibrated shocks, until I find some I’m living in my excavator P.A but there’s no rush lol, I kinda like the lottery rng of vendor shopping, maybe they’ll have one, maybe not, makes it more fun lol
---
Yeah I didnt list grafton steel because it seems really inconsistent for me, usually spawns gouls/ mutants
---
I always see players inventory when trading? I thought that’s how it works? 
---
I wouldn't be calling you out if it didnt
---
If they are perked out even with the explosives if it's not a sneak it won't one shot them unless I have all my perks set for it and low health. 
---
Had to remove 4 games over 175 g before it would update.
---
But running 2 systems? We have 2 Xbox and a ps4 but we both play games. What a waste of a console.
---
My only 3* weapon has been a furious laser Gatling, a gun I’ll never use 
---
I've been dividing my time pretty evenly between exploring and doing the main quest (and any side quests I come across). Levelling up has been pretty steady to be honest. I invested heavily in a melee build which means I get to plough through lots of enemies without too much trouble. Perhaps that's partly it.
---
Updates don't ban people.  
---
Text chat would be super helpful. Sometimes during long stretches between classes I play some fallout 76 in the library and I don’t wanna be the asshole on voice chat on a video game in a university library, but just yesterday there was a nuke launched at fissure site prime and I keep my camp right by there for exactly such occasions, but I couldn’t communicate to everyone that my camp was there if anyone needed beds/crafting/storage. Push to talk is a huge QoL improvement but text chat channels (maybe one global for the server and one regional, or even just server side text chat would be nice) would be the last thing the game needs with regards to communication
---
I do like evasion. Some of my favorite games were the Splinter Cell and Hitman series. Games where my love of sneak truly pays off.
---
Mines loading rn ill let you know if it gets stuck
---
Oh. Well you are calling me out for the mods removing it. I didnt delete anything bud.
---
Over 30 seconds and the page didn’t load, gave up. Maybe get a new host server?
---
Honestly with how glitchy this game is I'm surprised I haven't seen a jojo reference 
---
"Criminals"
---
One...pffff try three 
---
Well, I don't. So I don't give a fuck.
---
Might wanna read the rules a second time.
---
I know what you are saying you dont have to keep asking me that
---
Its shit like this why i Reddit. I hate videos and would rather read a wall of text.
---
Thanks dude, I have a power armour guide coming next, I got sick of the 15 minute shit too so I'm trying to keep my videos under a couple minutes with as much info as possible. Thanks for the feedback 
---
i built a fantastic camp at the site u are referring to.  i had water flowing through my kitchen and you had to climb the tree to get into my camp.  the constant spawn of rad toads outside was annoying sometimes, but you always have glowing meat, radtoad omlettes and radtoad legs (carry weight food).  with 2/3 missile turrets strategically placed the turrets will always handle the frogs before and real damage is done. ive had a few really great locations, this was one of my best builds.  
---
They can. It is possible to push ban waves during an update or patch.
---
Good video!
---
Would you mind sharing your build as well?
---
I was in this for the gramma gun pun
---
Some people were punished on PC for using a mod to access the developer room.  No one has been banned for duping, it is not all that clear the developer has a simple way to tell, to carry out the ban, or that it is even a ban-able offense.  Regardless if they have a way to detect it, one would thing they would start with the 4 or so people that post youtube videos with there gamer-tags showing.
---
Haha amazing! I really hope we cross paths on the wasteland at some point, No problem recognising you!!
---
This is the kind of thing I try to tell people who want to cry about "witch hunts". Dupers are not at ALL like a pair of friends hanging out at a camp. They are easily identified because their behavior is predictable. If it walls like a duck, quacks like a duck, and floats like a duck, then it's a witch.
---
Short answer is no.  They're independent.
---
This matches my gameplay,  exactly. 
---
I never change the responder get up so we might
---
Did your dream freeze, or get disconnected?
---
 If I remember correctly you can get the ore bonus by just equipping the excavator arms.
---
Is it? Why are you following me around on reddit? Nothing better to do?
---
Unfortunately from what i can tell it can't be bought, only crafted from the recipe... so unless I get lucky or find someone to make it for me, it's not gonna happen
---
Damn, maybe submit a bug report to Bethesda or PSN cause that's a big issue.
---
Is that cheating though? Sounds like a smart raider to me. 
---
You can’t take caps when you kill someone, at best you kill someone with a bounty and get 10 caps. They can always server hop and block people to get away from being killed over and over. Plus I personally play in pacifist mode so people trying to kill me just can’t do it before I’m able to leave and get to a new server. Have you ever considered just...ya know...not being a raging cunt to people who are just trying to have fun?
---
I went to the store to look at furniture. There was a picture of a desk setup with a vintage fan on it. I thought, "fuck yeah, screws and gears"
---
&gt; Why are you arguing this with me? I didn't make up the rules for this forum. Take it up with the moderators.
---
I mean... likewise?
---
I'm not ignoring that players are accused of cheating because, like witch hunting, the word accusation must not mean what you think it means. An accusation is only a claim. The OP goes beyond claims to an image of an actual event the OP encountered in-game.
---
Words are tough, but this is pretty clearly not matching the words you're trying to use.
---
8/hr up from 1/hr is quite the jump if that's true. This really spells the end of the game for anyone using the excavator power armor as well since it's a large, and desperately needed, boost to storage capacity.
---
Yeah they’ll do good dps, I have really good luck with and anti armor .50 and stabilized equipped. It’s all about getting through the inevitable armor and crippling her wings if possible. The cryolator will make her time on the ground extended and the syringer will reduce her DR by 25%.
---
I have seen the Chemistry Workbench on the lower level of Garrahan Mining Headquarters. Oddly enough on the Chemistry Workbench. I have seen it there 3 times.
---
imo the sights are worthless on gatling guns, the speedy receiver gives you a noticeable difference in fire rate and the drum mag helps out too. I have a 2* double gatling, so with the drum mag it holds 750-5mm before needing to reload and it has +50% limb damage which is pretty nice. 
---
&gt; Tse weapons drop reasonably enough
---
That may be your experience but not most peoples. Im 250 hours and only had one two shot weapon drop this entire time, much less TSE.
---
The problem is you’re exploring and not farming legendaries. No games of this design have end game weapons hidden about the world or as quest rewards. They all follow a simple model: Quests give you basic gear good enough to kill shit for better gear. 
---
Its a thing, happen to me yesterday, server re-rolled 4 times. Its a new duplication exploit. So once you get a Legendary you like, save and quit to the main menu.
---
I’ll follow all your posts and upvote them!
---
My experience has been that if you really want to get some good drops, make sure you are really far from your camp and only have 1-2 lbs of spare carrying capacity.  The game loves to dump legendary 20 lb guns on me at that point.
---
You do get caps for killing someone, I've never tested if it comes out of their own cap count but yes you do get caps for killing other players
---
I tend to keep most of my steel un-bulked; not sure if this happens to everyone, but when I would craft/repair with all of my steel bulked, the game would prefer to take steel from unused mods or other unscrapped junk (ie. Hallucinate canisters) before Bulk Steel
---
Server re-rolled, its a new dupe exploit, they force reset a server.
---
Sure they are independent but they can be pushed at the same time.
---
He turned me into a newt.
---
Ah I was not aware of the new method, the method I am referring too has seemingly been ignored. Although it is harder to pull off, it is highly annoying to see succeed when you're trying to play the game.
---
I fully support you feeling that way.  Then again, I'll still just wander in and look around...especially if you aren't there.   I love entering in through windows that are too close to beds and workstations, too.   I have no interest in harming your precious camp or you, but if I can leave you a surprise paperbag full of fertalizer to let you know I was there, that's a lot of fun.   Then again, I may look in my inventory and decide that I have too much other stuff and I may leave some other random stuff behind, too.   Enjoy my fertilizer filled sack.  Just be glad I can't set it on fire in the middle of your room.
---
I was in someone else's "locked / no ramp / no public entrance" camp last night.  I was in the middle of taking all their corn and dropping them a sack full of fertilizer and lots of other stuff when they disconnected.  (yeah that's the worst I'll do...  harvest your plants that'll just grow back and maybe take your purified water if you left those unlocked too. )   I was really disappointed that they left the game before finding out that their really well built impenetrable camp still had someone inside it. 
---
This is so depressing. I have a lousy combat shotgun that does 191 damage at level 70. And that's with all the shotgun perks. My armor isn't much better though I do have 2 pieces of Vanguard which helps, I think. I can barely kill a bloater and if there is more than one I'm toast. I can't survive nuke zones because of the packs of bloaters.
---
Everyone else is running around with the best guns, best armor, infinite ammo, 3 shot SBQ runs, one shot PvP if the slap is accepted, awesome recipes, infinite ballistic material, exact mutations they want risk free and apparently having a ton of fun.
---
What does an honest player get to do? Farm plastic. Make shotgun shells. Farm more plastic. Farm lead. Make shotgun shells. That's pretty much it. Oh, and pick pumpkins for Jack.
---
A newt!?
---
Haha. Its fine man. 
---
Grape menstats? That is the one for bartering.
---
I check the plans section, and brotherhood events have a chance to drop PA plans as rewards. I do those just because other posts here on reddit have people mentioning them as the way they got them.
---
my 2 missile turrets handle my camp pretty well on their own and all the mob spawns are level 50+ including a regular level 61 albino deathclaw.   i recommend placing ur turrets in more strategic locations, in which they can not be damaged by melee attacks from creatures.  Also my camp is set up on a cliff side so i really only get attacked from one direction.  turrets are generally not very useful in high level areas, but they can be if u set up ur camp in strategic ways.
---
Itll be fixed eventually.
---
Played on gamecube but yeah that was my first console "mmo" lol 
---
Fallout and TES games implicitly induces theft addiction lol
---
No. The dean was really random before that. I was walking through the woods, smoking a joint with friends, when we came upon a fenced in pool. A lady told me to put it away and I threatened to eat it because she wouldn’t have proof. 
---
I'm currently at level 85 and have excellent Explosive Weapons &amp; Perks, alone against 3 SBs is not a real Challenge, so my strategy with the SB Queen is to alternate between a TSE Handmade while she's in the air, and an explosive Combat SG when she lands, (I get in close for the Head Shots).
---
I am very high Sneak &amp; Perception Perks, so I can easily stay in Caution, and typically stay away from the crowd so it's easy to pick the mobs apart periodically.
---
These events tend to be total Mayhem, especially when a lot of lower level players show up, and I know they have good intentions but someone running in front of my Explosive SG is the only thing I really worry about.
---
Any luck my friend said he’s able to play 
---
Confirmed, Still consuming Savage Divide #4 on v1.0.4.13
---
I'll reply with a screenshot shortly, It's a heavy build because of my TSE 50 cal but it works with all heavy weapons minus the explosive damage perks
---
I had a dream I was one of the victims in the Alien movie .... the one that got the facehugger...
---
I woke up and thought to myself... “ I hope it’s a boy...”
---
I'm not 100% sure but I like to think bethesda will see a 375686/270 carry weight and realise somethings up. They know about the duping. And a carry weight like that is evidence enough but who knows. They could even take a look at the amount of TSE weapons that are identical and in circulation and do something about that. Hell, they could just nerf the shit out of them to balance the game out again. But who knows.
---
All opinions are null. PvP is broken. Mass duped TSE weapons have already saturated the economy. 
---
How long does being wanted last? Does it go away when you log out? 
---
Yea I agree especially since many have stronger rank 1 effects
---
Sorry for those of you that don't want to hear this, but I'm personally very excited for Player Vending to be added, yes for the vending, but almost more so for the dynamic of shops/raiders that it will add to the game. I'm sure some people will have great security, others not so much, but trying to figure out how to knock off these places will be a great new dynamic for those of us who are playing more on the chaotic-neutral/evil side (aka Raiders) of the game.
---
Also completely aware that Bethesda could add in some kind of preventative measures to stop people from PVP'ing or attacking player vendors, I hope they don't do this. Vendor Bot Phoenix has to deal with it, so why not actual players!?
---
Can I put this on Excavator armor
---
I always thought everything you put in there disappears on disconnect.
---
Plans weigh .25 pounds just learned this last weekend drop the extras
---
Actually I haven't named the Gatling Plasma yet, but I've named my .50 cal The Duece because it puts all other Ma Dueces to shame, and MG42 is the Buzzsaw.
---
Play more and this will happen.
---
You can try to justify it all you want by twisting words, but OP clearly broke the rule. End of story. Good bye.
---
Lot of reasons:
---
My bedroom is mine. Fuck you, get out of my bed 
---
I don’t want some asshole grabbing shit I dropped for a friend 
---
Hey dickhead, get off my tinker’s bench, I need to use it
---
Oh crap, I’ve got a bounty but need to do something 
---
Etc. 
---
I made a badass combat rifle for my friend last night after he gave me supplies.  Dropped it for him and it fell right through the floor........lame 
---
Scroll up a little and another guy is more informed than I am 
---
You sound confused about what your question was
---
You on XBOX ?
---
My game rarely freezes or disconnects. 
---
that doesn't mean it isn't working for others
---
Is there a reason to constantly pick up junk in those old games? lol
---
You should considerr nv with the settlement building mod.
---
I’ve put most of my perk cards into finding and making medical supplies, I’ve been waiting for this moment. Sign me up!! My Psn is TricksterGlitch
---
And uses the same ammo as your power armor.
---
i dont understand why they're all dumping inventory when the patch has been out a week on PC and it didnt remove anyones items or even stop the duping. 
---
Lead and aluminum are the only things that get lighter when bulked.
---
I guess what I meant was did they ban any dupers today along with the update... better? 
---
One question about this. So if I’m by myself and fighting a team of three and we all are engaged in PvP and no longer slap damaging each other and I kill two of them and they choose to respawn not revenge and I continue you fight the one left I was fighting can the other two deal full damage to me because it seemed like they could deal full damage to me but I couldn’t deal full damage to them until they attacked me. So I had to keep fighting the third one and hope one of the other two didn’t one shot me because I couldn’t seem to deal full damage to them. My guess is it reset the fight for them so I would do slap damage to them but because I was still actively fighting their teammate they could deal full damage to me. (Possibly because their teammate had damaged me before they died but not after they respawned but I had damaged their teammate since they respawned but I’m not sure)
---
Despite being baited into the fight and not quite understanding the system I enjoyed our little battle just wish I knew the exact rules. A couple times they respawned while I was still fighting one of them I would see one of the respawned ones sneaking up to me so I would turn to fire on them but deal next to no damage and it didn’t feel like it was working properly since I was fighting their team. 
---
Yea, I mean seriously... what were they thinking?
---
Juicehead on youtube parroted it back.
---
He did mention there's a duping community that is private and doesn't share the other methods because they're making mad money selling items.
---
Mostly pc though
---
My group and I call ourselves the ultracite knights and we kill the queen regularly. Minimum once a day if possible. We’re not really RP heavy if that’s what you’re after. If you’re interested PM me.
---
Two including you and afaik. Both need mutations
---
Ultracite scraps sell for a decent amount to vendors
---
Nice job! I'm still trying to figure out the stealth someone. The best I've seen was someone who was 100% invisible with not a trace of shimmer. I only knew they were their but the dust they kicked up as they walked. Last night I was tracking down a wanted player just south of the golf clubhouse and I was using chameleon gear AND a stealthboy, and was crouching, but they still saw me coming from about 30-40 feet away. I then charged them with my instigating super sledge and took them out once I landed a hit. I tried to give them back their junk but they didn't understand what I was trying to do and someone else ended up taking the junk, even though I was clearly indicating no, and then they gave me the heart emote which was nice.
---
In all I've collected about 6 bounties - it's turning into fun endgame content.
---
It usually is, but periodically I've gotten max level gear off of the legendaries there. Don't know if that's intended or if it's a bug.
---
Either way I have a level 35 bloody explosive double barrel and a level 35 furious exploding gatling gun I got from there. They may not be the best due to their level but they're still better than most max level guns I've found. 
---
I’d have stayed to watch him die and take his loot if he had any. 
---
That's great. Now, how about that damn cricket noise whenever one is in PA, will that setting fix that as well?
---
Sometimes I look at things on the street and wonder what scrap I would get from it. 
---
I too, would like to know.
---
I tried that as soon as I saw the buff to fireproof.  
---
Still died; although, again it was a 2 shot MIRV with T5 Demo Expert and adrenal reaction @ 10%HP (shot by friend with slap damage turned off)
---
There's plenty of word of duping if you look in the right places. The people who still know how to dupe are just quieter about it. Or they're full of crap. Not sure.
---
I was checking to see if the servers were back up, saw this near the top and couldn’t help but let out a little chuckle.  
---
You regularly post dumb shit on a public forum, why are you surprised this is happening to you? 
---
PS- I like your new angle where you pretend like you’re anti-duping because you’ve already acquired all the stuff anyway. It’s cute. Now you’re worried that you’re gonna get banned hahahahahaha.
---
I’ve had that happen when looting animal bodies 
---
Yeah this happens to me all the time! Every bunker or smaller building I randomly get stuck its not on the environment because I can just enter a door and boom no movement until I exit my Power armor. 
---
These instructions are incomplete. You need to go to the Nuka-Cola plant and read the related notes first otherwise the duffle bag at the Pylon won’t spawn. That was my experience, at least.
---
It’s not the hours played it’s the hours farming that matter. Going about exploring and whatnot your likely not going to get drops. Farming every nuke you see drop, uranium fever and awol etc. will get you drops eventually. My teams killed hundreds of legendaries for a handful of TSEs - I’m not saying it’s easy or fast just that’s it’s reasonable for a game like this.
---
Not on PC, but on consoles I do believe that can follow your gamertag around...according to people on this sub.
---
Yea!
---
My gamertag is Deathpool0000
---
Please send hateful messages 
---
Just thinking what other boards on Reddit could be where this would be a legitimate question gives me nightmare!
---
I do the same thing. Top floor is bedrooms. I only lock them and my generator room 
---
Yeah that was when I just had foundations, crafting stuff and some walls really - didn't care if it went boom. ;)
---
Any new camp items?
---
Nobody has been banned for duping people have had their accounts suspended for entering the dev room but not banned.
---
Most likely a pissed off teen or 20 something year old loser that can’t get a girl taking out their frustrations out in game. Someone is dominating their life and it’s their only outlet. Block and switch servers works for me.
---
I got two shots regularly and explosives regularly, but not once a hybrid from any of my drops. I had a decent Grognak's axe too but the furious one that weighs 1 just dumped on that. I see why people bought so many but it just makes the weapons you had before completely useless, especially in PvP.
---
I got better...
---
Probably just bogged down from so many people attempting to log in at once.
---
Right now base defenses are nothing but a drain on your base allottment. They don't work worth a shit.
---
Don't do it. Games more enjoyable without one.
---
A bug that takes less than 5 min to fix since it was caused by a typo and it had high visibility (i.e. was known since beta) and you have the gall to think they should have ignored it until now? Wow.
---
Yeah I’ve just tried restart my PS4
---
Great video.
---
I hate to say it but put in a short 5-10 second intro. "In this vid I'll show x". 
---
We're kind of conditioned to not be smacked with info in 2 seconds. 
---
ya it seems like its pretty easy to defend an indoor grow with melee, however ive gotten incredibly frustrated wasting tons of rounds on a low level molerat i couldnt target because of the crops growing blocking the shots lol.  maybe i should use explosives haha
---
There are witches!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLP1eenAj7U
---
Yes! Was wondering how to link these things up to create a viable locking door. Until now I'd been trying to use the terminal and switches. Thanks!
---
Seems like they should allow you to use the terminal to simply add on some sort of lock or hacking instead of having to finagle the system like this.
---
You're not alone man, I work at Home Depot... so it's like junk heaven being surrounded by springs, screws, duct tape, and every crafting component under the sun.
---
.....I was gonna play with you of you were down.
---
Not one. Pretty lame. 
---
I want a trident mod for it. 
---
Good job doing what you could to shut down duper’s and destroy their ill gotten gains. I just hope Bethesda recognizes that and doesn’t ban you for having been in possession of duped items. 
---
Fun fact, they now work... by making all living things within the radius of the user eminate the Detect Life pink fog effect from Elder Scrolls.
---
To be clear this works in such a way that you can see the pink fog effect that you are eminating even though you have not taken Berry Mentats, in addition to all the other living things within the effect radius around the person who did take them.
---
It is the dumbest shit.
---
Oh ok. Thanks.
---
No surprise. This is one of the reasons I stopped playing. RIP Fallout 76.
---
I doubt everyone did but quite a few people warned on Looking for Group that people's accounts were gonna get banned. Probably spooked a few people hauling alot. Stuff was getting sold really cheap today.
---
I got on
---
What does the bearproof trash can do? I've never been able to find info on this and the plan is always 800 caps.
---
Yeah my friends on aswell I just get stuck loading 
---
The game seems to have more loading screens now i went from one loading screen right into another then when in game i fast traveled an got  loading screens back to back.
---
Huh any time I tried it I went like an inch in the air and went oof 
---
Not necessarily true I met a guy who was in flat woods giving away ledgendries to players fresh out the vault.
---
Wow. That's an insane amount of stuff. I'll have to keep an eye out for stuff going on if things start getting jacked up.
---
That works too! I’m currently not home ATM but when I get there I’ll be ready
---
Fyi, games on ps4 require x2 the full install plus patch size. 
---
So if the game is 50gb and the update is 3gb you'd need 106gb space to update it.
---
Its basic error correction.
---
That would have been perfect 
---
Throw a warning about not spamming the craft button if you have any mods stashed that you don't want to accidentally convert into bullets.
---
&gt;but the cases were you're actually wasting plastic aren't that frequent.
---
Unless you like shotguns.
---
I could be wrong but that was my interpretation of the patch info. I am only wearing the T-51b and only put it on when I feel it's going to be necessary for battle so I don't use much power. The patch is installing now so I'll see. 
---
Also I found that if you have a comlete foundation with ground on the inside the game spawns a lot less creatures. 
---
‘this
---
It also implies a bad back end system. I think this more about server stability management instead of arbitrary design choice. This way, the server only needs to "think" once and assign blanket loot table instead of rerolling for every mob on every spawn - which will likely implode the server. 
---
Hang out at my camp. They fly over all the time. 
---
I know Jack!
---
I have never seen a witch quack a day in my life 
---
Don’t want opinions just want to know the rules. While mass duped TSEs change the parameters of PVP to a very uninteresting one hit kills if pvp is active it doesn’t change the rules of it. 
---
And in all honesty even if they get rid of all the TSEs, one hit kills will probably always be how PVP works. There is a reason why hard enemies are just sacks of HP in Bethesda games and it’s because players can deal so much more damage that enemies when attacking, so when a player fights a player they now use those high damage dealing attacks against a player that isn’t a sack of HP and will just kill them. 
---
So need to get a picture of that! But hey, the likeness is spooky! lol
---
https://imgur.com/iKPtblP
---
I think they will add things, not everything could be put in at the beginning. I do wish there was more to building though. More meaningful base defense, towns, sim neighborhood, wasteland edition. 
---
The new power armor paint is complete garbage
---
no surely i have not! i just did some of the north west of the sarting vault. and some more north and north east
---
Cool. You should appear offline though or these witch hunting little trolls that follow me around might join the game and try to destroy your base.
---
My brother has a big plastic pumpkin left over from Halloween that I want to scrap every time I go to his house. 
---
If you're on PS4 and have the mats I can make you a shielded armor that'll help a lot in nuke zones
---
East of Johnson's Acre. There are two lakes with streams leading down to Firebase Hancock. The western-most lake has a random encounter location at the stream.
---
The only traffic you should really get is from people running  level 45-50 Requisitions at the nearby radio tower.
---
You'll be under 10 caps fast travel away from Watoga station.
---
Weird. Reset ps4?
---
Looks like the old graphical bug from skyrim. Happens alot when water and land collide or when you look at water with a weapon out and the shadow is cast on the screen instead of the map.
---
Probably just Bethesda being Bethesda again. A game reset should fix it but if not try a hard reset of the console/pc
---
Sure, it's just annoying to deal with. Just curious what people are doing in this instance because it would be very frustrating to me which is why I haven't built anything of substance
---
Was wondering this too!
---
Right, but once again... I don't see a call to arms against those players. I see no harassment taking place. OP decided to investigate on their own accord and found exactly what they were looking for and recorded it.
---
Oddly enough, the definition you've given from Webster only matches the individuals in the thread taking the time to send off some ill will.
---
The way I've found to get them to notice the bag is....
---
1.  Make sure your weapons are NOT out, and give them a "friendly wave".  Then quickly drop a few items like stimpacks.
---
2. Step away from the bag about 3-4 feet.  Do the "come here" emote.  You may have to do this for a bit.
---
3. If they look confused, crouch repeatedly by the bag.  If they don't understand then, shoot the bag (this may cause them to run though).
---
4. Once they see the bag and get the stimpacks, they're much more likely to stick around for more gifts.  I usually drop piles in small amounts (stimpacks first, then rad meds, then water / food).  That way they don't get bored or think that you're done giving things out and move away.  I wait until the end to drop scrap, that usually takes a minute, but by then they've been "conditioned" to know that if I'm still here I'm probably dropping another pile.
---
Hope that helps!  Happy gifting!
---
Will do, for sure. Is that mod for XBox?
---
I get the same T-51 arm piece every BoS quest I do (minus technical docs) . The grind is real
---
He’s not accusing, he’s proving with photographic evidence that these are cheaters. Why are you ignoring that part? Maybe because you’re a shitty cheater too? Birds of a feather. 
---
Where have you explorered?
---
The story will take you north then south. 
---
Toxic valley up north should have more quests. Don't go south yet though.
---
Explore the forest, you'll unlock quests when you find points of interest.
---
What it would seem is your pvp with them was reset to non hostile, however since their teammate was still alive and fighting you it made you hostile to them. The only way I can think for you to fight them was for their teammate to shoot you (the one you didnt kill) and that would reset their status to hostile for you since it would drag in the entire enemy team. I havent come across this tho, there should be no way for someone to do full damage if not in pvp. I dont know the situation but there is no way for only one person in a pvp fight to be hostile and the other neutral except for if you or they were wanted. I have come across situations where a team member was engaged in pvp with another player but they were neutral to me so I couldn't do full damage to them. Maybe it was a bug or maybe something was different that you didnt notice. However if you kill someone and they choose to reason and not seek revenge then they will not be hostile to you until you and one of their teammates return fire on each other and basically reset the conditions for engaging in pvp, or if you and the person that respawned return fire on each other
---
He doesn’t understand. 
---
How do you know he was duper? Maybe he picked up, not knowing that these were duped items.
---
I actually have to say.. don't go for the MIRV launcher.   
---
Surely it has more damage in total, but also a higher chance of missing a shot or even miss completely.   
---
The MIRV only flies for like 50 meters and then stands in the air, dropping down 6-7 smaller nukes who all do 100 damage in a clustered area. Means they can miss completely and make you effectively do less damage as with the normal one.  
---
Aside from that. You can fire the standard Fatman a lot further away. Even getting sneak attacks.
---
No actual proof was given, pictures of a bag with duped items in it does not mean the people in the picture owned or created the items. So while no "hysteria" may come from this, false or inaccurate accusation could result in harassment to an innocent player.
---
On a personal level I believe OP but nothing stops anyone from using these pictures to accuse someone wrongfully.
---
I love this so much because people have argued the paint is only in the shop. NOPE! Just really hard to find
---
Start exploring the center and south part of the map the main quest is probably going to lead you there now
---
Take it up with the moderators. Whether they do or do not give you the validation you need in your life then we'll have an end of the story. ;)
---
Child’s play! 
---
I found the items via searching “atomic shop” on twitter for anyone wanting to see quickly.
---
Not defending dupers at all. Hope they get wiped out...but saying TSE drops reasonably enough. I am at 320 hours played legit, had 4 crappy explosive weapons drop in that and zero TSE. RNGJesus doesn’t love all of us equally. Maybe I’ll see one before I hit 1k hours played.
---
Pssst! Ask him if he can prove that those bags belong to the two people.
---
One of the ways that people say Bethesda can see who duped is by looking at who had insane amounts of items on them. What if the OP had all this shit on him and wanted to make this post accusing those two of duping so that he could point this out to Bethesda’s customer service if he got banned?
---
You’re right and it is a witch-hunt. 
---
I haven't tried using trap so maybe that's it. I've had my camp in a variety of places and have built gun turrets in workshops as well, but never had any success with them.
---
you have to wait for the nuke zone to go away to launch a new nuke on the zone. 
---
I am curious how many dupers got wiped out by accessing the developers room. People that dupe items to sell and people that want unique items from the developers room probably have a decent amount of overlap. 
---
Thank you for the explanation but from your initial post, it sounded like you were saying that your poor experience with the game was the only valid narrative. I refer specifically to your sentences regarding "you would have complained too" as if everybody had the same amount of disconnects and that you're sick of posts like the OP's. 
---
In any case, I hope that you're enjoying the game now. Hope to see you in the Wasteland.
---
My friend and I 2 man the queen in terms of damage, our two other friends provide buff support. We’ve gotten to the point with leechers where we will stop fighting the queen and watch 10+ people sort of attack her and do zero damage. It’s frustrating. If we weren’t farming serum recipes we’d just leave when it happens. Friday some level 13 got a marsupial serum recipe and didn’t even know what it was and his friends were going apeshit - all under 50. It’s whatever I guess. 
---
True isn't it! A really nicely written simple guide, that anyone can follow! I am still stuck on where the fountain is in whitesprings
---
Wanna trade homie
---
You should be able to build about 5 floors below where you place the C.A.M.P. I think the limits are 8 total floors 3 above and one below. I've built my camp on that location and you can indeed get both. The trick is getting the C.A.M.P. to stick to the wall at just the right location off the ledge about half way down the ravine. You will likely need to place the C.A.M.P. a few times to get it right. Once you place it try to drop an extractor at each resource to make sure. The one major problem with the location is it is too close to the scorchbeast, if you build anything he will attack it and they spawn far too quickly from the fissure.
---
I double dog dare any NPC raiders to move into MY Appalachia 
---
yup nuka cola icon and new stash
---
I loaded into whitesprings golf club after my last xp grind with the glowie bois.  The fps is a lot more stable, feels so smooth.
---
Now I'm hoping they haven't upped the server resources after the patch for a small time period.  If this is permanent then it sure is a welcome fix! 
---
It's a bug with Strange in numbers and groups.
---
If you're in a group and have strange in numbers equiped or a friend is sharing it.  When they leave the game (usually just out to the main menu without leaving group first) the bonus effects of strange in numbers is supposed to be removed.  HOWEVER, it removes ALL mutation bonuses, not just the strange in numbers bonus to mutations.
---
Maybe there could be a bunch of polearm and halberd mods for it. To increase the range and damage.
---
Witch hunting is not allowed as it's an overall reddit rule.
---
The sub hivemind is so rabidly filled with hate that if anyone points that out they're *obviously* a duper. Kinda pathetic tbh
---
TIL
---
Sorry I didn’t see this just let me know next time you’re on and I’ll see if I’m able to then
---
You sound cool. What's your IGN?
---
Yeah they put a big nerf on xp without doing anything to how much xp it costs to level up
---
Just looked into that Event and you have to defeat robots. Do they like to throw the rape-you-in-the-ass versions of the Gutsys at you or just the pathetic laser ones?
---
I only need 3 more items then I'll have collected them all and I know where they're at. Other wise I probably would lol
---
Yeah I also "found" a whole stack of stuff from dupers. So when Bethesda comes along and  bans people for excessive carry weights mine was just from being a white knight, not duping myself.
---
No. Never that. Only honorable reasons to be 80 000lbs overweight.
---
Wink. 
---
Ive been farming Uranium Fever but on about half of those some ass uses his TSE to kill everything before i even have a chance to tag them. Most times only Fissure Prime get nuked in the servers im in and i dont want to make the Queen Battle more difficult for them so i stay away. Been Farming a lot of 1*'s (and the occasional 3*) at Watoga hoping for a good explosive, and that is where i got my Two Shot Handmade but still no worthwile drops from that.
---
Nuke quantum wall light and a toy box stash skin.
---
He refused that
---
Fun chase !!   
---
Loved the song lol
---
Same here...
---
Definitely duped? I put legendaries in containers at overseer's camp from time to time to get rid of weight.
---
I've noticed it as well. Posts are barely up for 10 mins, regardless of content.
---
I joined a friend and was able to get on 
---
I like to put 4 rocket turrets on the 2nd level spread equally around my base.
---
That will get rid of any mole rats or dogs.
---
What I would love to see is something that stops the Scorched and Mutant (aka any ranged AI) from attacking the camp from OUTSIDE the turret range.  If they're going to attack, keep them moving TOWARDS the camp so eventually your turrets have a chance to possibly take them out.
---
The rape you in the ass ones :/ don’t underestimate the 3* that usually spawns at the end, those billets are strong 
---
Cool, the wall light sounds cool
---
I think it's herd mentality but be aware that dying from rads can trigger dud mutations.
---
They don't show on the effects screen so your fine.
---
Btw confirm mutations on your special screen for stats. The effects screen can straight up lie
---
There's also several along the road south of Whitespring train station.
---
At least we have the pitchfork lol 
---
PvP is broken on many levels. TSEs are not one of those levels. 
---
Yeah, I'd like to see this.  Hate seeing a turret or fusion generator at 10% health and don't want to constantly do the "store" "replace" thing.
---
I heard it was random too.
---
Personally I got them in order.  Large Generator (10 power) -&gt; Windmill (12 power) -&gt; Fusion Generator (100 power).
---
Both my friends got their Large Generator first as well.
---
Lucky to get the Fusion first.  After that there is no reason to get Large or Windmill except to be a completionist.  That and powering up events are tedious.  Takes so long to find all the points.
---
And I always take a wrong turn on repairing the reactor and end up inside the cooling water area where you start ticking 9+ Rads and have to hop into a PA, Hazmat Suit, or RadX.  Then of course you can get lost inside there any take ages to get out.
---
I'm just glad I don't have to bother with them anymore currently.  I may help my friends get their last two plans, but we only bother going to one if we see other people attempting them.  Trying to solo them is just too much time investment.
---
I saw masking tape the other day and thought, "Ooo!" Then I realized...
---
Excavator gives +100. Shocks give +50 each. That's +200. Motion-Assist Servos on the Torso give +2 Strength that's +10 carry. So 210 total. And a log on bug gives an extra +100. So 310 total, a nice bug, but should only be +210.
---
so my husband and my boyfriend were playing fallout 69
---
It looks great!
---
Ah I see. I meant that to be more illustrative of my main point than as a hard and fast assertion. Sorry if that was misleading. 
---
I was loving the game even when I hated it, and it's only gotten better with time. Thanks, and you as well. Maybe in a beautiful distant future where we won't even have to worry about scrapping mods when we repair our gear. 
---
Ever since they were mass duped they were.
---
*GASP*
---
So other than the reddit post and the juicehead video do you have any proof that there is another duping method?
---
I just walked up to a 20 cap bounty and it turned into 10 without fast travelling. I get your point but why advertise the bounty as one thing and then half it? These people aren't my friends
---
Massive pussies. Idk. Ask em.
---
Honestly, you are totally missing out. it's alot of clowning around and such but we tend to have a great time on there!  
---
i honestly don't mind lower levels either as long as they dont hide in the shed and the queen somehow times out because there is 3 people doing damage to the queen and 16 people hiding in a shed. i usually just flat out leave if that happens and hunt resources instead.
---
It was people using the hack not dupers.  PC only.  I think they used new accounts so it mostly didn't matter at all.
---
Are you talking about todays patch, or sometime earlier?
---
Did they used to in fo4? ...because I made this same mistake and only recently noticed telephones didn't have screws or springs. 
---
I got two dog helmets since the patch, so I'm thinking they are planned.
---
I only want one if I can find a safe spot for my camp.  I'm not about hearing boo-boo puppy noises.
---
Dogmeat must be kept safe!
---
His point stands relevant. As you stated earlier, encountering 6 dupers in an hour you 100% are actively looking for them. Under normal circumstances you’d be lucky enough to run into randoms at all in the span of an hour. 
---
If you are actively looking for players exploiting that you speculate cause instability, what do you expect?
---
It be cool if there was a rabid response team to help fend of raiders. Something player run. I'm imagining something like the fuel rats from elite dangerous. 
---
There is good caps to be made in pvp. An organized group of four could make a nice sum.
---
Thank you. This is on PC!
---
I would imagine this sub would be blowing up with confirmations of people having been banned wouldn't you?
---
The only thing iv'e seen coming close to a confirmation is some youtuber(s) having their accounts banned.  Maybe two people?
---
I do too. Other players can pick up from there. I'm not sure how long they stay or whether they proof after disconnect though
---
Yeah. I've had a couple two shots, couple explosive, no TSE. But I don't farm, just play. And dont really care if I get one. Mobs arent hard to kill.
---
Just a FYI but most of those players are doing trades on FO76 Bazzar and FO76 Market reddits.  You want better gear, go there.  Sell, sell, sell, then buy, buy, buy.  It's really the only way to speed up the grind.  In 400 hours of play, I've probably only had 2 of the two shot weapons drop (and both were crap).
---
I thought they fixes that this update?
---
Dude don't feel bad..I was lvl 90 and I just launched my first nuke the other night with a bunch of friends of friends, there was 15 of us on the server we launched all 3 back to back on prime site..it was a blast.
---
To my knowledge the standard Excevator gives you 100+ carryweight like that.  
---
One calibrated shock gives you 50+ each. So another 100+
---
Means it gives you 200+ in total.   
---
I myself do have one on my excevator suit, but i have to admit, i don't like using it, since it just feels like a cardboard against enemies. I rather use my X-01 with two shocks. Surely 100 less carryweight is something you do notice especially later on if you have to carry around some stuff to actually be able to react decent to each situation, but i kinda came to a nice balance with it and still have around 90 carryweight left.
---
Yeah that would be good, for games struggling to find players you could combine the already existing player bases of both platforms, it also seems that he works is a little “too big” for the maximum cap on the server , I think they severely overestimated how many people would play the game 
---
True bit I thought I would ask anyway. Thanks for your response.
---
Mine is along the monorail tracks off a stone cliff.  Have only seen one person there, used my work benches and split.  The scorched beast attack was fun.  Despite playing open beta, I'm under level 40, what with wife and kids and work and all.
---
Tbh, depending on your damage resistance mutations etc you don't need the X01 for the silos. I used rad suit, but i have 18 mutations with class freak equipped, to reduce the negatives. I would recommend taking a heck load of stims though, as you die, you go back to outside the silo. Take a friend also!!
---
As for materials... i just loot any toys, clipboards, typewriters, fans and alarm clocks. These are good for gathering springs and screws! Equip the junk rat perk for 75% weight reduction on junk while farming. If you are on pc i could help later?
---
This had been bugging me for a while, so the past games, I've been repairing the power stations.
---
When you repair the power stations, you have to **fully repair** them (do the optional bit).
---
This will then power up the power core machine, and the sub stations.
---
Each power station does a different zone up the map.
---
There aren't many ways to 1 hit kill at distance. If someone gets up close to you I can see a 1 hit kill being legit enough. But because of the proliferation of TSE dupes everyone can 1 hit kill on site with 100-500 caps, however much the duper was charging. That's what the problem is.
---
Yep same tried to sell something at the shop got kicked out I cri
---
Is this true? That’s ridiculous 
---
This is good info, thank you.
---
Yea wish they had more serious options like blackbird
---
The call to arms doesn't need to be that implicit. Although not done to harass them, nor intended to witch hunt, he already did the searching. It's just like any other post outside of fallout. Say you see a lady berating and lobbing slurs at someone in publicfreakout, and you know her and post her email, never explicitly saying she should be contacted. That's clearly a violation of the rules. Although a bit exaggerated, this is essentially the same thing.
---
It's likely a clean version, much like the skiing outfit.
---
Is it possible to tame cats with that animal perk?
---
I expect exploiters to be punished. I don't know if that is such a hard thing to understand.
---
It’s probably a clean version 
---
Downloading now. 50 percent in about 4 min. 3.4 gig update
---
Nothing was done about stacking bobbleheads this patch.
---
Pretty cool, and good luck, but FO76 isn't really that tough to do permadeath.  Wanderer is doing a Fallout: Frost permadeath run on YouTube that's a bit more impressive, as that game is masochistically tough.
---
Queen battles are such a waste of ammo for little return 
---
I was mostly just kidding, but thanks for the info! 
---
I will most likely just be using it on the SBQ when she lands. 
---
I always found the Fatman hard to aim in general but I guess you kind of get a feel for how it shoots after a while. 
---
The one I have is a 2 star and the second effect is +10% damage while aiming. Is this useful on a Fatman? I never knew if this effect triggered when the bullet lands or when you shoot the bullet. 
---
So I am basically redownloading the entire game again for a 3g patch?
---
I've been planning on CAMPing there for a while! Always wondered how snugly stuff could fit in that little gap
---
I keep them to trade people for other plans.
---
yea level 32 now on PC and i have ran into 2 trolls otherwise its actually felt like a solo game tbh I have yet to group with anyone. 
---
Every person doing a Let's Play of this game should do it wearing the Let's Play power armor.
---
Jesus!  Been waiting a good half an hour and only 13% in. I’m the only one using the WiFi too
---
Fallout series goes way back, they're probably people who fell in love with Wasteland/Fallout in the 80s and are still out there battling the wastes for all us sinners.  It'll happen to the rest of us too I hope.
---
Also stuck on a loading screen
---
can confirm its not just "building on a spawn point". I have found areas where no enemy spawns just by passing through. I used to try to avoid spawn points by having multiple people run into the area manually and see if anything appears  
---
regardless of whether or not they spawned naturally, once i placed my camp, enemies would spawn almost every time that I or a friend fast traveled to my camp.   
---
Its fine when its me fast traveling home, but someone else passing by my camp and not going close enough to see enemies to kill, will cause your camp to get annihilated by spawns........
---
Sadly I'm on Xbox and PS4, though I appreciate the offer. Thanks for your help!
---
seriously this community need to improve their jokes
---
good luck, i just realized my stash is about to get a lot more full of 0.1 weight items
---
They should also let us build robots to patrol our camp
---
I have mine hardwired. 80kbps roughly download 
---
Party up with 1 or more friends, clear the clubhouse, go out to the parking lot, make sure there is no one else in the building (prevents respawn), one person quits to menu, rejoins server using social menu, when they load in mobs respawn.  On a laggy server respawn can take up to 20-30 seconds after they start moving.  Works everywhere that we have tried it, some areas just have larger "spawn zones" to get everyone out of, like the behemoth south of Solomon's Pond, once killed, go about 1/3 of the way back up the dirt road and then do the trick, run back down and plow him over and over.
---
All new items look really nice and it seems they're dropping prices a little :)
---
I came back to my camp to find 3 dead Scorchbeasts laying on the roof.  My 3 missile turrets and laser turrets pivoting and looking for more targets to lock onto.
---
Probably can’t be on until later tonight. Not sure what time zone you’re in but around 7est 
---
I'd give Atoms for a Halberd.
---
It's a shame there wasn't one in Helvetia
---
JAJAJAJA
---
What did he do? Open a door in someone's camp?
---
Try building your base using only 1 foundation.  It seems that those attacks are spawned when you have a large foundation. 
---
As an example, I had a cliff side base with maybe 6 or 8 foundations touching the ground. 
---
It got attacked 100% of the time i fast traveled there.
---
I moved to a base on top of a train car,  it only has 1foundation on the ground and all the other floors are suspended in the air over the train car. 
---
I've had maybe 5 attacks in over a month at that spot and never once when fast traveling there, only when spending time there crafting or similar. 
---
👍
---
it seems im now always doing some type of grinding in my dreams
---
Agree.
---
This seems like it would be far over budget, how were you able to fit all this?
---
Nice, I found two of those "need a key" boxes but had no idea they were related! Quite a trail you followed. 
---
It would be very kind of you if you message when you're on :)
---
I've seen this twice now here. But since the other duplication glitch hinged on rejoining the same server, idk how shutting an entire server down would work. 
---
Yes they can. I'm frequently unloading ammo, plans and health supplies there. Sometimes, low level weapons I get awarded from Forrest events.
---
No problem pal! Keep lootin' fellow appalachian!
---
yea I'm on pc send me ur username and I will work on joining u in a server
---
You see, my character in game just always needs to take a shit. It's my role play.
---
toy cars also contain screws
---
Done now. Sorry.
---
Right?? I keep most of the rare ones on me though lol, like to show em off
---
!remindme 7 hours
---
Strange. My guess is he stole them from the world container a duper was using, though it's possible he was a duper himself and just feeling generous.
---
Got it. Thanks for your valuable insight! 
---
depends on your build, i run a melee vats build that requires a lot of luck to get my critical meter built fast so its 15, i usually am under the influence because one of my team mates rezs mean with alcohol. 
---
I'd love the option to repair if it's between 200% and 100%.  Always like having my weapons and armor topped off :)
---
I understand. The other day I was at a store and it was kind of dark down an isle, and I went to hold down the B button to turn on the flashlight. Only, there was no B button, I had no controller, and I was in a real life store so... yeah. 
---
I’m the exact same way. I don’t want open PvP, I want to explore the world, take it all in. I enjoy atmosphere more than combat. I know people think the combat sucks, but maybe there’s a reason, maybe because combat isn’t the main focus, it’s exploration and world building. I’ll say it, when I first played this game back in beta, my high level friends just dragged my low level ass along and brought me into areas I wasn’t ready for. When the game came out, it happened again. I finally took a stand, started a new character, and limited her to only solo play. And it was the most fun I’ve had exploring since New Vegas. Hate my opinion or not, my final part of the statement stands. This game will separate fans from band wagoners.

---
The cold hard facts is that 76 held 500 residents at the beginning and was overcapacity by the 20 year mark...
---
With Scorchbeast, multiple hostile robots, and the greatest threat, lack of world survival and unity, 24 people left when we get to endgame isnt that farfetched...
---
I have this happen when I jump onto certain double sections of small pipes or some railings. I can usually find a direction that my character will move ever so slowly and if I keep trying to jump it will eventually get unstuck.
---
Hey at least you didn’t have a level 50 scorchbeast spawn at your camp
---
I'm sure they won't add that. They made a point of having no human NPCs. They are probably going broke so I doubt they'll do anything but the bare minimum to this game in the future. 
---
It also gave the actual instructions. OP missed the first step.
---
Actually have to place your camp about half way down the cliff. It can be a pain to find that perfect spot. My best has been on a ledge on the face down the tight "crack" next to the cave. Fall from the cliff above hitting the ledges on the way down. Once you find the spot it's easy to find again if need be. 
---
hmm sounds like we need some clarification on it i guess. 
---
I said from the very beginning. I will not like the new perkcard system. It just feels stupid that you pretty much have to switch all the time.   
---
Aside from that. There is a mod on the nexus which gives you a loadout system for easy and fast switching of cards.   
---
And you can near instantly switch your cards during combat so you can react differently to each situation. Making it already kinda obsolete that you even have it in the first place, since you can switch cards even during combat.   
---
Might as well just activate all cards once you have them except very special ones like the Super Duper perkcard or anything that just increases your gain of resources.   
---
Weapon damage? Might be a thing to talk about too. Perks like carryweight? Seriously.. the game comes to a crawling pace once you hit your stash limit. In a game about looting and collecting, i would love to be able to do so.   
---
So yeah.. in my eyes this Perkcard system has to be revamped anyway. Make many cards you need only for a second completely passive like lockpicking, hacking, cooking, chems...  
---
That would already reduce the amount of times i need to switch cards immensely. 
---
Did you just fall into a circle reacting to my suggesting you needed validation by suggesting I needed validation?
---
Irony. Let the mods decide it.
---
i usually flash the pipboy other ppl shoot the bag..but i do know that some newbs have NO CLUE what we are trying to do
---
All are options. Personally I think that is more damaging to the economy then the people selling duped items for cash.
---
99% falls off stuff, 1% all other deaths possible.  
---
This is exactly why Bethesda needed to include working vertibirds.
---
It is great that Bethesda is addressing the dupe exploit but it crazy just how much a single group of dupers can generate. This shit is still out there. In a large percentage of servers, affecting stability and balance. But when you say dupes should be deleted people come out of the woodwork to say "but muh hard earned caps" smh. Like for one, you are passively admitting to the very real possibility that you bought a dupe. Like you suspect it's a dupe now so it reasonable to assume you suspected it was a dupe when you bought it. And two, fuck your caps. Think about the greater good. Thanos was right
---
I will admit myself also,my game only freezes once every couple days or so on Xbox,east coast of Canada.
---
I never knew this. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Keep it.  Come back to the game in a year, you won't have to pay a dime to play again and it may have changed enough for it to keep your interest.
---
I don't even play the game, so no.
---
An image is not evidence. I'm not saying he *did* photoshop it, but he absolutely 100% *could have* photoshopped it. So the evidence is worthless.
---
And again, it's against the forum rules, so I don't know why you're even arguing about it. Cheaters should be reported to Bethesda and not accused/called out here.
---
It's a game with pvp.  He bought it.  Case closed.
---
I made a safe place for  players to relax and re-stock, and it’s off the railroads. I called it “off the rails” and it’s the most stupid adorable thing I’ve done. I wanna find a way to turn it into a shop if Bethesda allows vendors ever 
---
Well, started my download about 20 minutes or so ago. It says 62 minutes to go. Trucking along..
---
I hear ya, but a better way would be to fix the rollback of items so they can't get duped period \^\^ But yeah, hope something happens SOON..
---
No one cares that this is a competitive multiplayer game, apparently. Since there's so much PvE content to be experienced.
---
One pc and a laptop. You don't need to run the game full hd or whatever, your mule only do trade then disconnects
---
Yeah man if you drop all your items and then press alt + F4 it fixes all your items, dupes the legendaries, and puts you in God mode, duh. 
---
All rise is my go to melee weapon it’s nice 
---
That analogy doesn't line up.
---
If I see someone chucking a brick through a glass window and take a picture.... it's not witch hunting even though that picture may allow for identification of that individual.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
I agree on this method.  Got 4 good ones, minus empath but im usually grouped up anyway.  
---
Bought the rest from enclave and players.  
---
My current camp site is on the most popular Lead node on the map. I know this because I have to switch servers two or three times to get my house to spawn.
---
So if this is basic error correction why have i not run into this with any other update before?  I am always under 50 g of free space.  No issue with RDR2 No mans sky, Gta5.  Christ Gta5 is damn near 150g now.

Fallout 2. Haven’t found any callback to it in 76.

---
I'm able to build one more floor before. So with the double stairs, it is a total of 4 floors below the cliff
---
It does thank you!
---
I do some of that already but that’s a great idea only dropping a few items at a time. I try to rush through and find stuff to give them, yesterday I accidentally took some radaway because I was panicking trying to give them the stuff all at once before they ran away hahaha.
---
Will definitely take that all on board :)
---
Hooooo. Will try that. Thank you 
---
It is a two shot?   
---
Then you already have one of the most powerful affixes you can get. If not the most powerful for the Fatman. (Not sure if it can have instigating too, but i do think it doesn't mix with two shot.)
---
"Yeah, that's gonna be a no from me Dawg" I died 3 times to a 3* Gutsy that spawned in Watoga (couldn't heal fast enough even with a 400 DR). I hate those Gutsy's almost as much as i hate ScorchBeasts.
---
And you provide a valuable thing to us Raiders. 
---
If there wasn’t a risk of death for us, it just wouldn’t be fun. 
---
Try the whitesprings vendors too. I think that’s where I bought mine.
---
If you still have stuff, I'm in the 60s but I have not been fortunate with drops. Non-auto rifles spec player. 
---
Herbivore is actually a great mutation. I have 4 corn, 4 carrots, 4 gourd, and 1 razorgrain. I eat nothing but soup. I use green thumb. Since the soups are both food and water, it takes 3 soups to fill me up on both. 
---
&gt; Let the mods decide it.
---
They just did. The post has been removed. Are you done now?
---
Are you referring to one that requires 3 people and litrally crashes the server?
---
I rode out the first 50 levels with a non legendary hunting rifle until my Explosive Troubleshooter Lever Action dropped. That got me through the next 40 odd levels (occasionally killed myself shooting ankle munching molerats) until some Australian guy dropped me a free TSE Handmade. And even still, none of those guns has been as realiable as my serrated combat knife. 
---
I guess the training started when I was young. It affected me when I am playing other games also. 
---
It was. It literally was. The first dupe to see public light - The artillery dupe, a patch was live and serves up after fixing it 23 hours after it was made public. That’s less than a day.
---
But when there are 100 different ways to get the same result (a duplication) it makes perfect sense patches won’t be rolled out immediately after every single one. Most likely they are trying to figure out a way to eliminate the core works of this exploitable function.
---
A dupe, while it’s destructive to the game, should however never have been top priority. A dupe requires a player to go out of their way to perform it. The power armor bug should have been the absolute top priority. It completely ruined the game to the point where it wasn’t playable, and happened seemingly at random. Up there with the PA bugs which some still experience btw, is the bug that has been happening for some causing them to spawn naked, without a pip-boy. 
---
No. You can't claim a structure for your CAMP. You gotta build it.
---
very possible, just because i did not see an event does not mean it did not happen, valid point, just my raw observational data
---
and you know if all they want to do is grief players they probably bought the TSE off ebay or from a duper anyway
---
They have an alcoholic recipe for a stimpack in the official cookbook. 
---
How strange, I read it took 3 times and it did for me.  Just assumed that was the case for everyone.
---
I've heard that missile turrets are great for defending against scorchbeasts
---
Very and irritating.  I had a really nice base but with only 11% to use, I get the basics and not even all of those.
---
They got their inspiration from Rust 
---
You can also use Radicool a 1 star perk card in Endurance for +5 Strength or +25 carry weight. It will give you the +5 Strength I think at around 50% rads. You can radiate yourself relatively easily if you want. You can also get Solar Powered to give you +3 Strength or +15 carry weight during the day time. You can also use Party Boy/Girl in Charisma to double or triple the effects of alcohol. With Whisky that is from 2/4/6 Strength or 10/20/30 carry weight. Grilled Radstag will give you +20. Marsupial mutation will give you +20. Some chems will also give you up to about +3 Strength or +15 carry weight.
---
yes but then they are completely fucking anyone who actually DCs
---
Folks have been banned for cheating software

Unsure id that includes duping

---
Everything about it. The color scheme, the patterns, the stupid ridiculous writing on the torso. I own every Armor paint at this point, it's the very first I'm taking a pass on.
---
Thats what ive been wondering too since i never saw one. Hope it exists. Makes the gun look sl badass. 
---
I'm only done when you feel validated enough to stop trying to feel validated.
---
Are you done now?
---
other friends get the items before DC
---
You cant repair partly broken items, only ones that have been destroyed. 
---
Agreed. Very satisfying first strike on a charge, and hitting landed SBs in the sack with it is cathartic. 
---
yeah its super annoying, someone griefed my camp yesterday and now all my walls are at like 10%
---
I remember having a real problem after Skyrim had come out. I worked at an outdoor camp at the time an I would be walking and would just be thinking of picking the flowers and mushrooms for ingredients. Have not gotten to that level with 76 yet but their is still time.
---
I've not had major problems with mine.  I just found a 2 shot hunting rifle as well and it seemed to deal better damage 100% of the time. 
---
I should note i use a scope, maybe it's worse with iron sights or shooting from the hip. 
---
That said i haven't used it extensively yet. 
---
Not true!! Check south of Charleston 
---
I'm a low lvl so im not looking to trade for the carp ones those ill give to others in my party if I have them in invintory.
---
Fair enough
---
I have the marine wetsuit but not the hoodie 
---
If I can’t find the hoodie, going aquaboy
---
You can wait out a bounty?
---
Nah, as someone with a similar build, Heavy Weapons are indeed trash
---
Yes it is a two shot with the +10% damage while aiming. 
---
I know the two shot is great, I was just wondering about the other affix. 
---
I generally just hipfire the Fat Man but i would think aiming it would be doable for the extra damage. 
---
Thats wrong. You can. No "clean houses" but its possible to build with existing structures.
---
Haha good one. Literally 100% of my bounties in this game are due to opening something that did not visibly belong to anyone's camp. 
---
The last few days i was there, the first time was 4 nukes in a row (but no loot from the queen, it was my first time so i thought she gave none. Stupid spinny loot) then the second day was three in a row. It was pretty fun, everyone just waited around and messed her up pretty quickly.
---
Read this please: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem
---
I've only seen a mod on the Nexus that changes the long barrel into the Bull barrel. Pretty sure it does not exist in game... Yet.
---
My guess it is was not an intended function. Thankfully it does not seem to do this when you use the mouse to drag but this is only helpful if you are on PC 
---
It's just a fancy trashcan that acts as a stash box.
---
WiFi sucks. Run an Ethernet cable for better speeds. 
---
What else floats?
---
Which sucks because EVERYONE else has one. New players won't stand a chance in PvP with all the OP TSE shotguns in circulation.
---
I thought it was a torso mod not legs for added carry weight
---
Bullshit. I got my hands on one after 80 levels invested, and it is A BLAST! Dont give a shit if everyone else has one, I'm playing to have fun, not to feel special.
---
That fucking 3* robot in watoga wont drop any legendaries for me.  
---
I'll make a few more like this and if I build a small fanbase I'll ask everyone what they think, cheers for the comment though!
---
It wasn't the scorched virus per se.  If you keep on with the main quest you'll get a holotape from the Overseer that makes it clear (if you haven't figured it out already).
---
A clue -- what happened to Charleston?  Was that caused by the scorched?  What happened to Watoga?
---
This is why I hope "player vending" means indestructible terminals in the basement of Whitesprings.  Great place, lots of people go there, centrally located.
---
I do NOT want to have a "come grief me" sign on the map to use the "player vending" at my base.
---
1. Some people will destroy your base just for the lulz.
---
2. Some people won't like your prices you're charging and destroy your vending machines / base.
---
3. Some people will get pissed they travelled all the way to your base only to find pipe pistols and spoiled food, then destroy your vending machines / base.
---
4. Some people will just destroy your vending machines / base to prevent you from selling things.
---
It would be MUCH better if "player vending" was in the basement of Whitesprings.  If it's in Whitesprings, I'll be there constantly buying, selling, checking to see what people have for sale.  Heck, I'll probably spend lots of time server hopping to see what all the different players on different servers are offering :)
---
Able to load in, but have crashed twice in 10 minutes and my buddy is unable to repair any items (weapons and armor).
---
Nah it’s not expected but it’s super nice 
---
Some people just really enjoy being annoying. 
---
I've been wondering this, too - it's been a while since I last played FO4, so I don't even remember how fast the revolvers there fired (if they were *actually* double-action like they should be, or treated as single-action like all the ones in 76 are), but I do definitely remember the Bull Barrel mod. I haven't seen it yet, either, though, which seems odd - it should've been easy enough to just carry it over like so much other stuff was.
---
You can get pets??
---
Fo76 probably ate up the last bit of space.
---
Go look on /r/ps4
---
You'll find threads from 4 years ago talking about the same thing.
---
Its not new
---
They don’t drop a lot they’ve just been duped a lot lol
---
This could be true 
---
have farmed White Springs I've done about as many nukes as many queens and one thing I noticed in Whiterun farming I would come out with 60 to 90 pieces of legendary to sort through most of it junk but it did seem that when I got a two shot weapon I will get more than one during that run or that session
---
I wish I would have paid more attention to the loot that I've gotten or at least taking screenshots of the final results you can also see what other people are getting a little bit because they dumped most of it on the ground
---
PvP only. Doesn't affect PvE.
---
Often does for my typically just the old 4Ls though... Legendary Leather Left Leg...
---
FWIW not sure if it’s impacted by duping but I miss the fc recharge server hop thing 
---
Will do what’s your ign?
---
Gulags intensify.
---
To add, we need a friendly decline.
---
Doesn't affect PvE, only PvP.
---
Been waiting to take her down until its a Nuke that i launch that spawns her and i can do some real damage to her. So ive been farming for better Weapons. Have some good 2* and 3* armor but will likely be in PA so that wont matter at all.
---
I think the problem is that the best TSE weapons with the right perk loadouts are so absurdly overpowered compared to other weapons and are only available to the .01% of people who are lucky enough to get them as a drop. Either those effects need to be nerfed or unable to be on the same weapon at all. Maybe Two-Shot and Explosive are ONLY able to be on the same weapon as super rare drops from scorchbeasts/the queen or something. But having it be an RNG race to see who can beat on the most weak ghouls at whitesprings to get a weapon that is literally 10x better than anything else in the game is a bad way to get high level loot. 
---
Creating content geared towards people wielding TSEs means that content would not be beatable by the average player and, more importantly, will NEVER be beatable by just playing the game and leveling up since the "best" non-TSE weapons aren't even close in terms of effectiveness. 
---
Let's say an "end-game" character is kitted out with x-01 power armor, a level 50 non-legendary heavy weapon (or whatever gun they prefer) with the best mods, and a level 50 super sledge/fire axe/whatever. If this character were 80-90% as effective as someone with a farmed/duped TSE legendary, then creating harder content that both of these players could complete would work. The problem is character 1 would be about 10% as effective, and any content that is a challenge for the TSE player would be literally impossible for a player with "normal" endgame gear. 
---
what are the stats and level of the gauss rifle please? i just may take that off you as i have a standard one right now.  i'm XB1 also, GT: BaronSwanston13
---
Wouldn't mind a handmade too!
---
They are duped you only need one in existence and get have a duper get a hold of it and then he can make 10,000 of them seriously they can make 10000
---
 I've seen dupers have hundreds of thousands of Nuka colas
---
I just had it download overnight, so I couldn’t tell you really. I assume it was at least an hour or so.
---
Nope, not even in the files last time I've checked.
---
Dense mod for chest reduces Explosive damage taken.
---
It's like a bunch of dirty patrolman trying to shake him down haha
---
I managed to join then fallout crashed. But the third time was the charm. 
---
I just crashes as you said that let’s hope it’s not a sign of things to come 
---
No, it isn't fun.
---
And now I'm gonna be downvoted since "yes" is the only allowed response to this question here.
---
I bought one and it’s boring. It’s an easy button. Great if you don’t want a challenge and just want to steamroll everything in one hit, but for me at least, being god gets boring fast. 
---
How old is the game again? Like 3 months old?
---
I was at Target and my immediate thought was [MOAR SCREWS](https://imgur.com/a/jruYGkp)
---
I die frequently because i don't keep an eye on my HP while fighting several monsters. I spam the stimpacks too late only to watch me take a knee in death while my HP is rising. 
---
And it's just generally a dick move to put up your camp next to the club house where it's going to steal kills from other players. Anyone that builds there 100% deserves whatever happens to their camp.
---
Under communism, you make fertilizer from the many dissidents.
---
Cute. Perhaps you're interested in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma where we understand that you've decided the walls of the argument as "They're witch hunting, which implies the harassment of players, per the rules posted in the sidebar or not" which was introduced far earlier.
---
There's no basis for those claims and no basis for the implication that OP was actually witch hunting. Now you've introduced a red herring to further validate to yourself that you had a point that was stronger than the one argued.
---
Get better.
---
Same on Xbox.
---
The perk card system is an attempt to not punish players in a pvp environment who take non combat perks such as crafting or lockpicking.  The disadvantage it tries to introduce to counter this is putting in another system that demands your attention.
---
Like if the system from 4 was in place, you would ultimately have to sacrifice damage output increasing perks to be able to pick locks or craft guns.  If the system from 3 were in place, spending your skill points outside of weapons skills may unbalance pvp by decreasing your damage output, but ironically might work better in endgame pvp since skills would be eventually be capped.  (Which would require a level limit, otherwise everyone would max int and put everything at 100.)
---
Of course, just like every game system ever, it needs adjustment after seeing how players really interact with it.
---
Also, how are you switching perk cards around in combat?  I'm impressed and jealous at the same time.
---
I'm probably the only one but I'm kind of glad that they don't server jumping is bad enough and then specific server loading I'm just kind of glad it didn't even give you that information they just quickly on your server and I've never had a problem where I couldn't get a server and the Pings seems to be good
---
Those players still exist. One time I cleared a town from ghouls and another player just appeared there right after...and right behind me.... re-spawning the ghouls. I hadn't realized he was there. He starts shooting and accidentally gets me too. I turn around and say "wtf yo!" ....after clearing the ghouls he gave me a dirty space suit as an apology and we both went on our ways. Little things like that are cool to experience. 
---
When you log in...........first thing check your map.  The nuke zone circle spawns faster than the world changes.
---
You get 10 seconds or so in the nuke zone after you spawn where it does zero rad damage.
---
See you're in the zone?  DO NOT run (you won't make it), DO NOT log out (you may die and drop your scrap before you log).......................simply FAST TRAVEL somewhere nearby outside the zone.  The game prioritizes fast travel requests very quickly and it will get you out of the zone super fast.
---
This worked 100% for me.  Now I don't worry about it any more.
---
It involves 3 players and a robot vendor and has been in the game since beta.  I was on xbox last night and disconnected about 20 times over 2 hours, and didn't see signs  of anyone doing either of the glitches, just bad servers.  At least prior to 9am today, there should not have been people doing this vendor disconnect on consoles since the weapon crafting disconnect was so much better/easier.
---
It's a fine line, but the line does exists. 
---
This is true. I have well over 1k steel but most of it is bulked and ready to sell (steel comes so easily with the scrapper perk if your willing to carry otherwise useless weapons to a bench to be broken down). Last night while going on an ammo crafting spree I caught myself just before I started breaking down mods. 
---
You know the same update was released for PC last week and it made no difference right?
---
Yes there are cleanish structures you can "claim" within your camps space.  You will not be able to remove things like crafting stations or doors or add doors even but you can still utilize the space.   
---
Someone may tell you a few spots but I only know of two and I really don't want people to gold rush them and get pissy that my camp can not be placed. 
---
Add me as friend we can trade when we see each other online SamuelV87 is my user
---
I have a TS LAR too, random legendary drop. It's a shockingly good weapon. If I didn't need to carry a second gun in case it breaks, I'd store everything else in favor of it. That was true before the patch, but now it loads 2x as fast on top of the fixed count. 
---
I ask my dealer if hes got any Rebound or Buffjet. He hands me some weed with weird look.
---
I love Golden Retrievers but I'd not let it touch my computer, all that hair and slobber O.o
---
Definitely. I was surprised it stripped all my armor off when I put it on! Not cool
---
Like, REALLY good vendor fodder. Especially if you already have Thru Hiker on. I stock up on the stuff everytime I see a nuke 
---
With the economy being what it is, you might as well buy them if you just want two of them. Max people would be asking is 1k and thats overpriced right now. Realistically 500 is a fair price but many people are selling them for even less than that!
---
I've had a single 2 shot drop, as a laser pistol. My only TSE and a couple explosives i picked up off a vendor. They are not common, but they shouldn't be. If these guns were never duped the community would be all about finding them, and having one would be very special. 
---
Yeah, I'd like a "Repair to 100%" option.  Hate seeing generators or turrets at 10% health.
---
I didn’t see an option to start a new character on Xbox. Did I miss something?
---
You are welcome to join! We might never play together but I do have random days off when my kids aren't home to binge!!! There is another person who has time to play in the day so far too so you guys can overlap and take care of things while the rest of us are away 😉 maybe we could even think about really holding a workshop or something like that if we have players across several times?
---
I'll add you to group chat where people can start coordinating schedules!
---
As a console player, mods are out of the question for us sadly. I do agree that the perk system is in need of a major revamp.  I also understand without a level cap it seems to be a method of creating varying builds and limiting what you can have active. 
---
I was thinking a more feasible perk system would be to have a special value requirement to have certain cards enabled. Example would be 5 Per required to have rifleman perk active, 10Per for expert, 15Per for master. But if you have a full 15 points invested, you can essentially have every Per perk active in that special.  This would obviously require a revamp and redisbursing of how and where certain cards are located... Otherwise 15 into strength would just be mandatory (though let's be real, mostly everyonelvl 100+ has this already anyhow)
---
I really hope the vaults are bringing npcs to appalachia. I miss big cities like diamon city. 
---
Sure :) there are a lot of people playing F76. I had never an empty server and 90% of the players are really friendly. Of curse there some giefers but people like this can be found in every Online Game.
---
It's now almost a cheap game to buy so why not if you enjoy the other Fallout Games :)
---
Hope you buy it and you have fun with it!

This is what i figured, is that people are blaming the disconnections on dupers rather than bethesda(or their own connection).
---
I feel the same. Anytime I see like a problem plastic spoon or something. I work retail, and constantly see 3 packs of duct tape. Lmao
---
It did that in FO4 and I hated it, never used one after I found that out from playing with one
---
Same mine recently got destroyed once but I don't even know if that was a player or NPCs a did it look high like a player because like everything was destroyed but I don't know
---
I mistakenly bought a Pip-Boy headlight mod thinking it would improve the light on my t45, eh no. 🤦‍♂️
---
I made an excavator helmet for it instead but my OCD wants another t45 helmet for the recent patches 
---
I've seen a few bouts with her now and the first one was 100% the best of them. When the whole lobby turns out to fight on a nuke you launched it just feels awesome (but fuck me fraaaaaaammmmessss). After the next couple of runs, you realise what an ammo sponge she is. You chip her down to about half health in like 10 minutes and the bitch regenerates...
---
You just can't let this go, can you. The post was even removed by the moderators because it broke the rules of the forum, and you are still trying to argue with me (who didn't wrote the rules, and who isn't a moderator of the forum) about the definition of the word "witch hunt". You are wasting your time and you are bothering me.
---
The only good thing I got was an armor piercing gatling, that's it. most of the time I get bonus damage against mirelurk or whatever, nothing really interesting.

I am aware, yes. Clearly others were not.

I'm on X Box and just logged in. No update to apply? So checking my settings now. I do have auto update enabled but nothing showed up

Have you launched the nuke in charlie within the past 3 hours?

I got Heat Flashes from Honeybeasts out in the swamp 
---
I would love to switch from my explosive rifle to melee perks once an enemy gets too close!  
---
Also, very valid points
---
good to know I guess. Thanks for the explanation! Let's hope they will fix it soon
---
Not if they bring how character information is saved up to par with pretty much every other online game on the market.
---
I've been away from the game for about two-ish weeks. What's got dupers shitting themselves exactly? I'm eager to finally see some punishment but I can't find any info on what's going on.
---
Uh oh... We have a community resource mule who holds weapons, armor, and crafting mats from 50 players as well as excavator, ultracite, and t51b sets for those leveling... Could be interesting to see it all gone XD 
---
lol, try play similar open world games like RDR2, God of War, Ghost Recon Wildlands, you will see how bad every aspect Fallout 76 looks, not only low quality low resolution garbage texture, but also extremely visible shadow pop in, super bad interior lighting, fake lights everywhere, weird and bad material and character shader under certain light condition, low draw distance in addition to robotic and last gen character animations, I played Wildlands before playing Fallout 76, jesus, the character animation, there is no comparison.
---
I think the two shot accuracy problems mainly happen when you are using vats. Other than that you ahould be good.
---
Are you able to view your pipboy while in PA?
---
The name tag can still show if you’re standing and invis, you have to crouch to hide your name tag. If we tested this right it seemed that if you aim directly at a player who is stealthed and sneaking their name will appear. Not sure if this changes when in combat with another player though.
---
Oh and beware targeting huds.
---
Ok cool. Eastern time? By the way I’ll be on in the morning and afternoon tomorrow
---
I needed springs the other day to craft power armor for this mission. A whole 60 pcs! I had maybe two.. I've had farming in Borderlands more successful than farming 60 pcs of springs. 
---
And that's where I noticed, there are wrenches everywhere! Even in the hospital, there were more wrenches than clipboards. What does a doctor do with a wrench?!
---
Is there a reason why YouTube your want longer videos instead of short videos does monetizing your videos do better with longer videos do they remove more reward more for longer videos cuz if so then that would be why
---
Are you on xbox?
---
Yep already using one of those
---
I lucked out (likely why i cant find a TSE) and my TwoShot is a Handmade.
---
Agreed I think folks are farming them now
---
I mean don't get me wrong but yeah this is going to be a minor nuance to my morning routine of selling all the junk I earned the day before that doesn't need to be bulked I have over a hundred of
---
The previous one.
---
I am in europe so i think we will  see each other tomorrow 
---
I was near whitesprings and got grief twice in the past week. I guess you are sorta hidden bc the griefers likely fast travel.
---
First one after about 20 mins on PS4...
---
Have only had one server crash since the last update. Played on the same server the entire day on Saturday. Felt good to actually take a workshop and hold it for more than 15 minutes :P
---
Maybe if you get it for under 20 bucks. But even then, there's plenty of better shit to play. 
---
If you are willing, you can post on Reddit and hold Grahm. 
---
Just launched one about 20 min ago 
---
soon to ding 450 hours ingame. i've found 38 explosive weapons, 4 of those being TSE(25 .44 magnum. 35 laser rifle,35 gatling laser, 45 handmade)) Hang in there bud. you'll find one in the end. RNGsus isnt fair, but he does deliver in the end.
---
You can tame a creature to defend your camp, but it's pretty convoluted to get it. Someone please correct me if I mess anything up here but the requirements to do this are:
---
1. Level 3 Animal Friend Perk
---
2. Animal must be tameable (Dog, Brahmin, Deathclaw, Yao Guai, sloth, and rad toad... possibly more). Some, like Mirelurks, are not.
---
3. Animal must be half your level or lower, depending on your Charisma stat.
---
4. Animal must spawn alone, randomly, and not part of any event or location. An example of a creature that doesn't qualify is the deathclaws on Deathclaw Island.
---
At some point they will have to with private servers. else how are people going to find your private server. randomly join?
---
I'm going to clarify, I feel like the less informed dupers or those selling duped goods they got from dupers panicked because of all the talk about bans etc. I am not claiming every single duper has dropped their shit.
---
But to answer your question, I think the threat of bans and what not had a few of them spooked. PC already has another dupe glitch and apparently most of them didn't lose their stuff. 
---
the best part of the process to get the plans is that it can take 20-30 minutes and no quest markers to help, which means some people won't bother.   I keep a spare plan on me at all times and have sold/traded with it a couple times, not a lot, but a couple.  Sold it a couple times for 200-300 caps. there are people out there who know they can look it up online, but don't want the hassle. 
---
For a great guide that includes map locations and pictures, i suggest [checking out this guide.](http://dulfy.net/2018/11/21/fallout-76-nuka-cola-outfit-and-power-armor-paint-job-guide/)  it's actually the first thing that pops up when google searching.

I've got \~100ish "IOU All the Beer" notes I leave around peoples bases/in their death bags for fun. Started gathering them every time I passed a bunker in the Mire.
---
Sometimes I'll take their like 7 plastic because hey I could use that. Beer note 4 u then run away! They get the message that someones looted their bag and get pissed, get to it and see pretty much everything is there... what could be gone? What? I loot the whole bag and I'm forced to read a note? IOU all the beer? tf is going on?

Honestly notes are my favorite way of messing with people. A lot of creepy notes in the Lucky Hole Mine too. It's less about the contents of the note for messing with people, more just the title or name of the item. Notes auto place at the top of a loot box or bag, so If I'm careful I can order several in a row to send a cryptic message.
---
I'm really not one for "real" aggression in video games. Not every interaction is going to involve team work, so might as well spice up a strangers gameplay without harassing him or forcing him to get to know someone new. People seem to enjoy being goofed. Not very often you get a real character come across your path.
---
Wish I had the energy to straight up role play voice act at people. I don't really have shame. Uninstalled that feature after having... not much left to lose in college, haha. That and I'm the type of guy that tells you a joke not really to make *you* laugh, but for my own amusement as I consume either your laughter or cringing face as you say ughhhhhhh. Both are my favorite.
---
Have fun people! Don't be nervous around strangers. Even weird moments are fun in hindsight. Make someone reflect on their gaming for the night as they lay in bed and remember you, that guy that stalked them for 30 minutes shooting every enemy they attacked with a Bloat Fly Larva Syringer, causing every kill to make a fly, and sometimes those flies making flies. They knew someone must be doing something, but they never see you. They probably don't know about the syringer mod either, not many people pay it attention. They stand in puddles of dead enemies turning their camera for an extra 10 seconds trying to process what the hell is going on. You even go ahead of them clearing, dropping a note or two in a container they won't miss.
---
PvP doesn't have to be fighting. PvP doesn't have to be taking or giving someone your caps. PvP can be psychological warfare hidden under the guise of harmless giggles. 
---
Make your own fun. I think we've all realized at 50+ that not every moment of gameplay has to be about getting stronger. There is no grind or catching up. If you can get a \~2star weapon with 1 ok affix within your spec weapon class, you're kinnnnda set, all things considered. Yes you clear a silo slower than a TSE, but you can still clear a silo. Spending 40 hours after you're already making contributions vs the SBQ is going to have real diminishing returns. Don't feel obligated to make the vendor routes everyday. Don't feel obligated to go to a nuke zone. I've acquired my entire 3 star set of armor riddled with good weight reduce perks from ambient non-farming type of play. I float around 1k-2k caps and never have an issue when I find something I want to buy. Slow the game down and start thinking about how you want to actually enjoy yourself, not grind. 
---
Yes, you can tame wolfs, deathclaws and yaos to protect your camp 
---
I'll try that out
---
If you don’t play the game wtf are you even doing here? Oh right, being a know it all 🍕💩
---
All PS4?  I've had 0 on Xbox so far.  Then again it's too early to tell
---
Thank you for the insight 
---
Yeah, most people visited the Super Duper Mart (aka Ebay) and bought TSE weapons.
---
Don't you have to register your suit with the company to get the bonus?
---
Whats the push to talk button on pc, i never found it.
---
From the looks of this Reddit right now, not good lol!
---
Oh this needs some research, I thought you needed the whole suit.
---
And just because you don’t play the game doesn’t mean you’re not a cheater. There are other games people like you play. Not just F76
---
Most of the cheating is done on the PC. Consoles don't allow you to access the developer rooms that I'm aware of. I read about dupers on PC far more than PS4. 
---
I don’t know myself, but if you go into your controls settings under key bindings you can figure it out and remind it if you want
---
I guess this could be fun, if you enjoy playing in the low-level areas often, and if you dont mind devoting hours upon hours into a new character again, again and again, after a single death.
---
1. Be lucky  
---
2. Don't be unlucky

I’ve been picking them up out of habit, too. I wondered why I had so many circuits. 
---
I’m pretty sure they were more useful in the past. 
---
Idk, I competed the quest so ??
---
I agree i was playing for a short while and logging in went smoothly. Not a laggy entrance to the world 
---
Marine tactical helmet plans can spawn at the drop sites c2 and g3 in cranberry bog and the train car west of watoga station.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/?utm_source=reddit-android check out the spreadsheet there under recipies section. A lot of them can just be found laying around the world. If server hopping is your thing when you see a recipe in the world and already have it don't touch it. Log out and back in and it will change to something else.
---
Sugar is used in Cranberry Relish, which gives you +10% XP gain. The recipe is Cranberries, Gourds and Sugar. You can make Sugar with Snaptail Reeds that grow along the rivers. You can grow your own Gourds. There are 5 at Raleigh Clay's Bunker. You can find 10 Cranberries at Aaronholt Homestead. With Green thumb that's 20, so more than you could use before they spoil. If you make a big batch you could drop some for randoms or give them away to friends also.
---
I feel like it says that in one of the terminals while you're doing the quest. Pays to read stuff, which I don't do quite often enough myself.
---
You could drink whatever the pool contains. Eat the pool itself.
---
Do you really have to lie to people you've never met, and will probably never will? You bought it on Ebay, or got it from a duper friend. There, embrace the truth.
---
Omg.  That’s amazing.  I myself have been thinking of creating a themed camp...like a cabana.  I would hope something amazing like this would happen.
---
Or just glitch trough the bunkerdoor  with your power armor exiting and entering 
---
0 issues so far. Xbox. Same with my two friends.  
---
Maybe a PS problem rn? 
---
Jup. Had a pvp with a guy last week. Using TSE Weapons (weey what a wonder). My X01 legs had 200%. He shot one time. I die instantly and both legs get brocken. Even the torso were completely destroyed only survived with 5% by the One Shot 
---
They would have been safe in the wedding.
---
Thanks. I've seen you online but I'm usually wandering solo.
---
You mean the Ant-Agonist?

---
Be careful with this, in my experience its 50/50 you get the kill or she goes to an unaccessible area of the map and wont come back and you fail the event.
---
Radaway is cheaper than all the stims and ammo wasted if she runs away.
---
There are no non-VATS criticals in FO76 (or FO4).
---
Sneak attacks are are a separate multiplier. Headshots are a separate multiplier.
---
The critical receivers do nothing for you.
---
You could do it with less luck.  
---
Luck of the draw and Gunsmith kind of offset each other, and Gunsmith is too good with the over repair to not use.
---
I would use the three luck points to put points into the rifleman cards.
---
I also roll white night in Agility so I rarely need to repair my armour.
---
this is my plan next time i see either
---
Half of the time I can't turn the dang trap on.  I just leave then.
---
It's not as bad as the Protest Event in Grafton, but close.  That dang Protest Event never works right....lol
---
Honestly, I think most of it was blown out of proportion so people bought more stuff on Looking for Group in the last few days before the update. It makes sense that people selling the stuff would make it seem that much more "exclusive" to have this stuff as it is supposedly going to be taken away. 
---
No problem! I also like to team up with others because of the team bonuses under charisma. A lot of the time I team up with people but we just do our own things too, I'm totally fine with that too lol. 
---
Yeah on PC i've been dealing with it a few days now.. i run in to it all the time.  If i want to hit 10 or 1 of something i have a stack on.. its an annoyance.
---
Thanks so much 
---
Agreed and very much appreciated.
---
I saw one on either FO76 Bazzar or FO76 Market yesterday.  People were offering 15-25k caps for it.
---
You know you can move you camp elsewhere right? Someplace that doesn’t spawn baddies? I feel as though the game is trying to tell you that your camp is not in the safest of places...
---
I bought one from somebody.  Just collect all the vendor caps for a few days.
---
I would trade my top 5 weapon finds for a 2shot handmade or 2 shot gatling gun. No lie. Explosive is great for mobs, but it's kinda bullshit in other situations.
---
Not for about a week.
---
I know that salt can be used to cook Vegetable Medley Soup, which has some pretty good value.

Oh, whoops
---
I like to team up too. I’ll be on tonight add me i you wanna roll👍🏼 Tackleberry_G is my psn
---
Tighten nuts.
---
You are the chosen one - the progenitor to those super mutants that get addicted to stealthboys and have purple skin 
---
If he was rping he wasn't doing a good job imo. 
---
If you're going to raid it's gotta be worth your time, ya know? 
---
Camps for getting your wanted level up.
---
Already established workshops so you can get the benefits of others hard work. 
---
But some level 4? This guy just seems like he was trying to be a pest. 
---
Or maybe he is one of those duper hunters. Some of those guys aren't working with a full clip. 
---
do you have any code pieces on you?
---
A lot of dupers were testing it last night in anticipation for today. 
---
Yeah, I've only done questing and random exploring. Only been through two nuke zones and nearing level 50, but I ain't found shit. I just have three mediocre legendaries that I've kept, all one star, two from missions and the other from a vendor. Legendary enemies only ever drop worthless armor or melee weapons, maybe a couple times I got vats enhanced guns, but overall just disappointment every time. 
---
Very nice, cheers.
---
Is it just me or does 76 seem harder than other games?
---
I agree. I've had to buy all the stuff I have and sell stuff on the market to get caps. There really should be a buff to legendary drops. I really hate seeing a 3 star legendary and getting a 1 star wood leg piece. All the damn time....smh.
---
If you're already in Morgantown for pladtis run up the hill behind the school and look for the big power line towers, and look for a farm near one of them. The farmhouse was owned by a cat lady and has around 50 plastic in the form of cat bowls.
---
THANKS BIG TIME!
---
i imagine so, but it is a max 45% decrease, but their explosive damage can scale infinitely
---
I'm an hour in and it's at 6%
---
Sorry but is you calling me a "cheater" somehow supposed to make me upset? 
---
Chameleon armor doesn't take effect unless you crouch though right? 
---
Very strange. Some suggestions I would try would be. Log out naked and log back in. Completely close the game and open. Log on to another character and back again and finally just kill your character and respawn. See if any of those work.
---
They can infect you with a disease
---
Just out of curiosity, are you on PS? I've read a lot today that PS is having issues.
---
What kind of pistol?  I don't have anything good, but I'll keep my eyes open.
---
I agree, but some people cannot let it go
---
Oh yeah I've traded with those guys who have 1000s of everything. Nuts.
---
This reminds be of me of the last time of accepted a random team invite.
---
The level 40 that sent it had 200+ on their team with 5,000+ bounty! The 200 traveled to my base and left the team and then destroyed my entire base before I could quit out. 
---
Sounds like you are doing a good deed thought!
---
Dupers are *not* getting banned.
---
Yes. It is possible. It helps to hack all the turrets and make them target anything. Then you wont be as bothered with all the waves of robots. 
---
The problem is were using too many variables. We have the variable of the weapon and it's level. The players armour, power armour and their level.Then we throw in 50 possible points into perks, of which a minimum of 4 directlty effect damage, another is available to generally negate armour, etc. *Then* we throw in legendary effects on weapons, of which their can be up the 3. *Then* if using armour we throw in it's three legendary effects, a few which are completely pvp breaking in themselves.
---
Then all of that needs to be balanced against bullet spongy enemies with health significantly beyond that of players, as well as pvp.
---
Gear would still matter even if all that was considered was guns and armour. It just wouldn't be such a convoluted mess to work out.
---
You're quite welcome
---
Even it they don't have the diseased pre text?
---
They must be broken down!
---
An alternate spot is Blackwater mines. There are barrels of toxic waste out front and a rad shower right inside. 
---
Back to the list of interesting but probably not then!
---
Wait how do you hack the turrets? I’ve launched nukes before and never knew this!
---
I am a sneak sniper and I have launched a nuke solo, so yes, its possible.
---
NOOOOOOOoooo!! I had high hopes for stability 
---
Preferably a 10mm or pipe. Either explosive or two shot will work. Looking for something I can use with a silencer.
---
Now take all the springs out of each one, then put them back heh heh
---
I'd be so angry! People like that really leave a sour taste -_- I had someone come to my camp (I built a mansion in whitesprings lol) and inspect it, do the heart emote a couple times and then leave. A few minutes later he comes back with a HORDE of 20+ charred ghouls and leads them right to my base which they start destroying. Basically he tried to destroy my camp and got no bounty because it was the horde of ghouls he led to my doorstep doing the damage. 
---
I'm crying at work right now. I need to meet people like this XD
---
And the update duped(more than once) everything I had build to my CAMP, and inserted those to my CAMP storage. Thanks for all the materials update.
---
She's legit!  Came with and helped me during Belly of the Beast!  
---
That was set up on Reddit prior however haha.
---
I have to admit whenever I see a random team request from someone now even near me geographically on the map, I'm instantly "Who the fuck is this and what do they want!?"
---
Oh no!
---
You need the Ambi-Turner perk. Level 69 I think.
---
https://youtu.be/8hJ1HDcMowk
---
Yes you can easily solo silos and launch the nukes, I don't think you can solo the scorchbeast queen if you nuke fissure site prime both because you probably need a really insanely good build, armor, weapons and patience, and because people are bound to show up and help. Everything else is fine solo
---
Thanks been checking Harpers ferry and I’ve found Watoaga but haven’t completed the terrorist quest so I’m constantly agged by robots
---
Oooh. A clean version of the Clown costume...
---
The space suit recolour looks nice too.
---
God yes. I built a nice cabin at a campground way up north, in the Savage Divide, near the end of the map. Had it built to seem like the management home for the campground. Few mobs spawned a ways away, but nothing in the campground itself.
---
Logged off. Logged on later that day. Decided to move camp within 5 minutes. As soon as I spawned in, it got swarmed by level 30-40 super mutants, a few Liberators, followed immediately by wolves, then, as I started healing and repairing I hear the beating wings... Stay crouched, marked as hidden, scorchbeast doesn't realize I'm there. Oh, what's this, level 30 Scorched Conquerer spawned right outside the door?
---
Took out all the ground mobs, then just started dismantling everything as the scorchbeast ripped apart my base. Wasn't even attacking me, just blowing down walls and roofs.  I got pretty good at spamming E-Space-R-R (repair and store - since repair cost less on walls at least than rebuilding).  Once I had it down to nothing, I just started booking it down the cliffs.
---
Still took another 5 minutes for the beast to stop, and that was only because another pack of super mutants eventually spawned right in front of me again, and aggro'd it.
---
Took another hour to salvage enough caps and supplies to relocate to the junk pile cliff near the Fort Defiance / Monorail Elevator area. 
---
No proof.
---
Bethesda is probably implementing tracking methods to do a wave later like any company would do
---
Actually no, it won't work. I remember now, I tried that and it won't work because if you do that you can't close the door behind you, or as you leave (depends on where the terminal is) 
---
Otherwise you need both switches anyways, or you lock yourself in if you leave the switch outside AND it can still be turned on and off without the terminal. 
---
It's been fine for me so far. Short loading times and less lag. For me, at least. 
---
They won't ban anyone. Who's gonna buy from the atomic shop then?
---
I walked into my local grocery store and saw stacks of wood, piled just like they are in fo76. I legit stopped my fiance and he was like wtf r u doing and I was like WOOD SCRAPS!!!
---
I use a 3\* pitchfork I found at like level 20, and a 3\* robot chest I just found the other day (about level 42).  I think those are the only ones I've come across after about 120 hours of play... but then, that doesn't bother me hehe. I like that they're very rare, as 1\* and 2\* are still decent, and it's that much more fun when I get the rare drop. ;)
---
That said, I just started paying more attention to non-plans that vendors sell, because I've spent most of my time saving to buy camp stuff. So I show up to Watoga Station yesterday and what do I see? The vendor is selling like half a dozen legendaries, and one of them is a 3\* level 50 Deathclaw fist weapon. +1 agi, +40% power attack damage, and damage increases as my health drops. Pretty damn good with the base damage of 100. I bought that sucker for like 125 caps, so it was a steal.
---
I know it's not the same thrill as getting a drop, but I would recommend you check out these high level vendors too.
---
Honestly the amount of time I've spent farming vs the cost of buying them. It was cheaper buying the serums. At one point I had the three I wanted tried to remove one negative one then was back to the drawing board.
---
I've decided my next alt is going to be a barbed walking cane and single shot ivory gripped pistol build... See you at the next queen fight!
---
I stood on one as my buddy hit the plunger. I didn't fly too far as I put on PA to avoid death, but it was still fun. The edge of the map is close by so it may cut you off either way.
---
Kalli (?) the moo-moo is my favorite
---
In the start menu go to character and it'll bring all your characters up and make a new one
---
I was like that too lol but I'm at the point where I'm a high enough level and I have enough crafting resources that if they try and screw around it's not a huge deal I'll just log out and repair the damage.
---
I'm on ps4 and between me and the guy I run with we've had 7 crashes (blue screens) in the hour we've be on.
---
Thanks for the offer it’s just the rash of griefers killing me I get so paranoid 
---
I’ll send you a pm next time I’m online 
---
My experience was post nuke launch zone. 3 hrs.long. Grabbed everything. Went into whitepsring and I couldnt sort through inventory. took my an hour just to sell. Since then I have been keeping things trimmed so my game can process.
---
I think they have made improvements. But that experience made me wary.
---
This. Mods are made of a variety of materials including copper, aluminum, steel, wood, and probably more. Check your mods to see what they scrap into and make sure to have a lot of spare junk of that type available so building doesn't eat into your mods. Until Bethesda bothers to fix this glaring problem (seriously, they fixed scrapping hardened masses in the patch but the didn't remove mods from the scrappable list!?). 
---
I mean it’s probably more efficient to just tag the component you need than memorizing every component of junk
---
Congrats grad. 
---
Simply put, a narcissist without a spine. 
---
There can only be one Aquaman! Jason Momoa 😍🤣
---
Or better yet, PvP and PvE servers.  I don't enjoy PvP and I would be pissed if someone came by and destroyed my camp, costing me tons of resources to repair.  Let me opt out from being involved in this stupidity and leave me out of it. I get that some people would enjoy the aspect of trying to figure out how to break into some places, etc, however let them play on a server that people opt into that behavior for.  Not the other way around.  That's why WoW and other MMO's have PvP servers.  For people to know going in, that they could have their stuff messed with.  
---
Sorry to hear that :( if you need help with quests or resources let me know :) 
---
There are terminals you need to hack for every section of the silo. Some are behind locked doors (level 3).
---
For what it is worth I did try to report this bug the day the patch for PC Dropped.  Guess they didn't fix it in time. 
---
I didnt see it there, but then again i play with a controller on pc
---
Yup had two Eastern Europeans trash my CAMP claiming they were hunting duper’s. They’re level 200+ I’m 99. Missed a Scorched Earth Event with friends because of it. 
---
Then went on to complain that Todd Howard made a bad game. 
---
Fuck it. 
---
I’ve met some great people on this game. Folks I really enjoy playing with. And I never play online games. 
---
No matter where you go, there you are. 
---
Very nice resource. Thanks for your time and effort in this!
---
I'm not interested in joining, but if you would like a raider group to go head to head with my team is always down for a challenge.
---
It would be cool is you could set up a rapid response discord. This way people can get in contact with you when they need you. Look up the fuel rats from elite dangerous for an example of what I mean.
---
Just use the barbed pitchfork
---
You do know that they have banned people? Not dupers thou, which is a shame.
---
I don't think you can bulk those items that can be sold on their own. 
---
I've generally been using power armor so far, which is why I didn't look at White Knight. Does power armor hamper this build or am I still golden on that front? 
---
You might be right. That slowdown was brutal at the time.
---
Post a pic 
---
Yep. That's how I knew when they gave up
---
I didn't make it, just sharing it. 
---
It is true. Needing 175G free on a 500G drive to install a 60G game is beyond reasonable. 
---
100 % u can solo it I did it at level 50 something on my first play thru not knowing what to do.  took me a long ass time and about 80  stimpacks to figure it all out but for sure u can do it   Was hard to do in power armor because of not knowing where to go where the quest marker on my HUD was all over the place ..but ya go for it ...  good luck 
---
Nice I'll check it out. Really liking that part of the map lately. Lots of materials around that i didn't know about
---
I believe there are level 2 or level 3 consoles in the "bust the mainframe panels" portion of it, like 1/4 or 1/2 of the way through. I assume that's where you would do it, although I was too busy getting shot at to try it, haha. 
---
It helps to have a team, even an extra player or two helps.
---
The people that are soloing it in 20 mins have it down to a science and are using the best end-game weapons and armor.
---
I could probably solo it in 30 minutes without power armor (an extra 10 mins for me getting lost...lol).
---
Let us put a sickle on the end of it and make it a scythe! 
---
That could be part of your problem, it wouldn’t be in controller controls. When you have meticulous things like PTT you just don’t have enough buttons on a controller
---
Same lay claims its happened, but no proof so far, time will tell
---
i actually found a TSE shotgun and other explosive weapons (best one was a zealots explosive gatling) way before duping was well known and before the explosive damage bug was  fixed, so i could rarely use it. if duping never began, i would be king of the wastes!!
---
Wait, are you saying bobble heads of the same kind stack???
---
The loot tends to be better from 2 star and 3 star legendaries, they get up to 3 legendary affixes, check the drops next time and examine them if you see the piece of armor/weapon has 2 or 3 diamonds around its name (it's X on pc)
---
They can specifically be targeted by the Perception perk card for bonus damage. They also emit radiation dmg like an aura
---
Yep and Bethesda knows this recent patch broke something for many people and still pushed it out to you all anyways.
---
Sounds like Turret’s Syndrome. 
---
Tetris Effect hitting you hard.
---
That's the ONLY behemoth I've seen in 76. A level ~70 EPIC Super Mutant Behemoth. 
---
Good to know!
---
Woah Woah there, applying real data to this obvious genius analysis based purely in fact and not delusion is way out of line /s
---
Please! Although I enjoy the white springs bar, it would be convenient to make my own whiskey. 
---
Damn man, those are some feisty mole rats!
---
My base is attacked pretty much every time I return, but it's always 1-4 dudes (usually just 2). I kill them fast, no problems. They do a bit of damage to the base but it takes awhile before anything gets destroyed, other than my crops... which are exposed anyway and easy to repair.
---
I dunno, doesn't seem like much of a problem to me, but if you're having some bad luck maybe moving camp location would help? Or you could do the thing where you build a more elevated camp so the majority if your stuff can't be dicked with.
---
I desperately need something like shared storage. I'm about to probably start dropping stuff in a container and rejoining a random friends server to transfer stuff. I have too much stuff and it's affecting my experience. But a lot of the stuff I just can't throw away. I would also like to have a separate storage, to keep special things in. Like if I want to store some of my best items it would be nice to have a separate stash to put them so I can sort through stuff easier.
---
This game had pvp?  Been playing since release and never felt like killing other people was worth the effort as vats and exploding weapons turn everyone into an npc.
---
Don't quote me on this, but I think I got Swamp Gas once from sleeping on the ground.
---
Relogging fixes that. Its just a new bug.
---
I had it before this patch
---
Lol.  
---
Q: Why’d you get fired from work? 
---
A;  Stealing office supplies.
---
Q: How did you get caught?
---
A: I didn’t try to hide it because I just  assumed someone would replace them by the time I showed up at work the next day.
---
Worried about your account?
---
Make sure you're not using Full Strength Rad-X.  That suppresses all of your mutations.
---
Diluted Rad-X and whatever the Swamp Bloom thing is don't suppress mutations.
---
Most of the time I don't bother with Rad-X.  Just wear power armor in the  nuke zone.
---
So why is bloodied such a good perk for melee? Is it a large increase compared to something like junkies or berserker? And if so, why aren't guns with it seemingly as sought after? 
---
Glowing means they are radiated.  
---
What problems did you have with it?
---
Watch you get all the good plans now
---
Man, I wish I got marsupial again. I got it too low level and haven't been able to get it back since a radaway. 
---
But I believe for future reference, Grape Nuka Cola will not remove mutations but just the rads. There is a soda jerk in the whitesprings resorts, main floor, that sells it. 
---
Go with just the software standard version not sure if you want to invest in the bicentennial or PA versions 
---
I bought mine in November when it was ~$69? 
---
Directly from bethesda.
---
Aside from the griefer molesters out there for me, the UX/CX Has improved since bethesda has improved their patch mgmt.
---
lol well played, this matches my death causes as well.
---
&gt; but more content comes out soon
---
Going to need a source on that one mate.
---
I read the post in John’s voice.
---
They should prevent people from seeing you when you're at your camp unless in a party together because of the griefers. 
---
2h melee build, I don't need a rare ass special or duped weapon to 1 shot everything. But my +40% swing speed, vampire, instigating super sledge sure is fun anyway. I don't honestly play my melee toon much anymore though, I've been building different characters and seeing what I can make ridiculously strong without relying on tse guns.
---
Turn that piece into a sniper
---
I had left something in my car overnight and before I got on the road this morning I thought to myself, “I should really take that out of my inventory.”

---
Done!
---
Like an additional damage to animals or something
---
Same build roughly, and same result! It took me two tries - The first time, I was under the mistaken impression that launching a nuke wasn't equivalent to like an endgame dungeon, haha. 
---
Bring plenty of stimpacks and ammo with you - I went through about 200 pieces of 45 rounds. Power armor, Rad-X, a healthy supply of Radaway or a radiation suit helps, since there is a portion where you have to deal with radiation leaking out of pipes. And depending on how quickly you move through things, it can take anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes your first time, I'd guess. 
---
Haha, vampires Fatman is like aoe healing
---
What...do you plan on going chicken hunting?
---
That's already an effect. It's the "Hunter's" Legendary prefix. 
---
I'm talking about the green shimmer/cloak surrounding them. 
---
We know more content is coming out, so really just depends on what your definition of 'soon' is. Soon for me is probably about a month. We haven't gotten a confirmation date tho
---
When I was about lvl 30 I was standing with a group of lower lvls checking out this really cool camp on the river in Flatwoods.  This lvl 8 in only underwear decides to start punching two lvl fives. He kills them and starts again when they respawn with their group. Then he punched me. LOL. I shot him once with my combat rifle and he's like Oh Crap and tries to run. I lock on with VATS and unload in him.  He respawned and just stood there quietly. Pretty funny.
---
Probably not a good idea when people have started being banned for going into unacessible areas..
---
Your account though, have at it.
---
Be selective when destroying turrets. They don't actually do much damage, and they do a great job of distracting the adds.
---
I mainly picked up resources ain't gone lie I spend 90% of my in game time scavenging 😂 dude wanted to just throw away 100s of bulk who wouldn't pick it up😂😂😂😂
---
There is no way.  I deleted absolver to make room for FO.  Red Dead 2 is 107 g.  It has updated several times with only 40 g of space.  GTA5 couldn't update if this was the case because the game is over half my total storage.  
---
Oof, I'm sorry. I hope they fix it soon
---
YAY!!!
---
Whatever, im just annoyed at the irl money cost of Atomic points😔
---
I saw two hanging out by Flatwoods and freaked out. Why? Because apparently I'm easily excited.
---
My 3.4gb download just finished and it's copying. If I don't respond I only had the single 3.4gb patch. I was fully updated until this point. Also PS4
---
What was added specifically?
---
&gt;anarchistic reactionary !
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9MiS9tn_r4
---
You can change the view of your pipboy (for pc, it's V), that may help. If you have any armor with chameleon, try taking it off. 
---
Oh sorry. There's nothing different about them, they just ten to be tougher and have that radiation aura. The loot is the same
---
Not all. Heard about this and tried with unarmed damage, 4 extra did nothing. Perk increases do nothing. Honestly smells like its either JUST explosive or something. Which LOL of all the bobbleheads.
---
New Prey reference for those that wondered. If you get too many mutations the turrets go from friendly to viewing you as an alien.
---
I thought I had checked, but just checked again and it says 0h 0min for all three. I noticed I have several cards for beta and alpha under misc... I will try another bunker on another server.
---
Ok hopefully it can work 
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124)  
---
Of course as stated before. Mods aren't there for console players. Feeling sorry for you there. But yeah. Quickly go into your inventory, hammer T and have muscle memory which perk loadout is for what weapon.  
---
For me for example. 1 is for non PA melee and 2 for non PA ranged.  
---
3 is for lockpicking, 4 is for general use like traveling and trading. 5 is for crafting and 6 for repair.  
---
7 is for PA ranged combat and 8 for PA melee.
---
Got Radaways on the reserve for that shit 
---
Step 1 - Figure out what mutations you want.
---
Step 2 - Farm 3-4 MAX of the mutations you want.  If you get one you don't want, use Diluted Radaway to try and peel just 1 mutation off (sometimes it'll delete the one you don't want, sometimes it will take away one you do want).
---
Step 3 - Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar and BUY serums for the rest of your mutations.  They generally cost anywhere from 500-1000 caps per serum.
---
It's super easy once you go to the marketplace.  Farm up a couple of mutations for free, then buy the rest.
---
Get out.
---
No worries, thanks for being helpful though!
---
Yes as far as i know those can infect you because they are glowing green.
---
How can I post them in here 
---
Shop isnt even appering in the menu for me lol
---
Btw, there’s an updated version with the furniture and all the rest as well... its somehwere here on reddit
---
No I just looked the codes up on google 
---
its only if they stack a ton of bobbleheads. their damage scales infinitely. people running around doing 500k damage per hit
---
This was made by a Reddit user named bolsey.  Posted here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afcgjc/comment/edxfprk 
---
Now it says 40gb/50gb. Before that it changed from 40 to 50. Now it jumped to 1.7gb.
---
Keeps jumping around with download size. Wtf is going on.
---
I'm 49 and my brother is 57. We've both been playing fallout for years. I'm PC and he's xbox, so we can't play together unfortunately.
---
From my understanding there's way to do it with enclave shop instructions were posted yesterday. Not sure if that is what is causing the server issues . Personally i think the game was  rushed  out for the holidays an while dupers share a part of the blame for server instability people here seem unable to hold Bethesa accountable for releasing a poorly optimized game. 
---
Ah ok 
---
you can use the perk card that reduces the amount you need, or go on a few junk runs. 
---
Easy fix for that!
---
..."that one didn't count, clearly, my brain agrees, this is still fun, let us continue"
---
At first mine said 50 Gb update. I paused update and started it and it was normal 
---
Power patcher!!
---
When are we gonna get more hairstyles and apparel is the real question!
---
I think legendaries without the shimmer are bugged.
---
They lose that shimmer when they regen their health.
---
Managed to hit a fly mid air, looked at a friend 
---
Friend: „that’s cheating, you used VATs“
---
I donno about pc but smackignthag screen shot button on a ps4 is risky business with a buggy game.
---
Yes, as a heavy weapons Frank Horrigan I can confirm the most dangerous things to me are firing my gun to close to myself... and rads. Also it damages my power armor. 
---
 No. There would be lots. Just you idiots would be gone. Works for me.
---
 Its a game I play. I don't cheat at games.
---
I'm on xbox sadly, my WiFi has been a bit crap lately, trying to disconnect my other devices so speed it up but still
---
Im on PS4, My PSN is Thixxy and what happened is that I joined a server and spawn in a nuked zone and I noticed that my hp was almost just all taken over from radiation so I just sat there and die from it, my game breaks keeps me alive with 10 health for 5 mins, kills me, I respawn back at my base and get my power armor. I fast travel to a area near the nuke zone and start running towards it, I didn't noticed that i had no hp for sum reason and 2 minutes into me running I just die, I kept dying for the same reason 5 times in a row. I want to enjoy the game but seriously, there are so many problems that need to be fixed.
---
"Everyone and their mum's packing TSE around here"
---
Seriously though, pretty much every server now. My buddy and I took over a workshop a couple days ago. Guy shows up, full melee build, gets wiped. Que awesome gameplay mechanic(/s). He squats down on a ridge and starts unloading a TSE auto shotgun. We could tell he wasn't even built for it considering we weren't instantly obliterated. These weapons that were supposed to be super rare are available to anyone with a few thousand caps and it shows
---
First run through I did a lot of quests at various levels.
---
Second time I made it to level 50 before I did ANY of the main quests.  Reason is........any unique in-game quest rewards scale with your level.  Do the quest at level 15, get a level 15 item.  If you wait till you're level 50, you'll get a level 50 item.  FYI the quest weapons and armor aren't the greatest.  Good pieces but not end game by any means.
---
Do whichever method you like better :)
---
Haha I was genuinely interested 
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one that's done that, saw my brothers weights and thought 'I'll need that for ammo later' to instantly feel stupid after the thought 
---
Some of my best weapons are gifts from a friend that farmed whitesprings. But I do have some that I've gotten from events (like the enclave one in Watoga and Sons of Dane) that ended up being pretty good.
---
Yeah I reached 84k per shot
---
Sure, I'll just accept a random invite from someone named PYROgirl....yeah... that'll end well for my wooden base....
---
No. People are amazing. They can do amazing things with shitty tools.
---
Thanks for that!
---
The play time set new power armor skin and stuff that isnt limited time 
---
Can I read about it anywhere 
---
Northwest of Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm. Junk Node next to some water. It’s a bit cramped but I got great use out of it.
---
What is a tse dragon?
---
Uuuuh... completely forgot that a syringe gun is in the game xD  
---
What about... never mind we already have a catling gun in game. I guess it would be cool to have a mod that fires needles faster than a syringe on BB?
---
It’s fun if you want to explore and build. There is no end-game but that’s isn’t an issue for me. I’m only level 50 after about 90 hours. There are plenty of players in the game. If you can get it for $40 or less it’s worth it but I wouldn’t recommend paying more than that. 
---
If you can find a good way to defend them, I'm sure they are. The problem I've found is the scorchbeast destroys the them and other turrets far to quickly.
---
Should've waited for them to die. Then steal their junk. 
---
The games can spawn enemies in your camp anywhere.  Mine is currently on top of a satellite dish really high up.  Yesterday when I fast traveled to it there were 2 super mutants on the ground attacking it and 2 inside the locked portion of the camp on top of the dish.
---
Just play another game either they fix it or they don't no reason to make yourself upset.
---
Super weird. But also doesn't surprise me. I haven't played since last update. I'm hoping this fixes stability. One time I crashed to home screen and the entire application was deleted. I had to download the entire game over again lol 
---
Have people been banned for accessing the Vaults? If so, that's a lot of players to be banned. I get the dev room because of how people are selling the items irl and whatnot but just exploring shouldn't issue a ban. Have you tried it personally?
---
This is my day to day  PA rifle/melee build.  (Obviously I have an explosive rifle though)
---
Which I then switch to heavy guns/rifle for queen fights, since I like my armor in one piece and keep out of her clutches.
---

---
Someone griefed my camp 2 weeks ago because I wouldn't trade with them and I still have partially damaged items. I think there should be an option to repair partially damaged items and/or they regenerate over time.
---
Anyone know if the decontamination shower works or just for looks?
---
Ha! Thats hilariously broken!  
---
Or fast travel at increased cost when overencumbered.
---
And again, because of a patch I'm forced to not play the game. It's been around a month now since I played Fo76, between the crashes and constant server drops and now this... I hope I can play it again one day.
---
I like it. I like syringer too but it is soooo underpowered that there is no way to use it past like lvl 10.
---
Somehow we're becoming lowkey LARP people.
---
Also, nice! Disgusting, but skilled
---
It definitely works!
---
Talk to psn support if you want to hear it from the horses mouth.
---
I'm not going to argue about something that you've never experienced before.
---
Yea I've only used mine in PVP once against a guy who kept trying to hit me with a Super Sledge. I keep pacifist on... so I waited for him to go away turned it off when he shot me with a plasma rifle. A three round burst from my TSE Light Machine Gun and 81 of his caps going into my pocket caused him to leave the server and send me angry messages.
---
I built south east and get roaming friendly screaming bitches. They \*REALLY\* hate my concrete walls. They don't attack me and will fly past a lot happily but not without spamming at one section of wall. When they're done they fly off only to come back and start on another, usually in the same section of the 'square' of walls. Quite annoying having to rebuild that and anything behind the wall that its spam hits.
---
WTF O.o
---
Some weird shit happens with fo76 its unreal. 
---
all the files for the silver shroud (no submachine gun skin tho)  are there so it will probs appear somewhen in the future 
---
I run a very similar build to yours (rifle sneak crit with 12P, 12A, 15L), without the melee, and actually find it easier to solo. Group play increases spawns and messes with my stealth.
---
The one section that killed me more than once my first run was the radiation part, since I wore a hazmat suit with very little mitigation and was attacked by turrets, assaultrons, etc. occasionally that I missed in VATS or were hidden behind pillars. The second time I came, I ran with RadShield/RadX instead and murdered the whole facility, no problem.
---
It's a 4 barrel black powder rifle that can reach almost 300 damage with no perks and TSE means two shot explosive
---
Is the blackbird PA paint finally available again? 
---
Fix it good too!
---
As far as I can tell the only two that arent atom shop are this one and the BoS paint for the T60
---
Can i get a photo of the map location if possible?
---
Put on an item that gives the Chameleon effect, let it trigger and then move again. Or use a Stealthboy, I believe.
---
Nah man but if dupers were id of been banned
---
"You idiots" .... You're clearly the idiot here, since you assume:
---
1) that I cheat
---
2) that I even play the game, when I don't even own it
---
That's been my goto since Fallout 3, seems to be the most accurate as well.
---
If only man if only 
---
i got back to my camp once when i noticed a person standing in it. found half my workshop destroyed but couldnt find out why and the guy didnt have a bounty. turned my sound up and heard some shiteating molerat chomping at my stuff. he spawned under my foundation and was eating everything through the floor. i had to remove half my shit just to access him then spend another 30 minutes trying to get it all to fit back correctly. i've since upgraded to concrete foundations and havent had an issue
---
You are not the target customer poor person. Now keep quiet and get back to playing so the whales have someone to show off their $50 garage door to.
---
I found a Two shot explosive Gatling gun. Not max lvl tho.
---
If you post that picture online with information on who they are instead of using the channels in place like the police, it is the same.
---
Someone just made [this excellent post](https://reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/ag0tqi/psa_some_tips_if_you_are_going_to_launch_a_nuke/) on r/fo76FilthyCasuals with tips for people who want to launch a nuke solo. I saved it for later once I work up the nerve to try it.
---
Ps4?
---
I just set up camp on a junk pile, so I’m hoping that helps with screws and gears a bit
---
Ok but how about plastics? you may ask...some people will say any high schools would be a good place, but let me just say that i got a LOT of plastics from Whitespring, yeah you heard me
---
those golf clubs and golf balls? those one that were scattered everywhere, bunch of them resting on the golf club walls? yeah, those...scrap those, they were fantastic source for plastic...
---
you can also find the golf clubs randomly on golf bags, scattered nears the tees outside, and some nearby the big house's entrance! i could easily collect about 20 clubs and double handful of balls one a sweep, lots and lots of plastics
---
oh and you are also taking part of saving the environment from plastic invasion...so...double awesome!
---
or have them regen on a new server, anything already destroyed wouldn't but a new server should regen all partially damaged structures.

---
You're welcome, no problem
---
I swear even server stability/etc applies to this
---
I swear my console has been stable as fuck as if Bethesda had been developing games for the console for a decade or something. 
---
Meanwhile on my computer/reddit I see a ton of complaints while all of my console friends report no trouble. Meanwhile I hear of rampant exploiters, High level try hards, and duping so I wouldn't be surprised if those were all the "can't kill that which has no life" players on PC. 
---
On console we have LFGs of kids looking to roleplay just ad much as serious team proposals. I've never seen any of the plotting that I've seen on a PC discord lol
---
Besides the standard launch day online problems 76 was pretty solid for a bugthesda game. Also on Xbox my experience has been positive af too.
---
In my experience I've never seen an *asshole* on 76. Especially never consistently. Very interesting!
---
I mean yeah, I don't have a 3 star legendary pitchfork with faster swing, bloodied, and +1 STR though.. 
---
Yup!

Didn't get it so gone for the nuclear option of reinstalling on X Box

 **Camp guide program v3.4** ?
---
[https://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Camp\_guide\_program\_v3.4](https://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Camp_guide_program_v3.4)
---
Frank Horrigan, United States Secret Service... that's who.
---
I have met dupers. They have told me that intentionally crashing the server is part of duping process.
---
I blame Bethesda but this new duping glitch is evil.  The old one had so much overreaction but destroying an entire server is the fault of duppers.  They know that to dupe they need to take down a server and they do. 
---
It is relative to your perception and agility stats.  Agility decreases the range players can see you while stealthed whereas Perception increases your range to detect others.  So a person with high agility can easily hide from a STR build, but a Sniper build will see them a decent ways off.
---
may i introduce you to the new changes to the fire proof perk? each level now reduces explosive damage by 15%, this also appears to stack with the dense mod for armor chestpieces, leading to an approximately 90% reduction in explosive damage. i tested it last night and was able to take an orbital strike to the face without issue.
---
Here are some of my tips
---
**AID** : I think something should be said about Aid in your inventory. I found a schematic for a water purifier and immediately built it in my settlement. I come across a lot canned dog food and boiled water- essential in the beginning when you don't have any recipes. Rad X is also abundant once you explore and so is radaway (most ghouls drop the diluted versions) so don't keep so many in your inventory. Stimpacks are expensive in stores but the diluted one is cheap. Food, I find doesn't help with health much. But purified water and nuka cola (all versions) do. 
---
I say this in all sincerity :**KEEP ALL DISEASE CURES\~! DO NOT SELL THEM**. They are rare and you will need them if you don't have many perks. Even at the rank i have (45) i sometimes allow myself to have a disease to keep the cures or give it to a lower leveled player in need. 
---
**A HELPFUL GLITCH**\-Also, a game glitch i use (sorry Bethesda) When i first started the game, I would encounter unevenly leveled enemies in a location. What i would do is exit the game and come back. Usually the enemies will be different, most of the time easier to beat 
---
**BEATING ENEMIES**:Scorch zombies are the easiest to beat(of the enemies that fire back) along with the Chinese liberator robots- a pipe revolver would do. Same thing with Feral dogs,  Feral Ghouls (if not in a closed space) are easy but come at you 5 or six at a time-pick them off with a rifle. Ticks are annoying, Radroaches too. I usually use a knife to dispatch them. I notice that molerats are a pain in the ass and move around and you will waste bullets so i use a quick melee weapon on them.  Super mutants i use a shotgun, especially if i go into a one door room they come to me and i kill them one by one. Robots vary from type to type and the weird animal hybrids are each a challenge of their own. Note to the really new players- if you see a Scorch beast- RUN INDOORS (not indoors of your settlement) I have found if i went into a place that had a loading screen the beast would be gone. 
---
**Places you want to frequent**: Flatwoods, all the area around Flatwoods (including the Overseeres cache)(sometimes you can find a supply drop), Morgantown airport (lots of health items and a vendor inside the airport) and ofcourse Whitesprings. I'm sure there are more as you level up but you can find those on your own.
---
But you can't bulk screws.... 
---
4 crashes in an hour on PS4 Pro
---
Isn't there a build where standing still ups your defense to god-tier?
---
Came to ask this too. Can anyone confirm

Logged in and CAMP spawned fast with no frame drop or lag. It's smooth as buttah so far (30 minutes in). Country Roads is playing....feels good man.

Well me and my friends just started out (we are both "squeaker's") but that does not deter us from roaming Appalachia

He usually pops between lvl60-80 it seems. There's a few hidden around the map and tbh it's kinda something of a let down. The dumb AI of skyrim giants meets the copypasted animations from 4's Swan
---
You have to make a distinction.
---
One Handed = Ski Sword, Machete, Switchblade
---
Fist = Mole Miner, Deathclaw, Power Fist
---
I really haven't seen a lot of players using One Handed.  Tried selling some on the trading reddits and got nowhere fast.  Fist and Two Handed seem really popular, with Two Handed being the more popular of the two.
---
Two Handed Most Popular = Gragnak Axe, Super Sledge
---
Fist Most Popular = Deathclaw and Power Fist
---
improvise. adapt. overcome. with the changes to fireproof, TSE's in pvp are dead, long live the bloodied deathclaw gauntlet.
---
Just a small point of note in your weapon list for Melee is that some of those are 2H, 1H melee while others are actually Unarmed and count as fist weapons with no benefit from melee perks. I was surprised to see only 1 unarmed perk card when all other damage types have 3 separate cards (entry level, experienced, master). 
---
Feel free to send a friend request and if you see me online feel free to join my server :) I may already be in a team but I periodically check to see if anyone in my friends list has joined my server

A legendary fat man called the daisycutter that weight 90% less, you can get it t ella ames bunker.

I don't see anything in there that provides a source for 'more content soon'. Since you consider 'soon' to be about a month I would expect some sort of 'This content coming in February' post, perhaps you'd like to revise your definition of 'soon' to 'this year' so that this *source* actually fits?
---
Yup. I've been selecting kneel with my pip boy light on and it's very clearly posturing toward the bag while highlighting it with the pip boy light!
---
It better be single player game.
---
Only thing I would like is being able to see other players and maybe fight each other.
---
Now this is a challenge I can hang my hat on.
---
you can have Momoa. I want Mermaid Man!
---
The Internet was better before it became about making money.  Not in all ways, but certainly in many.
---
No one needs to craft 300 or more of any item. If you do craft that much you should just get banned. 1st offense a few days. 2nd a week or two. 3rd lifetime. 
---
I was doing the talking animals quest and it sent me to a location where one player was staying for a length of time. I didn't know how the quest worked, so I assumed he was doing the quest too. Nope. His base was just there and when I arrived, his turrets ruthlessly gunned down all the targets spawned exclusively for me. Freaked the other guy out though when a bunch of toads just spawned inside his base.
---
Would core chems include Psycho and Mentats?  I found those at the enclave medical bay but I haven't found Buffout or Med-X
---
 Go away then. You have no business here. We suffer from these assholes and they are wrecking our game.
---
4 sets. You have to go back a few times.
---
After playing roughly 150 hours I think I looted 2 Two-Shot weapons (a low level handmade and a double-barreled shotgun) and a single explosive (10mm pistol). And about one and a half billion zealots/mutans/nocturnal etc. garbage weapons, of course.  
---
Chances of looting a TSE gotta be pretty low.
---
Oh derp, yeah you're right.
---
My point is the time between needing a repair is nuts and even at 50+ per leg its not hard to get a massive over supply of them.
---
That just looks cluttered and ridiculous, imho. And I can’t see it being possible without exploits. OP’s is way better and looks more like a part of the game. 
---
Imgr
---
I would be fine with a temp ban. The bans that have been coming out recently are perma aren't they? I'm not sure. 
---
When Rise of Iron was about to be released for Destiny, you could glitch into the new area. Bungie decided to start banning players that did so but only if they picked up the dead ghost boosting their grimoire score. I would assume it's the same in Fallout 76. There should be no damage done as long as you keep your head down in areas that aren't accessible yet. But then again different companies so. 
---
Are you against glitching into the Vaults?
---
I would guess we get Ghoul NPCs first.
---
Cute. I'm not gonna change your mind. Sounds like hate is your default. However the heavy grind to become a God with the gun was fun, and rewarding. 10/10 would pick up another explosive weapon. 
---
Wouldn't... Wouldn't that make it multiplayer?
---
FINALLY! Thank you so much for making this! I've been writing all my plans down and this will help me narrow down what I still need :)
---
I use an anti-armor handmade with 50% crit damage more often than my 2se for PvP. 2 shot is super inaccurate, even if it says 95% in VATS it's significantly less likely to hit. 
---
 Now, if I could find an anti-armor explosive handmade I'd have it made. (If anyone has one on PS4 I'll buy!)
---
Hell, there are people that were up to $1200 probably almost a week ago. I can only imagine what they were up to now when they had an additional 5 days of sale time. 
---
Is artillery as cool as it was inf fallout 4?
---
A lot of it depends on your location 
---
I mean, I was farming White Springs on my alt starting at level 12 so it's indeed possible.

assassin's + sentinels armor + damage reduction perks

If you don't need rad resist T-51b is actually the best set in the game.

I have a lvl 25 3* pitchfork on xb1 I've been trying to give away.. But the low levels just run away from me! Also, I don't remember the actual bonuses of it right now...

Does Aria know of your plans? You'll log on to find yourself surrounded by Eclipse and Blood pack one day. 
---
You can take the Prototype paint off at a PA stand. :) 
---
Like I said, soon depends on your definition of soon. We know it's coming, we know we should expect a patch every couple of weeks, and we know they mentioned specifically that more content is being worked on right now. You seem to be purposefully dense and argumentive haha
---
There’s a cheevo for getting hit by a mini-nuke in Fallout 4. That was hilarious enough that it rather took the sting out of it. 
---
Get fucked.
---
Hope you get flagged and banned
---
&gt; Are you against glitching into the Vaults?
---
yes
---
Considering as of about a week ago there was a auction selling a bundle of 10 Legendaries for $45 with over 30 "sold" I'd say quite a number of people.
---
The dude at that point had made over $1,200 in duped weapon sales.
---
Going down the list that day I saw a few others that were each in the $600 areas selling like $4.99 serums
---
The is a reason these type of auctions and websites exist... people *are* dumb enough to buy them.  
---
I could use any stealth build items you can spare though I'm not lvl 50 yet - would just save them.
---
Can you find them in the game atm or are they unreleased?
---
Yes lol, but I guess maybe kinda like how dark souls is set up
---
&gt; Like I said, soon depends on your definition of soon.
---
And you said your definition of soon is about a month. So where is the source for new content next month?
---
Knuckles, Powerfist and mole Miner gauntlet, those weapon are really cool. I love some of the unarmed weapons in fallout NV, too bad they didn't made it for F4/76
---
 The Blade of Baset is my favorite. Nearly hits 100 at top level and ignores some armor.
---
Durability and CND are the same thing. 
---
Yeah I think nerfing or separating TSE is a given. But even the two-shot affix alone is significantly more powerful than most of the other legendary affixes. Legendary affects in general really need an overhaul/rebalance.
---
I get the point, but doesnt really sound like you guys are that good if this is the method you have to use.
---
That's what I'm thinking too. Have you been inside the Vaults yet?
---
Step 1 - Assess your budget.
---
Step 2 - If your budget is low or zero, reduce your expectations / purchases.
---
Step 3 - Use in-game atoms to only buy things you really really really really really want.  No other purchases.
---
I was waiting for a good Power Armor paint, got the Blackbird when it showed up.  That was 1,000 to 2,000 atoms (don't remember how much).  Since then I've saved up another 5,000 atoms, and I'm not even grinding the atom achievements.  I'm saving those 5,000 atoms for when a good non-power armor cosmetic comes out.  Maybe a cool unique Brotherhood or Enclave skin.
---
You literally get atoms for scratching your butt in the game (I think I got like 40 yesterday not even trying).  Play more or grind the atom rewards in-game.  It's not hard...........unless you want tons and tons of cosmetics..........but that's on you, not them then.
---
May I ask why?
---
I love doing this as well! Reloadin462 on PS4 If anyone ever wants to compare and exchange extra plans!
---
I found a hound chewing on the outside of a third floor wall last night.
---
I suspect Fallout 76 was in part a test of Bethesda's ability to put MP functionality into their engine. So I could see ES6 having a MP component.
---
That said, I don't think it will be a MP game like 76 is. That seems like it would be a bad idea in today's climate. But I could see them adding something in like a way to invite friends to your game world, or maybe even a Star Citizen deal where you start SP and progress into a shared world.
---
I’m trying to figure this out for my mutation guide actually. I’m building for not using class freak generally 
---
I have this happen ever now and again. Not sure what’s up 
---
Yeah go on eBay and look at the cap sellers $2.99 for 1000 caps with like 100-200 sales, these guys hit a jackpot 
---
For sure.  Pack about double the ammo and stims that you think you'd need, and you'll have no trouble.  Lots o' bots, though, so armor piercing is your friend.
---
I've gotten 2 now out of maybe 10 tries. (luck is 13 or so). 
---
From what i have gathered. Some have been released. Others are most likely just being recirculated. I would rather buy them from others to save my own account.
---
Ex-Dupers...Current Douchers
---
American horror story?
---
Delet this 
---
No iron/water anywhere (I've searched far and wide) But you don't need large purifiers. Find a pit you want, and place down like 4-6 small purifiers. All the water you'll need if you check periodically. 
---
See that's my guess, and soon is up to interpretation. What's 'soon' to an individual isn't the same 'soon' to a company. There is no actual date set aside, Bethesda may think 'soon' is July
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Market trading reddits.  Offer to buy X number of screws for 3 caps each. You'll get plenty of offers.  You might even be able to trade for 2 caps each......or sell items / ammo for screws.
---
Just yesterday I sold off all but 100 of my screws and springs for 3 caps each.  As a melee player, I never need many.
---
Sell, buy, sell, buy, it's pretty easy on the market :)
---
So you're explosive PROOF or no? Cause you can up that explosive dmg by a royal fuck ton.
---
Ah. I'll have to fix that. Thanks.
---
Anthem and division 2 can't come soon enough.
---
Get these losers to move on in their worthless lives
---
I'm 500 hrs in and have done 3-5 SBQ fights a day for the last 3 weeks and haven't seen 1 TSE weapon in a drop. My luck is 12 so that's not the issue. I don't farm Whitespring because I have a hard enough time staying connected just getting into the bunker there most times. I would give up a testicle to get a TSE .50 MG, but I'm sure as hell not gonna pay someone for a duped one. For now I have a 2 shot .50 MG with a prime receiver so that works well enough.
---
I've had this happen when I load in to a new server already over encumbered, logging out and back in again seems to fix it.
---
bwhahah well done.....
---
But **you** think soon is next month, so where is the source for **your** claim 'content is coming soon'?
---
The only 'good' legendaries I've come across are from quests: All Rise and Daiseycutter (which I only use to lob nukes randomly when I'm high on weight and find mini nukes in my inventory. 
---
For me, it was a lone Radrat half in a wall. Chomping away at a brick wall. He had already eaten the bed in the room. What caused him to go for the bed and the back wall and literally ignore everything else between the front door and the room bed and wall in the back room on the opposite side of the structure, I don't know.
---
Pens... oh wait. They don’t actually give springs.
---
I'm on PC brother. 
---
i'm level 140 so I don't really need to take handouts. The only thing i'm really on the hunt for now is an instigating deathclaw gauntlet or power fist and an TSE revolver (a legit one I find myself) for some fun since I love pistols but don't want to spec hard into them. 
---
One of these days a low level will accept it. Even if it is someone who just made an extra acct. 
---
Appreciate the offer though!
---
Banned? How will they be able to buy from the Atomic Shop then? Bethesda isn't going to let that happen. Keep dreaming, haha.
---
If your carry weight is like over 1000 or something it happens.
---
I wouldn't call it accurate: green part is too large.
---
didnt watch but i did get a nice mutation where i have +300 health regen, and makes me near immortal now.
---
Im not arguing.   Just saying its not mathematically possible.
---
Pvp is fun when you hunt down a bounty, holster your TSE, and whip out a sniper rifle and head shot them from the shadows!!
---
You’ll need more springs than screws.  Even then at some point you’ll have too much of everything that you’ll end up throwing stuff out that you can’t seek cause all the vendors are out of caps.  Power armor lasts forever - regular armor requiring ballistic fiber is way fragile.
---
Personally if I'm nuking prime, I'm bringing at least one friend with me. I also look at the levels of the others in the session and judge accordingly. I personally as a Frank Horrigan heavy weapons build with a TSE .50 and LMG ALWAYS fight the Queen. I've had times where myself alongside 8 others with builds like mine have taken the Queen out in 5 minutes by keeping her staggering in mid air like the Ghostbusters with their photon packs. Or one time I helped 2 lvl 60s who had no legendary weapons at all... and I was the only one who helped them. I told the keep the melee attackers off me, and I will be fine. To which I can now say yes I've basically solod the Queen and these 2 guys thanked me profusely. Granted I just love showing up in my Ultracite power armor with my .50 cal and saving the day.
---
Because it's an area that's not supposed to be accessible by normal means and people are either changing game files or exploiting to get into these areas. This particular case is  probably rather inoffensive to the servers and the player base but the same methods are used for more nefarious means, like getting into the dev isle you mentioned. A minor crime is a crime nonetheless. I'm against any kinds of cheating in multiplayer games. 
---
This is what happens when people run out of content and gear to chase but still want to play the game. Hopefully we get something new to do sometime in the near future. 
---
Would you like it better if it simply said "more content is coming?" Too bad, not changing it. I bet we hear something before February
---
man i was level 78 before i got my first gragnok to drop. and it was a nocturnal... such disappoint.
---
True...
---
No problem, my only advice to compensate for the lack of accuracy is to rapidly toggle ADS, it'll keep the crosshairs on the screen slightly longer and it seems help me a bit.
---
It says make a copy of the doc but when I press the button nothing happens?
---
It's a base level 45-50, I forget which, give me a minute to cook some mac n cheese and get my lunch sorted and I'll message you over live
---
I hate dupers as much as the next person, but the point of this thread is...?
---
I did it first time. The only danger was from myself in close quarters with explosive weapons. Think I died 3 times, all from my own hand. If you survived Watago exploration without the Mayor for a Day quest you can handle this. You have ample opportunity to disable all the turrets via hacking.
---
I'd be down for both of those.
---
They also need to make it so learned plans show as GRAYED OUT when you look at them in the vendor, a bag, or trade window.  Can't count the number of times I skipped buying a plan because I thought I knew it, only to find out later that I didn't....lol
---
if anyone on xbox needs adhesive I've got 800 and have no qualms with giving it away
---
Xbox One

KSI Kaos Reeper
---
After the patch today (Jan. 15, 2018), if I select an item to sell to a vendor that has multiple copies (5+), when the quantity selection bar arises, if you press RT multiple times to reach 1 it will pause on 1 and then with the next press go back to the maximum of the choices. 
---
It happens everytime and is repeatable. Slider doesn't exceed maximum selection to go to 1. 
---
Also, FYI, the bots INSIDE white springs and the bunker won’t be hostile even though the outside ones are. 
---
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that you are still in the possibility of being banned if you're using unreleased weapons, even if you got them from someone else. Just be careful man.
---
That's right, I don't care that it's "your" game they are wrecking since it isn't your game.
---
Having too many variables aint problem at all, not in F76. You write out all the items that can be equipped, eaten. Fit best combo on character and see how much damage can one character maximum do. Then you take character, fit it with best defensive combo and see how much can it mitigate the maximum damage. Now you know how much you must scale down or boost up the damage. If weapons makes 1000 damage and it makes sense for PVE and not for PVP, then in PVP you just scale that damage down to point where it makes sense. Not a f#cking rocket science, this is basic school math. F76 aint one of those game, where you got 500 different unique abilities that not only have make sense in numbers, but also have to make sense by what they do.
---
Trying that for a day now. Idk lol
---
I know you mentioned this is not "final form" - would you like us to help out by listing things that are confirmed, such as item locations that are set? :) Or do you have these things and are just not able to add them yet? For example, just some things off the top of my head:
---
* Authentic Bearskin Rug - Whitesprings
---
* Cuckoo Clock - Vendor Bot Responder, Event Spawn
---
* Nixie Lamp - Vendor Bot Phoenix, Watoga
---
* Nuka Cola Clock - Vendor Bot Responder, Event Spawn
---
Great resource, well done.  Been using it again today to fill in the gaps. 
---
Not at all. A character name is not a social security number or phone number.
---
In some US states (like Florida) you'll even see arrests publicly searchable with names. That isn't a witch hunt, either.
---
I picked up a mutant slayer combat knife that is surprisingly powerful!
---
You and me both. I want to hop back in and continue my adventures but I just can't with the state the game is in. And every patch just seems to make it worse. 
---
I switch between that and a decent guitar sword, just to change things up sometimes.
---
No worries, in work until 8pm UK time. I'll try get on when I'm home around 9pm
---
No, I am no PC, why would you think I am on xbox?
---
I hear you man.  I haven't bought anything because I'm only lvl 36 so far, but $2 to keep up in nuke zones is pretty tempting.  Hopefully by the time in 50 I'll have something decent.
---
I don't care what you said. I just think it's pretty deceitful to make completely unfounded comments to someone asking if it's worth getting the game.
---
Well while that was tempting I was hoping they might rush back for it before the cool down and find the robots were still hostile lol
---
Lol you think money spent on an in game currency makes cheaters immune?
---
Talk to the pc folks that got banned for using cheat engine.
---
Their currency their rules.
---
I'll have to log on and see if the mule exists, then if it does ill be dropping weight (I think it's over 10k) easy to go over when 50 people dropping you items to share
---
Right but the guns that i have paid for are all guns you can find 
---
So... A griefer's paradise? No thanks
---
Fair enough 
---
Sure, that'll be 500 Atoms. 
---
So the logic is they'll never ban?
---
Oh man i can't wait for it to happen.
---
If you see people in fo76 like the one guy who wa ted me to buy he was a level 15 with a fuck ton of legendary weapons. I did not buy from him cause it was obvious 
---
It's not unfounded, we are getting more content. You're just nitpicking over when soon is
---
I'm hoping that it keeps newbies from flagging themselves trying to pick the locks to my house. Maybe I'll put up some signs.
---
Nope, a group of us had 35 after doing a couple of queens
---
No but if you want to see what it looks like inside there is vids on YT
---
I've noticed camps like to disappear sometimes when I get close and no one's home. I wonder if they notice me on their map and decide to server hop in case I'm a griefer.
---
Mines is the Black Diamond Ski Sword. With incisors, one hand melee perks and the Glowing meat steak, I can get damage up to 120. It's also a +1 strength as well since it's a one star weapon. 
---
I don't have proof, but I do a LOT of trading on FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar.
---
I've had other traders tell me their friends (aka dupers) have been banned.  No reason for them to tell me that just out of thin air for no reason.
---
It really wouldn't be hard for Bethesda to figure out who the dupers are.  Create a tool that scans the player database for players with a character that's 10,000+ pounds overweight.  Look at the account.  If it's full of 100 of every TSE weapon in the game, there's your duper.
---
In the past I think they didn't either have the tool to browse the database, or personnel assigned to do it.  Now it seems like they do.  I hear traders talking about duper bans in-game pretty frequently now.
---
How do you get the hat to level up at the exact same time as you?
---
Yep, Charisma perk cards "Wasteland Whisperer" and "Animal Friend"
---
You fit the profile.
---
Such a good suggestion.
---
You are the one who chose the definition of soon so I don't see how **I'm** the one nitpicking. You are just throwing guesses and prayers at this guy and trying to pass it off as good information on whether to buy or not.
---
Same for me and when they do drop it's like a wooden left leg or a rolling pin.  I've stopped looking and just Hoover and drop for others now.
---
That would be nice. 
---
Have you hit Caps Lock by mistake? (that is the default button on PC) makes you walks slowly instead of the normal quick pace. 
---
It costs 400 concrete to fully repair my base and around 100 steel and 50 wood. Thats pretty costly. I dont think a under 100 player could constantly afford that. 
---
I only had the 3.4gb btw.  Booting it up for the first time in a few weeks. Wish me luck lol
---
That stuff's addictive.
---
I used this site the couple time ran it.  Pics with map highlights.
---
http://dulfy.net/2018/11/21/fallout-76-nuka-cola-outfit-and-power-armor-paint-job-guide/
---
Nice! Man, that would be awesome.
---
The vampire effect heals you for damage you do. Fatman has a large Area Of Effect. You massively heal every time you shoot it into a crowd.
---
You are now Predator.
---
Accept your new role.
---
Hunt the humans, take the trophies :)
---
p.s.  Sorry that happened man, hope you can fix it.  Try validating the game files, if that doesn't work delete and re-install the game.
---
Uhm, I was a raider before people even started duping....
---
I'm raiding camps and workshops of food, water and resources and I occasionally kill others. I won't grief so someone isn't going to be killed multiple times. I just kill to steal junk.
---
Thats interesting. Honestly I've never looked twice at any of the fast attack weapons. Especially after this one time trying out a newly found chainsaw on a yaoi...which didn't go well at all. 
---
If you don't build a camp it can't get destroyed.  I built the base minimum to complete the tutorial quest and haven't been back since. Plenty of rail stations, red rockets, and player camps to get by so far. 
---
Come at the king... you better *not* miss.
---
If you mod a legendary it loses its effects no? It warns you when you’re about to add it.
---
It is good information that the game will have more support and content coming out. That's not a hope or a guess lol
---
I’d believe that if o didn’t know others that don’t have this problem and the fact that it was fine yesterday lol
---
It would not be a smart move on Bethesdas part. Better to fix the exploit (Which they're still trying to do) rather than reduce their player base (toxic or not).
---
If they do give up, expect a server wipe before a ban. Duping or exploiting or not, they still want you to play and spend money in the atom shop.
---
It's pretty effective, though.
---
I was on a walk with my girlfriend the other day and shouted, "Oh, sweet!" upon seeing a discarded tin can on the side of the road. She was extremely confused, and I'm afraid my explanation didn't help much.
---
That's fair! Sorry to rag on you, dude. It is possible to understand you just fine. You've a good point - and none of us are here to win some kind of reward for doing English good. We're here to talk and even if the way you talk is different than the generally accepted way, that's okay cause people still get what you mean. Indeed, you do you. :)
---
Same thing happened to me last night. Had my CAMP completely destroyed on 3 separate occasions on 3 different servers. Checked the usernames and it was different people each time. The craziest part is I specifically picked this place relatively close to vault 96 (93?) because theres nothing out there and I didnt want to be fucked with. 
---
I loved finding this place. I wish we could build these in our camps.
---
Looking at his health bar, you see there are effectively 2 stages.  The bright red, and they darker greyed out red.  Bright red, you did the hit... but the dark red appears to be the damage pending.  I see this alot in PvE aspects, where it takes a sec or two for the damage to register, usually happens when there are a lot of people causing lag... like the scorch beast queen.
---
I'm assuming that's what was going on here... but I could be wrong.
---
I would suggest investing in Power Patcher and Fix It Good. I very rarely have to repair my PA and end up selling my screws once i get over 200 of them.
---
I have done some limited testing on this myself and I will say i learned plans on 1-4 deconstructs with items that had the mod attached. No I only tested this for 4 different mods so it could still have been really good luck since I was searching for the last few I didn't already have for Combat and Robot.
---
The only reason I found it odd was that his health did bottom out, he just didn't die. Even with serendipity max he tanked five shots at 1.6k each. 
---
It works, but annoyingly it's 'always on' once you connect it to power.  The switch on it doesn't work for some reason, so you need to put an Advanced Power switch between it and your generator so you can turn it on or off.
---
I have a TSE auto shotty. I don't need to aim.
---
Thanks for not trying to justify the fact you're so shit you have to dupe though
---
Tamed a deathclaw?
---
Ur mum
---
Swampgas is from breathing swampgas with no mask
---
I read this whole thing in my head with a southern accent.
---
i'm not sure you can fast travel in a blast zone. i remember trying once and it wouldn't let me.
---
It's an in-game exploit. They aren't using any third party software, hacks or anything else that isn't available inside the very game itself. To put it in other words: Bethesda made duping possible within the game, and they can't punish players for exploiting it. It's up to them to fix it. No one is going to get banned.
---
I mean if the guy is stacking bobbleheads nothing will help.
---
That is the only thing I can think of that might explain it. I still don't understand why his health bottomed out and he didn't go down. 
---
go to r/fo76bazaar
---
There is a dog, I didn’t have the perk so I couldn’t tame him but I’m sure you can. He’s on a cliff overlooking Harper’s ferry - towards tanagra town still sitting faithfully by his owners’ corpses. 
---
God I hope so... I did a SBQ run last night and after we dropped 25% health off, a dozen other people showed up and everyone in my group started to lag out something fierce... we were pulling 1 frame every 2 secs level of poor performance.  Then some knucklehead started tossing in orbital strike beacons to make things worse.  I just force quit the game and went to bed.
---
I almost jumped a fence to grab a wind chime on a low branch while walking to work, need that aluminium.
---
I’m not saying that it has to have a decision tree, but I’m saying that having npcs would have made it much more interesting and engaging.
---
Or you could, you know, not be bitch-ass little coward cheater fucks. Give your balls a tug.
---
Ohhh okay gotchu. Glad you were smart about it
---
if you're manually Aiming Down Sights with hardened rifles, you won't be disappointed. 
---
if you've spent a chunk of points in Agility/Luck for Sneak/Crit/VATS perks, you will be. Two-Shot has an accuracy de-buff in VATS and will miss 90% of medium to long range shots on anything other than torso/body shots of large enemies.
---
It is not good information that more content is coming soon, by your own definition. Unless you can provide a source you **hope** more content is coming soon.
---
Ah, you must be new to RPG verbiage.. no worries! **Area Of Effect** healing, meaning that since it has such a large explosion radius, every single thing around the impact point will give you health regeneration. 
---
Grafton is mine.  You're all in big trouble if I see you there.
---
Yeah, I had a douche bag named Killertactic420 start attacking my character as I was selling some items at the Whitespring station.  I play pacifist mode, I was like level 30 and he was something over 50 in power armor.   I ignored him and just fast traveled to my camp.  The dick-head followed me.   He starts attacking me in my camp so I boxed him in with walls and he destroyed them (Got a small bounty) and kept attacking me.  Not wanting to log off to give him the satisfaction, I just kept running around.  Eventually his damage did start wearing down my health so I had to flee.  Eventually someone did show up to collect his bounty... "Red" "Beard" something... I forget your actual name, but thank you.
---
Ok so what is your carry weight?
---
But we pay for imaginary stuff in game at inflated rates? 
---
Remember when a dlc cost less than some hats or skins? 
---
Werthers remembers...
---
I’m on Xbox but that used to get me on new Vegas on pc all the time lmao
---
Bravisima!
---
You are absolutely correct. The only thing rewarding in the game is farming legendaries, and it is so damn boring and mindless. This made me stop playing the game all together. No point in doing quest when you are guaranteed to get nothing of value
---
Interesting take on it. Thanks for sharing man
---
Yep, nothing new.  One shotting 1* non glowy ghouls tends to cause them to not drop a legendary about 50% of the time.
---
Mine locks up after 1 hour, or disconnected from server, or Blue screen of death. Using PS4. 
---
Well whenever I get the sack enough to attempt "I Am Become Death" I know who to call upon hah
---
I'll look for you tonight and try and drop some supplies for you and other players!
---
You may be misunderstanding.
---
I'm used to getting tons of shit legendaries.
---
I'm used to the occasional lack of legendary loot from a 1* mob.
---
This is numerous legendary mobs not dropping legendaries at all.
---
Nice, thanks. Though with this post, I feel like I'll never see those other sets for a while...
---
Ah, if only we had platform flair here too. 
---
It's all good, figured I'd throw it out there anyhow lol. I'm lvl 110 and run around in the clown outfit, with the Faschnacht Man Mask and wielding a grognak axe.... Probably why they run away lol to be honest
---
Add me.  Our team is always looking for fun people to play with.   utchia23
---
I bow before you.
---
That quote you send as an answer made my day! ❤️😂
---
 The bot on the floor in Watoga Station had a crap ton of legendary stuff in it. I took a couple of things then sold some to the Station bot, then gave up. There were a lot of 10 lots of Instigating Gauss etc.
---
 I got a nice level 20 Combat Shotgun with exploding rounds. Nothing too special. It was the only single low level thing in the bot. ;)
---
This dumb shit has been reposted to death. It wasn’t funny the first 600 times
---
Sounds like you're going to have to craft some sort of contraption to free yourself.  *MacGyver theme music*
---
Me waiting patiently for a brotherhood expedition team to come and declare war on us. Cuz lets face it we are bonafied enclave members and we launched nukes which elder maxon specifically forbaded. 
---
Yes i know the brotherhood expedition that reached the capital wasteland wont leave for another 50ish years from their current location but one can hope that we'll eventually get some scouts. 
---
I mean if you got a message from one of your trusted paladins that there's an extinction level threat that warrants a nuke strike and you told em no and to hold the tide, wouldn't your first move be to you know help? Elder Maxon sitting there going like "meh they got this" 
---
I've run 2 silos now, 2nd time was definitely easier cuz I was at least 15 lvls higher lmao. Also killed the scorchbeast queen in under 10 mins but thT was also largely due to the pros on my server helping
---
They're hoarding caps because idiots are BUYING caps on e-bay and the like. 
---
If I see random invites from people in the server, I deny them.  Don't need griefers leveling my base anytime soon.
---
If you are willing to help people get Ghram, here's the general etiquette:
---
1. Message on this reddit that you have Ghram and what platform you're on (PC, Xbox, PS4).  INCLUDE your in-game name so they can friend you.  Also give the LOCATION of where you are, so people who can't fast travel can figure out where to go.
---
2. Accept those friend requests.
---
3. Hold Ghram until a bunch of people show up.  Occasionally you can hop out of that server and back in if you want to get a few hops on him, but generally just stay logged in (because everyone will be using YOU to hop back).
---
4. Once you're done with hopping him for plans, go ahead and stay in that server.  People will continue to hop and hold Ghram even if you're not next to him.  When they get tired of it or he teleports away to another one of his spawn points they'll stop hopping.
---
Hope that helps!
---
I watched a video where the guy found the GECK device but I still would like to explore it myself. I was able to glitch behind the wall in the entrance but never got behind the vault door
---
I read on here something about the game not registering combat if you one shot.  Could be that  is true.
---
Love this! Wish I could have a nice civilized dual with some fellow wasteland warriors but it always turn into brutality. Even worse the scoundrels enlist the services of fellow ruffians  to bolster their ranks. Dishonorable conduct indeed. 
---
I don't think they actually have plastic, but they should.
---
Up until yesterday, I was rocking a ghoul fireaxe with swing speed, so nice improvement (though noticeably slower)
---
I've got a 87 and 54, never had two shot or explosive drop.  Rng does bit like me...
---
I think you forgot this
---

I heard good things, but haven't tried it out yet myself
---
Haha right?!?!
---
Facepalm.
---
Do you live in Fort Defiance or something?
---
I like how the just added the Space Suit even though they used it for the screenshots for the "Wave" pose for pictures which, as far as i know, is one of the first poses added to the Atomic Shop since the BETA
---
Not when it rolls back the server and disconnects everyone in that world 
---
I got this on my favorites tab on my iPhone already but ty for posting again for people who didn’t see it the first time.
---
This thing is epic and well done 
---
Post this to /outrun 
---
Yeah, I'd love Saved Perk Loadouts and Passive Perk slots.  Too many times I'm running around with crafting things on my character because I forgot to switch out.  I think all non-combat related perks should just be passive equipped.
---
Let me know. I die with my weapon as well. Remindme! 10 hours
---
That's nice, where did you get the diner door plan?  I have been looking a while to finish up having all door options but haven't run across that yet.
---
Sorry, none of that is happening.
---
Eh. Ill join em in duping. Then kill them and take their dupped junk to bulk and give away. 
---
And lose a million potential Atomic Shop customers? Get real. It's not going to happen.
---
All you need is the enclave quest
---
I thought it was because there aren't unique item id's or something like that preventing bans. Bethesda doesn't even know who they are. 
---

Ah yeah that’s def it. I wonder how often it procs, could be extremely useful w miniguns.

Bethesda have recently added legendary hunting rifles which should have existed from the beginning but there is still a lack of legendary scout armour. I personally use this armour exclusively as I prefer it's appearence however doing so means I am willingly handicapping myself as besides last bastion no legendary armour of this variant can be found anywhere. Please add this either as a drop from enemies or at the very least a purchase from MODUS.
---
You're right.
---
Haha my friend wears the same thing only he uses the all rise. 
---
I would run too if I was legitimately new to the game. 
---
It might be the location of your camp. I set up on a nice flat spot on the east side of the lake, and barely ever got attacked. Most damage I had was a destroyed turret and some corn.
---
Concrete defensive walled base in the bottom left corner of the map. 
---
I get 99% junk. I don't like farming nuke zones much. I probably get my greatest leggies from the uranium fever event.
---
You could always break the quest chain to get here to nuke launching faster (ie getting the bunker key then going to the bunker rather than going from point to point until you get sent to get area that has the key.)
---
Do you need a microscope to see that teeny tiny dick you pack?
---
Xbox x or normal?
---
It’s like 200 years until they reach DC, I think.
---
Challenge accepted!
---
Within that time I've killed some ghouls and got a few legendaries an now I blue screen error coded lol 
---
Take a photo of your wife sleeping for 10 Atoms
---
Ok so then still a long time away. Thanks!
---
that way of dupping had been patched a bit ago already
---
I was exploring and found a really pretty lake way down south near the edge of the map. It had an island in the middle and the area was really nice looking. As I recall it had a dead merchant and pack brahmin on it. I debated putting down camp til I had that dreadful flapping followed shortly by the oh so annoying shriek of glowing donut spam. Nope!
---
I did find a place nearby between some cliffs on a river and thought it'd be the perfect hideaway. Cept now and then someone else's camp is too nearby my spot so I have to jump servers.
---
Southern, I read it in old english
---
Dupers could be telling people dupers are getting banned to scare others from doing it so they can maintain a foothold on the market. 
---
No she would need to do the enclave missions to get access to the elevators that lead to the silos.
---
I don't think so, as you still get xp and that will come in delayed sometimes.  Loot can be real funky... specially where there's any server lag.  For example, you can watch loot change on a corpse.  I've watched a shishkebab become a TS pipe rifle.  there's like an initial loot, but then it rolls your loot for you and replaces the initial inventory.  This can be seen when super mutants drop a stack of frag grenades, but then suddenly you see the corpse has random stuff and only 1 frag, or 1 molotov.
---
Sometimes, the loot just takes for ever to load, and you'll see the loading icon rotating in the inventory... I believe this happens when you aren't the first to tag, but I'm not really sure.
---
Have you not purchased the fish in a lamp yet? That thing really tied the room together man.
---
the best advice is to find a guild for something you’re interested in (dungeons, housing, roleplay, anything), the community in ESO is amazingly kind and eager to help new players 
---
😅
---
I have 18 overseers logs?? 
---
This is the lamest thing I read all week, you are truly pathetic. 
---
10 minutes in and about to down scorch queen and i eat a bluescreen. Good to see nothing has changed
---
Happens when I am over 800 for me I think you need to be under 750 I could be wrong
---
What you're suggesting is damage caps. The problem with damage caps is that multiple weapons all exceed what would be a reasonable cap, prior to perks, bobbleheads, chems etc. The inclusion means more weapons do as well. Therefore instead of variety, your best choice would be the fastest firing weapon, since everything would kill in the same amount of hits.
---
If you set it so different types of weapons have different caps, then that's pretty much the same thing as just eliminating the influence of all the extra crap anyway, with much more work Involved. 
---
I agree! Good ones, not the silly ones we've got on there now. Contact some of those fo4 modders and give em a cut for their fantastic hairstyles and apparel. 
---
Like the nanosuit, I love that one. 
---
&gt; do NOT pvp
---
FTFY.
---
I've found springs and plastic to be my main bottleneck, though I got into a habit in FO4 of picking up anything screw or adhesive related.
---
Why do you cheat though? Too lazy to find things?
---
You dont have to be an ex duper to be a raider. When a game like this lacks any kind of end game content (nukes are a joke and get boring very quickly) then the players have to make their own fun. This often involves other players because other players can be unpredictable, a nice change of pace in a game where everything is so damn repetitive. I personally enjoy killing other players because it often provides a challenge that the game itself cannot provide
---
From what is posted on the marketplace, damn near every TSE weapon is duped at this point. The only part about duping that sucks iarethe server issues. Honestly, RNG is bullshit for gear, Im not mad at ya!
---
For anyone to come here: the sloth made to Whitespring. The guards did not attack it. However it did aggro towards my friends, teammates and after arriving at the camp also towards the local bots. Of course, they weren't having it and that was the end of my sloth. :'(
---
Again it just randomly did this last night. Nothing has changed lol. Used to be when the AP bar depleted I’d walk slow now it’s always slow and the AP bar still goes down (not affecting speed when it’s depleted) so idfk 
---
Yep been having that as CTD on PC since last patch... for me its been water/food so far but it seems consumable related.
---
Just blue screened again
---
I've always liked the name. Blue Suns. It has a special *something*.
---
You say content is coming soon. You say soon is a month or so. When pressed for a source you provide 'content is coming in 2019'. So content isn't coming *soon*, it is coming this year. Oh well, time to move the goalposts is it?
---
&gt;It might be more like two or three but they said more information would come down in February.
---
Ah so it's not more content anymore, but more information about content.
---
Putting the toxic in Toxic Valley.  But at the end of the day you sound like the sort of folks that will turn on each other as soon as you get bored again.  Really all it takes is for one of your new friends to realize they can make off with the entire stockpile during a dupe session.  But I'm sure you totally trust them after a few hours of ganking noobs together, they would never betray you.
---
A character name, that identifies them. Then if they don't have their privacy settings set a certain way, their full name.
---
I get stuck on workbenches (XB1) CONSTANTLY.  it does the exit animation then kicks me back in.   I was in forward station near fissure prime the other day doing some mole rat meat cooking and it did this to me 4 times in a row. while I was out of my power armor obvi, and some wandering scorched conquerer was tapping me on the shoulder with a goddamn claymore. (which the game dropped as a lead pipe, again. obviously).  My wife and friends laugh because it never happens to them, but constantly happens to me.
---
I think it's some kind of percentage based thing based on your carry capacity. So it'll be slightly different depending on Strength and armor carry weight effects.
---
I just wanted a cool keypad door to enter. I tried to put numbers down 4991 to get in, but I ran out of budget thanks to my Deathclaw. So once I find a way to get more budget Ill open it up. I do lock my garden tho. Use the benches, beds, and instruments freely. Just don't want to compete for water and food in my own base.
---
I do it all the time with a melee build.  Just hack all the terminals to shut off all the turrets.  Before you go into each room there's a terminal to hack.  The section where you have to destroy the consoles has I think 2 terminals you need to hack.  The last room has a level 1 terminal to hack, but it's behind a level 3 locked door.  Gotta use lockpicking for that one.
---
For the destroy the console part, you can blow the things up, you don't have to go up to each one and press A.  My auto grenade launcher gets that whole section done in a minute or two.
---
No, your inability to win fairly did. Must be pretty boring sucking at a game so much you have to cheat
---
Just don't PVP.  
---
What console are you on? Psn? I’d like to check
---
Out ya inventory 
---
I had been hunting him for several days until one of my friends had done a looking for group on Xbox saying he was holding him, I got my mirror ball plan. I then had him sell me 2 bullets for 5000 caps a piece! I now have all camp plans though.  
---
No kidding? I thought if you plucked an item from an open space, it was locked out for you at an account level, regardless of how many servers you hopped, for a set amount of time. I'm glad to know this!
---
Its so easy to get caps its almost pointless to bother buying them. Same with atoms really.
---
Stay out of #campmcclintock
---
Well that's just like your opinion, man. 
---
So you cheated to bypass a system so that you could exploit other players for in game profit? This is the type of behavior that deserves a permanent ban without question
---
To be fair its also a great way to farm mats. The other day I killed 3 or 4 people, all wanted or owners of workshops, and literally got so many mats I had to dump some. Like 500 steel, 500 wood, 50 ballsitic fiber, bulk adhesive...
---
I like the machete with the sacrificial blade mod.
---
Yeah I am saving as well, mainly because I have not seen anything worth buying.
---
Waiting for them to release skins for actually used weapons. 
---
Dumbfounded they only released weapon skins for the least used ones.
---
I don't know what deadpanned means, I should probaby google it, but I'm slightly lazy.... 
---
Thank you! It is my work computer first, I just am able utilize it in other ways fortunately.DDR Ram is/has been ridiculously high lately otherwise I would have more.
---
Your computer is pretty good as well, if my computer wasn't for work I would have the exact same build, maybe with ryzen 7 instead, but you catch my drift.
---
getting good 'uninstalls game'
---
you should report that. I run around in my X-01 armor for PvE all day and no issues.  PvP a little in it against TSE shotty and it still has not broken.  That is someone using several bobbleheads, aka duping.
---
Yeah like I said in the post, i dont really consider this a hard run by any means, just a way to make things a bit more interesting 
---
Don't think I've been inconvenienced by a deathclaw in 76, now crickets?  Those evil things have offed me a few times...
---
Now I just need to find this in game. Ty for the reply.
---
Not mine! I actually earned my TSE handmade and shotgun basically nolifing over the holiday period
---
I had the same expectation because raiders were always a common enemy in all of the Fallout titles.  The anti pvp sentiment on this sub makes it feel like most players can only handle easy to kill npc raiders and are afraid of the ones controlled by players.
---
This is why i bought the fire paint as soon as i saw it didn't want to miss out on it like i did blackbird. 
---
meaning they most likely duped bobbleheads
---
I also leave my second story doors open so anyone with marsupial can hop on in. 
---
Ty.  Now I need to find this in game
---
Not sure if it still works... but you can plant crops on top of campfires... so you can plant stuff on your roof if you're good with your placement.
---
Will do and update you later today...
---
You spawn in die immediately decide you didnt die an dawn your hazmat suit an say "wow look what i just found an totally by accident wow a nuke zone" 
---
This is not a title I wanted. 😔
---
It works, but beware it also removes mutations very quickly
---
Did it at LV 58 with mainly a melee build, it took me about an hour pretty easy (I have lockpick and hacking LV 3) used about 4-6 stimpacks. Fun quest one of the more interesting ones defiantly worth doing. Look up the launch codes online. 
---
Relationship goals
---
I'm saving my points too. 
---
I have bought a couple things but I am hard saving now. I'm around 2.7k I think. 
---
Hoping for some cooler weapon skins/outfits and actually good hairstyles.  
---
No it really didnt.  It worked for years, blizzard made a ton of money, and it kept the trading largely in the game.  The actual reason it ended up getting removed actually had to do with how they implemented drops in the game.  
---
Get the Dodgy perk.  I can shoot point blank and take little damage.  
---
They could be, but I'm not a duper.  When they trade with me, they can clearly see that my inventory isn't full of duped stuff.  No reason to tell me to scare me, I'm not competing with them.  And if I had friends that duped, I wouldn't need them.
---
I've also seen people post their ban messages up, but it doesn't specifically say "duping".
---
Like I said it's not hard for Bethesda to build a simple database query tool to find the dupers.  Once found, easy enough to ban them.  No reason for them not to do it.  They have all the AAA talent they need to create such a simple tool.  After the tool is created, you can literally take a minimum wage employee, stick them behind a PC, and say "find and ban dupers" for 8 hours a day.  $500 a week and they're doing nothing but banning dupers by the thousands.
---
Ghouls are alive. They are underground somewhere. This is explicitly implied in game via a quest. 
---
The overseer is also alive but hiding. She even saw you dropping your first nuke. 
---
Yeah the host does kinda suck, also I'm bad at web dev :D
---
Not in the article I linked, but in the next most recent. You see they announce a patch, and then they patch it around the same time. Did you think the new content would magically appear? The info would have always come first haha
---
Only as far as earning the rank of General. Technecally you complete the main quest when you launch your first nuke
---
Vault 76 openned on 2097 roughly. After killing the master the brotherhood sent an expedition east. The events of that game took place roughly around 2162 so it would be maybe a few yeats after that. 
---
Thats roughly 65 years, I kinda just spitballed the numbers cuz i remembered the master dying in 2150ish and vault 76 opening around 2100ish
---
TL;DR: "I'm an asshole and can't play a game right, so I want to make everyone else suffer".
---
I hope Bethesda makes you write on a chalkboard for them. 
---
I'm sure they can find out if they wanted to, but the truth is Bethesda can't afford to lose more players. They need everyone they can get to play this game.
---
Not with the goo. I am not sure what is causing me to die instantly. Just walking around in my base, die instantly sitting at 18% health. It has happened repeated today since the patch. 
---
Fix It Good and White Knight. The former allowed you to repair armor and PA beyond 100% and the latter means it breaks slower and is cheaper to repair. Though I don't use the latter unless I'm repairing, it's insanely useful.
---
FO4 legendary stuff was primarily world drop
---
Yeah I've had this on pc since the patch. Seems to be related to taking rads as I've died after eating/drinking, being in water, being near a toxic waste barrel or an irradiated corpse. 
---
So undignified! It seems many of our brethren have forsaken the path of honor and chosen to live in an inferior state of moral squalor...such a tragedy!
---
I launched 3 nukes on the same server yesterday.  No lag til the 3rd nuke.  No DCs.  I dunno where you get your info unless you play on PC.
---
Thanks guys, I'll roll with the t-60 then. 
---
I'm on Xbox but my GT is Lammolol for anyone interested.  
---
Mine does that too. I was hoping some "upstanding citizen" would come along and free me from the life of an eternal tinkerer with a shotty blast to the head, but alas, I had to restart the game.
---
The green glow means the regenerated their health and healed their limbs.
---
Yeah real raiders don't need to exploit to kill people.
---
That only works out of combat.  
---
You can still play on fan-run PC servers.  It was cool for a while, and I'd never experienced Episode IV before, but I eventually got tired of it again.  Generally nice people playing, though, at least on the one I used.
---
sure, how long did it take to dupe 100 explosive bobbleheads?
---
Xbox message. That's an upside to console I guess.
---
I too like the combat knife, even non-legendary.
---
Yeah pretty much, I was thinking taking down the queen after the main story would finish the character if he makes it that far
---
Instructions unclear. Head stuck in Mr. Handy.
---
🖖
---
Personally I'm never running out of things to sell so I either keep some stuff on hand or stash it in suitcases in train stations. There are some junk items vendors will buy unbulked, and so long as I have a stash of those I always sell, usually for one cap per junk. Asbestos, silver, fiberglass, antiseptic are in that category for me
---
It's a SBQ random drop, I had to buy it as I haven't been lucky enough to get one from drops.  It's worth it though, saves a bunch of RadAways.
---
Didn't have enough for blackbird at the time. Have bought, cowboy hat, ceiling fan, nuka stash, couple other things, can't remember. But now saving until there's another chance at cool power armor paint.  was not impressed with the hot-wheels edition.
---
Why stash plans? You can just learn them, and if you can't, then it means you already know them, in which case, why keep them? I guess you could keep dupe serum plans if you get them to trade for others, but otherwise...
---
The only decent weapons I have were bought from the Watoga vendors, I'm nearing 500 hrs of play and I have not been farming Whitespring but have been doing the SBQ fight regularly, my luck is 12 and all I get from that fight is crap and copies. I also got to say the percentage chance of X-01 jet pack and calibrated shocks showing up at the bunker has to be less then 1%, I've been server hopping, thanks to game instability, about 10-12 times a day for the last month and have found 1 of each. I just want that last shock, right now I lose 10 carry weight when I put the armour on.
---
Y'all are welcome to invite my husband and I if you are going to do a prime drop. We have too many issues with level 100+ melee builds standing around waiting for the SBQ to land. My GT is the same as my username.
---
lol that's a thing?  :)
---
Creeper mode photo, achievement unlocked lol
---
Yeah you earn atoms for doing all kinds of stuff.  I get them all the time for doing the most random things.  Scrap 76 pieces of armor, here's some atoms.  Visit this location, have some more atoms.  Do an emote, here's some atoms....lol
---
Maybe not. Makes it a lot more fun, though.
---
OMG I love the lever rifle as well!! I have been trying to buy the plans for it for a while now (something else always comes up)
---
Think op's point was special drops. The vast majority of legendary critter drops, assuming it dropped an item, are basically trash.
---
I was curious, I guess the dc group was sent in 2254. So about 150 years after f76.
---
But maybe they’ll add more officers Macon contacted who come to Appalachia to meet the group they believe is there.
---
Important to note that each purifier tier shares its cooldown with all other place purifiers from that tier.  If you put down 5 small purifiers, you will only get 1 water per tic until all 5 are full.  You won't get 1 water per purifier per tic.  Having more than 1 small purifier just allows you to store more water.  Most efficient water gain is by having 1 or 2 of each tier of purifier.  That way you get more than 1 water per tic.
---
When you buy these serums from the enclave do you get the recipe or is it one time use? 
---
My crops are surrounded by concrete foundation with defense fencing. I haven't had any problems with my crops since. 
---
Yeah. Was thinking of just throwing it all in a spreadsheet.
---
Ok, where is the announcement of new content coming 'soon'. And no, 'this year' does not count under any reasonable definition of 'soon'.
---
&gt;Beyond Monday’s patch, we’re working on another patch that we hope will hit near the end of the month. This patch will continue to add fixes for issues being voiced by the community, including the number of plans Vendors have available, fixing a few Legendary mods, and continuing to address issues with some Perks.
---
Bugfix =/= content.
---
He deleted the post....strange. maybe he was the duper this whole time lol
---
God speed. 
---
Class!!!!
---
It's not fun when you have to cheat to bypass a system and be a self proclaimed "raider" because you're not good enough to be the real thing
---
I do play on PC. 
---
The helmet does, the suit however is strictly cosmetic 
---
I am?
---
Well, I'm sorry that you don't like the name! How would you name your own group? I'm curious!
---
Nasty
---
this has been happening on PC since the patch as well, be nice if it went the other way but sucks when you want to sell a couple of a stack of 50 or more. We on PC have pointed this out to them but why should they care about a little glitch like that, they have a hard time just keeping the servers running.
---
I see what you were trying to do there
---
Oh, I *am* the real thing.
---
Would be nice, especially if it said how long since the server was created.
---
Oh I'm not the one that destroys peoples camps. No I dont do that, what I do is kill people when they try and take my friends bounty
---
What do you mean?
---
oh my your naked!
---
Au contraire! It is *so much* fun!
---
Fire Paint? Do tell.
---
Im a 90% melee build with some perks added for shotgun usage. Still takes me a few swings to kill enemies that are in the 90 range. But everything dies in one hit. 
---
Ya same here I just finally got off this morning, not worth the hassle.
---
If they recruit help, it just means that you now have a target-rich environment. If they get you surrounded, congratulations! You can now engage them in in all directions. 
---
I have this armor, this is what it looks like to the opponent but to you your health never goes down, it's factoring ap loss somehow and confuses the server.
---
We'll see how well you hold up when you dont have any more bobbleheads or exploits to use
---
Man, and I thought my arrow messing up on the map and pointing the opposite direction was bad... o.o
---
Wrong model though. The 76 one is Pip Boy 2000.
---
Oh hell yes!  I have been doing this by hand on frigging index cards.  BTW, takes 17-18 days or so to max out a characters caps if you hit all 7 normal vendors for 1400 caps a day folks!  Thanks for sharing this brother!
---
I was sure the Blackbird skin would be a lure to get you to spend your atoms, and then the next day something even better would appear enticing people spend all of their atoms and then to buy more. I debated with myself if I should buy it or wait for the next thing. I bought it and no next thing that interested me appeared. I can save or get atoms to buy whatever I want. I've never felt like I need to buy them. Most of these stores will keep releasing new things to get people to spend the free atoms and then buy more.
---
Hey, if my boys want to punch each other to fight boredom, I'm not the one who is going to stop them! 
---
Well, that's why each of us have a mule containing our own personal duped items. Duh.
---
I am an adult.  I don't have a tree fort with a "No Girls" sign on it, cheat at video games, and threaten people who just want a relaxing time in a world they love.  As an adult, i have had to make many sacrifices, such as no longer making a big deal over my birthday, wearing black socks,  pretending to be normal to keep a job, and of course, not naming my group of friends like I'm in an 1960's counter culture greaser gang.
---
If I die to what's clearly a bug and completely out of my control I will make the judgement if the run should continue, at the end of the day the challenge/run is for fun and I'm not going to let a game breaking bug ruin that. That being said I'll be extremely mad and it will annoy the hell out of me, which will make me start over or just quit the run if I'm to far in. 
---
You know how 2 independent facts can exist in your mind and not mix?  That's what happened here.  You mention a mod to quickly change perks, and then mention you quickly change perks, and I just wooshed.
---
Honestly I dont know how to feel about this.  I know perks are cumbersome, but that feels like the that is intentional.  Sometimes fun means doing things that are not fun, if that makes sense.
---
This also gives users an unfair advantage against those who dont know how or are not willing to mod.  I know mods seem like a harmless thing, but if you can max range perks then hot swap to melee perks if I manage to close makes pvp unbalanced.  (Which, has plenty of other problems already besides perk swaps but hopefully those will get resolved.)
---
Nice idea thanks
---
Or they could introduce/buff more effects to match Explosive Damage. They had Energy infused and Radiation infused rounds as Legendary effects... They can add poison and buff fire damage. They can more creative effects too.
---
\- An effect that raises fire rate or damage as long as the trigger is held constantly.
---
\- Slower fire weapon with massive increase in damage
---
\- Pulse or electric rounds with increase damage on robots
---
\- Armor breaking effects to go alongside suppressing effect
---
\- Homing rounds with less damage to target fast moving targets like ghouls and SBs
---
\- Damage increases if you shoot without missing a shot
---
\- Bullets that do less damage but have an AoE debuff like acid or fire
---
There's plenty of ideas they haven't explored that could nullify or balance out the TSE weapons. They can also introduce enemies and armors that counter that weapon, re-introducing more choice.
---
I recommend following @Fallout on twitter and set the notifications on,. This doesn't always work but does help, the hotfix to PC on the 14th was announced on twitter a half hour after they shut the servers down but normally it's a fair bit ahead of the shutdown
---
You’re only the second person to say this! I’m surprised I thought there would be more haha
---
Damn, I'm so sorry to hear that you are a sad bitter old man!
---
Sorry, I was making a joke, with the Ivory grip being the most common plan in the game by some distance...
---
bloody combat knife with the low health build is severely underrated.  Id kill for one with ap and like 1 str.  Just running regular bloody kills stuff so fast and you can fly through the air with vats so fast people can't keep up with you.
---
Seems fishy that’s all I’m saying. More than likely he was helping duped and ripped people off or something. Who knows. 
---
Yea, that sad sack was glitchier than the Pipboy 98.
---
Should be able to crank out the Enclave stuff with her in a few hours.  The 10 commendations portion should be most of it time-wise, and she can start at any time as far as I recall.
---
You can skip over the Brotherhood of Steel quest line entirely and start her on Bunker Buster by going to the Abandoned Waste Dump in the Mire.  If she interacts with the panel inside the elevator in the dump she'll jump right to the start of the Bunker Buster quest and will be on her way to becoming an Enclave General.
---
As /u/jchamlin said, I also wrote a script to pull out the data from xEdit then I consolidate it/tidy it up in a separate script outside of xEdit. I released a script that exports xEdit data to json, it may have bugs https://github.com/Wully616/xEdit-json-export
---
I don't know what SBQ is.
---
I never thought to use index cards, only cuss as I stumble around trying to find a vendor that had caps before I started this lol
---
Reeee, play Fallout 76 the way I want to or don't play it at all.
---
I wished for a TSE shotgun since day 1, but now that I finally found one I almost wish I hadn’t. It makes everything so trivial. With shotgun, demo, and bloody mess perks the damage is over 1400. Add adrenaline, etc. and it’s well over 2k AoE damage. Having a weapon that powerful completely defeats the purpose of playing with friends, too, since I can annihilate almost anything solo, usually in 1 shot. 
---
I only ever use it now when hunting murderers or against the scorchbeast queen because it’s just not fun otherwise. 
---
Having a bit more than a million bobbleheads helps. Also, we have another way of duping items. It will take some time for Bethesda to patch that out.
---
I got starched genes/jeans.  Can't remember what spelling they used :)
---
Are disconnects still happening every now and then? I cant play til 4 hours so I cant find out yet.
---
Thanks! It's been working great for me for the past couple weeks so I decided to pretty it up and share
---
Hairpins. I see them on the ground and think "score!" Then have to remind myself this is real life
---
Exactly!
---
Use a Tesla Rifle to hit the mobs.  You get a good sold "hit" on mutliple enemies when it chains.  After you think you've gotten a "hit" on everything, feel free to one shot away.  The server has time to register all the tesla "hits" then grants the legendary item when it dies.
---
Hope that helps :)
---
I don't know if it was intentional, but it's welcome. There's no magazine/related mod that affects it, right?  I also had no idea the range on that thing until I scoped it, so I got to ditch my sniper rifle just after the patch. It also beats the heck out of my shotgun at close range, so that went two weeks ago even with the bug. It's far better, even with the increased incidence of repair. I have my backup revolver and Black Diamond for when the rifle and All Rise give out... 
---
Love this spot. And yes. Just like the old fo4 gas cylinders. 
---
I laughed so hard my wife came to check on me lol
---
This is way more fun.

I had started another thread on this with a different spin. That being - balanced gameplay would make pvp fun and roleplaying as a raider would be something I'd do. I'm no greifer, nor duper, nor particularly douche-y. Other players brought up seperate servers for ppl that do not enjoy pvp would likely be the way to do it.
---
I'm assuming the ex-duper connotation cuz the raiders have TSEs. That's an unfortunate reality atm (I think 2 shot should never have been included in a game with other humans, you know non-bullet-sponges. Think about lit - iterally EVERY weapon on a PVP server is gunna be a 2-shot, so it's literally pointless... way to go Beth)
---
What armor is it? 
---
Thanks for your input!
---
I know you can bulk springs and gears, but can't sell them single. But I don't think you can bulk screws, as you can sell them single. 
---
weird, i deploy my camp in random locations but it won't ever get attacked. Supermutants, dogs, molemners, they all just ignore it
---
get the recipe and you'll never have to worry about fusion cores again, even without crafting I dump any core under 90% and still carry ~10 and have 30+ in my stash. I don't spend all my time in power armour as it seems a lot of players are doing.
---
wait what minite mark are they finally banning the dupers
---
Damn son, which little friend of yours is teaching you this comebacks in the schoolyard?
---
Your right, i got the group sent to kill the remnants of the masters army mixed up with the actual expeditionary force that was sent to check on them haha. 
---
Can you make a flying saucer house that can only be fast traveled to?  
---
Can you essentially make full towers of concrete or do they always end up not attached to the ground?  I think foundations aren’t destructible, so you could make a full concrete wall around your whole camp. 
---
Welcome to the future. Hooray updates.
---
This mod (PC user) is fantastic, makes fighting SpamBeasts bearable, though still unrewarding and a bit boring past the first few when it was new.
---
The reward is just daft.
---
Oh, "Removed". Imagine that. Such a big tough boy you are. 🙄
---
That's the thing, we just don't know and the things you describe have happened to me.  I'd love someone at Bethesda to come out and just explain these sorts of things. 
---
They knew it wouldn’t crash the servers.
---
Well of course you wait for him to come back, you only loot it right before he charges into the room, leaving him with no loot and having to fight a horde of pissed off robots. 
---
Right have been playing since beta and have had no problems 
---
And when they decide to remove them from stacking what will you do? There is a way to counter every cuck move you try and make
---
Only need 2 ranks of fireproof and you're good for most non-shotguns. Sentinels/Cavalier armor doesn't hurt either
---
First read the title as Juice was Served.  Thought someone opened a juice bar.
---
Last time I did that, I had 2 dozen level 1 eyebots come out. I got about 8 different level 1 legendaries. Also the meat piles were robot meat piles. Was odd
---
Sherlock here might be on to something...
---
I didn't remove anything, though. If a mod did it, I can't really blame them. Damn, you guys are so toxic! 😂😂😂
---
Ok thanks, back to workshops I guess.
---
i saw somewhere that cheaters has 2-3 ways to duplicate stuff, so beth will have to work a little harder than that
---
Scorched Beast Queen
---
A) Doubt you are, but your sarcasm is noted.
---
B) Your little roleplay would be pretty neat if you were not a duper.
---
C) I'm not bitter, I'm not sad .. but I am old, so you're 1 for 3.
---
Have fun playing with the Boy Suns, I'll see you in the wasteland. ;)
---
You most certainly need over 100 hours to experience all the content. Don’t confuse ~15 hours of questing with lack of content.
---
Then we will find another way. This engine is a gold mine.
---
I'm about to hit lvl 150 and the best I got was a TS-SMG with 40% bash damage, which I sold as the recoil and total lack of accuracy is just a pita.
---
I'm rocking a 1* instigating super sledge and a 1* hunters handmade for nearly 50 levels now, as I simply refuse to buy one of the higher tier weapons because I want to find it on my own.
---
Sometime. Somewhere. Somehow. Maybe. 
---
I have had protectrons, but they were high level.
---
What?  You DON'T run around with 400lbs of mini nukes?!?  XD
---
See you in the wastelands, grandpa!

This is a pretty good guide for animal taming.
---
Happened to my boy and I last night. Reported the dude. Weird part is, when I took the armor off and left the world/came back in, it self repaired.
---
Take my updoot and leave.
---
Same. I reported him.
---
Oh I didn't realize perception affected players as well as pve. Thanks for the info it is useful to me (15 perception 15 agility build).
---
Caps or your junk bag, and back away slowly.  Lol.
---
The quality of Bethesda servers, if thats what you're going to be renting off them why would you want to rent one of their servers?
---
All my good legendary‘s were found at White Springs, though mostly one star they are still kick ass. I found plenty of two shot and a couple explosives there. I’d say the majority of them came from when the place was not nuked. But lately it feels like around the world I’ve been seeing a lot more of three star legendary‘s and they tend to usually drop three star items… Whether they’re good or not is an entirely different story. Worth mentioning that I’ve played this game ALOT. That helps with the RNG lol
---
no.
---
Good fun for 30-60 hours.  More if you take your time.  There's almost nothing to do though once you've gotten to level 65ish.  There's some story, but the whole game is just grinding to get the perks and gear you want and then having not much else to do.  Legendary Grind at the end will take you forever since you only have a 1/44,000 chance of finding the legendary item you're after.  Better off saving caps and buying stuff from the bazaar.
---
Game mechanics also kinda of force you to wait until you're level 50 before doing the main quest-line and some side quests.  The rewards you can obtain from the quests are unique and some are quite strong.  Completing them before level 50 will net you an item that isn't max level, but at max level would be very viable.  (If you're going Melee, don't do the Watoga Mayor quest until you're level 50!)
---
I have a CAMP setup in the Bog, outside of Watoga, and there is some kind of spawn point nearby because there is something waiting for me about 90% of the time when I load in there.   Usually, about once a day, the creature that spawns is a 3 star legendary. I makes for a nice way to get a chance at something without specifically trying to farm. 
---
I have 15 base luck and run multiple unyielding armors, often over 20 and sometimes 25-29.  I definitely don't feel lucky when it comes to legendary drops.  In fact, I feel unlucky.  At level 78, I was still using a non-legendary combat shotgun mostly until I found a ghoul killer at a vendor, which is actually where I've gotten most of my worthwhile legendaries.
---
Dang. Must admit I've not used the powered gates despite having the plan as I prefer the garage door. They sound a little troublesome. Feels like it would take more dev effort to make them function so poorly, than to function intuitively.
---
Yes, there’s a few vids on YouTube pointing to this in PC already. People with large stash sizes should just be banned outright. Time to get tough, but how would that be checked?
---
lolz at the luck given for the locker plans.
---
I got disconnected from the server while in the Whitesprings bunker. Logged back in, the game puts me outside in a double nuke zone. What's the easy fix for that, Mr. Higs99? Hmmm?
---
Tell me about it; I just about disassembled my toaster the other morning. Spriiiiiiings!!!
---
Or maybe universal camos
---
All Rise is amazing! Also, the reward for Cold Case is pretty awesome while leveling!
---
I've had 5 drop, and 3 of them were explosive.  I just had one drop yesterday, a TSE black powder pistol.  Pretty fun gun to use, actually.
---
My experience exactly. 
---
I had three attack my camp, not anywhere near a fissure, it was fun killing them but the reward/drop is always such a damp squib. Took some neat pictures.
---
ScorchBeasts spawning when you login to your Camp seems to be common, at least for me, like many here I usually just quit and try again, unless I'm in the mood and have mats to repair the Camp after.
---
Arrrr!
---
Only legendaries I have that I actually care about is a level 30 Combat Armor Arm that I'm still using at 65 because I love the Chameleon effect, and a level 3\* Lever-Action Rifle with +10 Damage if mutated, +33% VATS hit chance, and +1... to some stat. Perception, maybe? I don't remember. The arm I found, and haven't gotten anything better, and the rifle is pretty decent, but that I just got lucky and picked it up from a vendor after someone else must've tossed it.
---
Personally, I'd LOVE if they'd implement a system similar to the "Legendary Modification" mod from Fallout 4; make it so that we can add legendary effects to items through crafting, but with the restrictions that adding any legendary mod requires the use of legendary components, only obtainable by scrapping legendary items, and the only way to learn a specific legendary effect is by scrapping an item that has it.
---
Done this way, there would still be a degree of randomness to it, in that, if you're looking for a specific effect, you'd still need to get lucky to find an item that has it. But, you wouldn't need to worry about it being the wrong level or type of item, since once you'd know the effect you'd be able to add it to anything. This also makes finding legendary items more meaningful in general - currently, if it's something you won't use, it's basically just junk. But with this, even if my stealth sniper would get something like a Mutant's Rolling Pin, it'd still be useful, because I could break that down to get components to use towards making something I actually want.
---
Fine, stay here then.
---
THAT capped your interest, eh?
---
Agreed
---
Don't forget they have a tendency to explode after you kill them!
---
Definitely not. I was like damn, this song is pretty suggestive. Contextually “brand new hole” makes sense lol
---
I just wish I could repair it to 200% when it is at 100% since I always forget to equip the perk lol. 
---
You over estimate yourself, eventually there will be nothing left for you to exploit and you will whine and complain about it. I look forward to that day
---
Shiiit 
---
So I should just use the ultracite armor plans for myself? 
---
Seriously?
---
Are you absolutely sure you're not toying with me?
---
*edit if you choose to setup right near white springs  prepare to have your entire fort destroyed. Especially if you have a Red Rocket Sign.
---
And that is why people server hop and grind.
---
The chances of getting anything even remotely above average when it comes to legendaries is so miniscule that it requires quite possibly hundreds if not closer to a thousand legendary drops before you get something you actually want to use. I think i've seen a single TS/explosive or armor piercing legendary from a drop i myself got in all of my almost 200 hours. (and wouldn't you know it, it was underleveled)
---
I get it, you have a tiny wiener. You've made it very clear.
---
And I look forward to the day when Bethesda eliminates every single exploit from this game.
---
But, just as your wishes, that's not happening.
---
What i said is true though.
---
Only after you've ran out of stuff to do then farm for another 100 hours do ppl turn to exploits.
---
They'll get bored eventually and move on, that's a given. And the game will be better because of it.
---
Aye matey..
---
The wolves are a nice change from most other creatures as they are not deformed and mutated, they're quite cute really, nicely modelled.
---
When I first played New Vegas (My first and favorite Fallout) Every new character I would do I would only use a certain weapon type and not allow myself to use others. Energy Gun account= couldn't touch guns, only the energy weapons I could find. 
---
Now on 76 I'm finding that with the greater weapon variety I can do that again (couldn't in FO4 really) and its working pretty well. My main I just used whatever works best at any time but I'm having fun being an explosives build with exceptions to where I can use melee as backup when I run out of grenades until I can get a missile launcher or M79. So far its going well, need to discipline myself more though haha.
---
Got an instigating lever action, mutant slayer gatling with 25% faster firing speed, nocturnal speedy pool hook (does more than my all rise at night, otherwise I use a sword with extra limb damage during daytime). 
---
Lots of fun things,  there's so much more than boring TSE
---
Fun fact: place a banjo in the shower and you can play music for the bonus while deradding at the same time.
---
Works for stools and some other chairs too for those not musically inclined. 
---
Never tested it on beds 
---
Oof 😂😂😂
---
You can sell those to new players for 100 caps. Tell them it allows them to do new construction on their camps.
---
Create an imgur account and post the picture there. Copy the link to that post and make a post here with that link in the body.
---
Lol imagine toys were the trick to run nuke zones without hazmat/pa
---
Yup, it's a new bonus until Jan 21; too bad they autoscrap as junk
---
It is not random, you will get it on your first successful SBQ fight, it is a quest reward.
---
I used the rad shower at the mines with starched genes and I still lost mutations.  I think starched only works for radaway?  
---
Okay so the patch has done something to it 
---
Genes, they do know something about biology at Bethesda, even if they don't understand coding very well. KEK
---
Yup, both Voice of Set and Blade of Bastet can be upgraded to level 45 variants.
---
I like to wear the Bowler hat and a monocle with the uniform. 
---
For sure, as long as they make those weapons not a 1 in 10000 dice roll and actually attainable through gameplay (even if you have to grind a bit). The problem right now is that the best "normal" endgame gear you can get without farming legendaries is like 1/10th as powerful as the best legendaries. There's just an insane discrepancy there for people who don't want to beat up 10,000 ghouls. 
---
The completionist people who love grinding and want the absolute best gear are great to have for the game. However, they should be rewarded with items that are ~10-20% more powerful than what the "average" endgame player can get, not 1000% more powerful. 
---
Unfortunately I sold it immediately, should've kept for meme value
---
Ever get an answer?
---
That's a beautiful bug.
---
Hotrod power armor paint(1300 atoms). Also had a matching power armor station(700 atoms).
---
I bought a Door and the Nukagirl suit... oh and the small succulents  they really do wonders for the coffee table cooker stash box.
---
So you blame the workers to the same extent as management? 
---
I'm fairly certain she can junk straight to the enclave quests.
---
Doing the bunker stuff leads to BoS but you can be line to bos too.
---
Probably messes up quests though
---
Yup we agree with you, trick is not to be dragged in to spend real $$, just save and have a  goal for a specific item, then work on your next goal. It is cleverly made to get you to spend real $$ and I am sure people are to avoid the grind, but just keep doing your dailies. Out of principle I will never spend a real $$, I can live with my shack until I can afford something like that coveted shaggy carpet ..
---
All Rise All Day.  I found one that was assumably sold to a vendor in Watoga and have been rollin' with two of those puppies at 200% durability from then on.  When one breaks I don't have to tuck tail and run.
---
If you want to launch a nuke tonight I'm down! 
---
&gt; Rule of thumb is to bulk everything you can (except plastic itself).
---
I was under the impression that only a few things were worth it to bulk, since many things actually weigh more when bulked.
---
People are so quick to jump on the “I hate dupers” bandwagon but they forget they were also the ones buying TSE weapons, Serums, power armor, etc for super cheap. 
---
I didn’t see any posts hating on dupers when it was at its prime. Now that most of y’all have what you wanted without getting your hands dirty, you wanna get on your righteous white horse. The problem is Bethesda and has always been Bethesda, with this half-assed launch. 
---
THIS WORKED!! THANK YOU!!
---
Please do not fix this Bethesda or make it so if you die by rads within a minute of loading in you don't lose your junk. I log off at WS Golf Club just so there is a chance I load in to it during a nuke.
---
It’s definitely in the game but I have yet to find the recipe.
---
Sweet. Will do.
---
agree so much.  you can't have crafting a camp (rebuild the wasteland!) be an important feature, and set an overly restrictive camp budget.    
---
also, i noticed today that wonkiness is still rampant.  tried adding a second water purifier, then didn't have the budget left to wire it up.  saw i had a stupid amount of vegetables in my stored items (bug?  i dunno, i had 23 stored corn for some reason), cleared my stored items and was still maxed out.  deleted some other stuff, including a wired poster that was serving as a power conduit.  still not enough to craft A WIRE.  and now a turret is unpowered.  scrapped the new purifier and i still, somehow, am maxed out and cannot re-wire.  end result is it let me build something, but not power it, and i wind up with less items in my camp, items that were wired no longer wired, and removing the new thing i was allowed to build, as well as other items, and somehow that increased the hit against my budget?  maddening.  
---
hoping budget will correct itself on re-login, but really frustrating.
---
Only 3* I've looted is my 262 Damage (with 4/6 melee cards &amp; 15 Strength) Grognak's Axe with 40% Attack Speed, 15% block and +30% animals.
---
The swing speed is insane, very happy with it!
---
With the revive/respawn mechanic I always think of the Boston common duel in Highlander.  "I apologize for calling the Overseer a bloated warthog, and I bid you good day."
---
&gt; I say this in all sincerity :KEEP ALL DISEASE CURES~! DO NOT SELL THEM. They are rare and you will need them if you don't have many perks. Even at the rank i have (45) i sometimes allow myself to have a disease to keep the cures or give it to a lower leveled player in need.
---
Pro Tip: the sulphur fountain at the Whitespring cures diseases (it's located in the springhouse near the tennis courts/golf club). So, once you have access to the Whitespring, disease cures should no longer be a concern. Just drink from the fountain for free. 
---
Now do with Patrick Stewart's voice
---
Ok Guys! If someone is still interested. I tested many things. The sadly truth is that Speed Demon can not be stacked. you got 2 options. Play only with the mutation speed demon or with Perks. SD gives you +20%. Gun runner, Death Man Sprint and Squad Maneuver +20%each. Maybe I will delete all my mutations tomorrow and test only the Perks!
---
See you :) 
---
what is with you and Frank Horrigan?
---
Just go to the cave with the 2 deathclaws, it begins the quest when you step in the elevator. I launched a nuke before I had even met Rose
---
At least it isn't scorch beasts. I had this really nice camp on the hill right next to an aluminum vein. It was the best spot ever. First it was scorched, then wolves and then suddenly scorchbeasts. I was lucky that my brother in law was there to help me kill them. But after the 3rd time, I decided to move my camp elsewhere..
---
&gt; This is why I hate doing Scorcch Beast Queen
---
And here I thought that the claws, sharp teeth and infection chance were the main issues when doing the Scorch Beast Queen.
---
Silly me.
---
I couldn't agree more.
---
Hypocrites!
---
Only if you let some part of you get caught in a vise.
---
Chems are bad m'kay
---
I find that the Tesla charging shotgun barrel hits more mobs per shot. The charging barrel (non shotgun), however, just crashes my game (PC)
---
That's a nice story, too bad it's mostly fiction. You could have a 15 shot fatman and it wouldn't do enough to kill anyone who wasn't flagged.
---
Yup. My level 78 still uses the upgraded blade of bastet. It's still my best single-handed melee weapon. I wish I hadn't lost my Voice of Set.
---
That's terrible ..  I have yet to kill the queen. All I want is the decontamination arch plan, how often does this drop ?
---
Just sent a friend request. Come visit my camp sometime.
---
Yeah but you fucked up too. So I wouldn’t be speaking. 
---
&gt;Tse weapons drop reasonably enough
---
ha ha no they don't, that's how you know when people have dupes.
---
Side note:  Props for wearing the swim suit into battle, you are the hero we need right now.
---
Enlightened Moth Man thanks you for the light brother.
---
I'm in the same boat, I attempted once without codes. Got about halfway through when I didn't have enough mats to repair the 15 broken computers. It takes some effort for sure. GL
---
I didnt even realize that was there!! LOL
---
I learned something today!
---
Wayyyy to much green on there for me, but pretty spot on
---
&gt; Therefore instead of variety, your best choice would be the fastest firing weapon, since everything would kill in the same amount of hits. 
---
SMG is doing 50 dmg per shot with all the buffs and best combos and this damage after armor mitigation  
---
SR is doing 200 dmg per shot with all the buffs and best combos and this damage armor mitigation  
---
... we have 100hp, so 200 dmg is obviously too big, so we need to reduce its damage, what like 60%, that leaves SR with 80 damage and SMG with 30 dmg, now how are these two weapons making same damage? It takes atleast two shots to kill with SR, while SMG takes 4 shots.
---
Best I got was a Junkies Tesla with explosions .. never seen a two shot explosive drop in over 300 hours of playing and doing a slightly more than casual amount of legendary farming 
---
Your first kill will always give the arch plans.
---
It's called fake news for karma points.
---
That's definitely not my experience. I've got a couple of 2 shot weapons in my stash, and a lot of OK 2 and 3 stars that I need to sell off. All that I found at or near max luck. 
---
I don't now what's worse the ninja scorpions or the stealth mole rats. 
---
If I'm lucky I can manager to sniper them a bit from a distance, that works maybe 25% of the time. 
---
New challenge: Blow up a Radscorpion with a missile launcher.
---
Yep it seems to be there way to make ppl mad to force pvp. I am not mad at them wanting to pvp its part fo76 but I don't understand destroying ppls builds you can start pvp without it guess they want to start it fast by raising a large bounty then pvp will come to them. 
---
TSE?
---
Because how dare you stop us from spamming the front door with our TSE shotguns!
---
... there, i finished your title.
---
(but in all serious, preventing other people from getting XP is a shitty thing to do.)
---
The game will be dead if people start moving on because they are bored. How many times can SBQ runs be enjoyable?
---
pvp is one of the few things i still have fun with in the game. 4v4 pvp fights are so great
---
Really nice build, mate. I am a big fan of how you built a house...in the tower. It looks organic to the location, and I am really impressed/jealous. Good job.
---
Those are understandable complaints. I've played a little in the past but I keep having to remind my friend who just started, that ESO has been around for a few years and has all sorts of updates and add-ons. Fallout 76 is brand new and still relatively bare-bones, making it a lot easier to understand and get into. I agree ESO can be a bit overwhelming at first but it's a ton of fun once you get into it.
---
And that is exactly the reason why i don't like the perkcard system in the first place. Especially with mods allowed and you being allowed to switch them during combat.   
---
It makes the entire perkcard system redundant, if you can swap them anyway to your liking. Point given. You first have to set it up, but for what does it exist then? The idea was so you don't have absolutely every perk constantly active. But that is what you do in the end. You just need to quickly swap it out.   
---
The perksystem in F4 was a much nicer thing for me. And to aquire higher or better perks is pretty much the same. You still have to level up your SPECIAL first until you unlock the new perkcard to aquire. So they pretty much could have taken the old perksystem, since you still need a ton of levels and playtime to unlock "all" of them. 
---
Helpful hint........railings and low fences are your friend.
---
If they're high enough to stop the scorpion from travelling over them, and they can quickly walk around them...........they'll walk around them.
---
Scorpions generally dive when 1.  You get up high and they can't hit you OR 2. The path to you looks like it will take more than 3-5 seconds to walk to you.
---
This makes scorpions a lot easier to deal with.  Now if you don't have any railings / low fences, good luck?  lol
---
Coulda have at least been an explosive drill... 
---
Not a bug, its the new Chinese sweatshop feature.  After 12 hours and hundreds of wallets, you will receive 4 caps.
---
I know it's not showing up in your list of mods (instead of being greyed out), but try equipping the perk card that lets you add higher tier PA mods.. It's a long shot!
---
Bowie Knife with Swing Speed and Instigating
---
Buts its worth it with Ammosmith Perk going from 5 fuel to 8 /s
---
How did the game crush?
---
With ammo smith flamer fuel is maxed out at 9, super duper gets that to 18, you can loot more of super mutants, however cryo cells is a little better with ammosmith
---
Thank you [**u/Narrator69**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Narrator69/)!!!

---
This worked it seems there is a stash bug...
---
This is what I hate most about Fallout - all Fallout: that the best weapons in the game are always RNG-dependent. Having to farm a monster for the chance that it'll drop something of value is the dumbest possible way to get good gear. IMO.
---
Also, super sledges, like All Rise, are two-handed weapons, even though in PA, you use it one-handed.
---
Yes allowed? ... or yes wanted? ... or yes to one of the two?
---
Hey it's your game, play it as you will.
---
What is the primary benefit of the Ultracite rounds?
---
Oh, for sure. But at least I'm not a hypocrite about it.
---
Agree with my methods or don't, but I'm having my fun.
---
I can no life the queen with ya :) 
---
I got it as the quest reward for completing the scorched earth event.
---
No because them entering is not a crime, if you don’t want someone to enter lock your doors. But since they can’t steal anything I usually keep most of my camp open to the public.
---
It’s true you can learn it from eating it. Buy it off of someone 
---
Glad to hear, your welcome.
---
Yeah, I just use the normal semi-auto barrel.  Not trying to do damage with it, just want the "hit" on all of them for XP and drops :)
---
Very nice work, thanks for sharing
---
Oh... Well time to go do some brain exercises to maybe become smarter, you know, so stuff doesn't fly over my head lol
---
Does he show up every time?  I did this my first time this weekend and by the time I got down the stairs, he was jut sitting there all peaceful.  I took a bunch of photo-modes and a few screenshots, but I wasn't sure if it was special enough to post here.  I was not expecting it!
---
I bought the racecar bed. I love it so much.
---
What the hell are you trying to say?
---
More damage :)
---
Bobby pens are it for me!
---
Repairing it to 200% does around 230 damage for me which drops as that condition goes down. 
---
I will join as well I can’t be on for about 4 hrs tho
---
I’m beyond irate at the vendor caps situation, their is no reason, a casual player like myself, should have to server hop 15 times! In order to sell a few rad aways like i just had to do. Are you serious? They couldn’t have made it character bound? They needed to make vender caps shared across whole server? Wtf
---
You can shoot them if you want a bounty and reason for them to kill you.
---
You would think after all of this time a "Rejoin Previous Server" option would have been added by now. I imagine it would be relatively simple and should be a high priority.
---
This helps a lot, thanks
---
Nah usually takes me about an hour to farm around 5kish, can easily do 20k a day if you have the right group :)
---
Please tell us that you use a flamer and this perk card: [https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Friendly\_Fire/Fallout\_76](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Friendly_Fire/Fallout_76).
---
I once encountered a 3 star deathskull radscorpion. I didn’t live long enough to run.
---
Nope. It works with the shower too. Was your Starched Gene card maxed out?
---
frozen to eternity
---
Nice thank you.
---
That's two weapons. Now do the rest. Don't forget to factor in fire rate. If I can shoot you 15 times, in the time it takes you to shoot once, 4 shots is nothing.
---
Yeah the Lever action is the best sniper imo.
---
with speed demon the reload is amazing. SO fast. The single action revolver needs a reload speed like this. 
---
With weapon artisan and gunsmith I don't repair often. 
---
Then again, I use unarmed for close range. 
---
Fair enough. 
---
So loyal fanbases don't keep games alive but the exploiters do?
---
Same story here. Idk % wise but I had as much hp left as a diluted radaway would take off in rads. I was running through flatwoods and just died out of nowhere. 
---
The back end of my camp is made of foundations at their max height before floating to solve that same issue. I know for sure you can make a whole base this way at least half a wall height off the ground. As far as fast travel is concerned. It’s random where the game spits you out so until we get the fast travel welcome mat I would say no to fast travel only but you can make it so only jetpacks and marsupials can get in.
---
I also have another technique that involves making an entire base floating using upper level floors and no foundations however you HAVE to have a staircase leading up to the floating base this way. But you could probably go much higher with it.
---
My psn is BirdJP19, usually online late afternoon if you shoot me a message on here or if im online ill forsure be down to do as many as you want
---
You get BoS Paint for turning in Technical Documents, fyi
---
I dont think it would reclaim your workshops back 
---
I didn't just expect it, I hoped players were doing this.  I personally don't raid or grief, but I do like the fact that its going on and if I am bored or if an opportunity comes up to pvp, I see it as flavor. I don't take that stuff personally and it breaks up the monotony.
---
Southeast of Sylvie and Sons Logging CAMP, to the left of the tree house by Harper's Ferry. 
---
There's a Junk node next to a large basin of water. Discovered it the other night, and I'm obsessed. 
---
A BB gun that fires blunts
---
Lolol I should!!! I've only ever found 1 flamer so far tho and it was like a lvl 40 😭
---
Hope PS4 is better too - OMW home from work to fire it up
---
Only if you have a No Trespassing sign up.
---
Ah, that's how people are instantly gibbing the Scorchbeast Queen before the quest even loads
---
Which PA? And was the brightness increased with the patch or you’re just saying it’s already an op light?
---
Gonna make some baby rattle armor real quick
---
Stupid question, are we supposed to keep mods in order to make the thing the mod is for?
---
Half of ten million damage is still five million damage.
---
Blade of Bastet is my go to when accuracy/damage are needed. I also love the Anti-Armor Ripper (55 V Fast damage when repaired to 200%) with the extended mod for when I'm just killing ghouls/animals. Really satisfying in my opinion.   
---
I don't need a 1 hit... my .50's three round burst is deadlier.
---
Can you give me the link for that vid?
---
Today is a national hat day or something like that
---
If you shoot them in your CAMP, you'll be Wanted, unfortunately. 
---
My contribution: grab golf outfits and golf skirts whenever you find them. They're worth 20 caps each without any perks. One of the train stations (the one by top of the world, maybe?) always has one lying on the floor next to a suitcase. Easiest 20 caps you'll make, next to clearing out a workshop (not claiming it or defending it, just simply killing all the enemies around it).
---
"Psychiatric Help 5 caps"
---
Scared to post ur handle? Lol 
---
There's no reason why it couldn't, unless someone else claimed them in that time. They could have a 5 minute window to rejoin and still have ownership or something like that.
---
Blueprint everything, restart with little to no work. It happens ..
---
Will do. My main is 70 tank needs respec and my alt is a lvl 17 stealth
---
The offer extends if you need help as well
---
Loyal fanbases kill off their franchises by blindly supporting them until the straw on the camel's back becomes a telegraph pole.
---
&gt;Its fallout. Longevity is based around alts
---
Why create an alt when the gameplay experience is identical? Previous games had branching storylines and mutually exclusive decisions. The only reason to make a new character is 'I want to hit this Rad-Bat with a sledgehammer instead of a gatling laser'.
---
Don't hit the robots then....
---
Updated Bright light using X01 
---
Enclave medical bay has them randomly i think
---
Mods are not plans. Once you apply the mod to an armor / weapon, it is "consumed", and you can't use it again. But if you keep some of them in your stash because "maybe one day I will use it", you should be careful about this issue (game eating them instead of using your bulk)
---
If you plan on shooting in the general vicinity of the bots, use VATS, or don't shoot near them. Pick a different target.  It really is not that hard.
---
I would also shy away from Shotguns. The spread of the shot can hit the bots.
---
The game is literally on fire and you’re just adding more fuel, that’s all you’re doing. 
---
You’re not justified man, and you’ll never be. And obviously it’s fun. I think it’s safe to say that everyone here would have fun running around with high-tier/some of the rarest legendary combinations. That’s not the point. 
---
Promise I am creepier then u think 
---
Only if they break something such as your locked front door...
---
I noticed that if someone is wanted you can level their base with no consequences. Unless that’s changed.
---
Not just any monster either, a lvl 95 3 star boss. Icing on the cake was I didn’t even get a broadsider, just the ammo haha.
---
We need pvp servers where we can loot other players stuff, more than jus junk too.. I dont want to be isolated to small arena or some bullshit like that. I want open pvp servers to be a thing.. and for everyone crying "i dont pvp" jus stay on the pvp servers
---
Yeah it’s possible
---
I know about that, though considering the Flamer uses up fuel as as fast as the Minigun I'd think you'd be able to craft the fuel in sets of 100.
---
Did you then use the entire roll to repair your shirt?
---
You are so mean. And I'm okay with that.
---
Wanted persists until another player kills you.
---
Yeah the plastic cups litter the floor
---
Watoaga maybe kinda high but the cafeteria or any cafeteria is good, Check Flatwoods bar and grill as well
---
Happy hunting 
---
in welch there's a safe that can spawn drug recipes and if that fails just go to the Enclave Bunker and see if the medical wing has it in stock
---
Yeah and also if you have a stack of something the total weight of the stack.
---
Don't hit the robots.
---
Low level or not, don't hit them.
---
At level 60 I've been sent packing due to missed shots
---
The sentinel armor with secondary assassin effect. I spent lots of trades and caps to get my set together, and it's mixed pieces (robot, raider, marine, etc) but the affixes were all I was after, that's 15% damage reduction while standing still times five pieces is 75%, then you add the five times assassin effect from players and you're at another 40%. The game caps resistances so you cannot get 100% I believe with just this, you also need the perk "dodgy" which at max gives 30% damage reduction at the cost of 30 ap. At this point, while standing still, you are immune to almost all damage, your ap will go down as you take damage instead, then once ap is gone you WILL die. However on a high agility build the ap is not much at all, I have 250 ap give or take. The combo lets you tank even two shot explosive shotguns to the face. I can shoot my own TSE at my feet directly and take NO damage. The only thing that counters it is extremely high RoF weapons, as they drain the ap of the target very quickly. And the whole bobblehead thing, people can stack high enough damage to one shot you anyway, but in normal conditions, you are essentially invincible.
---
Perhaps one day Bethesda gets their shit together and fixes this game. Until then, I'm having fun.
---
The MIRV took a bit of getting used to, but now I love it. In Fallout 4 I tried it out and then reverted to the regular, but in this game when I got Daisycutter I decided to keep the MIRV and try to figure out how best to use it. 
---
I have gotten so I now use it to clear rooms indoors. Makes running a silo to launch a nuke go pretty quick. Only blow myself up about 1 out of 4 times now, down from 3 out of 4 times when I started. 
---
Yep, as long as the event is active
---
Oh, they could make many things easily and long time ago :)
---
This is wizard AF
---
Guitar sword for style points.
---
it doesn't double the extra from ammosmith only the initial amount.  so it would be 9+5. just like if you get the extra from SD on 5mm or .50 it gives you 280.
---
Have literally never seen this. Cool!
---
Do you lock your doors? If I come up to a base and the doors are locked I will level everything. What else can you do when you have max caps. 
---
....That being said sometimes if im bored and come across a base ill do the same even if its unlocked. lol 
---
Just so you know though you can replace your (camp) down and it will be repaired fully. 
---
Can you hit air to heal up?
---
Someone get the gimp out of the stash box ASAP.
---
Duty, honor... courage... Semper Fiiiii…….
---
Germans dont agree with the nazi party.... racist. 
---
My PSN Medougal 
---
You don't, unfortunately. You'll have to breach through the wall with the power armor.
---
Hate? Not really. Annoyance would be closer. Pity for dupers and people who buy their weapons is even closer.
---
No longer.
---
....well I'll be, I had planned to suprise my fiancee with an in game wedding if she ever got the game, I cant believe someone else had the same idea &gt;&lt;  amazing
---
If they walk into your spaces, they haven't done anything wrong. If you have locked the door and they pick it (or if they pick open any locked extractors), then they become wanted and you can shoot them.
---
Two shot explosive
---
Lol so a melee shotgub build in pa identical to vats rifleman?
---
Jesus,
---
Like i said, i can't wait for the losers to move on.
---
I'll thank them for funding this game
---
You only need to server hop if you're trying to find a specific plan, but caps are bound to per character, and restock after 20 hours after first transaction. If you use this sheet you will be able to see when the restocking of caps will happen for each of your characters.
---
Americans don’t agree with trump... racist
---
I don't understand why people pay 24 dollars for a single cosmetic, yet here we are
---
Yes, you can shoot someone legally at any time or place. 
---
The game is set in the US after all.
---
"You (cough), you haven't won here. You and your mutie-bastard friends are gonna join me in a big ol' mushroom cloud sendoff. I just triggered the self-destruct. (Heh, heh; cough, cough,...) The work will go on. You didn't do nothing here, 'cept seal your own death warrants. Duty, (cough) honor... courage... Semper Fiiiii........"
---
Did I once mention killing anyone? No? Then pipe down. 
---
So... could someone tame a scorchbeast? I've seen some high level players who would definitely be double a scorchbeast's level. 
---
How do you send messages?
---
Am I the only one dang feels bad
---
That explains how I was able to take him out when he was hopping around but not standing still. 
---
Yeah apparently you can also hit teammates. That's what someone said.
---
No, up by Toxic Larry's Meat. Snallygasters and cat meat galore!
---
I build in Whitesprings, but way off to the side of the clubhouse inside the creek.  I am far enough away to avoid pulling ANY aggro, and my turrets (only set up for random attacks) can't even fire far enough to hit the building. My doors are unlocked for anyone to come in and craft/repair, and water purifiers are openly flowing. The biggest reason I do this, is because it will block someone from setting a CAMP up in the window, due to proximity. I am against stealing kills/XP/farming, and only set up for utility purpose. 
---
i mean when it happens they're a good distance away its just the odd one that'll be a dick and just be like shoot me, i usually don't have issues with it it's just I feel like they need to make the agro a bit less harsh especially because there is no reward
---
I ran the Pip-Boy Radio mod inFO4. It was great blasting Super mutants to Metallica's "Enter Sandman" and other Heavy Metal.
---
I'm always up for fighting the queen! My gamertag is celeste_strange
---
Too bad, that was one of two bugs I liked. 
---
because OP is making things up knowing this shit will get eaten up like crazy on this sub
---
oh no
---
I see you just glossed over the part where the game is the same. Or can I choose to side with a different faction in my second playthrough? Is there an NG+ option?
---
I think some/most of those will make it in eventually.  I like the log cabin walls
---
If only the rug glitch worked too.
---
Geezus f(*&amp;. Can't you people hear the sarcasm?
---
nooooo
---
That's so dirty and I fucking love it.
---
I'm saving also. Glad I did the last go around because I love the tuxedo set. Plus saving is smart cause they always have those limited time deals. Dont wanna really want something and not have the atoms when the offer expires. 
---
Did you get a prime receiver or plans or anything?
---
Never drop your primary weapon.
---
Perhaps I thought it was equipped but wasnt.  Ive been avoiding getting the shower for this reason!  Thanks for the info.
---
Yep, this is something I'm expecting from the Order of ~~Mistresses~~ Mysteries
---
Well Azore, you, and I are a group of mutant friends.
---
It just works.
---
shoot the bag
---
Yeah, he definitely had this setup, it's really hard to get legit and with duping people are spreading sets around more and more. I found one piece of it on my own and traded away alot of good shit for my set. It pisses me off that people are just getting the rarest shit from their friends and not having to earn it though.
---
I appreciate it. I usually wear it if pvp is inevitable. I didn't mention it in this post but in the hour and a half of pvp my PA lost an arm and both legs. Noone had caps left by the end. I was left with 400 but I started with 1.2k. I think I was lucky for the most part. It was honestly alot of fun. 
---
not the point i was making but okay, sometimes they just agro at me for looking at them. 
---
So it’s a rebel type thing then. 
---
Watch out doing that.
---
You shoot them, they shoot back, probably hit your base and go wanted.
---
You kill them, they seek revenge and know where your camp is and can freely level it to the ground
---
Do a lot of events, horde events are my favorite. Also claim workshops because you’ll then need to defend them against a certain creature for a certain amount of waves. Gives you a lot of exp
---
&gt;edit: I don't care about karma, but why would anyone downvote this? Just out of curiosity
---
There is a bandwagon that seems to troll new posts. Even responding as I do now will almost ensure some my way as well. 
---
but good info nonetheless.
---
Yep, I just found modification plans (bladed maybe?) last night from killing liberators. 
---
he stole it, didn't credit the person who actually made, and then says "you're welcome" as if he did it. Christ.
---
Yeah, and a straight jacket is not functional too! 0/10.
---
Fix It Good + Power Patcher
---
Your problems should be gone.  If not then you’re doing something wrong.
---
My friend, I was knocking them down to 1/4 hp and then waiting 10-15 seconds to give them a chance to regenerate. They were not.
---
I appreciate the advice, but it does not help.
---
Just in case they don’t have Twitter 
---
Okay cool, cause I have like seven of them and they were weighing me down so I guess I’ll collect more to scrap
---
Who's goin' chicken hunting?
---
I never do. I see the laser one all the time though.
---
That maybe kinda cool to see. There are swords a plenty just trying to gauge how the points work.
---
Would each successful parry and thrust count as a hit?
---
No PA combat or ballistic armor?
---
Are seconds and backups required?
---
I bought mine from the Medical Bay vendor in Whitesprings bunker.
---
Worth
---
It is really useful with miniguns, I tend to use the perk nonstop due to that exact reason. Sometimes you can essentially get twice the durability, if you get really lucky. But most of the times its only something like 20ish percent.
---
We's goin' chicken hunting
---
Yeah I agree we should also be able to place items like NUKA Quantum’s in your camp like the Mod (Creative Clutter)  On Fallout 4,        I forgot who it’s by though...
---
Wooooooooby wooby!
---
Wonder if they would give me atoms for receipts from the 76 gas station?  XD
---
All the atom shop stuff we’ve gotten for the most part have been in game files since launch, so they can easily drip feed us new cash shop items every week for the next 6 months, I imagine sometime we’ll get a new batch of files. I was also wondering where that colorful power armor skin came from in last weeks chrome minigun picture.. today it released as the “let’s play” skin. Not sure how I feel about that one. 
---
Happened to me too, but I was swapping the cards pretty quick so I think there might have been some server lag in play resulting in the decon triggering after I had taken starched genes off prior to my next rad bath.
---
Wow, in the time it took to click the link, go to the main page, 2 people downvoted it. Even the thank you under this from OP got 2 down.
---
I got a legendary. Then I bought a plan (its named not as lever-action rifle, something like "lever rifle") on Welch Station for 800 caps
---
Like the Y17 trauma harnesses from new vegas. I like it.
---
That's for stagger and crippling limbs, though BloodyBruce pointed out Stabilized under Intelligence.
---
You played previous fallout games with the exact same build but chose different options?
---
Same build repeatedly?
---
Hahah! Yeah, that makes sense. But for me it would still ruin the allmighty immersion, a bit.
---
Before you go crazy picking perks you don't really know what it will do when it comes to other perks, I recommend you go online and decide what type of character you want to have before waisting levels on perks and specials you don't want or need later on.
---
Xbox? i can make you this for free. 
---
I thought the overseer's stash was instanced, is that not the case?
---
If you’re on PC there is a mod that shows carry weight in all kinds of useful ways. 
---
No? What warning did you see? I’ve modded the shit out of my two shot handmade and two shot combat rifle, never had an issue myself. 
---
I enjoy it for what it is, though there is definitely some reasonable points people bring up. I made it through d2, this is a walk in the park compared to that. 
---
Obstruction Detected. Composition: communism. Probability of mission hindrance: zero percent. Tactical assessment: Breach compound to restore democracy.

The switchblade is fast but to small dmg.
---
Been meaning to try the punch fist thing
---
Same here....gamer tag is krizpymanwitch
---
Thanks for the question!  I'll add some notes on the 'why' to the list, but my take is it's because of the current popularity of low-HP melee builds.  You sit at high rads to get your max HP into a sweet spot for perks like radicool (up to +5 str when with high rads - so you can see why this favors melee), nerd rage, serendipity, and combine with a bloodied weapon and unyielding armor.  The unyielding armor boosts stats when low HP including str which directly increases melee damage, while ranged damage isn't directly improved by any SPECIALs.  Finally, melee builds have room for blocker and a lot of endurance and resistance/HP perks, to support living reliably at a low % of HP. 
---
Nope. The range on it is absolutely terrible. You practically need to be in eyeshot of your camp to be able to call it in. 
---
At the end of the day with all its flaws I still enjoy this game.
---
There are several placed with regularly spawning legendary eneies unrelated to Blast Zones, and the best weapons I've gotten have come from the Uranium Fever Event, I seem to pick up a decent weapon about 10% of the time there vs 0.25% at WS
---
Bought an explosive dragon the other day. I've killed myself with it like 10 times already. Still worth it. 
---
Sounds like reddit.
---
I forget the term for it though. 
---
Basically if 2 ppl, one in the group and the other not, have the same feedback the one in the group is ok but outside the group it isn't accepted.
---
The story is a combination of character build and story choices, that does tend to be how an RPG works. Smart man helps institute. Big dumb PA user helps BoS. Etc. Where is the replay value in 'tell the same story again, but be a bit of a different person'?
---
Again that’s it 😉 
---
Thanks!  Will correct
---
I would suggest Scrapping junk Legendaries instead of Vendoring. Vendoring them nets you pretty minimal caps, where as scrapping any and all surplus weapons often gives you weapon mods.
---
&gt; Lot of stuff takes more space when bulked. 
---
What? This can't be true
---
Honestly, it's easier to just buy one.
---
Caps are easy to come by. Setup a couple water purifiers in your camp, plant some fruits and veggies, and takeover workshops and do the defense events. You'll be swimming in stimpacks, rad-x, and radaway from the workshop stuff.
---
Sell all your excess stuff. Take the hard bargain perk and hit up all the vendors. You'll never want for caps again.
---
Do you have to be the one to launch the missile?  I've joined a bunch of SBQ battles and got credit for 'Scorched Earth' and didn't get the plan.  
---
Finest tato juice in ALLLLLLLL of Appalachia. 
---
Go get the blue lamp mod from the bunker. Makes the light just right. The red is still to dim.
---
If I had to guess, it's probably because he hasn't edited the post to give the credit to bolsey yet.
---
Ah wow ok thanks! I'm a filthy casual with no friends that play with me, so no real chance for me to do this trick, but I'll know to watch out for it in nuke zones at least and let groups do their thing.
---
My psn is BirdJP19 if im online or if I get a message on here ill be down whenever usually!
---
I'm level 302. 1 character since beta. I'll play it until I'm no longer having fun with it. Lol. As long as Bethesda is making an effort to fix it, I'll continue to return daily to my abusive relationship with fallout 76. 
---
Ah, great call!  Will add that
---
Well the whole game is shoot and loot so...
---
&gt; If all your steel is bulked and you have mods, it will use mods when you craft.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Don't bulk your steel.
---
Oh interesting, I've been tossing those - will update!
---
you just have to do them they dont require 100% 
---
You have the plan but not the skill. Equip the right perk card. If this damn 4gb update would hurry tf up, I’d tell you what perk card you need. Sorry 
---
If you are looking for the white locker, the Locker plan sold by the BoS vendor in Watoga is 100% of the time the white locker.
---
&gt; Furious melee and rapid fire guns.
---
Thanks for the comment!  I'll add some nuance to the bulking advice
---
That's weird, did you block them?  If so they shouldn't be able to join your world again.
---
If you did block them, do you play with friends?  Maybe they're friends of your friends, or are joining off them (because your friends didn't block them).
---
Really haven't had a problem like this yet in over 400 hours.
---
One-way mirror is brilliant O_O
---

How is it fun...? You spend hours duping just to slightly inconvenience some people who don't want to "play with you". Also you're proud of being a shit griefer... honestly you must feel like such a hacker. If my I rolled my eyes further they would retract into my head...
---
On one character I found a lvl 15 3\* exploding pump action. I still use this at level 140. I also found an exploding lvl 25 handmade, an exploding black powder pistol and an exploding harpoon gun. So far, none do the same damage as the level 15 shotty.
---
I am a gear driven player. I love finding new gear I can actually use. I have been very disappointed with the fact that I have been using a level 15 shotgun and Black diamond for almost 100 levels. I would so much rather find very few legendaries and have them be more useful. As it is now, most of the affixes are a joke as they just get compared to two shot and explosive. 
---
That fire flamer paint was a little too gay for me.

to help others: if you are directly behind the petrified corpse (it's standing up looking towards the pylon ) back up approx 5 steps and stop, turn right. You're looking for a skeleton laying on the ground, a green duffle bag to its right on the ground next to it

I found a sweet spot with a junk pile by a river with a creature spawn across the water, I hardly ever have random creatures getting into my base, the turrets take the spawns out. Although turrets are still slightly derpy. Location location location.

You should see how well a over repaired chainsaw with the flamer attachment works on her with the right perks.

I usually plop mine down in the river near Flatwoods, extending north - the enemy respawn rate along the whole length is low, and even if they do come around, they're easy enough to gun down. Previously, I tried some CAMPs on the eastern side of the map, but I found it too annoying to deal with gulpers, scorched and super mutants all the time. I find the convenience of having a very safe CAMP spot worth the extra caps I spend on fast traveling to event spots in the hot zones. 
---
Yup.

Do you know if the headlamp brightness increased across all power armor? My newly acquired excavator pa light is too dim.

Lol. Like if you ever played destiny , theres about 100 ppl showing what xur has every week.... would be nice to shop mentally while I'm at work is all I'm saying

I really hope so! Those areas were also performance heavy on PS4. Can't wait to test it out in a few hours after I finish work :)
---
I have consumed several plans for armor and then been unable to craft them or reread them.  I think they are being lost in the same way inventory items get lost...like the game recognizes that I've read the plan, but at the same time it doesn't have the item in my roster of craftable items.

---
I've found a few legendary heavies that mostly just make life easier.
---
A .50 heavy machinegun that gives +250DR when reloading, 10% damage when aiming and 30% damage output reduction on targets, and an exterminators gatling gun that ignores some percentage of armor.
---
Between those two guns I generally don't have much trouble with SB's or mirelurk queens, the two things that were the most irritating to deal with.
---
I too, have ghoulish! It really is a game changer in nuke zones with rad sponge.

I wish this were a option and absolutely would do it!  Would love to get those mods and even better if they did what other games have done and provide some crafting materials you can only get from broken-down legendaries.  Sadly you cannot scrap legendaries today (probably to prevent accidental scrapping) and so there's nothing to do with them but vendor for a few caps or go to the work to find a buyer outside of the game.  It's pretty cumbersome and has taught me to save as little as possible.  Ergo, this guide. :)

People make build where the will stack perks and armour that benefit them below 25% hp (especially unyielding armour pieces that give +3 to all special) With that, you can gain crazy strength points/ melee damage and oneshot almost every enemy. As long as you stay below 25% hp.

Incorrect. I've never bought anything I knew was duped. I grind my stuff the way the game was INTENDED. You can blame Bethesda, and other players all you want, but when it comes down to it, people will always find a way. And the people dupping are the assholes here. Not Bethesda. Not the ones buying. The DUPERS. Period. No matter who you try to blame or how you try to spin it. Accept the fact that YOU are part of the reason the game is screwing up so much, and fucking stop being an asshole!

Hm. I guess maybe. Thanks.

Lets hope that continues, thanks for info
---
Not true at all. Sometimes its slice and loot
---
They need to fix the bobble head glitch this is going to start getting ridiculous 
---
Quick answer - Yes. I've launched 11 nukes so far, all of them solo. Since you're going to be by yourself, that means your armor and weapons will deteriorate faster, as all enemies are focused on you. Make sure to repair weapons and armor when you get the the room where you begin replacing mainframe cores.
---
A person's name along with their general physical description and a photo. That identifies them in arrest records that are made public. It's not a witch hunt.
---
A character name where, on PC, doesn't have to match any other online identity. For console it's unlikely you're getting a full name as that is not the default at all.
---
This line of logic is horribly faulty.

I like to jump around the tops of the high rises in Watoga.

Game is what it is to each person. I enjoy it, see their progress with updates, and am only annoyed with all the people whining about things they don't actually understand in development / feel entitled to / or take a game too fucking serious as though it is a direct insult to their being.  If you don't like it, don't play. If you like it, play. As a grown-up, I can't make my own choices and don't require external validation for my feelings.. Or made up internet points.

On another note, do what's best for you. If you stay, stay and help build a better community. If you can't handle the current state, then don't.

Only that specific one.  Other water fountains will give you diseases.

If you take a workshop you open yourself up to pvp. Pacifist has nothing to do with getting killed, just stops you from opening yourself up to pvp.

Sounds like you either shot someone or was running a workshop
---
Yeah, the ratio of awesome people to not so awesome has been 99 to 1 for me.  Also met a few that may be lifelong gamer friends.  
---
So he shoots you while pvp is engaged and does no damage? Something smells like bobblehead
---
But people seem to have different outcomes most times. Hopefully its good for u

Yes I heard they’re in. Such a good addition from Bethesda.

I’m hoping to get a TSE *anything* before ES6 comes out in 10 years.

That's not the way this game works. Your name displayed is the username of your account. The only way you suggestion is possible, is if they bought another copy of the game.
---
Using blade of Bastet and Incisor perk I'd 2-3 shot people in full PA. Before everyone had TSE. 
---
Yeah the range is about 550-600fy apparently compared to the 2-3k it was in fallout 4, also it costs way more to build but it sounds pretty cool
---
Haha, does that happen? I don't think I've had the manual dexterity to try. However, given the bugs surrounding the drop bags, there's a chance for the bag to magically vanish anyway.
---
Thanks, I'll give it another shot.
---
Well it is National Hat day
---
Ultracite rounds are used by Prime receivers, which deal as much damage as a Hardened receiver and also deal bonus damage to Scorched and Scorchbeasts on top.
---
The drawback being, of course, that you need to craft the Ultracite rounds yourself, which require Ultracite and Flux on top of the usual components, and each weapon has its own Prime Receiver plans.
---
What do we want?

Better tourette's treatment!

When do we want it?

I have a 1* two shot bolt-action and .44.  I have a few 2* unyielding, which have been helpful.  Never seen an exploding or sentinel.  Stuff like instigating smgs and 3* troubleshooter rolling pins.  Just not much that I'd call lucky drops and a lot of 3* enemies yielding 1* junk.

You'll shoot your eye out!

So your mother is crying and your sister is squealing when playing video games. Unfortunately my faith in humanity just got even lower.

Yeah, without nova and such a small amount of players per map it feels quite empty, it’s like a pubg sized map

Since it shows account name and not the character name then this makes no sense. Unless people are buying the game again just to have a mule they can use while playing solo.

PvP is just about as cancer as ark. Except this time, both PvE/Pers are forced in the same room. 
---
(This is actually true in ark as well, a lot of PvE go to player vs player lobbies. Mainly because there’s a lot more room, and you can actually deal with griefers)
---
This results in griefing by blowing up an intricately designed base and having a group of 5 people shoot you down as a level 14. If I want to PvP, I’ll join that stupid radio station that was DESIGNED SO THAT YOU DON’T TROLL INNOCENT PEOPLE. 
---
For example, I just became level 25. Did the excavation armor quest, but needed to craft them. Took me hours to get it. I use everything on my weapons and armor, so I had to freshly scavenge. I finally went to the mining site to craft, and this group of level 100+ people spammed exploding guns on me. I died, they took all my stuff. I called them a bunch of trolling scumbags and got 3 days communication ban. I punched my flatscreen. 
---
Let’s just hope Bethesda actually responds to this stuff, unlike Arks WildCard. I still see major problems that haven’t been fixed in the 3 years I played.
---
Unfortunately it is. I'm on mobile right now, but if you look for "bulk spread sheet" on this reddit, you will find the details. 
---
I once checked out a dude with a decent bounty and it turned out to be a trap. He was a low level player inside his locked base clipping through the wall a bit so I was able to just one shot the part sticking out. For some reason it gave me a bounty and his high level buddy who was lurking around in chameleon armor (I knew he was there, but he probably thought I didn't) one shot me with a gauss rifle or something. Kinda pissed me off because I didn't think killing a bountied player would put a bounty on you, but I guess it must have been a trick with the wall or something. Never bothered with bounties since.
---
That's lame. I mainly call them for everyone. Or have they changed it to 1 person loots it and it's empty?
---
Bulk adhesive sells really good to vendors. I think I maxed out my vendor runs the past couple of days with that and ultracite scrap.
---
Glad to help! you're doing a great job w this guide
---
The one good thing dupers have brought to this game is the ability to kill a scorchbeast without having to use all your ammo. 
---
Follow @FalloutSearch, they usually update with atom shop updated as well as the daily and weekly challenges.
---
Honestly my first exploding weapon came from just exploring the world, and was a +1 Perception Troubleshooters Exploding Black Powder Pistol. The gun was amazing, and I think it was level 50? Pretty sure I got it around 60, and I'm 171 now.   
---
I have contrary experiences to a lot of players regarding drops though... They aren't SUPER common for me either, but I seem to be able to farm exploding weapons with about 3 days 4-5 hours a day of work, or several two shots a night if I really want to.  
---
Yes it involves reloading enemies as an exploit. yes it takes a TON of ammo if you don't already have a legendary weapon to start with, so no it's not REALLY practical until you have a good legendary. However, there are builds with well built combat rifles that can farm and kill Legendary Bloated Glowing Ones in half a clip fully automatic in a few seconds each (Silenced so you don't get mobbed), and while it will run you dry on ammo (Need 5,000 I'd say), you'll get a decent two shot weapon 'eventually' if you're SUPER lucky in your spec, and you can upgrade to more damage. If you're doing it with friends (Melee is the king of farming, so honestly a bunch of melee friends are the way to go), then you just trade the best stuff you get for each others specs back and forth to each other.   
---
Usually by the end of one night you'll have a good farming weapon at least, even if it isn't a TSE, and then the TSE is less than a month away. Yes lot's of farming, yes super grindy, yes really annoying, but no not impossible, and no duping is not essential.  
---
I REALLY hope they wipe out all TSE's including mine honestly, just because I'm so confident I can get another one, and for some reason it seems to be an issue for everyone else... I'm not saying it's easy, but players who say they've NEVER gotten one in 150 levels or such (Which are more common than not) make me think that it's not really gonna hurt me, and would put me a step above the community even though I tell people exactly what I do...  
---
I also acknowledge reloading areas is an exploit, but I don't think it's an exploit they are ever going to fix, and I don't think Bethesda considers it cheating. Frankly, it worked in every other fallout game, and is just the way they spawn enemies, alternative systems would be too tedious, and while it does result in grinding, it's not like they have other high end content that is being ignored in lieu of doing this. Also 'most' players are inadvertently using the same exploit. Areas won't respawn enemies if you kill everything, wait in the area, and no one else comes to the area, or loads in. So ANYONE who 'waits' for more things to kill is using the same exact exploit even if they didn't realize it. All the players calling it illegitimate are only themselves being truly consistent if they only ever visit any one area once a day, kill everything, and leave, not staying around if more creatures spawn because someone else enters the area, because that's the exploit. I get that logging out and back in is an 'extreme' version of this practice, but it's really to me just a gradient of the same thing, it's not different than asking people to come join the fight, leaving the area for awhile and coming back, or having a 'farming circuit, where you run in a circle activating areas killing everything and taking just long enough that by the time you get back to the beginning again another respawn happens. 
---
I use unarmed so no TSE for me. 
---
I got one shot killed by a player while farming a nuked White Springs so I blocked him and jumped servers.  The next day I was at a friends base, swapping plans, when we both got one shot killed by 2 players. When I went into social to block them I saw that one of them was the player I had blocked the night before. I'm a little pissed because I dropped all my extra plans for my friend to go through and see if there were any he didn't have yet and this douche stole them all before he killed us.  I use my extra plans to help out new and low level players so I feel double robbed now. 
---
Henisnt killing people?? Are you that dense?
---
they are chinese.

Thank you! I had been selling my mods, mostly because they were for weapons that I don’t use and I wasn’t sure exactly how they worked. I never modded anything in 4 so this whole game style is pretty new to me.

You're right. Very good point about building a good community. No point in staying and pooping all over the place.

---
Thanks for the heads up, that is super lame; not sure how I missed those patch notes. I'll pass this info onto my friends though.. the game shouldn't be pushing you towards a punishable action.

Tons of legitimate concerns are shared and upvoted by this community. What this community doesn't seem to stand for is click baity bullshit (like "Is this game going to be okay?", "Nobody can criticize this game in this community" because they got downvoted once, or parroting whatever incorrect trash some YouTuber spews to get clicks), posts that exaggerate/misrepresent issues or are overly dramatic/emotional ("I have experienced some bugs, Bugthesda is trash/incompetent" or "This game is objectively bad" style stuff), or people who are unwilling to accept that despite flaws there are people who legitimately enjoy the 76 experience. I have been critical of the game myself, and participated in other discussions that were equally critical of real issues that should be addressed. In both situations all criticism was well received and plenty of people agreed. If you're voicing valid criticism of the game and you aren't well received, the problem most likely lies in the presentation of said criticism. 
---
r/Fallout has historically been a place where gatekeeping and elitism rule the land. Prior to 76 it was nothing but a giant NV circlejerk, now it's a circlejerk designed to trash this game. Honestly, who cares and why should we discuss it? Why focus on the meaningless bullshit that furthers the divide and not discuss the game on its own merits and issues? I think that's what most people here want to see, and why posts like this are largely downvoted, ignored or trolled. Because so many people seem to want their soapbox to create a bigger controversy over different people who simply have different opinions or make some testament to the gaming industry as a whole, but the reality is we're just here to discuss the game we enjoy. It gets tiring being told nobody can do something they do constantly (voice criticism) or otherwise make some long worded post that doesn't really have much of a point other than to rant a bit. 
---
I will agree with you on one thing, at least here we are focused on a Fallout experience we can enjoy. 
---
I had just enough atoms to buy Blackbird at the time, but now I'm a broke-ass 
---
Nice! Maybe add the link to that other post with the details on bulk weight etc? Thanks for your time making this thread! You guys are making the community better.

Dont think you can complete this, at least not yet.  Possibly in an update

I agree the change sucks, I used to call them in all the time near Flatwoods to help out low levels. It's not like it's even good loot.

Nice job on launching solo! I couldn't do it
---
It's Bethesda's way to prevent duping. Can't dupe if your stuck in a crafting bench ;)
---
I got one for completing the quest in the main quest line where you go to the BoS headquarters. The quest right before Belly of the Beast. I forget the name. It was in the rewards at the end. 
---
Still haven’t completed it myself, despite having and playing every holotape. I’d guess it’s either broken at the moment, or they intend to add more later on.
---
I’m pretty sure in one of their trailers showing off a Scorchbeast, it never spammed its sonic attack. It has to be a bug with them but considering that it’s Bethesda, they probably just don’t fucking notice.
---
I know some people hate pvp but its moments like yours that make it so fun

SHOTGUN WE BUILD WITH RIFLE BACKUP. EXPECTING TO USE MUTATIONS
---
Doing the BOS events and the Technical Data quests
---
so there's meme's about bb guns in the fallout franchise but there's a huge aspect to them I don't think a lot of people understand.
---
They were always totally OP.
---
Sure people like Vinilic Puma that would have you believe that flat DPS stats are the only thing that mattered, but there was another, often overlooked feature in fallout.
---
Luck.
---
Or more specifically, critical hits.
---
See in new vegas, you had weapons that were absolutely ungodly with an effective luck build. With the right perks, some guns skills and over 10 luck, you could face down every deathclaw in the quarry with a bb gun, some pajamas, and absolutely no need to reload.
---
silenced ruger .22 pistols and American 180 .22 SMG's were also good for this, but the BB guns worked the absolute best when 'shooting for crits'. and had extremely cheap ammo to work with.
---
It might not work so good in FO76, since critical hits and sneak attack damage bonuses are calculated different than the previous games (critical hits being used when you activate them, and requiring a buildup by attacking) but they sure would be fun to have. 
---
Just don't shoot your eye out kid.
---
I have XB1X also, I can't wait to get off work and test it out. Im hoping it cuts down on all the game crashes and server disconnects. 
---
I don't even know how to dupe. D:

The syringer isn't for dealing damage, it is for adding debuffs to enemies. One of my group regularly uses a syringer on the SBQ to cut her armor value dramatically every 2 minutes.
---
Not sure why this got downvoted, it's true. It is impossible for a weapon to have both vampire's and instigating
---
Praise for the crafting bench has worked! ;)
---
You would be the 1 in the 99 to 1 ratio. 
---
I was minding my own business at a friends base. I'm also set to pacifist so even if I accidentally shoot someone it does zero damage.
---
What happens? I'm worried someone might get something of mine!
---
I like your thinking, that’s definitely a plan for the next time lol
---
Border deaths? Camps? Haha. We send people back who are coming here ILLEGALLY. The "camps" which are just nicer jail are where we hold people smuggling drugs so I dont see the problem 
---
There is a reason it was removed and against the rules. It doesn't need to incite people to harass, just give the opportunity. Fine, keep it to the confines of the game. He posts their names, I log on and report them. Then tell my friends to report them, then make more accounts to report them. Eventually they lose their account. That is why you don't post names. If it suits you to call it something other than witch hunting have at it.
---
He may not of done it but he did post it 
---
Then I hope you realize all you're doing is turning people against you and diluting the meaning of that hate when you throw around baseless accusations with it
---
I haven't done much PvP, so I don't understand, how is power armor "terrible" for PvP?
---
You sound like a griefer
---
There's an area SE of Top of the World that has a series of lakes/ponds...that's where I've had my lair for a few weeks, and I've seen 3-4 other people regularly build nearby.  Not as heavy on resources, but the water is something I look for in a location.  Plus close to a vendor-bot!
---
Ah, much clearer now, thank you.
---
How do you message someone with no in game chat? Are you on console?
---
Yeah that sucks.
---
Two things it could also be:
---
Infinite bobblehead stacking.  Basically dupers use tons of bobbleheads since they stack (which they shouldn't) to get massive damage that will blow through pacifist damage blocks.
---
Workshop PVP griefing.  They'll start claiming a workshop you own, then fast travel to you, and do full PVP damage because the game thinks they're "claiming" your workshop.  I don't claim workshops for specifically this reason.  If I need a single resource, I'll drop my camp near one of the ore resource points.
---
Make sure both you and your friend have them blocked.  Make sure none of your friends have any of them on their friends list.  Don't accept random friend invites.  Clean up your friends list to only people you play with.
---
Can't argue with you about those bastards 
---
That's why I lick everything in my base, that way no one wants to touch it.
---
*nods
---
Now there’s a thought 🤔
---
Who cares... that paint looks hella tacky
---
Wasn't really my primary. Just a secondary that was kind of better than my primary.
---
-_-
---
Nope. Just ,make sure every piece is equipped. 
---
I'm on a junk pile - I've actually started bulking and selling screws and gears because having 30+ bulk each seems a bit obscene.  
---
My husband made me a full set of Excavator PA (since I'm a pack-rat), but didn't have enough mats to finish, so I gave him whatever screws/gears/etc. to complete.  I then got the quest on my own and made them all again without any additional gathering.  
---
Ballistic fiber, however, can go suck it.  
---
So probably the guy was stacking bobbleheads or something as someone said, block report, move on, can't do much about it I am afraid.
---
So these children in cages, being ripped from their parents arms are smuggling drugs? 
---
If you think Bethesda is going to ban any of us, you are delusional. Sorry.
---
Usually it's whack and loot
---
I'm sorry, I couldn't read that over my seething hate for this post about my in game waifu.
---
Could you repeat that?
---
Not a griefer, just someone who prefers to play games that function properly at launch.
---
You don't get it every time I did get it 3/4 times.
---
That may well be so.  Some serious jerks out there, and some seriously risk-averse players as a result, which is sad.
---
They have been actively banning dupers for weeks now. Just wait and see
---
Yeah, I used to, but these days I kind of prefer sharing what I have. Still do, even with assholes like this running around.
---
No, a friend got it, and he wasn't even in the Enclave story line yet.
---
That'd be great if I ever see the damn things
---
Yeah, I'm on Xbox. No mods but being able to use the Smartglass app on my phone so messaging doesn't interrupt my game is a huge plus to me.
---
I'll definitely be on the lookout for it when I'm there farming, lol.
---
That's a myth. Show proof dude. Families are being separated to be processed and then reuintws and sent back to Mexico. No children are being put in cages. You live in some kind of lala land dude.
---
So you guys actually storm the silos and start entering the possible codes? Don't you have to spend a keycard every time you enter a code?
---
You should see Shelly D'inferno - she likes playing with fire too ;)
---
PVPing in general is to be avoided. The entire system is broken. I love being 1 shotted.
---
I hope they get rid of bobblehead stacking, if not change slap dmg to do 1 hp of damage no matter how strong you are.
---
Ahhh. I see. Logic need not apply! Carry on, fellas. 
---
I got mine at Power plant in upper right corner of map. Can't remember name
---
Yes I am. Thank you! I need 4x cobalt flux?
---
I tried using features a few times, though I don't think there was anything long like a fence. It generally turned into a kind of pillar humping and dancing around situation haha. 
---
But next time I come across these bastards I'll be sure to use your tip. Thanks for that!
---
I was going to post about this place I ran away and just made it out alive.  Never saw a place with such high rads.  
---
10/4 thanks 
---
They could do it like they did in ESO where your pet just followed you and was purely cosmetic. In that case though I would want a mini deathclaw.
---
I frequently hit the Blast Zones, and other Legendary hunting events with game friends in a team, and it's very interesting how we get completely different loot from them, Someone may get a very good 3\* explosive weapon while the others only get garbage wooden armor, and sometimes not everyone gets a legendary Item at all, we work well together to make sure everyone gets their shots in, but that doesn't seem to matter when you are teamed (one kills, all loot) and sometimes the one that killed it gets nothing while others get good stuff.
---
I did 2 separate Scorched Earth Events at Prime last night, the first was good for several decent legendary Items, and good plans, but the second one left me with virtually nothing, as the SBQ, and several SBs were completely without loot, and other enemies were about 50/50.
---
only reason I tolerate it is that it usually supplies me with fresh meat to cook and in one case last night I needed 1 more Screw to build my Fusion Generator and just as I was about to venture off to get it a group of Super Mutants attacked and one of them had Loose Screws as loot.
---
I got a TS handmade, only gun I've kept since the fire axe does 228 damage
---
If you're seeing QQ or QUN as part of the numbers.........it's "players from a specific region of the planet" selling cheats (I don't know how bad the PC police are here...lol).  QQ / QUN is a chat service (kinda like discord) where people can meet other people who want to buy cheats.
---
I've seen this in multiple games from PUBG, to H1Z1, and beyond.
---
I'd never heard of it until another person commented about it
---
I'm gonna burn Friedrich's store and use his empty shell as the toilet in my outhouse. :l
---
Got mine from tech data
---
I will check those out. Thank you!
---
Ok, i got the fusion Gen the first time. Thought it was because I did it to 100%
---
Yeah, that sucks. Too many instances of that happening and I'd just call it a day and go find something else to play. Odyssey is good and I never finished RDR2 before FO76 came out.
---
I think the worst thing about the scorps is the stagger. They're pretty fast and I think have a lunge attack, so they were constantly interrupting me during reloads... which threw off my whole game!
---
Wow that was so insightful and awe inspiring.  Now can you tell me the winning lottery numbers oh wise one?
---
Here let me try now.  You're a prick in real life you gets off going around telling people how they should deal with situations because deep down you are still dealing with the fact that your mother didn't breastfeed.  I'm close right?  Shocking how this works.
---
I see the logic behind the perk system and I see your logic as well.  I do not envy the designers who had to mold a Fallouty (new adjective) progression system to work in an online multiplayer environment.  Big advantage of online multiplayer though is systems can be modified and changed.  Big disadvantage,  they almost always have to be changed because that many players working together break systems in unexpected ways.
---
Well, at least it's not our job to fix it, right?  :)
---
Jinkies! Nice man, I unfortunately have been targeted a few times lol. I am indeed on PC. 
---
I don't think so, I know my first kill (I got the plans) was not one fired by me or my group.  
---
Don't forget the Broadsider, for when you really need to land some lubbers.
---
Make sure those empty shells arnt duped! YOUR RUINED OUR ECONOMY! ;)
---
Dude, these were only level 22 scorpion hunters, and I'm level 45 haha. I can't imagine what it would be like fighting the more \~advanced\~ versions...
---
Now that is some creative thinking, I like that idea!
---
You said you had a bounty that was worth it. That implies you killed at least one person. Don't treat the dude like he is dumb for seeing a hole in your story. 
---
25k cap bounty for hurting fluffers.
---
Well now I have to go get killed by one of these. Where did you encounter that glorious bastard?
---
I built near Whitesprings. Zoned in and found two lvl 80 scorchbeasts munching on me. So I booked it down hill to the protectrons, turned around plinked them to get aggro and then let the robots make quick mush of them.
---
I only had to repair one wall and a roof section.
---
Ofcourse you can! I'm nowhere near a "top of the hill" player. Just go with patience and remember to breathe :D  
---
Thank you very much for your good vibes, they certainly brought a smile forth behind my screen.
---
I hope we'll team up in the wastelands someday :) (I'm on PC)
---
Good sir!
---
I believe you are trying to corrupt me!  A pure, innocent man!
---
Thank you very much for your time and help!
---
To the point of the thread, the reason for removal is arbitrary and questionable. The events you described have the exact same results and effects as the number of people who raised the witch hunting torches here on Reddit. It's literally witch hunting (including creating a hysteria) over a supposed rage mob finding users on their platform and mass reporting them.
---
It's far more likely to happen right here on this sub. Just as OP allegedly has "no proof" and "is witch hunting", the very idea of suggesting people should be punished by having their posts deleted is the exact same act.
---
The person you just responded to isn't the person who made the original comment 
---
That's great to know... I blow myself up regularly.
---
That’s what I was gonna post about. Different paints and new roofs. The ones we have now are dull and adding some more in can make building or playing the role of a carpenter much better
---
Whereat? Level range?
---
Amen. This game has been a brilliant experience so far, in spite of the bugs. 
---
Best sessions I've played are ones where me and a friend log on, start at a camp and just walk in a direction. There's something different every time. 
---
Yh bro ok im on ps4 my username is LividLion637 send me a message when ur back i probably wont remember so if u just tell me that ir giving me one i will remember cheers
---
I call them the Drug Ghoul
---
Clean vs dirty? Or clean vs naughty. Because naughty clown suits... I don't know how to feel about those.
---
Inb4 the chucklefuck from earlier shows up demanding a MAGA hat again.
---
The server disconnected me exactly 7 minutes after I entered the world when I was fighting some scorched on my first log on after the patch. I then played for 2 hours with no problems. I'll update this comment with more observations when I next play. Disappointed about the fusion core glitch allegedly being fixed. It's going to be a lot less fun having to look for them all the time or not use armour when I feel like it. I will also have trouble fixing my leather armour now because I could just replace it before without the ballistic stuff which is over-priced and hard to find. They've changed that so now I'll have to stop wearing it or spend every day financing Ballistic crap. What a drag.  
---
I was just killed at Whitesprings Golf Club. Only option (twice) was to respawn there for 2 caps. No other options allowed. Bethesda promised we could respawn at our CAMP or near Vault 76. Another lie. 
---
That's 3 strikes today from me. I'm bored with this game by level 35. It's a pain in the a$$ more than it's enjoyable. 
---
I have not yet discovered any silos, you may be correct about that. I will check when I log back in, thanks!
---
I don't use them I've found a couple but I don't pick them up
---
I’m on PC if I was xbox I’d have given you the mats and some caps for the. Effort
---
Sentinel/Assassins Armor - Fireproof 3 -  Dodgy 3 - Dense Chest Mod
---
It actually is Bethesda’s fault righteous dumbass. These bugs are from Fo4, I hear. 
---
“I’ve never bought anything I knew was duped.”  Exactly, from what you think you know. 
---
And don’t be so naive. Players are always going to cheat and exploit, that’s at least consistent. You see that type of behavior everywhere you go in life. You can expect that to happen. 
---
Who has the power and ability to prevent this? Who’s game are we playing? Who released this half assed game? They still haven’t fixed bugs from game.
---
Also, there’s no ‘right’ way to play the game. That’s just your way. If I wanted to be a level 2 and dress up as a clown with a hat and crack jokes, that would be the ‘right’ way to play as well. Don’t be a dumbass, dumbass. 
---
Noted, thanks!!
---
Call them the plug 
---
Your whole family plays fo76? That's pretty awesome
---
I've found ranger outfits to sell for good caps, too.
---
But honestly, the hardest part for me is waiting for the merchants to refresh their cap stash! I need to unlock more of the faction locations...
---
Chicken Noodle Soup is the only chicken recipe I've learned so far. Don't know if thats the same as the noodle cup.
---
I get cave crickets inside the second floor all the time. That combined with how often the turrets ignore things gets old. (They are really only alarms, anyways)
---
Thanks, I appreciate the tips!
---
Yes. All mods unavailable though. Just bops people for teeny tiny damage.
---
I like using it to pacify animals. Feels weird making friends with them sighted down my shotgun.
---
Instead I show them my paddle ball. Look at my toy. I am no threat. Let me pet you.
---
Top of the mansions  in the south 
---
Can Raiders and slavers be apart of world if their all dead?
---
Wish I'd had this when I was looking several weeks back!  Thanks!
---
WITNESS ME!!!
---
i just think they need to change the agro system for them lmao so death = agro reset. 
---
Would you be interested in selling? Is it level 50?
---
It's because literally every action depletes the thirst meter. It's insane. Then when you go to drink some boiled water because your water purifiers aren't pushing out enough, you take rads. Take some radaway? Oh you're really thirsty again.
---
Enough is e-fucking-nough.
---
&gt; Lot of stuff takes more space when bulked
---
...that is so dumb wtf
---
There are a lot in the mire; if you do that daily quest at the hunter's shack you'll probably find one.
---
Meh...I've had pretty good luck and fun going it. I was wanted and hiding when some guy in Ultracite PA came near me (probably hunting me) and I went to sneak attack them but they took me out with a TSE shotty. However, they killed themselves in the process.
---
I haven't tried since the patch, but my game started crashing on Ps4 Sunday night.  Had the same issue yesterday.  I'm not sure whats going on.  It was fine for the previous 190 hours as recently as 8 hours on Saturday.
---
I've been saving but I did buy some minor things like the new years tuxedo suits (couldn't pass them up since i'm trying out a new Vats Pistol build on my new character, Bames Jond) and the light laminate floors. 
---
I've only missed one item that I really wanted and that's the blackbird X-01 set.
---
You can craft them if that quest step is completed.
---
Lolz ballistic fiber is needed on PA builds?
---
Are you sure you were not nuked? I know its unlikely since it was only a small timeframe since you were gone and back again, but that seems pretty brutal.
---
They’re keeping their camp safe to outdoor threats, which seems to include you.
---
Man I didn't know you could run 76 on the OG xbox, mine had a hard enough time with Halo 2!
---
Really though, I didn't have any issues with nuke silos on my Day 1 Xbox One, I swapped it for an S at christmas. I would just say give it a shot in a group, the lag seems to differ per person really
---
I thought so too but I'm getting one shot killed on a daily basis now. I play with a large group of friends and they are complaining about the same thing. We're all set to pacifist.
---
I'm in. My psn is johnkf199. But first, what time zone are you on? Because I am in europe..... so if you are in the USA, the times might be bad.
---
If you've never played elite dangerous look up the fuel rats. They have a discord channel that pilots can use when they run out of fuel or need repairs.
---
When you request help an operator connects you with a fuel rat playing on your platform. Same concept can apply here. 
---
It won’t let me into the bunker anymore, even while wearing the Veil (I still wear it all the time) so I can’t get to the fabricator. 
---
That happened to me, dude was destroying my camp with his TSE shotgun and I came over to defend it. He one shot killed me and I just logged out because he was obviously duping and i didn't want to deal with that. 
---
When I logged back in, my leg was totally destroyed and my other pieces all had significant damage, all from one shot. 
---
Explained it perfectly. I second this.
---
The ghouls often tend to drop weird combinations of things.
---
Canned Dog Food, a 10mm Pistol, 3 .308 rounds, and dozens of chems. No wonder you're a ghoul, buddy, you got everything wrong.
---
!remindme 11 days
---
If you're a PA user just bulk it up and sell it. I cleared 150 weight out of my stash the other day just bulking all my excess shit that this sub made me think I'd be using shed loads of. Screws, adhesive, gears, etc. Now I just keep a comfortable 150 of each.
---
Springs are the real killer. Just need 10 more to make my last piece of X01
---
Farming screws it’s toys, scales and and fans?
---

---
Game needs a major overhaul to gain more players, as it stands now my friends list is about 95% greyed out with people I haven't seen online in over a month.
---
Please nuke it, I'll enjoy collecting the bounty and whatever junk you have on you.
---
I call them druggy Bois
---
Probably my favorite behind legendary ones and even still a lot of times better than legendary. 
---
Those chems are the source of a lot of my caps. 
---
I’m not banned, if you want stuff on Xbox lmk
---
Back when there were good reasons to get workshops, I'd usually grab the munitions factory and lock off the whole dang interior. You weren't getting inside there without getting wanted. But I'd still leave a bench and a cooking pit on the roof for folks who needed them.
---
Your entire family plays the game? That's pretty friggin cool in and of itself.
---
I saw one try to storm Whitesprings gate once.  Things got testy when I intervened.  (Word to the wise, Whitesprings security does NOT appreciate getting caught in your Instigating Explosive pump-action's blast radius, no matter WHAT you were trying to do...)
---
That sucks. Im lucky i guess, i never get bugged
---
You have issues good sir.
---
Wanna know a secret? You don't need an explosive weapon for pvp... best pvp weapon imo is a DB shotty with V.A.T.S legend perks db fires so fast and at point blank in V.A.T.S you just don't miss let them hit you first make sure you have 0 junk and trade ALL your caps to a trusted friend to hold while you pvp... 0 loss good practice tactic... your enemies won't stay long after realizing you have nothing at all for them
---
Yeah the TSEs are just very difficult to fight against, especially when a crew of 2-4 feels tough and mighty for using them. Guess I just chalk it up to being hard out here in the wastelands!
---
One high level couple once sorta adopted me for a few hours and made me a bunch of armor and stuff for my camp and gave me an excavator power armor for free. Also helped me finish a quest in Whitesprings because everyone knows that's no place for a level 20 to collect a sword from alone.
---
I dont they are level restricted . I found most of them at White spring pre nuke an Harpers Ferry.
---
Yep. Your legendary drop was the drill, which isnt modifiable by legendaries. 
---
Please let duel's with blackpower pistols and no armor become a thing... 
---
Yeah...I just keep it locked to prevent wandering Mobs from pathing into my house while I'm trying to craft ammo.
---
It's nothing personal dude.
---
Just be a mutant and have a mole miner gauntlet with blades on it. Chance for bleed, stacked with talons + if its legendary(mine has bleed and does more damage the lower your DR is) it usually sits around 650 damage but on a team it gets up to 800 or so. You punch super fast so 1-2 shot everything. Just spam stimpacks and jump around with vats get close enough teleport to them boom dead. No need for tse weapons although they are fun. Since I use no armor to buff its damage my chameleon is always on making me a pretty hard target to hit when I can basically fly.
---
Totally can, 100%. Just takes one of the wooden traps, power, and a switch.
---
I built a CAMP that gets as close to Vault 76 as possible. It got me close enough to have the first dead body you see in my camp circle. Built the catapult under his body. He spawned on top and got caught in the spikes every single log in. Press the button? Vroooooommmm, off the Vault 76 hillside. Gets decent air since Vault 76 is technically up a decent hill.
---
Never had anyone come across it while I was there. Bit of a shame.
---
Totally works though. I've been on the hunt for semi public well placed bodies for this reason.
---
Are you using an SSD with your xb1?
---
Nah - I have the PA for heavy fights or extra weight, but I'm currently in leather.  Am working on White Knight though!
---
Why do you have so much luck built into it?
---
All of my workbenches are located outside, so there is no need to enter my house.
---
Sounds like the golf course, he probably demolished someone that put their camp right around the back stealing kills from everyone. And got a bounty from it. 
---
I dunno man...you sound like the asshole.  If their camp is locked, why not just move on?  Why throw a tantrum and break their toys??
---
Do not blame others for YOU (general you) being an asshole. That's my entire point that you have clearly decided to miss. If you help to fuck up a game, and are part of the reason, YOU are to blame for that asshole behavior. Not someone else. Accept responsibility for what YOU do. If you dupe, you're an asshole. And it is your fault. I'm not the one who can't seem to comprehend that. Don't be a dumbass, yourself.
---
I can agree with that. Some of my other friends have og Xbox and they perform better than mine in the silos. I only have issues in the silo. Above ground everything is fine. Except last night when I got my first explosive shotgun and accidentally killed myself and went to collect my loot and my game crashed and I lost 53 stable Cobalt flux.
---
I had a buddy I was playing with have a similar issue a couple weeks ago on PS4.  He couldn't build the left leg even though he had the materials.  I had to build the left leg for him so he could go complete the miner miracles quest.  I don't know if he still has the issue or not.
---
I mean if there were lootable items. Yea I would lock my doors to deny access, but like your denying people to work benches and a bed.
---
Thank you. I will definitely take your advice. 
---
.50 Cal is not standard issue, Knight. Grab a gatling laser and cry yourself to sleep like the rest of the Brotherhood in 76 since it does like 3 damage.
---
How does fireproof effect explosive weapons?
---
Wow, that's an awesome community! Never heard of the game but sounds like some good people are involved
---
A point worth nothing is if you die, and don't respawn, griefers can keep shooting at your dead body and power armor parts keep on breaking.
---
Yeah I got 2 Calmex off one along with 2-3 other buffs I was like... WTF this guy was a tweaker in his former life or something.
---
No. They would have been dead.
---
I hope not, we don't need that stuff on the loot table.
---
Sir yes sir
---
My CAMP is owned by someone who has higher expectations of fellow vault dwellers. A mongrel hound can some how open a door. They can't (usually) open a locked door. They also can't jump up one story to get in the unlocked door at the top. If that same vault dweller is suffering from a massive case of stupidity and nukes it because they were thwarted by jumping.... it makes for a great story with little inconvenience on my end. ;)
---
Durability is higher and they weigh less
---
I had trouble getting legendaries as I progressed the main game missions. I took a break and acted like eng gamers. I learned to farm at whitespring golf course, and learned a glitch with boss starred enemies means I gotta let them heal up before I fully kill them... Only then did I start to see 2-3 star legendaries drop. Now I've come across TS guns. Just not TSE yet, but I don't farm a ton. I'd rather really play the game. 
---
My camps my rules if I wanna lock my shit up then I can
---
No the chameleon mutation works if you have your weapon out and you’re standing still. Crouched or standing. Now you see where I confused it lol
---
I did the same.  Some poor low level guy opened the one I called in and got dropped by another low level.  Lots of confusion ensued.  It's like Bethesda is pushing us to do more PVP.
---
&gt; A HELPFUL GLITCH-Also, a game glitch i use (sorry Bethesda) When i first started the game, I would encounter unevenly leveled enemies in a location. What i would do is exit the game and come back. Usually the enemies will be different, most of the time easier to beat 
---
You may be describing the spawn being affected by a higher level player being there. Spawn can end up being higher than usual because some level 100 happened to go through the area.
---
By logging out and back in, you land on a different server. One where the lv100 didn't mess with the spawn.
---
That is probably what I'll end up doing, it's nice and pretty out there so I have no issues moving. Thanks again for taking time to help!
---
2 months is a long time for heavy gamers
---
Do you work at Sugar Grove?
---
OK, I will give it another shot.  The large amount of content and relative cheap price was what made it attractive.  But I wish the system itself was a little closer to Skyrim or Fallout.  Any other recommendations for online games besides ESO, considering I greatly enjoyed FO76?
---
I keep my camp locked cause someone went in and destroyed all my workbenches in the past. The last thing I need is someone destroying my generators and decon shower.
---
Pick a new spot. That sounds like a bad one. My current site never gets attacked.
---
This is a LIE. Key point to notice is this guy said his friend gets 5 STAR LEGENDARIES. When 5 star legendary weappns dont even exhist right now. Kids trying to be cool on reddit haha.
---
Have yet to get a good legendary weaponry yet.
---
You're actively failing the Turing test. It's quite remarkable, really.
---
Go ahead and live in the world where every new thing you buy (a game, a burger, a car) is a POS. I'll be over here with all the other jilted consumers, making fun of Bethesda for their epic failure of a launch. Bye now!

The issue is the availability of armor mods and the legendary perks associated with regular armor.   
---
Using mods you can reduce explosive damage drastically with mods like 'dense' or 'cushioned' you can also target specific types of damage an get more defense against both energy and ballistic damage in regular armor with perks than you can with power armor.  
---
The only place where power armor has an advantage really is against radiation, with the exception of the HAZMAT suit which provides absolutely no protection from anything else. The problem is there are practically no weapons that deal a 'sizeable' amount of radiation damage, thus making this defense worthless, and you can still stack up 100+ radiation resist on normal armor, which is more than adequate to deal with the types of radiation damage you find yourself dealing with in high level meta weapons (Since they have no associated perks to up their damage).   
---
This is all before we address legendary effects. With legendary effects which are so far only available on armor, and not power armor, you can spec to get 125 addition rad resistance, or into sentinel where if you're standing still you take practically no damage with perks equipped, or as a bloodied build go all bolstering, giving you an additional 175 ballistic and energy defense, or if you're a run and gunner with tons of AP you can spec to be invulnerable while running (Forgot the perk), or if your high endurance, high resist build, go all vangaurd and be a tank (Until they drtop your health at which point you wither), or use the dragon in combination with the reload buff, and assuming no one is doing radiation damage to you, while reloading your armor rating increases  by an additional 1250, and when you're not reloading you're shooting people for 3,000+ damage if you got a TSE.   
---
Point is it has a TON more options at the disposal of non-power armor players, and they encompass nearly all play styles. Nevermind if you want to be stealthy. I don't know if they are ever going to make it possible to get 3 \* wood armor, but a full set of fully shrouded armor with chameleon, cloaking, unyielding, the harder to detect when sneaking legendary effect, and +1 agility, on a bloodied build, would make you absolutely impossible to detect by NPC's and you'd be moving at normal speed while sneaking with 5 shroud effects and speed demon, and be invisible on the map, and to players, and could operate a nearly impossible to find and kill sniper build that could harass players, camps, workshops, and more with near invulnerability (Unless you do get found, then you just immediately squish, but that's the point behind these builds, don't get spotted).   
---
That said, it's a pain to do Scorched Earth without power armor because it has an invisible anti-radiation buff, so it's still a necessity (No armor builds aren't good enough to compete with armor builds in my experience, but I could be wrong), but shouldn't be your main thing you run around in.
---
Their like the investment bankers of ghouls.
---
That's just stupid all around. People are just going to use it to try to grief other players. Call one in, wait nearby for someone who doesn't know it's been changed, and as soon as they open it hit them with a two shot explosive sniper.
---
Can mobs open the doors? The times I've seen stuff attacking my house they've always just gone for the walls if the door was closed (not locked). 
---
If the door is left open they go inside first and destroy my generators. 
---
I don't see how that's a problem. It makes since. 
---
If there's blood, there's sucking to be had.
---
Well that's makes sense as you need to be higher level to survive there.
---
Have only one what, mutation?
---
I wholly disagree. If you're going to use one you may as well use a bunch to validate the use of perk points in keeping them.
---
I was yes &lt;.&lt; thanks
---
I actually live about an hour away from

[How children live inside cramped immigrant detention centers](https://nypost.com/2018/06/18/how-children-live-inside-cramped-immigration-detention-centers/) 
---
Look like cages to me
---
I’ve heard many people complain about this. I didn’t find the Excavator light too terrible but I don’t think I’ve seen a bright mod for it.
---
So glad I held on to them. 
---
Hell I'm using Bastet right now and I'm only in my 30s. It's pretty strong already. Love it!
---
you can do one a day if 2 hours of quests is too much at once 
---
So my ski sword doesn't get any melee perks I'm using?
---
I thought you actually found a little chicken nugget.
---
Is that unusual...? My only real experience with quasi-MMORPG stuff is Mass Effect 3, and the weekly challenges for that game weren't especially taxing either. They were meant more as semi-interesting carrots to keep you coming back to the game. 
---
Lol *that's* what you're relying on??? That you haven't seen proof of banning?? XD youtubers and streamers have been banned. Some people in this very sub have been banned and came back to complain like the little griefers they are. Seriously. Can't wait.
---
Have you considered only using 1* of each gunner?
---
I haven't frugally adventured since I hit 50 and could super duper craft lol, but that is a good point. 
---
Since the last patch I've seen the option to replace partially damaged things in addition to storing or scrapping them. I haven't used it yet, so I don't know if it costs anything.
---
if people weren't greedy and take ALL of my purified water then I probably would. 
---
Thankyou for posting this, I have build before under one of these but never thought about building one level up! - next build is currently getting planned :)
---
Maybe it means they don’t have a mic?
---
That's not caged. Lol.
---
I've fast traveled home before to find supermutants wrecking everything inside. Several times after having to repair everything, I now lock my door. Nothing personal, I even have a sign outside that says free crops with a cooking station for anyone to use.
---
If you already have max lvl 2+3* armor and weapons, you wont find better there.
---
That said it is good for 2+3 star stuff to fill in missing armor slots, generally up to 3 legendaries mobs + the spawns, so your almost guarenteed one 2*+ piece. I fleshed out my armor between this event and AWOL ARMANENTS @ WestTek on the north side of the Cranberry bog.
---
Im still rocking my lvl 15 antiarmor explosive double barrel i got 120 some levels ago, it out dps's my max lvl aa/e handmade and im a rifle build. So if your not just chasing down your couple max lvl pieces left, its good. Otherwise stick to AWOL ARMANENTS.
---
Doesn't that mean you're not playing how you should be?
---
I don't stress about stuff like that because the entire purpose of this game is to find the next best stuff. Must be all the previous fallout getting us used to hoarding like it isn't a condition xD
---
I started locking the doors to keep out instance spawns. However, I did add a guest house that is unlocked for wanderers. 
---
1. Find the scorched it's controlling and kill them
---
2. scorchbeats lands
---
3. Blast it with whatever
---
4. repeat steps 1-3 until health = 0
---
5. collect your meager reward
---
I'd be fine with it if it contained valuable loot, maybe plans or power cores. But for some water and prewar currency? Nobody wants to fight over that. 
---
What do you want? I can give you any weapon- Xbox 
---
Rather than just outfitting a combat rifle with a .38 receiver? Are they better?
---
I've just left pipe guns in general behind and never looked back so I'm genuinely curious.
---
I've played roughly 200 levels and I've found 5 exploding weapons and exactly 1 TS weapon... a crossbow. My TSE was purchased from the Watoga vendor during a nuke launch but I'd bet it's duped. I think TSE is REALLY rare, TS less rare and exploding uncommon.
---
I feel like flamer ammo is meant to be crafted in quantities of 50 but someone at Bethesda forgot to add a zero
---
I was looking forward to those, good reminder
---
Look like cages to me. Perhaps not the kind of cages you would like them in 
---
You can craft it at a weapon bench. It's how people keep it up to their level, and use it in end-game content.
---
Used to be the diehard fans that made the deep cut content for resources. Now we have "personalities" that see it as their job with a new release, even if they're half invested. 
---
It's not community, it's watching teenagers stand up at the front of speech class trying their best while simultaneously thinking that performance was worth money.
---
I mean, anyone can make anything, do what you want, but shit, might not be your outlet if you can't come up with any content to DESERVE the extra money from a longer video.
---
It feels like these youtubers are stretching tiny bullet points into giant videos. Feels so thin. Annoying because back in school I'd get so into papers or projects I'd have to cut it down content wise so I wouldn't be presenting half the class. 
---
It's so passionless and skin deep. 
---
That’s funny. 
---
Is there a list of which plans are rare?
---
"Up and Adam!" 
---
What do you want? I can give you any weapon on Xbox 
---
What it’s more like someone has spilled something across the table and is in the process of cleaning up while the players  saying “Oh, it’s fine, that’s not going to ruin it”
---
Dang, you got roasted lol
---
I can give you any weapon TSE on Xbox if you want
---
You are doing it wrong then,initiate. Grab yourself a Ultracite Gatling laser and scorch the scorched. 
---
&gt;n inv
---
They don't seem to weight less. I'm seeing weight increases for many weapons with short barrels when compared with their long barrel partners (comparing True short vs True long)
---
I’ve tried that before and they still spam.
---
shepard in flatwoods said he saw zetans the day the nukes dropped. 
---
I’ll see if I have anything below level 45!
---
My buddy calls them Jesse pinkman ghouls
---
I always thought that two shot weapons loses durability way faster, at least is what seems to happen with mine, but it's just what it seems to me, i never tested it.
---
My Gt is "Joe THC" add me. I play weekdays 6pm-11pm CST. and usually all day on the weekends. 
---
&gt; You're a prick in real life you gets off going around telling people how they should deal with situations
---
Says the man that literally went to the internet and posted his tantrum over the fact that he wants Bethesda to respond in a very specific way.
---
Yes, my mother didn't breastfeed me. 
---
Cause she died in childbirth. So I never knew her.
---
Please make a joke about my dead mother. 
---
&gt; (probably to prevent accidental scrapping)
---
You mean like when I'm scrapping a bunch of shit and the selector jumps up to my currently equipped, favorited weapon? &gt;:(
---
They need to just make it so we can "lock" equipment.
---
I'm waiting for private servers where combat is rebalanced to something closer to the FROST / Horizon mods in FO4  before I do this.   
---
Are you doing a purist character as well (no using stuff earned on other chars)?
---
Keep it as is.
---
Shove it down my face. When I'm googling for reference, not just clicking around wondering what you have to say, I CRAVE a youtuber putting just what I need to know in a *logical* order of knowing it. Map point, bam. reqs, bam, path, bam, etc.
---
I bought the game at launch and ended up taking a break waiting for server lags and crashes to get better. I am considering coming back to give the game another shot now. However, I am worried with everyone having duped TSE weapons now, if the game will still be fun for me or not? I guess I might give it shot after I finish my FO4 playthur
---
My game is still crashing even with this new update, it already crash once and I'm just hoping it get better
---
What so hard on doing other weapons. If I can figure it out, while my job aint to figure it, then I am sure that guy who gets paid and have access to test environments, can do this much more efficiently and faster than I ever could.
---
Obviously SMG aint gonna do 1/4 of the damage of SR, with firerate of 5 bullets in second. It was just figurative example to show, how easy it is to balance things, when everything is based on numbers.
---
As soon as I draw my weapon they run away 
---
My favourite part is when they repeatedly scream out of their ass as they fly away from you.
---
Just make sure you keep the rarest of all plans handy; the Single Action Revolver Ivory Grip.  I may have 10 pounds worth of those in my inventory!  ;) 
---
Maybe if they damaged the enemy, it only tickles level 68s.
---
"Duping, duping never changes"
---
I've had them open doors on me while defending workshops, unless I lock them with at least a level 0 lock then it removes their path.
---
Scorched/supermutants, not like mongrels or anything.
---
Dense armor, plus fireproof rank 3, plus adamantium limbs MAY save you. It hasn't been confirmed whether or not it can stack to 100% resistance, or if they cap it. I've seen a lot of people testing at rank 1 and 2 with a dense armor mod, or not using addy limbs, but none using both perks and dense armor that claimed it didn't work.  
---
I know for 'regular' two shot weapons without insane buffs, rank 3 plus dense seems to stop players from damaging themselves when they use their weapons point blank. I have heard some people with TSE Shotguns still don't prevent it. It might be because of some sort of max limitation effect on the damage total? I have no idea, I haven't been able to experiment in depth yet.
---
Looks about right...
---
The gauss is being sold later today, so you can either hold the pump or I can try and hold enough junk to make a handmade
---
Funny but my xb1x has been pretty solid since launch...
---
I wonder how many other players were too busy enjoying a stable game to join the pitchfork rally over stability that I saw on reddit.
---
I swear it's a PC player problem. Bet the outrage is so potent because it's PC players frustrated with their elite PCs running fallout worse than an Xbox haha. Idk why this would be a surprise tho considering how long Bethesda has been developing with the console market in mind (post oblivion money especially)
---
Keep in mind that Reddit users are a tiny fraction of the player base. Also, as with all product reviews, people tend to only speak up when they are very angry or very happy and some of the people speaking up have neither purchased nor played the game. It’s hard to get a read on how people actually feel. The people who are just happily playing along a few hours a week with their sub-100 level character, grumbling about the occasional bug but still having enough fun to not quit, probably don’t care at all (or likely don’t even know) what people on Reddit are saying.
---
Get downvoted for liking the game? typical....
---
FWIW I've seen the blade at the whitesprings vendor. Maybe he sometimes has the voice? Or someone does? 
---
Otherwise make a new character and do the storyline again lol
---
Tehe...I go around one-hit killing everything with my melee build and it is still a lot of fun.
---
One variable spawn is in the box in the tent right next to where the brotherhood fatigues can spawn at Thunder Mountain.   
---
It can spawn at the ranger station in the bog also on the shelf in the shed or in the vet area.   
---
Then you can also chance it getting it from technical data. 
---
my turrets attacked each other one day
---
Dam - This sucks dude. Sorry for that! 
---
My stealth alt is doing the same. Especially since the FC recharge thing is Kaput! Lolz
---
I'm having odd loading screen issues. When ever I go somewhere or enter a building I get the usual loading screen. After it ends the interior or location I'm at flashes quickly then goes back to the loading screen for a few seconds. It's almost like the server's keep saying, " oh wait, I forgot something."
---
Not a single Youtuber or Streamer has been banned for duplicating items. Hey, I know that you are trying to make yourself feel better; I'm sorry to ruin your delusion.
---
FYI your collision box doesn't change in size when you crouch. Visibly your character is crouching, but if you can't fit through the space while standing, you won't fit through it while crouching.
---
Nice try sparky.  Welcome to block.
---
Any 3* bats? Or a TSE .44?
---
Ok i found the solution! In the Power Armor stand you can't recycle objects to obtain raw materials. Recycle elsewhere and then go back to the stand
---
I agree with your conclusion. The game shines in a few spots but mostly it’s just a drag to play and rarely ever has those “OMG that was awesome” moments. I really like building stuff in the camp so I have rather enjoyed exploring places to load up on junk and farming caps to spend on plans. The SBQ is fun to fight the first few times but that gets old pretty quick. 
---
If someone non-specced pulls out a TSE, throw on Fireproof rank 3, and hopefully you have a dense mod on your armor.
---
Laugh in their face as their non specced for damage boost low accuracy gun does nothing as the spheres of explosions do absolutely nothing to you.
---
Don't worry, basement dweller **coff coff** RAIDER. I know you didn't mean to be mean to me. I don't need to make myself feel better, thankfully I understand it's just a game. 
---
Fusion Generator
---
On concrete floor: NOOOO!
---
On roof to the side: AWW HELL YEAH THATS MA SHIT!
---
Now I want to play as a mole miner's daughter. Shotgunner/gauntlet build. I'll keep my mic open and just grunt at people.
---
It took a lot of searching, but I have found a great spot and to my knowledge nothing has messed with it in the several weeks I've been there. I don't even have turrets!! 
---
You can only get to my CAMP safely by fast travel (meaning only I can get to it safely), otherwise you will seriously injure yourself trying to get to it. That's on the slim chance anyone ever actually sees it, as you have to basically be on top of it for it to show up on screen. Keeps the puds away. Additionally, no creatures spawn near it, nor can they get to it save for perhaps a scorchbeast. There are no SB spawn points nearby, so I think I'm good there. 
---
Now that I've jinxed myself, I'll be checking on it when I get home.......
---
Game has felt good since release on xbx1x for me. Moving has never been laggy for me. And I'm sure countless others who were to busy playing to complain. 
---
Just offering additional perspective for any lurkers. Not invalidating your experience.
---
Just remember this or the other game are just a small portion of the player base heck i wouldn't be surprised if some of the  people commenting don't even play the game. I agree with you the last thing this place needs is to become a counter jerk to the circle jerk that is the other sub. We should be able to post our opinions an have an open discussion.
---
Emotes don't make people play the way you want them to.
---
I never bothered trying the duped laser weapons, I'm sure they're gonna be somewhat more useful than the base but still pitiful next to ballistic
---
I usually play weekends and a few times during the week. I’m a level 105 tho. Anyways if you ever feel like teaming up send me a request slangin_doez
---
For me that's my bearskin rug
---
The converted ammo receivers are less powerful as there are no hardened variants for them yet. It's weird because a hardened .308 is better than a .50 receiver for hunting rifles.
---
Not to mention licensed plumber(90% slower durability loss and cheaper repair for pipe weapons) combined with gunsmith, you almost never have to repair it. 
---
Crashed 4 times in my 1 hour of play.  Done with this game. I'll stick around the community tho and monitor the changes. Def wishing I would've pre ordered Anthem instead of this hot trash
---
I have 500+ screws just from farming Whitesprings and killing the Wendigo repeatedly. 
---
Yes this lol sorry just got the notification.
---
I have two explosive revolvers, and a twoshot pipe pistol, but no twoshot explosives. 
---
I have one if you want it? I'm on xbox
---
Basically some plans are very hard to acquire, so buying mods can be a more reliable option to mod your stuff the way you want. I buy some when I see them ( compulsive buyer here). I think you still need the associated perk to use them tough, which is again a really strange / stupid design. I hope I explained the matter well enough. 
---
Lol. I only want criminals in cages. Not based on race 
---
Bring back the rocket-jump!
---
This is like trying to find extra storage space on your hard drive. You KNOW you have a big hard drive, but something is eating up 95% of it. You have to explore all the different folders and narrow it down to find out what's giving you a headache, and then you find that some stupid app that you never really cared about is eating up a ton of space. I'm looking at you, missiles.
---
We need a Fallout "Space Monger" to parse our inventory and tell us what is giving us grief.
---
I’m beginning to think you’re right!
---
if only this game was set in Florida
---
Not gonna spoil it but There’s BDSM gear in ash heap lolz
---
I just need to find the neon lights plans. Lol
---
Well that was it then probably. Kind of bitch because I fell in there from one of those wooden scaffolds around the elevator but there was no way to jump back over there.
---
Anything is possible in this simulation. 
---
Tagging is critical, but once you have many things tagged it can be difficult to focus on one or two you need MORE than the other tagged ones. So knowing the actual items is helpful in that way.
---
You are the good guy in this story, right? lol
---
Ah, I'm guessing a ridiculously high endurance build so that being under 25% doesn't get you killed?
---
I see. I’ve been trying to find evidence of the recipe’s existence, but haven’t found anything.
---
It seems something might have been broken during a patch intended to fix things. My surprise is overwhelming.
---
First of all, I’ve never duped. Because you’re making a lot of assumptions and I’m getting quite tired of seeing how foolish you are. 
---
Secondly, you’re terrible at reading. Lemme say this slowly for you, 
---
People. Will. Always. Cheat. And. Exploit. 
---
From. The. Perspective. Of. Bethesda. It’s. Their. Fault. It’s. Their. Game. 
---
It’s obviously the players fault you idiot. Take a little time to think before you open your mouth.
---
Here’s a easy example that your brain my understand: 
---
If I was a shop owner and I left the key unlocked to my shop, is it my fault for someone robbing the place  that night or the person who actually robbed it? 
---
People are always going to be this way, now stop being an naive idiot. And I’m 100% sure you bought a duped item because of how naive you are lol 
---
Long winded way to say ' build a portable Pulowski FO shelter'. I hate YT'ers who milk 30 second vids into 7 min+ ordeals.
---
Anyone else see mxmodr stuff? Lolz 
---
I posted earlier today trying to get some people together for just this. We are on Xbox...what's your platform? We are looking to be a casual group and most have limited play time, so def not grinding or anything like that, just light RP and enjoying the game! Let me know if you want in! I have a group chat with the first few people to coordinate schedules
---
Bethesda does not seem to say anything, now that the game is launched.  Other than a vague weekly “things are coming” message.
---
On that note where is the General Atomics Plant, can't find any info on it ?
---
Nope. In fact with the right mod it can add an effect on some weapons.
---
This is ridiculous. I have 61.69GB free but cannot install the update. I don't have anything left to delete, I only have 6 games installed but all are 50+GB.
---
Is someone a bit... triggered?
---
I’ll take the handmade with some mods on it
---
Well you’re right!!
---
I’m not trying to get anyone to play in a certain way. This person offered a trade so they were obviously in need of things, I just wanted to give them some freebies 
---
Yes n.n you. I can see it bc you started downvoting my comments LOL
---
I was going to be much more insulting, but this.
---
You go into the modify option in build mode. Select the object you want to lock and you should see the option.  It is only available for doors, containers and resources (like water purifiers and junk extractors).
---
If someone damages your camp or picks the lock they become wanted.
---
At this time there's no displaying junk unfortunately. 
---
I didn’t even know that recipe existed. Gives me hope of finding the noodle cup recipe. I’m just not sure if it exists of it is just a prewar consumable.
---
Right. Sorry to tell you, but... that's not me.
---
Another undocumented patch change.
---
Serrated switchblade is oddly satisfying.
---
What does that have to do with not playing the game for under 2 months?
---
https://youtu.be/lRqqL00zYJ0
---
It's ok. You are forgiven. Such a grown-up learning how to say sorry. Now you just need to learn how not to cheat in games and you're a big boy!
---
Yeah literally whatever you want
---
Now add to the catalogue where / how you get the plans.
---
You need the armored rank 3 perk to craft it, that’s what the lock icon is saying.
---
Are you planning to use it?
---
Was this Xbox? I didn't participate but saw an LFG post asking for attendees to a wedding. Don't remember where it was though. This was yesterday.
---
It's a little late to respec a heavy guns build into a sniper or shotgun build.
---
I wanna at least try it out 
---
That's all well and good, but gets really boring after 5+ minutes of them non-stop screeching. (I'm not exaggerating.)
---
There is a lock icon on armorer rank 3.  So I am thinking you do not have rank three card equipped?
---
Had enough Atoms safed up to by the Nuka Quantum light. It was exactly what I needed. I thought about buying the Old Possum sign before. Im glad I waited.
---
What can I say. If the game allows it, it's fair game!
---
Games are supposed to be fun, right? 
---
There was not a single other enemy I could find last time I encountered a scorchbeast.
---
Seemed to very much be alone.
---
I don't believe so. There are a couple of youtube videos on it.
---
Armorer rank 3.
---
I see a lock in the bottom there underneath the part you have circled in red, my guess if (if you do have that perk), you don't have it equipped.
---
Just a guess.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the info! 
---
Drug dealer ghouls
---
I don't have many mods since they're hard to come by, the best I can really do for you is a muzzle brake and a hardened receiver
---

What part of "general you" don't you understand? For someone who can't seem to comprehend what I'm saying, you sure are throwing "dumbass" and "idiot" around a whole lot. So let me make this as simple and straight forward as I possibly can. *Other people are not to blame for someone else being an asshole.*
---
The shop owner is not to blame for the other person being a robber. The robber is a robber. Not the shop owner. Will the shop owner go to jail? No. The robber will.  
---
The collapsable nuke shelter is a pretty awesome idea. I’d love that. Ty for sharing the link!
---
Updates are 1 a week as in that's when they do press releases.
---
Next is late Jan. Probably next week
---
Still good, between fix it good and power smith you'll do well.
---
Sure thing, you may pay more in caps for fast travel but it's worth it I think. Be sure to take the perk in Charisma for reduced fast travel costs.
---
And if you have it, it has to be equipped. Hopefully they make these cards passive at some point, because it's not like you forget how to make a sandwich when you don't have your sandwich card equipped in real life. 
---
At least you got to loot yours. I killed the Queen the other day and the body despawned almost instantly.
---
The only thing I can think of is do you have the armored perk on?
---
But then you can be John Wick
---
How badly does it effect your AP?
---
I'd totally RP as apocalyptic John Wick. 
---
Good luck not scrapping them by accident.
---
I got my first Ultracite Gatling Laser (not the plan, just the item) from a scorchbeast, too. Since then I've had to get players to make them for me. They all say they got the plan from Line In The Sand but..... ffs I've run that quest so many times it isn't even funny.
---
I've also tried murdering every scorchbeast in the bog and I think I left with Prime Gauss Capacitors, Prime Double Barreled Shotgun Receiver, etc, on top of the random crap they drop like Lead Lined Trapper Chest or whatever.
---
In the lore if you read and listen to stuff, survival tactics include hiding in bunkers, small enclosed spaces and poking at them with sticks or shooting their faces as they try and bite you, etc.
---
The reason this is important is because like the lore states, Sierra Bravos dont de-aggro on you like other creatures do, they will track you for a long time even if you lose them.
---
I was in the Watoga High School yesterday just looking for scrap, but there was an event going on where you put on a mask that attracts ghouls. I swear 90% of those ghouls were "jackpot ghouls", dropping caps and multiple chems. It was awesome. Until the second round, where higher level ghouls swarmed me, and I nearly died. Made a decent amount of caps.
---
that is actually for replacing variants of different things, so if you have a wall you can 'replace' it with a wall of a different type (material or adding a window, etc...) i tested that and it does not repair the walls condition.
---
Yeah, you're right.
---
But when someone says "Duping causes server instability" they're not saying "Duping causes ALL server instability."
---
So when someone says "Duping causes server instability" and you respond "no servers are just unstable all these other things cause instability!" you not only look like you're defending duping, you *are* defending duping.
---
Im not sure if its a new glitch with the AI, but im noticing a large majority of 1* legendary super mutants are automatically in retreat mode and do not fire at all
---
Maybe zetans dropped the nukes
---
Does it look a bunch different from the one already in-game? I haven’t seen the one in-game but have heard about it.
---
Doesn't the keycard get used up even if you use the wrong code?
---
How do you farm the keycards?
---
It’s pretty negligible, especially considering you don’t really is AP in this build except for running.  
---
I’m finished wasting my energy on your incompetence. Superficial thinker 🙄
---
No pictures ?????
---
I don't think the people you grief are having fun, but who am I to say, right? Enjoy your experience, I guess. I used to RP and I guess it's more fun when people actually want to RP with you.  But I have friends, I don't need to force people. Still, have fun. Now let us stop talking, I'm bored.
---
My petclaw takes care of all the attackers. In the savage divide it's usually one or two lvl 20 molerat,muties or scorched. The screen shakes like crazy when it roars and it's all over by the time i go check.
---
Less scorched for the love of god.
---
Pacifist stops YOU from damaging other players, not the other way around. Very useful for when white Springs gets nuked or joining into killing the SB Queen...
---
HATERS SHOOTING THEMSELVES WITH REAL GUNS.  
---
**not sorry for caps lock**
---
Hey what if its all a lie. The shutdown of life support, the emptying of the vault, all of that. The Overseer convinced 24 schmucks to leave the vault with her so it wouldnt be over populated. While we are all fighting and dying in the wasteland, 475 other dwellers are safe and cushy back in the vault, probably watching us through hidden cameras in the vault suit or PIP Boys or something!
---
We arent the best and brightest of the vault, we are the dumbest and most gullible!
---
Well that’s the main issue I’m having — Farming is incredibly boring. You miss out on so much of the game just hopping servers when you clear an area. 
---
I guess I just need to find the balance. 
---
If anyone in the future sees this, I ended up just paying full price for the game after getting ripped off from G2A. They sent me an obviously fake code. I'm contesting that on PayPal now.
---
I bought an Australian key and had a VPN rigged up, but thanks to the key being fake, I was unable to verify if I could activate it or not.
---
I dont care as long as theres no turrets pointed at tbe clubhouse, if ther is im destroying it
---
Sounds like my ex too
---
All of his videos are quite long. I like some of his fallout 4 building videos, but yeah, it gets tiresome listening to him ramble on. 
---
Relogging fixes that
---
Who do you think is griefing all the lower-level players?
---
Also makes sense with the tinfoil hat I found...
---
Short barrels have much lower vats cost you can test it
---
I got even faster no bs guide: excavator power armor will multiply mined ore with 4 -&gt; Then smelt it down with Super Duper -&gt; Now you craft ammo with Ammo Crafter and Super Duper...boom...profit. 
---
...And why would you farm super mutants in high level zones first place, when you can also farm them in low level zones, like the Forest.
---
I agree. It's a duper's one shot paradise out there and the wanted system just makes it worse. 
---
I'll keep that in mind.
---
I'd like the ability to put stuff on shelves. Like all my toasters that I've ~~stolen~~ collected. 
---
My mic wasn't on but I had a few choice words...
---
Try relogging maybe?
---
I have a the Stone Benches and can provide a picture if you would like. There are 2 benches, a small rectangular one, and a larger curved one.
---
We weren't always conditioned that way.  Once upon a time, people could read.  His video has a title.  That's enough.  If they're too thick to spend half a second reading the title of a video, too bad.  The rest of us shouldn't have to sit through the remedial content.
---
(Disclaimer:  I'm on my 9th straight day of working and I'm a little irritable.  Don't take it personally.)
---
Directly east of Morgantown. Past the kitty house are three cabins. One has super mutants, but the other two are easy to set up in, defend, and maintain.
---
Replying to come back earlier, thanks for the help.
---
Yesterday i did an event near flatwoods, got a lv20 combat shotgun and saw that a lv20 was near me, ran to him (probably scared the shit out of him) and traded but he didnt know what i wanted probably, dropped it front of him and flashed my pipboy light to it, he was really happy :)
---
I saw one of these using its endless echo attack on a bunch of those robot spawning locations in Watoga.  It was like the irresistible force vs. immovable object debate where it couldn't stop killing robots and the robots couldn't stop spawning right into it.  I bet that server is still out there somewhere with the fight still going on.
---
Because all the raiders were infected with the scorched plague and became scorched. 
---
Where the hell is Black Mountain ordinance works??? 
---
The random aid items that spawn in it (boiled water, dog food) are instanced to you, but anything put inside the box by a player is available for anyone to pick up.
---
This applies to pretty much every container in the world: suitcases, mailboxes, cash registers, etc. I use this all the time to trade with friends or give stuff away because the trade window is a PITA and I don't trust dropping stuff on the ground.
---
Oh. I just never been attacked when im in pacifist mode
---
I would be ok with this :) 
---
Farming Whitespring is just fun.  Hacking through 40-50 ghouls is pure entertaiment, nevermind the loot.
---
 In a while
---
I've been wondering too. If we found this it would be key to finding where the nuke hit
---
Fast vampiric bladed ski sword.
---
You are correct. They apparently give fiberglass, not plastic.
---
Yeah man, my mom just tells me to put the volume down :(
---
Once I found an entire family playing through the story together, actually happened across the son/daughter when they were playing alone but later looked at the map and 5-6 people were at the Asylum and three of them had the same name as the guy I ran into earlier but with dashes like "noobslayer, noobslayer-mom, noobslayer-dad..." Etc. Was really cool to see them move along on the map. I know it's weird but I periodically looked for them and could see them go to Camp McLintock and even saw them heading towards Watoga
---
You did, thank you!
---
the bandaid didn't allow you to hold 300 weapons so it was basically a fix
---
You mean gift it!
---
Treasure maps give some good stuff, legendary supermutants at Westek research and Watoga emergency services drop good stuff.  Ive started to go to all the places I've stopped going to because i had already been there.  What you find when your just out for a stroll.   Im 200+hrs lvl 84 and im still finding things i hadn't discovered 
---
He gives you a buff at the end, yeah. Check your pip boy effects next time.
---
boi that is the dumbest excuse ever xD
---
I take laughs and emotes in payment.
---
Ghetting under the map to get advantage is cheating
---
i bought some poses because i was tired of seeing the same 3 on my loading snapshots. also that glow in the dark green map for the wall was too glowy and green to pass up
---
Yeah but the recipe requires one of the blades to “upgrade”. Or at least it did when I checked it last. 
---
Eg going from a level 25 blade to a level 50 blade will use up that level 25 copy. 
---
Holy crap... that's awesome!!!
---
or might just be chinese players. In several online games you can notice players with names with only numbers and most of the case they are players from China because:
---
" Numbers in Chinese tend to be homophones with "actual" words, thus a string of numbers actually represents a phrase or something. "
---
Make sure you store all junk then try again. I was having this issue this weekend on PC.
---
This is why my shotgun build has a strong melee back up option. If I'm low on rounds I just clear out Blackwater Mine and/or Welch using melee, and I usually end up accumulating a couple hundred rounds from the mole miners. 
---
If I'm still low I'll make a run through the high schools and gather plastic, but it's usually not necessary.
---
I found that happened the first time I built there, certainly 0_0
---
I doubt that is true, loads of people prefer the company of others. I am a solo player and some people showed up at my camp and never left. Now I join parties which is very unusual for me, it is kind of fun, but I still enjoy exploring on my own. Probably more because I can play on my own schedule and not have to worry about meeting up and/or I am encumbered all the time, so I can't move quickly across the map.
---
I am sure you will find a good group of individuals.
---
Oh i do see the logic behind the current system too. It just feels more of a unnecessary nuisance, as being really useful.  
---
You switch to every perk you need in that moment anyway, so why not have it active all the time?  
---
That is why i said before. If they feel like otherwise people get too overpowered, they should make at least normal perks like lockpicking and stuff passive or chems for production. Since you only quickly activate them to open that door and then swap it out again.  
---
All it does add is another layer of unnecessary frustration at times.
---
I almost ripped a wind chime off a porch for that sweet aluminum 
---
I'm not a very high level, only 59, but I play every day. Feel free to add me: celeste_strange
---
Oh.. I better hold onto mine then.
---
Don’t take the brown Mentants man
---
Or the Brotherhood recon rifle ;)
---
The one where you uninstall and stop making shitty vids. Your voice makes me want to throat punch you.
---
They didn't http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Telephone_(Fallout_4)
---
But I think the other parts were more needed in FO4 so they were worth picking up in that game. I know I grabbed them whenever I saw one.
---
Ok, that tickled my dark humor bone, just please send all serious cases my way.
---
I do this all the time. I sucks waiting for people to come fight. Clear it. Find people on map then Restart it lol
---
I can't wait for a solid legendary hunting rifle since they came out today on console!
---
Oh yes definitely don’t sell it for 9 caps like i did. 
---
Nope, tried that already 
---
Crocodile
---
My life
---
Nope tired that 
---
Some of the spreadsheets people post indicate it does exist, but no idea where you can get it.
---
Ok see you later
---
Toxic Redditors like you are ruining this sub
---
I can’t find a TSE. The only legendaries I’ve found were armour, and not good armour 
---
someone else said same thing and as I explained its because he was a duo one was wanted one wasn't the non wanted member was informing the wanted one of enemies approaching and where people were thus the hiding part 
---
Are the powered gates and powered gates with keypad two separate plans?  And is it true they can only be found on the wandering supermutant?
---
You don’t even know my channel lol
---
And a single turret takes up a big chunk of budget. 
---
Haha I feel that.  I dunno I just feel that this game could definitely benefit from cross platform
---
So I'm level 40 and don't have a complete set of PA yet.  But for some reason, everytime I hit a PA location I only find empty frames.  Am I boned, or doing something wrong?  I just want a full set, even if it's just raider level :/
---
Can confirm this worked!
---
I managed to find a 2 shot gatling and sold it for 5k back when caps meant something. Haven't found shit since tho
---
The scorched didn’t just wander into those raider encampments. They were the original tenants. We’ve been fighting raiders since the beginning. They’re just more crispy than we’re used to seeing.
---
Toxic for supporting my country's leader? Weird logic but ok.
---
Quality in-depth meaningful content without clickbait
---
Don't worry, 99% of the people who have them didn't find them either.
---
Snapping turtle!
---
*damnit alex, you fucked up again!*
---
Downvoted for opinions, wow.
---
Vault-Tech beds are pure scam
---
You are being very salty towards ark, for no good reason. That's what pvp servers in ark are for, to pvp. If you want to build calmly etc. then join pve servers. Why should Wildcard take responsibility for someone being killed in a pvp server?
---
I haven't ran into any griefers in fallout myself, but from what I have read here, it is much easier for a low level to kill a high level here, than it is in a game like Ark for example.
---
This being Reddit, I should’ve expected the negative comments to come out right away. Not that I disagree with your observation of long winded YouTube videos, they can really get annoying. However, my point was, that we need a way to “pause” the game for situations that was discussed in the video. I wish Bethesda would implement something that would let us “pause” FO76 for at least a moment or two. 
---
I don't think so, but if someone can prove me wrong, I'd be stoked to see a video of that.
---
I just moved my base to a place I found that only ragstag spawn and put my base against a large wall so only the front can get attacked and its built up on a bridge so while I can get up and down the enemies ai doesn't understand
---
Yup this another of aceplaysssss garbage alts 😗
---
I dont see the paints... just the outfit :/
---
It literally tells you the amount of AP it uses to provide the resistance.  It gives you an exact number than never changes, per damage occurrence.
---
Literally reading the card's text in four seconds would've answered this question.
---
Not sure why this issue occurs and it definitely doesnt happen every time. I think it may in part have to do with having items tagged for search but idk.
---
Aceplayssss not me
---
i got 1\* two shot handmade i wanted to give to a guy today.. but he didnt show up .. if you want i will trade with you on PC
---
Paint plan is ontop an over turned wheeled basket near the middle of the room. Try server hopping if it is not there, as someone may have beaten you to it.
---
yeah but defenses and such will not be in atom shop as only decorations will be in there if I can buy a defense weapon in there it would something other then costumes 
---
also I understand that eventually more things will be added but I'd love to see some more skins and paint jobs added for weapons and armor that weren't goofy is all like maybe some reskins of excavator armors and such 
---
You sure he didn't ask you to do anything before disappearing?
---
I do that with all sorts of things. Makes life more interesting. 😉
---
I love it ! Looks so comfy 😍 also we have matching coats 😊
---
"Submit a ticket" then wait 5 days for the reply asking for confirmation the issue is resolved.
---
Until I see evidence to the contrary, I'm gonna go with "you're full of shit" for 1200 Mr. Trebek.
---
you can actually use the fact you can only place down so many to use the fact the other one explodes as a  remote detonator when they walk was it toss down another and boom 
---
Can you buy key cards in the white spring bunker from modius? 
---
Even though the in game transactions are just cosmetic, but whatever
---
They didn't seem to add any of the lesser-used guns which didn't get a legendary version
---
Consider yourself lucky, it took me 43 technical data to get my first one. 
---
"/s" would save you sooo many downvotes... just sayin
---
I’m fine with that
---
I've found the indivudal mod several times but never the plans. All of the dense torso plans are stupid rare.
---
I should be on around that time as well, ill add you ill be BirdJP19, just let me know whenever as well either on here or if im online!
---
My current bottle neck... Acid! Smh 
---
Our game? Last I checked I was part of the player base. Anyway, I never said anything about politics, I just said I wanted an American Patriotic hat which is no more political than an American Flag.
---
Pack rat? That means you'll be walking around with a lot of junk... Looks like someone I'd enjoy jumping in front of when shooting in order to force a duel...
---
Its like 3 hours ingame time for it to be cleared. 
---
A 50 minute vid blaming dupers for how bad fallout 76 is.
---
Guaranteed bethesda/reddit sponsoring. ;)
---
Nice try Preston, nice try...no more settlements need my help!!!!!
---
I hear consoles got it bad, but really, less than one frame a second? this is the kind of fucking framerate that consoles were pushing?
---
That is the *very* definition of unplayable. I'll never understand how Beth' got away with releasing a game in such a state.
---
I believe we should expect an "inside the vault" or whatever its called tomorrow, right?
---
It's also tiny aoe, low damage, and slow cycle.
---
Tried a 4 gun battery on blackwater mole man group (lev 30ish).  Killed one, wounded a couple others.  Roughly 10 sec cycle per gun, so took several minutes to see how bad it failed.  :(
---
Aight, since it's not that pricey to make handmades that'll be about 200 caps
---
It's stupid cause if I have any junk it will freeze but no junk I'm fine 
---
Launching a nuke solo is laughably easy. To be honest, it's probably harder in a group.
---
It's the SBQ fight afterwards that's the real challenge.
---
That's how they get you to break out the CC.
---
You do realize you posted this reddit post with a link to your account on youtube, as aceplayssss right?

If it's Preson...........
---
Kill it, kill it with FIRE.  After he's dead, throw in a couple of mini nukes just to be sure, then salt the earth, dump some rad barrels on the spot, and lure some deathclaws to guard his final resting place.
---
I have a settlement that needs help.........does not belong in Fallout 76 :)
---
I have 6 in my camp on the golf course.  If they were more responsive and fired quicker they'd be better.
---
I am an absolute horde 
---
There is a really simple answer, if you dont like it, dont play it. No need to come here and tell everyone that they are too stupid to realize that they can't possibly be having fun and enjoying the game because the game is so broken... I've got well north of 300 hours in and I can't get enough. I'd have a lot more in except I have to work IRL. Yes, it has issues and BSD is working to fix those but it works well ENOUGH for me to be having a blast playing it. I've played every single Fallout, with the exception of Fallout shelter, and I'm absolutely hooked on FO76. I don't really care whether someone calls me a fanboy or not, what I care about is how distracting and how much fun I have.  That's the bottom line for me.
---
&gt;I swear it's a PC player problem. Bet the outrage is so potent because it's PC players frustrated with their elite PCs running fallout worse than an Xbox haha. Idk why this would be a surprise tho considering how long Bethesda has been developing with the console market in mind (post oblivion money especially)
---
I usually always play Fallout titles on my Xbox because I enjoy the vanilla experience just fine and like to do the controller/couch thing. This was the first time I've refunded a game on xbox due to performance issues (was launch week though). So while no doubt the optimization updates have greatly helped things, there definitely was performance issues on the Xbox One X at launch. 
---
Likely you aren't used to playing games above 30fps or the occasional 60 fps so it wasn't a big deal for you. But I absolutely couldn't enjoy this game on my preferred console at launch. 
---
I can do that, but since you can make them can’t you scrap a bunch of them to get mods?
---
No, bc bethesda would have to write dialogues and that's too much trouble gor them.
---
Mothership Zeta from wayyy back when has a Vault Tec guy kidnapped. Says they were asking specifically about 76. He was willing to share information with them.
---
Totes involved. Not just with Vault-Tec, but likely us.
---
Is there a bug catchers subreddit xD
---
No Tattered Field Jacket = no money sorry todd
---
Had this issue as well. Fixed the angry turret by storing it, and then replacing it.
---
Ive ran into this. Seems like if you have just enough of one material it won't let you craft/repair until you have more than just enough. I remember a similar bug/feature in FO4.
---
Hmm, thanks for the info. It's regardless of the amount?
---
A shorter barrel on a ballistic firearm needs to be thicker to withstand the initial blast from the round. /s (it makes no sense)
---
If I could completely start from scratch and design a perk system:  Passive perks, for crafting, lockpicking, etc, are discoverable magazines that permanently apply the perk.  You find the mag, read it, lock pick goes up by one, you get Super Duper, etc.
---
Well I think you're cute
---
I wouldve taken a screenshot but I literally had no chance to set up since I approached halfway and the smoke animation happened
---
11* 
---
Super Duper only doubles the base amount for some reason :( 
---
They plan to open more vaults 
---
what you can build electric chairs
---
Yup, I did the same thinking it was just quest junk. Didn't know it could be upgraded.
---
Regret.
---
Seems to be the same animatronic aliens from Nuka World. Lack of wounds and "frozen" expression seem to verify this, however, curious how one ended up in the back of a random truck. Maybe they're not totally uncommon at entertainment venues
---
"Yo if this actually gets in a video - erm erm my yt AcePlaysssS (do a fanboy a favour please) :D"
---
Dont go too hard on him, if you be seen any of his videos you already know hes mentally handicapped
---
I have picked up tons of trash legendaries. Almost all of it armor. Whitesprings is actually a terrible spot. It is almost all 1* garbage. 
---
Nearly all of my decent weapons I recieved from events, I did score a 3* TSE gatling laser off a vendor, but thats hardly useful. Great for farming mats off watoga bots.
---
I found my TSE combat shotgun off One Violent Night event. 
---
I got my TSE minigun off Line in the Sand.
---
I have gotten several Gatlings from Dropped Connection and Bots on Parade. 
---
The Legendary "system" is not very rewarding. It's the pinnacle of negative reinforcement actually. Lots of disappointment coupled with a handful of things you might actually use.
---
Personally I would scrap the current system and make the legendary effects drop as mods for weapons and gear. Give the players some control, instead of the gatcha game it has become.
---
I mean, the first time I got the quest it ate all 55 of mine I had been carrying for one quest item of it...
---
I looked up 'Preston' because I had no idea what you were referring to. From what i can compare, it looks very familiar to the perseon youre referring to
---
I think it's supposed to be like that! Honestly, as annoying as it is, it makes sense how they completely decimated all the faction groups. Not only can they spam that attach and negate melee attackers, but also infect people too.
---
They're difficult. They're annoying. And they're annoyingly difficult. But it makes sense.
---
I'm also just not used to finding something in a Fallout game that can beat the shit outta me
---
lol
---
yeah I know a sniper who is a specialist in sneak and has a instigating rifle and all the sneak perks and he basically can head shot most normal things with a single shot 
---
we were fighting a lvl 90 glowing death claw and he clean a good 70% or more hp off with his first 2 shots and my grenades took out the rest before our poor melee guy could even close the distance 
---
It's thinner then a short barrel that's why
---
I’m gonna have to ask you to move that camp, or it’ll be nuked, no offence I just hate people placing turret and artillery bases at the golf course and letting it sit there and tag everything
---
I'm mostly saving, because not much has caught my eye. I got the blackbird paint, the glow in the dark map, and a few poses, but that's it.
---
Opossums need love
---
If it helps, too, the combat gets really fluid the better you get. A lot of endgame dps comes from animation canceling to chain different attacks together
---
Try rotating your camp module.  If memory serves it spawns you at some angle off it reliably.  I think it's looking right at front on edge of green zone.
---
Thank you!  Glad it’s useful
---
Yeah that the paradox w/pacifist you’re so concerned about not hurting others that they can easily hurt you
---
I was only able to approach halfway (He was at about my horizon line) when he threw some smoke grenade and vanished.
---
If you see a spaceman looking at you sleeping...that is my bf.
---
Oh dang, really? I've been thinking I was making x42 .45 bullets this entire time. 
---
God I hope not. Better have been banned way back when reddit did image curating.
---
100% sure it exists in a private sub though. Just such a disgusting idea.
---
Definitely. Even if it was crafted by 50 I wouldn't use it. 
---
Yeah, the bright light headlamp mod is now overkill and kind of useless.
---
Sounds good! Looking forward to farming my millionth damn ultracite explosive vent plan lol
---
Because it displays account name rather than characters name.  This shouldn't be the case unless it's someone on your friends list in my opinion.
---
Send all nukes there immediately.
---
I had no idea who he was but one quick look at his history pretty much put that lie to bed.  I just wish he had been honest about it, why lie, that's a real sad move.
---
I don't really even care about the weight, the problem is when you "weigh" up the pros and cons of short vs long, short is basically pointless.
---
It weighs more, has reduced accuracy, has reduced range and is just 100% negative.
---
There's no selling point for a short barrel.
---
The atom shop is drowning in wacky shite, and there seems no let-up scheduled, so yeah. 
---
The only work around I've found is to move the entire CAMP basically, somebody may know more but that is all that's ever worked for me. 
---
Nice!  I’ll add an Aid section next
---
Ahh okay. I don't know the differences of console play. 
---
I hit 50 yesterday. Decided to strap on my power armor, and see what this nuke zone Whitesprings thing is about. 5 minutes later I'm sprinting out of there with 8 \~level 68 glowing ones chasing me.
---
First, gravedigging.
---
Second, a proper heavy weapons build shreds through just about anything just as well as any other build. It’s not trash.
---
Very nice. 
---
What levels are your family members, I have some Excavator power armor I have that I don’t need anymore I’ll give it to them if they want it. They’ll need to make some repairs to it though and I won’t be able to give it to them until Friday due to midterms
---
I was including you as well. 
---
As the other post said you want a political slogan on a hat and say it’s not about politics
---
Doesn't it "belong" to the workshop?
---
I think people vendors theirs so you might find it
---
I'm not OP but I approve this message. Constant CAMP attacks need to be dialed back. Started out ok, not too many - figured it was due to being a secluded location. And over the past 2 weeks it changed from \~ 30% of the time its attacked to 30% of the time it isn't. Don't care about repair costs; its just so mundane now:  My reaction has gone from "I better do something!" to "eh, shoot or logout/in."
---
Modded the Fallout 4 one back to that status. Nothing is safe. 
---
Nothing.
---
So that's why Yeti's aren't in Fallout. Gotcha
---
I'm just really curious about Woopsies. Heat Flashes and Swamp Gas seem relatively straight forward.
---
But wha? Woopsies? Only hunch so far is something involving low luck. Maybe have 1 luck and get a withdrawal effect to 0 it? Makes you a clumsy bitch? Man I don't know.
---
I got a zealots explosive double barrel and a vapires explosive laser gatling running through normal whitesptings at random, both level 25.  That shotgun put in work lol
---
African? Do you mean black? 
---
Dam dats cold
---
Legendary non-power armor can have the Assassin's + Sentinel's affixes (yes, both of them) which stack and reduce damage taken by much more than the additional damage resistance.
---
Non-power armor can also make use of the "dense" modifications to add explosive damage resistance, without this mod or while using power armor a player has 0 explosive damage resistance.
---
Its not political. It just supports America. Its patriotic. 
---
Happened to me.  I solved it by storing all my walls then I could get rid of the stairs.
---
(Actually just started storing things and once the walls anywhere near it were gone I could store/scrap the stairs. )
---
Try moving your camp. In one location I had near the Charleston workshop, I would get attacked every time I teleported back to my camp. But in every other camp location I've tried, I have never once been attacked. The most hostile things I've seen in my final camp spot are radstags and possums.
---
I'm also not super high lvl... 56 but I like to roam around and explore.

Fair enough, thanks for pulling back the curtain on the wizard brother!

"Now that's a real shame when folks be throwin' away a perfectly good white alien like that."
---
Doh. I usually set my price to 0 with the toggles and now it reverts it to 25000 when I try to zero out my price 
---
Crazy visual bug. PS4

I found a two-shot broadsider and the first time I used it was against the SBQ and from what I thought was a safe distance but nope...it insta-downed me. Fortunately some kind soul stimpaked me and I switched to melee.
---
I've seen similar claims but again makes very little sense because you're already trading off accuracy and range and weight.
---
Whitespring resort.
---
When entering through the door that are located down the stairs from main entrance (the door that leads you right to the shops) sometimes weird blicking happens and as I make couple steps to go to vendors it puts me immediately back. Then it works normal. Yeah, not major bug, but it’s really annoying after some time, plus this game needs every polishing that can get.
---
+after new update, the robot vendors in whitespring (after entering through this door) are frozen, they are not moving, saying anything, though you can still trade..after minute or so, they are back to normal
---
+and please fix the framedrop issue in Riverside Mannor

Did they increase the cap?
---
thank you soooo much for this! i just bookmarked the gallery and it's gonna save me alot of time and caps
---
Added a brief write-up, but basically high End, resist, blocker, nerd rage, lone wanderer, and serendipity to survive low hp. You can also boost stim pack effect (Int) and speed (cha) to keep yourself alive at low hp, particularly paired with auto-stim gear.
---
Mutations are also important including healing factor (top off between fights) and marsupial (jump away from the pile of laggy glowing ones) IMO
---
Links are allowed in text posts. Just edit this post and paste in your link. 
---
That sounds like one of the quest item you get from the mistress of mystery. It's a stealth boy modified to do what you are explaining. 
---
Yes, at least last time I checked. It's annoying because it's not consistent with other perks just as Chemist. There you can effectively craft 4 radaways at once!
---
What's the bug on lever action rifles? 
---
tl;dr xhdujeg
---
You mean joining their game from the Xbox menu, not from the in-game menu, right? Nothing Bethesda can really do about that, that's part of Xbox functionality. Does xbl not have the option to look up someone gamertag and block them?
---
I have Nvidia video capture hotkeyed at Alt-F9.  Anything happens I have video capture locked and loaded, and so should everyone.
---
The one in game is chrome coloured 
---
Ok, so after some testing and whatnot, it seems critical hits are only possible through VATS or the chem overdrive.  
---
It's padded for leather.
---
I'm starting to get curious if its down to people's DNS settings or something, is it due to WiFi latency, etc. 
---
I myself have had more issues, but no where near the amount others seem to be having. That said my network is isolated from the other users in the house, so essentially a dedicated cable modem just for my consoles/PC (though I will admit I've generally got Youtube playing on the TV) and its not running the more standard networking gear the average user would have.   
---
Just a thought.
---
I thought this was gonna be one of those long posts that led to "buy it from the atomic store" kinda posts lolol
---
I love you guys. I got around 70lbs of junk from a wanted hoarder the other night. Dude left his front door open while crafting.
---
Ngl I would've missed that if you didn't tell me. Thank. 
---
Don't worry. Preston is Bostonian. Not African. It's not him.
---
You're right, like I said it's been a while since I've played my melee toon, I have a swing speed vampire and a seperate regular sledge instigating. I swore it was just 1 but either way, the vampiric super is pretty monster.
---
It will benefit from things that apply to all “melee” or “one-handed melee.”  You can confirm by watching the listed damage on the weapon go up and down (or not) when you pull and then replace a perk card
---
Lmao I think you’re my first hater 
---
Ghoulrot 
---
Same issue on PS4 since the patch. When restarting I can load into a building the .
---
I have so many duplicate plans :( no one will buy them
---
Told my wife I was going to just do a round of selling to the vendors then head to bed. Stopped over in Harper's Ferry first and figured maybe I could find a technical data in a desk or something and stop over in Camp Venture before Watoga. Didn't find any so I just traveled on to the various vendors. Last stop being the Enclave bunker, I find 3 separate technical data in various desks. I proceed to make three round trips from the bunker to venture to my camp to the bunker to turn in data. I played for nearly 2 hours.
---
This is my experience with the game.
---
I can't believe I never thought to use grenades on the mainframe...
---
Good story.   Everyone has explosive stuff.   I have played since beta and all my drops suck.   Surprised if both your explosive guns are legit.  
---
You’re saying that like there was a safe spot around every corner. When someone rings my doorbell, I have no idea who it is and have no idea how long I might be there. Quitting your game isn’t the biggest problem. It’s getting back into the game that takes forever. Another issue is that I may have just gotten killed by a creature and was heading back to get my junk when the doorbell rings. I don’t want to quit the game and risk losing my junk if I don’t have to. 
---
When you're wanted, no one shows up on your map.
---
Though if you're wanted and have a friend spotting for you, then I suppose it's a good idea to crouch regardless.
---
All my legendary drops suck. 97% are just one star. I usually see the same few types too. Mutant Slayers, Assassins, Mutants, and one or two other crappy types that are worthless to me. Found one two shot weapon, and one explosive weapon. Oh, a few that heal with vats criticals, which is useless for me too.
---
I have seen the same one at White Springs a couple times. Both times he was a glowing version during nuke blasts.
---
I've gotten 1 decent melee weapon at level 20 then not anything really very good since. 
---
Agreed!  Or even forbid for currently equipped items.  
---
Sadly i think the community's best days are (hopefully temporarily) behind us. As cheating and griefing run rampant a lot of us are growing suspicious of other players
---
Bl3 is absolutely going to have trading, it's a co op loot based game. You get a gun you don't like? It may be your buddy's favorite, and it would suck to just have to vendor it.
---
Duping is only an issue if you focus on it, if you play with people who don't do it you will never have an issue. It just involves making friends.
---
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for explaining!
---
Yup, I'm expecting one this week
---
If I was in a colony of molerats living on a hillside then some douchey vault dweller set up a compound on top of my den I'd be sure to rip the shit out of it. Maybe that's a good explanation as to creature motivation? :) 
---
fluke? Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
---
Carry 200 toys and charge into the rad zone
---
I got a supersledge that does like 3 more damage and weighs less than all rise and it's 15 levels higher lol. All rise is the shit. 
---
Pretty much. Dupers and people exploiting TSE in PvP ruined it. I don't trust a single person I see using them. Its not your fault. Its just my immediate thought processing when I see it now. Its sad that its gotten that bad.
---
Yaaaassssss xD
---
yes you can now do a trade with a max of 25k caps instead of 5k caps
---
In my experience the queen doesn’t drop them anymore than anyone else. Weapons seem randomly generated with a %chance per perk. 
---
5 queens/day is nothing in terms of probability. You have to specifically farm legendaries, and by that I mean hundreds, to be able to say one way or another. 
---
Why is this -4? Lol
---
Nope just a string of numbers. But thanks!
---
800 atoms
---
Obvious dick is obvious. Not a lie, a mistake. Like I said, it's been a while since I played my melee toon so I logged on to see and I was thinking of my regular sledge (instigating) and super sledge (vampire + swing speed) together for some reason.
---
Or if you want to avoid the load screen of going in and out, there are barrels just down the tunnel from the showers also.
---
Good stuff, thank you
---
Seeing as how there aren't laser muskets in fo76 I'm gonna call bull shit on you not knowing preston since it's obvious you played fo4. 
---
If memory serves, isn't there a (dead) audience there as well, up against the rocks behind you?
---
This is a multiplayer game.
---
Some possibilities:
---
1. A mothman
---
2. A bugged mothman
---
3. A feature from DLC prematurely appeared due to a bug
---
4. A mothman, or something, unreliably observed/described by you
---
5. A hallucination on your part
---
Yes those dupers made it actually fun to try to kill a scorchbeast
---
If it's not in the patch notes, can we report it as a bug? 
---
That would be nice, things not working how they were and there was no mention of the changes anywhere, sounds like a bug to me ;)
---
Thanks! I overlooked that.
---
I really wish it wouldn’t change to 25000 though when I’m trying to set a price to 0
---
I got a 3 star hook.... I didn't even look to see what stats it was. It was the first legendary I found in well over 15 hours of gameplay (I'm not actively seeking them out).
---
Boring. 
---
I'm also expecting another patch/update sometime next week and at least a content announcement by the end of the month.
---
Do you mean if you’re sneaking your circle disappears from the map?
---
It's not a console thing... and that's the FIRST time it ever happened to me.  I have no idea what triggered it... but it was happening to 6 of us who started it.  I'm on the xbox one X, so it's not a hardware thing.  Something went WAY wonky with it.
---
Right, It still would not outweigh the clear advantages of a long barrel. (assuming that it is true) 
---
It's an online game, and it's a risk you have to take along with every single other multiplayer game. If you have your doorbell rang this often, that's another problem.
---
Upvote for dakka dakka. Good thing it's not red.
---
I am on PC.  I thought maybe it was my Vega 64 drivers but I have tried all of them back to the original release for FO76.  It has to be something to do with first person because it does not happen in 3rd person for me.
---
I have basically the same issue - I'll get stuck and can spin around and jump but not move.  Sometimes turning around and going backwards works.  Also opening the quick wheel then tabbing out works.   I was running the big bend tunnel a couple times and it is soooo bad in there.  Its like I get stuck on on everything.
---
They increased the max sale price, but they also broke the fucking slider so if you hit 0 it rolls back to the max price.
---
My camp is tucked out of the way, but not *too* far off the beaten path. I should really spend more time on it. It's got plenty of nice stuff people are free to use. A bed, water and food, instruments etc. The only thing missing is a power armor work station. Haven't found those plans yet. 
---
I understand what you're saying, friend. Why is everyone so scared?
---
Thankfully, I have a group of likeminded individuals to keep me company.
---
Bring the Stand your ground law to fallout! XD
---
Makes sense. I'm on PC. I guess there are discords but finding a random player would be difficult. It would be nice to send quick player to player or team based chats.
---
I keep mine unlocked and I thank everyone who does early in the game I've used many unlocked camps to repair items and use the stash I'm just paying it forward
---
This. This is why I thought I was bugged.
---
Yes and if on xbox sell it to me for cheap like 500 caps :)
---
Hey answer the question milk drinker
---
Need to keep a Charleston Herald newspaper handy to swat them on their noses.
---
Better Off Dead! Nice
---
I don’t interact with anyone besides my own team, so I can’t speak for them. I will say we have a few TSEs and Es, maybe 15 combined. That’s not a staggering amount but it’s not unrealistic given this is a multiplayer game and they’re end game tier weapons. 
---
what is an example of a TSE weapon? I heard about them all the time here but have no idea what it is or what makes them great. Hopefully I havent unknowingly thrown one away
---
Definitely not the experiences I’ve had. 
---
We were the same lvl.
---
Can confirm... some (insert rude remark here) guys decided to grief people right after a SBQ event.  about 14 people lost their power armor in the matter of minutes.
---
Hopping worked, thanks!
---
Yes I will not use any weapons or armor from any of my other characters or trading for any op weapon on reddit or something like that, also I will not farm legendaries either. This way when I get even a 1 star that normally wouldn't even be good on my main, it can be game changing and feel amazing because of how hard it's going to be to get anything of use. 
---
On PS4 L1 drops the price mad fast I'm assuming on xbox its left bumper 
---
Damn I almost feel bad lol 
---
&gt; thic
---
Maybe in real life that would be the case in certain situations, but this isn't a fucking realistic milsim.
---
I don't mind a game being super realistic, but this is the kind of thing that just looks like no one actually checked shit before release (further proof lies in the spelling errors on some of the weapon modifications)
---
Duping is a huge issue for this game and will be until they release private servers.
---
Same, If I enter a tunnel or something ill be stuck right at the entrance -  Try opening your quick wheel and then tabbing out of it while moving forward (on PC)- that works most of the time for me. Its annoying as heck every time I stop indoors I become stuck.
---
Meh. I have a one X and I have to not touch any controls upon loading into a server for about ~30 seconds or else it just laggs to shit and no buildings or anything are loaded in.
---
I also frequently get big stutters where it feels like the game has crashed. Sometimes it snaps back to normal, other times it'll just straight crash to dashboard, and other times again it'll just hang completely and I have force quit through the dashboard.
---
I love the game, but it for sure has some problems, enough of which has stopped me playing on certain days because crashing completely 3 times in a half hour is unacceptable.
---
Especially most YouTubers.... God i hate them.
---
Wait, I'm pretty sure you can get the plan for it at vendors.
---
It's already sailed away from my household and not sailing back before someone donates it to me. I'm not paying even one cent of this game never again. I pre-ordered it because I loved fo3 foNV and fo4 but this fo76 is from place where the sun don't shine and I think it's never gonna shine there anyways. It's broken unplayable garbage filled with bugs and exploits. I really don't understand how somebody can enjoy this. I think they are masochists or really weird people.
---
Plenty of people have already had this idea, I think most people agree, just don't let people swap loadouts in combat. Limit it to in camp or something.
---
Oh no, it’s aceplayss again.
---
Yeah... So if your logic actually worked then World of Warcraft wouldn't have been a thing...
---
So there's that 🤔
---
whatever duper!
---
It’s to the west on the waters edge close to where the truck has lost the logs it is carrying.
---
Thanks for your replying, I get what you mean. My intention is to just find folks that are down already to join up with random folks, I'm not the type of player to build a camp to attract others to join my party, or randomly start following people around the map. 
---
If you mutually just want to play some Fallout 76 with someone that knows video games, but might not be a FO76 expert, I'm your guy. 
---
Yea its getting kind of annoying lol. Hopefully they fix it sometime this week.
---
Isn't that the "extra ammo" rather ?
---
There are user created Discord’s for this
---
Anything with armor penetration. 9 people is good, but definitely pop some chems. Not sure about TSE, but I've have a good history with it.
---
I ran explosive 50 Cal for a bit with Demo Expert and Heavy Gun DMG perks maxed, with Stabilized, Adrenaline Rush, Bloody Mess, and Tenderizer. Popped in Overdrive chem and heavy weapons bobblehead and I loved getting to see how much of the health bar I was chunking down.
---
But lord, does it consume so much ammo.
---
Now I run the same build, but with a TSE Gatling Gun instead.
---
I think every player bought the succulents. They are amazing. Well they are the only small plants too. 
---
How did your friend get the TSE?   Easy to say you don't cheat but what about your friend 'friend' ?  How many transactions has that gun been through? 
---
I just did [exactly what you suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9tzw41/with_all_the_talk_of_bulk_your_stuff_to_save/) and nothing takes more space bulked than unbulked. It's the same weight at worst, or less weight for Aluminum/Lead only.
---
That's much too generous. I'm thinking the punishment needs to be a deathclaw that pursues you across multiple deaths like Chort, the cow monster from The Witcher 3.
---
it's officially reached mutated sense-making two months later
---
Huh. I just checked and it's not showing for me either.
---
They said they were going to try, all depends on how it affects performance.
---
This is so awesome.

So happy I got it
---
24 players in a server.All endgame content is a mess for FO76.
---
I'd like to have like 5-10 namable fast load outs so I could set 
---
fast travel (lose weight feel great)
---
Crafting
---
Hacking/lockpick
---
Melee
---
Shotgun
---
Heavy weapons
---
Sniper
---
SBQ/ blast area
---
Etc.
---
Just select a perk card set instead of manually changing out every card
---
Yeah but from my understanding they are just decoration and don’t actually work.
---
Fuck thats a dumb idea. Go play a single player game. 
---
Sugar Grove is great for screws and springs. 9 times out of 10 it is a face roll through it. That other time there is a bitch of an Assaultron at the very end. I use my Voice of Set for the bonus against robots and to use up .44 ammo that accumulates. 
---
hey its me ur ....yeah, I got nothing.
---
Strobe light adds a good effect 
---
The official reason they got rid of it was that "It contradicted the core gameplay of Diablo 3"
---
I was trying to build a nice lakeside cabin and I found the perfect lake...unfortunately there was a fissure site just down the way. I decided that I might be far enough to where that won't effect me....NOPE. Every 3 minutes a new Beast would come and wail at me while I am trying to build. Then I spend 10 Minutes dodging the echos until he finally lands and I can kill it. After about 4-5 times I decided to move the camp...I'm still upset.
---
How many barrel discussions do you need to start within an hour?
---
&gt; Find the scorched it's controlling and kill them
---
Yeah waste your time running around trying to find scorched, kill them all, beast decides there's no valid place to land. And the whole time it's blasting you anyway.
---
I can’t get one shot i finally built a full set of sentinel assasin i fought 8 people at once lol they got clapped
---
Every. Fucking. Time. 
---
Thought everything is a Chinese VR simulation lorewise :D
---
It requires the use of curator perk and some logging in and out from what I understand.
---
&gt;that can beat the shit out of me
---
That's my problem. The level 80s hurt a bit, but the 50s tickle. They're just frustrating.
---
Unless you're mindlessly farming whitesprings, you'll very rarely if ever run into another player that could negatively affect you 
---
What are you doing that you need more than 600?
---
🥴
---
Since it wasn't clear enough and you have to spell things out for some people here, I understand it wouldn't run like that always, considering all the other common problems with the game, is it beyond reasonable to assume that something like that would be more common than not?
---
 I've read my fair share of horror stories regarding the console versions.
---
Good to hear that it's not always happening though, I would have called it quits for the night myself if the game started running like that, there's been more than a  handful of times I've had to restart multiple times on PC due to, problems, but nothing so drastic as that.
---
6 Anglers 10 levels over anything in the area including you suddenly spawning in your face
---
Consoles just updated today. It might be 1-2 weeks. They said they were going to focus on new content
---
Never played WOW but the Division and Destiny have prevented weapon duplication by avoiding player trading. 
---
So *that* explains why I leveled so quickly!  I was wracking my brain trying to figure out what I did to make 40 go so fast.  I knew I had sleep and food/drink, but that extra most likely tipped me over.
---
Will have to keep an eye out for it in the future!
---
Perhaps you lack the will, the resolve to repair Grognak’s axe. It is not an easy thing to tamper with Divinity.
---
It has the letters g,o,o,g,l,e,i, and t in it. 
---
I also have a video capture I mentioned.  I took a screencap from that to show people it’s more than just still images.  If I knew how to share videos I would, and I’ll gladly share that with anyone that questions the veracity of my claim.
---
It just adds so much flavour. 
---
I've been playing a Water Farmer lately who wanders around giving out bundles of 10 purified water and helping out at defend events and such. 
---
Those are the majority of the players left, the best days are far far behind us.
---
Putting your CAMP at the Charleston pond is kind of a dick move if you're aware that it keeps the vendor from spawning.
---
Placeable items would be a massive improvement 
---
Yep, it's one of these sweet features that would increase QOL so much and that Beth will never implement
---
Yeah, there's more strategy into it as your camp artillery needs to be in range of the target. But works pretty much the same otherwise. I like to target Grafton Steel, because reasons.
---
Just more stuff that's a bit roughed up and immersive 
---
Nope. Not at all. The range is to small.
---
I'm not welcome. I take!
---
Explosive weapons are literally a blast
---
Artillery cannot attack anything too close. I know what you mean about turrets, however artillery can't attack without the smoke grenade being thrown. 
---
Yeah, the reason I was after a short barrel build, in particular, was so I could have a hunting rifle that was "quick". I chose stuff like a quicker magazine and a dot reflex sight etc.
---
When I actually looked into barrel lengths (I haven't looked at them since early game, because I just pick up every gun and scrap it and that way I quickly had almost every gun mod possible) I was hoping for a quicker build for the gun, but when I saw the weights and that there is no actual benefit to using a higher-grade short barrel I was surprised (higher-grade meaning these are mods you unlock much later on)
---
I've found wearing my Santa outfit when giving away stuff tends to help. 
---
The Fireproof perk should now achieve the same effect. That plus padded should get you good. I do think that Padded AND Dense existed for all armors previously, but I could be wrong.
---
How is supporting a black market that is destabilizing the legitimate market not hurting other players?
---
Stupid 24h new account posting rule deleted my post.
---
Well Fed + Rejuvenated seems to cause this suicide behavior at 15 % health for my character. Maybe it even happens without Rejuvenated but at lower hp. I did not test that.
---
I have 3. A 2 shot cryolator, a 2 shot snubnose, and a 2 shot plasma rifle. I grounded so hard for these I ended up getting one from a horde event in the bog, one from a glowing one, and the 2 shot I got from an Enclave event. I almost cried when I got them
---
all of the customary letters and numbers and characters...on little metal metal tiles
---
In theory yes but I live in a perpetual state of running out of springs
---
Thats not true imo.
---
Thanks for the answer, much appreciated!
---
Hoarding everything duh
---
I don't want to spoil anything but I can tell you where to find the in game version if you're looking for it.
---
Ah yes the state of every merchant
---
did they fix duping? because im literally watching some guy do it right now.
---
Haha that's cute. My bloodied explosive Gauss does 3.5k before any bobbleheads if I'm on drugs. I'm a low health build btw
---
Oh yeah I never pvp though so I'm good on that part
---
I had the helmet earlier in the game but mistakenly sold it when I was trying to create space in my stash.  I went back to wear it and it wasn’t there oh well hopefully I run across it again cause I won’t be spending any caps on it that’s for sure.
---
Found a quad assaultron head, was going to hold onto it till the glitch on it got fixed to use as my BFG...
---
...until I realized it was for level 35, legendary drops are a huge disappointment for the most part
---
Problem is I can just easily kill them as they fly w/ my other guns im not even specced into. 
---
No waiting for ground.
---
The first was a question about it, then some people replied with very vague answers.
---
Then I actually took a closer look and realized almost every short barrel weighs more than a long barrel and offers no real advantage in the game, that's why I think its a bug and not just a discussion.
---
OH MY GOD SAME.  I enjoy exploring and questing, I only take on big enemies if I have help and even then the legendary weapons I get are totally worthless and it was a waste of my time and resources. Just hoping one day the SBQ will give me something worth the effort. 
---
Yeah, the higher your level, there more tire irons and wood armor you get.
---
This just made the game a bit harder. I was actually giving cores away to newbs and now im regretting it.
---
Not sure if you can lock shutters, but they can be opened from the outside. 
---
All rise for the honourable judge
---
In a different thread people are saying it's a re-skinned spacesuit, not hazmat. Suit is cosmetic, helmet functions like a gas mask.
---
It's bugged. I've had the same bobblehead on for a week. Though the stacking has to be nerfed ASAP, which is far worse.
---
While I do have 2 explosive weapons I use, both shotguns, I believe you misunderstood.  The .50 cal was the weapon the 100+ was using.  His aim though sucked so he kept hitting the corner of the cover he was using.    
---
I think Fallout: New Vegas Dead Money put it best:
---
"Finding it, though, that's not the hard part. It's letting go".
---
Mine only repairs things that are destroyed, doesn’t seem to affect things that are only damaged
---
Armor penetration is multiplicative, so resistance probably is too.
---
Meaning you get diminishing returns and can never hit 100%. 
---
90% of my deaths are to goddamn Colonel Gutsy's. i swear those bullets ignore armor.
---
sounds like someone got one shot 
---
Or you could put Scorch Killer on one of your weapons. The game gives you the tools to kill them quickly and efficiently, it just doesn't tell you.
---
Oh...by the title I though you had a fetish for windows or something...
---
Nope, sadly not.
---
where's the part about where you were griefed repeatedly and someone blew your camp up? 
---
I thought that was all that was allowed to be posted here
---
Ps4 pro 1st hour - 1 frozen load screen and 1 blue screen.
---
And load screens seem lot longer imo.
---
Its in a inside a instanced area, they should be fine. I was in the whitesprings resort and i was perfectly fine.
---
Stingwings are the best for this. (Low level and in high numbers)
---
I’ll stick with my HUGE MUSCLES and two handed weapons.
---
What are you talking about??
---
I don’t care what perks people use, I care when they’re being assholes for no purpose but to kill lower levels. Since when did level 9’s and 18’s get TSE guns? Explain this “new world”, please. 
---
Nah man, its not like this game gets every gets more challenging, especially once or if you ever get a TSE weapon.
---
You'll eventually ending up getting majority of the Perks and inevitably duplicates.
---
Pistols/Stealth build is your main, now start building up an alternative build for your alternate build.
---
My favorite is when you do the Power plant mission so your workshop's breaker works, capture and build your base *then* crash.
---
Don’t do it. It’s supporting the duper’s that ruined the economy for me and every other ex merchant out there.
---
pirate hat or tricorn hat?
---
That's what she said.
---
If you do that quest in the future, here is how to do it safely. Go to the mine hq without any junk on you. I made the mistake of going there once with all the stuff in my inventory as a way to count it out and make sure I had it all. I died after entering the building and the server crashed as I was trying to get back there to pick up my junk. 
---
I really hope so. Even in passive mod I keep losing my Junk bc i never have enough stash space.
---
Put an ad on fo76 bazaar to find a tse 10mm pistol 
---
Funnily enough I got one from the machine last night.... Then found another on the roof of West Tek just out in the open.... Being perfectly not preserved on a table.... Next to a corpse....
---
I can't speak for the duping procedures for other ip but the duping this game suffers from isn't caused by an exploited trade mechanic.
---
Trading has existed since day one in wow and they to the best of my knowledge never had these issues.
---
The problem is sheer incompetence on Bethesda's part and lack of proper testing...
---
One day my turrets turned on my armor crafting station. It didn’t do anything to deserve it, all 8 of them just started unloading on it
---
There (look at that over there!), their (their house is quite beautiful), and they’re (conjunction of they are).
---
yeah u can block people in the main menu.
---
But i’m not sure it their Fo76 nickname is also their xbox live gamertag. If they aren’t the same it will probably difficult to find someone and block them.
---
I have a 150 mbps connection and run my DNS through google, not my providers.  If I have over 50ms latency with any other game then something is wrong.
---
The server I was on when I made this post out of frustration was lagging from the minute I logged on.  It was taking multiple seconds to simply place something at my camp and eventually I was disconnected.
---
I want to find this as a note out in the wastes...
---
Sadly, people would just write the N-word over and over again if they had the ability.
---
Idk why people lock their doors anyway. A friendly wont fk with you and a griefer will just blow the door down.
---
If anyone believes that a barrel half the length is gonna have more material in it and weigh more, I'm not sure what to say. It would have either be a long paper thin barrel or the short barrel doesn't have room for the bullet to go through as it is solid metalll
---
I saw a different one some time ago taking plastic into account. My bad for the weight reduction, but anyway, my point stays the same. Bulk only when you are sure to vendor, or take the risk to kiss goodbye your mods (like my dear jetpacks) 
---
I've started teaming and running a medic handmade. Everyone loves you when you heal them
---
You can
---
It does work, because those guys had no melee. 
---
I use melee as well. :)
---
For me its just habit (coming from other games like this). When I remodel, I probably won't bother.
---
Forces them to get wanted at the very least (as long as you're not wanted)
---
Swap it out for a single-shot mod and be amazed at how long it lasts by comparison. Durability is tied to fire rate. I know guys who carry two gatling plasmas into queen fights so they can swap out the broken one.
---
That is how it works, an old glitch was you could trade what weapon you had equipped with out knowing peeps were taking advantage of but has been fixed to my knowledge...
---
Sounds like that one server I was in actually, it was doing that same CAMP placement thing and delayed key presses. 
---
Yeaaaah I would go full John Wick on them. They deserve it even tho I don't pvp normally.
---
TSE stands for Two Shot Explosive. They are 2 or Three Star Legendary Weapons. They shoot an extra projectile as well as explode on impact doing explosive damage. Explosive Perks apply the explosive Damage as well. Get that effect on weapon with Full-Automatic fire or a shotgun and its very very strong.
---
no
---
Yep. 200+ hours / lvl 48 here and I've never even seen a TSE. In fact I've probably seen less than 20 legendary drops of any type. Not everyone is constantly nuking Whitesprings to farm for three star weapons.
---
I personally feel like I've played "a fair amount" to hit that mark in two months or so, but I know there's still people who are getting 3 or 4 times more playtime than that in
---
Dumb question. What's TSE?
---
One of the brick windows can be walked through, the other can't.  On top of not having things that can be interacted with near windows, if they vats you and attack they'll teleport.
---
i posted about this a while ago, and got mixed reviews. after realizing its no use to vent or argue or try to give a good point i just said fuck it.
---
 they don’t know you, not like they’ll remember in a week. and if you launched the blast zone, you get dibs. if i’m on a team i’ll let them tag idc about anyone else. in the zone it’s mostly other high players who aren’t as courteous and thinking about you like you are them. so why care? cause you got a hardy thumbs down? 
---
Does White Knight affect hazmat suits?
---
Anecdotally, from the speed at which they break, I would guess no. Curious if anyone has more definite information
---
It doesn’t. That’s what the post is about. 
---
I have no idea. I paid caps for it. How do you something you bought at a yard sale wasn't stolen?
---
No. If you open the stashbox in another players camp or anywhere else you get access to your own and only you own stash.
---
Somebody who gets it. 
---
I like using my grognaks axe and super sledge on TSE users and close range fights, it’s just a righteous serving of justice, and I know the pain of blowing myself up with my handmade.
---
That I’m not sure of. I had an 1000 caps bounty and I didn’t time it to the second. But it was right around 3 hours when it said I was no longer wanted. 
---
Umm. Well you're wrong about classic games.
---
Largely that is pure nostalgia.... Mike Tyson's punch out? Is the now the equivalent of games today with an over abundance of quick time events. Memorize a pattern...rinse...repeat. most of the later game fights give you no freedom. You memorize the pattern or lose. There's one path to winning. One patch only.
---
And as far as the game not giving you in game features to play a role being bad design? 
---
I'll again point to D&amp;D which allows you to role play an unlimited number of types of characters. It doesn't give you a "Murder all Star elves to avenge your fallen God" kit to play with. You role play it. 
---
A game that gives you a rule set, but also gives you the freedom to roleplay any character you can imagine is not poorly designed. 
---
It just appeals to people who see games for more than just a power leveling/min maxing exercise.  
---
Bravo son, bravo. I approve! :)
---
Sometimes i go straight to the bench and get the same issue- go to your stash and give it a second to load and display your stash items- usually fixes it without reloading.
---
The market is fucked regardless of any individual, the blame lies on the developers not the players EVERY online game with trading is subject to having a black market, and if you feel the need to use it then legitimate acquisition isn't balanced well
---
Thank you. Just trying to fill a hole I see. Total male mentality really.
---
Biggest kicker with Scorchbeasts, you need a BIG area for them to land, I generally look for atleast a 50 ft by 50 ft area, on flat ground ( no trenches or rocks or tree's) you need almost 2x the size of the scorchbeast as they land and run forward sometimes.
---
A guy on reddit did some testing a few weeks back. If you cripple a wing it looks for a place to land, this does not mean it lands automatically and it will not fall out of the sky.
---
So the sequence goes, you cripple it, it LOOKS for a place to land (&lt;1/2 second) IF no legit place to land it goes right back into another 2-3 wave sonic attack, than checks again for a spot (&lt;1/2 second) and if no spot again, right back into a sonic attack. And it will continue this pattern until either it finds a spot to land or the limb is no longer crippled. Meaning unending sonic spam.
---
So my advice to you is PA up, find the closest large open area, perk enforcer rank three and hipshot the SB with your shottie until it lands. Heavy tree cover, rocky mountainous terrain, heavily trenched areas in the bog, and places with ground clutter like buildings make it almost impossible to get one to land.
---
Sidestepping + Marsupial make it easier to avoid the sonic spam. Also if your near an AA camp run to it and abuse the extra firepower.
---
Hope this helps, SB used to be a pain for me, but now most times that I die, I've accidently jump into the fissure and die vs being killed by the SB.
---
Yeah, lower levels have them now too.
---
Seems stable. Been on same server for awhile. Launching a second nuke soon. 
---
Definitely a mixed bag of feelings with this new update. We’ve got a handful of new goodies to dive through, but we also have a good amount of disappointments.
---
**THE GOOD:**
---
* **Nuka Cola Quantum Sign**
---
* **Smile Mask**
---
* **Playtime Paint**
---
**THE BAD:**
---
* **Clown Suit**
---
* **Space Suit**
---
* **Pirate Hat**
---
The Nuka Cola Quantum Sign is a very welcomed addition to the Atomic Shop. I will always be a huge fan of any item that comes to the shop that isn’t just a retexture. It’s a brand new clean light. The only downside to this item is that it’s standalone, and nothing else matches it at the moment. It’d be a pretty cool item in any C.A.M.P, but it’ll definitely stick out. I do personally wish that it came as a set, with either some more Quantum items or more signs for other Nuka flavors.
---
The 3 items I listed under “bad” aren’t necessarily bad items, but they’re lazy. These items are already in-game, but they’re “dirty”. This is what’s currently wrong with the Atomic Shop. I believe that the Atomic Shop should be a place where Bethesda’s art team could let loose and have some fun. What this looks like instead, is a cheap and lazy way to manipulate your player base. Lazy retextures and reused assets have no place in the Atomic Shop. If they’re to be placed in the shop at all then they should definitely not be sold at 600 to 800 Atoms.
---
Also, remove the camera restrictions, and let you orbit farther around your character. Nothing is worse than having an idea for a great shot, then getting the not enough space for camera message. Or not being able to place the camera far away enough to achieve the effect you're looking for.
---
On a related note, if you get the Terminal plans, and build one in your base, do you get attacked as soon as you use it?
---
Stripping features that drive better community interaction is hardly the solution to a problem. It's the lazy way out if anything. It's better to design a system that either prevents duplication from occurring, or a system that can track unique item ID's to ensure visibility to such issues when they occur. Neither are inherently difficult, but when you're working within the limitations of a specific engine it becomes problematic, which I believe is what is happening with 76. 
---
so only new letters? I was hoping for light up signs dang
---
Man, I did my level best to fuck up as many fireflies as I could, and I could only get about 25 :(
---
I must have entered the event late or something, because I only had like 6 minutes to do it.
---
“GHOOOOOOOST RIIIIIIIDEEEERRRRS IIIINNNNNN THE SKYYYYYYY”
---
*angry trumpet*
---
It took awhile to get used to not being able to pause. 
---
Now I just find a safe place and crouch with chameleon armor go take care of the kids or dogs and go right back to playing.
---
I actually enjoy the fact that when I'm away from the game for a few minute I could get killed it adds to the experience.
---
Also I enjoy the little bit of panick when I'm frantically searching my pip boy new weapon while being attack because mine broke
---
BTW haven't been killed in that situation yet
---
TLDR: don't be a wuss we don't need to pause it's lame
---
gross, but i appreciate the response 
---
Melee VATS will do that?
---
I was like that with the stack of wooden clipboards at my local supplies store. All those springs!
---
Well. Seeing as the game is defined as multiplayer it doesn't matter what your opinion of it is. Everyone thinks their opinions have merit. They don't. Most of the time? Those people are just wrong. 
---
Stubborn. Short sighted and wrong.
---
The one for ~12k is the neon letters/numbers/characters and an open sign
---
this post here should help you out:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afcgjc/i_made_a_visual_catalog_of_camp_assets_by_plan/
---
Cola is your best bet imo.
---
That's what I was gonna try first. Thanks!
---
Economies imply cash? 
---
That's the fucking stupidest thing I've ever heard. We're talking about an economy in the context of a fucking video game.
---
Again. Your opinions don't mean fuck all. You can have them. It doesn't mean it's right. Especially in the face of facts. 
---
Haters hate man... that or there are some hater snowflakes out there that got there feeler hurtz.
---
Straitjackets too! And you can find them in abundance in Fort defiance
---
I don't even trust anyone anymore - not just someone with TSEs.  Unfortunately the dupers, griefers and PvPers has ruined the game and trust for everyone else.  A lot of us Pacifist players just want to play the game and don't mind coop and working with other players, but there is now zero trust.
---
Ok, they must be up to something with it then.
---
Yea my base is welcoming this guy was just following me around the map trying to pvp when i clearly didn't have time for it.
---
I'm level 90 and don't have any.
---
that's "Small Letters Set"
---
That's about what I had.  I was able to finish it with 4 secs to spare.  
---
This applies to all stash boxes. Tool chests, safes, and lockers for example. 
---
As a new unit it will be open to discussion amongst the formative members. But personally I'd like to see it as true to the lore of the brotherhood as possible.
---
I've ran a milsim unit in Arma 3 on PC for a long time and would like to bring a taste of that to PS4 within the remit of the BoS and F076s limitations!
---
I just ended up blocking him and server hopping.
---
Guess I read the original comment wrong... didn't intend to say it always runs like that.  In fact, it almost never has any issues.  I was actually confused why some on PC were complaining about frame rate issues in some locations, or as to why they were specifically addressing Silo runs for xbox during the mainframe core portion as I never saw a problem there.  It's been 99% smooth sailing as far as frame rates go for me.  
---
Last night was just really peculiar in that it was a sudden drop and it just stayed that one.  One friend quit the game out and got back in and it cleared up for him.  I tried to walk out of the area, but that didn't work for me either.
---
Just always depressing to lose what was a winning SBQ kill until a bunch of randos showed up and wrecked the framerate =P.
---
Speaking as someone with a two shot fatman who has attached and removed the mirv from it I do not recommended it.  The range on the MIRV is just to short to be effective.  It's cool to feel like Tony stark at the beginning of the first iron man movie but that's about all you get.  You'll get way more effect without it.
---
What the heck since when do people know me? Looooooool this is weird 
---
&gt; These items are already in-game, but they’re “dirty”.
---
The pirate hat was already in the game? Any idea where to get it?  
---
I don't really like the 'clean' look of most cosmetics. Stands out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the world.
---
I am having server problems. Keeps crashing.
---
Well, to sell/give them.
---
There was a great thread on here about lower levels jumping in on the Queen Battle. They basically said if you can't really do damage to the queen, tag her for the loot/XP, but spend your energy clearing mobs that spawn, so the higher level players can focus on her. Seems like a win/win.
---
It has signs...and letters
---
Hey, someone had to say it
---
I find i'm usually drowning in shotty shells and gears after a good uranium fever run
---
Roof of the Red Rocket in Flatwoods has a S.O.S. message to aircraft.
---
Wow... Dude, you gotta learn to focus less about the destination and more about the journey.
---
This whole game was grind to get the "best" weapon (whatever that means) and you had no fun along the way?
---
Yeah, shit's rare. Other people have it. Other people may have been luckier or may have cheated their way to it (either via dev room or buying it).
---
Don't waste your time comparing yourself to others. You will ALWAYS be dissatisfied.
---
You literally have “Sub to aceplays” on your profile.
---
It's in the patch notes, under Quests and Events.
---
Sorry I wasn't specific, is it your server or the client crashing?
---
I'm not sure how often this is true, but I found Plan: Garage Door on the floor of Site Charlie.
---
I've used grenades and explosive weapons (with the increased radius perk) and found that it's still actually faster to click them myself. The explosions would break a few of the boards but leave a few in tact. Rushing through and clicking them in quick succession worked faster for me.

Xbox One X player here since the Stress Test. Performance has been utter shit throughout, but getting steadily worse over the last few weeks. Just because YOU didn't experience shitty performance, does not mean it doesn't exist.

Is this version 1.0.0.9?
---
Goat Legs with Bird Bones is a god send. Jump off *all* of the things.
---
I hope it holds true when I play on my X later. Performance has been utter shit lately.

What else is a griefer gonna do to grief you in your camp?

They're just gonna destroy it because they *want* the bounty.

Heavy Gunner here: A .50 MG is a resource-intensive alternative in between the minigun and Gatling gun for ROF/DMG, and is powerful at all ranges in good hands. Use grenades, carry the Bunker Buster and Daisycutter, when the auto-GL gets fixed, get your hands on that, too. You'll be sucking down steel like a bastard, but you'll be killing *everything*. TSE shotgunners, scorchbeasts, sentry bots, armies of all kinds, all laid to waste with just nerves of steel and a healthy serving of lead and ordnance.
---
War never changes, be the war machine.
---
I like how Fortnite:STW does it.. you learn the recipe to make the gun.  You can make them and sell/trade the gun but they break eventually.  I think that would fit in well with Fallout.
---
PS4 
---
Unable to craft the lvl 50 legs for the X01. The game tells me I lack the materials but I don’t. All the other lvl 50 parts I can craft no problem. 
---
And without dupers it would be different? Remember you can't dupe a weapon that never dropped, so it is pvp that is inherently a problem here.
---
Since yesterday I use [that](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/214) mod. It's great. It shows a little icon next to the plans you already own.

Sorry to hear that :( My first impression of this patch is really good. Even if its only out for a few hours.

ELI5?

Reading this topic has me chuckling. 
---
My dreams are about the game. Inside it. 
---
Hey now, Bobby pin weight just got reduced to .001 :p
---
There should be a perk card for VATS-ing limbs. Idk if it works for melee though since I run mostly with my 10mm SMG or Gatling gun
---
Bought 1 from another player after hitting 80 and it was just the right time. It makes Scorchbeats bearable at a time where I "should" be able to solo Scorchbeasts and other monsters. I have a bunch of 3 star armor but I got those from world hopping Scorch Queen lobbies. 
---
I found the clown suit day one, been wearing it ever since
---
that's precisely why Bethesda designed the game the way they did, right? with an emphasis on singleplayer content over multiplayer mechanics? since interaction isn't forced are at all and there's no content gated behind parties. I guess being online and having other people on the map is all that matters.
---
but sure, let's hang onto definitions alone for the sake of "winning" an internet argument. or Bethesda's word, I'm sure it's still good for it.
---
How about one-shot exploding? Am I going to be friendless too?

Not long. Then, considering someone starts duping, they didn't stop at that.

Shhhhh. We need people like this to rebuild the economy.

I do it so that people don’t leave my door open giving enemies a clear path to fuck shit up

Huh?  So 100% of people trying to get at me in my base are griefers and 100% of griefers want a bounty?

Wait til hour 400 hits and you find something half ass legendary. Lol But. If you farm for it and that's your only objective, you will find better items easier. 
---
There are so many assets of cages and hanging corpses. Those ski resorts with super mutants are filled to the brim with them. Imagine being able to put those up yourself, complete with a skeleton inside

I think scorch killer pretty much sums it up in title.
---
If I find out any more specifics or come across the recipe myself, I’ll make sure to let you know.
---
I use a level 50 Perfect Storm, Mutant SLayer Gauss Rifle and an Instigating Dragon for tough mobs. That think sucks to reload though. I have a level 30 2 shot single action but I recently swapped it for the 10mm.
---
How do you attend your own wedding AND launch two nukes at same time?  I call BS unless they had friends do it for them.  Also never seen two nukes on a map before either.  Is that possible?
---
I'm so sorry. I replied to the wrong person!
---
Bad bot
---
Waiting for my friend to come over tohnight to try it with me and I will get on asap !
---
VATS melee only way to safely tag one that's rumbling with the bots.
---
Yeah you can melee vats to get around/through lots of stuff.  You have to be pretty close but as soon as it goes from 0% to 95% you can attack and it'll teleport you.
---
I do the same thing, handing out level-appropriate weapons and armor to people who are just out of the vault.  After reading this thread, I feel lucky that I haven't encountered one of these "Dupe-Hunters".  
---
They said F
---
No content locked behind parties? Go read some charisma perks cards guy. 
---
And you're right. It doesn't force mp..... Or even encourage it...

Which is why this sub never has posts looking for people for nukes or sbq

Lame when you are trying to get killed!

I spend most of my time building and Crafting so I have a lot of materials, but Junk and aid items take up a crap ton of space 
---
I have to admit duped weapons are not expensive since the dupers duplicated like 123trillion.
---
TSE handmade can be bought for 3k on the market for example... Thats kond of sad, but it doesnt make my game expirience worse. I found my quad explosive shotgun with lvl 140+ and I was still super happy about it. Didnt care if it got duped already and everyone has it
---
Hoarding weapons...you’re not the boss of me.
---
Like I said, I couldn’t pick it all up and didn’t know how.  I never claimed I got it all and explicitly said I didn’t.
---
Also, why would I try and bring such public attention to this duping if I was a part of it??  I assume (hope, actually) I could get in so much trouble for doing something this egregious!
---
&gt;THE BAD:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Space Suit
---
Looks like the only decent thing on there to me /shrug.
---
Appreciate the help.
---
Funny, I got my TSE lever legit from a non nuked ghoul. Wonder if anybody else has had one drop, or am I just the luckiest guy in the human race?
---
FYI Excavator does NOT increase yield from Ultracite Deposits, for those of you making Ultracite ammo. Unless the patch released today fixes that.
---
Unfortunately, I don't get the joke. 
---
You should be fine. I run almost the same build, but with auto pistols.
---
I have a quad, 50% crit damage 10MM, and recently I found an explosive 10MM too. 
---
*cheers* 🥃
---
My bad, I mistook this hat for another. It is a reused asset from Fallout 4 Fall Harbor though.
---
game is literally being ruined by dupers amd its fucking pathetic. 
---
Just based on the fact that you asked that question in the first place:
---
You'd best know all about passive mode already...
---
I may just abandon it for now, the turrets do a lot of damage right now, so if it's not really worth it. Thanks though 😊
---
Fucking turrets a DICK! Jesus Christ!
---
I was just thinking that this story is cute, but that’s any online open world game. Shiet, people used to have house parties in gta 5 to celebrate birthdays. 
---
It was fun at first. Now i prefer rocking my medic build (2 shot medic's handmade, pyrolyser with friendly fire and pacifist on) and teaming with randoms. Everyone loves a healer
---
Given all the possible combinations, the odds of getting a TSE (not E by itself, that's common), are really really really poor.  First you actually have to get a 2+ star drop, that alone increases the number of legendaries you have to farm by a factor of probably 5-10. 
---
If you had a team of 4 (just assuming that number) with more than 10 TSEs, I would doubt half of them were legit unless you each have a few hundred hours of gametime or trade for them.  I traded for one that I know was a dupe because what can I do.  I traded for other combinations that probably were legit, because they weren't TSEs.  But I've never found any legendary weapon better than what I can buy legit or not. Not even close.  For one thing, most players are going to just use a couple weapon types due to perks.
---
Anyways, yeah, finding yourself a weapon that goes with your perks that's a TSE is just not going to happen for most players.
---
Yeah, I trade extensively on FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar reddit.
---
FO76 Market = More players and they have a +karma system to show who has a lot of successful trades done.
---
FO76 Bazzar = About 1/3 of the players of FO76 Market.  Still worth checking out.
---
If you make a buying or selling post, put it in BOTH of them for more responses.  Make sure you refresh your sale page every 5 mins so you don't leave potential buyers or sellers hanging.
---
It's a great way to buy / sell both items and get caps.  I never have to do the dreaded 7 merchant run anymore in-game.  I have plenty of caps, and good weapons / armor now :)
---
Most of the assets in Fallout 76 are reused assets from Fallout 4 lol
---
Because. It shows how much people are willing to waste money on expensive items. You got people on fortnite selling accounts, And tf2 websites selling skins, cosmetics, and more for paypal or real USD.
---
Haha so in real life never buy anything or trade with people haha grow up man. Other players are a part of the game and you're foolish if you gimp yourself by never trading with others.
---
Well I prefer scopes,just because I can hit stuff at long range.ill use vats for medium range.
---
Come on, it's fun!
---
Any gun could be a TSE = Two Shot Explosive.  I had a high level give me a two shot explosive shotgun.  It's very difficult to use because you end up killing yourself a ton.  The explosives hit things near you and kill you along with enemies in the blast.   Launching my first nuke I resorted to using it against the assaultrons when I was running out of stimpaks.  I killed myself a few times and had to run back down to my teammate.  It one shots the assaultrons, but it one shots yourself as well so you have to make sure the hit is far away.  
---
And I'm still more amused by Grafton Shows
---
What the hell is PvP?

My friends said I shouldn't TSE

What's not TSE?

Dear loyal Bethesda Consumer: [https://imgur.com/4D6kAoh](https://imgur.com/4D6kAoh)

When I first heard about how Vault 79 requires players to effectively lock themselves in there, it screamed "instanced dungeon" to me. 
---
Lol i can relate 
---
Try a splash on the rocks, can't hurt
---
I do the same, get up high and crouch, go make coffee or lunch, lol opps come back and I died of thirst.

It does though, because he does... he is our President, our representative to the world.
---
Pistols really can't compete with any of the other rifle / heavy weapon builds.  If you want to do it for fun / challenge sure.  But if you're looking to min-max you'll need to respec into rifles or heavy weapons.
---
ah that makes sense
---
Unfortunately tricentennial hats don't count yeah :( 
---
&gt; I have no idea how to dupe and zero interest in learning how
---
Well your friend does or at least traded for one.  Chances are if they're being traded for, it's duped.  Chances are if it's given away it's duped.  Chances are if you see someone using one it's duped.  They're just incredibly rare otherwise.
---
It's the bobbleheads, the BOBBLEHEADS! With my armor I can take a TSE shotgun to the face. But nobody can survive any explosive weapon, not even necessarily two shot when 500 explosive bobbleheads are stacked.
---
Yes, it's intended. The star count is the maximum amount of effects an item can have, not a guarantee
---
I stated clearly in the post I grabbed what I could, server hopped, and dropped it in a river.  I’ve got nothing to hide which is why I’m comfortable with sharing an image of my carryweight - it was right before I destroyed that stuff.
---
If you like ginger ale, dark rums mix pretty well with it.
---
I'll start with that and move to cola 
---
I've found like three bobbleheads at best, and found my TSE legit. Fuck these dupers. Seriously.
---
I don’t get it, why isn’t the log prompt showing?
---
Did you check the map?
---
It's nothing like a yard sale..  you can bet that it's duped.  It's more likely duped than not.  Far more.
---
I went to science in highschool and got excited over a hot plate for the circuitry 
---
With lack of how rare items are I feel trading is a little over powered. Like diablo3 if they had a system of only being able to trade a item for only a few hours and only within the server you found it on, it wouldn't be a bad thing. Then you have diablo2 (best diablo imo) where trading is always open but you could spend a year grinding to only find one or two high runes. It's defiantly a balance thing.
---
Remember kids, say "NO!" To clickbait.
---
Yeah I know was jut wondering if y were the kinda guy to lead them outside throw an arty grenade in the parking lot and run 
---
yeah that's why i thought it would be cool on an armor piece. but i guess now that i think about it I've never seen it on anything but a weapon
---
I have my Sentinels assassin's armor and it does wonders combined with padded mod on my chest and now fireproof after the patch.
---
The game is being ruined by an incompetent developer, the dupers are just speeding up the process.
---
Had Bethesda done proper testing and coding the could have all been prevented. Now their stuck in a position where dupers and exploiters are a large % of the population and if there ever get rid of them outright the player numbers will take a huge hit.
---
It's so sad they let it get to this place to begin with :(
---
I just don't pick them up. All they going to do is sit and take up valuable space (1 pund for a bobblehead like really, stimpacks I can see but bobblebois should be .5 pounds)
---
Wait wtf? They can give the ability for the helmet to be a mask here but they can't do the same for the Nuka-Girl Rocketsuit?
---
Bobbleheads aren't obvious until you equip the perception perk to make a sound when they are nearby. Once you use that for a bit you start to figure out the typical places they are.
---
I didn't find very many before I equipped the perk for a while and now I spot them all the time. 
---
There is also a surgical mask in the game that looks similar, just dirty and without the smile.
---
Nice
---
Finally someone with a sense of decency 
---
People could be coming here from Google someday.
---
Power attacks are not shown in the base damage in the Pip-Boy. Mind elaborating on the effects of both, might be able to figure this out better
---
Western revolver with long barrel 
---
It's not a bad investment if you enjoy it.
---
What are TSE weapons?
---
Yeah in that case since players are targeting stupid numbers like 50k, even if your armor gets you to 10% damage, and you have dense, and you have fireproof, you're probably not going to reach the necessary defense to live. I can imagine someone with Assassin's, Endurance +1, Sentinel Heavy Combat Armor, with BoS mods, Dense on the chest, the secondary mod for the limbs has nothing that will help here, except perhaps reduced limb damage. Including ballistic armor resistance you'll be looking at a half of a percent of damage with that build out, which translates to 250 damage, which is survivable because of the endurance (Assuming only 50k damage per shot). However, having that sort of perfectly optimized build, and still taking 250 damage per shot is pretty stupid. I mean I guess it's not perfectly optimized, haven't factored in a perfect perk defense outfit, and with that, you might well be down to the point where you're only take 0.001% damage, which is at that point manageable with anything but the MOST broken power ups (IE people targeting millions of damage per shot).  
---
Of course, I guess that's the issue, is all the grieffers have to do is just consume that many more bobbleheads until they reach the appropriately damage output and can kill you no matter how much you buff yourself, and then with a build out like the one above, we're talking about a player that breaks the game in a totally different way that is effectively immortal except against players with equally stupid broken builds, so it's not really practical to build a meta of broken-ness. 
---
Unless your sniper is a TSE hahaha
---
I wish they would give us some damn weapon camos already :( they showed off vault tec paint in the screenshots of some armor, they showed off a camo rifle in another (seems like that picture got taken down from the atom shop though), and others were datamined on launch and still not released. Now they're taunting us with what looks like [an enclave skin for the 10mm pistol](https://imgur.com/8VNelib)
---
Almost done downloading. A couple more mins 
---
I'd love to see the nanosuit from an fo4 mod. Wish they put a bit more work into their apparel textures. I can see pixels in my undergarments and with a lot of apparel (my textures are on ultra too). 
---
Ive seen people say it exists, but I’ve never seen anyone say they’ve seen it or had it. I’ve seen the mod for pretty much every other armor though
---
Ah shit, it is!? I'm usually all over patch notes, I must know ALL the changes, I'm off to reread'em, thanks for the headsup, I'll be over here facepalming. 
---
&gt; they love the game IN SPITE of it's flaws.
---
That doesn't make the game good.
---
&gt; first couple weeks of release it has already come a VERY long way
---
95% of the changes since release are addressing bugs (that should have been fixed before release/during beta) or extremely bad design choices that the community was not pleased with.
---
If this game would have waiting a couple more months with an actual beta, it might have had a chance. They released what they called a full game way too early and in a messy state.
---
Only redeeming factor with F76 is playing in the Fallout world with friends. But with so little to do, that doesn't last long.
---
For me its been cigarette packs
---
I'm sure they'll be buffed at some point, but if you get a good pistol you shouldn't be too far from the DPS of others, and you can focus on criticals, VATS and gun-fu more.
---
I'd say, look into branching weapons. Maybe a rifle or heavy weapon to supplement your raw damage when you need a burst of big damage.
---
Single action has a bit more damage but lacks versatility. It has one mod (ivory grip) and has a very slow reload. 
---
.44 might actually do more damage with a hardened receiver, but I can't confirm that for you right now. 
---
The Western revolver is the best one though. Basically just a more powerful .44
---
&gt; caramel rum
---
Coffee.
---
I atleast enjoy the look of it so that's good enough for me haha
---
That's what i'm hoping. I still love the game despite being acasual and i feel I benefit from that. As a drop in/drop oit game it's perfect. I can log in, run an event or two, drop a nuke if i have the time, have an adventure and know there's more content for next time.
---
Content drought always leads to a drop in players and an up in griefing, and sadly in it's current state 76 lends itself much more to a casual player than a hardcore one
---
This was for regular ammo but thanks I’ll add it
---
I logged into the game once, at my camp, and had a moment to realize I was in for a bad day. As everything was loading in, I could hear a familiar flapping noise. By the time I could move my character the screeching sonar explosions had already started. To my horror, I then realized there were THREE of the ugly bastards overhead.
---
The scorched plague is an extinction level event. Those are not empty words.
---
Nice splash in some coffee doesnt sound to bad
---
I'll stick with my bloodied explosive Gauss, even with fireproof on someone it is doing like 3k damage
---
Thanks, go it! Along with a couple of cool outfits. 
---
Dumb Magaboi will be dumb Magaboi
---
On an actual good note, I’m finally getting out of the hospital!!!!
---
So have a blessed day!!!
---
Now to just deal with the medical bills thanks to trumps awesome health insurance programs he’s put in place.... oh wait
---
The problem is in Fallout 76 if you like min/maxing you're screwed.  Trying to get the right legendary drop with ideal perks is almost impossible.  To date  I have never found one single TSE weapon of any type.  I've gotten several two shot weapons (no handmades) and several explosive weapons (combat rifle was one). 
---
Now if they wanted to screw over the dupers and help players at the same time...........
---
Make it so you could LOCK weapons / armor in your pip boy so they couldn't be sold, traded, dropped, or scrapped.  Then give us the ability to SCRAP UNLOCKED weapons and armor for a 5% chance to pull 1 legendary modifier off that item.  There's still a grind there, but it's an achievable grind.
---
Until something like that happens, the black market will always be alive and strong.
---
Lol it happens.
---
As someone who usually plays in a team and we are forever trading ammo back and forth, this slider thing is a nightmare. Even using the bumper to get smaller increments, I can sometimes only go as low as say 500 when I'm trying to hit 0. Please tell me they're going to fix this. It's making on the spot trading so hard. 
---
Was really for testing purposes. I know how to farm. If nobody else is there I generally place the nade outside the door and enjoy the show. I'm not a sick. though I did see someone with theirs placed to fire through the window of the back of the golf club. Now that I don't condone. If I choose to blow my scorched to the moon, well this is post apocalyptic America and all....
---
Yeah, it's a shame that they're repackaging and reselling it in bits and pieces though. :\\
---
Definitely a shady tactic IMO.
---
New feature.  Good for high level traders.
---
Now I just wish when you bottomed out the counter to zero, it wouldn't teleport back up to 25,000 on the other side of the scale....lol
---
If only dual wield.. Single actions reload hurts 
---
What's sad is the implication that the guy who dug the graves made it just a few feet before being swarmed by enemies and killed. I forget if it's dogs or molerats but there's a dead BoS soldier walking away from the graves
---
Ill still add you then, if you happen to be online then we can run one whenever pretty much
---
FO4 definitely seemed to be lacking the "alien" DLC, maybe the team decided to hhold off till 76.
---
I'm starting to think this hysteria extends far past TSE now.
---
I've been called a hacker twice in the last few days. 
---
1) There "being no way you're able to do that much damage to someone in PA" using an explosive Lever Action with VATS Crit headshot with a crit build. Also said I had a Lag Switch lol. Guy said he had video proof of what I did and I can't wait until he shows Bethesda the evidence of him just being a salty B.
---
2) There being "no way you're able to do so much damage at once outside of PvP" by spamming Mole Miner Gauntlet modded for bleed + Talons. Guy claims he was in such danger. Yeah, I could've killed him.... Had he just stood there for another 20 seconds without doing anything. Btw, this guy WON MOST OF THE FIGHTS. 
---
Point being I've noticed a lot lately seem to jump to 'hacker' when they don't understand game mechanics. 
---
do you even know what the WoW economy entails? because it's largely backed by actual currency. 10 years ago if you asked someone to trade their rare, Chinese-bought item for gold you'd be laughed at. it's not an opinion, it's a fact.
---
the only ecosystems that last are backed by dollars, like EVE. games that revolve solely around make-believe currency don't last very long nor are the devs inclined to actively stop duping.
---
I would post pic but it’s greyed out
---
Death tambo damage 1star 170 damage 
---
20% reduced damage from target
---
Junkies meat hook 40% more attack power damage 
---
15% less damage blocking and 
---
more damage from more withdrawals 
---
Why the heck are peopole downvoting this?
---
I have found one. One TSE lever action LV 35 and I will never trade it and never stop using it because it's special to me and I NEVER want it duped. I am LV 170 btw with around 500 hours in the game.
---
well duping wouldnt be an issue if people would be decent human beings and not ruin the game. "incompetent developers" whove never made an online game, at least they are trying to fix it, the dupers ate only making it worse. nearly every survival mmo has dupers, just look at Ark, Conan, ect. my point is that people make the choice to dupe and know its not good for the game, but they dont give a shit. so no, im not goi g to be blaming bethesda on this one. thats literally just passing on the blame. 
---
On pc you can drag the slider and it stops at 0, guess you console folks are sol though
---
Lol. At this point I'm just having a laugh at your expense dude. Get well soon, hopefully since Obama made it a crime to not be able to afford health insurance you are covered.
---
Probably ran into a griefer, and is now overly cautious.  I haven't had any problems like that.  Most people I motion over will either ignore it (like they don't understand) or grab it.
---
If we look at this logically, the new space suit is a reskin on the existing space suit which was already two parts.
---
Based on the form fitting nature, the rocket girl space suit is really just a reskin of the Hazmat suit so comes in only one part like the Hazmat. 
---
Maybe they will update the Hazmat/rocket girl base model at some point but I wouldn't expect it unfortunately.
---
Plus it doesn’t affect perception.
---
Really?  Maybe they picked up a MILLION Bobbleheads they thought were found naturally in the world?!
---
It took you longer to angrily type that out (adding absolutely zero to the conversation) than to just answer him. However, that doesn’t give you that self-righteous feeling you crave, does it?   
---
Maybe he’s not in front of the game. Maybe he just likes the social experience of learning through community instead of research. Maybe you don’t have to be a horse’s ass. 
---
bec ppl think its funny when it really isn't get 1shot in pacifist mode and lose your base at the same time, they obv didn't earn all them bobble heads legit\* so why can't they just remove them from players.......having 200,000 halloween candy is 1 thing, but seeing players with over 50,000 bobbleheads is just wrong.
---
It's not a bad item at all, but [it's already in the game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzYLMEws5TM)
---
It's orange in the store, but is that really worth 800 when you can get a chrome one for free?
---
That's what I have as well. Single shot 10mm. Really sucks how no one can play honestly anymore without being accused of crap. 
---
Mine is in the cranberry bog, leeching of thunder mountains power and I’ve got artillery that is in range of the civic centre and I just use it to blast the shit in there for fun
---
$6 for someone to hide a layer on the existing clown suit texture.  
---
$8 to use the paint bucket tool on the existing space suit.  
---
$14 for a PA skin a five year old could make in MS paint.
---
The value offered on these items is Bethesda expressing complete disdain for its player base.
---
To be fair, ginger ale mixes well with everything but tequila
---
Lmao not really, just look at rockstar with gta online and now with rdr, theyre will always be exploits no matter how good the devs are
---
oh im on pc. I'd assume consoles have some kind of cap. pc i guess would just be limited to how much you can fit on your hard drive
---
Thanks Apple, I just nuked the Crashed Space Station!   
---
For those interested: not worth it. A few \~lvl 60 Scorched, and that's it. Nothing special in the flora either, no more abundant than any other open space.
---
The Reconstituted US Army is actively taking recruits in postwar WV.
---
Although, our main task has so far been executing warrants against wanted persons and reestablishing security on 86/87, we also regularly do relief missions that traitorous brotherhood poseurs can’t or don’t want to do.  We’ve given away more than 400lbs of raw material to civilians.
---
The 5th Division is active in Appalachia, despite the best efforts of the reds.
---
/s Gen. Dawson
---
Join the reconstituted US Army today!  Friend me:
---
USArmyGenDawson on XB1
---
Something fun they could do is make them not stackable, that way they take up so many spaces in people’s inventories that their game crashes.
---
i'd need damage numbers pre fireproof, with my legendary armor bonuses, dense mod, fireproof and lone wanderer im only taking 1.2% of whatever you are throwing at me if its explosive. after that reduction it now has to go up against my normal DR value.
---
That’s a nice feature.  So the helmet is removable?
---
This sounds like the only recorded case of too much dakka
---
You can pick up that much stuff in small increments, I’ve picked up shit a duper dropped like that as well. 50000 nuka quantum’s, picked up with 200 at a time, and you just keep doing it. Then I walked over to the water and dropped a very large bag. Why would a person post their own duped items and also show their carry weight if they were guilty? They wouldn’t, unless they’re on YouTube. And OP already stated he didn’t know how to pick it all up to drop it somewhere. The only thing he is guilty of is simply not knowing what to do with a dupers VERY large bag.
---
That same bag is directly under that persons feet, therefore it’s most likely theirs; as that’s how that works in the game, you drop a bag, it’s at your feet. 
---
Yeah 5-10 saved loadouts would help a TON.  Make sure we can name them, and put them in some sort of hot bar.
---
Power Armor Repair Loadout
---
Power Armor Crafting Loadout
---
Bullet Crafting Loadout
---
etc, etc
---
Really want this in-game.  I know they have mods, but for the life of me I'm worried one day Bethesda will say "death to all mods" and I'll catch a ban hammer.....lol
---
Remove the corner roof piece to the right of it. Then place a wall directly under the stairs and attach a roof to the stairs. Lastly remove the stairs, roof and wall in that exact order
---
probably because it encourages buying duped items
---
Also, I *think* that if you add a mod to a “weightless” weapon then the mod isn’t covered by the weightless effect. Not sure though, happened to me with first legendary I got shortly after launch day and I haven’t found a weightless I wanted since
---
same, have a unyielding+cavalier on my melee alt also. both characters can take many hits from everyone who isnt bobbleheaded out (as long as i dont stagger)
---
 i tried telling people in response to "PVP IS BROKEN, TSE=1 SHOT KILLS" posts about how defense vastly outpaces offense in this game, but they dont really listen and still try to tank things in power armor...
---
You said aceplayssss again as if you recognised me before
---
If you don't shoot back it takes them ages to kill you even with explosive weapons. Just log out and find a new server if you meet people like that
---
Nah turns out I was out of cloth
---
I hate that this game is online and I dislike playing with people in general, so I'll gladly flaunt my TSE around.
---
That's the Tricentennial skin.
---
I started doing this since last week. Building a tall room with no roof to amplify the sound makes for some extra fun
---
GENERAL
---
Its more of how delayed their response was.  Any other AAA dev of an online game would have a hotfix pushed within 48 hours.  Bethesda waited weeks before attempting to fix the issue and failed in its first 2 attempts.  Even now, they still havent ckosed the door completely but the new exploit is less reliable and requires 3 people to make it work.
---
I love that bobble heads sounds like a drug. 
---
“If you see someone that you think is on bobble heads, stay FAR away from them!” 
---
Found those the other night, they are fun and they fly far. Sucks you can't reload.
---
We also desperately need a "thank you" emote. Why this wasn't included or even in the store is beyond me. I find myself needing it more than any other emote except for "Hi".
---
lol- i'm at work reading this thread going "Where's the m-f'n link to pics?"
---
That's what I'm saying, the explosive damage is just icing on the cake. Since the Gauss rifle does such high damage already. I don't rely on the explosions from it, that is one of the 5 ways I'm buffing my weapon damage.
---
And yet we still have legendary effin pipe wrenches to fix those legendary effin sink leakages.
---
I have only encountered one dyed-in-the-wool asshole that was blatantly attacking my camp. I lock all my stuff up, but I have a tent with a bed and cooking station outside my main house for passers. My house is on a cliff. Easy to get to when coming from the correct direction, but a waste of time for anyone looking to be a jerk. I play on Xbox and have met mostly friendly people. Most of the time when I get pvp’d im laughing, so that’s good I guess.
---
Vats in this game with respect to melee essentially has a weaker version of Blitz from Fallout 4 by default
---
Oh good, another set of butt ugly paints for Power Armor. Just what I wanted! /s
---
It's your new main weapon lol
---
Someone getting a Bounty. The response you get from the guy who witnesses you spraying their C.A.M.P down. Can Bounty hunters kill you or not. Will they revenge if you kill them, etc. 
---
A pirate hat you say?  I'm one step closer to my Bloodborne melee costume.
---
You're correct. For me though, I am more concerned about how it helps or hurts my gameplay.
---
haha i’m sticking to my two shot shotgun for now 😂
---
Why not just buy weapons in game with caps and not on some other website if that’s even a thing. I’m just saying it’s duper’s behind that and it’s just destroying the economy by purchasing things from dupers
---
That space suit looks like PJs to me instead.  The PA paint makes me wonder if the devs are high...  the Christmas one was bad enough.  Why would you even put something so ugly up for sale?
---
Hang on to it if you have the space. The meta will probably change and you might end up with a nice build for it. That has to be a pretty rare drop. 
---
I've tackled this issue from every possible angle so I'll just say: everyone else is having fun with their duped shit. it's mostly just here, in this sub, that people are salty.
---
have fun.
---
To put this to a finer point.........
---
My friend is currently looking for a Gatling Gun, and he wants:
---
Bloody or Furious or Two Shot
---
Faster Fire Rate
---
90% Weight Reduction
---
Good luck trying to find that.  400+ hours in and neither of us has seen one.  I'm a veteran trader on the trading reddits and have yet to see ANYONE with one of those up for sale, trade, etc.  So it's just not me finding that gun, it's the entire trading community....lol
---
Eh, having a quick look at the Quest and Events section, there's no mention of the changes said here.  
---
\&gt; **“Get the Supply Drop”**: “Get the Supply Drop” Event now  will remove holotape once used with supply crate belonging to the player  that requested the Supply Drop.   
---
Reading it, it makes sense that it's only for the player who requested it, but they don't mention the Bounty at all, being two months into the game where anyone could get the supplies and everyone is used to it being like that, you would think Beth' would explain that change a little better, ah well, Beth' gonna Beth I suppose.
---
if you get the right gear, defense&gt;&gt;offense. it usually takes more than 10 hits from a TSE weapon to kill me
---
(assuming they arent stacking hundreds or thousands of bobbleheads)
---
I thought it was Fireproof 3 and Dense mod
---
You could simulate it with the Bloody Mess perk card.
---
RNGesus hasn’t been good to me, but boy when he strikes...
---
this is the second explosive i’ve ever picked up. 
---
To be honest, I don’t even what that much stuff. Its just all Junk which weighs a lot 
---
It depends on the alcohol, I wouldn't put white rum or vodka in ginger ale. Sure it might "work" bit in my opinion the flavors just aren't complex enough, so it just tastes like I dumped rubbing alcohol in it. 
---
That said, complex flavors is a bit of a moot point. We're talking about Nuka Dark rum lol
---
The tambo simply has a higher base damage than the meat hook, thats all
---
Is that a serious question? Sounds to me like we are all looking forward to hearing about your ban. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Thank you for something half decent lmao 
---
Cryolators are great for the queen. They prevent her from flying even after mutation. My fastest queen kill of 2 minutes had a lot to do with a team freezing her to the ground 
---
Psh. Fuck the stealthyarchy!
---
I wasn't encouraging buying duped items. 
---
I bought my TSE, it isn't a dupe. 
---
Contrary to popular belief, there are actually TSE weapons out there that were legitimately found on legendary creatures.
---
I don't know for sure on this either, but if it's true that's an interesting bit of info. I have not tested or heard whether they convert to purely explosive.
---
You're still buying weapons in game just making sure you buy something good instead of randomly asking every player to trade and then convincing them to sell their good stuff
---
My camp is located between the top of the world train station and silo alpha. Near where the plant icon is on the map. There's a nice little pond with a boat and a cove that I built on. In the middle of the pond you can put an acid extractor down, I like it here.
---
two shot explosive
---
Understandable lol
---
Just by playing the game I've amassed like 4. But I bought the blackbird armor paint, the astroturf, the red rocket garage door and a couple other camp items. Just waiting for some actually interesting cosmetics. Im a sucker for camp lights
---
Some are "bosses" - they have a crown on their head.  But that's just a bunch of loot, not chems.  The ones that drop like 3x2 chems we call drug dealer ghouls.
---
Mine is insanely bright (PC). It washes out a lot of detail. There is only the headlamp mod for the excavator, no bright ones. 
---
The paint doesn't "trail off" at the knees, the paint changes colors to represent his boots.

One's weight in screws can buy many weights of springs...

---
yes we need this so bad! Any griefers trying to kill me will get sent on a little flying lesson
---
Thats called a compromise and its a rare thing. You get the best of both worlds let the dupers dupe and players that dont really arnt affected.
---
Well, the point of the skin is to make your power armor look like an action figure :P, look at the screws on the arms.
---
Not really, you don't need a second person for the actual transfer, but you need a second person to be on the party so you can jump back.  Just make a friend.
---
Baller. 🌑🌑
---
That's you, but for a lot of people enjoying the game and spending hundreds of hours playing it. does make it a good game. It's completely subjective. No one, not you, not me nor anyone else can tell someone else how much fun they are having  
---
I spent $60 on the game, I have well over 300 hours in and a lot more to go. That is a lot of mileage for my $60 and, from my perspective, that makes it a good game. 
---
Its actually gotten a lot better than when I first got on today.
---
Go to challenges and look at the 'play for 7600 hours'
---
The point of my comment was to stay away from websites like that

Alright, you had a shitty experience. But that in no way compares to Ark. In Ark, PvE servers are shit because it boils down to a massive dino parking lot and griefers there block resource nodes. PvP features bored alpha tribes that grief everyone, except in that game it is done just because. You lose everything. Hours, days, months even disappears and evaporates in an instant and there you are, back naked on the beach with absolutely nothing.
---
Bethesda did PvP significantly better than Ark. you do not lose everything, hell you keep your weapons, armor, stash, etc. We are damn lucky that junk is all we lose, because without that mechanic we quickly devolve into Ark status - a lawless land where higher level players and giant tribes are downright cruel to everyone. 
---
hmm...perhaps when i get more mods for it from scrapping the damage will be better. then i’ll have to give her a spin on the SBQ
---
&gt; seem to jump to 'hacker' when they don't understand game mechanics.
---
agree.  it's pathetic and entertaining at the same time.
---
have you actually used the thing? I think it's bugged and there's no icy mist, just invisible projectiles that explode.
---
it's a bummer getting an explosive gatling laser and seeing that the pew pew is gone.
---
Tenchu all the way!
---
Did you actually look at the space suit? Completely different models. Also, the point of the power armor skin was to make the PA look like a child's action figure, look at the screws on the arms. 
---
I want to like the new PA paint because it's at least somewhat creative and unique, but yeah it's definitely not worth $14. Prices *are getting better,* but I personally haven't been able to stomach it yet and haven't spent any Atoms in a while ( haven't paid with real money either ).
---
Hopefully they'll find a sweet spot? Maybe? Eventually?
---
no legendary effects like assassin or sentinel, and no dense which GREATLY reduces explosive damage (ive seen people testing and say it reduces explosive damage around 60% but i dont have an exact number).
---
I’m too scared too lol
---
Me too, I'm not super good at it... But this one in particular is just about replacing one file and it just works! 
---
i have tested it out, i see mist. i don’t have the crystallizing barrel yet. 
---
I feel like you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Call it a gut feeling.
---
Wow great info thx. All I've wanted to do is just explore and the grind is killing it. 
---
The thing is slap damage when you don't engage in PvP is a percentage of the damage the other player does to you. So if it's 5% and they hit you for 100 you only take 5 damage.
---
Because for some reason bobbleheads can stack, players are getting up to hundreds of thousands of damage so the 5% can still one shot you.
---
Duplicating and allowing bobbleheads to stack are the two things enabling this, they're addressing dupes with each patch so I'd expect a bobblehead adjustment soon.
---
The alternative which would be far better in my opinion given how PvP is supposed to work is to set slap damage to a specific amount instead of a percentage. Slap damage should be 5hp per hit no matter what and then it doesn't matter how people inflate their damage unless you engage.
---
76 needs PvP and Co-Op servers
---
How are you trying? My camp is on the toxic water by the Grafton Dam, swimming in that untill I have 80 percent rads has given me mutations 1 in 3 times I've tried. 
---
At the end of day no one uses it for damage, just the freezing effect 
---
Ugh that sucks. I feel like if they made three star guaranteed it would lessen the need for duping.
---
Xbox One, after patch today. I claimed Spruce Knob workshop and defended it. I set up a lot of turrets. Radrats attacked and the turrets did nothing. Radrats attacked the turrets directly and they did not fire. 
---
Are you server hopping after each mutation? I think that’s what you have to do. I was trying to get the marsupial mutation yesterday but I stopped getting mutations after I removed egg head because I didn’t server hop.
---
I see the Good and the Bad, but you skipped the Ugly.
---
You probably dont know but there is a time limit on them . Cant recall but its something like 1.5 hrs.
---
You have to server hop if you want another one in succession.
---
Precisely my thinking. If it happens again I'm going to go to the darkside
---
Carrying a duped weapon, even if you traded it, is no way to earn trust. Learn to live with it.
---
Shoots udders?
---
r/fo76
---
I think the weapons skins are super cool, but it's a bit of a bummer that they've been releasing them for specific weapons instead of sets. 
---
true, i’ve never considered using a cryolator in 76 tbh 😂 even for freezing.
---
Cool stuff. My perception is only 4. I may do a new  character with a focus on sniping with melee for up close.
---
Two Shot Explosive
---
There's a challenge for all the holotapes, so that's where you got the atoms from.  The quest it's self is related to the overseer's caches.
---
What did Preson Gravy ever do to you?
---
Notice them teasing the SS  outfit in the pirate hat pictures.
---
Well share some of that fun, give me all your explosive bobbleheads
---
Really?? I forgot about those, thanks!
---
oh wow, really? that's pretty cool, then. the only downside is that explosives seem "bugged" with energy weapons and deal less damage, I think.
---
I'd keep it regardless. it's a good roll.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Doesn’t sound like a bad move but I’m thinking some method where getting mutations every time or every second time 
---
^This. All of this. ^
---
Building and crafting is my favorite thing to do in the game, and I’m tired of losing junk, even in passive mode, simply bc I have no place to store it
---
Inspiring me to try out the same on an alt. :)
---
Neither did I until that SBQ run I spoke about earlier 
---
Stand in a uranium deposit and you're guaranteed to get one. Server hop after you get one and you'll be able to get another right away.
---
It's better if you world hop, there's supposedly a time limit in between gaining new mutations.
---
Also, be sure to remove any armor that may have any rad resistance and be sure that you don't have the Starched Genes perk equipped.
---
Basically what it boils down to
---
THIS.  Also PSA as soon as she has enters the Whitespring Bunker the first time and does the little "orientation" Enclave Quests start popping up.  I didnt want to go right to end game so I was still just grinding and side questing, occasionally doing Enclave Quests as they popped up and killing the occasional SB.  Someone had told me I was wasting my time because I hadn't gone to Camp Mclintock yet.  I shrugged my shoulders because I was just doing them for XP anyway.  Then when I finally went to McClintock and returned to the bunker, I checked the rank status computer, then went back to Modus and he said "Welcome, General."  I was already done without even trying!
---
Maybe they weren't watching you. Maybe they gave thumps down, because they didn't need the weapons or thought they were bad, and ran away to do other things.
---
Since there is kinda PvP, like anyone can kill you if they shoot you hundred times, especially lower level players are just more cautious before they know the game.
---
Lol, mine currently is... But trying to make it fair !
---
He dropped it. Happy treasure hunting, hope you’ve got aquaboy or girl. 
---
Player trading when done right is an absolutely amazing addition to a game. Look at Star Wars Galaxies for an actual good implementation of player trading. The materials you crafted with and the crafting process determined the outcome and quality of an item. The world was divided into traditional "MMO" type servers which you couldn't just change between. There were actual persistent player homes and literal guild towns that were there even while the players were not.
---
FO76 has failed at "doing it right" from its inception.
---
1. There aren't enough players in a world to realistically encounter anyone if you're not trying to. Everyone is in their own corner of the world doing their own thing.
---
2. There is no player persistence, every time you sign in you are with a different group of up to 23 strangers. Therefore, no one can build a reputation as a good trader, good crafter or hell even as a raider to be avoided.
---
3. Without the above two points, there is no in-game mechanism to advertise goods to anyone not within earshot or in another world. The chances that someone currently in your world wants the sweet 3-star Boxing Glove you have are very very low, less so that anyone you actually meet up with does.
---
4. Everybody can do everything anyway. You want to be a superior power armor mechanic? Well too bad, everyone can learn the plans, swap in the 200% perks and easily equip a 1\* Unyielding armor set. Currently the actual PA plans are rare and a few players are ahead of the curve but that will flatten out with time.
---
5. Crafted items are literally worthless. A piece of shit 1\* Exterminator's legendary is strictly "better" than the same item made by a player.
---
6. Storage space is too limited. There's no way anyone is going to hold on to a 2nd tier legendary item because it's too hard to sell and not worth the inventory space in the meantime. This is why everyone selling significant quantities has mules or even a 2nd account right now.
---
Ohhhh that makes sense. Cheers mate 👍
---
Ballistic fiber: please allow us to craft higher level leather armor without it. There is not enough of it in the game world.
---
XBL is having problems right now so that could be part of it
---
There's nothing wrong with trading online, just trading for cash. You can totally be a merchant, the real dupers already moved onto real money. You can definitely sell SOME stuff to random players. Water, food, stims, chems, ammo... Farm the leader of the pack event to sell legendaries to noobs if you want to feel like you're really moving inventory
---
Sounds good. Btw if it's around this time right now, I will be available for about 3 - 4 hours
---
That could get fun, honestly. Who knows what twisted experiments will emerge to challenge the 76 kids.
---
Just saying it has the amount you've already played next to it
---
Because bobble heads is the only problem with duping?
---
Ark generates some salt no doubt, but in that game other players enact downright cruelty on each other that even the worst experience in Fallout comes no where close to. One thing I will say is that PvE is dumb in that game, PvP is brutal. They need a happy medium in there somewhere - I like to think with some FO76 mechanics Ark wouldn’t be so bad. Stash box, your house/dinos going with you when offline, pacifist protection, etc. Until then, Ark remains a downright demoralizing experience.
---
Yeah I immediately re-specced into Fireproof, it does indeed make it possible to survive one hit from a TSE rifle (technically two "hits" and still not a shotgun with its 7 or 8 "hits").
---
The thing is non-PA wearers can also use Fireproof so it's not like this levels the playing field.
---
YOU KNOW WHAT FUCK MOLE RATS YOU I LIKE TO BUILD ON THE GROUND BECAUSE I CANT STAND, THOSE STRUCTURES THAT ARE AN AFFRONT TO GOD WITH ONE OT TWO FOUNDATIONS! AND A STAIR HOLDING UP A MF! MANSION!! IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT BETHESDA!? YOU WANT ME TO DEFILE GRAVITY AND LOGIC BECAUSE A MOLE RAT BROKE PASS A STEEL WALL!!
---
Uhg sorry thats what i meant. 
---
This coconut flavored crap isn't even in the same league as a quality scotch.
---
Ha true story 
---
Looking deeper into it, it *seems* to be the same suit but cleaner. The in-game version looks like it's ripped and has a harness ( emergency landing gear? ). I'm assuming it's to fit into the whole crash scene over there.
---
IMO, still not worth the 800 tag. It does look cool though.
---
They don’t on Xbox, as someone startled me when they came out of it next to me at a train station.
---
You’re literally mad at Ark for being a hardcore survival game.
---
I don’t get it?
---
Well I only retaliate... I shouldn't be punished because I like a certain weapon.
---
I've seen for sale by a vendor before 
---
Yes, i was going to mention that.  If they do implement this, the same patch could fix scorchbeasts to scream less and land more often.  But it only applies to normal schorchbeasts =P
---
How??
---
I sent you a request, I also made a chat with everyone whos replied so im sure there will always be someone else as well active that you can run with even with the time diff
---
Its fun seeing players cool camps
---
i do, but if it gives any context, it was my friends last time playing we wanted to do smthn extra. 
---
fingers crossed but i have a plain early days xb1 and I am almost shocked at how much better it is so far.  I've had a 90 minute session and a 60 minute session and no crashes, freezes, or disconns.
---
I don't dare count my chickens before they hatch, but cautiously hopeful at this point.
---
**THE UGLY:**
---
* **The prices.**
---
It doesnt really mess them up.  I was just exploring when I inadvertently started Bunker Buster.  Then I did the Rose line, then completed Bunker Buster and started the Brotherhood line.  The only thing that gets weird is the segues from each questline to the next occur even though I had already done the "next quest" first.  I happened on the abandoned waste dump accidentally while "seeking revenge" on a TSE griefer whose camp was next to it.
---
If you get a craft Ginger ale where you really taste the Ginger, vodka really elevates it.
---
This is why my base is a solid brick bunker with a keypad access door as the only entrance. No windows obviously. I have my business and other people have theirs. I don't want anybody in my base except me. ever. I only meet people out on my front porch to trade or sell items, but as soon as business is done I'm back inside with powered doors closing behind me. Don't even ask to join my team either, and I'm not giving the code so stop asking!
---
This works great on open, flat land. If there are trees or other obstacles, the SB will continue to fly around spamming.
---
Lucky,  I  crashed after about 2 hours online
---
My friends and I see this all the time - I built a fighting arena and we tried a number of approaches with the intent of finding something that worked with the game as-is and was still fun.  Didn't quite get there, but in the process so many times I'd hear "Your health is at zero!  What the hell, just die!" and I'd have 2/3 or 3/4 health showing.  He'd screenshot, he was right, I was right.  in the end, my actual health is the only correct one - so the game is still regularly fucking up when it comes to PvP damage.
---
Come find me at Grafton ;)
---
Pretty smooth for me so far. Though I did find two glitches.
---
One: When selling things and reducing the quantity of what I'm selling it now moves the cursor past 1 all the way around to the max amount of items without stopping now. So be careful because it doesn't stop when holding the stick to the left.
---
Two: Bots on Parade - Mole Miners spawned and were friendly. Only about 7-8 spawned and pretty much just stood there doing nothing.
---
Other than that it's been a much better experience stability wise.
---
I actually went the back way, chasing the clues about the white locker that's key locked down to Watoga. It's a fun little unmarked quest.
---
I am so tempted to get this too.
---
Duping is or will be fixed. The next part is solving the "5k bobbleheads" like the OP mentioned.
---
True to an extent but Ive never used bobbleheads and I can 1 shot people in power armor. The real key to balancing tse is picking the right perks and armor for defense of it and it doesnt do anymore damage than a regular gun
---
Oh, it’s just a little shack set up that looks like a giant version of her little stand. Most I am gunna try and get is he neon signs. This character isn’t even going to do missions unless that is what is needed to help the person feel better.
---
Going to set up basic things like water purifiers and food for people to collect. I want to save all of my budget for peoples needs. 
---
I want to keep it as true to the original Lucy’s booth as I can. Thanks though.
---
Be safe.
---
I did exercise a bit of hyperbole here.
---
If you look really close at the PA skin though I stand by my statement, non-hyperbolic, that a five year old could make that in MS paint. The screws are literally circles with crosses in them.
---
You promise not to just shoot me?
---
Same way you lock a door
---
I feel for you. I put it off until I was lvl 25. Today I logged in and saw no one was in the area so I fast travelled in to nab it.  It's much easier when the ghouls aren't levelled up to other players. 
---
You're either gonna have to ask a friend or track down one of the middlemen
---
Ghoul Slayers Groknaks Axe
---
As much of a dumpster fire as Second Life is they DID have some great furniture....
---
I’m aware. It’s the difference between repair and replace. Right now, you can’t repair all in CAMPs, you can only replace what’s broken
---
I don't wear Power Armor to get through silos. I've never soloed one though - in the area with the high rads, I just share Rank 3 of Rad Sponge and pop a few diluted radaway if needed.
---
Do you know how much Xp glowing ghouls give now i think was 400 + before.
---
&gt;incompetent developers" who've never made an online game,
---
The Elder Scrolls Online has been ongoing for multiple years now.  Bethesda absolutely has made a successful online game.  The main difference between the two?  TESO was not just a port of Skyrim with netcode haphazardly thrown in the mix.  It was actually a modified engine crafted with the expressed interest of online gaming.
---
Soooo...  How do you propose that the developers are not responsible for the state of the game they released?
---
I mean even ignoring the fact Beth released an online game before, how exactly would it not be there fault that they shipped out a subpar quality game that could be exploited by a few at the expense of others? 
---
Just make it so their effects don't stack, boom
---
Brilliant!
---
That's a fair point, maybe I'll try ginger beer instead. It has a strong flavour.
---
hahahahah
---
Yes, I do :(
---
upvoted for the info.  I got my first set from the Watoga vendor, someone must have sold theirs.  With my charisma and perks it was about 1,300 or so caps for the whole set.
---
Wouldn't that be great for PvP? Freeze them solid before you give a nice bonk on the head?
---
That was an example, anyway.
---
Western is the best followed by the .44 and the single action is niche.   
---
Why ? because of numbers. 
---
Oh no, I have a quasi-masochist side that enjoys Ark. I play Ark because it is that way, it’s brutal and glitchy but oh so addictive. However, I do not play FO76 for that experience. 
---
This game...as much as I LOVE the fallout series is a total bust. Worse than any game I've encountered...its a shame I had high hopes. Nonetheless Outer Worlds looks awesome. Nice to see NPCS
---
Is it? That's a bit odd to reuse the enclave star symbol
---
Doesnt hurt anyone? It's been wrecking the whole game in a bunch of ways. And entitled whiners like you are mostly to blame. 
---
I've been waiting for that mask since it was datamined =P  Yay!
---
And typewriters.
---
The only thing I disliked was the 800 tag for a simple retexture. I personally don't mind retextures, but not when they get pricey.
---
Like the Blackbird looks great! But I really didn't want to spend 1800 Atoms on it because I know that not a lot of work went into that skin since it's just a recolor. 
---
I chose not to care. I’m sorry.
---
There is no need for duping 
---
This is a long shot but I really like this paint job and have been struggling to find T-51 armor though. If any Xbox players have and extra parts they can spare I'll accept anything. If you need something for trade I'll try to compensate you. Thanks. My Xbox gt is Kaylila. Msg me there or here. 
---
Just buy them from players. The farming thing is for the bird ..... bones....
---
It is the core of the loot chase. A dash of trash, a sprinkle of wood armor bits and some R N G magic  
---
Marine wetsuit and tactical helm=gimp suit
---
Destroyed someone’s base for the same reason the other day (like the whole base) quad explosive shot gun to the rescue lol
---
usually it does disappear but another player can pretty easily find you if they use vats
---
Nope, but I do love watching other people run gleefully over to them.
---
Defending the only defendable part about the Atom Shop update is painful to watch. What a lonely battle this one is. Sure the spacesuit is a new item, but barely. Same as the PA. The only real PA paints that stand out as of yet are the Hotter Rod ones which required most players to spend irl $ to cover the high point cost. The Xmas one barely stand out against the other red/white based Nuka Cola paint job. Most of the dev room paints aren’t very impressive. I’ve already seen all of them through a dev room leak and the Atom Cats is the best and only one in there that’s worth acquiring. Not even any of the 8 or more BoS paints stood out. Sure they have a couple tiny details, but it all about looks the same. Just like most all other items the AS offers.
---
Good on you for trying to help out! I get some looks with my TSE lever action. But I am always in pacifist mode and always have a mic. I usually say hi or even send a message to them. I'm about level 61, but I've barely done any missions. Just playing around and helping out. 
---
So we go from the hot wheels look to even more kiddie toy look - what’s the audience for the game?  Like 5 year olds?
---
This is a legit post.  The above account has not only talked to most 76 users, but he asked all of them.  So just forget what you have been saying or thinking cause you are wrong and OP knows the truth since he knows everything.
---
To the guy who (unlikely thing/ assumption) you're the (worst/best) thing to happen to fallout. Also dupes are bad mmmkay.
---
Can I get my front page 76 spot now?
---
That's fine, I'm just curious if it's accurate given some of the other responses I'm getting it would appear so. 
---
It kind of us. There's a bit of a cascade of bugs that makes bobbleheads break everything.
---
Yep. Someone hit Whitesprings last night. How "original" idiots.    
---
Got one level in about 3 hours. Things were only giving at best 170 xp each. Drops were pitiful. Got some Assassin's Sickle and I don't pvp. The more you have to play the better it is for BGS or any who makes online games.
---
Scorchbeasts are the most poorly designed enemy I have ever encountered in any game.
---
It will be nice and quick. You can trust me!
---
Call it the Watoga Whacker or something. And have it be in Watoga.
---
I posted about this last month. Glad I’m not the only one.
---
Oh ok. I just follow them for the most part but that is good to know
---
Unless you have a friend you can trust, no.    
---
Otherwise you're at the risk of some stranger taking it.
---
Go to West Tek or Huntersville or any other Super Mutant camp. Loot the meat bags and you should get plenty of acid.
---
It (the rocketsuit) offered protection in 4, though.
---
Yeah, I can understand if one or two is made specifically for the weapon, but look at the chrome minigun. That can easily be repurposed for any weapon
---
🤔 would help with those pesky marsupials
---
Why not just put a hard weight limit on a person? Like you can only be overweight by 200 - afterwards you are not allowed to trade, interact with objects or move at all and stats like health, hunger and thirst get severely hindered.
---
Almost every time I google something on F076 it comes to the subreddit first
---
"I’m betting most downvoters will be sympathizers or duper’s themselves. But that’s fine by me."
---
Or people who have seen a hundred other suggestions on how to fix duping, are tired of the pointless suggestions, and think your suggestion is a bad idea that won't actually fix anything or have any positive impact on the game.
---
Y'know, or what you said. Who knows. 
---
How do you know it's not a dupe
---
I swear it's not a set time either, I can kill one &amp; watch it explode seconds after it dies, kill another watch it, watch it, not exploding so move towards it &amp; then boom!
---
Hello fellow raider. Need any jet? Karma is a weak ass drug
---
I was farming Phoenix in Watoga and every now and then I'd see this guy in PA doing the same.
---
this one time I spawn and he's already there, except there's a group of Protectrons coming up with a legendary in the middle. I blow them up and check the loot, nothing good, so I back up. the guy though, he checks the legendary and goes back to Phoenix, who's standing right next to their bodies.
---
needless to say, I picked up a decent number of screws and hopped servers.
---
Well bobbleheads sounds like a big problem that for sure be addressed.  If they addressed that before other duped items I probably wouldn't be upset.  But they really should look at all items and not just bobbleheads.
---
So one bullet essentially hits twice AND explodes?
---
Also if your rifle/heavy gun and you have the perk that adds stagger, staggering it in air will overwrite the landing sequence until the stagger timer runs out, if you just keep staggering it, it just keeps changing direction back and forth in the air but it will not land.
---
I see the stagger issue more at the SBQ where she doesnt attack or land and just keeps flipping back and forth.
---
Tl;dr stagger in air bad on SB/SBQ, stagger + cryolater on ground good.
---
There is if you can’t get a decent weapon...
---
Oh well?
---
I've been to at least 3 other large Fo76 communities and reddit is by far the most anal. definitely the only one to even bring dupers up outside of the "give me free shit" context, at least.
---
I think you are just unlucky. I have found several legendary telsas that are awesome, mole gauntlets, exploding combat shotgun. And a double shot explosive dragoon. Though the last one sucks more then you would think and is prettymuch unusable because it breaks in like three shots.
---
Meh.
---
Wake me when there's a big-ass beard that you can adjust the color on.
---
Probably. If you want a legendary melee, go to watoga.
---
Errr... ok
---
It is today, 15 Jan. 
---
I was with the guy when it dropped.
---
Cmon - if someone has 5000 bobble heads just ban them already!
---
Even simpler, when in pacifist mode not only negate my damage to other players but negate their damage to me.
---
I did the same build and shifted to rifle due to pistol builds not having a “Tank Killer” version perk. 
---
Got a 3-star Instigating Dragon on a random run through Whitesprings. Wasn't even farming really, just trying to find those unruly golfer ghouls. My first and only 3-star gear at level 44; now level 47 and I recently almost one-shot a scorchbeast with it. Combat shotgun with enforcer did the rest.
---
Where are you on the map?
---
Have you gone to the trading sub? 
---
Most likely a higher level player was in the area and caused those enemies to spawn. 
---
This is easy, don't hit or shoot them.
---
Use Vats if they are all around and pay attention not to hit any. If you can't find a clear or safe shot, just leave that kill for them, easy decision when you know the consequences.
---
Worst case, it's a server hop but it really isn't that hard to avoid.
---
They weight .25 pounds each. Might want to wipe your ass more throughly lol
---
Just fought the scorched beast twice on ps4 and got 8 acid as my reward for one, and some meat from the other one. I got better loot from the other scorched creatures 
---
I’m not sure that would work out considering all of the QoL perks in the game.
---
It wouldn't be so bad if my fucking turrets would start shooting and/or if their levels scaled up.  Turrets are the biggest joke in this game, especially missions against level 50 scorchbeasts where your goal is to defend a level 35 turret.  Like what the fuck.
---
Damn, I forgot all about those. I am going to have to find them...
---
Lvl 25/PC player. I've been griefed a few times by high lvl players. I run solo and moved CAMP onto cliff between Top of the World and Harper's Ferry. I map watch constantly to avoid HLPs because I don't know their intentions. They can suck the fun out of a good game! However, it's their prerogative to play how THEY want to play. I can't wait to lvl up enough to come out of hiding to watch a nuke up close, help other LLPs, etc. Maybe I'm scarred...
---
Ah I see, just thought it wouldn't make sense for guns to be controlled by the fda 
---
Really? Today I played and the server felt way more laggy, stuff taking way more time to spawn into containers / corpses, I've also had a lot of trouble with enemy spawns since the new patch, enemies spawning into the floor a lot being the main issue, but usually when they do spawn into the floor their corpse "meat pile" is below the floor so you can't loot it.
---
My new character is a Vats critical pistol build.
---
.44 magnum with scope for sneaky snipes
---
10mm for up close
---
Black powder for a little punch
---
I’m really enjoying it. My other character is a Rifle/shotgun. So it’s really different.
---
Doesn’t melt everything but I can handle mobs really well with my vat perks.
---
So I don’t think you’re screwed. Maybe drop the shotgun perks and invest in vats? Works really well up close
---
Mayor for a Day in watoga gives you All Rise, you get Daisycutter from a questline too. Those are pretty much the only story legendaries that matter
---
Yeah I agree it’s just with dupers it ruins the point of the game why buy a TSE suppresses shotty if I can buy it online or from someone with cash instead of grinding to get caps to pay it. It takes the whole point out of it
---
I shot a ghoul close to me when I got mine because all I saw was the effect "ghoul slayer".
---
I was very confused.
---
My suggestion is that it scales based off the player getting attacked's health, not the damage dealt.
---
What’s the legendary and where’s Watoga? I’ve explored almost all of the map and it can be confusing to find specific places 
---
🤘🏽
---
If you are on PC i can do it. I'm at max capacity and don't want your shit so no worries there! What weapon for it? I have a low level SMG i've been trying to unload.
---
Can I try this thing? I heard it works only on this subreddit.
---
So there i was, it was me and my buddy the server was taking a beating so I looked around the map. And what do i see? __TWO__ white dots next to each other. I said to my buddy, we got asses to kick and gum to chew and we're all out of gum. So we arrive and the two dots were OBVIOUSLY DUPERS. We used our advanced tactical knowledge and sneaked around the dupers and called insulted their mothers in voice chat. The dupers thought we were IRL ghosts and pee-d their pants. We kept our insults about their whore mothers at full blast until the dupers decided to leave the server. But before they left, they called me and my buddy a duper hunting _BADASS__.
---
Definitely xbox. 
---
It's pretty bs trying to solo monsters meant to 50+ levels during leveling. One option would be to check the levels of players in your world. Maybe hop if you are the lowest etc. Or simply group up with friends/randoms
---
#edgy &amp; #original 
---
Where’s daisy cutter?
---
The asshole that leveled her base actually SOUNDS LIKE a duper.  They are the ones who are usually running around with the god like weapons (attained through duping) and fucking with people for no reason. Not to mention a Minigun drains ammo extremely fast, and there is no way he could  be consistently pulling this stunt unless her were duping ammo. 
---
Like I said, the guy who did this sounds like a duper. 
---
This is where someone says "you are just jealous of people with better gear than you."  
---
No, it's not a question of jealously. It's a matter of hear this straight from a duper. His exact words were "nearly all explosive weapons in this game are duped."  
---
Well that’s why I made this suggestion. They apparently can’t physically see the fact that they have 5k bobbleheads.
---
But they can see who goes into the dev room and takes stuff.
---
Sounds like super mutant and scorchbeast dupers.  Gosh darn they're everywhere now. 
---
There seems to be a second mini-load after the initial load in - maybe that has something to do with it
---
dont believe that stuff is true unless maybe theres another trick to it
---
my friend has bobbleheaded up to 400k damage and it does the same amount of slap per hit as when i try to spam slap damage with a switchblade. seem slike a cap on hp per hit on slap, but i never respond to those threads because people jump down each others throats
---
Aren't the Zetans in the official guidebook
---
Robot companions - just as customizable - still have the massive inventory.. all the guns.. *all* of it
---
Can’t tell what exactly was said in the original comment but I assume it was something about two shot. Is it for sure that it only does one extra pellet worth of damage? Because a TSE shows in the menu doing way more damage than a non TS explosive. I don’t have one of each to test it myself though. 
---
If this has been discussed somewhere I couldn’t find it but feel free to point me in the right direction please. 
---
Combine the constant attacks with bullet sponge enemies and I'm about fucking done with the game. I fast travel back to my camp, low on ammo and working weapons, and then spend 10 fucking minutes running around my camp and away from it because super mutants are barely fazed by .45 caliber and .308 bullets to the face. It's bullshit. 
---
I think if you put crafting mats in your STASH they are accessible from work benches anywhere. Just so you know. 
---
Yessssssssssssss 
---
Can’t you repair all from the little camp machine?
---
Fresh server perhaps, if it was shortly after the servers came back up after the update this could be the reason. Also a high level player could have been in the areas and triggered enemies to spawn but just ran through without killing them.
---
Then I'm not sure what the point of all this is. 
---
it's decent as a starter weapon for a bloodied alt, but you'll ultimately want that, a bloodied one.
---
I forgot yesterday.  Fucking liberators flying around like mosquitos, and I swat down the legendary, turn to deal with the others and then boom.
---
&gt; Hotter Rod
---
Yeah this skin was great... on the X-01 that was pictured in the Atom Shop. The T-51, T-60 and T-45 versions were awful.
---
Came to play for the first time since patch. 2 crashes in a row leaving the station at Watoga, just outside Watoga High School. The game is unplayable on PS4 post patch. :(
---
Yeah, 50% too. 
---
Savage
---
As far as I understand anything with the “scorch” modifier becomes a creature even if the base thing is considered an animal. I.E Scorch Deathclaws, scorch dogs, etc. are not tameable.
---
except you forgot that The Elder Scrolls Online Was DEVELOPED BY Zenimax Online Studios and PUBLISHED by Bethesda Softworks. so youre literally talking about shit you know nothing about. hahahahaha
---
Love it!  Thank you for sharing will add with the next edit 
---
I did for a while.    Then I just outgrew the damage output by being able to use slugger perks and All Rise.
---
Oxhorn Lore videos
---
As far as I know, no weapon has a legendary modifier of +40% damage. So I think you are misinterpreting something
---
The Scorched Smacker.
---
Not surprising that the suit was upgraded or a better version found 210 years later really...
---
Nuka Cola crafting station, forgot its actual name, from the nuka world dlc.
---
I reckon the percentage of people with actual legitimate TSE’s is well under 1% of the people that own them. Then around a 70/30 split of people that have either bought a duped version for a few thousand caps (whether they believe it was duped or not) and then the duper’s themselves. 
---
So probability wise, everyone you have encountered has been illegitimate. 
---
but please continue to tell me how im wrong, by all means.
---
It's the gutsies and sentry bots that get me sometimes. I'll be chatting away with someone not paying attention then get rocked  
---
It reads 40% more attack power damage 
---
You get the "Perfect Storm" from the Cold Case quest, pretty ok SMG.
---
"All Rise", arguably one of the best melee weapons in the game, from Mayor for a Day.
---
Others include a cool Leather Chest from the Morgantown Responder questline, the "Last Bastion" from the Enclave questline, and a cool Combat Armor Chest from the Free States questline.
---
&gt;you can also target specific types of damage an get more defense against both energy and ballistic damage in regular armor with perks than you can with power armor
---
Not as far as I've seen.  If you mean damage reduction outside of DR and ER numbers, sure, but highest level power armor provides way more DR and ER, along with radiation and poison extreme reductions.  You might surpass with bolstering/vanguard, but so situational, and from what I've noticed there is a built in separate damage resist built into power armor.
---
Every damage reduction legendary has huge caveats. Assassin's is 40% max, which if you get a full set, yes, you will be better protected than someone in power armor for PvP.  There are other possibilities, but they either require standing still, or constant movement that drains AP.   Theres low-hp builds that need regular armor, and they are cool if you want to constantly live on the edge.  A player with a radiation gun will destroy you though. 
---
Overall for general PvP, power armor is as good if not superior to what most people have access to.
---
Only alternative is bought from vendors, which is where mine came from. Sheer luck I assume, but usually if I see a high level person finish up with a vendor I see what they put in there legendary wise.
---
I have 187hrs of play time and have yet to find a TSE drop in the wild, with a good chunk of those hours making an effort to farm Whitesprings and my less stressful favorite place, Watoga.
---
My team uses real world containers or body’s or even a paper bag. When you go up press x to transfer and if everyone does it it creates a pool that makes trading much easier. 
---
For the bots on parade, their main objective is to destroy the robots, so they're never hostile until attacked.
---
It was fixed on pc last week, so no need to worry anymore.
---
So just turn on passive mode... 
---
I'm hesitant about mods. Given the bans of people who insist they were ONLY using mods. 
---
What’s your question
---
I liked the ability to view inventories before a trade happened saved me time on knowing who had shit and who had stuff worth trading and It didnt harm anything in the slightest Bethesda fixing things that dont need fixing and breaking things that worked fine before while fixing actual issues 
---
I’ll gladly help you out as well OP if u/JMAAB isn’t on when you need it.
---
I have characters on PC and Xbox
---
Will be on tonight after 8pm EST
---
I have a shit ton of atoms because I play like a crack addict and never spend them.  I agree 800 is like twice what I think its worth, it's sexiness is calling to me.
---
 I can almost afford the Camo Power Armor paint. Is that good for all PA?
---
Very low rate of rare paints and clothing
---
All you need is a knife and a plastic bag. 
---
*You could get a jangles icon for $1*
---
^but ^only ^that ^lol
---
Im on PS4 but today came the update so its hopefully fixed now. 
---
Nope. I have to buy all the photomode frames and posts first
---
Where?! 
---
I guess but it still has to do calculations for that. Setting it to a default number also saves some calcs for the server/game.probably not a significant amount unless everyone was also damage spamming on the server but still, every little bit helps.
---
There's no reason slap damage needs to be scaled off actual damage in any way if the intent is that it shouldn't really hurt the target. 
---
Wait, cyrolator makes things cold. Explosive makes things hot. Would it be a water gun if it had explosive
---
My dumb ass probably got rid of All Rise :(
---
There's still only so much you can reasonably carry and most mules are low level. It wouldn't hurt, but it makes life harder for supers and could help server stability.
---
Doing the Devil’s work!
---
I hate duping but I don’t blame ppl for it sometimes, normal weapons are so shit beyond belief 
---
It's different.  The pristine one is silver and doesn't have the patches.  The one in the shop looks more like a hazmat suit, but the Atom shop version looks clean and has those patches on it.  I wouldn't buy it, but if I had to buy something from that list that would be the only item.
---
At first I thought there was a 90% chance the SBQ drops a working toilet plan...I had to read it again. I would literally thank Todd Howard for an actual toilet that flushed. The portable is getting kind of full.
---
Not to be rude but you clearly didn’t read what I wrote. I asked if there were any further updates of DIFFERENT notes. A simple “No” would of been a more efficient response. Bethesda has once already released a patch, released notes, THEN went in and changed the notes afterwards before even telling anyone. THAT is what I asked.
---
I’m melee and it’s sick
---
All power armor except the excavator power armor, the raider power armor, and the Ultracite power armor.
---
I have a hard time believing those people.  I don’t use mods like re-shades, stuff that injects code from what I understand and some of those incidents where supposedly someone got banned they were using re-shades.
---
Sadly the mod someone just released that solves the plans not showing if learned at vendors similarly injects code so I don’t want to risk using it.
---
I only use better inventory and perk loadout.  They’ve already responded saying they realize people want a perk loadout manager so I doubt they’d hold that against people.  I don’t think I could play without it at this point.  When something becomes so integral to your play cause of how convenient it makes life then the developer should have / needs to add it.  
---
take an addictol. addictions dont show up under effects.
---
Guess I will have to find a L50 one 
---
Sorry yes there won’t be defenses added to the atom shop but more skins and decorations would be great. I would just like more thought given to gameplay mechanics of Camps because I like the idea of making a safe place that has defenses including working with others in a town setting. More decorations would allow people to customize their places more which would make for a more interesting world. 
---
every other time i go to my camp im have an army of scorched and a scorch beast attacking my base.. tons of fun i tell ya
---
I think they should just bundle it with adding this to the Appalachia Radio station for anyone who owns it.
---
https://youtu.be/lcWVL4B-4pI
---
Problem solved and a great new soundtrack for nuke launch viewing.
---
You gotta do lots of them. You cant turn in multiples anymore because they just stack into a single one. I dont think it matters anyways. I notice I get lots of shitty ones, then like two good drops in a row, then lots of shitty, then two in a row. Thats been my RNG pattern at least, probably just placebo.
---
I only ever drop one but seems like I used to get actual rewards instead of just ammo
---
You can temporarily equip the peek card if you want to while repairing, then remove it.   Even if you don't want the benefits of the reduced damage, at least make life easier with the repair costs
---
I tried it once and got launched pretty far away just like the skeletons, gotta make sure you properly stand on it. I love these kind of things.
---
I'm using it and my tse 44 pistol went from one shotting me to doing a sliver. 
---
It's not a green light to just go nuts though, because it still does guarantee a crippled leg and almost always breaks whatever sides leg armor took the hit. 
---
But I don't kill myself with it anymore, so that's nice.... Also makes you pretty much immune to scorchbeast blasts which is also nice... I think your armor still takes a hit to condition from it tho. 
---
I must be the only one who doesn't know what TSE is. What is it?
---
And your CAMP.
---
 Its a game I play. Why would I pay someone to make it easy. for me. Seems nuts to me, I can scam up my own crap in game, that's kinda the point of playing it.
---
 Its almost cheating ... but not quite. ;)
---
I agree that this is a big downside. It was a bloodbath when this happened 6 on 6 atleast. everywhere from lvl 50-200 and then there was this guy. I did kill him but it was only when he was moving around. 
---
Two Bullets come out of the barrel at the same time (the Two Shot legendary affects accuracy) and each one explodes. Shotguns only get an extra pellet but each pellet explodes.
---
Bethesda Softworks became a subsidiary of Zenimax in 1999.  Literally, Bethesda and Zenimax are controlled by the same company execs.
---
So... I actually worked on a project as contractor at Zenimax and I have friends that worked on multiple Bethesda titles.  Would you care to tell me more about stuff "I don't know" about?
---
I'm really curious as to what this random know-it-all on the internet knows about where I worked that I don't know.  Please, proceed.
---
No bears are friend
---
s with springs
---
Guess I’ll have to buy more atoms tonight because I really want this. Spent all of mine on fancy bullshit signs, pictures and rugs for my shop/house
---
I ran into a guy in power armor that kept running in front of me and turning his lights on in my face. You're not alone I guess.
---
SS outfit? A Nazi outfit.. in Fallout?
---
I've got a zealot's sniper rifle with the scorched like receiver, and it's pretty bad ass
---
I know my dumbass vendored mine
---
I got my explosive Gatling from normal exploration. From a legendary radstag.
---
Nope. Don't even camp at whitesprings myself. I just know how the artillery works.
---
Rip :(
---
The Garrahan Estate, 5th floor.
---
Are you using a spotlight? Are your turrets near ground level?
---
Good trick! And higher level mutants drop more ARs, Ars yield more steep scrap then pipe rifles and melees 
---
Away from my PC now, but when you click on it in the store it'll tell you which ones it could apply to. I do believe its good for all except Excavator though. 
---
Try 2-star first if you can - i've read that that's all you need along with the dense to remove all the explosive damage.
---
Are you turning in one at a time?
---
I want an NCR ranger mask and helmet. I've been trying to recreate the look with a hunters longcoat and an army helmet with gasmask and goggles and it's not the same.
---
Adamantium Skeleton lvl 3(because I'm mainly melee), and I didnt mean armored.  I meant literally equipping dense chest mod, and running around in my tighty whities hunting mobs.  *bang bang bang, diluted stim...rinse and repeat.
---
 Thanks. They should give us more info in the store, on a lot of the stuff.
---
Silver Shroud, lol
---
Ze Goggles, zey do nothing.
---
I fucked up the scorchbeast. It has not returned.
---
People forget just how many players get into rpg games to escape the real world to begin with. 
---
Maybe that’s not enough some times and an anonymous ear can help. I hope people take advantage of this. 
---
Its a leather tricorne
---
Yep, I drop everything to go toss it in there
---
Yeah NV had some great stuff
---
I think I know what he's talking about, but I might have just found something else completely unrelated... In the Garrahan Estates building bedroom, there's a closet that has a variety of things such as a clown suit, a police cap, and handcuffs... the Garrahans were definitely a unique bunch, for a lack of better terms
---
It’ll probably send us to the alien space craft at some point
---
hardly anyone is going to have many pieces of that armor, though I imagine it's being duped regularly now.
---
Wait what happened?i haven’t played in a couple of days 
---
I believe it's a plan you get.
---
Pretty much, but this sub reddit is a majority of Care Bears holding hands singing Mary poppin tunes
---
The atom shop tux set hat works for this challenge, surprisingly.
---
Its unlikely for a fresh noob to have it off.
---
OP needs to use their mic.
---
My last 3 level ups were given to Fireproof, after I read reports from the PC crowd.  I'm mainly melee, so this gives me the opportunity to use a TSE in an up front fashion, like melee.
---
Many subredits restrict direct linking to get rid of karma whores.
---
Huge if true. Must test now 
---
Anyone know if White Knight affect durability and/or repair cost of hazmat suits?
---
I think it's just for this specific theme. 
---
Maybe they're experimenting with how bright they can make things until people complain? I personally don't mind it but I wouldn't buy it for that price. 
---
Yeah, OP's solution is *really* aggressive, excessively so.
---
I know it's not feasible from a technical standpoint, but i loved the elevators in the contraption DLC
---
Would also love to see greenhouse walls/roofs, but i can't remember if that was in the actual game, or if i modded them in!
---
Does it not work on your own explosive damage?  Cause I still kill myself instantly with explosive weapons.
---
We were trolled by some orbital strike  throwing douches. Seemed intentional.
---
https://media.makeameme.org/created/cant-grief-my.jpg
---
i could give a shit less what youve worked on, what im saying is correct, NO ONE that worked on TESO worked on FO76, completely different dev teams, completely different programmer's, ect. literally no correlation between the two. a little bit of digging can show that.
---
It sure does. I used the heavy synth helmet exclusively in FO4 to try to quell my cravings, it's a cool helmet too, but the NCR ranger was the coolest looking helmet in any game thus far in my opinion.
---
So does this make explosive weapons useless against players in pvp? If so that really sucks.
---
😂🎶🙏
---
The greenhouse was part of the barn in vanilla! I miss the greenhouse stuff
---
Wow just googled this as it happened to me after today's patch... Great to know it's a bug. -__-
---
You're misreading. It's 40% power attack damage. So when you do a power attack it will do 40% more damage than a power attack normally would. Normal attacks and damage still deal normal damage
---
Keep your head on a swivel
---
Don't worry, vault tec has promised a better version. It's called the Pipboy Vista. 
---
Good way to find all the "dupers" and grief them.
---
It is true, thankfully. Servers are that much more stable when you can log in/load in and move without a freeze.
---
If you go to the Pipboy screen and like first screen section and press the button bind to view it should fix it
---
Two-Shot Explosive.
---
Do you know which perk is?
---
The weapon is rly used for slowing down targets. Like sb queen can almost freeze with it, fly slowly etc
---
It actually gives it quite a bit of range. I can easily hound the Scorchbeast Queen while she's flying around, and that's with no attachments. 
---
http://dulfy.net/2018/11/26/fallout-76-legendary-weapons-quest-guide/
---
Yeah, really iconic, now that u mentioned it the synth stuff was pretty nice, but would destroy immersion even more if it showed up in 76 lol 
---
I’m in a similar position as you. I have one TSE weapon that I paid 5k caps for, and always have pacifist turned on. However I’ve accepted that, probability wise, I did buy a duped weapon as its likely under 1% of the total TSE’s in circulation were picked up legitimately. 
---
I justify it to myself by thinking that I earned it by saving up the caps, and that I wouldn’t have it if all the duping hadn’t happened. I think it’s only fair I have one as well, as now everyone has them which devalued the rare weapons I had collected legitimately before the exploit. 
---
thank you! Just what I was looking for 
---
I'm glad its coming but bummed its not already in-game. Such a mixed bag of feelings coming from the Atomic Shop today for me.
---
lol if you say so.
---
Depends on what console you're on. But i believe no matter what it is, its the change view button(v on pc?) To go to 3rd person.
---
Should be at the bottom on the screen while you using the pipboy.
---
This is the reason I am hated throughout the “storyteller” posts on /r. I constantly request proof and I just get attacked or silently downvoted. Think most if us have had enough of the useless negative posts. I even try to get on here and educate people that perk card balance with the correct armor can result this way, they don’t want to hear it. Its almost as if they dont want to be better at the game they just want to see you get banned for your achievements so they can keep up  being shitty uninformed players and not acknowledge or feel bad about it. 
---
Join friends game.
---
Find container in said game.
---
Put shit in said container.
---
Log in alt.
---
Loot aforementioned container.
---
I buy pretty much all the Camp stuff. I don’t know exactly why. So don’t ask.
---
PvP happens in games with pvp
---
No amount of mental gymnastics or snowflakes downvoting will change that
---
It was a single player game until some dumbass decided to make a multiplayer game
---
We can typically expect a week delay for consoles for the certification process, doesn't mean there were bugs. 
---
I think pvp should rely a little more on skill and level,
---
 rather than OP weapons.  This, coming from the 35 year old who screams "Quit jumping around asswipe" when playing COD Black Ops.
---
There is a beep, and the system voice begins speaking from a TranScribe. "Welcome to Apallachia Morgan. It is March 15th, 2102. Warning, significant radiological and biological hazards detected. Suggest course of action: evacuate to a Vault-Tec secure testing facility pending further situation analysis. Vault-Tec, a TranStar associate, produces underground bunkers, four of which are detected in the region."
---
Not dumb. 
---
Yeah I know that, that’s how I get my blood, but that’s not an option that the video game give you they make you do all the extra work.
---
I think making it so that bobbleheads don't stack the bonus and just give you a flat increase like a drug does, would make the problem with dupers less bothersome. The bobbleheads are how they are; one shotting the queen, other players, etc...
---
Get the energy ammo perk and it drops the weight of fusion cores 
---
With the booblehead exploit you can be one-shotted; no need to engage in PvP or anything you just die. 
---
I never keep more then 6 in my stash box. They're common enough to find and you'll never go through 100 of them. 
---
most mmos will ban you for doing this if youre caught.
---
So you delete your post and come back an hour later to make comments? 
---
About halfway between Bolton Greens and Skullbone Vantage when I logged off.  The merchant I tried to visit was Sutton Station, and I couldn’t tell you where any of the other stuff occurred, save to say that I headed west over the Appalachias pretty much as soon as I was done with the deathclaw.
---
You should be able to launch the exe from the folder and sign into an account manually. I haven't tried it myself, but given this I think it's possible. 
---
Yes drop em in say, overseers camp or right outside vault 76.
---
Could try selling em, but those both are so common anyone with the caps to buy em are probably swimming in em themselves
---
Alright. I’ll have to get it by taking workshops n stuff I guess. I believe that’s how I got it last time...
---
If you can't. Open one instance in your main windows account and another in a quest account. It's a trick ive used for other games.
---
Hooked by Bethesda,huh? ;)
---
My most fun find was off a 3 legendary col gutsy who in silo Charlie dropped a nice two shot missile launcher for me. I slapped a quad barrel on there with target computer. Poor scorchbeasts I almost feel sorry for them as they spam their attacks and eat a face full of 8 missiles. 
---
Yeah, it's a known bug since the update. Happened on PC as well, not sure if they've fixed it yet there yet. 
---
I'm at like 80% falling
---
/u/maxx2018
---
If the previous titles didnt immerse you then RPG's might not be for you, you might enjoy survival games, not RPGs.
---
I always thought it was for really close range I still think other perks would be better then explosive like a faster fire rate or anti armor 
---
Does it still add +15 damage with the explosive effect? Energy weapons with explosive confuse me
---
If you have a lot and don't use them, either trade them or toss them. No point in holding on to things you can't or aren't using.
---
Exactly, I don't see how changing the way bobbleheads work would screw any honest players anyway. They were never like this in any other fallout game, you found them once and got a permanent increase. This unlimited stacking of a buff item is just begging for trouble. At least with this the dupers would still be limited as anyone else.
---
If we’re are assuming things on appearance, you are simply a troll and nothing else. I mean, it’s likely you are just a troll. Far more likely.
---
Well I spent 3 hours redoing my C.A.M.P after moving it from another location only to have two assholes “visit” it and destroy everything within seconds. I tried logging off but the damage was done. I don’t have materials to replace things so I stripped everything down and set up a  large tent. Yay for people visiting CAMP’s!
---
Why is power armor bad for pvp? I'm confused and need clarity.
---
I checked after the dclaw. I was alone.  Or possibly being stalked by someone with a high sneak skill and a desire to be a troll, which seems unlikely.
---
My dude, no need to be ignorant. He has a point, I hate duper’s as much as the next guy but this page is flooded with suggestions on how to combat it but I’m sure a triple A developer like Bethesda will have a fix, even if it’s too late. 
---
Oxhorn is the boss for fallout vids. Mxr will always have a place in my heart though... soooo fucking immersive
---
Actually, I don’t think you’re correct.  I had to large purifiers put done and would always have 5 purified water in each every time I stopped by. Unless I’m misunderstanding your comment (which is possible)
---
screenshot or didn't happen.
---
I will do that. Thanks again.
---
But it aint complex...I just showd how easy it is. And the legendary effect aint so complex. It is not like all combination of weapons and legendary have to work. Take Furious- if you put it on sniper rifle, ofc it is going to be unbalance towards sniper rifle with two-shot, because you are f#cking idiot. Take a furious and put it on high fire rate weapon with high cap magazine and it makes sense.
---
And we aren't balancing every weapon against every other weapon, because every weapon have been basically built with same thumb rule: High fire rate, small dmg per shot. Slow fire rate, high damage per shot. That as pretty robust thumb rule. But if you want more accurate thumb rule then you have to count also magazine size and reloading speed. If balanced weapon does 1000 damage in 10 seconds and unbalanced is doing more or less, then you either increase or decrease one of its 4 parameters, until it matches what it is supposed to do. Not a f#cking rocket science.  
---
I just know that if there is a bag from on a house or some camp structure it will stay there when the camp is moved or the leave the server. Same thing when you die in midair.
---
&gt; I imagine it's being duped regularly now.
---
You imagine correctly. The same people with TSE weapons will also have 5x Assassin/Sentinel armor with dense mods.
---
Its cause someone got there and stripped it before you did.

Charleston Landfill for Junk+.Dabney Homestead for Copper, Junk+. Those are a few of my favorites. But my game crashes. I just got the patch and it crashed after like 10 minutes so yeah. Kinda bored with that.
---
Oh hell ya. Really love FO76 :)
---
I forgot, about 3 times, many weeks ago.   Never not remember now, I only giggle joyously while I try to find the corpse post-explosion.  So fun.
---
Not all Fallouts. 3 and New Vegas the best weapons weren’t random spawns.
---
Thanks for the reply but I think you are missing what I’m saying in 3. 
---
It happened across 3 different locations four times, thats 12 times in a row total. That doesn’t sound like rng. 
---
It’s like the enemies get locked in to becoming a fake legendary (no stat, doesn’t mutate/regen health with a bad loot table). 
---
I want to avoid actual legendaries ending up locked like this. 
---
When you say normal legendary, is that a no star or 1 star and did it have a boss modifier or not? Also does it run away from you? I’ve found all the fake legendaries ran away from me when I revisited the area. 
---
&gt;My flatscreen somehow broke itself.
---
Is this the non-domestic-violence version of "she fell down the stairs"?
---
😄
---
Fuck are 2se?
---
Not everyone is on reddit and forums.  There WILL be the occasional lvl200+ griefer who thinks "Why would I need to be fireproof, I'm in PA".  Boom.  That's why.  From what I can see, most of the people on Reddit want to play fairly, except those with posts like "Why is my CAMP being constantly attacked?"  I dont know, moron.  You wouldn't happen to be at the Golf Club would you?  All across platforms, "campers" are hated with a passion.
---
I guess I don't understand how limiting a thing that is immediately bypassed in comments is doing anything helpful or useful. 
---
Never to late 
---
Ahh, nice. That did it. Thank you sir.
---
Xbox one.
---
Had issue prior to patch, is still an issue post patch.
---
When wearing PA, become over encumbered.
---
Regardless of which chassis I’m using.
---
Ie I go from 167/205 to 220/215
---
Haven’t found these either.  But I did get a one star quad ammo capacity ultracite laster pistol last night.  I haven’t modded it yet or used it yet to see how good it is. 
---
They just focused too hard on the group playthrough.  Which I underatand, That’s literally the only selling point of the game. Other than that, not much to see here
---
I don’t use my Tesla rifle due to the crashes :(
---
 I'm on PS4. Hrrrmmm.
---
Well dang.
---
To the bog for cement then
---
Appreciate this, friend. I've been server hopping workshops for xp early levels, and this will help with some of the monotony, I thinks. 
---
They’re the pussies for destroying random players bases. Anyone who does that is a pussy bitch, but it’s even worse if you’re adding people who are accepting because they think you want a free fast travel and they’re helping you out. And they were doing it to low levels too. Stupid scum.
---
Probably got downvoted due to the fact that he immediately jumped to the conclusion that the dude was lying, when it was just a honest mistake instead. That'd be my guess.
---
Nothing stops a soldier and his combat knife.  I'm wielding a bloody with swing speed and I've seen sheet damage in excess of 1700 damage. Im sure others have achieved higher, the number above doesn't include magazine or bobble, but does include all perks, food, and fury. 
---
It attacks 2.21 times per second with incisor, vs a 2h slow which is 1.02 attacks per second.  A sledge would need over 3400 sheet damage to keep up.
---
Plus, it's excellent when you encounter a horde.  Whack whack whack whack.
---
batteries included is a requirement if you go PA
---
Thank you for the clarification
---
Does it keep you in the game trying to get what you need? Then yes.
---
Normal
---
Do you have a chassis?
---
Did you kill a wendigo in the suit yet???? /s
---
^^That ^^quest ^^is ^^still ^^broken ^^right??
---
They have fathers on hard times. Going through their own things. I am just engaged so really till the marriage I have no claim really. I am fine being the replacement. My own sperm donor was just a DNA contributor that I was forced to live with. I brought it down to the kids level cause they are into sports. Had to look up the terms and everything, and I still got it wrong.
---
“I am not here to totally replace your dads, I am more like playing a really long drawn out game of tag team wrestling. I’m just replacing him in the ring while he rests a while and fix themselves up.”
---
What I said original apparently mixed two sports. 
---
Awesome matey, now scrub the decks..
---
Last night went to farm west tek and the 3 legendaries inside were like this
---
This is beautiful. At my base I constantly spawn underwater surrounded by mirelurks. Yet neither the water nor the morelurks spawn till I’m dead. Yay! 
---
Good to know. I like to break into CAMPs. I never break things, just see if I can get in and fast travel out. 
---
Thank god. I got killed countless time without even seeing an enemy. 
---
My dude, that wasn’t ignorance, that was just me saying oh well.
---
So each region of the map has "level ranges" that enemies will spawn as and scale based on the first player that enters into the region. It looks like you were in The Savage Divide (located between the 2 mountain ranges) and can spawn enemies from level 15-99. If a high level player on your server entered that region before you, the enemies are scaled to that player. Lookup "fallout 76 map zones" to read more about it!  
---
Yes I have a chassis
---
Nah.. dupers make stacks of 100k of things then sell it all and give it away.  Multiple dupers.  I haven't seen 1 in 300 hours.  They can see 300k in 1 hour.  Easy enough to get those numbers.  The massive majority of TSE weapons in circulation are duped.
---
We're not in the same situation.  I was aware of the problem from reading reddit and opted to not seek one out or accept one, or trade with players at all for that matter.  Anything worthwhile I can think of to buy is probably going to be duped.
---
If there were no dupes, people would probably be begging for higher caps than 25k because they would be worth far more than that.  So you earned the going rate for a TSE in a dupe economy.  No one knows how much more they would be worth without dupes.
---
You have a point about everything you possess being devalued.  What you feel entitled to because of that is entirely up to you.  Personally I just work with what i've found.
---
Just poured it on the rocks. gooIt's good, not as terrible as everyone made it sound.  Definitly taste the caramel and mabye a little coconutness to it. Definitly a good after dinner thing

---
I've had experiences of some people start randomly attacking so some tend to get cautious of higher levels out of fear sadly 
---
I chose console because imaginative players &gt; everything. I'd rather be griefed than join a boring "safe space" snowflake server. Also way more cheats on computer.
---
Awesome post going to steal this idea!
---
This.  Also, the US has a National "insert whatever" Day almost everyday.  It's pretty damn ridiculous, imo.
---
Where can you see your addiction? 
---
Sadly not many yet. I even give out my personal number online. Been doing this as a bit of a social experiment to illustrate how hard it is for people to even talk about getting help.
---
Not any mmos I've played and bought legitmate copies of.
---
Should still be the same at the bottom of the screen while in the pipboy.
---
"Change view" is what you're looking for. :D
---
No wonder nobody has come to rock on the front porch with me :'(
---
Yeah me too, this game is ridiculous.. I want to love it.. Let me love you.. 
---
As a side note:  If you're friends are needing this, they do not need to complete all of the steps.  You only need 1 person with the key to the nuka cola locker.  Have them unlock the locker, then everyone can get the last key to the nuke bunker.
---
But there are no bugs in Bethesda games. 
---
Its not screwed. When someone trade requests you, look at them and hold the button that pops up. To accept an invite, go to the team section on the map and accept it. When the team invite first comes up you can even hold a button for it to go straight to the team section. Not sure what the keys are since I use a controller on pc but it tells you in the notifications.
---
 Same thing. I am level 25, have all the mats and its all greyed out. My higher level rocks an X0-1 so I do know how it works. 
---
 Its not important to my char but is bugged.
---
Ive been called a cheater for my sentinel assassin armor with dodgy setup. I literally take no damage from people.
---
I'm saying that you are conflating your opinion with reality. You clearly state in your first half of your argument that someone can like something, while others can dislike it, and that does not mean one of those halfs is "wrong", only means people have different opinions. After stating that, which is a self-evident fact, you go out of yourself to state that FO76  \_IS\_ a bad game. That contradicts your first half, in which you stablished the relativity of liking something, and you changed it to try to stablish your opinion as objective truth.   
---
The best analogy I can think of is if you say "people have different tastes. Some like pineapple in pizza and some not. That said, pineapple in pizza tastes bad". If you don't see how those two statements contradict themselves, I'm not sure I can help you to understand.  
---
 The purpose of a game is to have fun, a game which makes you have fun is a good game. Thing is, having fun is subjective. Some people have fun solving puzzles, some people have fun boxing. You cannot say "boxing is a better enterteinment than Rubbick's cube" or viceversa, because there is nothing objective you can measure to state that.
---
They're getting at the fact that you call the pvp shit when it's intentionally that hard because of the genre. It isn't Viva Pinata. 
---
That would be the smart thing to do, anyway.
---
Have you started the quest?  Or are the parts grayed out in the power armor work bench?
---
whichever one that has the materials you need.
---
I really don't think the drops are that rare, I'm level 105 and I farm Whitesprings constantly. I think I'm at 3 TSE now.
---
Lost all my shotgun ammo in their too (PS4), annoying, 
---
I'm sorta both an explosive and non-explosive Heavy Gunner PA player. As such, I don't have max points in either Demolition Expert or all 3 Heavy Gunner perks (TSE .50 Cal for explosive, Bloodied 25% fire rate +1 Per Gatling for non-explosive) and I play with most of my SPECIAL stats relatively low except for Strength and Intelligence, which I take advantage of many of the PA perks and extending my gear lifespan w/ Level 5 Gunsmith and Level 2 Power Patcher. I carry a lot of stims on me too since I'm slower in PA so I keep Travelling Pharmacy on me all the time (I'm also mutated so I have my luck more tuned into Class Freak and Starched Genes, but I would recommend Luck Of The Draw and One Man Army for those going full Heavy)
---
Oh man thank you!!
---
Are you in the correct location and using one of the active Power Armor Stations? Not all of them are functional for that purpose.
---
Loading screens faster? Now that's interesting! Come on 5 o'clock!
---
Honestly I'm getting rapidly burned out with the only real reliable gearing option I have is the Nuke Zones and I can't even take part because every wave is immediately deleted by a 1 shot of a TSE shotgun.
---
I've actually started playing BL2 again because of it, forgot how much I liked that game. 
---
I would absolutely set up an in-game shop and role-play a curmudgeoney old blacksmith if mods worked this way.
---
Good idea
---
Don't you mean the 'bobble-heads' up?
---
I guess in a way I am. I mean I haven't spent any yet, but that's more due to the fact that what they have available for purchase isn't interesting to me and not because I'm trying to actively "save"
---
Take a s
---
have a 2shot cryo in my stash. ps4 here
---
Press the touch pad, should switch the view back to the pipboy
---
it could work, but sadly that would cause one of the most extreme community backlashes in history.
---
Just make sure you get that ivory grip for the single action....  I hear it's hard to come by.
---
Also so what if someone is inside your house? I've seen a few people literally build a fortress around their crops or resource extractor... like so what if someone steals 10 corn?
---
Consoles have an update today. servers are down during that time.
---
3*?
---
The X-01 was the preview image. I don't recall if there were additional images of the other sets.
---
Yes! I was at Westek as well. Really peculiar
---
I crashed instantly in my first nukezone 
---
Please sir, I will trade you 6 Assassin's Wood Left Legs and 2 Junkie Pitchforks for a TSE Combat Shotgun?
---
I have started the quest and I already have the hemat chest and one arm buildt 
---
 LOL. Yeah I just put a level 15 into the Watoga churn and have several Hand Made plans. He's level 25 now and doing very well. Just gotta get a set of plans to my higher level.
---
Chaotic good
---
Every damn time
---
It’s sounding like a glitch. I would try to get a pick of it being ghosted and showing you have the components.
---
Thanks for digging on this.  What you said seems to be backed up by this wiki page :
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Overdrive_(Fallout_4)
---
You’re a dick, that’s what I mean. 
---
The reasons the previous games didn't immerse me were that every single non-story NPC had pretty much the same 3 voices and the same lines about "robot man bad" in FO4, gambling or the desert in NV, and survival being hard in FO3. Also, once you've completed a companion's story in FO4 they never seem to really bring that up much again, and in 3 and NV they were brick walls to talk to with a sprinkling of backstory here or there. 
---
Why? So my stack of 200 steel scrap can become 200 individual entries that I need to scroll through? No thanks
---
You pretty much have to re-build your entire camp.
---
Exactly! The mindset seems to be divided between people who have actually grinded and farmed to get their tse from
---
RNGesus and those who don't have a tse and assume because they saw something on the interwebs that said tse = the devil Bobby Bouche. Guess what, momma was wrong. Are there dupers? Yup. Is everyone with better gear than you a cheating pos cheater? Nope. 
---
I would *never* *EVER* forget something like that.... ^y^e^s
---
Like just have a little box of puppies in one of the early locations as a spawn in point if you want your own dog meat. Click on it and then you can create your companion and boom, pets. I guess a limit of pets per player or something would need to be put in though
---
I've come across one TSE lever action that dropped for me. My other weapons I've traded for or bought with caps. I'm LV 170 with around 500 hours in and I did devote most of my time to legendary farming before even starting to quest. In my experience, two shot by itself is far more common than explosive, and the two together are insanely rare. Probably like 90% of legit players would never see one let alone have it in their hands. I will never trade my lever action because it dropped for me and is super special to me, it's still I know because it is a digital item, but to me it represents my hours of killing enemies and getting nothing good.
---
That doesn't help because they can occasionally spawn inside your base even if the doors are locked.
---
Dishonored, Wofenstein and Prey all of them sold below expectations.

---
Prey, Dishonored and Wolfenstein were critically acclaimed. They were finished products with little to no bugs.   
---
They were also single player story focused games, a dying genre that sells less and less every year, despite the few succesful titles that youtube pundits try to use as an example. Truth is, this are bad times for companies that focus in this kind of games and publish a lot of them, like Bethesda. For every major success like God of War, you can point to a dozen of tittles that sell less than expectations.

Can confirm that Xbox is full of dickheads. Was faffing around with my buddy the other day when we noticed a fella wandering around with a 10k bounty (at least that's what his map icon indicated) with what seemed like half the server following him around. Naturally, when you're floating in the high 80-150 level range, you see 10k and you're like "That's a lotta scratch! I need that!". So as I'm gearing up to go and handle business my amigo gets a bad feeling about the sheer amount of people following this guy around so he heads off first to see what the deal is. Turns out the guy with the bounty has been running around trashing people's C.A.M.P.s and waiting for them to come "find" him, only he is glitched in such a way that he is not only invisible on screen, he is also invulnerable. Naturally, we get smacked up and say fuck it, we're gone. We go to report this chode and when we look at his Xbox profile, his feed is filled with clips of him glitching and breaking and entering. And not just on FO76. He is also an asshole on Ark, Conan, and get this, Astroneer. Dude made a clip of covering another players up and then burying his precious metals in a cave. So yes, Xbox is toxic AF, even when you REALLY have to go out of your way to be toxic.
---
No dice u/DangerBoyIU, I see through your nefarious plan. Can't bait me!
---
I’m not sure how, considering I’m not the one throwing out insults.
---
Maybe I’m a noob but I never ever have enough fusion cores. My play style is carefree and non strategic so I find myself in desperate measures quite often. Running across someone like you in the wasteland would make my day. Please, don’t drop them Willy-Nilly. Gift those beauties to a noob in need.

I had issues like this... not this exact one, but with un-movable walls... I ended up having to build more on top and next to them and then remove those pieces.    Attach an upper floor to it, build around it and then start storing those items.  It might reset the stairs to be able to be removed.

Hell i'd be happy with an Eyebot companion that does nothing but follow me.

Like the armored mudcrab from Skyrim's creation club. It's absolutely useless, but i like having the company.

We have become wasteland squirrels. We watch with curiosity but the second an approach is made in our direction, we scamper.

What do you mean by bulk? I'm not sure what this term means :(
---
When I got into games as a teen this could have been a big deal. Hell, as an adult in a good place if I was on the same platform I’d run by just to say “ hey my dog is being an a-hole today!” and run away. But even if just one person takes advantage of this opportunity your making a difference.
---
Problem is to get ultracite weapon mods you have to scrap actual ultracite weapons. 
---
Regular mods dont apply
---
Is it? Didn't know i signed up for a cheater's paradise with OP weapons on a majority of players. Must have missed that in the advertisements.  Sorry I expected a little more balance in my PVP, you know, where I can at least compete.

Its 5 versions of jacket and jeans.

Bottle and cappy red; bottle and cappy orange; cappy; nuka world; nuka geyser

So your motivation in this endeavor is...to deny happiness to others? I mean is this clock blocking Reddit style? Help me to understand.
---
Radsponge ftw in nuke zone groups! 
---
but that begs the question: why would you tag anything with components that aren't critical?
---
Patched duping and made a worse one
---
Nice build, but I think purifiers are capped/shared in CAMP, aren't they? Having two produces the same as having one, I've read, and I seemed to experience that when I had a two-purifier CAMP buildout.
---
Do I still get to see my head with no body at least?
---
Then they need to set up some kind of matching system to make it happen, because the chances that I ever get to do that are nil.
---
Did you miss all of the companion quests and interactions in New Vegas? What the hell? They weren't brick walls dude lmao
---
This feature is also kind of hilarious. Usually when I log in they load after everything else, so I get to watch the game apply multiple colour filters before it settles on what it should be.
---
No, the problem is that bobbleheads aren't supposed to stack.
---
Not all legendary robots. And only in the beginning. My first couple silo runs I was right on their dead bodies checking the legendary effects when they went poof.
---
yeah, thanks, i forget this game doesn't really explain how much of the UI works.
---
I am waiting for a Charlie Brown character to come by. But why not start one up on your platform if you like. I only use my new account for it and have one character made on each game I play now. And all I am doing is this for about an hour or two a day. More when the family is out of town visiting other family that doesn’t get along with me.
---
You really think that every player is going around forums and is informed what goes around in game. Maybe duper dropped these, he was walking by and saw 1.4 million bobblehead and thought:"Hey, if some one has dropped these, then these things can be obtained very easy inside the game and I haven yet discovered how". There is no rule saying that you cannot have millions of bobbleheads. I would understand, if there was cap how many bobbleheads you can have and then guy is having more than that cap.
---
Yup I get the same thing sometimes.
---
Well doesn't make much of a difference other than not being able to see whats going on while the mobs that sometimes spawn as you spawn into the game are hammering away at you. At least you don't get to see yourself killed this time!
---
Did you get a response in this yet?
---
Yeah, alot of it stems from jealousy I've found. It's like "I have never seen one and I don't have it, so if he has it he must be a duper or have gotten it from one, because nobody is luckier or stronger than me without exploits, I'm the best" kind of thing. Also since explosive by itself is really good, anybody sees explosions and it's instantly omg two shot explosive duper!
---
I totally agree... remember when it was 400....  I like to keep supplied because I never really know what I'm going to need (Seriously, where can I get a ton of ballistic fiber?) but In FO4, I loved building my home.  This game too (Although not being able to put junk down as decor sucks) but I also want a vastly enhanced budget.  Not for turrets though, i could care less if they INCREASED the budget for turrets....  I just want a more complex house.  
---
The belly of a Deathclaw is their weak spot.
---
Deathclaws: belly
---
Robots: Torso
---
Turrets: where they shoot out of (forgot the right term) 
---
I dont get the Brahmin. Was it there and did you built a fence around it/them?
---
Found the duper... 
---
I’ll sell you some if you’re on PS4. I paid 400 caps for them so I’ll just sell em to you for the same price. I’d give em for free but I’m goin broke haha. 
---
I would love a higher camp budget as well
---
 Not trying to be an asshat, but this seems reeeeeallly r/thathappened. Everything in this story seems pretty damn unrealistic and far from the norm. I could be wrong tho idk
---
did one today solo, just need to have some basic survivability like make sure your weapons and armor are repaired, you have radaway/rad-x and stims, and maybe some circuits in your stash. Also need a nuclear keycard and the code from online, it's a fun little dungeon run and pretty satisfying at the end
---
It should, just like pc. At whitesprings I’ve noticed people often sneak around to get tags or kills while groups are busy tagging and not killing the ghouls.
---
I found a fully modified gauss rifle, with 248 damage per hit and a vendor price of 120 caps. Its the most expensive thing I have right now.
---
And I am not revealing the safe that I found it in
---
I actually found them like an hour ago finally! But thank you for the kind offer. 
---
But what about the rare few who have actually found one in world by drop from a legendary enemy and use it simply because they are the best?
---
Keep pacifist enabled. Like I said, people can jump in front of your bullets to force you into pvp. I've also had luck forcing a fight by punching someone with the electric discharge mutation as well.
---
There's also reports of people killing you through slap damage now with stacked bobbleheads. So that sucks.
---
Can't wait!! I'm a server hopper and damn those load screens are so awful. 
---
Really tho... why even care. So fucking what it’s not a competitive game why even give a shit
---
Explode and loot
---
I'm level 91 and have been doing solo nuke silo runs since mid 70s. I can more less just brute force my way through the silo in about 25 minutes or so. Totally a viable option
---
Good on ya!! Much appreciated 
---
Haha, a sociopath and I love it!
---
So that's why someone 20 levels lower one shot me while I was in PA. 
---
I don't have the Jetpack, but with just Marsupial, bird bones, and speed demon (the 2 latter might not be necessary) you can climb up the top of the Whitesprings Resort. It's a nice view. I went up there and launched a bunch of mini nukes and orbital strikes at the robots in the courtyard. Good times, good times.
---
They fixed the glitch that caused fusion cores to recharge each time you log in while increasing the output of fusion core generators, so I suspect the power plants will become valuable again.
---
Some recipes you learn upon picking up the main ingredient, tick blood for blood packs. Don't ever remember finding a plan for it, just know I can make them. 
---
&gt; full set, yes, you will be better protected than someone in power armor for PvP.  There are other possibilities, but they either require standing still, or constant movement that drains AP.   Theres low-hp builds that need regular armor, and they are cool if you want to constantly live on the edge.  A player with a radiation gun will destroy you though.
---
I agree with that last sentence (Than what most people have access to). I also think power armor is definitely the best 'all around' armor, but as you know in end game metas, in this clase including regular PVP, it is often min-maxing and extreme compromises that win the day, making the 'all around' and 'all purpose' approach of power armor not so strong.   
---
The armor 'alone' is not really what makes regular armor powerful, it's the fact that there are so many perks that explicitly exclude power armor that when combined with normal armor can indeed surpass power armor in even DR and ER. Now I don't 'think' you can surpass the combined total of X-01 DR, ER, and RR with regular armor without both perks and legendary armor, but you can come surprisingly close (By doing exceedingly well in DR and ER, and completely compromising RR).   
---
What I guess I would advise, is if you are PvP on the offensive, min-max, and pick your fights. If you are PvP on the defensive, power armor might actually still be your best bet. After all I can tail someone at a distance and 'watch' how they play, and if I find them holding still a lot, then I 'know' they are probably using sentinel, if I find them sprinting when being hit and taking no damage, probably acrobatics (Or whatever its called), and if I see them using their explosive weapon at point blank, they might have assassin, and almost certainly have fireproof and dense. In other words, non-power armor users 'project' their defense strategy, and can be specifically targeted with a counter-measure. Power armor might be the 'best' bet in this case, but the unfortunate reality is that while it has no 'specific' counter measure, sheer overwhelming damage can cut right through it, and the only real solution to stop that is non-power armor metas (The best I've seen is Assassin, Endurance +1, Sentinel Heavy Combat with BoS and Dense mods, with a strong 'defense' spec, and explosive weapons), these metas can make it possible to 'defend' against just about any attack except a one shot pacifist grieffer who targets you while you're running with 1,000 explosive bobbleheads buffing him, but ironically because of the dense, assassin, armor, and hopefully fireproof mod you 'might' actually survive that, and then when you hold still you can fire back immune.

This is not obtainable for most players, this is not obtainable for EXTREMELY high level players because these pieces of armor are so rare that they didn't even manage to find their way into dupers hands to be sold in the first place (Which is good in my opinion). This means that you're looking at grinding 20,000 caps per armor piece, and socializing a LOT to find someone who has it and will sell it for all those caps, a future favor, your next born child, and a kidney. However, there ARE players who have managed to make this build, and it doesn't appear they are duping their armor because it's not proliferating, so even if they themselves are dupers, they seem to value the power more than the wealth, and these players are truly invulnerable to 'just about' everything.   
---
The best weapon to use against them is actually radiation damage, but their radiation resistance while nothing compared to their other stats isn't 'bad' and the 'general' damage reductions also apply to radiation. There is only one radiation weapon that is 'worth' investing in, and you can't buff it's damage with perks, so you're essentially trying to get a 'two-shot' version of it, and hoping that the Gamma Gun can dish out damage fully automatic point blank faster than they can kill you or dish out radaways. The other downside to this approach though, is a player getting hit by this can quick key rad-X and I have NOOO idea if it's intentional or not, but you seem to be able to stack rad-X infinitely, meaning you can completely immunize yourself again radiation weapons instantly, and deal with the player during your 5 minutes of immunity. The rad X trick also works "Okay" for entering nuke zones if you're vigilant, with a team of people using Rad Sponge and Ghoulish, so I can't say that normal armor "can't" do nuke zones, but I generally tend to not recommend it, as again it limits mobility, forces you to cooperate, and is generally a less versatile strategy. That said, the fastest 'legitimate' takedown I ever saw of the SBQ was by 4 regular armor players running that exact rad-sponge ghoulish configuration with 10% health, and clearly some crazy unyielding armor with other buffs, and they literally crushed her health in less than 45 seconds after she landed.  
---
I dunno, it's inconvenient, but until there are more power armor mods, and legendary power armor, I think the 'enthusiast' end game is reserved for non-power armor users.  
---
They've changed fusion cores - made them harder to get and...
---
They'll be worth a mint in a month or so as soon as people realise they can't just relog to be back at 100% power
---
I get where some folks feel that way but when I see how many people are dropping 100, 200, 300, hell even 400+ hours into the game just since release I have to say that it's still a good game.  When I first played World of Warcraft right after it's release that was broken as hell too.  Speed hackers, auto mining bots, invulnerable glitches, teleportation hacks, almost daily "Servers are down for emergency maintenance", and again a lack of content for people who don't just play games but devour them because that's how they do and that game has become the power house to beat all other MMOs, that all other MMOs are aspiring to be.
---
I also look at ESO when it dropped versus where it is now and I have hope that they will take an already fun game and make it even better, after all their future game sales really do depend on it :-p
---
Aw man it was bad enough leveling before now they’ve made it even more grindy? I need 20 more levels.
---
txcowboy69 I'm down
---
PSN: nahhphet     (Level 89 melee)
---
Well, that's all for today folks.  But tune in tomorrow for another episode of SHIT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN!
---
Mine was dropped for me. TSE lever action with damage resist while reloading. I will NEVER trade it or even loan it to anybody, friend or not. I am it's guardian, and it will NOT be DUPED.
---
Dismemberment has been removed from Fallout 76 (you cannot shoot or slash or crush off limbs). Decapitation can still occur however and the Bloody Mess perks allows enemies to explode into messy bits.
---
I have no problem with the level 50s I've started jet packing to them and giving them exploding shotgun to the face
---
You guys are amazing for doing this
---
I think it's more that Atom Shop stuff in 76 is meant to be purely cosmetic with no stat effects at all so Beth can skip any sort of pay-to-win controversy.
---
 4-shot Atom Shop Fatman would make them a hell of a lot more money than fish lamps.
---
Hardened masses no longer scrap when you scrap all 
---
Problem here is why it even works like that in the first place. Fixing dupes won't make pvp enjoyable, the reasons WHY it isn't should be looked at.
---
What's stopping a guy to invest time and caps to get enough of bobbleheads without duping and shit on people then?
---
There's a legendary super mutant at the waste dump north of the whitesprings station that consistently does that. Had to chase that fucker all the way onto the resort once. 
---
Haha. Except that time we almost broke up over arenas in WoW. We don’t... we don’t play competitive games together anymore. I told him to learn to play. It was the worst fight we ever had lmaoooo. 
---
Chassis?
---
No. You'll shoot your eye out.
---
Out of all the legendaries I have, I think my best weapon is a 2 star vampire +power attack pickaxe.  None of my other weapons have more than 1 star legendary effects.  I've got a few 3 star armor pieces.
---
In general I'd say most of the legendaries I use have come from cast-offs from other people at the vendor.
---
I think a tagging system would work for this. You can tag yourself as a faction. This would allow you to recognize someone's allegiance on first sight.
---
This could also help to focus pvp encounters. For instance, BOS can be enemies of Raiders allowing for open pvp between those two factions. This way pvp can happen more organically rather then slapping each other to initiate. 
---
It would at least make keep my head on the swivel when I'm exploring. 
---
Now that post is back up to positive and mine is down. 10/10 gotta love this sub
---
No. The barrel. 
---
Are they that hard to find for others?  I have had to drop tons of them cause im over loaded and i still have lots.  I do PA most of the time too.
---
It would be nice if it wasn't a random time and then explosion, I've watched a legendary robot for 10 seconds walked up boooom, other blow up in 1 or 2 seconds, lol. I've also had them explode onto roofs, lol.
---
Literally Unplayable
---
You don't have to have a door. Just store and replace a wall to go through
---
Really needa put my old 2 star "ok" sentinels back on sometime soon, Been spoiled by having food and drink weight being reduced to essentially 0 with gear that my "loadout" is just too heavy right now to switch lol.
---
Definitely get a Dense mod when you can, upgraded padded.
---
I was walking around and got attacked by a scorchbeast in the Ash Heap. Usually I'm pretty annoyed preparing for the stimpack party and repair afterwards. Just thought hey wait a sec, jumped outta PA, threw on fireproof, and threw on white knight. 
---
The scorchbeast did almost nothing to me. Like teeny tiny hits from the sonic blast. Only thing that hit me was the spray. I kind of just... walked away. Kept exploring the buildings nearby. A little annoying have sonic blasts while you're picking up Cram, but yeah. Eventually it buggered off out of boredom. Killed probably 2 scorched that came with it. They were confused by my not being anywhere nearby.
---
It felt like the winds had finally shifted. Come at me you dirty bats
---
I should probably pay more attention to the minor details. I literally had that staring back at me on the Lonesome Road duster and never made the connection
---
Kinda irrelevant but a challenge that requires someone to have ten and a half months game time is ridiculous. If someone played or at least left their game on 12 hours a day, every day it would take them a year and nine months.
---
Don't forget "Plan:  Missle Launcher" which actually permits you to build something completely different called a Missile Launcher the lies these people tell
---
I am using pistil/rifle sneak nuild.  My only pistol I use is 10mm with armor piercing.  I switch between it and my hunter sniper piercing muffled rifle, then use blackpowder pistol/dragon when crit cat is full.  I also am working on my lever action sniper rifle with no muzzle from a distance or when stealth doesnt count.  Only probs is its taking some time to get long scope and anything armor piercing.  The 10mm is decent at quickly building up crit and doing decent dmg as long as I am still in stealth.
---
Great idea but one problem. I use the excavator armour and can carry upto 500+ kg . Sometimes I go overweight by 200 at 700 kgs after making my daily runs. I need to trade/scrap items and walking with it long distances is punishment enough :/ 
---
That being said I am sure I am not the only one. 
---
did it resolve for you? did you try relogging, ect. youre not really giving much info.....
---
Hi I'm Falcon with with gameranx and here's a list of the top 10 video game bugs turned into enemies. 
---
Even though I dont think it's a good game per se, I'm still enjoying it and feel like I've got my money's worth. It's not bad for what it is, but it isnt amazing for what it's trying to be. It's just fun to explore the world, and find all these left over stories.
---
TMI
---
My husband accepted an invite from a random player. I had my suspicions but he swore it was ok. They went to his camp and placed tons of items, and on a wall spelled out NAME IS A CUNT. It wasn't as malevolent as your experience, but it still shows that you need to be careful.
---
Hemlock Holes is super important to mass-produce Acid out of, especially since a lot of extractors now give ores instead of scraps.
---
The durability as I've been told and seen, is calculated based on the hits to an enemy from your weapon, so shooting in the air does nothing, but hitting an enemy does, added up for each projectile, I believe only shotguns are balanced for this naturally, so any other gun will break quickly with multiple projectiles, for example, beam splitter, shotgun barrel, the two shot legendary affix, etc.
---
I've got a level 5 explosive executioners .44 revolver.
---
Found it at level 20-something.
---
Now I'm level 46 and it's still the most powerful weapon I have found.
---
Yeah this sub is... an interesting place. 
---
Sorry, I tried logging out and back in three times and finally the last time I just had to wait a little while for everything to work as it's supposed to. I'll edit the post.
---
Very cool. I love seeing peoples creations
---
That's a great idea! ZERO entry permitted!
---
Ah, great callout, thank you!  Will add to the guide: 
---
At a tinkerer's workshop, you can combine 2 plastic with \~10-30 of a lower-value resource to turn it into a single "bulk" unit that still counts as that 10-30 of it.
---
1. The most immediate effect is that it allows you to sell resources to vendors that are worth less than 1 cap per scrap.
---
2. It lowers the weight of lead and aluminum (by 50%?).  You also 'save' small amounts of weight by consuming 2 plastic to form the bulk item.
---
3. It gives you a 30% chance to double the scrap via Super Dooper.
---
Bulking may not be relevant for low-level players, especially if you are short on plastic!
---
They're easier to get once you know where a bunch of spawn points and/or are strong enough to take out sentry bots, but for people just getting into PA they can be a struggle.Plus, most of the ones you find in the world only have ~50% charge, whereas the generator pops out full ones.
---
I don't think you need to be at the location you be able to build it, I think you just need the plans. I've built several sets out of the Station I have at my own CAMP.
---
Sad story, I don't even own the game, but I visit this reddit more often than the official bethesda people.
---
 Hang yer guns over the edge as far as you can. It makes a big difference if they can shoot pretty well straight down, where molerats are concerned, as thy chew on your walls.
---
if its single shot explosive does that mean you can make it full auto explosive?
---
For me it's become smoother then it's ever been. For my buddy it's been d/c after d/c 🤷🏾‍♂️
---
Same happened to a mate and me the other night. We are about level 30, no one else around the area and we get level 68 super mutants with a few level 22, 42 thrown in for good measure. We cleared them out eventually but when I went into a building they all respawned again outside. No ammo, no stimpacks, died three times.
---
Atom’s Judgement ! I know it’s not gonna happen so I’ll agree with others and say at the very least green house and concrete building sets
---
Umm.....ew
---
Guys: thruster. If you didn't already know this. You're welcome. 😀
---
What does it actually unlock?
---
That's the point, it DOES make a difference. Nothing loads until everything loads now. During that second load-screen you're not taking damage. When it ends you are free and clear to move, draw your weapon, run, jump etc., all things you couldn't do until a further 20 odd seconds of loading occurred, all the while taking damage.
---
The point where you can see what is going on is the point you have full control of your character. That wasn't the case before.
---
Hell if they made the nuka girl rocketsuit a hazmat, I might consider actually buying it.
---
True they would have to make some adjustments, maybe you get x amount of time before having to dropdown the extra weight? Or maybe they keep track of what your previous carry weight was after unequipping something and this gets reset after x amount of time. Having an unlimited carry weight is an issue as it is since it can affect the server. Even a hard cap limit of 1k would be good enough to make life a small hit harder on dupers.
---
Oh. Well there went my potential punch party through a silo "for science" purposes.
---
Oh well.
---
It would hurt a lot of legit players though. My carry weight is 570 and I often hit 1800-2000 at whitesprings. Even if I did constant inventory management the entire time I’m there, which would really piss me off, I’d still be at a good 700-900. The limits on movement speed, constant stamina usage and not being able to fast travel is enough. The game itself requires you to go overweight sometimes to make the most out of the opportunities.
---
Sell the Radaway at the In-Game Vendors, then pawn of Fusion Cores for like 5 Caps a piece. If you ever need them, you can get like 4 at a time by just killing Whitesprings Sentry Bots.
---
It's select button on xbox. Changes from green to yellow transparent
---
It's a feature btw
---
I've been moving towards a heavy weapon build but I'm starting to get tired of just grinding steel and lead constantly, even with ammosmith
---
PS4 strict melee if you want to raid together 
---
I've had several 2shots drop for me. A .44, 10mm sub, and a handmade (my baby). I've even had one double le barrel shotty drop as double ammo with +50% limb damage that carried me through about 30 levels, it was lvl25. But I've yet to see a TSE. This is all with very light legendary farming. 
---
Cause everyone is in witchhunt mode. Basically anyone who is a high level, has any end game gear, etc... is now subject to public scrutiny. Standing with someone at your base for more than 5 seconds? DEFINITELY A DUPER, GET THE PITCHFORKS!
---
It is...
---
No, just let that garbage die!
---
&gt; Any weight over 10k on a character gets inventory deleted per Bethesda sources
---
Where did you hear this? I somehow missed it.
---
I thought you needed to finish the quest to build the set. 
---
Well to me there are three tiers: (1) things I have enough/too much of and will keep getting more than enough so DON'T PICK IT UP.  Read: steel, most of the time. (2) Things I regularly use and need to keep gathering or else I'll eventually run out. And (3) things I'm out of or almost out of and need more RIGHT NOW.  This often happens if you treat a (2) like a (1) for too long.  Like...wtf I can't repair my armor because I don't have RUBBER?  Wait WTF has rubber in it???
---
Also, screws when you need to make excavator or repair power armor.  You need it 10x more than you need other things, but you still need those other things too.
---
beserkers explosive combat shotgun
---
I have two doors in front.  One locked with a level 3 lock, the other, no lock.  Good luck getting  boys.
---
no worries just the more info you give the more people can help. sounds like its desynch or lag, waiting for a bit will probably fix it every time. sometimes when i load into my base i have to let the game sit and load everything. 
---
That's what I do. You can fix individual things in build mode, but its cheap and easy to fix everything.
---
Interesting.  Does it not drop for you if you already know it?  Might be the case why I am not getting it when I kill the SBQ.  I think I had it in my base before I started going to the nuke site for SBQ.
---
When you see "Daedric shrine" in Fallout comments and don't even blink....
---
There will be the option to host our own servers eventually.
---
Ball gag.
---
Whip.
---
Sorry no, on PC.  But thanks for the offer!
---
Haha I love it, and yes I need the dense mod badly, I need it for robot chest piece if anybody knows where to reliably get it? And power armor is weak in comparison to sentinel, people who throw away armour because they think all they need is power armor make me sad. I can stand in the middle of a swarm of ghouls and shoot them with my TSE, killing all of them at once and taking a tiny sliver of damage. I can also stand there and have another player whacking on me or shooting me taking no damage, then I just pop them with a couple and they go down.
---
Yeah, what you want? Xbox 
---
I knew something was off when I read that. I never actually noticed until now
---
My issue is that this game has *so much potential*, but based on what was delivered at launch and the aftermath of that, I don't think Bethesda will be actively updating this game in 2 years time.
---
I feel like the players should hold a company like Bethesda accountable for what they're selling to us. A lot of people feel scammed by what was delivered. I for one did not expect much from the game content-wise, but man, the number of game-breaking bugs and crashes really wore down on me. And inventory management - did they even test their game internally? Those are my gripes, coming from a Lvl 150.
---
Mirelurks, all the way down
---
Cannot be TSE +90% reduced weight and mutated..
---
Lvl 68.
---
Millions of pounds.
---
No.  Just... no.
---
I have never PvP’ed and I dont use power armor. I chose all of the perks that prevent you from using power armor. This psa does not pertain to me
---
PvP in this game is a freakin' joke right now with all the bugs, glitches, and dupers.
---
My username is xxbakedpotato1xx I'm down 
---
They break reeeeeally fast
---
But you'll probably want the science cards (three of the fuckers...) as I think they help with damage?
---
What, the leather harness and pairs of handcuffs not good enough for you?
---
I feel like if this was something to actually be completed it would be 760 hours. This makes me think it's a joke. Or maybe their way of showing this is a long term game lol
---
The right question is why do people dupe ? When I asked them, the common answer was “there are guys charging outrageous amounts of money for these weapons” I remember those guys, on discord groups. They were often dicks and showing off thier TSE handmades. 
---
We need to address issues from the root. Not just pull out the root. 
---
Thank you, me too! Any time I see another camp in game I have to go investigate! I keep pics of the most interesting designs for my loading screens :P
---
Yeah running around as a floating head and magical disembodied jazz hands almost made up for all those deaths to invisible supermutants in my camp.  My art must live on
---
👍🏻 👍🏻 your an amazing person, keep it up !
---
This is normal in any random loot game.  What you have to recognize is that the more often you roll the dice, the more likely it is that the number you want will come up.  This is why server hopping is a thing(and why savescumming was a thing in FO4).
---
If they make "special" items more common, they feel less "special" when you get them.  I don't know if FO76 is in the sweet spot for this kind of thing, but I recognize that players(including me), aren't particularly good at judging the sweet spot.  Anybody that hasn't gotten what they want thinks the system is bad, anybody that has gotten what they want thinks the system is good.
---
Idk maaan - I got 6 small purifiers chilling in my camp. I leave and do a few events/vendors and come back to them all filled will (2) in each total 12. Works fine for me. I even drop water now for low levels who need it. 
---
He isn’t. His op was perfectly pleasant. He didn’t even insult duper’s. His oh well post was also not insulting, and may have only seemed a tiny bit snarky because the other guy was being sarcastic. Calling him a dick makes you a dick, ya dick.
---
you dont blow yourself up with full sentinel+dense. I know bcause when i am overencumbered i purposely blowmyself up to respawn somewhere else to fast travel. I have to intentionally move towards the wall im shooting or crouch to deactivate sentinel, or i only lose like 1 hp
---
I’ll have to go hunt for a tick whoever my game decides it wants to be done updating
---
FMR?
---
Thank you. It’s what little I can do to help the world till I am at a better place.
---
Doesn’t the spot light increase turret range?
---
"Blunderbuss"
---
Nope, still using my hand-made rifle as a solution to all my answers
---
Is the bullet explode in area damage not considered tse? 
---
Because the pistol has all 3 modifiers. I just wish I could post a pic but the option is greyed out
---
Yeah that sounds like my issue as well. That's probably a pretty good fix then.
---
Oh yeah. Do a medic build right and you can turn three dudes with super sledges into Asgardian legends
---
I have no idea. I hate automatics. I blow thru too much ammo. 
---
Just keep going.  I don't really go out of my way to find them.  I just collect the ones in whitespring bunker and turn in however much I got, which is usually 1 or 2, 3 if I'm lucky.
---
i got half a bottle of thunderbird somewhere I've been savin' for such an occassion
---
Don’t think that idea will work very well. Honestly I’d be surprised if they haven’t given all items unique id’s so duplicated items are known about from there being multiple versions of an item with the same id. If they have done that they might be waiting until they know for sure that the dupe exploits are patched so they can wipe all duped items all at once.
---
Vaultboy has chosen a new champion.
---
Of all the things that im willing to suspend my disbelief for in this game, longer barrels weighing less than shorter barrels is just something I cant look past.
---
I found that out today when i blew through 500 10 mm bullets fighting like 5 or 6 mole miners
---
that's also part of the mod on pc
---
You know, if any of those players were legitimate we had issues with people witch hunting before. You feel great about yourself, but none of us have won. 
---
i want some actual team gear.  not just white hats
---
Didn't that NoClip documentary show one of the devs talking about how they asked for help from all their studios, even the one that manages Fallout Shelter?
---
Was wondering about those guys.  I couldn't find a consistent spot.
---
Yeah these guys aren't stacking 4 or 5, they are stacking hundreds.  From what I can gather it's a cumulative effect.  So day 1 on small guns 25%, spend the day doing the log out business, you'll be 200%.  Keep doing this every day for a week... Well you see where I'm headed.  I could be wrong on how it functions.  I'm not out there trying to cheat, I do everything just fine without cheating.
---
But if this SBQ keeps glitching out and becoming unkillable when a bunch of noobs show up, I may consider altering my playstyle
---
Plus he's the *only* human NPC in Fallout 76. That's reason enough IMO.
---
I honestly wish that all items that originally were in FO4 were obtainable in-game (in this case, the pirate hat) while the atom shop could feature some new items instead.
---
They nerfed the  xp you get in nuke zones 
---
Yeah, just accepted it.
---
Yeah, I definitely had a two shot version of all my guns before upgrading to explosive as well, the damage buff is just too good to pass up especially with full demo expert. I basically leveled as fast as I could to 50 ( so things I found would matter even endgame) then proceeded to legendary farm my ass off. I've spent way more time killing ghouls at whitespring and doing uranium fever/violent night than doing any quests. I still haven't found anything else really, and for reference the only quest chains I've done are the brotherhood and the enclave.
---
No eye patch though? But you can use the meat hook mod, get pretty close to captain hook!
---
FYI "TSE" stands for Two Shot Explosive.
---
Me: "Oooh, what's that stuff?!"
---
&lt;Sssssssssss&gt;
---
&lt;face melts off&gt;
---
Be careful out there, pilgrims.
---
Damn, I've been running Assassin but with Sentinel that sounds beastly. 
---
I have a feeling with all this damage mitigation, bleed and poison weapons might start seeing some popularity.
---
2 or 3% weight difference is beside the point, what exactly is the benefit of a short barrel over a long barrel? There doesn't seem to be any, and a stupid weight penalty that makes no sense further shows there is no benefit to using a short barrel.
---
 The fastest way to level is to kill high number stuff. Find the highest level things you can survive and kill, and get to work. ;)
---
I have an explosive Gatling laser and I still see the lasers.
---
TSE weapons should be rare, duping makes rare items common. If it was easy to get a TSE which duping has done it becomes pointless to farm for them when you can buy one for a few caps
---
Separate players with different rules for different servers.  Want to dupe and run with 1000 bobbleheads?  Great!  Here's your server.  Want to play with a +100lb over the limit rules?  Step this way.   
---
The problem is we have different play styles on the same server.  I don't want to play PvP, I find it pointless but do like helping new players.  Give me the option to play without PvP so I can enjoy building and collaborating. 
---
Me too i love my tse i play alone too, and the tse makes it fun for me
---
&gt; Muh immershun!  
---
Is it that hard to believe the BoS member who setup that cache made a typo?
---
Why I come here I thought it was exploding bullets in area damage. 
---
I can see why tse would be so amazing 
---
Protectrons will blow themselves up if you shoot off both arms, which usually just takes two shots.
---
Thanks for the bit of defense, there, at least.
---
If by “git guud,” you mean exploiting glitches in the game to become OP, then no. Cheating takes no skill to do at all.
---
Can confirm.  Holy crap turning it on results in a moment of total blindness.  I may have to try the colored headlamps.
---
TSE means it is two shot and explosive. Explosive just adds area of effect explosive damage on impact, two shot doubles each trigger pull to fire 2 shots for the price of one. 
---
Awesome
---
I've got a fool proof way to kill any robot in about three shots.
---
Shotgun. Target weapons, cripple.
---
When the robot has no weapons they use their last resort. Self destruct.
---
For protectrons it's 3 shots. Arm, arm, leg.
---
Assaultrons are 4. Head, arm, arm, leg.
---
I grab a leg because they try to get right up on you for the explosion.
---
Luck of the draw doesn't repair to fill, just restores some durability.
---
It does work over 100%.
---
for now atleast yeah! might do good to report it to them aswell. 
---
Recently I've had several deaths from radiation from logging out at whitesprings and then ending up in a server where it's been nuked so I'm stuck outside with no PA for 30+ seconds of immobility while the game loads
---
1. Higher stash limits. A LOT higher.
---
2. Bigger building budgets (Minus turrets)
---
3. Make plans more obtainable by making them downloadable from a terminal or something.  Not something looted by everyone with a horrible spawn time.
---
4. Ability to put armor over the Hazmat suit for people who want to play in blast zones without PA.
---
5. Make pacifist mode work both ways, cannot hurt or be hurt by other players.  If you turn it off, you have a 20 min cool-down before you can turn it back on.
---
&gt;I’m betting most downvoters will be sympathizers or duper’s themselves.
---
Honestly this is probably the truth. If you play the game normally without rushing, you wouldn't have hundreds of a single item. Besides, you don't even need hundreds of a single item like that so stop hoarding it and gumming up the servers.
---
The single action is cool but has the lowest dps of all the revolvers because of its stupid slow reload speed.

It's fun when you walk into someone's camp area and try to admire their hard work only for their pet cow you aggro you so then the turrents start shooting at you
---
This is one of those changes that will just keep making the game more and more satisfying to play. We need it 
---
Just throw them on the ground. Nobody needs more fusion cores.
---
One way to fix the dupe issue would be raise the level to 75, in a DLC this would make all weapons duped pointless.  While it would not solve all the issues it would fix a lot of them
---
Ya sometimes they spawn by the gazeobo 
---
Or make one of your party mates perpetually share the perk card.
---
...
---
Yeah I don't understand it either
---
Title referencing a song by chance?
---
Ive got an explosive laser and its performance is pretty subpar compared to ballistic versions.   I got a beam splitter on it and itll generally drop charred ghouls in 4-5 shots.  Its not a bad weapon, just not as good as other options.
---
Except neither one of my ps4s decided to update the game. Just got off work expecting to jump into the wasteland. Nope gotta wait another hour
---
I cant imagine why you would need duped legendary. As you level they outgrow usefulness and you just end up dropping them because you're in the middle of nowhere O.E. and dont have the patience to walk back to camp and then spend 45 minutes deciding what's worth removing from the stash for it.
---
Where does your post at all even mention duping??? And you delete my comment? Pathetic. Leave the game if you dont like the fucking server you're on. Smh. 
---
Its completely possible hell you can even launch all 3 nuke silos at once
---
It's hard to target. Easier from behind.

Same thing happened to me last night, but at munitions workshop. 
---
I had over 6 turrets and a "defend the workshop" event started up and the turrets didn't even fire once.
---
That's very likely, when you have this setup your ap goes down when shot (because of dodgy) however you take no damage. When the ap goes to zero though you die pretty quick. The only really effective things that kill me are high RoF weapons that land alot of hits quick, bleed and poison like you said, radiation, or the people who dupe and have 50000 explosive bobbleheads buffing them.
---
This games bad who plays this 
---
probably also fires at less than half the speed, so he probably still wins out in dps
---
It would hurt a few legit players, but realistically you shouldn't be able to move if you weigh 1 ton haha. And if large inventories impact server performance they either need to remove the code causing impact or make it so it causes less of an impact
---
where are you guys building? and how many turret's are putting down... the higher your defense the more you get attacked.
---
&gt; Can you run 2 instances at once on PC provided your computer can handle it?  
---
Yes, the game will happily launch and log in to different accounts. It stutters like crazy though which is unique to FO76... I can play FO76 and a different game (or three) with no problems.
---
One thing to note is how powerful weight reduction perks are, many of which can reduce a multitude of items weight by a factor of 10. What happens if you have to take away those cards in order to access others? You can easily go from 300 weight to 3000. I would rather not make a weapon class unusable for the sake of a minor inconvenience of people with no disregard for the game.
---
Pussy where you mention glitches or dupes? Gtfo 
---
You have to pick up your camp and move it
---
It’s known, something to do with water purifiers and wires -.-
---
A camp move should recitify
---
That’s exactly what I was thinking a little while after I posted this. I felt like if the buff stacking on bobbleheads didn’t exist, nobody would even have that many on them at a time, especially since they’re heavy.
---
Any robot will if you disarm it. Some gutsys have one weapon, others have more.
---
I'm with you 100% if I could enter a nuke zone without using a fat stack of diluted radaway or valuable radshield, I'd almost never use the PA. Usually have it while wandering for the jetpacking. Always checking if buildings can let me CAMP in funky spots, hah.
---
Legendary synergy &gt; raw defense every time. And who wants to be another faceless suit or armor with a super sledge running around? It's weird, but I see people more as a fellow player or person when they're out of the suit. With everyone looking the same, I'm just sorta like, ah, another talking giant robot beetle. Hello.
---
When I'm running PA for heavy weapons, I actually have the helmet off unless strictly needed. Lose some defense but I feel like I'm playing my character, not a mech suit. Have the helmet hotkeyed to - for when it needs some light/ventilation/shits gettin real time to go full defense.
---
Feels more "immersive" to me. PA as the be all end all just feels soooo dulllll.
---
On the subject of Unarmed Melee/Sneak builds: As long as you invest in the defensive perks--Barbarian, Blocker, Ironclad, Evasive--and there are some others that could prove useful such as Adamantium Skeleton, you shouldn't worry much when in a Hazmat Suit. I went toe to toe with the SB Queen with scorched and other varmints attacking me and never once feared for my life. One word of warning, hazmat suit or no, beware of getting swarmed by large groups of enemies such as ghouls--always have an escape plan. Getting surrounded by Bloated Glowing Ones at Whitesprings by yourself is no fun! Marsupial can be a lifesaver if that ever happens, as you can simply jump out of their reach.
---
On a positive note, with max stealth perks (and shrouded wooden armor), it won't happen often, as most everything will be dead before they ever knew you were there.
---
Tf that's op
---
the camo one is just as shit
---
non-PA has other effects/mods that drastically reduce the amount of damage taken from players shooting 2 shot explosive weapons  
---
1-dense torso mod removes roughly 60-70% of explosive damage (not sure on the exact number, thats what ive been told and it seems accurate from experience)  
---
2-sentinel removes 15% damage per armor piece, so x5 pieces, you avoid 75% damage when ou are standing still (can also use cavalier to have the same reduction while sprinting)  
---
3-assassin legendary can be on the same piece as sentinel and it removes 8% damage per piece, so x4 pieces you avoid 40% of damage  
---
4-only 3\* pieces have sentinel/cavalier so you get a bonus legendary in the 2nd slot, which have some very good ones like +1 agi, +1 end or increased AP refresh  
---
all of those effects stack. so many explosive weapons bounce off doing only a few HP per hit. it is probably even more tanky now that they buffed fireproof
---
I've got 6 turrets, and i'm on a cliff above the Charleston fire department. 
---
I'm more irritated about the sponginess of the enemies. 
---
Tf that's op. Thanks :)
---
Me too. Over never duped and won’t but I can see the motivation behind it. My friend is getting frustrated because of the hundreds of legendaries he’s looted, he’s come across one explosive weapon and it was a pistol. Just gave it to me because it was useless to him. I have found two out of a couple thousand legendaries and only 3-4 two shots.
---
Even if those two effects weren’t all I was looking for, I’d still be throwing away most of my legendaries because they’re all ridiculously weak effects. I literally have a ghoul slayers gamma gun.
---
Maybe you should resist next time, so that Bethesda doesn’t continue to release shitty and buggy games, and yet still has the balls to charge real money for items that should have been in the game for free to begin with. 
---
Didn't even know it was broken but sweet!
---
Ive got a pretty nice house built with an attached garage. I like it when lower levels show up.  I give them stuff and give them a tour. When a higher level shows up I usually log out as fast as I can.  Ive had the unfortunate experience of having my base and my buddies base destroyed just for shIts and giggles.  I put a lot of time and effort to have something nice and it's a pain to rebuild it.  Ive not been lucky enough to have shared a nice experience of having a 90+ level player show up to my base. 
---
For scrapping, is there a better way to get screws? Logically it doesn't make sense to me that it takes screws to make weapons but I can't recover them when they are scrapped. Even with the perk to get more out of scrapped weapons/armor. 
---
I understand this thread is specific to what to keep and toss, but I feel this is important to mention. The amount of junk used to repair and item does not scale with condition. If your weapon is 10% or 100% damaged, the cost appears to remain the same.  If you are going to fix your gear at any opportunity to avoid surprise breakage in combat, you'll have to collect a lot more junk to replenish your stash.
---
He didn't say if it was double barrel, pump, or combat, also it doesn't matter when I have twice the range and accuracy as well as only needing one shot to end it.
---
The more mayhem the merrier
---
That sounds accurate.  It should only take like 12 minutes for 1 to fill up completely.  Try it yourself though.  Empty them all and then wait the 5-10 minutes.  Only 1 water will appear in 1 purifier, not 1 in each purifier.
---
The middle area between the main resort and the bungalows can have a grafton monster, a deathclaw, wolves, radscorpions, yao guais, mole rats, and mongrel dogs I think.  
---
I play
---
Drop them in the blue suitcase in Watoga train station.  That seems to be the common drop off.  The overseers camp is another good spot.  
---
Mines fixed in last patch. Try moving your camp. 
---
It’d be an extremely temporary fix.
---
giddyup buttercups &amp; globes
---
There’s one that spawns in the ‘river’ by Poseidon, and one next to the workshop with all the acid up top.
---
I just w as not more torture stuff and more items to make my camp look like a  psycho lives there.
---
weird flex but ok
---
edit: who even cares about up/down votes
---
What loser joins a sub just to talk shit?
---
Did you download the update? Should be up
---
If they fix duping it would be pretty permanent, as all the lvl 50 weapons would be weak vs lvl 75 weapons
---
I thought the doubling effect didn't apply to bulking items. I've doubled ultracite armor, 50 cal guns and so on, but I don't think I've ever seen it go off on a bulk item.
---
I moved mine post patch and it still happened, will move soon but it sucks that i spent so long building my camp and i have to wipe it in order to finish
---
Claim workshops, beat the first attack, get plans, then do the same with another workshop and repeat. You'll be getting xp, caps, items, plans, etc. I do runs of Whitespring and take workshops and just fight random stuff when going around and do some events. etc.
---
Been there, done that, bought the T-shirt.
---
I'm pretty much in the same boat. I've got two characters to 80+, done all the content I can find, dropped nukes, killed SBQs, walked friends through the quests and helped them level up, and done every event until I just can't take it anymore. Pretty much waiting on something new to do at this point and keeping myself occupied with other games. The end game really needs some love right now. They've said they have plans, hope to hear some real details soon. 
---
The quest is you building the armor
---
Well yeah, but that’s only if they finally fix it, lmao.
---
From the very limited feedback I’ve read only one image was previewed. If that in fact is the case it’s pretty shady to hide the ugly shit behind the one good looking thing. Granted the amount of points required for that many paint jobs seems like a good deal but only to the person who is able to view all the content and make an informed decision. The downside in this case may not of been so drastic who knows but they might plan for future bundles and how they are able to be viewed.
---
I think his/her plan was to only have certain items not stack in inventory.  So junk would show as x200 but explosive bobbleheads would not.  Seems like a better solution than what we have.
---
Well yeah, but that’s only if they *finally* fix it.
---
It’s fucking terrible. I had 60-90 minutes of play before the first crash, then just minutes of play until crashing after that. I’ve restarted the box, rebuilt the DB. Now I’m reinstalling.
---
Piece of shit software. 
---
Only fully destroyed items. Or only if there is at least one fully destroyed thing. 
---
you realize all rise level is tied to your character level when you acquire it, right?  So if you wait till lvl 50 you get a lvl 50 allrise (or whatever max lvl super sledge is, can't remember if its 45 or 50 off the top of my head)...
---
God dammit, after hours of searching for bright headlamps for all my PA sets...
---
 please tell me I dont have to spend hours searching for standard headlamps again.
---
Imo the bright headlamp was a little too bright to begin with. 
---
I know it should but the fact that it happens at all is still ridiculous. I shouldn't have to tear down my CAMP to finish it, that being said this is also a fresh camp that I moved a couple days after patch
---
Still trying to find a good legendary right leg. It just won't drop. Also, the "known plans" mod for PC is amazing and has given me a way to hunt down all the plans I still need without having to waste caps. 
---
I spend about the first hour every day doing my vendor loop. After that it's just bouncing around the map doing events and hitting up spots that have a good chance to spawn a legendary, and occasionally dropping a nuke when I feel like the server is stable enough. 
---
I have gotten several random combat armor pieces from turning them in too. 
---
Just found out me and my brother were banned. I’m filling a support ticket now. This is just ridiculous. 
---
i only cared in that i didnt understand why anyone disapproved. i thought that it was possible that there was some angle that i missed or something that i was wrong about, so i figured i would ask
---
Find a Gattling Laser and have a laser show? 
---
Dude omg Ill never hear the scorchbeast screech the same ever again 😂😂😂
---
I was wondering about that extra load screen (on PC), that make sense.
---
Not saying that those drops don't happen at lower luck, but just less frequently. Everything in this game is based off a single Stat. Melee damage is based on strength. Crits are based on, agility I think. Durability of crafted items is based on intelligence. What's so hard to believe that luck effects drop rates? 
---
ill have to check when i finish work.
---
Send me your psn and ill add you this arvo and let you know
---
It would reduce server load too. That's a lot less information to need to track and access every time someone logs in. 
---
My god
---
It's beautiful 
---
I can tell you this they ain't fixed the current dupe, it happened to my buddy after the patch today, a melon he ate reappeared
---
I'm guilty of trying a patched ini edit that I'd come across youtube a month back that let you jump out of bounds in an attempt to grab a randomly flown away SBQ. Thought just using it for a second and that a simple ini command line being able to do it wouldn't be a huge problem. Didn't work, oh well. So I get that feeling.
---
If you succumb, maybe make it a weapon class you're not remotely specced into. Make it your "this shit is broken, time to delete it" troubleshooter. Ahhh that was a good one. But yeah. Keep you from losing any difficulty, but giving you some power back if the game has something unplayable.
---
There's no need to fix duping. Let people have fun!
---
Mackdaddycash 
---
How long till your on u think?
---
My rocket turrets melt anything that decides to spawn near my camp. It's funny to since my camp is near a giant cliff wall so they can spawn at the top and I watch them die from falling off.
---
The kind who loves fallout but refuses to play trash like this recent game idk if you got the brains to comprehend that this game is just shit. Bethesda=the new ea or activision with money grabbing MT and falsely advertised products 
---
Legendary Liberators exist? 
---
I live by Luck if the Draw. Rarely do I fix my woe anymore. Energy weapons are the exception here as they break very rapidly in comparison to any other weapon type. Looking forward to the patch on that. Also a perk card lowering of the requirements to repair weapons would be fantastic given we already have one for armor &amp; PA.
---
So instead of fixing the issue, they just give us another loading screen. Even then, it’s still not 100%. I sometimes still freeze or see nothing (poor render).
---
There are workshops in the Great Divide? I’ll do that!
---
This is the scene on Xbox, unfortunately. I get that we all have different experiences on here but the more I poke around on here the more I see horror stories like this. IMO they should remove the PvP from the open world and just let the sweatbags queue up for PvP events separately. Add duped TSE weapons to the mix and you have a really poor PvP experience. 
---
The best legendaries I came across were a level 35 bloodied explosive handmade that I passed on to a friend and a level 45 version that I kept for myself.
---
Realism isn’t really an argument that can be used in Fallout, in any of the titles. That’s something you’d use in DayZ or Scum. Anyway I do think your idea is good but there’d need to be a massive buff to the personal stash for it to work otherwise half the player base would be useless.
---
What you mean?
---
I honestly don't think many people missed the sarcasm. It's just a dumb comment. 
---
This is why I can't stand PvP. It doesn't matter the game. Griefers and trolls will either ruin your fun, or hyper inflate the economy so the good stuff is just out of reach. 
---
I always play as if they are single player- GTA 5, Eve, and when I eventually get around to purchasing it, FO76.
---
I rebuilt the database to see if it will improve.
---
I actually learned about it from a post by Rocket League on Twitter lol
---
It would be nice for me too if it didn't flash a super bright version of the world for a second before switching to the second load screen.
---
Youtube is the worst thing to ever happen to fan made walkthroughs. Everyone wants to make videos these days, and 90% of them are not only terrible, they never answer the question the video is about to begin with.
---
Camp items should slowly regain health back. 
---
I also noticed the same on ps4 after the update. Also noticed the rifle fires while reloading without waiting until it fully reloads. I'm much happier with my lever rifle, but am still looking for weapon upgrades for it. 
---
This is not what I expected....ooooh, *Altohoclics.*
---
And yes, good tips and Poseiden does have a pita layout. I didn't make it the first time I tried. /shame
---
Definitely, you can never be truly "Min/maxed" in power armor, until they add legendary power armor pieces, then it would be a different story. I totally agree with you, the movement feels so much faster and "free" outside of power armor, I won't lie, I used my X01 extensively in my early levels, it is even speced for my low health build with emergency protocols and such, but once I got my legendary armor set together, I haven't put it back on except for nukes, and even then, I will often try to hazmat it. I love that they made clothing items worn over armor so you can have your defense, and still look however you want to rp. I am wearing an army helmet with gasmask and goggles combined with a hunter long coat. I am trying to get that lone survivalist/ deadly stealth sniper look. I also have always had a soft spot for the NCR ranger mask, and this comes "sorta" close.
---
I'm level 84 or something and the best melee weapon I have is All Rise. I've been rocking that since level 50 or so.
---
Best Rifle I have is a two shot pipe rifle. That's literally the best weapon I have ever gotten and it's legit good for a sniper build. It's not fast but with a couple of perks it's not shit. It is shit for any non sniper because it's slow and holds only 6 rounds.
---
I have yet to get a legendary that doesn't suck ass. Nocturnal and Assassins stuff gets sold or dropped instantly. Same for the energy weapons, they break too damn fast. Only explosive I've ever seen was a Gauss but I lost that because the server disconnected right after I murdered the ghoul who had it...
---
And on top of that I of course missed the level range for the Handmade Plans so I'm SoL on that front as well. Farming them to scrap and get the mods takes ages plus I refuse to make an alt just to get the plan, Bethesda needs to fix the levelled  lists for mob drops and vendor inventories, period.
---
Make the update apply for legendary weapons/armor and bobble heads. Would effect zero legit players regarding weapons/armor and bobble heads would be a small thing for some legit players.
---
Regardless make it for weapons and armor and whatever type of item that is frequently be duped but not be in stacks by legit players. Simple fix that does not fix everything but imagine 500 two shots taking up 500 rows in the inventory or the container used for duping.
---
Eh, I like aggressive.
---
Just asking. No need to be so sensitive. Jeez!
---
It’s rough when you’re under equipped. My guns are all pea shooters. I found a ghoul slaying 40% faster medium speed cultist blade someone discarded. Spec’d into one-handed, and now they don’t stand a chance. 
---
I’m a filthy casual but that blade, a stock ski sword for the rest, and a set of Excavator makes me the terror of whitesprings. 
---
My motivation is to mention the common reasons many subreddits block link submissions in response to your question. I've also heard some block them to discourage low-quality posts (destinythegame) or to prevent SPAm (TIFU).
---
I've also seen the opposite, like Dashcamgifs and Idiotsincars that do not allow text posts since it kinda goes against their target
---
I try to reset my conscience karma every once in a while. Go from trap room killing players that wander out into the divide, alone and unprepared, to walking through flatwoods calling out "stimpacks and ammo for sale! Stimpacks and ammo!" Going rate was 1 cap per round, and per diluted stimpack, 5 caps for standard stim, and negotiable on explosives as i carry a LOT of frag mirvs 
---
It costs four hundred thousand scraps of steel to fire this weapon...for *twelve seconds* 
---
I have a drill in the stash and I will do some test and compare it to the mr handy. weird weapons are fun so i have always kept them when found
---
A fine rifle can solve many problems, it is true...but to remedy a situation with honor men must look beyond paltry tools to settle their grievances and aspire to nobler means of redress.
---
It's like a bad relationship lol I've basically dumped this hoe tho. My current bae Warframe is treating me very nice ;)
---
That's why I vendored mine. Wasn't 50. Really need a "buy back quest items you shouldn't have" and "buy upgraded versions of quest items you've earned" vendor :( 
---
i had 3 of the mbut after last week they disappeared  :/ costed me so fucking much 
---
These were the first two times ive been attacked by players. I've built on cliffs and over water in out of the way places, one of my earliest bases was at whitesprings over the creek but as it became more popular and having to sever hop to spawn my base I decided to pack up. My current place has a nice pond with like a cave cove and a little rowboat in it. There's even a place to set an acid extractor down (in the middle of the pond) and I built around that. A big awesome 3 story almost fully furnished (damn you budget!!) Barnwood house with an attached shack. Close ish to site alpha. I've been camping between WS Watoga and Harper's Ferry, trying to be centrally located to the areas I frequent 
---
Overall good idea for leg weapons/ armor and whatever item not stacked en masse by normal players
---
With the four encounters with the beast, at least for me it gets stuck very easily and I use an automatic weapon and go for the head.
---
I feel the exact same way.
---
&gt; im not going to be blaming bethesda on this one. thats literally just passing on the blame.
---
Yeah when was the last time you read 'Criminals blamed for rise in crime' instead of 'Local council/police force blamed for rise in crime'? Get a grip.
---
why would you ask reddit if it takes literally 3 seconds to look up in google?
---
inb4 gets blasted in the face by explosive shotgun
---
I max out vendors every day, 90% of my gameplay is doing the vendor circuit, grabbing lead and steel along the way. I've been hoarding ultracite however ... hundreds of hours in, I still only have 3xx or so in storage. I bulk a lot of other stuff, and sell some of it one-off, like antiseptic, asbestos, screws, black titanium ... I try to keep everything to 50 or less storage space for everything except ultracite, lead and steel. And I ammosmith and super duper ammo every chance I get, with ballistic ammo weight perked down, to reduce the steel and lead load.
---
Sandbox you can
---
&gt; Overall for general PvP, power armor is as good if not superior to what most people have access to.   
---
no  
---
assassin sentinel set can lower the damage of 2 shot explosive guns to similar to slap damage as long as you dont stagger, but power armor always gets one shot by the same guns. its also bad that power armor makes you a massive clear target
---
I dunno, maybe it's simply my take on those types of games. I remember joining a pvp server (solo, not the one I was aying on with friends) and playing a "ninja" style, gamemode where I'd have the bare minimum, hiding a "stash" so to speak and would try and attack the smaller-mediun tribe bases. Just for fun. Alpha tribes existed on the official servers and they were hard /impossible to dethrone, but there's private servers too where the admins would allocate areas to pvp, or have rollback systems in place and have a day every week/fortnight that would be an all out warfare day. If you didn't want to participate you didn't have to, but after the rollback all the bases etc. would get restored.
---
It might be demoralising on the official servers, but that's what that type of game would be about, it's hardly much different to games like rust etc. 
---
I bought the plans from a nice player and made extra to scrap. There are just way too few of them in the wild.
---
I always go back to warframe.. Always! 
---
Same here, 4 crashes within an hour. I give up
---
You da man
---
lmfao what dude. shut the hell up kid. 
---
I'm gonna be more vigilant in going after people with bounties to help combat this. 
---
You suck
---
It's called power Smith, under intelligence
---
Cryolator is manageable, I always have crystal since it's not used for much. But yeah 5 fuel has to be an oversight on besthesda's part.
---
Happy to take them off your hands if you intend to just dump them, I am on PC.
---
We need the Chained Prostitute Outfit from New Vegas.
---
gachiBASS clap
---
Love it so much. I just finished sacrifice and the sortie for today.. Only got kuva but w/e
---
amazing.
---
and i probably took it
---
saw someone sold a Lv50 All Rise to the vendor bot in Harpers Ferry and took it. I already have my own but I'm planning on selling it to someone who wants it.
---
Yes but then u run the risk of a server disconnect and losing all the ammo you've been saving for your mates for a week. It sucks they just need to fix it. 
---
Yeah there are Workshops all over. Contractor perk helps with material cost, and Home Defense and Science 1 will help with some better turrets. Doing the Powering Up Poseidon event a few times will get you the 3 generators, Large, Fusion and Windmill plans. If materials at the workshop are green that means it won't cost you any of your own materials. If white that means it will use your materials. So keep an eye out for that also.
---
I’m
---
Not fond of the toy theme.
---
There’s good items here. But not interested in getting any of them.
---
I think loading screens are faster to, at least on PS4.
---
The lack of early warning (Enclave holotapes) would be explained if that were true.
---
Can you confirm even after resetting the PS4 and rebuilding the database the game still crashes?
---
Yeah I keep pacification on and the one shot thing is by dupers they stack bobbleheads till they do hundreds of thousands of damage
---
Yep, I misunderstood the initial comment. If you change from the proto colours, the only way to go back is to re-craft it.
---
Did that help?
---
gamertag?
---
That's mean. What's ur GT are you on Xbox lol I wanna say hi
---
You can find 15 working mainframe cores around that room :)
---
I definitely appreciate the advice, I’ll keep an eye out for all workshops 
---
Sometimes quests dont update right, logging out and back in usually fixes it. 
---
f#ck me running... colloquial expression
---
you're right
---
No call it Watoga Wacker and have it in the greenbriar.
---
Ok got you
---
Power Plant extractors originally gave 7/hr. 
---
This was adjusted to 1/hr a few weeks back. 
---
Last week it was re-adjusted to 8/hr. 
---
Hope this helps.
---
That's because they've got hundreds (or thousands) of bobbleheads on, not just one or two. They're also combining the duped bobbleheads with the reset bobblehead timer trick that lets you keep the buff on permanently.
---
Pacifist doesn’t stop anything other players do.  At most it may reduce damage another player does to you.  This has been a major complaint for many fallout players.  They don’t want a pvp game they want the traditional fallout play.  Bethesda should look at making servers where pvp isn’t allowed and ones where everyone wants pvp.  It’s quite annoying to play a game with people who just want to piss off other players.  This game isn’t just meant to be pvp saying that if you don’t like it leave is stupid. Repeatedly blowing up someone’s base is childish and serves  no other function then to upset other people.  
---
Well, when you put it that way...
---
I think that swing is the time it takes to start it spinning and be in position to deal the damage. martial artist seems to work on the mr handy saw. it was really fast, a lot faster than the chainsaw which classifies as SLOW according the the pip boy whereas mr handy is v fast. cards dont work ont he chainsaw because it fails to qualify as a type in the perks
---
It’s his birthday

If anyone here has played ARK: Survival Evolved properly, they know that the developers created an entirely new set of official servers at launch, all connected like the previous ones but not connected to the previous ones themselves. So two separated strings of servers. The old servers still exist for those who still wanted to play on them because they had so much progress, and the new ones were created for two reasons - a, to allow new players to compete with everyone else instead of getting ass banged by all the established tribes (not as relevant as b) and b, because the first string of servers had duped shit spread through them.
---
Creating a new string of servers and keeping the old ones allowed anyone who was legit to continue playing their game without losing anything, while the second string allowed anyone to start fresh without duped shit ruining their immersion. Could be a good idea for later on in 76.
---
It seems to be good for some and bad for other.  I have not noticed any more or less issues than normal that I have but my friend has noticed a uptick in issues.   
---
I've pulled 1 explosive combat shotty, thats it. Today I got a bunch of weightless armour though. Too bad none of it matches. 
---
Group of 4 server hopping and doing the quest for the keycard. We also bought a ton from one of the trading subreddits(which were prolly duped...).
---
I imagine something like that would adversely affect the server, and anyone around that person as well.
---
I can’t wait fir people to get more social!
---
Probably the best and easiest thing Bethesda could do is drop the level requirement of the White Knight Perk so that it can be accessed as soon as the repair costs start to go through the roof, Level 25 after the latest update, instead of leaving people scrambling for the resources for 11 (previously 16) levels before they can start building up the perk that, when makes out, causes armor to break 90% more slowly and drops the repair cost to 1 each of Cloth, Steel, Adhesive, Screws, and Ballistic Fiber.  After Level 38 the biggest problem is finding lead for ammo.
---
Honestly, anything that they could do to make the game more about adventure and less about resource management would be fantastic. I like that in this version we have to worry about our resources and try to find them and manage them, something that would be a definite problem in a real scenario like this, but the level that they have it at now is an exercise in tedium, one of the cardinal sins of video game design.
---
As a side note, 3 times in a row my main legendary weapon has broken right at the beginning of a scorch beast fight. Grrrrrrr.
---
You cannot, you can from other players though.
---
It didn't take long for fo76 to devolve into armed camps screeching about demands for balanced PVP but you guys seem to be rehashing the history of online gaming in fast forward, nice
---
So is killing bitches. Duper’s are bitches.
---
If a gentlemen's agreement can be struck as to the means, I see no true flaw in such a method, but do so view it as an *aberration* rather than the *rule*.
---
I must admit that I find the honesty of a blunderbuss to be an *irresistibly* elegant solution and of a grand tradition. To codify any other means seemed too great a deviation from a storied heritage to deem credible.
---
I'm on PC and I almost never run into shitty people in the game. But hanging out on here all day I'd think the game was full of sociopaths.
---
It is a competitive game?
---
Can you raid other people’s bases?
---
Is there leaderboards?
---
It’s not competitive. Just enjoy the game for what it is or move on.
---
Some dick head was one shotting everything during the Uranium event with their TSE so I stood in front of them.
---
I picked up all their junk... it had a lot of screws which was what I needed.
---
Maybe make it more clear that he cheated lmao. The way you wrote it made it sound like he made his base hidden which doesn’t really specify that he was cheating. 
---
I'll post later if I have or don't have any crashes.
---
Those gustys are terrifying! That and the assaultron dominators beam spam
---
Because google didn't show any results for F76? Only for F4...
---
Battling is fine but don’t destroy people’s bases they spend a lot of time to building them
---
&gt;I know damn well youd be bitching about not having PVP if it were gone. 
---
Hah.  Do you, now?  You realize you're talking about a Fallout game, right?  A game that has historically been single-player?  A game whose community fell into open rebellion once they heard that it would be online multiplayer?  You "know" that we'd bitch if there were no PvP?  OK!  
---
Then your frustration is Bethesda’s doing
---
I'm a sniper, and I've only had one legendary rifle drop for me -- a level 35 Instigating Handmade, single star. Which was nice when I was that level, but it's woefully underpowered at my level now.
---
The Stupid thing is that they don't always explode, or the time it takes is so prolonged due to server lag you never know when to run in to loot the scraps
---
Spotlights have never, and I mean never, actually worked for me. I've moved them, stored and replaced them, nothing works. I did get one to "light," but the it was just the bulb - it didn't even cast any light on the ground!
---
This is my new favorite, now that my C.A.M.P. has a garden and it’s protected enough that I no longer lose crops.  I still need to plant melons and gourds.  I’ve found them, just have never taken them back to my camp yet.  
---
The normal cryolator is for close range, but the explosive mod gives it unlimited range it seems. And yes, it gets the bonus damage and the explosion. 
---
Pretty much constantly. I actually managed to remember that Sentry Bots do the same today, probably saved a teammate's life by calling it out.
---
Worst part is doing the Forest Protectron Horde event, killing the legendary, getting killed by the explosion, and having the loot disappear because I have to re-enter the interior area. &gt;\_&lt;
---
I tried pistol build as well along the same lines with both and had the same issue.  Eventually just dropped pistols and went shotguns with one toon.   The other is now a mule. 
---
Been on the fence for months! Ain't taking the plunge now, good guy OP
---
I have faith that propriety may yet reign victorious upon this scorched earth again! We gentlemen have but to live our convictions and sow that which we desire to reap.
---
You didn’t really make it clear that he cheated. The way you wrote it wasn’t very good. 🤷‍♀️
---
Do I need to have the Weapon Artisan perk card equipped for Luck of the Draw to work over 100%?
---
Thanks very much for this 
---
 Raiders gotta raid. Its not what I do, but we need the scummy bastards. The game is so rewarding if you just play it. ;)
---
Hell yeah! That’s awesome 😊
---
Of course!  
---
Put it in the Overseer’s cache just down the road from vault 76. It’s the first place new players are sent too.
---
Yeah the behemoths seem so watered down in comparison to fo3 and 4
---
Level 99 I spend my time collecting mats to build and scrap guns for mods. I'm also starting to dabble in armor now since my gun smithing is getting up there so I'm motivated to level for those perks. I dont farm white springs to often so my level 99 is 200+ hours ingame 
---
First meeting so a bit nervous, but hello, my name is Rob 'nd I am an Altoholic.
---
My wife makes fun of me for spending 3+ hours on one camp but I like to do it. I'm level 164 currently and have done all the main quests and have solo launched 5+ nukes. I didn't build as much early on because I was questing and moving around the map a lot, im just farming plans and mods now and launching an occasional nuke. Waiting for some new content. So I have had a lot of free time to build. 
---
*jazz music stops*
---
I sure as shit hope not.
---
You have one? And is it still auto
---
Them? They can cry me a fucking river. They lucked out, and if the reaction bothers them, they can put that weapon away for a while.
---
they are in the game, just cut out for now, like all future content
---
(Xbox) I post here, and message high levels in the world. Last time I think I had 5 people forming a line for grahm haha. 
---
I know what you were meaning and my point still stands I’ve been encountering it time and time again since launch. 
---
I’ve found the main areas (white springs, Morgantown and queen) play up more than others for me
---
Ill take em off ur hands...
---
Yea this guy just said his friends does 400k damage and it still does slap damage. Have you actually tested it?
---
It turned into a glowing behemoth but we killed in about 5 seconds lol
---
The hero Appalachia needs right here.  
---
Yes please, me and my boyfriend were griefed by a moron one shotting us while we were wearing power armour. They wouldn’t leave us alone until they managed to pick up our junk after a while, honestly just ruined the experience for me as there was no way to fight back. They never became wanted for some reason either so we couldn’t get revenge. 
---
Yes!!!
---
lel agree.. underrated comment
---
Are they though?
---
Did they cite a reason? Just curious.
---
Did you read the clown costume description? They made a "whos laughing now?"-joke
---
Fantastic guide friend thanks much. Just as a general question, anyone know where the heck I get the Barn/Brick/Metal/Warehouse sets? I CANNOT for the life of me find any!
---
the dc’s sound common, too common. 
---
you wired to your router?  any other device using the same network?
---
i get blue screens once every two hours or so, always with pip boy access.  
---
any more common elements other than sbq queen?  party chats? 
---
Ya, but how many times has this happened to you?
---
The sky isn't falling because a handful of players reported that this was their experience. 
---
Don't just parrot shit in an effort to make this issue seem more prevalent than it is.
---
Someone said it's 1 to 5. I haven't tried it but it seems good anyway. And I think it would be great if it were a permanent feature also. It's disappointing that it's limited.
---
It’s multiplayer with pvp. That makes it competitive. Literally.
---
One could argue that the pvp is kinda crap, but it doesn’t matter. Pvp exists and that makes the game competitive.
---
not to mention more and more people seem to be going "raider" or "bounty hunter", just out to kill as many people and their CAMPs as possible whether they fight back or not... i started to *dread* running into other players and, like the person in this story, was always suspicious of anyone especially if it looked like they were interested in me.. it's kind of a sad state of affairs for a multiplayer game like this to actively discourage socializing with strangers. I realize that's not necessarily the game's fault; it's the players that are doing it, but i feel like the state of the game is what encourages that behavior (Nothing to do at "end game", really shitty drops from the hardest bosses, only one single weapon type [TSE] that anyone wants, almost any other legendary combination is considered crap) 
---
That and the nerf to workshop resource production means every time some jerk comes along and destroys your base for no reason, the loss of materials to repair hurts a lot more
---
Omg I pray for solo servers for you jesus christ buddy lol changes are hard. If you wanna play an old fallout with old fallout rules, PLAY AN OLD FALLOUT
---
I’ve heard people get emails, but I didn’t get anything but an error code. It seems as if they also deleted ours Bethesda accounts. 
---
Right on! #FreeWooby
---
as long as it's not an emote we have to pay atoms for I'll be happy
---
Oof Prime
---
Yes. If they weren’t, I wouldn’t have said they were. Common sense and all.
---
Or you could just check your rad resist, pick up a toy, and see how much it goes up. Geez. 
---
Yup, noticed it while fast traveling. Im really surprised by this patch so far. Im still on the same server almost 6h. And not only me, still 20 other people here.
---
Ususally the servers got empty the longer you've been on them(as far as I can tell from what I saw)
---
Thank you for such an informative reply!
---
I was playing with my real life friend and he stepped out of his power armor and  two power armor sets appeared.  No idea how it happened.
---
It wasnt really out of the way. The messages were more like "I bought this off reddit, how is that cheating?" and he would reply "ur a piece of shit I hope you get banned".  I just explained more on here when I told the story. And I felt like explaining to him where I got my stuff and showing him what I had would get him to leave me alone. He kept following me and stalking around my base til I got fed up with killing him over and over and just left the server. 
---
&gt; Can someone please explain to me how griefers can one shot kill me if I'm set to pacifist?  
---
Pacifist means nothing. This prevents you damaging other players, thats it. Damage you receive is the same no matter your pacifist settings.
---
It's what i fucking live for, HOW DARE YOU!!!
---
I read you.
---
Computed K
---
Come on man. It gives the player a reason to re gather things and re explore. I mean, I only do this once in a while any ways. My base has been destroyed plenty of times. I mean completely eradicated lol. I just did my thing and rebuilt
---
Well I'm one of them, and you just seem to hate them as much as dupers for their luck.
---
Untrue, with armor ignoring weapons builds and bobblehead cheaters you can be killed insanely quick even if you don’t shoot back. 
---
Yes it is.
---
Mutation farming is inefficient. Just spend that time playing the game and earning caps. Serums are cheap on here and you can get exactly what you want.
---
If sabers be agreed upon by both parties, I see no reason to stifle their use...but one needs strike with conviction and in only 3 bouts, hostilities ending in each when a blade strikes true.
---
Anything further would be naught but a display of pure unbridled *barbarism*. And as always reconciliation should be aspired to between each bout lest we cease to be gentlemen.
---
The only becoming of this I can think of is one of the items we’ve purchased from the Fallout Marketplace was duped. 
---
At least it's all repairable with the same materials. The placement remains. 
---
Not seeing a doghouse in Sutton..
---
Easier ways to get people to leave you alone, without sending messages back and forth, but I hear you, big dawg.
---
I had this problem as well, I ended up having to un-bulk any bulked mats to get it to build. Took me a lot of time troubleshooting to figure it out. Hope it works for you.
---
Apparently it’s still bugged
---
Cannot confirm though as work shops are still a waste of time &lt;.&lt;
---
True 
---
How uncouth! A tool of lesser men, truly.
---
I equipped a Power Fist with and without the Gladiator perk and saw no damage increase. I admit my testing is limited to two, the Power Fist and some Knuckles but it was clear. I'll test again but would ask you to do the same if you can. I'd love it to benefit from melee and 1H perks because I have those but they didn't.
---
And while I won't "cry you a river" I would be more than happy to introduce you to the barrel of my TSE lever action that I got legitimately and farmed hours for. And no, I won't trade it to you, or anyone else for that matter, because it would get duped.
---
What’s a mat
---
i found a lvl 10 exploding pipe pistol on a vendor yesterday; converted it to a sniper. it does like 50% more damage than my lvl 50 exploding combat rifle. I bought a pistol +10% damage perk card, and it stacks with the rifleman perks i already have. So now Im really conflicted. my rifle+melee build cant doesnt have much room for all the pistol perks too.
---
tl:dr version: pipe pistols count as rifles and pistols, so you can really pimp them out
---
Found and scrapped a while back. Hahahaha 
---
That's the spirit! You always have to keep dreaming!
---
The one with the super duper mart next to it?
---
Oh yes, pvp system and balance is the problem AND explosive two shot needs a nerf. The duping just makes the problem more prevalent as everybody seems to have one of the broken weapons. 
---
Where’d you get the corpse mask?
---
If it's slap damage, you should have a good amount of time to leave the game.
---
What’s your discord boy? You and I are going to have a chat.
---
True, I have said in other comments I let what he was saying irritate me and I took it personal. Felt like I had to prove him wrong kind of thing. I should have just blocked him or muted him and went about my day. Next time, I'll just ignore them. 
---
Map meshing is blatant cheating. Maybe you aren’t familiar with this practice in gaming?
---
As to the part where you said I didn’t write it very good, if you were referring to the point where I don’t explain to you how to mesh ( I’m not on here to promote or educate people how to cheat) then sure, that may have been difficult for some to translate. 
---
Never the less, I made it clear that the player had a bounty and wasn’t able to be found until we found him hiding under the map through his illegal entry point. 
---
Clear and obvious cheating so I’m not sure where your misinterpretation took place. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Beth's doing? Just like how I should blame the shallow end game instead of people being scrublords? Which you were downvoted to oblivion for? Nice try, troll. PVP may happen in game, but when you can be followed through servers it is another story. Nice try and goodbye 
---
Wired to the router and a decent gaming rig.  Hasn’t thought about other devices though. I’ll disconnect some of those next time.  
---
The problem is PVP even being in this game makes no fucking sense with regards to the story and theme. We're all supposed to be from the same vault and pretty much indoctrinated with the idea that we need to rebuild the region. So then what? We all get out and it's like "fuck you tom I've always hated the way you slurp soup, now its time to die fucker".
---
Its fucking stupid. Just give people the option to completely disengage from pvp. And let people like me and OP shoot each other in the face until we're bored.
---
A dream / nightmare cross-over.
---
Pffff... 😂😂😂😂
---
Bugthesda 
---
material*
---
If they weren’t already dead I’d have killed them myself and pissed on their corpses. I had to deal with their stuck up nonsense in Fallout 4. And that cringey robot crap was just silly. Got to the point where I just killed all BOS members for kicks.
---
Im having a very very hard time playing endgame now. Its sooo unrewarding at high level with all the bugs and all the content you may not have yet locked behind infinitesimal rng.
---
How dare you!
---
Use rows of punjabi sticks and missile turrets 
---
Or the basis option to return to the server you just fucking got d/c'd from.
---
Some people just wanna see the world burn. I've read that crouching removes you from the minimap and I'm going to start doing that at my base because I do think that's how they find you most of the time. I've built in places way out of the way and had random people show up. Or my c.a.m.p cannot be placed because someone else's is near. Maybe we are all thinking the same thing, build out of the way- but we end up in the same spots. 
---
I agree. I dumped 2000 hours into fallout 4 and found maybe half a dozen explosive weapons from legendary drops. The only super OP one was a mini gun which I didn’t use because it made survival mode like very easy. I get that it’s a little easier to farm them in 76 by nuking white springs but it seems like every other 76 player has a tse from 100 odd hours of gameplay and I’m willing to bet the RNG just isn’t anywhere near that likely for them to be so common. 
---
Really, I dont pvp and need to repair my legs on my power armor about every 8 hours of game time,  I'm about the same level as you, and repair it to 200%.
---
&gt;to what most people have access to.
---
The above portion of my statement that you quoted is applicable to the assassin sentinel. Regarding TSE weapons, they just about 'all' single shot people, even with dense in my experience, unless you also use fireproof, and have SERIOUS damage reduction (As most players are doing 2k approximately with TSE, and only 1k of that is explosive damage, so the remaining 1k is only subject to armor reduction, and 75% reduction of damage which is normal for high end armor, is really good, but not enough when the leftover damage is 1k.   
---
Obviously sentinel assassin is what you wanna run super late game, as an 'enthusiast' post level 100 player. However, that armor is not widely available (Doesn't even appear to have been duped honestly), and drops so rarely that there will likely never be a meta for it. Of course end game you can grind up to 20k caps, and you can with patience find someone selling a piece of the armor for 10-20k, so it's possible to get it for sure, not trying to dissuade people, but since your looking at grinding 100k caps worse case scenario, your looking at close to three months to get it even as a high level character if you don't have it at all.   
---
I will add that a high level character would be better off grinding for gear to sell so they can bypass the 1,300 cap vendor limit, and by selling to players get 100k caps in probably a couple weeks, so even more realistic. Problem is, making it sound this easy is misleading, if a TON of players start doing this, the value of the pieces will rise with demand, as they certainly aren't dropping fast enough to keep up with demand. Net effect may be 25k or max cap prices for each, and some form of honor system for 'additional items.'
---
The capitol building (a big office building if I recall) had a bunch of typewriters and maybe fans if I recall.
---
I would definitely say that 3K+ is not cheap
---
True true
---
Fyi, you don’t need to wipe your camp
---
Just move it, go to storage
---
Will have everything already aligned for plopping back down 
---
Haven't played yet, what's the worse one?
---
If there was viable and consistent end game content, yes you’d be seeing less griefer. It’s not a hard concept to understand but you’d rather whine like a baby 
---
It's pretty simple to understand. If there is literally no reason not to break the rules then people will break the rules, that is on the authority and owner to sort out. 'But why can't people just play nice' is a fucking childish and completely naive viewpoint.
---
... there are potted plants; ferns and succulents 
---
gets blasted in the face again and again
---
Ya, but I have two issues with that:
---
1) They have been actively eliminating double dipping, the M79 grenade launcher being the latest victim
---
2) This directly invalidates all non pipe pistols, which if intended, blows my fucking mind. I have to believe this is an unresolved bug.
---
Lvl 93, have found one 2 shot pipe .308, no explosive shot anything yet. Farm Watooga streets and HS, also whitespring and uranium fever...so far, no two shot or explosive heavy weapon.
---
Yeah I wouldve just left the game, blocked him via profile and joined the world back (If my friends were in there). 
---
Can I borrow a feeling?
---
Thanks for this info, very useful!
---
Seeing you're a person of legendary culture, do you happen to know if the nocturnal effect on weapons and armor is OP? I've googled quite a bit but wasn't able to find any stats on the matter.
---
Only part of the problem.   stacking and duping both need to be fixed. 
---
Perhaps if there weren't jerks running around doing enough slap damage to 1 shot someone pvp would be more enjoyable for most people. 
---
I don't mind pvp when everyone is on equal footing,  but getting facerolled by a cheater doesn't sound like fun.
---
You can shoot off limbs.
---
You don't need to do half of those steps. I got the key long before I went anywhere near Watoga. I think I got it from the Nuka Cola plant. I only have lockpick 1, but I don't remember exactly what happened.
---
Finding the damned dome is a pain though, thanks.
---
Oo so that’s what it means
---
Ha! Lucky you buddy. I'll pick the most recent of a hundred examples. Was at Hornwright Testing Site #03 (go there, take excavator armour, lead and iron ores everywhere) when I got a disconnected from server. 
---
I load back in and once the load screen ends the following happens:
---
I can see the landscape and my power armour HUD, registering 0 for HP, AP and fusion core, the usual. I can move, but not run. Cannot as yet draw my weapon.
---
Scorchbitch echo waves start flying in at me, no scorchbitch to be seen, but they are spamming the hell out of the donuts of doom. I hear melee attacks coming from behind and gunshots coming from ahead.
---
It finally finishes loading and the Scorchbitch and 4 scorched appear, my HP is down to 25% and finally I can move, draw weapons, heal and generally get some payback on them all.
---
From receiving first echo donut to being able to fire back roughly 20 seconds.
---
For me they aren't faster at all, there's now a second added load in time whenever I fast travel and so far today containers and corpses took a lot longer to generate loot. I'm on PS4 too. plus in the post I mentioned before there seems to some weird stuff with enemies spawning in the floor, I even ended up finding some T posing super mutants "defending" Grafton Steel workshop earlier.
---
Just be sure to keep it safe, sane, and consensual. If you are visiting this dungeon be sure to let a friend know where you are going first and make sure to agree on a safe word.
---
i got bored and wore my black cowboy hat and western outfit yesterday while visiting vendors. Its a silly looking costume considering they literally removed the chaps so there would be two versions and more rng. The jeans dont look right.
---
\&gt;&gt;&gt; /r/secondlife
---
Thought so.
---
few hours yet.
---
These people figured you out lol. They know it’s all a figment of your imagination.
---
I’ve shot limbs off gouls, but that’s it other than heads popping 
---
Speak for yourself, mine’s still terrible. 
---
Lag spikes, t posing enemies, disconnects etc...
---
It’s a shame :( 
---
Oh god... the cringe... 😂😂😂😂
---
Were these the same guys that hit me?
---
Duping bitches aren’t allowed to talk about “cringe”.
---
Yeah, sorry. I have spent too much time in this sub the last three months.
---
I very nearly got the Santa PA paint job just for the string of lights
---
This is what people think is exciting? =/
---
The two nuke locations aren't particularly exciting either.
---
you're doing the Lord's work, brotha!
---
My game crashes every 5 to 10 minutes.. =/
---
I'm sitting on 500 gears because I have no use for them, but people say it's one of those things you never get rid of. Springs on the other hand.....trying to make a bunch of 50cals for some mods. RIP my springs after that...
---
The problem isn't solely the existence of a cash market.
---
As you said, most online games often have a thriving cash market. There's no denying this.
---
However most games also have a sizable portion of their player base not engaging in the cash market. And that's the problem here with selling duped weapons. 
---
It negatively impacts that part of the player base. It fucks up the pure trade market for those players. 
---
I actually have little issue with people selling items for cash. I look at a personal favourite, Rocket League, which has a cash market for very high end items, but also a very active healthy regular trade market. 
---
Duping and selling however unbalances the trade market for the entire player base who does not want to engage in the cash market. 
---
It doesn't matter if you play solo. Or don't trade. Lots of players play MP and lots of players trade. I trade very regularly, mostly in junk. Junk is a high consumption item however so it being duped has largely not impacted me. 
---
I
---
Yikes lol feelsbadman 
---
if you cant play the game without cheating and ruini g the experience for other peoople, then youre the childish one, not me. i love how all you chums are backing up the dupers and ragging on the people that dont like them. real healthy for the game right? 'get a grip'
---
No prob happens to the best of us
---
No youre thinking of the *cattl*ing gun, the catling gun fires claws and anstead of going *pew* it goes *meow* or *nya* depending on region
---
If so I'm out
---
I doubt that but I also didn’t think they would release a broken game. Nothing under the sun would surprise me about this game at this point except a complete turnaround. 
---
Been there. More than twice. You’ll get it back, just a matter of time.
---
"idc. just stop crying." says the person crying about it, why is this post even a thing? nobody cares if you pvp or not. 
---
Downvoting doesn’t invalidate facts but what ever makes you feel better champ
---
yeah but assholes shooting decontamination arches requires flux to fix
---
You could drink a marsupial mutation serum. Or just keep irradiating yourself until you get it again
---
Serum, most redditors sell them between 500-1000 caps 
---
When you get the Missle launcher plan, it doesn't actually allow you to make a Missle launcher, only a Missile launcher, which is totally different than a Missle launcher.
---
How about X-01?
---
Cash trading is illegal. Try not to participate in it, just go for caps etc.
---
And before anyone tries to downvote or tell me it isn’t illegal, yes it is. Making money off Bethesda’s game without their permission is illegal.
---
Yeah but can you get banned for it? It'd be nice to have but I don't want to risk it.
---
Dont know your level, but an extra bladed death claw gauntlet is really fun against them. 
---
Use to be fun in the first 3 weeks
---
You didn’t say illegal entry point. 🤷‍♀️ Don’t get so offended, some people are bad at writing. It’s ok.
---
Don't think that's possible since I have tried it myself.
---
I did that. It didn't work
---
I call them Ghunkies.

For leather its Padded, not Dense. Dense is for Combat/Metal/Robot I believe. I con confirm Dense plans for those exist, I sold one a few days ago I bought off a vendor in Watoga. Also worth mentioning you can learn Dense/Padded from deconstructing armor. I learned Dense for Combat Armor from deconstructing armor.

Hey, we have the serum. Normally sell for 150c, sell it to you for 100c. GT MadDogMolina 
---
Hell, I haven't even found one bobblehead of my same damage type yet, not to mention hundreds or thousands of them. I'm just repeating the conditions that have been consistent across multiple threads.
---
There is no reason they should stack, so it is the major problem now. Fix that and the bobbleheads become no longer worth to stockpile. As it stands now the damage increase ones I just stockpile and with a little bargaining I can maintain a substantial buff almost all the time i am online without duping. 
---
Also to be explicit, Dense and Padded are the same effect.
---
Damn. You really can learn something completely new every day here. Thanks for shedding light. 💡 
---
It is, I’ve done it with most of my weapons. It’s just rare. It also hasn’t happen too often lately because most things I shoot at die straight away and explode from bloody mess.
---
This
---
And the ~~cutting boards~~ paddles
---
I mean, yeah, I do more damage per hour now that I've switched to unarmed, but when I was fill gunslinger, I could one shot someone in power armor with a crit headshot, and I could do it without having to charge into melee range under fire. I do more damage, but die way more now, too.
---
So you're saying you fast traveled into a nuke zone?
---
I don't hate the people who have had the luck. But look at it from my point of view: You effectively won the lottery in this game, and you want me to feel sorry for you?
---
Guessing GT is gamertag for Xbox? I’m on PS4 :( thanks though 
---
If it’s a bug, I hope they don’t fix it.
---
It’s kind of funny.
---
Yea man I feel you here. I’ve done it twice now. I NEVER take starched genes off now. 
---
I've now checked all three sites 3 times now after a whitesprings nuke targeting and nothing.  The holotape is never in the cache, or at site Alpha in the cache OR the vault tec holotape holder.   Outta ideas.  I know there is no reward, but wanted to ask if once you complete the quest can you at least dump all the overseer logs outta your inventory?  That alone is worth it to relieve the clutter.  
---
Indeed. To combat that we don’t store anything there. Player 1 doesn’t place an item until player 2 is ready and at the container. Not a perfect solution but it’s fast. We save important items like good legendaries and what not for trading. 
---
I don’t even have power armor pieces just a frame
---
Second time I got it..didn’t know how to keep mutations the first time...oh man I messed up 
---
Had a friend do the exact same thing then dying over and over again since he kept respawning in the red zone. It's weird that the game always teleports you near where you want to go but why the fuck would you people teleport near a red zone without power armor or a hazmat suit.
---
Read the description on the clown suit. They made a "whos laughing now?"-joke.
---
/u/FounderHawk, any update since Dec 29? Have there been more submissions and do you have an update to the spreadsheet or ***The Central Project***? I merged in the known plan locations into my spreadsheet here at the end of December, and posted my list here [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout\_76\_all\_plans\_recipes\_weapons\_weapon\_mods/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/)
---
I'd like to do another update to it if you have an update to your plan location list.
---
Hope not if there is then the game would be more than shit it would be BULLSHIT that’s what
---
Sorry mate. Good luck. 
---
Learning the hard way 
---
You should compare armor to the best power armor, because comparing to X-01 just isn't fair. So, for this conversation, we should be comparing the possibilities of armor to T-51.
---
Subbed she has some great places thanks dude 
---
Same thing happens on Xbox lmao
---
Make it single player?
---
Console and PC have actually been doing updates in tandem up until this most recent update, so to blame certification isn’t necessarily accurate. There’s been no confirmation in Bethesda’s end that this is their logic or reasoning behind their decisions. 
---
Regardless you shouldn’t lost your junk if you didn’t initiate combat. That was another benefit to not engaging back against people damaging you. They do slap damage and even if they kill you, your junk doesn’t drop, but it’s bugged.
---
Munch munch munch, more karma says OP
---
Gtfo..what!?
---
Are you standing in boiling acid by any chance? Or are the super mutants just trying to sweep the leg?
---
Fasho! Goodlook!
---
I only heard about bans from texture changes, like highlighting magazines and bobbleheads. But even that could have been manufactured rumor like the trade steal thing.
---
That's right. Having the Bloody Mess perk activated does seem to interfere with your chances of severing a limb from ghouls or as you've just said they die off before you can dismember. 
---
The ritual mask can be found in the basement of the Mothman Museum in Point Pleasant or found deep inside the Lucky Hole mine, on top of a control panel in a room located behind the altar. 
---
I think the final step is to take a picture and register the armor in the room next to the lab. This gives you the extra 100lb carry weight.  
---
Then you can begin the tedious non-quest to find calibrated shocks for an extra 50 per leg. 😀
---
No problem. The middle one is best, I think. As you can use the second story for generators. But its the closest at to the super mutants.
---
I just found my first explosive 3 star weapon at level 30, and its a cryolator I had like 13 ammo for.
---
Well the one before the one that came out today was also a week behind PC. Their explanation was they are able to send out hotfixes easier on PC, theres apparently a longer approval process for console. 
---
Gotcha. It makes sense in a canon sort of way since scorched are supposed to be crazy with rage basically
---
 I like the Civil War suit. Its got a long coat and a ruffled shirt and boots and that's my favorite Cowboy costume so far. I have the bought Cowboy Hat and the Black one.

meh i barely tried

Nobody was in the room I was farming. The 2 that did this found me and waited until the mine triggered and ran into the room.
---
Yeah. An hour ago. 
---
These are the plans that are listed in the game files. My script did not do a search through the levelled lists to see if it is possible for them to spawn into the world. The ones with an EditorID of CUT_ or POST_ are definitely not in the game. The others should be obtainable otherwise Bethesda would have put CUT_ or POST_ in front of them. I know some plans are bugged, like Plan: Protected Lining Casual Underarmor, which is supposed to be in the game but will not drop in the world due to a bug with the main quest that is supposed to drop it. Other plans might have the same problem.
---
Good God, man... That's a ton of text.
---
Maybe go outside next time, instead?
---
The forest around vault 76
---
If anything positive came from it...immediately tried to get it back...and got Grounded instead. Silver lining?

Two shot explosive

Same thing happened to me (xbox) im guessing i just need to give the game like 3 minutes to load before accessing the pip boy and it didnt freeze on me.
---
Bubblegum bear + 5 rad resist

Maybe if you break your TV because people were mean to you on the internet, you need to step away from the internet.
---
&gt;if you cant play the game without cheating and ruining the experience for other people, then youre the childish one, not me.

You're the one who thinks that people should just 'play nice'.

"stop having fun!" - A disgruntled gamer, 2019
---
I understand, although how would you feel if everyone called you a duper because of your weapons power, or didn't care if you got swept up in some ultimate solution because it wouldn't effect them any? And the thing you sought and farmed so much for was demonized to the point of being an asshole for using it?
---
Did he just say ad victoriam? Is he now a brother steeler or a Responder?
---
Also buying serums from players still require the same amount of server hoping. My reasoning for not buying serums is that i still don't know if they fixed carnivore/herbalism or not. I don't want to pay for 10 serums then find out carnivore serums bugs out and have to delete them all.
---
Same old complaints, so I'll give you the same old response:
---
If you don't like it, don't play it. That doesn't mean I can't play and enjoy it.
---
I don't see anyone saying this but its important. If you are using mutations or have a mutation build don't sell Rad-x: diluted or rad away: diluted. Regular rad away, and rad-x will negate the effects of your mutations, the diluted stuff wont.
---
Wait a second....
---
It might be a little over powered with a charisma build with unyielding armour. They would be able to share 10 level 1 perks
---
This is off topic but I have to ask why you made the L in “TLDR” a lower case but the rest upper case.
---
I made a strobe light window bedroom with a wrap around walk with couches to look into 😊
---
10-4 boss 😂😂😂
---
I had trouble getting into a server, kept disconnecting at "entering world" but once I was in I was good to go for 4.5 hours. I may actually try completing quests again if this keeps up.
---
Private servers sounds like where the real fun is, I think that would be a much more enjoyable experience no doubt. There isn’t a whole lot of love for the official servers even among the community but I need to visit the private server side here soon.
---
Are you sure its not because of all the handmades you were selling a month ago? No way all those were legit drops either 
---
Yeah, and then a bomb fell.
---
Just west and east of Grafton, around the farms.
---
I've been targeting Scorch Beast's head, but recently someone swears to me their tail/belly area is the most vulnerable.  I'm skeptical.  Anyone test weak spots with SB's?
---
Ahhh more server space for us thank you!
---
I've started nuking different areas on the map just to see what spawns and what kind of nukes flora there is in different areas. So far most places have been boring compared to white springs and prime fissure. Hoping I'll find a decent area for some high level deathclaws or something. When I'm not nuking I help some lower lvl players with whatever they need if I can or just out and about exploring the wasteland more and collecting junk
---
why not just wait to repair it until it's broken? it doesn't fuction any differently if it's damaged or not
---
Took me like 15min to write it out. What is the problem? you can't focus or type a paragraph ?
---
Pretty much just rumor from what I can tell. Being that it lends towards gatekeeping it makes me doubt that assumption.  We need some proofers.  
---
What is your objective with this post?
---
If you don't like the game, don't play it. Move on and play something else. 
---
This obsessive squalling is just silly. 
---
This.. It needs to go through the approval process at microsoft/sony before it can be released publicly. They manage their own PC side of it, so they can just be like "yup, here ya go"
---
Well when the mine triggered from the glowing ones one of them ran into the room and took damage then I became wanted and in another second the guy behind me, his partner, killed me.
---
Most people will say it's garbage, but the reality is it depends on if you're patient to play ONLY at a certain time. It's really only good for PvE Solo though, if you do PvE Co-op your friends won't appreciate the inconvenience of needing to find a server where it's night, and if your PvPing you can again focus on a 'specific time' but a lot PvP lately is chasing people across servers, and that means your weapon loses all reliability as the next server can be on a totally different day night cycle.  
---
That said, the damage can more than double at the 'peak' of the night, which makes it better than explosive, instigating, two shot, and bloodied under very specific conditions. I think you're looking at 20 minutes of play that way max though before you have to wait and do something else, or hop servers. The weapon actually does LESS damage than a normal weapon during the day, so you will literally be handicapped if you get caught having to do something in daylight.   
---
I find it too conditional to personally use, but I absolutely refuse to tell people it's garbage since under some conditions it's actually capable of being EXTREMELY OP. Explosive Nocturnal CAN beat Explosive Two Shot in terms of damage, and DEFINITELY in terms of accuracy (Huge unlisted accuracy penalty for two-shot weapons). 
---
no, i think people shouldnt EXPLOIT AND DUPE IN THE GAME. i could care less if people are friendly and 'playing nice' as you put it. which i literally never even said. so go ahead and keep putting words in my mouth dumbass. 
---
Probably not, but I was a middle man. 
---
Ha ha! You're exactly why normal people hate this train wreck of a game.
---
It’s fine if you use it right, and two shot with mirv is awesome.
---
This is my exact build. Still doesn't come close to my other non pistol builds at this point, and those perks can apply to any weapon. What is the advantage of using those perks with pistols as opposed to the inherently more powerful rifles and shotguns? AP cost? I haven't noticed much of a difference between weapons when it comes to per shot AP cost and those perks essentially invalidate AP cost anyway.
---
Sounds like you are trying to convince yourself not to play. Most people here know the game has problems but play it anyway. 
---
There's one on the left side of the road dead, going from the overseers camp into flatwoods and there are two more in flatwoods hanging near the tents paat the church and red rocket

---
Ya new in the patch but for some reason forgot they still give event notification to go collect them for everyone else.  I imagine that is going to lead to a ton of pissed off people that don't read patch notes. 
---
Saw a post recently about shooting them in the butt...
---
 A lot of us are having fun. I'm a bit sad that you are not. Perhaps you are taking it, a game, a bit too seriously.
---
Might also be to do with the fact that the port has different file management and packing 
---
Born in 1997 eh?  That explains it all 😂
---
&gt; i think people shouldnt EXPLOIT AND DUPE IN THE GAME.
---
Semantics. You literally have the viewpoint of a child, that everyone should just follow the rules despite there being no enforcement.
---
I’ll probs do that, or in flatwoods. Just thought it would be cool for them to see a friendly face. It happened to me when I was very low level and it was a game changer 
---
Sometimes I wish we were more like Japan, and instead of hat day we could have something meaningful like "be nice to old people day" and "respect nature day" - like 80% sure those are actual Japanese national holidays and not a joke

If it’s the daily for that chef me handy there should be objective circles marked on your map. They’re small so you might have missed them. Other than that there are always two in whitesprings near the tennis courts

Patiently waiting for The Outer Worlds. I just sell stuff to vendors, maybe do an event or two for trash loot, then get bored and play other games. I was doing a lot of server hopping for rare plans, but i think im done with that since its very very unrewarding. The new content for this game will amount to new 'events' than will almost never pop up when you want them to.
---
Someone r/beetlejuice Todd Howard and make him get on this RIGHT NOW
---
same here, then figured out they didn't have much useful and stopped. then figured out I had close to 300 fiberglass spools
---
Takes 3 people don’t know the specifics but it’s basically crashing the game and can crash and slow the servers for everyone else in the lobby
---
At least it takes 3 people so it’s harder to do
---
DaaAAAaaaaAAAaaadUH.
---
Hey, I get that it's frustrating in ways. But you know.. you can just stop using it for a while if you want people to like you more. And the rest of the time you can one-shot most things and easily clear and farm the content. 
---
It's going to be a disappointment for you I guess, but I have a hard time feeling bad that your shiny overpowered gun isn't -quite- as shiny as you want it to be.

That sounds like such an angry cat omg
---
Cosmetic items in general are worth collecting to sell for caps.  They all weigh 0.1 lbs, and with 3 star Bargain Hunter even the cheapest are worth 3 caps or so.
---
Yeah itll def go down. I do it cus I've got caps and kinda bored 
---
Take my fucking upvote, you fucking nipple-biting ball-licker.
---
Interesting!  I don’t trust myself with radaway so consider starched genes required.  
---
I can’t tell if people are downvoting you because they support duper’s or think you’re lying.
---
Straightjackets are the most valuable readily-available cosmetic item I've found so far.
---
Bug out how? I have carnivore and several other mutations and no issues.
---
Idk why people keep bringing up the Nuka Dark Rum/Canvas Bag controversy to trash FO76. Yeah it makes Bethesda look bad but has nothing to do with the game. It's like saying FO76 is a good game because the cookbook is amazing
---
I'm stuck in whitesprings and can't escape.
---
it's odd you can remake levelled versions of the quest items from the order of mysteries but not other quests...
---
Hmm, I've never actually verified I got all 200 after selling...
---
Haven't played it in a couole months but I'll go back to it soon. 
---
I just don't think the game is there yet. Engaging with another player right now is almost pointless. Loading times (such as fast traveling to your base while it's being attacked and shooting the player and then getting a lag spike), TSE, bobble head stacking, how the process of commencing the PvP works. Any time anyone has ever started a fight with me I've killed them. Every time. They shoot me, I shoot two or three times, the first bullet activates the PvP and the 2nd or 3rd bullet kills them. No chance to even fire back. They would have to be shooting me while I activated the PvP to even dmg me. If they were spamming bullets at me I would just wait for them to reload then I would shoot them dead. I have a TSE lever action and an explosive combat shotgun. The lever action annihilates and if I miss i can chase them down with the combat shotgun and just shoot at their feet. It's not fun really. I haven't pvp'd a melee build yet  my explosive weapons will be no good up close. 
---
The tears are flowing!!!!!! Take a napkin my friend
---
I thought that might've been why, thanks forbthe confirmation
---
I’ll add you could use a marsupial for sure
---
Why rp when you can be one in real life?
---
I liked cry cereal better...
---
Thankfully my game is more stable since the update  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
literally neither
---
Did this happen before the patch? I have never not gotten the caps I was supposed to.
---
Dem darn spoiled infants!  Whining and bitchin 'bout der 'titlements!  *shakes fist from front porch*
---
So if I obtain a “pet” and someone kills it, it can respawn? Thanks- I haven’t got one yet because I thought if it died tough titter.
---
"I have decided to jump on the negativity bandwagon, therefore, the game is a flop so stop enjoying it"
---
Same shit, different day. Go play RDR2.
---
So the issue this fixed is the loading in period where you're connected and can see the environment, but are unable to move and will die if it's a hazardous area.
---
If you need to print ammo (i.e. heavy gunner) you'll be picking up every single extra piece of steel you find and scrapping all guns you collect from enemies.
---
if you scrap a lot of guns, you'll have tons of extra rubber. it's mostly useless in that volume, but the bulk sells for a reasonable amount.
---
:0 what?
---
Then leave, most people on this sub enjoy the game 
---
I tried leveling with focus on pistol perks. It was horrible. The damage doesnt scale very good, because the perks are too many levels apart from each other.
---
The important thing about luck of the draw is it only works if you HIT your target. 
---
For example if your trying to kill scorchbeasts out of the sky make sure your shots land.
---
That perk made me anal for landing my shots
---
Me too, got plenty of good armor drops but no decent weapons. 
---
you have to server hop to respawn it but yeah it does. 
---
I'm assuming you meant to say you "shouldn't" compare armor to the best power armor, because X-01 is the best, and far superior to T-51. Based on that assumption I am replying to this comment...  
---
My concern is end-game, not fairness. There are definitely armors that can beat T-51 on all merits, particularly legendary armors, but the question is where there is a true end-game use case for the best power armor in the game, or if armor will always win out. The answer is there is a 'generalist' use case for power armor, which can't win in 'total' stats, can't win in any specialty, but can win in best 'balanced high statistics' comparisons. Completely maxed out ideal armor with all the perks will win in 'total' stats even though it loses to power armor on radiation, but on the split side nothing will give you that high of defense against 'everything' without a major compromise other than X-01. Total doesn't matter if you have a glaringly obvious weakness. As mentioned above though you can 'plug' your weakness with Rad-X, thus making it all around a better approach than power armor, but I have been assuming up until this point that we were looking for 'sustainable' builds that didn't use consumables (Ignoring the fact that fusion cores are consumed by power armor). 
---
&gt; that hard 
---
Punishing ≠ hard
---
Nah not at all Bob still waiting. :(
---
Condolences.
---
Thank you for the silver!
---
when i first started playing i had about 50+ bobble heads in my inventory before i ever thought to use any, i still keep like 5-10 of each of the ones i use as i find them for sale or in the world, so i’d be fucked just for using them as intended... so yes i’m down voting this, not because i dupe it sympathize with duper’s, but because it’s a stupid idea.
---
And steal all your caps. Happened to me last night. Thought I was relatively safe by not respawning back in, because I was encumbered. Lost everything plus my armor. 
---
Theres currently a thing going on where each toy in your inventory gives you 5 rad resist
---
Cool, so maybe he's lazy?  Good to know, considering that's exactly the point I was making, you've somehow contributed even less.
---
Before and after. It's been happening for a while.
---
Sorry to hear this. 
---
What's the chest piece? Just the padded modifier? Which I guess reduces explosive damage? Been awhile since I've played.
---
This wasn't happening earlier but it is to me now. I was fast travelling to white springs after a nuke touchdown and it froze.
---
Now every time I try to join again it loads 2 separate loading screens and then loads on a  black screen for almost 2 minutes then either works or freezes again.
---
My recent player list isn't updating so no nuke for me :\\
---
Well, since VATs build wants high agi you can usually get more benefit out of pistols. But even then, there really isn't enough agi to benefit revolvers and not have other good perks along with it; evasive, white knight 2, gun fu, gun runner and such are higher value than pistol damage buffs in the agi category. VATs build does rely on having a lot of AP to use it and pistols use less AP too. They could use more buffs, though. I carry around a quad lever action for a bit more range, though I also find rifles always weight quite a bit.
---
What Thanatos said but you only use one round per shot even though there’s two bullets. Magic.
---
True, but I honestly find plenty of adhesive around and then some to the point where I'm not even growing stuff to make vegetable starch. In a pinch, do the berkely springs workshop which can send Angler mobs. Setup the lead extractor and then just pick them off from the roof. they can't fit up the stairs. Bunches of extra adhesive.
---
Acid stole that zero
---
Well today I loaded into a nuke zone, couldn't put my hazmat suit on in time because my pip boy wouldnt come up(it was invisible), died, and was immediately disconnected from the server.
---
I dont think the problem is fixed.
---
Fuck having solid data, figure it out and stay away from my secret bonus room scrubs. Sincerely Hot Toddy-
---
the nukacrypt website already does this. the codes for all 3 silos are posted usually same day as the reset 
---
I work at Amazon, I see a of these things in bulk all day at work
---
And now my game won't fucking load up, thanks Bethesda.
---
Does it take up any budget? 
---
How does anyone else have the capability to tell you how this affects your gameplay?  They have no idea what you are building or how you like playing the game.  
---
The only thing they can do is repeat the information on the card and tell you how it affects -them- which is contextually useless information.
---
Wanna try again?
---
Nice! My camp is right by that dog house and I walk past it daily thinking to myself "I need to find out where the key to that is" but I always assumed there would just be something boring inside so I kept forgetting. I'll definitely do it this week though! Thanks!

 Can’t find it either.   All google shows me is fallout 4 stuff

As you can see from some of the pics weapons with 200k all the way to 1.7 million damage is broken as hell. We can't stop the new wave of griefers now wjo bypass everything and blow us away.

PvP is a no go at all and its effecting PvE as well.

Thank you I was wondering how much rad resist it was!

No, T-51 is the best...

Where’s my damn marine combat helmet

In before people complain about how their toys were scrapped.
---
Not to diminish the issue with mods. That shit needs to be fixed.
---
So I just started playing this game on Saturday, I understand what duping is, but I don't understand why people care if others do it or how it effects you. What difference does it make? Real question.
---
I Want your entire stock mate , my ign is any river , just drop it in there and it’ll get to me x 
---
Bethesda isn't paying you enough for this.
---
Ask for more.
---
There are some that roam about near Gauley  mine,  just follow train tracks between locum Joe's  (just north of overseers camp) and Morgantown.
---
I hate power armor in the game. Honestly I just hate the hud you get. I can’t stand it. So I just don’t use power armor. Only use it for blast zones
---
The game is open world, meaning you make what you want of it. Some people want to collect resources and plans to make incredible camps, others want to collect strong weapons and see who is better. Personally I want to get online with my 20-something kids that live on the other side of the country and chat about our day while we complete quests.
---
If a builder wants to build, it doesn't effect the PVP guy. But if the PvP guy wants to fight, it does effect the builder. Same for the resource collector, then co-op player, or the lone wanderer exploring the wasteland. It is an imbalance in the different game style.
---
The game has tried to address this by limiting the PvP effect - you can't see other people's camps unless they are in your party, if they don't fight back you damage is 1/10 of the norm, if you kill them or destroy their structures you get wanted, etc. The concept behind much of this is to make it less fun to attack passive players while attracting the other PvP players to entertain you. 
---
Unfortunately it does not discourage grieffers. That is why so many are asking that the developer increase the limitations on PvP - increase the wanted penalties, reduce it from slap damage to no damage, patch the exploits they are using to get around the slap-damage system. Creating separate PvP and PvR servers is an extreme step in my opinion and would only hurt the already shrinking playerbase. I would really prefer it if they could implement a workable PvP system the rest of us can opt-out of when we don't want to play that way.
---
Meh I disagree. I was farming whitesprings with 2 friends a few days back - we Nuked it btw.  We are all about lvl 100. 2 of us have pacifist on, one doesn’t.  That guy shoots a car which hurts 2 lvl 20s, partied with a lvl 150. They kill my friend. I watch the whole thing happen.  The lvl 20s walk up to me, and the 150 one shots me with a sledge.
---
At this point I’m mad.  Come back, turn off pacifist.  The 150 is sending me the heart, while the 20s loot my bag.. 
---
I Take my tse handmade and start shooting all over to draw mobs, then I run in front of the lvl 20s and wait for them to make a mistake. One of them eventually shoots me. I murder them both in a blink of an eye.  The lvl 150 tries to run, pull out the dragon and murder him from across the map.  Loot all their stuff.  150 comes back for more, and I serve him up another round of justice.

Most fun I’ve had in a month in this game.
---
TLDR: anything can kill you in one shot.  
---
Also, don’t fuck with a pacifist, who took the time to launch the nuke.  Not trying to hurt you, but don’t test me.  
---
This hasn’t been my experience at. It’s been the same for me after today’s update on PS4 whether I’m loading into my base or a nuke zone in white springs I still have to wait for the world to build around me and get attacked while waiting. 
---
the animals take up 10% budget.
---
 Enjoy this game and have already gotten my $$$ worth.  I think/hope it will improve in the future.  Best part of this game is interacting with the Fallout Community.  Some dipshits out there but overall a bunch of nice, creative people playing this game.
---
Ignore him. It is still hard to find stuff on Fallout 76 and I looked it up too and couldn't find anything on General Atomics Plant for the weekly pic challenge. I tried an interactive map and am skimming the in-game map as well but nothing yet. I'll let you know if I find anything.
---
I lost an egghead mutation the same way. RIP over-conditioned items.
---
For the future when the meta changes and duping is fixed.
---
the golf course in far NW/toxic valley has a workshop with 3 or possibly 4 acid vents you can put extractors on. Plus, you might get a mole rat mob which bug easily, so the event never finishes and no more mole rats come.
---
10/10 would play.
---
I can concur, I think it could be do to the maturity level of PC players compared to console. With that said I'm not fan of being around TSE weapons for a multitude of reasons.  The crackling sound for one and also the off chance I get hit  by the aoe after just repairing my armor. Although I don't complain I just take the high road out of said zone and find somewhere else to farm.
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
ESO was a shitshow for quite some time before it got good. FO76 will hopefully be similar
---
If you look up the Mistress of Mysteries questline you'll be able to claim some gear that you can level up with you as you progress, though you'll have to upgrade them with materials
---
Not glad its not just me, but also am glad its not just me. The downvote fairies really arent testing and just being fanboys.
---
Lol, I honestly have no clue, no I'm not in acid,  maybe it's the ghouls I fight.  I even fight crouched to hopefully avoid leg damage.  But my legs break twice as fast as the rest and its every 6 to 8 hours in game depending how I play.
---
Granted I have 300 springs 500 screws and gears, so repairing isnt a big deal, but I've repaired my armor a lot.  I am mostly melee which might be a lot of it.
---
I stuck with the hunting rifle and 45 handgun for the longest time, as for armor I just grabbed whatever I could that gave me good defense
---
yup, on metal armor it's called padded.
---
:)
---
what most people have access to. Point stands.
---
Yes and yes. Mines just a two star though, and the other modifier is medic, so not exactly the god roll. 
---
Cool, thanks for the help!
---
FO76, the game where you have to re-log into new servers constantly in order to have a smooth playing experience.
---
Before this patch I blew myself up many many times. 
---
Yeah this happened the one time I remembered to put power armor on before fast traveling
---
Just as broad of a stroke to assume that because youve had success others will to. In fact, I dont think your anecdote on your own powergaming success really translates to TSE's dropping "reasonably enough", if anything its evidence for the opposite. 
---
Gorge junkyard has those wonderful giddyup horse parts
---
Also have around 250 hours and had three two shot weapons (one was a harpoon which is kinda cool, but not on a heavy character and I don't mule). The other two were pistols, one was a level 5 for some reason!
---
And only one explosive weap which was on an assaultron head.
---
So yeahhh not really that often for most people.
---
LOL so that was you the other day, I grabbed all those plans took the ones I didnt have put the rest back and added my extra plans, then some asshat took them all and ran, I had just returned to flatwoods after reaching roughly lvl 20, there was a lvl 5 player there too who I was trying to get the attention of when this lvl 15 guy took all the plans out and left the server, but that was awesome thank you!
---
Honestly at lower levels, you are going to want to pick up everything, and figure out what you like. Most will say going all in melee build makes the game easy mode early game. Really I found that my character didn’t start becoming strong until I figured out how much I enjoy shotguns, and built my character around that. I am 140ish now, and I still have tweaking to do. 
---
...can i uh, go to this camp in the future? when they release these items? y'know, for uh, visual asthetics
---
Maybe your not ready yet for such a powerful weapon. There’s a plethora of legendary rolling pins, tire irons, and golf clubs dropping at the white springs every time I go there. Maybe practice with some of those for several levels before returning to a tse? 
---
Radiation reaist outside of PA/Hazmat is ass and nothing you could ever do would let you take comparable rad/s damage in a nuked zone.
---
Careful with that axe, Eugene
---
Lolz the wife is a phreak!
---
Dunno, honestly very few have ever been meaningful to me in most games.  Pretty uncommon for them to do more then idly stand there until prompted in most games I've done as well.
---
Why is this post getting so many downvotes, Jesus. Have an upvote from me.
